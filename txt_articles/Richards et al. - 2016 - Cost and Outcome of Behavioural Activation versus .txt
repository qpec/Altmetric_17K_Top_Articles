Summary
Background Depression is a common, debilitating, and costly disorder. Many patients request psychological therapy, 
but the best-evidenced therapy—cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)—is complex and costly. A simpler therapy—
behavioural activation (BA)—might be as eff
 ective and cheaper than is CBT. We aimed to establish the clinical effi
  cacy 
and cost-eff
 ectiveness of BA compared with CBT for adults with depression.
Methods In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, we recruited adults aged 18 years or older meeting 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for major depressive disorder from primary care 
and psychological therapy services in Devon, Durham, and Leeds (UK). We excluded people who were receiving 
psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 
2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms. We 
randomly assigned participants (1:1) remotely using computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratifi
 ed by 
depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of <19 vs ≥19], antidepressant use, and recruitment 
site) to BA from junior mental health workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the 
Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was given open label, but outcome 
assessors were masked. The primary outcome was depression symptoms according to the PHQ-9 at 12 months. We 
analysed all those who were randomly allocated and had complete data (modifi
 ed intention to treat [mITT]) and also 
all those who were randomly allocated, had complete data, and received at least eight treatment sessions (per protocol 
[PP]). We analysed safety in the mITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 1·9 PHQ-9 points. This trial is 
registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN27473954. 
Findings Between Sept 26, 2012, and April 3, 2014, we randomly allocated 221 (50%) participants to BA and 219 (50%) 
to CBT. 175 (79%) participants were assessable for the primary outcome in the mITT population in the BA group 
compared with 189 (86%) in the CBT group, whereas 135 (61%) were assessable in the PP population in the BA group 
compared with 151 (69%) in the CBT group. BA was non-inferior to CBT (mITT: CBT 8·4 PHQ-9 points [SD 7·5], 
BA 8·4 PHQ-9 points [7·0], mean diff
 erence 0·1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI –1·3 to 1·5], p=0·89; PP: CBT 7·9 PHQ-9 
points [7·3]; BA 7·8 [6·5], mean diff
 erence 0·0 PHQ-9 points [–1·5 to 1·6], p=0·99). Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths 
(one [1%] multidrug toxicity in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT group) and 15 depression-related, but 
not treatment-related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group and 12 in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] 
participants in the BA group (two [1%] patients who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) 
participants in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed).
Interpretation We found that BA, a simpler psychological treatment than CBT, can be delivered by junior mental 
health workers with less intensive and costly training, with no lesser eff
 ect than CBT. Eff
 ective psychological therapy 
for depression can be delivered without the need for costly and highly trained professionals.

Introduction
Clinical depression is a common and debilitating 
mental health disorder, being the second largest cause 
of global disability.1 Globally, the eff
 ect of depression 
on aggregate economic output is predicted to be 
US$5·36 trillion between 2011 and 2030.2 Reduction of 
these substantial costs is a key objective for low-income, 
middle-income, and high-income countries alike. 
Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) have the most clinical evidence. How-
ever, although antidepressant medications are cheap, 
their use is limited by side-eff
 ects, poor patient 
adherence, and discontinuation relapse risk. CBT is as 
eff
 ective as are antidepressants3 and provides long-
term protection against relapse, but it is complex and 
its eff
 ectiveness is dependent on the skills of

psychological therapists, who are expensive to train 
and employ. For low-income and middle-income 
countries in particular, the need for an extensive pro-
fessional infrastructure of such therapists limits access 
to CBT.
Globally, health services require eff
 ective, easily 
implemented, and cost-eff
 ective psychological treatments 
for depression that can be delivered by less specialist 
health workers than are needed at present to close a 
treatment gap that can be as much as 80–90% in 
some low-income countries.4 One potential alternative, 
behavioural activation (BA), is a simple psychological 
treatment for depression. It might be easy and quick to 
train junior mental health workers (MHWs) in BA who 
have no professional training in psychological therapies.5 
However, this method is only appropriate if BA delivered 
in this way is as eff
 ective as and more cost-eff
 ective than 
is CBT.
Although BA compares favourably with CBT in 
systematic reviews,6,7 the existing evidence is in-
suffi
  ciently robust to establish comparability.8 Authors 
of a Cochrane review7 called for more quality studies 
than have been done so far and the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
regarded the international evidence as insuffi
  cient to 
recommend BA for fi
 rst-line treatment in clinical 
guidelines,8 instead recommending a large non-
inferiority study: “to establish whether behavioural 
activation is an eff
 ective alternative to CBT”.8 Given 
these recommendations, we hypothesised that BA is 
non-inferior to CBT for depression treatment response 
in adults with depression and that BA is cost-eff
 ective 
compared with CBT.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority 
trial (the Cost and Outcome of Behavioural Activation 
versus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Depression 
[COBRA] trial), we recruited participants from primary 
care and psychological therapy services in Devon, 
Durham, and Leeds (UK). Eligible participants were 
adults aged 18 years or older who met diagnostic criteria 
for major depressive disorder assessed by researchers 
using a standard clinical interview (Structured Clinical 
Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [SCID]9). We excluded 
people at interview who were receiving psychological 
therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely 
suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 
2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bi-
polar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms.
We recruited participants by searching the electronic 
case records of general practices and psychological therapy 
services for patients with depression, identifying potential 
participants 
from 
depression 
classifi
 cation 
codes. 
Practices or services contacted patients to seek permission 
for researcher contact. The research team interviewed 
those that responded, provided detailed information on 
the study, took informed written consent, and assessed 
people for eligibility. The UK South West Research Ethics 
Committee gave national approval for the study (NRES/07/
H1208/60). The protocol has been published previously.10
Randomisation and masking
After eligibility was established, consent agreed, and 
baseline data collected, we randomly allocated participants 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Authors of published systematic reviews, including a Cochrane 
review, have commented on the limitations of existing evidence for 
the eff
 ectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) for depression 
compared with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and the scarcity 
of cost-eff
 ectiveness data, with the existing evidence insuffi
  ciently 
robust to establish comparability. Authors of the Cochrane review 
called for studies that improve the quality of evidence. Our pretrial 
evidence took published review fi
 ndings from the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who reported no 
diff
 erence in treatment outcome between BA and CBT immediately 
after treatment (Hedges’ g 0·139 [95% CI −0·400 to 0·122]; 
p=0·296) and subsequent follow-up (0·135 [−0·456 to 0·186]; 
p=0·409). The authors of NICE’s review regarded the existing 
international evidence as insuffi
  cient to recommend BA for 
fi
 rst-line treatment in clinical guidelines for depression.
Added value of this study
This trial addresses these research recommendations and is, 
to our knowledge, the only high-quality, fully powered 
non-inferiority and cost-eff
 ectiveness study addressing 
both the eff
 ects and costs of BA compared with CBT for 
depression. When we combine the data from our study with 
data from other international studies in the meta-analysis done 
by NICE, our data reduce the 95% CIs around the eff
 ect size for 
depression symptoms immediately after treatment 
(Hedges’ g 0·054 [95% CI −0·214 to 0·107]; p=0·514) and at 
follow-up (0·059 [−0·234 to 0·115]; p=0·503) and 
unequivocally show both non-inferiority of BA compared with 
CBT and that BA is more cost-effective than is CBT against 
commonly applied decision maker willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.
Implications of all the available evidence
Junior mental health workers with no professional training in 
psychological therapies can deliver behavioural activation, 
a simple psychological treatment, with no lesser eff
 ect than 
CBT has and at less cost. Eff
 ective psychological therapy for 
depression can be delivered without the need for costly and 
highly trained professionals.

(1:1) to BA or CBT using computer-generated allocation, 
stratifi
 ed by depression severity according to the Patient 
Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)11 (<19 vs ≥19), anti-
depressant use (taking antidepressants or not), and 
recruitment site (Devon, Durham, or Leeds). A computer-
based system allocated the fi
 rst 20 participants to each 
group on a truly random basis. For subsequent par-
ticipants, allocation was minimised to maximise the 
likelihood of balance in stratifi
 cation variables across the 
two study groups. The registered Peninsula Clinical Trials 
Unit (Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK) allocated 
participants remotely after baseline data entry to ensure 
allocation concealment. Treatment was given open label, 
but outcome assessors were masked to participants’ 
allocations. Concealment was ensured by use of an 
externally administered password-protected trial website 
with retention of a stochastic element to the minimisation 
algorithm. We recorded instances when outcome 
assessors were unmasked during interviews if par-
ticipants informed them of their allocation. 
Procedures
We developed our clinical protocols in line with published 
treatment protocols,12,13 including those from our own 
trials,14,15 advice from international collaborators, and 
NICE recommendations8 for duration and frequency of 
BA and CBT. Full-time National Health Service (NHS) 
MHWs and therapists worked half of their working week 
for COBRA (with the other half worked as normal) and 
followed written manuals to deliver a maximum of 
20 sessions over 16 weeks, with the option of four 
additional booster sessions if the patients wanted them.8 
Treatment included core and supplementary techniques 
appropriate to the BA or CBT protocol to be used as 
clinically indicated; for example, behavioural or cognitive 
strategies for management of anxiety. All core 
components of both treatments were delivered by session 
eight, which we considered to represent a minimally 
suffi
  cient dose of therapy (appendix). Sessions were face 
to face, lasting for 60 min. BA and CBT experts on the 
trial team trained MHWs and therapists for 5 days in 
either BA or CBT. MHWs and therapists were assessed 
for competence at the end of training with use of 
standardised quality criteria instruments consistent with 
the relevant treatment: either the Quality of Behavioral 
Activation Scale (Dimidjian S, University of Colorado, 
personal communication) or the Revised Cognitive 
Therapy Scale for CBT.16 Further training was given if 
competency was not demonstrated. MHWs and ther-
apists received 60 min of clinical supervision fortnightly 
from NHS psychological therapists clinically experienced 
in BA or CBT, overseen by trial team experts.
Junior MHWs—graduates trained to deliver guided 
self-help interventions, but with neither professional 
mental health qualifi
 cations nor formal training in 
psychological therapies—delivered an individually tail-
ored programme re-engaging participants with positive 
environmental stimuli and developing depression 
management strategies. Participants were encouraged to 
increase their contact with individually specifi
 ed positive 
situations and reduce their avoidance of other situations. 
Specifi
 c BA techniques included identifi
 cation of de-
pressed behaviours, analysis of the triggers and 
consequences of depressed behaviours, monitoring of 
activities, development of alternative goal-orientated 
behaviours, scheduling of activities, and development of 
alternative behavioural responses to rumination.
Professional or equivalently qualifi
 ed psychotherapists, 
accredited as CBT therapists with the British Association 
of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, with a 
postgraduate diploma in CBT, delivered a personalised 
treatment programme based on an assessment of how 
participants’ beliefs lead to emotional distress and 
ineff
 ectual coping. Participants used cognitive and 
behavioural exercises to specifi
 cally test the accuracy of 
those beliefs by identifying and modifying negative 
thoughts and beliefs that give rise to them. Specifi
 c 
techniques included participants monitoring moods and 
activities, planning of exercises to test negative beliefs, 
and thought records to identify and examine the accuracy 
of negative automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs. 
We did follow-up assessments 6 months, 12 months, and 
18 months after randomisation.
We assessed the quality of and adherence to treatment 
using audiotapes and written records of therapy sessions. 
Independent experts in both treatments rated a random 
(with use of a computer-generated random number 
sequence) sample of tapes, stratifi
 ed by therapist, therapy 
session, and intervention, for competence using the 
Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale16 for CBT (range 0–72) 
and the Quality of Behavioral Activation Scale 
(Dimidjian S, University of Colorado, personal comm-
unication) for BA (range 0–96). All therapists recorded 
the specifi
 c therapeutic techniques that they had used for 
each session on a checklist.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was self-reported depression 
severity (PHQ-9 score11) at 12 months. Secondary 
outcomes were PHQ-9 score at 6 months and 18 months 
and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders IV major depressive and anxiety disorder status 
and number of depression-free days between follow-ups 
(SCID),9 anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7),17 and 
health-related quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey)18 
at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. For adverse 
events, we recorded deaths from whatever cause and all 
self-harm and suicide attempts. The independent Data 
Management Committee reviewed all adverse events and 
made relevant trial conduct recommendations.
Statistical analysis
Previous research has suggested that non-inferiority 
margins should be half of the mean controlled eff
 ect size

from historical trials.19 Accordingly, we estimated the 
non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome using 
meta-analysis data from trials of BA14 for which BA was 
superior to controls by a mean of 0·7 SD units (95% CI 
0·39–1) or 3·8 PHQ-9 score units (2·1–5·4). Therefore, 
our non-inferiority margin was 1·9 PHQ-9 points 
(ie, 0·5 × 3·8). We infl
 ated our sample size by 20% for 
participant follow-up attrition. We planned to recruit

220 participants per arm to detect a between-group non-
inferiority margin of 1·9 PHQ-9 points with a one-sided 
2·5% α. Furthermore, although fi
 ndings from a trial20 of 
CBT have shown little eff
 ect of outcome clustering by 
therapists, the presence of a small therapist clustering 
eff
 ect (ie, an intracluster correlation coeffi
  cient of 0·01) 
would still provide the same power.
We did all analyses using a statistical analysis plan 
prepared in the fi
 rst 6 months of the trial, agreed with the 
Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee, and 
Data Management Committee. We assessed between-
group equivalence of baseline characteristics and 
outcomes descriptively and did a descriptive analysis of 
baseline characteristics by recruitment method.
We compared observed primary and secondary 
outcomes between groups 12 months after randomisation 
using linear regression models adjusted for baseline 
outcome values and stratifi
 cation variables. We did 
modifi
 ed intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) 
analyses, as security of inference depends on both PP 
and intention-to-treat analyses showing non-inferiority.21 
PP analysis provides some protection for any theoretical 
increase in the risk of type I error (erroneously concluding 
non-inferiority). Our mITT population comprises all 
patients according to and included in random allocation 
with complete data. We defi
 ned the PP population as 
participants meeting the mITT defi
 nition and receiving 
at least eight treatment sessions (representing a 
minimally suffi
  cient dose of therapy). We analysed safety 
in the mITT population. We did sensitivity analyses for 
our primary outcome and for diff
 erent defi
 nitions of PP 
(eight, 12, 16, and 20 treatment sessions) to check security 
of inference of non-inferiority. 
We accepted non-inferiority of BA to CBT (in a 0·025 
level test) if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI 
(equivalent to the upper bound of one-sided 97·5% CI) 
was within the non-inferiority margin of –1·9 PHQ-9 
points. We checked for non-equivalence of the primary 
outcome at all follow-up points using the same 
approach.
We did secondary analyses to compare groups at follow-
up across 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months using 
hierarchical 
linear 
regression. 
To 
ease 
clinical 
interpretation, we calculated proportions of recovery 
(participants with PHQ-9 scores of ≤9) and response (50% 
reduction from baseline PHQ-9 scores). We ran sensitivity 
analyses to assess the likely eff
 ect of missing data using 
multiple imputation models. We did imputation by 
treatment group using chained equations to create 
20 complete datasets under the assumption that data were 
missing at random.22 Imputation models included 
covariates as defi
 ned for the primary analysis model and 
auxiliary variables that were predictive of outcomes. After 
analysis, we combined the eff
 ect estimates from the 
imputed datasets using Rubin’s rule.23 For economic 
analyses, we took the UK NHS and personal social 
services perspective consistent with the NICE reference 
case,24 also examining a wide societal perspective, adding 
productivity losses due to time off
  work in a sensitivity 
analysis. We collected participants’ use of BA and CBT 
from clinical records, with additional resource infor-
mation (eg, training, supervision, and other non-face-to-
face activities) from therapists and trainers. We used the 
Adult Service Use Schedule to measure other health and 
social care services used, including psychotropic med-
ications. We measured productivity losses using the 
absenteeism and presenteeism questions from the

Health and Work Performance Questionnaire.25 We 
calculated eff
 ectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs) using the EuroQol-5D-3L measure of 
health-related quality of life.26 We assigned health states 
from the EuroQol-5D-3L measure a utility score using 
responses from a representative sample of adults in the 
UK.27 We calculated QALYs as the area under the curve 
defi
 ned by the utility values at baseline and each follow-
up, assuming that utility score changes over time followed 
a linear path. 
We compared the costs and cost-eff
 ectiveness of 
treatments at 18 months to capture the economic eff
 ect of 
events like relapse with unit costs from the 2013–14 
fi
 nancial year.28,29 We discounted costs and QALYs in year 2 
at 3·5%.24 We used complete case analysis with missing 
data explored in a sensitivity analysis using multiple 
imputation with chained equations. We calculated the cost 
of each treatment using a microcosting (bottom-up) 
approach.30 We based MHW costs on NHS Agenda for 
Change salary band fi
 ve (salary range £21 909–28 462; 
US$31 662–41 130; €27 726–35 993) for BA and band seven 
(£31 383–41 373; US$45 350–59 786; €39 738–52 388) for 
CBT therapists and included employer National Insurance 
and pension contributions plus capital, administrative, 
and managerial costs. We calculated cost per h using 
standard working time assumptions,31 weighted to account 
for time spent on non-patient-facing activities. We applied 
nationally applicable unit costs for other health and social 
care services.
We assessed cost-eff
 ectiveness in terms of QALYs using 
the net benefi
 t approach.32 We analysed diff
 erences in 
mean cost per participant at 18 months using parametric 
t tests, with the validity of results confi
 rmed using bias-
corrected, non-parametric bootstrapping.33 We calculated 
incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratios and constructed cost-
eff
 ectiveness planes using 1000 bootstrapped resamples 
from regression models of total cost and outcome by 
treatment group. We used these bootstrapped replications 
to calculate the probability that each of the treatments is 
the optimal choice for diff
 erent values a decision maker is 
willing to pay for a unit improvement in outcome, 
representing uncertainty around the cost and eff
 ectiveness 
estimates, with cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability curves 
illustrating the probability that BA is cost-eff
 ective 
compared with CBT, dependent on willingness to pay per 
QALY.34 We controlled for stratifi
 cation variables and 
baseline values of the variables of interest, truncating data 
to exclude infl
 uential outliers—ie, cases with total costs in 
the 99th percentile that make a signifi
 cant diff
 erence to 
the results. We did all analyses using Stata version 14.1. 
This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number 
ISRCTN27473954.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. DAR, RST, FCW, SB, SR, and BB had full 
access to all the data in the study and DAR had fi

responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
Between Sept 26, 2012, and April 3, 2014, we recruited 
440 participants, randomly allocating 221 (50%) to the 
BA group and 219 (50%) to the CBT group (fi
 gure 1). 
175 (79%) participants were assessable for the primary 
outcome in the mITT population in the BA group 
compared with 189 (86%) in the CBT group, whereas 
135 (61%) were assessable in the PP population in the BA 
group compared with 151 (69%) in the CBT group. We 
noted no evidence of a diff
 erence in patient characteristics 
between recruitment methods (appendix). Patient-level 
and trial-level characteristics at baseline were well 
balanced between groups (table 1). PHQ-9 score at 
baseline was negatively skewed, with a high proportion 
of participants scoring towards the upper end of the 
distribution (data not shown), but scores were similar 
between groups (table 2).
Ten MHWs provided BA (median 22 participants each 
[IQR 19–25]) and 12 therapists provided CBT (21 [13–23]). 
MHWs had a mean of 18 months mental health experience 
(SD 11) and CBT therapists had a mean of 22 months post-
CBT qualifi
 cation (24). We removed one CBT therapist 
from the trial in the early stages who did not meet 
acceptable competency. Participants received a mean of 
11·5 BA sessions (7·8) or 12·5 CBT sessions (7·8). 
305 participants (69%) completed the PP number of at 
least eight sessions (BA 147 [67%] patients, mean 
16·1 sessions [SD 5·3]; CBT 158 [72%] patients, mean 
16·4 sessions [5·4]); participants completing less than 
eight sessions (135 [31%]; BA 74 [33%], CBT 61 [28%]) 
completed a mean of 2·5 BA sessions (SD 1·9) or 2·6 CBT 
sessions (2·1). MHWs and therapists met acceptable

Activation Scale BA competence was 55 (7·5) and mean 
Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale for CBT competence was 
37·9 (10·9).
We found no evidence of inferiority of PHQ-9 score 
at 12 months in either the mITT (CBT 8·4 PHQ-9 
points [SD 7·5]; BA 8·4 PHQ-9 points [7·0]; mean 
diff
 erence 0·1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI –1·3 to 1·5]; 
p=0·89) or PP (CBT 7·9 PHQ-9 points [7·3]; BA 7·8 
[6·5]; mean diff
 erence 0·0 [–1·5 to 1·6]; p=0·99) 
populations (table 2). The non-inferiority of BA to CBT 
was accepted for both the mITT and PP populations as 
the lower bound of the 95% CI (one-sided 97·5% CI) of 
the between-group mean diff
 erence lies within 
the non-inferiority margin of –1·9 PHQ-9 points 
(appendix). Although we initially planned to include 
therapist as a random-eff
 ects variable, given the low 
levels of observed clustering, we parsimoniously fi
 tted 
our models without therapist as a variable. We checked 
for no inference diff
 erence with and without inclusion 
of a random-eff
 ects therapist term. We ruled out 
superiority of CBT to BA as the lower bound of the 
95% CI included zero for the mITT and PP populations. 
The inference of non-inferiority was robust to 
sensitivity analysis across diff
 erent PP defi
 nitions. We 
found no evidence of a signifi
 cant between-group 
treatment interaction across the mITT or PP 
populations with the primary outcome at 12 months as 
stratifi
 ed by depression severity, antidepressants use, 
and recruitment site (appendix). 
We found that BA was not diff
 erent from CBT in 
anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), depression 
status, and depression-free days and anxiety diagnoses 
(SCID) for either the mITT or PP populations using 
observed or imputed data at 12 months (table 2). Because 
of substantial missing 36-Item Short Form Survey data at 
baseline, we analysed these data adjusted for stratifi
 cation 
variables only. We found no diff
 erence in numbers of 
participants with at least one anxiety diagnosis: BA 43 
(28%) of 153; CBT 43 (27%) of 161 (mITT population; χ² 
0·08; p=0·78). 
Between 61% and 70% of mITT and PP participants in 
both groups met criteria for recovery from depression or 
response to treatment at 12 months, with no diff
 erences 
in the proportions of patients in each group who 
recovered or responded (table 3). Using observed data for 
all outcomes, we found no evidence of a diff

between the CBT and BA groups over the period of the 
trial, as indicated by a non-signifi
 cant time-by-treatment 
eff
 ect interaction, for both the mITT and PP populations 
(appendix). We found a small, negligible clustering of 
primary and secondary outcome scores at follow-up 
across therapists overall and within BA and CBT groups 
(intracluster correlation coeffi
  cient ≤0·04).
Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths (one [1%] multidrug 
toxicity in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT 
group) and 15 depression-related, but not treatment-
related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group 
and 12 in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] 
participants in the BA group (two [1%] patients who 
overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) 
participants in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed 
and one [1%] who self-harmed). Of the 440 participants 
recruited, 76 (17%) had missing primary outcome data at 
12 month follow-up. The proportion of missing PHQ-9 
data was higher in the BA than in the CBT group 
(46 [21%] vs 30 [14%]; odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·0–2·7]; 
p=0·05). Imputation of data for primary and secondary 
outcomes at 12 months showed that in accordance with 
the observed data analysis, no diff
 erence existed between 
groups (tables 2, 3), supporting our conclusion of non-
inferiority. The odds of missing PHQ-9 data were higher 
for patients with increased baseline severity of depression 
(PHQ ≥19, odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·0–2·6]; p=0·05) and 
increasing age (in years) was associated with lower odds 
of missing PHQ-9 data (odds ratio 0·97 [0·96–0·99]; 
p=0·01). We found no evidence of an association between 
missingness and any other baseline characteristic (data 
not shown). Outcome assessors reported having been 
unmasked for 16 (4%) participants (fi
 ve [2%] in the BA 
group and 11 [5%] in the CBT group; due to participants 
informing assessors of their treatment allocation).
For economic analyses, at 18 months, full service use 
data was available for 159 (90%) of 176 participants in the 
BA group and 168 (93%) of 180 participants in the CBT 
group. We found a signifi
 cant diff
 erence in mean 
intervention costs between the two groups, but no 
diff
 erences in other categories of cost or in total cost 
(table 4).  
Mean health state utility scores according to 
EuroQoL-5D-3L were slightly higher in the BA group 
than in the CBT group across the entire follow-up period, 
with resultant QALYs also higher for BA, but the QALY 
diff
 erence was not signifi
 cant. Costs were lower and 
QALY outcomes better in the BA group than in the CBT 
group, generating an incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio 
of –£6865. The scatterplot of bootstrapped cost and 
eff
 ectiveness pairs for BA versus CBT illustrates 
dominance of BA over CBT, with the point estimate and 
two-thirds of scatter points falling in the southeast 
quadrant of the cost-eff
 ectiveness plane, where BA 
replications are cheaper and more eff
 ective than are CBT 
ones (fi
 gure 2). The cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability curve

is closer to 80% at NICE-preferred willingness24 to pay 
£20 000–30 000 per QALY.
In all sensitivity analyses, including complementary 
therapies and productivity losses, as well as analyses 
taking narrow intervention and mental health service 
perspectives, BA was signifi
 cantly less costly than was 
CBT, so BA continues to have a higher probability of 
being cost-eff
 ective than does CBT at the NICE threshold 
(appendix).24 Imputation of missing data increased the 
diff
 erence in total cost (BA £1841·67; CBT £2282·40; 
diff
 erence –£440·73 [95% CI –1007·71 to 126·26]; 
p=0·13), but reduced the diff
 erence in QALYs (BA 1·22; 
CBT 1·19; diff
 erence 0·03 [–0·06 to 0·11]; p=0·55), 
increasing the incremental cost-eff
 ectiveness ratio to 
–£16 951. The cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability curve for 
the missing data analysis again supported the likelihood 
that BA is cost-eff
 ective compared with CBT (appendix).
Discussion
We found that BA for depression is not inferior to CBT in 
terms of reduction of depression symptoms and is more 
cost-eff
 ective than is CBT against commonly applied 
decision maker willingness to pay thresholds. We observed 
our results using both mITT and PP analyses, using a 
conservative non-inferiority margin. Our economic 
analyses were driven by the lower costs of the MHWs who 
delivered BA compared with the more experienced 
psychological therapists who routinely deliver CBT. Our 
study results therefore substantiate the hypothesis that BA 
is as eff
 ective as is CBT and that its simplicity renders BA 
suitable for delivery by junior MHWs with no professional 
training in psychological therapies.5
This trial is the largest trial of BA to date and is one of 
the largest trials of psychological treatments for 
depression. We followed up participants for 18 months 
and our economic analysis is one of few in this fi
 eld. 
Therapists and MHWs working in three diff
 erent routine 
UK care settings delivered treatment, providing evidence 
of potential generalisability. We assessed therapy quality 
using independent raters and ensured that treatment in 
both arms was delivered to the standard recommended 
guidelines. Our levels of attrition and outcome loss to 
follow-up were low at 12 months and 18 months, similar 
to other trials in this area, but are still a limitation. 
Although participants in the per-protocol population 
attended similar numbers of sessions to those in other 
CBT trials,15 35% of participants chose to not even attend 
a minimal number of sessions, a problem well known to 
routine psychological therapy services. This pragmatic 
trial done in routine environments means that we were 
unable to quantify or control for the contribution of 
antidepressant medicines to outcomes. However, most 
participants who were taking medication had been doing 
so for a considerable time before entering the trial, 
making it unlikely that our results were driven by 
pharmacological treatment. Given the nature of the 
intervention and comparator, we could not mask patients 
or the mental health workers or therapists who were 
delivering the interventions to treatment allocation, but 
we used self-reported outcome measures and robust 
outcome assessor-masking procedures to reduce re-
searcher unmasking to less than 5%. Missing data for 
the primary outcome measure was substantial. However, 
our between-group inferences were robust to data 
imputation.
Our fi
 ndings could have substantial implications for 
the scalability of psychological treatment for depression 
internationally4 given the greater availability and ease 
with which a BA workforce could be trained than could a 
CBT workforce. For many years, CBT has been the 
foremost psychological therapy recommended by 
therapists, researchers, and policy makers. Our results 
challenge this dominance. Although more work needs to 
be done than has been done so far to fi
 nd ways to 
eff
 ectively treat the 20–23% of patients whose depression 
was unchanged by BA or CBT, our fi
 ndings suggest that 
BA should be a front-line treatment for depression, with 
substantial potential to improve reach and access to 
psychological therapy globally.
Our results in both groups compare favourably with a 
meta-analysis3 of the eff
 ects of CBT that estimate 
proportions of patients with remissions of around 50%. 
Our cost-eff
 ectiveness analyses show the high probability 
that BA is cost-eff
 ective and aff
 ordable compared with 
CBT at standard willingness to pay thresholds. Our most 
striking fi
 nding is that BA leads to similar clinical 
outcomes for patients with depression, but at a fi
 nancial 
saving to clinical providers of 21% compared with the 
costs of provision of CBT, with no compensatory use of 
other health-care services by patients.
Driving these savings is the fact that BA can be delivered 
by inexperienced MHWs with no professional training in 
psychological therapies, with no lesser eff
 ect than that of 
more highly trained and experienced psychological

therapists giving patients CBT. Although many obstacles 
exist to successful dissemination in addition to training of 
MHWs, our fi
 ndings suggest that health services globally 
could reduce the need for costly professional training and 
infrastructure, reduce waiting times, and increase access 
to psychological therapies.4 Our fi
 ndings have substantial 
implications given the increasing global pressure for cost 
containment across health systems in high-income 
countries and the need to develop accessible, scalable 
interventions in low-income and middle-income coun-
tries. Such countries might choose to investigate the 
training and employment of junior workers over expensive 
groups of psychological professionals. Our results, 
therefore, off
 er hope to many societies, cultures, and 
communities worldwide, rich and poor, struggling with 
the eff
 ect of depression on the health of their people and 
economies.
