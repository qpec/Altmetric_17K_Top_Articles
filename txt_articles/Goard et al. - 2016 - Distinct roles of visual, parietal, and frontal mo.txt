Abstract Mapping specific sensory features to future motor actions is a crucial capability of
mammalian nervous systems. We investigated the role of visual (V1), posterior parietal (PPC), and
frontal motor (fMC) cortices for sensorimotor mapping in mice during performance of a memory-
guided visual discrimination task. Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V1, PPC, and fMC
neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task epochs (stimulus, delay, response).
Population analyses demonstrated unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice
information across regions, with V1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early in the trial,
and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic inhibition during behavior revealed that all
regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and
response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into behavioral choice,
requiring V1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation period, but only fMC for maintaining the
choice in memory prior to execution.

Introduction
The ability to use sensory input to guide motor action is a principal task of the nervous system. Sim-
ple sensorimotor transformations, such as the patellar reflex, can be mediated by simple neural cir-
cuits within the peripheral nervous system. However, more sophisticated sensorimotor decisions, like
using a traffic signal to guide future driving maneuvers, often requires mapping specific sensory fea-
tures to motor actions at a later time, and are thought to require more complex neural circuits
extending into the cerebral cortex (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Andersen and Cui, 2009; Romo and
de Lafuente, 2013).
Over the past several decades, a number of researchers have measured neural activity during
memory-guided sensorimotor decisions using delayed-response and working memory tasks. How-
ever, despite the wealth of research in this area, there are a number of unresolved questions. First, it
is unclear which regions are responsible for sensorimotor transformation. For example, single-unit
electrophysiological recordings (Shadlen and Newsome, 2001; Freedman and Assad, 2006;
Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Andersen and Cui, 2009; Bennur and Gold, 2011) and pharmacological
inactivation (Li et al., 1999; but see Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000) studies in non-human pri-
mates have implicated posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in the mapping sensory input to appropriate
motor responses. However, recent rat auditory (Erlich et al., 2015) and mouse whisker (Guo et al.,
2013) studies have challenged this view, finding no role for PPC in memory-guided sensorimotor

 decisions. Rather, a number of studies suggest that cortical (Guo et al., 2013; Murakami et al.,
2014; Zagha et al., 2015) and subcortical (Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013; Kopec et al., 2015)
motor regions might be the key site for sensorimotor transformation. In contrast, PPC does appear
to be necessary for visual sensorimotor decision tasks in mice (Harvey et al., 2012) and rats
(Raposo et al., 2014); though the proximity of PPC to secondary visual regions makes it difficult to
clearly isolate the effect of PPC inactivation (see discussion in Erlich et al., 2015). There are several
possibilities for the discrepancies seen in the previous studies, including differences in species, sen-
sory modality, and behavioral task. In order to further investigate the locus of sensorimotor transfor-
mation, we hoped in this study to take a more comprehensive approach toward measuring and
perturbing activity across sensory, parietal association, and motor cortical regions during a delayed-
response task.
A second unresolved issue lies in determining which region(s) are responsible for maintaining
task-relevant information in the delay period between the stimulus and response. For decades,
researchers have used delayed-response tasks to study the maintenance of information (short-term
memory), and have observed the presence of sustained neural activity in distributed cortical and sub-
cortical structures; including the prefrontal cortex (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kojima and Gold-
man-Rakic,
1982;
Funahashi
et
al.,
1989;
Miller
et
al.,
1996;
Romo
et
al.,
1999;
Sreenivasan et al., 2014), parietal cortex (Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996; Snyder et al.,
1997; Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 1998; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001; Harvey et al., 2012), sen-
sory (Nakamura and Colby, 2000; Super et al., 2001) and motor cortices (di Pellegrino and Wise,
1993; de Lafuente and Romo, 2005; Hernandez et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2013; Erlich et al., 2015;
Li
et
al.,
2015),
as
well
as
several
subcortical
regions
(Fuster
and
Alexander,
1973;
Kawagoe et al., 1998). Building on this work, theoretical studies have yielded biologically-plausible
models describing how the sustained neural activity can be generated and maintained to support
short-term memory (Compte et al., 2000; Goldman et al., 2003; Wang, 2008). However, recent
studies in rodents have indicated that some of the regions traditionally thought to be crucial for
short-term memory maintenance, such as parietal and prefrontal cortices, appear not to play a major
role in some tasks (Guo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Erlich et al., 2015), though other studies have
found an important role for sustained activity in motor regions consistent with theoretical models
(Kopec et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). Is the sustained activity observed in parietal and prefrontal cor-
tex epiphenomenal? Or might the difference stem from another aspect of the task (e.g., modality)?
We reasoned that we could help resolve this issue by measuring and perturbing activity in distrib-
uted cortical regions during a visual delayed-response task.
To leverage the genetic tractability of the mouse toward a better mechanistic understanding of
memory-guided sensorimotor decisions, we modified a visual discrimination task used for head-fixed
mice (Andermann et al., 2010) by using a retractable spout to separate the components of the task
into discrete stimulus, delay, and response epochs. We took advantage of high sensitivity geneti-
cally-encoded calcium indicators (Chen et al., 2013) to enable high-yield 2-photon volume scanning
approach (Kampa et al., 2011). This allowed us to image from large populations of neurons in sen-
sory, association and frontal motor regions during discrete epochs of a memory-guided sensorimo-
tor decision task, including stimulus encoding, delay and behavioral response.
Although measurement of neural activity is an important first step toward defining task-related
regions, the presence of neural activity does not prove that a given region plays a causal role in
mediating behavior. For example, it is possible that sustained activity seen in one region reflects sus-
tained activity in a connected region without playing a direct role in the maintenance of mnemonic
information. Microstimulation studies have revealed that activation of neurons in certain regions is
sufficient to influence task performance (Bisley et al., 2001; Hanks et al., 2006), but does not
directly address whether the region is necessary. Other studies have used surgical lesions, pharma-
cological inactivation or tissue cooling to reveal the cortical regions necessary for performance of
short-term memory maintenance in rodents and non-human primates (Fuster and Alexander, 1973;
Bauer and Fuster, 1976; Sakurai and Sugimoto, 1985; Li et al., 1999; Chafee and Goldman-Rakic,
2000; Gisquet-Verrier and Delatour, 2006; Harvey et al., 2012). However, while these studies
have been important for establishing the anatomical framework of memory maintenance, these
manipulations have limited spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, activity could not be
silenced rapidly enough to test specific epochs of the task (e.g., delay period), and it is thus unclear
whether a given manipulation affects stimulus perception, memory maintenance, or motor output.

 Recent optical inactivation approaches have revealed that the effect of cortical inactivation on
behavior is crucially dependent on timing (Sachidhanandam et al., 2013; Kopec et al., 2015;
Li et al., 2016) and whether inactivation is unilateral or bilateral (Li et al., 2016). To continue this
approach, we used an optogenetic approach for reversibly silencing activity bilaterally in defined
cortical regions with precise temporal control (Zhao et al., 2011). Using inactivation of bilateral cor-
tical regions exhibiting task-related responses, we were able to determine the necessity of sensory,
association, and frontal motor cortical regions during each epoch (stimulus, delay, response) of a
memory-guided task.
Results
Calcium imaging during a memory-guided sensorimotor decision task
We trained head-fixed mice to perform a visual discrimination task with a memory-guided response
(Figure 1A). In this task, water-restricted mice were presented a 2 s drifting grating stimulus at one
of two orientations (0˚, 90˚ from vertical), followed by a variable delay period (0-, 3-, or 6-s), at which
point a lick spout was moved rapidly into reach with a linear actuator for 1.5 s (Figure 1B, bottom).
Licking on ‘go’ trials (horizontal grating drifting toward 0˚ from vertical) was rewarded with 5–8 ml
water (hit), while licking on ‘no-go’ trials (vertical grating drifting toward 90˚ from vertical) was pun-
ished with 2 ml water containing 5 mM quinine hydrochloride (false alarm; Figure 1B, top; Video 1).
This structure allowed the separation of each trial into ‘stimulus’, “delay”, and ‘response’ epochs.
Notice that the stimulus-choice association is fixed, so correct performance does not require mem-
ory of the stimulus during the delay period (memory of the planned response is sufficient). After
extensive training (117 ± 11 behavioral sessions, 299 ± 25 trials per session; mean ± s.e.m.), mice reli-
ably exhibited strong differences in licking between go and no-go trials (Figure 1C, top) for all delay
period durations. We applied an a priori exclusion criteria that any mice licking continuously
throughout the delay period on target trials would be excluded from the study, since this strategy
would possibly obviate the short-term memory component of the task. Video analysis showed that
mice did not exhibit postural changes or increased movement during the delay period (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1; see Video 1 for representative mouse performance). Mice did exhibit a bias
toward licking (as observed previously with go/no-go tasks; O’Connor et al., 2010; Huber et al.,
2012), so we quantified their performance using d-prime rather than percent correct to account for
motivation and criterion (Carandini and Churchland, 2013) (Figure 1C, bottom). Performance
decreased slightly with longer delays, but was well above chance for all delay durations (0 s
Delay, p<10�9; 3 s Delay, p<10�9; 6 s Delay, p<10�9; t-test, n = 8 mice across 80 sessions).
We focused our experiments on three cortical regions we expected to be important for perfor-
mance of this task: (1) the primary visual cortex (V1), which is known to be important for orientation
discrimination (Glickfeld et al., 2013); (2) the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which receives exten-
sive input from visual regions (Harvey et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2014; Pho et al., 2015), projects to
motor regions (Wang et al., 2012), and has been implicated in sensorimotor decision tasks
(McNaughton et al., 1994; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001; Nitz, 2006; Gold and Shadlen, 2007;
Whitlock et al., 2008; Andersen and Cui, 2009; Raposo et al., 2014; Hanks et al., 2015) and (3)
the frontal motor cortices (fMC), which include regions known to be crucial for voluntary licking
behaviors (Komiyama et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2013).
We identified parietal cortex on the basis of stereotaxic coordinates from previous studies
(Harvey et al., 2012). Note that this region has weak visual responses and has also been classified
as a secondary visual region (AM) (Wang et al., 2012; Garrett et al., 2014). However, in addition to
visual inputs, retrograde tracing from our lab (unpublished results) and others (Harvey et al., 2012)
has revealed that the region receives input from auditory, somatosensory, secondary motor, and
frontal cortices, as well as the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus. Since the parcellation of rodent
frontal and motor cortices is a subject of debate in the field (Brecht, 2011), and both medial and lat-
eral regions have been implicated in licking (Komiyama et al., 2010) we define fMC on the basis of
stereotaxic coordinates (including primary and secondary motor regions) and remain agnostic as to
its precise homology with primate frontal and motor cortices. Nonetheless, several studies have indi-
cated that rodent fMC plays an important role in tasks involving perceptual decisions and memory
(Kepecs et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2013; Erlich et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015).

 To measure neural activity in layer 2/3 of cortex during task performance, a craniotomy was made
over one or more of regions V1, PPC and fMC (Figure 1D) after completion of training. Stereotaxi-
cally-guided microinjections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing the genetically-encoded cal-
cium indicator GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013) were made in V1 (n = 5 mice), PPC (n = 6) and/or fMC
(n = 4), and sealed cranial windows were made over V1 and PPC (Figure 1E) or fMC. To increase the
number of recorded neurons, we used a volume scanning approach (Kampa et al., 2011) that
allowed us to image four imaging planes (separated by 20–25 mm) to simultaneously sample hun-
dreds of GCaMP6s-infected neurons within an 850 mm x 850 mm x 60–75 mm volume at a sample
rate of 5 Hz (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Video 2). Images were corrected for X-Y
movement and regions of interest were assigned to cell somata based on a pixel-wise activity map
calculation, yielding fluorescence traces from individual neurons that were active during the imaging
session (26 sessions, active neurons per session: 352 ± 40, mean ± s.e.m.). A total of 9,150 active
neurons were imaged in regions V1 (n = 2,695 neurons), PPC (n = 3,552), and fMC (n = 2,903), of
which 3,049 (33.3%) exhibited trial-locked responses significantly different from baseline (see Materi-
als and methods for inclusion criteria; Figure 1G). Pilot experiments in transgenic mice expressing
tdTomato in PV+ and SOM+ interneurons revealed that interneuron calcium signals measured with
volume scanning were considerably smaller than tdTomato-negative (putatively excitatory) neurons
(Figure 1—figure supplement 3, though see Peron et al., 2015), and therefore the vast majority of
task-responsive cells were likely excitatory pyramidal neurons.
Single neurons exhibit heterogeneous trial-evoked responses
To investigate how regions V1, PPC, and fMC encode task-relevant variables, we analyzed the activ-
ity of single neurons in each region during task performance (Figure 2). The majority (63%, Figure 3,
see below for description of classification procedure) of V1 neurons with increased task-evoked activ-
ity exhibited robust and reliable responses during the stimulus epoch but not during other epochs
of the task, with similar responses across 0, 3, and 6 s delays (Figure 2A,B). However, there was also
a sizable fraction (37%) of neurons that exhibited activity during the other task epochs, particularly
during the response epoch (Figure 2C). Interestingly, there was an additional fraction (53% of
responsive neurons) of neurons that were suppressed throughout the stimulus and delay periods in a
delay duration-dependent fashion (Figure 2D). To our knowledge, neurons exhibiting delay-depen-
dent suppression have not been previously described in V1 despite their prevalence in our sample.
To ensure that the suppressed activity pattern was not an artifact of the calcium imaging technique,
we carried out single-unit electrophysiological recordings in two mice using silicon probes in V1 dur-
ing behavior and found a sizable fraction of neurons with suppressed responses during behavior (10/
21 single units; see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
Neurons in PPC were even more heterogeneous, with a large number (48% of enhanced neurons)
of neurons exhibiting activity during both stimulus and response epochs (Figure 2E,F), as well as

 (Figure 2G), as has previously been observed in
primate experiments in delayed-response tasks
(Chafee
and
Goldman-Rakic,
1998;
Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996). Finally, we
again saw neurons that exhibited suppressed
delay-dependent
activity
during
the
task
(Figure 2H), though they were much less preva-
lent compared to V1 (9% vs. 53% for PPC and V1,
respectively).
Neurons in fMC likewise exhibited heteroge-
neous responses during multiple task epochs. As
expected in motor regions, a plurality (47% of
enhanced neurons) of neurons responded solely
during the response epoch (Figure 2I). However,
a substantial fraction (33% of enhanced neurons)
of
neurons
responded
not
only
during
the
response epoch, but also in a sustained manner
throughout the delay period (Figure 2J), includ-
ing neurons that exhibited sustained activity dur-
ing the delay period of the task, and actually
showed decreased activity during the response
period (Figure 2K). Note that the sustained activ-
ity cannot be attributed to the slow decay of the
GCaMP6 indicator after the initial stimulus response, as the duration of the sustained activity varies
parametrically with the duration of the delay period. Sustained activity was also observed using a cal-
cium indicator with a faster time course (GCaMP6f, data not shown). Finally, we again observed a
subset (39% of responsive neurons) of neurons with suppressed delay-dependent activity in fMC
(Figure 2L).
To characterize the diversity of trial-evoked responses and their relative prevalence in each
region,
we
clustered
the
neurons
by
their
response characteristics. We pooled the signifi-
cant responses (enhanced and suppressed) from
all three areas, and then used PCA-based de-
noising and hierarchical clustering to delineate
distinct response types (see Materials and meth-
ods). Hierarchical clustering revealed six distinct
response types, four of them exhibiting enhanced
activity and two exhibiting suppressed activity
(Figure 3A). To reveal the archetypical response
of each group, we averaged the normalized
responses of all neurons within each cluster,
revealing four enhanced response classes: stimu-
lus-driven
(Stim
only),
response-driven
(Resp
only), stimulus- and response-driven (Stim+Resp),
and delay-driven (Delay), as well as two sup-
pressed response classes: delay-sensitive stimu-
lus-driven (Supp. Delay early) and delay-sensitive
response-driven (Supp. Delay late; Figure 3B).
These clusters have strong face validity, as the
average responses (Figure 3B) are qualitatively
similar to observed single-neuron responses (Fig-
ure

response epoch were predominantly selective for
‘go’ trials, there were response-driven neurons
that were selective for ‘no-go’ trials as well

 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1–3, plots with preferred responses to non-target, ‘N’, stimulus), sug-
gesting that the response-driven activity is not entirely related to motor activity. There were clear
differences in both enhanced and suppressed response types between regions, such as V1 contain-
ing a large number of ‘Stim only’ and ‘Supp. Delay early’ neurons, while fMC had greater numbers
of ‘Delay’, ‘Resp only’, and ‘Supp. Delay late’ neurons (Figure 3C). However, there was a surprising
amount of heterogeneity as well, with all three regions containing a fraction of almost all response
types.
Suppressed neurons exhibit non-selective responses
We next investigated what role neurons exhibiting suppressed activity (975/3049 neurons, 32.0%;
Figure 2D,H,L) play in encoding task-relevant information. We found that the enhanced and sup-
pressed neurons across regions exhibited striking differences in selectivity. The vast majority of
enhanced neurons showed a strong preference for a particular trial type (hit vs. correct reject, only
correct trials included in analysis), with little or no response to the non-preferred trial type
(Figure 4A). However, the majority of suppressed neurons showed very similar responses to both
trial types, with little difference between ‘preferred’ and ‘non-preferred’ trial types (Figure 4B). We
used a selectivity index ranging from 0 (responds equally to preferred and non-preferred stimuli) to
1 (only responds to preferred stimuli) to quantify the selectivity of each neuron (see Materials and
methods), revealing that enhanced neurons were significantly more selective than suppressed neu-
rons in all three regions (Figure 4C; V1: Enh. median SI = 0.67, Supp. median SI = 0.16, p<10–9;
PPC: Enh. median SI = 0.91, Supp. median SI = 0.31, p<10–9; fMC: Enh. median SI = 0.99, Supp.
median SI = 0.53, p<10–9; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
One possibility for the presence of the suppressed responses is that local inhibition is being
recruited by the increased activity of the enhanced neurons during task performance. If this were the
case, we would expect that the time course of the suppressed responses would closely follow that of
the enhanced responses. We estimated the response latency of the suppressed neurons, and found
that the latencies were slow (>400 ms) and uncorrelated to the enhanced population latency in the
cortical region (Figure 4D). We also found that suppressed neurons exhibited a suppression
throughout the delay period (in a duration-dependent manner; Figure 2D,H,L), even when this pat-
tern was not present in the enhanced neurons of the same region (Figure 4E). Taken together, these
findings suggest that the suppressed responses are not simply reflecting inhibition from local excit-
atory responses, but rather are the result of more complex dynamics; possibly low-latency, delay-
dependent inputs from distal regions.
Enhanced neurons show regional differences despite local
heterogeneity
The lack of trial type selectivity observed in suppressed neurons indicates that there will be little
information about stimulus identity or future motor response in the activity of these neurons. How-
ever, the enhanced neurons are highly selective, and likely represent these task-relevant variables in
a more robust manner. To further investigate the role of enhanced neurons in different cortical

 regions, we investigated the population responses within regions by pooling the neurons across
imaging sessions from different animals.
To investigate the encoding of task variables at the population level, we averaged and normalized
the preferred responses of enhanced task-driven neurons across all correct trials of equivalent delay
(hit or correct reject, depending on preferred response) and sorted them first by cortical region, and
then by latency to peak response (Figure 5A; suppressed neuron responses shown in Figure 5—fig-
ure supplement 1). While V1 neurons preferred go and no-go trials in roughly equal numbers, we
found that PPC and fMC neurons were highly biased toward the go trials (Figure 5B). Since the tar-
get and non-target stimuli have similar visual saliency, this suggests that these regions may encode
task-related variables other than stimulus identity. Indeed, although the responses within regions
were heterogeneous (Figure 3), there were clear differences in the average responses between
regions (Figure 5C). Specifically, V1 neurons were predominantly active during the stimulus epoch,
while PPC and fMC exhibited more heterogeneous responses spanning stimulus, delay, and
response epochs. Although sustained delay-period activity could be observed across all cortical
regions, it was most prevalent in fMC, both in single-unit (Figure 3C) and population (Figure 5C)
activity. Finally, there were considerable differences in latency to significant response, with the first
mode of the latency distribution increasing from V1 to PPC to fMC for all delay durations (V1: 89 ±
10 ms, PPC: 244 ± 15 ms, fMC: 827 ± 177 ms, mean across delays; regions all significantly different,
V1 x PPC: p<10�9, V1 x fMC: p<10�9, PPC x fMC: p<10�9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 5D).
Population error-trial analysis reveals distinct encoding dynamics in
each region
To further investigate how neural activity might reflect the encoding of the stimulus identity and
behavioral choice (including planning of the response before it is made), we analyzed the modulation
of responses in all regions during error trials. We hypothesized that if neurons were simply encoding
stimulus identity, there would be no difference in activity during correct trials and error trials contain-
ing the same visual stimulus (i.e., hit vs. miss; correct reject vs. false alarm). Indeed, V1 neurons
exhibit similar responses to correct and error trials with the same stimulus, while neurons in PPC and
fMC show very different responses on the two trial types (Figure 6A, left and middle panels corre-
sponding to miss vs. hit trials; Pearson correlation between miss and hit trials, V1: 0.47 ± 0.03, PPC:
0.05 ± 0.01, fMC: 0.06 ± 0.02). Similarly, we hypothesized that if neurons encoded the animal’s
behavioral choice independently of the stimulus shown, we would expect there to be little difference
between correct trials and error trials with the same motor response (i.e., hit vs. false alarm; correct
reject vs. miss). Neuronal responses in PPC and fMC appear to exhibit more similarity than V1 for
trial types with the same motor response (Figure 6A, middle and right panels corresponding to hit
vs. false alarm trials; Pearson correlation between hit and false alarm trials, V1: 0.23 ± 0.03, PPC:
0.47 ± 0.01, fMC: 0.46 ± 0.02).

 To quantify the encoding of task variables as a function of time in each region, we used an ideal
observer analysis to determine how well we could decode the stimulus identity independent of the
behavioral choice (Figure 6B) and behavioral choice independent of stimulus identity (Figure 6C)
using only the responses from randomly selected populations of neurons (ranging from population
size of 1 to 100, see Materials and methods for details of decoding procedure). In V1, stimulus iden-
tity could be decoded with perfect accuracy given a sufficient number of neurons (Figure 6B, left),
while behavioral choice was only weakly encoded (Figure 6C, left). The stimulus identity encoding
peaked during the visual stimulus and then gradually declined throughout the trial (statistically signif-
icant from baseline from 0.2–9.2 s, mean value greater than 95% CI of shuffled permutations for con-
secutive time points, see Materials and methods), likely due to the slow decay of the GCaMP6s
indicator, while the behavioral choice encoding gradually increased, peaking during the response

 period (statistically significant from 4.8 to 6.8 s and from 8.4 to 10.0 s; Figure 6D, left). Note that in
all three regions, the increase in stimulus identity encoding during the response epoch is likely the
byproduct of reward or punishment (which is directly associated with the stimulus identity) influenc-
ing motor activity. In PPC, both stimulus identity and behavioral choice could be decoded with mod-
erate success (Figure 6B,C, middle), although the dynamics were noticeably different. Specifically,
while the stimulus identity was predominantly encoded early in the trial (statistically significant from
0.6–3.4 s and 7.2–10.0 s), the behavioral choice encoding slightly lagged the stimulus identity
encoding, and remained high throughout the trial, peaking during the early part of the licking
response (statistically significant from 1.4–10.0 s; Figure 6D, middle). Note that the stimulus encod-
ing is much weaker in PPC than in V1, likely due to the large number of neurons that jointly-encode
stimulus and choice information (Park et al., 2014; Raposo et al., 2014; Pho et al., 2015). Finally, in
fMC the stimulus identity could not be decoded above chance for the majority of the trial

 (Figure 6B, right), while the behavioral choice could be decoded with greater accuracy in fMC than
in other regions (Figure 6C, right). Thus, while stimulus identity decoding was only above chance
during the response epoch (statistically significant from 8.8–9.4 s, see caveat on stimulus identity
encoding during response epoch above), the behavioral choice could be decoded throughout the
delay and response epochs (statistically significant from 3.0–10.0 s; Figure 6D, right).
Although calculating the auROC is an easily interpretable measure of information encoding, it is
also a noisy measure and may be obscuring dynamics at a finer timescale. As a second approach to
investigating the encoding dynamics of neural populations in different regions, we used targeted
dimensionality reduction to re-map the high dimensional neural space into a lower dimensional sub-
space in which the axes correspond to task-relevant variables (Mante et al., 2013). This was accom-
plished by first using principal component analysis to reduce the high-dimensional neural space in
each region to a lower-dimensional ‘de-noised’ subspace, then using linear regression to define
orthogonal axes for ‘stimulus’ and ‘choice’ from the principal components (see Materials and meth-
ods). By measuring the difference in ‘hit’ and ‘correct reject’ trajectories along the ‘stimulus’ and
‘choice’ axes, we found once again that V1 principally encodes the stimulus identity (Figure 7A,D),
PPC encodes a mixture of stimulus identity and behavioral choice (Figure 7B,E), and fMC predomi-
nantly encodes the behavioral choice throughout the stimulus, delay, and response epochs
(Figure 7C,F). Although there are slight differences between the results of the ideal observer and
targeted dimensional reduction approaches, they reveal similar overall encoding dynamics in each
region. Carrying out the same analysis with the populations of suppressed neurons in each region
(Figure 5—figure supplement 1) revealed that there was little coding of task-relevant variables,
with the exception of a small amount of behavioral choice encoding in fMC (data not shown).
Taken together, these results suggest a working hypothesis of the roles that neural activity in
regions V1, PPC, and fMC play in the performance of the task. Specifically, the results suggest that
sensory input is primarily processed during the stimulus epoch, first in V1, then subsequently in PPC.
Neural activity related to the behavioral choice arises in PPC and fMC shortly after the peak in stimu-
lus identity coding, and is sustained in both regions throughout the delay and response epochs. This
implies that stimulus identity is rapidly transformed into a behavioral choice within the stimulus
epoch (possibly within PPC), and then the behavioral choice is maintained in higher regions (poten-
tially in both PPC and fMC) until the relevant motor action is performed (Figure 7—figure supple-
ment 1).
Photoinhibition of specific cortical regions
Although trial-locked neural activity provides insight into which cortical regions may contribute to
behavioral performance during different epochs of the task, it is important to note that the presence
of neural activity in a region does not demonstrate a functional role in task performance. To directly
test the plausibility of our working hypothesis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), we next used an
optogenetic inactivation approach to directly test the necessity of spatially defined cortical regions
during specific epochs of the task. To inactivate the cortical regions of interest, we utilized the
VGAT-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mouse line (Zhao et al., 2011) to rapidly and reversibly inhibit neural
activity. The VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice express the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin
(ChR2) in all cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes, and thus stimulation of cortex with 473 nm light
effectively silences the activity of nearby pyramidal cells (Zhao et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013). To
characterize the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition, we performed cell-attached recordings from reg-
ular-spiking neurons in L2/3 and L5 of region V1 (Figure 8A). We found that laser stimulation (2 s
continuous pulses, 6.5 mW mm�2) potently inhibited the activity of regular spiking neurons (see
example L5 neuron, Figure 8B), completely eliminating spikes during the laser stimulation period in
all recorded neurons, even during presentation of a drifting grating stimulus of the preferred

 orientation (grating presented from 1 s before laser stimulation to 1 s after laser stimulation;
Figure 8B, inset, n = 2 mice). To characterize the spatial extent of photoinhibition, we performed
immunohistochemistry using c-Fos as a marker of neural activity (Figure 8C). Naı
¨ve VGAT-ChR2-
EYFP and control mice were implanted with windows and periodically illuminated with 2 s continuous
pulses of 473 nm light (6.5 mW mm�2). We found that after light exposure, VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice
(but not wild-type controls) showed dramatically reduced expression of c-Fos throughout all layers
of the cortex underlying our cranial window (Figure 8D,E, n = 3 mice). The suppression was confined
to within 500 mm laterally from the edge of the window, and did not spread past the white matter
into subcortical regions. Similar results were achieved using an Arc antibody (n = 2 mice).
Using a simplified version of the task without a delay period, we confirmed that bilateral inactiva-
tion of V1 during the stimulus epoch impaired performance of VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice (p=0.002),
but not wild-type controls exposed to the same light stimulation (Dd’ = +0.14, p=0.27; Figure 8—
figure supplement 1A–C). In some neurons, we noticed that it took a few hundred milliseconds for
the spike rate to recover to baseline (e.g., neuron in Figure 8B). To ensure that inactivation did not
have long-lasting effects on the inactivated cortical regions, we inactivated region V1 for 2 s prior to
the stimulus onset, and found no effect on performance (Dd’ = �0.15, p=0.51); Figure 8—figure
supplement 1D–F).
After training VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice on the task, we implanted bilateral glass cranial windows
above V1 (n = 4 mice), PPC (n = 4), or fMC (n = 4; Figure 9B). We tested the necessity of each
region during each of the three task epochs (stimulus, delay, response) with high temporal specificity
(Figure 9A) by randomly interleaving ‘laser ON’ and ‘laser OFF’ trials in the same behavioral session.
Photoinhibition of all three regions was capable of disrupting the performance of the task, causing
performance to drop to chance levels. However, the specific task epochs during which laser stimula-
tion disrupted behavior differed for each brain region (Figure 9C).
As expected, V1 (Figure 9C,D, top row) was necessary during the stimulus epoch, with laser stim-
ulation dramatically reducing the animal’s ability to perform the task (stimulus: d’OFF = 1.51 ± 0.11,
d’ON: 0.21 ± 0.11, p<10�3). However, inactivation of V1 during the delay or response epochs had no
effect (delay: Dd’ = 0.47, p=0.41, response: Dd’ = 0.23, p=1.0). Activity in PPC (Figure 9C,D; middle
row) was also necessary during the stimulus epoch (stimulus: d’OFF = 1.81 ± 0.16, d’ON: 0.27 ± 0.12,
p<10�3). However, despite the high level of activity in many PPC neurons during the delay and
response periods (Figure 5C; Figure 3—figure supplement 2), inactivation of PPC during these
periods had no effect on behavior (delay: Dd’ = 0.03, p=1.0, response: Dd’ = 0.24, p=0.79). By con-
trast, suppression of fMC (Figure 9C and D; bottom row) during any of the three trial epochs
completely abolished performance in the task (stimulus: d’OFF = 1.37 ± 0.10, d’ON: �0.05 ± 0.13,
p<10�4; delay: d’OFF = 1.60 ± 0.10, d’ON: 0.32 ± 0.23, p<10�4; response: d’OFF = 1.60 ± 0.17, d’ON: -
0.06 ± 0.05, p<10�3; paired t-test with Bonferroni correction used for all behavioral statistical tests).

 One concern is that suppression of fMC could have disrupted performance in a trivial manner by
preventing the execution of motor commands. This was indeed observed for inactivation of fMC dur-
ing the response period, as licking behavior was abolished during laser ON trials (Figure 9D, bottom
right). However, prevention of motor function cannot explain decreased performance during stimu-
lus or delay epoch inactivation, as light stimulation affected performance without decreasing lick
rate (Figure 9D, bottom left & middle). The lick rate recovery after stimulus/delay epoch

 photoinhibition is somewhat puzzling given that the vast majority of the neurons in fMC are selective
for Hit trials (Figure 5B). In future experiments, it would be useful to image fMC activity after
removal of photoinhibition to determine if the activity defaults to a ‘go’ activity pattern after
recovery.
Another concern is that the visual stimulus duration (2 s) is likely longer than necessary to perform
the discrimination, meaning that the stimulus epoch could act as a mixed stimulus/delay epoch. To
test this possibility, we trained mice on a similar task with a shortened stimulus duration of 250 ms
(Figure 9—figure supplement 1A; performance declined to chance levels with shorter stimulus
durations, data not shown). Stimulus period photoinhibition continues to disrupt behavioral perfor-
mance for all three regions (Figure 9—figure supplement 1B), similar to the longer duration stimu-
lus epochs (Figure 9C). Note that recovery of activity after photoinhibition can take several hundred

 milliseconds (Figure 8B; t = 416 ± 91 ms), so the results should be interpreted with caution. How-
ever, these data do demonstrate that fMC is necessary either during or very shortly after the visual
stimulus is shown, highlighting the rapid conversion of sensory into motor information across cortical
regions.
Our results thus show that all three regions are necessary during the stimulus epoch of the task.
This is in line with our imaging results (Figure 5) and population analyses (Figure 6, Figure 7) in
showing that task-relevant information reaches frontal motor regions relatively rapidly after stimulus
presentation, and suggests that PPC may be involved with converting stimulus identity representa-
tions into behavioral choice representations early in the task (during the stimulus epoch), while fMC
is necessary for maintaining and executing the behavioral choice (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).
Surprisingly, although there was robust task-related activity in PPC during the delay and response
epochs, photoinhibition of PPC during these epochs had no impact on the performance of the mem-
ory-guided task. Only fMC was necessary during the delay and response epochs of the task, showing
that fMC can act independently of V1 and PPC once the stimulus epoch processing is complete.
Discussion
Understanding the circuits underlying the conversion of sensory input into motor action is a major
goal of neuroscience research (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Andersen and Cui, 2009; Romo and de
Lafuente, 2013). By measuring and manipulating the activity of neurons in multiple cortical regions
during
a

task,

has
made
the
following
contributions.
First, large-scale 2-photon calcium imaging revealed that despite differences in single-unit activity
between regions, the responses within a region were surprisingly heterogeneous, with a representa-
tion of all classified response types in all regions (Figure 3). For example, in V1 we observed many
neurons that were active during the response epoch in addition to the expected neurons active dur-
ing the stimulus period, and vice versa in the frontal motor cortices. This study also shows, for the
first time in mice, that a fraction of neurons (mostly in PPC and fMC) exhibit sustained activity that
varies parametrically with delay duration, in line with earlier work from non-human primates
(Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982; Funahashi et al., 1989).
One difference between our study and many previous delayed-response studies was the use of a
go/no-go design rather than an alternative choice design. Although we used this design primarily for
practical reasons (to reduce training time), we found interesting biases in the cortical responses
resulting from the response asymmetry (Figure 5B). In particular, while V1 exhibited a moderate
bias toward Hit trials (65.3% target-preferring), PPC and fMC exhibited much stronger biases toward
Hit trials (95.5% and 97.2% target-selective, respectively), although there was a small fraction of neu-
rons that showed robust responses selective for CR trials (Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3). Given
that the false alarm rate exceeded the miss rate at all delays, it is surprising that there is not more
activity reflecting the suppression of licking on non-target trials. In future studies, it would be inter-
esting to probe other regions involved in motor and cognitive control, such as striatum and prefron-
tal cortex, to see if there are signals corresponding to the suppression of licking during correct
reject trials.
The sustained delay-period activity we observed contrasts with several recent studies in which
neurons recorded in parietal and prefrontal cortices exhibited sequential neural activity (Baeg et al.,
2003; Fujisawa et al., 2008; Harvey et al., 2012). It has been unclear whether the different modes
of neural activity (steady-state vs. sequential) observed during short-term memory depend on the
behavioral task, or whether the sequential activity had simply been obscured by lower-throughput
methods of collecting and analyzing the data. Using volumetric calcium imaging to sample large
populations of neurons, we found evidence in our task for steady-state representation of motor
choice, with the vast majority of delay-sensitive neurons becoming active early in the trial and exhib-
iting persistent or ramping activity throughout the delay period (Figure 2G,J,K; Figure 3—figure
supplements 1–3). We suspect that the nature of the mnemonic information in the behavioral task
has a strong bearing on the mode of activity observed. In tasks where neurons exhibit steady-state
activity, such as our study and others (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kojima and Goldman-Rakic,
1982; Funahashi et al., 1989; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001), the encoded motor plan is held con-
stant throughout the delay period (e.g., lick when the spout comes forward; make a saccade to a

 fixed location). In contrast, in tasks where neurons exhibit sequential activity (Baeg et al., 2003;
Fujisawa et al., 2008; Harvey et al., 2012) the encoded motor plan may vary as a function of the
trial as the animal navigates through real or virtual space. Both types of memory are important for
understanding complex behavior, and warrant further study of the underlying neural architecture.
A second contribution is the finding that a sizable fraction of the significantly responding neurons
(32.0% of all significantly-responding neurons) exhibited suppressed rather than enhanced responses
during task performance (Figure 2, Figure 3). However, these neurons were generally much less
selective than enhanced neurons (particularly in V1 and PPC), and as a result appear to play little
role in encoding task-relevant variables (Figure 4). Without a method for specifically manipulating
the activity of the suppressed neurons, it is difficult to unambiguously discern what role they may
play in task performance. One possibility is that suppression of spontaneously active neurons may
reduce any ongoing task-irrelevant activity, and thereby improve the readout of task-relevant popu-
lation activity by higher-order neurons.
Third, we found that despite the heterogeneity observed in the single-unit activity, when the pop-
ulations of neurons within each region are analyzed as a whole, they exhibit distinct coding dynamics
of task-relevant variables (Figure 6, Figure 7). Specifically, the V1 population predominantly enco-
des the stimulus identity, particularly early in the trial. Similar to previous research in non-human pri-
mates (Park et al., 2014) and rodents (Raposo et al., 2014), we find multiplexed encoding of
stimulus identity and behavioral choice in PPC. However, we find that the dynamics of the stimulus
identity and behavioral choice encoding in PPC are distinct, with choice encoding lagging slightly,
and lasting throughout the delay period. The fMC predominantly encodes behavioral choice, begin-
ning early in the trial and lasting throughout the delay period until after the motor response is made,
in accord with choice-related activity observed in premotor regions in earlier rodent (Erlich et al.,
2011; Guo et al., 2013, Li et al., 2015) and non-human primate studies (Hernandez et al., 2010).
Fourth, we find that PPC is necessary for performance during the stimulus epoch of the task (Fig-
ure 9), in contrast to several recent pharmacological and optogenetic perturbation studies in
rodents (Guo et al., 2013; Erlich et al., 2015), which found that inactivation of PPC had no effect on
behavioral performance in sensorimotor decision tasks. Why does PPC appear to play a critical role
in some tasks but not in others? One possibility is that PPC plays a greater role for some sensory
modalities than others during sensorimotor decision tasks, perhaps due to differences in anatomy (e.
g., S1 directly projects to motor regions while V1 input reaches motor cortex only indirectly, with
PPC as the principal cortical intermediary; Wang et al., 2012). Indeed, a recent study found that
pharmacological inhibition of PPC somewhat impaired performance of a rate discrimination task for
visual stimuli, but did not affect performance when auditory stimuli were used (Raposo et al., 2014).
Another intriguing possibility is that PPC plays a greater role for sensorimotor tasks in which higher-
level features (e.g., orientation) must be mapped to motor actions; in contrast to tasks involving
detection of simple stimuli, which may be mediated by subcortical or direct sensory cortex to motor
cortex projections. This could be tested directly by investigating the necessity of PPC in tasks that
differ in the complexity of the discriminated feature while the rest of the task structure is kept
constant.
Finally, this study is in accord with several recent rodent studies in finding that fMC, but not PPC,

during

period
(Hernandez et al., 2010; Erlich et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015). Indeed, while photo-
inhibition of fMC during the delay period results in complete disruption of behavioral performance,
photoinhibition of PPC during the delay period has no significant effect (Figure 9). This suggests
that, at least in motor planning tasks, PPC is likely more important for mapping stimulus identity to
behavioral choice than for maintaining the choice in short-term memory stores. A separate study
from our lab using a zero-delay version of the task revealed a large number of spatially-intermixed
neurons in PPC (but not V1) encode the response choice in addition to the stimulus, and will actually
switch selectivity if the target and non-target stimuli are switched (Pho et al., 2015). However, addi-
tional research will be necessary to determine if the PPC is indeed the locus for stimulus-response
mapping in these tasks. Another intriguing finding is that the dependency on fMC arises quite early
in the task (Figure 9), within hundreds of milliseconds from stimulus onset (Figure 9—figure supple-
ment 1). This result appears to conflict with earlier findings using unilateral inactivation of motor cor-
tex (Guo et al., 2013; Hanks et al., 2015), but is consistent with a recent study finding that delay-
period motor cortical activity can be recovered if the contralateral hemisphere is spared (Li et al.,
Goard et al. eLife 2016;5:e13764. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.13764

 2016). The early dependency on fMC activity suggests a very rapid conversion of stimulus informa-
tion into a motor plan.
An important next step is to determine the role of V1, PPC, and fMC in a task that requires mem-
ory of the stimulus, such as a delayed match-to-sample task (Miller et al., 1996; Romo et al., 1999;
Liu et al., 2014). It seems probable that in such tasks, PPC or perhaps even primary sensory cortex
would play a greater role during delay-period maintenance. Given the importance of both sensory
and motor short-term memory, both delayed-response and delayed-comparison tasks warrant fur-
ther study.
A few caveats are important to note in the interpretation of this study. First, some care must be
taken in the interpretation of inactivation experiments, both in our study and previous studies
(Guo et al., 2013; Erlich et al., 2015; Raposo et al., 2014). It should be noted that if optogenetic
or pharmacological inhibition in a given area impairs performance, it does not prove that local proc-
essing in the inactivated region is playing a crucial role. Instead, it could be that the impairment is
mediated by feedback projections from the inhibited region to other parts of the cortex or subcorti-
cal structures. For example, the behavior deficit seen during stimulus epoch photoinhibition of PPC
or fMC could be due to a lack feedback from fMC to visual, parietal, or other (sub)cortical regions,
perhaps disrupting network homeostasis (Otchy et al., 2015). This is particularly a worry when trying
to assess the independent role of highly interconnected and/or adjacent cortical regions (e.g., visual
and parietal cortices). In future studies, simultaneous imaging and inactivation will help ensure that
optical perturbations are restricted to the desired region.
Second, one persistent issue in delayed-response tasks (in which the correct response is evident
early in the trial) is that the subject could adapt a behavioral strategy in which they make a micropos-
tural preparation (e.g., movement of the eyes, changes in body orientation or tongue position) to
stand in for the eventual motor action. This in turn may preclude the necessity for actively maintain-
ing a motor plan throughout the delay period. This problem has been recognized for some time
(Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982), but it remains challenging to control for the wide range of
potential covert movements. Disentangling the effects of covert preparations on premotor and
motor activity will be an important step in understanding the neural basis of motor planning.
Finally, this study focused on cortical regions located on the dorsal surface of the mouse brain, as
they are readily accessible to both 2-photon calcium imaging and optogenetic inhibition. However,
there are likely to be additional cortical and subcortical regions involved in this task, including pre-
frontal cortex (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982; Funahashi et al.,
1989), thalamus (Fuster and Alexander, 1973), superior colliculus (Kopec et al., 2015), and basal
ganglia (Kawagoe et al., 1998; Ding and Gold, 2012). These regions could be further investigated
with a similar approach as invasive (Barretto and Schnitzer, 2012; Zorzos et al., 2012;
Andermann et al., 2013) and noninvasive (Filonov et al., 2011; Mittmann et al., 2011;
Prakash et al., 2012) techniques for optical interrogation of deeper structures become available.
Materials and methods
Surgical procedures
All procedures were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Animal Care and Use
Committee. Data were collected from male adult (60–120 day old) wild-type (RRID:IMSR_JAX:
000664; n = 12) and VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice (RRID:IMSR_JAX:014548; n = 15). The animals were
housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle in cages of up to 5 animals before the implants, and individually
after the implants. All surgeries were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia (3.5% induction, 1.5–
2.5% maintenance). Meloxicam (1 mg kg-1, subcutaneous) was administered pre-operatively and
every 24 hr for 3 days to reduce inflammation. Once anesthetized, the scalp overlying the dorsal
skull was sanitized and removed. The periosteum was removed with a scalpel and the skull was
abraded with a drill burr to improve adhesion of dental acrylic. Stereotaxic coordinates for future
viral injections were marked with a non-toxic ink and covered with a layer of silicon elastomer (Kwik-
Sil, World Precision Instruments) to prevent acrylic bonding. The entire skull surface was then cov-
ered with dental acrylic (C&B-Metabond, Parkell) mixed with black ink to reduce light transmission.
A custom-designed stainless steel head plate (eMachineShop.com) was then affixed using dental

 acrylic. After head plate implantation, mice recovered for at least five days before beginning water
restriction.
After behavioral training was complete, animals were taken off water restriction for five days
before undergoing a second surgery to implant the imaging/photoinhibition window(s). Procedures
for anesthetic administration and post-operative care were identical to the first surgery. The dental
acrylic and silicon elastomer covering the targeted region were removed using a drill burr. The skull
surface was then cleaned and a craniotomy (2–4 mm, depending on targeted structure) was made
over the region of interest, leaving the dura intact. For imaging experiments, neurons were labeled
with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator by microinjection (Stoelting) of 50 nl AAV2/1.Syn.
GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core; diluted to a titer of 1012 genomes
ml�1) 300 mm below the pial surface. Between two and five injections were made in each exposed
region, centered at V1 (4.2 mm posterior, 2.5 mm lateral to Bregma), PPC (2 mm posterior, 1.7 mm
lateral to Bregma) or fMC (1.5 mm anterior, 1 mm lateral to Bregma). Since the viral expression
spreads laterally from the injection site, exact stereotaxic locations were photographed through the
surgical microscope for determining imaging areas. For photoinhibition experiments, craniotomies
were made bilaterally, with no virus injection. Finally, a cranial window was implanted over the crani-
otomy and sealed first with silicon elastomer then with dental acrylic. The cranial windows were
made of two rounded pieces of coverglass (Warner Instruments) bonded with optical glue (NOA 61,
Norland). The bottom piece was circular or oval, custom cut according to cortical region(s) (V1:
2.5 � 2.5 mm; PPC: 1 � 2 mm; V1 + PPC: 4 � 4 mm; fMC: 2 � 2.5 mm, anterior-posterior x medial-
lateral) and fit snugly in the craniotomy. The top piece was a larger circular coverglass (3–5 mm,
depending on size of bottom piece) and was bonded to the skull using dental acrylic. Mice recov-
ered for five days before commencing water restriction.
Behavior
Mice were head-fixed using optical hardware (Thorlabs) and placed in a polypropylene tube to limit
movement. Spout position was controlled by mounting the spout apparatus on a pressure-driven
sliding linear actuator (Festo) controlled by two solenoids (Parker). Licks were detected using an
infrared emitter/receiver pair (Digikey) mounted on either side of the retractable lick spout. Rewards
consisted of 5–8 ml water and punishments consisted of a white noise auditory stimulus alone (early
training) or white noise plus 1–3 ml of 5 mM quinine hydrochloride (Sigma) in water (late training).
Behavioral training and testing was implemented with custom software written in Matlab (Math-
works). Drifting grating stimuli were presented with the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997).
Mice were trained during the light cycle. The stimulus consisted of sine wave gratings (spatial fre-
quency: 0.05 cycles deg�1; temporal frequency: 2 Hz) drifting at either 0 degrees (target) or 90
degrees (non-target) away from vertical. These stimuli were chosen to drive distinct groups of visual
neurons with roughly equal strength (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Thus, any large differences in
stimulus selectivity observed in cortical neurons are not likely the result of stimulus strength.
Mice were trained in successive stages, with advancement to the next stage contingent on correct
performance: 1) Mice received reward any time they licked the spout. 2) Trial structure was initiated
by having an auditory cue tone, followed by a visual stimulus (100% targets), followed by an inter-
trial interval. Mice were only rewarded for licks during the visual stimulus. 3) Once mice exhibited
preferential licking during the stimulus compared to inter-trial interval, the target rate was reduced
over several sessions from 100% to 50%. At this point, the non-target was a static grating orientated
orthogonally to the target. Licks during non-targets were punished with white noise or white noise
plus quinine. 4) Once mice exhibited the ability to discriminate target and non-target gratings (d’ >
1 and RHIT - RFA > 30% for consecutive sessions, where RHIT and RFA are the hit and false alarm rate,
respectively), the temporal frequency of the non-target grating was increased. 5) Spout withdrawal
was introduced. At first the spout was extended within range before the stimulus appeared, then
spout extend time was gradually delayed until after the stimulus had turned off (i.e., 0 s delay). 6)
Finally, the variable delay period was gradually increased to 0/3/6 s (imaging mice) or 0/2/4 s (pho-
toinhibition mice). Mice that failed to fully learn the task within 150 sessions or showed signs of infec-
tion were removed from the study. In total, we removed 11 mice from the study before data
collection was complete: 3 mice for failure to consistently lick the spout for reward (stage 1), 3 mice
for failure to progress during the visual discrimination phase (stage 3), 1 mouse for failure to

 progress at the variable delay stage (stage 6), 1 mouse that showed signs of infection, and 4 mice
that completed behavioral training but either had poor viral expression or cloudy windows after
surgery.
Once mice reached high levels of performance at the final stage of the task (d’ > 1.5 and RHIT -
RFA > 50%), they were removed from water restriction for window implantation. After recovery from
window implantation surgery, they were re-trained to a level of high performance (2–7 days) before
beginning experimental sessions. For both imaging and photoinhibition experiments, any sessions
with poor performance were discarded (minimum performance criterion: d’ > 1 and RHIT - RFA >
30%). For photoinhibition experiments, the performance criterion was applied to the control
condition.
For analysis of movement during the delay period (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), cropped
video frames (300 � 200 pixels; width x height) from Hit and CR trials were compared to a ‘template’
CR image to measure postural changes or changes (increases or decreases) in movement during
each epoch of the task (Pre-stimulus, Delay, Response). Since some amount of movement is
expected in all conditions, a pixel-wise map of the absolute difference between single CR frames
and the CR template within-condition (DCR) was calculated as a measure of baseline movement:
DCR x;y
ð
Þ ¼ jCRf x;y
ð
Þ � CRF6¼f x;y
ð
Þj
Where f is the index of a single CR frame and F6¼f is the set of all CR frames except f, and where x
and y are pixel indices. The absolute difference map was calculated separately for each epoch (Pre-
stimulus, Delay, Response). A pixel-wise map of the absolute difference between single Hit frames
and the CR template (DHit) was calculated in the same manner:
DHit x;y
ð
Þ ¼ jHitf x;y
ð
Þ � CRF6¼f x;y
ð
Þj
In cases where the number of Hit frames exceeded the number of CR frames, the excluded frame
was chosen at random from the CR frames. Finally, the difference in movement on Hit trials relative
to CR trials (DSub) was calculated by taking the absolute value of the subtracted difference maps
(Figure 1—figure supplement 1B):
DSub x;y
ð
Þ ¼ jDHit x;y
ð
Þ � DCR x;y
ð
Þj
Note that since the frames are compared against a CR template, this approach will capture not only
transient movement but also stable postural changes specific to Hit trials. To compare between ses-
sions, the subtracted difference maps (DSub) were averaged across all pixels for each epoch (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1C).
2-Photon imaging
GCaMP6s fluorescence was imaged 14–35 days after virus injection using Prairie Ultima IV 2-photon
microscopy system with a resonant galvo scanning module (Bruker). For fluorescence excitation, we
used a Ti-Sapphire laser (Mai-Tai eHP, Newport) with dispersion compensation (Deep See, Newport)
tuned to l = 910 nm. For collection, we used GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu). To achieve
a wide field of view, we used a 16x/0.8 NA microscope objective (Nikon), which was mounted on a
Z-piezo (Bruker) for volume scanning. Resonant scanning was synchronized to z-piezo steps in the
acquisition software for volume scanning. For volume scanning, four 441 � 512 pixel imaging planes
separated by 20 or 25 mm were imaged sequentially at a stack rate of 5 Hz for 10 min imaging ses-
sions. Occasionally, very bright neurons were visible across multiple planes. To exclude redundant
sampling of the same neuron, the Pearson correlation coefficients of the fluorescence traces of all
pairs of neurons within a recording were calculated. Neuron pairs with a correlation coefficient >
0.5, and an inter-ROI distance <12.5 mm in the XY plane were considered to be redundant and the
ROI with the lower average fluorescence signal (more likely out of plane) was removed. Even with
virus titer dilution, a small number of nucleus-filled neurons were observed in most experiments
(Chen et al., 2013), but they comprised a small percentage of neurons and generally did not exhibit
significant task-driven responses (Harvey et al., 2012). Laser power ranged from 40–75 mW at the
sample depending on GCaMP6s expression levels. Photobleaching was minimal (<1% min�1) for all
laser powers used. A custom stainless steel plate (eMachineShop.com) attached to a black curtain

 was mounted to the head plate before imaging to prevent light from the visual stimulus monitor
from reaching the PMTs. During imaging experiments, the polypropylene tube supporting the
mouse was suspended from the behavior platform with high tension springs (Small Parts) to dampen
the movement.
Image analysis
Images were acquired using PrairieView acquisition software and sorted into multi-page TIF files. All
subsequent analyses were performed in MATLAB (Mathworks). First, images were corrected for X-Y
movement by registration to a reference image (the pixel-wise mean of all frames) using 2-dimen-
sional cross correlation. Movements in the Z-dimension were rare in normal imaging conditions,
although movements were sometimes observed during licking. In order to prevent licking-related
artifacts from being identified as significant responses, we adapted our response significance test to
exclude short-duration changes in fluorescence (see Analysis of task-driven responses section).
To identify responsive neural somata, a pixel-wise activity map was calculated as previously
described (Ahrens et al., 2012). Neuron cell bodies were identified using local adaptive threshold
and iterative segmentation. Automatically-defined ROIs were then manually checked for proper seg-
mentation in a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (allowing comparison to raw fluorescence
and activity map images). To ensure that the response of individual neurons was not due to local
neuropil on somatic signals, a corrected fluorescence measure was estimated according to previ-
ously described methods (Chen et al., 2013) as Fcorrected_soma(t) = Fraw_soma(t) �0.7 � Fneuropil(t),
where Fneuropil was the defined as the fluorescence in the region 0–15 mm from the ROI border
(excluding other ROIs). The DF/F (corrected and uncorrected) for each neuron was calculated as DF/
Ft = (Ft � F0)/ F0, with F0 defined as the mode of the raw fluorescence density distribution.
Analysis of task-driven responses
After image preprocessing and DF/F extraction, traces were sorted into matrices by trial type (hit,
miss, correct reject, false alarm). Testing neurons for significant responses was complicated by the
large number of neurons (>9000) and the number of samples per trial. Using a traditional threshold
approach (with responses considered significant if they pass a threshold of multiple SDs from base-
line) would yield either an unreasonable number of false positives (if a low threshold was used) or an
unreasonable number of false rejections (if a high threshold was used). The GCaMP6s indicator has a
long decay time constant (t1/2 > 1 s), with fluorescence transients staying above baseline for >3 s for
even a single action potential (Chen et al., 2013). Thus, to capture weak but reliable trial-locked
activity while excluding artifacts, we used a low significance threshold (sample different from base-
line at p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) but required at least 10 samples to be significant in the
same direction for at least 2 (of 3) delays for either hit or CR trials to be considered statistically sig-
nificant (probability of significant response for any one neuron purely by chance <10–9). Since reliable
GCaMP6s signals will exhibit slow decay over 10 or more samples, this approach will allow genuine
calcium signals to emerge as significant, while chance fluctuations in fluorescence and short-duration
movement artifacts (such as during licking) will not pass the significance threshold. All neurons that
were significantly different from baseline according to these criteria in either the positive (enhanced
activity) or negative (suppressed activity) were included in further analysis. To ensure the neuropil
correction procedure did not create artificial responses, we required that both uncorrected DF/F and
corrected DF/F exhibit significant changes for neurons to be included. Once neurons were deter-
mined to have significant responses, the corrected DF/F was used for all further analyses. For some
analyses, the DF/F responses were normalized by subtracting the baseline response (1 s before stim-
ulus onset) and dividing by the maximum (for enhanced neurons) or minimum (for suppressed neu-
rons) trial-averaged DF/F for the neuron.
To investigate the clustering of task-driven responses (Figure 3), we first de-noised and reduced
the dimensionality of the data by taking the first 20 principal components (explaining 98% of the var-
iance). To cluster the data, we computed linkages using Ward’s method (with Euclidean distance).
The dendrogram revealed distinct groups with high inter-cluster distance (Figure 3A). Averaging the
responses of neurons within these clusters yielded distinct response types that corresponded well to
the range of observed responses (Figure 3B). To determine the number of clusters (K = 6), we itera-
tively increased the number of clusters until the average traces began showing highly overlapping

Neuroscience
 responses (at K > 6). Manual inspection revealed a small number of neurons within each cluster that
appeared to be miscategorized. To improve categorization (Figure 3C), we computed the Pearson
correlation coefficient between the response of each neuron and the mean of each of the six
response types. Neurons were re-categorized based on the response type with the highest correla-
tion to their average response, yielding distinct clusters with high face validity and internal consis-
tency (Figure 3—figure supplement 1–3).
The trial selectivity index (Figure 4C) was computed as SI = (Rpref – Rnon-pref)/(Rpref + Rnon-pref),
where Rpref and Rnon-pref are the responses to the preferred and non-preferred trials, respectively.
The modal latency of the population (Figure 4D, Figure 5D) was estimated by first taking the DF/F
of each neuron, and upsampling (via linear interpolation) the mean DF/F signal to 1000 Hz. We then
determined the point at which the mean DF/F signal for each neuron went above or below baseline
in a sustained manner (>1s from mean baseline DF/F for 1000 consecutive samples, or 1 s in trial
time) and used the first sample as the estimated latency for that neuron. Since the latency distribu-
tion of the population was highly skewed in higher regions, we used the first mode of the latency
density distribution to describe the onset of population activity (full latency distributions for 6 s delay
trials shown in Figure 5D). Note that these latencies are computed on upsampled data based on a
linear interpolation, so the values should be considered approximate. To measure whether the neu-
rons within a region exhibited delay modulation (Figure 4E) we fit the slope of the integrated DF/F
across increasing delay durations using a first order polynomial. We then calculated the delay modu-
lation index (DMI) as DMI = (npos-nneg)/(npos+nneg) for enhanced populations and DMI = (nneg-npos)/
(npos+nneg) for suppressed populations, where npos is the number of neurons with a positive slope
and nneg is the number of neurons with a negative slope.
Population encoding of task-related variables
In order to determine how well we could decode the stimulus identity for populations of neurons
(Figure 6B), we measured the discriminability of population responses on error trials from correct tri-
als with a different stimulus but the same response. For example, to compare miss and correct reject
(CR) population responses (different stimuli, same response), for each time point we first calculated
the Euclidean distances between the neural population response vector at each CR trial t and a tem-
plate CR response vector (average of all CR trials except t) and calculated the Euclidean distances
between each miss trial t and the template CR response (average of all trials). We then generated a
receiver operating characteristic curve from the distances to determine the discriminability of the
miss from CR responses. By taking the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC;
Britten et al., 1992) for each time point, we could quantify the performance of an ideal observer in
discriminating stimulus identity based purely on the population responses as a function of time dur-
ing the trial. For behavioral choice encoding (Figure 6C), the same analysis was carried out compar-
ing error-correct trial pairs with the same stimulus but different response. To reduce noise from
experiments with very few error trials, only experiments that had at least three error trials of each
type (miss, false alarm) were included in the analysis. To determine how coding varied as a function
of neural population size, we averaged the performance across 1000 iterations using populations of
1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 randomly selected neurons (Figure 6D). For significance testing, we calculated
the auROC for 1000 permutations with shuffled trial labels. Individual time points were considered
to predict stimulus/choice if the mean auROC was greater than the 95% confidence interval of the
shuffled permutations for at least 3 consecutive time points (to compensate for multiple
comparisons).

(Mante et al., 2013). Briefly, we first used principal components analysis to obtain a ‘de-noised’ esti-
mate of the most prominent response patterns in the population. We then used linear regression to
define de-mixed task-related axes of stimulus (y-axis) and choice (x-axis) from the principal compo-
nents. Average population responses in the two-dimensional state space were plotted for hit and CR
trials as a function of time throughout the trial. To reduce noise from experiments with very few error
trials, only experiments that had at least three error trials of each type (miss, false alarm) were
included in the analysis. To quantify population coding along the stimulus and choice dimensions
(Figure 7D), we simply subtracted the CR trajectory from the hit trajectory along the stimulus (blue)
and choice (red) axes. Chance difference levels were determined by calculating the 95% confidence
interval for 1000 permutations with shuffled trial labels.

 Electrophysiology methods
For in vivo anesthetized electrophysiology experiments (Figure 8A,B), we used procedures similar to
those previously described (Wilson et al., 2012). Briefly, transgenic VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice (n = 2)
were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%), with body temperature maintained at 37.5˚C with a heating
blanket. A metal head plate was attached to the skull using superglue and dental acrylic, and a
1 mm craniotomy was performed over V1. The dosage of anesthesia was then lowered (1%) before
beginning electrophysiology.
Recordings were made using custom software written in Matlab (Mathworks) controlling a Multi-
Clamp 700B Amplifier (Axon) that measured differences between a glass pipette electrode inserted
into the brain at 27º and an Ag/AgCl ground pellet electrode positioned in the same solution as the
brain. Borosilicate pipettes (outer diameter = 1.5 mm, inner diameter = 1.17 mm) were pulled using
a Sutter P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments) to a diameter corresponding to 3–7 MW. The pipette
was back-filled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and targeted to the injection site using a
10x lens. Cells were targeted blindly by advancing diagonally through the cortex with light positive
pressure. Cell proximity was detected through deflections in electrical resistance observed in voltage
clamp during a repetitive 5 mV command pulse. Once resistance had increased a few MW, slight
negative pressure was applied and the pipette was advanced more slowly until resistance further
increased (to a final value of 10–30 MW) and/or spikes were detected visually or via an audio moni-
tor. At that point, the amplifier was switched to current clamp to record spikes.
Optogenetic activation of local inhibitory cells (Figure 8, Figure 9) was achieved using a 200 mW
473 nm diode-pumped solid state blue laser (Opto-Engine) coupled with a 200 mm fiber. Laser inten-
sity was modulated with a variable neutral density filter (Thorlabs) to match the intensity used during
behavioral experiments (6.5 mW mm�2). Full-field drifting grating stimuli were presented for 4 s,
with each presentation preceded by a 6 s ‘off’ period with gray screen. Optogenetic stimulation
occurred on every other stimulus presentation during the middle 2 s of the ‘on’ period. Data was
analyzed using Matlab, with spikes detected using a manually-defined thresholds.
Photoinhibition
Blue light illumination was provided by a 200 mW 473 nm diode-pumped solid state laser (MBL-III-
473, Opto-Engine). The laser was passed through a 50/50 splitter (CM1-BS013, Thorlabs), with each
output passed through an adjustable neutral density filter (Thorlabs) into a fiber launch (PAF-X-11-
PC-A, Thorlabs). Fibers terminated in ceramic ferrules that were precisely positioned above the cra-
nial window with optical hardware. A light shield (eMachineShop.com) was attached to the head
plate to prevent reflected laser light from reaching the retina and influencing behavior. Laser power
was controlled by analog inputs sent from the behavior computer. Continuous light pulses (2.2 s, 6.5
mW mm-2) were used to suppress activity in a sustained manner at low laser power (Zhao et al.,
2011). We measured the spread of inhibition using immunohistological labeling of activity-driven
protein expression (see Histology section). For photoinhibition experiments, laser stimulation was
given on 50% of trials with 4 s delay (25% of all trials; no photoinhibition on 0 s or 2 s delay trials) in
a randomly inter leaved manner. Laser stimulation was applied throughout the duration of visual
stimulus presentation (stimulus epoch), in the middle 2 s of delay (delay epoch), or during the spout
extension (response epoch).
Histology
For photoinhibition characterization experiments (Figure 8), naı
¨ve VGAT-ChR2-EYFP or wild-type
mice were implanted with a head plate and a 2 mm diameter cranial window over the posterior cor-
tex (V1 or PPC). After recovery and habituation, mice were head-fixed and stimulated with 2 s light
pulses (6.5 mW mm-2) every 10 s. Drifting grating stimuli were played during the light pulses to drive
neural activity. After 1.5 hr of light stimulation, mice were removed from the rig and perfused with
4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed and placed in 4% PFA for 24 h, followed by 24 hr in
PBS. 50 mm sagittal slices were cut and placed in PBST (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) with 5% normal
goat serum for 1 hr. They were then incubated with primary antibody at 4˚C for 24 hr (rabbit Anti-c-
Fos 1:200, SC-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit Anti-Arc 1:200, ab118929, Abcam). After
washing in PBST, slices were incubated 1 hr with secondary antibody (1:200 AlexFlour555 anti-rab-
bit, Invitrogen). Slices were washed again in PBST, mounted and coverslipped. Slices were imaged

 on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Repeating this procedure with Arc as an activity
marker (1:500 anti-Arc, Abcam) yielded qualitatively similar results as c-Fos (data not shown).
General statistics
Data groups were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and then compared with
the appropriate tests (t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, all two sided). Bon-
ferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. Bootstrap estimates of s.e.m. were calculated
as the standard deviation of values evaluated in 1,000 bootstrap iterations, obtained by randomly
re-sampling with replacement from the original values. Due to very large sample sizes, very small
p-values (<10�9) were approximated as p<10�9as a lower bound on reasonable probabilities. Sam-
ple sizes were not explicitly estimated, as even a single session generally had sufficient samples for
the statistical tests used. However, to ensure that results were replicable between sessions and
mice, we included 4–6 mice for each region in both imaging and inactivation experiments.
