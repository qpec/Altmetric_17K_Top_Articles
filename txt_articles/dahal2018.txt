IMPORTANCE Treatment with aldosterone antagonists is recommended and has been shown
to have beneficial effects in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%. However, the role of aldosterone
antagonists in patients with ejection fraction greater than 40% or without congestive heart
failure is not well known.
OBJECTIVES To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis using standard techniques to
determine the role of therapy with aldosterone antagonists in this patient population.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central databases were searched
and a manual search for relevant references from the selected articles and published reviews
was performed from database inception through June 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials that evaluated treatment with aldosterone
antagonists in patients with STEMI without clinical heart failure or LVEF greater than 40%
were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses guidelines were used to conduct and report the meta-analysis, which used a
random-effects model. Two investigators independently performed the database search and
agreed on the final study selection. A manual search was performed for relevant references
from the selected articles and published reviews.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcomes analyzed were mortality, new congestive
heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and changes in LVEF,
serum potassium level, and creatinine level at follow-up.
RESULTS In all, 10 randomized clinical trials with a total of 4147 unique patients were
included in the meta-analysis. In patients who presented with STEMI without heart failure,
treatment with aldosterone antagonists compared with control was associated with lower
risk of mortality (2.4% vs 3.9%; odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91; P = .01) and similar
risks of myocardial infarction (1.6% vs 1.5%; OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.57-1.86; P = .91), new
congestive heart failure (4.3% vs 5.4%; OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.56-1.20; P = .31), and ventricular
arrhythmia (4.1% vs 5.1%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45-1.31; P = .33). Similarly, treatment with
aldosterone antagonists compared with control was associated with a small yet significant
increase in LVEF (mean difference, 1.58%; 95% CI, 0.18%-2.97%; P = .03), a small increase in
serum potassium level (mean difference, 0.07 mEq/L; 95% CI, 0.01-0.13 mEq/L; P = .02),
and no change in serum creatinine level (standardized mean difference, 1.4; 95% CI, −0.43 to
3.24; P = .13).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with aldosterone antagonists is associated with a
mortality benefit in patients with STEMI with LVEF greater than 40% or without heart failure.

 P
rimary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or
timely thrombolysis is recommended for patients pre-
senting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion(STEMI).1,2Despitesignificantimprovementinguidelines-
directed revascularization with PCI or thrombolysis, STEMI is
associated with significant morbidity and mortality of up to
23% within 5 years after PCI, with a significant number of
deaths occurring within the first 30 days.3 After STEMI, irre-
versible injury during the ischemia period may lead to necro-
sis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the reperfusion phase, lead-
ing to molecular and mechanical changes that eventually
contribute to the ventricular remodeling process.4-6
Ventricular remodeling predisposes patients to higher mor-
bidityandmortalityandthereforehasbeenthefocusoftherapy
to improve long-term outcomes after STEMI.7
Aldosterone, which is a mineralocorticoid hormone, has
been linked to the development of ventricular remodeling
through the promotion of tissue fibrosis.5 Elevated
aldosterone levels have been shown to correlate with worse
adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality; therefore,
reduction of aldosterone levels has been a target to improve
long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery
disease and patients who have experienced myocardial
infarction (MI).8-10 On the basis of the Eplerenone
Post–Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and
Survival Study (EPHESUS) trial, treatment with aldosterone
antagonists (AAs) has been recommended for patients with
acute MI with ejection fraction less than 40% and clinical
heart failure or diabetes.2,11 Thus far, the usefulness of AAs
in treating patients with STEMI with left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% has not been defined,
although a number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have
evaluated the role of AA therapy in patients with STEMI
without clinical heart failure or LVEF greater than 40%;
only 1 study12 showed a survival benefit associated with AA
therapy in patients with STEMI, whereas other studies had
inconclusive findings.13,14 Thus, to better define the role of
AA therapy in patients with STEMI without clinical heart
failure or LVEF greater than 40%, we performed this
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials.
Methods
Data Sources and Search Strategy
We complied with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct
and report this meta-analysis after writing a study
protocol.15 We searched the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and
Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials electronic data-
bases for English-language references from inception
through June 2017 using the search terms aldosterone
antagonists OR AA OR spironolactone OR eplerenone OR can-
renoate AND ST elevation myocardial infarction OR acute
myocardial infarction OR STEMI. Two of us (K.D. and S.S.)
independently performed the database search and agreed
on the final study selection. A manual search was per-
formed for relevant references from the selected articles
and published reviews.
Study Selection
Those RCTs evaluating the effects of treatment with AAs in pa-
tientswithSTEMIwithoutheartfailureorwithLVEFgreaterthan
40% in adult patients (≥18 years) were selected for the system-
aticreviewandmeta-analysis.Thosestudiesthatdidnotreport
on clinical or biochemical outcomes were excluded. Also ex-
cluded were studies evaluating patients after STEMI with LVEF
lessthan40%,meetingabstracts,andnonrandomizedstudies.

heterogeneity was evaluated with the Cochran Q and I2 index,
and significant heterogeneity (I2>60%) was explored with sen-
sitivity analyses. We planned prespecified subgroup analyses
based on the duration of follow-up (≥6 months vs <6 months),
Key Points
Question What is the role of aldosterone antagonist therapy in
patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without
heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 10
randomized clinical trials with 4147 unique patients who presented
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, treatment with
aldosterone antagonists was associated with significantly reduced
mortality and significantly increased left ventricular ejection
fraction at follow-up.
Meaning Patients who present with ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction could have survival benefit from initiation of
treatment with aldosterone antagonists.

We performed additional sensitivity analyses with use of
a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo model16 and reported
categorical variables as OR with 95% credible interval. A ran-
dom-effects model with informative priors was adopted for fi-
nal interpretation of the results.2,3 To achieve convergence, a
burn-in phase of 20 000 simulations was performed fol-
lowed by 50 000 simulations for the final analyses.17,18 Con-

Results
Description of Included Studies
eFigure 1 in the Supplement shows the PRISMA flow diagram
of study selection. A total of 319 citations were retrieved after
theinitialsearchofelectronicdatabasesandthemanualsearch.
After 29 duplicates were removed, 291 eligible citations were
screened, which resulted in 25 publications for full-text re-
view. Finally, we excluded 15 studies that did not meet the
specified criteria and were left with 10 publications for quali-
tative and quantitative analysis (meta-analysis).
Table 1 and Table 2 show the individual study and patient
characteristics of the included studies. Inclusion and exclu-
sioncriteriaarepresentedintheeTableintheSupplement.Ten
studies had enrolled 4147 patients, with 2093 patients in the
AA arms and 2054 patients in the control arms. Three studies
each originated from Italy13,25,26 and Turkey21-23; 1 study each
originated from Japan,24 China,6 and France12; and 1 study was
an international study.14 The AAs used were spironolactone,
eplerenone, canrenoate, and canrenoate followed by
spironolactone. Follow-up duration was variable: 6 to 12
months for 8 studies,6,12-14,21-23,25 1 month for 1 study,24 and
10 days for 1 study.26 Revascularization was performed with
primary PCI, thrombolysis, or both in all studies except the
2001 study by Di Pasquale et al,26 which included patients for
whom thrombolysis was contraindicated or who did not
achieve reperfusion after thrombolysis.
Clinical Outcomes
Therapy with AAs compared with a control group (from 9 stud-
ies) reduced the risk of mortality (2.4% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.62 [95%
CI,0.42-0.91];P = .01;I2 = 0)(Figure1).Nodifferencewasnoted
in the risk of MI (1.6% vs 1.5%; OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.57-1.86];
P = .91; I2 = 0) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), CHF (4.3% vs
5.4%; OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.56-1.20]; P = .31; I2 = 0) (eFigure 3
in the Supplement), and ventricular arrhythmia (4.1% vs 5.1%;
OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.45-1.31]; P = .33; I2 = 13) (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement) between the AA group and the control group.

 Change in LVEF and Biochemical Profile
Treatment with AAs compared with a control group resulted
in a small yet significant increase in LVEF (MD, 1.58% [95% CI,
0.18%-2.97%]; P = .03; I2 = 99) (Figure 2), a small increase in
serum potassium level (MD, 0.07 mEq/L [95% CI, 0.01-0.13
mEq/L]; P = .02; I2 = 99; to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 1.0) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement), and no change in
serum creatinine level (standardized MD, 1.4 [95% CI, −0.43
to3.24];P = 13;I2 = 100;toconverttomicromolesperliter,mul-
tiply by 76.25) (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
We performed subgroup analyses on the clinical outcomes
based on the individual AA agents, duration of follow-up (≥6
months vs <6 months), study size (small vs large), and com-
bined mode of administration (intravenous vs oral) with fol-
low-up duration. When analyses were restricted to indi-
vidual agents vs control, mortality benefit was not observed
for individual agents. Analysis based on the duration of fol-
low-up (6-12 months) showed reduced mortality risk associ-
ated with therapy with AAs compared with control, consis-
tent with the primary analysis. Similarly, we performed an
analysis that included the larger studies (≥100 patients in each
arm)6,12-14 that showed reduced mortality (OR, 0.57 [95% CI,
0.35-0.94];P = .03;I2 = 18)andsimilarriskofMI(OR,0.96[95%
CI, 0.52-1.77]; P = .89; I2 = 0), CHF (OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.60-
1.37];P = .63;I2 = 0),andventriculararrhythmia(OR,0.65[95%
CI, 0.16-2.68]; P = .55; I2 = 33) associated with AA therapy, con-
sistent with the primary analyses. The comparison of intrave-
nous administration of AAs followed by oral administration of
AAs with up to 6 months of follow-up vs oral administration
of AAs with up to 12 months of follow-up did not show a dif-
ference in the clinical outcomes. Because canrenoate is ap-
proximately 30% less potent than spironolactone,27 to ad-
dress the effect of dosing in various outcomes, we performed
additional analyses after excluding the studies that used low-
dose canrenoate (Di Pasquale et al13,26), which had results that
were consistent with the primary outcomes. The analysis ex-
cluding the 2001 study by Di Pasquale et al,26 which included
patients who did not undergo or achieve reperfusion, showed
a mortality benefit associated with receipt of AAs. Further-
more, we performed sensitivity analyses with use of a

 Bayesian model for mortality, MI, CHF, and ventricular ar-
rhythmia, and the results were not significantly different from
those of the primary analysis (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Study Quality and Publication Bias
The studies were of moderate to high quality according to the
Cochrane Collaboration’
s bias assessment tools.28 One study
showed bias for blinding of participants or personnel.12 One
study showed bias for blinding of participants and personnel
and outcomes.23 Five studies showed bias for allocation con-
cealment and blinding of participants, personnel, or
outcome.6,21,22,24,25 Publication bias was tested by visual ex-
amination of the funnel plots, which were symmetrical and
showed no evidence of publication bias for mortality out-
come (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Publication bias was not
tested for other outcomes because of the small overall num-
ber of studies available for meaningful assessment of publi-
cation bias (<10 studies).
Discussion
The major finding of our meta-analysis was the reduced risk
of mortality associated with receipt of AAs compared with a
control group in patients with STEMI without heart failure or
reduced LVEF less than 40%. The risks of CHF, MI, and
ventricular arrhythmia were, however, similar for both the AA
group and the control group. Therapy with AAs was associ-
ated with small increases in LVEF and serum potassium level,
andnodifferencewasobservedinserumcreatininelevel.Over-
all mortality rate after STEMI in this study was 3.14% at follow-
up, which is lower than the mortality rate of 4% at 1 year of fol-
low-up reported in a recent study.29
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to sys-
tematicallyreviewtheroleoftherapywithAAsinpatientswho
presented with STEMI and did not have significant LV dys-
function or CHF. The results of pooled analyses of 2 trials that
were included in this meta-analysis were presented at the
European Society of Cardiology meeting in 2017 and showed
mortality benefit in the AA-treated group vs the standard
therapy group (0.4% vs 1.6%; stratified OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.07-
0.65]; P = .006),30 which is consistent with our results. One
important observation in our meta-analysis was the reduc-
tion in mortality without a reduction in the outcomes of MI,
CHF, or ventricular arrhythmia, similar to the results of the
EPHESUS trial.11 The EPHESUS trial reported a significant re-
duction in all-cause and cardiovascular-associated mortality
without a difference in the incidence of MI or CHF or a reduc-
tioninhospitalizationsrelatedtoventriculararrhythmia.Apos-
sible mechanism for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to
reduce mortality is prevention of electrical remodeling that
precedes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy following MI.31 In addi-
tion, animal studies have shown that mineralocorticoid re-
ceptor expression in the heart results in cardiac arrhythmia–
related death that could be prevented by treatment with
spironolactone.32 Similarly, immediate treatment with min-
eralocorticoid receptor blocker results in MI healing by modu-
lation of the inflammatory response.33
Patientswithoutclinicalheartfailureatpresentationtothe
hospital constitute a large proportion of patients with STEMI.
In 4 years of data (from 1994 to 1998) from the National
Registry of Myocardial Infarction-2 study, 80.9% of 190 518 pa-
tients admitted to the hospital with STEMI presented with-
out heart failure.34 Another recent report, based on a large da-
tabase from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, revealed a
decreasing number of cases of heart failure at presentation,
from25.4%ofcasesin2003to20.7%in2010,among1 990 002
admissions of patients with STEMI.35 This epidemiologic trend
was most likely the result of improved pharmacotherapy and
revascularization,whichminimizedtheextentofinjurycaused
by acute coronary occlusion in patients with STEMI. In addi-
tion,thesedatashowthattheincidenceofpatientswithSTEMI
without heart failure may increase in the future, making such
patients an important population group in which to establish
interventions to improve outcomes.
The Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial Evaluating the
Safety and Efficacy of Early Treatment with Eplerenone in Pa-
tients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (REMINDER)14 and the
Aldosterone Lethal Effects Blocked in Acute Myocardial In-
farction Treated with or Without Reperfusion to Improve Out-
come and Survival at 6 Months’Follow-up (ALBATROSS)12 trial
were 2 of the most recent studies that investigated the role of
AAs in patients with STEMI without heart failure or signifi-
cant LV dysfunction. Although neither trial demonstrated a
meaningful benefit of treatment with AAs in the study popu-
lation, the REMINDER trial showed lower brain-type natri-
uretic peptide levels without other clinical benefits in partici-
pants treated with AAs, and the ALBATROSS trial, which
seemingly did not establish the benefit of AAs in the overall
studypopulation,showedsignificantbenefitoftreatmentwith
AAs in a post hoc analysis restricted to patients with STEMI.
At this point, there are 2 ongoing or just completed trials in the
ClinicalTrials.gov database. The Early Mineralocorticoid
Receptor Antagonist Treatment to Reduce Myocardial Infarct
Size (MINIMISE-STEMI) trial, which is now completed, aims
to compare the effect of spironolactone vs placebo on infarct
size in patients with STEMI.36 The Colchicine and
Spironolactone in Patients with STEMI/SYNERGY Stent Reg-
istry (CLEAR-SYNERGY) trial plans to compare the effects of
colchicine and spironolactone vs placebo in a 2 × 2 factorial
design on clinical outcomes after PCI in patients with STEMI
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03048825). These trials may
shed further light on the role of spironolactone in patients with
STEMI.
Thereareseveralimplicationsofthismeta-analysis.STEMI
and its adverse effects on morbidity and mortality remain ma-
jor cardiovascular problems, and there is a constant search for
therapies to improve survival and other clinical outcomes. The
mortality benefit observed in the meta-analysis was substan-
tial (38% reduction). One concern among physicians is the pos-
sibility of adverse effects associated with AA use, namely, hy-
perkalemia, acute kidney injury, and gynecomastia. Although
our meta-analysis indicated that AA use was associated with
elevated serum potassium levels, the clinical implications of
such a small increase in serum potassium level are unclear.
However, the serum potassium levels of patients who initiate

 treatmentwithAAsshouldbecloselymonitoredduringfollow-
up. No increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in the
meta-analysis, which is reassuring. Our meta-analysis clearly
showed a small but significant improvement in LVEF, the clini-
cal significance of which is unclear.
Limitations
A potential limitation of our meta-analysis is the lack of
patient-level data, which our study was not designed to pro-
vide. There was variation in the type of AA agents, the mode
of administration (oral vs intravenous), the duration of
follow-up, and the use of concomitant therapy, including
β-blocker use and reperfusion and revascularization strate-
gies; we tried to explore most of these factors with sub-
group analyses. Not all studies reported on each outcome of
interest, and some of the studies were not designed to mea-
sure clinical outcomes, which may be a limitation. However,
our meta-analysis has been strengthened by the inclusion of
all randomized trials published on this subject. In addition,
the results were mainly driven by the ALBATROSS trial,12
although there was a strong trend toward improved survival
when analysis was performed after exclusion of this study
(OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.47-1.04]; P = .08; I2 = 0).
Conclusions
On the basis of this meta-analysis, we conclude that AAs are
associatedwithamortalitybenefitinpatientswithSTEMIwith
LVEF greater than 40% or without heart failure. Future ad-
equately powered randomized studies should confirm these
findings.
