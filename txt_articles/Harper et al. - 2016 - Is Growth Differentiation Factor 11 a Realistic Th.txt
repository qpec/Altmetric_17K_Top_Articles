Abstract
This “Controversies in Cardiovascular Research” article evaluates the evidence for and against the 
hypothesis that the circulating blood level of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11) decreases 
in old age and that restoring normal GDF11 levels in old animals rejuvenates their skeletal muscle 
and reverses pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction. Studies supporting the 
original GDF11 hypothesis in skeletal and cardiac muscle have not been validated by a number of 
independent groups. These new studies have either found no effects of restoring normal GDF11 
levels on cardiac structure and function or have shown that increasing GDF11 or its closely related 
family member GDF8 actually impairs skeletal muscle repair in old animals. One possible 
explanation for what appears to be mutually exclusive findings is that the original reagent used to 
measure GDF11 levels also detected many other molecules so that age dependent changes in 
GDF11 are still not well known. The more important issue is if increasing blood [GDF11] repairs 
old skeletal muscle and reverses age-related cardiac pathologies. There are substantial new and 
existing data showing that GDF8/11 can exacerbate rather than rejuvenate skeletal muscle injury 
in old animals. There is also new evidence disputing the idea that there is pathological hypertrophy 
in old C57bl6 mice and that GDF11 therapy can reverse cardiac pathologies. Finally, high

 [GDF11] causes reductions in body and heart weight in both young and old animals, suggestive of 
a cachexia effect. Our conclusion is that elevating blood levels of GDF11 in the aged might cause 
more harm than good.

Introduction
Advanced aging is associated with alterations in cardiac muscle function and reductions in 
skeletal muscle mass and performance1–4. Reversal of those processes responsible for age-
related functional decline is an important area of investigation and might be termed 
“fountain of youth research”. A recent series of studies from the Lee/Wagers laboratories5–7 
suggest that age-related cardiac, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system abnormalities 
can be rapidly reversed if an old animal shares its circulation (parabiosis) with a young 
animal. These studies also suggest that an age-related reduction in growth differentiation 
factor 11 (GDF11), or it’s closely related family member myostatin (also known as GDF8)8, 
is centrally involved in these muscle abnormalities. These studies support the hypothesis that 
restoring youthful levels of GDF11 reverses complex age-related cardiac and skeletal muscle 
defects5–7.
However, there are many studies that do not support the idea that restoring GDF11 levels in 
aging improves muscle structure and function. Indeed, these studies show that GDF11 
actually cause muscle abnormities in aging and that blocking the effects of GDF8 and 
GDF11 in old animals improves their muscle function9–13. These findings are clearly at odds 
with one another.
In this article, we will review the current controversies regarding the roles of GDF8 and 
GDF11 as possible causes or cures of age-related cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction. 
We will evaluate data that claim either beneficial or detrimental consequences of 
administering GDF8 and GDF11 in normal and aged animals.
Do GDF11 and GDF8 have distinct effects on target tissues
One important aspect of the current debate is whether or not myostatin/GDF8 and GDF11 
have identical or distinct effects on target tissues. GDF8 and GDF11 are secreted proteins 
that are members of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) superfamily. The expression 
of these two proteins has distinct tissue specificity; GDF8 is largely expressed in skeletal 
muscle12, 14, 15 with lower expression in heart and adipose tissue16, while GDF11 is 
expressed in many tissues including the pancreas, intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, 
developing nervous system, olfactory system, and retina17, 18. Studies with global genetic

 disruption demonstrates that GDF11 regulates anterior-posterior regionalization and kidney 
development,17–19 while GDF8 negatively regulates muscle growth14. These results suggest 
distinct developmental roles for GDF8 and GDF11 that may provide some insights into 
distinct roles within adult tissue.
GDF8 and GDF11 are highly homologous with 89% amino acid sequence identity in the 
mature, active, protein. Similar to other TGFβ family members, GDF8 is expressed as a 375 
amino acid polypeptide, that is cleaved into an N-terminal latency associated protein and a 
C-terminal mature protein. Additional proteolytic processing at the RSRR site results in a 
12.5 kDa C-terminal mature peptide, which forms the biologically active GDF8 dimer and 
the N terminus propeptide. Both forms, active dimer and propetide, have been detected in 
mouse and human serum20. Due to its high similarity with GDF8, GDF11 most likely 
follows a similar pattern of maturation, however, to our knowledge, this has never been 
clearly elucidated.
GDF8 and GDF11 signal through the identical activin type II receptors and activate the 
canonical SMAD2/3 signaling pathway21. Indeed, Egerman et al.9 documented that both 
GDF8 and GDF11 equally activate this signaling pathway. These findings are entirely 
consistent with studies that demonstrate that both GDF11 and GDF8 inhibit skeletal 
myogenesis and muscle regeneration17, 20, 22. These results show that GDF8 and GDF11 
signal through identical pathways. Therefore, tissue specific GDF8 or GDF11 effects are 
likely due to local differences in their expression. However, the current reviews are 
specifically discussing circulating levels of active forms of GDF8/11 rather than tissue 
specific expression, local protein processing, or local activation.
Genetically induced loss of GDF8 function induces dramatically increased muscle mass and 
reduced fat pad mass in multiple species18,14.These finding clearly demonstrate that GDF8 
negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth. In contrast, loss of GDF11 results in homeotic 
transformations throughout the axial skeleton and posterior displacement of the hind limbs 
during embryonic development23. GDF11−/− mice die perinatally presumably due to 
developmental defects in kidney, GI tract, stomach and the palate19, 24. Analysis of mutant 
mice suggests that GDF11 has little involvement in skeletal muscle development19.
Collectively, these results suggest that GDF8 and GDF11 have distinct biological roles but 
these roles appear to be due to differences in the developmental pattern of expression or 
tissue specificity of expression. It does not appear that distinct GDF8 and GDF11 effects 
results from molecular signaling specificity, since all known data shows the two molecules 
bind to identical receptors and activate identical downstream signaling mechanisms.
Does GDF11 Decrease with Age and/or Disease?
One aspect of the current controversy is whether or not circulating levels of either GDF8 or 
GDF11 change with age. One group reports reductions of GDF11 with age5–8 and a second 
group reports increasing GDF11 with age9. Because GDF11 and GDF8 are 89% identical, 
assessing their relative levels is challenging. Also contributing to the discrepancies between 
the groups are differences in detection methods as well as the use of different reagents.

 Reliably and reproducibly documenting age-related changes in circulating GDF11 is critical 
to the central hypothesis of the Lee and Wagers studies5–7.
It is now well established that the antibody and SomaLogic technology used to identify and 
isolate GDF11 as a singular factor responsible for age-related disorders in the original Lee/
Wagers report in Cell5 does not have high GDF11 specificity. This reagent binds both 
GDF11 and GDF89, 25, 26 and since the circulating levels of GDF8 are many fold higher than 
GDF1127, the original data published by Lee/Wagers are clearly inadequate to support the 
central hypothesis of their work. This issue has not yet been resolved, and the Lee/Wagers 
groups no longer differentiate between GDF11 and GDF88. This appears to be an approach 
taken by several labs that are exploring GDF11/GDF8 as a contributing factor to age related 
disorders26. Our conclusion is that data obtained using non-selective reagents is inadequate 
to support the initial hypothesis that GDF11 is an important factor responsible for age 
related cardiac, muscle, and cognitive disorders27.
These problems with reagent specificity contribute to the uncertainty regarding GDF11 
concentration changes with aging and directly impact the assertion that supplemental 
GDF11 restores youthful functionality27. Importantly, using GDF8 null mice, Rodgers et 
al27 have shown that circulating GDF11 levels are 500 times lower than GDF827. If true and 
if circulating GDF11 and GDF8 have equal access to their common receptors in target 
tissues, the functional relevance of circulating levels of GDF11 is likely inconsequential.
The Glass group and the Houser lab working with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) developed 
sensitive, GDF11-specific methods9, 25 to determine concentrations of free, homodimeric 
GDF11 in serum from both young and aged mice as well as in humans. No significant age-
related differences in GDF11 for either species were found at BI (data not shown), similar to 
the results reported by the Glass laboratory9. Importantly, Glass’s group reported a trend for 
increased GDF11 levels in rats and humans. Therefore, using GDF11 specific assays, there 
is no evidence that GDF11 declines in serum during aging. It is clear that the specificity and 
sensitivity of the reagents are key factors in the discrepant findings published to date. Other 
contributing entities include the expression of and GDF11 binding to endogenous protein 
partners (e.g. GASP-1, GASP-2 and follistatin), as well as the impact of sample handling 
techniques on the kinetics of that binding.
We conclude that there is not yet sufficient evidence to know if the circulating levels of 
GDF11 (and/or GDF8) are reduced in aging. This is an area where new studies with reliable, 
easily repeatable approaches would help move the field forward.
Cardiac muscle
This section will address the hypothesis that restoring youthful levels of GDF11 in old mice 
rescues their pathological cardiac hypertrophy and restores normal cardiac performance5. 
The effects of GDF11 on the heart are not well known. The report published in Cell by the 
Lee/Wagers laboratories suggested that circulating levels of GDF11 fall in old mice, and 
restoring it to youthful levels reverses age-related pathological cardiac hypertrophy5. 
However, a subsequent study by the Houser lab, using a well-characterized lot of rGDF11, at

 the doses reported to be beneficial by Lee/Wagers groups was unable to validate the original 
findings25.
In healthy adult animals the heart weight (HW) changes in proportion to changes in body 
weight (BW) 25. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH) on the other hand is an increase in 
HW that is disproportionate to the BW. PCH usually results from acquired diseases such as 
chronic hypertension, ischemic heart disease or from genetic defects28–32. PCH 
characteristics include increased HW/BW, increased cardiomyocyte size, altered myocyte 
Ca2+ handling properties, decreased cardiomyocyte number due to myocyte death, and 
increased fibrosis29, 33. Some of these features can be present in the aged heart34, but there is 
little conclusive evidence that PCH develops as part of the normal aging process. In fact, 
age- related cardiomyopathy is often secondary to the acquisition of cardiovascular 
disease35, 36. Molecular causes of true age-dependent cardiomyopathy, in the absence of 
disease, are not well defined. There is a need for studies that better explain the mechanisms 
of aging-related cardiomyopathy to better define strategies to prevent or reverse these 
defects.
The remainder of this section will discuss the idea that restoring youthful levels of GDF11 
reverses age-related pathological cardiac hypertrophy5. This area of investigation began with 
a parabiosis experiment in which old mice shared a circulation with young mice. The heart 
weight/tibial length (HW/TL) of old mice was rapidly reduced (within a month) while in the 
control animals (old mice sharing a circulation with another old mouse), both the HW/TL 
and myocyte size were unchanged. The authors reported GDF11 as a circulating factor that 
was reduced in the blood of old animals that returned to normal levels in old mice sharing a 
circulation with young mice. In the second portion of this study, old animals received daily 
injections of what turned out to be poorly characterized rGDF11 (0.1 mg/Kg)8, for one 
month. This amount of GDF11 therapy reduced HW/TL and myocyte size without changing 
the body weight5. The Lee/Wagers labs suggested that GDF11 could be a novel therapeutic 
to reverse the adverse cardiovascular consequences of aging.
Needless to say, others should have been able to validate these results, since the relevant 
translational approaches were simple; daily injection of rGDF11 at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg. 
The Houser laboratory, collaborating with investigators from Boehringer-Ingelheim (BI), set 
out to validate and then extend these provocative findings. BI first performed extensive in-
vitro and then in-vivo testing of rGDF11 obtained from R&D Systems. BI documented the 
stability of the recombinant protein in solution at body temperature and ensured it 
maintained its bioactivity at 37° C for up to four weeks.
Given the importance of using well characterized recombinant protein, we next discuss some 
of the studies that were performed to characterize rGDF11 for the study published by the 
Houser lab25. Like many TGFβ family members, the active form of GDF11 is not soluble at 
physiological pH. Therefore, before injection of rGDF11 into animals, an extensive 
biophysical analysis was performed on purified rGDF11 from R&D Systems. These studies 
showed that rGDF11 exists as a disulfide linked dimer in solution but only when the pH is 
5.0 or lower. Aggregation and precipitation was observed in rGDF11 samples neutralized 
from pH 5.0 to pH 7.0 with transient nanoparticles about 50 nm (200 million Daltons) and

 larger species observed. At pH 7.0, residual smaller species were undetectable using UV 
absorption at 280 or 230 nm. These control studies showed that, because of variability in the 
efficiency of reconstitution from lyophilized powders, the best practice was to solubilize 
rGDF11 in an acidic buffer and measure the absorbance at 280 nm to document protein 
amount. These studies showed that assuming that the lyophilized powder is 100% protein (or 
even a certain percentage was protein by weight) generates incorrect data and is not a 
recommended way to ensure correct protein concentration.
When handled carefully using acidic buffers to avoid precipitation, rGDF11 was a stable and 
well-behaved homogenous solution of disulfide linked dimers with unremarkable 
hydrodynamic properties. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to characterize two 
samples of rGDF11 (from PeproTech and R&D Systems) before and after incubation at 37° 
C for one month. The purity and hydrodynamic sedimentation coefficient were examined 
using analytical ultracentrifugation showing minor loss of purity and total protein, and 
essentially identical shape and weight for the main species. Figure 1 demonstrates the 
biological activity of rGDF11 from PeproTech vs R&D Systems in the SMAD2/3 cell based 
assay. No difference in activity was observed between proteins from these two vendors. 
Additionally, activity of rGDF11 (R&D) was maintained for up to 4 weeks when stored in 
NaAcetate Buffer, pH 4.5. Collectively, these data document that the rGDF11 protein used in 
the study by the Houser lab was well characterized and stable for the dosing interval of 1-
month. The Lee/Wagers group cautions others8 to be careful when preparing rGDF11. 
However, they do not describe precautions taken in their studies to ensure reliable dosing or 
rGDF11 bioactivity. Their published reports suggest that they weigh the recombinant protein 
supplied by the vendor, place it in saline, and inject it into animals5, 8.
Once fully characterized, rGDF11 (0.1 mg/Kg) or vehicle was injected daily into old mice 
for a month25. This blinded study25 showed that rGDF11 injections raised circulating 
GDF11 to detectable levels. In this regard, BI developed an assay that could discriminate 
between GDF8 and GDF11, rather than the reagent used by the Lee/Wagers group that we 
and other showed readily detects both GDF11 and GDF89, 25, 26
The first important finding of the Houser lab/BI study was that there is no evidence for the 
existence of pathological cardiac hypertrophy or deranged cardiac function in 23-month-old 
C57BL6 mice. The putative pathological hypertrophy reported in both reports by the Lee/
Wagers laboratories is simply an artifact of using HW/TL rather than HW/BW to document 
pathological hypertrophy in mature adult mammals. A recent editorial by McNally37 
regarding the new GDF8/GDF11 study by the Lee/Wagers groups also identifies this 
concern8. The Houser lab found that daily injections of rGDF11 (0.1 mg/kg) had no 
significant effect on HW, BW, cardiac structure or cardiac function25.
The Lee/Wagers groups have recently published a follow up study in which they perform a 
rGDF11 dose-response experiment in young and old mice8. In these experiments they 
suggest that the rGDF11 dose (0.1 mg/Kg) used in their original report is actually too low to 
cause decreases in heart size. Since they documented a reduction in heart and myocyte size 
with a dose of rGDF11 in the original report5, we assume this means that they do not know 
the rGDF11 concentration used in their original study. Given that they now caution others to

 properly reconstitute the recombinant protein, it is likely that their original methodology was 
flawed. It is unclear when they realized they did not know the actual rGDF11 dose used in 
the original studies. It is unfortunate that this problem was not promptly reported to the 
scientific community. As discussed above, the Houser and BI labs properly characterized 
rGDF11 25 and we are confident that a rGDF11 dose of 0.1mg/Kg was used in our validation 
study. The unknown GDF11 dosage used in the original study from the Lee/Wagers 
laboratory was reported to cause a decrease in heart weight and myocyte size with no change 
in body weight in their old mice5.
So what are the key differences between these studies and how might they be explained? 
First, is there any pathological cardiac hypertrophy in old (23–24 months of age) C57Bl6 
mice? In both GDF11 reports from the Lee/Wagers groups5, 8 they start with the idea that 
C57Bl6 mice have aging-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy. We were unable to 
document any pathological cardiac hypertrophy in our old mice25. As discussed above and 
in a recent editorial by McNally37, the putative pathological hypertrophy is an artifact of 
using HW/TL as a measure of cardiac pathology. Disease-free mature adult humans often 
gain and lose weight and their heart weight changes proportionally with body weight. This is 
just the normal biology of adult mammals and does not reflect any pathological process.
The parabiosis experiments in the original Lee and Wagers study are consistent with our 
reinterpretation of their data5. The data required for us to reach this conclusion can be found 
in Supplementary Table 3 that is in the version of this report uploaded to the NIH after the 
manuscript was accepted for publication (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC3677132/). These critical data are not found in the version of the report published in 
Cell5. The data in Supplemental Table 3 show that the body weights of old animals were 25–
30% greater than the young animals before parabiosis. After a month of parabiosis, the old 
animals lost almost 25–30% of their body weight, and now were almost the same size as 
their youthful counterparts. These data strongly suggest that there was no change in the 
HW/BW of old animals after parabiosis, however the raw data needed to determine this were 
not in the published studies. The reduction in HW/TL reported in these animals, in our view, 
is adequately explained by the parabiosis-induced reduction in BW. However, an 
unexplained aspect of this study5 is that when an old animal shared a circulation with 
another old mouse (the obvious control experiment), both old mice lost about 25% of their 
body weight, but no reduction in HW/TL was reported. We have no scientific explanation 
for how an animal can lose 25–30% of its body weight without having a corresponding 
reduction in heart mass?
In our GDF11 study, we used heart weight to body weight ratios (HW/BW) to define the 
presence or absence of pathological hypertrophy25; we reported heart weights and body 
weights along with the HW/BW ratios. We found no age-related changes in HW/BW ratio 
and daily rGDF11 injections (0.1 mg/Kg) had no effect on HW/BW or myocyte size. In 
addition, we showed that standard markers of pathological hypertrophy were not different in 
young and old mice or in old mice before and after GDF11 treatment25.
In a new follow up study from the Lee and Wagers groups8, a rGDF11 dose response 
experiment was performed in both young and old animals. The authors again state that

 rGDF11 reversed pathological cardiac hypertrophy in old animals, and surprisingly even in 
young animals. In this report, the critical heart and body weight data are included in Online 
Table 18. In this new study, the influence of age and rGDF11 dose was tested in both young 
and old animals. The significance of these new data is difficult to evaluate because of the 
statistical approaches used. In our view, an ANOVA was needed to document age and 
treatment effects and if this is established, then the appropriate post hoc analyses could be 
performed. Instead the authors performed an unpaired t-test, within each age group, between 
saline treatment and each of the rGDF11 doses tested. Another concern is that there is an 
apparent mistake in the reported “delta body weight %” in the old saline treated mice (the 
comparator group for the unpaired t-test statistical analysis) that appears to invalidate the 
major conclusions of these experiments. Readers are referred to Online Table 1 where the 
saline induced body weights decrease (average body weight reported), but the % change is 
listed as an increase. Once this mistake is corrected there are no apparent rGDF11-induced 
changes in BW. Regardless of the questionable statistical approach and the discordance of 
raw body weight and % body weight changes in the old saline treated mice, there was 
clearly no effect of rGDF11, at any dose, on HW/BW, documenting that rGDF11 does not 
reverse pathological hypertrophy.
It is worth noting that the new data from the Lee/Wagers groups8 shows that daily injections 
of high levels of rGDF11 in young mice, that should raise circulating GDF11 well above 
normal levels, causes weight loss and reduced heart weight. These young, lean animals have 
no cardiac pathologies. In our view, a rapid (9 days) reduction in heart and body weight in 
young, lean mice suggests toxic effects of GDF11– certainly not a desired effect in young, 
healthy animals. Finally, the dose-dependent GDF11 effects reported were identical in 
young and old animals. These findings appear to invalidate the original hypothesis since 
there is clearly no pathological hypertrophy or cardiac dysfunction in young mice and an 
identical dose response relationship would not be expected if old animals truly have reduced 
circulating GDF11 levels.
Our conclusion is that the data from the Lee/Wagers5, 8 and the Houser lab studies25 do not 
support the hypotheses that 1) there is PCH in old C57Bl6 mice, 2) that reduced circulating 
levels of GDF11 are responsible for this PCH and 3) that raising GDF11 levels with daily 
injections of rGDF11 rescues cardiac pathologies. Additional work with carefully 
characterized animal models and rGDF11 should help the field determine if raising 
circulating GDF11 levels in old age repairs or damages the heart.
Skeletal Muscle
The extensive repair capacity of adult skeletal muscle becomes progressively reduced during 
aging in large part from effects on the muscle myofibers, losses of satellite cells (SCs) and 
losses of SC function38. A number of laboratories have demonstrated that aged satellite cell 
function and muscle repair can be improved by exposure to a young systemic environment 
or the inhibition of pro-geronic factors39, 40. Novel therapeutics to restore skeletal muscle 
repair mechanisms could improve the quality of life in old individuals.41

 A recent study from the Lee/Wagers laboratories suggested that reduced circulating levels of 
GDF11 are responsible in part for the age related decline in skeletal muscle function and 
restoring normal GDF11 levels rejuvenates skeletal muscle6. Recombinant GDF11 
[rGDF11: 0.1mg/kg, Peprotech] was administered daily over 4 weeks to restore normal 
GDF11 levels in old mice. Multiple assays including muscle regeneration, transplantation 
and in vitro SC cultures were used to examine whether restoring normal GDF11 levels 
rescues the defective “regenerative capacity of satellite cells”6. The authors reported a 
significant improvement in skeletal muscle structure and function in GDF11-treated aged 
mice. GDF11-treated mice had increased mean muscle fiber size in regeneration assays; SCs 
had improved engraftment capability in transplantation assays and increased myogenic 
clonogenic capacity in cell culture assays. Adult mice were ‘unresponsive’ to rGDF11 
therapy. No mechanistic studies were performed to address how GDF11 could function in a 
manner completely opposite to its highly-conserved ortholog GDF85, 6
A subsequent study from the Glass group9 was designed to reevaluate the idea that GDF11 
can restore the reparative/regenerative properties of aged muscle tissue. They instead found 
that exogenously administered rGDF11 protein, delivered at same dose and duration 
(0.1mg/kg, R&D Systems) as reported by the Lee/Wagers groups6 did not improve aged 
muscle regeneration, or increase the number of satellite cells in vivo. Moreover, Egerman et 
al.,9 showed that administration of higher levels of GDF11 (0.3 mg/kg, RnD) to adult mice 
(daily over 28 days) actually inhibited muscle repair. In addition, signaling studies and gene 
expression analysis confirmed that GDF11 and GDF8 were virtually identical in their 
activity.
The two reports appear to reach mutually exclusive conclusions, with one study showing a 
beneficial anti-aging effect of exogenously administered GDF11, and the other showing that 
increasing GDF11 actually enhances age-related skeletal muscle damage. These findings are 
difficult to reconcile. While the experiments involving muscle injury and satellite cell 
cultures are similar they are not identical. Differences in the form of muscle injury, source of 
recombinant protein and culture media conditions in vitro, are potential sources of 
variability. Below we address each of those potential factors.
Types of muscle injury
Different forms of muscle injury (thermal6 versus cardiotoxin9) were used in the two 
conflicting studies discussed above6, 9. Both injury models are commonly used methods to 
induce muscle repair. Cardiotoxin is usually administered via injection into the targeted 
muscle, whereas thermal injury is conducted following surgery to expose the muscle. The 
extent of injury can vary significantly between laboratories due to the type and amount of 
cardiotoxin used, and the method used to apply the thermal injury. The different injury 
paradigms result in somewhat different rates of muscle repair possibly due to differences in 
the inflammatory response and extent of cellular death42. The Lee/Wagers groups reported 
improved regeneration of rGDF11-treated muscle following thermal injury, and improved 
engraftment of adult satellite cells into rGDF11-treated muscle following cardiotoxin 
injury6. Thus, it does not appear that the mode of injury is likely to explain the difference in 
findings. However, this idea can be directly tested.

 Individual muscle fiber size varies considerably within a muscle tissue during the repair 
process. This variability is compounded if pre-existing i.e. non-injured muscle fibers, are 
factored into the analysis. Egerman et al.9 provided a detailed description of the rigorous 
methods used to quantify fiber size and accounted for uninjured fibers in the analysis. They 
did not see any enhancement in myofiber size no matter how the data were analyzed. 
Unfortunately, Sinha and co-workers6 did not fully describe the methods for myofiber size 
quantification, whether uninjured fibers were excluded, whether the analysis was blinded, or 
if samples were excluded. In addition, it is also impossible to determine if appropriate 
statistical analyses were performed because the raw data are not reported.
Satellite cell cultures
The Glass group9 showed that rGDF11 causes a dose dependent reduction in the expansion 
of both normal adult and aged satellite cells grown in culture, or on single fibers (the niche). 
The Lee/Wagers groups6 showed a rGDF11 dose-dependent increase in aged satellite cell 
expansion and differentiation with no effect on adult satellite cells. These disparate findings 
are also difficult to reconcile since one group found that rGDF11 reduced aged satellite cell 
expansion at all rGDF11 doses while the other found increased expansion as the exclusive 
effects.
Importantly, the Lee/Wagers groups reported that myostatin (GDF8) a known inhibitor of SC 
expansion decreased expansion of adult and aged satellite cell cultures. As discussed above, 
a major issue in this debate is the fact that GDF11 and GDF8 share significant homology 
and activate the same signaling mechanism through the same ActRIIb receptors. Tissue 
specific effects of GDF11 versus GDF8 could come about by tissue specific processing of 
inactive forms of these molecules. However, this point is irrelevant to the current controversy 
since the debate centers on circulating levels of mature, active forms of these molecules that 
were obtained from commercial providers.
The difficulty the Lee/Wagers groups have had in defining the actual GDF11 concentrations/
activity in their studies5, 6 also do not easily explain the disparate results in the literature. 
The Glass9 and Houser25 laboratories carefully characterized different lots of GDF11 from 
different suppliers and only used well characterized and well solubilized recombinant 
protein. Both groups9, 25 showed dose dependent GDF11 signaling through SMAD2/3 
reporter assays and then used the characterized protein in in-vivo studies. The Glass group 
clearly shows that all rGDF11 doses restricted expansion of SCs from both normal and aged 
animals9.
Egerman et al.9 used two complimentary assays to examine SC function, one that purifies 
SCs based on enzymatic digestion of muscle tissue, cell surface marker expression and flow 
cytometry, the other that isolated single muscle fibers which retains the SCs within their own 
niche. Sinha et al.6 assessed SCs in isolation only. Both groups show that the effects of 
GDF11 on isolated SCs are relatively modest. Egerman et al.9 reported a more robust 
phenotype using single muscle fiber assays, suggesting that the muscle fiber or a component 
of the niche is important for the inhibitory action of GDF11 on SC function. Somewhat 
counter intuitively, Sinha et al.6 reported numerous beneficial effects of GDF11 treatment of 
aged muscle including reduced DNA damage, rejuvenated mitochondrial function, and

 muscle force production. Again, no mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the 
rejuvenating effects of rGDF11.
Media composition
The notion that different media and serum composition could influence GDF11 activity in 
cell culture experiments is a possibility. Indeed, serum contains proteases that could impact 
processing and thus activity of GDF11. However, the recombinant protein used in all of the 
experiments by both groups was in the mature form, and therefore, it is hard to imagine that 
protease processing was an issue. GDF11 signaling could be altered if soluble inhibitors 
such as follistatin and activin were present at different quantities within the media used in 
the different laboratories. While this cannot be excluded, in vitro experiments performed in 
the labs of Dr. Glass and Dr. Brack9 produced the same in vitro phenotypes with different 
media. This suggests that GDF11 induces a robust inhibitory response in muscle cells in 
vitro.
Conclusions
The idea that normal skeletal and cardiac muscle properties can be restored in old animals 
by daily injections of rGDF11 is not well supported by the studies that have been published 
to date. This field would benefit from studies with well-described, easily repeatable 
approaches, well-characterized reagents, and the presentation of and appropriate analysis of 
all data needed to form conclusions.
