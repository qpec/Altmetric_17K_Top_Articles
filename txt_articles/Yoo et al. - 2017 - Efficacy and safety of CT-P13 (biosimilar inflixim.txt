ABSTRACT
Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of
switching from the infliximab reference product
(RP; Remicade) to its biosimilar CT-P13 (Remsima,
Inflectra) or continuing CT-P13 in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for an additional six infusions.
Methods This open-label extension study recruited
patients with RA who had completed the 54-week,
randomised, parallel-group study comparing CT-P13 with
RP (PLANETRA; NCT01217086). CT-P13 (3 mg/kg) was
administered intravenously every 8 weeks from weeks 62
to 102. All patients received concomitant methotrexate.
Endpoints included American College of Rheumatology
20% (ACR20) response, ACR50, ACR70, immunogenicity
and safety. Data were analysed for patients who received
CT-P13 for 102 weeks (maintenance group) and for
those who received RP for 54 weeks and then switched
to CT-P13 (switch group).
Results Overall, 302 of 455 patients who completed
the PLANETRA study enrolled into the extension. Of
these, 158 had received CT-P13 (maintenance group)
and 144 RP (switch group). Response rates at week 102
for maintenance versus switch groups, respectively, were
71.7% vs 71.8% for ACR20, 48.0% vs 51.4% for
ACR50 and 24.3% vs 26.1% for ACR70. The proportion
of patients with antidrug antibodies was comparable
between groups (week 102: 40.3% vs 44.8%,
respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse events
occurred in similar proportions of patients in the two
groups during the extension study (53.5% and 53.8%,
respectively).
Conclusions Comparable efficacy and tolerability were
observed in patients who switched from RP to its
biosimilar CT-P13 for an additional year and in those
who had long-term CT-P13 treatment for 2 years.

INTRODUCTION
Infliximab is a human–murine chimeric monoclonal
antibody to tumour necrosis factor (TNF).1 The
introduction of infliximab and other biological
drugs
into
clinical
practice
has
dramatically
improved
the
management
of
a
number
of
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including
rheumatoid
arthritis
(RA).2
However,
currently
available biologics are associated with high costs,3 4
which has led to restricted treatment access for
patients with RA in several regions.5–9
A number of biologics used to treat RA—includ-
ing
originator
infliximab
(Remicade),
hereafter
referred to as the reference product (RP)—have
reached or are approaching patent expiry in many
countries. As a consequence, follow-on biologics
(also termed ‘biosimilars’) are being developed for
the treatment of RA. A biosimilar can be defined as
a ‘biotherapeutic product that is similar in terms of
quality, safety, and efficacy to an already licensed
reference biotherapeutic product’.10 In order to
gain approval, it is usually necessary to show that a
biosimilar is highly similar to the RP in physico-
chemical and biological terms. In addition, clinical
studies are generally needed to establish statistical
equivalence in pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy
and to characterise biosimilar safety.11–13
Since the first approval of a biosimilar by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2006, a
number of these agents, including granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factors
and
erythropoietins,
have become available in Europe. Indeed, the range
of therapeutic areas now covered by approved
biosimilars is wide and includes cancer, anaemia,
neutropenia
and
diabetes.14
Data
for
these
EMA-approved biosimilars consistently show that
they provide comparable efficacy and safety relative
to their RPs.15–23 Recently, CT-P13 (Remsima,
Inflectra)—a biosimilar of infliximab RP—became
the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar to be
approved in Europe for use in all indications held
by the infliximab RP
. 24 All major physicochemical
characteristics and in vitro biological activities of
CT-P13 and the RP
, including affinity for both
soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF, are
highly comparable.24 25 Approval of CT-P13 was
partly based on findings from two 54-week, multi-
national, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group
studies, which compared CT-P13 and RP in anky-
losing
spondylitis
(AS)
and
RA

 evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-
p13 in AS patients (PLANETAS) and Programme evaLuating the
Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in RA patients
(PLANETRA)). These studies demonstrated that CT-P13 and RP
are highly comparable in terms of PK, efficacy, immunogenicity
and safety in both RA and AS.26–29 However, an important
unanswered question for prescribing physicians is whether it is
possible to switch from RP to CT-P13 in patients with RA
without any detrimental effects on safety and efficacy.30
Here, we report the findings from an open-label extension of
the PLANETRA study. There were two main aims of the exten-
sion study: (1) to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching
to CT-P13 in patients previously treated with RP for 54 weeks
in PLANETRA (hereafter named the ‘switch group’) and (2) to
investigate the longer-term efficacy and safety of extended
CT-P13 treatment over 2 years in patients previously treated
with CT-P13 in PLANETRA (the ‘maintenance group’). To
facilitate understanding of the data, the results for the mainten-
ance and switch groups are described both for the main (weeks
0–54) and the extension (weeks 54–102) studies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Full details of the methods of the 54-week, randomised, double-
blind, parallel-group PLANETRA study have been reported pre-
viously,26 27 and are described briefly below.
Patients
PLANETRA recruited patients aged 18–75 years with active RA
for ≥1 year according to the 1987 American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria. Eligible patients did
not respond adequately to ≥3 months of treatment with metho-
trexate (MTX) and received a stable MTX dose (12.5–25
mg/week) for ≥4 weeks before screening. Patients who had com-
pleted the main 54-week PLANETRA study were offered the
opportunity to enter the extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01571219) for another 1 year. Those who did
not sign a new informed consent for the extension study were
excluded. Some of the relevant Ministries of Health (MoH) and
ethics committees (ECs) did not approve the extension study,
mainly due to the fact that data from the PLANETRA study
were not available at the time of EC evaluation. Thus, patients
from affected institutions were also excluded.
Additional eligibility criteria applied for this extension study
included no major protocol violations in the main study and no
new therapy for RA in the extension study. Detailed information
on non-participants in the extension study is shown in figure 1.
Study design and treatment
This open-label, single-arm extension of PLANETRA was con-
ducted in 69 centres in 16 countries. In the main study, patients
received nine infusions of CT-P13 (CELLTRION, Incheon,
Republic of Korea) or the infliximab RP ( Janssen Biotech,
Horsham,
Pennsylvania,
USA).
After
study
treatment
in
PLANETRA, eligible patients could choose to continue in the
extension study. However, patients and physicians continued to
be blinded to the treatment that the patient had received during
the main study. All patients participating in and completing this
extension study received six infusions of CT-P13 from week 62
to week 102. During the whole study period, CT-P13 was admi-
nistered via 2 h intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg.
At the discretion of the investigator, antihistamines were pro-
vided 30–60 min prior to infusion of CT-P13. MTX (12.5–
25 mg/week; oral or parenteral) and folic acid (≥5 mg/week;
oral) were coadministered to all patients throughout the main
and extension study periods. All patients provided new written
informed consent to enrol into the extension study. The study
was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good
Clinical Practice guidelines.
Study endpoints
Efficacy
Efficacy assessments were made at baseline and at weeks 14, 30,
54, 78 and 102. Efficacy endpoints included the proportion of
patients meeting ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 criteria; change
from baseline in mean disease activity score in 28 joints
(DAS28) and the proportion of patients meeting European
League
Against
Rheumatism
(EULAR)
response
criteria.
Additional assessments included the number of tender and
swollen joints, patient assessment of pain, patient and physician
global assessment of disease activity, the Health Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ), levels of C reactive protein (CRP),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hybrid ACR score.
Immunogenicity
The proportion of patients with antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was
assessed at baseline and at weeks 14, 30, 54, 78 and 102 using
the previously reported method.26 27 The neutralising activity of
ADAs was also assessed by a flow-through immunoassay method
using the Gyros Immunoassay Platform (Gyros AB, Sweden).
Safety
Treatment-emergent
adverse
events
(TEAEs)
were
assessed
throughout the main and extension studies. Other safety assess-
ments
included
monitoring
of
TEAEs
of
special
interest
(infusion-related reactions (including hypersensitivity and ana-
phylactic reaction), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB (defined as a
positive conversion of an interferon-γ release assay (negative at
baseline) with a negative result for chest X-ray examination),
serious infection, pneumonia, drug-induced liver injury, vascular
disorders and malignancies), vital signs, physical examination
findings and clinical laboratory analyses.
Exploratory and post hoc endpoints
Details of exploratory and post hoc endpoints are given in
online supplementary appendix A.
Statistical analyses
All data were analysed descriptively in the maintenance and
switch groups. The populations were predefined in the study
protocol and statistical analysis plan for participants of the
extension study. The efficacy population included all patients
who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at
least
one
efficacy
measurement
in
the
extension
study.
Conservatively, ACR response was analysed using non-responder
imputation (NRI) for missing values and presented with 95%
CIs of the response rate using an exact binomial approach from
the efficacy population. No imputation of missing values was
done for analysis of other efficacy endpoints. The safety popula-
tion consisted of all patients who enrolled in the study, because
they had all received study treatment in the preceding study.
Data from the main study period were analysed in participants
of the extension study only, not in all patients in the main study.
Methods for sensitivity analyses of ACR response and statistical
analyses of exploratory and post hoc endpoints are included in
online supplementary appendix A.

 RESULTS
Patients
The first patient visit of the main PLANETRA study and the last
visit of the PLANETRA extension were held between November
2010 and July 2013. Of the 455 patients who completed the
main PLANETRA study, 302 patients consented to participate
in the extension study and were screened under the approval of
the appropriate MoH/EC (figure 1). Of the 302 screened
patients, all were enrolled and 301 were treated. One patient in
the maintenance group was enrolled but discontinued due to an
adverse event (B-cell lymphoma stage IV) before receiving treat-
ment in the extension study. A total of 158 patients had received
CT-P13 in the main study (maintenance group); 144 had
received RP (switch group). These patients comprised the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population of the extension study. Patient
demographics and disease characteristics at baseline and at week
54 of the main study were similar between the two groups
(table 1).
In the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, 133
(84.2%) and 128 (88.9%) patients completed the extension
phase; 25 (15.8%) and 16 (11.1%) patients discontinued over
the whole period of the extension study. Reasons for patient
withdrawal are shown in figure 1. The efficacy population of
the extension study included 152 patients in the maintenance
group and 142 patients in the switch group. Owing to incorrect
kits being dispensed, one patient randomly assigned to the RP
group
received
one
dose
of
CT-P13
at
week
2
in
the
PLANETRA main study. Applying a conservative approach, this
patient was classified as a member of the CT-P13 group for
safety analyses in the main study. Therefore, the safety popula-
tion of the extension study in the maintenance and switch
groups comprised 159 and 143 patients, respectively.
Similar to the ITT population of the extension study, patient
demographics and disease characteristics of non-participants in
the extension study were also comparable between the CT-P13
and RP groups (see online supplementary appendix B).
Efficacy
Throughout the extension study, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70
response rates were maintained, and no differences were evident
between the groups at weeks 78 and 102 (figure 2). In the
switch group, respective ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response

 rates were 77.5%, 50.0% and 23.9% at week 54 (ie, at the end
of RP treatment) and 71.8%, 51.4% and 26.1% at week 102
(ie, 48 weeks after the last infusion of RP at week 54). In the
maintenance group, respective ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70
response rates were 77.0%, 46.1% and 22.4% at week 54 and
71.7%, 48.0% and 24.3% at week 102. In patients who partici-
pated in the extension study, the proportion of patients achiev-
ing ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses during the main
study was also similar between the two groups. In a subgroup
analysis performed according to ADA status, the proportion of
ADA-negative patients achieving ACR20 was 85.7% at week 54
and 82.2% at week 102 in the maintenance group, and 84.7%
at week 54 and 82.8% at week 102 in the switch group. In
comparison, 68.0% (week 54) and 73.4% (week 102) of
ADA-positive patients in the maintenance group, and 70.6%
and 73.4% in the switch group achieved ACR20 (see online
supplementary appendix C, figure C-1).
No notable differences in other efficacy endpoints were noted
between or within the groups at weeks 14, 30, 54, 78 or 102.
The results for DAS28 score change and EULAR response cri-
teria are shown in online supplementary appendix D. The
results of assessments of tender and swollen joints, patient
assessment of pain, patient and physician global assessment of
disease activity, HAQ, levels of CRP
, ESR and hybrid ACR score
were not different between groups (see online supplementary
appendix E).
Sensitivity analyses to compare populations and statistical
approaches supported the appearance of sustained efficacy
and
comparability
between
the
two
groups
(see
online
supplementary appendix F). Analyses using the last observation
carried forward (LOCF) approach showed similar results as ana-
lyses using the NRI approach, both in the maintenance group
(ACR20: 74.1% using LOCF vs 71.7% using NRI at week 102,
respectively) and in the switch group (ACR20: 77.1% using
LOCF vs 71.8% using NRI at week 102). Analyses of the main
study ITT population using the LOCF approach showed rela-
tively low response rates compared with analyses of the exten-
sion study ITT population. However, response rates were
comparable between the groups and sustained throughout the
2-year study period, both in the extension study ITT population
(ACR20: 74.1% at week 102 vs 75.3% at week 54 in the main-
tenance group, 77.1% vs 77.1% in the switch group, respect-
ively) and in the main study ITT population (ACR20: 61.6% at
week 102 vs 62.9% at week 54 in the CT-P13 group, 59.2% vs
59.9% in the RP group, respectively). When data for the main
study ITT population were analysed using the NRI approach,
lower response rates were seen at week 102 than week 54
although rates were comparable between the groups (ACR20:
36.1% at week 102 vs 57.0% at week 54 in the CT-P13 group,
33.6% vs 52.0% in the RP group).
When remission was measured up to week 102 based on
ACR/EULAR criteria (Boolean-based definition and index-based
definition (Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI)), Clinical
Disease Activity Index (CDAI), DAS28 and DAS28 low disease
activity, the proportion of patients achieving remission or low
disease activity was similar between groups throughout the
study period (see online supplementary appendix G).
Immunogenicity
The proportion of patients with ADAs was similar between the
maintenance and switch groups at each time point during the
main and extension studies (table 2). Almost all patients with a
positive ADA result had a positive result for neutralising anti-
bodies (NAb), and the proportion of patients with a positive

 NAb result was similar between the two groups. The proportion
of ADA-positive patients with sustained ADAs was also highly
similar between groups (80.2% and 80.4% in the maintenance
and switch groups, respectively).
Pharmacodynamics
In a subgroup analysis performed by ADA status, the mean
change from baseline in CRP and ESR was comparable in the
maintenance and switch groups at week 54 and week 102 in
both
ADA-negative
and
ADA-positive
patients
(see
online
supplementary appendix C, table C-1).
Safety
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one TEAE
was comparable between the maintenance group and the switch
group (extension study: 53.5% (n=85 of 159) and 53.8%
(n=77 of 143), respectively; main study: 63.5% (n=101) and
62.2% (n=89)). Rates of TEAEs considered by the investigator
to be related to study treatment were also similar between the
maintenance and switch groups (extension study: 22.0% (n=35)
and 18.9% (n=27); main study: 35.2% (n=56) and 35.7%
(n=51)).
The most common treatment-related
TEAEs
are
shown in table 3.
With respect to serious adverse events (SAEs), these events
occurred in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, in
12 (7.5%) and 13 (9.1%) patients during the extension study,
and in 9 (5.7%) and 5 (3.5%) patients during the main study.
Treatment-related SAEs occurred in two (1.3%) and four (2.8%)
patients in the extension study, respectively, and in two (1.3%)
and
two
(1.4%)
patients
in
the
main
study
(see
online
supplementary appendix H). TEAEs leading to discontinuation
occurred in 16 (10.1%) and 8 (5.6%) patients during the exten-
sion study.
During the extension study, 11 (6.9%) and 4 (2.8%) patients
in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, reported
infusion-related reactions. All were ADA positive and had

 sustained ADAs. Only one patient in the maintenance group
experienced anaphylaxis. This patient was ADA positive (see
online supplementary appendix C, table C-2). In the main
study, infusion-related reactions were reported in 8 (5.0%) and
13 (9.1%) patients in the maintenance and switch groups,
respectively. Of these, 4 (50.0%) and 11 (84.6%) were ADA
positive. T
wo patients reported infusion-related reactions both
in the main study and in the extension study period (one patient
in each group). Table 4 shows data for all other TEAEs of
special interest. No cases of TB were reported during the exten-
sion study.
DISCUSSION
The PLANETRA extension study examined the efficacy and
safety of treatment with a maximum of six infusions of CT-P13
in patients with RA previously treated with either CT-P13
(maintenance group) or infliximab RP (switch group) for
54 weeks. Importantly, in the switch group, no notable differ-
ences in ACR response rates were observed between week 54
(ie, the last RP treatment) and week 102 (ie, 48 weeks after the
last RP infusion). Patients in the maintenance group of this
extension study received CT-P13 for a total of 102 weeks. In
this cohort, the responses to CT-P13 observed in the main study
were
sustained
during
the
extension
study.
In
the
main
parallel-group phase of PLANETRA,26 27 ACR responses were
broadly comparable with those observed in previous randomised
studies of RP up to 54 weeks.31–33 The multinational Anti-TNF
Trial
in
Rheumatoid
Arthritis
with
Concomitant
Therapy
(ATTRACT) was the pivotal study of MTX plus either RP or
placebo in patients with RA. Eligibility criteria for that study
were similar to those for PLANETRA. A comparison of the
102-week data presented here with data from the same treat-
ment duration of ATTRACT confirms that ACR response rates
in the former were at least comparable with those in ATTRACT
(if not higher).34 These data support the long-term efficacy of
CT-P13 in patients with RA. Further efficacy endpoints—includ-
ing DAS28-CRP
, DAS28-ESR and EULAR-CRP or EULAR-ESR
responses—were also maintained from week 54 to 102 in the
switch group and were comparable between the maintenance
and switch groups at weeks 78 and 102. In addition, the pro-
portion of patients with remission by ACR/EULAR criteria,
CDAI, DAS28 and DAS28 low disease activity was also compar-
able between the two treatment groups during the whole study
period. Together, this suggests that there was no detrimental

 impact on efficacy of switching from RP to CT-P13 in patients
with RA. Sensitivity analyses supported the sustained efficacy
and comparability observed between the two groups. A multiple
analysis approach, using LOCF and NRI methods, reported
similar results, both in the maintenance group and in the switch
group. Analyses of the main study ITT population and the
extension study ITT population using the LOCF approach
showed comparable and sustained outcomes throughout the
2-year study period. When analysed using the NRI approach,
response rates at week 78 and week 102 in the main study ITT
population were lower than when the LOCF approach was
used. However, response rates were similar in both groups
regardless
of
approach.
Variations
in
response
rates
that
occurred according to the analysis method were caused by the
fact that some responders in the main study did not participate
in the extension study (figure 1). In order to further understand
the influence of non-participants in the extension study, patient
demographics at baseline, disease characteristics at baseline and
week 54 (see online supplementary appendix B) and ACR20
responses according to ADA status at week 54 (see online
supplementary appendix I) were further analysed for this popu-
lation. The results support the comparability between CT-P13
and RP groups, even for non-participants.
CT-P13 was well tolerated during the extension study and dis-
played a long-term safety profile consistent with that of inflixi-
mab RP
.34 35 There was no noticeable difference in the safety
profile before and after switching. After week 54 of the main
study, the incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs or SAEs was
similar between the maintenance and switch groups. The inci-
dence of all potential infusion-related reactions did not increase
when patients previously treated with RP were switched to
CT-P13. During the extension study, 11 (6.9%) patients in the
maintenance group and 4 (2.8%) patients in the switch group
experienced infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions
were reported for 8 (5.0%) patients in the maintenance group
and 13 (9.1%) patients in the switch group in the main study
(ie, before the switch). Most of these events were of mild to
moderate severity.
In terms of immunogenicity, the proportion of patients with
ADAs remained stable and did not increase between weeks 54
and 102 in either group, although only qualitative analysis of
ADA data was performed. In a similarly designed extension of
the PLANETAS study, the proportion of patients with AS with
ADAs also did not increase consistently.36 In the PLANETRA
extension study, the ADA rate was comparable between the
maintenance and switch groups at 102 weeks. The proportion
of patients with sustained ADAs during the entire study period
was also highly similar between groups. Similarly, in the
PLANETAS extension study, the number of patients with AS
with sustained ADAs was also similar between maintenance and
switch groups. These data indicate no detrimental effect on
immunogenicity when changing from RP to CT-P13, at least for
the first six infusions. There was no analysis for IgG4.
Concomitant use of MTX has been shown to reduce the
immunogenicity of infliximab.37 In PLANETRA, MTX was
coadministered throughout the study. Given that the initial and
most recent doses of MTX were similar between the mainten-
ance and switch groups (initial dose: 15.47 vs 15.51 mg/week;
most recent dose: 15.52 vs 15.40 mg/week), it can be assumed
that the effect of MTX on the development of ADAs was also
similar between both groups. ADAs to infliximab are associated
with a reduced clinical response to this drug, as well as to
infusion-related reactions and other unwanted effects.38
39
Compared with ADA-negative patients, ADA-positive patients in
our study had lower ACR20 response rates and higher levels of
CRP and ESR. Such trends were comparable in both the main-
tenance and switch groups. All of the patients reporting
infusion-related reactions were ADA positive in both groups.
These results suggest that the effects of switching from RP to
CT-P13 did not influence the impact of ADAs.
The findings from the PLANETRA extension study indicate
that there are no harmful effects on efficacy, safety or immuno-
genicity associated with switching from RP to CT-P13 in
patients with RA. Similarly, no detrimental effects of switching
were observed in an extension of the PLANETAS study per-
formed in patients with AS.36 The current results are also
aligned with those observed in switching studies with other bio-
similars that have been approved by the EMA, which has strin-
gent guidelines relating to the regulation of these types of
agents. Switching data from a number of randomised and non-
randomised trials consistently show that detrimental effects of
switching between reference biologics and their EMA-approved
biosimilars are unlikely to happen.18 40–45
The current extension study was not formally designed to
evaluate the non-inferiority or equivalence of switching to
CT-P13 from RP versus continual CT-P13 treatment. In this
respect, a randomised, double-blind, phase IV study has been
initiated in Norway (‘NOR-SWITCH’; ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier: NCT02148640) to formally examine the switchability of
CT-P13 in a variety of indications. Additionally, a comprehen-
sive pharmacovigilance programme by the manufacturers of
CT-P13 is also ongoing. These postmarketing surveillance and

CONCLUSIONS
This multinational, open-label extension study demonstrated
that in patients with RA receiving MTX, switching from RP to
CT-P13 was not associated with any detrimental effects on effi-
cacy, immunogenicity or safety. Additionally, this study demon-
strated that CT-P13 remained efficacious and well tolerated over
a 2-year treatment period.
