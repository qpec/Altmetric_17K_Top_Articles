Objective: This study aimed to provide the most recent national estimates for beverage consumption
among children and adults in the United States.
Methods: Dietary data were collected from 18,600 children aged 2 to 19 years and from 27,652 adults
aged � 20 years in the 2003 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Total beverage
and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption was measured by 24-hour dietary recall.
Results: From 2003 to 2014, per capita consumption of all beverages declined significantly among chil-
dren (473.8-312.6 calories; P < 0.001) and adults (425.0-341.1 calories; P < 0.001). In the 2013-2014 sur-
vey, 60.7% of children and 50.0% of adults drank SSBs on a given day, which is significantly lower than
2003-2004, when 79.7% of children and 61.5% of adults reported drinking SSBs. From 2003 to 2014,
per capita consumption of SSBs declined from 224.6 calories to 132.5 calories (P < 0.001) for children
and from 190.4 calories to 137.6 calories (P < 0.001) for adults. The absolute levels for the percentage of
SSB drinkers and per capita consumption of SSBs were highest among black, Mexican American, and
non-Mexican Hispanic children, adolescents, and young adults for all years of the study.
Conclusions: Overall, beverage and SSB consumption declined for children and adults from 2003 to 2014. The
levels of consumption are highest among black, Mexican American, and non-Mexican Hispanic participants.

Introduction
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a leading source of added
sugar to the diet for adults and children in the United States (1). The
consumption of SSBs is strongly linked to obesity (2-5), though some
studies have found null results (6-8). On a given day, about half of
adults and two-thirds of children consume at least one SSB (1). In
recent years, SSB consumption has begun to decline (9); however,
rates of SSB consumption have remained persistently higher for racial
and ethnic minorities (1), who are also at higher risk for obesity (10).
Reducing SSB consumption is the focus of many public health efforts
in the United States. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
recommend reducing the consumption of added sugar to less than
10% of calories per day and, specifically, to choose beverages with no
added sugars (11). Several jurisdictions have recently passed beverage
taxes that increase the price of SSBs relative to noncalorie beverages
such as water. There have also been a variety of unsuccessful legisla-
tive attempts, such as SSB warning labels, portion size caps, and
restrictions on the purchase of SSBs with benefits from the Supple-
mental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program.
Given
the
considerable
research, policy, and advocacy activities focused on SSB consump-
tion, surveillance on trends in SSB consumption remains important.
Also critical is understanding how beverage intake has changed
overall in order to identify key future areas to target, as SSBs repre-
sent only one source of beverage calories. Though there have been
several studies on patterns and trends in SSB consumption (1,12-
16), few studies have examined national changes in beverage con-
sumption overall and by sociodemographic groups (17-20). No study
has presented the most recent national data on SSB consumption
from
the
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(NHANES). Available evidence looking at the consumption of all
beverages is several years old (19,20).
The purpose of this study is to provide the most recent national esti-
mates of the percentage of drinkers and amount consumed by bever-
age type as well as to analyze trends in beverage consumption
between 2003 and 2014.
Methods
Nationally representative data from NHANES for 2003 to 2014 were
used. A complete description of data collection procedures and analytic
guidelines are available elsewhere (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).

 The NHANES is a population-based survey designed to collect infor-
mation on the health and nutrition of the US noninstitutionalized popu-
lation. Participants were selected based on a multistage, clustered, prob-
ability sampling strategy. Since 2003, data have been collected
annually. The most recent data presented in this analysis are from the
2013-2014 survey, and trends were analyzed between 2003-2004 and
2013-2014 with six time periods. The response rates for individuals
selected for the survey interview were 79% in 2003-2004, 80% in
2005-2006, 78% in 2007-2008, 79% in 2009-2010, 73% in 2011-2012,
and 71% in 2013-2014.
The study sample consisted of children aged 2 to 19 years old and
adults � 20 years old with completed 24-hour dietary recalls from
each of the time periods. For the 24-hour dietary recall information,
responses for children ages 2 to 5 years were provided by care-
takers, responses for children ages 6 to 11 years were assisted by an
adult, and responses for adolescents were completed independently.
Survey respondents were excluded if their dietary recall was incom-
plete or unreliable (as determined by the NHANES staff). Because
of the small sample size of the other race and ethnicity category,
and because oversampling of non-Hispanic Asians did not begin
until the NHANES 2011-2012, we only reported the results for non-
Hispanic white participants, non-Hispanic black participants (here-
after referred to as NH white participants and NH black partici-
pants), Mexican American participants, and other Hispanic partici-
pants (hereafter referred to as non-Mexican Hispanic participants) in
the main analyses. The results for the other race group are available
upon request. Participants self-reported their race and whether they
were of Hispanic origin.
Survey respondents reported all food and beverages consumed in a
prior 24-hour period (midnight to midnight) and reported the type and
quantity for each item. After the dietary interview, all reported food
and beverage items were systemically coded with the use of the US
Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database that corre-
sponded with the survey year (21). Caloric content and other nutrients
derived from each consumed food or beverage item were calculated
based on the quantity of food and beverages reported and the corre-
sponding nutrient contents by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics. We only used the first dietary recall from each survey for this
analysis, as nonresponse is higher for the second dietary interview
across all waves, and including it would make our generalizability to

 the US population nonrobust. We also relied on the first dietary recall
because the interview settings differ between the two; day 1 recall
was collected via a face-to-face interview by trained dietary inter-
viewers in a mobile examination center. Day 2 recall was collected
via telephone 3 to 10 days after day 1. We identified seven mutually
exclusive beverage categories from 662 beverage items, including (1)
SSBs (soda, fruit drinks and punches, sports drinks, low-calorie
drinks, and other sweetened beverages), (2) 100% juice, (3) diet bev-
erages, (4) milk (including flavored milk, almond milk, soy milk, and
other milk alternatives), (5) unsweetened coffee or tea (hereafter
referred to as coffee or tea), (6) alcohol, and (7) water (first available
in the NHANES 2005-2006). Of note, coffee and tea with added
sugar were coded as either “other SSB” or “low-calorie SSB.”
To create the analytic data set for this analysis, we treated each of
the six NHANES waves as six samples of the US population
(assuming that the population is constant across time) and used the
day 1 dietary response weight, which adjusted for the complex sur-
vey weight and dietary nonresponse weight. Estimates of beverage
consumption (measured by the percentage of drinkers and calories)
are presented with 95% confidence intervals. In the text, we report
P values for the linear trend from 2003 to 2014. Differences in bev-
erage consumption levels were tested separately in children and
adults. All analyses were conducted by using Stata software, version
14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas). The Stata survey pro-
cedures were used to model the outcome variables, which take into
account sampling clustering, strata, and sampling weight. We used
the Stata survey logistic procedure to estimate the yearly proportions
of drinkers in each category and Stata survey regression to estimate
national yearly total calories. We conducted age-stratified regression
analyses for beverages overall, SSBs, and SSB subtypes. Multivari-
ate regressions were used to adjust for potential changes in popula-
tion composition over time, including age, race or ethnicity, and
gender. For adults, we additionally adjusted for education level. All
results were weighted to be representative of the general population
(except for Table 1, which provides the unweighted sample sizes),
the complex survey variance was estimated by using Taylor Series
linearization (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina), and all tables
and figures report predicted means based on the adjusted models. To
account for the possibility of false positives because of multiple com-
parisons, we used the Bonferroni correction (22), setting the signifi-
cance value at P < 0.01 for the five mutually exclusive beverage cate-
gories for which we had complete data for all years.
Results
There were 18,600 children (9,443 males and 9,157 females) and
27,652 adults (13,417 males and 14,235 females) with complete die-
tary recall in the NHANES from 2003 to 2014. Table 1 reports sam-
ple sizes by age, gender, and race or ethnic group.
The prevalence of SSB consumption declined significantly from 2003
to 2014 among children (79.7%-60.7%; P< 0.001) and adults (61.5%-
50.0%; P< 0.001) (Figure 1). Table 2 reports the prevalence of SSB
consumption stratified by age and race or ethnic group. Among chil-
dren, the prevalence of SSB consumption decreased significantly
across all age categories (P< 0.001 for all three). Within these age-
specific categories, there was a significant decrease in SSB consump-
tion prevalence for each gender (Supporting Information Table S1)
except females ages 12 to 19 years old. With respect to race and eth-
nicity, SSB consumption prevalence declined significantly across all
age categories of NH white participants, among NH black participants
ages 12 to 19 years old (89.6%-78.3%; P < 0.001), and among Mexi-
can American participants ages 2 to 5 years old (80.4%-53.6%;
P 5 0.003) and 12 to 19 years old (86.3%-71.6%; P< 0.001). No sig-
nificant declines in the prevalence of SSB consumption were observed
among non-Mexican Hispanic children. Among adults, the prevalence
of SSB consumption declined significantly among 20- to 39-year-olds
(72.5%-60.8%; P< 0.001) and 40- to 59-year-olds (61.0%-46.4%;
P < 0.001).

old (58.8%-42.9%; P5 0.002) and NH black participants ages 40 to
59 years old (74.5%-58.3%; P5 0.005). No significant declines in the
prevalence of SSB consumption were observed for Mexican American
or non-Mexican Hispanic adults. Supporting Information Table S2
reports the prevalence of SSB consumption for non-Hispanic Asian
Americans by using the 4 years available (2011-2014).

children and adults by type of beverage. Among children, the preva-
lence of 100% juice consumption declined significantly among 12-
to 19-year-olds (26.2%-18.6%; P 5 0.008), water increased signifi-
cantly across all age groups (P < 0.001 for all three), and no signifi-
cant changes were seen for coffee and tea, milk, or diet beverage
consumption for any age group. Among adults, the prevalence of

 100% juice consumption decreased significantly among those 60
years or older (32.5%-24.7%; P < 0.001), milk decreased signifi-
cantly among 20- to 30-year-olds (44.2%-35.2%; P < 0.001) and
those 60 years or older (54.9%-44.8%; P < 0.001), coffee and tea
decreased significantly among those 60 years or older (80.3%-
72.5%; P < 0.001), and diet beverages decreased significantly among
those 20 to 39 years old (16.3%-11.6%; P 5 0.001) and 40 to 59
years old (21.8%-19.2%; P 5 0.006). The prevalence of water con-
sumption increased across all age groups (P < 0.001 for all three),
and no significant changes were seen for alcohol.
Table 4 summarizes the prevalence of SSB consumption among chil-
dren and adults by type of SSB. Across all age groups of children, the
prevalence of soda and fruit drink consumption decreased signifi-
cantly. The prevalence of low-calorie SSB consumption increased sig-
nificantly among 12- to 19-year-olds (2.2%-4.8%; P 5 0.004), and
other SSB consumption increased among 6- to 11-year-olds (15.3%-
18.5%; P 5 0.002). No significant changes were seen for sports drink
consumption in children. Across all adult age categories, the preva-
lence of fruit drink consumption decreased significantly, and soda
consumption decreased among 20- to 39-year-olds (50.7%-35.2%;

 group. There was a significant decrease in soda calories for all age
categories of NH white and Mexican American children as well as
for NH black participants ages 12 to 19 years old. No significant
declines in soda calories were observed for non-Mexican Hispanic
children. Within age-specific categories of adults, there was a signif-
icant decrease in soda calories for males aged 20 to 39 years and 49
to 59 years and females aged 20 to 39 years. Significant declines in
calories from soda were observed for NH white participants aged 20
to 39 years and 40 to 59 years, NH black participants aged 40 to 59
years, and Mexican American participants aged 40 to 59 years. No
significant declines in soda calories were observed for non-Mexican
Hispanic adults.
Discussion
From 2003 to 2014, the per capita consumption of all beverages
declined significantly among children (from 473.8 kcal to 312.6
kcal; P < 0.001) and adults (from 425.0 kcal to 341.1 kcal;
P < 0.001). This was primarily driven by a decline in the percentage
of SSB drinkers and lower per capita consumption of SSBs. In the
2013-2014 survey, 60.7% of children and 50.0% of adults drank
SSBs on a given day, which is significantly lower than 2003-2004,
when 79.7% of children and 61.5% of adults drank SSBs. From
2003 to 2014, the per capita consumption of SSBs declined by 92.3
calories (from 224.6 kcal to 132.5 kcal; P < 0.001) for children and

 50.1 calories (from 190.4 kcal to 137.6 kcal; P < 0.001) for adults.
This overall decline in both beverage and SSB consumption is con-
sistent with previous literature, suggesting a recent “turning point”
(23) toward lower energy intake in the US diet, potentially attribut-
able to widespread discussion and media coverage of the role of cer-
tain foods (e.g., SSBs) in promoting obesity, changes to food allow-
ances within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants and Children, improvements to school feeding pro-
grams, and product reformulations by food manufacturers and
retailers. From an energy balance perspective, it is encouraging that
children and adults are consuming fewer calories from beverages, as
liquids have lower satiety and are less well compensated than calo-
ries from solid foods (24,25). The overall declines in beverage calo-
ries may help to explain the leveling of obesity in the general popu-
lation and reductions among young children ages 2 to 5 years.
Notably, in almost all years of the study, the percentage of drinkers
and per capita consumption was higher for milk than for SSBs
among younger children (aged 2-11 years). Over the period, milk
was the largest source of per capita beverage calories among
younger children (aged 2-11 years), and SSBs (mostly soda) were
the largest source of beverage calories for adolescents and adults.
For the years of the study in which water consumption was collected
(2005 and onward), the percentage of drinkers was high and
increased significantly over the period for all age groups. The preva-
lence of 100% juice consumption remained constant over time
across all age categories of children. The continual monitoring of
juice consumption trends remains important given the strengthening
evidence base linking 100% juice consumption to weight gain, par-
ticularly among young children (26,27).
The differences in SSB consumption trends by sociodemographic
characteristics were also notable. While NH white adults experi-
enced declines in SSB consumption across almost all age groups,
there were no significant changes for any age category of Mexican
American and non-Mexican Hispanic participants or for NH black
participants aged 20 to 39 years or 60 1 years. Furthermore, the
absolute levels for the percentage of SSB drinkers and per capita
consumption of soda remained highest among black, Mexican Amer-
ican, and non-Mexican Hispanic adolescents (12-19 years old) for
all years of the study, which is consistent with results from other
papers (14,19,28) and important because these groups are also at
higher risk for obesity and diabetes (10,29). Also like prior studies
(14,19), we observed a considerable gradient by age, with young
children and the elderly consuming the lowest quantity of SSBs and
adolescents and young adults consuming the most.
Although our results suggested that SSB consumption is declining
overall, they also highlighted the need for reducing disparities in
SSB consumption by race and ethnicity. Current public health
efforts may be helpful for narrowing this gap. Key among them are
beverage taxes, which are gaining momentum in the United States.
In 2014, Berkeley, California passed the nation’s first beverage tax.
Last year, six jurisdictions successfully followed suit (Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; Boulder, Colorado; San Francisco, California; Oak-
land, California; Albany, California; and Cook County, Illinois),
affecting roughly 8 million residents. Most recently, Seattle, Wash-
ington passed a beverage tax in June 2017. Several other jurisdic-
tions are actively debating a beverage tax. In Berkeley, California
and Mexico where evidence is available, the data suggests that the
taxes have a larger impact among low-income households or
neighborhoods (30,31). Targeted policies that aim to have a differen-
tially large impact on reducing SSB consumption among groups at
higher risk will also be an important strategy going forward.
Another way to encourage greater consumption of healthier bever-
ages (such as water) could be through procurement policies (32),
which place restrictions on the types of beverages that can be made
available for purchase in places such as schools, worksites, or gov-
ernment institutions. These healthy beverage procurement policies
may have the added benefit of catalyzing the beverage industry to
reformulate beverages to meet a heathier profile (such as flavored
water rather than soda).
These data provide the most recent national estimates for beverage
consumption among children and adults in the United States (overall
and by demographic characteristics) and analyze trends in beverage
consumption from 2003 to 2014. Despite these strengths, this study
had several limitations. Our reliance on single 24-hour dietary
recalls may have introduced inaccuracy and bias to our analyses
because of underreporting. However, evidence suggested better
recall accuracy with packaged beverage items such as SSBs. It also
did not consider the within-person variability in SSB consumption.
Therefore, the results should be interpreted as representing intake on
a given day rather than as usual intake over a longer period of time.
The NHANES data are cross-sectional, which only allowed us to
address associations rather than causality. These analyses did not
control for some health behavior variables that may be associated
with SSB consumption, such as smoking or physical activity.
Conclusion
Overall, beverage consumption declined for children and adults
from 2003 to 2014, driven primarily by a decrease in the percentage
of SSB drinkers and lower per capita consumption of SSBs. How-
ever, adolescents and young adults still consume more than the rec-
ommended amount of SSBs set by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans, and levels of SSB consumption are persistently
highest among black, Mexican American, and non-Mexican His-
panic individuals, who are also at higher risk for obesity. A notable
positive trend is the relatively higher consumption of milk (com-
pared to SSBs) among younger children and the increasing percent-
age of water drinkers among children and adults.O
