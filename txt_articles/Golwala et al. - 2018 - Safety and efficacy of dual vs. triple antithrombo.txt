Aims
Of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), approximately 10% undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
We studied the safety and efficacy of dual vs. triple antithrombotic therapy (DAT vs. TAT) in this population.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Cochrane database of sys-
tematic reviews, Web of Science, and relevant meeting abstracts for Phase 3, randomized trials that compared
DAT vs. TAT in patients with AF following PCI. Four trials including 5317 patients were included, of whom 3039
(57%) received DAT. Compared with the TAT arm, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor
bleeding showed a reduction by 47% in the DAT arm [4.3% vs. 9.0%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.53, 95% credible interval
(CrI) 0.36–0.85, I2 = 42.9%]. In addition, there was no difference in the trial-defined major adverse cardiac events
(MACE) (10.4% vs. 10.0%, HR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.48–1.29, I2 = 58.4%), or in individual outcomes of all-cause mortality,
cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or stroke between the two arms.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Compared with TAT, DAT shows a reduction in TIMI major or minor bleeding by 47% with comparable outcomes
of MACE. Our findings support the concept that DAT may be a better option than TAT in many patients with AF
following PCI.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major global health problem affecting 33.5
million individuals worldwide.1 Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with ei-
ther vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants
(NOACs) is the mainstay for prevention of thrombo-embolic events
in this population.2 Approximately 5–10% of these patients also
undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for concomitant
coronary artery disease (CAD).3 This overlap poses significant chal-
lenges since prior data from randomized trials have shown superior-
ity of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12
inhibitor over aspirin and VKA for prevention of stent thrombosis
and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients post-PCI.4,5
Consequently, most patients with AF following PCI are subjected to
treatment with a combination of both these therapies (DAPT plus
OAC), the so-called ‘triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT)’ approach.
While this approach is reasonable and endorsed by American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society
of Cardiology guidelines6,7 as well as expert consensus8–10 for varying
durations, the evidence supporting the same is sparse. A major limita-
tion of TAT is bleeding.11 One proposed approach is to curtail the
TAT to a minimum duration with a goal to reduce bleeding events.
However, this strategy has been challenged by data from the What is
the Optimal AntiplatElet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With
Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary StenTing (WOEST) as well as
Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen: Testing of a Six-
Week vs. a Six-Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen In Patients
With Concomitant Aspirin and OraL Anticoagulant Therapy
Following Drug-Eluting Stenting (ISAR-TRIPLE) trials which demon-
strated that many of the bleeding events occur in the first few weeks
after the initiation of TAT.12,13
In the last several years, a number of randomized trials14,15 have at-
tempted to evaluate the strategy of dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT)
vs. TAT in this patient population with DAT defined as a combination
of one antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant.16,17 In aggregate, studies
have suggested reduction in bleeding by almost half in patients on DAT
compared with TAT.18–21 These results are complemented by similar
incidence of thrombo-embolic and MACE between the two groups. A
major criticism for all the randomized trials is that none of them is suffi-
ciently powered to assess thrombo-embolic (efficacy) outcomes. To
reduce the selection bias introduced by observational data and to en-
hance the power for assessment of efficacy outcomes, we conducted a
systematic review and meta-analysis of Phase 3, randomized trials
examining DAT vs. TAT in patients with AF, following PCI with inclu-
sion of the most recently published Randomized Evaluation of Dual
Antithrombotic Therapy With Dabigatran vs. Triple Therapy With
Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (RE-DUAL PCI) trial, which is the
largest of all the trials on this topic to date.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for the systematic review and meta-
analysis. All relevant Phase 3 randomized clinical trials comparing TAT
(defined as DAPT plus an OAC) vs. DAT (defined as single antiplatelet
agent plus an OAC) in patients with AF following PCI were eligible for
inclusion. The primary exclusion criteria were observational non-
randomized studies, registry data, ongoing trials without results, editorials,
case series, and duplicate studies. A digital computerized search was con-
ducted through PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Cochrane database of system-
atic reviews, and Web of Science from its inception up to 25 July 2017
using the following search terms in various combinations: ‘percutaneous
coronary intervention’, ‘coronary stenting’, ‘coronary angioplasty’, ‘stents,
angioplasty’, ‘PCI’, ‘triple antiplatelet therapy’, ‘dual antiplatelet therapy’,
‘triple antithrombotic therapy’, ‘triple therapy’, ‘dual therapy’, ‘double
therapy’, ‘anticoagulants’, ‘antiplatelets’, ‘platelet aggregation inhibitors’,
’vitamin K antagonists’, ‘warfarin’, ‘dabigatran’, ‘rivaroxaban’, ‘apixaban’,
‘edoxaban’, ‘aspirin’, ‘thienopyridine’, ‘clopidogrel’, ‘atrial fibrillation’, and
‘randomized clinical trial’. In addition, references of prior systematic
reviews/meta-analysis, as well as abstracts from major cardiology meetings
were screened for related studies. There were no restrictions on lan-
guage, publication date, or publication status. Two investigators (H.G.,
A.Q.) independently reviewed the titles/abstracts and studies to deter-
mine their eligibility to meet the inclusion criteria. The same authors
(H.G., A.Q.) independently extracted all the relevant outcomes of interest
into a structured data set. The entire tabulated data set was reviewed, and
disagreements were resolved via consensus and by a third author (D.L.B.).
Data analysis
We extracted information about the following outcomes from individual
trials as well as their Supplementary material online12–15,22: Thrombolysis in
Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major and minor bleeding, intracranial bleeding,
all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent throm-
bosis, and stroke. It is important to note that ISAR-TRIPLE had a slightly dif-
ferent trial design compared with other trials included in the analysis. In
ISAR-TRIPLE trial, patients in both the arms were treated with the same tri-
ple therapy for the first 6weeks, after which the DAT group received as-
pirin and warfarin whereas the TAT group received aspirin, clopidogrel, and
warfarin. Henceforth, to have a valid comparison, our analysis incorporated
the event data from landmark analysis of the ISAR-TRIPLE trial.
The primary safety outcome was a composite of TIMI major or minor
bleeding. The secondary safety outcome was intracranial bleeding. The pri-
mary efficacy outcome was ‘trial defined MACE’ which followed the defin-
ition of MACE in the respective trials (Supplementary material online, Table
S3). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the individual components of the
primary efficacy outcome as well as cardiac death and stent thrombosis.
Effect size calculation
It was anticipated that the length of follow-up will differ between trials.
Consequently, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals for
each endpoint were extracted for each of the trials when reported. For
studies in which HR was not reported, the log (HR) and its variance were
estimated using a previously validated method, as follows23,24:
Log-HR = 2 * [(# observed events Group 1)- (# observed events
Group 2)]/[(# observed events Group 1)þ (# observed events
Group 2)]
Variance (log-HR)= 4/[(# observed events Group 1)þ (# observed
events Group 2)].
Statistical analysis
To accommodate the anticipated heterogeneity across studies, we used
random effects meta-analysis to synthesize results. In particular, we used
a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the random effects model. We
assumed a Gaussian distribution for random effects. The freely available,

open-source programme OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs
Sampling) was used to fit the model.25 Non-informative priors (normal
distribution with mean = 0, standard deviation= 1000) for the overall
mean HR and inverse-gamma (0.001, 0.001) for the between study vari-
ance was used. Convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler
was assessed using the Brooks–Gelman–Rubin method.26 In particular,
we employed four chains; convergence of the sampler was established if
the ratio of within-chain and between-chain variability for the four chains
starting at different initial values is close to 1.
Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test.
Higgins I2 statistics was used to determine the degree of in between study
heterogeneity (I2 < 25%—low, 25–50%—moderate, and >50%—high
degree of heterogeneity). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investi-
gate the robustness of our results to assess whether any of the included
studies had a large influence on the results.
The methodological quality of the randomized trials was assessed by
Cochrane’s Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. For each trial,
bias was assessed qualitatively as low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk
of bias by independent investigators. Publication bias was not assessed as
there were small number of studies (<10) included in the analysis.
Results
A total of 232 studies were screened for eligibility, out of which four
Phase 3, randomized trials including 5317 patients assessing the strat-
egy of DAT vs. TAT in AF patients following PCI were included in the
final analysis (Figure 1). Characteristics of the individual trials included
in the analysis with its primary and secondary outcomes are depicted
in the Supplementary material online, Table S1. One TAT arm of
PIONEER AF-PCI14 (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and low dose rivaroxa-
ban 2.5 mg twice daily, 709 patients) was not included in the analysis
as rivaroxaban 2.5mg is not an approved dose for thrombo-embolic
protection in patients with AF. Baseline characteristics of patients en-
rolled in the four trials included in this meta-analysis are shown in
Table 1. Mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 14 months. Mean age of pa-
tients across the trials was 70.9years in the DAT arm and 71.1 years
in the TAT arm. About 47% patients in the DAT arm and 45%
patients in the TAT arm underwent PCI for acute coronary syn-
drome (ACS), whereas the remaining 53% and 55% patients in the
DAT and the TAT arm, respectively underwent PCI for non-ACS in-
dications. Approximately, 75% of patients in the DAT arm and 82%
of patients in the TAT arm had a CHA2DS2VASc score of >2.
Furthermore, 66% of patients in the DAT arm and 71% of patients in
the TAT arm had a HAS-BLED score of >
_3. Atrial fibrillation was pre-
sent in 100% patients in the PIONEER AF-PCI and RE-DUAL PCI tri-
als, whereas AF was present in 84% and 69% of patients enrolled in
ISAR-TRIPLE and WOEST, respectively. All the trials were judged to
be at low risk of bias via the Cochran’s Collaboration tool for risk as-
sessment (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Compared with patients in the TAT arm, patients in the
DAT arm demonstrated a 47% relative reduction in the risk of
TIMI major or minor bleeding [4.3% vs. 9.0%; HR 0.53, 95%
CrI 0.36–0.85, I2 = 42.9%] (Figure 2). The risk of intracranial bleed-
ing was 42% lower, although not achieving statistical significance
(HR 0.58, 95% CrI 0.23–1.49, I2 = 0%) (Figure 3). These outcomes
did not differ when dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg doses were
analysed separately for the meta-analysis (Supplementary material
online, Figures S2A, B and S3A, B).
‘Trial-defined MACE’ occurred in 10.4% patients in the DAT arm
compared with 10.0% patients in the TAT arm (HR 0.85, 95% CrI
0.48–1.29, I2 = 58.4%) (Figure 4). Inclusion of original results of the
ISAR-TRIPLE trial did not alter our efficacy outcome results of trial-
defined MACE (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The indi-
vidual end-points of all-cause mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.46–1.37,
I2 = 39.3%), cardiac death (HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.41–1.54, I2 = 28.7%),
MI (HR 1.07, 95% CrI 0.58–1.95, I2 = 15.8%), stent thrombosis (HR
1.00, 95% CrI 0.32–2.82, I2 = 32.1%), and stroke (HR 0.94, 95%
CrI 0.45–1.84, I2 = 0%) did not differ between the two groups
(Figures 5–7). These outcomes did not differ when dabigatran 110 mg
or 150mg doses were analysed separately for the meta-analysis
(Supplementary material online, Figures S4–S9). One-study-omitted
sensitivity analysis showed that individual study data did not influence
our results (Supplementary material online, Figures S10 and S11).

Discussion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates several find-
ings that may impact clinical care. First, in patients with AF following
PCI, DAT reduces the composite of TIMI major or minor bleeding by
47% compared with TAT. Second, DAT seems comparable to TAT
in reducing the trial-defined MACE. Finally, there is no statistically sig-
nificant difference in individual outcomes of all-cause mortality, car-
diac death, MI, stent thrombosis, or stroke between the two arms.
Up to 30% of patients with AF are found to have concomitant
CAD, of whom 5–10% undergo PCI.3 It is evident that treating these
patients with OAC for thrombo-embolic protection is essential;
however, treatment of CAD post-PCI with antiplatelet agents is also
equally important. Prior studies have demonstrated that TAT after
PCI in these patients is associated with a two-fold increase in bleeding
compared with DAT.11,19,20,27 It is also known that bleeding events
post-PCI are associated with worse outcomes.28 In our analysis, we
found that DAT was associated with a 47% reduction in the compos-
ite of TIMI major or minor bleeding compared with TAT. These find-
ings have significant clinical implications, as bleeding is associated with
interruption of antithrombotic therapy which in turn is associated
with MACE.29 Furthermore, intracranial bleeding, one of the most
dreadful and feared complications of TAT, showed a strong numer-
ical trend towards reduction with DAT, particularly driven by

patients enrolled in trials evaluating NOACs. This finding is crucial for
management of patients at high risk of bleeding in which TAT may
carry an even higher risk.
While all the four trials12–15 have demonstrated a reduction in
bleeding with DAT compared with TAT, a criticism of all these trials
is that they were underpowered to assess efficacy outcomes. In our
pooled analysis, we found that DAT may not only reduce bleeding
events but is comparable to TAT for the reduction of MACE (Take
home figure). These results support the data from prior observational
studies.18,21 The precise reasons for similar efficacy of DAT vs. TAT
cannot be elucidated from our analysis; however, several mechanisms
are possible. Newer generation drug-eluting stents with extremely
low (<1%) incidence of stent thrombosis may have played a role.30 In
addition, clopidogrel on a biological basis has more platelet inhibition

compared with aspirin with less gastrointestinal bleeding which could
in combination with OAC avoid the need for aspirin.31,32 This hy-
pothesis has been supported by two randomized trials which demon-
strated that OAC is equivalent (or even better) than aspirin for
protection against thrombotic events.5,33 Finally, increased bleeding
related to TAT has been shown to interrupt DAPT which in turn
could increase MACE in the TAT arm.29,34,35
Our results may have several clinical implications. In an era where
the balance of ischaemic vs. bleeding benefit after PCI is gaining im-
portance, it is prudent that we understand the best approach to
antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF following PCI. In this con-
text, several factors that may affect therapeutic decision-making as
listed by the recent 2017 ESC focused update on DAPT in CAD (i.e.
risk stratification via assessment of ischaemic and bleeding risks using
predictor tools such as the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scoring
systems) should be emphasized.36 Our study demonstrates that
DAT is better than TAT for bleeding outcomes and comparable to
TAT for efficacy outcomes. Taking this a step further, the major ques-
tion that yet remains unanswered is the most appropriate combin-
ation for DAT (aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor with
VKAs or any specific NOAC) which provides us with the right bal-
ance for minimizing thrombo-embolic vs. bleeding risks in an individ-
ual patient. With several such combinations possible, future trials are
needed to answer these critical questions.
This meta-analysis has limitations. First, we used trial level data for
assessment of outcomes, and hence we could not evaluate if baseline
characteristics across various trials were different. Furthermore, sev-
eral patient level characteristics (e.g. older age, diabetes, renal failure,
or prior history of bleeding) as well as procedure related factors (e.g.
coronary anatomy complexity, stent length, left main stenting) which
could affect the intensity/duration of antithrombotic therapy use
were not analysed in our study. Second, we pooled results of all the
patients included in WOEST and ISAR-TRIPLE trials, although 69% of
patients in the WOEST trial and 84% patients in ISAR-TRIPLE trial
had AF. However, subgroup analysis of these trials did not demon-
strate any statistical differences in their primary outcomes based on
indication of OAC (AF, mechanical valves, or others), and hence we
feel that inclusion of all patients enrolled in these trials would be un-
likely to affect the final summary estimates of the meta-analysis.
Third, in the studies included in our analysis, apart from ISAR-TRIPLE
which had aspirin as the antiplatelet agent, the other three trials used
a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) combined
with either warfarin (WOEST) or NOACs (PIONEER AF, RE-DUAL
PCI). However, our one-study-omitted sensitivity analysis does affirm
that removal of the ISAR-TRIPLE trial from the analysis does not af-
fect our primary analysis estimate for either safety or efficacy out-
comes, indicating robustness of our results. Fourth, due to limited
number of studies reporting the data, we could not analyse inter-
action between several key subgroups such as type of index event
(ACS vs. non-ACS), type of stent (drug-eluting vs. bare-metal),
CHA2DS2/HAS-BLED risk score etc. and MACE. Finally, substantial
heterogeneity exists in between trials in terms of trial design as well
as type and duration of antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy used,
which could affect interpretation of our results.
In summary, our systematic review and meta-analysis supports
that DAT may be a better option than TAT in many patients with AF
following PCI.
