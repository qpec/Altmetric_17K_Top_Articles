ABSTRACT
The Dietary Reference Intakes set the protein RDA for persons >19 y of age at 0.8 g protein � kg body weight−1 � d−1. A growing body of evidence
suggests, however, that the protein RDA may be inadequate for older individuals. The evidence for recommending a protein intake greater than
the RDA comes from a variety of metabolic approaches. Methodologies centered on skeletal muscle are of paramount importance given the age-
related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) and the degree to which dietary protein could mitigate these declines. In addition
to evidence from short-term experimental trials, observational data show that higher protein intakes are associated with greater muscle mass and,
more importantly, better muscle function with aging. We are in dire need of more evidence from longer-term intervention trials showing the efficacy
of protein intakes that are higher than the RDA in older persons to support skeletal muscle health. We propose that it should be recommended that
older individuals consume ≥1.2 g protein · kg−1 · d−1 and that there should be an emphasis on the intake of the amino acid leucine, which plays
a central role in stimulating skeletal muscle anabolism. Critically, the often-cited potential negative effects of consuming higher protein intakes on
renal and bone health are without a scientific foundation in humans. Adv Nutr 2018;9:171–182.

Introduction
Aging is characterized by a decline in skeletal muscle mass
and loss of muscle strength, collectively termed “sarcopenia.”
Sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures, dependent
living, morbidity, and mortality (1, 2). In North America, it
is projected that, by the year 2050, 20% of the US, 25% of the
Canadian, and 28% of the Mexican population will be aged
>65 y. It has been estimated that ∼5–13% of persons aged
>60 y and ≤50% of persons aged >80 y are sarcopenic (3).
The direct costs attributed to sarcopenia were ∼$18.5 billion

in 2000, which represented 1.5% of the total US annual health
care expenditure (4) and will likely increase with the increas-
ing proportion of older individuals. To attenuate the direct
and indirect impact of sarcopenia we need to define strate-
gies that help to maintain or slow the loss of skeletal muscle
mass and function. Such strategies would need to be afford-
able, scalable, and have a low off-target (side effect) burden.
The main anabolic stimuli for skeletal muscle are exercise
and protein intake. Protein ingestion, and the ensuing
hyperaminoacidemia, stimulates muscle protein synthesis
(MPS) rates and suppresses, likely via insulin, muscle protein
breakdown rates. Therefore, protein is a key component of
the diet and should be present in sufficient quantities to
preserve muscle mass. We have previously discussed how
certain dietary and nutraceutical components interact with
resistance exercise to promote muscle growth (5). In this
review we present evidence that older individuals may have a
greater requirement for protein and can benefit from protein
intakes higher than the current protein RDA (6). We propose
that this is a tenable thesis based primarily on the preser-
vation of muscle mass with age. Our thesis rests on current
and emerging evidence showing that older individuals are,
to varying degrees, resistant to the anabolic properties of

dietary protein, which compromises a “youthful” robust
stimulation of MPS. A specific focus, beyond protein, is
placed on the amino acid leucine, which plays a key role
in activating MPS. The theme of this review is critically
important in nutrition due to the global increase in the aging
population and with the knowledge that with increasing age
far fewer persons are consuming dietary protein at the level
of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and RDA, and
in particular the protein intake level we are recommending
here (or perhaps lower quality of dietary protein) (7, 8). In
fact, intake data from persons aged >70 y show that 6% of
older men and 12% of older women consume less protein
than the EAR (Figure 1) (7). If, as we propose here, the
current EAR and RDA are too low, then these estimates of
insufficient protein intake are greater, which is a concern for
the aging population.
Current Status of Knowledge
The protein requirement for healthy adults is defined as the
lowest amount of dietary protein intake that will balance the
losses of nitrogen from the body, and thus maintain the body
protein mass, in individuals at energy balance with modest
levels of physical activity (9). The reference values for dietary
protein for the United States and Canada appear in the report
of the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine
published in 2005 (6). The EAR for healthy adults is 0.66 g
protein � kg body weight−1 � d−1. The safe level or RDA was
identified as being 2 SDs beyond the EAR at 0.8 g ·kg−1 ·d−1.
Thus, 0.8 g · kg−1 · d−1 would be expected to meet the re-
quirements for most (97.5%) of the healthy adult population.
These values are derived from a meta-analysis of all avail-
able nitrogen balance data obtained from adults (10). There is
concern whether the current EAR and RDA for daily protein
intake are accurate because of various well-recognized short-
comings of the nitrogen balance technique that critics have
highlighted (10–13). It is acknowledged that no notable phys-
iologic variable is known to be associated with being in ni-
trogen balance. In addition, very few nitrogen balance stud-
ies compared younger and older individuals, which precludes
the ability to define specific requirements for older adults
(10, 14). Finally, no recommendation exists on an “optimal”
protein intake aimed to enhance healthy aging that requires
more than the minimal dietary requirement (15, 16). The aim
of the current perspective is to address evidence that indicates
that older people have a greater requirement for protein than
the RDA, and to provide evidence for dietary strategies that
may help mitigate the loss of skeletal muscle mass.
Aging and Protein Requirements: Whole-Body
Measures
The current protein RDA was determined with the use of
the nitrogen balance technique. This technique is based on
the balance between nitrogen intake and nitrogen losses
through urine, feces, skin (primarily sweat), and miscella-
neous means (e.g., hair, nails, and exhaled ammonia) (10).
First, the study participants consume ≥3 different nitrogen
intakes for a period of 10–14 d, with nitrogen balance being
determined during the last 3–5 d. Next, linear regression is
performed on these nitrogen intakes and zero nitrogen bal-
ance is then determined by interpolation to estimate individ-
uals’nitrogen requirement. To define the current protein re-
quirements, Rand et al. (10) performed a meta-analysis in-
cluding 19 nitrogen balance studies that reported individ-
ual data rather than grouped data. The overall median re-
quirement of the meta-analysis was 105 mg N · kg−1 · d−1,
which equates to 0.65 g protein ·kg−1 ·d−1. Comparing sub-
sets of the data showed that the young individuals required
104 mg N · kg−1 · d−1, whereas older individuals required
131 mg N · kg−1 · d−1 (10). These values equate to 0.65
and 0.82 g protein · kg−1 · d−1 in young and old individu-
als, respectively, which translates to a substantial 25% greater
protein requirement for older persons. This difference was
not significant, and the authors provided 3 possible expla-
nations for their finding (10). First, nitrogen balance data
from older adults are somewhat contradictory and limited
because only 1 of the 19 studies included older participants
(10). In an effort to generate more nitrogen balance data in
older individuals, Campbell et al. (14) assessed nitrogen bal-
ance in 23 younger and 19 older men and women and ob-
served no difference in protein requirements between young
and older individuals. Second, energy requirements generally
decline with aging; therefore, the dietary protein-to-energy
ratio would be higher for older people (10). Third, chronic
diseases are more common in the elderly when compared
with young individuals and tend to lower the efficiency of ni-
trogen utilization and retention (10). Decreases in nitrogen
retention may result in loss of lean body mass that is often
seen during hospitalization or other clinical settings, which
could be detrimental for one’
s general health (17, 18). Re-
covery from such events is key for older people but often in-
complete (19). To regain lean body mass, nitrogen balance
needs to be positive during the recovery period, which can be

supported by a higher protein intake. Re-examination of the
data from Rand et al. (10) plus additional data at higher
protein intakes with the use of biphasic linear regression
yielded a higher EAR (0.91 g · kg−1 · d−1) and RDA (0.99
g · kg−1 · d−1) (20). In addition, with the use of the indi-
cator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) approach, which is de-
scribed below, Humayun et al. (20) estimated that, in young
men, the EAR for protein was 0.93 g · kg−1 · d−1. These re-
sults are in line with the EAR obtained when biphasic linear
regression was applied to the existing nitrogen balance data
(0.91 g · kg−1 · d−1).
The IAAO method for determining protein requirements
(20) is based on the concept that if dietary protein is below the
requirement (i.e., limiting), then the labeled indicator amino
acid, often l-[1-13C]phenylalanine, cannot be fully utilized
for protein synthesis. The indicator amino acid will remain
in the free amino acid pool where it will be oxidized, which
can be measured as 13CO2 in breath (9). The indicator amino
acid will be utilized for protein synthesis to an increasing
extent with increasing intakes of dietary protein approach-
ing the requirement. Therefore, oxidation rates will progres-
sively decrease and reach a plateau at the point where the pro-
tein requirement is reached (9). Thus, the protein require-
ment is the lowest level (i.e., breakpoint) in the oxidation
curve of the indicator amino acid against the amount of di-
etary protein (9). Studies that have applied the IAAO method
observed a protein requirement and safe intake amount
of 0.94 and 1.24 g · kg−1 · d−1 in older men (21), 0.96
and 1.29 g · kg−1 · d−1 in older women (22), and 0.85 and
1.15 g · kg−1 · d−1 in octogenarian women (23) (Table 1).
The protein requirements derived from IAAO studies are
substantially greater than the current RDA. Despite these re-
cent findings, there is still an ongoing debate on whether or
not to change the current protein recommendations (16, 24).
Future studies need to obtain ample data in older men and
women to refine the protein requirement for older adults.
More importantly, it would be desirable to link the outcomes
of such trials with measures of MPS and, ultimately, muscle
function.
Aging and Protein Requirements: Muscle
Measures
A substantive body of data obtained from stable isotope
tracer studies that assessed postprandial MPS responses sup-
ports the notion to recommend protein intakes greater than
the RDA for older people. Previous studies indicated that the
postprandial increase in MPS rates is generally lower in older
than in younger individuals (25, 26), which is known as age-
related anabolic resistance. Wall et al. (27) retrospectively an-
alyzed data from 6 studies conducted within the same labo-
ratory with the use of a similar study design and showed a
16% lower MPS response to the ingestion of an equal dose
of protein in older compared with younger men. In addi-
tion, Moore et al. (28) described, also based on a retrospec-
tive analysis, that the amount of dietary protein at which MPS
reached a plateau was 67% higher in older compared with
younger individuals when expressed relative to body weight.
Although there is limited information on the existence of an-
abolic resistance in older women, current data indicate that
older persons need more protein to achieve a robust stimula-
tion of MPS.
Optimal Protein Intakes to Stimulate MPS
Mounting evidence suggests that age-related anabolic resis-
tance to protein ingestion is ≥1 of the mechanisms under-
pinning sarcopenia. Protein dose-response studies have been
conducted to assess how much dietary protein is required to
maximally stimulate MPS. Cuthbertson et al. (29) assessed
the MPS response to graded intakes of essential amino acids
(EAAs) and observed in younger individuals that intakes
ranging from 2.5 to 10 g EAAs (equivalent to ∼5–20 g whey
protein) stimulated MPS in a dose-dependent manner. There
was, however, no further increase in MPS after the ingestion
of 20 g EAAs (29). The older subjects’MPS rates were stimu-
lated to the same extent as in younger individuals at doses of
2.5 and 5 g EAAs, but to a lesser extent at 10 and 20 g EAAs.
Even a 40-g dose of EAAs did not stimulate MPS in the older
men to the same level as observed in the young individuals
(29). These data indicated that the muscle of older persons is
Protein requirements in older persons

 equally sensitive to low doses of protein as in younger persons
but lacks the capacity for greater doses of protein to stimulate
MPS. This implies that greater doses of protein would not be
useful to mitigate sarcopenia and that repeated small doses of
protein may actually result in better maintenance of muscle
mass with aging. However, both Mitchell et al. (30) and Ager-
gaard et al. (31) reported no differences in MPS when protein
was ingested as a single bolus compared with repeated small
doses in older men.
Studies that assessed the MPS response to graded intakes
of intact protein, as opposed to crystalline amino acids, did
not directly compare younger with older individuals within
one study, but similarities in study design allow us to make
indirect comparison. Moore et al. (32) were the first, to our
knowledge, to conduct a dose-response study in younger
men after intense leg resistance exercise with postexercise
consumption of intakes varying from 0 to 40 g egg protein.
The results showed that maximal rates of MPS were achieved
after the ingestion of 20 g protein with no significant differ-
ence between 20 and 40 g. These data also showed that an
increasingly larger percentage of leucine, a key amino acid
responsible for triggering MPS (33–36), was oxidized with
increasing protein intakes. Witard et al. (37) confirmed the
results of Moore et al. by using whey protein and a unilat-
eral exercise model. Yang et al. (38) showed that, in older in-
dividuals, MPS was not significantly stimulated until older
individuals had ingested 20 g protein. By using a unilateral
exercise approach, Yang et al. also showed that whey protein
further stimulated MPS in the exercised limb with double the
dose (40 g) that maximally stimulated MPS in younger in-
dividuals (32). These data suggest that older individuals are
less sensitive to lower protein and amino acid doses and yet
do have the capacity to stimulate MPS to the same extent as
young individuals, but they require a greater dose of protein.
This finding is in contrast with Cuthbertson et al. (29), who
noted a high sensitivity to low doses of EAAs but a reduced
capacity to stimulate MPS after high intakes of EAAs.
Moore et al. (28) compiled data from 6 studies to obtain
postprandial body weight–normalized MPS rates over a wide
range of protein intakes in 65 younger and 43 older individu-
als. Biphasic linear regression was performed to determine
the relative protein dose required to maximally stimulate
MPS. The authors showed that young individuals required
0.24 g protein · kg−1 · meal−1, whereas older individuals re-
quired 0.40 g protein · kg−1 · meal−1. Importantly, the esti-
mated maximal MPS rates at these respective doses were not
statistically different between younger (0.058% ± 0.006%/h)
and older (0.056% ± 0.007%/h) subjects. These results (28)
led to the conclusion that aging is associated with a right-
ward shift in the dose-response curve for protein intake and
MPS, and that higher doses are required to maximally stim-
ulate MPS. An important point is that older persons are still
able to mount a full MPS response to higher protein in-
takes that is not different from that seen in younger per-
sons (38–41). Murphy et al. (42) recently assessed integrated
MPS rates over a 3-d period during which older individu-
als consumed either a lower (0.8 g · kg−1 · d−1) or higher
(1.2 g · kg−1 · d−1) protein intake diet. Surprisingly, higher
protein intake did not result in greater integrated MPS rates
than a lower protein intake (42). This suggests that older
individuals may require protein intakes even greater than
1.2 g · kg−1 · d−1 to further elevate MPS rates. In agree-
ment, Kim et al. (43) showed that 24-h MPS rates were
higher when older individuals consumed 1.5 compared with
0.8 g protein · kg−1 · d−1. The higher-protein diet also re-
sulted in greater whole-body protein synthesis rates without
affecting protein breakdown rates, thereby further improv-
ing net protein balance in older men and women (43). This
high-protein dosing strategy was twice the RDA and may not
be feasible from an economic perspective. Nonetheless, twice
the RDA has been shown to be effective in maintaining ap-
pendicular lean mass and improving physical function over
a 10-wk period in older men (44).
The reduced sensitivity of muscle in response to meal-
like amounts of protein in older persons may be caused by
≥1 of the following factors: reduced physical activity lev-
els, impaired protein digestion and amino acid absorption,
increased splanchnic amino acid retention leading to re-
duced aminoacidemia, impaired muscle perfusion reducing
delivery of amino acids to the muscle, reduced uptake of
amino acids by the muscle, and impaired intracellular an-
abolic signaling (45). Amino acid–mediated anabolic sig-
naling in skeletal muscle is primarily activated by the EAA
leucine (33). Leucine has been shown to bind to Sestrin2,
which promotes translocation of mechanistic target of ra-
pamycin complex 1 to the lysosomal membrane where it be-
comes activated, leading to activation of downstream sig-
naling and subsequent initiation of MPS (46–48). A certain
amount of leucine seems to be required to reach the thresh-
old for activating the MPS machinery (49, 50). Impairments
in ≥1 of the above-mentioned processes could compromise
the postprandial elevation in intracellular leucine concentra-
tions and subsequent activation of anabolic signaling. Ingest-
ing a larger amount of protein could overcome this problem
by providing more leucine. Nonetheless, higher protein in-
takes might not be feasible for older people because of re-
duced appetite, dislike of certain protein-dense foods, or the
inability to masticate protein-containing foods such as meat.
An alternative strategy for achieving a significant elevation
in leucine and subsequent stimulation of MPS would be to
supplement a lower-protein–containing diet with leucine or
leucine-enriched proteins (51).
Leucine
The quantity of leucine on a per-meal basis required to max-
imally stimulate MPS is not known and likely differs be-
tween younger and older persons. Insofar as muscle is con-
cerned, it is not protein per se that is needed to stimulate
MPS but simply a greater quantity of EAAs (52). Of all of the
EAAs, leucine appears to be the most potent in activating an-
abolic signaling, although all EAAs are required to support
the leucine-driven increase in MPS (33, 53, 54). Katsanos
et al. (34) showed that a mixture of all EEAs with leucine

 content at 1.7 g stimulated MPS in younger adults; how-
ever, this response was not observed in the older adults.
When leucine content was increased to 2.8 g there was an
observed increase in MPS rates in the older adults (34). In
contrast to older men, Bukhari et al. (55) reported that a mix-
ture of all EAAs with leucine content at only 1.2 g stimu-
lated albumin protein synthesis and MPS in older women.
Current research points to recommendations for older peo-
ple to consume leucine-rich food products to robustly stim-
ulate MPS and to promote muscle maintenance (34, 56–
59). The administration of crystalline leucine might be one
strategy to augment the postprandial increase in circulat-
ing leucine, because free leucine is rapidly absorbed by the
gut and does not undergo high first-pass splanchnic ex-
traction. We observed that, in young men, a small dose of
whey protein (6.25 g) when coingested with free leucine
(3 g leucine in total) was not as effective in stimulating
MPS as was a higher dose of whey protein (25 g) (60, 61).
However, when 4.25 g free leucine was added to the 6.25-
g dose of whey protein (5 g leucine in total), the postpran-
dial MPS response was not different from the 25-g dose of
whey protein (60). We subsequently conducted an experi-
ment in older men to examine whether integrated MPS rates
changed with leucine supplementation over the course of
3 d. Our results indicated that coingestion of 5 g crystalline
leucine with each of the main meals increased integrated rates
of MPS over 3 d, and this effect of leucine coingestion was
independent of whether older subjects consumed 0.8 or 1.2 g
protein · kg−1 · d−1 (42). Thus, muscle maintains its capacity
to respond to the anabolic effects of leucine across age, and
a higher leucine content per meal appears to be an effective
dietary strategy for enhancing leucinemia and stimulating
MPS. This information is promising and warrants more long-
term intervention studies on the effects of leucine-enriched
products on muscle mass and function in older adults.
Few studies have examined the longer-term effects of
leucine supplementation in older adults (62, 63). Verhoeven
et al. (62) assessed muscle mass and strength before and af-
ter 3 mo of supplementing 7.5 g leucine/d (3 × 2.5 g/meal)
in healthy older men. In contrast to the authors’hypothe-
sis, leucine supplementation did not increase muscle mass
or strength (62). Leenders et al. (63) performed a follow-
up study applying the same intervention over a 6-mo period
in participants with type 2 diabetes, who generally show an
accelerated loss of muscle mass (64, 65). Despite including
more participants and an intervention period that was twice
as long, there were no gains in muscle mass or strength in
this more-compromised sample (63). It is possible that im-
provements in study outcomes would have been observed
if a higher dose of leucine was administered to, for exam-
ple, frail elderly persons with a suboptimal diet (42, 62, 63).
In addition, when considering an estimated age-related loss
of muscle mass of ∼0.8% annually (1), an 85-kg older man
with ∼40–45 kg muscle (i.e., ∼60–62 kg lean body mass)
would lose ∼160–180 g total muscle mass over a 6-mo pe-
riod. Therefore, the supplementation period may have been
too short to detect differences in body composition with
the use of a DXA scan, and at best, leucine may only have
counteracted the loss in muscle mass. Recent evidence indi-
cated that twice-daily consumption of EAAs with a leucine
content of ∼3 g for 12 wk increased lean body mass by
1.1%, whereas EAAs with a leucine content of ∼1.5 g or
placebo did not significantly increase lean body mass in older
people (66).
Leucine- and Vitamin D–Enriched Whey Protein
Supplement
A body of research has investigated the effectiveness of a
whey protein supplement enriched with leucine and vitamin
D. In an acute setting, Kramer et al. (67, 68) showed that 21 g
whey protein combined with 3 g leucine and 800 IU vitamin
D increased MPS rates in both healthy and sarcopenic older
men. Subsequently, Bauer et al. (69) showed that this sup-
plement promoted a 170-g increase in appendicular muscle
mass as well as increases in muscle function and quality-of-
life scores in older men and women diagnosed with class I
and II sarcopenia. The nutritional supplement was provided
twice daily before breakfast and lunch for 13 wk in a large
study population consisting of 184 and 196 participants in the
active and control groups, respectively (69). In agreement,
Verreijen et al. (59) performed a follow-up study with the
use of the same supplement and reported that muscle mass
was preserved during a weight-loss program in obese older
adults. Furthermore, Chanet et al. (70) recently studied 24
healthy older (aged ∼71 y) men who consumed the supple-
ment or a noncaloric placebo with breakfast for 6 wk. They
observed that the experimental group gained more appendic-
ular lean mass than the control group. This finding was sup-
ported by the greater MPS response after the ingestion of the
supplemented breakfast compared with the control breakfast
(70). Together, these data indicated that a leucine + vita-
min D + whey protein formulation promotes maintenance
of muscle mass in older adults.
Aging and Protein Requirements:
Observational Data
Current protein intakes derived from the NHANES database
indicate that most adults consume at least the RDA.
Specifically, the average daily protein intake was 1.5 and
1.3 g · kg−1 · d−1 in young and middle-aged men and 1.2
and 1.1 g · kg−1 · d−1 in young and middle-aged women,
respectively (8). In older men and women, the average pro-
tein intake was 1.0 g · kg−1 · d−1 (8), which is well above the
RDA. However, ≥10% of older men and women consumed
less than the RDA (8). Although few studies observed no rela-
tion between the amount of dietary protein and muscle mass
(71–73), more recent observational evidence suggests that
protein intakes above the RDA may be necessary to support
healthy musculoskeletal aging (74–83). Observational stud-
ies indicate that higher protein intakes are associated with
better preservation of muscle mass (Table 2) and physical
function (Table 3). In addition, data in Table 2 indicate that
the quality of dietary protein (animal compared with plant)
may be an important modifiable risk factor for sarcopenia

(8, 78, 81, 82, 85–87). Plant-based proteins are less anabolic
than animal-derived proteins on a gram-for-gram basis due
to lower digestibility and lower content of EAAs and leucine
in particular (87, 88). However, with an adequate protein in-
take, the dietary protein source may not matter (78, 82, 85).
More research in this field is required to determine whether
a diet high in plant protein may allow for muscle mass main-
tenance with aging. A recent analysis of longitudinal data
showed that higher dietary protein (1.25 g · kg−1 · d−1)
accompanied by higher leucine (7.1 g/d) intakes were
associated with greater lean mass retention in persons aged
>65 y. More long-term longitudinal research is required to
define requirements and optimal intakes of leucine to im-
prove musculoskeletal health in older people (80). In gen-
eral, these data suggest that increasing high-quality dietary
protein intake is important for maintaining muscle mass and
function with aging.
Aging and Protein Requirements: Protein
Distribution Recommendations
The distribution of dietary protein intake has recently re-
ceived increasing interest. Many older people consume low,
medium, and high amounts of protein with breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, respectively. As the aging muscle becomes less
sensitive to lower amounts of protein, breakfast and lunch
may not provide sufficient protein to induce a robust stimula-
tion of MPS, whereas dinner may provide more protein than
required to maximally stimulate MPS. If the dose-response
nature of MPS is correct, then a more even meal-to-meal pro-
tein distribution may stimulate MPS to a greater degree with
each of the main meals and promote maintenance of muscle
mass with aging. This concept has been tested in several inter-
vention trials (89–96) and several observational studies (74,
97, 98) (Table 4). Figure 2 shows an example of a skewed and
more even protein distribution at different protein intakes.
Included is the optimal per-meal amount of dietary protein
for older individuals to maximally stimulate MPS (0.40 g ·
kg−1 · meal−1; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.59 g · kg−1 · meal−1) derived
from Moore et al. (28). At the current RDA, a skewed pro-
tein distribution may only reach the optimal amount of di-
etary protein 1 time/d with dinner. It is possible that an even
protein distribution at the RDA (each meal would be ∼0.27
g/kg) may in fact be inadequate for the maintenance of mus-
cle mass because none of the main meals would reach the
optimal amount of dietary protein for maximally stimulat-
ing MPS. A skewed protein distribution at a higher protein
intake (i.e., 1.2 g · kg−1 · d−1) would approach the optimal
amount of dietary protein with lunch while providing more
than required to maximally stimulate MPS with dinner. The
amount of protein in excess would be better consumed with
meals that are below the optimal amount of dietary protein
for maximally stimulating MPS. Higher protein intake with
an even protein distribution seems to be an optimal strategy
to maximally stimulate MPS with ≥2 of the main meals con-
sumed throughout the day. As such, it seems likely that an
even distribution of protein over breakfast, lunch, and din-
ner increases the potential to mitigate sarcopenia, provided
that sufficient amounts of protein are consumed with each
meal (i.e., ∼0.4 g · kg−1 · meal−1 with a total of 1.2 g · kg−1 ·
d−1). In agreement, data from Kim et al. (43) suggested ∼30%
greater MPS rates when consuming an even protein distribu-
tion at twice the RDA compared with an uneven protein dis-
tribution at the RDA in older adults. For the interested reader,
we refer to a review article on this topic (99).
Protein: Potential Negative Outcomes
An often-proffered reason as to why higher protein intakes
should not be recommended for older persons is the risk
of renal disease. There is general agreement on the effect
of dietary protein restriction on attenuating the decline in

glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among most forms of re-
nal injury in humans (100). Although there are potential
injurious pathways that have been proposed whereby diets
higher in protein could facilitate renal injury, the magnitude
of the effect and whether it exists remain unknown. In fact,
neither the Institute of Medicine (101) nor the WHO (9) ac-
knowledges that protein intake contributes to functional de-
clines in renal function with age. As stated, “Correlation of
creatinine clearance with protein intake showed a positive
linear relationship … suggesting that the low protein intake
decreased renal function. These factors point to the conclu-
sion that the protein content of the diet is not responsible
for the progressive decline in kidney function” (101). Meta-
analysis of intervention trials has shown that the GFR, as a
working index of kidney function, does not decline when in-
dividuals have higher protein intakes, but rather increases
(102). There is a belief that this renal hyperfiltration is a re-
sult of nephron loss; however, in humans, glomerular hyper-
filtration occurs at the whole-kidney level as a result of in-
creased kidney blood flow (103). Importantly, the increase in
GFR, known as functional reserve, is a normal response to
increased solute load and does not represent a risk factor for
the development of chronic kidney disease (104). In addition,
pregnancy and unilateral nephrectomy are characterized by
significant renal hypertrophy and hyperfiltration with in-
creases in GFR, whereas kidney function remains normal
(105–107). In 1 of the longest dietary intervention trials that
compared higher with lower protein intakes, it was reported
that in otherwise healthy obese persons a low-carbohydrate,
high-protein weight-loss diet over 2 y was not associated
with detrimental effects on GFR or albuminuria (108). Cau-
tion is certainly warranted in older patients with type 2 dia-
betes; however, when following a protein-restricted diet at an
intake less than the RDA, dietary proteins should be of the
highest quality possible (i.e., higher in leucine) to prevent
muscle loss.
An ostensibly negative aspect of recommending a higher
protein intake is related to bone health and the potential di-
etary acid load associated with protein. The theory is that
increased protein intake (and specifically sulfur-containing
amino acids) results in metabolic acidosis, which is buffered
through the release of alkalinizing compounds that are
derived from bone, resulting in bone mineral loss. This
so-called acid-ash hypothesis has been examined in meta-
analyses and found to lack support (109, 110). In the most re-
cent analysis conducted by the National Osteoporosis Foun-
dation, the authors concluded that there were positive (not
negative) trends in bone mineral density at most bone sites,
and that only the lumbar spine showed moderate evidence
to support benefits of higher protein intake (110). In congru-
ence with this conclusion, it has been suggested that dietary
protein is supportive of bone health, likely when calcium and
vitamin D intakes are also adequate (111).
Conclusions
Age-related loss of muscle mass and function increases the
morbidity and mortality risk of age-related chronic diseases
and increases the risk of disability. These concerns are going
to become an even greater issue given the global increases
in the aging population. The etiology of sarcopenia is com-
plex and multifaceted and there is no widely available phar-
macologic intervention with an appropriately low side-effect
profile to directly combat this condition. On the basis of a
number of lines of evidence, we propose that the current
protein RDA does not appear to meet the optimal protein
requirements for older people to maintain skeletal muscle
mass. Given that sarcopenia is, in part, underpinned by

FIGURE 2
Mean amount of dietary protein during breakfast,
lunch, and dinner at total protein intakes of 0.8 and 1.2 g · kg−1 ·
d−1 in a skewed and even protein intake distribution. The
distribution of protein over the main meals is derived from Farsijani
et al. (96), with the most skewed and most even distribution of
protein intake that is typically seen in older men. The horizontal
dashed line refers to the proposed optimal per-meal amount of
dietary protein for maximal stimulation of MPS of 0.4 g · kg−1 ·
meal−1 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.59 g · kg−1 · meal−1) derived from Moore et
al. (28). With the use of a skewed pattern at the RDA, only dinner
reaches the optimal amount of dietary protein. We recommend
protein intakes of 1.2 g · kg−1 · d−1. With the use of a skewed
pattern at this higher amount of dietary protein, both lunch and
dinner may provide ample protein for increasing MPS rates.
Alternatively, more evenly distributing protein intake throughout
the day at a higher amount of dietary protein may allow for a
stimulation of MPS after all of the main meals, thereby supporting
muscle mass maintenance with aging. MPS, muscle protein
synthesis.
the reduced ability of dietary protein to stimulate MPS,
increasing amounts of protein have been shown to result in
better preservation of muscle mass. Data reviewed here show
that protein-induced enhancements in skeletal muscle mass
and physical function could be augmented by supplementa-
tion with leucine. In case higher protein intakes are not suit-
able or desirable, the quality of the protein source should be
considered as an alternative variable to manipulate, and pro-
teins of higher quality should be substituted for those of lower
quality. In addition, observational data suggest that a more
even protein distribution throughout the day to per-meal
protein intakes within the range of the age-specific muscle
anabolic threshold may increase the potential for improved
long-term maintenance of muscle mass. As part of a multi-
modal intervention, increasing dietary protein intakes may
support not only muscle mass maintenance but also bone
health when calcium and vitamin D intakes are adequate. In
summary, there is still an ongoing debate on changing the
current protein recommendations; therefore, the question re-
mains: What is the optimal protein intake in aging and are we
ready to recommend more?
