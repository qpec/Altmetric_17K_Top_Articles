SUMMARY
The neuronal gene Arc is essential for long-lasting in-
formation storage in the mammalian brain, mediates
various forms of synaptic plasticity, and has been
implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. How-
ever, little is known about Arc’s molecular function
and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc
self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsu-
late RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from
neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the
transfer of Arc mRNA into new target cells, where it
can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified
Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer
Arc mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These re-
sults show that Arc exhibits similar molecular proper-
ties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis
indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage
of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, which are also an-
cestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that
Gag retroelements have been repurposed during
evolution to mediate intercellular communication in
the nervous system.
INTRODUCTION
Brains have evolved to process and store information from the
outside world through synaptic connections between intercon-
nectednetworks of neurons. Despitethe fundamental importance
of information storage in the brain, we still lack a detailed molec-
ular and cellular understanding of the processes involved and
their evolutionary origins. Eukaryotic genomes are littered with
DNA of viral or transposon origin, which compose about half of
most mammalian genomes (Smit, 1999). A growing body of evi-
dence indicates the sequences encoded by these elements can
provide raw material for the emergence of new functions and reg-
ulatory elements (Chuong et al., 2017). In vertebrates, these
include dozens of protein-coding genes derived from sequences
previously encoded by transposons (Feschotte and Pritham,
2007) or retroviruses (Kaneko-Ishino and Ishino, 2012). Interest-
ingly, many of these transposon-derived genes are expressed in
the brain, but their molecular functions remain to be elucidated.
The neuronal gene Arc contains structural elements found
within viral Group-specific antigen (Gag) polyproteins that may
have originated from the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon family
(Campillos et al., 2006; Shepherd, 2017; Zhang et al., 2015),
although the role these Gag elements play in Arc function has
not been explored. Arc is a master regulator of synaptic plasticity
in mammals and is required for protein synthesis-dependent
forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD)
(Bramham et al., 2010; Shepherd and Bear, 2011). Arc can regu-
late synaptic plasticity through the trafficking of AMPA-type
glutamate receptors (AMPARs) via the endocytic machinery
(Chowdhury et al., 2006). This endocytic pathway maintains
levels of surface AMPARs in response to chronic changes in
neuronal activity through synaptic scaling, thus contributing to
neuronal homeostasis (Shepherd et al., 2006). Arc’s expression
in the brain is highly dynamic; its transcription is tightly coupled
to encoding of information in neuronal circuits in vivo (Guzowski
et al., 1999). Arc mRNA is transported to dendrites and becomes
enriched at sites of local synaptic activity where it is locally trans-
lated into protein (Steward et al., 1998; Waung et al., 2008).
Intriguingly, aspects of Arc mRNA regulation resemble some
viral RNAs, as Arc contains an internal ribosomal entry site
(IRES) that allows cap-independent translation (Pinkstaff et al.,
2001). Arc is required in vivo to transduce experience into
long-lasting changes in visual cortex plasticity (McCurry et al.,
2010) and for long-term memory (Guzowski et al., 2000; Plath
et al., 2006). In addition, Arc has been implicated in various
neurological disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

 (Wu et al., 2011), neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Angel-
man (Greer et al., 2010; Pastuzyn and Shepherd, 2017) and Frag-
ile X syndrome (Park et al., 2008), and schizophrenia (Fromer
et al., 2014; Manago
` et al., 2016; Purcell et al., 2014). Thus, pre-
cise regulation of Arc expression and activity in the nervous sys-
tem seems essential for normal cognition.
Despite its importance, little is known about Arc protein
biochemistry and molecular function. Here, we uncover a poten-
tial role for Arc in mediating intercellular communication via
extracellular vesicles (EVs). Synaptic communication is modu-
lated by many other communication pathways that include
glia-neuron interactions, and emerging evidence suggests that
EVs mediate intercellular signaling in the nervous system (Budnik
et al., 2016; Zappulli et al., 2016). EVs can be broadly divided into
two groups, microvesicles and exosomes, which are defined
both by size and subcellular origin. Microvesicles pinch off
from the plasma membrane directly and are usually 100–
300 nm in diameter, whereas exosomes are derived from intralu-
minal vesicles that originate from multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
and are usually <100 nm in size. EVs can transport cargo that
do not readily cross the plasma membrane, such as membrane
proteins and various forms of RNA. The observation that EVs can
function in the intercellular transport of these molecules within
the nervous system opens an entirely new perspective on inter-
cellular communication in the brain.
Here, we find that Arc protein self-assembles into oligomers
that resemble virus capsids and exhibit several other biochem-
ical properties seen in retroviral Gag proteins such as RNA bind-
ing. Moreover, Arc is released from neurons in EVs and is able to
transfer its own mRNA into neurons. The Drosophila Arc homo-
log, dArc1, also forms capsids and mediates intercellular trans-
fer of its own mRNA at the fly neuromuscular junction (Ashley
et al., 2018, this issue of Cell), despite originating from a distinct
retrotransposon lineage. These data suggest that co-option of
retroviral-like Gag elements may have provided an evolutionary
pathway for novel mechanisms that mediate intercellular
signaling and have been intricately involved in the evolution of
synaptic plasticity and animal cognition.
RESULTS
Fly and Tetrapod Arc Genes Independently Originated
from Distinct Lineages of Ty3/gypsy Retrotransposons
To shed light onto Arc’s evolutionary origins, we performed phy-
logenomic analyses (Figures 1A and S1A). Highly conserved,
unique orthologs of the murine Arc genes were identified
throughout the tetrapods (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphib-
ians), but were conspicuously absent from all fish lineages and
other deuterostomes examined (94 species). The closest rela-
tives of Arc in the coelacanth, zebrafish, and carp genomes
were encoded by prototypical Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons,
with indications of recent transposition activity. Similarly, ortho-
logs and paralogs of Drosophila Arc (darc1, darc2) were identi-
fied in all schizophoran (true) flies represented in the database
but were not detected in any other dipteran (e.g., mosquitoes)
or protostome species (286 species; Figure S1B). The closest
retrotransposon relatives of the fly Arc genes were found in the
genomes of the silkworm and Argentine ant. Interestingly, while
Arc appears to be a single-copy gene in all tetrapods examined,
the gene has experienced multiple rounds of duplication during
schizophoran evolution (Figure S1B). Phylogenetically, tetrapod
Arc genes cluster with Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons from fish,
whereas the fly Arc homologs group with a separate lineage of
Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons from insects (Figure 1A). These re-
sults indicate that the tetrapod and fly Arc genes originated inde-
pendently from distinct lineages of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons,
as conjectured previously (Abrusa
´ n et al., 2013), but still share
significant homology in the retroviral Gag domain.
Arc Proteins Self-Assemble into Virus-like Capsids
Ty3
retrotransposons
can
form
oligomeric
particles
that
resemble retroviral capsids (Hansen et al., 1992), and Arc also
has a propensity to oligomerize (Myrum et al., 2015). Retroviral
capsid formation is essential for infectivity and is primarily medi-
ated by the Gag polyprotein, which in HIV contains four main
functional domains: matrix/MA, capsid/CA, nucleocapsid/NC,
and p6 (Freed, 2015). Arc has both primary sequence (Campillos
et al., 2006) and structural similarity to CA of HIV and Foamy Virus
Gag polyproteins (Taylor et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015), sug-
gesting that Arc may share functional similarities to Gag proteins.
To characterize the biochemical properties of Arc protein, we
expressed rat Arc in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion protein. The expressed protein was purified by affin-
ity and size exclusion chromatography, and the GST tag was
removed by proteolysis (Figures S2A and S2B). Purified prepara-
tions of rat Arc (prArc) were analyzed using negative-stain elec-
tron microscopy (EM) and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM).
These experiments revealed that prArc spontaneously forms
oligomericstructuresthatresemblevirus-likecapsids(Figure1B).
prArc capsids exhibited a double-shell structure with a mean
diameter of 32 ± 0.2 nm. Similarly, bacterially expressed and
purified dArc1 (Figure S2C), the Drosophila Arc homolog, also
self-assembled into capsid-like structures (Figure 1C). Purified
Arc protein that was expressed in an insect cell expression sys-
tem also assembled into similar virus-like capsids (data not
shown), indicating that oligomerization was not an artifact of

stain EM. Arc capsids were counted manually and quantified in each buffer condition at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Data are the average of 3 in-
dependent experiments ± SEM using different prArc preparations. **p < 0.01, Student’s t-test. (Bottom) Representative EM images of prArc under 0 M NaCl and

 bacterial expression. Immature retroviral capsids are formed by
the uncleaved Gag polyprotein, and the major stabilizing interac-
tions are made by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the CA region
(Mattei et al., 2016). To test whether the putative Arc CA CTD is
also required for self-assembly, we expressed and purified a rat
Arc mutant protein that lacked this domain (prArc-DCTD, missing
amino acids [aa] 277–374, Figures 1C, S2A, and S2B) (Zhang
et al., 2015). EM analyses revealed that prArc-DCTD was unable
to form double-shelled capsids, although intermediate irregular
structures were occasionally observed (Figure 1C). To test
whether the Arc CA domain was sufficient for capsid assembly
we created a mutant Arc protein that contained aa195–364
(CA-prArc; Figures 1C and S2A). CA-prArc was not sufficient to
form capsid-like structures. Arc capsids exhibit other properties
similar to HIV capsids, including sensitivity to salt and phosphate
levels (Purdy et al., 2008); increasing concentrations of NaCl from
0 to 300 mM resulted in stable prArc capsids and high NaPO4
further stabilized capsid formation (Figure 1D).
To test whether Arc forms oligomers in cells, we expressed Arc
in HEK293 cells, which lack endogenous Arc, and performed
chemical crosslinking to test for the presence of oligomeric spe-
cies. Arc proteins crosslinked in situ formed higher molecular
weight species with the SDS-PAGE mobility expected for dimer
and trimer subunits (Figure S2D), which is reminiscent of HIV Gag
subunits using a similar crosslinking assay (Campbell and Rein,
1999). In contrast, transfected GFP did not form higher molecular
weight crosslinks under the same conditions.
Arc Binds and Encapsulates RNA
Retroviral encapsulation of viral genomic RNA is a complex pro-
cess mediated by a network of interactions between Gag, RNA
and lipid membranes (Mailler et al., 2016). HIV Gag contains
zinc-finger knuckle motifs in the NC domain that mediate viral
RNAbindingandselection(Carlsonetal.,2016),butintheabsence
of viral RNA, Gag can also bind cellular mRNAs, which may reflect
nonspecific RNA interactions with the basic MA and NC domains
(Comas-Garcia et al., 2016). Interestingly, Foamy Virus Gags do
not contain zinc-finger domains and bind RNA through C-terminal
glycine-arginine-rich patches (Hamann and Lindemann, 2016),
indicating that distinct Gag domains from different viral families
have evolved to perform similar biochemical processes. Like
Foamy Virus Gag, Arc does not appear to contain zinc-finger do-
mains but may bind RNA through ionic interactions in its N termi-
nus. We observed that prArc appeared to co-purify with RNA or
other nucleic acids,as the preparations had a higherA260/280 spec-
trophotometric ratio than would be expected for a pure recombi-
nant protein (prArc 1.04 ± 0.024; Endophilin3A 0.55 ± 0.006;
n = 3, p < 0.01; Figure S2B). We therefore hypothesized that Arc
might bind and encapsulate RNA. To ascertain whether prArc
capsids contain mRNA, we determined levels of Arc mRNA and
a highly abundant bacterial mRNA, asnA (Zhou et al., 2011), using
qRT-PCR. We detected both Arc and asnA mRNA (Figure 2A).
However, Arc mRNA levels were �10-fold higher than asnA. Bac-
terial cell lysate contained �15-fold higher Arc mRNA levels than
asnA (Figure 2A), suggesting that prArc capsids show little
specificity for a particular mRNA, but encapsulate abundant
RNA according to stoichiometry. If mRNA is encapsulated in cap-
sids, it should be resistant to ribonuclease (RNase) treatment.
RNase did not degrade Arc or asnA mRNA, but significantly
degraded exogenous free GFP mRNA (Figure 2B), indicating that
Arc and asnA mRNA were protected from RNase degradation.
We tested whether Arc protein associates with Arc mRNA
in vivo by immunoprecipitating Arc protein from mouse cortical
lysate, followed by qRT-PCR (Figure 2C). Arc mRNA was
found to selectively immunoprecipitate (IP) with Arc protein, while
GAPDH was not enriched in Arc IPs. These results suggest that
Arc protein and its mRNA form a complex in neurons in vivo.
Arc Capsid Assembly Requires RNA
Toform the immature viral capsid, HIVGagmust bind RNA (Mailler
et al., 2016). To test whether Arc capsid formation requires RNA,
we purified full-length Arc protein as above and then stripped
bound nucleic acids (‘‘prArc(RNA�),’’ Figure S3A) as previously
performed on HIV Gag (Ganser et al., 1999). This procedure
reduced the A260/280 ratio significantly (prArc(RNA�) 0.68 ± 0.03,
prArc 1.04 ± 0.024; n = 3, p < 0.05) and we were unable to detect
Arc mRNA association by qRT-PCR (Figure 2D). Stripping RNA
resulted in significantly fewer fully formed capsids (Figure 2E),
suggesting that Arc capsids require RNA for normal assembly.
To show directly that RNA facilitated Arc capsid assembly, we
exogenously added GFP mRNA to prArc(RNA�) (7.3% w/w),
which resulted in significantly more fully formed Arc capsids.
Arc Protein and Arc mRNA Are Released by Neurons in
Extracellular Vesicles
Retroviral capsids and EVs are released from cells using similar
cellular machinery, such as the MVB pathway (Nolte-’t Hoen
et al., 2016). Since Arc exhibits many of the biochemical proper-
ties of a viral Gag protein, we tested whether Arc protein might
also be released from cells. We harvested media from Arc-trans-
fected HEK293 cells and purified the EV fraction. This fraction
contained vesicular structures that were < 100nm and resem-
bled exosomes (Figure S3B). Arc protein was detected in the
EV fraction, which was also positive for the EV marker ALIX,
but lacked actin (Figure 3A). Conversely, Arc-DCTD-transfected
HEK cells exhibited little expression in the EV fraction (Figure 3B),
suggesting that proper Arc capsid assembly may be required for
Arc release via EVs. We performed qRT-PCR on the EV fraction
from HEK cell media and detected Arc mRNA that was resistant
to RNase treatment (Figure 3C).
Native Arc protein was also found in the EV fraction prepared
from media harvested from DIV15 cultured cortical mouse neu-
rons (Figure 3D). Since Arc mRNA associates with Arc protein
in brain lysate, we used RT-PCR to show that Arc mRNA is
also present in EVs purified from neurons (Figure 3E). Arc protein
in EVs was resistant to trypsin digestion (Figure S3C), indicating
that Arc protein and RNA were protected or bound in a complex
within EVs. To directly determine whether Arc protein is present
in EVs, we conducted immunogold-labeling of endogenous Arc
in the EV fraction from cultured neurons and found that Arc is
present in a subpopulation of EVs (Figure 3F). To test whether
Arc release in EVs is activity dependent, we purified the EV frac-
tion from media collected from untreated or KCl-treated wild-
type (WT) cultured cortical neurons (Figure S3D). KCl treatment,
which increases neuronal activity, resulted in significantly more
Arc released into the media.

 Arc Mediates Intercellular Transfer of mRNA in
Extracellular Vesicles
Virus particles are able to infect cells through complex interac-
tions of the viral envelope and host cell membrane, while
EVs can also transfer cargo such as RNAs cell-to-cell (Valadi
et al., 2007). We predicted that Arc might be able to transfer
mRNA, either directly via mRNA encapsulated in prArc or in
Arc-containing EVs. We transfected GFP/myc-Arc or nuclear-
GFP into HEK (donor) cells and collected media from these cells
after 18 hr, which was then incubated with untransfected, naive
HEK (recipient/‘‘transferred’’) cells for 24 hr. We observed high
Arc expression in a sparse population of naive HEK cells (Fig-
ure 4A), while cells incubated with media from cells transfected
with nuclear-GFP alone did not express nuclear-GFP. Fluores-
cent in situ hybridization (FISH) for Arc mRNA revealed high
levels of Arc mRNA in recipient cells. Uptake of Arc protein
and mRNA was endocytosis-dependent, as application of Dy-
nasore (a potent inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis
[Macia et al., 2006]) significantly blocked transfer of Arc protein
(Figure S4A). Since encapsulation of RNA by Arc capsids is
nonspecific in vitro, we tested whether Arc could co-transfer
highly abundant mRNAs. Donor HEK cells were transfected
with myc-Arc and/or a membrane-bound GFP (mGFP), and me-
dia were collected after 24 hr. Recipient HEK cells showed clear
transfer of both GFP protein and mRNA when donor cells con-
tained Arc (Figure 4B). No transfer was observed from cells
transfected only with mGFP. These data suggest that Arc EVs
released from HEK cells are capable of transferring highly abun-
dant mRNAs cell-to-cell.
To test whether Arc capsids can transfer Arc mRNA into neu-
rons, we incubated cultured hippocampal neurons from Arc
knockout (KO) mice with prArc. Since the Arc KO line contains
GFP knocked into the Arc locus (Wang et al., 2006), we imaged
Arc in the red channel and were unable to detect GFP

 fluorescence in the green channel (Figure S4B). We observed
uptake of Arc protein into KO neurons above antibody back-
ground levels (see Figure S4C for antibody specificity) within
1h of protein incubation, which peaked around 4h of incubation
(Figure 5A). To directly determine whether Arc capsids can trans-
fer Arc mRNA into neurons, we measured Arc mRNA levels in Arc
KO neurons incubated with prArc. Arc FISH showed robust and
high levels of transferred Arc mRNA after 4h of incubation with
prArc (Figure 5B). RNase treatment of prArc prior to incubation
had no effect on mRNA transfer (Figure S5A), further suggesting
that Arc capsids are able to protect and encapsulate Arc mRNA.
Blocking endocytosis using Dynasore prevented uptake of both
prArc protein and Arc mRNA (Figure S5B). Transferred mRNA
and protein were evident both in early endosomes (marked by
Rab5) and non-endosome compartments in dendrites (Fig-
ure S5C). Both uptake and transfer of purified prArc-DCTD and
CA-prArc protein and mRNA was significantly less than the
full-length protein, indicating that capsid formation is required
for uptake into neurons (Figures 5C and 5D). Lack of protein up-
take was not due to poor detection by the custom-made
Arc polyclonal antibody (Figure S5D). Strikingly, prArc(RNA�)
was unable to be taken up but instead coated the outside of neu-
rons (Figure S6), further suggesting that intact Arc capsids are
required for uptake and transfer.
To test whether endogenous Arc can transfer mRNA, we incu-
bated Arc KO cultured hippocampal neurons with purified EVs

 prepared from media from WT or KO cortical neurons. Arc KO
neurons incubated with WT EVs showed a clear increase in den-
dritic Arc levels, while KO neurons incubated with EVs derived
from KO cells exhibited no increase in dendritic Arc levels (Fig-
ure 6A). In addition, FISH showed that Arc mRNA in WT EVs
was transferred into KO neurons (Figure 6B). Uptake of Arc
mRNA was not significantly affected by prior treatment of EVs
with RNase (Figure S7A), indicating that uptake was not due to
free or unbound Arc mRNA in the EV fraction. Blocking endocy-
tosis with Dynasore prevented the uptake of Arc protein and
mRNA from EVs (Figure S7B). Notably, transferred Arc mRNA
expression exhibited cell-wide localization in both early endo-
somes and non-endosome compartments (Figure S7C) and
was virtually indistinguishable from Arc mRNA distribution in
WT neurons. These data indicate that endogenous Arc released
via EVs is able to transfer Arc mRNA neuron-to-neuron.

 Transferred Arc mRNA Can Undergo Activity-Dependent

If Arc mRNA associated with Arc capsids is transferred into the
cytoplasm of neurons, we predicted that we would observe an
increase in dendritic Arc protein by inducing translation of Arc
mRNA through activation of the group 1 metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGluR1/5) by the agonist DHPG, as previously shown
for endogenous Arc (Waung et al., 2008). As predicted, Arc

hibited an increase in dendritic Arc levels
that was also dependent on protein synthe-
sis (Figure 7B). Although these experiments
cannot
definitively
distinguish
de
novo
translated Arc from protein that was taken
up, these data suggest that Arc capsids or
EVs are capable of transferring Arc mRNA
between neurons and that this mRNA is
available in the cytoplasm of dendrites for
activity-dependent translation.
DISCUSSION
Here, we show that mammalian Arc protein
exhibits many hallmarks of Gag proteins en-
coded by retroviruses and retrotranspo-
sons:
self-assembly
into
capsids,
RNA
encapsulation, release in EVs, and intercel-
lular transmission of RNA. These data suggest that Arc can
mediate intercellular trafficking of mRNA via Arc EVs (which we
term ‘‘ACBARs’’ for ‘‘Arc Capsids Bearing Any RNA’’), revealing
a novel molecular mechanism by which genetic information may
be transferred between neurons.

 Arc Functions as a Repurposed Gag Protein
Our data show a remarkable conservation of viral Gag properties
in Arc. Since Arc shows structural homology to the Gag CA
domain (Zhang et al., 2015), the capability of self-assembly
into oligomeric capsids is perhaps not too surprising. However,
Arc seems to retain other important biochemical properties of
Gag that are not intuitive from its sequence. Despite lacking clear
zinc-finger RNA binding domains such as in HIV Gag, Arc encap-
sulates RNA, and RNA binding seems critical for capsid forma-
tion. This is reminiscent of Foamy Virus Gags, which have
evolved different RNA-binding motifs to HIV Gag (Hamann and
Lindemann, 2016) and also structurally resemble Arc (Taylor
et al., 2017). HIV Gag-RNA interactions are complex and involve
multiple components of Gag, including the MA domain, and are
regulated by host cellular factors (Mailler et al., 2016). Gag MA-
RNA interactions are also critical for virus particle formation at
membranes (Kutluay et al., 2014). Moreover, if viral RNA is not
present, Gag encapsulates host RNA, and any single-stranded
nucleic acid longer than �20–30 nt can support capsid assembly
(Campbell and Rein, 1999), indicating a general propensity to
bind abundant RNA. Indeed, precisely how viral RNA is preferen-
tially packaged into Gag capsids in cells remains an intensive
area of investigation (Comas-Garcia et al., 2016).
The uptake and transfer of RNA by purified Arc protein is sur-
prising as this occurs in the absence of an ‘‘envelope’’ or lipid
bilayer. Uptake of both purified Arc capsids and endogenous
EVs occurs through endocytosis. While EVs and exosomes are
easily taken up through the endosomal pathway, it remains un-
clear how RNA can cross the endosomal membrane without
membrane fusion proteins (Tkach and The
´ ry, 2016). Our data
suggest that, like non-enveloped viruses, Arc protein itself con-
tains the ability to transfer RNA across the endosomal mem-
brane. While it remains unclear how non-enveloped capsids
transfer RNA into the cytoplasm, some studies suggest this
could occur through specific receptor-capsid interactions, or
via a pH-dependent conformational change of the capsid that
allows either pore formation or lytic degradation of membranes
(Tsai, 2007). We speculate that Arc protein may interact with
the endosomal membrane to allow transfer of mRNA into the
cytoplasm as the capsid is disassembled. This is reflected in
the lag between protein uptake and mRNA expression seen in
our experiments, which may be a result of the time it takes for
mRNA to become accessible to our FISH probes. The lipid mem-
brane around ACBARs in vivo may dictate targeting and uptake,
whereas the Arc capsid within protects and allows transfer of
RNA. Intriguingly, prArc that lacks RNA is unable to form capsids
and cannot be taken up, suggesting uptake may be a regulated
process that requires properly formed capsids. Since Arc seems
to regulate a naturally occurring mechanism of RNA transfer, we
believe that harnessing this pathway may allow new means of
genetic engineering or RNA delivery into cells, using ACBARs,
that may avoid the hurdle of immune activation.
Arc’s Gag Homology Reveals a New Signaling Pathway in
Neurons
Exosome and EV signaling has emerged as a critical mechanism
of intercellular communication, especially in the immune system
and in cancer biology (Becker et al., 2016). However, the role of
intercellular signaling through EVs in the nervous system has
only recently been investigated, with studies suggesting that
these pathways may play important roles in synaptic plasticity
(Budnik et al., 2016; Zappulli et al., 2016). Canonical exosomes
are formed in MVBs, which are derived from the endosomal
pathway and usually require the ESCRT complex to be released
(Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013), although the biogenesis of EVs
in general is more varied. HIV Gag is able to form virions indepen-
dent of the MVB pathway, although the ESCRT machinery is still
required for particle release; thus, Arc may form ACBARs inde-
pendent of the canonical exosome pathway. These pathways
are not mutually exclusive, and elucidating the biogenesis of
ACBARs within neurons will require further investigation.
Since Arc is rapidly synthesized locally in dendrites (Park et al.,
2008; Waung et al., 2008), it is conceivable that high local con-
centrations of Arc protein promote capsid assembly in dendrites
where encapsulation of dendritically localized mRNAs could
occur. Since Arc capsids do not seem to show specificity in
RNA binding in vitro and Arc EVs can transfer highly abundant
mRNAs, we speculate that the specificity of ACBAR cargo is
conferred by the precise spatial and temporal expression of
Arc protein in neurons (Figure S7D). Consistent with the identifi-
cation of Arc mRNA associated with Arc protein from brain, Arc
mRNA levels are highly and uniquely abundant in dendrites in vivo
after bouts of neuronal activity or experience (de Solis et al.,
2017). Gag-RNA interactions are regulated by host cellular pro-
teins such as Staufen (Mouland et al., 2000), a protein that is
also a critical regulator of dendritic mRNA trafficking in neurons,
including Arc mRNA (Heraud-Farlow and Kiebler, 2014). The par-
allels between dendritic mRNA regulation and virus-RNA interac-
tions are striking, suggesting that cellular factors may play an
important role in ACBAR biogenesis and RNA packing. Many
questions remain: What other cargo do ACBARs contain?
What are the docking mechanisms for ACBARs? Is there
spatial/temporal specificity of intercellular signaling in the brain?
Our data also indicate that Arc may mediate intercellular
signaling to control synaptic function and plasticity in a non-
cell-autonomous manner. Although there is a paucity of data
on neuronal EVs, previous studies have shown that EVs can be
secreted in an activity-dependent manner and include AMPARs
as cargo (Faure
´ et al., 2006). Since Arc has previously been impli-
cated in AMPAR trafficking at synapses and spine elimination
(Chowdhury et al., 2006; Mikuni et al., 2013) at weak synapses
(Okuno et al., 2012), a potential role for ACBARs may be to
eliminate synaptic material. Arc also regulates homeostatic
forms of plasticity, such as AMPAR scaling (Shepherd et al.,
2006) and cross-modal plasticity across different brain regions
(Kraft et al., 2017), which could be regulated at the circuit level
in a non-cell autonomous manner. We favor the idea that
released Arc functions to carry intercellular cargo that alters
the state of neighboring cells required for cellular consolidation
of information.
Previous studies have shown that Drosophila neuromuscular
junction plasticity requires trans-synaptic signaling mediated
through the Wnt pathway in exosomes (Korkut et al., 2009). Inter-
estingly, the Drosophila Arc homolog dArc1 exhibits similar
properties of intercellular transfer of mRNA in the fly nervous sys-
tem and is one of the most abundant proteins in Drosophila EVs

 (Ashley et al., 2018; Lefebvre et al., 2016), suggesting a remark-
able convergence of biology despite a large evolutionary diver-
gence of these species. A recent study has also implicated
Arc in the mammalian immune system (Ufer et al., 2016), where
it controls dendritic cell-dependent T cell activation, expanding
the potential repertoire and importance of Arc-dependent inter-
cellular signaling beyond the nervous system. Moreover, EVs
have been implicated in the pathology of various neurodegen-
erative disorders, as several pathogenic proteins, such as
prions, b-amyloid peptide, and a-synuclein, are released from
cells in association with EVs (Zappulli et al., 2016). In AD,
immunohistochemical analysis in brain sections from patients
with AD showed enrichment of the exosomal marker ALIX
around neuritic plaques (Rajendran et al., 2006). This suggests
that EVs may provide a significant source of extracellular Ab
peptide. Arc regulates the activity-dependent cleavage of
APP and b-amyloid production through interactions with prese-
nilin (Wu et al., 2011), suggesting that ACBARs may also be
involved in AD pathogenesis.
Evolution of Synaptic Plasticity and Cognition
Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons are ancient mobile elements that
are widely distributed and often abundant in eukaryotic ge-
nomes and are considered ancestral to modern retroviruses
(Malik et al., 2000). There is evidence that coding sequences
derived from Ty3/gypsy and other retroviral-like elements
have been repurposed for cellular functions repeatedly during
evolution (Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012). For instance, multiple
envelope genes of retroviral origins have been co-opted dur-
ing mammalian evolution to promote cell-cell fusion and syn-
cytiotrophoblast formation in the developing placenta (Corne-
lis et al., 2015). There are more than one hundred Gag-derived
genes in the human genome alone (Campillos et al., 2006),
and genetic KOs of their murine orthologs have revealed
that some, like Arc, are essential for cognition (Irie et al.,
2015). However, the molecular function of these Gag-derived
proteins has been poorly characterized, and whether they
were co-opted to serve similar cellular processes remains
an open question. This study and the accompanying article
from Ashley et al. (2018) now reveal that two distantly related
Gag-derived genes have been independently co-opted in fly
and tetrapod ancestors to participate in a similar process of
EV-dependent intercellular trafficking of RNA in the nervous
system. Given the plethora of retroelements populating eu-
karyotic genomes, we speculate that many other Gag proteins
have been repurposed for cellular processes that await dis-
covery in a variety of organisms.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines
HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC (#CRL-11268). Cells were maintained at 37�C with 5% CO2 in DMEM media supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and passaged every
3-4 days at 70% confluency. For transfections and transfer experiments, HEK cells were seeded to 10-cm dishes or collagen-coated
glass coverslips in 12-well plates.
Mouse models
Wild-type and Arc knock-out mice
C57BL/6 Arc knock-out (KO) mice (C57BL/6-Arctm1Stl/J, a kind gift from Dr. Kuan Wang, NIH) have GFP knocked in to the Arc ORF
(Wang et al., 2006). Arc KO and wild-type (WT) mice used in these studies were littermates from heterozygous (Arc+/�) crosses. Both
male and female mice were used. No differences between sexes in the experiments conducted in this study were noted, and data
from both sexes were therefore grouped together. Mice were housed in breeding pairs, or group-housed with littermates of the same
sex after weaning (2-5 mice/cage), on a 12:12 h day:night cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. Hippocampal and cortical
primary neuron cultures were prepared from E18 embryos, while brain lysates were taken from P30-50 mice. Mice were test- and
procedure-naive before terminal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Utah.
Primary neuron culture
Primary neuron cultures were prepared from male and female E18 Arc KO or WT mouse cortex and hippocampus as previously
described (Shepherd et al., 2006). Tissue was dissociated in DNase (0.01%; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and papain (0.067%; Wor-
thington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ), and then triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells
were pelleted at 500xg for 4 min, the supernatant removed, and cells resuspended and counted with a TC-20 cell counter (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Neurons were plated on glass coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, NC) coated with poly-L-lysine
(0.2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in 12-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) at 90,000 cells/mL, or in 10-cm plastic dishes at
800,000 cells/mL. Neurons were initially plated in Neurobasal media containing 5% horse serum, 2% GlutaMAX, 2% B-27, and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 37�C incubator with 5% CO2. On DIV4, neurons were fed via half media
exchange with astrocyte-conditioned Neurobasal media containing 1% horse serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin,
2% B-27, and 5 mM cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were fed with astrocyte-conditioned media
every three days thereafter.
METHOD DETAILS
Plasmids
The open reading frame (ORF) of full-length rat Arc (NP_062234.1) cDNA was subcloned from pRK5-myc-Arc. The insert was ampli-
fied by PCR, digested with BamH1 and Xho1, and ligated into the pGEX-6p1 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) expression vector

 between the BamH1 and Xho1 restrictions sites. The GST-Arc ORF was similarly amplified and cloned into the pFastBac1 vector
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) between the BamH1 and Xho1 restriction sites. prArc-DCTD was generated by blunt end cloning after
PCR amplification of the Arc ORF from pGEX-6p1-Arc, excluding sequence coding aas 277-374. aas 195-364 of the Arc ORF
(CA-prArc) was similarly cloned into the pET11a vector, which contained a His tag. pBluescript-SKII-GFP was generated by restric-
tion digest of mEGFP (BBA16881.1) from pGL4.11-arc7000-mEGFP-ArcUTRs (generously provided by Dr. Haruhiko Bito, University
of Tokyo) and subsequent ligation into the KpnI and SacI restriction sites flanking the insert in pBluescript-SKII-ArcUTRs plasmid
(generously provided by Dr. Kristen Keefe, University of Utah). The pGEX-4T-1 Drosophila Arc1 (NP_610955.1) construct was pro-
vided by Dr. Mark Metzstein, University of Utah. EGFP-C3-Arc and pRK5-myc-Arc were generously provided by Dr. Kimberly Huber
(UT Southwestern) and Dr. Paul Worley (Johns Hopkins University), respectively. All protein expression constructs were transformed
into DH5a E. coli cells and individual colonies were screened by Sanger Sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ) sequencing ser-
vices, using primers synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Trace files were analyzed using A Plasmid Editor
(APE) freeware available from the University of Utah. Sequenced verified constructs were then transformed into BL21-DE3 bacterial
cells for protein expression. See Table S1 for specific oligo primer sequences.
Protein purification
Starter bacteria cultures for protein expression were grown overnight at 37�C in LB supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphen-
icol. Starter cultures were used to inoculate large-scale 500 mL cultures of ZY auto-induction media. Large-scale cultures were
grown to OD600 of 0.6-0.8 at 37�C at 150 rpm and then shifted to 19�C at 150 rpm for 16-20 h. Cultures were then pelleted at
5000xg for 15 min at 4�C and cell pellets were resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 5% glycerol, 1 mM
DTT, pH 8.0 at room temperature (RT) for Arc constructs and GST; 300 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4
at RT for Endophilin3A) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen pellets were thawed quickly at 37�C and brought to a final volume
of 1 g pellet:10 mL lysis buffer, supplemented with DNase, lysozyme, aprotinin, leupeptin, PMSF, and pepstatin. Lysates were then
sonicated for 8-10x45 s pulses at 90% duty cycle and pelleted for 45 min at 21,000xg. For GST-tagged constructs, cleared super-
natants were then passed through a 0.45 mm filter and incubated with pre-equilibrated GST Sepharose 4B affinity resin in a gravity
flow column overnight at 4�C. Bound protein was then washed twice with two column volumes (20 resin bed volumes each) of lysis
buffer, re-equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2 at RT, and cleaved on-resin overnight at 4�C
with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) for the GST-tagged constructs, or thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) for dArc1. Cleaved proteins
were then buffer exchanged to 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT to kill protease activity, run on an S200 size exclusion column
to separate the cleaved protein, and peak fractions were pooled. GST was affinity-purified as described above using Sepharose 4B
resin and eluted directly using 15 mM reduced L-glutathione, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT. His-tagged CA-prArc was affinity-purified as
described above using Ni+ resin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and eluted directly using 250 mM imidazole, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT.
GST and CA-prArc were then buffer exchanged to 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT. To strip Arc protein of nucleic acids for
prArc(RNA-) preparations, cell pellets were lysed in 20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 5% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0 at RT as
described above. Nucleic acids were precipitated from cell supernatants by dropwise addition of 10% PEI, pH 8.0 to a final concen-
tration of 0.1% followed by incubation at 4�C for 20 min and pelleting for 20 min at 27,000xg. The resulting supernatant was then
precipitated by addition of saturated ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 30%. Precipitated protein was pelleted at
10,000xg for 10 min, resuspended in 60 mL lysis buffer, and affinity purified. The cleaved affinity-purified product was then dialyzed
to Q-column buffer A (Q-A; 20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT) overnight. Dialyzed protein was then subjected to anion exchange
chromatography (HiTrap Q, GE Healthcare) with a gradient of Q-A buffer to Q-B buffer (1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4). Average yields
for purified proteins were 10.5 mg (8-13 mg) per liter of cell culture.
Electron microscopy
Negative stain
For all negative stain specimens, copper 200-mesh grids coated with Formvar and carbon (Electron Microscopy Sciences or Ted
Pella, Redding, CA) were glow discharged for 20-45 s in a vacuum chamber at 30mA. 3.5 mL sample was then applied to the grid
for 35-45 s and excess sample was wicked away using filter paper. Grids were then immediately washed 2-4x for 5 s with 30 mL water
droplets, then once with 1% uranyl acetate (UA) on parafilm. Excess water/UA was wicked away and then a final droplet of UA was
applied for 30 s. Excess UA was wicked away and grids were air-dried for 30-60 s. Imaging was performed using either an FEI T12,
FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope operated at 120 kV equipped with a Gatan Orius SC200B CCD camera or JEOL 1400 electron
microscope.
Cryo-EM
Purified Arc protein was dialysed into 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and concentrated twice using Amicon 100 MWCO centrifugal
filters (Millipore, Burlington, MA) to yield a final protein concentration of �2 mg/mL. 10 nm diameter gold beads were added to the
sample. Degassed 2/2-3C C-flat grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) were glow discharged for 45 s at 30 mA. Sample
was applied to the grid 2 times for 30 s, and the grid was plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Micrographs were
acquired using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operated at 200 kV, equipped with a FEI Falcon II direct detector. The nominal de-
focus was 1.3 mm.

 EM quantification
Grids were surveyed visually to check for uniformity of sample application. For each experiment, six images were taken from
randomly selected grid squares. Full and partially formed particles between 20-40 nm were then counted manually using ImageJ.
Counts were then divided by the image field of view (2.07 mm2) and data presented as oligomer count/mm2.
Arc capsid assembly assay
GFP mRNA was added to prArc(RNA-) (5 mg/mL in low salt buffer: 20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at RT) at a nucleic acid:protein
ratio of 7.3% (w/w) (corresponding to 1 molecule of Arc to 10 nucleotides). Reactions were then diluted to 1 mg/mL of prArc(RNA-) by
dropwise addition of low salt buffer or capsid assembly buffer (500 mM NaPO4, 50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 at RT) and incu-
bated for 2 h at RT. Following incubation, negative stain EM grids were prepared of each reaction at 0.25 mg/mL and capsid formation
was quantified by manual counting of 6 images. Fully formed capsids included spherical particles between 20-50 nm with clear dou-
ble shells. Similar results were seen in three independent protein preparations.
Dynamic light scattering
Purified Arc protein was subjected to dynamic light scattering measurements on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZSP instrument. The scat-
tering was carried out at 25�C and at a fixed angle of 173� (backward scattering). The scattered intensity is represented as number of
particles under the assumption that the scattering intensity from spherical particles is proportional to the size to the sixth power.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
NCBI genome sequence databases were queried using the human or Drosophila melanogaster Arc protein sequence using tBLASTn.
Repbase was also queried using the CENSOR program to identify known repeat families with high sequence similarity to mammalian
or brachyceran Arc genes, respectively. The following sequence IDs were used for analysis: (GenBank locus) Mm ARC—
AHBB01089569; Hs ARC—LIQK02016549; Ac ARC—AAWZ02020354; Lc gypsy2—AFYH01030203; CC gypsy—LHQP01046008;
Dm ARC1—JSAE01000572; Ds ARC1—CAKG01020471; Sc ARC1—LDNW01019671; Dm ARC2—JXOZ01003752; Ds ARC2—
AWUT01001000; Sc ARC2—LDNW01019670; Bm gypsy—BABH01046987; Tc gypsy—AAJJ02003810. Repbase: Lc gypsy—
Gypsy2-1-I_Lch; Dr gypsy26—Gypsy-26-I_DR; Lh gypsy11—Gypsy-11_LH-I; Dm gypsy1—Gypsy1-I_DM; ty3—TY3. Protein (Arc
and Gag) sequences that were found to have high similarity to Arc proteins and Gags of other related Ty3/gypsy elements were
aligned using the MUSCLE program. Trimmed Arc/Gag alignments were uploaded to MEGA7 for subsequent maximum likelihood
phylogenetic reconstruction using default parameters, and 500 bootstrap iterations were performed to generate a lineage tree.
Drosophila melanogaster dArc1 and dArc2 protein sequences were used to query schizophoran fly protein databases using BLASTp.
More hits were observed than expected if darc1 were present in one-to-one orthologs in the species examined. Protein FASTA se-
quences were aligned using MUSCLE and a maximum likelihood phylogram was generated using MEGA.
HEK cell experiments
Transfections
HEK cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine (PEI) at a ratio of 3 mg PEI:1 mg DNA diluted in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). Cells were transfected at approximately 60%–70% confluency. For EV isolation and media transfer experiments, culture media
was exchanged 4-6 h post-transfection to remove PEI and DNA, and media was harvested 24 h later.
Transfection and transfer
Media from transfected HEK cells was harvested 24 h post-transfection and centrifuged at 500xg for 4 min to remove dead cells and
debris. Media from untransfected, naive cells was removed and replaced with the cleared transfected media and incubated for an
additional 24 h. Following incubation, cells were fixed and combined immunocytochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization (ICC/
FISH) for Arc or GFP protein and RNA was performed as described below.
Endocytosis blockade
To block endocytosis, a group of naive HEK cells plated on coverslips in 12-well plates that were receiving media from GFP-Arc-
transfected HEK cells were treated at the same time with 80 mM Dynasore (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for the first 6 h, then the media
was removed and replaced with fresh HEK media. 18 h later, Dynasore-treated and untreated HEK cells were fixed. The entire 18-mm
coverslip was viewed with a 20x objective and the number of clusters of GFP-Arc-transferred cells was manually counted. Repre-
sentative images were obtained using a 20X objective on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
Neuron transfer experiments
DIV15 cultured neurons were used for all neuronal experiments. For purified Arc protein incubation experiments, neurons were
treated with 4 mg of purified prArc, prArc-DCTD, CA-prArc, or prArc(RNA-) protein in normal neuronal feeding media and incubated
for 1 or 4 h. For extracellular vesicle (EV) incubation experiments, neurons were treated with 10 mg protein from the purified EV
fraction obtained from eight 10-cm dishes of DIV15 cultured cortical neurons in which E18 WT cortical neurons had been plated
at 800,000 cells/mL (see ‘‘Cell Culture’’ methods), and incubated for 1 or 4 h. A subset of neurons in the purified protein- and EV-
treated experiments was treated with 100 mM of the group 1 mGluR agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3,5-DHPG; Tocris Biosci-
ence, Bristol, UK) for 5 min, which was then washed out and replaced with previously conditioned neuronal media, and neurons were
allowed to rest for 25 min before fixation. To block protein translation during DHPG treatment, a subset of neurons was pretreated
Cell 172, 275–288.e1–e9, January 11, 2018
e5
 with 180 mM cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma-Aldrich) 30 min before DHPG. CHX was left in the media for 1 h total. To block endocytosis,
neurons were pretreated with 80 mM Dynasore (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 30 min before adding purified protein. For RNase treat-
ments, a sample of either prArc or WT EV was incubated with RNase A (1:1000; Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA) for 15 min, then
SUPERase-In RNase Inhibitor (1 U/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) immediately before being added to neurons. The treated samples
were then added to neurons and incubated for 4 h.
Immunocytochemistry
After treatments, neurons were washed twice with 37�C 4% sucrose/1X phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS; 10X: 1.4 M NaCl, 26.8 mM
KCl, 62 mM Na2HPO4, 35.3 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4), then fixed for 15 min with 4% sucrose/4% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
in 1X PBS. Neurons were washed 3 3 5 min with 1X PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Amresco, Solon, OH) in 1X
PBS, and blocked for 30 min in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in 1X PBS. Neurons were then
incubated in primary antibody diluted in block for 1 h at RT, washed 3 3 5 min in 1X PBS, and incubated in secondary antibody diluted
in block for 1 h at RT. Neurons on coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Fluoromount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dried over-
night at RT. Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-Arc (1:1000; custom-made; ProteinTech, Rosemont, IL); rabbit anti-Arc
(1:1000; Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany); chicken anti-MAP2 (1:5000; ab5392; Abcam); mouse anti-Rab5 (1:1000; BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA); DAPI nuclear stain (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa
Fluor 405, 488, 555, or 647 for the appropriate animal host (1:750; Thermo Fisher Scientific or Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Combined FISH/ICC in neurons and HEK cells
The fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure for Arc and GFP was based on a previously published protocol (Daberkow et al.,
2007). We used a full-length rat Arc ribonucleotide probe (rat and mouse Arc are 99% identical at the aa level) or EGFP (see cloning
strategy above in ‘‘Plasmids’’) as in the published protocol, but modified the protocol for use in cultured neurons and HEK cells
instead of brain sections. Arc and GFP plasmids were linearized with Not1 and purified via standard phenol/chloroform extraction.
The linearized antisense Arc or GFP were used to make a ribonucleotide probe that had DIG-UTP incorporated using a T7 DIG RNA
labeling kit (Sigma-Aldrich), then purified with a G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare). Cells were washed once with 37�C 4% sucrose/
1X PBS, then fixed for 15 min with 4% sucrose/4% formaldehyde in 1X PBS. Cells were washed 3 3 5 min with 1X PBS, permea-
bilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed 2 3 5 min in 1X PBS, then 5 min with 2X saline-sodium citrate (SSC; 20X: 3 M
NaCl, 300 mM citric acid trisodium salt dihydrate, pH 7). Cells were prehybridized in 1X prehybridization solution (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 30 min. The DIG-labeled Arc or GFP ribonucleotide probe was diluted 1:3 with ddH2O, denatured at 90�C for 5 min, put on
wet ice for 2 min, then mixed with RNA hybridization buffer (23.75 mM Tris-HCl, 1.19 mM EDTA, 357 mM NaCl, 11.9% dextran sulfate,
1.19X Denhardt’s solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5% nuclease-free water, 60% formamide (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH)).
The Arc probe (1:500) or GFP probe (1:750) was hybridized to the cultured cells at 56�C for 16 h. The following day, cells underwent a
series of washes to decrease background signal: 3 3 5 min 2X SSC, 15 min in RNase A (1:1000; Omega Bio-tek) at 37�C, 10 min 2X
SSC at RT, 10 min 0.2X SSC at RT, 15 min 0.2X SSC at 56�C, 10 min 0.2X SSC at RT, 5 min TNT (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl,
0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5). Cells were then blocked in TNB (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% w/v blocking reagent (Sigma-Aldrich),
pH 7.5) with 2.5% sheep serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 2.5% donkey serum for 30 min. In the primary antibody step, a DIG-
HRP (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) and either MAP2 (1:2500; Abcam), Arc (1:500; custom-made), or Rab5 (1:500; BD Biosciences)
antibody were diluted together in TNB with 2.5% sheep serum and 2.5% donkey serum and incubated on the cells for 1 h. After
3 3 5 min washes in TNT, the DIG-HRP signal was developed using a TSA Plus Cyanine 3 kit (1:50; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA)
for 30 min. Cells were washed for 5 min in TNT and 5 min in 1X PBS, then secondary antibody was diluted 1:750 in 5% donkey serum
and 1X PBS and incubated on the cells for 1 h to detect MAP2, Arc, or Rab5. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
then coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount and dried overnight at RT.
Cell imaging and analysis
Imaging
Coverslips were imaged using a 60X oil objective on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and images were
analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Neurons included for analysis were selected in an un-
biased manner by looking at MAP2 dendritic morphology for cell health. Coverslips were viewed blind to find the brightest immuno-
fluorescence in each independent experiment, and this value was then used to set the image acquisition settings for that experiment.
Images from all coverslips in that experiment were then acquired using the exact same settings.
Analysis of dendritic Arc protein and mRNA expression
During analysis, images were blindly thresholded (to remove background fluorescence and to ensure images were analyzed in the
linear range) to the brightest immunofluorescence in an individual experiment, and the same threshold was applied to all other images
in that experiment. Integrated density (average pixel intensity x area) of two 30-mm dendritic segments/neuron was measured from
each coverslip. In general, thick proximal dendritic branches were avoided in our analysis to control for potential differences in den-
dritic volume. The KO control group in each experiment, whether ICC or FISH, was set as ‘‘1,’’ and the integrated density values in the
other groups were normalized to this and are displayed in the graphs as fold-change ± SEM. For representative images in the figures,
the Smart look-up table (LUT) in ImageJ was applied to highlight differences in Arc expression between groups.

 Analysis of Arc/Rab5 colocalization
Two 30-mm dendritic segments/neuron were selected for analysis of Arc protein or mRNA colocalization with Rab5 protein. The Arc
channel and Rab5 channel were thresholded to the same value across all images. Using ImageJ, a mask was made of the thresh-
olded section of dendrite for both Rab5 and Arc. The Arc mask was applied to the Rab5 mask and the number of overlapping puncta
was quantified. The number of Arc particles overlapping Rab5 was divided by the total number of Arc particles in the stretch of
dendrite to determine the Arc/Rab5 colocalization.
Western blots
Immunoblotting and analysis
Western blot samples were mixed with 4X Laemlli buffer (40% glycerol, 250 mM Tris, 4% SDS, 50 mM DTT, pH 6.8) and heated at
70�C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was used to separate protein samples. Separated samples were transferred to a nitro-
cellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Following transfer, membranes were briefly stained with 0.1% Ponceau stain, then destained
with 1% acetic acid to remove background, for imaging of total protein. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk + 1X tris-buffered saline
(TBS; 10X: 152.3 mM Tris-HCl, 46.2 mM Tris base, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 7.6) for 30 min at RT, then incubated in primary antibody in 1X TBS
for either 1 h at RT or overnight at 4�C. Membranes were washed 3 3 10 min in 1X TBS, then incubated in an HRP-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in block for 1 h at RT. After 3 3 10 min in 1X TBS, a chemiluminescent kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) was used to detect the protein bands, and the membranes were imaged on an Azure c300 gel dock (Azure Biosystems,
Dublin, CA). Blots were analyzed and quantified using the Gel Analysis plugin in ImageJ.
Antibodies
Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: Arc (1:000; mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz), Arc (1:000; rabbit polyclonal,
custom, Protein Tech), ALIX (1:500; rabbit polyclonal, custom, provided by Dr. Wesley Sundquist), actin (1:1000; HRP-conjugated,
Abcam), GFP (1:1000; chicken polyclonal, Aves). All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 (HRP-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, goat anti-chicken, Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Coomassie gels
Samples for analysis via SDS-PAGE were mixed with 4X Laemlli buffer and heated at 70�C for 5 min. Protein samples were separated
on 10% SDS gels. Gels were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue stain (0.1% w/v Coomassie blue, 50% methanol, 10% acetic
acid, 40% water) for 30 min and destained overnight in destain solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 40% water). Gels were
visualized using an Azure c300 gel dock under the auto-exposure setting on the visible channel. Gel exposures were analyzed
and quantified using the Gel Analysis plugin in ImageJ.
Immunoprecipitation
WT and Arc KO cortices were dissected out and homogenized in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deox-
ycholate, 0.05% SDS, pH 7.4 (IP lysis buffer), with protease inhibitor added fresh (Roche). Homogenates were pelleted at 200xg for
5 min at 4�C to remove tissue debris. Supernatants were removed, diluted from 2 mL to 4 mL, and rocked at 4�C for 10 min before
being pelleted at 17,000xg for 10 min at 4�C to remove insoluble material. Cleared supernatants were removed, a small aliquot was
taken as the input, and the remainder used for immunoprecipitation. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either Arc antibody
(rabbit polyclonal, custom-made; Protein Tech) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1 mg/500 mL
lysate for 2 h at 4�C with gentle rocking. Following antibody incubation, a 10% volume of washed 50/50 Protein A bead slurry (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was added to the antibody/lysate mixture and incubated for an additional hour at 4�C with rocking. Bead-antibody
complexes were then pelleted briefly at low speed, supernatants were removed, and beads were washed three times with IP buffer.
Washed beads were then resuspended in 200 mL IP buffer. With half of the bead slurry, protein was eluted from the beads with 17 mL
4X Laemlli buffer for 5 min at RT, then 50 mL IP buffer was added and the solution was removed from the beads into a new tube and
heated at 70�C for 5 min. The input (10% lysate volume) and 30 mL each of the IgG and antibody elutions were separated by SDS-
PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and immunoblotted as described above. The bands for the input and IgG and Arc elutions were
analyzed using the Gel Analysis plugin in ImageJ, and the data were represented graphically as a ratio of the signal from each elution
over the input signal from each individual mouse. With the other half of the bead slurry, the IP buffer was adjusted to 1% SDS and
0.8 mg Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was added. Samples were then incubated at RT for 30 min with rocking and
total RNA was extracted as described below.
Chemical crosslinking of Arc proteins in situ
Transfected HEK cells expressing myc-Arc-WT or a GFP control were briefly trypsinized, quenched with DMEM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), and pelleted. Media was removed and pelleted cells were then crosslinked with 0.4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min
with rocking at RT. Cell suspensions were immediately quenched with Tris to a final concentration of 50 mM and repelleted.
Supernatants were removed and cell pellets were then lysed with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer)
for 20 min at 4�C with rocking. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000xg for 10 min at 4�C and cleared supernatants were
then run on a 4%–8% gradient gel and analyzed via western blot with antibodies for Arc (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz) and GFP
(chicken polyclonal, Aves).
Cell 172, 275–288.e1–e9, January 11, 2018
e7
 RNA extraction
For all samples, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TRIzol-extracted samples were mixed 5:1 with chlo-
roform, incubated at RT for 3 min, and pelleted at 12,000xg at 4�C for 10 min. The resulting aqueous phase was taken and mixed 1:1
with isopropanol, incubated at RT, and pelleted at 12,000xg at 4�C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and pellet
washed with cold 75% ethanol. Washed pellets were then repelleted at 7500xg for 5 min at 4�C. The supernatant was removed
and dried pellets were resuspended in ddH2O.
RT-PCR
Total RNA concentrations were measured by A260/280 on a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). Reverse transcription reactions were car-
ried out using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 100-200 ng of RNA as tem-
plate. Resulting cDNAs were amplified using rat Arc, GAPDH primer sets for 35 cycles with a 60�C annealing temperature. Resulting
PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Rat Arc primers: Fwd,
ACCATATGACCACCGGCGGC; Rev, TCCAGCATCTCAGCTCGGCAC. GAPDH primers: Fwd, CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA; Rev,
GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTT. RT-PCR gels were quantified using the ImageJ gel analyzer tool.
qRT-PCR
To determine the amount of RNA associated with Arc protein, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on mRNA prepared from 1: whole
mouse cortices immunoprecipitated with Arc and IgG protein, 2: EV fractions prepared from HEK cells (see below, ‘‘Extracellular
vesicle purification’’), and 3: lysate and purified protein from bacteria (BL21, Thermo Fisher Scientific) transfected with rat Arc plasmid
(pGEX-GST-ArcFL). Some samples were treated with RNase (25 mg, RNase A, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to determine if the mRNA
associated with Arc protein was protected from degradation relative to exogenously added GFP antisense RNA (generating using
T7 RNA polymerase from linearized pBluescript-SKII-GFP). Preparation 1: Mice were sacrificed after 24 h of dark-housing and 2 h
of enriched environment. Whole cortices were dissected and homogenized in IP lysis buffer as described above. After immunopre-
cipitation, bead slurry was incubated in guanidine thiocyanate containing RLT lysis buffer and column purification of RNA was
performed using QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Total eluate was used for reverse transcription using
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with 50 U of Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase and random oligo primers (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Preparations 2 and 3: total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described above
(‘‘RNA extraction’’). Reverse transcription reactions (25�C for 10 min, 37�C for 2 h, 85�C for 5 min) were carried out using a High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Resulting cDNA was prepared for qPCR using PowerUp SYBRgreen Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) in a 96-well plate with primers against rat Arc, GAPDH and asnA (see above, ‘‘RT-PCR’’; asnA primers: Fwd,
GCGTGGATGCCGACACGTTG; Rev, ATACCGCCGCCGATGGTCTG). qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 3 Real Time PCR
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following protocol: Pre-incubation: 50�C for 2 min, 95�C for 2 min. Amplification: 40 cycles
of 95�C for 15 s, 60�C for 15 s, and 72�C for 1 min. Melt curve: 95�C for 1 s, 60�C for 20 s, continuous ramp at 0.15�C/s up to 95�C.
Ct values of greater than 30 were considered undetectable. Differences in expression were determined using the standard curve
method, where a standard DNA sample was serially diluted (10-fold), analyzed for the gene of interest, and the linear equation calcu-
lated. The resulting linear equation was used to determine where the Ct values of test samples fell within the standard curve and the
result was transformed (log10) to reflect the dilution of the standard sample. Differences were calculated measuring the fold-change
from the average of the control values for any given group (test/average control).
Extracellular vesicle purification
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were purified from HEK cell and primary neuronal cultures as previously described (Lachenal et al.,
2011). Media was spun successively at 2,000 and 20,000xg to remove dead cells and debris, and then at 100,000xg to pellet
EVs. The crude EV pellet following the initial high-speed spin was resuspended in cold PBS and repelleted at 100,000xg for
1 h at 4�C in an SW41 rotor. The washed EV pellet was further purified by centrifugation over a 10%–20% sucrose-PBS gradient
at 100,000xg overnight at 4�C. The resulting pellet was washed in cold PBS to remove excess sucrose and then repelleted at
100,000xg for 1 h at 4�C. The final, washed pellet was resuspended in PBS and used for downstream analysis with EM, western
blotting, and neuron treatments.
Trypsin digestion and RNase assays
Trypsin was added to prArc and EVs at 0.05 mg/mL for 30 min at RT followed by addition of 1 mM PMSF for 10 min to inactivate
trypsin. Untreated and trypsin-treated samples were then analyzed by western blot. RNase A was added to WT neuron lysates
and EVs at 50 mg/mL for 15 min at 37�C. Untreated and RNase-treated samples for RT-PCR were then directly extracted with

Immunogold labeling
Immunogold labeling was performed with modifications as previously described (Korkut et al., 2013). Samples were fixed overnight in
2% formaldehyde at 4�C with gentle rocking. Samples were then applied to glow discharged Formvar copper mesh grids (Ted Pella)
and allowed to adhere at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were then quenched by 3 washes of 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4. Samples

 were then permeabilized for 10 min at RT, blocked, and stained for Arc (1:500; custom-made). 5 nm gold-conjugated secondary
antibodies were used for staining without silver enhancement. Following antibody labeling, grids were negative stained as described
above.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Two-way ANOVA with or without repeated-measures (with post hoc Sidak’s tests) or two-tailed unpaired t-tests were performed
using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) or JMP Pro statistical software (SAS; Cary, NC). Significance was
set at p < 0.05. All data shown are representative of at least two experimental replicates. Details of the statistics (N, number of exper-
imental replicates, description of how the data are displayed) can be found in figure legends and/or the Results section.

 Supplemental Figures
Figure S1. Alignment of Primary aa Sequences of Ty3/Gag Elements and Origin of Dipteran Arc Genes, Related to Figure 1
(A) Translated genomic DNA sequences corresponding to Arc or gypsy Gag proteins were aligned using MUSCLE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/).
Aligned sequences were shaded using the boxshade plot server (https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html), using default parameters (50% sequences
sharing aa identity for shading). Note: the alignments only contain fragments of Arc genes, not the full-length sequences with start sites. Species included: Mm—
Mus musculus, house mouse; Hs—Homo sapiens, human; Ac—Anolis carolinensis, Carolina anole lizard; Lc—Latimeria chalumnae, West Indian Ocean
coelacanth; Dr—Danio rerio, zebrafish; Cc—Cyprinus carpio, common carp; Dm—Drosophila melanogaster, common vinegar fly; Ds—Drosophila suzukii,
spotted-wing fly; Sc—Stomoxys calcitrans, stable fly, Lh—Linepithema humile, Argentine ant; Bm—Bombyx mori, silkworm; Tc—tribolium castaneum, red flour
beetle.
(B) (left) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of Arc homologs found in Drosophilidae, Muscidae, and Tephritidae flies. Multiple copies of darc1 were
observed throughout tephritid flies and in the house fly, Musca domestica. For each sequence, the GenBank accession number is given after the abbreviated
species names. Tephritidae: RZ—Rhagoletis zephyria; CC—Ceratitis capitate; BD—Bactrocera dorsalis. Muscidae: MD—Musca domestica; SC—Stomoxys
calcitrans. (right) Putative duplication history of dArc in schizophoran flies as inferred from the phylogenetic analysis in (A). Since all schizophoran flies examined
possess a homolog of darc1 and darc2, the duplication of the ancestral dArc must have occurred prior to the divergence of these species (blue triangle). This
ancestral duplication event was followed by multiple rounds of duplication of darc1 (green triangles) in some of the lineages: two duplication events in the
common ancestor of the Tephritidae, one additional duplication in the lineage of Ceratitis capitata, and one additional duplication in the lineage of Bactrocera
dorsalis. Independently, darc1 experienced three rounds of duplication in the lineage of Musca domestica. By contrast, darc2 has apparently remained a single
copy gene in the species examined.
 Figure S2. Recombinant Protein Purification and Experiments, Related to Figure 2
(A) (left to right) Representative Coomassie gel of affinity purifications of full-length rat Arc (prArc), prArc-DCTD, CA-prArc, GST, and Endo3A showing similar
expression levels to that of prArc. prArc-DCTD and Endo3A were prepared in the same manner as prArc. GST was directly eluted from the affinity resin using
15mM L-glutathione. His-tagged CA-prArc was eluted from Ni2+ affinity resin using 250mM imidazole. All proteins were then buffer exchanged into 150mM NaCl,
50mM Tris, pH 7.4 following GST-tag cleavage by Precision Protease or elution. Buffer conditions were adjusted for all proteins for each experiment: 500mM
NaPO4, 50mM Tris, pH 7.4 for capsid stability. Analyses showing the partitioning of bacterially-expressed protein into soluble (sup) and insoluble (pellet) fractions
(lanes 1, 2), capture of the protein on a GST or Ni2+ affinity matrices (lanes 3-5 show the flow through (FT), wash and captured protein, respectively). This panel
demonstrates the protein expression levels and the efficacy and efficiency of affinity capture.
(B) Representative Coomassie gels of peak fractions of prArc, prArc-DCTD, and Endo3A eluted from S200 size exclusion columns. Peak fractions were pooled
and concentrated to a final stock concentration of 1mg/mL. prArc was concentrated to 1mg/mL from each purification for use in all biochemistry/EM experiments,
unless noted. For cell biology experiments, prArc was diluted to 0.4mg/mL and 4 mg total protein was used per condition.
(C) Representative Coomassie gel of affinity purification of Drosophila dArc1 from BL21 bacteria lysates demonstrating similar expression levels to rat prArc.
(D) HEK293 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with full-length rat WT Arc or GFP plasmids using Lipofectamine at equal DNA concentrations and subjected
to formaldehyde crosslinking in situ. Cell lysates were blotted with anti-GFP or anti-Arc antibodies. Note that higher molecular species corresponding to Arc
dimers and trimers can be observed in the crosslinked Arc sample, but not in the GFP sample.
 Figure S3. RNA Binding Experiments and Properties of Arc EVs, Related to Figures 2 and 3
(A) Representative Coomassie gels of nucleotide stripping of prArc. (left) Cells were lysed in 20mM NaCl, 50mM Tris, 2mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH 8.0.
Fractions shown are supernatant and pellet fractions of cellular lysis after pelleting at 21,000xg for 45 min. The supernatant from this step was treated with 0.1%
PEI to precipitate nucleic acids. This treatment resulted in a shift in the A260/280 ratio from 1.71 ± 0.018 to 1.29 ± 0.023, indicating a drop in nucleic acid content.
The sample was pelleted at 27,000xg for 20 min and the resulting supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate (AmSulf) precipitation to concentrate Arc and
pelleted at 10,000xg for 10 min. The AmSulf pellet containing Arc was then subjected to affinity purification as above. (right) Representative Coomassie gel of
peak fractions of cleaved, affinity purified PEI treated Arc from an anion exchange column. This chromatography step further stripped bound nucleic acids from
Arc. Peak fractions were concentrated to 1mg/mL and the final measured A260/280 ratio for these fractions was 0.68 ± 0.03 (n = 3), indicating that PEI-treated prArc
was largely free of nucleic acids.
(B) (left) Representative negative stain EM images of purified EVs from Arc-transfected HEK293 cell media collected for 24 h used for western blot analysis. (right)
Representative negative stain EM images of purified EVs from WT cultured neuron media collected for 24 h used for western blot analysis. Red arrows indicate
purified EVs.
(C) (left) Western blot of Arc in untreated EVs or EVs treated with trypsin (0.05mg/mL) for 30 min. prArc was used as a positive control for trypsin activity. (right)
Quantification of Arc western blot normalized to total protein. Trypsin degraded prArc but had no effect on Arc protein present in neuronal EVs.
(D) Activity dependence of Arc secretion. Purified EV fraction from media collected from DIV15 cortical neurons in 10-cm dishes from untreated WT neurons was
compared with treatment with KCl. Media was freshly exchanged with basal media or media supplemented with KCl to a final concentration of 50mM. Following
media exchange, cells were incubated for 1 h and media was collected and the EV fraction was purified. (left) Western blots of Arc and total protein from the
purified EV fraction from cultured neuronal media. (right) Quantification of Arc protein levels, normalized to total protein. KCl treatment resulted in significantly
more Arc released into the media (n = 2; p < 0.05).
 Figure S4. HEK Cell Experiments and Custom-Made Arc Antibody Control Experiments, Related to Figure 4
(A) HEK293 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with GFP-Arc as in Figure 4. 18 h later, media from GFP-Arc-transfected HEK cells in 10-cm dishes was
transferred to naive HEK cells in 12-well plates, and 80mM Dynasore was added in one group at the same time to block endocytosis. After 6 h, the Dynasore-
treated media was exchanged for fresh HEK media. 18 h later, cells were fixed and clusters of GFP-Arc-expressing cells over an entire 18mm coverslip were
manually counted through a 20X objective (n = 3 coverslips/group). (left) Representative images of one 20X field of view. (right) Dynasore significantly reduced the
number of clusters of GFP-Arc-positive cells over the entire coverslip. Student’s t-test: *p < 0.05. Scale bar = 50 mm. Representative of three independent
experiments and cultures with similar results.
(B) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO and WT neurons were immunostained for the dendritic protein MAP2 with Alexa Fluor 555 only (top row), or both MAP2
(Alexa 555) and Arc (Alexa 488; bottom two rows). Imaging settings for Arc were determined based on Arc immunostaining in WT neurons (bottom row). No GFP
fluorescence from GFP knocked in to the Arc locus in the KO neurons was visible under these imaging conditions. Example of two independent experiments.
(C) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO and WT neurons were fixed and immunostained with either a custom-made rabbit polyclonal Arc antibody (ProteinTech)
or the commercially available Synaptic Systems rabbit polyclonal Arc antibody, as well as the dendritic protein MAP2. All groups were imaged with the same
acquisition settings. 30-mm segments of two dendrites/neuron were analyzed in all groups (n = 10 neurons) and were chosen using MAP2 staining. Both anti-
bodies were able to detect a difference between Arc KO and WT neurons, although the signal:noise was better using the custom-made antibody. Arc in the soma/
nucleus varies widely from neuron to neuron with both antibodies, under basal conditions. Student’s t-test: **Arc KO versus WT with custom antibody, p < 0.01.
#Arc KO versus WT with Synaptic Systems (‘‘SySy’’) antibody, p < 0.05. Arc images are false-colored with the Smart LUT in ImageJ to better display differences in
Arc expression. Example of two independent experiments.

 Figure S5. RNase and Uptake Experiments, Related to Figure 5
(A) To test whether Arc mRNA is protected in prArc capsids, samples were subjected to 15 min treatment with RNase A, then RNase inhibitor (1U/mL) to quench
activity, prior to incubation with neurons. (left) Representative images of Arc mRNA in DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons incubated with the treated or
untreated prArc samples for 4 h. (right) prArc treatment resulted an increase in dendritic Arc mRNA levels in Arc KO neurons. prArc treated with RNase did not
affect Arc mRNA transfer.
(B) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were treated for 4 h with 4 mg prArc. In one group, 30 min before prArc was added, neurons were pretreated with
80mM Dynasore to block endocytosis. (left) Representative images of Arc protein and mRNA levels. (right) Pretreatment with Dynasore significantly blocked
uptake/transfer of prArc protein and Arc mRNA. Student’s t-test: *p < 0.05. ***p < 0.001. Example of three independent experiments (A, B). Scale bars in all
panels = 10 mm.
(C) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were treated for 4 h with 4 mg prArc. Either combined FISH/ICC for Arc mRNA and Rab5 protein, or ICC for Arc
and Rab5 protein, was performed. (left) Representative images of dendrites showing Arc mRNA plus Rab5 protein or Arc and Rab5 protein. (right) Arc protein and
mRNA showed around 50% colocalization in dendrites with Rab5. White arrowheads indicate Arc alone, and yellow arrowheads indicate Arc/Rab5 colocalization.
Example of two independent experiments. Scale bar = 10 mm.
(D) Purified protein samples of prArc, prArc(RNA-), prArc-DCTD, and CA-prArc were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting western blot was immunostained
for Arc using our custom-made Arc antibody. The antibody successfully detected all of the mutant constructs, suggesting that the lack of Arc immunostaining
observed in transfer experiments was not a result of an inability of the antibody to detect the mutants. ‘‘Total’’ is Ponceau stain for total protein for each sample.
 Figure S6. Purified Arc Stripped of Nucleic Acids Cannot Be Taken Up by Neurons, Related to Figure 5
DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were treated with 4 mg prArc or prArc(RNA-) for 4 h before being fixed. One group from each treatment was not
permeabilized during the immunocytochemistry procedure for Arc and MAP2. prArc-treated neurons that were non-permeabilized showed little to no MAP2 and
Arc immunostaining. However, prArc(RNA-)-treated neurons showed no difference in Arc immunostaining between permeabilized and non-permeabilized
conditions, although MAP2 immunostaining was still absent in the non-permeabilized condition, suggesting that prArc(RNA-) accumulates on the outside of the
neurons. Dendritic segments boxed in white are shown magnified beneath each corresponding image. Scale bars = 10 mm. Example of three independent
experiments. Arc images are false-colored with the Smart LUT from ImageJ to highlight differences in Arc expression. Merged images have MAP2 immuno-
staining in magenta and Arc in green.

 Figure S7. RNase and Uptake Experiments, Related to Figure 6
(A) To test whether Arc mRNA is protected in neuronal EVs, EVs prepared from 10-cm dishes of DIV15 cultured WT cortical neurons were subjected to 15 min
treatment with RNase A, then RNase inhibitor (1U/mL) to quench activity, prior to incubation with neurons. DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were
incubated with 10 mg of the treated or untreated WT EV samples for 4 h. (left) Representative images of Arc mRNA levels in neurons. (right) WT EV treatment
resulted an increase in dendritic Arc mRNA levels in Arc KO neurons. WT EV treated with RNase did not affect Arc mRNA transfer.
(B) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were treated for 4 h with 10 mg of the EV fraction harvested from the media of 10-cm dishes containing DIV15
high-density cultured cortical WT or Arc KO neurons. In one group, 30 min before EVs were added, neurons were pretreated with 80mM Dynasore to block
endocytosis. (top) Representative images of Arc protein levels (left) or Arc mRNA levels (right). (bottom) Pretreatment with Dynasore significantly blocked uptake
of Arc protein and mRNA from WT EVs. Arc protein and mRNA expression was normalized to Arc KO and is displayed as fold-change ± SEM. Dendritic segments
boxed in white are shown magnified beneath each corresponding image. 30-mm segments of two dendrites/neuron were analyzed in all groups (n = 10 neurons)
and were chosen using MAP2 staining. Student’s t-test: ***p < 0.001. Scale bars = 10 mm. Example of three independent experiments. Images are false-colored
with the Smart LUT from ImageJ to highlight differences in Arc expression.
(C) DIV15 cultured hippocampal Arc KO neurons were treated for 4 h with 10 mg of WT EVs, then fixed. Either combined FISH/ICC for Arc mRNA and Rab5 protein,
or ICC for Arc and Rab5 protein, was performed. (left) Representative images of dendrites showing Arc mRNA plus Rab5 protein or Arc and Rab5 protein. (right)
Arc mRNA and protein showed 30%–40% colocalization in dendrites with Rab5. White arrowheads indicate Arc alone, and yellow arrowheads indicate Arc/Rab5
colocalization. Example of two independent experiments. Scale bar = 10 mm.
(D) Model: Comparison of HIV Gag and Arc capsid life cycle. (top) HIV Gag protein self-assembles (via the CA domain) in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane
(by myristoylation of the MA domain), while the capsid encapsulates viral RNA (via the NC domain). The immature HIV capsid is released from the cell in an
ESCRT-dependent manner (via the p6 domain) with membrane that contains the viral envelope protein (Env). The mature virus particles bind host cells through
surface receptors (such as CD4) and membrane fusion occurs. Alternatively, in some cell types virus particles are first endocytosed prior to fusion and particles
released into the cell after full fusion occurs in the endosome. Viral RNA is released and then reversed transcribed into viral DNA that is integrated into the host
genome. (bottom) Arc mRNA is trafficked out into dendrites in RNA granules that contain a selection of different mRNAs. Local translation of Arc mRNA takes
place in dendrites in response to neuronal activity. High concentrations of Arc protein self-assemble and form Arc capsids, which encapsulate select mRNAs that
are spatially proximal, including Arc mRNA. Arc capsids are released from dendrites in Arc Capsids Bearing Any RNA (ACBARs) and transfer of mRNA and other
putative cargo takes place in neighboring dendrites.
