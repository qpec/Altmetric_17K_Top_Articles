conomic abuse is a form of intimate 
partner violence (IPV).1-5 It involves 
behaviours aimed at manipulating 
a person’s access to finances, assets and 
decision-making to foster dependence and 
control. Adams1 identified three dimensions of 
economic abuse: economic control, economic 
exploitation and employment sabotage. 
Economic abuse between intimate partners 
results in significant work-related problems,6 
financial hardship,6-9 psychological distress10 
and depression.11 Financial hardship and 
dependence represent significant barriers to 
women leaving violent relationships.1,4,12
In the past decade there has been increased 
research and clinical focus on economic 
abuse and recent waves of population-based 
studies have included questionnaire items 
specific to economic abuse. However, it 
is a form of IPV that is difficult to measure 
because it is often not recognised as abuse by 
those who are experiencing it.4,9,13,14
International studies report a range of lifetime 
prevalence rates of economic abuse among 
women, including 11.6–15.1% in the US;7,11,15 
4–4.9%,16 3.4%17 and 3%18 in Canada; 21% in 
the UK;9 and 6.9% in the Philippines.19 Studies 
on economic abuse among Palestinian 
women found rates (in the past 12 months) of 
between 44% and 45%.20,21 
There is limited data on the prevalence of 
economic abuse in Australia and associated 
factors. A 1999 community survey in South 
Australia (N=6,004) reported that the lifetime 
prevalence of economic abuse among 
women was 8.8%.22 However, this study 
used a limited definition of economic abuse 
(withholding money or giving insufficient 
funds), and for additional analyses, economic 
abuse was combined with emotional 
abuse. Mouzos and Makkai reported on 
the Australian findings of the 2002–03 
International Violence Against Women Survey. 
Five per cent of women reported that their 
current partner had destroyed or damaged 
their property.23 Among women attending 
general practices in Queensland in 1996, 3.3% 
reported that their “partner had taken their 
wallet and left them stranded” in the previous 
12 months and 1.9% were not allowed to 
work outside the home – both indicators of 
economic abuse.24 
As with IPV in general, the prevalence of 
economic abuse is higher among women than 
men. A 2015 UK national survey of 4,002 adults 
found that the lifetime prevalence of economic 
abuse was higher for women (21%) than men 
(15%).9 In Canada, women reported economic 
abuse more than men (3% versus 2%);18 
reported more property damage (4.9% versus 
2.7%); and were more often prevented by 
their partners from knowing about or having 
access to family income (4.0% versus 2.0%).16 
In the 1999 South Australian study, the lifetime 
prevalence of economic abuse was higher for 
women (8.8%) than men (2.6%).22
Economic abuse is significantly associated 
with other forms of IPV (physical and 
psychological). Among women who have 
sought help from domestic violence services, 
the prevalence of economic abuse ranges 
from 78% to 99%.1,6,17,19,25 Economic abuse

Abstract
Objective: Economic abuse is a form of domestic violence that has a significant impact on 
the health and financial wellbeing of victims, but is understudied. This study determined the 
lifetime prevalence of economic abuse in Australia by age and gender, and the associated risk 
factors.
Methods: The 2012 ABS Personal Safety Survey was used, involving a cross-sectional population 
survey of 17,050 randomly selected adults using face-to-face interviews. The survey-weighted 
prevalence of economic abuse was calculated and analysed by age and gender. Logistic 
regression was used to adjust odds ratios for possible confounding between variables.
Results: The lifetime prevalence of economic abuse in the whole sample was 11.5%. Women 
in all age groups were more likely to experience economic abuse (15.7%) compared to men 
(7.1%). Disability, health and financial stress status were significant markers of economic abuse.
Conclusions: For women, financial stress and disability were important markers of economic 
abuse. However, prevalence rates were influenced by the measures used and victims’ awareness 
of the abuse, which presents a challenge for screening and monitoring.
Implications for public health: Social, health and financial services need to be aware of and 
screen for the warning signs of this largely hidden form of domestic violence.

is more frequent among women who have 
experienced IPV and those who have activity 
limitations due to poor health or disability.17 
Age,19 education level6,10,26 and income level19 
have also been associated with increased 
prevalence of economic abuse. 
The Personal Safety Survey (PSS) is the only 
population study in Australia to date that 
has included a range of economic abuse 
items (five in total).27 The lifetime prevalence 
of intimate partner physical violence for 
Australian men is 5.0% and for women 
15.6%; sexual partner abuse was reported 
by 0.4% of men and 4.9% of women; hence 
partner violence (both physical and/or sexual 
violence) was reported by 16.9% of women 
and 5.3% of men. The PSS data for emotional 
abuse (in which economic abuse is included) 
was reported by 14.4% of men and 24.5% 
of women.28 Data for economic abuse only 
was not reported. Myhill highlighted the 
importance of not relying on a checklist of 
abusive behaviours alone, but also including 
whether the aim of these controlling 
behaviours is to cause the victim fear and 
anxiety.29 The PSS includes in the questions 
on economic and emotional abuse whether 
the behaviours were intended to “cause you 
emotional harm or fear”
. While it is difficult to 
determine intentions of others, the meaning 
of this item points to patterns of behaviour 
rather than isolated incidents of abuse. 
This paper aims to determine the prevalence 
of economic abuse between intimate 
partners in the Australian community 
by gender and age. It also explores the 
relationship between economic abuse and 
income, education, financial stress, disability 
and health status.
Methods
We analysed secondary data obtained 
from the PSS.28 The PSS was conducted 
between February and December 2012 using 
structured face-to-face interviews (N=17,050). 
Households were randomly selected and 
only one eligible usual resident from each 
household was interviewed. The survey 
achieved a response rate of 57%. Women 
were oversampled (n=13,307 completed the 
survey compared to n=3,743 men). Because 
of the response rate, person weights were 
provided in the dataset based on age, sex, 
area, marital status, country of birth and 
labour force status. 
Measures
Economic abuse
The survey included 15 emotional abuse 
items, of which five were relevant to partner 
economic abuse: 1) stopped or tried to 
stop you knowing about or having access 
to household money; 2) stopped or tried to 
stop you from working or earning money, 
or studying; 3) deprived you of basic needs 
(e.g. food, shelter, sleep, assistive aids); 4) 
damaged, destroyed or stole any of your 
property; and 5) stopped or tried to stop you 
from using the telephone, Internet or family 
car. Participants responded to each item 
individually with either ‘yes’ or ‘no’
. Lifetime 
economic abuse (since the age of 15 years) 
was defined as experiencing at least one of 
the five economic abuse items in a current 
or previous recent relationship. Given the 
structure of the PSS, it was not possible to 
determine the prevalence in the previous 12 
months or the frequency of economic abuse. 
The Cronbach’s Alpha for the five economic 
abuse items was 0.81. Any other form of 
emotional abuse was defined as respondents 
endorsing any one of the remaining (10) 
emotional abuse items.
The demographic variables used were 
employment status, relationship status, 
household and personal income level 
(reported in quintiles) and highest education 
level (see Tables 2 and 3). General health was 
assessed on a self-rating scale from ‘excellent 
to poor’
. Lifetime experience (since the 
age of 15) of intimate partner physical and 
psychological abuse (excluding economic 
abuse) was dichotomised. Disability 
status was coded as to whether or not the 
respondent had a disability or long-term 
health condition.30
Financial resilience (the ability to absorb 
financial shocks) was determined by whether 
or not the respondent could raise $2,000 in 
a week for an emergency. Financial stress 
(household cash flow problems) was coded 
as ‘No stress’ (one or no indicators reported), 
‘Moderate stress’ (two to four stress indicators) 
and ‘High stress’ (five or more indicators 
reported), of the nine cash flow problems 
listed such as ‘Could not pay electricity, gas or 
telephone bills on time’ or ‘Sought financial 
help from friends or family’
.31
Data were analysed with Stata version 
10 through the secure Australian Bureau 
of Statistics (ABS) Remote Access Data 
Laboratory using a restricted and cleaned 
dataset which also included predefined 
aggregate variables. The ABS calculated final 
person weights and person replicate weights 
were used to weight the data using the SVR 
suite of commands in Stata (Nick Winter, 
Cornell University) to generate prevalence 
rates and 95% confidence intervals.32 Odds 
ratios were used to determine the association 
between economic abuse and demographic, 
health and financial variables. Logistic 
regression was used to adjust the odds ratios 
while adjusting for possible confounding 
between these variables.33 These analyses 
were performed separately for men and 
women. The analysis of secondary, publicly 
available de-identified data did not require 
institutional ethical approval.
Results
Prevalence of economic abuse
The population-weighted prevalence of 
economic abuse between intimate partners 
in Australia was 11.5% (95%CI 10.9–12.0). 
The prevalence of economic abuse among 
women of 15.7% (95%CI 14.8–16.6) was 
more than double that of men 7.1% (95%CI 
6.3–7.8), see Table 1. The odds of experiencing 
economic abuse was higher for women 
(OR=2.5, 95%CI 2.1–2.8) than for men.
Endorsement of individual items of economic 
abuse ranged from 2.2% (denied basic 
necessities) to 7.2% (damaged property). 
Women experienced more economic abuse 
than men on all items. The most frequently 
occurring economic abuse behaviour was 
damage to or theft of property (total sample 
7.2%, men 4.7% and women 9.6%). This was 
followed by stopping access to, or knowledge 
about, household money (total sample 5.8%), 
which was also more commonly experienced 
by women (8.8%) than by men (2.7%). 
Comparisons by age group highlight that 
participants aged 30–39, 40–49 and 50–59 
reported the highest prevalence of economic 
abuse both overall and on individual items. 
The rate of economic abuse among those 
aged 30–39 (13.2%) was almost double 
that of the 18–29 age group (7.1%). While 
the overall survey-weighted prevalence of 
economic abuse for men was 7.1%, this peaks 
in the 40–49-year-old male group at 10.3%. 
For women, this is the age group when we 
see the highest prevalence of economic 
abuse, with 20.9% for 40-49-year-old women, 
and 19.7% for 50-59-year-old women.
Univariate odds ratios revealed that women 
were more likely to have a history of 
economic abuse if they were separated or 
divorced; had a lower levels of education;

were unemployed; or lived in households 
with second and lowest income quintiles. 
Women were also more likely to experience 
economic partner abuse if they had a 
disability; had poor or very poor health; 
experienced moderate or high financial stress; 
or had limited financial resilience (see Table 
2). For men, the variables associated with 
economic abuse were slightly different. In 
particular, labour force status and household 
income were not significant indicators of 
economic abuse for men (see Table 3).
The logistic regression model found that, for 
men, variables that were significant at the 
univariate level were no longer significant, 
except for the strong association between 
economic abuse and physical and emotional 
abuse. For women, even when controlling 
for physical IPV and emotional abuse, those 
who had ‘Year 11 or 12’ as their highest 
education level, experienced high financial 
stress or had a disability or long-term health 
condition were significantly associated with 
experiencing economic abuse. It was of note 
that for both genders, employment status 
was not a significant factor. 
Discussion
This study adds to the emerging international 
and national picture of the prevalence of 
economic abuse between intimate partners. 
As previously stated, the prevalence of 
economic abuse in this Australian sample was 
11.5%, and was higher for women (15.7%) 
than for men (7.1%). The gender differences 
are important. It is well established that IPV is 
gendered: women are the majority of victims 
and experience more severe consequences 
of IPV.16,18 
The prevalence rates reported here are more 
than double the rates previously reported in 
the 1999 South Australian study22 and higher 
than the rates reported in Canada.16,18 These 
previous studies used only one or two items 
to determine economic abuse. In contrast, 
prevalence rates reported by Sharp-Jeffs9 for 
the UK are significantly higher (35%) than the 
Australian data reported above. However, 
Sharp-Jeffs9 used responses to 31 individual 
indicators of economic abuse and a survey 
panel sample. The differing rates of economic 
abuse need to be interpreted cautiously as 
they are potentially influenced by the choice 
and number of economic abuse items utilised 
and sampling techniques employed. 
In the present study, the most commonly 
occurring form of economic abuse was 
damage, destroying or stealing property, 
at 7.2%. This rate is higher than the 5% 
reported by Mouzos and Makkai,23 and the 
3.1% reported in the Philippines.19 Again, 
Sharp-Jeffs9 reported higher rates, with 14% 
of women experiencing property damage by 
a past or current partner, and 11.9% of men 
experiencing property damage. In Canada, 
4.9% of women and 2.7% of men reported 
experiencing property damage.16
In the 1999 South Australian study, 
withholding money or deliberately providing 
inadequate funds for household needs was 
experienced by 2.6% of men and 8.8% of 
women (5.9% for the total sample).22 The 
current data suggest that these figures have 
increased in Australia (although the items 
were not worded exactly the same): in 2012, 
being denied access to household money 
was experienced by 3.1% of men and 9.3% of 
women.
PSS survey participants were asked if they 
were denied access to internet, phone or 
family car – all critical to maintaining social 
contacts and support, engaging in work or 
study and managing one’s finances. This 
was found to have occurred among 7.5% of 
women and 2.3% of men. This item has not 
been used in previous surveys of economic 
abuse. Further research is required to explore 
the control of internet access in IPV and its 
relationship to economic abuse.
We found that economic abuse peaked for 
both men and women aged in their 40s and 
50s, which is similar to the reported peak in 
South Australia of 35–54 years (for domestic 
violence generally among women).22 
There was a significant jump in rates for 
respondents in their 30s compared to 
those in their 20s. There are several possible 
explanations. Women may not be aware 
that the financially controlling behaviours 
they experience are abusive; it is only when 
women leave relationships, and begin the

process of financial settlements for divorce, 
that this becomes more obvious. Sharp-
Jeffs 9 found that about half of the women 
who experienced economic abuse did not 
recognise it as such from the beginning. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that the peak 
for economic abuse also coincides with the 
median age for divorce which, in Australia, 
was 45.2 years for men and 42.5 years for 
women in 2014. The PSS is likely to have 
underestimated the prevalence of intimate 
partner economic abuse given that the 
questions were only asked about current or 
past cohabitating partners. Australian women 
and men, on average, first marry when they 
are close to age 30 (the median age for men 
was 31.5 years and women 29.6 years in 
2014), potentially explaining the lower rate of 
economic abuse reported by people aged in 
their 20s.34 
We found that, for men, when controlling 
for confounding factors between variables, 
a history of physical IPV and emotional 
abuse were the only variables associated 
with economic abuse. For women, however, 
education, disability status and experiencing 
high financial stress all increased the odds 
of experiencing economic abuse. Unlike 
other studies that have found an association 
between income and economic abuse but 
did not include financial hardship and stress, 
these results highlight that financial hardship 
and stress are significant indicators of 
economic abuse, even when controlling for all 
other factors (including income).
The PSS is a significant survey that measures 
the prevalence, and associated factors, of 
many forms of violence in the Australian 
community. However, there are several 
limitations of this survey instrument. The 
structure of the PSS survey did not allow 
for the determination of whether economic 
abuse had occurred in the previous 12 
months to provide a more reliable temporal 
association between health status, financial 
stress and economic abuse. The PSS is a cross-
sectional study so that only association could 
be determined. 
The PSS still failed to capture at least one 
significant component of economic partner 
abuse: debt generation.35 Debt generation 
has been identified as a significant factor in 
economic abuse which can lead to enduring 
hardship for women who are leaving abusive 
relationships and is enshrined in Victorian 
legislation.36 Future studies should review the 
items used and consider expanding the list

of economically abusive behaviours, with an 
increased emphasis on technology. 
We now have significant data on the lifetime 
prevalence of economic abuse and its 
associated factors for men and women in 
Australia, across the lifespan. We have found 
that women with disabilities or long-term 
health conditions, high levels of financial 
stress and lower levels of education have 
greater odds of experiencing economic 
abuse: these factors remained significant 
even when we controlled for history of 
physical and emotional IPV, age and marital 
status. Our results suggest that health, social 
support and financial services need to be 
aware that women experiencing high levels 
of financial stress could potentially also be 
experiencing economic abuse. The causes 
of financial hardship may run deeper than 
those seen on the surface. The presence 
of economic abuse can potentially go 
undiagnosed while focusing on the more 
obvious symptoms of financial hardship such 
as disability, poor health and limited financial 
resources.
