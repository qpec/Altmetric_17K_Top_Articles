The aggregation of amyloid-� (A�) on lipid bilayers has been
implicated as a mechanism by which A� exerts its toxicity in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Lipid bilayer thinning has been
observed during both oxidative stress and protein aggregation
in AD, but whether these pathological modifications of the
bilayer correlate with A� misfolding is unclear. Here, we studied
peptide-lipid interactions in synthetic bilayers of the short-
chain lipid dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) as a simpli-
fied model for diseased bilayers to determine their impact on A�
aggregate, protofibril, and fibril formation. A� aggregation and
fibril formation in membranes composed of dioleoyl phosphati-
dylcholine (DOPC) or 1- palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcho-
line mimicking normal bilayers served as controls. Differences
in aggregate formation and stability were monitored by a
combination of thioflavin-T fluorescence, circular dichroism,
atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
and NMR. Despite the ability of all three lipid bilayers to cata-
lyze aggregation, DLPC accelerates aggregation at much lower
concentrations and prevents the fibrillation of A� at low micro-
molar concentrations. DLPC stabilized globular, membrane-as-
sociated oligomers, which could disrupt the bilayer integrity.
DLPC bilayers also remodeled preformed amyloid fibrils into
a pseudo-unfolded, molten globule state, which resembled
on-pathway, protofibrillar aggregates. Whereas the stabilized,
membrane-associated oligomers were found to be nontoxic, the
remodeled species displayed toxicity similar to that of conven-
tionally prepared aggregates. These results provide mechanistic
insights into the roles that pathologically thin bilayers may play
in A� aggregation on neuronal bilayers, and pathological lipid
oxidation may contribute to A� misfolding.
The aggregation and fibrillation of amyloid-� (A�)2 in the
brain has long been implicated in the neurotoxicity and patho-
genesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Following its production
via cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein,
A� undergoes aggregation along a nucleated growth pathway
toward its end state amyloid fibril (1). It is believed that inter-
mediate aggregates along this path are the primary culprit in
AD-related cytotoxicity (2, 3). Early A� oligomers may perform
their toxic function through interactions with the neuronal
lipid bilayer (4, 5). Pore formation has been suggested to facili-
tate disruption of the ionic gradient across neuronal mem-
branes (6, 7). Alternatively, elongation of the amyloid species on
the bilayer may remove lipids from the membrane and create
holes that allow for the uncontrolled transit of biomacromol-
ecules across the membrane (8, 9). These two modes of mem-
brane disruption are proposed to coexist; it is thought that
porelike oligomers form first, whereas the fibril-induced per-
turbations occur later (8). Extensive work by Matsuzaki (5) has
revealed that incorporating glycolipids, such as the ganglioside
GM1, can promote the formation of toxic, membrane-associ-
ated A� aggregates linked to membrane disruption. Despite
these insights, the overarching biological, chemical, and physi-
cal parameters that govern the interactions of A� with lipid
bilayers and modulate the formation of toxic oligomers remain
unclear.
Bilayer thickness, controlled by the acyl chain length, is one
basic principle of membrane biophysics that has been shown to
alter membrane protein folding and modulate energetic penal-
ties caused by the hydrophobic mismatch (10, 11). It is there-
fore possible that alterations in the hydrophobic thickness can
control amyloid aggregation and stabilize distinct intermedi-
ates. It remains unclear how on- and off-pathway amyloid olig-
omers may be stabilized by the lipid bilayer, and identifying the
effects of the membrane’s physical structure will provide
greater understanding of how aggregation may occur on cellu-
lar bilayers. Additionally, it may identify conditions in which

 specific oligomeric intermediates may be stabilized for more
thorough structural analysis than has been possible for A� olig-
omers to date. Herein we have used synthetic bilayers com-
posed of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC; 20.9 nm thick),
dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC; 26.8 nm thick), or 1-
palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC; 27.1 nm
thick) to explore relationships between thin (DLPC) and thick
(DOPC and POPC) bilayers, A� aggregation, and the stabiliza-
tion of distinct A� oligomers (12, 13). We have previously
shown that monomeric A� interacts with these three zwitteri-
onic lipid bilayers through a conserved structure under non-
aggregating conditions (14). This initial binding is driven by
surface interactions with the self-recognition sequence and is
minimally affected by the hydrophobic thickness of the mem-
brane. It is more likely that the hydrophobic thickness of lipid
bilayers influences the generation and/or stabilization of higher
order membrane-associated species because of the ability of
these A� aggregates to insert themselves within the bilayer (15).
Both DOPC and POPC have been previously applied to exam-
ine the interactions between lipid bilayers and amyloidogenic
proteins (8, 16–19). DLPC bilayers have been used in the study
of a variety of membrane proteins and were observed to stabi-
lize some membrane proteins in vitro that are less tractable
with other lipid bilayer systems, but they have not been used
previously in the study of A� (20, 21).
Through a suite of biophysical techniques, we have found
that the thin, pathology-mimicking DLPC bilayers have a
unique ability to stabilize prefibrillar oligomers within the
bilayer while preventing the formation of mature fibrils. Sur-
prisingly, it was observed that DLPC bilayers are also capable of
remodeling mature A� fibrils into a semi-unfolded intermedi-
ate, a feat previously observed only after treatment with high
concentrations of denaturants or exposure to high frequency
sonication (22). These results show that thin bilayers are able to
dramatically alter the aggregation of A� compared with con-
ventional lipid bilayers, and this redirected misfolding can sta-
bilize distinct, membrane-associated species not observed
previously.
Results
Unlike DOPC and POPC, DLPC Liposomes Inhibit A� Fi-
brillation—Lipid bilayers can modulate the rate of amyloid
formation by A�, although the extent of modulation varies
depending on the bilayer composition, incubation conditions,
and detection method (23–25). thioflavin-T (ThT), a dye that
fluoresces in the presence of amyloid fibrils, can probe for the
formation of fibrillar aggregates and is useful in delineating
mechanistic deviations in amyloid aggregation (26–28). Thus,
ThT was used to initially probe the aggregation propensity of
A� in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of
DOPC, POPC, and DLPC and characterize kinetic differences
that result from different interactions caused by variation in
hydrophobic thickness.
A� aggregation was accelerated by increasing concentrations
of both DOPC and POPC, as has been shown previously (Fig. 1,
a–c) (23, 24). As the concentration of lipid increased from 0 to
200 �M, the lag phase became continually shorter, suggesting
more rapid nucleation and earlier fibril formation. It is likely
that the observed catalysis is the result of interactions between
A� and the membrane, which serve to reduce the dimension-
ality of the search by individual A� monomers for binding part-
ners and increase the local concentration of peptide (23). End
state aggregates formed in the absence and presence of either
DOPC or POPC were examined by CD spectroscopy and trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2). As expected, all
three samples exhibited a canonical peak at 220 nm in CD spec-
tra, representative of a �-strand fold and amyloid formation.
TEM further confirmed the formation of amyloid fibers in the
presence of both DOPC and POPC. These data support previ-
ous studies suggesting that both DOPC and POPC act as amy-
loid catalysts (23, 24).
Incubation of DLPC LUVs with A� elicited a dramatically
different result compared with DOPC and POPC (Fig. 1d).
When A� aggregated in the presence of DLPC at stoichiomet-
ric (10 �M; 1:1 lipid/peptide ratio) or higher lipid concentra-
tions, ThT fluorescence remained at baseline levels, which sug-
gests no fibril formation. ThT will occasionally provide false
positives of inhibition resulting from dye displacement or the
inability of unique amyloid sequences to bind the dye, despite
containing the canonical �-strand fold (29, 30). To confirm that
the reduction in ThT fluorescence was the result of structural
change, CD and TEM were performed on end stage aggregates
(Fig. 2). CD results showed that the species formed in the pres-
ence of DLPC maintained a random coil structure after a 24-h
incubation. The aggregates were also morphologically distinct
from conventional amyloid fibrils. They were small and amor-
phous and had no discrete fibril structure, as shown by TEM.
Combined, these data confirm that stoichiometric concentra-
tions of DLPC LUVs slow amyloid fibril formation of A�.
To further characterize the potency of this inhibition, ThT
was used to examine the kinetics of amyloid formation in the
presence of substoichiometric concentrations of DLPC (Fig. 1, e
and f). As the concentration of DLPC increased from 0 to 500
nM, the lag phase of aggregation shortened, suggesting acceler-
ated A� fibrillation. Fiber formation catalyzed by 500 nM DLPC
LUVs was further confirmed by both CD and TEM analysis
(supplemental Fig. S1). Increasing the concentration beyond
700 nM lengthened the lag phase. Aggregation was halted by
DLPC concentrations of �1 �M. Similar kinetic profiles were
observed in the presence of DLPC LUVs of different diameters,
suggesting that the effect of DLPC on aggregation is indepen-
dent of bilayer curvature, unlike the effect of other model mem-
branes (supplemental Fig. S2) (25). The profile by which DLPC
initially accelerates and subsequently inhibits amyloid forma-
tion based on concentration is similar to the effect of detergents
on amyloid formation (31). Amyloids are capable of aggregat-
ing in the presence of a variety of detergents, although this is
concentration-dependent. As the concentration of detergent
increases from 0 toward the critical micelle concentration
(CMC) of the detergent, amyloid formation is accelerated, and
the lag phase shortens. Catalysis is maximal around the CMC
of the detergent. As detergent concentration is increased further,
the lag phase increases, and aggregation slows as the interaction
between micelles and the amyloidogenic peptide or protein is
favored (31). This pattern is similar to what has been observed
with DLPC LUVs. Additionally, DLPC is known to have deter-

 gent-like characteristics and has a CMC of �100 nM (32). This
suggests that free DLPC, existing in equilibrium with DLPC
encapsulated in LUVs, may play a role in modulating A� aggrega-
tion through a detergent-like mechanism. However, free DLPC
only inhibited A� aggregation at much higher concentrations
than DLPC in LUVs (15 �M; supplemental Fig. S3, A and B).
Similar profiles have also been observed for various amyloids
interacting with lipid bilayers (33, 34). As the LUV concentra-
tion increases in solution, the lag phase decreases as amyloido-
genic peptides are able to bind to the same LUV, bind to each
other more readily, and accelerate amyloid formation; this
eventually reaches a point of critical acceleration. Beyond this
concentration, aggregation is slowed as individual peptides or
proteins now bind to individual LUVs and they become seques-
tered. It is likely that the observed acceleration and subsequent
inhibition of A� fibrillation by DLPC may be due to interactions
similar to those of both detergents and membranes. The ability
of DLPC to act as both a detergent and a lipid suggests that it
may be a combination of these two mechanisms.
A� Binding to DLPC Liposomes Induces Membrane Disrup-
tion and Unstructured Oligomers—To clarify the extent to
which detergent-like activity of free DLPC is capable of modu-
lating A� aggregation, it is essential to identify the source of free
lipid. Although there is an equilibrium between bilayer-in-
serted and free DLPC, this equilibrium is not capable of gener-
ating high concentrations of free DLPC in the absence of pep-
tide (35, 36). It has been shown, however, that interactions
between amyloidogenic peptides and lipid bilayers can extract
lipids and generate micelle-like particles (8, 37, 38). These spe-
cies could exist as a result of A�-DLPC interactions and subse-
quently play a role in the observed modulation of A� aggrega-
tion. Differences between micelle-like lipid species and LUVs
can be detected using 31P solid-state NMR (8, 38, 39). Due to
their large size, intact vesicles of DLPC, DOPC, and POPC
exhibit a powder pattern spectrum that spans from ��14 to
�25 ppm. Only the perpendicular edge (��14 ppm) of the
spectrum is highly sensitive (Fig. 3A). Following incubation
with A� under aggregating conditions for 24 h, a new peak
centered near 0 ppm was observed for LUVs composed of
DLPC. This isotropic peak at 0 ppm suggests a new, small, lipid
structure induced by A� (Fig. 3A). This provides a source for
free DLPC; the interaction of A� with the surface of DLPC
liposomes is capable of removing lipids from the bilayer, despite
the lack of fibrillation. This is unique both in the lack of fiber
formation, which has previously been suspected as the causa-
tive agent in amyloid-based membrane disruption, and in the
absence of GM1 ganglioside in the bilayer, a lipid that is
believed to be needed for the disruption of neuronal bilayers (5,
8, 37, 38).
Although the disruption of DLPC LUVs by non-fibrillar A�
species is novel, it is unlikely that the free DLPC generated is the
sole cause of amyloid inhibition (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B).

 A second mechanism of inhibition is necessary to explain the
observed potency of DLPC LUV inhibition. We initially
hypothesized that changes in bilayer hydrophobic thickness
may stabilize on- and/or off-pathway oligomers. To study inter-
mediates formed on the surface of DLPC bilayers, we used
atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is well suited for the
interrogation and observation of bilayer-based aggregation of
A� (7, 40–43). DLPC, DOPC, and POPC all formed smooth
supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that were stable for the duration
of the experiments (supplemental Fig. S4) (44, 45). After incu-
bating monomeric A� with SLBs of DOPC and POPC, early
globular and prefibrillar oligomers were observed by AFM after
24 h in a liquid cell (Fig. 3B). Although ThT data suggested that
mature fibrils exist by this point in aggregation, AFM was per-
formed under quiescent conditions, which delays fibrillation
(46). When DLPC SLBs were treated with A�, a large number of
globular aggregates were present on the bilayer after 12 h.
Aggregates persisted after a 24-h incubation, although the size
of individual particles shrank. Defects in the membrane were
also evident around the aggregates after both 12 and 24 h, sug-
gesting that these aggregates perturb the bilayer integrity, in
agreement with the 31P solid-state NMR results.
To quantify the membrane modification caused by A�, the
root mean square roughness (Rq) and average roughness (Ra) of
the samples with respect to time were calculated based on the
AFM data (Table 1). Although all three bilayers initially formed
with a similar smoothness and without defects, DLPC bilayers
demonstrated a large increase in their roughness after 12 and
24 h of incubation with A� relative to both the initial bilayer
smoothness and the observed smoothness for DOPC and
POPC SLBs. The increase in both Rq and Ra is caused by both
the formation of aggregates and the disruption of the bilayer
integrity. Whereas Rq and Ra of DLPC bilayers decrease
between 12 and 24 h of incubation, this is probably caused by
aggregates equilibrating, becoming smaller and more evenly
dispersed across the bilayer surface. To better understand the
kinetics of the observed aggregate formation on the bilayer sur-
face, AFM images were taken at early time points following the
addition of A� to the DLPC SLBs (Fig. 3C). After just 5 min of
incubation, holes were observed in the bilayer, indicative of
dramatic disruption resulting from aggregation. Small, glob-
ular aggregates were also present. At later time points (15
and 20 min), the aggregates grew in size, whereas the mem-
brane defects shrank slightly due to lipid diffusion within the
membrane.
The AFM results point to a unique characteristic of DLPC
bilayers. DLPC SLBs facilitate the rapid formation of globular
aggregates on the bilayer surface of, and possibly within, the
membrane. In contrast, most reports of membrane-mediated
A� aggregation using AFM demonstrate the formation of con-
ventional fibrils (41, 47, 48). This membrane-associated aggre-
gation is probably responsible for the bilayer disruption, despite
not occurring through the canonical amyloid formation path-
way. Amorphous aggregation occurring selectively on DLPC
SLBs suggests that it is at least partly the result of the uniquely
small hydrophobic thickness of DLPC. These globular species
are stabilized by the short hydrophobic distance, which pre-
vents their progression toward mature fibrils. There are, there-
fore, two mechanisms by which DLPC LUVs appear to inhibit
the formation of A� fibers. A�-DLPC interactions generate
micelle-like lipid species that can prevent aggregation; driving
inhibition is the stabilization of globular, membrane-associated
aggregates, which are incapable of progressing toward fibrils.
DLPC Remodels Mature A� Fibrils—Although results to this
point have illustrated how monomeric A� may interact with
and aggregate on bilayers of varying thicknesses, it is equally
important to investigate how preformed aggregates may inter-
act with these bilayers. The addition of DLPC LUVs to premade
fibrils caused a rapid reduction in ThT fluorescence in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Similar fluorescence reduction
has previously been observed in small molecule-induced disag-
gregation of various amyloid fibrils, suggesting that DLPC
LUVs may alter the structure of the traditionally stable fiber
(49–51). Although ThT displacement is a possibility, the stabi-
lization of the final fluorescence at �40% of the original value,
instead of returning to the baseline, suggests that ThT binding
is maintained to some extent and that the changes are primarily
structural (29). Additionally, the reduction in ThT fluorescence
was independent of the concentration of ThT in solution, fur-
ther supporting the change resulting from structural alterations
(supplemental Fig. S5). Neither DOPC nor POPC LUVs caused
a significant change in ThT fluorescence, and fiber structure
was observed to persist based on both CD and TEM analysis
following treatment with either DOPC or POPC (Fig. 4B and
supplemental Fig. S6). This suggests that any structural changes
to the fiber are specific to DLPC. The addition of free DLPC to
preformed aggregates also minimally altered the ThT fluores-
cence of the aggregates, suggesting that the mechanism of
remodeling is not through detergent-like effects (supplemental
Fig. S3C).
Assuming that the DLPC-induced fluorescence reduction is
a function of structural changes, CD was used to examine the
extent of these changes. Surprisingly, the �-strand signal at 220
nm persists over the course of 24 h despite the observed re-
duction in ThT fluorescence stabilizing after 4 h (Fig. 4C).
Although seemingly contradictory, it has been demonstrated
previously that amyloids can possess �-strand content and be
unable to bind ThT (30). Moreover, the TEM images of the
preformed fibers treated with DLPC displayed a morphology
distinct from mature fibers formed in solution (Figs. 2B and 6d).
The remodeled fibrils maintain some fiber-like characteristics,

 although they are much shorter and thinner than mature fibrils.
These results confirm that DLPC LUVs are capable of remod-
eling mature A� aggregates, although not to the extent of some
traditional studies of disaggregation (49–51).
There are, then, three likely mechanisms by which DLPC
LUVs may remodel preformed A� fibrils: (i) DLPC changes the
monomer-fiber equilibrium and causes additional monomers
of A� to enter solution via dissociation from the ends of fibers,
resulting in shorter aggregates (52); (ii) DLPC LUVs alter the
hydrogen bonding network found within the fibril, generating
distinct polymorphs of the aggregates that are less stable and
can potentially become more similar to the immature protofi-
bril structure (52); or (iii) DLPC LUVs rearrange the side chain
packing of the mature fibrils and induce a partially unfolded
state without significantly altering the hydrogen bonding of the
fiber core (22).
We first explored the monomer-fiber equilibrium with 1H
NMR. Whereas monomeric A� is highly dynamic and yields
strong signals in solution NMR, the fibrillar aggregates, due to
their large size and anisotropic tumbling, are essentially invisi-
ble (Fig. 5A). This allows for the selective observation of mono-
meric and small, soluble intermediates over large species. It is
also possible to correlate changes in signal intensity with the
equilibrium between monomeric and aggregated A� (52).
DLPC LUVs were added to fibrillar A�, and spectra were con-
tinually recorded for 23 h (Fig. 5). Whereas previous disaggre-
gation studies using similar methods observed an increase in
relative signal intensity over time during disaggregation, DLPC
induced a minimal change in signal (52). This suggests that the
monomer-fiber equilibrium is minimally perturbed and thus
insufficient to explain the remodeling of preformed fibrils.
We next explored the possibility of DLPC altering the
�-strand topology of the fiber backbone and the stability that it
imparts. It has been shown through extensive solid-state NMR
studies that A� fibers can adopt distinct backbone folds and

pared monomeric A�) of both the more flexible aromatic region (red) and the

sent the moving average over a 40-min interval.

 polymorphs while maintaining the requisite �-strand promi-
nence and fiber core based on aggregation conditions (53–56).
It is possible that DLPC LUVs could exert a chaperone-like
activity to convert one fiber polymorph into another. We ex-
plored the differences between the structures using thermal
unfolding experiments. If fibers treated with DLPC LUVs result
in altered �-strand folding and hydrogen bond networks, their
unfolding temperatures and enthalpy of unfolding will probably
be different as a result (57–59). To this end, we studied the
stability of A� fibers formed for 24 and 40 h, as well as fibers
formed for 24 h and subsequently treated with either 5 or 20 eq
of DLPC in LUVs (Fig. 6). Samples were exposed to continuous
shaking at 25 °
C for the entirety of their aggregation and/or
remodeling. All four samples exhibited similar melting temper-
atures (�68 °
C) and enthalpies of denaturation (115–120 kJ
mol�1). This thermal unfolding was also found to be irreversi-
ble, in agreement with other studies (57). The melting temper-
ature is slightly lower than has previously been published for
the same isoform of A�, probably due to different aggregation
conditions, highlighting this method’s ability to distinguish dis-
tinct fiber polymorphs (57). The similarities in thermal dena-
turation suggest that, despite morphological differences based
on TEM, the intermolecular forces responsible for aggregate
stability are similar for all samples, and thus there is a low like-
lihood of distinct polymorphs being induced by the presence of
DLPC.
Itappears,then,thattheDLPC-inducedchangesinThTfluo-
rescence and morphological differences observed by TEM are
the result of more surface level disruptions. It has previously
been shown that A� fibrils can adopt a pseudotransition state,
termed the molten globule state, in which side chain packing at
the fiber surface becomes perturbed (22). The molten globule
state was defined by a reduction in ThT fluorescence and trun-
cation of the fibrillar structure while the �-strand signal was
maintained in CD spectroscopy, similar to what we have
observed in the presence of DLPC (28). This molten globule
state has previously only been observed following treatment of
mature aggregates with ultrasonication. Treatment of fibrils
with conventional chemical denaturants, such as detergents or
guanidine hydrochloride, has previously resulted in the gener-
ation of the unfolded, monomeric form of A� (22). It is likely
that DLPC is sufficiently mild in its perturbations so as to not
fully denature and instead stabilize this unfolding transition
state. Although we observed that DLPC inhibits A� aggregation
through a combination of detergent-like interactions and sta-
bilization of membrane-associated globulomers, it is likely that
the fibrils are primarily altered through interactions with the
surface of DLPC LUVs, which promote disorder in the tradi-
tionally ordered side chain packing of the fibril (22, 60). This
increased disorder can facilitate a reduction in ThT binding and
fluorescence. It may also increase the likelihood of A� fibrils to
fragment to compensate for the increased side chain flexibility,
explaining the truncated fibril structures observed by TEM (61,
62). These two modes of disruption would be relatively inde-
pendent of the main chain interactions and result in the main-
tenance of the conventional �-strand structure, resulting in
an aggregate species that resembles a protofibrillar structure
(63, 64).
Effect of Lipid-A� Aggregates on Cell Viability—Having
shown that DLPC LUVs are capable of generating two distinct,
non-fibrillar A� aggregates when the lipids are present, the bio-
logical function of these two different species becomes of inter-
est. It has been proposed that oligomers act as the toxic agent in
amyloid-related diseases, and different oligomers can enact
various toxic functions (2, 3). Stabilizing and characterizing the
formation of many of these oligomers has been difficult, how-
ever. We therefore examined the toxic effects of stable species
induced by preincubating monomeric A� with DLPC LUVs
as well as those species generated by treatment of mature fibrils
with DLPC LUVs (Fig. 7, A and B). A� aggregates formed in the
absence of DLPC were observed to reduce cellular viability by
�50%. Aggregates formed in the presence of DLPC, however,
were found to be nontoxic (Fig. 7A). This further suggests that
these A� oligomers formed in the presence of DLPC LUVs are
FIGURE6.ThermodynamicstabilityofA�fibrils.A�fibrils(20�Mmonomer

by 24-h incubation and then treated with 5 eq (c) or 20 eq (d) of 100-nm DLPC
LUVs. After the fiber was unfolded by heating, the sample was cooled from
110 °C down to 25 °C, and the structural signal was again observed for all four
samples (marked by �). These denaturation curves were fit to extrapolate
both the melting temperature (Tm) (e) and the enthalpy of denaturation (�H)
(f) of the fibril under different conditions.

 off-pathway aggregates. A� fibrils remodeled by DLPC were
found to induce cellular death to a similar extent as the un-
treated A� aggregate, suggesting that these molten globule
aggregates resemble an on-pathway protofibrillar species,
which has been suggested to be toxic (64).
Discussion
Although DLPC is not a lipid commonly found in eukaryotic
membranes, it serves as a simplified model for membrane thin-
ning associated with AD (65–68). Our findings suggest that
bilayer thickness is able to play a key role in modulating the
pathway of amyloid formation on the lipid bilayer. DLPC, as a
model for a thin bilayer, inhibits the formation of A� amyloid
fibers by stabilizing disordered aggregates on the bilayer sur-
face, whereas DOPC and POPC, conventional bilayers, facili-
tate the formation of amyloid fibrils, as has been demonstrated
previously (Fig. 7C) (23, 24). A� interaction with DLPC bilay-
ers, in turn, induces membrane disruption, which causes lipids
to shed from the bilayer and form micelle-like species above the
CMC of DLPC (100 nM). Additionally, DLPC membranes are
capable of reorganizing the surface and side chain orientation
of mature fibrils. Interestingly, a lipid bilayer composed of
dilauroyl phosphatidylserine, which shares the acyl chain
length and hydrophobic thickness of DLPC, has been shown to
promote the aggregation of �-synuclein, an amyloid implicated
in Parkinson’s disease (69). This finding suggests that the inhi-
bition of A� aggregation by DLPC may be dependent on pep-
tide, lipid headgroup, or possibly both.
Our results also suggest that the oligomers stabilized by their
interaction with thin, DLPC bilayers are non-toxic (Fig. 7A).
This, however, assumes that the act of forming these aggregates
is also non-toxic. In these experiments, oligomers were pre-
formed and subsequently added to live cells. However, it was
also observed that the formation of these disordered oligomers
is capable of disrupting the stability of the lipid bilayer, generating
free lipid and large holes (Fig. 3). It has been previously suggested
that conventional amyloid aggregation on cellular membranes is
toxic,inpart,becauseofitsabilitytodestabilizethemembraneand
induce pores and holes (5, 8, 9). If a similar mechanism were to
occur on locally thinned bilayers of cells during the formation of
the disordered aggregates that we observe here, that mechanism
would, itself, be detrimental to cellular health. Thus, although the
exogenous addition of these aggregates is non-perturbing, their
formation in the presence of cells would probably be detrimental
and result in increased cellular death.
This potential mechanism has greater importance when we
consider the wider biology of AD, which may promote the gen-
eration of locally thinned bilayers in vivo. The interaction of
amyloidogenic sequences with lipid membranes and their
aggregation on bilayers can reduce local bilayer thickness via
mechanical strain (67, 68, 70–73). Additionally, short chain
lipids may form within the AD-affected brain via lipid peroxi-
dation promoted by the heightened oxidative stress found in
the diseased state (65, 66, 74–77). Incorporation of these short-
ened lipids can be toxic and also may result in localized bilayer
thinning (65, 66, 77). If aggregation were to occur around these
regions of reduced bilayer hydrophobic thickness, caused either
by initial aggregation and strain or the incorporation of peroxi-
dized lipids, it is possible that a mechanism similar to that
observed in the presence of DLPC could be replicated. Further
clarification is needed to define whether this mechanism of A�
modulation persists for all thin bilayers, independent of head-
group, and whether it holds true for thinned cellular membranes.
It appears evident, however, that lipid bilayer hydrophobic thick-
ness is capable of altering the aggregation pathway of A� and is
able to stabilize distinct, membrane-associated aggregates.
Experimental Procedures
Materials and Reagents—All reagents were purchased from
commercial suppliers and used as received unless noted other-
wise. A� was purchased from BioBasic (Markham, Canada)
(A�(1–40) � DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKG-
AIIGLMVGGVV) at �95% purity and used without further
purification. DLPC, DOPC, and POPC were purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Vesicle Preparation—LUVs of DLPC, DOPC, and POPC were
prepared from stock chloroform solutions. The resulting solution
was dried under a nitrogen stream and placed under vacuum
overnight to remove residual solvent. The resultant lipid film
was rehydrated in buffer (20 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) to
yield a final lipid concentration of either 1, 10, or 24 mM (for
solid-state NMR experiments). Dried lipid was resuspended
by vortexing the solution and was subsequently extruded via
FIGURE 7. Function and identity of DLPC-induced A� aggregates. A, A�
(2.5 �M) aggregates were generated in the presence and absence of 100-nm
DLPC LUVs, and their toxicity against PC12 cells was compared by the MTT
assay. B, the toxicity of preformed A� aggregates subsequently incubated
with 10 eq (25 �M) of DLPC. C, the combined data from this study suggest that
DLPC has two distinct modes of action against A� aggregation (orange path-
way). When DLPC LUVs are added at the early stages of aggregation, they
promote the formation of unstructured, off-pathway A� aggregates (blue
pathway). When mature A� fibrils are treated with DLPC LUVs, the lipid
induces a polymorphic change within the fibril without significantly altering
the cross-�-strand structure of the fibril, resulting in a more protofibrillar
structure in the final aggregates (red pathway).

 23 passes through a polycarbonate Nucleopore membrane fil-
ter (either 50, 100, 400, or 1000 nm, depending on experiment;
Whatman) mounted to a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) to
obtain a homogeneous solution of LUVs. The formation of ves-
icles was subsequently confirmed by dynamic light scattering to
ensure homogeneity.
Peptide Preparation—A� was received having been treated
with hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol intended to monomerize the
peptide. To disrupt any remaining aggregates, A� was dissolved
in 5% (v/v) NH4OH at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The pep-
tide was aliquoted into 0.1-mg samples and lyopohilized over-
night and stored at �20 °
C until they were needed for an exper-
iment. To prepare monomeric A� for experimentation, peptide
was dissolved in buffer (20 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) to a
final concentration of 120 �M. The stock solution was sonicated
for 10 s and then used immediately after preparation.
ThT Assay—The kinetics of amyloid formation were moni-
tored by the fluorescent, amyloid-specific dye ThT. Samples
were prepared by diluting the 120 �M A� stock to a final con-
centration of 10 �M in the presence of 20 �M ThT. To this was
also added lipid from the prepared stock at a concentration
ranging from 100 nM to 1 mM. Samples were plated in triplicate
on uncoated Fisher 96-well polystyrene plates, maintained at
25 °
C, and subjected to continuous, slow orbital shaking. Fluo-
rescence readings were taken on a Biotek Synergy 2 microplate
reader. Wells were read from the bottom with an excitation
wavelength of 440 nm (30-nm bandwidth) and an emission
wavelength of 485 nm (20-nm bandwidth) at 3-min intervals.
After data acquisition, raw fluorescence values were back-
ground-subtracted and then normalized. Normalized curves
were then individually fit to Equations 1 and 2 to calculate the
individual lag phase (tlag) for each curve (46). These values were
then averaged across three separate trials.

For studies exploring fibril remodeling, fibrils were initially
formed in the 96-well plate for 24 h. After mature fibrils were
formed, lipid (either in LUVs or as free lipid) was added directly
to wells at varying concentrations, diluting the volume by less
than 1% to maintain signal intensity. The experiment was then
restarted under conditions identical to those used to monitor
fibril formation.
CD—Single point CD measurements were carried out at a
concentration of 30 �M A� in the absence or presence of 300
�M (10 eq) 100-nm LUVs of either DLPC, DOPC, or POPC in
buffer (20 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaF). CD measurements
were performed on a JASCO J-1500 CD spectrometer using a
0.1-cm path length cell. Spectra were acquired at 25 °
C using a
bandwidth of 2 nm and a scan rate of 200 nm/min and averaging
spectra over 20 scans. Measurements were taken immediately
after mixing the sample (t � 0 h) and after 24 h of incubation at
25 °
C under slow orbital shaking (conditions mimicking those
used in ThT kinetic assays).
For time course analysis of fibril remodeling, fibrils were ini-
tially formed at 30 �M in buffer by incubating for 24 h at 25 °
C
under slow orbital shaking. After formation of the mature
fibrils, LUVs were added to the solution, and the CD spectrum
was monitored over time. Between reads, the sample was main-
tained at 25 °
C under slow orbital shaking.
TEM—Samples used in TEM analysis were taken directly
from the time course CD experiments after 24 h of incubation
(both for the modulation of fiber formation and the remodeling
of preformed fibrils). Glow-discharged grids (Formar/carbon
300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) were
treated with samples (5 �l) for 2 min at room temperature.
Excess buffer was removed via blotting and then washed three
times with double-distilled H2O. Each grid was then incubated
with uranyl acetate staining solution (1% (w/v) in double-dis-
tilled H2O, 5 �l) for 1 min, and excess stain was blotted away.
Images from each sample were taken on a JEOL 1400-plus TEM
(80 kV) at �50,000 magnification.
AFM—SLBs of POPC, DOPC, and DLPC were deposited on
freshly cleaved mica by immersion of the substrates in vials
containing the lipid vesicle dispersions in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4,
at 25 °
C), kept in a sonication bath for 1 h. AFM images were
acquired with a Cypher S (Asylum Research, Oxford Instru-
ments) microscope in liquid AC mode using rectangular Si3N4
cantilever tips (BL-RC-150VB, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a
nominal spring constant of 0.03 newtons/m.
31P Solid-state NMR—Experiments were performed on a
Varian 600-MHz solid-state NMR spectrometer. A Varian tem-
perature control unit was used to maintain the sample temper-
ature at 30 °
C. All 31P spectra were collected using a single pulse
under 42-kHz two-pulse phase modulation decoupling of pro-
tons. A typical 90°pulse length of 6.0 �s was used with a recycle
delay of 3 s. The 31P chemical shift spectra are referenced with
respect to 85% H3PO4 at 0 ppm. In each experiment, the 31P
spectrum of 200 �l of 1000-nm LUVs composed of 23 mM
DLPC, DOPC, or POPC was first acquired in the absence of
peptide in buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl). After
acquisition of the control spectrum, A� was added to the lipid
solution at a concentration of 230 �M (100:1 lipid/peptide
ratio), and the sample was incubated at 25 °
C under slow orbital
shaking for 24 h to induce aggregation. Following aggregation, a
31P spectrum was again acquired for each sample. Each spec-
trum is the result of 20,000 scans.
1H NMR—Experiments were performed on a Bruker 600-
MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. A 1D 1H
spectrum of monomeric A� (50 mM) was initially acquired in
buffer (20 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) D2O). Pep-
tide aggregation was then induced by constant orbital shaking
at 25 °
C for 24 h. A spectrum was again taken of this aggregated
sample. 100-nm DLPC LUVs were then added to the preformed
aggregate sample (500 �M lipid), and acquisitions were taken
continually for 23 h. Each spectrum was acquired at 25 °
C and is
the combination of 128 total scans. All spectra are normalized
with respect to the initial monomer acquisition.
Thermal Denaturation—Four types of amyloid fibrils of 20
�M A� in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
50 mM NaCl prepared with constant shaking (50-s shaking, 10-s

 loid fibrils, which grew spontaneously from A� monomer solu-
tions for 24 h without DLPC LUVs, were immediately used for
CD measurements after confirming the stationary phase of
fibrillation after the lag and exponential phase based on ThT
fluorescence-based kinetics. The other three types of A� amy-
loid fibrils were obtained after a further 16-h incubation in the
absence and presence of DLPC LUVs (100 and 400 �M DLPC)
at 37 °
C with the same shaking cycle above.
Heat scanning of all types of A� amyloid fibrils from 25 to
110 °
C was performed by monitoring CD signals at 220 nm at a
rate of 10 °
C/min. CD measurements were performed with a
J-820 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with
a water-circulating cell holder for temperature control. Tem-
perature was regulated using a PTC-423L Peltier unit (Jasco,
Japan). A cell with a light path of 1 mm was sealed with a lid to
prevent solvent evaporation during the heat treatment. CD sig-
nals were expressed as the mean residue ellipticity, [�] (degrees
cm2 dmol�1).
The melting temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy change (�H)
of heat denaturation of A� amyloid fibrils were determined by a
regression analysis using a nonlinear least squares fitting of data
to the sigmoidal Equation 3 under the assumption of a two-
state transition between unfolded monomers and amyloid
fibrils. It should be noted that we performed thermodynamic
analyses, although thermal denaturation of A� amyloid fibrils

tion of the equation above are provided below. In our derivation,
we assumed the two-state thermal denaturation model because
the irreversible process in the Lumry-Eyring model can be ne-
glected due to the high scan rate of 10 °
C/min used (78, 79).

Cellular Culture and Cytotoxicity Analysis—PC12 cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 medium without L-glutamine supple-
mented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, in a humidified incubator at 37 °
C with
an environment of 5% CO2. Cells were kept between passage
numbers 20 and 35. 10-cm cell culture dishes were used for
culturing, and 96-flat bottom well trays were used for the MTT
assays. Cells in a suspension of 90 �l (total of 104 cells) were
dispensed in each well and allowed to adhere for 1 day before
adding peptide aggregates.
Peptide aggregates were generated by incubating A� (25 �M)
in the absence or presence of 100-nm DLPC LUVs (1–10 eq) for
18 h at 25 °
C in buffer (20 mM PO4, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl).
Aggregates were taken before complete fibrillation due to the
purported toxicity of the intermediate aggregates (3, 80). 10 �l
of aggregate solution was then added to the plated PC12 cells to
a final volume of 100 �l (2.5 �M A�). After a 24-h incubation of
cells with aggregates, the MTT cell proliferation assay (Pro-
mega, G4000) was used to determine the toxicity of samples
following the manufacturer’s protocol. 15 �l of the MTT dye
solution was added to each well and set to incubate at 37 °
C for
3–3.5 h. 100 �l of solubilization/stop buffer was added and set
to incubate for 2–3 h. The absorbance of each well was then
measured at both 570 and 700 nm (700 nm for background
correction). All cellular viability values were normalized to cells
treated with buffer. Values reported are the average of three
independent trials, and the error is reported as the S.D. of these
averages.
