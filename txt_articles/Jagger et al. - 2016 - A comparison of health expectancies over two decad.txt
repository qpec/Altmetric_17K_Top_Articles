Summary
Background Whether rises in life expectancy are increases in good-quality years is of profound importance worldwide, 
with population ageing. We investigate how various health expectancies have changed in England between 1991 and 
2011, with identical study design and methods in each decade.
Methods Baseline data from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies in populations aged 65 years or older in three 
geographically defi
 ned centres in England (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham) provided prevalence 
estimates for three health measures: self-perceived health (defi
 ned as excellent–good, fair, or poor); cognitive 
impairment (defi
 ned as moderate–severe, mild, or none, as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination score); and 
disability in activities of daily living (defi
 ned as none, mild, or moderate–severe). Health expectancies for the three 
regions combined were calculated by the Sullivan method, which applies the age-specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c prevalence 
of the health measure to a standard life table for the same period. 
Findings Between 1991 and 2011, gains in life expectancy at age 65 years (4·5 years for men and 3·6 years for women) 
were accompanied by equivalent gains in years free of any cognitive impairment (4·2 years [95% CI 4·2–4·3] for men 
and 4·4 years [4·3–4·5] for women) and decreased years with mild or moderate–severe cognitive impairment. Gains 
were also identifi
 ed in years in excellent or good self-perceived health (3·8 years [95% CI 3·5–4·1] for men and 3·1 years 
[2·7–3·4] for women). Gains in disability-free years were much smaller than those in excellent–good self-perceived 
health or those free from cognitive impairment, especially for women (0·5 years [0·2–0·9] compared with 2·6 years 
[2·3–2·9] for men), mostly because of increased mild disability.
Interpretation During the past two decades in England, we report an absolute compression (ie, reduction) of cognitive 
impairment, a relative compression of self-perceived health (ie, proportion of life spent healthy is increasing), and 
dynamic equilibrium of disability (ie, less severe disability is increasing but more severe disability is not). Reasons for 
these patterns are unknown but might include increasing obesity during previous decades. Our fi
 ndings have wide-
ranging implications for health services and for extension of working life.

Introduction
In most developed countries worldwide, life expectancy 
is increasing by at least 2 years every decade and does not 
seem to be slowing down, at least for life expectancy at 
age 60 years.1 Nevertheless, disability trends have not 
shown such clear improvement, with results of studies in 
the USA and Europe showing increases, decreases, or 
stagnation 
in 
disability 
prevalence 
over 
time.2–11 
Diff
 erences between age groups within countries have 
also been reported. Health expectancies such as 
disability-free 
life 
expectancy 
(DFLE) 
combine 
information about quantity and quality of remaining 
years, and provide an improved indication of diff
 erent 
scenarios, including whether: the extra years of life are 
healthy (compression of morbidity)12 or unhealthy 
(expansion 
of 
morbidity);13 
unhealthy 
years 
are 
increasing, but the proportion of life spent healthy is 
increasing (relative compression) or decreasing (relative 
expansion);14 or morbidity and disability are increasing 
but severity of disability is not (dynamic equilibrium).15
Health expectancies are important as indicators to 
monitor population health trends and inequalities 
internationally, nationally, and regionally.16,17 Since 2004, 
the preferred indicator for the EU is healthy life-years, a 
DFLE based on self-report global activity limitation 
indicator.18 The UK Offi
  ce for National Statistics has 
regularly published time series of DFLE (based on 
limiting long-standing illness) and healthy life expectancy 
(HLE; based on self-perceived health [SPH]) at birth and 
age 65 years. These time series suggest that trends in 
DFLE and HLE are much less consistent than trends in 
life expectancy. Comparisons of the periods 2005–07 and 
2008–10 suggest that compression of morbidity took 
place in the UK, with increases in DFLE at birth of

1·4 years for men and 1·3 years for women, compared 
with life expectancy of 0·9 years for men and 0·6 years 
for women, although at age 65 years only women’s DFLE 
rose signifi
 cantly.19 However, data for England, comparing 
2006–08 and 2009–11, show a continued rise in life 
expectancy that is larger than the increase in DFLE for 
men at birth and for both men and women at age 
65 years—DFLE at birth for women even shows a slight 
decrease (0·1 years).20
Trends in DFLE and HLE in other countries have been 
reviewed,21 but not all show that extra years of life are 
healthy or free from disability. Beyond a real increase in 
morbidity and disability, several reasons exist for the 
recorded increase in number of years with ill health or 
disability. First, all health expectancy trends are based on 
self-report and therefore might be aff
 ected by rising 
expectations of health (and thus a lowered threshold for 
reporting of ill health or disability). Additionally, 
questions within countries, such as the UK census 
question, 
might 
change 
over 
time, 
reducing 
comparability. Second, whether increased years with 
disability or ill health result from increased cognitive or 
physical functional limitations is impossible to know 
since mental ill health is only implicitly included 
(through its eff
 ects on disability or self-reported general 
health). Finally, all trends in healthy life-years and the 
between-census values for the UK are based on 
community-dwelling 
populations 
only; 
people 
in 
institutions are only surveyed in the 10-year census.
Our aim was to investigate how health expectancies at 
age 65 years or older changed between 1991 and 2011, by 
use of health measures, identical design, and total 
population (inclusion of institutional residents) available 
in the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I 
and CFAS II). Specifi
 cally, we investigated whether 
(absolute or relative) compression, expansion, or 
dynamic equilibrium of morbidity took place.
Methods
Study design
Data for CFAS I were taken from baseline interviews 
done between 1989 and 1994 in the population aged 
65 years or older in three (Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, 
and Nottingham) of the six geographical areas of the UK 
Medical Research Council CFAS. CFAS II baseline 
interviews were done between 2008 and 2011 in the same 
three areas and with the same study design and methods 
as in CFAS I. The sampling base for both studies was 
primary care registers within the areas, each of which 
provided 2500 individuals aged 65 years or older, with 
stratifi
 cation by age group (65–74 years vs ≥75 years; 
1250 people per stratum per area). We used oversampling 
to allow for losses (death, incorrect registration, 
ineligibility, general practitioner refusals, or participant 
or gatekeeper refusals). The primary-care practices 
screened records of patients in selected samples regularly 
 
for deaths and terminal illness. Selected individuals were 
sent an introductory letter from their family doctor; this 
letter was followed by a visit from a named 
study interviewer. Full details of the study design, 
methods, and response rates have been published.22
Health domains
We used three health measures as a basis for calculation 
of health expectancies: SPH, cognitive impairment, and 
disability. SPH was measured by asking “would you say 
that for someone of your age, your health in general 
is excellent/good/fair/poor”, and participants were 
categorised as having excellent–good versus fair–poor 
health. Cognitive impairment was defi
 ned by a Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE)23 score (maximum 
score 30) as: severe impairment (0–17), mild impairment 
(18–25), or no impairment (26–30).24 We used a measure 
of disability based on basic activities of daily living (BADL) 
and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).25 
Participants were classifi
 ed as having moderate–severe 
disability if they were unable to do at least one of fi
 ve 
activities without human help: transfer to and from a 
chair (from interviewer assessment); put on shoes and 
socks; prepare a hot meal; get around outside; or have a 
bath or all-over wash. Participants who were able to do all 
fi
 ve activities without help from another person but who 
needed help with at least one of the two additional IADLs 
(shop, including carrying of heavy bags, and do heavy 
housework) were classifi
 ed as having mild disability.
Statistical analysis

 c and sex-specifi

for non-response diff
 erences between studies and 
selection of study design. Details of the weighting 
methods have been published previously.22 Analysis of 
change over time in prevalence of each health measure 
was done by logistic regression. Models were fi
 tted with 
time (0=1991, 1=2011), age (5-year age band), and sex, 
then further adjusted for Townsend deprivation index 
(in CFAS I tertiles),26 education (0–9 years, 10–11 years, 
or ≥12 years), and region. Because proportional odds 
assumptions were violated for all three measures, 
separate models were fi
 tted to any morbidity (fair–poor 
SPH, MMSE 0–25, or any disability) and severe 
morbidity (poor SPH, MMSE 0–17, and moderate–
severe disability). The proportion of missing data for 
any of the health measures was low: 2·9% (1991) versus 
4·2% (2011) for SPH; 1·8% (1991) versus 3·7% (2011) 
for MMSE; and 1·1% (1991) versus 4·2% (2011) for 
disability.
Three main health expectancies—HLE, cognitive-
impairment-free life expectancy (CIFLE), and DFLE—were

calculated for the combined three regions common to 
CFAS I and CFAS II by sex for both timepoints (1991 and 
2011) by the Sullivan method.27 This method applies the 
age-specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c prevalence of the health 
measure to a standard life table for the same period. 
To assess dynamic equilibrium, we separated years with 
fair and poor health, mild and severe cognitive 
impairment, and mild and severe disability, within each 
health expectancy calculation.
For the standard abridged life table calculations, we 
used population mid-year estimates and vital statistics 
death data provided by the Offi
  ce of National Statistics28 
at the district level for the three regions. Instead of using 
an average ax (the fraction of interval lived by those dying 
in the interval) of 0·5 in life table calculations, we 
calculated a precise national ax (and stratifi
 ed by sex) 
from national mortality data for both years and used this 
value in the abridged local life table calculations. We 
closed life tables at age 90 years. 
Prevalence modelling was undertaken in SAS, 
version 9.3, and all health expectancy calculations were 
done in R, version 3.0.3.

Results
We report changes over time in the components of the 
health expectancies—ie, life expectancy and the 
prevalence of each health measure. In the three regions 
combined between 1991 and 2011, life expectancy rose by 
4·5 years for men and 3·6 years for women at age 
65 years and by 3·0 years for men and 2·5 years for 
women at age 70 years; from age 80 years, increases for 
women exceeded those for men (appendix).
In the three regions combined, 7635 people participated 
in CFAS I and 7796 in CFAS II. Because of age stratifi
 cation, 
proportions of men and women in each age group were 
similar in 1991 and 2011, but a smaller proportion of 
women was included in 2011 (55%) than in 1991 (60%) 
(table 1). Improved access to education (and change in 
minimum school leaving age by birth cohort) was evident, 
with more than twice as many participants reporting 12 or 
more years of education in 2011 as in 1991 (22% vs 9%), 
and decreased deprivation in 2011 than in 1991 (table 1).
Prevalence of cognitive impairment, fair or poor 
health, and disability was higher in women than in 
men and increased with age, although less so for SPH 
than for the other health measures (appendix). After 
adjustment for age and sex, prevalence of fair or poor

(0·53, 
0·49–0·56), 
severe 
cognitive impairment (0·49, 0·43–0·56), and moderate–
severe 
disability 
(0·76, 
0·70–0·82) 
substantially 
decreased between 1991 and 2011, but that of any 
disability increased (1·22, 1·14–1·30). These diff
 erences 
remained, but were attenuated after adjustment for 
region, education, and deprivation. However, the 
reduction in prevalence of any disability increased 
further (1·36, 1·27–1·47) after adjustment, and the 
lowered prevalence of fair–poor SPH was not 
statistically 
signifi
 cant 
(1·02, 
0·89–1·17) 
after 
adjustment. The raised prevalence of any disability was 
not accounted for by changes in cognitive impairment 
(1·56, 1·44–1·68) or by vision or hearing problems 
(1·33, 1·21–1·44). However, lessened prevalence of 
moderate–severe disability was not signifi
 cant after 
adjustment for changes in cognitive impairment (0·99, 
0·90–1·09).
Between 1991 and 2011, we identifi
 ed absolute 
compression of cognitive morbidity at age 65 years for 
women, with gains in CIFLE of 4·4 years (95% CI 4·3–4·5) 
and a drop in years with any cognitive impairment (CILE) 
of 0·7 years (0·2–1·3); the decrease in CILE consisted of a 
signifi
 cant decrease in years with mild or moderate–
severe cognitive impairment (fi
 gure, table 2). Although 
CIFLE for men aged 65 years rose by 4·2 years (4·2–4·3) 
and the proportion of life spent cognitive-impairment free 
increased, we identifi
 ed no signifi
 cant decrease in CILE of 
any severity (fi
 gure, table 2).
For SPH, we identifi
 ed a compression of morbidity for 
men and women, with signifi
 cantly enhanced HLE 
(3·8 years for men [95% CI 3·5–4·1] and 3·1 years for 
women [2·7–3·4]), although these increases were less 
than those in life expectancy. Additionally, we identifi
 ed 
a signifi
 cantly increased proportion of healthy remaining 
life (4·2 percentage points [2·0–6·5] for men and 
3·0 percentage points [1·0–4·9] for women; fi
 gure, 
table 
3). 
For 
disability, 
we 
identifi
 ed 
dynamic 
equilibrium, since the proportion of years of disability-
free life fell substantially (5·3 percentage points 
[3·4–7·2] for men and 9·3 percentage points [7·5–11·1] 
for women), although the increase in number of years 
with any disability was higher for years with mild 
disability (1·3 years [1·1–1·6] for men and 2·5 years 
[2·2–2·8] for women) than for years with moderate or 
severe disability (0·5 years [0·3–0·8] for men and 
0·6 years [0·3–0·9] for women; fi
 gure, table 4). Time 
patterns at age 85 years were similar but with absolute 
compression of cognitive morbidity and a reduction in 
the proportion of life spent disability free seen only in 
women (appendix). CILE and life expectancy with 
moderate–severe disability are fairly constant with age 
(fi
 gure).
Sensitivity analyses were done for CIFLE, assuming 
non-responders had twice the risk of severe cognitive 
impairment as responders, but had no eff
 ect on changes 
in CIFLE over time.
Discussion
Whether people are living longer, healthier lives than 
previously and compressing morbidity into a shorter 
period is a key concern for government, for society as a 
whole, and for individuals and their families. Our 
fi
 ndings show that the answer crucially depends on how 
health is measured, with absolute compression observed 
for cognitive morbidity, relative compression observed 
for SPH, and dynamic equilibrium observed for 
disability. The increase of 4·4 years for women at age 
65 years in CIFLE between 1991 and 2011 was more than 
the increase in life expectancy (3·6 years), with 
measurable falls in years with mild (0·5 years [0·3–0·8]) 
and moderate–severe cognitive impairment (0·2 years 
[0·1–0·4]), supporting previous fi
 ndings of a decrease in 
prevalence of dementia during this period (panel).22 
Moreover, women spend on average around twice as 
many years cognitively impaired as do men, and these 
values are fairly constant with age, as shown by other 
studies.35,36 Findings for disability are less positive than 
those for cognitive impairment, with a decrease in the 
proportion of remaining life spent disability free, 
although the severity of disability seems to be milder 
than previously.
Cognitive impairment is one reason for diffi
  culty in 
calculation of IADLs and BADLs, and our fi
 ndings 
suggest that reduced moderate–severe disability was a 
result of decreased cognitive impairment, although 
increases in any disability were not a result of cognitive 
impairment. Rises in IADLs and BADLs might be due to 
increased prevalence of other specifi
 c diseases or physical

or sensory functional limitations.37 Our analyses showed 
that problems with vision and hearing (self-report or 
interviewer observed) did not account for rises in 
disability. By contrast, analysis of health trends from 1992 
to 2007 for the population aged 65 years and older from 
the Health Survey for England showed stability in 
self-care activities but increased obesity and mobility 
limitations (walking 200 yards and climbing stairs), 
which might contribute to gains in mild disability.3 This 
fi
 nding accords well with evidence of high prevalence of 
arthritis in later young-old (aged 65–69 years) cohorts in 
one centre in CFAS I.38
Our study has limitations because of non-response and 
the subjectivity of two of the measures. Non-response was 
higher in CFAS II than in CFAS I, as is common in 
population-based studies. Reasons for non-response did 
not diff
 er between the studies, although some reasons for 
refusal (by others on behalf of frail individuals, and by 
very active individuals) became more prominent.22 
Because these reasons aff
 ect both good and poor health, 
they are unlikely to substantially bias the overall estimate 
from CFAS II, as our sensitivity analyses and those of a 
previous study22 showed. Moreover, these reasons would 
probably result in diff
 erences in the same direction for all 
the health measures, which we did not fi
 nd. The only 
diff
 erence in study design between CFAS I and CFAS II 
was the change from two-stage sampling (prevalence 
screen followed by assessment) in CFAS I to a combined 
screen and assessment in CFAS II. Since all our health 
measures are derived from the initial prevalence screen, 
our fi
 ndings are not aff
 ected by this change in study 
design or by the attrition that occurred between screen 
and assessment in CFAS I. Both disability and SPH are 
self-reported and might be subject to temporal changes in 
health expectations and thresholds for admission of 
activity limitation, although self-report of IADLs and 
BADLs and objective performance measures in very old 
people (aged 85 years) are consistent in one of the CFAS 
regions.39 Finally, adjustment of health expectancies for 
education, deprivation, or both needs longitudinal data 
since life tables are not routinely available for these factors.
One might question what additional information is 
provided by health expectancy over other measures, since 
the amount of ill health in a population is often measured 
by prevalence alone. Nevertheless, as populations age, 
with more people surviving to the oldest age groups, in 
which the prevalence of chronic disorders is highest, the 
overall population prevalence of ill health might increase 
without individuals being at higher risk of ill health than 
they were previously. We show this eff
 ect by the true 
age-specifi
 c population and mortality rates for women in 
1991 and 2011 and a hypothetical prevalence of ill health 
in 1991 (appendix). Despite a 20% lower prevalence of ill 
health in each age group in 2011, the overall prevalence 
in 2011 (9·7%) is higher than that in 1991 (9·3%), and, 
because of the increased numbers of people at the 
greatest risk, the absolute number of unhealthy 
individuals is larger. Health expectancy provides an 
integrated approach because it takes into account both 
the changes in living with ill health (prevalence) and 
changes in mortality that are responsible for increased 
life expectancy. However, health expectancies are 
independent of population size. Thus, application of 
hypothetical prevalence in the example to the true life 
tables for 1991 and 2011 results in an increase of 
3·2 healthy years at age 65 years. Improvement of 
population health in addition to population ageing 
results in an increase in the part of life expectancy spent 
healthy, even with an increase in the overall prevalence of 
ill health due to more people being at risk. Health 
expectancy is therefore a potent means to identify 
interactions between health, ill health, and mortality.
Although years free of ill health defi
 ned by all 
measures have increased during the past two decades, 
absolute compression was observed only for cognitive 
impairment, and women in particular spend a smaller 
proportion of remaining life disability free and more 
years with mild disability than they did previously. The 
paradox that women have worse health but better 
Panel: Research in context 
Systematic review
We updated a previous review of trends in health expectancies21 by searching MEDLINE 
and Web of Science (from Jan 1, 2009, to March 30, 2014) with the search terms “healthy 
life years”, “free life expectancy”, “active life expectancy”, “healthy life expectancy”, 
“health expectancy”, and “years of healthy life”. We excluded studies with only one 
timepoint. We identifi
 ed no UK studies that included the population in care settings or 
that reported time diff
 erences in cognitive-impairment-free life expectancy.
Interpretation
Time diff
 erences in health expectancies based on self-rated health and disability are more 
numerous than those based on cognitive function and are often available nationally. Our 
fi
 ndings of compression in fair–poor self-perceived health are in line with others across 
Europe.29,30 Evidence of expansion of mild disability has been reported elsewhere,31,32 
although some countries have experienced compression of disability.2,33 For the UK, 
estimates of health expectancies for the total population, including people in institutions, 
are only available from the 10-year censuses, and because the underlying disability 
(limiting longstanding illness) question changed between 1991 and 2001, our time 
diff
 erences with identical questions and study design provide a more accurate view of 
change than does the census.
Reduced mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke will have contributed to 
increased life expectancy, but would probably increase years with cognitive impairment 
and moderate or severe disability, for which we showed no evidence. However, evidence 
suggests that prevalence of sensory impairments (hearing and sight) and cognitive 
impairment, have likewise reduced in the past two decades, together with measured 
markers of disease such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and C-reactive protein,3 all of 
which, through improved disease management, might have reduced the severity of 
disability. Nevertheless, increased obesity and mobility limitations, and increased 
prevalence of arthritis, might have contributed to increases in mild disability. We have 
previously elucidated the contribution of specifi
 c diseases and disorders to disability-free 
life expectancy.34 We need to quantify whether our fi
 ndings are due to diseases and 
disorders becoming less disabling during the past two decades.

survival than men is dependent on the set of minor 
health defi

investigate which diseases and disorders are responsible 
for increased mild disability and whether patterns 
prevail across all regions. Nevertheless, our fi

have important implications for government, employers, 
and individuals, specifi

pension age and extension of working life, and for
