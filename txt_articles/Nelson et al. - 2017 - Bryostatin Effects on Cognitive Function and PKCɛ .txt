Abstract. Bryostatin 1, a potent activator of protein kinase C epsilon (PKC�), has been shown to reverse synaptic loss
and facilitate synaptic maturation in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Fragile X, stroke, and other neurological
disorders. In a single-dose (25 �g/m2) randomized double-blind Phase IIa clinical trial, bryostatin levels reached a maximum
at 1-2 h after the start of infusion. In close parallel with peak blood levels of bryostatin, an increase of PBMC PKC� was
measured (p = 0.0185) within 1 h from the onset of infusion. Of 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD, of which 6 received
drug and 3 received vehicle within a double-blind protocol, bryostatin increased the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
score by +1.83 ± 0.70 unit at 3 h versus –1.00 ± 1.53 unit for placebo. Bryostatin was well tolerated in these AD patients and
no drug-related adverse events were reported. The 25 �g/m2 administered dose was based on prior clinical experience with
three Expanded Access advanced AD patients treated with bryostatin, in which return of major functions such as swallowing,
vocalization, and word recognition were noted. In one Expanded Access patient trial, elevated PKC� levels closely tracked
cognitive benefits in the first 24 weeks as measured by MMSE and ADCS-ADL psychometrics. Pre-clinical mouse studies
showed effective activation of PKC� and increased levels of BDNF and PSD-95. Together, these Phase IIa, Expanded Access,
and pre-clinical results provide initial encouragement for bryostatin 1 as a potential treatment for AD.

INTRODUCTION
In addition to amyloid plaques and neurofibril-
lary tangles, an important pathologic hallmark of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is synaptic loss, which
results in cognitive dysfunction and memory loss.
In a recent study, protein kinase C isozyme epsilon
(PKCε) was found to be deficient in fresh frozen
hippocampal brain samples from AD versus con-
trol patients [1]. PKCε is a signaling enzyme known
to be involved in learning and memory [2] and

participates in synaptic growth and synaptogenesis
[3, 4]. PKCε activators such as bryostatin 1 and
DCPLA methyl ester are capable of preventing and/or
reversing synaptic loss in various disease models
including aged rats [5], AD transgenic mice [6], and
rats subjected to neuronal and synaptic loss from
ischemia/hypoxia [7, 8]. They elevate BDNF and
facilitate synaptic maturation [9] even in normal ani-
mals during learning and memory [3]. If these com-
pounds have similar effects in humans, they could
be of value for treating the synaptic loss in AD and
other neurodegenerative disorders such as Fragile X
mental retardation, stroke, and traumatic brain injury,
thereby ameliorating loss of memory, restoring other
cognitive functions, and preserving the quality of life.

T.J. Nelson et al. / Bryostatin in Alzheimer’s Disease
However, little is known about the safety, pharma-
cokinetics, or efficacy of bryostatin 1 in AD patients.
Bryostatin 1 activates PKCε by binding to the C1A
and C1B domains of conventional and novel isoforms
of PKC [10–12], which bind the natural ligand 1,2-
diacylglycerol (DAG) [13]. Bryostatin 1 has highest
affinity for PKC� and ε [14–16]. Like DAG, bryo-
statin 1 produces a time-dependent biphasic effect
on PKCε beginning with an initial activation accom-
panied by membrane translocation [17, 18]. Once
activated, PKCε is proteolytically degraded in a pro-
cess called downregulation [19], which lasts up to
24 h, followed by de novo synthesis that restores nor-
mal levels [20].
PKCε activation is an obligatory step prior to
downregulation [21, 22]. Thus, downregulation can
serve as an indicator of earlier PKCε activation, as
the scheme here shows:
Bryostatin 1 has been extensively tested clini-
cally as a treatment for cancer [23–35], for which
it was considered as a PKC inhibitor due to its ability
to downregulate PKC. Downregulation is particu-
larly significant at higher doses of bryostatin, e.g.,
>30 �g/m2/week. Downregulation may potentially
complicatethetherapeuticuseofbryostatin1because
it could produce effects that are different or even
opposite from activation. Therefore, it is important
to optimize clinical trial protocols to maximize the
lower dose biochemical effect of PKCε activation.
Here, we report on initial human clinical trials of
bryostatin1inADincludinganinitialPhaseIIasafety
and tolerability study and Expanded Access trials. In
addition to activation, we demonstrate here in AD
patients that bryostatin also increases the levels of
PKCε (see below) that are associated with cognitive
improvement. Results are also included from pre-
clinical testing of bryostatin 1 in mice from which
blood-brain distribution parameters, pharmacokinet-
ics, and dose-dependent mechanism(s) of action
guided the clinical trial protocols described here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drug manufacturing and administration
Bryostatin 1 for animal experiments and biochem-
ical testing was obtained from Tocris. Bryostatin 1
for clinical trials was generously provided by
the National Cancer Institute. Sterile injectable
bryostatin 1 and diluent were manufactured by
Lyophilization Technology, Inc., Ivyland, PA. Bryo-
statin 1 was produced as a sterile lyophilized cake
in 10 ml lyophilized sterile vials containing 50 �g
bryostatin 1 and 2.5 mg Povidone C17, USP. Placebo
was prepared identically except that bryostatin 1 was
omitted. Sterile PET Diluent was made in 10 ml ster-
ile vials and contained 1 ml solution of polyethylene
glycol 400 (60%), dehydrated ethanol, USP (30%),
and Polysorbate 80, USP (10%), v/v. Povidone C17
was a generous gift of Ashland Chemical Co., Wayne,
NJ. Pure bryostatin 1 was stored at –20◦C. The
bryostatin 1, placebo, and PET diluent drug prod-
uct were stored in controlled access chambers at +2
to +8◦C. The identity, purity, and stability of the
drug substance and drug product were confirmed by
mass spectrometry [36], HPLC, UV spectroscopy,
and IR spectroscopy at 6-month intervals. The iden-
tity, ethanol content, and viscosity of the PET diluent
were also confirmed at 6-month intervals. Moisture
content was measured at 6-month intervals by pulsed
coulometric KF titration using Hydranal Coulomat
AK (Sigma-Aldrich) in a Mettler Toledo C20 titra-
tor. Sterility and endotoxin content were confirmed
every 6 months by Alcami, Wilmington, NC.
Bryostatin 1 or placebo was administered by dis-
solving the contents of one vial in 1 ml PET diluent,
followed by dilution with 9 ml of 0.9% sodium chlo-
ride injection, USP. This solution was then injected
into a 250-ml Baxter non-DEHP-non-PVC Intravia
polyolefin-lined saline IV bag. Hospira polyethylene
lined tubing was used. The bryostatin 1 was adminis-
tered to the EA patient by drip infusion over a period
of 1 h. PVC tubing and bags were avoided because
previous research showed that bryostatin 1 could bind
to PVC.
Stability tests showed that the bryostatin 1 concen-
tration thus prepared was stable at room temperature
in PVC-free infusion bags for at least 21 days. Bryo-
statin was stable in glass vials containing 9 ml saline
for at least 10 days at room temperature. Aqueous
solutions of bryostatin were found to bind to PVC
containers but not to polypropylene or glass. Bryo-
statin dissolved as 10% solutions in ethanol or DMSO
was stable for at least 30 days in glass containers.

including vascular dementia (modified Hachinski
Ischemic Scale ≥5), cerebral tumor, Huntington’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, major depression, psy-
chotic episodes, agitation, epilepsy, uncompensated

Efficacy and safety endpoints
The primary objective was an evaluation of
the safety and tolerability of bryostatin. Sec-
ondary objectives were a preliminary assessment
of pharmacokinetics and effects on cognitive func-
tion. Behavioral outcome measures were MMSE,
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive
(ADAS-cog), Clinician’s Interview-Based Impres-
sionofChange-plus(CIBIC-plus),ClinicalDementia
Rating (CDR), Severe Impairment Battery (SIB),
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R),
and Alzheimer’s disease Cooperative Study Activ-
ities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) at 24, 48, and
72 h post dose. Subjects were given baseline EKG,
CBC, hematology, HIV/Hepatitis B screening and
urinalysis for blood alcohol, drug and pregnancy
screening. Vital signs were monitored at baseline
and at intervals up to 24 h post infusion. A fol-
low up examination was conducted four weeks
after treatment. Blood was drawn for PKC within
30 min prior to infusion and at 15, 30, and 60 min
after start of infusion, and 20 min, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48,
and 72 h post infusion. Peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood on
site and shipped on dry ice to our laboratory
for analysis within 48 h. Blood was also drawn
at the same time points and shipped to a com-
mercial GLP lab for bryostatin 1 pharmacokinetic
measurement.
Human clinical trials
The
Single
Patient
Expanded
Access
study
(BRY-SPEA-JM) and the Phase IIa clinical trial
(NTRP101-201) were conducted under a U.S. IND
(IND 71,276) and received approval from the relevant
InstitutionalReviewBoards.Expandedaccesspatient
#2 was treated at Marshall University, Charleston,
WV. Expanded access patient #3 was treated at Via
Christi Hospitals, Wichita, KS. The Phase IIa trial
was conducted by the CRO Parexel at Glendale
Adventist Hospital, Glendale, CA under the supervi-
sion of our corporate partner, Neurotrope BioScience,
Inc. Human studies were performed in compliance
with the protocol and in accordance with Good Clin-
ical Practice (GCP) (International Conference on
Harmonization [ICH], Guidance E6, 1996, principles
of human subject protection), and applicable country-
specific regulatory requirements.
Subjects
The
Phase
II
safety
study
(Identifier
NCT02221947) included nine subjects (4 male
and 5 female) ranging in age from 62 to 82 with a
clinical diagnosis of probable AD. The mean age
was 71.8 ± 7.4. MMSE was measured 3 h, 4 days,
and 15 days after infusion; however, based on earlier
animal studies [37], only short-term improvements
in cognition from a single dosing were expected.
Bryostatin 1 administration in mice
Bryostatin 1 (Tocris, 10 �g/vial) was dissolved
in 10 �l dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted
to 100 �l in sterile normal saline. We administered
bryostatin 1 to groups of 3 to 6 male C57BL/6 N
mice through the lateral tail vein and samples were
collected after a delay ranging from 1 h to 28 d.
The injection schedules and dosages are shown in
Table 1. Twelve control groups of 3 or 4 mice
each, injected with vehicle on the same days as
the treated groups, were also used. All animal stud-
ies were conducted in accordance with AAALAC
guidelines.
Mouse assays
PSD-95, pPSD-95, and synaptophysin were mea-
sured by western blotting. We also measured
brain BDNF, pro BDNF, and neuron-specific eno-
lase (NSE) in unfractionated brain extracts using

once or twice per week at the indicated dosage. At the specified delay after the last injection, blood PBMCs and brain were collected and
PKCε, BDNF, and PSD-95 were measured as described in Methods. Equal numbers of control animals were injected with vehicle on the
same schedule. � = Injection of bryostatin at the indicated dose or a vehicle control. ✗ = Collection date at specified delay (1 or 24 h) after

commercial ELISA kits (Abnova, Abnova, and
MyBioSource, respectively).
PKCε measurement
PBMCs
were
isolated
from
blood
in
ani-
mal experiments by centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque
(GE Healthcare) in 12 ml Accuspin tubes (Sigma-
Aldrich). PBMCs were isolated in the clinical exper-
iments from blood drawn into 8 ml Vacutainer Cell
Preparation Tubes (CPT Tubes) containing sodium
heparin and Ficoll (BD, red/green) and crude PBMCs
wereisolatedaccordingtothemanufacturer’sinstruc-
tions. Due to the lability of PKC, only a single step
of purification was performed. PBMCs were stored
at –70 to –80◦C for up to 72 h and homogenized by
sonication in 330 �l PBS and 10 �l were taken for
protein measurement. Brain tissue was homogenized
by sonication in 3 volumes of ice-cold 1× phosphate-
buffered saline (pH 7.4) using a 1/16” microprobe
and Misonix S-4000 ultrasonic sonicator set at ampli-
tude = 10% (32 �m) for 30 s (approx. 113 joules).
A portion of the homogenate was fractionated
by ultracentrifugation (10 min, 100000 × g, Beck-
man Max-XP) for PKCε measurement. The cytosol
fraction (320 �l in PBS) was put on ice and the partic-
ulate fraction was re-suspended to its original volume
(320 �l) by adding cold PBS + 1% Tween-20 and
sonicating on ice for 5 s. Because PKC is very labile,
sampleswerenotprocessedfurtherbutappliedimme-
diately to isozyme-specific ELISA plates (USCNK
Life Science, Inc.) which had been coated with flat
black paint on the outside to minimize cross-talk.
Each measurement was done with 4 or 8 replicates.
Samples were diluted with appropriate buffer to make
the final Tween-20 concentrations the same.
Plates were processed according to the direc-
tions of the manufacturer except that the plates were
washed five times and they were centrifuged in an
Eppendorf 5804 refrigerated centrifuge with an A-2-
DWP swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 2250 × g
after each wash. Plates were developed with Thermo
Supersignal Femto reagent and chemiluminescence
was recorded in a BioTek Synergy HT microplate
reader. The microplate reader was calibrated weekly
using a luminescence test plate (BioTek). Subcellular
localization of PKCε in brain was calculated as the
ratio of PKCε in membrane / (membrane + cytosol)
fractions. All measurements were compared with
control mice injected over the same period of time
with vehicle only. The PKCε method was validated
according to FDA Guidance document on Bioanalyt-
ical Method Validation (2001).
Bryostatin measurement
Bryostatin 1 in the EA subject was measured by
LCMS using a Thermo/Dionex NCP-3200RS gradi-
ent nanopump attached to an Acclaim Pepmap 100
180 �m × 5 cm C18 3 �m capillary column (100 ˚
A
particle size) at a flow rate of 1.5 �l/min. Samples
werepassedintoaNanosprayFlexIonESIsourceand
analyzed with a Thermo TSQ triple-quadrupole mass
spectrometer in SRM mode as previously described
[36]. Bryostatin in the Phase IIa samples was mea-
sured by a commercial cGLP laboratory using the
method of Zhao et al. [38].
Statistical analysis
P-values were calculated using Student’s t test.
PKCε ratio values were calculated using standard

error propagation techniques. Pharmacokinetic half-

Other statistics, including power analysis, were
calculated in R. ANOVAs were calculated using
R and followed up with Tukey HSD multiple
comparisons of means (95% family-wise confidence
level). One-way robust repeated measures ANOVAs
were calculated by the method of Wilcox [39].
RESULTS
Human Phase IIa clinical trial
We conducted a parallel randomized double-blind
Phase IIa trial with 6 subjects receiving a single i.v.
doseofbryostatin1at25 �g/m2 and3subjectsreceiv-
ing a placebo. The primary objective was an evalu-
ation of the safety and tolerability of bryostatin 1.
The secondary objective was a preliminary assess-
ment of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
effects on cognitive function in patients with AD.
No deaths or SAEs occurred and no subject had an
AE leading to withdrawal from the study. No myal-
gia was reported. Three subjects experienced minor
adverse events (headache, dizziness, or rash). The
headache occurred in a bryostatin patient and was
not considered related to the drug. All hematology,
blood chemistry, coagulation, renal function, liver
function,andcardiacassessmentswereunremarkable
after treatment. There were no clinically significant
changes in any vital signs.
Bryostatin reached peak plateau level within 1 h
for all 6 patients infused with the drug (Fig. 1). Bryo-
statin 1 treatment increased MMSE score at 3 h after
the end of infusion (p = 0.041, paired t-test; Table 2,
Fig. 2) but not at later times (not shown). MMSE
scores of the placebos at 3 h were not statistically sig-
nificant from baseline values. Although the change in
the treated group at 3 h was statistically significant,
considerably larger numbers of subjects would be
needed to draw definitive conclusions about efficacy.
Based on earlier animal studies [37], only short-term
improvements in cognition from a single dosing were
expected. Other tests (ADAS-cog, CIBIC-plus, CDR,
SIB, HVLT-R, and ADCS-ADL) were either ham-
pered by incomplete data or showed no statistically
significant change in cognitive level.
Based on the 1 h bryostatin results, we analyzed
PBMC PKCε levels at 1 h. Bryostatin 1 treatment
increased PBMC PKCε levels at 1 h (p = 0.0185,
repeated measures ANOVA, Fig. 3a) followed by
Fig. 1. Bryostatin elevation in Phase IIa subjects. Plasma bryo-
statin was measured by LCMS. All 6 bryostatin-infused (1-h
infusion of 25 �g/m2, single dose) subjects showed peak elevation
of bryostatin at 1-2 h after the start of infusion. Y-axis = ng bryo-
statin / ml. Each data point represents mean ± SEM of six patients.
Only samples from bryostatin-treated patients were measured.

Bryostatin Efficacy on Cognitive Function in blinded Phase IIa
trial. A single i.v. infusion was followed 3 h, 4 d, and 15 d after
infusion by a cognitive evaluation with the Mini-Mental State
Examination-2 (MMSE-2). MMSE scores in bryostatin-treated
subjects were increased at 3 h (p = 0.041, paired t-test). MMSE
scores of the treated groups at other times or of the placebos at 3
h were not significantly different from the corresponding baseline
values.
a long-term downregulation between 12 and 72 h
(p = 0.0296, two-tailed paired t-test, Fig. 3b). PKCε
values in PBMC samples were fairly reproducible
from a given patient over time, but PBMCs from
different patients had widely different PKC values.
Thus the differences in t = 0 values are not significant
and the relatively large error bars shown in Fig. 3 are
the result of large patient-to-patient variation. The
highest PKCε level occurred 1 h post infusion, in
close correspondence to the peak levels of bryostatin
measured in the patient’s blood samples. Based on
the preclinical data described below, the dose cho-
sen, 25 �g/m2 i.v., was predicted to be sufficient
to activate PKCε and induce increased synthesis of
synaptogenic factors such as BDNF and PSD-95 (See
Preclinical Experiments below).

discrete integers on a scale from 0 (severe dementia) to 30 (nor-
mal). MMSE scores in bryostatin-treated subjects were increased
at 3 h (p = 0.041, paired t-test) but not at 4d or 15d (not shown).
Human Expanded Access (EA) subjects
In contrast to the Phase IIa trial, in which sub-
jects received a single infusion, EA subjects received
up to 26 infusions over a period of up to 46 weeks
(Table 3). Based on earlier pre-clinical studies of
cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection in three
different AD transgenic mouse strains, and also based
on earlier clinical studies for oncologic indications,
we hypothesized that an optimal bryostatin treat-
ment protocol would be a dose of 25 �g/m2 for 3
successive weeks followed by several lower doses
of gradually increased spacing. These doses are
4.8–12 × lower than many doses given previously in
some cancer trials [23, 24] but comparable to others
[40–42]. Bryostatin infusion produced clinically rel-
evant improvements in assessed behavior in all three
patients (Table 3). Psychometric assessment was not
possible in subjects #1 and #2 because both were
non-verbal.
Subject #1
EA subject #1 was given multiple infusions over
a period of 5 months. He became more alert and

infusion (Bryostatin F(7.013, 21.039) = 3.026, p = 0.023; placebo F(10,20) = 0.75, p = 0.67, repeated measures ANOVA; p = 0.0185 at 1 h,
two-tailed matched pair t-test) Bryostatin also decreased PKCε between 12 h and 72 h (p = 0.0296, two-tailed matched pair t-test, average of
12, 48, and 72 h points). Data points are mean PKCε in arbitrary units ± SEM (Placebo, n = 3; Bryostatin 1, n = 6). The treated and placebo
groups are not significantly different at t = 0.

feeding), primitive conversational interaction, and
some increased range of limb motion. Treatment was

infusion.
Within 3 h of the first infusion, Subject #3’s MMSE
rose from a baseline of 3 to 12. The MMSE score
remained within the 10–12 range for 1-2 weeks, and
remained between 5 and 12 thereafter (Fig. 4, green).
These improvements of the MMSE roughly paral-
leled the changes of the ADCS-ADL. Improvements
in cognitive function early in the course of treat-
ment were also noted by the health care workers
and caregivers. The patient, who had previously been
largely immobile and absorbed in constant halluci-
nations that had occurred for many months prior to
the bryostatin trial, became free of hallucinations,
became mobile, able to feed himself, care for bod-
ily functions, speak and recognize words, interact

billiards. CIBIC-Plus score returned to ‘minimally
improved’ after 7 months. By 9 months, the MMSE
score declined to 5. As dosing became much less
frequent his deficits and symptoms, including hallu-
cinations, returned. Treatment was terminated when
caregivers requested a change to a different residen-
tial facility.
After the first 3 doses administered to Subject #3,
the pre-infusion levels of PKCε increased by 140%,
and then became profoundly downregulated to about
25% of the baseline value, gradually returning to
and finally exceeding baseline levels (Fig. 4, blue).
These levels, consistent with downregulation, recov-
ered gradually as the intervals between bryostatin
doses were progressively increased. The blue curve
in Fig. 4 shows only the values of the preinfusion total
PKCε before each dose. There was an apparent corre-
spondence in the first 24 weeks between the changes
observed in the MMSE and the ADCL-ADL and the
changes of PBMC PKCε (Fig. 4a); however, the cor-
relation was not statistically significant. In the second
partofthistrial,explorationoflowerandlessfrequent
doses was conducted. These doses resulted in lower
efficacy (Fig. 4b). As an exploratory trial, these inter-
val changes were made in an effort to optimize PKCε
induction and activation and to minimize downreg-
ulation. No changes in serum chemistry, CBC, or
vital signs except for moderate weight loss (82.7 to
75.9 kg) were noted throughout the treatment. The
only AE was Grade 1 mild myalgia at 6 weeks,
which roughly coincided with the period of greatest
PKCε downregulation. It resolved completely after
two 500 mg tablets of Tylenol. Myalgia has been fre-
quently observed in cancer trials after bryostatin 1
treatment and is the dose-limiting toxicity at higher
doses [41, 44, 45].
Bryostatin 1 blood plasma levels in Subject #3,
measured by LCMS [35], reached a maximum of
0.4-0.5 nM within 1 h after infusion (Fig. 5). Over
the course of the treatment we observed a gradual
increase in the baseline level of bryostatin mea-
sured between infusions. To determine whether this
apparent increase in half-life could be accounted
for by accumulation of bryostatin 1, we created a
two-compartment pharmacokinetic model based on
our earlier mouse results [36]. The pharmacokinetic
parameters were calculated using our previous data
on the time course of bryostatin 1 in mouse blood
plasma, measured by LCMS (Fig. 6). The fitted
parameters were comparable to those measured in
mice by Zhang et al. [46]. The lower curve represents
thebryostatininbrain(solidtriangles = measuredval-
ues; solid line = fitted curve).
The simulation showed that the accumulation of
bryostatin was due a decrease in the rate constant
of elimination from the slower compartment. The

apparent half-life of elimination, calculated by com-
paring pre- and post-dose blood plasma levels for
each administration, increased from 32 to 200 h dur-
ing the course of treatment (Fig. 5B). Post-infusion
values (filled circles) were not at the peak of the
simulated values in all cases, indicating that these
blood samples were drawn near but not precisely at
the point of peak plasma concentration.
Preclinical experiments
To test optimization of the doses used both in
the Phase IIa and the Expanded Access trials, we
conducted exploratory tests of different protocols by
administering bryostatin 1 to male C57BL/6N mice
with i.v. bolus injections (each over 20 s) through the
tail vein. We used the mouse results to develop our
model, which was needed to interpret the long-term
human results. We also used the mouse PKC results
(below) to inform the dosing schedule. Groups of
mice were injected biweekly, weekly, semiweekly (1
on/1 off), or intermittently (3 on/3 off) using up to
six doses of 10, 15, 20, or 25 �g/m2 (see Table 1 for
injection schedules). Blood PBMCs and brain were
collected at 1 h or 24 h after the last dose. We mea-
sured total PKCε by isozyme-specific ELISA in brain
extracts and PBMCs isolated from blood. Subcellular
localization of PKCε in brain was calculated as the
ratio of PKCε in membrane / (membrane + cytosol)
fractions. We also measured brain BDNF, proBDNF,
PSD-95, pPSD-95, and synaptophysin in unfraction-
ated brain extracts. All measurements were compared
with control mice injected on the same days with
vehicle only.
Mouse brain BDNF
As reported earlier [5, 47, 48], bryostatin 1
increased the brain levels of total BDNF (mature
+ pro-BDNF forms) by up to 100% (Fig. 7, top).
The elevation in BDNF increased linearly with the
number of successive injections given at one week
intervals, with the largest effects observed 24 h after
3 weeks of 25 �g/m2 bryostatin 1 weekly. Increas-
ing the dose frequency to twice per week elevated
BDNF at lower doses (15 and 20 �g/m2), indicating
that repeated dosing has a cumulative effect. Other
dosing schedules, including 1 on/1 off (alternating
weeks), and 2 doses of 25 �g/m2 followed by alter-
nating weeks of 20 �g/m2 (2 × 25 + 20 1 on/1 off),
produced little or no elevation of BDNF (not shown).
Little change in BDNF was observed in samples col-
lected 1 h after injection (not shown). No significant
changes were observed for BDNF in blood plasma or
for proBDNF in brain (not shown).
The nonlinearity of the dosage response relation-
ship suggested the possibility that the elevation of
BDNF could be a toxic effect. However, no changes
in blood plasma neuron-specific enolase, a marker for
neuronal death [49, 50], were observed in any sample.
Thus, we conclude that bryostatin needs to be above a
threshold level to produce an increase in BDNF, and
that BDNF is not a response to toxic cell injury by
bryostatin 1.
Mouse brain PSD-95
PSD-95 also increased after successive doses of
25 �g/m2 bryostatin 1 treatment (Fig. 7, middle).
No other statistically significant correlation between
PKCε and BDNF, PSD-95, or synaptophysin was
observed at either 1 h or 24 h. No changes were
observed for pPSD-95 (not shown).
Mouse brain PKCε
While single infusions in humans produced a
transient elevation of PKCε, the principal observ-
able effect of bryostatin 1 injected at 25 �g/m2
in mouse, measured both 1 h and 24 h after the
last dose, was downregulation of total brain PKCε
(F(40,74) = 12.48, p < 0.0001, ANOVA) (Fig. 7,

bottom). This is consistent with the known effects
of C1-domain PKC activators, whereby enzyme
activation and translocation are followed by rapid
downregulation due to proteasomal activity. Enzy-
matic PKC activity was generally consistent with
the ELISA results (not shown). PKCε downregula-
tion was more severe in PBMC cells, but also more
variable (not shown).
We also measured membrane translocation, which
is
accepted
as
an
index
of
PKC
activation.
 532
T.J. Nelson et al. / Bryostatin in Alzheimer’s Disease
Translocation is defined as PKC in membrane / Total
PKC; thus a value of 1.00 signifies complete mem-
brane translocation. Bryostatin 1 produced maximal
membrane translocation at 15 �g/m2 for 3 weeks
and 25 �g/m2 for 2 weeks when measured 24 h after
administration (not shown). Mice with higher translo-
cation generally also had higher downregulation,
consistent with the known life cycle for PKC. In
mouse brain the baseline level of translocation was
0.775 ± 0.032 (mean ± SE, N = 33); therefore, a 29%
increase in the ratio would represent essentially 100%
membrane localization.
DISCUSSION
This was the first clinical study of bryostatin 1 in
AD patients. Bryostatin 1 produced large changes
in PKCε during the early course of treatment both
in mice and in the EA patient, indicating effective
target engagement. Peak levels of PKCε occurred
within 1 h of infusion onset. Long-term treatment
induced downregulation of PKCε that was dependent
on dosing levels and duration. Administration of the
highest doses used here (25 �g/m2) for 5 of 6 suc-
cessive weeks produced measurable downregulation.
Downregulation is a well-documented phenomenon
that results from the transient nature of PKCε C1
domain activation in neurons [11, 12], after which
PKC becomes dephosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and
degraded primarily by the proteasome. Our previous
results showed that a brief pulse of PKCε activation
produces prolonged protein synthesis that lasts for
at least one week [51]. Thus, PKCε activators can
produce long-term changes that continue well after
the drug has been eliminated. Bryostatin produces a
markedimprovementinperformanceof5XFADmice
in the water maze memory task, and also improves
performance in unimpaired wild-type animals [3].
Further research on the mechanisms of PKCε biosyn-
thesis and degradation will be necessary in order
to derive the numerical relationship between PBMC
PKCε, brain PKCε, brain BDNF, and synaptoge-
nesis that is needed for PKCε to be useful as a
biomarker.
The Phase IIa trial results are consistent with our
animal testing [3, 52] which indicated an early cogni-
tive enhancement within hours of the first dosing. In
EA Subject #3, the PKCε appeared to correlate with
the psychometric scores in the early part of treatment,
even though the correlation did not reach statistical
significance. The threshold effect on BDNF noted
in our preclinical results suggests that the frequency
of dosing might be a critical factor in determining
effectiveness of bryostatin.
Repeated infusions of bryostatin over several
months in EA Subject #3 led to an accumulation
of blood plasma levels reaching 0.1 nM up to 2
weeks after infusion. Simulations showed that this
accumulation could not be described by a fixed elim-
ination rate, and that a 6-fold decrease in elimination
rate was necessary to account for the increased pre-
infusion levels. This could be attributed to disease
progression or to gradual drug accumulation in a
slowly equilibrating compartment. By contrast, in the
Phase IIa trial, in which a single infusion was given,
the time course was characterized by rapid elimina-
tion. Although samples in the Phase IIa study were
collected out to 14 days, the sensitivity of the assay
used in the Phase IIa trial (lower limit of quantita-
tion = 0.2 ng/ml) was insufficient to perform detailed
pharmacokinetic modeling. The increased half-life of
bryostatin 1 when administered over long periods
suggests that future trials should consider possi-
ble bryostatin accumulation over long intervals of
dosing.
The neuroprotective effects of bryostatin 1 may
be due to its ability to induce synaptogenesis by
elevating levels of synaptic growth factors in brain
such as BDNF [47, 53] and other synaptic growth
factors. BDNF is a potent neurotrophic factor, but
is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier [54]. Our
previous animal experiments demonstrated that bryo-
statin 1 is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier
and restoring water maze learning in aged rats and
transgenic mice used as models for many types of
neurodegenerative diseases [7, 48, 55, 56]. However,
other mechanisms of neuroprotection, such as a direct
effect of bryostatin-binding proteins on dendritic
spine architecture [57], anti-apoptosis, or interfer-
ence with amyloid-� toxicity through apolipoprotein
E, [58], endothelin convertase [59], or neprilysin [60]
may also be important.
These preliminary studies provide valuable guid-
ance for the design of larger clinical trials. Bryostatin
waswelltoleratedinADpatients.Althoughthisstudy
was insufficiently powered to draw any definitive
conclusions about efficacy, bryostatin appeared to
produce a short-duration improvement of the MMSE
psychometric scores. The long half-life of bryostatin
1 and high between-patient variability in the PKC
biomarker suggest that protocols may need to accom-
modate bryostatin elevation over long intervals of
dose administration.

The findings here of safety, favorable phar-
macokinetics, target engagement, initial cognitive
improvement with even a single dose in the Phase IIa
trial, and improvements of cognitive functions in the
Compassionate Use trials, collectively suggest that
bryostatin may be a promising candidate drug for the
treatment of AD.
