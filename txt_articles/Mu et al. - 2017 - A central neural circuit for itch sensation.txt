Although itch sensation is an important protective mechanism for animals, chronic itch
remains a challenging clinical problem. Itch processing has been studied extensively at the
spinal level. However, how itch information is transmitted to the brain and what central
circuits underlie the itch-induced scratching behavior remain largely unknown. We found
that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing and that
optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired itch-induced scratching behaviors.
Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are
disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection
neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus
suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. Thus, our studies reveal a central neural
circuit that is critical for itch signal processing.
I
tch sensation induces scratching behaviors,
which could cause serious tissue damage in
cases of chronic itch (1). Much progress has
been made in identifying itch-selective mole-
cules and neurons in the dorsal root ganglion
and spinal cord (2–6). However, we know much less
about the central circuit underlying itch process-
ing (7–10). The spinothalamic tract has been im-
plicated in itch processing (11, 12). In addition, the
spinoparabrachial pathway could also play im-
portant roles in various sensory processing, in-
cluding itch sensation (13–18). However, the
functional role of different ascending pathways
in itch sensation remains unknown.
The activity of parabrachial nucleus (PBN)–
projecting neurons in superficial dorsal spinal
cord of mice was significantly elevated by a pru-
ritic stimulus, as indicated by an increased expres-
sion of the immediate early gene c-Fos (Fig. 1, A to
D). To further examine the function of the spino-
parabrachial pathway in itch-induced scratching
behavior, we infused an adeno-associated virus
(AAV) carrying eNpHR3.0 or enhanced green flu-
orescent protein (EGFP) into the cervical dorsal
spinal cord of mice and implanted optic fibers to
the PBN bilaterally to selectively suppress the ac-
tivity of spinal axon projections in the PBN (Fig. 1E
and fig. S1, A to C and E to J). This significantly
decreased the scratching behavior induced by
both histamine and chloroquine (Fig. 1, F to H,
and fig. S1D), without affecting locomotive ac-
tivity (fig. S1, K to N).
Next, we investigated the connections between
the spinal itch-mediating neural network and the
PBN. Neurons expressing gastrin-releasing pep-
tide receptor (GRPR) in the spinal cord are es-
sential for itch signal transmission (19) and serve
as the downstream targets of other spinal itch-
signaling neurons (20, 21). We first examined the
possible direct projection of GRPR-expressing
(GRPR+) neurons to the PBN by using a knock-
in mouse line, with iCreERT2 inserted into the
Grpr locus (fig. S2A). Anterograde tracing by se-
lectively expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent
protein (EYFP) in spinal GRPR+ neurons resulted
in very few EYFP+ axons in the brain, including
the PBN (fig. S2, B to G), confirming that spinal
GRPR+ neurons are mostly local interneurons
(22). In view of the large number of spinal axons
projecting to the PBN (fig. S1J), we hypothe-
sized that spinal GRPR+ neurons make synapses
with PBN-projecting spinal neurons to transmit
itch signals to the PBN. Recording from retro-
gradely labeled PBN-projecting neurons in spi-
nal slices, we found that photostimulation of
spinal GRPR+ neurons and their axons induced
short-latency excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs) (7 of 14 cells recorded) (Fig. 1, I to L, and
fig. S2H), which were blocked by the AMPA re-
ceptor antagonist NBQX (2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-
tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide)
(Fig. 1, L and M). The latency of light-induced
EPSCs was 1.5 ± 0.2 ms with short jitter (fig. S2,
I and J), indicating a monosynaptic glutamatergic
connection between spinal GRPR+ neurons and
PBN-projecting neurons. Whole-cell recording
from PBN neurons in brain slices demonstrated
monosynaptic glutamatergic connections made
by spinal axon terminals (fig. S2, K to M).
We examined the involvement of PBN in itch
signal processing. The number of c-Fos+ neurons
in the PBN increased in response to histamine or
chloroquine (Fig. 2, A to C, and fig. S3). Next, we
measured the neural activities of PBN neurons
during itch-induced scratching behavior in freely
moving mice with fiber photometry by express-
ing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in the PBN
(Fig. 2D and fig. S4A) (23). Scratching behavior
was recorded by using a magnetic induction meth-
od (fig. S5, movie S1, and supplementary materials,
materials and methods). A cluster of scratching
bouts was defined as a scratching train (fig. S5B).
We aligned the calcium signal of PBN to the be-
ginning of individual scratching trains (Fig. 2E
and fig. S4B). The activity of PBN increased dur-
ing scratching behavior induced with either his-
tamine or chloroquine (Fig. 2, F and G, and fig.
S4C). Consistently, we found that optogenetic
activation of spinal GRPR+ neurons induced
elevated activity of PBN neurons (fig. S4, D to F).
These results are consistent with data obtained
with extracellular recording, which demonstra-
ted that a small percentage of recorded cells
showed scratching-related responses (17.3% for
chloroquine and 9.1% for histamine) (fig. S6).
To test the functional role of PBN in scratch-
ing behavior, we used a pharmacogenetic ap-
proach to suppress PBN activity. Bilateral PBN
injection was made in wild-type mice with an
AAV expressing hM4Di, a designer receptor ex-
clusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)
(24), or EGFP as control (Fig. 2H and fig. S7).
The efficacy of hM4Di-mediated inhibition was
confirmed with slice recordings (Fig. 2I and fig.
S8). Behaviorally, intraperitoneal injection of
an hM4Di agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), to
mice expressing hM4Di in the PBN significantly
suppressed the scratching behavior in response
to histamine or chloroquine (Fig. 2, J and K), as
well as bombesin (fig. S9A). By contrast, this
manipulation did not significantly affect motor
functions and behavioral responses to thermal
and mechanical stimuli nor induced overt dis-
tress (fig. S9, B to I).
Most c-Fos+ neurons in the PBN activated by
histamine were glutamatergic neurons (fig. S10,
A to C). Consistently, the activity of glutamatergic
neurons in the PBN increased during the scratch-
ing behavior (fig. S10, D to G). We thus further
examined the functional role of PBN glutamatergic
neurons in itch-induced scratching behavior
through genetic deletion of vesicular glutamate
transporter 2 (VGLUT2). Bilateral injection of
AAV-Cre-EGFP into the PBN of Vglut2 f/f mice
(25) led to a selective reduction of Vglut2 in the
PBN (Fig. 3, A to C, and fig. S11) and resulted in
blockade of synaptic output of PBN glutama-
tergic neurons (Fig. 3D and fig. S12). This ma-
nipulation significantly impaired the scratching
behavior in response to both histamine-dependent
and -independent pruritogens (Fig. 3, E and F,
and figs. S13 and S14A). It also significantly re-
duced the scratching behavior in the ovalbumin-
induced allergic itch model (Fig. 3G) as well as in
the 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB)–induced
chronic itch model (Fig. 3, H to J). The same ma-
nipulation did not cause any significant change in
body weight, motor activity, emotional responses,
or behavioral responses to thermal and mechan-
ical stimuli (fig. S14, B to M).

 The central circuit responsible for the itch-
induced scratching behavior has long been elu-
sive (10, 20). Our findings suggest that the PBN
represents a first central relay for itch sensation,
and its activity regulates both acute and chronic
itch–induced scratching. Spinal GRPR+ neurons
are required for itch sensation (19), but their cen-
tral target has been unknown. Here, we showed
that GRPR+ neurons could activate PBN neurons
via disynaptic excitatory connections. This spino-
parabrachial pathway plays an important role
in itch sensation, in addition to the contribution
of the spinothalamic tract (8, 26, 27) and poten-
tial GRPR+ neuron–independent pathways (2).
Our study also highlights the importance of brain
circuits in itch-induced scratching behavior in
rodents, even though similar behavior (such as
wiping) can be accomplished by spinal circuits

projection from spinal cord in primates (29, 30),
the spinoparabrachial pathway might also play
a critical role in itch processing of humans. Our
