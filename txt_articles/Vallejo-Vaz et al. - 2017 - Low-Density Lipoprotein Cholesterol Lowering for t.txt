BACKGROUND: Patients with primary elevations of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term exposure to markedly elevated 
LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these 
individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting 
these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide 
hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among 
a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.
METHODS: We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular 
outcomes among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL 
without preexisting vascular disease at baseline. We performed post hoc analyses 
from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial, and observational posttrial long-term follow-up, after 
excluding individuals with evidence of vascular disease at baseline. WOSCOPS 
enrolled 6595 men aged 45 to 64 years, who were randomly assigned to 
pravastatin 40 mg/d or placebo. In the present analyses, 5529 participants 
without evidence of vascular disease were included, stratified by LDL-C levels 
into those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (n=2969; mean LDL-C 178±6 mg/dL) and 
those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (n=2560; mean LDL-C 206±12 mg/dL). The effect 
of pravastatin versus placebo on coronary heart disease and major adverse 
cardiovascular events were assessed over the 4.9-year randomized controlled trial 
phase and on mortality outcomes over a total of 20 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 5529 individuals without vascular disease, pravastatin 
reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 27% (P=0.002) and major adverse 
cardiovascular events by 25% (P=0.004) consistently among those with and 
without LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (P-interaction >0.9). Among individuals with LDL-C 
≥190 mg/dL, pravastatin reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 27% 
(P=0.033) and major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% (P=0.037) during 
the initial trial phase and the risk of coronary heart disease death, cardiovascular 
death, and all-cause mortality by 28% (P=0.020), 25% (P=0.009), and 18% 
(P=0.004), respectively, over a total of 20 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The present analyses provide robust novel evidence for the 
short- and long-term benefits of lowering LDL-C for the primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 
mg/dL.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
P
atients with primary elevations of low-density li-
poprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL (to 
convert values for cholesterol to mmol/L, multi-
ply by 0.02586) are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) as a result of a long-
term exposure to markedly elevated LDL-C levels, even 
in the absence of preexisting ASCVD (ie, primary pre-
vention).1,2 This recently has been further supported 
by observations from the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk 
Pooling Project, where these individuals, who were 
even referred to as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) 
phenotype (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement), 
were observed to have an accelerated risk of coronary 
heart disease (CHD) and ASCVD in comparison with in-
dividuals with average levels of LDL-C.3 As such, the 
initiation of statin therapy (and, more recently, also 
of PCSK9 [proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 
9] inhibitors to further reduce LDL-C levels) is recom-
mended for individuals with primary elevations of LDL-
C ≥190 mg/dL without the need for risk assessment.1,2,4 
However, there is a lack of published randomized trial 
evidence supporting these recommendations in primary 
prevention with available evidence extrapolated from 
the Cholesterol Treatment Trialist meta-analyses (where 
lower LDL-C cutoff points were used and patients with 
established vascular disease were included in the high 
LDL-C category).5,6
Currently, it would be unethical to perform a place-
bo-controlled trial of LDL-C–lowering therapy among 
individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. Nonetheless, we 
can address this question using data from WOSCOPS 
(West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study), which 
aimed to assess the benefits of statin therapy among 
men with hypercholesterolemia and enrolled a signifi-
cant proportion of patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL 
(mean LDL-C 192 mg/dL).7,8 Although WOSCOPS ex-
cluded individuals with apparent myocardial infarction 
(MI), a proportion of participants still had evidence of 
other vascular diseases at baseline.
In the present analysis, we provide hitherto un-
published data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C 
lowering among a population with primary elevation 
of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL after restricting analyses to par-
ticipants without evidence of vascular disease at base-
line. Furthermore, clinical guidelines have differed on 
whether to recommend percentage reductions in LDL-
C or specific LDL-C levels among such patients.1,9,10 
To provide practical insights into desirable reductions 
in LDL-C among these individuals, we also conducted 
an observational analysis that assessed the relationship 
between reductions in LDL-C (in relative or absolute 
terms) and on-treatment LDL-C levels with subsequent 
clinical events.
METHODS
Randomized Trial
Details of the design of WOSCOPS have been described in 
detail elsewhere.7,8 In brief, WOSCOPS enrolled 6595 men 
aged 45 to 64 years (mean age 55 years) without evidence 
of prior MI and with a LDL-C ≥155 mg/dL not receiving lipid-
lowering therapy (mean LDL-C 192 mg/dL). Patients likely to 
have an elevated LDL-C attributable to secondary causes or 
with LDL-C >232 mg/dL on 2 fasting lipid measurements dur-
ing the screening phase were excluded (Methods and Figure I 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Subjects were then ran-
domly assigned (double-blind) to pravastatin 40 mg once daily 
or placebo. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 3.1–6.1).
To assess a purely primary prevention population, the pres-
ent analyses adopted more rigorous criteria than those used 
in the main WOSCOPS trial and, in addition, excluded those 
individuals with any evidence of vascular disease at baseline 
(n=1066) namely, evidence of angina, intermittent claudica-
tion, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and minor ECG abnor-
malities (classified by Minnesota code).7,8,11 Patients were then 
stratified by LDL-C levels at baseline into those with LDL-C 
<190 mg/dL and those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (Figure I and 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The present analysis from the WOSCOPS trial (West 
of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) reports 
for the first time new information on >2500 men 
with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease (a 
group lacking randomized trial evidence for statin 
therapy) and their subsequent risk of cardiovascu-
lar events.
• Individuals with a LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL have a 2-fold 
higher observed risk of major cardiovascular events 
than would be predicted from a risk calculator.
• We provide compelling novel evidence from a ran-
domized trial supporting the benefit of LDL-C low-
ering on cardiovascular events among a primary 
prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The present analysis provides novel supporting evi-
dence from a randomized trial to reinforce current 
recommendations of initiation of lipid-lowering 
therapy in the primary prevention of individuals 
with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL with-
out the need for risk estimation.
• Although these analyses are post hoc, this approach 
is the only one that currently allows us to address 
this question, because (1) nowadays it would be 
unethical to perform a placebo-controlled trial in 
the population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, and (2) 
there is no other randomized trial in primary pre-
vention with statins including such a significant 
proportion of patients with an LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.

Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). The following 
principal end points were considered for the present analy-
sis to maximize power (given the smaller sample size result-
ing from the stricter exclusion criteria and further restricting 
analysis to approximately half of the remaining individuals, ie, 
participants with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL): (1) the composite of 
definite or suspected nonfatal MI plus definite or suspected 
CHD death, hereinafter referred to as CHD (same coprincipal 
end point as the original WOSCOPS trial); (2) the composite of 
cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI (definite or suspected), and 
nonfatal stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). 
End point definitions including definite and suspected coro-
nary events are shown in the Methods in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Other outcomes explored include the principal 
end points but restricted to definite-only coronary events, 
MACE including coronary revascularization, mortality end 
points (CHD death, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mor-
tality), coronary revascularization, and cerebrovascular events 
(fatal/nonfatal stroke and transient ischemic attack).
Extended Observational Long-Term 
Follow-Up
After completion of the randomized trial phase, an extended 
observational follow-up of the WOSCOPS cohort is now 
ongoing, through linkage to national mortality and electronic 
hospital discharge records held by the National Health Service 
for Scotland.12,13 Further details are available in the Methods 
in the online-only Data Supplement, but, in brief, at 5 years 
after the initial trial finished approximately one-third of indi-
viduals originally allocated to pravastatin or placebo were on 
statins. In the present analysis, we compared long-term mor-
tality outcomes (including deaths from CHD, cardiovascular 
causes, and any cause) between those originally randomly 
assigned to pravastatin in comparison with placebo among 
individuals without evidence of vascular disease at baseline 
stratified by hypercholesterolemia status.
Ethics
The ethics committees from the University of Glasgow and 
participating health boards in Scotland approved the origi-
nal WOSCOPS trial. The corresponding committees from the 
Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Privacy Advisory Committee 
of the National Health Service for Scotland approved the 
extended follow-up study. The participants in each phase of 
WOSCOPS provided informed consent to partake in the trial 
and review of their medical records.
Statistical Analysis
Effect of Statin Therapy on Outcomes
The effect of therapy (pravastatin versus placebo) among 
those with and without LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL was calculated 
for both the initial trial period and the extended follow-up. 
Estimates of hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
with corresponding P values were obtained by means of a 
Cox proportional hazards model with randomized therapy as 
the only covariate. A test for interaction was performed to 
assess whether the effect of therapy was consistent across 
the LDL-C strata prespecified for this analysis. The P value 
obtained from the treatment by LDL-C subgroup interaction 
term was reported. Time-to-event curves were estimated by 
using the Kaplan-Meier method based on the original treat-
ment arm and LDL-C strata. Tests were 2-sided and statistical 
significance was defined as P<0.05.
Changes in LDL-C and Outcomes
To elucidate the extent to which the magnitude of LDL-C 
reduction from pravastatin therapy influenced outcomes 
among those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, observational analyses 
were performed. Therefore, we assessed changes in LDL-C 
levels and pravastatin effect during the randomized trial 
restricted to those subjects with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL at base-
line. The placebo group was taken as the reference category 
for the models. The relationship between absolute LDL-C 
fall (mean baseline level minus mean on-treatment value) or 
percentage LDL-C reduction and risk of events were assessed 
by using multivariable Cox regression models (Wald test) for 
the different groups (placebo and pravastatin subgroups), 
accounting for the following covariates: age, smoking, blood 
pressure, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and body 
mass index, as previously published.5,14 LDL-C reductions were 
modeled as categorical variables based on previous WOSCOPS 
and Cholesterol Treatment Trialist publications.5,6,14 For the 
assessment of the relative fall in LDL-C, >30% and <30% 
was used (consistent with the perceived average potency of 
pravastatin 40 mg/d: moderate-intensity statin therapy).1
On-Treatment LDL-C and Outcomes
The relationship between on-treatment LDL-C levels achieved 
with therapy on the risk of events was studied following 
analyses similar to those described above. Consistent with 
previous WOSCOPS analyses,14 on-treatment lipid levels were 
defined as the mean of all lipid values measured after ran-
domization until the patient had an event or reached the end 
of the trial. On-treatment LDL-C analyses excluded individuals 
with events in the first 6 months of the trial, because first 
on-treatment lipid measurements were at 6 months after 
randomization.
Participants With a Predicted 10-Year ASCVD Risk 
<7.5% and No Diabetes Mellitus
Finally, we performed additional analyses among partici-
pants without an indication of statin therapy based on global 
cardiovascular risk estimation and who were free from dia-
betes mellitus in whom LDL-C was ≥190 mg/dL (and for 
comparison <190 mg/dL), to specifically assess the impact 
of LDL-C–related cardiovascular risk. To assess global cardio-
vascular risk, we applied the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations15 
to the members of the WOSCOPS cohort who were free 
from ASCVD and diabetes mellitus, restricted to those with 
a predicted 10-year ASCVD risk <7.5%. To maximize power, 
we focused on MACE during the 5-year on-trial period and 
20-year extended follow-up.
The statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.2 
(SAS Institute Inc).

cular disease were included in the present analyses; of

these, 2560 individuals had LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (place-
bo n=1274; pravastatin n=1286). The baseline charac-
teristics, stratified by the presence or absence of LDL-C 
≥190 mg/dL, comparing pravastatin with placebo treat-
ment groups are shown in Table 1. Overall, patients had 
a mean age of 55 years, and there were no significant 
differences between placebo- and pravastatin-treated 
groups in any of the characteristics.
Lipid Levels
LDL-C levels at baseline, 1 year, and end of trial, and 
the percentage changes from baseline to year 1 and 
to end of trial, as well, are shown in Table 1. Mean 
(±SD) LDL-C at baseline was 206±12 mg/dL among 
patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, and 178±6 mg/dL 
among those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL. LDL-C levels at 
year 1 and end of trial were significantly lower among 
pravastatin-treated subjects in comparison with place-
bo across cohorts (P<0.001). The percentage reduction 
in LDL-C from baseline with pravastatin (accounting for 
the effect of placebo) among those with and without 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL was of a similar magnitude (≈23% 
at year 1 and 19.5%–20% at end of trial) (Figure II in 
the online-only Data Supplement). The effects on other 
lipids are shown in Table II in the online-only Data Sup-
plement.
Initial Trial Phase
The effect of pravastatin versus placebo on cardiovas-
cular outcomes over 4.9 years stratified by LDL-C <190 
or ≥190 mg/dL is shown in Figure 1, Table 2, and Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement. Overall, both 
CHD and MACE were reduced in the 5529 patients 
without vascular disease. Analyses stratified by LDL-C 
status showed no evidence of heterogeneity between 
cohorts for the principal end points or for the additional 
outcomes explored (interaction P values all >0.2) (in-
teraction results did not materially change when using 
LDL-C as a continuous measure rather than categorical 
[Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement]). The cor-

responding Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in Figures 2 
and 3 and Figures III through V in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Among individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL, pravastatin significantly reduced the risk of CHD by 
27% (P=0.033) with a 25% risk reduction in MACE 
(P=0.037).
Long-Term Follow-Up
The effect of initial randomization to pravastatin or 
placebo on mortality end points during a total of 20 
years of follow-up (from randomization to the end of 
extended follow-up) is shown in Figure 4 and Figures VI 
through VIII in the online-only Data Supplement. Over-
all, among all subjects initially allocated to pravastatin, 
CHD death, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortal-
ity were significantly reduced by 22%, 17%, and 12%, 
respectively (Table 2). Long-term risk of CHD death, car-
diovascular death, and all-cause mortality were signifi-
cantly reduced by 28%, 25%, and 18%, respectively, 
among those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL originally ran-
domly assigned to pravastatin. The absolute reduction 
in the risk of death at 20 years from CHD, cardiovas-
cular causes, and any cause was at least 2-fold greater 
among patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (absolute risk 
reduction 2.34%, 3.25%, and 5.39%, respectively) in

Change in LDL-C and Outcomes
Among individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, reduction 
in LDL-C of >30% or >39 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) was as-
sociated with a lower risk of CHD and MACE in com-
parison with placebo (Figure 5, Tables VI and VII in the 
online-only Data Supplement). In contrast, those indi-
viduals allocated to pravastatin whose LDL-C reduction 
was <30% or <39 mg/dL were not significantly differ-
ent from placebo. Consistent with earlier publications 
from WOSCOPS, we did not observe a continuous rela-
tionship between lower achieved LDL-C and outcomes 
(Figure 5, Tables VI through VIII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).

with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (Table 3). During the 5-year

DISCUSSION
Observational data support the assertion that having 
a LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL is associated with increased car-
diovascular risk, even in the absence of other risk fac-
tors.3 However, current guidelines recognize the pau-
city of evidence for primary prevention among these 
individuals and, specifically, the lack of evidence from 
randomized trials that include only patients with LDL-C 
≥190 mg/dL.1 Instead, indirect evidence derived from 
the extrapolation of other data is used to support this 
viewpoint.1 Indeed, the largest evidence base is derived 
from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialist meta-analyses, 
where a significant reduction in major coronary events 
and major vascular events per 39 mg/dL reduction in 
LDL-C with statins was observed across different cat-
egories of baseline LDL-C, including those with LDL-C 
≥135 mg/dL5 or with LDL-C >174 mg/dL,6 but these 
groups included patients with established vascular dis-
ease. Thus, although the primary prevention of cardio-

vascular disease in adults with primary elevations of 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL is identified as one of the groups 
where the benefit of statin therapy exceeds the risk of 
adverse events, the data currently available from ran-
domized clinical trials are still limited.1,2
The present analyses from the WOSCOPS study pro-
vide, for the first time, evidence from a randomized trial 
supporting the benefit of LDL-C reduction in the prima-
ry prevention of ASCVD in those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL. Specifically, we provide 3 lines of evidence for the 
benefit of LDL-C lowering with statins in these patients: 
(1) randomized trial evidence that LDL-C reduction by 
approximately one-quarter with statins reduces the risk 
of CHD by 27% and of MACE by 25%; (2) extended 
follow-up evidence that the early benefits extend to re-
ductions in CHD death by 28%, cardiovascular death by 
25%, and all-cause mortality by 18% over 20 years; the 
greater absolute benefit and smaller numbers needed-
to-treat in patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL likely reflect 
the higher lifetime cardiovascular risk because of the 
cumulative atherosclerotic burden in comparison with 
those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL; (3) observational data 
showing that reductions >30% or >39 mg/dL are asso-
ciated with lower risk of CHD and MACE in comparison 
with placebo. Another consideration of our results is 
that LDL-C does not appear to be an effect modifier of 
outcomes at either 5 years or at 20 years of follow-up 
(all interaction P values >0.18); in addition, there is not 
much difference in event rates based on the LDL-C cut-
off of 190 mg/dL during the initial 5-year trial period. 
While these data provide support for statin therapy for 
primary prevention in subjects with LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL, the data also provide support for the use of statin 
therapy for those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (lower limit 
for inclusion being 155 mg/dL).
To assess the importance of LDL-C to cardiovascu-
lar risk, we conducted an analysis among the primary-
prevention cohort in WOSCOPS who were free of dia-
betes mellitus at baseline and who, on the basis of the 
current Pooled Cohort Risk Equations, would be con-
sidered at low risk (ie, 10-year predicted risk <7.5%) 
and otherwise would be ineligible for statin therapy 
(approximately two-thirds). Among placebo-treated 
patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, the observed risk of 
MACE at 5 years was already 7.5%, ie, double what 
would have been predicted using a risk calculator. In 
comparison, among those with a LDL-C between 155 
and 190 mg/dL, the 5-year risk of MACE was 5.7% in 
the placebo group. These data reinforce the notion that 
among patients with a LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, the observed 
risk is much greater than would be predicted through 
a risk calculator, and, thus, global risk estimation is not 
necessary. During the 5-year randomized trial period, 
patients with a LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL but with a 10-year 
predicted risk <7.5% derived a statistically significant

We studied a primary prevention population with a 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, also defined by some guidelines as 
primary severe hypercholesterolemia.1 Some have also 
referred to patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL as FH phe-
notype3,4 (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
However, FH does not have a gold-standard definition, 
and its prevalence may ultimately depend on the LDL-C 
threshold and the presence of a pathogenic gene vari-
ant.4,16 Notwithstanding this, individuals with LDL-C 
≥190 mg/dL are more likely to have FH by clinical and

the MACE plus coronary revascularization end point was used here instead of MACE alone to increase the number of events in

pravastatin further stratified in different groups as shown in the table. Hazard ratios are adjusted for age, history of hyperten-
sion, history of diabetes mellitus, smoking status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. On-treatment 
LDL-C levels are defined as the mean of all LDL-C values measured after randomization until the patient had an event or 
reached the end of the study. On-treatment LDL-C analyses excluded individuals with events in the first 6 months of the trial, 
because first on-treatment LDL-C measurement was at 6 months after randomization. To convert values for cholesterol to

genetic criteria (Table I in the online-only Data Supple-
ment).9,17–19 However, according to a recent study, only 
a small proportion of people with severe hypercholes-
terolemia in the community have an identifiable FH mu-
tation.16 In the present study, we lacked genetic data 
and indeed relevant clinical information to help define 
FH in the WOSCOPS population according to accepted 
diagnostic criteria9; however, the number of individuals 
who fulfil the strict clinical or genetic criteria for FH in 
the present analyses is likely to have been small, be-
cause WOSCOPS excluded patients with LDL-C >232 
mg/dL or with prior MI.7 Hence, a number of patients 
with more severe manifestations of FH (in terms of 
higher LDL-C levels or coronary disease at an earlier 
age) might have been excluded. Nevertheless, our re-
sults are applicable to the broader FH population, based 
on (1) that there was no heterogeneity in treatment ef-
fect between patients with and without LDL-C ≥190 
mg/dL; (2) our observation that individuals with primary 
elevation of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL and likely greater life-
time burden from elevated LDL-C derive significant risk 
reductions from LDL-C lowering; and (3) a number of 
observational studies that suggest the benefit of statins 
for FH patients.20–23
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high-
intensity statin therapy for individuals with LDL-C ≥190 
mg/dL,1 and, although the present analyses provide di-
rect evidence for the benefits for an ≈23% reduction 
in LDL-C (ie, a low-intensity statin regimen), there are 
no trials presently capable of providing similar evidence 
for the benefit of even greater percentage reductions 
or higher intensity statin therapy in this population. 
Although the current paradigm is that lower on-treat-
ment LDL-C levels and greater reductions in LDL-C are 
associated with a lower risk of ASCVD,24–26 we did not 
find evidence for a continuous relationship between on-
treatment LDL-C and better outcomes, which is consis-
tent with earlier analyses from the overall WOSCOPS 
cohort.14 To what degree this reflects studies of pravas-
tatin and its relevance to more contemporary statin use 
is uncertain. Because the inclusion criterion was an LDL-
C of 155 to 232 mg/dL and the average LDL-C reduc-
tion at 1 year was ≈ 23%, we did not have the data 
to validate or refute the current recommendation for a 
LDL-C target of 100 mg/dL in some guidelines.9,10
When LDL-C reductions in the pravastatin group 
were analyzed as a binary trait, the present analyses 
suggested that those individuals who derived >30% 
reduction or >39 mg/dL absolute lowering in LDL-C ap-
peared to derive significant benefit in comparison with 
placebo. It should be recognized, however, that there 
was considerable overlap in the observed benefits be-
tween this group and those achieving lesser reductions 
on pravastatin. We also need to acknowledge that a 
fair number of people in the lower-effect group never 
took the treatment or withdrew from treatment. We 
know that 9% of the original WOSCOPS cohort never 
took the treatment and ≈30% were off treatment by 5 
years (no significant difference in the withdrawal rates 
between pravastatin and placebo arms).8 Many of these 
people attended the annual visits and had their lipids 
assessed because they saw the study doctor and had 
ECGs recorded. Hence, we cannot say that any trends 
to differences seen are differences in statin response.
The high baseline LDL-C and the limited potency of 
pravastatin 40 mg/d limit the extent of the analyses that 
can be performed in WOSCOPS. Direct evidence for the 
benefit of even greater reductions in LDL-C among pa-
tients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL in primary prevention 
may be inferred indirectly from the recently reported 
SPIRE-2 trial (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Re-
duction of Vascular Events),27–29 evaluating the effica-
cy of PCSK9 inhibition with bococizumab in reducing 
the risk of major cardiovascular events in subjects with 
LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin 
therapy. With a mean baseline LDL-C level of 134 mg/
dL, and assuming a 50% reduction in LDL-C from in-
tensive statin therapy, suggests that many participants 
in the SPIRE-2 trial likely started with untreated LDL-C 
levels ≥190 mg/dL. Therapy with bococizumab led to a 
reduction in LDL-C levels of ≈55% and 40% at 14 and 
52 weeks, respectively.29 Although the trial was pre-
maturely stopped because of the development of high 
rates of antidrug antibodies and attenuation of the 
cholesterol-lowering effect over time, a significant 21% 
risk reduction of cardiovascular events was observed in 
those treated with bococizumab (in comparison with 
placebo) after a median follow-up of 12 months, with 
no significant differences in analyses stratified by the 
presence or absence of clinical evidence of cardiovascu-
lar disease.29 It is noteworthy that the National Lipid As-
sociation has recently recommended that therapy with 
PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered to further reduce 
LDL-C in patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.4
A major strength of the present analysis is that it ex-
plores a group of higher-risk individuals (LDL-C ≥190 
mg/dL) specifically highlighted in guidelines, but one 
in which clinical trial evidence is lacking.1 Thus, the 
present results from a randomized trial provide novel 
information and evidence to support guideline recom-
mendations. In addition, because high lipid levels like 
those included in WOSCOPS (LDL-C ≥155 mg/dL) may 
be present in a significant proportion of the population, 
the results of the present study may impact the care of 
a significant number of patients; for instance, recent 
surveys from the United States have estimated a preva-
lence of 16% to 33% for LDL-C ≥155 to 160 mg/dL and 
of 5.6% to 10.4% for LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (depending 
on the characteristics of the population scrutinized) in 
the adult population.30,31 That said, some aspects of the 
present analyses warrant further discussion. This is an

analysis of a subgroup of the overall WOSCOPS cohort 
that was not prespecified and, although the findings 
are consistent with the original trial publications,8,12–14 
the present findings remain post hoc. The lack of sta-
tistically significant reductions in additional end points 
in the group with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (Figure 1) may re-
flect a limited power resulting from restricting the origi-
nal sample size. In addition, it should be noted that the 
LDL-C levels in those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL were still 
high (mean LDL-C at baseline 178 mg/dL overall; at year 
1, 177 and 135 mg/dL in placebo and pravastatin arms, 
respectively) and not markedly different than in those 
with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (mean LDL-C at baseline 206 
mg/dL overall; at year 1, 199 and 157 mg/dL in placebo 
and pravastatin arms, respectively); as such, the differ-
ence in absolute risk reduction between these groups 
may not have been as wide as could be observed in 
current populations where mean LDL-C levels (in those 
with LDL-C <190 mg/dL) are significantly lower.
The extended long-term follow-up reports data 
among individuals enrolled in the original trial and, 
although the comparisons provided are for the origi-
nal randomized groups, it should be recognized that 
the data from the additional 15 years of follow-up 
after the original trial was completed are observation-
al and might be confounded by the lack of ongoing 
information regarding medication use. For instance, 
those participants with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL may have 
been more likely to be kept on treatment than those 
with lower LDL-C levels after the completion of the 
trial. Nevertheless, it provides valuable information on 
what a period of treatment may confer in terms of 
long-term risk reduction benefit (legacy effect or reset 
of the atherosclerotic event clock based on the original 
trial). Nevertheless, without excluding the possibility 
of confounding factors, it is not possible to fully char-
acterize the long-term follow-up estimates as either 
underestimates or overestimates, because it cannot 
be assumed that the outcomes are only modulated by 
statin use or nonuse. Notwithstanding this, we con-
sider that the former is more likely because (1) many 
actively treated patients during the trial phase may 
have no longer received statin therapy, and (2) the 
expected increased crossover in the original placebo 
arm to statin therapy during follow-up; as such, the 
results of the extended follow-up may likely underes-
timate the benefits of longer-term therapy because of 
the reduced differential statin use over time, and so 
it is likely that the benefit for those ≥190 mg/dL may 
be larger than that implied by the trial (especially if 
one were to use a statin regimen of greater potency 
than that used in WOSCOPS). On the other hand, the 
high prevalence of smokers in the WOSCOPS popu-
lation might mean that a similar study today might 
not show as strong an effect with a statin regimen of 
similar potency.
Regarding the exploratory analyses evaluating the 
effect of LDL-C change on treatment versus outcome 
(in comparison with placebo), the influence of noncom-
pliance to medication cannot be ruled out completely. 
That said, to be included in the analysis, men had to at-
tend to have their blood sample taken; many noncom-
pliers did not do so (which is why the achieved LDL-C 
rose slightly over time). Thus, there is some allowance 
for noncompliance in the analysis as performed. Finally, 
the analyses of reductions in LDL-C on pravastatin and 
outcomes are observational in nature and should be 
interpreted as such, because residual confounding can-
not be excluded despite statistical adjustment.
CONCLUSION
Among men with primary elevations of LDL-C levels 
≥190 mg/dL, primary prevention with pravastatin re-
duced the risk of cardiovascular events. Thus, the pres-
ent analyses from a randomized clinical trial provide, 
for the first time, evidence for the benefits of LDL-C 
lowering for the primary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease among individuals with primary elevations of 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, which may help reinforce current 
recommendations for this group of patients.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The present analyses were conceived by Drs Ray and Vallejo-
Vaz. Drs Robertson and Ford performed the statistical analy-
ses. Drs Packard and Ford conducted the original WOSCOPS 
trial and extended follow-up. Drs Ray and Vallejo-Vaz wrote 
the draft of the present article. All authors critically reviewed 
the manuscript and approved its submission. Drs Ford and 
Robertson had full access to all the data in the study and take 
responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy 
of the data analysis. Funding organizations had no influence 
on the design and conduct of the study; collection, manage-
ment, analyses, and interpretation of the data; preparation,

diology, Rome, Italy, August 27 to 31, 2016.
Trial Registration: The original WOSCOSP trial was con-
ducted between 1988 and 1995 and so it preceded the 
formal trial registration era. Nevertheless, the protocol and 
statistical analysis plan related to the original WOSCOPS trial 
was pertinently published by The West of Scotland Coronary 
Prevention Study Group.7
