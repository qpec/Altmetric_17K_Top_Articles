Abstract
Background: Semen quality, a predictor of male fertility, has been suggested declining worldwide. Among other
life style factors, male coffee/caffeine consumption was hypothesized to influence semen parameters, but also
sperm DNA integrity. To summarize available evidence, we performed a systematic review of observational studies
on the relation between coffee/caffeine intake and parameters of male fertility including sperm ploidy, sperm DNA
integrity, semen quality and time to pregnancy.
Methods: A systematic literature search was performed up to November 2016 (MEDLINE and EMBASE). We
included all observational papers that reported the relation between male coffee/caffeine intake and reproductive
outcomes: 1. semen parameters, 2. sperm DNA characteristics, 3. fecundability. All pertinent reports were retrieved
and the relative reference lists were systematically searched in order to identify any potential additional studies
that could be included.
Results: We retrieved 28 papers reporting observational information on coffee/caffeine intake and reproductive
outcomes. Overall, they included 19,967 men. 1. Semen parameters did not seem affected by caffeine intake, at
least caffeine from coffee, tea and cocoa drinks, in most studies. Conversely, other contributions suggested a
negative effect of cola-containing beverages and caffeine-containing soft drinks on semen volume, count and
concentration. 2. As regards sperm DNA defects, caffeine intake seemed associated with aneuploidy and DNA
breaks, but not with other markers of DNA damage. 3. Finally, male coffee drinking was associated to prolonged
time to pregnancy in some, but not all, studies.
Conclusions: The literature suggests that caffeine intake, possibly through sperm DNA damage, may negatively
affect male reproductive function. Evidence from epidemiological studies on semen parameters and fertility is
however inconsistent and inconclusive. Well-designed studies with predefined criteria for semen analysis, subject
selection, and life style habits definition, are essential to reach a consistent evidence on the effect of caffeine on
semen parameters and male fertility.

 Introduction
Approximately 13% of the general reproductive age popu-
lation is challenged with fertility problems, and male fac-
tors seem to contribute for up to 30% of them [1]. Semen
quality, a predictor of male fertility, has been suggested
declining worldwide [2–4]. Many factors have been pro-
posed as causes of this decline, including life style habits
and trends toward high-protein western–style diets. Thus,
given the supposed impact of smoking [5], alcohol con-
sumption [6], weight [7], physical activity [8, 9] and diet
[10] on spermatogenesis, the relation between semen
parameters and life style has become a topic of interest.
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is found in coffee,
tea, soft drinks (particularly cola-containing beverages
and energy drinks) and chocolate. It easily crosses bio-
logic membranes, is rapidly distributed throughout the
body and has been found in saliva, breast milk, the em-
bryo and the neonate [11]. The caffeine molecule is easily
absorbed by humans, having approximately 100% of bio-
availability when taken by oral route and reaching a peak
in the blood within 15–45 min after its consumption [12].
Caffeine has a number of biologic effects, including cen-
tral nervous system stimulation, increased secretion of
catecholamine, relaxation of smooth muscles and stimula-
tion of heart rate. It is known to have both positive and
negative effects on health. Whereas a moderate intake
may confer a modest protective effect against some car-
diovascular system diseases and on the metabolism of car-
bohydrates and lipids (including the various forms of
arterial cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia, heart insuffi-
ciency, diabetes, liver disease [13] and even Parkinson’s
disease [14]), excessive amounts may lead to deleterious
health effects [12]. Of particular concern is the increasing
consumption of energy drinks, that are rich in caffeine
and very popular among young people [15].
Male coffee/caffeine consumption has been associated
with high levels of testosterone and sex hormone bind-
ing globulin (SHBG) [16]. It has been hypothesized that
caffeine alters Sertoli Cells glycolytic and oxidative pro-
file, interfering with male’s reproductive potential [17].
However, the mechanism behind the possible harmful
effect of caffeine is not well clarified. In both fetal and
adult life, caffeine may act indirectly by impacting the
hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal-system or by a direct
toxic effect on the germinative epithelium [17, 18].
Moreover, coffee consumption has been hypothesized
to influence not only semen parameters, but also sperm
DNA integrity. This aspect is of potential relevance,
considering that human sperm DNA damage can also
be determined by testicular or post-testicular injury in-
cluding oxidative stress [19]. Available evidence indi-
cates that semen samples containing a percentage of
DNA fragmented cells above a critical threshold have a
reduced level of pregnancy success [20, 21].
Therefore, to summarize the currently available infor-
mation, we conducted a systematic review of epidemio-
logical data from observational studies on the relation
between coffee/caffeine intake and parameters of male
fertility including semen quality, sperm ploidy, sperm
DNA integrity, and time to pregnancy.
Methods
The electronic databases MEDLINE (1966 to 2016) and
EMBASE (1985 to 2016) were searched for “coffee” or
“caffeine” or “cola” and “semen quality” or “sperm quality”
or “semen parameters” or “sperm parameters” or “fe-
cundability” or “male infertility” or “male fertility”. The
search included English and Human as limits.
Data were extracted independently by two investigators.
If multiple published reports from the same study were
available, only the one with the most detailed information
was included. Review articles were considered only if they
also reported original data. We included all observational
papers that reported the relation between male coffee/caf-
feine intake and reproductive outcomes: semen parameters,
sperm DNA characteristics, fecundability. We did not ex-
clude abstracts at congresses. All pertinent reports were re-
trieved and the relative reference lists were systematically
reviewed in order to identify any other relevant studies.
General limits of reviewed papers
Some methodological considerations should be under-
lined before presenting the results of this review. The
identified studies are markedly different in quality of in-
formation, study design and categorization of caffeine
exposure. We collected information on study design,
characteristics of men enrolled in the studies, estimates
of coffee/caffeine consumption and confounding factors
accounted for in the analysis. These aspects should be
considered in interpreting the results.
Results
Overall, we found 259 papers in MEDLINE and 261 in
EMBASE (Fig. 1). The overlap was of 180 articles. Thus,
340 titles were reviewed. In this phase, 52 were excluded
because reports of animal studies. Reviewing the ab-
stracts, we excluded 98 laboratory studies, 39 reviews,
64 contributions just reporting data on women’s caffeine
intake, 29 on other issues (contraception, urinary symp-
toms, editorials, correspondence about articles). Overall,
58 articles were candidates to be fully reviewed. Of
them, 7 did not report data of interest; 4 were abstracts
presented at congresses, subsequently published as full
articles; 2 were reviews; 2 reported data only on women’s
caffeine intake; 3 reported information about the same
sample; 10 used caffeine intake as potential confounder
but did not report the results; 2 were interventional
studies. Twenty-eight articles were selected: 22 full-text

 [22–43] and 6 abstracts [44–49], that did not report de-
tailed information on the method of exposure ascertain-
ment. As such, they were included in the Tables but not
commented in the Results. Overall, information on 19,967
men was reported. The main characteristics of the 28
ultimately selected papers are presented in Table 1.
Study design
Sperm variables were mainly evaluated within a cross-
sectional design [22, 23, 26, 27, 32, 33, 37–39, 41, 45, 46].
The remaining studies were a case-control [44] and a pro-
spective cohort [31]. One study evaluating sperm nuclear
morphometric parameters [28] was cross-sectional.
All studies on DNA integrity [29, 35, 40, 42] had a
cross-sectional design.
Rates of spontaneous fecundability were investigated
by means of retrospective cohorts [27, 34] and prospective
cohorts [25, 30, 43]. Success rates of assisted reproduction
techniques (ART) were also studied using prospective co-
hort design [31, 47, 48]. Two case-control studies [24, 36]
were also selected: men with dyspermia were compared to
normospermic controls in the first study [24] and men
with infertility were compared to men of known fertility
in the second one [36].
Data collection
Information on coffee and caffeine consumption was
collected by different methods in various studies (Table 2).
Frequently the caffeine intake was investigated as fre-
quency of coffee consumption (cups/day). Some studies
also collected information on tea and cola-containing bev-
erage intake, as equivalent of 0.5 (tea) or 0.25 (cola) cups
of coffee [28, 29, 35], while others recorded detailed infor-
mation on various sources of caffeine and estimated the
overall consumption [25, 27, 30, 31, 37, 38, 43]. Some au-
thors were also able to analyze separately different sources
of caffeine [27, 38, 41].
Caffeine and semen variables
Semen variables were considered in several papers, but
not all of them specifically reported the relation with
caffeine exposure [26, 31].

nor for DNA fragmentation and chromatin decondensation. In a
multivariate model including age, results were confirmed for volume (p <

 In a cross-sectional analysis, Figà-Talamanca et al.
[26] studied a group of 201 taxi drivers, exploring the
possible association between professional exposure and
reproductive health. No consistent relation between
coffee consumption and sperm count or motility was
found. For sperm morphology, a high prevalence of
atypical forms was found among men drinking 1-3
cups of coffee/day, but not among those drinking more
than three.
In a prospective cohort study, Klonoff-Cohen et al.
[31] collected information on timing and amount of
caffeine intake by men and women undergoing in vitro
fertilization, reporting the caffeine intake during their
lifetime, 1 year prior the attempt, during the week of
the initial clinical visit and during the week of IVF pro-
cedure. The association of male and female intake of
beverages (coffee, tea, cola) and chocolates and multiple
end points (including oocyte retrieval, sperm parame-
ters, fertilization rate, multiple gestations, miscarriage
rate, and live births) was evaluated. Accounting for po-
tential confounders (Table 2), no relation was found be-
tween male caffeine intake and sperm count, motility
or morphology.
Volume
As shown in Table 3, no study found a significant relation
between coffee/caffeine intake and semen volume. Al-
though some studies suggested that men with the highest
coffee consumption had lower semen volume as com-
pared with those with less or no consumption [22, 37–39],
this result was not statistically significant nor consistent
throughout the studies. In the study by Yang et al. [41], it
was even the opposite. In this regard, the only statistically
significant result was found among cola consumers in-
cluded in the study, as the higher the weekly cola intake,
the lower was the volume [41]. A similar trend was ob-
served by Jensen et al. [38], although their result was not
statistically significant.
Count
No relation was observed between coffee/caffeine con-
sumption and total sperm count. The lack of effect was
probably true, as no dose-response gradient was present.
On the contrary, in two studies [38, 41] cola intake was
found consistently associated with lower sperm count.
Concentration
Results regarding sperm concentration were similar to
those on total count; no significant difference was found
in relation to coffee intake. The only exception was rep-
resented by the study of Marshburn et al. [22], that ob-
served that in men with the highest intake (4 or more
cups of coffee per day), the concentration was higher as
compared to men who did not drink coffee at all, but
was lower as compared to men drinking 1-3 cups of
coffee per day.
Consistently with the findings reported for volume
and total count, Jensen et al. [38] reported a significantly
lower concentration in men with higher cola consumption.
On the contrary, men observed by Yang et al. [41] had both
lower volume and counts as cola intake increased, but no
consistent trend emerged as regard to concentration.
Motility
Motility was reported as total or progressive motility
(Table 3). Most studies did not report any significant dif-
ference throughout the categories of coffee/caffeine con-
sumption, whereas two [33, 41] observed an increasing
percentage of motile sperm in men with the highest intake.
The same result was found by Yang et al. [41] in men
drinking cola beverages, but this finding did not emerge
in the study from Jensen et al. [38].
Morphology
Morphology was reported as percentage of normal [33, 37,
38, 41] or abnormal [22, 23] forms. Only Marshburn et al.
[22] reported a significantly higher proportion of abnormal
forms in men drinking 4 or more cups of coffee per day
(31% versus 28% in other categories of intake). In line, a
lower percentage of normal forms was found in high-
quantity cola drinkers [38, 41]. This difference resulted sta-
tistically significant in the study by Jensen et al. [38].
Vine et al. [28] found no consistent evidence for associa-
tions between the means, standard deviations, or skew-
nesses of any of sperm nuclear morphometric parameters
(size, shape, stain and texture) and caffeine intake.
Caffeine and DNA damage
Jurewicz et al. [40] and Robbins et al. [29] focused
specifically on the relation between life style and
sperm aneuploidy.

Male caffeine intake was negatively associated with clinical pregnancy per
initiated cycle. Compared to men consuming <88 mg/day of caffeine,
adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for clinical pregnancy per initiated cycle were
1.4 (0.5-3.8), 1.7 (0.6-4.8), and 0.4 (0.1-1.0) for men consuming 88-168 mg/

 In particular, Robbins et al. [29] investigated caffeine ef-
fects on sperm aneuploidy within the context of potential
confounding or interaction effects of alcohol and smoking.
Caffeine intake, measured as coffee cup equivalents per
day, demonstrated a significant linear association with in-
creasing chromosomal abnormalities (XX18, XY18, YY18-
18, XY18-18), after adjusting for the continuous variables
alcohol, age and urine cotinine (as a marker of smoking).
Jurewicz et al. [40] also studied aneuploidy and diploidy
in a group of healthy men. The average frequencies of an-
euploidy for the specific chromosomes studied in this
group were: XX 0.02%, YY 0.01%, XY 0.10% and 18-18
0.04%. The authors found a positive relationship between
everyday coffee drinking and the lack of chromosome X
or Y (p = 0.013), as well as coffee drinking 1–6 times per
week and additional chromosome 18 (p = 0.026). This
association persisted after accounting for factors known
or suspected to affect aneuploidy (age, alcohol intake
and cigarette smoking).
Besides aneuploidy, DNA integrity represents an ex-
tremely important parameter indicative of male infertil-
ity and of potential outcome of ART. A recent paper by
Radwan et al. [42] failed to find evidence of a relation
between DNA fragmentation evaluated by sperm chro-
matin structure assay and coffee drinking, in 286 healthy
men. Coffee drinking was not related to any of the ex-
amined parameters of sperm DNA damage and DNA
stainability, including the percentages of DNA fragmen-
tation index (DFI), the medium DNA fragmentation
index (M DFI), the high DNA fragmentation index (H
DFI) and the high DNA stainability index (HDS—per-
centage of immature sperms).
Schmid et al. [35] also investigated the association be-
tween coffee and DNA damage in 80 healthy non-
smokers, by sperm Comet analyses, and concluded that,
independently of age (older men have increased sperm
DNA damage), men with substantial daily caffeine con-
sumption have increased sperm DNA damage associated
with double-strand DNA breaks.
In line, Horak et al. [32] investigated the accumulation
of DNA adducts as a biomarker of exposure to chemical
mutagens. A DNA adduct represents a segment of DNA
bound to a cancer-causing chemical substance. DNA
repair mechanisms induced by several chemicals and ra-
diation occur early during spermatogenesis, but not in
mature spermatids and spermatozoa [50], raising the
possibility of accumulation of non-repaired DNA dam-
age during spermiogenesis. The association among DNA
adducts, fertility and life style habits has been addressed,
and a significant negative correlation between presence
of DNA adducts and sperm concentration or motility
was found among patients with an impaired fertility.
However, no correlation between coffee consumption
and sperm DNA adducts could be detected.
In this regard, it should be considered that controver-
sies among studies might be related to the various
methods of DNA damage evaluation. Sperm DNA frag-
mentation tests generally show moderate correlation to
each other [51]. None of them provide specific informa-
tion on the nature and severity of the DNA damage, and
it is still unclear which of these tests is preferable to
optimize clinical decision-making.
Caffeine and risk of dyspermia
Two case-control studies [24, 36] compared coffee in-
take between men with impaired fertility and fertile con-
trols. Parazzini et al. [24] investigated cases of men with
unexplained dyspermia, comparing them with two con-
trol groups, from the same clinic where cases were se-
lected: men of infertile couples with negative work-up
for any disease affecting fertility, and fertile men of un-
known semen quality, that were partners of women who
gave birth (at term) to healthy infant. In this study, dys-
permia was defined as low concentration (between 5 and
10*106 sperm/mL), progressive motility <30%, <30%
typical forms, leukocytes <1*106/mL, and no sperm ag-
glutination. Dyspermia risk increased with the number
of coffee cups drank per day (reference category 0-1
cup): the relation was significant if cases were compared
to fertile men (multivariate odds ratio (OR) 1.3 for 2-3,
4.2 for ≥4 cups, chi-square for trend p < 0.001), as well
as

In the study published by Kobeissi et al. [36], cases
suffered from oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, tera-
tozoospermia or azoospermia; controls were the fertile
husbands of infertile women. Mean daily coffee con-
sumption was slightly, but not significantly, higher in
cases than in controls, and in the multivariate analysis,
including several potential confounding variables, the
OR for coffee intake per day (by 1 additional cup of cof-
fee) was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.14).
Caffeine and time to planned pregnancy
In five cohort studies the endpoint was time to planned
pregnancy [25, 27, 30, 34, 43].
In a prospective cohort including women working in
nonmedical function at 39 Dutch hospitals and their
partners, Florack et al. [25] analyzed the relation be-
tween caffeine intake (from coffee, tea and cola) and fe-
cundability. Men with low or moderate caffeine intake
did not differ, but those with a high level were more
likely to experience a reduction in fecundability. Including
all the relevant potential confounders, men who drank 4-7
caffeine drinks per day had an OR of 0.8 (95% CI 0.5-1.5)
and those who drank 8 or more an OR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-
0.97), as compared to <3 caffeine drinks per day.
Curtis et al. [27] analyzed data from the Ontario Farm
Family Health Study (retrospective cohort), to evaluate if
smoking, alcohol and caffeine intake affected fecundability
ratio (FR), defined as the fecundability for the exposed
group divided by that of the unexposed group. Only
planned pregnancies were selected for this analysis, thus
considering 2607 pregnancies among 1277 couples.
Sources of caffeine were considered coffee, tea and cola
containing beverages. Among men, a slight decrease in
fecundability was found when caffeine drinkers were
compared with complete abstainers; however, because
96% of the respondents reported some caffeine con-
sumption, low (<100 mg caffeine per day) versus high
(>100 mg caffeine per day) consumption was also exam-
ined; no association with fecundability was observed
using this cut-point. There was no dose-response gradi-
ent for caffeine consumption, nor were there interac-
tions between women's and men's caffeine consumption
or between caffeine consumption and cigarette smoking.
Thus, the study failed to find any relation between over-
all caffeine consumption and fecundability. Consump-
tion of each of the three beverages was also analyzed.
For male coffee, tea and cola drinkers, there was no
overall association with fecundability. However, consum-
ing more than three cups of tea per day was associated
with decreased fecundability (FR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-
1.05), suggesting that the effect, if true, was due to con-
stituents other than caffeine.
In Denmark, Jensen et al. [30] recruited 430 couples
without previous reproductive experience, who intended
to discontinue contraception in order to become preg-
nant. Couples were enrolled among union trade mem-
bers, who were 20–35 years old, lived with a partner,
and had no children. Analyzing intake in strata of smoking
habits, the authors found no adverse effect of caffeine
among male smokers. However, among nonsmokers, caf-
feine intake > 700 mg per day was associated with a FR =
0.47 (95% CI 0.26–0.82) among males, compared with
nonsmokers with 0-299 mg caffeine daily intake. No sta-
tistically significant association between fecundability and
intake of any specific source of caffeine was observed, but
a similar tendency was found for each source as well as
for overall caffeine intake.
The objective of Cole et al. [34] was to retrospectively
investigate the effects of maternal and paternal measures
of persistent toxic substances on time to pregnancy
among 41 couples from a general population, where the
woman was at first trimester of pregnancy, taking into
account other known factors affecting fecundability (the
probability per month of becoming pregnant). The crude
fecundability OR for paternal caffeine consumption was
0.49 (95% CI 0.20-1.20) for intake >52 drink/month (me-
dian intake) and for couple consumption was 0.73 (95%
CI 0.30-1.74). In the multivariate model including all sig-
nificant variables, couple, but not male, caffeine con-
sumption above median, as compared to below median,
remained significantly associated (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-
0.63) to prolonged time to pregnancy.
Wesselink et al. [43] studied the association between
female and male preconception caffeine intake and fe-
cundability in a North American prospective cohort study
of 2135 pregnancy planners. In this study, male caffeinated
soda intake showed an inverse dose-response relation with
fecundability (1 and ≥2 vs. 0 cans/day: FR 0.77, 95% CI
0.56-1.05 and FR 0.72, 95% CI = 0.46–1.11, respectively).
Male energy drink intake was also associated with reduced
fecundability (≥1 vs. 0 cans/day: FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21-
0.98), whereas caffeinated coffee, black tea, and green tea
were not. Decaffeinated coffee (>0 vs. 0 cups/day: FR 0.73,
95% CI 0.46-1.17) and herbal/decaffeinated tea (≥1 vs.0
cups/day: FR 0.64, 95% CI 0.32-1.31) were associated
with slightly decreased fecundability, whereas decaffein-
ated soda was not (>0 vs. 0 cans/day: FR 0.90, 95% CI
0.70-1.16).
Caffeine and ART
A prospective cohort study by Klonoff-Cohen et al. [31]
investigated the rate of successful ART among coffee
drinkers. Even if detailed results were not reported, the
authors stated that male caffeine consumption had no
effect on fertilization, pregnancy or live birth delivery.
On the contrary, when caffeine was analyzed as a
Ricci et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:37 
Page 10 of 14
 continuous variable, it represented a risk factor for
multiple gestations. An increase of male caffeine intake
by an additional 100 mg/day significantly increased the
risk of multiple gestations by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.1-4.4)
for usual consumption during lifetime; and by 3.0 times
(95% CI 1.2-7.4) for intake during the week of initial
clinic visit.
Discussion
This systematic review focused on the relation between
coffee/caffeine intake and male infertility using three
main outcomes: semen variables, sperm DNA damage
and time to pregnancy. In most studies, semen parame-
ters did not seem affected by caffeine intake, at least
caffeine from coffee, tea and cocoa drinks. Conversely,
some studies suggested a negative effect of cola-
containing
beverages
and
caffeine-containing
soft
drinks on volume, count and concentration. As regards
sperm DNA defects, caffeine intake seemed associated
with aneuploidy and DNA breaks, but not with other
markers of DNA damage. Finally, coffee drinking was
associated to prolonged time to pregnancy in some, but
not all, studies.
The extreme heterogeneity in exposure measurement,
study design, and studied outcomes currently hampers
the possibility to draw a definite figure on the relation
between coffee/caffeine intake and male infertility. Meta-
analyses, in particular, cannot be drawn.
Caffeine exposure has been assessed asking the usual
daily or weekly intake of coffee alone [22–24, 26, 32–34,
36, 39–42], or of different sources of caffeine, such as
tea, cola beverages [25, 27–29, 35, 37]; cocoa drink and
chocolate bar intakes were also collected [30, 31, 38], as
well as white tea, black tea, and decaffeinated coffee in a
study [43]. It has been suggested that using coffee intake
as a surrogate measure for caffeine exposure may se-
verely underestimate its intake. Although coffee is the
main source of caffeine, assessment of coffee alone is
likely to underrate caffeine intake and, subsequently, its
role as a risk factor. On the other hand, measurement
of coffee, tea, and cola soft drink seemed to sufficiently
approximate caffeine intake [52].
Studies on time to pregnancy had a cohort design,
retrospective in two [27, 34] and prospective in three
cases [25, 30, 43]. Both approaches are prone to bias:
retrospective cohorts have a major limitation in the tim-
ing of assessment of caffeine intake, relative to the time
of trying to become pregnant and thus subject to recall
bias. However, since caffeine consumption is a behavior
that often fluctuates over time, the information collected
at enrolment in a prospective cohort might be outdated
at the time of outcome assessment.
Case-control studies are also subjected to recall bias,
as well as to selection bias. Careful choice of controls
and information on confounding factors are usually in-
cluded in good quality studies as those here presented
[24, 36], but underlying confounders not accounted for
may exist. Studies on the relation between coffee/caffeine
and semen parameters [22, 23, 26, 28, 29, 33, 37–39, 41]
or DNA damage [29, 32, 35, 40, 42] had a cross-sectional
design, that shares the same risks of biases of case-
control studies.
Then, results may be conditioned by some con-
founders that were not systematically and properly taken
into account. This limitation may explain the significant
associations observed in some but not all studies. Note-
worthy is the recent emerging role of stress and diet in
male infertility [53–55]. Coffee and caffeinated beverage
consumption may actually be associated with peculiar
diet patterns or life style habits, and it is difficult to dis-
entangle spurious from potentially causal associations.
For instance, the association found between semen vari-
ables and caffeine-containing soft drinks, but not with
caffeine intake, may suggest a confounding effect. In
other words, soft drinks rather than caffeine may be det-
rimental. The associations found for high quantity cola
drinkers could not be attributed to the caffeine content
in cola, which was not high; a less healthy life style
among these men may explain the finding. In fact, some
caffeinated beverages could affect fertility through mecha-
nisms that do not involve caffeine. Cola-containing bever-
age intake, for instance, could cause subfertility through
increased risk of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome
and weight gain [56–58]. Accordingly, male soda intake
in general (and thus not only cola) has been shown to
deleteriously affect sperm characteristics [59].
As regards study quality, in most published articles the
relation between caffeine intake and reproductive out-
comes was accounted for potential or well established
confounding factors, as intercourse frequency, smoking,
reproductive organs diseases, alcohol intake, age and
BMI. However, the effect of residual unmeasured con-
founders cannot be excluded.
Finally, with regard to the analysis of time to preg-
nancy or successful ART rate, a neglected but potentially
crucial aspect is the potential confounding effect of
women’s fertility. Data from studies on spontaneous or
ART-mediated infertility are actually exposed to the risk
of women-related confounders, because the partners of
a couple share at least in part the life style. If a pattern is
detrimental to women but not to men fertility, one may
found a spurious association in men.
In this complex methodological scenario, biological
plausibility plays a critical role to speculate on potential
causal relation, requiring some discussion.
Aneuploidy is an abnormality in the chromosome
number and is the most prevalent type of genetic abnor-
mality and a major type of chromosome aberration in
Ricci et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:37 
Page 11 of 14
 humans. Meiosis that occurs continuously in men is a
crucial and delicate event. In fact, different environmen-
tal and life style factors may interfere with the normal
disjunction of sister chromatids/chromosomes during
meiosis, thus resulting in aneuploidy. As many as 20% of
human conceptions are believed aneuploid, but only 1/
300 births, suggesting that aneuploidy plays a major role
in pregnancy loss. A substantial proportion of aneu-
ploidy occurring in embryos and newborns is of paternal
origin [60]. In this regard, the evidence emerging from
our review, that mainly supports an association between
caffeine intake and sperm aneuploidy and DNA damage,
deserves particular consideration. Noteworthy, the incon-
sistencies among available evidence are not surprising and
may be explained by methodological issues. In fact, a
burning debate currently exists on the use of sperm DNA
damage tests in the infertility work-up of men, because of
poor reproducibility [19, 20]. The availability of numerous
assays to measure sperm DNA damage and the lack of
well-designed
comparative
diagnostic
studies
have
hampered, up to now, standardization and the full
understanding of the clinical implications of sperm
DNA damage [20].
On the other hand, most published results failed to
find an association between semen variables and caffeine
intake, at least caffeine from coffee, tea and coca drinks.
Spermatogenesis is a complex process that is also very
sensible to external agents. Semen quality constitutes a
health benchmark and an important instrument for
epidemiological studies of environmental impact [61].
However, well-defined criteria of what constitutes a de-
velopment suitable model for the research process in
studies of semen quality have been only recently devel-
oped [62]. Therefore, as there have been no specific
standards for the appraisal of studies concerning semen
quality until recently, biased results deriving from the
older studies, in which quality controls were completely
lacking, may have lead to erroneous conclusions poten-
tially contributing to the heterogeneity observed. A
stringent use of semen analysis criteria has been
strongly advocated for future studies in order to over-
come inconsistencies [63].
Conclusions
The published evidence suggests that caffeine intake,
possibly though sperm DNA damage, may negatively
affect male reproductive function. Evidence from epi-
demiological studies on semen parameters and male
fertility
is
however
inconsistent
and
inconclusive.
Well-designed studies, with predefined criteria for
semen analyses and for subject selection, as well as de-
fining life style habits, are essential to reach a strong
evidence on the effect of caffeine on semen parameters
and male fertility.
