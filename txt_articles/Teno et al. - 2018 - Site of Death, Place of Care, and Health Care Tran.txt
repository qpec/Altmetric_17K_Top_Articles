IMPORTANCE End-of-life care costs are high and decedents often experience
poor quality of care. Numerous factors influence changes in site of death, health care
transitions, and burdensome patterns of care.
OBJECTIVE To describe changes in site of death and patterns of care among
Medicare decedents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study among a 20%
random sample of 1 361 870 decedents who had Medicare fee-for-service (2000, 2005,
2009, 2011, and 2015) and a 100% sample of 871 845 decedents who had Medicare
Advantage (2011 and 2015) and received care at an acute care hospital, at home
or in the community, at a hospice inpatient care unit, or at a nursing home.
EXPOSURES Secular changes between 2000 and 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Medicare administrative data were used to
determine site of death, place of care, health care transitions, which are changes
in location of care, and burdensome patterns of care. Burdensome patterns of
care were based on health care transitions during the last 3 days of life and multiple
hospitalizations for infections or dehydration during the last 120 days of life.
RESULTS The site of death and patterns of care were studied among 1 361 870 decedents
who had Medicare fee-for-service (mean [SD] age, 82.8 [8.4] years; 58.7% female)
and 871 845 decedents who had Medicare Advantage (mean [SD] age, 82.1 [8.5] years;
54.0% female). Among Medicare fee-for-service decedents, the proportion of deaths
that occurred in an acute care hospital decreased from 32.6% (95% CI, 32.4%-32.8%)
in 2000 to 19.8% (95% CI, 19.6%-20.0%) in 2015, and deaths in a home or community
setting that included assisted living facilities increased from 30.7% (95% CI, 30.6%-30.9%)
in 2000 to 40.1% (95% CI, 39.9%-30.3% ) in 2015. Use of the intensive care unit during the
last 30 days of life among Medicare fee-for-service decedents increased from 24.3% (95% CI,
24.1%-24.4%) in 2000 and then stabilized between 2009 and 2015 at 29.0% (95% CI,
28.8%-29.2%). Among Medicare fee-for-service decedents, health care transitions
during the last 3 days of life increased from 10.3% (95% CI, 10.1%-10.4%) in 2000 to
a high of 14.2% (95% CI, 14.0%-14.3%) in 2009 and then decreased to 10.8% (95% CI,
10.6%-10.9%) in 2015. The number of decedents enrolled in Medicare Advantage during
the last 90 days of life increased from 358 600 in 2011 to 513 245 in 2015. Among
decedents with Medicare Advantage, similar patterns in the rates for site of death,
place of care, and health care transitions were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who died
in 2015 compared with 2000, there was a lower likelihood of dying in an acute care
hospital, an increase and then stabilization of intensive care unit use during the
last month of life, and an increase and then decline in health care transitions during
the last 3 days of life.

mportant quality concerns have been noted with the medi-
cal care of seriously ill patients, especially during the last
weeks of life.1-3 Research has found poor palliation of
symptoms,4 burdensome health care transitions during the
last days of life,1 reports of unmet patient needs,4 concerns
with the quality of care,5 and declines in the ratings for pa-
tient care quality.
An important concern in US health care policy involves the
high cost of health care and the adequacy of care quality pro-
vided to seriously ill “high-need, high-cost” patients; in the
United States, 5% of persons account for 60% of health care
expenditures.6,7 Death is usually preceded by prolonged ill-
ness, and about 80% of individuals are considered high-
need, high-cost patients prior to death.
Previous research involving decedents between 2000 and
2009 with Medicare fee-for-service found that even though
the proportion of individuals who died in an acute care hos-
pital decreased from 32.6% to 24.6%, intensive care unit (ICU)
useduringthelastmonthoflifeincreasedfrom24.3%to29.2%
and health care transitions during the last 3 days of life in-
creased from 10.3% to 14.2%.1 These changes in care use oc-
curred despite secular changes in the US health care system
such as the expansion of hospice services,8 inpatient pallia-
tive care teams,9 and increases in staffing of hospitals with
hospitalists.10
Since 2009, policies and programs ranging from ensur-
ing informed patient decision making to enhanced care coor-
dination have had the goal of improving care at the end of life.
Specific interventions have included promoting conversa-
tions about the goals of care, continued growth of hospice ser-
vices and palliative care, and the debate and passage of the Af-
fordable Care Act. It is unknown whether these continued
efforts and new policy changes implemented under the Af-
fordable Care Act have affected medical care at the end of life.
Methods
Data and Study Population
ThisstudyusedMedicareenrollmentandclaimsdataandnurs-
ing home assessment data from the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) Minimum Data Set that are covered
under the terms of CMS data use agreement RSCH-2015-
28232.TheinstitutionalreviewboardsatBrownUniversityand
Oregon Health & Science University reviewed the study and
waived informed consent.
A 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service ben-
eficiaries who died in 2000, 2005, 2009, 2011, and 2015 was
created based on the Medicare Beneficiary Eligibility and En-
rollment file to match the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a
previous study.1 The Medicare fee-for-service cohorts in-
cluded persons aged 66 years or older with fee-for-service Part
A and Part B coverage during the last year of life. Because of
the increasing growth of Medicare Advantage, a sensitivity
analysis was done comparing Medicare Advantage with Medi-
care fee-for-service in 2011 and 2015.
All of the Medicare Advantage decedents had insurance
coverage during the last 90 days of life. Medicare Advantage
decedents were included because hospitals began submit-
ting encounter records for all Medicare beneficiaries starting
in 2008, including those with Medicare Advantage, which al-
lowed the CMS to calculate disproportionate share payments
and indirect and direct medical education adjustment.11 These
claims were present with the exception of beneficiaries dis-
charged from hospitals that were not required to submit this
information. These included critical access hospitals and those
hospitals that care only for patients with Medicare Advan-
tage. A recent study found that these hospitals accounted for
92% of Medicare discharges between 2011 and 2013.12
This study focused on changes in patterns among Medi-
care fee-for-service decedents. In addition, the differences be-
tween Medicare Advantage and Medicare fee-for-service de-
cedentswerepresentedasasensitivityanalysis.However,there
are no published estimates of the accuracy of these informa-
tional claims.
Outcomes
The Residential History File algorithm was used to define the
outcomes.13 The Residential History File tracks beneficiaries
by place and time using the dates of service on Medicare claims
andMinimumDataSetassessments,andthedateofdeathfrom
the Medicare enrollment file. Based on the Residential His-
tory File, a health care transition was defined as a change in
the place of care.
Siteofdeathwasdefinedforthefollowingcategories:home
or community, assisted living facility coupled with home hos-
pice, acute care hospital, nursing home, and hospice inpa-
tient care unit. With the exception of persons who died while
receiving hospice services, the use of the term home or com-
munity refers to noninstitutional settings and includes per-
sons dying in assisted living facilities, personal care homes,
and private homes. Only those who died while receiving hos-
pice services can be characterized as dying in an assisted liv-
ing facility.
In addition, several patterns of care use during the last 90
days of life were examined, including hospice services re-
ceived by the time of death, hospice services received during
Key Points
Question What was the pattern for site of death, place of care,
and health care transitions and burdensome care that occurred
between 2000 and 2015 for Medicare beneficiaries?
Findings In a retrospective cohort study of a 20% sample of the
Medicare fee-for-service population that included 1 361 870
decedents, the site of care changed between 2000 and 2015 from
acute care hospitals to the community. The proportion of deaths
that occurred in acute care hospitals decreased to 19.8%, intensive
care unit use during the last 30 days of life increased and then
stabilized at approximately 29%, and health care transitions
during the last 3 days of life decreased after 2009.
Meaning Among Medicare beneficiaries who died between 2000
and 2015, there was a decrease in the rates of death that occurred
in the hospital, with an increase and then stabilization of the rates
of intensive care unit use, and an increase and then decline in
health care transitions during the last 3 days of life.

 the last 3 days of life, days of general inpatient hospice care
during the last 30 days of life, continuous hospice care during
the last 30 days of life, hospitalizations during the last 30 and
90 days of life, ICU use during the last 30 days of life, and nurs-
ing home use during the last 90 days of life. For all of these
patterns of care use, the denominator is all deaths.
General inpatient hospice care is meant for short-term
management of pain or other symptoms provided in an inpa-
tient setting (ie, in a free-standing hospice inpatient unit, an
acute care hospital, or a nursing home). Continuous home care
provides similar hospice services but these services are pro-
vided in a home or in a nursing home that does not have skilled
nursing facility beds. Because hospice services for Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries are carved out and billed separately,
hospice use is characterized for both Medicare Advantage and
Medicare fee-for-service decedents.
To better understand the increase in the proportion of
deaths that occurred in the home or community setting, the
location of deaths in 2009, 2011, and 2015 was examined for
those patients receiving hospice services that the Residential
History File algorithm classified as in the home or in the com-
munity. The codes for place of service captured whether the
patients who received hospice services died in an assisted liv-
ing facility.
Potentially burdensome transitions were defined as tran-
sitions during the last 3 days of life; 3 or more hospitaliza-
tions during the last 90 days of life; or 2 or more hospitaliza-
tions for pneumonia, urinary tract infection, dehydration, or
sepsis during the last 120 days of life. Prolonged mechanical
ventilation (≥4 days) during a terminal hospitalization was de-
fined as a type of potentially burdensome care.
Race/ethnicity was based on self-report to the Social Se-
curity Administration and was included for the purpose of in-
terpreting the change in site of death and patterns of care. Sev-
eral studies reported that black patients prefer more aggressive
patternsofcarethanwhitepatients.14-16Otherstudieshavesug-
gested that Hispanic persons are more likely than white per-
sons to die at home or in a relative’
s home.17,18
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics with 95% CIs characterized the site of
death, places of care, health care transitions between hospi-
tal and nursing home, and burdensome patterns of transi-
tions during the last months of life. For each outcome, 95% CIs
were calculated. The comparisons between years were inter-
preted as different if their 95% CIs did not overlap. A descrip-
tive analysis characterized Medicare Advantage and Medi-
care fee-for-service decedents. All analyses were performed
using Stata version 15 (StataCorp).
Results
The sociodemographic characteristics of 1 361 870 decedents
with Medicare fee-for-service (mean [SD] age, 82.8 [8.4] years;
58.7% female) and 871 845 decedents with Medicare Advan-
tage (mean [SD] age, 82.1 [8.5] years; 54.0% female) appear in

 The proportion of Medicare Advantage decedents in-
creased from 22.6% (95% CI, 22.5%-22.7%; n = 358 600 of
1 586 081) in 2011 to 29.9% (95% CI, 29.9%-30.0%; n = 513 245
of 1 714 058) in 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, mean age and
sex were similar in individuals enrolled in Medicare fee-for-
service and Medicare Advantage. Black individuals were less
likely to be enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service between 2011
and 2015, whereas enrollment in Medicare Advantage in-
creased slightly among black individuals from 9.9% (95% CI,
9.8%-10.0%) to 10.6% (95% CI, 10.5%-10.7%).
Change in Site of Death and Places of Care
From 2000 to 2015, the proportion of deaths that occurred in
acute care hospitals and nursing homes continued to de-
crease (Figure and Table 2). Among Medicare fee-for-service
decedents, there was a steady decrease in deaths in acute care
hospitals from 32.6% (95% CI, 32.4%-32.8%) in 2000 to 19.8%
(95%CI,19.6%-20.0%)in2015.Nursinghomesasasiteofdeath

27.3%) in 2000 to 24.9% (95% CI, 24.8%-25.1%) in 2015; how-
ever, nursing homes remained the site of death for 24.9% of
Medicare fee-for-service decedents in 2015.
The previously reported pattern of persons dying while re-
ceivinghospiceservicescontinued,increasingfrom21.6%(95%
CI, 21.5%-21.8%) in 2000 to 50.4% (95% CI, 50.2%-50.6%) in

curred in freestanding hospice inpatient units and in the home
or community setting. Of these late hospice referrals, 40.3%
(95% CI, 39.7%-40.8%) were preceded by hospitalization with
an ICU stay. In 2015, among those with a late hospice referral,
42.9% were in an ICU (95% CI, 41.2%-43.6%).
Among those persons who received hospice services and
were classified as dying in the home or in the community set-
ting in 2015, 18.4% (95% CI, 18.1%-18.6%) of Medicare fee-for-
service patients were living in an assisted living facility at the
time of death. Among Medicare fee-for-service decedents, ICU

dentsduringthelast30daysoflifestabilizedbetween2009and
2015 at 29.0% (95% CI, 28.8%-29.2%). Hospitalizations during
the last 90 days of life increased until 2009 then decreased by
2.8 percentage points from 69.3% (95% CI, 69.2%-69.6%) in
2009 to 65.2% (95% CI, 65.1%-65.5%) in 2015. Nursing home

Health Care Transitions and Potentially Burdensome Care
Health care transitions between a nursing home and hospital
increased from 2000 to 2009, then decreased from a mean
of 0.58 transitions (interquartile range, 0-1.0) per Medicare
fee-for-service decedent in 2009 to 0.33 transitions (inter-
quartile range, 0-0) per decedent in 2015. A similar pattern
was seen among Medicare fee-for-service decedents during
the last 3 days of life; health care transitions increased from
10.3% (95% CI, 10.1%-10.4%) in 2000 to 14.2% (95% CI,
14.0%-14.3%) in 2009 and then decreased to 10.8% (95% CI,
10.6%-10.9%) in 2015. Multiple hospitalizations (≥3) during
the last 90 days of life declined from 11.5% (95% CI, 11.4%-
11.6%) in 2009 to 7.1% (95% CI, 7.0%-7.2%) in 2015. Spending

Site of death reported as an assisted living facility can only be reported when
the service code captured that site of care. The denominators are reported in
Table 2 with exception of the analyses of assisted living facilities. Data on
assisted living facilities were only available for 2009, 2011, and 2015.
The denominators for Medicare fee-for-service assisted living facilities
includes persons who died while receiving hospice services and were
as follows: n = 120 750 for 2009; n = 121 706 for 2011; and n = 126 510 for 2015.
The denominators for Medicare Advantage assisted living facilities includes
persons who died while receiving hospice services and were as follows:
n = 186 810 for 2011 and n = 273 705 for 2015. Categories are not mutually
exclusive because patients in the assisted living facility category may also be
represented in the home or community category.

 4 or more days receiving mechanical ventilation during ter-
minal hospitalization decreased slightly (Table 2).
Patterns of Care Among Medicare Advantage
vs Medicare Fee-for-Service in 2011 and 2015
The Figure and the last 4 columns of Table 2 contrast Medi-
carefee-for-serviceandMedicareAdvantagedecedentsin2011
and 2015. The likelihood of death in an acute care hospital was
similar among Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advan-
tage decedents in 2015. However, Medicare Advantage dece-
dents were less likely to die in a nursing home and more likely
to die at home or in a community setting.
More Medicare Advantage decedents (ie, difference of
2.2%) received hospice services in 2015. Medicare Advantage
decedents were less likely to be hospitalized and there were
differences in the rates of hospitalizations during the last 30
and 90 days of life. For the last 30 days of life, the difference
in the hospitalization rates was 9.3%.
Discussion
Comparing Medicare fee-for-service decedents from 2000 to
2015,therewasalowerlikelihoodofdeathinanacutecarehos-
pital, the rate of ICU use during the last month of life in-
creased from 2000 to 2009 and then stabilized from 2009 to
2015, and rates of health care transitions and burdensome care
increased from 2000 to 2009 and then declined from 2009
to 2015. This study also reports on the end-of-life experience
of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage,
which is important given the continued growth of this pro-
gram. A similar pattern of decrease in deaths in an acute care
hospital was observed, but Medicare Advantage decedents
were less likely to be hospitalized, less likely to die in a nurs-
ing home, and more likely to die in the community.
These results are consistent with a prior study of the
Healthcare Effectiveness and Data Information Set.19 It is dif-
ficult to attribute the observed changes to any single interven-
tion or policy designed to improve care at the end of life. Be-
ginning prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010,
there has been a reduction in potentially burdensome health
care transitions and terminal hospitalizations, but little change
in ICU use during the last 30 days of life.
Between 2009 and 2015, a reduction in health care tran-
sitions occurred. Based on previous research linking fami-
lies’perceptions of the quality of decedents’care, transitions
between health care institutions during the last 3 days of life,
andmultiplehospitalizationsforinfectionsordehydrationdur-
ing the last 120 days of life were considered potentially bur-
densome. Health care transitions during the last 3 days of life,
even when patients are to receive hospice services,20 are as-
sociated with lower ratings of the quality of care among per-
sons with advanced cancer.
An analysis of the National Health and Aging Trends study
found that individuals aged 65 years or older who experi-
enced health care transitions during the last 3 days of life were
associated with higher levels of concerns about the quality of
care, more unmet needs, and lower ratings regarding the qual-
ity of care.20,21 Experiencing multiple hospitalizations for in-
fections such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septice-
mia, or dehydration was associated with a median survival of
less than 6 months among nursing home residents with ad-
vanced dementia.22 Both of these types of transitions de-
clined between 2009 and 2015.
Use of ICU services during the last 30 days of life in-
creased from 2000 to 2009, but remained unchanged at ap-
proximately 29.0% from 2009 to in 2015. The National Acad-
emy of Medicine’
s 2015 report on dying in America2 defined a
good death as “One that is free from avoidable distress and suf-
fering for patients, families, and caregivers; in general accord
with patients’and families’wishes; and reasonably consis-
tent with clinical, cultural, and ethical standards.
” Death in the
ICU is seldom viewed as a good death.
Important concerns have been expressed about the use of
ICU services at the end of life; the types of concerns include
inadequatecommunication,23poorlytreatedsymptoms,24psy-
chological outcomes of next of kin,25,26 and bereaved family
members’concerns that the medical care provided was not
consistent with the decedent’
s preferences.27 Even though in-
dividuals may differ in their preferences regarding location of
death, the ongoing trend toward stabilization of ICU use is an
important marker of improvement.
Multiple efforts between 2000 and 2015 attempted to im-
prove care at the close of life. It is difficult to disentangle ef-
forts such as public education, promotion of advance direc-
tives through the Patient Self-Determination Act, increased
access to hospice and palliative care services, financial incen-
tives of payment policies, and other secular changes. As re-
ported in Table 2, potentially burdensome health care transi-
tions decreased between 2009 and 2011. In 2009, the CMS
started publicly reporting 30-day hospital readmission rates
in February and debate of the Affordable Care Act by Con-
gress started in March.
During the early 1990s, the Study to Understand Progno-
ses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments3
implemented a multifaceted intervention that failed to im-
prove care of seriously ill patients. A potential reason for this
failure is the need for multifaceted interventions that addi-
tionally address economic incentives that contribute to care
fragmentation and overuse.28 The public reporting of 30-day
hospital readmission rates and payment penalties for risk-
adjusted readmission rates potentially provide an opportu-
nity to improve more timely access to and effectiveness of pal-
liative care and hospice services.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the finding that the
proportion of deaths that occurred in the community in-
creased among Medicare fee-for-service decedents should be
interpreted with caution. This research relied on Medicare bill-
ing data and Minimum Data Set assessments to determine the
site of death based on the place of service recorded on the sub-
mitted claims. Medicare billing data do not differentiate com-
munity deaths that are in a personal home, in an assisted liv-
ing facility, or at foster care home except for decedents who
died while receiving hospice services.

 However, with the finding that 50.4% of Medicare fee-
for-service decedents died while receiving hospice services
in 2015, it is likely that some of this shift is based on persons
dying in assisted living facilities. Compared with dying at
home, the research on the quality of dying in an assisted liv-
ing facility found improvement in dyspnea but with a higher
rate of pain.29 Research is needed to examine whether death
in an assisted living facility is similar to the experience of
death in a nursing home or in a private home while receiving
hospice services.
Second, this study was restricted to Medicare beneficia-
ries so the findings may not generalize to other populations.
Third, information on patient preferences was not present in
administrative data; therefore, this study was unable to de-
termine whether reported outcomes are consistent with a pa-
tient’
s informed choice.
Fourth, although this study addressed a limitation of the
2000-2009 study1 by including the inpatient billing data from
Medicare Advantage patients that is used by the CMS in the
determination of disproportionate share and medical educa-
tionadjustmentsforhospitals,theseclaimsdatawerenotavail-
ableforasmallpercentageofhospitals(hospitalsthatonlypro-
vide care for Medicare Advantage patients and critical access
hospitals).
Fifth, there are no published estimates of the accuracy of
these informational claims. Sixth, an analysis was not pos-
sible for outcomes by income or cause of death because these
data were not available in the administrative data.
Conclusions
AmongMedicarefee-for-servicebeneficiarieswhodiedin2015
compared with 2000, there was a lower likelihood of dying in
an acute care hospital, an increase and then stabilization of in-
tensive care unit use during the last month of life, and an in-
crease and then decline in health care transitions during the
last 3 days of life.
