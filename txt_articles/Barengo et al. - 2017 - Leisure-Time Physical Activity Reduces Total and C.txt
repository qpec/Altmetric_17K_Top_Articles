OBJECTIVES: To determine whether leisure-time physical
activity (LTPA) is independently associated with all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality and with incidence of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) and stroke in older adults.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study (median follow-
up 11.8 years).
SETTING: Community, five Finnish provinces.
PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 65 to 74 who
participated in a baseline risk factor survey between 1997
and 2007 in Finland (N = 2,456).
MEASUREMENTS: The study protocol included a self-
administered
questionnaire,
health
examination at
the
study site, and blood sample for laboratory analysis. LTPA
was classified into three levels: low, moderate, high. Mor-
tality data were obtained from the National Causes of
Death Register and data on incident CVD (coronary heart
disease, stroke) events from the National Hospital Dis-
charge Register.
RESULTS: Multifactorial-adjusted (age, area, study year,
sex, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure,
serum cholesterol, education, marital status) risks of total
mortality (moderate: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) = 0.50–0.74; high: HR = 0.47, 95%
CI = 0.34–0.63, P for trend <.001), CVD mortality (mod-
erate: HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.33–0.64; high: HR = 0.34,
95% CI = 0.20–0.59, P for trend <.001), and an incident
CVD event (moderate HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.54–0.88;
high: HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38–0.79, P for trend <.001)
were lower for those with moderate or high LTPA levels
than for those with low LTPA levels. Further adjustment
for self-reported inability to perform LTPA did not change
the associations remarkably.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline LTPA reduces the risk of total
and CVD mortality and incident CVD events in older
adults
independently
of
the
major
known
CVD
risk
factors. The protective effect of LTPA is dose dependent.

ccording to the World Health Organization, non-com-
municable diseases were responsible for more than
two-thirds (38 million) of the world’s 56 million deaths in
2012.1 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) alone caused more
than 17 million deaths. Worldwide, physical inactivity is
estimated to cause approximately 3.2 million deaths annu-
ally.1,2 Previous studies have revealed that regular leisure-
time physical activity (LTPA) decreases all-cause and CVD
mortality in middle-aged men and women.3–9 Less evi-
dence of the effects of LTPA on all-cause and CVD mor-
tality is available in older adult populations,10–21 and the
available studies in older adults have provided insight into
the effect of LTPA on total mortality alone11–15,17,20–23,
whereas evidence of the associations between LTPA and
CVD mortality or morbidity is scant.10,11,16,20,21 More-
over, some of the studies assessed only certain domains of
LTPA such as walking10,12,16 or non-LTPA18 or were con-
ducted in a special population group such as older non-
smoking adults.12 In addition, the vast majority of studies
were conducted in men, and evidence of the effects of
LTPA on all-cause or CVD mortality in older women is
sparse.11,13–15,17,18,20
The aim of this study was to investigate whether base-
line LTPA is associated with all-cause and CVD mortality

 and CVD and stroke incidence independently of the
known major CVD risk factors (smoking, body mass index
(BMI), systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol) and social
background factors (education, marital status) in individu-
als aged 65 to 75 living in Finland. It was hypothesized
that baseline LTPA would be associated with lower all-
cause and CVD mortality, CVD, and stroke independent
of known major CVD risk factors and socioeconomic fac-
tors in older adults in Finland.
METHODS
Study Participants
The National FINRISK Study has been conducted every
5 years since 1972 to monitor cardiovascular and other
noncommunicable disease risk factors and other health-
related factors in the Finnish adult population.24 An inde-
pendent random sample was drawn from the national
population register for each survey. The samples were
stratified according to sex and 10-year age categories
according to the World Health Organization Multina-
tional Monitoring of trends and determinants of CVD
protocol.25 The current study cohort consisted of partici-
pants aged 65 to 74 sampled in 1997, 2002, and 2007 in
five study areas (provinces of North Karelia and North
Savo in eastern Finland, Turku-Loimaa area in southwest-
ern Finland, cities of Helsinki and Vantaa in southern
Finland, Oulu province in northern Finland). The total
sample consisted of 5,000 men and women aged 65 to
74, 3,353 (67%) of whom participated in the baseline
study. Of these, 471 were excluded from the prospective
analysis
because
of
an
acute
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD) or stroke event before the baseline survey, preva-
lent heart failure, or cancer and 426 because they were
missing one or more variables needed for the analysis,
leaving 2,456 (1,331 men, 1,125 women) in the cohort
follow-up.
Baseline Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk Factors
A self-administered questionnaire mailed to participants
in advance included questions on smoking habits, educa-
tion, LTPA, and other health-related and socioeconomic
factors. A detailed description of the questions about
physical activity is presented elsewhere.26–28 The ques-
tionnaire used for the assessment of physical activity has
been successfully used previously and been found to have
a
high
correlation
with
physical
fitness
as
measured
according
to
maximal
oxygen
uptake.5,29–31
Smoking
habits were classified in three categories: never smoker,
ex-smoker, current smoker. Education level, measured as
total number of school years, was divided into birth
cohort–specific thirds. At the study site, specially trained
nurses checked that the questionnaire was fully completed
and measured height, weight, and blood pressure using a
standardized protocol.25 Height and weight were mea-
sured in light clothing without shoes, and BMI was calcu-
lated (kg/m2). Blood pressure was measured twice using a
mercury sphygmomanometer (three times in 2002–2007)
in the right arm of the participant in a seated position
after at least 5 minutes of rest. The mean of the first and
second systolic blood pressure measurements was used in
the analysis. After clinical measurements, a venous blood
specimen was taken for laboratory analysis. Serum total
cholesterol
level
was
analyzed
using
an
enzymatic
method. All laboratory analyses were conducted in the
same central laboratory of the National Institute for
Health and Welfare.
LTPA was determined using a self-administered ques-
tionnaire. The time frame of the activity questionnaire was
a typical week. LTPA was classified as high (participation
in recreational sports (e.g., running, jogging, skiing, calis-
thenics, swimming, ball games, heavy gardening) or intense
training or sports competitions for ≥3 h/wk), moderate
(walking, cycling, other light exercise (fishing, gardening,
hunting) ≥4 h/wk, or low (reading, watching television,
working in the housed without much physical activity).
Outcome Definition
The study cohort was followed until the end of 2013.
Mortality data were obtained from the National Causes
of Death Register and data on incident stroke events
from the National Hospital Discharge Register covering
all hospital in Finland. Median follow-up was 11.8 years.
Endpoints were defined according to International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding;
there were 591 deaths, 197 CVD deaths (ICD-10: I20-
I25, R98, I61, I63, not I636, I64), 416 first incident
CVD events (I20-I25, I61, I63, not I636, I64), and 226
first incident stroke events (I61, I63, not I636, I64) dur-
ing follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Win-
dows version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Cox pro-
portional
hazards
models
were
used
to
estimate
associations between LTPA and risk of the above-men-
tioned endpoints during follow-up. Four models were
applied for each endpoint (Model A: adjusted for age,
study area and study year; Model B: Model A plus BMI,
total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking; Model
C: Model B plus education and marital status; Model D:
Model C plus self-reported inability to practice physical
activity). All analyses were performed separately for men
and women and for both sexes combined (and adjusted
also for sex). LTPA was treated as an ordinal variable in
the model, and the statistical significance of the different
LTPA levels was tested in the same models, with the low
LTPA as the reference group. No statistically significant
interaction was found between sex and LTPA with regard
to the main outcome events.
Ethics
The study was conducted according to the Helsinki Decla-
ration of the World Medical Association. The coordinating
ethics committee of the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital
District approved the study. All participants provided
informed consent. This report was written according to
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology guidelines for prospective cohort studies.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MORTALITY AND OLDER ADULTS

 RESULTS
Most of the participants were engaged in at least moderate
LTPA (Table S1). Participants with higher educational
levels had a higher prevalence of LTPA. Furthermore,
older adults with high LTPA seemed to have lower serum
cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and BMI than those
with low or moderate LTPA.
Moderate and high LTPA were associated with lower
risk of total mortality than low LTPA in multifactorial-
adjusted (age, area, study year, smoking, BMI, systolic
blood pressure, serum cholesterol, education, marital sta-
tus) analyses (moderate: HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47–0.77
and high: HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37–0.76, P for trend
<.001 in men; moderate: HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.43–0.82
and high: HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.13–0.53; P for trend

trend <.001 in both sexes combined (adjusted also for
sex)) (Table 1). Additional adjustment for inability to
practice physical activity did not alter the results mark-
edly.
Moderate and high LTPA were associated with lower
risk of CVD mortality than low LTPA in multifactorial-
adjusted analyses (moderate: HR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.31–
0.71 and high: HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.17–0.63, P for

(Table 2). Additional adjustment for inability to practice

risk of an incident CVD event than low LTPA in multifac-
torial-adjusted
analyses
(moderate:

95% CI = 0.54–0.88 and HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38–
0.79, P for trend .002 in both sexes combined) (Table 3).
Additional adjustment for inability to practice physical
activity affected the results relatively slightly, but the trend
test become non-significant in the sex specific analysis.
HRs for incident stroke are presented in Table 4. A
dose-dependent protective effect of moderate and high
LTPA was observed, and the effect was statistically signifi-
cant in men and in mean and women combined.
DISCUSSION
These findings indicate that LTPA is associated with lower
all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and CVD incidence in
older adults in dose-dependent manner. The protective
effect of baseline LTPA was independent of the known
major CVD risk factors (smoking, BMI, systolic blood
pressure, total cholesterol) and social position (education,
marital status). A statistically significant inverse association
between LTPA and CVD mortality and CVD incidence
was seen only in the analysis in men and in men and
women combined. When the relationship between LTPA
and risk of an incident CVD or stroke event was analyzed
separately, a statistically significant protective effect was
seen only in stroke.
Physical activity acts through many pathways, affect-
ing cardiometabolic vascular risk factors. Physical activity
maintains healthy body weight and body composition,
lowers
blood
pressure,
increases
fibrinolytic
activity,
reduces platelet aggregation, and improves cardiac func-
tion,
cardiorespiratory
fitness,
insulin
resistance,
and
plasma lipid profile.32–34 Exercise training has also been
shown
to improve endothelium-dependent
vasodilation
and increase urinary sodium excretion.35,36 In addition,
long-term physical activity has been shown to be associ-
ated with a decrease in atherogenic activity of blood
mononuclear cells and lower C-reactive protein levels.37,38
These results with regard to the benefit of physical
activity on all-cause mortality in older adults are in line

 with those of previous studies.11–13,15,17,20–22 Moderate
and high levels of LTPA have been shown to reduce all-
cause mortality in older men and women.20,22 In addition,
walking, a specific form of LTPA, has been found to be
associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality10,12,16
Apparently, even occasional physical activity reduces the
risk of all-cause mortality in older adults.22
The existing evidence of a benefit of LTPA with
regard to CVD mortality is to some extent controversial.
Men with the ability to walk more than 100 steps per min-
ute had lower CVD mortality than those who could not,10
and physical activity was associated with lower CVD mor-
tality in a 4-year follow-up of British men.21 Another
study11 found a 34% lower risk of CVD mortality in a fol-
low-up study of 9,518 community-dwelling white women
aged 65 and older. In a follow-up of approximately
10,000 Japanese adults aged 65 to 84 performing LTPA at
least twice per week, the risk of CVD mortality was 35%
lower for those performing LTPA at least five times per
week than for those performing LTPA fewer than five
times per week, but the risk reduction did not remain sta-
tistically significant after controlling for other cardiovascu-
lar risk factors.20
Only a few studies have assessed the association
between physical activity and stroke in older adults.
Greater physical activity was associated with lower risk of
stroke and related outcomes in individuals aged 45 to 74
in a recent metaanalysis of observational studies.39 In
agreement with the current results, a follow-up of ambula-
tory men free of CVD and heart failure revealed that time
spent walking was associated with risk of onset of stroke
in a dose–response fashion, independent of walking pace.16
Furthermore, of men aged 55 to 68 participating in the
Honolulu Heart Program, those who were inactive or

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MORTALITY AND OLDER ADULTS

 partially active had an incidence of hemorrhagic stroke
that was three to four times as great as that of active
men.40
Even though the relationship between LTPA was dose
dependent, it is important to know that moderate physical
activity levels are sufficient to gain a health benefit. A
recent systematic review showed that the largest health
benefit of physical activity was obtained by moving from
sedentary behavior to moderate levels of physical activ-
ity.41 This is of importance because older people may be
less likely to engage in vigorous-intensity LPTA. Walking
may be the easiest and safest way to reach moderate-inten-
sity levels of LTPA.42
Physical activity and other risk factors were assessed
only at the beginning of the follow-up, which is the main
limitation of the study. Thus, possible individual changes
in level of LTPA and other predictors of disease and mor-
tality during follow-up may have influenced the results.
Furthermore, assessment of LTPA level was based on semi-
quantitative questionnaire data, allowing ranking to be
defined but not the quantitative intensity or optimal doses
of activity. In addition, measurement error, particularly
overreporting of the amount of physical activity, especially
in older adults, is likely and could result in misclassifica-
tion of physical activity categories,43,44 but this type of
misclassification is difficult to avoid in large population-
based studies. Previous studies have also shown that the
semiquantitative questions on leisure time physical activity
have good criterion validity against morbidity and mortal-
ity and moderate correlation against accelerometer counts
in the working-age population.45,46 A common problem
difficult to adjust for in cohort studies is reverse causality.
Participation in moderate and more-strenuous LTPA may
be the effect of better health; it was attempted to account
for this by excluding people with CHD, stroke events,
prevalent heart failure, or cancer at baseline from the anal-
ysis. These are the most-frequent health conditions in this
age group that may reduce the ability to perform physical
activity. Furthermore, the data were analyzed adjusting for
self-reported inability to perform physical activity (Model
D). The results did not change with this adjustment.
Finally, the number of end-point events, particularly CVD
deaths and acute CHD events, was small among in, limit-
ing statistical power. Even though the HR estimates were
fairly similar in women and men, and there was no statis-
tically significant interaction between the sexes in the anal-
ysis,
the
fully
adjusted
HRs
were
not
statistically
significant in the analysis of women only. Only a few stud-
ies have been conducted in women, and they mainly stud-
ied the association between physical activity and all-cause
mortality.11,14,15,17,20
In
agreement
with
the
current
results, a previous study showed that increasing or main-
taining physical activity levels reduced all-cause mortality
for women aged 65 and older.11 The Jerusalem 70-Year-
olds Longitudinal Study also demonstrated that the sur-
vival advantage was independent of sex.14 Even though
some other studies included older women, they did not
report associations separately for women but adjusted their
analysis for sex.15,17,20
In conclusion, the current study showed that LTPA is
associated with lower all-cause and CVD mortality and
lower risk of an incident CVD event in older adults inde-
pendently of the major known CVD risk factors. The pro-
tective effect of LTPA is dose dependent, with a higher
level of physical activity having a stronger association.
