Opinion statement
Inappropriate sexual behavior (ISB) is a relatively common and potentially disruptive form
of behavior in people with dementia. It can cause considerable distress and put place-
ments and people at risk. Yet it is poorly researched and understood. In addition to non-
pharmacological approaches to management, a wide range of classes of medication has
been used in ISB, and the results have been reported as single cases or short series, though
none has been the subject of a randomized clinical trial, in part because of the lack of a
well-defined method of observing and measuring ISB, as well as the significant ethical
considerations. Pharmacological treatments for which there is low-level evidence of
efficacy in the literature include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, cho-
linesterase inhibitors, hormonal agents, and beta-blockers. None of the drugs discussed
here is licensed for use in ISB, and elderly people, particularly those with dementia, are at
high risk of adverse effects. Caution is advised before using medication in this group of
people. It is important to consider alternative non-pharmacological treatments, as well as
discussing issues of ethics and consent with those involved, before initiating treatment. It
is helpful to identify and monitor target symptoms. Pharmacological treatments should be
started at low dose and titrated up slowly and carefully. Nevertheless, in some situations,
medication may provide a useful part of a management plan for ISB.
Introduction
Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life. Al-
though sexual activity often decreases in elderly people,
sexual interest may not [1]. Despite this, sexual expres-
sion among older adults is often perceived as non-exis-
tent, humorous, grotesque, or even sordid and
disgusting [2]. However, as in younger people, not all
sexual behavior in older people is inappropriate.
In elderly patients with dementia, a combination of
cognitive deterioration, worsening judgment, and per-
sonality changes probably contributes to changes in

 sexual attitude and behavior. The most common alter-
ation reported in people with dementia is apathy and
indifference to sex [3]. Nevertheless, inappropriate
sexual behavior (ISB, also known as sexually
disinhibited behavior, or hypersexuality) has been con-
sistently described in most dementia syndromes [4].
Definition
The concept of ISB has developed over time [5••]. Johnson et al. define
it as, Ba disruptive behavior characterized by a verbal or physical act of
an explicit or perceived sexual nature, which is unacceptable within the
social context in which it is carried out^ [6], while de Medeiros et al.
suggest that BISB is a specific sexual behavior marked by apparent loss
of control or intimacy-seeking misplaced in the social context or di-
rected towards the wrong target; behavior may be not sexual in its form
but in its suggestion^ [7]. ISB should be seen as a part of the symptom
cluster of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances associated with de-
mentia, which is disruptive and distressing, and impairs the care of the
patient [8].
Classification
ISB can include sex talk (i.e., using foul language that is not in keeping with the
patient’s premorbid personality), sexual acts (i.e., acts of touching, grabbing,
exposing, or masturbating, which can occur in private or in public areas), and
implied sexual acts (i.e., openly reading pornographic material or requesting
unnecessary genital care) [9].
ISB can be divided in conventional and non-paraphilic (i.e., sexual
interest arise within socially and culturally accepted boundaries), versus
unconventional and paraphilic (i.e., sexual arousal that deviates from
previous restrictions, for instance, involving children, animals, and non-
consenting people) [10].
In one observational study, sexual behavior was coded as follows:
appropriate (e.g., sitting close to someone with arms or legs touching,
kissing, stroking someone on the face, hands, or arms), ambiguous (e.g.,
being undressed outside the bedroom or bathroom, rubbing up against
another person, touching self on breasts or genitals in public), and
inappropriate (e.g., making explicit sexual comments, touching someone
other than partner on breast or genitals, touching partner on breast or
genitals in public, exposing breasts or genitals in public) [11]. Despite
its thoroughness, this classification has several flaws. Firstly, the concept
of appropriateness varies among individuals and can be affected by
numerous elements, such as religious beliefs or prevailing societal views
of elderly persons [12]. Acts like public undressing or genital touching
may be misinterpreted as sexual, when in fact they can result from pain,
discomfort, hyperthermia, or attempts to be freed from a restrained
environment [6]. Normal needs for sex and intimacy in older adults are
frequently regarded as an inappropriate increase in sexual drive [8].
Lastly, inappropriateness often stems from judgmental mind-sets and
41

 arbitrations of the observers (clinical staff, family, and other residents),
rather than the sexual activities themselves [13].
Epidemiology
The overall prevalence of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia is
50–80 % [14]; thus, the majority of people with dementia may experience some
of these symptoms. The occurrence of ISB in demented individuals reportedly
ranges from 7 to 25 %, with higher prevalence in residents of skilled nursing
facilities and in patients with more severe cognitive impairment [9, 15]. Physical
manifestations appear to be more frequent in males [16], whereas women seem
more verbal [17].
ISB can be a threat to the mental and physical health of patients and others
[18]; for example, repeated masturbation can cause genital trauma [19]. These
activities can cause anxiety, distress, and embarrassment in caregivers, often
disrupting the continuity of care at home and leading to confinement at home
or institutionalization [20]. Finally, sexualized conducts may cause a conflict
between ethical and legal responsibilities of clinicians, since hindering sexual
expression can be seen as a violation of the principle of autonomy [18];
therefore, the capacity to consent needs to be assessed [21].
Etiology
Many neurobiological and psychosocial factors can contribute to the onset and
maintenance of ISB. The neurobiological basis of sexuality is likely founded on
complex interactions between different brain systems, neuroendocrine factors,
and neurotransmitters.
Four brain systems have been implicated in the neurobiology of ISB: the
frontal lobes, the temporo-limbic network, the cortico-striatal circuits, and the
hypothalamus [8]. Dysfunction of the frontal lobes, often seen in dementia, is
known to trigger disinhibited behaviors [22], and it has been associated with
ISB [23]. Bilateral lesions of the temporal regions result in Klüver-Bucy syn-
drome, which includes autoerotic behavior and hyperorality [24]; hypersexu-
ality has been reported after temporo-limbic strokes [25], tumors [26], and
epilepsy [27]. Some authors have conceptualized hypersexuality as being
obsessive-compulsive in nature, thus involving cortico-striatal circuits, as in
Huntington’s disease [28], Tourette’s syndrome [29], and Wilson’s disease [30].
Lastly, lesions to the right hypothalamus and periventricular area can cause
manic symptoms, including increased sexual drive [31].
Neuroendocrine factors affecting ISB include androgens, estrogens, proges-
terone, prolactin, oxytocin, cortisol, pheromones, and neurotransmitters and
neuropeptides including nitric oxide, serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, nor-
adrenaline, opioids, acetylcholine, histamine, and gamma-aminobutyric
acid [32].
Psychotropic drugs such as levodopa, benzodiazepines, and alcohol have all
been linked with increased agitation and sexual disinhibition [33].
Psychosocial issues often contribute to the onset of ISB in predisposed
demented patients; these factors include mood instability, premorbid patterns
of sexual activity and interest, lack of habitual sexual partner or
Curr Treat Options Neurol (2016) 18: 41

41
 misidentification of someone else as usual partner, lack of privacy,
understimulating or unfamiliar environment, misinterpretation of cues, and
potentially many others [33]. These aspects are explored more fully by Benbow
and Beeston [34••].
Assessment
A good management plan should be based on a thorough assessment of a
patient’s personal, clinical, and sexual history, including who is involved, what
form the ISB takes, when and where it occurs, how frequent it is, and other
factors such as potential precipitants and consequences of the behavior [33]. If
the patient is severely impaired, then a history should be obtained from the
caregivers or family members [8]. Lawrie and Jillings emphasize the importance
of considering the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a sexual behavior
according to the larger context, and managing contributory factors such as
boredom, loneliness, or misinterpreted gestures of communication [35].
Some behavior measurement tools for patients with dementia include items
relating to ISB. The Ryden Aggression Scale contains a section on sexually
aggressive behavior including making obscene gestures, touching body parts of
another person, hugging, intercourse, or kissing [36]. The St Andrew’s Sexual
Behavior Assessment (SASBA) is based on continuous direct observation of four
categories of ISB, each with four levels of severity, helping clinicians to stan-
dardize their documentation of ISB [37].
A systematic physical and mental state examination and a review of the
current medication regime must always be carried out [5••]. In the case of an
abrupt onset of the ISB, laboratory testing and neuroimaging studies to evaluate
for delirium or a new structural lesion should be considered [8].
Aims
This study systematically reviews the published literature on the current treat-
ment options for ISB in older adults with dementia in order to support the
clinician in managing ISB.
Methods
A systematic research of the databases MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane
Library was conducted for publications on ISB in dementia until April 2016.
Using the MeSH terms Binappropriate sexual behavior,^ Bdementia,^
BAlzheimer’s disease,^ Bfrontotemporal dementia,^ Bvascular dementia,^ BLewy
body disease,^ and Bmild cognitive impairment,^ we retrieved 162 records, to
which other 18 and 24 articles were added using respectively the non-MeSH
terms Bsexual disinhibition^ and Bhypersexuality.^ We performed a hand-search
of the reference list of the studies identified, especially previous reviews, which
identified a further nine significant publications. We eliminated 24 duplicate
records. We looked for original articles, namely case reports, case series, case-
control and cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials; however, we also
considered previous reviews and expert opinions published where evidence-
41

 based studies were lacking. Finally, we selected 37 original articles which
contained information regarding treatment of ISB in dementia. We present the
evidence divided into non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.
Results
Non-pharmacological treatment
Although there are few reports of non-pharmacological interventions and
there is a lack of evidence for their efficacy, there is a general agreement
that they should be the first-line treatment for ISB in elderly people with
dementia [20], principally because of concerns about safety and ethics
[38]. However, clinicians often manage problematic behavior with
medication because of the ease of administration, perceived efficacy
[39], and lack of trained staff members [40].
Non-pharmacological treatment can be divided into environmental,
behavioral (or cognitive-behavioral), and educational. These interven-
tions should involve not only the patients but also families and the
nursing staff for institutionalized subjects, bearing in mind that the aim
is to try and promote an appropriate manifestation of sexual behavior
rather than an eradication of it [41•].
Environmental approaches
Despite a lack of studies, making changes in the environment, with adjustment
of misinterpreted social cues, is often regarded as a simple and effective inter-
vention; for example, switching from a female to a male staff member, or
avoiding overstimulating television or radio programs or magazines can be
helpful [41•]. Likewise, in nursing homes, single rooms and provision for
conjugal visits may reduce the frequency of ISB by satisfying the patient’s
normal sexual drive [41•].
Behavioral approaches
Few studies of behavioral approaches have been published. A case series of ten
people with dementia and ten age- and sex-matched controls showed that
consistent redirection and enhanced communication through an interpreter
was associated with a reduction of ISB [23]. Other authors have suggested that
sensitive explanation to the patient on why such behavior is unacceptable, as
well as verbal or physical redirection, is beneficial. In institutions, when a
resident enters the bed of another resident, simply redirecting the person to
their room may be sufficient, since this conduct could arise from a search for
intimacy without sexual purposes, or disorientation [41•].
A variety of distraction techniques are recommended for controlling ISB: in
the context of understimulating settings, provision of social activity (snacks,
drinks, conversation, exercising, and walking) can reduce boredom [41•]; sim-
ilarly, involvement in crafts to occupy the hands can prevent inappropriate
touching or public masturbation [42]. A case report of a 68-year-old man with
dementia in residential care employed a different stratagem: when this man
became agitated and inappropriately touched staff and female residents, he was
isolated from female residents and unsuccessfully trialed on different
Curr Treat Options Neurol (2016) 18: 41

41
 antipsychotics; then, he was given a stuffed toy replica of the Pink Panther, and
he started to fondle this puppet inappropriately, becoming less intrusive with
people [43].
Referral to specialized psychogeriatric services may be useful, although not
always available. A controlled case series comprising 33 patients with behav-
ioral and psychotic symptoms of dementia (including, but not restricted to,
ISB) and 22 matched controls compared usual care to individualized assess-
ment and care delivered by a multidisciplinary team, such as a psychiatric nurse
with access to older adults psychiatry and geriatric medicine specialists. Access
to the multidisciplinary team was effective and associated with less use of
psychotropic medications [44].
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for ISB can include re-education
of the patient about social norms, encouragement to explore the inten-
tions behind each behavior in order to address cognitive distortions, and
negative conditioning techniques; however, this approach can be chal-
lenging in people with significant cognitive impairment [45], and there
is a lack of published data.
In patients with a tendency for exhibitionism or public masturbation,
practical solutions such as clothing that opens at the back or lacks
zippers have been proposed [18]. Such techniques are controversial
because of their ethical implications [46].
Psycho-education (family, caregivers, staff)
Evidence from three studies shows that education of family, caregivers, and staff
about sexuality and aging is associated with more permissive attitudes and
benefit for people with ISB [47–49]; more specifically, sex-education programs,
which emphasize the need for normal sexual expression while preventing
inappropriate conducts, seem to add to the quality of life of a person with
dementia.
The partner, who often needs reassurance that ISB originates from illness
and is not a reflection of their relationship, may benefit from supportive
psychotherapy, which can help to reframe their partner’s sexual requests as calls
for intimacy and reassurance [50].
Pharmacological treatment
Despite pharmacological treatments being more frequently used than non-
pharmacological approaches [51], there are no randomized controlled trials
for any of the drugs commonly prescribed, with all current evidence emerging
from case series and case reports.
Pharmacological treatments for which there is evidence of efficacy in litera-
ture include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase
inhibitors, hormonal agents, and beta-blockers.
In older patients, an important rules of prescribing is Bstart low, go slow,^
monitoring carefully for side effects and response. Where possible, it is helpful
to identify target symptoms or behaviors which can be quantified, in order to
assess response. Many older people are prescribed many agents simultaneously,
and so the possibility of drug interactions must be considered in each case.
None of the agents discussed here is licensed for use in ISB, and so the physician
41

 must carefully consider their use and advise patients and caregivers of risks and
benefits.
Anxiolytic agents
Tiller et al. report an 80-year-old person with vascular dementia who was
treated with buspirone 5 mg three times daily: improvement of ISB was
reported after only 5 days; this treatment was continued for 6 weeks, and no
relapse was observed within 1 month from stopping [52].
We have not identified any reports of benefits of benzodiazepines in elderly
people with ISB. Caution is required as these agents may cause paradoxical
reactions with increased agitation in the elderly [53], and they may worsen
cognitive impairment and cause dependence.
Antidepressants
The concept of using antidepressants for the treatment of ISB derives
from their known anti-libidinal effects [54], as well as their anti-
obsessional properties [55].
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are commonly used as
first-line agents due to their superior safety and tolerability profile in the
elderly [56]. Reported results are inconsistent. Paroxetine 20 mg was
used with beneficial effect within 1 week and no substantial side effects
in a 69-year-old man with ISB and alcoholic dementia, who had not
responded to haloperidol, chlorpromazine, lorazepam, lithium, and
nortriptyline [57]. A more recent case report of a 90-year-old woman
residing in a nursing home describes treatment failure with paroxetine,
whereas a sharp reduction of aggressive and sexually disinhibited be-
havior was seen with citalopram 20 mg [58]. A similar positive outcome
was observed in 85-year-old man with dementia treated with citalopram
at the same dose [59]. A 76-year-old person with vascular dementia
treated with citalopram did not respond, whereas mirtazapine up to
30 mg was effective [23].
Among tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), only the use of clomipramine has been
reported in ISB. In one case report, two elderly people with dementia and ISB
responded to clomipramine 150–175 mg after no response to thioridazine; how-
ever, one of these patients had been initially prescribed 200 mg of clomipramine
which had to be stopped and re-titrated due to postural hypotension [60].
In four males with dementia who had failed to respond to several first-
generation antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, a good response was reported for
all subjects with trazodone between 100 and 500 mg [61].
The most common side effects associated with the use of SSRIs are gastro-
intestinal problems, headache, and hypersensitivity reactions. There is a low but
definite risk of serotonin syndrome if prescribed in combination with other
serotonergic agents. If discontinued abruptly, some patients experience a with-
drawal syndrome.
Tricyclic antidepressants can have troublesome side effects in older people.
There is a risk of postural hypotension, which can lead to falls, and anticholinergic
effects including constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention. They can have
serious cardiac effects and can be fatal in overdose.

 Costs of antidepressants are relatively low, although can be higher for some
newer agents.
Antipsychotics
Antipsychotics are commonly used for treating behavioral and psychotic
symptoms of dementia (BPSD), although this indication is not licensed and the
US Food and Drug Administration has issued two black box warnings about the
use of respectively second-generation [62] and first-generation antipsychotics
[63] in elderly demented people.
There are two case reports of the use of quetiapine for treating ISB. One was
an 85-year-old man with dementia, parkinsonism, and compulsory masturba-
tion to the point of self-harm; he showed no response to hormonal treatment
and paroxetine, but symptoms disappeared after using quetiapine 25 mg after
just 2 days, and did not recur in a follow-up period of 2 months, with no side
effects reported, nor worsening parkinsonism [64]. The second was a 61-year-
old woman with Lewy body dementia, who showed a reduction of ISB after
treatment with quetiapine titrated up to 75 mg [65].
Two case reports describe the successful use of haloperidol. A 70-year-old
man who presented with excessive masturbation following a frontal lobe injury
showed a marked reduction of symptoms with haloperidol 3 mg [66]. A 90-
year-old man with Alzheimer’s disease and an array of behavioral symptoms
including urethral masturbation with foreign bodies and sexual disinhibition
had a good response to haloperidol 1.5 mg [67].
Side effects of antipsychotics can be very significant. There is a small but
definite increased risk of stroke or cardiac events in people with dementia, and
this has led to national advice in many countries to avoid their use in dementia
wherever possible. Sedation and impairment of cognitive function is common.
Atypical antipsychotics can produce weight gain and a metabolic syndrome.
Older agents may have anticholinergic effects and more rarely cause dermato-
logical, hematological, or endocrine problems.
Older antipsychotic agents are mostly low in cost, but newer ones may be
substantially more expensive.
Anticonvulsants
Anticonvulsants have been trialed for the treatment of ISB in dementia; how-
ever, the underlying mechanism by which they affect sexual function is still
poorly understood [68].
Gabapentin is known to cause reduced libido, anorgasmia, and erectile
dysfunction [42]. Three case reports describe reduced ISB in people with de-
mentia treated with gabapentin [69–71].
Carbamazepine has been associated with lower testosterone levels in young
women with epilepsy [72]. There are two case reports of its use in ISB. A 78-year-
old man with Alzheimer’s disease was unsuccessfully treated with donepezil,
galantamine, and pipamperone, while carbamazepine 200 mg proved effective
[73]. A 78-year-old man diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia failed to
respond to paroxetine. Carbamazepine was started and titrated to a maximum
dosage of 800 mg (serum concentration = 6.0 mg/L); the ISB completely abated
and did not recur over the subsequent 6 months [74].
41

 Valproate salts have not proved useful in controlling agitation in dementia
[75], and currently, there is no evidence that they might work in ISB.
Anticonvulsants can have a wide range of side effects including sedation,
gastro-intestinal problems, risk of falls, hypo- or hypertension, and endocrine
changes. Gabapentin and its close relative pregabalin are relatively expensive,
valproate salts intermediate in cost (depending on formulation), and carba-
mazepine relatively inexpensive.
Cholinesterase inhibitors
Cholinesterase inhibitors may affect sexual function in many ways, including
altering testosterone levels, but the exact processes involved are still uncertain
[76].
Studies evaluating the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on ISB are con-
flicting. Two case reports described a reduction of ISB with rivastigmine treat-
ment up to 3 mg [77, 78], although other reports describe the emergence of ISB
in patients taking donepezil [79, 80].
The commonest side effects are gastro-intestinal, but there can be effects on
sleep and arousal. Donepezil is available as a generic form which is less
expensive than others.
Hormonal agents
The use of hormonal treatment for ISB is in the elderly is controversial, espe-
cially in terms of social stigma associated with drugs seen as a means of
Bchemical castration^ [8].
Antiandrogens and other drugs with antiandrogenic activity
Antiandrogens may reduce androgen levels or inhibit binding at androgen
receptors.
Medroxyprogesterone (MPA) does not bind to androgen receptors, but indi-
rectly decreases the level of testosterone by inhibiting the secretion of pituitary
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). One case
report describes four patients aged between 75 and 84 whose ISB did not
respond to first-generation antipsychotics, but stopped 1 week after adminis-
tration of MPA 300 mg intramuscularly on a weekly basis for 1 year, with a
90 % reduction in serum testosterone levels, which returned to the normal
range on stopping MPA [81]. One year later, the same author published
another case report of four patients, this time treated with oral MPA 100 mg,
obtaining similar results and a complete long-term remission of ISB in three
out of four patients. One subject relapsed, but symptoms were much milder
than before [82]. Another case report for two patients, aged 72 and 84, who
failed to show improvement with thioridazine, describes remission with MPA
100–200 mg intramuscularly fortnightly [83]. Similar results are reported in an
86-year-old man with Alzheimer’s disease and ISB [84]. A man aged 76 with
alcoholic dementia and ISB was initially responsive to paroxetine, but the
response faded. Serial treatments with MPA up to 750 mg weekly then restored
a response: lower doses failed to reduce testosterone levels [85]. A case series
describes five people who were all successfully treated with MPA 100–300 mg
Curr Treat Options Neurol (2016) 18: 41

41
 intramuscularly fortnightly with no side effects reported [86]. Bardell et al.
report successful treatment with MPA in three elderly patients with ISB [23].
Cyproterone acetate (CPA) inhibits the interaction between endogenous an-
drogens and androgen receptors, as well as reducing the biosynthesis of
androgens. Effective treatment of ISB with CPA 50 mg was reported in a 60-
year-old man with AIDS-related dementia [87]; however, another case report
described unsuccessful CPA treatment in a 70-year-old with dementia, with
additional numerous adverse effects impacting on mobility [88]. CPA 10 mg
was used with beneficial effect in two males with dementia-related ISB that had
not responded to treatment with antipsychotic or sedative medication. The
behavior re-emerged in both people when attempts were made to reduce the
dose [89].
Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor which inhibits the conversion of tes-
tosterone to active dihydrotestosterone. In a case series of 11 elderly men with
ISB and vascular dementia, it was successful in six subjects within 8 weeks,
while the other five patients required alternative treatments, such as propran-
olol and quetiapine [90].
Cimetidine (H2 antagonist), spironolactone (potassium-sparing diuretic), and
ketoconazole (antifungal) all show antiandrogenic effects; they have been used
in a case series of 17 men and 3 women with ISB. Of these, 14 responded to
either cimetidine 600–1600 mg, spironolactone 75 mg, or ketoconazole, or to
all three drugs combined together [91].
Estrogens
Estrogens inhibit the secretion of LH and FSH, thus diminishing testoster-
one production.
In one case report of the use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in a 94-year-old man
who presented with very significant episodes of sexual aggression towards
other in-patients, there was a response to DES 1 mg within 3 weeks [92].
A large case series reports improvement of ISB in 38 out of 39 people with
dementia who were treated with oral estrogen 0.625 mg or transdermal
estrogen patches 0.5–0.10 mg [93]. A case is reported of a 75-year-old patient
with dementia who failed to respond to thioridazine, but responded to
transdermal estrogen within 1 week, which allowed tapering of the antipsy-
chotic [94].
Conjugated estrogen 0.625–1.875 mg was used successfully, without any
specific side effects, in two 78-year-old patients respectively with Alzheimer’s
disease and vascular dementia who had failed to respond to various anti-
psychotics [95].
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHA) suppress testosterone
production by stimulating the secretion of pituitary LH and FSH, with subse-
quent increase in estrogen levels and decrease of testosterone.
There are two case reports of the use of leuprolide acetate in ISB: the first
describes improvement after leuprolide acetate 7.5 mg intramuscularly every
month in a 43-year-old patient with dementia and Klüver-Bucy syndrome who
had not responded to pindolol [96]; the second is in a 73-year-old man with
41
Page 10 of 15
Curr Treat Options Neurol (2016) 18: 41
 vascular dementia and comorbid depression who did not respond to MPA,
but in whom leuprolide at the same dose, 8 weekly was beneficial [23].
Safety and side effects are important issues in prescribing hormonal agents. In
females, there may be menopausal symptoms, though this may be less com-
mon in post-menopausal women. Osteoporosis, edema, weight change, and
mood changes may occur. Costs of GnRHA can be high, although estrogens
and antiandrogens are generally less expensive.
Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers can cause sexual dysfunction and reduced sexual behavior, pos-
sibly via a decrease of the adrenergic drive [97].
Propranolol 360 mg was effective in controlling verbal and physical ag-
gression, but not sexually aggressive and inappropriate behavior, which only
responded to treatment with leuprolide [96].
In a 75-year-old demented man with aggressive and hypersexual behaviors
which had not responded to haloperidol and hydroxyzine, both agitation and
hypersexual behavior diminished within 2 weeks of adding pindolol 40 mg to
his drug regime [98].
Beta-blockers slow the heart rate and are contraindicated in patients with
heart block and asthma. They can cause coldness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
Most are inexpensive agents.
Combination therapy
Combination therapy with various medications described above has been
suggested for persistent ISB [42]. Several case reports describe combinations of
drugs to treat these symptoms [99], but clinicians should be cautious with
polypharmacy in the elderly, especially when it involves carbamazepine or
cimetidine, as these drugs have important effects on hepatic metabolism and
pharmacological interactions [42], and elderly people are particularly vulnera-
ble to adverse effects of medication.
Discussion
Case reports and case series describe successful treatment of ISB with a range of
classes of medication, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvul-
sants, cholinesterase inhibitors, hormonal agents, and beta-blockers. All of
these agents can have adverse effects, and none of them emerges as a clear first
choice for pharmacological management of ISB.
The quality of evidence in this area is limited to case reports and case series.
Studies are further limited by a lack of a widely agreed definition of ISB, and
only very limited objective methods for measuring it. There are no randomized
controlled trials. The present paper reviews published data on pharmacological
interventions for ISB, but is not intended to provide a complete review of a field
where it is essential to ensure that there is a full assessment of the problem,
careful attention to ethics and consent, and careful monitoring of response.
As there is little evidence to suggest that one type of agent is more efficacious
than another in this area, it is important to pay particular attention to risks in

 making a choice of agent. There will need to be a careful balancing of risk and
potential benefit. Although there is a lack of published evidence to show that
behavioral, supportive, and educational approaches to managing ISB are effec-
tive, clinicians may wish to start by considering the place of non-drug man-
agement. Involvement of staff, families, and caregivers in discussion will be
important. It is important to rule out treatable causes of ISB such as pain,
boredom, lack of stimulation, and lack of an outlet for affectional needs. Only
then should medication be considered. Although all agents carry risks, the
overall risks associated with SSRI antidepressants are relatively lower than with
other drugs, and these may be a reasonable first choice. Cholinesterase inhib-
itors may be a sensible next step. Antipsychotics and hormonal agents may have
very significant side effects and should be used with caution. In all cases, it is
helpful to define target symptoms or behaviors and to provide care staff or
caregivers with a simple means of recording these so that the success or other-
wise of treatment can be evaluated. Attention must be paid to the emergence of
side effects. Most of the patients involved are likely to be old and often frail so
that it is wise to start prescribing at low dose and to increase only very slowly.
There is a need for a better understanding of the nature of ISB and better
methods of describing and measuring it. Only then will it be possible to carry
out well-designed, double-blind randomized controlled trials in order to eval-
uate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of the treatments of ISB.
