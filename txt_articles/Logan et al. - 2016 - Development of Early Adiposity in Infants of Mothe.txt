 Development of Early Adiposity
in Infants of Mothers With
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1045–1051 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0030
OBJECTIVE
Infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at greater
risk of later adverse metabolic health. We examined plausible candidate media-
tors, adipose tissue (AT) quantity and distribution and intrahepatocellular lipid
(IHCL) content, comparing infants of mothers with GDM and without GDM (con-
trol group) over the first 3 postnatal months.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study using MRI and spectroscopy to
quantify whole-body and regional AT volumes, and IHCL content, within 2 weeks
and 8–12 weeks after birth. We adjusted for infant size and sex and maternal
prepregnancy BMI. Values are reported as the mean difference (95% CI).
RESULTS
We recruited 86 infants (GDM group 42 infants; control group 44 infants). Mothers
with GDM had good pregnancy glycemic control. Infants were predominantly
breast-fed up to the time of the second assessment (GDM group 71%; control
group 74%). Total AT volumes were similar in the GDM group compared with the
control group at a median age of 11 days (228 cm3 [95% CI 2121, 65], P = 0.55), but
were greater in the GDM group at a median age of 10 weeks (247 cm3 [56, 439], P =
0.01). After adjustment for size, the GDM group had significantly greater total AT
volume at 10 weeks than control group infants (16.0% [6.0, 27.1], P = 0.002). AT
distribution and IHCL content were not significantly different at either time point.
CONCLUSIONS
Adiposity in GDM infants is amplified in early infancy, despite good maternal
glycemic control and predominant breast-feeding, suggesting a potential causal
pathway to later adverse metabolic health. Reduction in postnatal adiposity may
be a therapeutic target to reduce later health risks.
Diabetes in pregnancy is increasing and currently affects up to 5% of women in the
U.K. (1) and up to 9.2% in the U.S. (2). Approximately 87.5% of cases are gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM), 7.5% are type 1 diabetes, and 5% are type 2 diabetes (1).
The offspring of mothers with diabetes have greater risks of adverse metabolic
sequelae in childhood and later life that appear to be additional to genetic pre-
disposition (3–5).
The underlying mechanisms are unclear, but increased infant adiposity is a plau-
sible mediator because adiposity in childhood and adult life are associated with
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (6). The Hyperglycemia and Adverse

CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK
 Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study iden-
tified a strong association between
maternal glycemia and anthropometry-
derived adiposity in newborn infants (7).
The first 3 months of life is a critical pe-
riod for adipose tissue (AT) deposition
(8), but, to our knowledge, longitudinal
examination of the quantity and distri-
bution of AT in early infancy has not
been undertaken in the offspring of
mothers with diabetes.
Internal abdominal AT is associated
with higher metabolic risk (9), whereas
abdominal or nonabdominal superficial
subcutaneous AT may be protective
(10). Indirect body composition tech-
niques require assumptions to enable
the calculation of fat mass, and although
they may provide an indication of fat
mass distribution, they are unable to dif-
ferentiate individual AT compartments.
We aimed to examine total and re-
gional AT volumes using a direct tech-
nique, whole-body MRI, soon after
birth and again in later infancy, in a pro-
spective cohort of infants of mothers
with GDM and control infants. Intrahe-
patocellular lipid (IHCL) content has a
strong association with internal abdom-
inal AT and may be more closely linked
with adverse metabolic outcomes (11),
and, because nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease is now the most common
form of chronic liver disease in children
(12), we also aimed to compare IHCL
content.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We recruited healthy, full-term (37–42
weeks) infants with GDM and control
infants from the postnatal wards at
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Lon-
don, U.K., between October 2011 and
October 2014. This is a major teaching
hospital, with ;6,000 births each year.
We endeavored to approach all mothers
with GDM and similar numbers of con-
trol subjects. We used no additional se-
lection criteria, and recruited in keeping
with the availability of the MRI scanner.
We excluded mothers with preexisting
diabetes and small-for-gestational-age
infants because we have previously
shown them to have altered AT distribu-
tion (13). We undertook assessments at
the following two time points: within 2
weeks of birth and at 8–12 weeks after
birth. If the initial scan was unsuccessful,
the infant did not continue in the study.
The study received approval from the
National Research Ethics Committee
(reference 11/LO/1167), and informed,
written maternal consent was obtained.
Hospital policy was for all women
with risk factors for GDM to undergo a
standard 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance
test at 26 weeks of gestation. If the results
were normal, in women with previous
GDM this was repeated at 30 weeks. All
women without risk factors underwent a
1-h, 50-g glucose screening test at 26–
28 weeks of gestation. Those with ab-
normal screening results ($7.8 mmol/L)
then had a full oral glucose tolerance
test. GDM was diagnosed in mothers
by the obstetric team using the follow-
ing criteria: fasting plasma glucose con-
centration $5.3 mmol/L or 2-h plasma
glucose concentration $7.8 mmol/L.
Women were referred to the antenatal
diabetes clinic for dietary and exercise
advice, and were requested to monitor
premeal and postmeal blood glucose
levels. Target blood glucose levels
were ,5.5 mmol/L premeal and ,7.8
mmol/L 1 h postmeal. Metformin treat-
ment was considered in obese or se-
verely insulin-resistant women, and
insulin treatment was commenced if
blood glucose levels exceeded target
ranges.
We used maternal height recorded at
the antenatal booking and prepreg-
nancy weight obtained by maternal re-
call to calculate the prepregnancy BMI.
Recalled and measured prepregnancy
weight are highly correlated (14). We
measured infant weight, length, and oc-
cipital frontal circumference (OFC) at
the time of imaging. Weight was ob-
tained using scales (M-300 Portable
Baby Scale; Marsden, London, U.K.; pre-
cision 62 g), length was measured
using a Rollametre (Raven Equipment
Ltd., Dunmow, Essex, U.K.), and OFC was
recorded using a tape measure (Child
Growth Foundation, London, U.K.).
We classified infant feeding as exclu-
sively or predominantly breast-fed, ex-
clusively or predominantly formula fed,
or mixed fed (similar proportions of
breast milk and formula). Ethnicity was
reported by parents, and was catego-
rized as Asian, Afro-Caribbean, Cauca-
sian, African, and mixed race.
We estimated the sample size for the
primary outcome using pilot data and
simulation, based on 5% significance,
adjusting for infant size, and allowing
for the possibility of an interaction
between maternal diabetes status
and infant sex. We calculated that 42
infants in each group would provide
80% power to detect a mean difference
between GDM and control infants of
86 cm3 (11% difference) in total AT vol-
ume and 90% power to detect a differ-
ence of 6 cm3 (38%) in the smallest of the
measured regional compartments, the
abdominal deep subcutaneous com-
partment. We considered these differ-
ences likely to be clinically relevant
because they are similar to that be-
tween preterm-at-term and healthy
term infants (15), and the former is a
group also at risk for later adverse met-
abolic health. We therefore aimed to
continue recruitment until a minimum
of 42 infants in each group had com-
pleted the first MRI assessment.
MRI Procedures
We scanned infants in natural post-
prandial sleep, without sedation, in ac-
cordance with a protocol established
by our research group (16). Imaging
data were acquired on a 1.5-T magnet
(MAGNETOM Avanto; Siemens Medical
Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using the
integral body coil. Infants were scanned
in the supine position in the axial plane
during free breathing. Full body imaging
took ;20 min. We used a T1-weighted
fast spin echo sequence with a repeti-
tion time of 514 ms, an echo time of
11 ms, an echo train length of 3, and
three signal averages. Each slice was
5 mm thick with a 5-mm gap. The field of
view was 300 3 300 mm with a matrix
of 320 3 320 mm, leading to pixel sizes
of 0.9375 3 0.9375 mm. AT volume was
calculated for six regional depots. AT was
classified as subcutaneous or internal;
subcutaneous AT was further separated
into superficial or deep, and the three
compartments were divided into abdom-
inal (image slices from the sacrum to the
top of the liver) or nonabdominal depots.
Individual compartments were summed
to give total AT volume. We used the fol-
lowing ratio to assess AT distribution:
internal abdominal AT/nonabdominal
superficial subcutaneous AT. AT area (in
square centimeters) for each slice was
calculated as the sum of the pixels mul-
tiplied by the pixel area. AT volume (in
cubic centimeters) for each slice was cal-
culated by multiplying the area by the
sum of the slice thickness (0.5 cm) and the
interslice distance (0.5 cm). Images were

Early Adiposity in Infants of Mothers With GDM

 analyzed by a single observer using a
commercially available software program
(SliceOmatic, version 4.2; TomoVision,
Montreal, Canada), widely used in body
composition studies. This analysis wasun-
dertaken independently of the investiga-
tors by the VardisGroup (London, U.K.
[www.vardisgroup.com]), and investiga-
tors were blinded to group status.
To measure IHCL, we acquired a three-
plane half-Fourier acquisition single-shot
turbo spin-echo (HASTE) localizer of the
liver. This ensured accurate positioning
of the voxel in the right lobe of the liver,
avoiding blood vessels and other tissues.
We obtained 1H magnetic resonance
spectra using point-resolved spectros-
copy with the following parameters: rep-
etition time 1,500 ms, echo time 135 ms
without water suppression and with
128 signal averages, and a 15 3 15 3
15 mm voxel size. Spectra were analyzed
using the advanced method for accu-
rate, robust, and efficient spectral fitting
(AMARES) algorithm in the MRUI soft-
ware package, version 5 (17). Peak areas
for water and lipid resonances were ob-
tained, and T1 and T2 corrections were
performed (18). Hepatic water was used
as an internal standard, with results ex-
pressed as a CH2 lipid/water ratio 3 100.
Spectra were analyzed by a single re-
search radiographer blinded to the dia-
betes group.
Statistics
Data were analyzed using SPSS version
22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive data
are presented as the mean (SD) for nor-
mally distributed data, or the median
and interquartile range where data
were non-normal. Where data were nor-
mally distributed, independent-sample
t tests were used for between-group
comparisons. For other continuous data,
t tests were applied to log-transformed
data where this was normal; otherwise,
the Mann-Whitney U test was applied
to the original data. x2 tests were used
to test for differences among categori-
cal data. We compared the following in
GDM group infants and control infants:
total and compartmental AT volumes,
AT distribution, and IHCL at each assess-
ment and the change in total AT vol-
ume between assessments. We used
statistically optimal indices to adjust
AT volume for infant size. These are
AT volume/length (cubed) in the neo-
natal period (first assessment) and AT
volume/length (squared) in early in-
fancy (second assessment) (19). IHCL
in infants is correlated with postnatal
age, but not with infant size (20), and
was adjusted for the former. After ad-
justment for size, the results are not ex-
pressed in conventional units, and for
ease of interpretation, we presented
the mean percentage differences by
comparing log-transformed outcomes
between groups and exponentiating
the regression coefficient. Using multi-
variable regression analysis (general-
ized linear models), we also adjusted
outcomes for infant sex and maternal
prepregnancy BMI. To check for the vi-
olation of regression assumptions, we
assessed standardized residuals for nor-
mality. To further assess any possible
influence of maternal prepregnancy
BMI on the association between ma-
ternal GDM and infant adiposity, we
performed a subgroup analysis in women
withnormalprepregnancyBMI(,25kg/m2).
In order to assess whether differences in
ethnicity influenced results, we also per-
formed a sensitivity analysis using data
only from Caucasian infants.
RESULTS
We approached the families of 425 in-
fants in total. Recruitment is detailed in
Fig. 1. Eighty-eight infants attended the
first assessment; two infants did not set-
tle sufficiently for image acquisition.
Families were allowed time to consider
the study, and, because it was difficult to
predict uptake, two additional infants
participated in the control group (i.e.,
42 GDM group infants, 44 control in-
fants). Seventy-six infants attended the
second assessment. Ten infants did not
attend because of illness (n = 4), because
of travel (n = 3), or because the family no
longer wished to participate (n = 3). The
second scan was unsuccessful in three
infants. Therefore, complete MRI data
at the first and second assessments
were obtained for 86 and 73 infants, re-
spectively. Spectroscopy was performed
at the end of the magnetic resonance se-
quence and was not obtained in a num-
ber of babies who woke or became
restless. Spectra were available in 79 in-
fants at assessment 1 and in 51 infants at
assessment 2.
Mothers with GDM had greater pre-
pregnancy BMI than mothers with nor-
mal glucose tolerance (Table 1). The
majority of women with GDM received
medical treatment (55%), as follows:
metformin (36%), insulin (5%), or a com-
bination of both (14%). HbA1c was avail-
able in 33 of 42 women with GDM. The
group had evidence of good glycemic
control with a mean (SD) third-trimester

 HbA1c level of 5.3% (0.3) (34.9 mmol/mol
[3.4]). GDM group infants were born
earlier than the control infants and
had a lower birth weight, but there was
no statistical difference in birth weight
SD score (SDS) between groups (Table
1). The SDS for weight, length, and OFC
was significantly lower in GDM group in-
fants at the first assessment, but was
similar to that of control infants at the
second assessment. Weight gain SDS
between birth and assessment 2 was
greater in the GDM group. The propor-
tions receiving exclusive or predominant
breast-feeding by the second assessment
were similar in the GDM and control
groups (Table 1).
At assessment 1, there were no signif-
icant differences between GDM and
control infants in unadjusted total AT
volume, AT distribution, or IHCL level
(Table 1). There were no differences in
compartmentalATvolumes(Supplemen-
tary Table 1). At assessment 2, total AT
volume was greater in GDM group in-
fants than in control infants (mean dif-
ference 247 cm3 [95% CI 56, 439], P =
0.01.) There were no significant differ-
ences in AT distribution or in IHCL level
between groups (Table 1). Greater AT
volumes were seen in GDM group in-
fants compared with control infants in
all compartments, though the differences
did not reach statistical significance for
abdominal deep subcutaneous orinternal
abdominal compartments (Supplementary
Table 1).
After adjustment for infant size (19),
there was no significant difference in
total AT volume between GDM and con-
trol group infants at assessment 1 (Table
2). Although several AT compartments
appeared greater in the GDM group,
there were no statistically significant dif-
ferences between groups for any of
the AT compartments (Supplementary
Table 2). At assessment 2, total AT vol-
ume was greater in GDM group infants
(mean difference 16.0% [95% CI 6.0,
27.1], P = 0.002), and the change in total
AT volume between assessments was

Early Adiposity in Infants of Mothers With GDM
Diabetes Care Volume 39, June 2016
 greater in GDM group infants compared
with control infants (mean difference):
35.8% [95% CI 11.7, 65.2], P = 0.003)
(Table 2). All AT compartments were
greater in GDM group infants, although
the differenceinthe abdominal deep sub-
cutaneous compartment was not statisti-
cally significant (Supplementary Table 2).
There was no interaction detected be-
tween maternal GDM status and infant
sex for any outcome at either assess-
ment. After adjustment for infant sex
and maternal prepregnancy BMI, the re-
sults of comparisons between GDM and
control groups at the first and second
assessments were relatively unchanged
(Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).
Sensitivity analyses in women with nor-
mal prepregnancy BMI and in Caucasian
infants did not significantly alter the re-
sults; the total AT volume at assessment
2 remained statistically greater in GDM
group infants after adjustment for po-
tential confounders.
CONCLUSIONS
We show that adiposity in infants of
mothers with GDM appears to be am-
plified in early infancy. GDM group in-
fants had on average 16% greater total
AT volume compared with control in-
fants by 2 months of age, despite no
significant difference soon after birth.
To the best of our knowledge, this is a
novel observation. The increase in adi-
posity was not accompanied by altered
AT distribution or IHCL content. These
conclusions remain robust to adjust-
ment for maternal prepregnancy BMI,
supporting an independent effect of
GDM on infant adiposity.
The strengths of our study included
the use of a direct method to accurately
quantify total and compartmental AT
volume, with adequate power to de-
tect differences likely to be clinically rel-
evant in a relatively small number of
infants. A further strength was the lon-
gitudinal design, enabling assessment of
the evolution of adiposity in early in-
fancy. Differences in total and compart-
mental AT volumes at 8–12 weeks of age
were consistent after adjustment for
confounders and in sensitivity analyses,
leading to increased confidence in the
findings.
A limitation of our study was that we
did not examine for the effect of pre-
existing diabetes on offspring adiposity.
However, the metabolic effects of expo-
sure to diabetes in utero appear to be
similar regardless of diabetes type (21).
Our study was also not designed to en-
able the exploration of intrauterine and
genetic influences, but sibling compari-
son studies (3,4) strongly support an in-
trauterine effect that is independent of
genetic predisposition.
The finding of similar total AT volume
in infants with GDM and control infants
in the early newborn period contrasts
with the greater adiposity in infants of
mothers with diabetes identified in
some previous studies (7,22,23), but is
in keeping with results from two other
recent studies (24,25). It is possible
that strict maternal glucose control in
our cohort may have attenuated any
between-group neonatal differences. An
Australian study (24), using air displace-
ment plethysmography, reported similar
body fat percentages in the infants of
mothers with and without GDM. The
authors attributed this to good mater-
nal glucose control, with a mean third-
trimester HbA1c level for the group of
5.4%, which is similar to that in our study.
In contrast with our study, longitudinal
data were not obtained. Brumbaugh
et al. (25) also used air displacement
plethysmography to measure body fat
percentage, with similar findings. In addi-
tion, the authors (25) measured two AT
compartments using MRI (defined as
intra-abdominal or subcutaneous fat),
and reported similar volumes in infants
of mothers with GDM and control infants,
but acknowledged a limited power to de-
tect differences. Our results corroborate
these findings of similar AT distribution in
an adequately powered cohort. Intrigu-
ingly, and in contrast with our own study,
Brumbaugh et al. (25) found IHCL levels to
be greater in infants of mothers with
GDM. However, they estimated IHCL levels
without adjustment for intrahepatic wa-
ter and studied only 20 infants. The treat-
ment of maternal GDM and glycemic
control were not described, and explora-
tion of the relative influences of mater-
nal GDM and obesity was not possible
because all mothers with GDM were
obese (prepregnancy BMI .30 kg/m2)
(25). The differences they report in IHCL
levels may relate to maternal obesity,
because maternal BMI is positively cor-
related with IHCL level in infants (20).
The International Association of Di-
abetes and Pregnancy Study Groups
proposed new criteria for universal
screening for maternal GDM in 2010
(26). In a large Spanish study, these cri-
teria resulted in significantly improved

 pregnancy outcomes, including a reduced
risk of large-for-gestational-age infants
(27). Two randomized controlled trials
demonstrated reduced birth weight (28)
and neonatal fat mass (29) with treat-
ment of mild GDM. Although differences
may exist in our study population and the
criteria used to diagnose GDM, our find-
ings support the concept that more strin-
gent screening and treatment strategies
for GDM may attenuate the differences in
adiposity between infants of mothers
with GDM and those without GDM at
birth. Of note, there is evidence that ben-
efits may not persist beyond the newborn
period, as follow-up studies (30,31) have
not shown a reduction in early childhood
obesity with treatment. The later devel-
opment of obesity in childhood might be
considered to be due to exposure to an
obesogenic environment rather than to a
direct effect of maternal diabetes; how-
ever, our study suggests that this is un-
likely to be the case because differences
in adiposity between GDM and control
infants emerge early in infancy during
the period of breast-feeding.
We identified a striking difference in to-
tal AT volume in GDM group infants com-
pared with control infants by 10 weeks.
This was particularly notable because
greater adiposity was not accompanied
by discernible differences in body weight
or length, although GDM group infants
demonstrated rapid weight gain, which is
itself a risk for greater adiposity in child-
hood (32). This appeared to occur as a re-
sult of greater AT deposition. Our study
was not powered to detect small differ-
ences in regional AT compartments, and
it is possible that GDM infants had subtle
differences in AT from birth, which may
have evolved in early infancy. What is re-
markable is the extent to which total AT
differed by the second assessment. The
mechanisms that lead to increased adipos-
ity in infants of mothers with GDM in early
infancy merit consideration. One possible
explanation is that intrauterine or neona-
tal exposure to an excess of nutrients may
alter hypothalamic sensing, leading to al-
terations in satiety and appetite (33,34).
Another potential mechanism for the dif-
ferences described concerns differences in
breast milk composition. The proportion
of breast-fed infants in our study was sim-
ilar in both groups. It has been suggested
(35) that neonatal ingestion of breast milk
from mothers with diabetes may increase
the risk of overweight in early childhood.
Breast milk alterations, including higher
glucose concentration, have been dem-
onstrated in mothers with type 1 diabe-
tes, which may influence infant body
composition (36,37). The exploration of
breast milk composition in mothers with
GDM has been limited, and an examina-
tion of the relationship among GDM sta-
tus, breast milk composition, and infant
adiposity may provide further insight.
The relative contributions of mater-
nal BMI and diabetes on offspring adi-
posity remain uncertain (4,5). The HAPO
group found that both maternal GDM
(diagnosed post hoc using International
Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy
Study Groups criteria) and, to a lesser
extent, maternal obesity are indepen-
dently associated with newborn adipos-
ity, and that their combination has a
greater impact than either alone (38).
We found that differences in adiposity
between GDM and control groups at 10
weeks were slightly attenuated after ad-
justment for maternal prepregnancy
BMI. Our findings support an indepen-
dent effect of maternal GDM on infant
adiposity, with a lesser contribution from
maternal prepregnancy BMI.
In conclusion, in this contemporary
predominantly breast-fed cohort with
good glycemic control in pregnancy, we
demonstrate that infants of mothers with
GDM have significantly greater total AT
volume at 2–3 months of age compared
with control infants. This is particularly
strikinggiventhattherewasnosignificant
difference in total adiposity at birth. This
indicates, first, that careful control of
GDM may not be sufficient to ameliorate
the effects of maternal GDM on later in-
fant health and, second, that this may be
mediated by excess adiposity. Because
adiposity appears to track from infancy
into childhood (39), this is a plausible har-
binger of longer-term risks to health. We
suggest that a key research priority is to
examine the evolution of early infancy
adiposityinto childhood and the potential
effects on metabolic health in the off-
spring of mothers with GDM. Reduction
in postnatal adiposity may be a therapeu-
tic target to break the cycle of increasing
population obesity and related complica-
tions, including type 2 diabetes.
