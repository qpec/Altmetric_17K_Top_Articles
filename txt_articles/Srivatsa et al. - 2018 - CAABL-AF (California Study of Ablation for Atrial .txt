BACKGROUND: Ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is superior to medical 
therapy for rhythm control. We compared stroke and mortality among 
patients undergoing ablation for AF to matched controls in a large 
multiethnic population.
METHODS: Using discharge and surgical records from California 
nonfederal hospitals, we identified patients who had ablation and 
principal diagnosis of AF with at least 1 prior hospitalization for AF. We 
excluded cases with valve disease, open maze, other arrhythmias, or 
implantable devices. Matched controls were selected based on years of 
AF diagnosis, age, sex, and being alive the same number of days from 
the initial AF encounter to the ablation date. Clinical outcomes, including 
mortality, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke, were assessed using a 
weighted proportional hazard model, adjusting for demographics, prior 
admissions with AF before the ablation, calendar year, and presence of 
chronic comorbidities.
RESULTS: There were 4169 ablation cases and 4169 weighted-matched 
controls; 39% percent of the ablation group was >65 years, 72% men, 
84% white; mean follow-up was up to 3.6±0.9 years. In adjusted models, 
ablation was associated with significantly lower mortality (per patient-
years) 0.9% versus 1.9%, hazard ratio=0.59 (P<0.0001; confidence 
interval: 0.45–0.77); ischemic stroke (>30 days post-ablation ≤5 years), 
0.37% versus 0.59%, hazard ratio=0.68 (P=0.04; confidence interval: 
0.47–0.97); hemorrhagic stroke 0.11% versus 0.35%, hazard ratio=0.36 
(P=0.001; confidence interval: 0.20–0.64) compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of hospitalized 
patients with nonvalvular AF, ablation was associated with lower mortality, 
ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke compared with controls.

hythm control of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF) using antiarrhythmic drugs has moderate 
success in maintaining sinus rhythm.1 Randomized 
controlled trials have demonstrated improved quality of 
life and enhanced symptom control with drug therapy 
but have not demonstrated improved survival.2–4 The 
findings have been attributed to possible deleterious 
effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. Therefore, nonphar-
macological management strategies to maintain sinus 
rhythm have been touted as potentially superior to im-
prove survival in this population. Ablation is an invasive 
management in which energy sources, such as radio-
frequency or cryoenergy, are used to create necrosis of 
myocardial cells that trigger or perpetuate the arrhyth-
mia. Ablation was reported to eliminate spontaneous 
premature atrial complexes from pulmonary veins that 
trigger AF.5,6 The procedure is generally considered safe, 
but it does have short-term complications,7,8 therefore 
it is recommended for patients with symptomatic AF 
refractory to medical therapy.9
Randomized trials comparing ablation and medi-
cal therapy have shown improved rhythm control with 
ablation when 1 drug has failed, equivalent to drug 
therapy as a first line management, and improvement 
in quality of life.10–12 Observational and registry data 
also have demonstrated increased event-free survival 
defined as nonrecurrent AF >30 seconds after abla-
tion compared with medical management strategy.13,14 
However, most of these investigations are from single 
centers with small numbers of patients.
Improved survival and reduced incidence of stroke 
after ablation have been shown in a Swedish abla-
tion registry compared with medical therapy,14 and 
improved survival was reported in a small study of 
ablation patients with AF and heart failure when com-
pared with amiodarone.15 However, a meta-analysis 
of randomized trials fails to show survival benefit or 
reduced stroke compared with drug therapy.16 Recent-
ly, a propensity-matched analysis of patients who 
underwent ablation from Israel reveals an improved 
stroke and mortality.17
Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of abla-
tion to improve survival and reduce stroke compared 
with matched controls in a large multiethnic California 
population among patients previously hospitalized for 
NVAF.
METHODS
Date Source
State of California mandates nonfederal hospitals to report 
all hospitalizations, including emergency department visits 
and ambulatory surgical encounters to Office of Statewide 
Health Planning and Development. Serial records of an indi-
vidual can be linked to an encrypted form of social security 
number called record linkage number. This can be associated 
with master death registry. The strength of this comprehen-
sive database is that the events occurring for any individual 
in any nonfederal California hospital can be identified. The 
original data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning 
and Development is subject to the Institutional Review Board 
and cannot be shared; however, the derived programmed 
nonidentifiable data, analytic methods, and study materials 
can be made available to other researchers for purposes of 
reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.
Selection of Patients
After obtaining approval by the State of California Committee 
for the Protection of Human Subjects, and the University of 
California Davis institutional review board, we identified 
patients with ambulatory surgery encounters for ablation 
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision: 37.34) 
between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013, associ-
ated with principal diagnosis of AF (427.31) in California non-
federal hospitals from Office of Statewide Health Planning 
and Development. Because ablation code is not unique, we 
excluded those with diagnostic codes for supraventricular 
tachycardia (427.0), ventricular tachycardia (427.1), parox-
ysmal atrial tachycardia (427.2), premature beats (427.6, 
427.61), other premature ventricular complexes (427.69), 
anomalous atrioventricular excitation (426.7), and atrio-
ventricular nodal reentry (427.89). To select only those who 
underwent catheter-based ablation, we excluded those with 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for 
open surgical ablation (37.33). Because patients with NVAF 
could have atrioventricular node ablation, all cases that had 
pacemaker/defibrillator implant (37.80–37.87) were excluded.
Other exclusion criteria include valvular heart disease, 
dementia, human immunodeficiency disease, alcohol abuse, 
active cancer, or psychosis. Patients in the ablation group had 
to have a prior hospital encounter with a diagnosis of AF 
before the ablation admission. The first such AF encounter 
(dated back to 1991) was referred to as the index-AF encoun-
ter, and the date of ablation was the study date (SDT).
Selection of Matched Controls
No-ablation controls were selected based on matching (5: 1 
weighted, providing equal number of cases and controls) by 
WHAT IS KNOWN?
• Rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs have 
not shown improved survival.
• Ablation improves rhythm control reducing 
requirement of antiarrhythmic drugs.
• Smaller registry data from homogeneous popu-
lation reveal reduced mortality and stroke after 
exclusion of periprocedural complications.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS?
• Results are reported from multiple centers in het-
erogeneous population from California.
• Ablation reduces mortality, ischemic stroke, and 
hemorrhagic stroke.

age (±3 years), sex, year of index-AF diagnosis, the pattern 
of health-facility encounters before ablation, and number 
of hospitalizations. Because the duration of AF has been 
shown to be a significant factor in recurrence of AF after 
ablation, we matched patients for (1) pattern of interven-
ing hospitalizations between onset of AF and time of abla-
tion/study date, and (2) duration of AF before study date. 
For the no-ablation controls, an SDT was assigned equal to 
the same number of days observed between the index-AF 
encounter date and the ablation procedure encounter date 
for each ablation case. We reviewed ≈200 hospital records 
to verify that the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 
cases undergoing ablation only for AF.
Comorbidities were defined using the Elixhauser index 
(Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project V3.7), which identi-
fies 29 major chronic conditions, including all the major risk 
factors for AF, occurring before the SDT.18 The 3 prespecified 
clinical outcomes diagnosed after the date of the ablation 
were death, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke.
Statistical Analyses
Randomized control trials are optimal to assess treatment 
effect without the confounding effect of comorbidities. 
However, because of low rate of clinical outcomes, such a 
study requires large number of patients incurring a huge 
cost. Propensity matching has been a surrogate in retrospec-
tive observational studies for causal inference. Although the 
use of propensity matching leads to minimal differences in 
the probability of specified exposures, it can exclude up to 
60% of patients, thus significantly reducing the size of the 
study cohorts (=power).19 Studies have compared the 2 meth-
ods (propensity score versus simple multivariable regression), 
and the finding have shown no significant difference in the 
strength or statistical significance of associations between 
exposure and outcomes and that weighted matching method 
performs well when avoiding loss of data.20–22 This method 
also eliminates the real-world outcomes of patients treated 
in either group. Because majority of the patients with NVAF 
have similar comorbidities, regression model can be used 
to study treatment effect in all patients undergoing abla-
tion. Weighted matching can be applied to data sets with 
many common characteristics. We used the Kernel-weighted 
matching that averages the covariate parameters from mul-
tiple individuals in the control group (5: 1) to each treated 
individual, thereby reducing the variance of any imbalance.19
Outcomes in the ablation and no-ablation controls were 
analyzed using a weighted proportional hazard regression 
model with follow-up to December 31, 2013, adjusting for 
number of prior admission with heart failure, and number of 
prior admissions with AF admissions before the date of the 
ablation, calendar year, presence of specific chronic comor-
bidities, and demographics. Differences between the cases 
and controls were assessed using log-rank test, and a P<0.05 
was considered significant. All comorbidities present at the 
SDT were individually included and forced in the regression 
model. SAS version 9.3 was used for all statistical analyses. 
Continuous variables were expressed as mean±SD. Categorical 
variables were presented as percentages. Univariate analysis 
was performed with a χ2 test for nominal variables, t test for 
continuous variables, and Fisher exact test was applied for 
outcomes <5 events per cell. Kaplan–Meier method was used

We identified patients who had ablation and a principal diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients were selected after exclusion criteria were applied and matched 
to patients with prior hospitalization for AF but did not undergo ablation.

to analyze survival rates for mortality, ischemic stroke, and 
hemorrhagic stroke.
RESULTS
As shown in Figure 1, there were 13 
758 patients from 
97 nonfederal hospitals who underwent ablation but 
only 4169 met all inclusion criteria, which comprised 
a prior encounter with a diagnosis of AF and no other 
indication for ablation. This group was compared with 
4169 weighted-matched controls, and mean follow-
up time was up to 3.6±0.9 years. Baseline character-
istics were well matched for age and sex; majority of 
the patients (>60%) were <65 years, and >70% were 
men (Table 1). More patients in ablation group were 
whites (84.1% versus 73.2%; P<0.001), had hyperten-
sion (58.1% versus 51.1%; P<0.001), and a margin-
ally significant higher prior stroke or transient ischemic 
attack incidence (4.7% versus 3.5%; P=0.05); Fewer 
ablation cases had peripheral vascular disease, chronic 
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, liv-
er disease, coagulopathy, and coronary artery disease 
(Table 1; P<0.01). Patients in ablation group were more 
likely to be hospitalized at least once within 2 years 
before the SDT (81.1% versus 77.4%; P<0.0001), but 
there was no difference in the frequency of hospitaliza-
tion 2 years or more before this date. (2.55 in ablation 
versus 2.62 in no-ablation; P=nonsignificant).
Clinical Outcomes
In the ablation group, 5 patients died within 30 days 
(mean, 29.8±1.3 days) of ablation versus 3 in control 
group; mortality >30 days occurred in 84 patients in 
ablation group versus 189 in control group. After mul-
tivariate analysis, there was no difference in mortality in 
the periprocedural period (mean, 29.8±1.3 days; 1.8% 
versus 1.1% person-years; hazard ratio [HR]=3.17; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.6–17.9; P=nonsignificant); 
ablation was associated with lower 30-day to 5-year 
(mean, 2.8±1.0 years) mortality (0.9% versus 2% per-
son-years; HR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.43–0.74; P<0.0001; 
Table 2; Figure 2A) compared with control group.
Ischemic stroke <30 days occurred in 12 patients 
versus 5, and ischemic stroke >30 days occurred in 
55 versus 86 in ablation and control groups, respec-
tively. After adjustment, periprocedural ischemic stroke 
(mean, 29.9±1.0 days) was not different between abla-
tion and control groups 3.5% versus 1.5% person-
years (HR=2.44; 95% CI: 0.8–7.5; P=nonsignificant), 
however it was lower in ablation cohort during 30-day 
to 5-year follow-up (mean, 3.5±0.9 years; 0.37% ver-
sus 0.59% person-years [HR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.47–0.97; 
P=0.04]; Table 2; Figure 2B).
Hemorrhagic stroke <30 days after the ablation date 
occurred in 1 ablation patient versus 2 controls, and 
hemorrhagic stroke >30 days occurred in 17 ablation 
patients versus 53 in control group. After adjustment, 
periprocedural hemorrhagic stroke (mean, 29.9±0.8 
days) was nonsignificantly lower in ablation cohort, 
0.29% versus 0.58% person-years (HR=0.35; 95% 
CI:0.01–10.68; P=nonsignificant), but it was signifi-
cantly lower in ablation group between 30 days and 5 
years (mean, 3.6±0.9 years) with 0.11% versus 0.36% 
person-years (HR=0.36; 95% CI: 0.2–0.64; P=0.001; 
Table 2; Figure 2C) compared with controls.
DISCUSSION
The main findings in the current study include long-term 
reduction in mortality, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic 
stroke in ablation group compared with controls. More 
patients in the ablation group were white, had more 
frequent recent hospitalization, hypertension, and prior 
strokes; however, other comorbidities were lower than 
the control cohort. The mortality (0.001%) and ischemic 
stroke (0.003%) among all those who underwent abla-
tion were low within 30 days of the procedure, confirm-
ing the safety of the procedure and were not significant-
ly different from the control group. After adjustment of

all comorbidities, using proportional hazard modeling, 
we found significant reduction in long-term mortality, 
ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in the ablation 
group. We do not have data on anticoagulants pre-
scribed for these patients, but our results suggest that 
current practice of management supports use of abla-
tion for improved outcomes. Decreased incidence of 
ischemic stroke could be related to reduced AF episodes 
and reduced hemorrhagic stroke to a reduced require-
ment for anticoagulation. We do not have data on anti-
coagulation management or rhythm assessment and 
therefore cannot determine the reasons for this benefit.
Unique Features of Our Study
The strength of our study is inclusion of all patients 
undergoing ablation for NVAF in several hospitals 
during the study period in a multiethnic popula-
tion. The current study includes only patients who 
had prior hospitalization for NVAF; those with first 
hospital encounter for ablation of AF were excluded 
because the latter likely represent healthier patients 
and would not be equivalent to control patients. In 
addition, results are reported in patient-years because 
this incorporates time element to the event rate over 
the follow-up period.
Previous Randomized Trials and Registry 
Studies
Antiarrhythmic drugs for management of NVAF have 
been investigated in SAFE-T (Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial 
Fibrillation Efficacy Trial), RACE (Rate Control Versus 
Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation

Study), and AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Inves-
tigation of Rhythm Management) trials1,3,23 and were 
shown to be efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm 
and improving quality of life,24 however, ineffective in 
reducing mortality or stroke. Randomized trials and reg-
istry data comparing ablation and medical therapy have 
shown improved rhythm control with invasive strategy 
compared with antiarrhythmic drugs.10–14 Because of 
the low clinical event rates, a large randomized trial 
or registry data are required to compare mortality and 
stroke in ablation versus controls treated medically. 
Because ablation is invasive, the periprocedural com-
plications could affect long-term end points. In our 
previous observation study from California nonfederal 
hospitals, we reported a low rate of periprocedural 
mortality and stroke, and these events are related to 
age, heart failure, and prior stroke,7 which is confirmed 
in the current study.
In the large Swedish registry that compared ablation 
to medical therapy,14 the ablation cohort had improved 
survival and reduced stroke, similar to our results. In 
this study, propensity-matched groups of likely all white 
population were compared; however, patients who 
died within 30 days of procedure were excluded. Our 
study differs from this study by the inclusion of all races, 
outcomes, including perioperative period, and the sta-
tistical method. In the Israeli study, a similar propensity-
matching method with inverse weighting was used. In 
the latter study, all individuals had primary diagnosis of 
AF; however, other arrhythmias or implantable defibril-
lators were not excluded. They also reported higher 
event rates and unequal person-year follow-up duration 
between case and control groups. Propensity matching 
is an alternate method of analysis to derive data retro-
spectively as close to a randomized trial. However, this 
eliminates unmatched patients who could alter the rate 
of the actual outcomes in the population. Similarly, in 
the propensity-matched study by Reynolds et al,25 from 
the Marketscan research database, there was a reduc-
tion in stroke in the ablation group. In our sample, we 
found higher hypertension in ablation group but other 
comorbidities in the control group. To obtain real-world 
outcomes and to understand ablation referral patterns, 
we chose to do multiple regression analysis, which is 
also the expertise in our team.
Similarly, studies by Pappone et al13 and Bunch et 
al26 also revealed improved survival with ablation. The 
early report of Pappone et al13 differs from ours on 
being a single-center study from Italy, therefore not 
generalizable to our multiethnic population. Bunch 
et al26 described a multiple hospital-based observa-
tional investigation with 2 control groups, one a group 
of patients with AF treated medically and the other 
patients without AF. The mortality rate noted at 1 
year in this study was high in nonablated AF patients 
at 16% versus 3% in ablation group. Consistent with 
their population, our ablation group had higher pro-
portion of patients with hypertension. Unlike this 
investigation, our study excluded ambulatory patients 
with AF, used 1:5 weighted-matched controls provid-
ing equal number in case and control groups, has a 
longer follow-up, and reveals a lower mortality in a 
time-sensitive outcome rate.
However, in a meta-analysis of randomized trials 
from 1990 to 2014 by Zheng et al,16 the authors failed 
to show survival benefit or reduced stroke compared 
with drug therapy. In another study with a smaller 
number of patients by Chang et al27 from Taiwan, there 
was a reduction in stroke, but not mortality in patients 
treated by ablation. The smaller number of patients in 
these studies compared with our study and the afore-
mentioned investigations could potentially explain the 
lack of demonstrable survival benefit.
Enhanced survival regardless of rhythm apprais-
al in the ablation arm provides paradigm shift in our 
approach to ablation. This could potentially be attrib-
uted to improved physical activity, cardiac function,15 
and reduced stroke. Our low event rates likely reflect a 
need for a large number of patients to show benefits of 
ablation in a randomized trial and that this procedure is 
likely to improve survival and reduce stroke in this pop-
ulation if performed in centers with experience and low 
procedural complications regardless of rhythm control.
Limitations
This study is a retrospective investigation with the inher-
ent limitations of that method. There is no International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code specif-
ic for AF ablation; therefore, our method of analysis 
depends on correct coding noted in the methods sec-
tion, but the validity of the data is supported by periodic 
audits performed for billing purposes in most hospitals. 
We have also reviewed sample charts to ensure accu-
racy of exclusion and inclusion criteria. We may have 
missed patients who have a clinical outcome outside 
California. Our study period ended in 2013; since then, 
there have been advances in ablation strategies, which 
could have changed the event rates, however this is the 
latest available data from Office of Statewide Health 
Planning and Development database from California. 
Finally, we do not have access to the actual rhythm and 
drugs used for treatment of the patients before and 
after ablation. Prospective randomized trial of catheter 
ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy (CABANA 
NCT00911508) is likely provide outcome data without 
such limitations.
Conclusions
In this large population-based, matched multivariate 
analysis of hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of NVAF

undergoing ablation, the risk of adverse outcomes after 
ablation was lower for death, ischemic stroke, and hem-
orrhagic stroke than observed in nonablated patients.
