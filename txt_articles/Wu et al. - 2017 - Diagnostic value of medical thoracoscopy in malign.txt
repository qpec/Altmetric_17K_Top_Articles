Abstract
Background: Medical thoracoscopy has been shown to be an efficacious procedure in diagnosing unexplained
exudative pleural effusions with excellent safety. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic significance of thoracoscopy
in the management of patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
Methods: Consecutive patients with malignant pleural effusion were retrospectively reviewed, and their demographic,
radiographic, thoracoscopic and histological data were collected.
Results: Between July 2005 and June 2014, 342 of 833 patients undergoing thoracoscopy were finally confirmed to
suffer from MPE. The top three frequent causes of MPE were metastatic carcinoma (79.5%), malignant mesothelioma
(10.2%), and lymphoma (2.9%). Among metastatic malignancies, the most common cancer was lung cancer (85.2%),
followed by breast cancer (4.4%), ovarian cancer (2.2%), pancreatic cancer (1.8%), etc. No serious adverse events
associated with thoracoscopy were recorded.
Conclusions: Medical thoracoscopy is a valuable and safe tool in diagnosing malignant pleural effusion with minimal
complication rates.

Background
The identification of malignant cells in a pleural lavage
in patients without pleural effusion suggests micrometa-
static disease, and our previous meta-analysis [1] showed
that positive pleural lavage cytological findings are asso-
ciated with a higher recurrence rate and significant
poorer survival, with the overall hazard ratio for patients
having malignant cells in pleural lavage was 5.61 (95%
confidence interval 3.98–7.90). In non-small-cell lung
cancer
patients,
the
evidence
of
even
a
minimal
pleural effusion at diagnosis is an independent prog-
nostic factor for worse survival [2]. Malignant pleural
effusion (MPE) is frequently observed in multiple ma-
lignancies, and lung cancer is the most common
cause [3]. The existence of MPE in patients indicates
systemic dissemination of cancer and declining in life
expectancy and quality [4, 5].
The current guideline recommended that thoracent-
esis and/or closed pleural biopsy can be used as the first
diagnostic steps in the diagnosis of MPE [6]. However,
these procedures usually do not work when pleural effu-
sion with thickness less than 10 mm on chest computed
tomography (CT) scans. Instead, the more invasive ap-
proaches, such as medical thoracoscopy (MT), can be
considered to identify whether pleural biopsy contains
malignant cells [3, 7]. As a matter of fact, MT is a highly
sensitive and safe method for diagnosing exudative
pleural effusions [8–10]. The recent developed semi-
rigid MT is easy to use and can gain popularity among
respiratory physicians who are accustomed to flexible
bronchoscope [11, 12].
In the present retrospective study of patients with
MPE having undergone at least one semi-rigid MT over
a 9-year period in a Chinese 1600-bed general hospital,
we analyzed the diagnostic efficiency and safety of MT
in the diagnosis of MPE.

 Methods
The study protocol and ethical approval was approved
by the Institutional Review Board for human studies of
Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, China. Informed consents
were not required as this was considered a review of
clinical practice.
Information including medical history, clinical presen-
tation, laboratory examination results, and image data of
unexplained exudative pleural effusions patients who
underwent MT in our hospital between July 2005 and
June 2014 were gathered, and only MPE patients were fi-
nally included in the current study. Unexplained exuda-
tive pleural effusions were defined as the patients
underwent the initial diagnostic approaches including
thoracentesis and/or closed pleural biopsy, and their dis-
eases remain undiagnosed. The characteristics of the
study population are listed in Table 1.
MT procedures have been described in our previous
publications [13, 14]. The diagnosis of MPE was estab-
lished by the presence of the positive findings for malig-
nancy in pleural biopsy.
Descriptive statistical methods were used in the data
analysis (mean ± standard deviation [SD] or/and range).
Results
Between July 2005 and June 2014, 833 patients with un-
diagnosed pleural effusions successfully underwent med-
ical thoracoscopy [15]. Eventually, 342 patients with
lymphocytic exudates were finally diagnosed with MPE;
the mean age was 62.8 ± 9.7 years.
For 149 MPE patients, pleural fluid occurred only in the
right side, for 133 only in the left, and for the rest 60 both
sides were involved (Table 1). The size of a pleural effusion
was clarified as small, moderate, or large based on CT im-
aging according to the methods described by Moy and
colleagues [16]. In both unilateral and bilateral effusion,
the proportions of small, moderate, and large size of
pleural effusions were 16.7, 12.9, and 70.4%, respectively.
The appearance of pleural effusion was blood-stained in
55.9% of patients, and in 44.1% was yellow.
In addition to pleural effusion, CT imaging revealed
mediastinal and hilum lymphadenopathy, pleural thick-
ening, pulmonary consolidation or infiltration, pulmon-
ary mass or nodules, pulmonary atelectasis, and pleural
nodularity (Table 1).
In all patients studied, we observed one or more abnor-
malities on the surface of parietal or/and visceral pleura
under medical thoracoscopy. As shown in Table 2, pleural
nodules, hyperemia, pleural adhesion, pleural plaques, ulcer,
and the other pleural pathological changes were observed.
The most common etiological causes of MPE were
metastatic carcinomas (n = 272), pleural malignant
mesothelioma (n = 35), lymphoma (n = 10). It should be
mentioned that we could not identify the original malig-
nancies in 25 patients with MPE (Table 3). Among meta-
static malignancies that resulted in MPE, the most
common cancer included lung cancer, followed by breast
cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer (Table 4).
No serious adverse events were observed, and transient
chest pain (43.9%) induced by the indwelling chest tube
was the most frequent minor complication. Subcutaneous

 emphysema was found in 8.5% of patients who recovered
after chest-tube drainage. Minor bleeding was recorded in
6.4% of patients. And 5.6% of patients appeared with tran-
sient self-limited fever (38 °C or more).
Discussion
Because the prognosis for patients with MPE is poor, an
efficacious procedure that can establish a definite diag-
nosis as early as possible with a minimum of risk and
discomfort would be highly desirable. If a patient with
undiagnosed pleural effusion is suspected as malignant,
cytologic examination of pleural fluid is the first recom-
mendation [6]. Although repeated thoracenteses can en-
hance the sensitivity of cytology, it is usually only 50 to
70% [17]. When cytology fails, closed percutaneous nee-
dle biopsy was traditionally performed blindly by an
Abrams or Ramel needle [18–20]. Nevertheless, its role
in diagnosing MPE has been challenged, as the positive
diagnostic rate of closed pleural biopsy was only about
50% [21, 22]. More recently, the real time image-guided
pleural biopsy has been shown to be a promising pro-
cedure for sampling the pleura, since it can increase the
sensitivity for diagnosing MPE to about 80% [21, 23–25].
Numerous tumor markers have been intensively exam-
ined for improving the diagnosis of MPE, however, seek-
ing for a highly accurate pleural fluid tumor marker that
reliably diagnoses MPE has been in vain so far [26].
Using one tumor marker alone for diagnosing MPE is
not recommend according to the recent evidences, how-
ever, when combined two or more tumor markers to-
gether, the diagnostic sensitivity seems to be improved
[27, 28]. The diagnostic performance of tumor markers
for MPE seems to be similar with conventional tests in-
cluding cytological examination–high specificity and low
sensitivity. Tumor markers are less important in prac-
tice, since they do not complement the properties of
conventional tests.
CT- or ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies are quite sen-
sitive and safe, with the only reported complications being
local hematoma and minor hemoptysis [21, 29]. The limi-
tation of the image-guided pleural biopsy is the blindness
of the procedure. MT overcomes this problem by allowing
for the visualization of abnormal areas and for a direct
biopsy, and thus improves the diagnostic accuracy of
pleural effusions [8, 9]. Since June 2005, our institution
started using MT as a routine method for patients with
undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion in cases when ei-
ther clinical, radiologic, laboratory, or cytologic investiga-
tion was failed. During a period of 9 years, 833 patients
with unexplained pleural effusions underwent MT suc-
cessfully, and among them, 342 were eventually diagnosed
with MPE [15].
One or more abnormalities on the surface of parietal or/
and visceral pleura were observed in the whole population
in this study, including pleural nodules, hyperemia, pleural
adhesion, pleural plaques, ulcer, and the other pleural
pathological changes. Pathological examination revealed
the presence of the positive findings for malignancy in
pleural biopsy in 342 patients. The data in detail presented
in the current study derived from our whole MT study
population [15]. As reported in the previous publication
[15], after a complete work-up including MT biopsies, the
definite diagnoses of 92.6% (771/833) of patients with
pleural effusions can be established definitely by MT
followed by histopathological study.
It was noted that no etiological causes of pleural effu-
sions can be identified in 7.4% (62/833) of patients even
after MT [15]. All of these patients were followed up for

 at least 12 months, and did not complain about a new
pleural effusion. No diagnosis other than benign pleural
effusion was found in these 62 patients. Several studies
suggest that among the patients with histological diagnosis
of non-specific pleurisy made after MT, 8.3–18% of them
were eventually diagnosed with MPE, usually pleural
mesothelioma,
during
long
term
follow-up
[30–32].
Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that a few
patients with MPE-negative MT results would be finally
diagnosed with MPE if we prolong the follow-up.
It has been reported that carcinoma from any organ
can metastasize to the pleura, but lung, and breast car-
cinomas and lymphomas are the most common causes,
digestive and ovary carcinomas are less frequent [33].
Our recent unpublished data indicated that during the
past 3 years, 23.7% (365/1541) of pleural effusion pa-
tients admitted to our hospital were diagnosed with
MPE. In the present study, our data showed that the
most common etiological causes of MPE confirmed by
MT were metastatic carcinomas, and followed by pleural
malignant mesothelioma, lymphoma, and the other ma-
lignancies. Among metastatic malignancies that resulted
in MPE, the most common cancer was lung cancer,
followed by breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic
cancer.
MT has an excellent safety profile when performed by a
trained physician, and a mortality rate associated with MT
is always ≤0.8% [34]. A recent meta-analysis further sug-
gested that mortality associated with MT was not ob-
served, and that the major complication rate of MT was
1.5% and the minor complication rate was 10.5% [10]. In
our 9-year study, MT procedures were well tolerated with
a low rate of complications without serious adverse
events, and transient chest pain caused by the indwelling
chest tube was the most frequent minor complication.
Large volumes of pleural fluid could be safely aspirated, al-
though some patients suffered from coughing and chest
discomfort after lung re-expansion with a chest tube.
The strengthen of this study was that study population
was in a large size, in which 342 MPE patients were in-
cluded. At the same time, our study also had limitations.
First, as a retrospective study, it’s impossible to collect
and analyze the required data in a prospective way. Sec-
ond, we could only retrospectively reviewed the data
from patients with MPE, and no data from the other
control group, such as the patients with tuberculous
pleurisy, were available, it was therefore not possible to
calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MT in diagnos-
ing MPE. Third, blind needle biopsies or image-assisted
biopsies were performed only in a few patients before
undergoing MT in our series. This partially explained
why there were so many pleural effusion patients (833
cases) receiving MT examination in our institution dur-
ing 9 years.
Conclusions
In summary, MT is simple and safe with a high positive
rate in the diagnosis of MPE. Due to its convenience
and compatibility with existing bronchoscopy, MT ap-
pears to be a more widely performed procedure. Thus
MT should be performed actively for proper patients
with suspected MPE.
