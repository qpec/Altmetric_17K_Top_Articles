In Brief
Pontzer et al. examine total energy
expenditure and physical activity in a
large adult human sample. Rather than
increasing linearly with physical activity,
total energy expenditure plateaus above
moderate activity levels, suggesting that
the body adapts to higher activity levels
to keep total energy expenditure within a
relatively narrow range.

SUMMARY
Current obesity prevention strategies recommend
increasing daily physical activity, assuming that
increased activity will lead to corresponding in-
creases in total energy expenditure and prevent or
reverse energy imbalance and weight gain [1–3].
Such Additive total energy expenditure models are
supported by exercise intervention and accelerome-
try studies reporting positive correlations between
physical activity and total energy expenditure [4]
but are challenged by ecological studies in humans
and other species showing that more active popula-
tions do not have higher total energy expenditure
[5–8]. Here we tested a Constrained total energy
expenditure model, in which total energy expendi-
ture increases with physical activity at low activity
levels but plateaus at higher activity levels as the
body adapts to maintain total energy expenditure
within a narrow range. We compared total energy
expenditure, measured using doubly labeled water,
against physical activity, measured using accelerom-
etry, for a large (n = 332) sample of adults living in five
populations [9]. After adjusting for body size and
composition, total energy expenditure was positively
correlated with physical activity, but the relationship
was markedly stronger over the lower range of phys-
ical activity. For subjects in the upper range of phys-
ical activity, total energy expenditure plateaued,
supporting a Constrained total energy expenditure
model. Body fat percentage and activity intensity
appear to modulate the metabolic response to phys-
ical activity. Models of energy balance employed in
public health [1–3] should be revised to better reflect
the constrained nature of total energy expenditure
and the complex effects of physical activity on meta-
bolic physiology.
RESULTS
Models of Total Energy Expenditure and Physical
Activity
The metabolic costs and health benefits of physical activity are
well established [1, 2], but the long-term effect of physical activ-
ity on total daily energy requirements is far less certain. The
predominant view [1–3] assumes a dose-dependent and additive
effect of physical activity on total energy expenditure (kcal/day),
with each increment of physical activity leading to a correspond-
ing increase in total energy expenditure (Figure 1). This Additive
model is supported by studies showing positive correlations be-
tween total energy expenditure and accelerometry recordings of
physical activity [4]. Moreover, the Additive total energy expendi-
ture model of metabolic physiology has shaped public health
strategies to combat the global rise in obesity, which typically
propose increasing physical activity as a means to increase total
energy expenditure and achieve a healthy weight and maintain
energy balance [1–3].
A growing number of studies examining the long-term meta-
bolic effects of exercise suggest that the relationship between
physical activity and total energy expenditure is more complex
than Additive models allow [5]. Rather than increasing total en-
ergy expenditure linearly in response to physical activity, individ-
uals tend to adapt metabolically to increased physical activity,
muting the expected increase in daily energy throughput
[5, 10–12]. These metabolic changes can be behavioral, such
as sitting instead of standing, or fidgeting less, but they may
also include reductions in other, non-muscular metabolic activ-
ity. For example, men and women enrolled in a long-term exer-
cise study exhibited reduced basal metabolic rate at week 40
[11], and studies in healthy adult women have shown sup-
pressed ovarian activity and lower estrogen production in
response to moderate exercise [13]. Other species have also
410
Current Biology 26, 410–417, February 8, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
 been shown to keep total energy expenditure remarkably con-
stant in response to increased physical activity, reducing energy
expenditure on growth [14], somatic repair [15, 16], and basal
metabolic rate [17, 18] and even reducing lactation and cannibal-
izing nursing offspring [19], even when food is available ad libi-
tum and total energy expenditure is well within maximum
sustained levels [5, 14–19]. These observations are inconsistent
with Additive models; instead, they favor a Constrained total en-
ergy expenditure model [5] in which energy allocation among
physiological tasks responds dynamically to long-term shifts in
physical activity, adapting to maintain total energy expenditure
within some relatively narrow range (Figure 1).
Constrained total energy expenditure may explain the re-
markable degree of similarity in total energy expenditure among
populations across a broad range of lifestyles. People in less so-
cioeconomically developed populations, including subsistence
farmers and traditional hunter-gatherers, have total energy ex-
penditures similar to those in more developed populations
[6, 7] despite substantial differences in physical activity. Mam-
mals living in the wild, including non-human primate species,
have total energy expenditures similar to captive populations
[8]. These population-level comparisons suggest that total
energy expenditure is an evolved, species-specific trait that is
homeostatically buffered against variation in habitual physical
activity. It remains unclear, however, how the growing evidence
for metabolic adaptation and metabolic constraint can be recon-
ciled with accelerometry studies showing a positive correlation
between physical activity and total energy expenditure [4].
Missing from these comparisons is an ecological study of total
energy expenditure and physical activity collected simulta-
neously within a large, diverse sample, needed to characterize
the relationship between variation in habitual levels of physical
activity and total energy expenditure among individuals.
In this study, we evaluated Additive and Constrained total
energy expenditure models in a large (n = 332), mixed-sex
(55% female), adult (age 25–45 years) human sample [9] drawn
from five populations across Africa and North America (Ghana,
South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica, and United States; see Table
S1 for sample characteristics). Total energy expenditure was
measured using the doubly labeled water method. Resting meta-
bolic rate was measured via respirometry. Physical activity was
measured using wearable tri-axial accelerometers (reported as
mean counts per minute per day, CPM/d); surveys were used
to identify subjects employed in manual labor (Experimental Pro-
cedures). First, we used multivariate regression to examine the
effects of anthropometric variables, population location, and
physical activity on total energy expenditure and resting meta-
bolic rate. We then used residuals from a multiple regression
including anthropometrics and population location (Table 1,
model 2) to calculate adjusted total energy expenditure and
adjusted resting metabolic rate, and to investigate the relation-
ship between physical activity and these size- and population-
adjusted measures of expenditure.
Statistical Models of Total Energy Expenditure
Anthropometric measurements explained just over half of the
variation in total energy expenditure (df = 326, adjusted
r2 [adj. r2] = 0.52, p < 0.001; Table 1, model 1), with fat-free
mass the strongest single determinant. Adding a ‘‘study site’’
term to the model marginally improved the fit (df = 322, adj.
r2 = 0.55, p < 0.001; Table 1, model 2). Measures of physical
activity (accelerometer CPM/d and manual labor employment)
accounted for an additional 4% of the variation in total energy
expenditure (df = 292, adj. r2 = 0.59, p < 0.001; Table 1, model 3).
Study site remained significant (Table 1, model 3), indicating that
differences in lifestyle among sites had measurable effects on to-
tal energy expenditure that were not wholly accounted for by ac-
celerometry, anthropometry, and manual labor employment.
Adding the term body weight 3 CPM/d to model 3, to account
for the greater metabolic cost of physical activity for larger indi-
viduals, did not affect the fit (adj. r2) of the model, and the term
was not a significant predictor of total energy expenditure
(t(291) = �0.19, p = 0.85). Similarly, substituting body weight 3
CPM/d for the CPM/d term in model 3 did not affect the fit of
the model. Adding measures of time spent in ‘‘sedentary’’
(<100 CPM) and ‘‘vigorous’’ (R3960 CPM) physical activity
improved the fit of the model to adj. r2 = 0.61 (Table 1, model 4).
To examine the effects of physical activity on total energy
expenditure, we calculated adjusted total energy expenditure
(total energy expenditureADJ) from the residuals of model 2 in
Table 1, thereby controlling for the effects of fat-free mass,
fat mass, age, height, sex, and study site on total energy
expenditure. Variation in total energy expenditureADJ with
respect to physical activity was substantial; physical activity
accounted for only 7% of the variation in total energy expendi-
tureADJ (Table 1, models 5 and 6). The mean coefficient of
variation within CPM/d deciles (14% ± 3%) was equivalent to
the difference in mean total energy expenditureADJ between
the 1st and 10th deciles (15%; see Table S2). The range of vari-
ation within any decile of CPM/d far exceeded the difference in
median adjusted total energy expenditure across the range of
CPM/d. Results were similar across a range of approaches to
control for potentially confounding effects of body size and
other factors, such as employment in manual labor (see Figures
S1 and S2).

Figure 1. Schematic of Additive Total Energy Expenditure and
Constrained Total Energy Expenditure Models
In Additive total energy expenditure models, total energy expenditure is a
simple linear function of physical activity, and variation in physical activity
energy expenditure (PA) determines variation in total energy expenditure. In
Constrained total energy expenditure models, the body adapts to increased
physical activity by reducing energy spent on other physiological activity,
maintaining total energy expenditure within a narrow range.

 upper four deciles (60th–100th percentile) of CPM/d (Figure 2A).
This plateau was evident in the lowess regression and in the
change in median total energy expenditureADJ over the range
of CPM/d deciles (Figure 2A). The slope of the lowess regression
decreases markedly above 200 CPM/d, such that above 219
CPM/d, each additional increment of 100 CPM/d is asso-
ciated with less than 50 kcal/day increase in total energy
expenditureADJ. We used two approaches to determine the
activity level above which the effect of physical activity on total
energy expenditureADJ was negligible.
First, we iteratively removed subjects at low CPM/d values and
evaluated the effect of physical activity for subjects above
increasing
CPM/d
thresholds
(Experimental
Procedures).
Figure 2B shows the effect (b) of CPM/d on total energy
expenditureADJ, in a model including manual labor, at increasing
CPM/d thresholds. For the n = 143 subjects above a threshold
of CPM/d = 176, the effect of CPM/d on total energy
expenditureADJ is non-significant, and its SE includes zero
(b = 0.31 ± 0.32, p = 0.33; Figure 2B). For the n = 99 subjects
above a threshold of CPM/d = 216, a model including both
CPM/d and manual labor fails to achieve significance (adj. r2 =
0.02, p = 0.12). There was no measurable effect of physical
activity on total energy expenditureADJ above this threshold.
Second, we used change-point regression to estimate the
CPM/d value at which the slope of total energy expenditureADJ
on CPM/d changes from positive to zero (Experimental Proce-
dures). The change point was 230 CPM/d (95% confidence in-
terval 44–428), consistent with the iterative CPM/d threshold
analysis (Figures 2A and 2B). For the n = 92 subjects above
the change point, the relationship between physical activity
and total energy expenditureADJ is indistinguishable from zero
(slope: 0.21 ± 0.35; p = 0.54). The change-point regression
also captured a marginally greater amount of variance in total
energy expenditureADJ (df = 304, adj. r2 = 0.09, p < 0.001)
than linear regression did (adj. r2 = 0.07, p < 0.001, Table 1,
models 5 and 6).

 Resting Metabolic Rate and Activity Energy Expenditure
To further investigate metabolic response to variation in habitual
physical activity levels, we examined two components of total
energy expenditureADJ: adjusted resting metabolic rate (resting
metabolic rateADJ) and adjusted activity energy expenditure (ac-
tivity energy expenditureADJ). Activity energy expenditureADJ
was calculated as (0.9 3 total energy expenditureADJ � resting
metabolic rateADJ). Resting metabolic rateADJ was not correlated
with physical activity (t(202) = �0.14, b = �0.02 ± 0.11, p = 0.89;
Figure 3A). Like total energy expenditureADJ, activity energy
expenditureADJ increased over the low and middle range of
physical activity but plateaued above �230 CPM/d (Figure 3A).
Notably, the activity energy expenditureADJ versus physical
activity
regression
had
a
significantly
non-zero
intercept
(621.8 ± 44.3, t(202) = 14.0, p < 0.001). That is, activity energy
expenditureADJ, the component of total energy expenditure
generally thought to reflect physical activity, was estimated at
�600 kcal/d (�27% of total energy expenditure) when physical
activity assessed by accelerometry was 0 CPM/d. The intercept
remains significantly greater than zero (545.7 ± 76.4, t(145) =
5.27, p < 0.001) even when the analysis is limited to subjects

with physical activity values below the
230 CPM/d plateau point, where the
activity

versus
physical activity slope is greatest. Similar
results were obtained when examining
raw (i.e., unadjusted) total energy expen-
diture, resting metabolic rate, and activity
energy expenditure values, and for a
range of models controlling for effects of
body size and composition (see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures).
We
modeled
two
components
of
activity energy expenditure (Figure 3B).
Activity energy expenditure1 is the component directly linked
to physical activity in a dose-dependent manner and is calcu-
lated using the slope of the activity energy expenditure versus
physical activity regression for CPM/d < 230 (Figure 3A). When
CPM/d = 0, activity energy expenditure1 = 0, and each increment
of physical activity incurs a corresponding increase in activity en-
ergy expenditure1. Activity energy expenditure2 is the remainder
of activity energy expenditure, calculated by subtracting activity
energy expenditure1 from activity energy expenditure. Activity
energy expenditure2 decreases with physical activity above
230 CPM/d, absorbing increases in activity energy expenditure1
while total energy expenditure plateaus (Figure 3B).
DISCUSSION
Metabolic Response to Variation in Habitual Physical
Activity
Our analyses of total energy expenditure and physical activity
support a Constrained total energy expenditure model. Rather
than increasing linearly, in the dose-dependent manner pre-
dicted by Additive total energy expenditure models, the

 relationship between physical activity and total energy expendi-
tureADJ plateaued over the upper range of CPM/d, representing
n = 92–99 subjects, roughly 30% of the dataset (Figures 2 and 3;
Table S2). Although physical activity must incur an immediate
energy
cost
(activity
energy
expenditure1),
compensatory
changes in energy expended on other activities (activity energy
expenditure2) apparently negated the additive effect of addi-
tional physical activity on total energy expenditure among indi-
viduals above �230 CPM/d.
The physiological activities comprising activity energy expen-
diture2, and adapting to high levels of habitual physical activity,
are not immediately evident. One hypothesis is that activity
energy expenditure2 reflects muscle activity that is not readily
recorded via accelerometry (e.g., postural efforts against gravity,
fidgeting). These activities have been shown to contribute sub-
stantially to total energy expenditure [20–22], and their reduction
may contribute to metabolic adaptation [23]. However, the
magnitude of activity energy expenditure2 for sedentary subjects
(�600 kcal/d) exceeds the estimated daily cost of standing, fidg-
eting, and peripheral limb movement [20–22] that would be
missed using our accelerometry protocol, suggesting that
muscular activity alone cannot account for activity energy
expenditure2.
We hypothesize that non-muscular physiological activity con-
tributes substantially to activity energy expenditure2 and its
adaptation to physical activity. Human studies and non-human
animal models show that energy allocation across a broad range
of physiological tasks, including reproductive activity and
somatic maintenance [5, 13–19], may be reduced when physical
activity increases, resulting in decreased activity energy expen-
diture2. Indeed, such physical activity-induced reduction in ac-
tivity energy expenditure2 could potentially contribute to the
beneficial health effects of exercise, reducing energy expendi-
ture on inflammation and detrimental immune system activity
[24]. Non-muscular contribution to activity energy expenditure2
could also explain why inactive subjects confined to bed rest
exhibit physical activity levels (i.e., the ratio of total energy
expenditure/basal
metabolic
rate)
of
1.2–1.4,
above
the
value of 1.1 predicted by Additive total energy expenditure
models [25].
The mechanisms determining the total energy expenditure set
point and regulating activity energy expenditure2 in response to
physical activity and the specific changes in energy expenditure
are a critical target for future research. Food availability, and
particularly the ratio of food availability to physical activity, may
be an important developmental signal in determining an individ-
ual’s total energy expenditure set point [5]. In support of this
hypothesis, subjects with greater body fat percentage, which
can be considered a long-term signal integrating food energy
availability and habitual physical activity, exhibited marginally
higher total energy expenditureADJ across all physical activity
levels (Table 1, models 7 and 8; see Figure S3). Activity intensity
may also play a signaling role, given the positive and negative ef-
fects of sedentary and vigorous activity bouts, respectively, on
total energy expenditure (Table 1, models 4 and 8). Activity inten-
sity could potentially modulate activity energy expenditure2 via
its effect on fatigue, for example by promoting postural behav-
iors that save energy (e.g., sitting instead of standing; see [23]),
or via myokine signaling [26].
Limitations
One important limitation of this study is its cross-sectional
design. Although the available data from prospective studies
support a Constrained total energy expenditure model [5], it
would be useful to investigate the relationships between total
energy expenditure and physical activity examined here within

expenditureADJ (kcal/d) versus physical activity (CPM/d) for the subset of
subjects (n = 204) with measured resting metabolic rate. Ordinary least-
squares regressions are shown. Resting metabolic rateADJ is not correlated
with physical activity, nor are total energy expenditureADJ or activity energy
expenditureADJ among subjects with physical activity above 230 CPM/d.
(B) Components of total energy expenditure (dotted line) modeled as a function
of physical activity, using relationships shown in (A). Resting metabolic rate is
constant (1540 kcal/d). Below the change point of 230 CPM/d, total energy
expenditure = 1.12 CPM/d + 2336; above 230 CPM/d, total energy expendi-
ture is constant (2600 kcal/d). The thermic effect of food (TEF) is calculated as
10% total energy expenditure. Activity energy expenditure (red), calculated as
(0.9 3 total energy expenditure � resting metabolic rate), is divided into two
components. Activity energy expenditure1 (AEE1, solid red) increases with
physical activity in a dose-dependent manner as 1.13CPM/d, the slope of the
adjusted energy expenditure versus physical activity regression for subjects
below 230 CPM/d in (A). Activity energy expenditure2 (AEE2, hatched red) is the
remainder of activity energy expenditure, calculated as activity energy
expenditure2 = activity energy expenditure � activity energy expenditure1. See
also Figures S1 and S3.

 subjects as physical activity was increased over several months,
in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, as discussed above,
accelerometry is an imperfect measure of physical activity and
energy expended in physical activity, which undoubtedly adds
to the variance in total energy expenditureADJ with respect to
physical activity (Figures 1A and S3). Another limitation is the
absence of resting metabolic rate measurements for subjects
at the Jamaica study site, which reduces the sample size for
calculating resting metabolic rate and activity energy expendi-
ture. We also lack measurements of the thermic effect of food
and must rely on estimates here for calculating activity energy
expenditure. Finally, we lack biomarker data to test hypotheses
regarding the role of non-muscular physiological activity in
modulating activity energy expenditure2.
Bridging Ecological and Experimental Studies of Total
Energy Expenditure
The Constrained total energy expenditure model evaluated here
provides a unifying framework for seemingly contradictory re-
sults from previous studies examining physical activity and total
energy expenditure. For studies with large samples that include
both high- and low-physical-activity individuals [4], physical
activity is expected to have a significant positive effect on total
energy expenditure due to the effect of physical activity on total
energy expenditure in low- to moderate-physical-activity individ-
uals (Figure 2). Similarly, intervention studies that increase
physical activity in sedentary subjects are expected to see an in-
crease in total energy expenditure, at least over the short term
(�20 weeks; [5, 10–12). However, metabolic adaptation to
long-term changes in physical activity will blunt the relationship
between habitual physical activity levels and total energy expen-
diture. As a result, comparing industrialized populations with
more active traditional populations [6, 7], or animal populations
in the wild with those in captivity [8], may not reveal differences
in total energy expenditure despite clear differences in physical
activity.
The relationship between physical activity and total energy
expenditure demonstrated in the large, diverse human sample
here is both more variable and more complex than current Addi-
tive total energy expenditure models allow. Regardless of the
preferred statistical model, physical activity accounts for only
�7%–9% of the variation in total energy expenditure after
controlling for anthropometric variables and population location.
Energy balance models focusing solely on the effect of physical
activity on total energy expenditure while ignoring the interde-
pendent and dynamic role of other organ systems will miss a
large portion of the variation in daily energy requirements and
may provide a biased measure of total energy expenditure. As
shown here, Additive total energy expenditure approaches will
tend to underestimate the effect of physical activity on total
energy expenditure at low to moderate levels of activity and
overestimate the effect of physical activity at higher activity
levels (Figure 2B). Furthermore, using activity energy expendi-
ture or the ratio of total energy expenditure/basal metabolic
rate (i.e., physical activity level) to assess physical activity will
overestimate energy expenditure on activity for subjects at
habitually low physical activity levels by pooling activity energy
expenditure1 with activity energy expenditure2 (Figure 3), which
we suggest includes non-muscular physiological activity. Adopt-
ing a Constrained total energy expenditure model for physical
activity [5] and parsing activity energy expenditure into activity
energy expenditure1 and activity energy expenditure2 will
improve the accuracy of energy balance models and advance
public health strategies for mitigating the global epidemic of
metabolic disease.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Data Collection
Subjects were enrolled as part of the Modeling the Epidemiological Transition
Study (METS) [9]. Institutional permissions and subjects’ informed consent
were obtained prior to data collection. Height and weight were measured using
a stadiometer and digital scale, respectively, and self-reported age was
recorded. Total energy expenditure was measured for each subject for
7 days using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method [27]. Subjects ingested
1.8 g 10% H2
18O and 0.12 g 99.9% 2H2O per kg body water. Urine samples
collected prior to dosing, 4 hr after dosing, and 7 days after dosing were
analyzed for isotope enrichment at the Stable Isotope Core Laboratory at
University of Wisconsin–Madison. CO2 production was calculated using Equa-
tion 6.6 in [27], and energy expenditure was calculated using the modified Weir
equation, with respiratory exchange ratio determined from dietary records.
Surveys were used to identify subjects employed in manual labor.
Resting metabolic rate was measured via respirometry (MaxIIa indirect calo-
rimeter, AEI Technologies; SensorMedics, Viasys Healthcare) in the morning,
after an overnight fast. Subjects were supine during resting metabolic rate
measurements, which lasted 30 min. Both oxygen consumption and CO2 pro-
duction were monitored; data from the first 10 min of each measurement were
discarded. Due to equipment failure, resting metabolic rate data from the
Jamaica study site had to be discarded prior to analysis; Jamaican subjects
are not represented in resting metabolic rate or activity energy expenditure
analyses here.
Physical activity was measured using wearable tri-axial accelerometer
(Actical, Philips Respironics) [9]. Subjects were asked to wear the accelerom-
eters continuously for 8 days coinciding with total energy expenditure
measurement, and to remove the devices only for swimming, showering, or
bathing. Days were considered valid for analysis only if the devices were
worn R62% of maximal available wear time, and subjects were only included
in analyses of physical activity if they recorded a minimum of 4 valid days. Wear
time did not covary with measured physical activity levels: there were no differ-
ences among the deciles of physical activity (CPM/d) in wear time (ANOVA:
F(9,322) = 0.423, p = 0.922)). For analyses of physical activity intensity (Table 1,
models 4 and 8), physical activity was defined as ‘‘sedentary’’ (<100 CPM) or
‘‘vigorous’’ (R3960 CPM) using published cut points [28, 29]. Following the
National Center for Health Statistics [30], ‘‘sedentary’’ and ‘‘vigorous’’ physical
activity intensity (Table 1, models 4 and 8) is the total time in minutes accumu-
lated in 10-min intervals. Following prior conventions, we allowed for up to
2 min of below- or above-threshold count activity before considering the
bout to be ended [30].
Data Analysis
We analyzed the association between total energy expenditure and physical
activity, assessed via accelerometry as mean counts per minute per day
(CPM/d), using several approaches. We began by using multivariate regres-
sion to investigate the relative effects of anthropometric variables (fat-free
mass, fat mass, height, age, and sex) and behavioral or lifestyle variables
(accelerometry CPM/d, employment in manual labor, and location) on total
energy expenditure, using linear regression in R [31]. By far the strongest
anthropometric correlate of total energy expenditure was fat-free mass; fat
mass and height were marginally negatively correlated with total energy
expenditure, and age and sex had no effect (Table 1, model 1). To examine
the effect of physical activity on total energy expenditure while controlling
for anthropometric effects, we calculated adjusted total energy expenditure,
total energy expenditureADJ, for each subject by adding residuals from the total
energy expenditure � fat-free mass + fat mass + height + age + sex + study site
regression to mean total energy expenditure (model 2 in Table 1; see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). Total energy expenditureADJ was used for

 subsequent analyses in the main text. We similarly calculated an adjusted
resting metabolic rate, resting metabolic rateADJ, by adding residuals from
the resting metabolic rate � fat-free mass + fat mass + height + age + sex +
study site regression to mean resting metabolic rate, and we calculated an
adjusted activity energy expenditure, activity energy expenditureADJ, as
(0.9 3 total energy expenditureADJ � resting metabolic rateADJ). We also tested
a range of other models correcting for anthropometric and other effects on
total energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate, as well as raw (unad-
justed) values of total energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate, and activity
energy expenditure; results were nearly identical to those reported in the main
text (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S1 and S2).
To examine the shape of the relationship between physical activity and total
energy expenditure and compare Additive and Constrained total energy
expenditure models, we fit three different regression models to the scatterplot
of total energy expenditureADJ against CPM/d. First, we fit a robust locally
weighed regression (lowess) curve [32] using the ‘‘lowess’’ function in R [31],
with f = 2/3, iter = 5. This nonparametric model allows studying non-linear
relationships between continuous variables (e.g., physical activity and total en-
ergy expenditure) without assumptions about the shape of the underlying func-
tion. Second, to test the fit of a linear, Additive total energy expenditure model,
we estimated the linear correlation, via Pearson’s correlation coefficient,
between total energy expenditureADJ and physical activity (Table 1, models
5 and 6). We used a modified version of this approach for the CPM/d threshold
analysis (Figure 1B): we evaluated the effect of CPM/d and manual labor on
total energy expenditureADJ via linear regression for all subjects with CPM/d
values above a threshold CPM/d = i and iterated this analysis over the range
of CPM/d thresholds i = (1, 2, 3.500). The resulting set of b, SE, and model
adjusted r2 values were examined with respect to CPM/d threshold (Figure 1B).
Lastly, we used change-point regression to estimate the association between
physical activity and total energy expenditureADJ, controlling for manual labor
employment. This model is similar to the Constrained total energy expenditure
model, which predicts a plateau in the physical activity:total energy expendi-
ture relationship at higher activity levels (Figure 1) and allows the estimation
of a change point, from increasing linear/additive to flat/plateau. The change
point was estimated using a computer-intensive grid search approach [33],
which has been shown to more flexible than the standard method based on
maximum-likelihood estimation [34]. Bootstrap simulations were applied to
calculate the SE of the change-point estimator [35]. We applied an F-like
test, based on an approximate permutation test, using a computer-intensive
algorithm as described in the literature to formally test whether the Con-
strained total energy expenditure model (piecewise regression model) was
preferred over the Additive total energy expenditure model (traditional linear
regression) [36].
