Summary
Background Weekend hospital admission is associated with increased mortality, but the contributions of varying 
illness severity and admission time to this weekend effect remain unexplored.
Methods We analysed unselected emergency admissions to four Oxford University National Health Service hospitals 
in the UK from Jan 1, 2006, to Dec 31, 2014. The primary outcome was death within 30 days of admission (in or out 
of hospital), analysed using Cox models measuring time from admission. The primary exposure was day of the week 
of admission. We adjusted for multiple confounders including demographics, comorbidities, and admission 
characteristics, incorporating non-linearity and interactions. Models then considered the effect of adjusting for 
15 common haematology and biochemistry test results or proxies for hospital workload.
Findings 257 596 individuals underwent 503 938 emergency admissions. 18 313 (4·7%) patients admitted as weekday 
energency admissions and 6070 (5·1%) patients admitted as weekend emergency admissions died within 30 days 
(p<0·0001). 9347 individuals underwent 9707 emergency admissions on public holidays. 559 (5·8%) died within 
30 days (p<0·0001 vs weekday). 15 routine haematology and biochemistry test results were highly prognostic for 
mortality. In 271 465 (53·9%) admissions with complete data, adjustment for test results explained 33% (95% CI 21 to 70) 
of the excess mortality associated with emergency admission on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, 52% (lower 
95% CI 34) on Sundays, and 87% (lower 95% CI 45) on public holidays after adjustment for standard patient 
characteristics. Excess mortality was predominantly restricted to admissions between 1100 h and 1500 h (pinteraction=0·04). 
No hospital workload measure was independently associated with mortality (all p values >0·06).
Interpretation Adjustment for routine test results substantially reduced excess mortality associated with emergency 
admission at weekends and public holidays. Adjustment for patient-level factors not available in our study might 
further reduce the residual excess mortality, particularly as this clustered around midday at weekends. Hospital 
workload was not associated with mortality. Together, these findings suggest that the weekend effect arises from 
patient-level differences at admission rather than reduced hospital staffing or services.

Introduction
Substantial medical and public attention has been paid to 
the so-called weekend effect, namely that patients admitted 
to hospital at the weekend have greater mortality than do 
patients admitted on weekdays.1 This independent effect 
has been demonstrated in large national and international 
studies, in elective,2 emergency3–6 and all admissions.7–10
Although the excess mortality risk associated with 
weekend admission appears clear, the underlying causal 
mechanisms are not. Many hospitals are widely assumed 
to have fewer staff and resources at weekends than on 
weekdays, affecting patient care.11 Findings from studies 
into the weekend effect have led the UK Government to 
commit to providing National Health Service (NHS) 
hospital care as a 7-day service.12,13
However, it is being admitted at weekends, rather 
than merely being in hospital at weekends, that has been 
consistently associated with higher mortality risk;1,7 
reduced weekend staffing and resources should affect all 
patients in hospital at weekends, not just those newly 
admitted. Alternative explanations for the weekend effect 
include variation in patient factors (eg, presenting illness 
severity, delayed presentation, frailty) that are not 
completely captured in administrative datasets used in 
many studies to date. In such studies1,2 the factor most 
closely reflective of the severity of presenting illness is 
the intrinsic mortality risk score based on clinical 
classifications 
software,14 
which 
leaves 
substantial 
potential for residual confounding of admission-day 
effects by the individual patient’s illness severity (appendix 
p 24). Findings from a 2016 study15 showing increased 
mortality risk only in patients admitted at weekends from 
general practitioners (rather than via the emergency 
room) provide indirect evidence supporting this notion.

Studies using clinical datasets with more detailed 
prognostic data have generally been restricted to specific 
conditions16 or have been much smaller. It is also unclear 
how the excess risk is distributed across the 48 h of 
weekend admissions (with time of admission unavailable 
in hospital episode statistics). Here, we use information 
from common haematology and biochemistry tests 
done around admission, and admission time, from the 
Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database (IORD)17 to 
investigate explanations for the mortality weekend effect 
in emergency admissions to one large hospital group.
Methods
Study design and participants
IORD contains anonymised data from all admissions to 
the four hospitals that make up the Oxford University 
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from April 1, 1997, 
linked to haematology, biochemistry, and microbiology 
test results.17 These hospitals (which include a district 
general hospital, a large teaching hospital, a specialist 
orthopaedic hospital, and a major cancer centre) provide 
all acute care and pathology services in the region, 
supplying a population of about 600 000 individuals. 
Out-of-hospital mortality is determined by regular updates 
from the national information system that records all UK 
deaths, the National Health Service clinical spine 
application.
We analysed data from all emergency admissions 
(defined by all codes with prefix 2 for the variable 
“admission method”), including patients admitted 
via the accident and emergency department, general 
practitioners, consultant clinics, and other methods from 
Jan 1, 2006, to Dec 31, 2014. We excluded elective 
admissions because different factors might affect risks 
associated with weekend admission (eg, restriction of 
specific surgery lists to particular weekdays). IORD 
has Research Ethics Committee and Health Research 
Authority approval (14/SC/1069, ECC5-07[a]/2009).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was 30-day mortality (in hospital or 
after discharge) for consistency with previous studies, 
censoring at the earliest of the following three dates: 
30 days after admission, last routine vital status update, or 
last subsequent admission or discharge. Cox regression 
(which implicitly adjusts for days at risk) considered days 
from admission.
Statistical analysis
As exposures, we first considered all admission factors 
adjusted for in previous NHS studies (appendix p 24).1,2 
Of 504 563 total emergency admissions, we excluded 
69 admissions with missing age, one with negative age, 
seven admissions with missing sex or intersex, and 
548 admissions with missing diagnostic codes (total 
625 [0·1%]), leaving 503 938 admissions in regression 
analyses. The primary exposure was admission day of 
the week, prespecified to be included irrespective of 
statistical significance; as in previous studies,1,2 the 
reference category was Wednesday because this is the 
middle of the week. For other factors, model selection 
used backwards elimination based on minimisation of 
the Bayesian information criterion, using natural cubic 
splines for non-linear effects in continuous factors. We 
then identified pairwise interactions between included 
factors using forward selection based on the Bayesian 
information criterion to produce the final model 
(model A), also fitted to 7-day, 14-day, and 21-day mortality 
as secondary outcomes. Admission day of week was 
categorised as weekend (Saturday or Sunday) versus 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for publications from inception up until 
June 15, 2016, with the terms “weekend” AND “admission” AND 
“mortality”, with no language restrictions, and also reviewed 
references from retrieved articles. Weekend emergency admissions 
have been associated with an excess risk of dying in the next 
30 days compared with weekday admissions (after adjusting for 
patient-level factors available in administrative datasets) in large 
national and international studies, in all admissions and in 
subgroups defined by elective admissions, emergency admissions, 
and clinical subgroups (eg, stroke). The excess mortality is often 
attributed to differences in staffing levels or service provision at the 
weekends. However, there is indirect evidence that the excess 
mortality could be attributed to inadequate adjustment for how 
sick the patients admitted at weekends are.
Added value of this study
We used a large comprehensive warehouse of electronic health 
records to adjust individual-level analyses for factors not 
previously considered, including haematology, biochemistry, 
and microbiology tests, and time of admission. We found that 
adjustment for 15 routinely measured haematology and 
biochemistry test results could explain a substantial 
proportion of the excess mortality effect associated with 
weekend emergency admission. The remaining excess deaths 
predominantly occurred in patients admitted as emergencies 
between 1100 h and 1500 h at the weekend. The excess 
mortality was not associated with multiple measures of 
hospital workload.
Implications of all available evidence
These results are not consistent with staffing or service 
provision being the primary driver of the weekend effect, 
and suggest that much of the remaining excess mortality 
could be accounted for by other characteristics of the patients, 
their health-seeking behaviour, or availability of services outside 
the hospital.

weekday to increase power to identify interactions. 
Secondary analyses investigated mortality risk for 
admission on public holidays. Sensitivity analyses 
included current day of the week at risk in a time-
updated Cox model. Full details are provided in the 
appendix (p 4).
We then investigated the subgroup with 15 commonly 
performed haematology and biochemistry test results 
(haemoglobin, platelets, lymphocytes, neutrophils, 
eosinophils, monocytes, C-reactive protein, urea, 
bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, alanine aminotrans-
ferase, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, and potassium, 
using the closest result to admission time within 
2 calendar days before or after admission). Several of 
these tests reflect the presence of underlying infection. 
We chose tests on the basis of the percentage of 
emergency admissions in whom they were complete 
(appendix p 6). We first confirmed that model A 
provided similar results in all emergency admissions 
and in this subgroup, and then selected additional 
predictors from the 15 test results as previously 
described (model B), incorporating non-linearity with 
natural cubic splines. We did not do multiple 
imputation because it would have required development 
of models for each test of similar complexity to model A 
(which included ten interactions and several non-linear 
effects), and could have increased rather than decreased 
bias if these models were mis-specified.18 We calculated 
95% CIs for the proportion of the admission-day effect 
explained by these test results (log scale) using Fieller’s 
method,19 reporting only lower limits when upper limits 
exceeded 100%. We estimated excess hazards associated 
with admission day over time from admission using 
flexible parametric models.20
To estimate the effect of hospital workload, we used 
three proxy measures (total admissions, total net hospital 
occupancy [admissions minus discharges], and percentage 
of bed occupancy based on inpatient duration); staffing 
information was not available. If the weekend effect were 
due to understaffing or lack of services, increased 
mortality would also be expected when the hospital was 
fuller than average for any given day of the week, because 
rotas are fixed in advance, with extra staff only called in for 
major incidents. We therefore normalised our three proxy 
measures, calculated for each calendar day, to the typical 
value for each day of the week for each calendar year 
(appendix p 8).
We undertook additional sensitivity analyses to assess 
the robustness of our findings (appendix p 7). In 
exploratory analyses, we calculated the unadjusted and 
adjusted mortality differences by hour of admission at 
weekends versus weekdays. Admission hour was then 
split into a four-level categorical variable at 0800 h, 
1100 h, 1500 h, and 0000 h (consistent with Freemantle 
and colleagues7). p values are two-sided and tested the 
null hypothesis of no effect. We used Stata version 14.1 
for all analyses.
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in study design, data collection, 
analysis, or writing of the report. The corresponding 
author had full access to the study data and final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Analyses included 503 938 emergency admissions 
from 2006–14 for 257 596 individuals. Substantially 
fewer emergency admissions occurred at weekends 
than on weekdays (figure 1). Admissions increased 
year on year, but weekend and weekday patterns 
remained consistent over the years (figure 1). Charlson 
score and age were similar in weekend and weekday 
admissions (figure 1).
24 383 (4·8%) emergency admissions resulted in 
death within 30 days of admission (in hospital or 
after discharge). 18 313 (4·7%) of 385 647 patients 
admitted on a weekday died within 30 days of admission, 
compared with 6070 (5·1%) of 118 291 patients admitted 
on a weekend (p<0·0001; table, appendix pp 12, 25). 
Median length of stay was 2 calendar days (IQR 1–6). 
Most time at risk during the 30 days of follow-up was 
therefore spent outside hospital. 271 465 (53·9%) 
admissions had all 15 haematology and biochemistry 
results, ranging from 53·0% to 54·5% across admission 
days (18 244 [74·8%] of 24 383 admissions after which 
patients died within 30 days vs 25 3221 [52·8%] of 
479 555 admissions after which patients were not known 
to have died within 30 days; appendix p 6).
Using model A, all the factors adjusted for in 
previous published analyses or studies of administrative 
datasets had an independent effect on 30-day mortality 
(C-statistic 0·88; appendix pp 9, 12), as did weekend 
emergency admission (adjusted relative risk [aRR] for 
Saturday vs Wednesday 1·08 [95% CI 1·03–1·14], aRR 
for Sunday vs Wednesday 1·09 [1·03–1·14]; figure 2). 
This excess mortality was slightly larger when we fitted 
the identical model to emergency admissions with all 
15 test results (aRR for Saturday vs Wednesday 1·11 
[95% CI 1·05–1·17], aRR for Sunday vs Wednesday 1·11 
[1·05–1·18]; C-statistic 0·84; figure 2, appendix p 12), 
but 
we 
found 
no 
evidence 
of 
heterogeneity 
(pinteraction=0·18). There was no evidence that admissions 
with complete test results had higher adjusted 
mortality than those without all test results (aRR 1·01 
[95% CI 0·98–1·04], p=0·40). Absolute mortality risks, 
and excess risks associated with weekend admission, 
were greatest in the first 2–5 days after admission 
(figure 3).
Values for nine of the 15 test results were markedly 
different for weekend versus weekday emergency 
admissions (eg, median neutrophil count and C-reactive 
protein; figure 1, appendix p 26). This difference was 
predominantly due to proportionately fewer patients 
with normal results being admitted at weekends than 
on weekdays, although the absolute numbers of

65
admissions with abnormal results also fell (appendix 
p 27–28). In model B, each test result independently 
predicted 30-day mortality after adjustment for model A 
factors (appendix p 30). Several test results, notably 
lymphocyte count and sodium and urea concentrations, 
affected mortality risk even within normal ranges. 
Eight interactions with test results added predictive 
information (C-statistic 0·89; appendix pp 10, 30).

In admissions with complete data, test results accounted 
for 33% (95% CI 21 to 70) of the excess mortality risk for 
emergency admission on Saturday and 52% (lower 
95% CI 34) of the risk for Sunday, compared with 
emergency admission on Wednesday (figure 2). The 
adjusted relative risk for residual excess mortality 
(ie, after adjusting for test results) fell to 1·07 (95% CI 
1·01–1·13) for Saturday and 1·05 (1·00–1·11) for Sunday, 
compared with Wednesday. The residual excess mortality 
associated with weekend emergency admission was not 
restricted to any patient or clinical subgroup defined by 
model A factors, and did not vary by calendar year

(pinteraction>0·05; appendix p 19). Interactions between 
weekend versus weekday admission and alanine 
aminotransferase 
(pinteraction=0·004) 
and 
bilirubin 
(pinteraction=0·002) were small in magnitude and did not 
explain the weekend effect (appendix p 40; pinteraction>0·10 
for other interactions between weekend versus weekday 
admission and test results).
In sensitivity analyses, the addition of an indicator that 
blood had been taken for culture (suggesting doctors 
suspected bacterial infection) or for blood gas analysis 
improved model B (p=0·02 for blood culture and 
p<0·0001 for blood gases), but did not affect excess 
mortality risk associated with weekend emergency 
admission (figure 2). Time since last inpatient admission 
and duration of last inpatient admission were highly 
prognostic in addition to model A and model B (data not 
shown), but did not alter excess mortality risk associated 
with weekend admission (appendix p 20).
63 961 (12·7%) admissions in 37 119 (14·4%) individuals 
were within 30 days of a previous admission. Exclusion 
of these readmissions did not affect results (appendix 
p 20). Other sensitivity analyses (appendix p 20) were 
also consistent with main analyses, including adjustment 
for current day of the week at risk as a time-updated 
factor (as well as admission day of the week; figure 2, 
appendix p 21). Similar excess risks were also associated 
with weekend emergency admission for 7-day, 14-day, 
and 21-day mortality (appendix p 42).
There were 73 non-weekend public holidays (typically 
Mondays) from 2006 to 2014. 9347 (3·6%) individuals 
underwent 9707 (1·9%) emergency admissions on public 
holidays; 559 (5·8%) of these admissions died within 
30 days (p<0·0001 vs weekday). Compared with weekdays, 
excess mortality risk was similar for emergency 
admissions on public holidays and weekends, both 
unadjusted and adjusted for model A factors (figure 2). 
Adjustment for haematology and biochemistry test 
results accounted for 87% (lower 95% CI 45) of the excess 
risk associated with emergency admission on public 
holidays (compared with Wednesdays).
Proxy measures for workload showed increasing 
pressure on hospital resources over time (appendix p 43). 
No measure of hospital workload on specific calendar 
days, relative to that expected for that day of the week in 
that calendar year, was independently associated with 
30-day mortality (model A, p>0·06; model B, p>0·16; 
appendix p 22). Adjustment for these measures did not 
attenuate the effect of admission day of the week 
(appendix p 47).
We noted fewer emergency admissions from 1000 h to 
2200 h at weekends than on weekdays, but similar 
numbers from 2200 h to 1000h (figure 1). Mortality risk 
differed significantly by admission hour, being lowest at 
0800–1100 h (figure 4). The largest differences in 
mortality risk between weekend and weekdays were 
between 1100 h and 1500 h. Circadian variation in 
mortality risk was as great as (if not greater than) 
differences in risk between weekends and weekdays. The 
addition of categorised admission hour significantly 
improved both model A and model B (p<0·0001). The 
weekend versus weekday effect depended on time of day 
of admission in model B (pinteraction=0·04; model A 
pinteraction=0·11; figure 4). After adjustment for model A 
factors, excess mortality risks associated with weekend 
admission were somewhat greater for admissions 
between 0800 h and 0000 h, and somewhat less for 
admissions between 0000 h and 0800 h (p=0·07; figure 4), 
with the largest excess for admissions between 1100 h 
and 1500 h (p<0·0001). Adjusting for test results in 
model B significantly reduced the weekend excess risk

except in the middle of the day (1100–1500 h). Between 
1100 h and 1500 h at weekends, evidence of a 1·18-times 
increase (95% CI 1·10–1·27) in relative mortality risk for 
emergency admission remained.
Discussion
Findings from large-scale studies of hospital episode 
statistics have shown that admission to hospital at 
weekends is associated with increased risk of death 
within 30 days compared with admission during the 
week.1–10,16 We used a comprehensive warehouse of 
electronic health records from four hospitals within a 
large NHS trust to examine the effect of accounting for 
illness severity and admission time on this excess risk. 
Results of common haematology and biochemistry tests, 
not available in previous studies,3–5,7 often differed 
markedly between weekend and weekday admissions 
and by admission hour. These test results strongly and 
independently predicted 30-day mortality. In admissions 
with complete data, adjustment for these results 
accounted for 33–52% of the excess mortality associated 
with weekend emergency admission. Furthermore, the 
residual so-called weekend effect was predominantly 
restricted to the middle of the day on Saturdays and 
Sundays, with no excess mortality remaining for weekend 
nights. No patient or clinical subgroups had more or less 
pronounced residual risk of excess mortality.
Previous findings have been interpreted as suggesting 
that reduced staffing is a major driver of the excess 
mortality risk associated with weekend admissions 
(not necessarily the authors’ conclusion7). However, our 
measures of hospital workload, reflecting adequacy of 
staffing levels and service provision relative to each 
specific day of the week, were not associated with 
mortality. Further, the excess mortality associated with 
admission on public holidays was almost completely 
removed by adjusting for test results reflecting 
physiological dysregulation on admission. That is, the 
increased unadjusted risk was mostly explained by 
increased intrinsic mortality risk in patients who 
presented to hospital during public holidays. Because 
staffing levels and services are more similar on public 
holidays and weekends, it seems unlikely that differences 
in staffing levels or services alone would explain the excess 
mortality associated with weekend versus weekday 
admission. This idea is supported by findings from a

previous study11 that showed that the weekend effect was 
unaffected by adjustment for several highly prognostic 
factors reflecting staffing and service provision in 
294 602 emergency admissions for specific surgical 
procedures, and from another study21 showing no evidence 
of association between hospital specialist staffing at 
weekends and mortality for emergency admissions.
Our data support previous findings7 that the main effect 
is not of current day of the week (Monday–Sunday) the 
patient is in hospital, only the day of the week of admission. 
This finding could suggest that effective early management 
is crucial (the so-called golden hour), supported by the 
excess mortality risk being greatest in the first 2 days after 
admission (figure 3). However, failure to manage patients 
optimally in this golden hour at the weekend (eg, due to 
reduced staffing or services) could not account for our 
observation that the weekend effect was restricted to 
admissions in the middle of the day (1100 h to 1500 h). 
Restrictions in access to senior staff, imaging, or other 
diagnostic tests are similar across the weekend. Other 
factors we could not account for might explain this 
mortality excess in the middle of the day. Examples might 
be reduced access to primary and social care for vulnerable 
people (eg, at weekends, frail elderly people are more likely 
to be admitted than referred to more appropriate services), 
or differences in health-seeking behaviour at weekends 
(eg, delays in access to primary care, reduced availability 
of other services, or reluctance to attend emergency 
departments on Friday or Saturday nights).
Although generally recognised in the literature that the 
case mix of patients admitted at weekends differs 
from that of patients admitted on weekdays and that 
administrative data are inadequate for measurement of 
illness acuity, these datasets have nevertheless been 
widely used to investigate the weekend effect. Our ability 
to investigate the effect of test results, admission time,

and hospital workload are major strengths of this study. 
Previous studies have considered overnight versus 
daytime, or shift patterns in small studies,22 in specific 
conditions,23 or did not adjust for illness severity.10 We 
analysed data from unselected emergency admissions, 
avoiding potential coding bias by restricting our analysis 
to specific subgroups.24 We considered overall mortality 
because it is most relevant to patients, it incorporates 
discharge for palliative care, and because being 
discharged alive is a competing risk for in-hospital 
mortality.25 We did many sensitivity analyses to assess the 
robustness of our results.
A major limitation is that we did not have access to 
patients’ vital signs or direct measures of acute illness 
severity (eg, National Early Warning Score, Sequential 
Organ Failure Score) or frailty (Barthel score). Blood 
lactate and blood gases were not measured in most 
patients. In view of the reductions in the weekend effect 
we found by adjusting for haematology and biochemistry 
test results, it is plausible that much of the remaining 
excess risk could be explained by accounting for other 
patient-level factors. For example, some study findings 
suggest that adjustment for National Early Warning 
System score26 or arrival by ambulance27 (also unavailable 
in our study) might help to explain the weekend effect. 
Not all admissions had complete test results; this aspect 
might limit the generalisability of our model B findings. 
Completeness was greater in patients who died within 
30 days of admission. However, admissions with complete 
test results were broadly representative of the full dataset 
(table, appendix p 12), model A provided similar results in 
all admissions and in admissions with complete test 
results, and there was no statistical evidence that 
individuals with complete test results had increased 
mortality after adjustment. Modest oversampling of 
more severe cases with more abnormal results, and 
undersampling of less severe cases with normal results, 
would (if anything) lead to dilution bias, meaning the 
genuine effect of test results would be larger, potentially 
further attenuating the weekend effect. Staffing data were 
not available, so we used proxies for hospital workload. 
We might not have found an effect of hospital workload 
because these were inadequate proxies.
Our study was done in a single hospital group; however, 
it consists of four large hospitals (including a district 
general hospital, a large teaching hospital, a specialist 
orthopaedic hospital, and a major cancer centre), with 
substantial numbers of emergency admissions to three of 
the four hospitals, serving a diverse urban and rural local 
population and accounting for about 1% of the UK 
population. Both our hospital mix and the similarity of

our results to previous multicentre or England-wide 
studies1,7–8 suggest broad generalisability of our findings 
in terms of the potential for residual confounding from 
presenting illness severity, with important implications 
for future studies. For example, investigations of the 
effect of organisation of health-care services on patient 
outcomes might be irretrievably biased without adequate 
adjustment for severity of the presenting illness. Whether 
the clustering of excess weekend mortality in the middle 
of the day is generalisable depends on its underlying 
mechanism, which requires further investigation. 
Investigators of one large study28 of stroke care noted 
several patterns of weekly variation, probably with 
different underlying causes. Lastly, standardised mortality 
ratios, our primary outcome, might not be the most 
appropriate way to measure quality of hospital care.29
In summary, we found that 33–52% of the residual 
excess mortality associated with weekend emergency 
admission after adjustment for standard patient 
characteristics, and 87% of the excess mortality associated 
with emergency admission during public holidays, can 
be explained by results from 15 commonly measured 
blood test results. The residual excess is predominantly 
restricted to weekend admissions between 1100 h and 
1500 h. Mortality is not associated with relative hospital 
workload. Levels of staffing and services available in 
hospitals therefore seem unlikely to explain differences 
in mortality associated with weekend emergency 
admission. Other more plausible explanations include 
differences in patients who attend hospitals at these 
times (eg, in oximetry or vital signs), factors determining 
their health-care-seeking behaviour, and availability of 
services outside the hospital at weekends. As such, 
increased mortality in patients admitted between 1100 h 
and 1500 h at weekends might not be preventable 
through implementation of 7-day hospital services.1,29 
By contrast, the unintended consequence of patients 
delaying presenting to hospital because of fears of worse 
care at the weekends poses a clear, avoidable danger.30
