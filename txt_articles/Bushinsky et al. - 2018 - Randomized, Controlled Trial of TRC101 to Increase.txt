Abstract
Background and objectives Metabolic acidosis is common in patients with CKD and has significant adverse effects
on kidney, muscle, and bone. We tested the efficacy and safety of TRC101, a novel, sodium-free, nonabsorbed
hydrochloric acid binder, to increase serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements One hundred thirty-five patients were enrolled in this randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, in-unit study (designated the TRCA-101 Study). Patients had
a mean baseline eGFR of 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a mean baseline serum bicarbonate of 17.7 mEq/L, and
comorbidities, including hypertension (93%), diabetes (70%), and heart failure (21%). Patients ate a controlled diet
and were treated for 14 days with placebo or one of four TRC101 dosing regimens (1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice daily or 6 g
once daily). After treatment, patients were discharged and followed for 7–14 days.
Results All TRC101 treatment groups had a mean within-group increase in serum bicarbonate of $1.3 mEq/L
(P,0.001)within72 hoursofthefirstdoseandameanincreaseinserumbicarbonateof3.2–3.9mEq/L(P,0.001) at
the endof treatment compared withplacebo, inwhich serumbicarbonatedid not change.Inthecombined TRC101
treatment group, serum bicarbonate was normalized (22–29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment in 35% of patients and
increased by $4 mEq/L in 39% of patients. After discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate decreased nearly
to baseline levels within 2 weeks. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with gastrointestinal events most
common. All patients completed the study.
Conclusions TRC101 safely and significantly increased the level of serum bicarbonate in patients with metabolic
acidosis and CKD.

Introduction
Metabolic acidosis associated with CKD is character-
ized by an imbalance in acid production relative to
excretion, resulting in the depletion of the extracellu-
lar buffer, bicarbonate, as well as buffers mobilized
from bone and muscle (1–6). Chronic metabolic
acidosis is common in advanced stages of CKD, and
it is associated with adverse consequences, including
increased mortality, acceleration of kidney disease
progression, increased muscle breakdown and insulin
resistance, and the development or exacerbation of
bone disease (5,7–16). Clinical evidence shows that
treatment of low serum bicarbonate can improve
kidney, muscle, bone, and nutritional sequelae of
chronic metabolic acidosis (17–24). Several prospec-
tive, controlled clinical studies, ranging from 1 to
5 years in duration, have shown that supplementation
with base attenuates the progression of CKD. In these
studies, oral alkali supplements (e.g., sodium bicar-
bonate or sodium citrate) or reduction of acid pro-
duction through consumption of a very low–protein
(0.3 g/kg per day) diet supplemented with ketoana-
logs led to a decreased rate of eGFR decline and fewer
patients requiring RRT (17–19). Current Kidney Dis-
ease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recom-
mend that base be given when serum bicarbonate
levels are ,22 mEq/L and to maintain a level $22 mEq/L,
and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
guidelines also recommend administering base
when serum bicarbonate is ,22 mEq/L to maintain
the value within the normal range of 22–29 mEq/L
(25–29). Use of guideline-recommended alkali ther-
apies and/or increased intake of fruit and vegeta-
bles reflects current clinical practice; however, these
interventions have the potential to introduce large
amounts of sodium or potassium to patients with CKD
who often have hypertension, fluid overload, and
hyperkalemia (28–37).
Given the clinical benefits of increasing serum bi-
carbonate in patients with CKD who are acidemic and
the concerns associated with providing additional so-
dium and/or potassium, there is a clinical need for new
treatment options to correct metabolic acidosis. TRC101
is being developed as an orally administered, nonabsorbed,
sodium- and counterion-free hydrochloric acid binder
for the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with

 CKD. Acid binding is a novel approach to treating metabolic
acidosis without introducing deleterious counterions, like
sodium or potassium. TRC101 selectively binds and removes
proton (H+) and chloride (Cl2) from the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract, thereby increasing serum bicarbonate. TRC101 is
not an exchange resin, and therefore, no sodium, potas-
sium, or calcium is added to the GI tract. This randomized,
controlled trial tested the hypothesis that TRC101 would
safely and effectively increase serum bicarbonate in pa-
tients with CKD who are acidemic.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The TRCA-101 Study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel-design, six-arm, fixed dose study
that enrolled adult patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD and
metabolic acidosis (Figure 1). It was conducted in two parts.
In part 1 (n=101), patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio
to one of four treatment groups: TRC101 (1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice
daily) or placebo (1.5 g twice daily). In part 2 (n=34), patients
were randomized in a 5:1 ratio to TRC101 (6 g once daily) or
placebo (3 g once daily). One day before the first dose and
throughout the 14-day treatment, all patients resided in a
clinical research unit and ate a study diet controlled for
protein, calories, anions, cations, and fiber in accordance with
dietary recommendations for patients with CKD to provide a
consistent, relatively neutral potential kidney acid load
(Supplemental Table 1) (25,38). The mean potential kidney
acid load for the diets was 0.8 mEq/d, and the mean daily
dietary protein intake was 0.7 g/kg per day (Table 1). After
completion of the treatment, patients were discharged from
the clinical research unit and followed for safety for an
additional 1–2 weeks. The TRCA-101 Study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02809183). The clinical trial was
conducted within the provisions of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by local hospital
ethics committees and national health safety boards. The
TRCA-101 Study was conducted in Eastern Europe at clinical
research units located in Bulgaria (one site) and Georgia (four
sites). Eighty-five (63%) patients were enrolled in Bulgaria,
and 50 (37%) patients were enrolled in Georgia.
Study Population
A total of 154 patients were screened, and 135 patients
with stage 3 or 4 CKD and metabolic acidosis were enrolled
in the study (Figure 2). Enrollment in the TRCA-101 Study
under the original phase 1 protocol began in March of 2016.
The original planned sample size was increased by a
protocol amendment from 60 to 100 and again, by another
amendment, which added part 2 of the study and another
35 patients. The first increase in the sample size provided
more exposure to TRC101 for safety, and part 2 was added
to evaluate a once daily dosing regimen. Enrollment under
the amended protocol that increased the sample size to 100
began in June of 2016, concurrent with the ClinicalTrials.
gov registration for a phase 1/2 study. The last patient was
enrolled in the study in October of 2016, and the study was
completed in November of 2016. Each patient provided
informed consent.
Entry criteria required an eGFR of 20 to ,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, a serum bicarbonate value of 12–20 mEq/L (in-
clusive), and stable kidney function defined by eGFR values at
screening and day 21 that were within the required range and
were not different from each other by .25%. For serum
bicarbonate and eGFR, two qualifying values at least 2 days
apart and within 7 days of randomization were required.
Eligible patients were also required to have a hemoglobin A1c
value of #9.0%, fasting serum glucose #250 mg/dl, and

 systolic BP ,170 mm Hg. Patients were excluded for a low
serum bicarbonate at screening or day 21 that, in the opinion
of the investigator, required emergency intervention. Addi-
tional exclusion criteria included dialysis or AKI in the past
3 months, serum potassium values of ,3.8 or .5.9 mEq/L at
screening, or severe comorbid conditions (summarized in
Supplemental Material). Patients with New York Heart
Association class 1 or 2 heart failure, hypertension, and/or
edema were not excluded.
Interventions
TRC101 was administered at doses of 1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice
daily with breakfast and dinner (i.e., total daily doses of 3,
6, or 9 g/d) or as a once daily dose of 6 g with breakfast,
depending on treatment assignment (Figure 1). Placebo
was microcrystalline cellulose (National Formulary Grade)
administered at doses of 1.5 g twice daily or 3 g once daily.
TRC101 or placebo was administered orally as a suspen-
sion in water for 14 days. All oral concomitant medications
were taken at least 4 hours before or after study drug
administration.
Outcomes
Prespecified efficacy end point analyses for part 1 were
the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate to end of
treatment (day 15) (1) within individual TRC101 dose groups
(primary end point), (2) comparing individual TRC101 dose
groups with placebo, (3) within the combined TRC101
treatment group, and (4) comparing the combined TRC101
treatment group with placebo. Prespecified secondary end
points included the proportions of patients in each treatment
group whose serum bicarbonate increased by $2, $3, and
$4 mEq/L post-treatment (day 15). Prespecified exploratory
end points included additional threshold analyses for serum
bicarbonate (increase by $5, $6, and $7 mEq/L and absolute
serum bicarbonate .20, .22, .27, and .29 mEq/L).
Prespecified efficacy end points for part 2 were the change
from baseline in serum bicarbonate to end of treatment (day
15) comparing 6 g once daily TRC101 with the pooled
placebo group from parts 1 and 2 and the proportions of
patients in the TRC101 6 g once daily group whose serum
bicarbonate increased by $2, $3, and $4 mEq/L post-
treatment (day 15). Additionally, the between-group change
from baseline difference in serum bicarbonate for the TRC101
3-g twice daily and 6-g once daily doses was determined.
Blinding
Because the appearance (TRC101 versus placebo) and the
amount of study drug administered differed among treatment
groups, the designated clinical research unit pharmacist(s)

 drug were unblinded with respect to patient treatment
assignment. These individuals had no other responsibilities
for the study. The investigator, patients, remaining clinical
research unit staff, and most contract research organization
staff (including medical monitor and all personnel responsible
for monitoring study records other than those reviewing drug
accountability records) remained blinded to the patient’s
treatment assignment throughout the study. The sponsor
and the study biostatistician were blinded from the
beginning of the study until the first 60 patients com-
pleted the study; the blind was removed at this point for
the study sponsor and study biostatistician to assist with
clinical program planning and ensure that there were no
safety issues that might have affected expansion of the
study to a phase 1/2 study. A prespecified blinding plan
detailed the blinding procedures.

 Sample Size
Because there was no previous clinical experience with
TRC101, the study sample size was determined pragmatically
on the basis of enrollment estimates, the expected safety
profile of a nonabsorbed polymer drug, and an estimate of
effect size and variability. The sample size of 25 patients per
TRC101 dose group had 82% power to detect a mean 1.5-
mEq/L change from baseline in serum bicarbonate, assuming
that the SD of the change was 2.5 mEq/L, for a one-group
paired t test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Statistical Methods
A prospective statistical analysis plan was developed to
analyze the safety and efficacy data for the study. Statistical
significance was declared with P,0.05, two-sided test.
There were no adjustments for multiplicity and multiple
comparisons.
The mean change from baseline in serum bicarbonate
was analyzed using a longitudinal mixed effects repeated
measures model. Baseline serum bicarbonate was defined
as the mean of the local laboratory values from day 21 and
day 1 (predose). The model included the change from
baseline in serum bicarbonate as the dependent variable;
treatment, time point (days 2–15), and treatment by time
point interaction as fixed effects; patient as random effect;
and baseline eGFR and baseline serum bicarbonate as
continuous covariates. Baseline eGFR and baseline serum
bicarbonate were considered two important covariates to
be included in the mixed model for primary and secondary
efficacy analyses. Adjustment for baseline bicarbonate and
baseline eGFR was prespecified in the analysis plan. To
avoid collinearity between baseline bicarbonate and base-
line eGFR, before model fitting, the linear relationship
between the two variables was examined, and a linear

Results
The TRCA-101 Study was conducted from March to
November of 2016. The study design and patient dispo-
sition are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. There
were no significant differences between the TRC101 and

or baseline eGFR, serum bicarbonate, or comorbidities
(Table 1). The study population (n=135) had a mean (6SD)
baseline eGFR of 35 (613) ml/min per 1.73 m2 and a
median (interquartile range) value of 32 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (21), whereas mean (6SD) and median
(interquartile range) baseline serum bicarbonate values
were 17.7 (61.2) and 17.8 (1.5) mEq/L, respectively. Study
participants had baseline characteristics and comorbidities
common to patients with CKD, including hypertension
(93%), diabetes (70%), left ventricular hypertrophy (29%),
congestive heart failure (21%), peripheral edema (14%),
and stable diuretic use (42%). The underlying cause of
kidney disease in the patients was primarily due to the
combination of diabetes and hypertension (54%) or hy-
pertension alone (19%); additional etiologies included
diabetes alone (10%), GN (10%), cystic kidney disease
(7%), and interstitial nephritis (1%).
There was a significant increase from baseline in mean
serum bicarbonate in all TRC101-treated groups within the
first 24–48 hours (Figure 3). Within 72 hours, the least square
(LS) mean increases in serum bicarbonate were 1.4 mEq/L
(95% confidence interval [95% CI] of LS mean, 0.6 to 2.2;
P,0.001), 1.6 mEq/L (95% CI of LS mean, 0.8 to 2.4; P,0.001),
2.1 mEq/L (95% CI of LS mean, 1.3 to 2.9; P,0.001), and

 1.3 mEq/L (95% CI of LS mean, 0.6 to 2.1; P,0.001) for TRC101
dose groups receiving 1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice daily or 6 g once
daily, respectively. The within-group change from baseline for
the combined TRC101 dose group was 1.6 mEq/L (95% CI
of LS mean, 1.2 to 2.0; P,0.001). All increases in serum
bicarbonate were significantly greater in the TRC101 dose
groups than in the placebo group, which remained un-
changed during this period (0.2 mEq/L; 95% CI of LS
mean, 20.5 to 0.9; P=0.64) (24-, 48-, and 72-hour serum
bicarbonate values are summarized in Supplemental Ta-
bles 2–4, respectively).
Over the 2-week treatment period, TRC101 increased
serum bicarbonate, whereas placebo-treated patients
had no change (Figure 3). At day 15, the between-group
differences in serum bicarbonate versus placebo were 3.4
mEq/L (95% CI of LS mean, 2.3 to 4.5; P,0.001), 3.2 mEq/L
(95% CI of LS mean, 2.2 to 4.3; P,0.001), 3.9 mEq/L (95%
CI of LS mean, 2.9 to 5.0; P,0.001), and 3.7 mEq/L (95% CI
of LS mean, 2.6 to 4.7; P,0.001) for TRC101 dose groups
1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice daily or 6 g once daily, respectively
(Table 2). In contrast, the placebo within-group change
from baseline to day 15 was 20.2 mEq/L (95% CI of LS
mean, 20.9 to 0.5; P=0.55). The mean increase in the
combined TRC101 dose group was 3.6 mEq/L higher than
in the placebo group at the end of the treatment period
(95% CI of LS mean, 2.8 to 4.4; P,0.001). At day 15, there
was no significant difference in the mean serum bicarbon-
ate increase when TRC101 was given at a dose of 3 g twice
daily versus 6 g once daily (20.5 mEq/L; 95% CI of LS
mean, 21.6 to 0.7; P=0.42) (Table 2).
Treatment with TRC101 caused a steady increase in
mean serum bicarbonate in all TRC101 dose groups during
the treatment period (Figure 3). The slope of the increase
did not appear to plateau during the 2-week treatment
period, suggesting that the maximal increase in serum
bicarbonate using the studied doses of TRC101 was not
established in this study. The change in serum bicarbonate
was similar in all groups treated with TRC101 at the end of
the treatment period.
After 2 weeks of treatment, serum bicarbonate increased
by $3, $4, and $5 mEq/L in 52%, 39%, and 22% of patients,
respectively, in the combined TRC101 dose group compared
with 6%, 3%, and 0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively
(Figure 4). In addition, at the end of treatment, 35% of
patients in the combined TRC101 group had a serum
bicarbonate level in the normal range (22–29 mEq/L)
(summarized in Supplemental Table 5). Patients were fol-
lowed for up to 2 weeks after the end of the treatment
period; a decrease in serum bicarbonate of approximately
2.5–3.9 mEq/L from the end of treatment value was observed
across the TRC101 dose groups, with serum bicarbonate
levels returning nearly to the baseline values (Figure 3).
All 135 randomized patients received TRC101 or placebo
daily for 14 consecutive days, and all patients completed
the study. No patients died or had any adverse events
resulting in treatment discontinuation, and no patients
suffered serious or severe adverse events. GI adverse
events were the most commonly reported events in
TRC101-treated patients, and all were mild or moderate
in severity (Table 3). Diarrhea was the most common
adverse event; all cases were mild, self-limited, and of short
duration, and none required treatment. Treatment-emergent
GI events, including diarrhea, were not dose related. There
were no mean changes in electrolytes (i.e., sodium, potas-
sium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, or phosphate), other
than serum bicarbonate, in the patients treated with
TRC101 (Table 4). Patients treated with TRC101 did not
have any significant mean change in BP on day 15 relative to
baseline values (Table 4). TRC101 did not induce metabolic
alkalosis (i.e., serum bicarbonate .29 mEq/L) at any time in
any patient.
Discussion
The TRCA-101 Study was a first in human, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of TRC101 for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis
associated with CKD. TRC101-treated patients had a

 significant increase in mean serum bicarbonate within
24–72 hours of treatment initiation that persisted through
the entire treatment period, whereas there was no change in
mean serum bicarbonate in patients given placebo. In the
combined TRC101 treatment group, 39% of patients had a
$4-mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate at the end of the
14-day treatment period, and TRC101 led to a normalization
of serum bicarbonate (22–29 mEq/L) in 35% of patients.
After discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate levels
decreased to baseline within a 2-week period. In this study,
TRC101 was safe and well tolerated, and all patients
completed the study.
TRC101 is mechanistically distinct from bicarbonate
supplementation as a means of correcting metabolic aci-

TRC101 Treatment of Metabolic Acidosis, Bushinsky et al.

 removes H+ and Cl2 under the pH and ionic conditions
encountered in the human GI tract. The polymer is
composed of low-swelling, spherical beads approximately
100 mm in diameter, and each bead is a single high
molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The
high amine content of the polymer provides a substantial
H+ binding capacity (5–10 mEq/g polymer), sufficient to
achieve the desired effect of serum bicarbonate normali-
zation in a daily dose of the drug that is small enough to
ensure good patient compliance (e.g., ,10 g/d). After
protonated, the TRC101 polymer selectively binds the
anion Cl2, thus preserving the effect of H+ binding.
Extensive crosslinking within the polymer bead provides
size exclusion properties, limiting access of larger, poten-
tially competing anions and thereby, promoting selective
Cl2 binding. The selective binding of Cl2 allows the
unhindered GI absorption of larger anions from the in-
testine, such as short-chain fatty acids, that serve as
bicarbonate equivalents after they are metabolized
(39,40). Thus, serum bicarbonate is increased with
TRC101 treatment without the addition of exogenous
bicarbonate. The TRC101 mechanism of action mimics
the physiologic response to gastric acid removal observed
with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction, where the
acid removal results in an elevated serum bicarbonate level
(41,42). TRC101 is not an exchange resin and binds HCl
without introducing a counterion; thus, as expected, there
were no mean changes in serum sodium, potassium,
calcium, or magnesium during TRC101 treatment (sum-
marized in Table 4).
In the United States, there is currently no approved
treatment for chronic metabolic acidosis, despite clinical
practice guidelines recommending oral bicarbonate sup-
plementation in patients with CKD to maintain serum
bicarbonate $22 mEq/L (25,26,28,29,43). Previous studies
have shown clinical benefits associated with sodium bi-
carbonate treatment of metabolic acidosis. However, these
studies enrolled patients with CKD and mild metabolic
acidosis and excluded patients with heart failure, uncon-
trolled hypertension, edema, and other chronic conditions
that influence fluid status; consequently, the dose of
sodium bicarbonate needed in these studies was typically
#2 g/d (15,17–20,22). Effective treatment of metabolic
acidosis in the broader population of patients with CKD
likely requires an oral sodium bicarbonate dose of 2–6 g/d,
which results in an additional sodium load of 24–72 mEq/d
(0.55–1.65 g sodium per day) (28,29). In the context of CKD,
hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy, this
additional sodium can increase the incidence of fluid
accumulation and edema, while worsening BP (44). In this
study, patients with CKD and mild to severe chronic
metabolic acidosis along with hypertension, congestive
heart failure, and volume-related disorders (edema) were
included.
Treatment with TRC101 induced a steady increase in
serum bicarbonate that was observed in all dose groups
during the 14-day treatment period, with a mean increase
at the end of treatment of 3.2–3.9 mEq/L compared with
the placebo group. The slope of serum bicarbonate increase
did not appear to plateau during the 2-week treatment
period, suggesting that the maximal effects of the TRC101
doses tested in the study have not been determined. On
cessation of TRC101 treatment, serum bicarbonate returned
nearly to baseline levels within 2 weeks, suggesting that
continued treatment with TRC101 is needed to maintain
elevated serum bicarbonate.
TRC101 presented a favorable safety and tolerability
profile; all 135 patients completed the study and took all
scheduled study drug doses. There were no mean changes
in serum parameters other than bicarbonate (i.e., sodium,
chloride, calcium, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium),
and no patient experienced an increase in serum bicar-
bonate that resulted in metabolic alkalosis (i.e., serum
bicarbonate .29 mEq/L). Additionally, patients treated
with TRC101 had no mean change in BP at the end of
treatment, consistent with the sodium-free composition of
TRC101. There are limitations to this study. The study was
conducted in a controlled clinical and dietary environment
with relatively short exposure (i.e., 14 days), and serum
bicarbonate levels did not appear to plateau within the
treatment period.
In conclusion, this study showed that TRC101 was well
tolerated in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis, and
treatment with TRC101 led to a rapid and sustained mean
increase in serum bicarbonate, with 35% of TRC101-treated
patients reaching the normal range. If longer-term studies
support these initial results, TRC101, a novel, counterion-
free, nonabsorbed polymer, may be a new therapeutic
approach to the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in
patients with CKD.
