 Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal. Recruitment was between September 19, 2015, and
February 2, 2016. Participants consented to study procedures and provided usable activity
monitor baseline data. They were randomised, stratified by club, to either the EuroFIT inter-
vention or a 12-month waiting list comparison group. Follow-up measurement was post-pro-
gramme and 12 months after baseline. EuroFIT is a 12-week, group-based programme
delivered by coaches in football club stadia in 12 weekly 90-minute sessions. Weekly ses-
sions aimed to improve physical activity, sedentary time, and diet and maintain changes
long term. A pocket-worn device (SitFIT) allowed self-monitoring of sedentary time and daily
steps, and a game-based app (MatchFIT) encouraged between-session social support. Pri-
mary outcome (objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity) measurements
were obtained for 83% and 85% of intervention and comparison participants. Intention-to-
treat analyses showed a baseline-adjusted mean difference in sedentary time at 12 months
of −1.6 minutes/day (97.5% confidence interval [CI], −14.3–11.0; p = 0.77) and in step
counts of 678 steps/day (97.5% CI, 309–1.048; p < 0.001) in favor of the intervention. There
were significant improvements in diet, weight, well-being, self-esteem, vitality, and biomark-
ers of cardiometabolic health in favor of the intervention group, but not in quality of life.
There was a 0.95 probability of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared with the comparison
group if society is willing to pay £1.50 per extra step/day, a maximum probability of 0.61 if
society is willing to pay £1,800 per minute less sedentary time/day, and 0.13 probability if
society is willing to pay £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). It was not possible to
blind participants to group allocation. Men attracted to the programme already had quite
high levels of physical activity at baseline (8,372 steps/day), which may have limited room
for improvement. Although participants came from across the socioeconomic spectrum, a
majority were well educated and in paid work. There was an increase in recent injuries and
in upper and lower joint pain scores post-programme. In addition, although the five-level
EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is now the preferred measure for cost-effectiveness
analyses across Europe, baseline scores were high (0.93), suggesting a ceiling effect for
QALYs.
Conclusion
Participation in EuroFIT led to improvements in physical activity, diet, body weight, and bio-
markers of cardiometabolic health, but not in sedentary time at 12 months. Within-trial analy-
sis suggests it is not cost-effective in the short term for QALYs due to a ceiling effect in
quality of life. Nevertheless, decision-makers may consider the incremental cost for increase
in steps worth the investment.

 Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Gender-sensitised lifestyle change programmes in a professional sport setting are an
exciting development in men’s health promotion, with the potential to engage men who
are underserved by most programmes.
• A healthy lifestyle and weight management programme delivered in professional sport-
ing settings (Football Fans in Training [FFIT]) has been shown to be effective and cost-
effective in delivering long-term weight loss in overweight and obese Scottish football
fans.
• We drew on the success of FFIT to develop and evaluate the EuroFIT programme in
four European countries. Whereas FFIT introduced physical activity and dietary change
for weight loss, EuroFIT focused on increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary
time as desirable outcomes in their own right.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We conducted a randomised controlled trial (n = 1,113) in 15 football clubs in four
countries and showed that the EuroFIT programme was effective in increasing objec-
tively measured physical activity but not sedentary time 12 months after baseline.
• EuroFIT participants also showed improvements in diet, body weight, indicators of car-
diometabolic health, well-being, and other secondary outcomes.
• EuroFIT was not cost-effective in the short term because there were no differences in
quality of life because, on the measure we used, participants already had high levels of
quality of life at baseline.
What do these findings mean?
• Gender-sensitised lifestyle programmes delivered in professional football clubs have
shown great promise in Europe and could play an important public health role in engag-
ing underserved men.
• Changing time spent sedentary proved difficult. Future lifestyle intervention studies
should attempt to ensure that participants understand the distinction between being
more physically active and spending more time upright.
Introduction
Physical activity is important in preventing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
type 2 diabetes, and several cancers [1,2]. Global recommendations from the World Health

 Organisation (WHO) advise at least 150 minutes per week in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity. Recent estimates show that nearly one third of adults worldwide do not meet these
recommendations and around 9% of premature deaths worldwide in 2008 can be attributed to
lack of physical activity [2]. Not meeting the WHO physical activity recommendations costs
healthcare systems globally 53.8 billion international dollars (INT$), with an additional indi-
rect cost of INT$13.7 billion [3].
Sedentary behaviour has recently been shown to be associated with all-cause and cardiovas-
cular mortality, independently of physical activity [4]. Sedentary behaviour is defined as any
waking behaviour in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture with energy expenditure �1.5 meta-
bolic equivalent tasks (METs) [5]. A meta-analysis has shown that interventions focusing pri-
marily on physical activity have little effect on sedentary behaviour [6], and a specific focus on
sedentary behaviour is needed to achieve substantial improvements in sedentary behaviour.
Combining such a specific focus on sedentary behaviour in a lifestyle intervention programme
with a focus on both physical activity and diet is novel, and given the contribution of all three
behaviours to the burden of the world’s leading noncommunicable diseases, such a pro-
gramme could have a substantial public health impact.
Men are often underrepresented in behavioural lifestyle interventions and are considered
a hard-to-reach and underserved group [7]. However, many men lead an unhealthy lifestyle
and are at high risk for developing noncommunicable diseases. It has been suggested that of
all facets of health promotion, physical activity might be the most likely behaviour to engage
men with their health. A systematic review has identified gender-sensitised physical activity
programmes as a key development in men’s health promotion, with the potential to engage
hard-to-reach men. The review also reported that all four identified studies that involved
men engaging in physical activity with other men through professional sports resulted in
increased physical activity [8]. Gender-sensitised physical activity programmes for men may
also provide useful strategies in promoting other areas of men’s health. Another systematic
review concluded that weight loss and maintenance for men is best achieved with interven-
tions increasing physical activity and improving diet while using behaviour change tech-
niques [7].
Achieving sustainable health behaviour change is challenging, and at-risk population
groups, including overweight and/or inactive men, are difficult to engage and underserved.
The Scottish Football Fans in Training (FFIT) lifestyle programme was designed to attract
overweight men and enable them to lose weight through improvements in physical activity
and diet. FFIT was shown to be cost-effective in supporting clinically significant weight loss. It
also significantly improved self-reported physical activity and diet at 12 months [9], and
improvements were partially maintained 42 months after baseline [10]. The multi-country
European Fans in Training (EuroFIT) programme shifted the focus from weight loss to
improving physical activity and sedentary time [11]. Like FFIT, EuroFIT uses the allegiance
many fans have to their football club to attract at-risk men to a group-based lifestyle change
programme delivered in their clubs.
This paper describes the results from the randomised controlled trial that aimed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the EuroFIT lifestyle programme. The primary aim of the trial is to deter-
mine whether EuroFIT can help men aged 30–65 years with a self-reported body mass index
(BMI) �27 kg/m2 to increase objectively assessed physical activity and decrease objectively
assessed sedentary time over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of the trial include cost-
effectiveness, food intake, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, resting systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, cardiometabolic blood biomarkers, well-being, self-esteem, vitality, and quality
of life.

 Materials and methods
Study design
We undertook a pragmatic two-arm randomised controlled trial in 15 professional football
clubs from leagues in England (five clubs), the Netherlands (four clubs), Norway (three clubs),
and Portugal (three clubs). Study participants were randomised to receive the intervention or
a waiting list comparator (1:1), stratified by club. The study protocol is published [11].
Recruitment and participants
Football clubs were selected by contacting clubs known by the study team to be likely to be
interested in taking part. We sought a minimum of three and a maximum of five in each
country, and the first 15 clubs that signed up were included. Clubs were Arsenal, Everton,
Newcastle, Manchester City, and Stoke (England); Ado den Haag, Groningen, Philips Sport
Vereniging (PSV), and Vitesse (the Netherlands); Rosenborg, Strømsgodset, and Vålerenga
(Norway); and Benfica, Porto, and Sporting (Portugal).
Football clubs led recruitment of participants using emailed invitations to fans, the club
website, social media posts, features in local press, and match-day recruitment.
Participants registered interest online, providing contact details, age, self-reported height
and weight, and preferred football club. A follow-up telephone call included the adapted Physi-
cal Activity Readiness Questionnaire-Plus questionnaire (PAR-Q+) [12], previous participa-
tion in health promotion programmes at the club, and asking if men were willing to consent to
randomisation and to wearing an activity monitor for 1 week at baseline and again at both fol-
low-up assessments. On the consent form, men had the opportunity to opt into providing
blood samples at the baseline and the 12-month follow-up measurements.
Men were eligible if they were aged 30–65, had a self-reported BMI of �27 kg/m2, and con-
sented to study procedures. Men were excluded if they reported a contraindication to moder-
ate intensity physical activity in the PARQ+ or participation in an existing health promotion
programme at the club, or did not provide at least 4 days of usable activity monitor data at
baseline.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated to intervention or comparison groups following baseline
measurement. The allocation sequence for each football club was generated by a computer
programme written by a statistician not involved in the final analysis. The sequence was gener-
ated using randomised permuted blocks, stratified by club, with block lengths of 4 and 6, at
random. The sequence was securely stored, with access restricted to those responsible for
maintaining the randomisation system.
Trial coordinators accessed randomisation allocation via a secure online portal. They
informed participants by telephone and email whether they had been allocated to start the
EuroFIT programme immediately (the intervention group) or to undertake the programme 12
months later (the waiting list comparison group). It was not possible to mask participants or
the fieldwork team to allocation, but the primary outcome measurements could not be
accessed by either, and allocation was not known by study statisticians until after database
lock.
Interventions
EuroFIT was primarily designed to support men to become more physically active, reduce
their sedentary time, and maintain these changes to at least 12 months after baseline. Dietary

 change was also introduced for those who wanted to lose weight. The programme was deliv-
ered at club stadia to groups of 15–20 men over 12 weekly, 90-minute sessions that combined
interactive learning of behaviour change techniques with graded group-based physical activity.
A reunion meeting was scheduled 6–9 months after the start of the programme. To facilitate
group bonding and team spirit, the same group of 15–20 men were expected to attend at the
same time each week.
Details of the EuroFIT programme are published, including a description of the pro-
gramme in the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) [13]. In brief,
we developed detailed manuals for coaches and participants, and trained club coaches over
2 days to deliver programme content in an appropriate and accessible style. This included
encouraging positive banter, making sessions enjoyable, promoting a ‘team’ environment,
and using interactional styles congruent with other (predominantly) male contexts [14]. The
programme aimed to work with rather than against predominant constructions of masculin-
ity [9,14] whilst supporting lifestyle change. Some elements (e.g., tips to change diet or
increase physical activity) were adapted to country-specific norms. Coaches were taught
about the importance of warm-up activities to prevent injuries, and the programme
included the Fe
´de
´ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 11+ programme
[15]. Coaches taught participants to choose from a ‘toolbox’ of behaviour change techniques
(including setting and reviewing goals for behaviours and outcomes, action planning, self-
monitoring, and information about health and emotional consequences of change) and to
emphasise personally relevant benefits of behaviour change (e.g., being better able to fulfil
valued activities and roles). These behaviour change techniques were offered as tools for
men to use for however long they found them useful and to encourage men to develop inter-
nalised and self-relevant motivation for becoming more active, sitting less, and eating a
healthier diet [16].
We developed a novel pocket-worn, validated device (SitFIT) [17] to allow self-monitor-
ing of sedentary and nonsedentary time (time spent upright [18]), in addition to daily steps
(S1 Appendix). In the first week of the programme, men were taught how to measure the
time they spent upright and the number of steps they take each week as a baseline. In the sec-
ond and subsequent weeks, they were encouraged to follow an incremental programme to
set weekly goals to slowly increase the number of steps and time spent upright each week,
and to use the SitFIT to monitor their progress to these goals. Evidence on the use of self-
monitoring devices for physical activity after participation in the FFIT programme suggests
that although some continued to find them useful in the long term, others do not, as walking
and other physical activity was embedded in everyday life without self-monitoring being nec-
essary [19].
EuroFIT also explicitly encouraged between-session and post-programme peer support for
changing behaviour through interacting with each other using a social media platform most of
them were familiar with (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Groups). They were not given specific
instructions on the content of interaction; coaches could decide whether or not they partici-
pated in the interactions. Between-session group social support was also encouraged using
game-based social interaction with the MatchFIT app (S1 Appendix). MatchFIT allowed par-
ticipants to contribute their weekly steps to their group’s collective average step count and
compare it with that of a virtual competitor team. Coaches encouraged the use of MatchFIT as
a means for participants to support one another as they pursued increases in their step counts,
but did not themselves participate. Programme materials are available through request at

 Procedures
A fieldwork team collected outcome data at baseline, post-programme, and after 12 months in
club stadia. They scheduled separate measurement sessions for intervention and comparison
groups post-programme to minimise contamination. For participants who consented to bio-
marker assessment, we took a venous blood sample at baseline and 12 months, after 6 hours
fasting.
To maximise attendance and retention, we made appointments by telephone, confirmed by
email or letter, and sent short message service (SMS) reminders. We scheduled additional
measurements either in stadia or at home as needed, but almost all men attended the regular
measurement sessions. We recorded sociodemographic characteristics (age, ethnicity, educa-
tion, marital status, current employment status, and income) at baseline.
In thanks for their participation in the research, we offered a club store voucher for the
equivalent of €25 at post-programme and €75 at the 12-month measurements.
Primary outcomes.
The two primary outcomes were total physical activity (steps per day)
and total sedentary time (minutes per day), objectively measured 12 months after randomisa-
tion using the activPAL monitor (model activPAL micro; PAL Technologies, Glasgow, United
Kingdom). The activPAL has been found to have good measurement properties to assess sit-
ting, standing, stepping, and postural transitions in adults [20–22].
The activPAL is a small activity monitor attached to the thigh and worn for 7 consecutive
full days. At the first of two on-site baseline visits, participants were shown how to fit the activ-
PAL and how to refit it after removal. They were asked to wear the device continuously, except
during water-immersing activities (e.g., swimming, bathing). Participants returned approxi-
mately 9 days later for the second on-site baseline visit, during which the activPAL was
removed and the data were downloaded on a computer. Post-programme and at 12 months,
researchers posted preprogrammed activPAL devices to participants 10–12 days before stadia
measurement sessions, along with reminders. The standard operating procedure for preparing
activPAL data for analysis is available in S2 Appendix.
Intervention fidelity, attendance, and experience.
To assess fidelity across all clubs,
researchers observed delivery of the fourth EuroFIT session and rated delivery of six key activi-
ties on a 3-point scale (1 = activity not delivered, 2 = activity adapted, and 3 = activity deliv-
ered) and the proportion of activities that scored 3 was calculated. Coaches reported weekly
attendance onto a secure online portal. A post-programme questionnaire asked intervention
participants to rate their overall experience of the EuroFIT programme on a 10-point scale and
to rate how much they used SitFIT and MatchFIT on a scale of 0–4, where 0 was ‘not at all’,
and 4 was ‘a great deal’.
Self-reported behavioural outcomes.
Self-reported physical activity was assessed using
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short Form) (IPAQ) [23], self-reported sed-
entary time using the Marshall questionnaire [24], frequency of physically active choices using
the Activity Choice Index [25], self-reported diet using an adapted Dietary Instrument for
Nutrition Education (DINE) [26], and alcohol intake using a 7-day recall questionnaire.
Objectively measured secondary outcomes.
Body weight was measured using an elec-
tronic flat scale (Tanita HD366) with light clothing. Body height was measured at baseline only
without shoes, using a stadiometer (Leicester Height Measure). BMI was calculated as body
weight (kilograms) divided by the square of body height (meters) (kg/m2). Waist circumfer-
ence was measured twice (three times, if the first two measurements differed by �0.5 cm)
using a tape measure (Seca 201), and the mean was calculated over the nearest two measure-
ments. Blood pressure was measured with a blood pressure monitor (Omron 705-CPII) after 5
minutes sitting still.

 Blood samples were stored at 4 ˚C and processed within 24 hours, and then frozen at
−80 ˚C. Biochemistry tests for fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (c311, Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill,
UK), and insulin immunoassays (e411, Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK) were run on clin-
ically validated automated platforms. All tests used manufacturers’ reagents, calibrators, and
quality-control materials. All coefficients of variation for quality controls were <5%. Homeo-
stasis model-estimated insulin resistance (HOMAIR) was calculated as fasting plasma glucose
(mmol.l−1) × fasting plasma insulin (mU.l−1)/22.5 [27].
Self-reported health and psychosocial outcomes.
Participants rated their well-being
using the Cantril ladder, self-esteem using the 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem questionnaire,
vitality using the subjective vitality scale, and health-related quality of life using the five-level
EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). EQ-5D-5L utility weights were estimated using the
English value set [28]. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated by multiplying the
utility weights with the amount of time a participant spent in a particular health state. Transi-
tions between health states were linearly interpolated. Participants also reported joint pain and
any long-standing illnesses, disabilities, or infirmities. Questionnaires are available in S3–S5
Appendices.
Adverse events. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any injury or newly diag-
nosed health condition arising during the trial study period that led to hospitalisation or pro-
longed medical attention, was immediately life threatening, or fatal. Events were reported by
coaches or participants by email or telephone and during follow-up measurement, then fol-
lowed up by telephone to gather further details. The likelihood of an event being related to
EuroFIT was assessed by participants and research staff and arbitrated by the Data Monitoring
and Ethics Committee.
Costs.
Costs were measured from the societal perspective and included programme deliv-
ery, healthcare utilisation, medication use, and absenteeism from work. Unit costs (£, 2016)
from the UK were used to value healthcare utilisation and absenteeism [29,30]. Programme
delivery costs were calculated using costs reported by participating football clubs (i.e., prepara-
tion, coordination and administration, recruitment, programme delivery and staffing, and
materials). Costs for non-UK football clubs and universities were converted to British pounds
using purchasing power parities [31].
Sample size calculation
With two primary outcomes, sample size calculations were based on achieving 90% power at a
2.5% significance level. In order to detect an effect size of 0.25 standard deviation (SD) units, a
sample size of 399 per group was required. For physical activity (SD approximately 4,000 steps
per day), this equates to an average increase of 1,000 steps/day. For sedentary time (SD almost
100 minutes/day [32]), this equates to an average decrease in sitting time of 25 minutes/day.
To achieve almost 800 men with outcome data at 12 months, we estimated we would need to
randomise 1,000 participants.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are summarised as mean and SD, median and interquartile range (IQR), or
mean and standard error (SE) for multiply-imputed data in the cost-effectiveness analyses.
Categorical data are summarised as frequencies and percentages. Outcomes post-programme
and at 12 months were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models, adjusted for

 randomised group and baseline value of the outcome measure as fixed effects, and football
club and country as random effects. Model residual distributions were examined graphically,
and data were transformed as necessary. All analyses were intention-to-treat.
Baseline data were summarised by randomised group and for those who did or did not pro-
vide outcome activPAL data at the post-programme and 12-month assessment points, to assess
the representativeness of those who provided outcome data for analysis.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out for analyses of the two primary outcomes and for
body weight: (a) multiple imputation of missing baseline data, (b) repeated measures analy-
sis, using data from all three time points in the same model, and (c) analyses to account for
waking wear time (the duration for which the activPAL device was worn whilst the partici-
pant was awake).
For repeated measures analyses, data from all three time points (baseline, post-programme,
and 12 months) were included as outcomes; fixed effects were included for randomised group,
time point, football club, and a randomised group-by-time interaction. A random participant
effect was included, and a general (unstructured) covariance structure was allowed for model
residuals across the three time points. Intervention effects at post-programme and 12 months
were estimated using the interaction terms from these models.
Two methods were used to account for waking wear time. First, the primary analysis mod-
els were repeated using the mean number of steps per hour and the percentage of waking time
spent sedentary as outcome variables. Second, the repeated measures analyses described above
were repeated with waking wear time included as a fixed effect.
For the primary outcomes and weight at 12 months, intervention effect heterogeneity was
assessed by extending the regression models to include group-by-moderator interaction
terms. Moderating factors considered were age, marital status, years of education, employment
status, income, club, country, baseline BMI, long-standing illness, and pain in upper and
lower joints.
All p-values are two-sided. For the primary outcomes, p-values <0.025 are considered sta-
tistically significant. For all other analyses, no adjustment has been made for multiple compari-
sons, and p-values <0.05 are considered suggestive of true associations. The statistical analysis
plan is provided in S1 Analysis Plan.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
We used multiple imputation, using predictive mean matching to account for the skewed dis-
tribution of costs to impute missing costs and effects. We constructed 20 imputed data sets
(loss of efficiency, <5%). Mixed-effects regression models estimated effect differences, and lin-
ear regression models estimated cost differences. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) by dividing the cost difference between the intervention and comparison
groups by the effect difference. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bias-corrected and
accelerated bootstrapping with 5,000 replications and plotted on cost-effectiveness planes.
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) curves show the probability that the EuroFIT programme
was cost-effective compared with the comparison group for a range of different ceiling ratios.
The ceiling ratio is the amount of money society is willing to pay for one unit of effect extra.
This ceiling ratio is set at a maximum of £30,000 per QALY by the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE). However, for other effect measures (such as steps per day), such
predefined ceiling ratios are not available.
A sensitivity analysis considered cost-effectiveness from the healthcare provider’s perspec-
tive (i.e., excluding absenteeism costs). We also performed a complete case analysis to examine
if imputation influenced our results.

 Public involvement
Members of the public who had experience of similar programmes were members of our Stra-
tegic Partners Advisory Board and Trial Steering Committee and shaped the development of
the protocol. Others, who had no previous involvement in similar programmes and were
recruited through participating football clubs, advised on the development of the EuroFIT pro-
gramme, specifically in commenting on prototypes of the SitFIT device and MatchFIT app.
They also commented on trial procedures in a test of our measurement procedures undertaken
before baseline measurement.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
The study was approved in each country by local ethics committees before the start of the
EuroFIT study (ethics committee of the VU University Medical Center [2015.184]; Regional
committees for medical and health research ethics, Norway [2015/1862]; Ethics Council of
the Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon [CEFMH 36/2015]; and Ethics Commit-
tee at the University of Glasgow College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences [UK]
[200140174]). Written informed consent to participate in the study was be obtained from all
participants.

Transparency declaration
The lead author (SW) affirms that this manuscript is an honest, accurate, and transparent
account of the study being reported; that no important aspects of the study have been omitted;
and there were no deviations from protocol.
The trial is registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials registry
as ISRCTN32677491.
Results
Participants were recruited between September 19, 2015, and February 2, 2016. Participant
flow through the trial is shown in Fig 1. Main reasons for exclusion for men who showed
interest in the trial were BMI <27 kg/m2 (42.4%), inability to reach men after they expressed
interest, men not being approached because the study had reached the maximum number of
participants at a club (39.3%). Participants spanned all sociodemographic groups, but a major-
ity were ‘native’ to the study country (meaning each of the participant, their mother, and their
father was born there), had at least 12 years of education, were in full-time work, and were
married or living with a partner (Table 1). At baseline, participants’ mean daily step count was
8,372 steps/day, sedentary time was 625 minutes/day, and BMI was 33.2 kg/m2.
Those who provided outcome data (i.e., those who returned activPAL monitors with at
least 4 valid days of measurements) were, on average, approximately 2 years older than those
who did not, and slightly more likely to be married (S1 Tables, Table A). There was no clear
difference in income in those who provided outcome data, nor in ethnicity, education,
employment, or prevalent long-standing illness. In terms of baseline measures of study out-
comes (S1 Tables, Table B), those who provided outcome were generally more active and less
obese at baseline, compared with those who did not provide outcome data. This is a common

 feature of lifestyle intervention studies, in which those with the poorest lifestyle are hardest to
engage in research.
We observed deliveries of the fourth session in 14/15 clubs. In these, coaches delivered 221
of 252 (88%) key tasks. Coaches in each of the 15 clubs provided attendance records for 553
programme participants: of these, 473 men (85.6%) attended at least 6 of the 12 sessions; 296
(53.5%) attended 10 or more sessions; and 85 (15.3%) attended all 12 sessions. Intervention
participants rated their overall experience of the EuroFIT programme positively, producing a
median score of 9 on a 10-point scale (IQR 8, 10; 70 missing). Asked to report their use of the
SitFIT and MatchFIT, 65.1% of intervention participants reported they used the SitFIT ‘a great
deal’ (score 4 on a scale of 0–4) and 36.8% reported they used MatchFIT ‘a great deal’.
The intervention group had a higher mean daily step count at 12 months than the compari-
son group (estimated difference: 678 steps/day [97.5% confidence interval (CI), 309–1,048],
p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in sedentary time (estimated
difference: −1.6 minutes/day [97.5% CI, −14.3–11.0], p = 0.77) (Table 2). In post-programme
measurement, larger between-group differences in step counts (estimated difference: 1,208
steps/day [95% CI, 869–1,546]) and sedentary time (estimated difference: −14.4 minutes/day
[95% CI, −25.1 to −3.8]) were observed (Fig 2). Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputations,
adjusting for activPAL wear time and repeated measures analysis, showed broadly similar
results (S1 Tables, Tables C, D and E).
Data summaries for participants who provided data at both baseline and post-programme,
or baseline and 12 months, are provided in S1 Tables, Tables F and G.
There was no evidence that improvement in physical activity at 12 months varied by age,
marital status, years of education, employment status, income, club, country, baseline BMI,
long-standing illness, or pain in upper and lower joints. There was a significant interaction

 between the effect of the programme on sedentary time at 12 months and limiting long-stand-
ing illness (p = 0.034), so that those with limiting long-standing illness increased their seden-
tary time. There was no evidence of any other intervention effect differences between
subgroups (S1 Fig, Figure A and B).
Mean body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and the proportion of participants with BMI
�30 kg/m2 all improved significantly in favor of the intervention group (Table 3). The inter-
vention effect on body weight varied by baseline BMI (interaction p < 0.001), with greater
effects seen in those with larger BMI at baseline (S1 Fig, Figure C).
All self-reported behaviours, including diet, improved post-programme and at 12 months
in favor of the intervention, except alcohol intake, which improved only at 12 months
(Table 4). In contrast to objective measurements, self-reported sitting time at 12 months signif-
icantly decreased in the intervention group compared with comparison.
The intervention also improved several cardiovascular risk biomarkers at 12 months. Sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure were both improved; fasting insulin and HOMAIR were
reduced by 15%; and fasting triglycerides, and ALT and GGT concentrations were reduced by
7%–8% (Table 5).

 The intervention significantly improved self-reported well-being, self-esteem, and vitality,
but not quality of life, as measured by the EQ-5D-5L at 12 months (Table 6).
The intervention group reported more recent injuries and higher upper and lower joint
pain scores post-programme, and a higher lower joint pain score at 12 months (Table 7).
Prices per cost item and unadjusted mean differences in costs between the two groups are
presented in Table 8. Costs of the EuroFIT programme differed between countries, ranging
from £189.5 to £267.5 per participant. There were no significant differences in any other cost
categories between intervention and comparison groups except for visits to physiotherapists.
There was no statistically significant difference in total societal costs.
The mean difference in QALYs between the intervention and comparison group was small
and not statistically significant (Table 9). One QALY lost in the intervention group was associ-
ated with an incremental cost of £126,119 compared with the comparison group. The proba-
bility of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared with the comparison group was at most 0.13
for ceiling ratios up to 30,000 £/QALY (S2 Fig).
One additional step/day in the intervention group was associated with an incremental cost
of £0.41 compared with the comparison group (equating to £410 per 1,000 extra steps/day).
There was a 0.95 probability of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared with the comparison

 probability of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared with the comparison group at a ceiling
ratio of £6,000 per additional participant achieving a decrease in weight of at least 5%, £1 per
additional minute of physical activity, and £6,000 per additional participant meeting the physi-
cal activity guidelines.
The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare provider perspective
(Table 8) and using complete cases only were comparable to the main analysis.
Seven SAEs were reported, six in the intervention group (diagnosis of heart disease, frac-
tured wrist, fractured rib, two anterior cruciate ligament ruptures, and a torn meniscus) and
one death in the comparison group. Five were deemed likely to be associated with EuroFIT
(the fractured rib occurred during a warm-up at a EuroFIT session; the other injuries occurred
during football matches organised by participants after the programme had finished, but still
indirectly linked to participation in the programme).

 Discussion
Principal findings
A large number of men expressed interest in the EuroFIT programme in each of the 15 football
clubs. The programme helped participants to achieve increases in objectively measured physi-
cal activity but did not result in a lasting decrease in objectively measured sedentary time 12
months after baseline. The EuroFIT programme also helped men to improve secondary out-
comes including weight, waist circumference, diet, well-being, self-esteem, and vitality. How-
ever, in the within-trial analysis the programme did not improve quality of life as measured by
EQ-5D-5L and hence was not cost-effective based on QALYs.

 Strengths and weaknesses of the study
The EuroFIT programme was based on the successful weight loss and healthy living pro-
gramme, FFIT and, like FFIT, had wide inclusion criteria. It had a sound theory base and
logic model [13], the behaviour change technique ‘toolbox’ included those known to initiate
and sustain behaviour change [33,34], and the programme drew on sociological understand-
ing of masculinities to attract and retain participants [9,14]. EuroFIT was well regarded by
participants, over 80% of whom attended at least half of the sessions. Post-programme, 65% of
men in the intervention group reported using the SitFIT device to self-monitor steps and sit-
ting time ‘a great deal’; 37% reported using the game-based MatchFIT app to encourage inter-
action between sessions and after the programme ended ‘a great deal’. Although EuroFIT
attracted men from across the socioeconomic spectrum, the majority who took part were well
educated and in paid work. With no obvious denominator population, we have no way of
knowing if those attracted are representative of all men from local fan bases who support par-
ticular clubs.
There was an increase in recent injuries and in upper and lower joint pain scores post-pro-
gramme, which might also explain higher physiotherapist costs observed in the intervention
group. Although observations to assess overall fidelity showed that coaches delivered 88% of
tasks as intended, preliminary analyses of other process evaluation data suggest that coaches
sometimes delivered physical activity sessions that were more vigorous than specified and did
not sufficiently emphasise warm-up and cooldown exercises. A focus during the 2-day coach
training may be needed to avoid too many injuries.
The EuroFIT evaluation spanned four European countries and 15 professional football
clubs, used objective measurement of physical activity and sedentary time, and retained over
80% of participants to objective 12-month outcome measurement. This suggests that the
results are likely to be generalisable to other football clubs within Europe. It was not possible to
blind participants to which group they were in, although physical activity and sedentary time
were objectively assessed.
The men attracted to the programme already had quite high levels of physical activity at
baseline (8,372 steps/day). This may have limited the room for improvement and led to under-
estimation of the potential effects of the programme if less active participants were recruited. It
has been known for some time that recruitment of those most in need of physical activity
interventions is more challenging than recruiting those who are already reasonably active [35].
It is possible that even more active, personalised approaches to recruitment [36] and limiting
eligibility to those who do not achieve the recommended levels of physical activity would help
to avoid an overrepresentation of more active men and would provide more opportunity for
less active men to join the programme.
Another limitation is the potential for possible reactivity effects, in which participants
change their physical activity and sedentary behaviours during the measurement week. Due to
the unblinded nature of the study, the effectiveness of the intervention might have been over-
estimated if the intervention group did increase their activity levels more than the comparison
group as a result of social desirability. However, no studies to date have reported on substantial
reactivity effects in studies using 7-day accelerometer assessments.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies
EuroFIT showed above average improvements in physical activity compared with systematic
reviews and meta-analysis of other physical activity intervention programmes [37–39]. The
findings from the EuroFIT trial reinforce those from a recent systematic review suggesting
that gender-sensitised physical activity interventions in professional sports settings are a

 promising route for promoting men’s health [8]. The review identified several physical activity
interventions in this setting; the FFIT study, designed to help overweight men lose weight
through improvements in physical activity and diet, was the only large randomised controlled
trial [40]. Recent long-term follow-up of participants in the FFIT study showed that improve-
ments in weight loss and in self-reported physical activity were maintained 3.5 years after base-
line [10]. The FFIT programme has been adapted for delivery Canada (in ice hockey) [41] and
Australia (in Aussierules football) [42]. FFIT formed the basis for the development of EuroFIT;
the success of the EuroFIT programme offers further evidence of the long-term public health
potential of this approach.
The FFIT trial reported greater weight loss (4.94 kg; 95% CI, 4.0–5.9) than we found in
EuroFIT (2.4 kg; 95% CI, 1.7–3.1), although improvements in self-reported physical activity
were broadly comparable. These differences may be because dietary choice was introduced
later in EuroFIT than in FFIT and weight loss emphasised only for those who wanted to do so.
In FFIT, dietary and physical activity changes were both emphasised as ways of achieving and
maintaining a healthier weight.
The focus of EuroFIT on reducing sedentary time was only successful in the short term. A
systematic review showed similarly short-lived reductions in sedentary time [43], although
some interventions showed effects up to 12 months. Workplace interventions have achieved
larger reductions in sedentary time, although consistent long-term change has not yet been
reported [44]. There are no clear, publicly known guidelines for reducing sedentary time,
knowledge of the association between high levels of sedentary time and health is still not wide-
spread, and sedentary time is often confused with physical inactivity [45]. Preliminary analyses
of qualitative data from EuroFIT’s process evaluation suggest that both participants and
coaches were confused by the combined messages of increasing physical activity and simulta-
neously increasing time spent upright. For example, the SitFIT device was liked by participants
but mostly used to self-monitor stepping; few participants reported self-monitoring time spent
upright. Future lifestyle intervention studies should attempt to ensure that participants under-
stand the distinction and appreciate the benefits of decreasing sedentary time, as well as
increasing physical activity.
Although the EuroFIT programme was not expensive to deliver (between £180 and £268
per participant), the lack of improvement in quality of life (as measured by the EQ-5D-5L)
meant that the probability of it being cost-effective at ceiling ratios up to £30,000 per QALY
was only 0.13 over a 12-month time frame. The equivalent probability for the FFIT pro-
gramme, which estimated QALYs via the Short Form-12 (SF12) questionnaire rather than EQ-
5D-5L, was 0.89 at the same ceiling ratio over the same time frame [40]. Although the EQ-5D-
5L is now the preferred measure for cost-effectiveness analyses across Europe, baseline EQ-
5D-5L utility scores were relatively high in EuroFIT (0.93), suggesting a ceiling effect that lim-
its room for improvement in EQ-5D-5L utility scores. Whether the EuroFIT programme is
considered cost-effective for physical activity and body weight at 12 months and shorter-term
improvement in sedentary time depends on decision-makers’ willingness to pay for the
observed improvements in these outcomes. We are in the process of developing a model of
longer-term cost-effectiveness over a 5-year horizon to represent the benefits of physical activ-
ity in reducing the incidence of four chronic health conditions (colorectal cancer, type 2 diabe-
tes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) and mortality.
Meaning of the study
We have added to previous evidence [8,40] that suggests engaging men in physical activity
through programmes that work with existing constructs of masculinity is a promising route

 for promoting men’s health. We have shown that, while participation in the EuroFIT pro-
gramme did not result in improvement in sedentary time, it did result in improvements in
physical activity, body weight, waist circumference, diet, well-being, vitality, and self-esteem
and also to cardiovascular risk biomarkers.
A 678 steps/day increase in objectively measured physical activity is substantial. Objectively
measured levels of physical activity are always lower than self-reported levels [46], and global
physical activity recommendations are based on self-report. The association between objec-
tively measured physical activity and health biomarkers is substantially stronger than the
association with self-reported physical activity [47]. Given the observed improvements in car-
diovascular risk biomarkers, EuroFIT is likely to result in important reduction in the risk of ill
health if the improvement in physical activity is maintained.
Combining lessons learned from EuroFIT and its predecessor, FFIT, will allow the further
refinement of evidence- and theory-based lifestyle change programmes delivered in profes-
sional sports settings.
