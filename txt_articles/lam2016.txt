IMPORTANCE Bright light therapy is an evidence-based treatment for seasonal depression,
but there is limited evidence for its efficacy in nonseasonal major depressive disorder (MDD).
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of light treatment, in monotherapy and in combination
with fluoxetine hydrochloride, compared with a sham-placebo condition in adults with
nonseasonal MDD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
sham-controlled, 8-week trial in adults (aged 19-60 years) with MDD of at least moderate
severity in outpatient psychiatry clinics in academic medical centers. Data were collected
from October 7, 2009, to March 11, 2014. Analysis was based on modified intent to treat
(randomized patients with �1 follow-up rating).
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to (1) light monotherapy (active
10 000-lux fluorescent white light box for 30 min/d in the early morning plus placebo pill);
(2) antidepressant monotherapy (inactive negative ion generator for 30 min/d plus fluoxetine
hydrochloride, 20 mg/d); (3) combination light and antidepressant; or (4) placebo (inactive
negative ion generator plus placebo pill).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to the 8-week end point. Secondary outcomes included
response (�50% reduction in MADRS score) and remission (MADRS score �10 at end point).
RESULTS A total of 122 patients were randomized (light monotherapy, 32; fluoxetine
monotherapy, 31; combination therapy, 29; placebo, 30). The mean (SD) changes in MADRS
score for the light, fluoxetine, combination, and placebo groups were 13.4 (7.5), 8.8 (9.9), 16.9
(9.2), and 6.5 (9.6), respectively. The combination (effect size [d] = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.64)
and light monotherapy (d = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31) were significantly superior to placebo
in the MADRS change score, but fluoxetine monotherapy (d = 0.24; 95% CI, −0.27 to 0.74)
was not superior to placebo. For the respective placebo, fluoxetine, light, and combination
groups at the end point, response was achieved by 10 (33.3%), 9 (29.0%), 16 (50.0%), and
22 (75.9%) and remission was achieved by 9 (30.0%), 6 (19.4%), 14 (43.8%), and 17 (58.6%).
Combination therapy was superior to placebo in MADRS response (β = 1.70; df = 1; P = .005)
and remission (β = 1.33; df = 1; P = .02), with numbers needed to treat of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.6 to
5.8) and 3.5 (95% CI, 2.0 to 29.9), respectively. All treatments were generally well tolerated,
with few significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bright light treatment, both as monotherapy and in
combination with fluoxetine, was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of adults
with nonseasonal MDD. The combination treatment had the most consistent effects.

M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) affects at least 5% of
the population, with a lifetime prevalence esti-
mated at 14%.1 It is the second-ranked cause of dis-
ability worldwide2 and is associated with impairment in qual-
ity of life,3 increased risk of mortality,4 and societal burden.5
Treatments for MDD include psychotherapies and
antidepressants,6,7 but remission rates remain low despite ad-
equate treatment8 and more therapeutic options are needed.
Light therapy, an effective treatment for seasonal affec-
tive disorder (SAD),9 may also be appropriate for MDD. Bright
light is a safe, well-tolerated, nonpharmacological treatment
that can be used alone or combined with medications.10 Light
can correct disturbed circadian rhythms, which have been im-
plicated in the pathophysiology of MDD.11 Previous meta-
analyses of light therapy for nonseasonal MDD, however, have
yieldedonlyequivocalandconflictingevidenceforefficacy.12,13
Two more recent systematic reviews both concluded that the
quality and methods of the identified studies were too hetero-
geneous to conduct a meta-analysis.14,15 They each found in-
sufficient evidence for efficacy of bright light monotherapy,
although 1 review found low-quality evidence for bright light
as adjuvant treatment to antidepressants.15
Insummary,thesesystematicreviewsindicatethattheevi-
dence for benefits of bright light therapy for nonseasonal MDD
is inconclusive and well-designed studies are required to re-
solve this issue. Hence, we conducted a placebo-controlled
study to investigate the efficacy of light therapy, an antide-
pressant (fluoxetine hydrochloride), and the combination for
the treatment of outpatients with nonseasonal MDD. We hy-
pothesized that light monotherapy and the combination treat-
ment would be more efficacious in reducing depressive symp-
toms than a placebo condition.
Methods
Setting
This randomized, double-blind study was mainly conducted
in 3 psychiatric outpatient clinics (1 clinic in Vancouver, Brit-
ish Columbia, Canada, and 2 clinics in Toronto, Ontario,
Canada); because of slow recruitment, the study was halted
in 2 other sites (only 5 patients were entered over 2 years). Data
were collected between October 7, 2009, and March 11, 2014,
and the analysis was conducted from March 16, 2015, to May
9,2015.Thestudywasapprovedbyinstitutionalreviewboards
at the University of British Columbia and the University of To-
ronto.
Participants
Participants were recruited by referral and advertisements and
provided written informed consent. eTable 1 in Supplement 1
lists eligibility criteria. In summary, patients were aged 19 to
60 years ; had a DSM-IV-TR16 diagnosis of MDD as assessed by
board-certified psychiatrists and confirmed with the Mini In-
ternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)17 and a score of
20 or higher on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D)18 at screening and baseline; and were psychotropic
medication free for at least 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit.
Patients were excluded for seasonal pattern, bipolar and psy-
chotic disorders, substance abuse or dependence within the
past year, or serious suicidal risk as judged by the clinician. Co-
morbid anxiety and other psychiatric disorders were allowed
if they were not the primary diagnosis. Patients were also ex-
cluded if they had unstable medical illnesses, had retinal dis-
ease, were pregnant or breastfeeding, or had previously used
fluoxetineorlighttherapy.Patientswerealsoexcludedfortreat-
ment resistance during the current episode (lack of response
to ≥2 antidepressants at therapeutic doses for >6 weeks) or for
using other concurrent treatments for depression, including
psychotherapy.
Protocol and Randomization
The full trial protocol is available in Supplement 2. Eligible pa-
tientsafterthescreeningvisit(week−1)entereda1-weekphase
without treatment to regulate their sleep-wake schedule as
much as possible (eg, patients were encouraged to sleep only
between 22:00 and 08:00) and to identify spontaneous re-
sponders.Patientswhosignificantlyimprovedinthisweek(de-
fined as ≥25% improvement in HAM-D scores) were with-
drawn. Otherwise, participants were randomly allocated 1:1:
1:1 to 1 of 4 treatment conditions for 8 weeks: (1) light
monotherapy using a fluorescent light box plus a placebo pill;
(2)fluoxetinemonotherapyusinganinactiveiongeneratorwith
fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20 mg/d; (3) placebo treatment with
an inactive ion generator plus a placebo pill; or (4) combined
treatment using a light box plus fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20
mg/d. Randomization codes were computer generated cen-
trally and stratified by site in random blocks of 4 or 8. Alloca-
tion concealment was ensured because randomization codes
could not be obtained prior to logging in the unique partici-
pant code. Patients were seen for outcome assessments at
weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 or at unexpected termination.
Interventions
Device Treatments
The active treatment device consisted of daily exposure to a
fluorescent light box for 30 minutes as soon as possible after
awakening, preferably between 7 and 8 AM (Carex Day-Light
Classic,emitting4000-Kwhitelightratedat10 000luxat35.56
cm from screen to cornea, with a UV filter [for spectral emis-
sion, see the eFigure in Supplement 1]). Patients used the light
box at home and were given standardized verbal and written
instructions.
The sham treatment device was a negative ion generator
(SphereOne Inc) modified to emit an audible quiet hum but de-
activated so that no ions were emitted. Patients were given the
same instructions for using the ion generator as used for the
light box.
Deception was used, as approved by the instititional re-
view boards, to enhance the plausibility of the sham condi-
tionbyobscuringthestudyobjectives.Patientsweretold,using
a standard script, that investigators were comparing light and
ion treatment and that half the treatment devices were inac-
tive, but without further details. Thus, patients were not aware
that all the light devices were active while all the ion genera-
tors were inactive. Pretreatment expectations were assessed

with a modified expectation of response questionnaire (eTable
2inSupplement1).19Adherencewasmonitoredusingdailylogs
of device treatment times completed by patients and re-
viewed at each visit. Patients were also instructed to avoid
spendinganexcessiveorunusualamountoftimeoutdoorsdur-
ing the study period.
Medication Treatments
The active medication treatment was a daily, fixed dose of
fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20 mg, taken in the morning. The
placebo was an identical capsule containing inert filler. Ad-
herence was measured by capsule counts at each visit.
Assessments
To preserve treatment blinding, patients were evaluated by
telephone at each visit by independent evaluators blinded to
treatment condition. Although the HAM-D was originally
planned as the primary outcome, pilot testing found the
HAM-D had poor interrater reliability on telephone ratings, so
it was not used. Instead, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS),20 evaluated using the structured in-
terview guide,21 was used. Interrater reliability was assessed
using 3 recorded interviews; the intraclass correlation for the
MADRS among 5 evaluators was 0.933. Telephone evaluators
were replaced if they became unblinded during the study. Re-
sponse was defined as a reduction of 50% or more from base-
line in MADRS scores, and remission was defined as a MADRS
score of 10 or lower at the final visit.
Study psychiatrists blinded to treatment condition evalu-
ated patients at each visit using the Clinical Global Impression
(CGI) subscales for severity and improvement.22 Patients also
completed self-rated questionnaires during each visit, includ-
ing the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-
report(QIDS-SR).23AdverseeffectswereassessedusingtheAd-
verse Events Scale,24 a self-rated scale that assesses severity of
41adverseevents.25Atreatment-emergentadverseevent(TEAE)
wasdefinedasanyincreaseinratingduringtreatmenttoascore
of moderate or severe. For descriptions of the assessments, see
eTable 2 in Supplement 1.
Statistical Analysis
All randomized patients were included in the analysis based
on modified intent to treat, defined as randomized patients
with at least 1 follow-up rating. Missing data were imputed
usinglastobservationcarriedforward.Theoriginalsamplesize
was estimated based on a power analysis using end point
change scores on the MADRS: 54 patients per condition would
allow 80% power to detect a mean difference vs placebo of at
least 3.5 points or an effect size of 0.4, regarded as a small to
medium-sized treatment effect.26 Because of slow recruit-
mentandexpirationoffunding,however,thestudywashalted
before the target sample size was attained.
All treatment variables remained coded and the investi-
gators were blinded to variable identity during the primary
analysis. The change in MADRS score from week 0 to week 8
(or termination) was the primary outcome. Analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) was used, with covariates for baseline MADRS
score, site, and sex. A preplanned simple contrast compared
each of the active conditions against placebo. Post hoc tests
were then conducted to explore differences between pairs of
conditions. The changes in QIDS-SR and CGI improvement
scores were analyzed similarly. Response and remission
rates were analyzed using binary logistic regression with
preplanned contrasts (for each active condition against pla-
cebo) and covariates for baseline MADRS score, site, and sex.
Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen d26 and numbers
needed to treat (NNTs) were estimated. We used χ2 tests to
analyze rates of TEAEs; if the overall 4 × 2 χ2 test was signifi-
cant, post hoc 2 × 2 χ2 tests were conducted on paired com-
parisons. All tests were 2-sided with the significance level
set at α = .05. All analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics for Windows version 22.0 statistical software (IBM
Corp).
Results
Sample
Figure 1 shows the participant flow through the phases of the
study. A total of 131 eligible participants entered the study and
122 patients were randomized to treatment (32 to light mono-
therapy, 31 to fluoxetine monotherapy, 29 to combination
therapy, and 30 to placebo). Table 1 shows clinical informa-
tion on the patients in the 4 conditions. Using 1-way ANOVA,
there were no significant differences in any of the clinical vari-
ables. The ANOVA for expectation rating score showed no dif-
ferences between patients randomized to each individual con-
dition (F3,116 = 0.62; P = .60).
Primary Outcome
The mean (SD) change in MADRS score from baseline to the
8-week end point was 16.9 (9.2) in those who received com-
bination therapy, 13.4 (7.5) in those who received light mono-
therapy, 6.5 (9.6) in those who received placebo, and 8.8 (9.9)
in those who received fluoxetine monotherapy (Table 2). The
ANOVA for change scores on the MADRS showed a significant
overall effect (F6,115 = 4.12; P = .001) and a significant effect of
condition (F3,115 = 7.01; P < .001). The preplanned simple con-
trasts found significant effects of light treatment vs placebo
(P = .006) and combination vs placebo (P < .001), but not for
fluoxetine vs placebo (P = .32). The effect sizes vs placebo for
the fluoxetine, light treatment, and combination groups were
d = 0.24 (95% CI, −0.27 to 0.74), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31),
and1.11(95%CI,0.54to1.64),respectively.PosthocTukeytests
found that the combination was also superior to fluoxetine
(P = .02). The per protocol results with completed partici-
pants were similar to the results of last-observation-carried-
forward analyses (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Secondary Outcomes
Table 2 shows results for other outcomes. At the 8-week end
point for the placebo, fluoxetine monotherapy, light mono-
therapy, and combination therapy groups, response was
achieved by 10 (33.3%), 9 (29.0%), 16 (50.0%), and 22 (75.9%),
respectively. The binary logistic regression model for MADRS
response had a significant overall effect for treatment condi-

For other outcomes, the ANOVA for the change in CGI im-
provement scores (Table 2) showed a significant overall ef-
fect (F5,116 = 3.62; P = .004) and a significant effect of condi-
tion(F3,116 = 5.70;P = .001).Preplannedsimplecontrastsfound
significant effects for light treatment vs placebo (P = .01) and
combination vs placebo (P < .001) but not for fluoxetine. Simi-
larly, the ANOVA for change in QIDS-SR score was significant
in overall effect (F6,115 = 2.72; P = .02) with a significant over-
alleffectofcondition(F3,115 = 3.27;P = .02).Preplannedsimple

cebo (P = .004) but not for light treatment or fluoxetine.
Figure 2 shows the mean MADRS change scores from base-
line at each treatment visit. Post hoc Bonferroni tests found
significant superiority of combination treatment vs both pla-
cebo and fluoxetine at weeks 4, 6, and 8. Light treatment was
significantly superior to placebo at weeks 4, 6, and 8 and su-
perior to fluoxetine at week 4.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events
There was a single serious adverse event during the trial: a par-
ticipant in the combination treatment condition was hospi-
talized for worsening suicidal ideation after treatment week
4. This was judged, by both the treatment team and the pa-
tient,tobemorelikelyrelatedtoanunexpectedseverestressor
(a sexual assault that occurred the week prior to hospitaliza-
tion) than to the treatment itself.
The percentage of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE was
not significantly different between conditions (placebo, 16 pa-
tients [53.3%]; fluoxetine, 25 patients [80.6%]; light treat-
ment, 20 patients [62.5%]; combination, 15 patients [51.7%];
χ2
3 = 6.85; P = .08). Table 3 shows the TEAEs reported in more
than 5% of patients. Most TEAEs were transient. There were
no switches to hypomania. The percentage of patients report-
ing at least 1 TEAE self-rated as severe during treatment was
not significantly different between conditions (placebo, 24 pa-
tients [43.3%]; fluoxetine, 25 patients [67.7%]; light treat-
ment, 16 patients [50.0%]; combination, 11 patients [37.9%];
χ2
3 = 0.63; P = .89). Similarly, there were no significant differ-
ences between conditions in overall dropout rates in the study
or in dropouts due to TEAEs.
Discussion
The main result of this study was that both light mono-
therapy and the combination treatment had significant ben-
efits compared with a sham-placebo condition in adults with
nonseasonal MDD. The combination treatment showed sig-
nificant results for both the primary outcome (change in
MADRS total score) and key secondary outcomes (including

MADRSresponseandremissionrates).Thebenefitsofthecom-
bination treatment were apparent in both interviewer-rated
(MADRS, CGI improvement) and patient-rated (QIDS-SR) out-
come scales. Light monotherapy was significantly superior to
thesham-placeboconditionintheprimaryoutcomeandinCGI
improvement scores, but not in other secondary outcomes.
This trial represents, to our knowledge, the first adequate-
duration, placebo-controlled comparison of light mono-
therapy and combination light and antidepressant treat-
ment. Previous studies of light monotherapy have been very
shortindurationornotshamcontrolled.Forcombinationtreat-
ment, Martiny et al27,28 previously found that sertraline hy-
drochloride, 50 mg/d, combined with bright white light
(10 000-lux fluorescent light for 60 min/d) was superior to ser-
traline combined with “placebo” dim red light (50 lux for 30
min/d), similar to the results in our study. Limitations of the
study by Martiny27 included the 5-week study duration, which
may be too short to evaluate medication response, and lack of
a placebo-only condition. Our randomized double-dummy de-
sign, in which patients used a device and took a pill, controls
for the nonspecific effects of light therapy or medication. The
ion generator appeared to be a credible sham treatment in that
expectation ratings were not significantly different between
conditions.
In post hoc exploratory analyses, the combination treat-
ment was also significantly superior to fluoxetine mono-
therapy, although there were no significant differences be-
tween fluoxetine and placebo. Fluoxetine is an efficacious
antidepressant29butthesmaller-than-plannedsamplesizemay
have limited the statistical power to detect differences. In SAD
studies, light therapy often has a rapid effect within 1 to 2
weeks. In this study, there was steady improvement with both
light conditions throughout the 8 weeks. Post hoc statistical
separation from placebo occurred only after 4 weeks, a pat-
tern of response more similar to that of antidepressants.
All treatments were generally well tolerated with low rates
of withdrawals owing to adverse events and no differences be-
tween conditions. The higher rate of TEAEs in this study is
likely related to using a patient-rated scale instead of relying
on spontaneous reports as per usual in clinical trials. The fluox-

etine monotherapy was associated with a greater frequency
of some TEAEs than placebo (sleepiness, delayed orgasm in
women)andcombinationtreatment(increasedappetite),while
the light monotherapy had higher rates of some TEAEs than
placebo (diarrhea) and combination treatment (diarrhea, in-
creasedappetite).Interestingly,thecombinationtreatmentdid
not show higher rates in any TEAE, which suggests that the
combination may mitigate some of the adverse effects of fluox-
etine and light alone.
The mechanism of action of light therapy is still un-
known, but major hypotheses in SAD involve resynchroniz-
ing circadian rhythms and/or restoring neurotransmitter
dysfunction.30-32 Nonseasonal MDD may also be associated
withdisturbancesincircadianrhythms.11,33Brightlighthaspre-
dictablecircadianphase–shiftingeffectsinhumans,34butstud-
ies of light therapy in SAD have not consistently demon-
strated correlations of phase shift with response.31,35 Rapidly
depleting serotonin36,37 and catecholamines38 can reverse the
antidepressant effects of light therapy in SAD, thereby sug-
gesting that bright light may have direct monoaminergic ef-
fectssimilartothoseseenwithantidepressants.39Furtherstud-
ies will be required to determine whether any of these effects
mediate the antidepressant effect of light therapy in MDD.
Limitations
Thestudyusedadouble-dummydesigninwhichpatientsused
a treatment device and took a pill each day. Designing a sham
control condition for bright light, which cannot be com-
pletely disguised, is challenging.40 Sham conditions have used
low-intensitylightornonlightconditionstocontrolforthenon-
specific behavioral effects of light treatment (eg, waking at a
particular time, sitting quietly for 30 minutes, using a novel
device, etc). Low-intensity light is problematic because many
participants are aware that bright light is active and there is
no consensus for the threshold intensity of an “inactive dose”
of light. Hence, nonlight sham interventions, such as a deac-
tivated ion generator, have been used.41,42 Ion generators are
viewed by participants as a credible treatment for depres-
sion, likely because beneficial effects of negative ions on mood
have been reported.43,44
Because the preplanned sample size was not attained, the
study had limited power to detect clinically significant differ-
ences between active conditions. This study also compared
fixed-dose strategies. It is possible that higher dosing, for both
medication and light treatment, might lead to greater re-
sponse.However,fluoxetinehydrochloridedosageshigherthan
20 mg/d do not show greater efficacy.45,46 Our study used a
standard light therapy protocol that has been effective in SAD
studies, but there has been little study of the optimal para-
meters for light treatment in nonseasonal MDD. The study did
not control or measure the patients’naturalistic light expo-
sure.
Generalizability
Thestudywasconductedinoutpatientpsychiatryclinicsandex-
cludedsignificantpsychiatricandmedicalcomorbidity,similar
to registration trials for new antidepressants. However, results
maynotbegeneralizabletoprimarycareortocomplexpatients.
Allsitesweresituatedbetween39°and49°northlatitudes,and
effects of light may not generalize to other latitudes.
Conclusions
Light treatment, whether in monotherapy or particularly in
combination with fluoxetine, is efficacious and well toler-
ated in the treatment of nonseasonal MDD. The treatment ef-
fects were large and NNTs were clinically relevant. Further
studies exploring mediators and moderators of response will
be important.
