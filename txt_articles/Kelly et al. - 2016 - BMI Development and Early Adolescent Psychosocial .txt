abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The underlying influences on different patterns of BMI 
development are not well understood, and psychosocial outcomes linked to BMI 
development have been little investigated. Objectives were to identify BMI developmental 
trajectories across the first decade of life, examine early life predictors of trajectory 
membership, and investigate whether being on a particular BMI trajectory is associated 
with markers of psychosocial well-being.
METHODS: We used latent class analysis to derive BMI trajectories by using data collected 
at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 years on 16 936 participants from the Millennium Cohort Study. 
Regression models were used to estimate predictors of BMI trajectory membership and 
their psychosocial correlates.
RESULTS: Four trajectories were identified: 83.8% had an average “stable” nonoverweight 
BMI, 0.6% were in a “decreasing” group, 13.1% had “moderate increasing” BMIs, and 
2.5% had “high increasing” BMIs. Predictors of “moderate” and “high” increasing group 
membership were smoking in pregnancy (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.17 and 1.97, respectively), 
maternal BMI (ORs = 1.10 and 1.14), skipping breakfast (ORs = 1.66 and 1.76), nonregular 
bedtimes (ORs = 1.22 and 1.55). Children in the “moderate” and “high” increasing groups 
had worse scores for emotional symptoms, peer problems, happiness, body satisfaction, and 
self-esteem, and those in the “high increasing” group were more likely to have tried alcohol 
and cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS: Several potentially modifiable early life factors including smoking in pregnancy, 
skipping breakfast, and bedtime routines were important predictors of BMI development 
in the overweight and obese range, and high BMI growth was linked to worse psychosocial 
well-being.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Distinct patterns 
of BMI development exist over the childhood years.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Several potentially 
modifi
 able early life factors are linked to BMI 
growth patterns in the overweight and obese range 
through childhood. BMI growth trajectories in the 
overweight and obese range through childhood are 
associated with worse psychosocial well-being in 
early adolescence.

Overweight and obesity are linked 
to health throughout the life course. 
A growing body of research suggests 
the existence of distinct BMI 
development trajectories through 
childhood.

– 
12 Previous studies 
have identified 3 broad types of 
trajectories: a majority group with 
“healthy” BMI throughout childhood, 
groups who develop BMI in the 
overweight range at some point 
during childhood, and those with 
BMI in the overweight or obese range 
throughout childhood.

influences on different patterns 
of BMI development are not well 
understood, but factors reported to 
predict childhood BMI trajectories 
include mother’s BMI,

Previous work suggests that a range 
of early life factors including infant 
feeding, diet, physical activity, and 
family routines are associated with 
child overweight and obesity.13 
However, comparison of study 
findings is often hampered for 2 
main reasons. The first is differences 
in study design used, such as 
representative population 
1 
 
 
– 
6 versus 
convenience samples. 
7 
– 
9 Second, 
studies often consider different 
potential influences for BMI growth, 
overweight, or obesity.
Apparent links between overweight 
and obesity and psychosocial well-
being exist, although the direction of 
association is not clear, and may be 
bidirectional. Several studies indicate 
that early psychosocial stress and 
adverse family environments are 
associated with an elevated risk of 
obesity, 
 
14 
 
– 
17 and many others suggest 
that being overweight or obese 
is linked to elevated risks of poor 
psychosocial well-being, including 
low self-esteem and depressive 
symptoms.16, 
 
17 One previous 
study examined BMI development 
trajectories and adolescent 
psychosocial well-being and 
showed that the exploration of risky 
behaviors such as tobacco smoking 
was more common for those who 
were obese throughout childhood. 
18 
Given that healthy development early 
in life has long-lasting consequences, 
improving our understanding 
of the factors influencing BMI 
development, and of how particular 
BMI trajectories relate to markers 
of well-being, could have important 
implications for health throughout 
the life course.
To our knowledge this is the 
first article that uses nationally 
representative data from the UK 
to address the following research 
objectives:
 
• Identify BMI developmental 
trajectories across the first decade 
of life. We derive trajectories 
empirically by using latent 
class analysis to group subject 
with similar patterns of BMI 
development. We hypothesize 
there will be distinct BMI growth 
trajectories, including BMI growth 
patterns in the overweight and 
obese range, and a nonoverweight 
trajectory.
 
• Examine early life predictors 
of trajectory membership. We 
hypothesize that some factors, 
including cigarette smoking, 
factors linked to family routines 
including skipping breakfast and 
nonregular bedtimes, delayed 
infant motor development, low 
levels of physical activity, and 
dietary indicators such as low 
fruit consumption and intake of 
sugary drinks, will increase the 
risk of having BMI growth in the 
overweight and obese range, 
whereas breastfeeding will have a 
protective role.
 
• Investigate whether BMI trajectory 
membership is associated with 
markers of psychosocial well-
being, including socioemotional 
difficulties, self-esteem, happiness, 
and risky behaviors in early 
adolescence. Here, we hypothesize 
that having BMI growth in the 
overweight or obese range will 
correlate with poorer psychosocial 
well-being, an umbrella term that 
here encompasses socioemotional 
difficulties, low self-esteem, 
unhappiness, and risky behaviors 
such as cigarette smoking and 
alcohol consumption.
METHODS
Participants
Data were from the first 5 sweeps 
of the UK Millennium Cohort Study, 
a prospective study of children 
born into 19 244 families, sampled 
from all live births in the United 
Kingdom between September 2000 
and January 2002. 
19 The first sweep 
of data was collected when cohort 
members were ~9 months old, and 
the subsequent 4 sweeps of data 
were collected at ages 3, 5, 7, and 
11 years. We used data from the 
latter 4 sweeps (ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 
years) to estimate trajectories of BMI 
development.
A total of 17 601 families participated 
in at least 1 of the 4 sweeps, of which 
245 multiple births (234 sets of 
twins and 11 sets of triplets) were 
excluded from analysis. Another 186 
participants had no BMI data at any 
sweep and were excluded from our 
analyses. After we dealt with outlier 
BMI values (described below), there 
were 14 205, 14 790, 13 457, and 
12 697 participants with BMI data at 
sweeps 2 to 5, respectively. A total of 
16 936 participants were included in 
the trajectory analysis, of whom 9523 
(56.2%) had data in all 4 sweeps, 
3810 (22.5%) in any 3, 2024 (12.0%) 
in any 2, and the remaining 1579 
(9.3%) in 1 sweep.
BMI
At ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 years children 
were weighed and had their height 
measured without shoes or outdoor 
clothing. Weights in kilograms 
to 1 decimal place and heights 
to the nearest millimeter were 
recorded. 
20 These measures were 
used to calculate BMI. Values were

considered to be outliers if BMI was 
<10 or >50, resulting in 6, 0, 3, and 
5 values from each of sweeps 2 to 5 
being removed, respectively. Mean 
(SD) values at each sweep were 16.5 
(2.1), 16.4 (1.9), 16.7 (2.4), and 19.3 
(3.7).
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Cohort members were classified into 
7 groups based on their ethnicity as 
reported by their mothers: white, 
Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, 
black Caribbean, black African, 
and other. 
21 Household income 
was categorized into equivalized 
quintiles. Occupational class was 
indicated according to the standard 
National Statistics Socioeconomic 
Classification 3-group categorization 
(higher managerial, administrative, 
and professional; intermediate; 
and routine and manual; with an 
additional category, never worked 
and long-term unemployed). Highest 
maternal education attained at sweep 
1 was grouped into 6 categories: 
higher education including degree 
or professional diploma or higher; 
Advanced Levels [A-levels], which 
are UK school leaving examinations 
taken at age 17 to 18 years; General 
Certificate of Secondary Education 
[GCSEs], which are UK school 
examinations at age 15 to 16 years, 
broken down into A–C grades and 
D–G grades; other qualifications 
including overseas qualifications; and 
none).
Pregnancy and Infancy Factors
Health-related behaviors during and 
after pregnancy that were included 
were whether the mother smoked 
during pregnancy, ever breastfed 
the child, and introduced solid foods 
before 4 months of age. Motor delay 
in infancy (9 months) was estimated 
based on delay compared with 
the rest of the cohort in any key 
motor skills (sitting, crawling, and 
standing). 
22
Early Childhood Factors
Mother’s BMI at age 3 (sweep 2) was 
estimated from self-reported height 
and weight. Early childhood factors 
included markers of diet, physical 
activity, and sleep at age 5 years. 
Dietary factors were whether the 
child drank mainly sugary drinks 
(eg, cola, milkshakes, fruit juice) in 
between meals, ate <3 portions of 
fruit a day, and regularly skipped 
breakfast. Sports participation (less 
than once per week) was included 
as a marker of physical activity. 
Television viewing for >3 hours 
a day was included as a marker 
of sedentary behavior. Whether 
the cohort member had a regular 
bedtime and, if so, whether this 
bedtime was late (9 PM or later at age 
5 years) were included as markers of 
sleep.
Psychosocial Well-Being Outcomes
At age 11, markers of psychosocial 
well-being included socioemotional 
difficulties and skills (as indicated 
by the parent-reported Strengths 
and Difficulties Questionnaire 
23), 
including emotional symptoms, 
conduct problems, hyperactivity, 
peer problems, and prosocial 
behavior. Higher emotional 
symptoms, conduct problems, 
hyperactivity, and peer problem 
scores indicate more difficulties, 
whereas high prosocial scores 
indicate better outcomes. Cohort 
members themselves reported 
on antisocial activity (stealing, 
being noisy or rude in public 
spaces, damaging public property), 
exploratory health behaviors (ever 
having smoked cigarettes and ever 
having drank alcohol), self-esteem 
(as indicated by the Rosenberg self-
esteem scale, with lower scores 
indicating worse outcomes), 
 
24 and 
happiness (as indicated by a 6-item 
measure of “happiness” with school 
work, appearance, family, friends, 
school, and life as a whole, with 
responses to each item on a 7-point 
scale from completely happy to not 
at all happy, α = 0.83). 
25 Additionally, 
the marker of body satisfaction 
(happiness with appearance) from 
the happiness scale was examined as 
a separate item.
Analysis
Trajectories of BMI development 
were identified via Latent Class 
Growth Analysis in Mplus, 
 
26 
with full information maximum 
likelihood estimation to account 
for missing BMI data at any time 
point. The selection of the number of 
trajectories to explore in additional 
analyses was based on a range of 
criteria including model comparison 
(Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio 
test, likelihood ratio difference), 
improvement in information criteria 
(Akaike information criterion, 
adjusted Bayesian information 
criterion [A-BIC]), neatness of 
classification (entropy index), 
and theoretical interest. 
27, 
 
28 The 
4-trajectory model was chosen 
for additional analysis (A-BIC plot 
indicated a clear flattening of A-BIC 
subsequent to the 4-trajectory 
model, entropy of 0.88 suggested 
satisfactory neatness of classification, 
likelihood ratio difference indicated 
highly significant improvement 
in model fit [P < .001], and Lo–
Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test 
indicated that 4- versus 3-class was 
an improvement [P < .10], whereas 
≥5-class was not [P > .50]).
Once trajectories had been derived, 
in the next stage, multiple imputation 
was carried out to ensure that no 
data were excluded in analysis 
because of missingness on the 
predictors of interest while also 
maintaining the survey structure 
in the data. During imputation 
the trajectory group of subjects 
was also included alongside all 
the other covariates to inform the 
imputation. Overall, 14.6% of data 
points across the entire sample, 
including the sociodemographic, 
infancy, childhood, and age 11 
outcome variables, were missing.

KELLY et al 
The proportion of data missing 
varied by variable; for example, 
no cases were missing for gender, 
0.1% were missing for income, and 
0.6% were missing for ethnicity 
(not imputed) on the lower end, and 
28.5% were missing for the Strengths 
and Difficulties Questionnaire 
and 29.6% were missing for self-
esteem at age 11 years on the 
higher end. Missingness on markers 
of psychosocial well-being was 
consistently lowest for subjects in 
the “moderate increasing” BMI group 
(average missing 18.9%), followed by 
the “stable” group (average missing 
28.7%), and the “high increasing” 
BMI group (average missing 30.2%), 
and the highest missingness was 
observed in children in the smallest 
group, with decreasing BMI over 
childhood (average missing 35.8%).
Guided by best practice, 
 
29 we carried 
out 25 imputations and used them in 
subsequent analysis. Supplemental 
Table 4 provides information on the 
nonimputed and imputed descriptive 
statistics for all variables in the study.
Predictors of membership to different 
trajectory groups were investigated 
via multivariate multinomial 
logistic regressions comparing 
the decreasing and increasing 
trajectories to the reference group 
(the largest, “stable” trajectory). 
Psychosocial outcomes at age 11 
(socioemotional difficulties and skills, 
antisocial behaviors, exploratory 
risky behaviors, self-esteem, 
and happiness) were examined 
by trajectory group to ascertain 
whether different trajectories were 
associated with different outcomes. 
Sociodemographic variables were 
adjusted for in these analyses, and 
we present odds ratios for potential 
predictors that are independent of 
all factors. In addition, we carried out 
sensitivity analysis for participants 
with data on markers of puberty, but 
this analysis did not alter estimates 
and is not reported.
RESULTS
Of the 16 936 participants with BMI 
data in any of the sweeps, 48.8% 
(n = 8259) were girls. Most of the 
sample (83.8%) had an average 
nonoverweight BMI (the “stable” 
trajectory). The smallest decreasing 
trajectory group (0.6%) had BMIs 
in the obese range at age 3 but 
were similar to the stable group by 
age 7. The “moderate increasing” 
group (13.1%) had average BMIs 
in the nonoverweight range at age 
3 and subsequent average BMIs 
that increased throughout the rest 
of childhood into the overweight 
but not obese range. The “high 
increasing” trajectory (2.5%) had 
average BMIs in the obese range at 
age 3, and their BMIs continued to 
increase throughout childhood 
( 
Fig 1).
What Factors Predict BMI Trajectory 
Membership?
 
Table 1 shows the distribution of 
predictor variables by BMI trajectory 
group. Fully adjusted estimates, 
simultaneously taking account of 
all variables, are shown in  
Table 2. 
Sociodemographic variations in 
trajectory membership were seen. 
Girls were more likely to be in the 
“moderate increasing” group (odds 
ratio [OR] = 1.36) and less likely to be 
in the “decreasing” trajectory (OR = 
0.44). Indian, Pakistani, and black 
African children were significantly 
more likely to have a “moderate 
increasing” trajectory (ORs = 1.66, 
1.29, and 2.01, respectively), and 
Pakistani, black Caribbean, and black 
African children were more likely 
to belong to the “high increasing” 
group (ORs = 1.83, 3.44, and 3.39, 
respectively). Compared with cohort 
members in the affluent income 
quintile, those in the other 4 income 
groups had higher odds of being 
in the “moderate increasing” BMI 
group. Low maternal educational 
attainment compared with degree or 
higher levels predicted membership 
of increasing trajectories (GCSE 
grades A–C and D–G “moderate 
increasing” ORs = 1.32 and 1.42, 
respectively; GCSE grades A–C and no 
qualifications “high increasing” ORs = 
1.79 and 1.74, respectively).
Cohort members whose mothers 
smoked during pregnancy had higher 
odds of being in the “moderate 
increasing” and “high increasing”

trajectories (ORs = 1.17 and 1.97, 
respectively). Breastfeeding and 
the early introduction of solid food 
were not independently associated 
with trajectory membership. Having 
motor (sitting, standing, crawling) 
delays in infancy were associated 
with higher odds of being in the 
“high increasing” group (OR = 1.47). 
A unit increase in maternal BMI was 
associated with a 10% increase in 
the odds of being in the “moderate 
increasing” and “high increasing” 
trajectories. Skipping breakfast and 
having nonregular bedtimes in early 
childhood were associated with 
higher odds of increasing trajectory 
membership (for “moderate 
increasing, 
” skipping breakfast 
OR = 1.66, nonregular bedtimes OR = 
1.22; for “high increasing, 
” ORs = 1.76 
and 1.55, respectively). Sugary drink 
consumption, fruit intake, television 
viewing, and sports participation 
appeared not to predict trajectory 
membership.
Are BMI Trajectories Linked to 
Psychosocial Well-Being at the Start 
of Adolescence?
Compared with the “stable” group, 
cohort members in the “moderate 
increasing” group had worse 
scores for emotional symptoms, 
peer problems, happiness, body 
satisfaction, and self-esteem but 
had better prosocial behavior 
scores. Cohort members in the “high 
increasing” group had worse scores 
for emotional symptoms, peer and 
conduct problems, happiness, body 
satisfaction, and self-esteem and 
were more likely to have drank 
alcohol and smoked cigarettes. 
In addition, cohort members in 
the “moderate increasing” group 
were more likely to have scores 
in the clinical range for emotional 
and peer problems, and those in 
the “high increasing” group were 
more likely to have scores in the 
clinical range for emotional, peer, 
and conduct problems (data not 
shown). Belonging to the decreasing 
trajectory did not appear to predict 
any significantly different outcomes 
at age 11 years. The distributions of 
psychosocial well-being markers are 
shown in  
Table 1, and fully adjusted 
estimates by BMI trajectory are 
shown in  
Table 3.
DISCUSSION
In this large population-based 
sample of children we identified 4 
BMI development trajectories. The 
majority of children belonged to a 
stable, nonoverweight group. About 
1 in 7 belonged to a group with 
increasing BMIs with average BMIs 
just under the overweight range at 
age 3 and subsequent average BMIs 
increasing throughout the rest of 
childhood into the overweight but 
not obese range. A smaller group 
(2.5%) had average BMIs in the 
obese range at age 3, and their BMIs 
continued to increase throughout 
childhood. A small group (<1%) of 
children had BMIs in the obese range 
at age 3, but by age 7 their BMIs were 
in the nonoverweight range. Factors 
that predicted membership in the 2 
increasing BMI trajectories included 
socioeconomic disadvantage, 
being from certain ethnic minority 
backgrounds, maternal smoking 
during pregnancy, maternal BMI, 
and family routines, such as skipping 
breakfast and not having regular 
bedtimes. We found that, in general, 
having BMIs in the overweight and 
obese range throughout childhood 
was associated with worse 
psychosocial well-being at 11 years 
of age.
Similar to other reports, a large 
proportion of our study sample had 
BMIs in the nonoverweight range 
throughout childhood,

11 and 
we identified groups of children 
belonging to BMI trajectories in 
the overweight or obese range. We 
found a small proportion of children 
in a decreasing trajectory that has 
been seen elsewhere. 
7 We did not 
identify a group of children with 
BMIs consistently in the underweight 
range. There were differences from 
other reports also; for example, some 
studies have identified groups of 
children who develop overweight

Our findings suggest that a range 
of early life factors are associated 
with children being on particular 
BMI trajectories. As found in other 
studies, we show sociodemographic 
factors including socioeconomic

to be linked to membership of 
trajectories in the overweight and 
obese range. Other work from 
the United Kingdom has shown 
variations in the risk of overweight 
and obesity for children from black 
and South Asian groups and for 
children living in economically 
disadvantaged circumstances.13,

of family routines such as skipping 
breakfast and sleep schedules. 
11 
Exposure to tobacco products during 
fetal life has long been thought to 
increase the risk of overweight 
in childhood, 
 
33 and hypothesized 
pathways include altered growth and 
weight gain, metabolic processes, 
and epigenetic mechanisms. 
Previous work suggests links 
between fetal tobacco exposure 
and infant motor coordination, 
 
34 
and this link in turn could be on 
a developmental pathway to BMI 
growth. 
35 Maternal BMI appears 
strongly predictive of children’s 
BMI growth, probably reflecting 
the wider obesogenic environment 
along with genetic predisposition. 
Disrupted routines, exemplified 
here by nonregular sleep schedules 
and skipping breakfast, are 
hypothesized to influence weight 
gain via increased appetite and 
consumption of energy-dense foods. 
Interestingly, skipping breakfast 
was also associated with being in 
the “decreasing” trajectory, but 
the potential mechanisms at play 
here are not clear. We cannot rule 
out, nor were we able to tease out, a 
bidirectional relationship between 
BMI growth and psychosocial well-
being. As in previous work, 
14, 
 
16, 
 
17 
our findings suggest that 
trajectories in the overweight 
and obese range correlate 
strongly with worse psychosocial 
outcomes, and it may be that the 
strength of these associations 
increases as adolescence proceeds, 
as suggested elsewhere. 
14, 
 
15 
Social stigmatization, isolation, 
and victimization are factors 
hypothesized to form links 
between overweight and negative 
psychosocial outcomes and 
the exploration of risky health 
behaviors. Thus, we found that 
common psychosocial correlates 
of “moderate increasing” and “high 
increasing” BMI trajectories were 
socioemotional difficulties, low self-
esteem, low overall happiness, and 
body dissatisfaction. In addition, 
children with BMIs in the obese 
range throughout childhood (the 
“high increasing” group) were 
more likely to report having drunk 
alcohol and smoked cigarettes.
This study has distinct strengths, 
being the first to examine nationally 
representative UK data with 
repeated measures allowing for 
the empirical derivation of BMI 
trajectories across the first decade 
of life. We estimated associations 
between a wide range of early 
life factors, including mother’s 
health behaviors (smoking during 
pregnancy, infant feeding, and 
BMI), infant motor skills, family 
routines, diet, and physical activity 
in relation to different patterns of 
BMI development. Another strength 
is that we examined identified BMI 
trajectories in conjunction with a 
range of markers of psychosocial 
well-being, such as socioemotional 
difficulties, self-esteem, happiness, 
and risky behaviors. This study 
has important potential limitations 
too. For example, even though we 
included in our analyses a wide 
range of potential risk factors, we 
were not able to fully characterize 
influences (including gestational 
diabetes and growth in infancy) 
that might play a role. Imperfect 
measurement was also a feature 
for some of our early life predictor 
variables, such as sugary drinks, 
fruit consumption, and markers 
of physical activity including 
sports participation and television 
viewing, all of which had no 
apparent link with BMI trajectories; 
however, these markers are 
crude, and conclusions based on 
null findings should be avoided. 
Furthermore, these data on early 
life predictors were mother 
reported. However, data were 
collected contemporaneously, 
thus minimizing problems of recall 
bias.
CONCLUSIONS
Most children in this contemporary 
UK study belonged to BMI 
trajectories in the nonoverweight 
range. Several potentially 
modifiable early life factors, 
including smoking in pregnancy 
and family routines (skipping 
breakfast and not having a regular 
bedtime), appeared important in 
predicting BMIs in the overweight 
and obese ranges. These findings 
support the need for intervention 
strategies aimed at multiple 
spheres of influence on BMI growth. 
In general, having BMI growth in 
the overweight and obese range 
was linked to poorer psychosocial 
well-being, supporting the need 
for health care providers to 
monitor these occurrences in 
children with high BMI growth.

could alter trajectories and have 
important implications for physical 
health, psychosocial well-being, 
and health behaviors across the life 
course.
