in deep than in superficial CA1

Environmental cues affect place cells responses, but whether this information is integrated
versus segregated in distinct hippocampal cell populations is unclear. Here, we show that, in
mice running on a treadmill enriched with visual-tactile landmarks, place cells are
more strongly controlled by landmark-associated sensory inputs in deeper regions of
CA1 pyramidal layer (CA1d). Many cells in CA1d display several firing fields correlated with
landmarks, mapping positions slightly before or within the landmarks. Supporting direct
involvement of sensory inputs, their firing fields show instantaneous responses to landmark
manipulations, persist through change of context, and encode landmark identity and saliency.
In contrast, cells located superficially in the pyramidal layer have single firing fields, are
context specific and respond with slow dynamics to landmark manipulations. These findings
suggest parallel and anatomically segregated circuits within CA1 pyramidal layer, with
variable ties to landmarks, allowing flexible representation of spatial and non-spatial
information.

nvironmental cues play a prominent role in the implemen-
tation of hippocampal place cells, with the manipulation of
maze walls and objects inducing the reconfiguration or
remapping of place fields1–5. Yet, place cells are not tied only to
environmental cues, but are also controlled by factors such as
travel distance, speed, goal, time and memory6–10. To what extent
this diverse information is integrated versus segregated in distinct
hippocampal cells populations is unclear. To date, place cells have
been generally investigated as a single mechanism within a given
CA region. However, in the CA1 region particularly, the
anatomical data suggest that several mechanisms might be
present and segregated.
First, different information reaches CA1 through segregated
pathways and target specific CA1 sub-regions. Non-spatial
information from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC)11–16 and
spatial information from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)17,18
target the proximal and distal regions of CA1, respectively19,20,
underlying differences in place field tuning along the proximo-
distal axis11,21. And along the radial axis of CA1 pyramidal layer,
the deep layer (CA1d, bordering oriens) receives about 2.5 times
more CA2 inputs than the superficial layer (CA1s, bordering
radiatum)22. This comes in addition to differences in local circuits,
molecular expression23 and physiological properties, with notably
CA1d and CA1s pyramidal cells showing differences in number of
place fields, bursting activity, spike phase relationship with theta/
gamma oscillations24, reward influence25 and firing activity during
ripples oscillations26,27. Second, CA1 intrinsic connectivity is well
suited for functional division, compared with CA3 for instance.
The CA3 network is highly recurrent, with CA3-to-CA3 inputs
largely outnumbering inputs from the entorhinal cortex and
dentate gyrus20. In contrast, the CA1 network is mainly a feed-
forward network with almost no inter-connections between
pyramidal cells, allowing cell groups to behave independently
and even to compete via feed-forward inhibition28. Accordingly,
when a subset of environmental cues is moved, cells in CA1 split in
two groups, in line with the altered and the stationary cues5, while
CA3 cells respond in a coherent manner.
Place cells are typically studied in open arena and maze
environments rich with visual cues (maze/room cues, walls,
corners), which can pose a problem for discerning place
field mechanisms. For example, cells called landmark-vector cells
(LV cells) display several place fields correlated with the position
of objects in maze, with all fields encoding the same vector
relation with the objects29. Identifying all cells using this
mechanism
is
difficult
in
typical
cue-rich
environments,
considering that cues other than objects might be encoded.
Therefore, a simplified landscape is desirable for dissecting place
field mechanisms. Ideally, landmarks should be sensed one at a
time, and the animal’s trajectory through the landmarks should
be consistent over many trials. For this purpose, we used
a treadmill apparatus, in which the only useful landmarks were
small objects fixed on the belt, and in which mice ran with their
head restrained30. We recorded in both hippocampal CA1 and
CA3 regions using multi-site silicon probes, and we examined
the impact of landmarks and landmark manipulations on the
firing fields of pyramidal cells.
We observe two fundamentally distinct groups of cells in CA1.
In one group, cells are akin to landmark-vector cells as they
exhibit
several
fields
with
similar
distance
relationship
to landmarks, and are referred to as LV cells for convenience.
Cells in the other group are labelled context-modulated cells
(or CM cells) since they exhibit single firing fields specific to
a particular layout of objects on the belt. We show that LV cells
are by an order of magnitude more frequent in CA1 than in CA3,
and concentrate in the deep portion of CA1 pyramidal layer.
In support to a larger involvement of sensory inputs compared
with CM cells, LV cells are active across different environments
and show instantaneous responses to object manipulation.
We also show that LV cells discriminate landmarks based on
their identity and that the probability for a landmark to be
represented depends on its saliency. These findings demonstrate
a functional organization of place field mechanisms, and bring
new insights to the underlying mechanisms of landmark-vector
representation.

Context-modulated

and
landmark-vector
cells.
To
investigate
the
impact
of
various
landmarks,
we
trained
head-fixed mice to run for water rewards on a long treadmill belt
(1.8–2.3 m) displaying a particular layout of landmarks (Fig. 1a).
Importantly, the treadmill was not motorized, but consisted
of a light velvet belt resting on two 3D printed wheels, which mice
moved themselves at will30. The landmarks were fixed on the belt
and were composed of vertically erected flexible objects or
horizontally laid objects, lined along the edges of the belt,
providing visual-tactile stimulation to both sides of the mice
without interfering with their locomotion. We used four types of
landmarks, of identical lengths (10 cm) but contrasting colours,
textures and heights: an array of B3 cm high glue spines, an array
of horizontal shrink tubes, an array of pieces of Velcro and an
array of vertical tubes. To detect possible cell activity associated
with a given landmark, each landmark was fixed to at least
two locations on the belt. After three weeks of training, we
performed recordings from the pyramidal layers of the CA1 and
CA3 hippocampal regions using either one or two 8-shank silicon
probes (64 channels) (Fig. 1b, see ‘Methods’ section). The total
number of trials (complete rotation of the belt) performed during
the recording sessions varied from 47 to 291 (89.3±21.2,
mean±s.e.m).
We
recorded
a
total
of
2084
neurons
(CA1, 1450; CA3, 636), during 36 recording sessions (CA1, 25;
CA3, 11), in 23 different mice (CA1, 16; CA3, 7) following
standard
criteria
for
unit
detection
and
clustering31–33
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with a previous report30,
a fraction of the cells active in the treadmill exhibited stable firing
fields in specific positions on the belt. Among those cells, we
noticed two types of activity: cells that selectively discharged in
one specific area of the belt (Fig. 1c,d), which we will refer to as
CM cells; and, cells that exhibited firing fields tightly coupled to
the landmarks on the belt, repeating in similar fashion at multiple
landmark positions, in several cases regardless of landmark types
(Fig. 1c,d, see ‘Methods’ section). Because of similarities with
the LV cells3,29 previously reported in 2D environments, we will
refer to this second group as LV cells.
Distinct anatomical organization of CM and LV cells. We
first compared the distributions of CM cells and LV cells across
CA1 and CA3 regions. In contrast to CA1 cells, CA3 cells mostly
exhibited single fields (CA1 n ¼ 299, CA3 n ¼ 85) and contained
very few LV cells (CA1 n ¼ 209, CA3 n ¼ 5). The distributions
were significantly different (P ¼ 0, w2 null hypothesis of inde-
pendence, w2 ¼ 119.7, degrees of freedom: k ¼ 2).
Within CA1, we examined the cell’s locations along the radial
axis of CA1 pyramidal layer, since distinct patterns of gene
expression, connections and firing activity were reported in the
superficial (CA1s, closer to S. Radiatum) and deep (CA1d, closer
to S. Oriens) portions of the layer23–28. For this, we first estimated
the position of each cell relative to the shank of the silicon probe,
based on spike amplitude distribution across the recording
sites (Fig. 2a–c; Supplementary Fig. 2, see ‘Methods’ section).
Then, since each shank likely reached a different depth of the
CA1 pyramidal layer, we estimated for each shank the position of

 the recording site with maximum ripple power, and expressed
cell depths in terms of distance from that position24. We observed
that LV cells were concentrated in a deeper part of the layer than
CM cells, as LV were located on average 4.4±2.8 mm above ripple
peak position while CM cells reside on average � 8.2±3.2 mm
below (Fig. 2d, LV cells: n ¼ 62, CM cells: n ¼ 83, t143 ¼ 2.7,
P ¼ 0.0077, two-tailed unpaired t-test). To confirm these findings
with an alternative method not involving the ripple peak
estimation, we estimated the position of cell types relative to
each other, by considering only shanks that contained cells of the
two types. For each shank, we computed the difference in depth
for all possible pairs between the two cell types. LV cells were
systematically higher on the shanks than CM cells, by 20.1 mm
on average (Fig. 2e, n ¼ 538 pairs, t537 ¼ � 18.7, Po0.0001,
one-tailed t-test), meaning that LV cells were located deeper
in the pyramidal layer compared with CM cells, consistent
with LV cells occupying CA1d and CM cells belonging mainly
to CA1s.
We then examined the distribution along the proximo-distal axis
(Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 2, see ‘Methods’ section), since the
relative proportion of LEC over MEC inputs is reported to increase
toward the distal region11,19. Yet, both cell types could be found
over the whole proximo-distal axis (LV distribution: n ¼ 123,
P ¼ 0.12, CM distribution: n ¼ 89, P ¼ 0.96, Kolmogorov–Smirnov
uniformity test) with no significant difference in cumulative
distribution between the two cell types (Fig. 2f, P ¼ 0.24,
unpaired Kolmogorov–Smirnov test).
Landmark specificity. In previous studies on LV cells, the land-
marks used were all different, and it was unclear if the landmarks
encoded by a given LV cell were selected based on their physical
identity, their saliency, or their location. We found that the identity
of landmarks was encoded in a subset of LV cells, as their firing
activity was stronger or exclusive to the positions of a particular
landmark (Fig. 3a). To quantify this, we considered sessions
(n ¼ 6 sessions from four mice) in which the belt contained two
landmarks of similar size (spines and vertical tubes). We first
identified for each cell the strongest firing field and called the
landmark it encoded dominant landmark (versus secondary land-
mark for the other) (Fig. 3b). We defined an identity index as the
difference, after normalization, in peak firing rates between domi-
nant and secondary landmarks, considering only the smallest field
of the dominant landmark and the largest field of the secondary
landmark (Fig. 3b). An index value above zero indicates that all
fields encoding the dominant landmark have higher peak rates than
any of the fields encoding the secondary landmark. Large index
values (close to 1) correspond to large rate differences between the
two landmarks. We found that 49% (55/113 cells) of LV cells had
identity indexes above zero, with 35 cells (63%) encoding the tubes
and 20 cells (37%) encoding the spines. To test the significance, we
compared the distribution of identity indexes with a shuffled
distribution, obtained from a bootstrap procedure where the
landmark identity of the fields for each cell was shuffled 10,000
times (Fig. 3b). A total of 21 cells (19%) had indexes exceeding the
95th percentile of the shuffled distribution (expected, 5.47 cells,
P ¼ 10� 7, Binomial test). Among these, 12 cells encoded the tubes
while 9 cells encoded the spines, indicating that the underlying
mechanism for specificity was the distinct identity of the landmarks
and not simply a larger saliency of one of the landmarks.
Furthermore, we found that landmark saliency also played
a key role. In another subset of recording sessions (CA1, n ¼ 8
sessions from six mice) where the belt contained landmarks of
diverse sizes (spines, Velcro, glue drops), we found that the
spines, which likely provided the most intense visual and tactile
stimulation because of their 3 cm height (compared with 5 mm at
most for the other landmarks), were represented from 10 to
30 times more than other landmarks (Fig. 3c, (all) spine-versus-
other pairs, n ¼ 8, spine versus glue: t14 ¼ 3.48, P ¼ 0.0037, spine
versus tube: t14 ¼ 3.46, P ¼ 0.0038, spine versus Velcro: t14 ¼ 3.36,
P ¼ 0.0047, two-tailed unpaired t-tests).
Field-to-landmark distance and field shape. Fields encoding
distances to landmarks should form a continuum to map the
whole environment. We observed that in LV cells, the distances

 between fields and landmarks varied from one cell to another
(Fig. 4a) in a seemingly continuous manner, but within an
asymmetric distribution relative to the landmarks, mapping only
positions where the mice could presumably see or touch the
landmarks: while a substantial fraction of cells (48/209 cells, 23%)
were anticipatory, that is, encoded positions up to 13 cm before
the landmarks, the majority of the cells (161/209, 77%) encoded
specific positions inside the landmarks, and virtually no cell
encoded positions after the landmarks (Fig. 4b). Importantly,
the field-to-landmark distances were preserved across all field
repetitions in individual cells, as evidenced by a significant
correlation between the different field-to-landmark distances
(n ¼ 399, r ¼ 0.56, Po0.0001, Pearson coefficient, Fig. 4c).
Likewise, the field amplitude (peak rate) was maintained
across field repetitions (n ¼ 399, r ¼ 0.95, Po0.0001, Pearson
coefficient, Fig. 4d).
We next compared the field dimensions of LV cells and
CM cells. The average shape and amplitude of LV fields
(10% edges width: 34.71±1.09 cm, amplitude: 5.77±1.41 Hz)
was very similar to the average shape and amplitude of CM fields
(10% edges width: 33.17±0.94 cm, amplitude: 5.51±0.96 Hz,
Fig. 4e,f, LV: n ¼ 299, CM: n ¼ 209, t506 ¼ 0.14, P ¼ 0.89,
two-tailed unpaired t-test). Importantly, theta phase precession
was present for both types of cells, with equivalent magnitudes
and rates (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Changing the belt. Place fields are generally specific to the
context, with small changes of contextual cues inducing rate
remapping and larger changes producing global remapping. To
test the context specificity of LV and CM cells, we performed
consecutive recordings of the same cells in two different belts
(belt A and belt B), which had distinct lengths and landscapes of
objects (Fig. 5a).
First, we looked if cells could switch types between the two
belts. For this, we compared for each cell the object scores in
belt A and belt B. No CM cell was seen to convert into a LV cell
from belt A to belt B, and conversely, no LV cell converted into
a CM cell (Fig. 5b). Second, we asked how the firing rate activity
was affected by the change of belt. LV cells firing activity was
quite robust across the belts, with most LV cells showing firing
fields
in
the
two
belts.
This
was
despite
the
fact
that
the landmarks used in the two belts were different, implying
that LV cells encoded distinct landmarks in belt A and belt B

 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, CM cells tend to be selective to one of the
belts. Consistent with this, the fields’ amplitudes were highly
correlated between the two belts for LV cells (n ¼ 53, A/A0:
r ¼ 0.90, Po0.0001, Pearson coefficient. A/B: r ¼ 0.81, Po0.0001,

r ¼ 0.76, Po0.0001, Pearson coefficient. A/B: r ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.083,
Pearson coefficient) (Fig. 5d). To further quantify this, we
estimated for each cell the rate overlap between the belts34,
defined as the ratio of peak rates between belt A and belt B
(belt A over belt B if belt B has the largest peak rate, and
vice versa). The rate overlap of LV cells was significantly higher
than for CM cells between belt A and B (Fig. 5e, LV: n ¼ 53,
CM: n ¼ 46, t97 ¼ � 4.11, Po0.001, two-tailed unpaired t-test).
Finally, we examined if LV cells field-to-landmark distances
were affected. Field-to-landmark distances tended to remain
the same, showing a small but significant correlation between the

A/B: r ¼ 0.27, P ¼ 0.046, Pearson coefficient) (Fig. 5f). This
was despite the fact that the landmarks were different, suggesting
that
the mechanisms
underlying
landmark
specificity
and
field-to-landmark distances are independent.
Instant dynamics of LV cells. The mechanisms underlying
place field remapping have mostly been studied at low temporal
resolution, without taking into account the heterogeneous types
of place cells. To investigate these mechanisms, we either
removed a spine landmark, or added an extra one to the belt,
at a given point in the recording session.
We first examined the impact of these manipulations on
LV cells. LV fields tightly depended on the presence of the
landmark, as they disappeared instantly when the landmark was
removed (Fig. 6a, 3 sessions from 3 mice, n ¼ 11 cells). The firing
rate measured in the landmark vicinity (by averaging the
firing rate in a 30 cm window around the landmark) reached
on average its asymptotic floor level the first trial the mice
experienced the landmark absence (Fig. 6b). Moreover, traces of
field activity could not be detected in individual cells after the
landmark removal, with the firing rate value in each cell reaching
the background level, defined as the mean firing rate in the
two 15 cm windows flanking the 30 cm window centred around
the landmark (Fig. 6c). Importantly, the fields in the remaining
locations of the landmark maintained the same firing rate
intensity throughout the session (Fig. 6a,b).
When an extra spine landmark was added to the belt, new
fields were created instantly in all LV cells (Fig. 6a–c, 4 sessions
from 3 mice, n ¼ 26 cells), with the same field-to-landmark
distance and peak amplitude as pre-existing fields. The emergence
of the new fields was immediate, with the firing rate in the
landmark vicinity reaching on average its asymptotic value on
the first trial the mice experienced the added landmark (Fig. 6b).
At the level of individual cells, the field-to-landmark distance
relation was also apparent from the first trial (Fig. 6d), suggesting
altogether a pre-configuration of the underlying circuits. To test
further this idea, we examined the change in LV cells population
vector activity over time, by computing the population vector in
each trial, for positions within a 30 cm window around the added
landmarks, and then correlating this with a reference population
vector computed using late-session trials (trials 40 to 80,
see ‘Methods’ section). This analysis indicated an instant switch
of population activity to near stable state (Fig. 6e).
The landmarks involved so far were familiar to the mice due to
the 3 weeks training period. To see how novel landmarks were
represented, we added during the session a novel landmark
(vertical plastic tubes) that the mice had never encountered,
at two positions of the belt (Fig. 6a, 3 sessions, 3 animals). In
a fraction of cells (26/289 recorded cells, 9%), two firing fields
appeared instantly at the landmark locations. The emergence of
the fields was instantaneous, with the firing rate intensity
reaching
on
average
asymptotic
value
on
the
first
trial
(Fig. 6a,b). As in the familiar spine landmark experiments, the
field-to-landmark distance relation was apparent from the first
trial (Fig. 6d), suggesting that the mechanism underlying field-to-
landmark distances does not depend on landmark familiarity. At
the population level, the evolution of the population vector was
similar to the one for familiar landmark addition (Fig. 6e).
Slower dynamics of CM cells. We next investigated the remap-
ping dynamics of CA1 and CA3 CM cells subsequent to landmark
manipulation. Since these effects were similar for familiar and
novel landmarks, we pooled the data from both experiments.
While the addition of landmarks had no impact on a fraction of
CA1 (n ¼ 70, 35.53%) and CA3 (n ¼ 24, 37.84%) place cells,
they triggered field reconfiguration in a large number of cells
(CA1, n ¼ 127, 64.47%; CA3, n ¼ 46, 62.16%). In contrast to
LV cells, this remapping process was slow and involved distinct
dynamics, including ‘switching’ and ‘drifting’, as they were
characterized, respectively, by the gradual emergence of new place
fields in initially silent cells (CA1, n ¼ 80; CA3, n ¼ 25) (Fig. 7a;
Supplementary Fig. 4), and gradual drifts of pre-existing place
fields (CA1, n ¼ 47; CA3, n ¼ 21) (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 4).
The switching process (Fig. 7a) was neither immediate, nor
synchronous across the cell group, but instead was spread over
time, with some cells turning ON in the first trial following
landmark addition, and others several trials later (up to 68 trials
after addition) (Fig. 7c). The temporal rate of field creation
followed nevertheless an apparent exponential decay, with most
fields being created in the initial trials while gradually less
during subsequent trials. Similar trends were observed in CA3

 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, the newly created place
fields were gathered in the immediate vicinity of the added
landmarks (Fig. 7d).
On the other hand, pre-existing place fields occasionally started
drifting after the addition of a landmark (Fig. 7b; Supplementary
Fig. 4). To quantify this effect, we tracked the centre of mass of
each place field over the trials (Fig. 7e; Supplementary Fig. 4,
see ‘Methods’ section), and define as drifting the ones that drifted
on average by more than 0.1 cm per trial in one direction. The

(Fig. 7f; Supplementary Fig. 4).
Finally, switching cells and drifting cells were found at distinct
depths along the radial axis of CA1 pyramidal layer, occupying
respectively CA1d and CA1s (Supplementary Fig. 5).

 Discussion
Our findings support an anatomical segregation of LV cells to the
deeper portion of the CA1 pyramidal layer. In vivo physiological
differences
between
CA1d
and
CA1s
were
previously
reported24,27 but focused on spike phase relationships with
theta and gamma rhythms, entrainment by slow wave sleep
rhythms, burst activity, number of place fields and ripple activity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a specific place
field mechanism is matched to a particular region of CA1. In
terms of afferents, CA1d receives most inputs from the region
CA2 (ref. 22) and maybe from the entorhinal cortex24. On the
other hand, CA1s pyramidal cells are relatively more controlled
by CA3 inputs, as they are excited by CA3 stimulations and
sharp-wave ripple events, while CA1d cells exhibits mainly
inhibitory responses27 (presumably through concerted CA3-to-
CA2 and CA1s-to-CA1d feed-forward inhibitions22,28). Hence,
CA1d and CA1s might belong to two distinct streams of
information, CA2-CA1d and CA3-CA1s, respectively. In this
respect, our finding that LV cells are located in CA1d matches
recent evidence of strong object influence on CA2 activity37,38,
and suggest CA2-CA1d as a more sensory stream. In contrast, the
CA3-CA1s stream is likely involving more memory-related
mechanisms because of CA3 extensive recurrent collaterals39,40.
Accordingly, cells in both CA3 and CA1s showed single firing
fields and slower dynamics. Single fields could not arise from
simple visual-tactile sensory mechanisms since every landmark
was repeated at least twice on the belt. It is also unlikely that they
arise from odours on the belt, since in absence of visual-tactile
cues, very few cells have place fields and none retain their position
when the reward location is moved41 (fields correlated either
with travel distance42 or reward distance41). Instead, we suggest
that single firing fields arise within CA3 from the encoding of
conjunctions
between
sensory,
path-integration
and
local
recurrent inputs, and then are relayed to CA1s.
Landmark-vector cells were previously reported in a study
from Deshmuck et al.29, but in smaller proportion than the
LV cells described here. This has several possible explanations.
First, it is possible that a fraction of LV cells failed to be identified
in that study. Indeed, all objects used were different, and
considering our finding that LV cells encode landmarks identity,
it is possible that some LV cells exhibited only single fields
and were therefore missed. In addition, it is possible that some
LV cells were encoding environmental cues other than the
objects, such as maze corners. Second, our landmarks were
designed to provide overwhelming whiskers/body stimulation,
and the mice had to run through the landmarks. Hence, they
likely generated a more intense sensorial stimulation than the
objects used in the study of Deshmuck et al. This should be an
important factor considering our finding that landmark saliency
is critical for LV cell representation. Third, it is possible that the
number of LV cells is inflated in the treadmill because the sensory
information is oversimplified. Indeed, cells probably use a range
of other sensory information in two-dimensional arenas, such as
head direction and distal cues, which might usually compete or
integrate with local landmarks. This might not necessarily be
an artifact of the treadmill, but a difference between one and
two-dimensional environments. Indeed, it is worth noting that in
a study43 where local cues were laid on a linear track, place cells
similar to LV cells were reported in significantly large numbers.
These cells had bidirectional place fields that encoded in
each direction an equidistant position ahead of a landmark,
and were suggested to reflect view-invariant object information.

 Also, in a study where rats had to run through a one-dimensional
zigzag pattern, a large fraction of cells in CA1 showed a repetition
of place fields at equivalent positions of the zigzag trajectory44.
Similar to here, such cells were much less frequent in CA3. Last, it
is possible that the quantitative discrepancy between the two
studies reflects differences between mouse and rat species, since
rats were used in the study of Deshmuck et al. Compared with
rats, mice might use more the local cues over the distal cues45,
resulting in a larger number of LV cells in mice.
Our results provide new insights on the mechanisms under-
lying LV cells. LV firing fields were closely associated with
sensory mechanisms, as they showed repetitions and instant
dynamics, but encoded both spatial (landmark distance) and
non-spatial
information
(landmark
identity
and
saliency).
While non-spatial object information is believed to reach the
hippocampus via LEC14,15, spatial information might come from
MEC inputs. Hence, a possible scenario is that LV cell activity
emerges
from
an
interaction
of
LEC
and
MEC
inputs,
contributing respectively the landmark specificity and landmark
distance aspects. For instance, considering that grid cells reset and
activate at similar distances in the repeated alleys of a hairpin
maze46, and that border cells activate near boundaries18, it is
possible that some grid cells and border cells encode particular
positions near the landmarks, supplying the hippocampus
with discrete spatial inputs, which sum with the object specific
(but less spatially tuned14,15) inputs from LEC.
In common with LV cells, switching cells were found in the
deep CA1 pyramidal layer (CA1d), and developed new firing
fields near objects added to the belt. This process, however, was
more gradual, with new fields emerging after tens of trials,
suggesting a progressive network buildup involving synaptic
plasticity mechanisms47. It is tempting to see LV cells as part of
a
continuum
with
switching
cells,
expressing
the
largest
prevalence
of
landmark-related
sensory
information
over
contextual information, and being followed by early and then
late switching cells.
More superficially located in the CA1 pyramidal layer, drifting
cells were likely the least controlled by landmarks, as drift of fields
largely suggests a dissociation between field mechanisms and
landmarks inputs. As a mechanism, drifts are reminiscent of
backward shifts in freely moving rat experiments, during initial
maze exploration35 or after cue rotation36, with the difference
that drifts could span up to 100 cm compared with the 2–10 cm of
backward shifts. It has been proposed that backward shifts
emerge from the combination of spike theta phase precession and
the
asymmetric
nature
of
spike
time-dependent
plasticity
(STDP)48,49. Field drifts in the treadmill might also arise from
such mechanisms, and be exclusive to CA1s for a number of
reasons including differences in inputs22 and local circuits28, and
the fact that CA1s pyramidal cells contain calbindin and zinc, two
molecules involved in synaptic plasticity23.
Our findings suggest a functional division between CA1 deep
and superficial layers. While LV cells in the deeper layer supply
sensory mediated representation of self-position and object
locations, cells with looser ties to landmarks tackle spatial
representation on a more global level, using both sensory and
memory information, and may also be more flexible for
integrating non-spatial factors such as reward, goal and time7,9,10.
The coexistence of these distinct place field mechanisms suggests
that diverse types of spatial associations, involving distinct levels
of specificity, precision and portability across environments,
might occur in parallel. The fact that CA1d generates most
CA1 projections to brain regions involved in goal oriented
behaviours (ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, septal area and
orbitofrontal cortex)23 might underlie a behavioural benefit for
reward prediction mechanisms to be linked with discrete cues and
transferable across environments, while CA1s predominant
feedback projections to the medial temporal cortex23 might
contribute the contextual information to episodic memory
processes in this region. Future experiments using selective
inactivation of deep and superficial CA1 cells should help reveal
their relative contribution to memory.
Methods
Animals. All experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional reg-
ulations (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea Institute of
Science and Technology), and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NRC 2011). Overall, 23 male C57BL/6 mice between 6 and
7 weeks were used. The mice were housed 2 to 3 per cage, in a vivarium with
12 h light per dark cycles. Training and recording sessions described next occurred
during the light cycles.
Preparation for head fixation. During a first surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia
(supplemented by subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine 0.1 mg kg � 1, and
followed by daily subcutaneous injection of ketaprofen 5 mg kg � 1 for 2 days), two
small watch-screws were driven into the bone above the cerebellum to serve as
reference and ground electrodes for the recordings. A 3D printed plastic head-plate
with a window opening in the centre was cemented to the skull with dental acrylic.
The head-plate was designed to be conveniently fixed (and unfixed) to a holding
plate using two screws.
Behavioural training. After a post-surgery recovery period of 7 days, the mice
were water restricted to 1 ml of water per day, and trained for 3 to 4 weeks
(1-h session per day) to run on the treadmill with their head fixed. The treadmill
was not motorized, but consisted of a light velvet belt laying on two 3D printed
wheels, which mice moved themselves at will30. Sucrose-in-water (10%) rewards
were delivered every trial at the same position of the belt via a lick port. The lick
port was equipped with a light-emitting diode and photo-sensor couple that
enabled detection of individual licks. Belts of different lengths (ranging from 169 to
234 cm) and displaying different number of cues were used depending on the
experiments. After behavioural learning reached an asymptote, the animals
completed 100 to 150 trials in the first 45 min of the sessions. The quantity of
sucrose-in-water consumed in the treadmill was measured after each session, and
additional water was provided such that the mice drank a total amount of
1 ml day � 1.
Recording procedures. We performed both acute and chronic recordings
(acute, 9 mice, 15 sessions; chronic, 14 mice, 21 sessions). While acute experiments
allowed the usage of higher channel count silicon probes (2 � 64 channels probes),
chronic experiments were necessary, for instance, to record the same cells in
different belts. Since similar results were obtained with both approaches, the two
data sets were pooled.
For acute recordings, on recording days, the mice were initially anaesthhetized
with isoflurane and installed with their heads fixed on the treadmill. Following
a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg � 1), a craniotomy of
B1 mm2 was performed using a stereotaxic manipulator on one of the hemisphere
at a location centred 2.2 mm posterior to bregma and 1.5 mm lateral to the midline,
and the dura was removed (on the subsequent day, the craniotomy was done on the
other hemisphere). The backside of the silicon probes shanks were coated with
a cell labelling red-fluorescent dye (DiI, Life technologies) using the tip of a foam
swab. The silicon probes were then fixed to micro-manipulators and lowered into
the brain at a speed of B50 mm min � 1. The hole was then sealed with liquid agar
(1.5%) applied at near body temperature. Aluminum foil was folded around the
entire probe assembly, to serve as a Faraday cage. After the silicon probes reached
the target area, the anaesthesia was removed. Mice typically recovered from
anaesthesia after 30-45 min and then spontaneously started running in the
treadmill for sucrose-in-water rewards. Recording sessions typically lasted for
70 min, during which the animal’s behaviour alternated between periods of running
and immobility. After each recording session, the probe was removed and the hole
was filled with a mixture of bone wax and mineral oil, and covered with silicon
sealant (WPI, Kwik-sil). Individual mouse was recorded for a maximum of three
sessions (one session per day).
When the mice woke up in the treadmill after the craniotomy/probe insertion
procedures, no signs of distress were visible from either behaviour or local field
potential signals. Behavioural signs of distress, such as mice struggling and
grabbing the side posts, were visible only when mice initially experienced
head-restriction during training, and were completely absent at any stage of the
recording sessions. Typically, after the anaesthesia was turned off, local field
potential progressively started showing quiet sleep associated ripple oscillations.
The first detectable movements were usually occasional lickings, happening during
a period of somnolence/ripple activity. This period was useful for shank
stabilization and for confirming CA1 location by ripple activity. Mice typically
started performing the task as soon as they began to move the belt.

 For chronic recordings, a similar craniotomy was performed under isoflurane
anaesthesia. A silicon probe was mounted on a custom-made micro-drive, and
inserted one millimetre above the pyramidal layer. The micro-drive was cemented
to the skull and head-plate. Bone wax and mineral oil mixture was used to cover
the craniotomy. Then, the silicon probe was slowly lowered to the pyramidal layer
using the micro-drive. A plastic cap was used to protect the micro-drive/silicon
probe assembly. Recordings were performed starting the next day, one session per
day, and for up to three sessions.
Anatomy. On the last day of recording, the animals were anaesthhetized at the end
of the recording and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffer. The brain was removed and kept overnight in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde solution.Overall, 100 mm thick coronal sections were cut using
a vibratome and mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium with dapi.
Images of dapi and DiI fluorescence were acquired separately with a Nikon
FN1 microscope equipped for fluorescence imaging.
Behaviour control and data acquisition. The forward and backward movement
increments of the treadmill were monitored using two pairs of LED and photo-
sensors that read patterns on a disc coupled to the treadmill wheel, while the zero
position was implemented by a LED and photo-sensor couple detecting a small
hole on the belt. From these signals, the mouse position was implemented in real
time by an Arduino board (Arduino Uno, arduino.cc), which also controlled the
valves for the reward delivery. Position, time and reward information from the
Arduino board was sent via USB serial communication to a computer and recorded
with custom-made LabView (National Instruments) programs.
For acute recordings, neurophysiological signals were acquired continuously
at 24,414 Hz on a 128-channels recording system (Tucker-Davis Technologies,
PZ2-128 preamplifier, RZ2 bioamp processor). For chronic recordings,
neurophysiological signals were acquired continuously at 30,000 Hz on
a 250-channels recording system (Intan Technologies, RHD2132 amplifier board
with RHD2000 USB Interface Board and custom-made LabView interface).
The wideband signals were digitally high-pass filtered (0.8–5 kHz) offline for
spike detection or low-pass filtered (0–500 Hz) and down sampled to 1,000 Hz for
local field potentials. Spike sorting was performed semi-automatically, using
KlustaKwik (klustakwik.sourceforge.net)32, followed by manual adjustment of the
clusters with Klusters33. Further data analysis was done in Matlab.
Implementation of single neuron firing rate vector. The length of the belt was
divided into 100 pixels. To generate a vector of firing rates, the number of
spikes discharged in each pixel was divided by the time the animal spent in the
pixel. The firing rate vector was smoothed by convolving a Gaussian function
(15 cm half-height width).
Detection of place fields. To detect place fields, we estimated the significance of
positive humps in firing rate by shuffling spike times. For each shuffle, the spike
train was split in two at a randomly chosen time t, and the two parts were ‘rotated’
by shifting them by þ t and � t, respectively. The goal was to mix the temporal
relation between spikes and behaviour, without affecting the temporal structure of
the spikes. We computed the cells firing rate vectors for 1,000 shuffles. The P-value
of each pixel was given by the percentage of shuffles having a firing rate value
higher than the original data. Place fields were defined as firing rate humps that
contained at least five consecutive pixels with P-values lower than 0.01.
Detection of LV cells. To be classified as a LV cell, a cell should first have a
number of detected place fields greater than 1. We then defined a landmark score
ranging from 0 to 1 as the maximum of the cross-correlogram between the firing
rate vector of the cell and a ‘belt template’. The belt template is an array of zeros
and ones matching the position of the landmarks on the belt (1 inside the land-
marks, 0 otherwise). To detect LV cells, landmark scores were recalculated for cells’
spikes shuffling procedure similar as in the method for place field detection. Cells
with landmark score exceeding the 95th percentile of the shuffle distribution were
defined as LV cells.
Estimation of LV firing rate changes and background level. Landmark
manipulation might induce firing rate changes but also field shifts and broadening.
To avoid a contamination of the measure of firing rate by the latter, we looked at
the evolution of average firing rate considering all pixels within a 30 cm window
centred on the position of the added or removed landmark.
Many cells showed non-zero background firing activity. To disambiguate
between background activity and firing field activity, we subtracted the background
activity, which was defined as the average firing rate in two 15 cm windows flanking
a 30 cm window centred on the landmark.
Drift of place fields. The drift trajectory of place cells was estimated by computing
the position of the field centre of mass after each trial. Neurons exhibiting a drift
rate higher than 0.1 cm per trial constituted the set of drifting cells.
3D reconstruction. Digital pictures of coronal slices DAPI and shanks DiI signals
were loaded into Matlab. The contour of hippocampus CA and the DiI signal
of the silicon probe shanks were detected. The entire hippocampus CA region
and shanks were reconstructed in 3D, and visualized with different rotations
using custom-made Matlab routines. Shank positions along CA1 medio-lateral axis
were estimated as the normalized distance, following CA1 curvature, from the
border of subiculum, where the borders of subiculum and CA2 were respectively
position 0 and 1, and were defined according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas
(see Supplementary Fig. 2)11.
Estimation of cell position relative to the shank. To estimate the position
of a cell relative to the recording sites of a shank, we assumed that the amplitude
of spike signals attenuate as 1/d2 (see note below), where d is the distance of the site
to the cell soma, such that the amplitude measured at a given site is:
ai ¼ A=d2
i
with A the spike amplitude exactly at the cell position.
For the several recording sites of one shank, this means that:
A ¼ a1�d2
1 ¼ a2�d2
2 ¼ a3�d2
3 ¼ a4�d2
4 ¼ a5�d2
5:
Therefore, to estimate the position of a cell, we simply search for the position where
these conditions were fulfilled. For this, the volume around each shank was divided
in 1 mm3 pixels, and for each pixel we computed the Euclidean distances to each
recording site. Then we defined a value S such that:
S ¼
X
ij
ai�d2
i � aj�d2
j
�
�
�
�
�
�
where i and j varied to generate all possible combinations of sites
The pixel with the smallest value of S was defined as the cell position.
Note: Electric potential of dipoles attenuate as 1/d2 while as 1/d for monopoles.
We tested the method using either form and found the resulting cell positions to be
very similar.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in Matlab
(MathWorks). Number of animals and number of recorded cells were similar to
those generally employed. For each distribution, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was
used to test the null hypothesis that the sample distribution was derived from a
standard normal distribution. If normality was uncertain, we used non-parametric
tests as stated in the main text or figures. Otherwise, Student t-tests were used to
test the sample mean. Correlations were computed using Pearson’s correlation
coefficient.
Data availability. The data that were collected for this study are available upon
reasonable request.
