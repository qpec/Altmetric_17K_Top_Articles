ABSTRACT 
4 
Following heat acclimation (HA), endurance running performance remains impaired in hot vs 
5 
temperate conditions. Combining HA with precooling demonstrates no additive benefit in intermittent 
6 
sprint, or continuous cycling exercise protocols, during which heat strain may be less severe compared 
7 
to endurance running. This study investigated the effect of short-term heat acclimation (STHA) 
8 
combined with mixed-methods precooling, on endurance running performance and directly compared 
9 
precooling and HA. Nine amateur trained runners completed 5 km treadmill time trials in the heat 
10 
(32°C, 60% RH) under four conditions; no intervention (CON), precooling (PC), short-term heat 
11 
acclimation (5 days - HA) and short-term heat acclimation with precooling (HA+PC). Mean (±SD) 
12 
performance times were; CON 1476 (173) s, PC 1421 (146) s, HA 1378 (116) s and HA+PC 1373 (121) 
13 
s. This equated to the following improvements versus CON; PC -3.7%, HA -6.6% and HA+PC -7.0%. 
14 
Statistical differences were only observed between HA and CON (p=0.004, d=0.68, 95% CI [-0.27, 1.63]) 
15 
however, similar effect sizes were observed for HA+PC vs CON (d=0.70, 95% CI [-0.25, 1.65]), with 
16 
smaller effects between PC vs CON (d=0.34, 95% CI [-0.59, 1.27]), HA vs PC (d=0.33, 95% CI [-0.60, 
17 
1.26]) and HA+PC vs PC (d=0.36, 95% CI [-0.57, 1.29]). Pilot testing revealed a time trial typical error 
18 
of 16 s (1.2%). Precooling offered no further benefit to performance in the acclimated individual, 
19 
despite modest alleviation of physiological strain. Maintenance of running speed in HA+PC, despite 
20 
reduced physiological strain, may indicate an inappropriate pacing strategy therefore, further 
21 
familiarisation is recommended to optimise a combined strategy. Finally, these data indicate HA, 
22 
achieved through cycle training, yields a larger ergogenic effect than precooling on 5km running 
23 
performance in the heat, although precooling remains beneficial when HA is not possible.

INTRODUCTION 
3 
Strategies to alleviate the deleterious effect of hyperthermia on endurance performance 
4 
habitually adopt a uni-dimensional approach, with athletes advised to either precool or undertake 
5 
heat acclimation (HA) 1. This dichotomous practice persists despite a dearth of direct comparisons 
6 
between acute and chronic strategies, that would indicate the most effective approach. 
7 
From a chronic perspective, HA is habitually classified as either short (STHA, <7 days), medium 
8 
(MTHA, 8-14 days) or long term (LTHA, >15 days) 2. Heat acclimation induces observable and 
9 
prominent adaptations including decreased resting and exercising, core (TCORE) and skin (TSKIN) 
10 
temperatures, alongside a reduction in exercising heart rate (HR), which likely arises through an 
11 
expanded plasma volume 3. Typical ergogenic effects of STHA on endurance performance are reported 
12 
to be 2.4% 4. Such adaptations help mitigate against an accentuated cardiovascular challenge during 
13 
exercising under heat stress, which notably reduces maximal oxygen uptake (V�O2max) as a consequence 
14 
of thermoregulatory cutaneous vasodilation impeding venous return and cardiac filling 5. However, 
15 
evidence demonstrates both endurance performance 6 and V�O2max 7 remain impaired in the heat 
16 
following HA, relative to cooler conditions (13°C vs 38°C 6, 21°C vs 49°C 7), highlighting not only the 
17 
persistence of heat strain, but a need to further improve endurance performance in the acclimated 
18 
individual. 
19 
Acute, precooling techniques may be classified as internal (e.g. ice slurry ingestion) or external 
20 
(e.g. ice vests, ice packs), depending upon how the cooling impulse is delivered. External precooling 
21 
demonstrates larger effects on TSKIN and thermal sensation than internal precooling 8. External 
22 
precooling presents a dose-dependent response, with a mixed-methods approach, involving multiple 
23 
cooling garments and hand/forearm cold water immersion appearing preferable to singular cooling 
24 
 3 
Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
garments, due to the greater cooled skin surface area9. Accordingly, recent meta-analyses report large 
1 
effects on subsequent endurance performance when multiple cooling garments are worn either 
2 
alongside or following part-body cold water immersion (+7.3%, d =0.72 10, d = 1.91 11). Of note, the 
3 
practical mixed methods technique of Duffield et al. 12, involving ice towels, ice packs, ice vest and 
4 
hand immersion in cold water, ameliorates physiological and thermoregulatory strain during fixed 
5 
intensity endurance exercise in the heat 8, but has yet to be evaluated during free-paced exercise, 
6 
where the influence of alterations in TSKIN and thermal perception may be most pronounced 13. 
7 
Despite individual strategies failing to maintain endurance performance in the heat relative to 
8 
normothermic conditions, the benefit of combining interventions is yet to be fully elucidated. Castle 
9 
et al.14 reported no additional benefit from quadriceps precooling during intermittent sprint-cycling, 
10 
following LTHA. Results indicated LTHA alone sufficiently negated heat strain during this type of 
11 
activity. Consequently, Brade et al. 15 investigated precooling following STHA, which affords only 
12 
partial heat adaptation in comparison to LTHA 24. However, no additive effect was observed, with STHA 
13 
again mediating heat strain during intermittent sprinting sufficiently such that precooling was 
14 
unwarranted and thus ineffective. Conversely, continuous running or cycling endurance exercise in 
15 
the heat confers a large and consistent physiological strain 16, which may therefore require a more 
16 
potent intervention than HA alone to ameliorate declines in performance. This notion is reinforced by 
17 
larger effects of precooling observed on endurance performance, compared with intermittent 
18 
sprinting 11. 
19 
Recently Schmit et al. 17 investigated national-level triathletes wearing ice vests at rest and during 
20 
the warm-up prior to a 20 km cycling time trial, following 10-days of acclimatisation. Although the 
21 
addition of precooling did not improve performance above acclimatisation alone, transient, beneficial 
22 
pacing alterations were observed during the first half of the trial, alongside improved perceived 
23 
thermal strain, following precooling. Therefore, a more potent precooling strategy e.g. mixed 
24 
methods12, may magnify or prolong this transient benefit. This transient benefit may also be more 
25 
impactful in a shorter event than the ~32 min trial of Schmit et al. 17, as the effects of precooling will 
26

be experienced for a greater proportion of the event duration before dissipating. A further 
1 
consideration is the type of exercise undertaken, with exercise such as running, that yields a significant 
2 
metabolic heat production (MHP) appearing best suited to combining interventions, given heat strain 
3 
can be mitigated by STHA alone during intermittent sprinting whilst cycling 15. Running elicits a greater 
4 
MHP than cycling and provides less convective cooling 18,19, which collectively expedites heat strain, 
5 
relative to cycling 20. Therefore, when STHA is adopted, affording partial heat adaptation, an additive 
6 
effect from precooling may be observed when heat strain remains high during exercise such as 
7 
endurance running. However, no investigations have combined precooling and HA prior to endurance 
8 
running. 
9 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether mixed methods external precooling 
10 
following STHA provided greater ergogenicity for maintaining endurance running performance, than 
11 
STHA alone, whilst providing a direct comparison between precooling and heat acclimation. It was 
12 
hypothesised that combining STHA and precooling would improve time trial performance relative to 
13 
STHA, whilst STHA would be more beneficial than precooling alone. 
14 
METHODS 
15 
Experimental approach to the problem 
16 
A repeated measures design was adopted, with individuals completing two 5 km treadmill time 
17 
trials and a graded exercise test (GXT) before and after 5 days of STHA, as shown in Figure 1. Each GXT 
18 
was ordered immediately pre and post HA training, whilst time trials (TT) with either precooling (PC) 
19 
or a no intervention control trial (CON) were completed in a counterbalanced order, prior to STHA. 
20 
Experimental trials occurred at least 10 days after instrumented familiarisations of the GXT and TT in 
21 
the heat. Following STHA, a TT was completed without precooling (HA) and another with precooling 
22 
(HA+PC), again counterbalanced (Figure 1). Trials occurred at a similar time of the day to minimise 
23 
fluctuation in thermoregulatory responses from circadian variation 21.

Subjects 
6 
Nine amateur, club runners (8 male, 1 female), who had trained at least three times per week for 
7 
the previous 2 months, volunteered for this study (mean [±SD]: age 32 [16] years, stature 175 [7] cm, 
8 
mass 71.9 [8.8] kg, sum of four skinfolds 25.4 [3.8] mm, V�O2max 59.1 [6.9] mL.kg-1.min-1, recent 5km 
9 
time: 20:44 [1:44] min). Participants were recruited as part of a larger study on heat acclimation 22. All 
10 
participants had completed a sub-22 min 5km or sub 45 min 10km race in the previous 2 months and 
11 
had never previously undertaken HA. The female participant completed pre-tests and training during 
12 
the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, with post-tests during the first 5 days of luteal phase. 
13 
Participants were informed of the benefits and risks of the investigation prior to signing an 
14 
institutionally approved informed consent document to participate in the study. Ethical approval was 
15 
issued in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Participants arrived hydrated, having 
16 
refrained from intense exercise for 48 hours, and avoided alcohol and caffeine for 24 hours. 
17 
Participants completed a 24-hour food diary prior to each test and indicated sleeping hours, 
18 
motivation, muscle soreness and stress on 5-point Likert scales upon arrival.

Procedures 
1 
Precooling 
2 
A mixed-methods, external precooling technique was adopted, as per Duffield et al. 12 and James 
3 
et al. 8. This involved wet, iced towels covering the head and neck, forearm and hand immersion in 
4 
cold water (9°C), an ice vest (Artic Heat, Australia) on the torso and ice packs affixed to the quadriceps 
5 
using cooling shorts, across a 20 min seated period. Towels were changed after 10 min and hand 
6 
immersion water temperature was actively maintained throughout. 
7 
Heat acclimation 
8 
Heat acclimation involved five, 90 min daily training sessions in the heat (~37°C, ~60% relative 
9 
humidity [RH]) using controlled hyperthermia and permissive dehydration23,24. Participants exercised 
10 
on cycle ergometers (Monark, e724, Sweden) at an intensity initially prescribed relative to body mass, 
11 
at 2.7 W.kg-1 25 and subsequently adjusted to maintain the maximum tolerable power to achieve the 
12 
target TCORE (38.5°C) within 30 min. Upon TCORE reaching 38.5°C, exercise was completed intermittently 
13 
to maintain TCORE above 38.5°C for 60 min 23,24. Throughout the training session, exercise intensity was 
14 
adjusted in 5 min blocks. Therefore, the typical work pattern was 30 min of continuous cycling, before 
15 
a further 5 min of exercise every 25 min. The initial prescription of exercise based on power output, 
16 
relative to body mass, as opposed to %V�O2max 14,26, removes the necessity for an initial cycling V�O2max 
17 
test and maintains the relative exercise intensity across training days, independent of adaptation. 
18 
Furthermore, cycling training controlled for performance that could arise from increased training 
19 
volume were participants to acclimate through running. Training occurred at the same time of day, 
20 
predominantly in the morning (07:00-10:00 h) and one participant in the evening (18:00-20:00 h). No 
21 
fluid intake was permitted during training 27.

Exercise trials 
1 
During all trials, participants initially rested in the hot environment (32°C, 60% RH) for 10 mins, 
2 
before a 20 min period for cooling, or additional rest, as appropriate. Therefore, the entire protocol 
3 
occurred within a thermostatically controlled environmental chamber (WatFlow control system TISS, 
4 
UK) within which conditions were continuously monitored throughout the trial using a heat stress 
5 
meter (HT30, Extech Instruments, USA), which provided indoor wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT). 
6 
A GXT in the heat, split into two parts; GXT 1 and GXT 2, was adopted similar to that described 
7 
by Jones 28 and as previously implemented 8,29. The test comprised two parts; GXT 1, a submaximal 
8 
incremental speed protocol, followed by GXT 2; an incremental gradient protocol to volitional 
9 
exhaustion. During GXT 1 each participant completed a minimum of six stages, using speed increments 
10 
of 1 km.h-1. The initial treadmill speed was based on the familiarisation trial, which in turn was 
11 
determined from recent 5 km time. Following a 10 min rest, GXT 2 began at a speed 2 km.h-1 below 
12 
the previous final speed with gradient increasing by 1% each min, continuing until volitional 
13 
exhaustion 28. Participants were not permitted to drink and were blinded to all forms of feedback 
14 
throughout the duration of the trial. 
15 
Prior to completing any experimental TT, participants underwent a familiarisation trial under the 
16 
same circumstances. During the familiarisation, starting speed was determined based upon recent 5 
17 
km performance. For each experimental TT, following cooling and/or rest phases, participants 
18 
completed a self-selected 5 min warm-up, replicated across all trials, on a motorised treadmill 
19 
(Woodway ELG2, Germany). Standardised instructions were given at the start and nothing thereafter; 
20 
’give your all’, ‘pace yourself throughout the trial’ and ‘adjust speed as you see fit’ as per similar studies 
21 
30. Participants straddled the treadmill belt, increased to the individual’s average pace from the 
22 
familiarisation, to maintain a consistent blinded starting speed. Treadmill speed adjustment was 
23 
permitted ad libitum (increment 0.2 km.h-1), with the distance completed continuously displayed. 
24 
Participants were blinded to all other feedback. Elapsed time was recorded every km.

Physiological measures 
1 
During all trials, hydration was assessed upon arrival, whereby euhydration represented urine 
2 
osmolality and specific gravity below 700 mOsmol.kg-1 H2O and 1.020, respectively 31. Pre and post 
3 
nude body mass were recorded to estimate sweat loss (GFK150 scales, AE Adam, UK). A single-use 
4 
rectal probe (Henleys Medical, UK) connected to a meter logger (Model 401, Yellow Springs 
5 
Instruments, USA), was inserted 10 cm beyond the anal sphincter for TCORE measurement. Telemetry 
6 
thermistors (U-Type connected to Gen II GD38 transmitter, Eltek, UK) were attached to the mid-belly 
7 
of the pectoralis major, biceps brachii, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. Local skin temperatures 
8 
were derived through a datalogger (RX250AL 1000 series Wireless Squirrel Logger, Eltek) as per James 
9 
et al. 32 in order to determine mean TSKIN 33. Heart rate was monitored continuously using a Polar 810i 
10 
heart rate monitor (Kempele, Finland). 
11 
During the GXTs, HR, TCORE, TSKIN, rating of perceived exertion (RPE 34) and thermal sensation (TS, 
12 
0=unbearably cold to 8=unbearably hot) 35 were noted at the end of each stage. The following 
13 
physiological responses were calculated; running speeds at blood lactate concentrations of 2 and 4 
14 
mmol.l-1, running economy (RE), V�O2max and velocity at V�O2max (vV�O2max) as per James et al. 29. 
15 
Derivative calculations included mean TSKIN 33, Physiological Strain Index (PSI) 36 and change in plasma 
16 
volume 37. During the 5 km time trial, HR, TCORE, TSKIN, RPE and TS were recorded every km. 
17 
Statistical analyses 
18 
All outcome variables were assessed for normality and sphericity prior to further analysis. Where 
19 
assumptions of ANOVA were not met, non-parametric statistics were adopted. Exercise data from 
20 
both the GXTs and TTs were analysed using two-way, repeated measures ANOVA (Trial*Time) where 
21 
data comprised repeated time points, with post hoc Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons used 
22 
where significant main or interaction effects occurred. During the time trials, all average, finishing and 
23 
delta change data from physiological and performance variables were analysed with One-way 
24 
repeated measures ANOVA. Where the use of repeated measures ANOVA was precluded through the 
25

violation of parametric assumptions, such as TT performance, Friedman’s ANOVA, with Wilcoxon 
1 
follow up tests, were used to analyse these data. Singular data, that did not have repeated measures 
2 
within the GXT, were analysed using Paired samples t-tests. Effect sizes for main effects and 
3 
interaction effects are presented as partial eta squared (partial η2), differences between related 
4 
samples were evaluated through Cohen’s dav (dav) 38. Data were analysed using SPSS (Version 21, SPSS 
5 
Inc., USA) with statistical significance set at p<0.05 and data presented as means and standard 
6 
deviation (±SD).

RESULTS 
8 
Heat acclimation training 
9 
Mean exercising time during STHA training was 39 (6) min, completed at a relative exercise 
10 
intensity of 2.7 (0.3) W.kg-1 (201 [33] W). The training environmental conditions (36.6 [0.8]°C, 59 [9]% 
11 
RH) elicited a mean peak session HR of 176 (9) b.min-1 and average session TCORE of 38.5 (0.2)°C. The 
12 
mean time TCORE exceeded 38.5°C during each session was 63 (5) min, with an average peak session 
13 
TCORE of 39.1 (0.2)°C. Mean sweat rate was 1.5 (0.5) L.hr-1, equating to 3.2 (1.1)% of body mass. 
14 
Graded exercise tests 
15 
Statistically significant reductions in resting (-0.15°C, p=0.01, dav=0.45) and exercising TCORE (-
16 
0.21°C, p=0.04, dav=0.54) were observed, alongside a reduced exercising (-3 b.min-1, p=0.02, dav=0.26), 
17 
but not resting HR (-2 b.min-1, p=0.115, dav=0.36). Total sweat loss did not change following STHA (Pre 
18 
1.35 [0.3] L, Post 1.39 [0.39] L, p= 0.503, dav=0.13), but occurred alongside a smaller change in TCORE (∆ 
19 
Pre 1.26 [0.27] °C, ∆ Post 1.00 [0.28] °C, p=0.006, dav=0.91) indicating increased sudomotor sensitivity. 
20 
A 5.7% increase (p=0.03, dav=1.06) in blood plasma volume was also observed. No changes were 
21 
observed in mean RPE (p=0.342) or TS (p=0.262), although there was a reduced change in thermal 
22 
sensation (p=0.04, dav=0.86). For complete STHA results please see James et al. 22.

Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
The GXT also revealed an enhanced V�O2max following STHA (+4.0 [2.2] mL.kg-1.min-1, +7.3 [4.0]%, 
1 
p=0.003, dav=0.47). A reduced respiratory exchange ratio (-0.08, p=0.03, dav=0.59) during exercise is 
2 
commensurate with improvements observed in both the LT (+0.4 [0.6] k.hr-1, +4.0 [6.0]%, p=0.073, 
3 
dav=0.24) and LTP (+0.3 [0.4] k.hr-1, +2.5 [2.9]%, p=0.022, dav=0.20). No statistical difference was 
4 
observed in vV�O2max (p=0.144, dav=0.24), although the mean difference of 0.5 (0.8) k.hr-1 (3.5 [5.3]%) 
5 
is potentially meaningful given our laboratory typical error of 2.9% for this measure in a similarly 
6 
trained cohort. Finally, RE worsened, with a greater amount of oxygen consumed per kilometre 
7 
following heat acclimation (+7.3 [7.3] mL.kg-1.km-1, 3.5 [3.5]%, p=0.017, dav=0.59). 
8 
Time trial performances 
9 
Environmental conditions (WBGT) did not differ between trials; CON=27.4 (0.7)°C, PC=26.9 (0.5)°C, 
10 
HA=27.5 (0.9)°C, HA+PC=27.0 (0.8)°C (p=0.246, partial η2=0.156). Self-reported motivation, muscle 
11 
soreness and stress responses did not differ between trials for the female participant or for the group 
12 
as a whole (p>0.05). Friedman’s ANOVA revealed a difference in TT performance between trials 
13 
(p=0.001). However, Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction (whereby significance = p<0.008), only 
14 
indicated a significant difference between the control trial and HA+PC. Group mean (±SD) 
15 
performance times were; CON 1476 (173)s, PC 1421 (146)s, HA 1378 (116)s and HA+PC 1373 (121)s. 
16 
Relative to control, a large mean improvement was observed in HA and HA+PC, with a modest 
17 
improvement following PC (Table 1), although neither reached statistical significance. Compared with 
18 
CON, nine participants ran faster in HA, whilst eight ran faster in HA+PC and PC trials. There was no 
19 
observable difference in running performance between HA and HA+PC trial, whilst the observed effect 
20 
sizes and mean difference indicate modest improvements in HA and HA+PC compared with PC (Table 
21 
1). In HA+PC, eight participants ran faster than in PC, with six participants performing better in HA 
22 
than PC. Figure 2 displays the kilometre splits for each trial.

Following 20 min cooling there was no change in TCORE (p=0.219, partial η2=0.165). Therefore, 
5 
starting TCORE was not different between trials (p=0.697, partial η2=0.075); CON 37.12 (0.22)°C, PC 
6 
37.07 (0.30)°C, HA 37.07 (0.23)°C and 37.2 (0.22)°C during HA+PC. Large reductions in TSKIN (p<0.001, 
7 
partial η2=0.906) were observed across the cooling period in the trials containing precooling (-6.9 
8 
[2.7]°C PC; -6.8 [1.5]°C HA+PC), whilst TSKIN was unchanged in non-precooling trials (CON +0.87 
9 
[0.50]°C; HA +0.58 [0.58]°C). Therefore, starting TSKIN in PC (26.9 [2.8]°C) and HA+PC (26.4 [1.9]°C) were 
10 
lower (p<0.001, partial η2=0.900) than in non-precooled trials (34.3 [0.7]°C CON, 34.0 [0.4]°C HA). This 
11 
coincided with a reduced starting thermal sensation (p=0.002, partial η2=0.907) in PC (2.2 [0.8]) and 
12 
HA+PC (2.4 [0.8]), compared with CON (4.4 [0.6] and HA (3.7 [1.5]). Finally, a greater core:skin gradient 
13 
(p<0.001, partial η2=0.896) was observed in PC (9.6 [2.6]°C) and HA+PC (10.5 [1.7]°C), compared with 
14 
CON (2.7 [0.6]°C) and HA (3.2 [0.5]°C). Plots of thermoregulatory variables during all trials are shown

Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
During the TTs, there was no difference in mean TCORE between conditions (p=0.117, partial 
1 
η2=0.273), however the change (∆) in TCORE was different (p=0.044, partial η2=0.776) as shown in Figure 
2 
3. Finishing TCORE differed between conditions (p=0.025, partial η2=0.396), with CON the warmest 
3 
(39.34 [0.30]°C), followed by PC (39.24 [0.51]°C), HA (39.16 [0.44]°C) and the lowest finishing TCORE in 
4 
HA+PC (38.96 [0.43]°C). 
5 
The differences observed in starting TSKIN continued during the respective TTs (p=0.010, partial 
6 
η2=0.369). Mean TSKIN was highest during CON (35.3 [1.2]°C), followed by HA (34.6 [0.7]°C), PC (34.6 
7 
[1.2]°C) and the lowest was in HA+PC (34.1 [0.9]°C) as shown in Figure 3. However, a statistical 
8 
difference was only observed between CON and PC (p=0.029, d=0.58). A difference in finishing TSKIN 
9 
was also apparent (p=0.037, partial η2=0.293), although only between CON and HA (p=0.026, d=0.48). 
10 
Finishing TSKIN for each trial was; CON 35.1 (1.2)°C, PC 35.7 (1.2)°C, HA 34.6 (1.0)°C and HA+PC 34.9 
11 
(1.0)°C. 
12 
The mean core:skin gradient was also different between conditions (p=0.005, partial η2=0.504), as 
13 
shown in Figure 3. The largest gradient was observed in HA+PC (4.2 [1.2]°C), followed by HA (3.7 
14 
[0.8]°C), PC (3.6 [1.0]°C) and CON (2.9 [0.9]°C, with statistical differences between CON and HA+PC 
15 
(p=0.034, d=1.24). There were different finishing core:skin gradients (p=0.028, partial η2=0.388), with 
16 
the largest observed in HA (4.3 [1.1]°C) and HA+PC (4.2 [1.2]°C), followed by PC (3.7 [1.0]°C) and CON 
17 
(3.4 [1.0]°C).

 No differences were observed in the mean TS (p=0.066, partial η2=0.255) or RPE (p=0.213, partial

partial η2=0.051), differed between conditions. Similarly, mean HR as a percentage of maximum HR 
3 
(%HRmax) was not different between conditions (p=0.089, partial η2=0.234), as shown in Figure 4. The 
4 
mean %HRmax for each trial was; CON 93.4 (3.8)%, PC 94.6 (4.9)%, HA 93.3 (3.8)% and HA+PC 91.6

in HA (2.5 [0.5] l.hr-1), compared with CON (2.2 [0.8] l.hr-1), PC (1.7 [0.5] l.hr-1) and HA+PC (2.3 [0.6]

Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
DISCUSSION 
1 
Our primary aim was to assess the efficacy of combining precooling and heat acclimation for 
2 
improving endurance running performance in the heat. Our data reaffirm previous observations, with 
3 
precooling offering no further benefit to performance in the acclimated individual, but demonstrate 
4 
modest alleviation of physiological strain. The second aim was to directly compare the ergogenic 
5 
potential of precooling and heat acclimation. Despite the lack of a statistical difference, these data 
6 
indicate heat acclimation improves endurance running performance further than precooling. 
7 
Combined heat acclimation and precooling 
8 
In spite of the theoretical potential to improve running performance further by adding precooling, 
9 
we did not observe a performance improvement in HA+PC above that of HA. The only prior study 
10 
investigating HA+PC on endurance exercise, highlighted a potentially meaningful greater self-selected 
11 
exercise intensity during the first half of the cycling time trial, alongside reduced thermal sensation 17. 
12 
However, the faster pace was not sustained, reducing alongside the dissipation of PC effects, with a 
13 
comparable trend in the precooled trials completed prior to the heat acclimatisation camp. Our data, 
14 
implementing a more potent cooling strategy in HA+PC, afforded greater differences in TCORE, TSKIN, 
15 
core:skin gradient and thermal sensation during the first half of the trial (Figure 3), but did not alter 
16 
the initial pace. The reasons for this are unclear, but speculatively, may represent a different, and 
17 
ultimately sub-optimal, pacing strategy being adopted in HA+PC. 
18 
Recent evidence indicates athletes target a more even pacing profile with familiarisation in the 
19 
heat 39 and as shown in Figure 2, HA+PC displays the most even profile. It appears this was sub-optimal 
20 
following HA+PC, given the transient benefit that precooling affords, an interpretation supported by 
21 
a slightly lower %HRmax during HA+PC until 4 km into the trial (Figure 4). This indicates participants 
22 
exercised at a lower relative intensity in HA+PC, despite relative intensity normally being maintained 
23 
across individuals for a given event 
40. Therefore, both the mediated physiological and 
24 
thermoregulatory strain afforded by HA+PC during the first half of the trial may not have been 
25 
 17 
Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
exploited, as individuals targeted an even pace. These observations are supported by participant 
1 
feedback, indicating pacing may have been incorrect, either under/overestimating the effect of 
2 
HA+PC, resulting in them beginning at too high or too low a pace. We therefore recommend further 
3 
familiarisation is necessary when combining interventions. Future research should consider whether 
4 
familiarisation to exercise in the heat is influenced by racing experience or performance standard and 
5 
thus specific to the population used in a study. 
6 
Previous studies have suggested cardiovascular and thermoregulatory adaptations from HA may 
7 
reduce the ergogenic effects of PC by influencing the same mechanisms, such as the enlarged core:skin 
8 
gradient and reduced cardiovascular strain, creating an insensitivity or ‘ceiling effect’ 14,17. However, 
9 
when an aggressive precooling technique is adopted and heat strain remains severe, these data would 
10 
contend otherwise, evidencing small beneficial changes, notably in %HRmax and TSKIN. Therefore, 
11 
further familiarisation with HA+PC appears necessary to ensure pacing is optimised and future 
12 
research should investigate this across a range of standards of athletes, including 5 km distance 
13 
specialists. 
14 
 
15 
Comparison of heat acclimation and precooling 
16 
A secondary aim was to directly compare the effect of acute and chronic interventions on 
17 
endurance running performance. Participants ran 43 s (3%) faster following HA than PC, which exceeds 
18 
our typical error, established during pilot testing, of 16 s (1.2%). In-turn, PC afforded a 55 s (3.7%) 
19 
improvement over CON, with eight participants improving more than our typical error. In HA, 
20 
compared with CON, six participants improved more than the typical error, with a mean improvement 
21 
of 98 s (6.6%), which was the only statistically significant difference. That no other comparisons were 
22 
statistically different likely reflects a disparity in running performance within this cohort, as well as the 
23 
adoption of a more conservative non-parametric statistical test, with both the mean differences and 
24 
effect sizes (Table 1) indicative of meaningful changes between conditions. Indeed, six participants 
25 
 18 
Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
ran faster in HA than PC, with five improving more than the typical error. Elapsed time was similar 
1 
between HA and PC at 2 km (PC; 547 [46] s, HA; 538 [45] s), before PC demonstrated a greater 
2 
reduction in running speed between 2-4 km (elapsed time at 4 km PC; 1135 [111] s, HA; 1108 [106] s). 
3 
As shown in Figure 3, this reduction in running speed during PC coincides with the dissipation of a 
4 
lower TSKIN and core:skin gradient, relative to HA. It is possible the trial order may have contributed to 
5 
the flatter pacing profile in HA, as PC was not randomised with HA, and both repeated trials 41 and 
6 
familiarisation to the heat 39 may result in a flatter pacing profile. Therefore, it is more likely that the 
7 
greater reduction in running speed in PC reflects greater heat strain, given the aforementioned 
8 
dissipation of both a reduced TSKIN and core:skin ratio. Concomitantly, this may result in a greater 
9 
progressive reduction in V�O2max, necessitating a reduced running speed to maintain relative intensity 
10 
during PC. 
11 
The reduction in maximum aerobic capacity has been suggested to be the most plausible 
12 
explanation for the decline in endurance performance under heat stress 42, whilst the relative intensity 
13 
that an event is completed at has been shown to be maintained across both hot, cold and hypoxic 
14 
conditions 41,43. Given the transient nature of the intervention, precooling does not provide prolonged, 
15 
uniform alleviation of cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain, as shown by the ineffectiveness of 
16 
precooling on V�O2max after approximately 30 min of exercise 8. Conversely, meaningful improvements 
17 
in V�O2max in the heat were observed following HA, which may present for 5-14 days, depending on the 
18 
HA protocol adopted, in accordance with HA decay 44,45 and would facilitate a greater maintained 
19 
running speed, despite the inevitable progressive decline in V�O2max. Enhanced V�O2max (~7%) following 
20 
HA is thought to arise primarily through an expanded plasma volume 6, whilst endurance performance 
21 
may also benefit from a slowed progressive decline in V�O2max during exercise, due to increased heat 
22 
dissipation. A lower TSKIN better maintains the core:skin gradient, thereby mediating cutaneous blood 
23 
flow demands and preserving stroke volume and V�O2max 46, as well as delaying exercise termination 
24 
under heat stress 47. 
25 
 19 
Combining heat acclimation and precooling for running in the heat. 
Alongside improved maintenance of a runner’s aerobic capacity in the heat, HA reduced the 
1 
change in perceived thermal strain during the GXT and afforded reduced TSKIN relative to PC during the 
2 
second half of the TT (Figure 3), which is pertinent given elevated TSKIN and thermal discomfort are 
3 
associated with the voluntary reduction of exercise intensity in the heat 13,48. Although, Ely et al. 42 
4 
suggest these effects may be subsidiary to the decrement in V�O2max and subsequent increase in relative 
5 
intensity at a fixed running speed, given the magnitude of V�O2max impairment. 
6 
Relative intensity and perceived thermal strain alone cannot fully explain the differences between 
7 
HA and PC, given the different pace after one kilometre. Speculatively, this could reflect a lower 
8 
training status of the current cohort of runners, who began trials with a predetermined even-paced 
9 
strategy, in comparison to the highly experienced cyclists in the study of Racinais et al. 41 who 
10 
maintained a fixed relative intensity (%V�O2max) from the start of the trial. Alternatively, naivety of the 
11 
optimal pacing following precooling would also seem plausible. In HA+PC, the marked reduction in 
12 
TSKIN that persists through the first half of the trial, differs from the afferent feedback participants are 
13 
accustomed to, that determines self-selected running speed in the heat 13. Indeed, anecdotally, 
14 
participants highlighted ambiguity about how to maximise performance in PC, reinforcing the notion 
15 
that pacing must be practiced, through repeated familiarisation, in advance of adopting PC in 
16 
competition. Therefore, these data would appear to be the first to demonstrate a marked advantage 
17 
from STHA over acute precooling in club runners, running in the heat. 
18 
Despite the sub-elite training status of this cohort, our design controls for an order effect because 
19 
the number and scheduling of experimental trials was in keeping with their weekly training load, 
20 
meaning familiarisations and pre/post trials are unlikely to have elicited changes in training status. 
21 
Furthermore, participants also completed cycling training, rather than running, which helps to control 
22 
for any mode-specific adaptations biasing our conclusions. Finally, whilst daily HA provides an 
23 
increased training volume, this is an inherent part of this intervention. Passive heat acclimation 
24 
protocols were not selected because we wanted to compare what we feel to be an optimal approach

23,24,27,49,50. 
2 
Despite the reduced performance compared with HA, these data reaffirm the potential for mixed 
3 
methods, precooling to benefit endurance performance in the heat when HA is not possible. Whilst 
4 
the use of external precooling for endurance performance is well supported 10,11, this has not 
5 
previously been assessed during free-paced endurance exercise. As per previous research that have 
6 
used this technique 8,9,12, PC did not elicit a reduction in TCORE during the cooling phase. Similarly, an 
7 
‘after-drop’ was not observed, whereby vasoconstriction dissipates and warm blood is subsequently 
8 
cooled in the periphery 51, which is likely a result of the significant and immediate metabolic heat 
9 
production during treadmill running. A reduced rate of TCORE increase may be inferred, given similar 
10 
response to CON, but at higher running speeds. 
11 
It should be acknowledged that the lack of air-flow, as might be experienced outdoors, may over-
12 
estimate the magnitude of the reported PC effect 52, although the influence will be less severe than in 
13 
cycling due to the reduced air velocity during running. Another potential limitation is the failure to 
14 
counterbalance the order of the pre and post training time trials, therefore the magnitude of 
15 
improvement may be exaggerated. However, when compared against the typical error of 16 s (1.2%), 
16 
the reported improvements all appear to represent true differences. 
17 
Practical applications 
18 
These results suggest athletes and coaches should prioritise a HA strategy where possible prior to 
19 
endurance exercise in the heat. When this is not possible, a mixed methods precooling strategy, that 
20 
cools a large surface area of skin, would appear to remain beneficial, although time should be taken 
21 
to familiarise with pacing strategies. Combining HA and PC appears to elicit a better maintenance of 
22 
the core:skin gradient, but this did not transfer into improved 5km time trial performance. Therefore,

researchers, practitioners and coaches should consider familiarising individuals with HA+PC to ensure 
1 
pacing strategies maximise the alleviation of physiological strain.
