Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We aimed to examine time trends in national perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by pre-existing
type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
Methods We analysed episode-level data on all obstetric inpatient delivery events (live or stillbirth) between 1 April 1998 and 31
March 2013 (n = 813,921) using the Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR02). Pregnancies to mothers with type 1 (n = 3229) and
type 2 (n = 1452) diabetes were identified from the national diabetes database (Scottish Care Information-Diabetes), and perinatal
outcomes were compared among women with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes.
Results The number of pregnancies complicated by diabetes increased significantly, by 44% in type 1 diabetes and 90% in type 2
diabetes, across the 15 years examined, to rates of 1 in 210 and 1 in 504 deliveries, respectively. Compared with women without
diabetes, delivery occurred 2.6 weeks earlier (type 1 diabetes 36.7 ± 2.3 weeks) and 2 weeks earlier (type 2 diabetes 37.3 ±
2.4 weeks), respectively, showing significant reductions for both type 1 (from 36.7 weeks to 36.4 weeks, p = 0.03) and type 2
(from 38.0 weeks to 37.2 weeks, p < 0.001) diabetes across the time period. The proportions of preterm delivery were markedly
increased in women with diabetes (35.3% type 1 diabetes, 21.8% type 2 diabetes, 6.1% without diabetes; p < 0.0001), and these
proportions increased with time for both groups (p < 0.005). Proportions of elective Caesarean sections (29.4% type 1 diabetes,
30.5% type 2 diabetes, 9.6% without diabetes) and emergency Caesarean sections (38.3% type 1 diabetes, 29.1% type 2 diabetes,
14.6% without diabetes) were greatly increased in women with diabetes and increased over time except for stable rates of emergency
Caesarean section in type 1 diabetes. Gestational age-, sex- and parity-adjusted z score for birthweight (1.33 ± 1.34; p < 0.001) were
higher in type 1 diabetes and increased over time from 1.22 to 1.47 (p < 0.001). Birthweight was also increased in type 2 diabetes
(0.94 ± 1.34; p < 0.001) but did not alter with time. There were 65 perinatal deaths in offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes and
39 to mothers with type 2 diabetes, representing perinatal mortality rates of 20.1 (95% CI 14.7, 24.3) and 26.9 (16.7, 32.9) per 1000
births, respectively, and rates 3.1 and 4.2 times, respectively, those observed in the non-diabetic population (p < 0.001). Stillbirth
rates in type 1 and type 2 diabetes were 4.0-fold and 5.1-fold that in the non-diabetic population (p < 0.001). Perinatal mortality and
stillbirth rates showed no significant fall over time despite small falls in the rates for the non-diabetic population.
Conclusions/interpretation Women with diabetes are receiving increased intervention in pregnancy (earlier delivery, increased
Caesarean section rates), but despite this, higher birthweights are being recorded. Improvements in rates of stillbirth seen in the
general population are not being reflected in changes in stillbirth or perinatal mortality in our population with diabetes.

Introduction
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes confer significant additional risks in
pregnancy, with increased rates of stillbirth, perinatal mortality,
macrosomia, prematurity and operative delivery [1–6]. Results
of several national surveys between 1990 and 2008, including
previous paper-based national surveys in Scotland in
1998/1999 and 2003/2004 [7, 8] showed that, despite marked
improvement before these years [9], rates of stillbirth and peri-
natal mortality among women with diabetes prior to pregnancy
continued to be broadly 3–5 times those of the non-diabetic
population [1, 10–13]. Whether rates of stillbirth and perinatal
mortality have changed thereafter has been less clear—
although, importantly, the most recent data for England and
Wales suggest a marked reduction in stillbirth rates for women
with type 1 diabetes from 25.8 (18.3 to 33.3) per 1000 live
births in 2002/2003 [2] to 10.7 in 2015 [14], and from 29.2
(16.3 to 42.2) to 10.7 for women with type 2 diabetes. Data for
birthweight have shown less dramatic historical trends, with
relatively stable birthweight up to 1990 for type 1 diabetes [9].
In this study, we analysed nationally collected data from
Scotland to examine whether perinatal outcomes for mothers
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were changing.
Methods
Study population We linked the Scottish Morbidity Record 02
(SMR02) to the Scottish Care Information-Diabetes (SCI-
Diabetes) database. SMR02 includes information on all wom-
en discharged from Scottish maternity hospitals, including ma-
ternal and infant demographics, clinical management and ob-
stetric complications. It includes a standard measure of social
deprivation (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation [SIMD])
[15]. It is subject to regular quality assurance, and the most
recent validation of a 4.4% sample (n = 2531) with case re-
cords showed that all the data items used in our study were
more than 90% complete and accurate [16]. Gestational age
has been confirmed by ultrasound in early pregnancy in more
than 95% of women in the UK since the early 1990s [17]. SCI-
Diabetes collates demographic and clinical data for people
with a diagnosis of diabetes in Scotland. From 2004 onwards,
population coverage of the register has been 99.5% [18].
Research in context
What is already known about this subject?
What is the key question?
What are the new findings?
How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes
•
Several national surveys, including previous Scottish surveys from 1998/99 and 2002/03, have shown stillbirth
and perinatal mortality rates in diabetes three- to fivefold that in the background population
•
Improving rates of macrosomia and infants large for gestational age has also proved challenging for clinicians
in previous years
•
Have perinatal outcomes in pregnancy complicated by type 1 or type 2 diabetes improved in Scotland
between 1998/99 and 2012/13?
•
Numbers of women entering pregnancy with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have increased significantly over time
•
Mothers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are being delivered earlier and many preterm. Despite this, babies are
born heavier than babies of mothers without diabetes, particularly in type 1 diabetes
•
Stillbirth and perinatal mortality rates remain unchanged over the 15 year period at rates three- to fivefold
those in the population without diabetes
•
There is a major unmet need to improve perinatal outcomes for women with diabetes treated during
pregnancy. Novel approaches and technologies will be needed to address this

 Diabetes type was defined in the clinical record of SCI-
Diabetes. This was further refined by algorithm if contradicted
by available information on age at diagnosis and prescription
history, reassigning as type 2 diabetes if there had been more
than 1 year of receiving no diabetes medication or solely non-
metformin oral glucose-lowering agents, and reassigning as
type 2 diabetes if no contradictory prescription history was
present and the individual had been diagnosed at less than
30 years of age [19, 20]. Diagnosis of diabetes has previously
been validated in SCI-Diabetes against inpatient records, with
greater than 99% accuracy [18]. Gestational diabetes was not
always recorded and is not considered here.
Approval for records access and linkage was obtained from
the Caldicott guardians of all Health Boards in Scotland, the
Privacy Advisory Committee of the Information Services
Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland and the
national multicentre research ethics committee. In keeping
with the ethics application, no individual consent was taken
but identifiable information was not supplied to researchers.
Information was stored and analysed in a pseudonymised
format.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria We obtained SMR02 data for
all infants delivered between 1 April 1998 and 31
March 2013. Analyses were restricted to births in girls or
women older than 10 years who delivered between 24 and
44 weeks of gestation inclusive.
Definitions The z score for birthweight was calculated in cells
based on gestational age, sex and parity using a set of standard
LMS-tables derived from all Scottish births from 1998 to
2003 [21].
Stillbirth was defined as a child born after 24 weeks’ ges-
tation who did not breathe or show signs of life, while perina-
tal mortality was defined as the combination of this and death
in the first week of life.
Infants were defined as ‘large for gestational age’ (LGA) if
they were born weighing above the 90th centile corrected for
gestational age, sex and parity.
Statistical analyses Pregnancy outcomes in women by diabe-
tes status were compared using ANOVA or logistic regression
with post hoc testing between groups (ANOVA), or by χ2 test
as appropriate. Data are expressed as means ± SD unless stat-
ed otherwise. Trends for changes in outcome over time were
assessed by ANOVAwith terms for type of diabetes, time and
interaction between these tested. Binomial distribution was
used to obtain 95% CI for ORs in trend analysis. All analyses
were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA).
Data are presented for all deliveries for maternal variables,
stillbirth and perinatal mortality (n = 813,634), but confined to
singletons for mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery
including preterm birth and birthweight variables (n =
801,271).
Results
A total of 813,921 deliveries were recorded in Scotland across
the audit period, of which 38 were excluded from the study
owing to the unknown vital status of the infant. Among these,
4681 (0.6%) were to mothers with pregestational diabetes,
3229 (69%) of whom had had type 1 diabetes for an average
13.2 years and 1452 (31%) type 2 diabetes for an average of
3.3 years (Table 1). A further 249 mothers were linked to SCI-
Diabetes with another diagnosis (including gestational diabe-
tes, impaired glucose tolerance or maturity-onset diabetes of
the young) and were not considered further.
There were 104 perinatal deaths in the offspring of mothers
with diabetes across the 15 years (65 for type 1 diabetes, 39 for
type 2 diabetes), representing rates rates 3.1 and 4.2 times
those observed in the non-diabetic population (p < 0.001;
Table 1). Stillbirth rates in type 1 and type 2 diabetes were
4.0-fold and 5.1-fold that in the non-diabetic population
(p < 0.001), and occurred at a mean gestational age of 33.6
and 34.1 weeks, respectively. Perinatal mortality rates were
unchanged over time (see electronic supplementary material
[ESM] Fig. 1).
The number of births to mothers with type 1 diabetes in-
creased significantly from 1998/1999 to 2012/2013 (from 205
to 264 deliveries), with a larger increase in type 2 diabetes
(from 59 to 110) (Fig. 1). Both increases were significant
(p < 0.001) and suggested a 44% increase in deliveries to
mothers with type 1 diabetes and a 90% increase in type 2
diabetes in fitted models.
Mothers with type 1 diabetes were on average 0.4 years
older (29.2 ± 5.7 years) and more likely to be nulliparous than
the general population (Table 1). By contrast, mothers with
type 2 diabetes were 4 years older than mothers without dia-
betes, had higher rates of deprivation and were more likely to
have had a previous pregnancy (Table 1).
There were marked differences in pregnancy outcomes in
women with diabetes compared with non-diabetic women. On
average, women with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were
delivered 2.6 weeks and 2 weeks earlier than women without
diabetes (Table 1). The proportions of preterm (less than
37 weeks’ gestation) and very preterm (less than 32 weeks’
gestation) delivery were increased in women with diabetes,
with a fivefold increase in preterm delivery in type 1 diabetes
(Table 1). The proportions of elective Caesarean section
(ELCS) and emergency Caesarean section (EMCS) were
greatly increased, with 67.7% of women with type 1 diabetes
and 59.6% of women with type 2 diabetes undergoing opera-
tive delivery (Table 1). Despite significantly earlier delivery,
mean absolute birthweights in type 1 and type 2 diabetes were
Diabetologia (2018) 61:1081–1088
1083
 higher than in those without diabetes (68.7 g heavier in type 1
diabetes, 76 g heavier in type 2 diabetes) but only formally
statistically significant in type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001)
(Table 1). When adjusted for gestational age, parity and sex,
these differences were dramatic, with the offspring of mothers
with type 1 diabetes born at average weights 1.33 SD above
those of the non-diabetic population, and offspring of mothers
with type 2 diabetes averaging 0.94 SD above the non-
diabetic population (Table 1). Around 51% of babies born to
mothers with type 1 diabetes and 38% born to mothers with
type 2 diabetes were defined as LGA (Table 1).
One of the strengths of our data is the ability to look at
trends over time. Across the 15 years, mean maternal age at
delivery increased by 0.6 years in mothers with type 1 diabetes
and 1.6 years in mothers with type 2 diabetes (from 32.4 to
34 years on average) (ESM Fig. 2). Maternal age increased by
0.9 years in mothers without diabetes, and while the trend to
increasing age was highly significant (p < 0.001), it was no
different in mothers with diabetes (p = 0.56). Mean duration
of diabetes also increased, from 12.4 to 14.6 years in type 1
diabetes and from 2.6 to 3.8 years in type 2 diabetes
(p < 0.001).

 Delivery occurred at an earlier mean gestation in type 1
and type 2 diabetes, falling slightly from 36.7 weeks in
1998/1999 to 36.4 weeks in 2012/2013 for type 1 diabetes
(p = 0.03), and from 38.0 to 37.2 weeks in type 2 diabetes
(p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). The proportion of women delivering
preterm increased for both groups, from 34.1% to 42.4%
for type 1 diabetes, with a dramatic increase in type 2
diabetes from 11.9% to 25.5% (p < 0.005). Very preterm
deliveries (under 32 weeks) were uncommon (Table 1)
and showed no significant trend. The proportion of
singleton deliveries involving Caesarean section increased
significantly (p < 0.001) for the non-diabetic population
from 6.8% to 11.8% for ELCS and from 11.8% to
15.1% for EMCS (ESM Figs 3 and 4). ELCS and
EMCS rates were far higher in mothers with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001), with the same upward trajec-
tory, despite higher initial rates in women with type 2
diabetes, and for ELCS in women with type 1 diabetes.
The only exception was EMCS in women with type 1
diabetes, for which the already very high rates (40%)
remained stable (p = 0.042).
Adjusted birthweight appeared stable in women with type
2 diabetes, but the z score for mean birthweight increased in
type 1 diabetes from 1.22 to 1.47 (p < 0.001; Fig. 3). This was
reflected in the proportion of LGA infants increasing from
47.1% to 56.2% (ESM Fig. 5). LGA rates in type 2 diabetes
were stable over time.
Smoking reduced significantly across the time course
examined (from 24.1% to 18% in type 1 diabetes, from
22% to 14% in type 2 diabetes, and from 27.9% to 19.3%
in the non-diabetic population; p < 0.0001). Smoking
predicted lower birthweight in type 1 (p < 0.001) and type
2 (p = 0.003) diabetes, but there was no effect of social
deprivation (as represented by the SIMD). The trend to
increased z score of birthweight in women with type 1
diabetes over time was attenuated by the addition of
smoking as an explanatory variable, but it remained
significant (p < 0.02).
Discussion
Birthweight, prematurity, operative delivery and perinatal
mortality represent key outcome measures in the management
of pregnancy complicated by diabetes. It is a concern, then,
that stillbirth and perinatal mortality rates appear to be stable
over time in our population whereas, at least for type 1 diabe-
tes, birthweight is increasing. Higher rates of operative deliv-
ery and falling gestational age at delivery suggest that this is
either reflected by, or despite, increasing obstetric
intervention.
Our stillbirth rates in type 1 diabetes are intermediate
between 2002/2003 data from England and Wales (25.8)
[2] and more recent data from 2015 (10.7, for singleton
pregnancy only) [14], but are similar to slightly older
Swedish data showing 15 stillbirths per 1000 deliveries
(1991–2003), and are lower than in other national surveys
[10, 22]. Absolute numbers are thankfully small and may
influence the ability to detect downward trends. Although
our stillbirth rates in type 1 diabetes are not formally

 significantly different from those for 2015 in England and
Wales, they raise concerns that we are not experiencing
the dramatic improvement suggested for those countries.
There may be greater concern in type 2 diabetes, where
the rate is significantly higher than that observed in the
recent England and Wales survey (10.7), albeit collected
across a much wider range of years. Notably, the differ-
ence appears to relate to stillbirth rather than neonatal
mortality, which is not changing greatly in England and
Wales (for type 1 diabetes 9.6 per 1000 in 2002/2003 and
8.1 in 2015; for type 2 diabetes 9.5 in 2002/2003 and 11.4
in 2015) [2, 14] and is highly comparable to Scottish
rates.
Our rates of obstetric intervention are high, significantly so
compared with equivalent data from France, Sweden and the
Netherlands (44.3–58.9%) [1, 10, 22]. They are also slightly
higher than figures for England and Wales, at 66% for type 1
and 56% for type 2 diabetes [14]. The rates of ELCS in type 1
and type 2 diabetes, and most strikingly EMCS in type 2
diabetes, are increasing. Although the proportions of EMCS
in type 2 diabetes (29%) we report here appear very similar to
those from England and Wales, this compares with a figure of
just 10% in the Netherlands [11].
Average birthweight is greatly increased in the off-
spring of mothers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes—de-
spite the best efforts of individuals and their clinicians.
There is an acknowledged, major unmet need to improve
glycaemia in pregnancy, particularly in women with type
1 diabetes. The ‘average’ baby born to a mother with type
1 diabetes in Scotland has a birthweight just above the
90th percentile, which is modestly increased compared
with 46.4% in England and Wales. Our rates of LGA
infants in mothers with type 2 diabetes appear higher
(38% vs 24%) [14]. We do not have complete data on
important factors such as ethnicity, which will have be-
come more diverse, particularly for type 2 diabetes.
However, census data show a greater than 96% white
population nationally, suggesting only a moderate influ-
ence, at least for type 1 diabetes [23]. Customised centiles
were used in England and Wales, which account for ma-
ternal height and weight and make direct comparisons
difficult.
A particular strength of our data is the ability to look at
temporal change. A number of observed trends might
have been expected. Although diabetes in pregnancy re-
mains relatively uncommon (1 in 178 births in our data),
the prevalence of both type 1 and particularly type 2 dia-
betes complicating pregnancy is increasing, which may
reflect a higher prevalence of obesity, advancing maternal
age and modest increases in the size of ethnic at-risk pop-
ulations [23, 24]. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes over-
all is also increasing [25]. Although still representing just
a small fraction of the overall obstetric population, these
increases have important resource implications for service
delivery in specialist clinics. The increase in duration of
both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is also of importance, as
this will probably translate into an increased prevalence of
microangiopathy, with an associated risk of placental in-
sufficiency [26].
Other trends may be less expected. Mothers with type 1
diabetes and type 2 diabetes are being delivered earlier, the
rate of operative delivery is increasing and, despite this, ad-
justed birthweight is increasing. In the non-diabetic popula-
tion, gestation at delivery appears stable, with only small in-
creases in birthweight (<0.1SD across 15 years) but rates of
ELCS and EMCS are increasing significantly. We do not have
granular data on the clinical reasons for choosing Caesarean
section, but this is worthy of further investigation. Similar
trends in ELCS rates across groups suggest that general ob-
stetric practice is changing, but this does not explain the rising
EMCS rates in type 2 diabetes. It is noticeable that, in England
and Wales, EMCS rates in women with diabetes are decreas-
ing (37.6% in 2003/2004, 30% in 2013) [6, 13].
The most recent proportions of LGA infants also appear
higher than equivalent figures for England and Wales [14],
and others have noted similar increasing trends. In Sweden,
the proportion of LGA babies was reported as 23%, 31% and
47% in successive reports of cohorts in their populations of
1982–1985, 1991–2003 and 1998–2007 [22, 27].
Interestingly, this was not attributed to deteriorating glycaemic
control, which was probably becoming tighter. We are unable
to provide standardised data on glycaemic control over the
whole time period but note that we would not expect a tem-
poral deterioration, as this was not observed in the national
surveys conducted in 1998/1999 and 2003/2004 [7]. Smoking
causes a reduction in birthweight, and happily has reduced
significantly in pregnancy in our population over the time
course of the study. Accounting for this may provide an
explanation for some of the rise in z scores in type 1 diabetes.
A standard measure of social deprivation did not influence
birthweight in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This is
of some importance as LGA carries an increased risk of com-
plications in pregnancy [28], although the relative influences
of increased absolute size, relative overgrowth and gestational
age at delivery warrant further investigation.
The main strengths of our study are its large scale and
the fact that it covered all pregnancies in Scotland, there-
by avoiding selection bias. We used routinely collected
data subject to regular quality assurance checks, and their
quality is high. Registration of individuals into SCI-
Diabetes occurred in the various Scottish health boards
between 2003 and 2006, including an upload of previous-
ly held electronic records on current patients in those
years. Women who delivered before 2003 and who left
Scotland before data entry into SCI-Diabetes may not
have been included. Our data collection appears robust,
1086
Diabetologia (2018) 61:1081–1088
 with a slightly higher number of deliveries ascertained in
2003/2004 than from the previous paper audit (172 vs
165) [7], and 96% of deliveries ascertained compared
with the 1998/1999 audit [3]. It would appear that the
population of women with diabetes is relatively stable,
and that ascertainment is successful. The development of
similar national audits, most notably in England and
Wales, which included 86% of consultant-led obstetric
units, is beginning to allow meaningful comparisons of
outcomes between countries [14].
As we used pseudonymised data, we cannot directly
compare inclusion in the previous surveys case by case.
Results from these reported a higher z score for this co-
hort (1.64 in 2003/2004 compared with 1.34 for that
year). This simply reflects the standard used: the previous
national surveys used data on births from a single centre
between 1979–1983, whereas the present study used a
contemporaneous, whole-population standard [7].
Finally, we are confined to data that have been electroni-
cally captured. This has a major strength in avoiding
under-reporting of adverse outcomes by individual units,
and the reporting of outcomes such as weight, delivery
method and gestational age is known to be robust.
We also acknowledge a weakness of this method in that
we are unable to measure some of the measures of care
assessed in the previous surveys. Specifically, factors such
as attendance at prepregnancy clinics are not recorded,
and we lack detailed information on congenital anomalies
and neonatal intensive care admissions across the study
period. Prenatal glycaemic control has previously been
shown to be unchanged between 1998/1999 and
2002/2003 but was suboptimal, with only 54% of women
having documented preconceptual HbA1c values, and with
average levels 30% above normal [7]. Inadequate prepa-
ration for pregnancy may lead to higher rates of congen-
ital malformation and pregnancy loss. It would be of in-
terest to be able to account for other maternal factors such
as BMI and gestational weight gain, which may affect
infant growth and placental function. These are unlikely
to have improved over time [25, 29]. Complications of
pregnancy, especially hypertensive disorders, may explain
our trends in timing and mode of delivery.
Pregnancy for women with diabetes remains high risk,
and much is still to be understood regarding causes and
effective interventions for adverse outcomes. As has been
shown for other aspects of diabetes care [30], a compari-
son of rates of complications across different countries
and healthcare systems offers an important opportunity
to understand the potential for improvement both in
Scotland and on a wider international level. This will in-
clude concentration on improving prepregnancy care, ef-
forts to improve glycaemic control and best obstetric prac-
tice to reduce risk.
