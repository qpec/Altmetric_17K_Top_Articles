INTRODUCTION:
 This
 case  report  is  intended
 to inform  clinicians,
 endoscopists,
 policy  makers
 and  industry
of
 our  experience
 in  the  management
 of  a rare  case  of  mobile
 phone  ingestion.
PRESENTATION
 OF  CASE:
 A  29-year-old
 prisoner
 presented
 to the  Emergency
 Department
 with
 vomiting,
ten
 hours
 after  he
 claimed  to have  swallowed
 a mobile
 phone.
 Clinical
 examination
 was  unremarkable.
Both
 initial  and repeat
 abdominal
 radiographs
 eight  hours
 later  confirmed
 that  the  foreign  body
 remained
in
 situ  in  the  stomach
 and  had  not  progressed
 along
 the  gastrointestinal
 tract.  Based  on these
 findings,
upper
 endoscopy
 was  performed
 under
 general
 anaesthesia.
 The  object  could  not
 be  aligned
 correctly
to
 accommodate
 endoscopic
 removal
 using  current  retrieval
 devices.
 Following
 unsuccessful
 endoscopy,
an
 upper
 midline
 laparotomy
 was
 performed
 and  the  phone  was  delivered
 through
 an  anterior
 gastro-
tomy,
 away  from
 the pylorus.
 The  patient
 made  an  uneventful
 recovery
 and underwent
 psychological
counselling
 prior  to  discharge.
DISCUSSION:
 In this  case  report,
 the  use  of  endoscopy
 in  the management
 when  a
 conservative
 approach
fails
 is
 questioned.
 Can  the  current  endoscopic
 retrieval
 devices
 be  improved
 to limit  the  need  for  surgical
interventions
 in future  cases?
CONCLUSION:
 An  ingested
 mobile  phone
 in  the  stomach
 may
 not  be amenable
 for  removal
 using  the
current
 endoscopic
 retrieval
 devices.
 Improvements
 in  overtubes
 or  additional
 modifications
 of  existing
retrieval
 devices
 to  ensure  adequate
 alignment
 for removal
 without
 injuring
 the  oesophagus
 are  needed.

 Introduction
Foreign
 body
 ingestion
 is
 a
 relatively
 common
 emergency
 prob-
lem.
 The
 majority
 of
 cases
 occur
 in
 the
 paediatric
 population
 [1,2].
Those
 with
 psychiatric
 disorders,
 developmental
 delay,
 alcohol
intoxication
 and
 prisoners
 are
 also
 at
 increased
 risk
 [3–6].
 Gen-
eral
 clinical
 guidelines
 on
 diagnosis
 and
 management
 of
 ingested
foreign
 bodies
 have
 been
 published
 by
 the
 American
 Society
 for
Gastrointestinal
 Endoscopy
 (ASGE)
 [6]
 and
 more
 recently,
 by
 the
European
 Society
 for
 Gastrointestinal
 Endoscopy
 (ESGE)
 [7].
 Spe-
cific
 guidelines
 for
 the
 management
 of
 gastric
 foreign
 bodies
 also
exist
 but
 are
 confined
 to
 common
 objects
 such
 as
 coins,
 magnets,
narcotic
 packets
 and
 disc
 batteries
 [6].
The
 management
 of
 a
 rare
 case
 of
 a
 patient
 who
 swallowed
 a
mobile
 phone
 with
 particular
 focus
 on
 the
 lessons
 learned
 from
 the
failed
 endoscopic
 management
 of
 the
 object
 is
 therefore
 presented
here.

 Presentation
 of
 case
A
 29-year
 old
 male
 prisoner
 was
 brought
 in
 by
 ambulance
 to
the
 Emergency
 Department
 with
 a
 four-hour
 history
 of
 vomiting,
having
 claimed
 to
 have
 swallowed
 a
 foreign
 object
 six
 hours
 earlier
that
 day.
 He
 had
 no
 other
 associated
 symptoms.
 Of
 note,
 he
 had
complex
 psycho-social
 issues.
He
 was
 haemodynamically
 stable.
 Clinical
 examination
 was
unremarkable.
 All
 laboratory
 investigations
 were
 normal.
 An
 erect
chest
 X-ray
 partially
 showed
 the
 mobile
 phone
 in
 the
 epigastrium
and
 there
 was
 no
 free
 air
 within
 the
 abdomen.
 An
 abdominal
 plain
film
 revealed
 the
 complete
 device
 in
 the
 stomach
 (Fig.
 1).
 The
patient
 was
 admitted
 and
 managed
 conservatively.
 He
 was
 kept
 nil
by
 mouth
 and
 commenced
 on
 intravenous
 fluids
 and
 proton
 pump
inhibitors.
 A
 repeat
 abdominal
 radiograph,
 approximately
 eighteen
hours
 after
 the
 reported
 time
 of
 ingestion,
 showed
 that
 the
 mobile
phone
 remained
 in
 situ
 in
 the
 stomach
 and
 had
 not
 passed
 through

the
 pylorus.
 At
 this
 time,
 the
 patient
 was
 consented
 for
 removal
under
 general
 anaesthesia
 (Fig.
 2).
The
 patient
 was
 brought
 to
 the
 operating
 theatre,
 intubated
 and
the
 initial
 intervention
 was
 an
 upper
 gastrointestinal
 endoscopy.
The
 findings
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3.
 Following
 failed
 attempts
 at
 endo-
scopic
 removal,
 using
 endoscopic
 snares,
 graspers,
 tripod
 forceps
and
 baskets,
 the
 endoscopic
 approach
 was
 abandoned.
 The
 mobile
phone
 could
 not
 be
 aligned
 correctly
 to
 allow
 for
 a
 safe
 retrieval
while
 limiting
 the
 potential
 harm
 to
 the
 oesophagus.
 The
 use
 of
overtube
 was
 not
 an
 option
 in
 this
 case
 due
 to
 the
 size
 of
 the
phone.
 An
 upper
 midline
 laparotomy
 was
 then
 performed
 and
 an
Alexis® O
 Wound
 Protector
 was
 used
 to
 protect
 the
 wound.
 A
 gas-
trotomy
 (3–4
 cm)
 was
 made
 in
 the
 anterior
 stomach
 away
 from
the
 pylorus.
 The
 phone
 was
 delivered
 through
 the
 gastrotomy
 by
manual
 manipulation
 assisted
 by
 Babcock
 forceps.
 The
 dimensions
of
 the
 foreign
 body
 were
 68
 ×
 23
 ×
 11
 mm.
 This
 was
 followed
 by
 a
two-layer
 gastrotomy
 closure,
 fascial
 and
 skin
 closure.
 A
 nasogas-
tric
 tube
 was
 placed
 during
 the
 surgery
 and
 secured
 with
 a
 bridle.
The
 mobile
 phone
 was
 sent
 as
 a
 specimen
 for
 forensic
 examination.
Postoperatively,
 the
 patient
 received
 analgesia,
 two
 further
doses
 of
 antibiotics,
 and
 was
 kept
 nil
 by
 mouth
 for
 three
 days.
 He
received
 intravenous
 fluids
 and
 proton
 pump
 inhibitors
 during
 the
period
 of
 fasting.
 The
 nasogastric
 tube
 remained
 in
 situ
 for
 a
 further
three
 days.
 He
 also
 received
 chest
 physiotherapy
 and
 was
 seen
 by
the
 psychiatrist
 before
 discharge.
 He
 passed
 a
 bowel
 motion
 on
 the
6th
 postoperative
 day
 and
 was
 discharged
 well
 on
 the
 7th
 postop-
erative
 day.
 He
 was
 reviewed
 in
 the
 out-patient
 clinic
 four
 months
later.
 He
 was
 well
 with
 no
 symptoms
 at
 this
 point.

 Discussion
Surgery
 (laparotomy
 or
 laparoscopy)
 is
 required
 in
 less
 than
1%
 of
 cases
 of
 foreign
 body
 ingestion
 as
 most
 will
 resolve
 with
conservative
 management
 or
 require
 endoscopy
 in
 approximately
10–20%
 of
 cases
 [7].
Consenting
 the
 patient
 for
 laparotomy
 before
 the
 patient
 was
anaesthetised
 was
 considered
 to
 be
 an
 important
 learning
 point,
given
 the
 limitation
 of
 endoscopy
 in
 this
 case.
 This
 approach
 helped
to
 limit
 the
 dilemma
 of
 waking
 up
 the
 patient
 again
 to
 discuss
surgery
 or
 the
 pressurized
 attempt
 at
 taking
 out
 a
 maligned
 object
endoscopically
 with
 potential
 risks
 of
 injury
 to
 the
 oesophagus.
Similarly,
 if
 the
 intervention
 were
 to
 be
 carried
 out
 by
 a
 gastroen-
terologist
 under
 anaesthesia,
 we
 would
 recommend
 that
 the
 on-call
surgeon
 should
 be
 consulted
 before
 the
 patient
 is
 anaesthetized
 and
the
 surgeon
 should
 be
 in-house
 in
 case
 a
 surgical
 intervention
 is
required.
 Further,
 the
 site
 of
 incision,
 wound
 protection
 technique,
and
 outlined
 postoperative
 care
 limited
 the
 morbidities
 in
 this
 case.
Additional
 modern
 perspectives
 in
 the
 management
 also
 include
the
 psychological
 evaluation
 before
 discharge.
 As
 the
 patient
 was
 a
prisoner,
 the
 mobile
 phone
 had
 to
 be
 sent
 as
 a
 specimen
 for
 forensic
examination.
The
 failure
 of
 endoscopy
 to
 remove
 the
 mobile
 phone,
 in
 this
case,
 highlights
 the
 limitations
 of
 this
 approach.
 The
 traditional
sequence
 of
 conservative
 approach,
 endoscopy
 and
 surgery
 when
endoscopy
 fails
 is
 challenged.
 This
 observation
 has
 raised
 a
 new
question:
 should
 clinicians
 proceed
 directly
 to
 surgery
 when
 clin-
ical
 observation
 fails
 in
 these
 cases
 or
 should
 endoscopy
 still
 be
attempted?
 The
 potential
 benefit
 of
 endoscopy
 is
 that
 it
 may
 be
used
 as
 a
 minimally
 invasive
 bridge
 to
 surgery
 in
 cases
 of
 failed
conservative
 management.
 There
 were
 no
 specific
 guidelines
 in
the
 management
 of
 this
 case
 [6,7].
 The
 object
 size
 described
 here
was
 within
 the
 upper
 limit
 of
 what
 would
 have
 also
 been
 consid-
ered
 for
 conservative
 management
 in
 prisoners
 [9].
 The
 presence
of
 continued
 symptoms
 and
 failure
 to
 progress
 within
 18
 h
 of
conservative
 management
 were
 indications
 for
 proceeding
 with
endoscopic
 removal
 under
 general
 anaesthesia.
 In
 this
 case
 report,
upper
 GI
 Endoscopy
 also
 helped
 to
 confirm
 the
 diagnosis
 as
 well
 as
the
 object’s
 failure
 to
 progress
 along
 the
 gastrointestinal
 tract.
Besides
 these
 clinical
 management
 pearls,
 there
 are
 also
 other
aspects
 of
 the
 endoscopic
 management
 of
 this
 patient
 which
 affect
industry
 and
 policy
 makers.
 Our
 experience
 in
 this
 case
 was
 that
 an
overtube
 was
 not
 an
 option
 due
 to
 the
 size
 of
 the
 object
 and
 we
 also
could
 not
 find
 any
 other
 suitable
 retrieval
 devices
 that
 ensured
 cor-
rect
 alignment
 for
 endoscopic
 removal
 of
 the
 mobile
 phone
 through
the
 oesophagogastric
 junction.
 Needed
 now
 is
 the
 development
of
 self-expandable
 overtubes
 that
 can
 accommodate
 such
 objects
without
 risk
 of
 damaging
 the
 oesophagus.
 The
 alternative
 is
 for
industry
 to
 create
 or
 improve
 on
 existing
 retrieval
 devices
 to
 ensure
adequate
 alignment
 for
 removal
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4.
 Such
 improve-
ment,
 ideally
 should
 be
 tested
 in-vitro
 before
 being
 considered
 in
human
 subjects.
 Successful
 endoscopic
 removal
 of
 a
 foreign
 object
obviates
 the
 need
 for
 surgery
 and
 associated
 morbidity.
 There
 are
also
 potential
 health
 savings
 in
 terms
 of
 reduced
 length
 of
 stay
 and
health
 costs
 if
 surgery
 could
 be
 avoided.
Finally,
 unlike
 most
 other
 cases
 of
 foreign
 body
 ingestion,
 the
specific
 case
 of
 ingestion
 of
 mobile
 phone
 is
 underreported
 in
the
 literature.
 The
 only
 case
 report
 of
 mobile
 phone
 ingestion
which
 we  could
 find
 in
 PUBMED
 database
 was
 that
 of
 a
 35-
year
 old
 intoxicated
 male
 with
 pharyngeal
 impaction
 by
 a
 mobile
phone
 who
 had
 the
 phone
 endoscopically
 removed
 under
 a
 gen-
eral
 anaesthesia
 [10].
 A
 few
 other
 anecdotal
 reports
 of
 mobile
phones
 lodged
 in
 the
 stomach
 exist
 in
 non-scientific
 literature,
but
 the
 current
 management,
 or
 quality
 improvement
 issues
 are
not
 entirely
 described.
 Besides
 detailing
 the
 full
 management
 of
such
 an
 under-reported
 case,
 we  have
 described
 how
 our
 findings
might
 affect
 clinicians,
 industry
 and
 policy
 makers.

 Conclusion
An
 ingested
 mobile
 phone
 in
 the
 stomach
 may
 not
 be
 amenable
for
 safe
 removal
 using
 the
 current
 endoscopic
 retrieval
 devices.
Therefore
 we
 recommend
 that
 all
 patients
 undergoing
 endoscopic
removal
 of
 a
 mobile
 phone
 should
 be
 consented
 for
 a
 laparotomy.
As
 well
 as
 this,
 there
 is
 need
 for
 the
 development
 of
 self-expandable
overtubes
 or
 additional
 improvement
 on
 existing
 retrieval
 devices
to
 ensure
 adequate
 alignment
 for
 removal
 without
 risks
 of
 damage
to
 the
 oesophagus.
