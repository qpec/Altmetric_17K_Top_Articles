Cardiac myosin binding protein-C Ser302
phosphorylation regulates cardiac b-adrenergic reserve
Ranganath Mamidi,1* Kenneth S. Gresham,2* Jiayang Li,1 Julian E. Stelzer1†
Phosphorylation of cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) modulates cardiac contractile function; however,
the specific roles of individual serines (Ser) within the M-domain that are targets for b-adrenergic signaling are not
known. Recently, we demonstrated that significant accelerations in in vivo pressure development following
b-agonist infusion can occur in transgenic (TG) mouse hearts expressing phospho-ablated Ser282 (that is, TGS282A)
but not in hearts expressing phospho-ablation of all three serines [that is, Ser273, Ser282, and Ser302 (TG3SA)], suggesting
an important modulatory role for other Ser residues. In this regard, there is evidence that Ser302 phosphorylation
may be a key contributor to the b-agonist–induced positive inotropic responses in the myocardium, but its precise
functional role has not been established. Thus, to determine the in vivo and in vitro functional roles of Ser302
phosphorylation, we generated TG mice expressing nonphosphorylatable Ser302 (that is, TGS302A). Left ventricular
pressure-volume measurements revealed that TGS302A mice displayed no accelerations in the rate of systolic pres-
sure rise and an inability to maintain systolic pressure following dobutamine infusion similar to TG3SA mice, im-
plicating Ser302 phosphorylation as a critical regulator of enhanced systolic performance during b-adrenergic
stress. Dynamic strain–induced cross-bridge (XB) measurements in skinned myocardium isolated from TGS302A
hearts showed that the molecular basis for impaired b-adrenergic–mediated enhancements in systolic function
is due to the absence of protein kinase A–mediated accelerations in the rate of cooperative XB recruitment. These
results demonstrate that Ser302 phosphorylation regulates cardiac contractile reserve by enhancing contractile
responses during b-adrenergic stress.
INTRODUCTION
Activation of the b-adrenergic signaling pathway rapidlyenhances ven-
tricular contraction to increase cardiac output in response to enhanced
systemic demand, via protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which phos-
phorylates keymyofilament proteins involved in the regulation of myo-
cardial force generation (1, 2). Previous studies have demonstrated
that cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) phosphorylation
regulates myofilament function by accelerating the rates of cross-bridge
(XB) cycling and force generation in response to PKA treatment (3, 4).
Animal models expressing phospho-ablated MyBP-C display an abol-
ished PKA-mediated enhancement of the magnitude and rate of co-
operative XB recruitment and force generation in skinned myocardium
(5, 6), which limits the magnitude and the acceleration of left ventricular
pressure generation in response to an acute b-agonist infusion (6–8).
Thus, increased MyBP-C phosphorylation appears to be a primary
mechanism by which the heart activates its contractile reserve under
conditions of increased cardiac stress (7).
Despite growing evidence demonstrating the importance of MyBP-C
phosphorylation in regulating in vivo cardiac contractile function, the
respective roles of individual MyBP-C phosphorylation residues are not
yet clear. In addition to PKA, which targets four M-domain MyBP-C
residues (Ser273, Ser282, Ser302, and Ser307 mouse MyBP-C numbering)
(9–13), individual MyBP-C residues are also selectively targeted by
non-PKA kinases (9, 14). Previous studies have demonstrated a role
for Ser282 phosphorylation in accelerating XB recruitment and force
generation (15, 16), which contributes to the in vivo acceleration of
systolic pressure development following b-adrenergic stimulation
(16, 17). However, significant acceleration of in vivo pressure develop-
ment was observed in Ser282 phospho-ablated mice following infusion
of the b-agonist dobutamine, whereas a complete MyBP-C phospho-
ablation (that is, Ser273, Ser282, and Ser302) abolished the acceleration
in the rate of pressure development (6, 7, 16), demonstrating that
phosphorylation of other PKA-targeted MyBP-C residues (Ser273 or
Ser302) must be critical for modulation of the contractile response to
increased b-adrenergic stimulation.
In addition to PKA, previous studies have shown that Ser302 can be
phosphorylated in vitro by several kinases, which are known to mod-
ulate cardiac function, such as PKC-ɛ (18), PKD (19), and glycogen
synthase kinase-3b (20). Furthermore, previous studies have suggested
that increased Ca2+-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity
due to increased cardiac pacing frequency enhances cardiac contrac-
tility, in part, due to increased Ser302 phosphorylation (21). We have
previously demonstrated that Ser302 phosphorylation was lower than
Ser273 or Ser282 phosphorylation at baseline and was increased by PKA
treatment to a greater extent than Ser273 and Ser282 phosphorylation
(7, 16). Thus, our hypothesis is that among MyBP-C phosphorylation
residues, Ser302 phosphorylation may be the principal MyBP-C res-
idue, which modulates the inotropic contractile response to enhanced
b-adrenergic activation, and that preventing Ser302 phosphorylation
impairs b-agonist–mediated enhancements in contractile response
and reduces cardiac contractile reserve. However, to date, no study
has examined the specific contribution of Ser302 phosphorylation to
in vivo contractile function. Therefore, to elucidate the precise roles
of Ser302 phosphorylation in modulating myofilament and in vivo
contractile function, we generated a novel transgenic (TG) mouse
model expressing MyBP-C with a nonphosphorylatable Ser302 (that
is, Ser302 to Ala302; TGS302A) and quantified the in vitro contractile re-
sponse of skinned myocardium isolated from TGS302A hearts to PKA
treatment and in vivo contractile function of TGS302A mice in response
to b-agonist infusion.

 RESULTS
Sarcomeric protein expression and phosphorylation
To examine the role of MyBP-C Ser302 phosphorylation in regulating
b-adrenergic enhancement of ventricular contraction and relaxation,
we generated a novel TG mouse line in which Ser302 was mutated to an
Ala residue to abolish phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Expression of TG
MyBP-C in TGS302A myocardial samples was confirmed by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 1B) and was detected as a full-length MyBP-C pro-
tein band at a molecular mass of ~150 kDa. Ser273 and Ser282 phospho-
rylation was detected in TGS302A samples and was similar to non-TG
(NTG) phosphorylation (TGS302A Ser273 phosphorylation was 106 ±
6% and Ser282 phosphorylation was 104 ± 14% of NTG phosphoryl-
ation; n = 5), but Ser302 phosphorylation was absent, confirming Ser302
phospho-ablation in TGS302A mice (Fig. 1B). TG MyBP-C expression
in TGS302A mice was determined to be 79 ± 15% of NTG MyBP-C
expression levels, similar to expression levels of MyBP-C TG mice in
previous studies (6, 16). MyBP-C phosphorylation at Ser273, Ser282,
and Ser302 was not detected in TGS3A mice, as previously reported
(Fig. 1B) (6, 7). The percentage of b-myosin heavy chain (MHC) expres-
sion in myocardium isolated from TGS302A (3.6 ± 1.5%) was found to be
similar to NTG myocardium (2.2 ± 1.2%), whereas b-MHC levels were
slightly elevated in TG3SA myocardium compared with NTG and
TGS302A myocardium (8.3 ± 1.7%; P < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). The expression
and phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins, including troponin I
(TnI), TnT, and regulatory light chain (RLC), were similar among all
three groups (Fig. 1, D and E).
Following PKA treatment, Ser273 and Ser282 phosphorylation levels
were similar between TGS302A and NTG samples (TGS302A Ser273 phos-
phorylation was 97 ± 10% and Ser282 phosphorylation was 95 ± 15% of
PKA-treated NTG phosphorylation; n = 3 to 5), demonstrating normal
PKA-mediated phosphorylation of these sites in the absence of Ser302
phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Ser302 phosphorylation was not detected in
TGS302A samples following PKA treatment, confirming Ser302 phospho-
ablation. TnI and TnT phosphorylation levels were similar between
TGS302A and NTG samples following PKA treatment. Phosphorylation
of RLC was unaffected by PKA treatment and was similar between
TGS302A and NTG samples under all conditions. Ser273, Ser282, and
Ser302 phosphorylation was not detected in TG3SA samples following
PKA treatment. These results demonstrate that TG expression of
S302A MyBP-C does not disrupt phosphorylation of other MyBP-C
Ser residues or phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins.

TG3SA, and TGS302A hearts are presented in Fig. 2A. TGS302A hearts

 alterations in chamber geometry or increased cardiac fibrosis (Fig. 2B)
when compared to control NTG hearts. In contrast to the cardiac hy-
pertrophy produced by complete MyBP-C phospho-ablation (Fig. 2
and Table 1), left ventricle (LV) mass and wall thickness were similar
between TGS302A and NTG mice as measured by echocardiography.
These results demonstrate that Ser302 phospho-ablation does not re-
sult in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
Basal cardiac function
Cardiac contractile and hemodynamic function was assessed by echo-
cardiography and pressure-volume (P-V) loop analysis to determine
the functional effects of Ser302 phospho-ablation. No changes in systolic
function or diastolic function as evidenced by measurements of ejection
fraction (EF) or isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were detected in
TGS302A mice compared to NTG controls (Table 1). Similarly, no dif-
ferences were detected in the rate of pressure development (dP/dtmax)
or relaxation (t) at baseline between TGS302A mice and NTG controls
(Table 2). In contrast, complete MyBP-C phospho-ablation in TG3SA
hearts resulted in slowed IVRT and reduced EF at baseline (Table 1),
consistent with previous studies (6, 7, 22).
b-Adrenergic reserve
The contribution of Ser302 phosphorylation to the contractile response
to b-adrenergic stimulation was assessed in TGS302A mice following do-
butamine infusion. The postdobutamine dP/dtmax in TGS302A mice was
slower than in dobutamine-treated NTG mice (P < 0.005; Table 2 and
Fig. 3A), and the rate of pressure development throughout early systole
in dobutamine-treated TGS302A mice was lower when compared to the
rate of pressure development observed in dobutamine-treated NTG
mice (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that Ser302 phosphorylation is required
to accelerate pressure development following b-adrenergic stimulation.
The acceleration in pressure development in NTG mice following do-
butamine increased early systolic developed pressure levels compared to
baseline (Fig. 3), but the impaired acceleration in pressure development

 in TGS302A mice prevented an increase in developed pressure, resulting
in developed pressure levels that were similar to NTG mice before do-
butamine treatment (Fig. 3). Additionally, maximal systolic pressure
was lower in TGS302A mice following dobutamine treatment compared
to NTG controls (P < 0.005; Table 2). The impaired acceleration in pres-
sure development and decreased maximal systolic pressure observed in
TGS302A mice were also observed in TG3SA mice, consistent with our
previous study (7). There were no differences in the rate or magnitude
of pressure development following dobutamine treatment between
TG3SA and TGS302A mice (Table 2), suggesting that phosphorylation
of Ser273 and Ser282 cannot compensate for the loss of Ser302 phospho-
rylation following b-adrenergic stimulation. Similar to previous re-
ports of individual MyBP-C Ser residue phospho-ablation (16), Ser302
phospho-ablation didnot disrupt normal acceleration of diastolic pres-
sure relaxation because dobutamine accelerated relaxation to a similar
extent in TGS302A and NTG mice (Table 2), in contrast to TG3SA mice,
which displayed slowed relaxation following dobutamine treatment.
Basal myofilament contractile function
The effects of Ser302 phospho-ablation on myofilament contractile
properties were assessed in skinned myocardium isolated from TGS302A

 typical stretch activation response in skinned myocardium isolated
from NTG, TG3SA, and TGS302A hearts and highlights the parameters
assessed in the resultant force transients following the imposed stretch.
Under basal conditions, the rate of delayed force development following
the imposed stretch (that is, kdf) and the magnitude of XB recruitment
(that is, Pdf) were not different between the NTG and TGS302A groups,
whereas TG3SA myocardium displayed diminished Pdf (Table 3). How-
ever, the rate of force decay (krel) in TGS302A myocardium was slower
than that in NTG myocardium (P = 0.01) and was not different from
TG3SA skinned myocardium (Table 3). Additionally, P2 values in
TGS302A skinned myocardium were higher than those in NTG myocar-
dium (P = 0.03) and were similar to TG3SA values, indicating that the
magnitude of strain-induced XB detachment was lower in the TGS302A
and TG3SA groups. No differences in Ca2+-activated maximal force
(Fmax), Ca2+-independent force (Fmin), Ca2+ sensitivity of force devel-
opment (pCa50), or cooperativity of force development (nH) were ob-
served between the NTG, TG3SA, and TGS302A groups (Table 4),
indicating that differences in dynamic XB behavior were not due to
changes in Ca2+-mediated thin filament activation.
Myofilament contractile function following PKA treatment
Following PKA treatment, both TGS302A and TG3SA skinned myocar-
dium displayed slower rates of stretch-induced delayed force develop-
ment (kdf) compared to NTG myocardium (Table 3 and Fig. 4D). PKA
treatment accelerated kdf by ~65 ± 17% (P < 0.005) in NTG myocar-
dium but had no effect on kdf in TGS302A or TG3SA myocardium, de-
monstrating that Ser302 phospho-ablation impairs PKA-mediated
accelerations in the rate of XB recruitment to the same extent as
complete MyBP-C phospho-ablation. Following PKA incubation, P3
was increased by ~43 ± 9% (P < 0.005) and ~25 ± 6% (P = 0.005) in the
NTG and TGS302A groups but not in the TG3SA group (Fig. 5A).
TGS302A skinned myocardium also displayed an impaired magnitude
of XB recruitment (Pdf) following PKA treatment compared to NTG
myocardium (Table 3). Whereas Pdf was increased by PKA incubation
by ~84 ± 14% (P < 0.005), ~61 ± 12% (P < 0.005), and ~61 ± 9% (P <
0.005) in the NTG, TG3SA, and TGS302A groups (Fig. 5B), respectively
(Table 3), Pdf was higher in the NTG group compared to the TGS302A
group (P < 0.005), demonstrating that Ser302 phospho-ablation blunts
the PKA-mediated enhancement in the overall magnitude of XB
recruitment.
In addition to enhancing the rate of delayed force development,
PKA treatment also accelerated the rate and magnitude of force decay
following stretch. In NTG myocardium, PKA treatment accelerated
the rate of force decay (~80 ± 13% increase in krel; P < 0.005) and
produced a greater magnitude of force decay (that is, more negative
P2 values). However, the PKA-mediated acceleration in force decay was

contractile behavior. In (A), highlighted are the important phases of the force transients and the various stretch activation parameters that are derived from the elicited
force response (see Materials and Methods for explanation of each phase and parameters). PKA incubation accelerated both krel (P < 0.005) and kdf (P < 0.005) in NTG
skinned myocardium. However, in the TGS302A skinned myocardium, the PKA-mediated acceleration in krel is less pronounced (P = 0.02) than that in the NTG coupled with
no PKA-mediated accelerations in kdf. There were no PKA-mediated accelerations in krel and kdf in TG3SA skinned myocardium. AU, arbitrary units.

 blunted in TGS302A myocardium (~45 ± 8% increase in krel; P < 0.005)
and resulted in krel values similar to pre-PKA krel values in NTG
skinned myocardium (Table 3), suggesting that Ser302 phosphorylation
is required for complete acceleration of the rate of XB detachment
following PKA treatment. PKA incubation also decreased P2 values
in the TGS302A group but to a lesser extent than in the NTG group
(Table 3). PKA treatment did not accelerate krel (Fig. 5C) or decrease
P2 amplitude in TG3SA myocardium when compared to the NTG
group, as previously reported (5).
PKA treatment similarly decreased the pCa50 in all the groups, and
no differences were observed in Fmax, Fmin, and nH between groups
before or following PKA treatment (Table 4). Therefore, our data in-
dicate that Ser302 phospho-ablation does not affect the Ca2+-sensitivity
of force generation and that the impaired acceleration in force decay
and delayed force development in TGS302A skinned myocardium are
due to a diminished PKA-mediated enhancement of XB kinetics in the
absence of Ser302 phosphorylation.
DISCUSSION
Although augmented ventricular function during b-adrenergic stimu-
lation requires MyBP-C phosphorylation, it is unclear howSer302 phos-
phorylation contributes to enhanced myofilament and whole-heart
contractile function. Therefore, to define the effects of Ser302 phospho-
rylation on in vitro and in vivo contractile function, we generated novel
TG mice expressing nonphosphorylatable MyBP-C Ser302 (that is,
TGS302A). Our findings show that Ser302 phospho-ablation did not dis-
rupt PKA-mediated phosphorylation of neighboring MyBP-C Ser re-
sidues (that is, 273 and 282) or other sarcomeric proteins and did not
induce significant maladaptive cardiac remodeling or altered basal ven-
tricular function. However, Ser302 phospho-ablation largely prevented
b-adrenergic enhancement of the rate of systolic pressure development
and decreased maximal systolic pressure following b-adrenergic stim-
ulation, demonstrating that Ser302 phosphorylation is the predomi-
nant MyBP-C residue responsible for regulation of cardiac systolic
b-adrenergic reserve. Measurements of dynamic XB behavior re-
vealed that loss of b-adrenergic reserve at the whole-heart level was
mirrored by the loss of PKA-mediated accelerations in cooperative
XB recruitment into the force-generating states at the myofilament
level. Collectively, our data show that MyBP-C Ser302 phosphorylation
is required to enhance force and pressure generation during enhanced
b-adrenergic signaling and uniquely equips the heart with a func-
tional reserve to meet higher circulatory demands during b-adrenergic
stimulation.

 Ser302 phosphorylation is required for complete cooperative
recruitment of XBs during submaximal Ca2+ activation
MyBP-C Ser302 phosphorylation is relatively lower than Ser273 and
Ser282 under basal conditions but is highly phosphorylated following
PKA incubation (16, 23); therefore, it is expected that MyBP-C Ser302
phosphorylation substantially contributes to enhanced contractile
performance following b-adrenergic stimulation. Our data show that
TGS302A skinned myocardium displayed a slowed rate and diminished
magnitude of XB detachment (krel and P2), along with a reduced mag-
nitude of cooperative XB recruitment (Pdf) compared to NTG skinned
myocardium, suggesting that ablation of even low levels of basal Ser302
phosphorylation impairs dynamic XB behavior (Table 3). Following
PKA incubation, functional differences between TGS302A and NTG
skinned myocardium were amplified. Although we observed PKA-
induced accelerations in krel and enhancements in P2 (indicating in-
creases in both the rate and magnitude of XB detachment in TGS302A
skinned myocardium), the effects were smaller than NTG skinned
myocardium (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Notably, unlike NTG skinned myo-
cardium, following PKA incubation, TGS302A skinned myocardium
did not display significant accelerations in kdf, an indicator of the rate
of cooperative XB recruitment into the force-generating XB pool. This
finding is in agreement with an earlier study, which showed that
selective phosphorylation of Ser302 by PKD accelerates the rate of
tension redevelopment in wild-type mouse myocardium (19). Addi-
tionally, PKA-induced enhancement in Pdf, which is an indicator of
the magnitude of XB recruitment into the force-generating XB pool,
was also blunted in TGS302A skinned myocardium when compared
to the NTG skinned myocardium, indicating that Ser302 phosphoryl-
ation modulates the overall number of cooperatively recruited force-
generating XBsduring PKA-mediated myofilament activation. Previous
studies using intact mouse papillary fibers showed that increased
pacing frequency (an activator of CaMKIId, which targets Ser302 pri-
marily and Ser282 to a lesser degree) accelerates the rates of force
development and relaxation in wild-type fibers but these responses
are diminished in TG3SA fibers, indicating that phospho-ablation of
MyBP-C depresses CaMKIId-mediated enhancements in contractile
function (21). However, under normal physiological conditions, the
immediate/short-term demand for increased cardiac inotropy is primarily
met by PKA activation, which provides an acute boost in contractility due
to phosphorylation of all three Ser residues, whereas the need for pro-
longed increases in cardiac contractile function [that is, prolonged
increases in pacing frequency (21)] may be met by increased CaMKII
activation, which phosphorylates only a subset of Ser residues (24).
Thus, it is likely that PKA-mediated Ser302 phosphorylation is the
main contributor to b-adrenergic stimulation–mediated enhancements
in cardiac contractility under normal physiological conditions.
The magnitude of cooperative XB recruitment and binding to the
thin filaments is influenced both by Ca2+ binding to TnC and by XB
binding to actin. Ca2+ binding to TnC rapidly turns on the thin fil-
ament regulatory units and opens up the myosin binding sites on
actin by displacing the tropomyosin to facilitate XB binding, which
allows for propagation of XB-mediated cooperative XB recruitment
along neighboring thin filament regulatory units (25). Cooperative
XB-mediated recruitment of additional XBs is further facilitated by
PKA phosphorylation of MyBP-C (26), which accelerates XB transi-
tions to force-bearing states and enhances the probability of actomy-
osin interactions by displacing and orienting the XBs away from the
thick filament backbone toward the actin sites (27) and also by redu-
cing XB ontime, which allows for accelerated XB turnover and recruit-
ment of additional XBs to vacated myosin binding sites on actin (26).
The mechanism by which MyBP-C phosphorylation enhances coop-
erative XB recruitment may be due to enhanced thin filament activa-
tion upon binding of phosphorylated MyBP-C to actin, which induces
displacement of tropomyosin to the open state (28), or due to reduced
binding of MyBP-C to myosin S2, which facilities XB binding to actin
(29–32), or both. Thus, at submaximal Ca2+ activations, MyBP-C
phosphorylation not only accelerates the rate of force development
but also expands the spread of thin filament activation beyond regu-
latory units that have already been activated by Ca2+, thereby shifting
the net equilibrium of myosin XBs toward the force-bearing states and
greatly enhancing myocardial force generation (26). In contrast, a re-
duction in MyBP-C Ser302 phosphorylation would be expected to slow
cooperativeXB recruitment and turnover, thereby disrupting the equi-
librium of XB transitions into the force-generating pool, which in turn
limits systolic pressure generation during b-adrenergic stimulation.
However, as the level of Ca2+-activation increases, myofilament force
generation becomes less reliant on cooperative XB recruitment be-
cause more thin filament regulatory units are directly activated by
Ca2+, and thus, the modulatory influence of MyBP-C phosphorylation
on XB behavior diminishes (5, 12).
MyBP-C Ser302 phosphorylation is required to enhance
systolic pressure development
Although all three M-domain MyBP-C residues are targets of PKA
phosphorylation, Ser302 phosphorylation is observed at low levels
in vivo and is lower than the other two PKA-targeted sites, Ser273 and
Ser282 (16, 23). Because the pool of MyBP-C that can be phosphorylated
at Ser302 following b-adrenergic stimulation (~95% of total MyBP-C) is
larger than for Ser273 and Ser282, loss of phosphorylation at Ser302 would
be expected to reduce the recruitable pool of force-generating XBs to
a greater extent than loss of phosphorylation at the other PKA sites
in response to b-adrenergic signaling. The rate of pressure develop-
ment and maximal developed pressure were not different between
TG3SA and TGS302A mice following dobutamine treatment, suggesting

 that phosphorylation of Ser302 was needed to recruit the reserve force-
generating XBs to enhance pressure development above basal levels.
Previous studies have suggested that in addition to the known PKA
phosphorylation residues Ser273, Ser282, and Ser302, a fourth residue,
Ser307, may also be a target of PKA phosphorylation (9–13). However,
TG3SA hearts did not exhibit systolic enhancements following dobuta-
mine treatment despite expressing a phosphorylatable Ser307 residue,
suggesting that Ser307 is unlikely to be involved in modulating the mo-
lecularandin vivo behaviorsthatwemeasuredinthisstudy. Together,our
data suggest that Ser302 is the primary MyBP-C residue that modulates the
positive inotropic response to enhanced b-adrenergic stimulation.
By preventing the recruitment of additional XBs following
b-adrenergic stimulation, Ser302 phospho-ablation slowed pressure
development and reduced maximal systolic pressure development
without disrupting basal systolic pressure development. Loss of
phosphorylation at Ser302 did not produce pathological cardiac hy-
pertrophy or notable changes in basal unstressed ventricular function,
perhaps because the primary role of Ser302 phosphorylation is to pro-
mote greater XB recruitment at higher workloads when b-adrenergic
signaling is enhanced. This is also consistent with the observation
that myocardial force generation is unaltered at baseline but cannot
be enhanced by PKA or CaMKII (which targets Ser302) in myocar-
dium expressing nonphosphorylatable MyBP-C (21) because the
reserve pool of recruitable XBs is reduced by Ser302 phospho-ablation.
It was proposed that Ca2+ is released from ryanodine receptors near
the Z line in myocytes and diffuses toward the center of the sarcomere
(13): first, activating thin filament regulatory units in the region of the
sarcomere that does not contain MyBP-C and, subsequently, activating
the thin filament in MyBP-C–containing regions. Increased Ca2+ re-
lease following b-adrenergic stimulation would beexpected toincrease
XB recruitment, in part, by increasing thin filament activation closer
to the center of the sarcomere, in the region of the sarcomere regulated
by MyBP-C. Thus, MyBP-C phospho-ablation would limit the re-
cruitment of additional XBs in this region of the sarcomere following
b-adrenergic signaling, thereby reducing the pool of recruitable XBs
compared to the myofilaments expressing phosphorylatable MyBP-C.
MyBP-C phosphorylation– and Ca2+-dependent regulation of XB re-
cruitment could also explain the temporal pattern of enhanced pressure
development following b-adrenergic signaling (Fig. 3). The recruitment
of XBs not regulated by MyBP-C would produce an initial increase in
pressure as cytosolic Ca2+ levels increase, followed by dobutamine-
mediated acceleration of pressure development (observed after several
milliseconds) due to recruitment of newly available XBs following
MyBP-C phosphorylation to force-generating states.
Previously, it has been suggested that cardiac thick filaments har-
bor a subpopulation of super-relaxed (SRX) myosin headsthat are char-
acterized by substantially slower adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)
turnover rates (33, 34) and thereby equipping the cardiac contractile
apparatus with a reserve of inactive myosin heads that can potentially
be recruited into the force-bearing state under conditions of increased
cardiac stress (35). Previous findings demonstrate that MyBP-C mod-
ulates the SRX state of myosin heads via its ability to interact with and
position the myosin heads closer to the thick filament backbone and
that a loss of MyBP-C decreases the number of SRX myosin heads
(36). Thus, ablation of Ser302 phosphorylation will potentially main-
tain the interactions of MyBP-C–SRX heads and possibly prevent
them from being recruited toward the myosin binding sites on actin
filaments, effectively reducing the number of XBs that can be recruited
during thin filament activation. This suggests that a possible role of
MyBP-C is to regulate the recruitable pool of XBs to fine-tune force
generation during a cardiac twitch, with enhanced b-adrenergic sig-
naling accelerating the initial rate of pressure development at higher
workloads by increasing XB recruitment through MyBP-C Ser302
phosphorylation. MyBP-C dephosphorylation limits this recruitable
pooland prevents enhancedcontraction in response to increasedpacing
or b-adrenergic signaling (7, 21), and loss of this regulation leads to
altered timing of the cardiac cycle and a mismatch between ejection
and filling (7).
CONCLUSIONS
Dephosphorylation of MyBP-C, and reduced Ser302 phosphorylation
(37, 38), in particular, has been documented in conditions of chronic
human heart failure (HF) (37, 39), including patients exhibiting HF
with preserved EF (HFpEF) (40), a detrimental condition caused by
a complex interplay of deficits in both diastolic and systolic reserves
(41). Notably, cardiac dysfunction in HFpEF is often not apparent at
rest but becomes noticeable during stress or increased workloads, sug-
gesting that an inability to modulate cardiac output leads to exercise
intolerance in HFpEF patients (41). Myocardial samples isolated from
HF patients also display desensitization of b-adrenergic signaling
pathway (42) that produces a reduction in PKA-mediated phosphoryl-
ation of myofilament contractile proteins, including MyBP-C (37, 43).
Recentevidence demonstrates thatthe lossof MyBP-C phosphorylation
directly blunts enhanced myocardial force generation and ventricular
pressure development in response to increased workloads (7, 21). Here,

Measurements were again made on the same preparations following PKA incuba-
tion. The net changes in stretch activation parameters after PKA incubation were
calculated and are expressed as % increases from baseline for (A) the magnitude of
new steady-state force attained in response to stretch in ML, P3; (B) the magnitude
of overall XB recruitment in response to stretch in ML, Pdf; and (C) the rate of XB
detachment, krel in the NTG, TG3SA, and TGS302A groups. PKA treatment enhanced
the Pdf in all the groups, but the PKA-mediated enhancements in Pdf were lower in
the TG3SA and TGS302A groups when compared to the NTG group, indicating that
the magnitude of XB recruitment occurs to a lesser extent in the TG3SA and TGS302A
groups. NTG preparations displayed accelerations in krel following PKA incubation;
however, this acceleration in krel was less pronounced in the TGS302A group and is
completely absent in the TG3SA group. Similar effects were observed for P3. Values

 we show that abolishing Ser302 phosphorylation greatly diminishes the
cardiac b-adrenergic reserve by blunting PKA-mediated enhancements
in XB kinetics and dobutamine-mediated enhancements in systolic
pressure generation, similar to the effects of abolishing all three PKA
phosphorylation residues. These results establish MyBP-C Ser302 as a
critical modulator of cardiac output at higher workloads and suggest
that therapeutic strategies designed to boost Ser302 phosphorylation
could be beneficial for contractile function and enhance cardiac output
in HF patients with reduced cardiac b-adrenergic reserve.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval and animal treatment protocols
Experiments were conducted according to the procedures laid out in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [National Institutes
of Health (NIH) Publication No. 85-23, Revised 1996] and as per the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
Case Western Reserve University. NTG wild-type mice expressing
full-length MyBP-C and TG mice expressing nonphosphorylatable
MyBP-C with Ser-to-Alasubstitutions at Ser273, Ser282, and Ser302 (that
is, TG3SA) (6, 16) were used as control groups. TG mice expressing
MyBP-C with Ser-to-Ala substitution at Ser302 (that is, TGS302A) were
generated on a MyBP-C–null background such that there is no endoge-
nous Ser302 phosphorylation. All mouse lines were of the SV/129 strain,
and adult mice (3 to 6 months old) of both sexes were used for this study.
Determination of sarcomeric protein phosphorylation and
MHC expression
Western blot and Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain (Life Tech-
nologies) were used to assess myofilament protein phosphorylation, as
described previously (16, 44). On the day of the experiment, cardiac
myofibrils were prepared by briefly homogenizing frozen mouse ven-
tricular tissue for 15 s using a handheld homogenizer (PowerGen 500,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) in relaxing solution that contains protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP and cOmplete ULTRA Tablets,
Roche Applied Science). Myofibrils were chemically skinned for 15 min
using 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min, and resus-
pended in fresh relaxing solution on ice until further use. For PKA treat-
ment, 100 mg of myofibrils isolated from hearts of each mouse line was
incubated with the catalytic subunit of bovine PKA (Sigma-Aldrich) to
a final concentration of 0.15 U PKA/mg myofibrils for 1 hour at 30°C,
and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer (16).
Control myofibrils were incubated under the same conditions without
PKA. For Western blots, myofibrils were separated on 4 to 20% tris-
glycine gels (Lonza), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes, and incubated overnight with one of the following primary
antibodies: MyBP-C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); MyBP-C phospho–
serine 273, 282, or 302 (detects phosphorylation of Ser273, Ser282, or
Ser302 of MyBP-C; 21st Century Biochemicals); or HSC70 as a loading
control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PVDF membranes were then in-
cubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and imaged. For esti-
mating total myofilament protein phosphorylation, myofibrils were
separated on 4 to 20% tris-glycine gels and stained with Pro-Q phos-
phostain. Pro-Q–stained gels were counterstained with Coomassie Blue
to determine total protein content. Myocardial samples were run on 5%
tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad, #3450001), followed by staining with silver stain
plus (Bio-Rad, #1610449) to quantify the MHC expression as b-MHC
percentage of the total MHC expression in the sarcomere (n = 6 per
group). MHC gels were run at 150 V for 4 hours at 4°C (6). Densito-
metric scanning of the stained gels was done using ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD) (16).
Histological analysis of cardiac tissue
To examine cardiac morphology, excised hearts were submerged in
formalin for 4 hours and sectioned at the mid-LV, as previously de-
scribed (7). Hearts were paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 5 mm
thickness before staining with Masson’s trichrome.
Cardiac morphology, contractile function, and in vivo
hemodynamic function
Cardiac morphology (that is, left ventricular wall thickness) and in vivo
systolic (that is, EF) and diastolic (that is, IVRT) function were evalu-
atedbyechocardiography,as previously described(7). In vivoP-V loop
analysis was used to evaluate hemodynamic function, as previously
described (7, 16). For in vivo experiments, stable baseline measure-
ments of maximal systolic pressure, end diastolic pressure, the maxi-
mum rate of systolic pressure development (dP/dtmax), and the time
constant of diastolic pressure relaxation (t) were made before intra-
peritoneal injection of dobutamine (10 mg/g) to measure the response
to increased b-adrenergic stimulation. P-V loops were analyzed offline
using LabChart 7 software (ADInstruments).
Preparation of skinned myocardial preparations and Ca2+
solutions for mechanical experiments
Myocardial preparations were skinned, as previously described (16). In
brief, frozen ventricular tissue pieces were homogenized in a relaxing
solution,followedbydetergentskinningusing1%TritonX-100(Thermo
Scientific) for 1 hour. Multicellular ventricular preparations measuring
~100mminwidthand~400mminlengthwereselectedforthemechanical
experiments. The composition of Ca2+ activation solutions prepared for
the experiments was based on a computer program (45) and established
stability constants (46). Ca2+ solutions contained the following: 14.5 mM
creatine phosphate, 7 mM EGTA, and 20 mM imidazole. The maximal
activatingsolution(pCa4.5;pCa=−log[Ca2+]free)alsocontained65.45KCl,
7.01 CaCl2; 5.27 MgCl2, 4.81 ATP, whereas the relaxing solution (pCa
9.0) contained 72.45 mM KCl, 0.02 mM CaCl2; 5.42 mM MgCl2, 4.76
mM ATP. The pH and the ionic strength of the Ca2+ solutions were
set to 7.0 and 180 mM, respectively. A range of pCa solutions (pCa 6.3
to 5.4) containing varying amounts of [Ca2+]free were then prepared by
mixing appropriate volumes of pCa 9.0 and 4.5. stock solutions, and the
mechanical experiments were performed at 23°C.
Experimental setup for measurement of dynamic and
steady-state contractile properties in skinned myocardium
Detergent-skinned multicellular ventricular preparations were attached
between a motor arm (312C, Aurora Scientific Inc.) and a force trans-
ducer (403A, Aurora Scientific Inc.), as described previously (47).
Changes in the motor arm position and force transducer signals were
sampled at 2000 Hz using a custom-built sarcomere length (SL) control
software program developed by Campbell and Moss (48). For all
mechanical measurements, SL of the ventricular preparations was set
to 2.1 mm (16). Force-pCa relationships were determined by incubating
the skinned myocardial preparations in pCa solutions ranging from
pCa 6.3 to 4.5. The apparent cooperativity of force generation was
estimated from the steepness of Hill plot transformation of the force-
pCa relationships (44). The force-pCa data were fit using the equation
P/P0 = [Ca2+]nH/(knH + [Ca2+]nH), where nH is the Hill coefficient and k
is the pCa needed to elicit half-maximal force (that is, pCa50) (44).

 Stretch activation experiments to measure dynamic XB
contractile parameters
The stretch activation protocol used in these studies was described ear-
lier (3, 16, 49). Skinned myocardial preparations were placed in Ca2+
solutions (pCa 6.1) that generate ~35% of the maximal force. Once the
preparations attained a steady-state force, they were rapidly stretched
by 2% of their initial ML, held at the new ML for 8 s, and then returned
back to their initial ML. The key features of the stretch activation re-
sponses in cardiac muscle have been described earlier (50, 51), and var-
ious stretch activation parameters measured are illustrated in Fig. 4A.
In brief, a sudden 2% stretch in ML causes an instantaneous spike in
the force response (P1), which is due to the sudden strain of elastic
elements within the strongly bound XBs (phase 1). The force then ra-
pidly decays (phase 2) because of the detachment of the strained XBs
into a non–force-bearing state, with a dynamic rate constant krel (an
index of XB detachment). The lowest point of phase 2 (nadir) is indi-
cated by P2 and is an index of the magnitude of XB detachment.
Following phase 2, the preparations exhibit a gradual rise of force
(phase 3), with a dynamic rate constant kdf (an index of the rate of
XB recruitment). The delayed force rise in phase 3 is due to the sudden
stretch-mediated recruitment of new XBs into the force-bearing state
(50, 51). Stretch activation amplitudes, P3 and Pdf, were normalized to
prestretch Ca2+-activated force where P3 was measured from pre-
stretch steady-state force to the peak force value of the delayed force
attained in phase 3, whereas Pdf was measured as the difference be-
tween P3 and P2 values, as described previously (3, 4, 47).
krel was measured by fitting a single exponential equation to the time
course of force decay using the equation: F(t) = a(−1 + exp(−krel*t)),
where “a” is the amplitude of the single exponential phase and krel is
the rate constant of the force decay, as done earlier (5). kdf, which re-
presents the rate of recruitment of all XBs that give rise to the delayed
force transient following the sudden stretch in ML (that is, Pdf), was
estimated by linear transformation of the half-time of force redevelop-
ment (5), that is, kdf = 0.693/t1/2, where t1/2 is the time (in milliseconds)
taken from the nadir (that is, the point of force reuptake at the end of
phase 2) to the point of half-maximal force in phase 3 of the force re-
sponse, where maximal force is indicated by a plateau region of phase 3
(that is, P3) (Fig. 4A) (5).
Stretch activation experiments were repeated following incuba-
tion of the myocardial preparations with PKA. Because PKA treat-
ment decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation, we
used a pCa solution with slightly higher [Ca2+]free (pCa 6.0) to closely
match the activation levels before PKA treatment, as done in earlier
studies (5, 16).
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
and multiple pairwise comparisons were made using Fisher’s least sig-
nificant difference (Fisher’s LSD) method, as previously reported (44).
One-way ANOVA was used for analyzing the data reported for echo-
cardiography experiments. Values are reported as means ± SEM. The
criterion for statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, and the asterisks
in the figures and tables denote statistical significance using post hoc
Fisher’s LSD comparisons.
