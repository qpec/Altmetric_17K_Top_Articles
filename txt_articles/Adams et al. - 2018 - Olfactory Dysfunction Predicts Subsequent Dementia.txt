OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between
olfactory
dysfunction
and
subsequent
diagnosis
of
dementia.
DESIGN: Longitudinal study of a population representa-
tive of U.S. older adults.
SETTING: Home
interviews
(National
Social
Life,
Health, and Aging Project).
PARTICIPANTS: Men
and
women
aged
57
to
85
(N = 2,906).
MEASUREMENTS: Objective odor identification ability
was measured at baseline using a validated five-item test.
Five years later, the respondent, or a proxy if the respondent
was too sick to interview or had died, reported physician
diagnosis of dementia. The association between baseline
olfactory dysfunction and an interval dementia diagnosis
was tested using multivariate logistic regression, controlling
for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, comorbidities
(modified Charlson Comorbidity Index), and cognition at
baseline (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire).
RESULTS: Older adults with olfactory dysfunction had
more than twice the odds of having developed dementia
5 years later (odds ratio = 2.13, 95% confidence inter-
val = 1.32–3.43), controlling for the above covariates.
Having more odor identification errors was associated
with greater probability of an interval dementia diagnosis
(P = .04, 1-degree of freedom linear-trend test).
CONCLUSION: We show for the first time in a nation-
ally representative sample that home-dwelling older adults
with normal cognition and difficulty identifying odors face
higher odds of being diagnosed with dementia 5 years
later, independent of other significant risk factors. This
validated five-item odor identification test is an efficient,
low-cost component of the physical examination that can
provide useful information while assessing individuals’ risk
of dementia. Use of such testing may provide an opportu-
nity for early interventions to reduce the attendant morbid-
ity and public health burden of dementia. J Am Geriatr

O
lder adults with dementia have been found in cross-
sectional studies to have a greater prevalence of
olfactory dysfunction than those without dementia,1 but in
the few longitudinal studies that have assessed whether
olfactory dysfunction precedes the development of Alzhei-
mer’s disease (AD), the most-common type of dementia,2–7
not all found a significant predictive relationship. More-
over, subjects in these longitudinal studies were from
at-risk groups, relatively small samples, or homogenous
populations. In some studies, it was also possible that the
apparent predictive power of olfaction was an artifact of
its association with cognitive abilities at baseline and did
not have predictive power in addition to the predictive
effects of baseline cognition itself. Thus, it is uncertain
whether olfactory dysfunction is a predictive marker of
subsequent dementia in the diverse general population of
older U.S. adults. We investigated the relationship between
olfactory dysfunction and a diagnosis of dementia within
5 years in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Pro-
ject (NSHAP), a nationally representative probability sam-
ple of home-dwelling Americans aged 57 to 85.

 follow-up (2010–11) in their homes by professional inter-
viewers (from NORC at the University of Chicago) after
excluding respondents who reported a preexisting physi-
cian diagnosis of dementia (0.7%), those who did not
complete olfactory testing (2.2%), and those who did not
provide complete demographic information (0.4%). Both
interviews included assessments of demographic, social,
psychological, and biological measures, including olfactory
ability. To select its sample, NSHAP followed a standard
multistage area probability sample design, covering all geo-
graphic areas of the United States. This sample is represen-
tative of the U.S. home-dwelling population aged 57 to 85
(born 1920–1947).8 Further details regarding study design
and data collection are published elsewhere.9 By design,
the population was cognitively intact at baseline (mean

score 9.2 � 1.0 out of 10). Additional baseline characteris-
tics of the population are presented in Table 1. The insti-
tutional review boards at NORC and the University of
Chicago approved this study.
Olfactory Assessment at Baseline
Objective odor identification ability was evaluated at base-
line using a validated five-item test.10,11 Odors were pre-
sented
using
odor
pens
(Sniffin’
Sticks,
Burghart
Messtechnik, Wedel, Germany), and respondents were
asked to identify each odor by choosing from a set of four
picture or word prompts. Refusals were coded as incorrect.
Using previously validated cutpoints10,11, respondents who
identified four or five odors correctly were classified as
normosmic, whereas those who identified three or fewer
odors correctly were classified as having some form of
olfactory dysfunction. Using these criteria, 22.0% of older
U.S. adults had objective olfactory dysfunction, a percent-
age that aligns with other estimates of olfactory dysfunc-
tion in older adults.12,13
Interval Dementia Diagnosis at 5-Year Follow-Up
At 5-year follow-up, we determined physician diagnosis of
dementia during home interviews with the respondent, or
a proxy if the respondent was too sick to interview or had
died. Prior studies have found that proxy reports of date
and cause of death match or exceed the accuracy of infor-
mation from death certificates and that proxy reports of
dementia are reasonably accurate when compared with
psychometric testing.14–16
Proxy interviews were unattainable for 296 respon-
dents (10.2%). We classified these respondents conserva-
tively
as
normal.
We
found
similar
effect
sizes
and
significance levels when we classified all of them as having
dementia or excluded them altogether.
Potential Confounding Variables
Our
analyses
accounted
for
numerous
potential
con-
founders, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, education,
comorbidity,
and
baseline
cognition
(Supplementary
Table S1). Age and sex have long been known to be asso-
ciated with olfactory function.12 Race, an established
olfactory
risk
factor,17
was
measured
according
to
self-report using standard National Institutes of Health
questions. Respondents were classified as white, black, or
Hispanic. (Those who reported their race as black or Afri-
can American and answered “yes” to Hispanic ethnicity
were classified as black.) Small sample sizes necessitated
combining those reporting their race as American Indian
or Alaskan Native, Asian, or other into a single “other”
category. Education was measured according to highest
degree or certification earned. Comorbid diseases were
measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index modified
for the NSHAP survey.
It is likely that baseline cognitive function of respon-
dents may influence subsequent development of dementia.
We previously reported in a cross-sectional analysis that
olfaction is associated with cognition within the normal
cognitive range.18 Therefore, cognitive function at baseline
was included as a covariate to test the hypothesis that
olfactory
dysfunction
would
predict
development
of
dementia after accounting for baseline cognition itself.
Cognitive function at baseline was measured using a modi-
fied version of the Short Portable Mental Status Question-
naire (SPMSQ; range 0–10).
Statistical Analysis
NSHAP used a national probability sample of home-dwell-

 were considered excellent for surveys of this type: 75.5%
at baseline (2005–06) and 74% at follow-up (2010–11;
the conditional response rate among returning respondents
was 89%). In addition, NSHAP oversampled blacks, His-
panics, men, and older individuals to obtain roughly equal
numbers of sampled individuals in each of six sex-by-age
categories.8 Respondent-level weights were calculated to
adjust for differential nonresponse to survey participation
and the planned oversampling based on race and ethnicity,
sex, and age. This permits estimation of parameters for the
U.S. population of older home-dwelling adults.10,11 All
values
presented
use
these
respondent-level
weights.
Design-based standard errors were calculated using the lin-
earization method together with the strata and Primary
Sampling unit indicators provided with the dataset. Sensi-
tivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and nega-
tive
predictive
value
were
calculated
using
standard
formulas. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
We tested the association between baseline olfactory
dysfunction and an interval dementia diagnosis using mul-
tivariate logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, race
and ethnicity, education, comorbidities, and baseline cog-
nitive function. We tested the incremental risk attributed
to each additional odor identification error using a 1–de-
gree of freedom linear trend test. Results are presented as
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sta-
tistical significance was set at P < .05.
RESULTS
At 5-year follow-up, 4.1% of older adults reported a new
physician diagnosis of dementia (Supplementary Table S2).
The sensitivity of olfactory dysfunction was 47%; nearly
half of older adults reporting a new physician diagnosis of
dementia had had olfactory dysfunction on testing 5 years
before. Specificity was 79%; more than three-quarters of
older adults without a new dementia diagnosis had had
normal olfactory testing 5 years before. The PPV of olfac-
tory dysfunction in predicting a dementia diagnosis 5 years
later was 9%, and the negative predictive value was 97%.
Thus, older adults with olfactory dysfunction had
more than twice the odds of developing dementia 5 years
later (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.32–3.43), controlling for
age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, comorbidities, and
baseline cognitive function (Table 2).
As expected, better cognitive function at baseline was
associated with lower likelihood of interval dementia diag-
nosis
(OR = 0.73,
95%
CI = 0.61–0.87).
In
addition,
dementia was more likely to develop in older adults
(OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01–1.11), further supporting the
validity of our diagnostic measure. Nonetheless, olfactory
dysfunction had a predictive value in addition to that of
baseline cognition, equivalent to aging 13 years; each addi-
tional odor identification error increased the odds of
dementia independent of all of the covariates (P = .04,
Figure 1).
As a stronger test of the predictive effects of olfaction
independent of baseline cognition, we restricted our analy-
sis to older adults who, at baseline, tested within the nor-
mal cognitive range. In case those with impaired cognition
at
baseline
drove
the
initial
findings,
we
excluded
respondents whose baseline SPMSQ scores were below the
traditional cutoff for likely dementia (<8). The sensitivity
of olfactory dysfunction was similar; 43% of older adults
reporting a new dementia diagnosis had had olfactory dys-
function on testing 5 years before. Furthermore, for older
adults who tested within the normal cognitive range, poor
olfaction continued to strongly predict an interval demen-
tia
diagnosis
(OR = 2.21,
95%
CI = 1.33–3.69,
n = 2,677).
DISCUSSION
We show for the first time that home-dwelling older U.S.
adults with more difficulty identifying odors have greater
odds of receiving a new physician diagnosis of dementia
5 years later (based on respondent or proxy reports). The
strengths of this study include a design that represents the
general U.S. population, demographic diversity, the largest
sample size to date, and control of important covariates.
Specifically, we demonstrate the predictive power of olfac-
tion
in
addition

cognition

 cognitive function as a covariate in the analyses and by
confirming results after excluding individuals with SPMSQ
scores
indicating
high
dementia
risk.
An
additional
strength that gives this study its broad implications is that
olfaction is predictive of dementia even in cognitively
intact older adults, extending prior work with high-risk
populations and smaller, more-homogenous samples.1–7
Why would olfactory dysfunction precede the develop-
ment of dementia? One potential explanation is that the
neuropathology underlying dementia, such as AD (amy-
loid-b plaques and paired helical filament tau tangles),
may begin earlier in the olfactory system than the cor-
tex.19–21 If so, this type of neuropathology in the olfactory
system would impair its function before the detrimental
effects in other parts of the central nervous system, includ-
ing cognition. A postmortem study of brains obtained at
autopsy of older adults who had completed olfactory test-
ing
before
death
(mean � standard
deviation
of
2.2 � 1.2 years before death) found that neuropathologi-
cal findings associated with AD accounted for 12% of the
variation in odor identification ability.22 The association
between olfactory dysfunction and dementia could also
arise from other shared pathological mechanisms to which
the olfactory system is more vulnerable, such as decreased
age-related regenerative capacity, reduced physiological
repair, or worsening immunopathology. Additional studies
will be needed to test and fine-tune these hypotheses.
On a practical basis for clinicians, a validated five-
item odor identification test10,11 can potentially serve as an
efficient, low-cost component of the physical examination
that provides useful information in assessing older adults
at risk of dementia. This tool is a noninvasive biomarker
that provides additional information to other relevant clin-
ical information, established risk factors, and neuropsycho-
logical testing to aid in an earlier diagnosis of dementia.
The ability to identify individuals at risk of dementia
before overt cognitive impairment would allow for earlier
intervention, with the potential to improve outcomes, and
would offer individuals and their families more time to
plan ahead.
In addition to olfactory testing, several biomarkers for
dementia have been proposed, including cerebrospinal fluid
biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-b and tau concentrations), struc-
tural brain imaging (hippocampal volume23), and inflam-
matory molecules.24 We found that our five-item odor
identification test had a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity
79% 5 years in advance of any evidence of cognitive
impairment. These characteristics compare reasonably with
other
proposed
dementia
biomarkers
when
cognitive
decline
is
already
in
process;
for
example,
a
recent
Cochrane Review found that, in individuals with mild cog-
nitive impairment, amyloid-b in cerebrospinal fluid has a
sensitivity of 81% at the median specificity of 64% for
predicting conversion to AD.25 Mild cognitive impairment
is considered to be a precursor to AD, but despite efforts
to identify biomarkers for dementia, none of the candidate
biomarkers have achieved the appropriate screening char-
acteristics to recommend their use in the general popula-
tion.26 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives
screening for cognitive impairment in older adults an “I”
grade, concluding that the current evidence is insufficient
to assess the balance of benefits and harms. More-detailed
study of the additional value of olfactory testing in this
clinical context is warranted.
We found that the PPV of olfactory dysfunction in
predicting a dementia diagnosis within 5 years was 9% in
home-dwelling older Americans, meaning that 91% of
older adults who failed our olfactory test did not develop
dementia within the 5-year follow-up period. The PPV of
a test depends on the prevalence of disease in the popula-
tion studied, indicating that the PPV of olfactory dysfunc-
tion will be greater in at-risk populations. Furthermore, it
is likely that the PPV will improve as the follow-up period
increases, given that risk of dementia increases with age.
Further research is needed to determine the test char-
acteristics of olfactory dysfunction in different populations
and over different follow-up periods. Regardless of test
characteristics,
primary
care
physicians
will
need
to
thoughtfully evaluate when olfactory testing is appropriate
for their individual patients, taking into consideration the
benefits of early dementia risk stratification given the lack
of available therapies and the emotional and financial
harms that can result from misdiagnosis.
Beyond aiding in earlier diagnosis of dementia by
alerting physicians to consider other factors that may
affect disease development, olfactory testing may help dis-
tinguish clinically between different dementia subtypes.
Cross-sectional studies have shown associations between
olfactory dysfunction and vascular dementia and fron-
totemporal dementia.27,28 Prior studies suggest that differ-
ent types of olfactory disability (e.g., odor identification,
odor discrimination, odor threshold) may be associated
with different forms of dementia.28 Finally, olfactory test-
ing may be useful in predicting progression of disease and
response to treatment.29 This remains to be tested in future
work.
Our study has several limitations. As our primary out-
come, we rely on interview reports of physician-diagnosed
dementia, and we are therefore most likely underestimat-
ing the incidence of new dementia cases, although proxy
reports of dementia are reasonably accurate when com-
pared with psychometric testing.14–16 It is likely that psy-
chometric testing would reveal a greater incidence of
dementia were it not infeasible in a time-limited, many-
item, and omnibus nationally representative survey.23 In
addition, although we controlled for many known con-
founders, as in any cohort analysis, there may be addi-
tional confounders associated with olfactory function and
dementia that are unaccounted for in our analyses, such as
smoking and depression.
In summary, older adults with olfactory dysfunction
were twice as likely to develop dementia 5 years later as
those with normal olfaction. Use of simple olfactory test-
ing in the primary care setting may provide an opportunity
for targeted early interventions to reduce the attendant
morbidity and public health burden of dementia.
