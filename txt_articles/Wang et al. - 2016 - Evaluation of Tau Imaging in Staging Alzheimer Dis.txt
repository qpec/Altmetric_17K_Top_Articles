IMPORTANCE In vivo tau imaging may become a diagnostic marker for Alzheimer disease (AD)
and provides insights into the pathophysiology of AD.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the usefulness of [18F]-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging to stage AD and assess the associations among β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and volume loss.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An imaging study conducted at Knight Alzheimer
Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. A total of 59
participants who were cognitively normal (CN) (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score, 0) or
had AD dementia (CDR score, >0) were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [18F]-AV-1451 in
the hippocampus and a priori–defined AD cortical signature regions, cerebrospinal fluid
Aβ42, hippocampal volume, and AD signature cortical thickness.
RESULTS Of the 59 participants, 38 (64%) were male; mean (SD) age was 74 (6) years. The
[18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions distinguished AD
from CN participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range [95% CI],
0.89 [0.73-1.00] to 0.98 [0.92-1.00]). An [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR cutoff value of 1.19 (sensitivity,
100%; specificity, 86%) from AD cortical signature regions best separated cerebrospinal fluid
Aβ42-positive (Aβ+) AD from cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42-negative (Aβ−) CN participants. This
same cutoff also divided Aβ+ CN participants into low vs high tau groups. Moreover, the
presence of Aβ+ was associated with an elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in AD cortical signature
regions (Aβ+ participants: mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]; Aβ− participants: 1.1 [0.1]; F = 4.3, P = .04) but
not in the hippocampus. The presence of Aβ+ alone was not related to hippocampal volume
or AD signature cortical thickness. An elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with
volumetric loss in both the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions. The observed
[18F]-AV-1451 SUVR volumetric association was modified by Aβ status in the hippocampus but
not in AD cortical signature regions. An inverse association between hippocampal
[18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and volume was seen in Aβ+ participants (R2 = 0.55; P < .001) but not
Aβ− (R2 = 0; P = .97) participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of [18F]-AV-1451 has a potential for staging of the
preclinical and clinical phases of AD. β-Amyloid interacts with hippocampal and cortical
tauopathy to affect neurodegeneration. In the absence of Aβ, hippocampal tau deposition
may be insufficient for the neurodegenerative process that leads to AD.

A
ccumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins, the
hallmark pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD), occurs
in a spatially ordered manner.1,2 The spatial spreading
of these pathologic proteins is indicative of the temporal pro-
gression of AD. Deposition of Aβ initially occurs in widely dis-
tributed neocortical areas.3 The presence of widespread Aβ
plaques in these areas marks the beginning of preclinical AD.4
Tau aggregation in the form of neurofibrillary tangles first ap-
pears in the entorhinal cortex.1 The spreading of neurofibril-
lary tangles into the neocortex is associated with the transi-
tion from the preclinical to clinical phase of AD.5
The burden of Aβ in the brain has been measured by
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and positron emission
tomography (PET) amyloid imaging.6,7 Neurodegeneration
has been indexed by CSF tau/phosphorylated tau181 (ptau181)
and brain volumetrics.8 Stage 1 of preclinical AD is denoted
by isolated amyloidosis (decreased CSF Aβ42 or elevated
amyloid tracer binding).9 Stage 2 of preclinical AD is defined
by the presence of both amyloidosis and neurodegeneration
(increased CSF tau/ptau181 or atrophy on magnetic reso-
nance imaging [MRI]).9
Recently developed PET tracers, including [18F]-AV-1451,
bind to aggregated tau in neurofibrillary tangles.10-16 Initial
work17-19 has reported that [18F]-AV-1451 binding is elevated in
neocortical areas in patients with AD compared with cogni-
tively normal (CN) participants. The topography of AD-
relatedcorticalneurodegenerationhasbeendelineatedbyMRI
as the AD cortical signature,20 in which volumetric loss is cor-
related with tau burden measured at autopsy21 or CSF assay.22
Thus,[18F]-AV-1451bindinginADcorticalsignatureregionsmay
be useful for staging of AD.
In addition to potential application to disease staging, tau
imaging may advance our understanding of the pathophysi-
ology of AD.15,23 Emerging evidence suggests that Aβ alone is
necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of AD.15,24-26
Specifically, it is hypothesized25 that Aβ serves as an initiator
of a pathogenic cascade that triggers the spread of neurofi-
brillary tangles and associated neurodegeneration. In addi-
tion, neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in the hippocampus
and adjacent medial temporal cortices with both aging and AD.
Some investigators27 have argued that hippocampal tauopa-
thy is amplified by Aβ during AD; others28-30 have suggested
that hippocampal neurofibrillary tangle accumulation or neu-
rofibrillary tangle–related hippocampal atrophy occurs inde-
pendently of Aβ. The ability to perform in vivo imaging of Aβ
and tauopathy allows us to study whether Aβ intensifies tauo-
pathy and associated neuronal loss within and beyond the me-
dial temporal lobe.
In the present study, we compared [18F]-AV-1451 binding
in the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions with
volumetric measurements (ie, hippocampal volume and AD
signature cortical thickness) and with CSF ptau181 in discrimi-
nating participants with AD from CN participants. We as-
sessed the associations among CSF Aβ42, [18F]-AV-1451 bind-
ing, and volumetric measurements and specifically examined
whether the interaction between CSF Aβ42 and [18F]-AV-1451
binding affected hippocampal volume or AD signature corti-
cal thickness.
Methods
Participants
Participants were community-living volunteers recruited for
longitudinal studies of memory and aging at the Knight Alz-
heimer Disease Research Center at Washington University,
St Louis, Missouri. Recruitment procedures have been
published.31 Participants were eligible for the present study if
they completed both [18F]-AV-1451 PET imaging and brain MRI
within 12 months of clinical assessment. Individuals were ex-
cluded from the present study if they had (1) neurologic, psy-
chiatric, or systemic illness that might affect cognition; (2) an
autosomal dominant mutation for AD; or (3) other neurode-
generativedisorders(eg,frontotemporaldementia).TheWash-
ington University School of Medicine Human Research Pro-
tection Office approved this study, with written informed
consent obtained from each participant. The participants re-
ceived financial compensation.
Clinical Assessment and Disease Stage Classification
The participant and an informant underwent separate semi-
tructuredinterviewsconductedbyexperiencedclinicians.The
presence or absence of cognitive impairment was deter-
mined by assessing whether there was intraparticipant de-
clinefrompreviouslyattainedlevelsofcognitivefunctionusing
the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, with 0 indicating
normal cognition and greater than 0 indicating cognitive
impairment.32 A diagnosis of dementia due to AD was made
according to published criteria.33
Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ42, total tau, and ptau181
were measured in a subset of participants (eMethods in the
Supplement). Using a priori–defined cutoffs, the present co-
hort of participants was classified as either CSF Aβ42 positive
(Aβ+) or CSF Aβ42 negative (Aβ−). The application of CSF Aβ42
cutoffs and clinical diagnosis allowed participants to be clas-
sified as Aβ− CN, Aβ− AD, Aβ+ CN, or Aβ+ AD.

Key Points
Question What is the value of [18F]-AV-1451 positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging in staging of Alzheimer disease and
revealing interactions between β-amyloid and tauopathy?
Findings A PET imaging study using [18F]-AV-1451 distinguished
participants with Alzheimer disease (AD) from those who were
cognitively normal. An elevated [18F]-AV-1451 binding was
associated with volumetric loss in both the hippocampus and
cerebral cortex; however, the observed [18F]-AV-1451
binding–volumetric association was modified by Aβ pathology in
the hippocampus but not in AD cortical signature regions.
Meaning Tau PET imaging has potential for staging of AD; Aβ
interacts with hippocampal and cortical tauopathy to affect
neurodegeneration.

Systems).StructuralscanswereprocessedwithFreeSurfer,ver-
sion5.30(http://freesurfer.net/)(eMethodsintheSupplement).
For each hemisphere, thickness values were obtained from 6
AD signature regions of interest (inset in Figure 1A) based on
previous work.22 Cortical thickness was averaged across
hemispheres and then across the 6 AD signature regions of
interest to generate a single AD signature cortical thickness
mean composite score. In addition, hippocampal volume was
obtained and adjusted for intracranial volume (eMethods in
the Supplement).
[18F]-AV-1451 PET Imaging and Processing
Imaging was performed using a Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner
(Siemens Medical Solutions). PET scans were acquired after in-
travenousadministrationofapproximately 9to13mCiof[18F]-
AV-1451.ReconstructionwasperformedusinganordinaryPois-
son-ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm
(256 × 256 × 109 matrix, 1.34 × 1.34 × 2.03-mm voxels on the
Biograph 40 scanner) with random, scatter, attenuation, and
decay correction. Dynamic PET images were corrected for in-
terframe motion using in-house software.34 PET imaging data
acquired between 80 and 100 minutes after injection of [18F]-
AV-1451 were summed and registered to the participant’
s MRI
space. Voxelwise standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was
estimatedbynormalizingthesummedPETimagesbythemean
cerebellar cortex intensity. Voxelwise SUVR was not cor-
rected for partial volume effect. The SUVR values from AD cor-
tical signature composite regions and the hippocampus were
obtained using a method similar to the one described above
for volumetric measurements. Additional processing for ver-
texwise analysis is provided in the eMethods in the Supple-
ment. In addition, [18F]-AV-1451 has been shown18 to bind to
the target other than tau (ie, off-target binding) in the cho-
roid plexus that might confound the hippocampal PET sig-
nal. We used partial volume correction35 and linear regres-
sion approaches to address this confounding effect (eMethods,
eResults, eTable 1, and eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

Overall,theAβ−ADgroupwasexcludedfromsubsequentcom-
parisons because of limited sample size (n = 1). Receiver op-
erating characteristic analyses assessed the ability of hippo-
campal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR or volume, AD cortical signature
[18F]-AV-1451 SUVR or thickness, and CSF ptau181 to distin-
guish the Aβ+ AD from the Aβ− CN or Aβ+ CN groups. The cut-
off for each measurement that best discriminated these groups
was selected using the Youden index (ie, a maximum of sen-
sitivity + [specificity − 1]). With regard to differentiating Aβ+
AD from Aβ− CN or from Aβ+ CN, the AUCs were compared be-
tween possible measurement pairs (eg, hippocampal [18F]-AV-
1451 SUVR vs volume) using a bootstrap test implemented in
R, version 3.2.3.36

Pearson correlation between [18F]-AV-1451 binding and cortical thickness was
assessed for each region of interest that composed the Alzheimer disease (AD)
cortical signature (A) and each vertex across the cortical mantle (B). The
regional correlation coefficients are showed with a bar graph in an order that is
consistent with the hypothetical sequence of neurofibrillary tangles spreading.
The color-coded anatomic location of AD cortical signature regions is labeled in
the bar graph accordingly. The significance of vertexwise correlation was
thresholded at P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level.
Both AD cortical signature regions and vertexwise correlation are displayed on
the semi-inflated cortical surface of the FreeSurfer average brain, with light gray
regions representing gyri and dark gray regions representing sulci.

Aβ+ AD group and did not overlap with that of Aβ− CN par-

a The AUC analysis evaluated the accuracy of hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 binding
(SUVR), hippocampal volume, AD cortical signature [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and
thickness, and CSF ptau181 in differentiating the Aβ+ AD from the Aβ− CN
group or from the Aβ+ CN group. The Aβ level was measured by a CSF fluid
assay of Aβ42. Cutoffs for Aβ status (ie, CSF Aβ+ vs Aβ−) were determined in
an independent cohort.
bThe cutoff is the value of the corresponding variable that provided best
separation of the groups. For example, 1.36 indicates that the hippocampal
SUVR of 1. 36 best separated Aβ− CN from Aβ+ AD.

corticalthicknesswasnotonlysignificantforeachregionbutwas
present in a particular order. Specifically, the magnitude of ob-
served correlation decreased in the following order: the medial
temporal,inferiortemporal,lateraltemporalorinferiorparietal
lobule, posterior medial parietal, and superior parietal lobule
(Figure 1).
We assessed the interactive effect of Aβ status and [F-18]-
AV-1451SUVRonvolumetricmeasurements.Aninteractionbe-
tween Aβ status and the hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR was
observed for the hippocampal volume. Within Aβ+ partici-
pants,thehippocampal[18F]-AV-1451SUVRwasnegativelycor-
relatedwiththehippocampalvolume(R2 = 0.55;P < .001).The
hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR explained 31% of the vari-
ance in the hippocampal volume after accounting for age and
CDR status (P = .02). Within Aβ− participants, no association
was observed between hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and
volume (R2 = 0; P = .97).
An interactive effect was not observed between Aβ status
and AD cortical signature [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR for AD signa-
ture cortical thickness. The [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in AD cortical
signature regions explained 18% of the variance in AD corti-
cal signature thickness after accounting for age and CDR sta-
tus (P = .007). In addition, no interactive effects were seen be-
tween Aβ status and regional [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR for each of
the regions of interest that composed the AD cortical signa-
ture. Across the 6 AD cortical signature regions, [18F]-AV-1451
SUVR explained different proportions of the variance in thick-
ness after accounting for age and CDR status. In particular,
across the 6 AD cortical signature regions of interest, the vari-
ance in thickness explained by [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR exhibited
a similar descending order as seen in Figure 1A.
In addition, to ensure that the topography of the AD corti-
calsignatureadequatelyrepresentedtheprimaryareasthatdem-
onstrate an association between [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and corti-
cal thickness, we performed a vertex analysis for the entire
cortical mantle. We found that an increase in the [18F]-AV-1451
SUVRwasassociatedwithreducedcorticalthicknessintheme-
dialtemporal,inferiortemporal,lateraltemporal,andmedialand
lateral parietal areas (Figure 1B). Our vertexwise analysis sug-
gested that [18F]-AV-1451–related cortical thinning was topo-
graphically similar to AD cortical signature regions.
Discussion
Binding of [18F]-AV-1451 in the hippocampus and AD cortical
signature regions accurately distinguished AD from CN par-
ticipants. This finding is consistent with other neuropatho-
logic studies suggesting that tau burden is closely correlated
with disease progression.5 Moreover, the receiver operating
characteristic–derived cutoff (ie, AD signature [18F]-AV-1451
SUVR, 1.19) and the gaussian mixture model classified Aβ+ CN
participantsintolowvshightaugroups.Theclassificationusing
the [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR is consistent with the neuropatho-
logic description of preclinical AD, in which antemortem CN
cases have been shown4 to have neocortical accumulation of
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that is similar to very mild
AD. Longitudinal studies are required for prognosis of this clas-
sification and comparison with stage 2 of preclinical AD de-
fined by CSF tau, volumetric MRI, or fluorodeoxyglucose PET.
Sequential changes in neurodegenerative markers occur
with AD progression.24,37 Specifically, CSF tau (ptau as well)
becomes abnormal before volumetric MRI in preclinical AD37
(but see other reports20,38). Volumetric MRI has been
shown24,37 to be more dynamic than CSF tau/ptau across clini-
cal AD. We assessed cross-sectional changes in CSF ptau181,
volumetrics, and [18F]-AV-1451 with increasing stages of AD.
Consistent with the reported sequence,24,37 changes in CSF
ptau181 and volumetic MRI were primarily seen with the pres-
ence of preclinical and clinical AD, respectively. More impor-
tant, [18F]-AV-1451 binding from AD cortical signature regions
was elevated in both the preclinical and clinical stages of AD.
Therefore, [18F]-AV-1451 may detect a wider range of AD neu-
rodegeneration than CSF tau or volumetric MRI.
Neurofibrillary tangles are commonly detected in the hip-
pocampus and adjacent medial temporal cortices at autopsy in
elderly participants (>60 years).4,39,40 Consistent with this
observation,4,39,40wefoundthathippocampal[18F]-AV-1451lev-
elsweresimilarbetweenAβ+andAβ−participants.However,Aβ
status had a dramatic effect on the association between hippo-
campalneurofibrillarytanglesandvolume.IntheabsenceofAβ,
no association was seen between hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451
binding and volume. Given that hippocampal volume is a well-
validatedmeasureforADneurodegeneration,41 thisresultsup-
portsaview27that,intheabsenceofAβ,age-relatedhippocam-
pal tauopathy may be insufficient for the neurodegenerative
processthatleadstoAD.However,thepresenceofAβwasasso-
ciated with a strong inverse association between hippocampal
tauopathyandvolume.Thisresultsuggestsanintriguinghypoth-
esis in which Aβ transforms age-related hippocampal tau to a
moretoxicspeciesthatdamagesneuronsandsynapses.Further
work exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying this
result is needed.
Consistent with recent work,17 we observed that cortical
[18F]-AV-1451 binding, measured from AD cortical signature re-
gions, was elevated with the presence of Aβ. Furthermore, we
found that elevated [18F]-AV-1451 binding was associated with
corticalthinninginADcorticalsignatureregions.However,Aβ+
status had no effect on AD signature cortical thickness or the
association between AD signature cortical thickness and [18F]-
AV-1451 binding. These results collectively support the hy-
pothesisthatAβactsasaninitiatorinapathogeniccascadethat
triggers the spread of tauopathy into the neocortex, which in
turn leads to cortical neurodegeneration.25 In addition, across
AD cortical signature regions, the degree to which [18F]-AV-
1451 binding was related to cortical thinning that tracked the
same topographic order of neurofibrillary tangle spread seen
at autopsy.1 This result may provide in vivo evidence that tau-
related neurodegeneration evolves in a spatially ordered fash-
ion. The biology underlying the spread of tauopathy remains
unclear. Experimental evidence suggests that tau proteins
transfer between neurons via synaptic connection.42 Further
studies are needed to understand where and how Aβ facili-
tates the transsynaptic transfer of misfolded tau proteins.

Conclusions
Overall, our work suggests that [18F]-AV-1451 is a valuable tool
in tracking the continuum of the neurodegenerative process
that ranges from the preclinical to clinical phase of AD. In par-
ticular, [18F]-AV-1451 binding sampled from AD cortical signa-
tureregionsmayofferapathologicallyplausiblemeanstostage
preclinical AD. Our work also suggests that interactions be-
tween Aβ and tau are the key for neurodegeneration due to AD.
In the hippocampus, Aβ likely transforms preexisting tauo-
pathy to a more toxic species that results in neuronal injury.
In the cerebral cortex, Aβ may intensify the spread of tauopa-
thy, which in turn leads to neuronal loss that follows a topog-
raphy that is similar to the observed spread of neurofibrillary
tanglesatautopsy.IntheabsenceofAβ,tauopathymaybecon-
fined to the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal cor-
tices and is insufficient for hippocampal degeneration that
leads to AD.
