Abstract
Background: Emerging evidence suggests that the in utero environment is not sterile as once presumed. Work in
the mouse demonstrated transmission of commensal bacteria from mother to fetus during gestation, though it is
unclear what modulates this process. We have previously shown in the nonhuman primate that, independent of
obesity, a maternal high-fat diet during gestation and lactation persistently shapes the juvenile gut microbiome. We
therefore sought to interrogate in a population-based human longitudinal cohort whether a maternal high-fat diet
similarly alters the neonatal and infant gut microbiome in early life.
Methods: A representative cohort was prospectively enrolled either in the early third trimester or intrapartum
(n = 163), with a subset consented to longitudinal sampling through the postpartum interval (n = 81). Multiple
body site samples, including stool and meconium, were collected from neonates at delivery and by 6 weeks of
age. A rapid dietary questionnaire was administered to estimate intake of fat, added sugars, and fiber over the
past month (National Health and Examination Survey). DNA was extracted from each infant meconium/stool
sample (MoBio) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis.
Results: On average, the maternal dietary intake of fat ranged from 14.0 to 55.2 %, with an average intake of 33.
1 % (σ = 6.1 %). Mothers whose diets significantly differed from the mean (±1 standard deviation) were separated
into two distinct groups, a control group (n = 13, μ = 24.4 %) and a high-fat group (n = 13, μ = 43.1 %). Principal
coordinate analysis revealed that the microbiome of the neonatal stool at birth (meconium) clustered differently
by virtue of maternal gestational diet (PERMANOVA p = 0.001). LEfSe feature selection identified several taxa that
discriminated the groups, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in the neonates exposed to a maternal
high-fat gestational diet (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05) that persisted to 6 weeks of age.
Conclusions: Similar to the primate, independent of maternal body mass index, a maternal high-fat diet is
associated with distinct changes in the neonatal gut microbiome at birth which persist through 4–6 weeks of
age. Our findings underscore the importance of counseling pregnant mothers on macronutrient consumption
during pregnancy and lactation.

 Background
The human microbiome encompasses a rich ecosystem
of approximately 90 trillion microbes that aid in human
metabolism and impact host physiology [1, 2]. Next-
generation sequencing technologies have allowed for
more detailed characterization of the microbiome with-
out the biases of culture-based techniques, enabling ro-
bust analyses linking microbiota to human disease [3].
To date, microbiota have been associated with obesity,
inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disease, and,
more recently, neurological disease related to the gut–
brain axis [4–7]. Indeed, the interactions between a
host and its microbiota are critical for proper develop-
mental processes, but how host–microbe symbiosis is
established and maintained across the lifespan remains
underexplored.
Following gestation and birth, continued acquisition of
a nascent microbiome in infancy is a relatively dynamic
process thought to be primarily shaped by breastfeeding
practices and weaning to solid food [8, 9]. Contrary to
the long-held presumption that the in utero environ-
ment is sterile, emerging evidence has shown microbiota
present in the placenta and amniotic fluid of healthy,
term pregnancies devoid of clinical evidence of infection
[10–14]. Moreover, in a murine model, orally adminis-
tered bacteria have been cultured from the meconium of
pups delivered by sterile cesarean, indicating that mother
to fetus transmission of bacteria may occur during
gestation [15]. Collectively, these findings suggest that
colonization of the infant gut is likely to occur prior to
parturition. Additional studies in well-controlled animal
models are required to further characterize the mechanism
of transmission.
Here, we sought to utilize a population-based, large,
longitudinally sampled cohort of mother–infant dyads
to interrogate the maternal factors that modulate micro-
bial transmission of microbes in the peripartum period. In
the adult, diet is a prominent modifier of the microbiome
by providing selective metabolic pressures against or for
specific microbes through substrate availability [16]. In
a similar manner, we recently demonstrated in a non-
human primate model that, independent of obesity, a
maternal high-fat diet throughout gestation and lactation
altered the composition of the offspring microbiome,
which persisted up to one year of age regardless of the
infant’s post-weaning diet [17]. These findings indicate
that maternal diet in gestation, particularly fat intake
and caloric density, may have a longstanding impact on
the establishment and development of the infant micro-
biome. In the current study, we sought to determine if
the effect of a maternal high-fat diet in gestation and
lactation on the early infant microbiome could be
recapitulated in a population-based prospective human
cohort study.
Methods
Study design
The cohort data used in this study were part of a larger,
population-based, prospective study that sought to
characterize the origin and development of the neonatal
microbiome across multiple body sites (skin, stool, oral
cavity, nares). An initial cohort of 81 maternal–neonate
dyads was prospectively enrolled in the third trimester
from the clinical population at large. Power calculations
based on the Dirilecht-multinomial distribution were
done prior to subject enrollment with the anticipation
of detecting a small effect size (ϕ = 0.07, α = 0.05) based
on anticipated read counts (10,000 per sample) [18].
Mothers and infants were sampled at the time of deliv-
ery and at a follow-up visit 4–6 weeks later. Samples
were collected across multiple body sites, representing
the microbiome as a whole (stool, oral gingiva, nares,
auricular and antecubital fossa skin, vaginal introitus,
and posterior fornix). To increase the power of detect-
ing a difference in the neonatal microbiome at delivery,
a second, matched cross-sectional cohort (n = 82) was
enrolled for sampling only at the time of delivery. Two
mothers withdrew from the study and four delivered
elsewhere and thus were excluded from the cohort.
Detailed demographics of the two cohorts are provided
in Additional file 1: Table S1. All subjects were en-
rolled and consented under Baylor College of Medicine
Institutional Review Board H-27393. Enrollment cri-
teria included gravidae 18 years or older with a viable
pregnancy >28 weeks gestation. Subjects were excluded if
there was known HIV or hepatitis C infection, im-
munosuppressive disease, use of cytokines or immuno-
suppressive agents within the past 6 months, a history
of cancer except squamous or basal cell carcinoma of
the skin managed by local excision, treatment of or
suspicion of ever having had toxic shock syndrome, or
major surgery of the gastrointestinal tract except chole-
cystectomy or appendectomy in the past 5 years.
Maternal dietary estimation
To determine maternal dietary intake during preg-
nancy, each mother was asked by trained personnel at
each sample collection time point to answer the Dietary
Screener Questionnaire (DSQ), which was developed
and validated by the National Health and Examination
Survey (NHANES) program (2009–2010) [19, 20]. The
DSQ is a rapid 26-question dietary screener that can be
completed in a single visit and asks the respondent to
provide the frequency of consumption of common
foods. A copy of the DSQ is provided in Additional file
2. NHANES-provided scoring spreadsheets were used
to convert frequency responses to daily intake estimates
based on median portion sizes for reproductive-aged

 women (Additional file 3). A comparison of the dietary
intake captured between the cohorts is shown in Additional
file 1: Table S2 and the consistency of responses be-
tween time points from the same individual is given in
Additional file 1: Table S3. To best recapitulate our
non-human primate study, respondents reporting a
dietary fat intake in the cohort extremes (±1 standard
deviation from the cohort μ of 33.1 %) were divided
into separate groups of identical sample size, representing
a maternal gestational high-fat group (n = 13, μ = 43.1 %)
and a control diet group (n = 13, μ = 24.4 %), which was
used as reference for the high-fat cases (Additional file 4:
Figure S1). Gestational weight gain was determined as
previously described by comparing the weight gained in
pregnancy for a given gestational age and pre-pregnancy
body mass index (BMI) [21].
Sample collection and processing
Neonatal meconium was obtained from the first diaper
within 24–48 h of delivery. A second stool sample was col-
lected from infants who were followed up at 4–6 weeks of
age. Specimens were uniformly clean sterile collected by
trained personnel according to a standardized protocol as
previously described [3]. In a decontaminated, sterile en-
vironment, genomic DNA was isolated from each speci-
men using the MOBIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit with
the standard protocol. Extracted DNA was prepared for
sequencing according to the HMP consortium outlined
protocol [1] and subjected to 16S rRNA gene pyrose-
quencing using the V3-V5 primer set on the 454-FLX Ti-
tanium platform. Sequencing data were filtered, denoised,
and processed on the QIIME platform (v1.9) [17]. Default
parameters were used in picking operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) to build the OTU table. A total of 2,690,000
high-quality reads were retained and mapped to 7838
unique OTUs.
Statistical analysis
The significance of comparisons between continuous
distributions was determined by an appropriate paramet-
ric or non-parametric test where appropriate. Measure-
ments of beta-diversity were determined using principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) using unweighted UniFrac dis-
tances [22]. The significance of clustering was determined
by PERMANOVA with 999 permutations. Heatmaps were
generated in R using the pheatmap package. Hierarchical
clustering was performed on Euclidean distances using
complete linkage. Linear regression analysis and plotting
were performed in PRISM. Linear effect size (LEfSe)
analysis was performed using the default parameters to
identify features that discriminated our dietary groups of
interest [23].
Results
Study cohort and demographics
To interrogate the impact of maternal gestational diet on
the neonatal gut microbiome, we examined stool samples
collected from neonates enrolled in a larger, prospective,
population-based study that sought to characterize the
early neonatal microbiome across multiple body sites (gut,
skin, oral cavity, nares). Mother–infant dyads (n = 157)
were sampled at the time of delivery, with a subset (n =
75) consented for longitudinal sampling at 4–6 weeks
postpartum. As shown in Additional file 1: Table S1, the
cohort was comprised of primarily Hispanic women
(85.4 %), who delivered singleton pregnancies (95.5 %) at
term (38.4 weeks). The rate of cesarean deliveries (33.8 %)
and preterm birth (10.8 %) were similar to the US national
incidence and were not enriched for [24, 25]. For the pur-
poses of this study, we focused our efforts on only the
neonatal stool samples collected at the time of delivery
(first meconium) and at 4–6 weeks of age. All samples
were subjected to standard 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and analysis.
Assessment of maternal diet in pregnancy
In order to accurately assess maternal dietary intake
during pregnancy, we employed the Dietary Screener
Questionnaire (DSQ), which is a rapid dietary screener
developed and validated by the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program [19,
20]. The DSQ is comprised of 26 questions that ask for
the frequency of consumption in the past month of rep-
resentative food and beverages. Based on the recorded
responses, estimates of daily dietary intake of added
sugars, fat, and fiber over the past month were deter-
mined, which, in our cohort, represented the maternal
diet during the latter part of the third trimester.
Comparisons between the captured dietary intake data
from the study cohort, the average intake of reproductive-
age women in the US, and the recommended daily
dietary intake are shown in Table 1. In aggregate, the
cohort’s average consumption of added sugars (59.6 ± 42 g)
and total intake of fat (33.1 ± 6.1 %) was at or above the
Institute of Medicine’s recommended limit, which is largely
reflective of the poor quality diet in America. Notably,
the average intake of added sugars in our study cohort
was significantly less than the reported national average
(59.6 ± 42 g versus 68.8 g, p = 0.01). However, this dif-
ference is likely explained by the fact that pregnant
women who develop gestational diabetes are placed on
a diabetic diet that limits carbohydrate intake; we had a
significant proportion of gestational diabetics (30 %) in
our study cohort [26]. As expected, women with gesta-
tional diabetes consumed significantly less added sugars
(p < 0.001) but not fiber or fat (Fig. 1a). To further evalu-
ate if the captured dietary intake values were consistent
Chu et al. Genome Medicine  (2016) 8:77 
Page 3 of 12
 with clinical expectations, we similarly examined if
dietary intake correlated with gestational weight gain.
Although identifiable risk factors for gestational weight
gain are widely variable between studies and thus
poorly understood, previous studies have shown no as-
sociation between dietary composition and gestational
weight gain [27, 28]. Consistent with the literature, in-
take of added sugars, fiber, and fat did not significantly
differ with gestational weight gain subject strata (Fig. 1b).
In sum, the dietary intake data captured by the DSQ were
similar to the average for reproductive-aged women in the
US and generally consistent with clinical expectations.
Impact of maternal fat intake during gestation on the
neonatal microbiome
We previously demonstrated in a non-human primate
model that, when compared with a control maternal diet
(13 % fat), exposure to a maternal high-fat diet (36 %
fat) during gestation and lactation persistently altered
the offspring microbiome until up to one year of age
[17]. To determine if this persistent effect of a maternal
high-fat diet could be recapitulated in a human cohort,
we modeled the conditions of our primate study by sub-
dividing the study cohort into its extremes, defined as
being one standard deviation greater or less than the co-
hort mean. Using this criterion, a high-fat maternal diet
group (n = 13, 43.1 % fat intake) and maternal low-fat
diet group (n = 13, 24.4 % fat intake) were identified for
further analysis (Additional file 4: Figure S1). Notably,
the average percentage dietary fat intake of the low-fat
group fell within the recommended fat intake for the
general population as indicated by the Institute of
Medicine [29]; thus, for this analysis we considered this
group as the control reference for the high-fat diet
group comparisons and will refer to it as the “control
group” from here on. As shown in Table 2, the percent-
age intake of fat significantly differed between the
groups as expected (p < 0.001), while the intake of
added sugar and fiber was not significantly different.
Other potential confounders, such as pre-pregnancy BMI
and mode of delivery, also did not significantly differ be-
tween the groups (all p > 0.05), though given the nested
case-control design of this study, we may be underpowered
to detect differences by these comparisons.
To characterize and quantify the neonatal gut micro-
biome at the time of delivery, DNA from meconium
samples was subjected to culture-independent 16S rRNA
gene sequencing and analysis. With this approach, we
identified 103 unique taxa classified down to at least
the genus level that were represented in more than
10 % of all samples. To examine how maternal gesta-
tional diet correlated with the neonatal microbiome as
a whole, we first projected the data as a heatmap, with
each row representing the relative abundance of each
taxa. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering on Euclidean
distances revealed that a maternal high-fat diet in gesta-
tion varied in association with the neonatal microbiome
(Fig. 2a). To further corroborate these findings, we next
projected the data by principal coordinate analysis
(PCoA) on unweighted UniFrac distances to reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset to its components of great-
est variation (principal coordinate (PC) axes 1 and 2). The

 neonatal microbiome again clustered significantly by
virtue of maternal gestational diet (Fig. 2b; p = 0.04),
which was best explained along the second PC axis
(Fig. 2b, c). Notably, the variation of the neonatal
microbiome along the second PC axis associated with
maternal fat intake was not explained by maternal in-
take of fiber or added sugar (Fig. 3a; p > 0.05), nor was
it confounded by other possible modifiers of the micro-
biome, including pre-pregnancy BMI, antibiotic usage,
mode of delivery, gestational diabetes, or gestational
weight gain (Fig. 3a, b; all p > 0.05).
We next employed linear effect size (LEfSe) feature
selection [23] to identify the specific taxa in the neo-
natal microbiome that were significantly associated
with either a maternal high-fat or control diet. Seven
taxa were identified as significant and are shown in
Fig. 4 as a heatmap indicating the relative abundance of
each taxa in each neonatal meconium sample. Hierarch-
ical clustering of the taxa indicated by the dendrogram
along the vertical axis demonstrates the specific signature
associated with either dietary group. Notably, exposure to
a maternal high-fat diet was significantly associated with
an enrichment of Enterococcus and a relative depletion of
Bacteroides, which is a known symbiont that aids in the
maturation of mucosal immunity (Fig. 4) [30–32].
We next sought to determine if these changes in the
neonatal gut microbiome associated with maternal gesta-
tional diet persisted beyond delivery. Similar to previous
observations [8, 33], comparisons of the neonatal gut
microbiome at delivery and at 6 weeks demonstrated
significant differences at the phylum and OTU levels
(Additional file 4: Figure S2), indicating broad rearrange-
ments of the gut microbiome during this time period.
When examining only the infant stool at 6 weeks,
unsupervised hierarchical clustering again demonstrated
significant clustering by maternal gestational diet (Fig. 5a),
while clustering by unweighted PCoA trended toward
significance (Additional file 4: Figure S3a; PERMANOVA
p = 0.059). LEfSE analysis on the 6-week stool samples
identified four taxa that were significantly associated with
either the maternal high-fat or control diet group, though
only Bacteroides was found to be significantly different at
both delivery and 6 weeks (Additional file 4: Figure S3b).
As in the neonatal meconium, the relative abundance
of Bacteroides in the infant stool at 6 weeks of age was
inversely correlated with the maternal fat intake during
pregnancy (Fig. 5b; p = 0.02). Although the relative
abundance of Enterococcus appeared subjectively higher
in the infant stool exposed to a maternal high-fat diet
in pregnancy, the correlation was not significant (Fig. 5c;
p = 0.20). In addition, none of the other identified taxa at
the time of delivery significantly correlated with maternal
dietary intake (Additional file 4: Figure S4a; all p > 0.05).
Breastfeeding practices have been shown to differentially
impact the infant gut microbiome, with the greatest differ-
ences seen between those exclusively breast-fed or exclu-
sively formula fed [33]. In our cohort, all infants received
both breast milk and formula by the time they were sam-
pled at 6 weeks of age, except for two in the high-fat diet
group who were exclusively formula fed. When these two
subjects were excluded from analysis, we still observed a
significant correlation between the relative abundance of
Bacteroides and maternal dietary fat intake during gesta-
tion (Additional file 4: Figure S4b; p = 0.04). Altogether,
these findings indicate that a maternal high-fat gestational
diet is significantly associated with specific alterations to
the neonatal and infant gut microbiome, some of which
persist to at least 6 weeks of age.
Discussion
In this population-based prospective cohort study, we
demonstrated that administration of a validated rapid
dietary screener questionnaire adequately captured ma-
ternal dietary intake in the third trimester of pregnancy
that was consistent with the US population and generally
consistent with clinical expectations. Examination of the
neonatal gut microbiome immediately after delivery re-
vealed that it varied by virtue of maternal gestational
diet, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in

 the neonatal meconium exposed to a high-fat diet dur-
ing gestation. At 6 weeks of age, the infant gut micro-
biome continued to vary by maternal gestational diet,
with Bacteroides persistently depleted in infants exposed
to a maternal high-fat diet in pregnancy.
In sum, the results from this study are in agreement
with our previous published work in our non-human
primate model [17]. In both cases, a maternal high-fat
diet in gestation was associated with persistent and
specific alterations in the offspring microbiome, though
different taxa were shown to be altered in each case.
Long standing exposure to a high-fat diet in the human
population likely accounts for the differences seen be-
tween these studies. It is hypothesized that increased con-
sumption of animal products over time has persistently
altered the spectrum of commensal species native to the
human gastrointestinal tract, which has been further indi-
cated by the isolation of large amounts of Helicobacter
pylori in the gut microbiome of a closer ancestral relative,
Ötzi the Iceman [34, 35]. Therefore, perturbation of the
human gut microbiome with a diet higher in fat may pro-
vide further selection pressures against commensal species
like Bacteroides.
Persistent reduction of Bacteroides species in the
infant gut could have significant consequences for effi-
cient energy extraction and early immune development.
Bacteroides species are major catabolizers of complex
polysaccharides, including human milk oligosaccharides,
which may be otherwise unusable by the host and other
microbes [36, 37]. Fermentation of these polysaccharides
into short chain fatty acids provides a major energy source
for the host and is likely vitally important for the rapidly
growing infant [36]. Additionally, polysaccharides gener-
ated by Bacteroides species promote healthy gut mucosal
immunity by stimulating CD4 expansion and the produc-
tion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [30–32, 38].
Many of these studies are based on the impact of one par-
ticular species, Bacteroides fragilis, which, although
variably present in the neonatal gut in early life [39],
has been shown to be transmitted from the maternal
gut [40] and often is the dominant member of this im-
portant genus when present [41]. The resultant impact
of maternal gestational diet on host immune develop-
ment has been previously explored in murine and
zebrafish models [42–44]. Interestingly, high-fat diet
exposure during gestation and lactation had profound
effects on offspring immunity and tolerance to inflam-
matory stimuli.
The relative depletion of Bacteroides species in this
early time period may also influence an infant’s risk of
developing obesity later on in life, but because the lit-
erature to date is limited, it is uncertain whether such
an effect would be protective or contributory. Early
studies observed that obesity in adults is associated
with reduced levels of the phylum Bacteroidetes, which
includes Bacteroides species [2, 45]; however, several
more recent studies have seen opposite correlations
whereby Bacteroides level are instead higher in over-
weight or obese subjects [46, 47]. The literature on the
microbiota in overweight children is similarly limited
and unclear, though several studies have observed in-
creased B. fragilis in children with higher BMIs [48,
49]. The varied observations of previous studies likely
reflects the number of confounding factors that are as-
sociated with obesity, including mode of delivery and
diet, which may be difficult to control for and may alter
data interpretations. For instance, obesity is an independ-
ent risk factor for cesarean delivery [50], which has been
associated with delayed Bacteroides colonization in early
life [33]. Additionally, obesity is a product of dietary in-
take, which can independently influence the abundance
of Bacteroides [16]. Therefore, while the literature to

 date points to a potential role for Bacteroides species in
modulating weight development in infants, additional
well-controlled studies are needed to demonstrate caus-
ality rather than just correlation. Nevertheless, our re-
ported data from the current study, as well as our prior
analysis in a non-human primate model, renders the
possibility that macronutrient intake may be equally
important to the structure of the early neonatal micro-
biome, collectively underscoring the importance of mater-
nal diet in pregnancy in shaping the health and well-being
of the offspring.
The mechanism through which maternal gestational
diet alters the offspring microbiome remains unclear.
Alterations to the maternal microbiome associated with
diet are thought to impact the bacterial transmission to
the neonate, but when this occurs and which body sites
matter most are uncertain. Identification of differences
in the microbiome of the neonate’s first meconium in-
dicates that the effect of maternal gestational diet may
extend into the gestational interval and well before par-
turition occurs. The composition of the meconium is
thought to originate from the large amounts of amni-
otic fluid swallowed by the infant and is thus thought
to reflect the in utero environment [11]. Although it was
presumed that the neonate was born sterile, an emerging
body of work has begun to challenge this fundamental as-
sumption. Recently, we characterized the placental micro-
biome using deep sequencing technologies, demonstrating
that it appears most similar to the oral microbiome
[21, 51]. Furthermore, Jiménez et al. [15] demonstrated
that orally administered bacteria could be transferred
from the pregnant dam to the fetal gut before delivery
occurred. Findings from Callado and colleagues further
show in a cohort of neonates delivered by elective
cesarean section that the placenta, amniotic fluid, and
neonatal meconium share many similar taxonomic fea-
tures, suggesting microbial transfer in utero [13]. For
these reasons, we speculate that a high-fat diet during
gestation may impact the composition of the maternal
oral or gut microbiome, thereby indirectly affecting the
placental microbiome and subsequent seeding of the
fetus. However, further well-controlled animal studies
are needed to interrogate these potential mechanisms
further.
Maternal diet in the postpartum period was not ex-
plored in this study but is nevertheless an important
consideration. Human breast milk contains a low-biomass
microbiome that has been previously hypothesized to be
partially derived from the maternal gut [52–54]. If this is
indeed the case, continued maternal consumption of a
high-fat diet in the postpartum period could potentially
impact the breast milk microbiome, further exacerbating
dysbioses seen in the early gut microbiome if the infant is
breastfed. Although previous studies have demonstrated
that the macronutrient composition (e.g., fatty acids) of
human milk is, to a certain degree, influenced by maternal
diet, how diet impacts the microbial composition of
human milk is unknown. Given the overall importance
of breast milk to infant health and its potential role in
microbial transmission, further studies are warranted to
address these knowledge gaps.
The results of this study may be limited by the inher-
ent limitations of using a rapid dietary screener. In
exchange for a shorter questionnaire that could be rea-
sonably completed in a single clinic visit (inclusive of
the potential need for an interpreter), total caloric
intake cannot be assessed and overall reliability of the
screener is less than that of a more extensive question-
naire. However, the strength of this study, namely the
large prospective population-based cohort design, en-
sured that a wide range of dietary intakes was captured
such that the extremes of the population could be sub-
sequently compared. Furthermore, particular attention
was given to control for maternal obesity and gesta-
tional weight gain (Table 2, Fig. 3). In a landmark study
by Turnbaugh et al. [7], body habitus was shown to be
transferrable through the gut microbiome, implicating a
potential microbiome of obesity. Work by Galley et al.
[55], Collado et al. [56], and Mueller et al. [57] further
demonstrated that maternal obesity as measured by
pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with differences in
the early infant gut microbiome. However, in these studies
by others, maternal dietary intake of fat was not accounted
for and likely represents a potential confounding factor.
Therefore, in contrast with this viewpoint, our prior
[17, 21] data along other’s published work further sup-
port the notion that diet, independent of obesity, has a
role shaping the offspring microbiome [16, 34].
Conclusions
We show that a maternal high-fat diet during gestation
is independently associated with significant changes in
the early neonatal microbiome that persist by 6 weeks
of age. These findings have direct implications for refining
dietary recommendations in pregnancy. Although clear
guidelines have been established for total caloric and
micronutrient intake, the recommendations for macro-
nutrients (processed sugars, fats, fibers, and carbohy-
drates) are less clear in the absence of either pre-exiting
or gestational diabetes [26, 58]. Our data show that signifi-
cantly increased (>1 standard deviation) dietary intake
of fat above the limit recommended by the Institute of
Medicine (>35 %) has a lasting impact on the offspring
microbiome [29]. Although obesity and gestational weight
gain may be difficult for patients to address in the short
term, establishing healthy dietary habits in pregnancy
may be more readily achievable with significant long-
term benefits for both mothers and their children.
