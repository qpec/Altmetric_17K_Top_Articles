The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are
aggravated by incorrect prescription and use of antibiotics. A core
problem is that there is no sufficiently fast diagnostic test to guide
correct antibiotic prescription at the point of care. Here, we inves-
tigate if it is possible to develop a point-of-care susceptibility test for
urinary tract infection, a disease that 100 million women suffer from
annually and that exhibits widespread antibiotic resistance. We
capture bacterial cells directly from samples with low bacterial
counts (104 cfu/mL) using a custom-designed microfluidic chip and
monitor their individual growth rates using microscopy. By averag-
ing the growth rate response to an antibiotic over many individual
cells, we can push the detection time to the biological response time
of the bacteria. We find that it is possible to detect changes in
growth rate in response to each of nine antibiotics that are used
to treat urinary tract infections in minutes. In a test of 49 clinical
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates, all were correctly
classified as susceptible or resistant to ciprofloxacin in less than
10 min. The total time for antibiotic susceptibility testing, from load-
ing of sample to diagnostic readout, is less than 30 min, which
allows the development of a point-of-care test that can guide cor-
rect treatment of urinary tract infection.

W
ith the ever-increasing emergence and spread of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria, a key factor in correct treatment of in-
fections is the ability to rapidly identify the antibiotic susceptibility
profile of the infecting species to assure the use of an efficacious
antibiotic and reduce the need for broad spectrum drugs (1–3).
Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) are typically based
on the detection of differential bacterial growth with and without
antibiotics in liquid cultures or on solid agar plates (4). In liquid
tests, detection is based on the change in OD, whereas the disk
diffusion method is used on solid agar plates to identify inhibition
zones (5). These methods are generally reliable for detecting re-
sistance and determining the antibiotic concentration that pre-
vents bacterial growth, making them predictive of the therapeutic
utility of different antibiotics. However, because it typically takes
1–2 d to get a reliable readout, these methods fail to guide treat-
ment in the early, often critical, stages of infection. As a conse-
quence, the physician is left with the difficult choice of prescribing
a broad spectrum antibiotic or risking that the first prescribed an-
tibiotic is ineffective.
Genotypic ASTs are based on detection of a specific genetic
marker (plasmids, genes, or mutations) associated with resistance
phenotypes by using the common genetic tools (e.g., sequence-
specific amplification by PCR, padlock probe-mediated rolling
circle amplification, or whole-genome sequencing) (3, 6). These
tests are highly sensitive and can limit the detection time to what is
needed to amplify selected DNA sequences to detectable levels,
but they require detailed advance knowledge of which resistance
markers to test for. If new resistance mechanisms arise, these
would go undetected and result in false negatives. Furthermore,
the presence of certain resistance genes/mutations does not nec-
essarily translate into phenotypic resistance.
Unlike the genotypic ASTs, the phenotypic ASTs directly as-
sess if the antibiotic stops bacterial growth, which is the most
relevant measure for the treating physician. New phenotypic
ASTs have, therefore, been developed in recent years to de-
crease the detection times. In particular, microfluidics (7) have
made it possible to increase the signal to background ratio in
the phenotypic assays by miniaturizing the bacterial incubation
chambers (8). Using microfluidic approaches, it has been possi-
ble to push the time requirement for AST to 1–3 h (9–13). Recent
promising data based on relative DNA copy number increase in
antibiotic-treated vs. reference cultures quantified using digital
PCR suggest that a biological response can be detected already
15 min after exposure to an antibiotic (14). However, the PCR
step still takes an additional 60 min, making this test too slow for a
point-of-care application. Here, we use direct single-cell imaging
to show that it is possible to determine if a bacterial isolate is
susceptible to an antibiotic in less than 10 min. When we include
the time for loading a dilute sample, the total time for the test is
less than 30 min, such as would be required for a point-of-care
application.
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one example where a fast AST
could improve medical practice by making it possible to pre-
scribe an antibiotic to which the infecting bacteria are susceptible
before the patient leaves the primary care unit. A fast AST for
UTI would have an important clinical impact given that there are
100 million cases of UTI per year worldwide, with high frequency
of resistance to primary antibiotics (15). Because 85% of all UTI
cases diagnosed in primary care are caused by Escherichia coli,
we have focused on this species, but the test can be expanded to
Significance
Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to human health. The
problem is aggravated by unnecessary and incorrect use of
broad spectrum antibiotics. One way to provide correct treat-
ment and slow down the development of antibiotic resistance
is to assay the susceptibility profile of the infecting bacteria
before treatment is initiated and let this information guide the
choice of antibiotic. Here, we present an antibiotic suscepti-
bility test that is sufficiently fast to be used at the point of care.
We show that it is possible to determine if a urinary tract in-
fection is caused by resistant bacteria within 30 min of loading
a urine sample, even if the bacterial concentration in the urine
is very low.

103 or 104 cfu/mL depending on country, which defines the re-
quired sensitivity of a test.
Results
Design and Loading of Microfluidic Chip. The microfluidic chip
design is shown in Fig. 1. (More details on the design can be
found in SI Materials and Methods and Figs. S1 and S2.) The de-
vice has two rows of cell traps. In each row, there are 2,000 cell
traps of dimension 1.25 × 1.25 × 50 μm (Fig. 1A) that can be
loaded with bacterial cells (red) from the front channel. A con-
striction at the end of each trap prevents cells from passing to the
back channel, while allowing the media to flow around the cells.
This sieve-like design, which is an extension of the Mother Ma-
chine (16), enables rapid loading and constant media flow over
the cells.
To test how rapidly dilute samples could be loaded, we mon-
itored the fraction of traps loaded over time for different cell
cultures with densities from 1,100 to 2 × 106 cfu/mL (Fig. 1B);
80% of the cell traps were filled within 30 s at a cell density of 2 ×
106, and even with the most dilute sample, 1,100 cells per 1 mL,
160 of 2,000 traps were filled in 10 min (SI Materials and Methods
and Fig. S3).
The loading time curves (Fig. 1B) can be used for real time
bacterial density determination (for example, in a urine sample).
Within 30 s, it would be possible to assess if it was a severe
bacterial infection with more than 105 cells per 1 mL, and within
10 min, it would be possible to determine if there is a clinically
relevant infection at all (17, 18).
Growth Rate Measurements. In a typical experiment, fluid control
is switched from loading to running mode when there is at least
one cell in one-half of the cell traps. This prevents filling the cell
traps and allows easy detection of the front end of the cell col-
umn. A few seconds after the switch, loading media inflow stops,
and test media start to reach the cell trap regions. The reference
population row receives the antibiotic-free medium, and the
treatment population row receives the media with the antibiotic
to be tested (Fig. 2A). After the media switch, we performed
time-lapse phase contrast microscopy (20× magnification) with
an automated x–y translation stage, where each of 4,000 cell
traps was imaged every 60 s (a time-lapse movie of one position
during a typical experiment can be seen in Movie S1).
Growth rates were first estimated for the cells in each indi-
vidual cell trap. The movement of the front-most cell pole in
each cell trap was monitored as a proxy for the cumulative cell
length changes for the cells within that trap. Fig. 2 B–D shows an
example of how the average growth rate for the cells in an in-
dividual cell trap was calculated for the reference cells without
antibiotics (Fig. 2 B, Left; C, Left; and D, Left) and antibiotic-
treated cells (Fig. 2 B, Right; C, Right; and D, Right). Fig. 2B
shows one cell trap every fifth frame of a 120-frame (60-min)
experiment, and the circles (blue or red) show the detected
front-most cell pole position at that frame. In Fig. 2C, the solid
dots (blue or red) show the length of the cell(s) within that cell
trap through the experiment. Fig. 2D shows the instantaneous
growth rate estimated as the relative length increase per time in
a sliding window over 10 min.
Distinguishing Two Populations Based on Growth Rate Statistics. In
Fig. 2 E–H, we applied the growth rate calculation for each of
2,000 cell traps in both rows, such that Fig. 2E shows length vs.
time for the two populations (the reference population is in Fig.
2E, Left, and the treatment population is in Fig. 2E, Right). The

 corresponding growth rates for individual traps are shown in Fig.
2F. In Fig. 2G, the growth rates for the individual cell traps from
both populations are averaged and normalized by the average
growth rate of the reference population. The framewise sample
SD is shown in light transparent color in Fig. 2G, and the SEM is
used to calculate a 99.9% confidence interval for the average
growth rate (darker shaded region in Fig. 2G). By combining the
data from the two columns (Fig. 2H), we could detect the re-
sponse of the antibiotic treatment population in this experiment
based on divergence from a 99.9% confidence interval (dashed
magenta line in Fig. 2H) earlier than the first data point at ∼5 min.
Fast Detection of Response to Antibiotic Treatment. Using the fast
antibiotic susceptibility test (fASTest), we determined the antibiotic
response time of E. coli (MG1655) to nine different antibiotics that
are used for UTIs. These included three different types of penicillins
[ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX-CLA), and
mecillinam (MEC)], one carbapenem [doripenem (DOR)], two
different fluoroquinolones [ciprofloxacin (CIP) and levofloxacin
(LEV)], and three other agents [fosfomycin (FOS), nitrofurantoin
(NIT), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)]. We
followed The European Committee on Antimicrobial Suscep-
tibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoint value recommendations
for the test concentrations of each particular antibiotic and the
testing media requirements. We loaded the bacteria into the
microfluidic chip and supplied growth media (GM) without anti-
biotic to one row (reference population) and GM with antibiotic
to the other (treatment population). With this setup, we could
detect the differential growth rate between treatment and reference
populations in 3 min for CIP, LEV, MEC, NIT, and TMP-SMX;
7 min for AMX-CLA and DOR; 9 min for FOS; and 11 min for
ampicillin based on 99.9% confidence intervals (Fig. 3).
Importantly, the response curves were very reproducible be-
tween biological replicates, as shown for CIP and ampicillin in SI
Materials and Methods and Fig. S4. This implies that the differ-
ential responses to the different drugs were not caused by limited
time resolution in the assay but rather, that the measurement was
sufficiently fast to monitor the actual biological response time.
These experiments were run in the standard susceptibility testing
Mueller–Hinton (MH) media; however, in SI Materials and
Methods, we show that response times were similar for bacteria
grown in urine (Fig. S5). In SI Materials and Methods and Movies
S2 and S3, we also show that the fASTest works on Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which are two other
major pathogens causing uncomplicated UTI. The response time
for S. saprophyticus was slower as expected because of its longer
generation time (Fig. S6).
Fast Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Clinical Isolates. To be
practically useful, fASTest needs to differentiate between strains
with clinically relevant spectra of resistance mutations and suscep-
tible strains in their responses to the antibiotic. This is important,
because even resistant bacteria can show a growth rate reduction
caused by the presence of an antibiotic, and one cannot, therefore,

 directly conclude that a strain is susceptible just because it has
impaired growth compared with untreated cells (as seen in Fig. 3).
For this reason, we first tested CIP susceptibility of an E. coli strain
that was genetically engineered to be resistant to ciprofloxacin
(CipR) because of the introduction of several clinically observed
mutations (gyrA1-S83L gyrA2-D87N parC-S80I) (19) and compared
the results with those of the congenic susceptible WT E. coli strain
(CipS) (Fig. 4 A and B). During the first minutes of the test, the
CipR strain grew slightly slower when treated with CIP than its
untreated reference population (Fig. 4A) before recovering to the
same growth rate. The CipS strain responded more strongly (Fig.
4B), which made it possible to distinguish the WT strain from its
constructed resistant counterpart in a few minutes.
Next, we tested 50 clinical isolates of uropathogenic E. coli
(UPEC) strains for CIP susceptibility. Samples were initially
collected and characterized by the Uppsala University Hospital
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory using the gold standard disk
diffusion test for CIP susceptibility/resistance as a part of routine
for clinical diagnosis. The antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was
tested by the disk diffusion method recommended by the Eu-
ropean Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (5). A
total of 25 CIP-susceptible and 25 CipR isolates were given to us.
We received those samples blinded: without the patient or the
CIP susceptibility information. One isolate did not grow in the
liquid cultures during the preparations and was, therefore, ex-
cluded from the study. The remaining 49 isolates were tested for
CIP susceptibility using the fASTest. Subsequently, the results
were compared with the results from the hospital.
The fASTest results of 49 UPEC clinical isolates are given in
Fig. 4 C–E. The growth rate of the untreated reference pop-
ulation varied between the isolates without any obvious differ-
ences between resistant and susceptible isolates (Fig. 4C). CIP
growth rates of treated populations did not reveal a striking
distinction between the resistant and the susceptible isolates (Fig.
4D). However, when the growth rate of the CIP-treated population
was normalized with the growth rate of the untreated reference
population from the same experiment, susceptible and reference
isolates grouped apart after the first 10 min (Fig. 4E). As can be
seen in Fig. 4E, all of 24 resistant strains and 25 susceptible strains
were grouped in agreement with gold standard disk diffusion
measurements within 10 min. This complete agreement corre-
sponds to 86.28–100.00% sensitivity and 85.75–100.00% specificity
for detecting resistance.
Discussion
This study originated in an investigation of the cell to cell vari-
ation in the bacterial cell cycle (20), which required us to develop
tools to determine growth rates very accurately for individual
E. coli cells. The process of averaging the growth rate from several
hundred individual bacteria makes it possible to detect changes
in growth as fast as the biological responses to the antibiotic (Fig.
S4). For this reason, it is not possible to find a phenotypic AST
based on the growth rate response that is faster than the fASTest.
It is important to note that the same time resolution cannot be
achieved in a bulk measurement of the growth rate, because in
that case, the averaging is done over the cells before the readout,
which means that the unavoidable readout noise will impact the
growth rate estimate much more than if it is averaged over the
cells after the readout.
The sensitivity of fASTest in terms of how many cells per
milliliter can be detected is only dependent on how much time is
spent loading the cells. For 104 cfu/mL, which is in the lower range
for clinically relevant UTIs, sufficient loading can be achieved in
5 min, because for fASTest, it is sufficient to collect ≈100 bacteria.
However, the sensitivity will practically depend on which body
fluid the sample is collected from. For example, in UTI samples,
there may be bacterial contamination from the skin or vaginal flora
that sets the sensitivity limit for the infecting species. However,
cell traps that contain contaminants may in many cases be excluded
based on the morphology and growth rate of the contaminants.

MICROBIOLOGY
 A challenge related to contamination is polymicrobial infec-
tions. These are rare for uncomplicated UTIs but commonly
observed for, for example, catheter users (21). Because we detect
all bacteria in the sample and do not only detect those that grow
under standard plating assays, polymicrobial infections can be
detected as a high diversity of growth rates in the reference
channel. If the mixed strains also display a diverse resistance
pattern, this would be observed as a broadened growth rate
distribution after antibiotic treatment. An actual point-of-care test
would, therefore, have to consider other aspects of the growth rate
distribution than just the average. There may, for example, be
specific automated indications if a few individual bacteria keep
growing fast in a background of dying cells, because this may in-
dicate a polymicrobial infection with a complex resistance spec-
trum. An alternative strategy for the test to deal with polymicrobial
infections and contaminations is to make it time sequential, such
that the growth rate is determined for the cells in each cell trap
before and after antibiotic treatment. This allows for focusing the
analysis on only growing cells and avoiding biases in the averaging
caused by an uneven distribution of different species between the
reference channel and the treatment channel. A test also needs to
consider the possible situation where the cells in the reference
channel grow so slowly that a lack of response in treatment channel
would be unreliable.
We have here focused on bacterial species and antibiotics
related to UTIs, but it is likely that the same principles would
work for sepsis, mastitis, or meningitis (i.e., in blood, milk, or
cerebrospinal fluid that normally should be devoid of bacterial-
sized cells). Independent of the sample, the key principle will be
true: it is sufficient to measure the single-cell growth of a few
hundred bacteria to get very close to the theoretical time limit
for monitoring the response to an antibiotic in real time.
In summary, samples with more than 104 cfu/mL can be loaded
in less than 10 min, and thus, no precultivation is needed for pa-
tient urine samples. Furthermore, any eukaryotic cell in the sample
will be too large to pass through the filtration region within the
microfluidic chip or enter the cell channels and disturb the assay.
Thus, the combined AST time (loading, measurement, and readout)
of the sample is less than 30 min. Based on the small clinical study
of CIP susceptibility, the observed sensitivity and specificity of the

methodology.
Materials and Methods
The Microfluidic Chip. The microfluidic chip consists of a cover glass (1.5) and a
micromolded silicon elastomer [Sylgard 184; polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)]
that are covalently bonded together. For micromolding, we used the stan-
dard soft lithography techniques as described in SI Materials and Methods.
fASTest Protocol. All of the fASTest runs described in this paper follow this
common protocol: growth of overnight culture (ONC), growth of loading
culture, connection of microfluidic flow control setup to the microfluidic chip,
aligning the chip to the camera, selection of positions to be imaged, running
an imaging test to ensure the stability of the microfluidic chip, connecting the
loading culture to the macrofluidic setup, loading the cells from loading
culture, and starting the antibiotic application and automated phase contrast
microscopy.
Bacterial Strains. The strains used were WT strain DA5438 (E. coli MG1655),
ampicillin-resistant strain DA28097 [E. coli del(PlacI_lacIZYA)::amp], CipR
strain DA20859 (E. coli gyrA1-S83L, gyrA2-D87N, parC-S80I), and two other
species: DA12755 (K. pneumoniae; ATCC13883) and DA14015 (S. saprophyticus).
GM. Depending on the experiment, we used either Mueller–Hinton Broth
(70192–500G; Sigma-Aldrich) or urine as GM. When indicated, the GM was
supplemented with an antibiotic. In preparation of urine media, morning
urine was collected, and filtered (nitrocellulose filter; 0.2-μm pore size). All
media are supplemented with a surfactant [Pluronic F-108; 542342; Sigma-
Aldrich; 0.085% (wt/vol) final concentration] to prevent the attachment of
the bacteria to the PDMS surface.
Culture Conditions. For ONC, bacteria from the glycerol stocks were inoculated
into 2 mL GM and incubated (37 °C; shaking at 225 rpm) for ∼16 h. For loading
culture, 2.5 μL ONC is diluted 1:800 to a total of 2 mL GM and incubated (37 °C;
shaking at 225 rpm) for 120 min. For growth in the chip, the chip was con-
tinuously supplied with GM and incubated in the microscope cage incubator
at 37 °C before, during, and after the loading of bacterial culture and also,
during the test. The loading culture was connected to the fluidic setup and
kept in the cage incubator at 37 °C. GM was kept outside of the cage in-
cubator at room temperature (21 °C).
Microfluidic Flow Control Setup Details. Flow direction and rate during the
experiment were maintained by pressure-driven flow. An electropneumatic
controller from Elveflow (OB1 MkIII) regulated the air pressure applied to
the closed fluidic reservoirs. Pressures, flow rates, and tubing details are
explained in SI Materials and Methods. The electropneumatic controller was
programmed in MATLAB.
Automated Phase Contrast Microscopy. We used a Nikon Ti-E inverted mi-
croscope with a 20× objective (CFI Plan Apo Lambda DM 20× or CFI S Plan
Fluor ELWD ADM 20×), with a motorized x–y stage, and a CMOS camera
(DMK23U274; The Imaging Source). The setup was maintained within the
Cage Incubator Enclosure (custom made by Okolab), where the temperature
was maintained at 37 °C by a temperature controller (Airtherm-Atx; World
Precision Instruments). Both the microscope and the camera were controlled
by an open source microscopy software (MicroManager 1.4.19). Phase con-
trast images were acquired by the software’s multidimensional acquisition
feature, through which the motorized stage moved the fluidic chip to
36 different positions. Each position was imaged every 30 or 60 s depending
on the particular experiment. Each experiment was 30 min, although the
imaging could be continued longer if needed to provide insights on kill
dynamics.
Image Processing. The images were processed for detection of each row in the
raw image and cell traps and empty traps in each row, removing background
and performing pole detection to obtain the cell pole detection in each frame
of each position using an algorithm developed in MATLAB. Details of this
algorithm are given in SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S7.
Data Analysis. For cell pole tracking, we used μTrack (22). For growth rate
calculation of individual cells, we applied a sliding window of data points
(length) and fitted a linear function to the logarithm of them. The sliding
window grows from 2 to 10 min in the beginning of the experiment and stays
at 10 min afterward. We filtered some data based on fixed criteria to remove
misidentified particles or cells that were dead from the beginning as well as
the traps that were overly filled or left empty during the loading. Details of
filters applied are given in SI Materials and Methods.
All raw data will be made available upon request for noncommercial
interests. The ethical review committee in Uppsala has no objection to this
study (reference no. 2017/051).
