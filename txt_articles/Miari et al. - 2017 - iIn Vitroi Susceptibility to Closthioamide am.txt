ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the leading antimicrobial resistance
threats worldwide. This study determined the MICs of closthioamide to be 0.008 to
0.5 mg/liter for clinical N. gonorrhoeae strains and related species. Cross-resistance
with existing antimicrobial resistance was not detected, indicating that closthioam-
ide could be used to treat drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
KEYWORDS Neisseria gonorrhoeae, antimicrobial agents, closthioamide
N
eisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the most important antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
threats worldwide (1). Since the discovery of penicillin, N. gonorrhoeae has devel-
oped resistance to every therapeutic antimicrobial agent used (2).
Dual therapy for gonorrhea, with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, was introduced in
2011 (3) as a strategy to delay AMR. These antibiotics represent the last reliable classes
of antibiotics recommended for the empirical treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infection (4),
and worryingly, the MICs to both antibiotics are increasing annually (5). This is com-
plicated further by reports of treatment failure due to extended-spectrum cephalospo-
rin (ESC) resistance occurring worldwide.
In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an action plan to combat
the spread and impact of N. gonorrhoeae (1). Given that there is no effective vaccine
against gonorrhea and antimicrobial therapy is still one the most important means of
gonorrhea control, the WHO advocates research into new antimicrobials (1).
Closthioamide (CTA), discovered in 2010, was isolated from the anaerobic bacterium
Clostridium cellulolyticum (6). It represents a new class of natural polythioamide anti-
biotics and has been shown to have high in vitro activity against other AMR microor-
ganisms (7). Its mode of action is thought to be by the inhibition of DNA gyrase (7).
Cross-resistance to quinolone antibiotics has not been observed to date, suggesting a
different mechanism of action (7). Given its high potency with multidrug-resistant
(MDR) bacteria, closthioamide is a good candidate for testing against N. gonorrhoeae.
Bacterial strains and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 149 clinical
and eight WHO reference N. gonorrhoeae isolates, as well as four commensal Neisseria
strains, were examined in this study. These were provided by Barts Health NHS Trust, St
George’
s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust,
and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust hospital laboratories. The MICs for CTA were deter-
mined by the agar dilution method as previously described (8). The CTA MIC range
tested was 0.002 mg/liter to 1 mg/liter. Of the 149 clinical strains, the MICs to penicillin,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin had previously
been determined for 131, and the MICs to cefixime were known for 127. The MICs of
the WHO reference strains are shown in Table 1. Full MIC data for all of the antibiotics
tested are provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material.

 CTA synthesis. Closthioamide was synthesized according to the route described by
Hertweck and coworkers (9, 10). The core of CTA was synthesized by two consecutive
peptide couplings and deprotections onto a 1,3-diaminopropane core with an
N-protected beta-alanine, followed by a third peptide coupling to install the aromatic
benzoic acid end caps. Thionation with Lawesson’
s reagent and deprotection under
highly acidic conditions yielded CTA in five longest linear steps.
All of the reagents involved in the synthesis of CTA were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich, with the exception of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI),
which was obtained from Manchester Organics. All of the reaction solvents used for the
synthesis were anhydrous and of the highest grade from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the
routine solvents for workup and purification were obtained from VWR. The closthio-
amide stock solution was prepared at 100 mg/liter in 100% ethanol.
Statistical analysis. MIC50 and MIC90 were calculated with MIC data from clinical
gonococcal strains only. The correlation between MICs for CTA and those for other
antibiotics was determined with a Spearman’
s rank correlation test using STATA 14.2.
The correlation coefficient was calculated using MIC data from clinical and reference
gonococcal strains.
CTA susceptibility and cross-resistance to existing antimicrobials. The CTA MICs
for the 149 clinical strains ranged between 0.008 mg/liter and 0.25 mg/liter (Table S1).
The numbers of isolates with MICs of 0.008 mg/liter, 0.015 mg/liter, 0.031 mg/liter, 0.063
mg/liter, 0.125 mg/liter, and 0.25 mg/liter were one (1%), six (4%), 14 (9%), 53 (36%), 72
(48%), and three (2%), respectively (Fig. 1). The MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.063 mg/liter
and 0.125 mg/liter, respectively. The CTA MICs of N. lactamica and N. perflava were
0.063 mg/liter and 0.5 mg/liter, respectively, and both N. flavescens strains had MICs
of �1 mg/liter.
No significant correlation was identified between the MICs of the tested antibiotics.
MICs for CTA and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, had a correlation coefficient of 0.07

 (Fig. 2). The numbers of isolates for each combination of CTA and ciprofloxacin MICs are
shown in Table 2. MICs for azithromycin had the highest correlation with CTA MICs with
an R2 0.48.
The imminent threat of untreatable gonorrhea is a global problem that urgently
requires the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, the novel anti-
microbial CTA inhibited the growth of 146/149 (98%) clinical gonococcal strains at
�0.125 mg/liter, suggesting the use of a low concentration for a therapeutic dose
would reduce any potential toxicity. Importantly, isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and
the first-line therapeutic agents ceftriaxone and azithromycin are as susceptible to CTA
as strains sensitive to these antibiotics, suggesting CTA could be effective clinically
against MDR N. gonorrhoeae strains. Closthioamide activity against N. gonorrhoeae is
comparable to its activity against other AMR organisms (7).
The CTA mode of action has been linked to DNA gyrase, which is also a target for
fluoroquinolones, suggesting the potential for cross-resistance with antibiotics such as
ciprofloxacin. However, the analysis of the clinical isolates demonstrated no correlation
between MICs of the two antibiotics. This is also supported by a study by Chiriac et al.,
FIG 2 Correlation between CTA and ciprofloxacin MICs. MIC data for CTA and ciprofloxacin from 139
clinical strains were used to calculate a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.07.

 who found no cross-resistances between the two antimicrobials, although they did not
examine N. gonorrhoeae (7). This suggests that the active site for CTA may be elsewhere
in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR).
Interestingly, the two N. perflava strains had the highest CTA MICs (�1 mg/liter), and
the basis of this relative resistance requires further research to understand the specific
resistance mechanisms.
In conclusion, CTA has high anti-gonococcal activity in vitro, even for multidrug-
resistant isolates, but further studies to evaluate the clinical potential of this antimi-
crobial are urgently required in light of the public health threat that gonorrhea poses.
