Abstract
Rationale How the smell of alcohol impacts alcohol-related
thoughts and behaviours is unclear, though it is well-
documented that alcohol-related stimuli and environments
may trigger these.
Objectives The current study, therefore, aimed to investigate
the priming effects of both visual and olfactory alcohol cues
on inhibitory control.
Method Forty individuals (M age=23.65, SD=6.52) com-
pleted a go/no-go association task (GNAT) which measured
reaction times, response accuracy and false alarm rates whilst
being exposed to alcohol-related (or neutral) olfactory and
visual cues.
Results Alcohol-related visual cues elicited lower false alarm
rates, slower reaction times and higher accuracy rates relative
to neutral pictorial cues. False alarm rates were significantly
higher for those exposed to alcohol as opposed to neutral
olfactory cues.
Conclusions By highlighting that exposure to alcohol-related
olfactory cues may impede response inhibition, the results
indicate that exposure to such stimuli may contribute to the
activation of cognitive responses which may drive
consumption.

The pairing of the psychological and physiological effects of
alcohol consumption with related paraphernalia, people or
places can lead to conditioned responses to such stimuli, in
the absence of the substance (Rohsenow et al. 1990). The
presentation of such stimuli (e.g. the sight of an alcoholic
beverage) has been shown to trigger such responses in both
clinical and non-clinical populations (e.g. Cooney et al. 1987;
Kenny et al. 2006; Nees et al. 2012; Siegel 2001; Traylor et al.
2011; see also Glautier et al. 1992; Kambouropoulos and
Staiger 2001; Ramirez et. al. 2014). These include physio-
logical arousal (Kenny 2007; Sinha et al. 2009), such as
increased salivation (Rohsenow et al. 1994), electro der-
mal activity (Garland et al. 2012; Stormark et al. 1993),
and heart rate (Ingjaldsson et al. 2003). Exposure to
substance-related cues and environments has also been
found to be related to changes in alcohol consumption
(Monk et al. 2015), as well as related cognitions (Monk
and Heim 2013a, b, 2014), relapse (e.g. Carter and
Tiffany 1999; Marlatt 1990; Siegel 2005; Zironi et al.
2006) and craving (Conklin and Tiffany 2002; Courtney
and Ray 2014; Modell and Mountz 1995).
Such findings are in keeping with the notion that
substance-related cues not only involuntarily capture people’s
attention but also automatically trigger arousal associations
(Field and Cox 2008; Wiers et al. 2002). Accordingly,
alcohol-salient environments can be important contextual
moderators of attentional biases, as has been demonstrated
in both clinical (Field et al. 2014) and non-clinical groups
(Albery et al. 2015). For instance, light drinkers are passively
exposed to high levels of alcohol-related cues in their every-
day lives (e.g. by spending much of their time in bars/pubs),

 whilst heavy drinkers are actively engaged with the alcohol-
related cues in their environment (when drinking). As such,
light drinkers display higher levels of attentional bias towards
alcohol-related words (passive cues) in comparison to heavy
drinkers. Specifically, in contrast to light drinkers, heavy
drinkers are actively involved in alcohol consumption, mean-
ing they display high levels of alcohol-related attentional in-
terference, regardless of how much time they spend in
alcohol-related contexts. Further attentional interference in re-
sponse to passive cue exposure is thus not evident (Albery
et al. 2015). It is therefore apparent that alcohol-related atten-
tional biases fluctuate and are shaped by exposure to the con-
textual cues that individuals encounter in everyday life.
Context can therefore influence the degree of attentional bias
individuals have towards alcohol.
Inhibition controls the strength of alcohol-related atten-
tional biases (Field and Cox 2008) and is one of the pro-
cesses believed to underlie the aetiology of addictive behav-
iours (Wiers et al. 2002). Inhibitory control relies on a lim-
ited resource (Inzlicht and Berkman 2015; Muraven and
Baumeister 2000) which may be overwhelmed in the pres-
ence of motivational alcohol cues (although see Monti and
Rohsenow 1999 for cue exposure therapy). Indeed, it has
been suggested that higher levels of impulsiveness and low-
er inhibitory control are associated with stronger cue-elicited
cravings for alcohol in clinical samples (Papachristou et al.
2013). Changes in inhibitory control responses during expo-
sure to alcohol-related pictorial cues have also been ob-
served. Specifically, in a go/no-go task, participants appear
to make more commission errors (false alarm rate; FAR)
when no-go stimuli are super-imposed on alcohol-related
images (Petit et al. 2012). Further, participants seem to re-
spond faster when alcohol stimuli are ‘go’ stimuli (Kreusch
et al. 2013).
However, whilst research has focused on the way in which
alcohol-related visual, auditory and tactile cues shape alcohol-
related thoughts and behaviours (Stein et al. 2000), there has
been a distinct lack of exploration into possible effects of
olfactory stimuli. Early research indicates that the smell of
alcohol leads to an increase in self-reported desire to drink
(Laberg 1990), whilst smelling an alcoholic drink appears to
increase reported craving (Litt and Cooney 1999). Whilst a
review by Schacht and colleagues (2013) notes the use of
olfactory cues in studies of alcohol-related cue reactivity, the
impact of olfaction on inhibitory processes remains unex-
plored. The current research therefore aims to examine this
suggestion by introducing olfactory cues during the adminis-
tration of the go/no-go task (GNG; Nosek and Banaji 2001).
It was predicted that alcohol-related (as opposed to neutral)
olfactory cues would make alcohol-related stimuli more sa-
lient, leading to difficulties in inhibiting responses and
resulting in higher FARs for these no-go alcohol-related
stimuli.
Method
Participants
Forty participants (21 females, aged 19–48 years, M=22.76,
SD=5.97, 19 males, aged 19–52 years, M=24.63, SD=7.11)
were recruited via opportunity sampling and were randomly
allocated to either alcohol (n=20) or neutral olfactory cue
conditions. Preliminary analyses suggested that there were
no significant differences in the age (t (38)=.49, p=0.63),
gender (Χ2 (1, N=40)=0.09, p=0.77) or AUDIT scores (t
(38)=−0.33, p=0.75) of those randomly allocated to the al-
cohol or control olfactory conditions. Demographics for the
groups are shown in Table 1, as well as mean AUDIT scores.
The latter are slightly above the cut-off for clinical assessment
(scores of 8 or above being deemed to indicate hazardous or
harmful alcohol use; Babor et al. 2001; Saunders et al. 1993).
Participants are hence comparable with recent research using
UK student samples (Clarke et al. 2015; Moss et al. 2015).
Design
A 2 (visual stimuli: alcohol and neutral) × 2 (olfactory cues:
alcohol or neutral) mixed-groups design was used to examine
the effect of olfactory and visual cues on FARs, reaction time
on go trials (ms), and accuracy on the GNAT. All participants
were exposed to both alcohol and neutral visual stimuli and
random allocation was used to allocate participants to the ol-
factory cueing or control conditions.
Stimuli and materials
The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT—
Saunders et al. 1993) is a 10-item questionnaire which ex-
plores the domains of alcohol consumption, drinking behav-
iour and alcohol-related problems. Responses to each question
are scored from 0 to 4, with a maximum possible score of 40.
AUDIT provides a simple method of early detection of haz-
ardous and harmful alcohol use in primary health care settings
and is derived from a cross-national study. Good internal con-
sistency on this measure was demonstrated in the current sam-
ple (Cronbach’s α=0.72).

 The go/no-go association task (GNAT) used in this re-
search utilised two picture sets for the visual cues: one set
contained neutral pictures (the letter K vs. the other 25 letters)
and the other set with bar-related pictures (a beer bottle vs. 25
water bottle pictures). Pictures of the letter K and beer were
the target stimuli (14 % were no-go—36 no-go, 224 go stimuli
used). All pictures were graphically equivalent in terms of
colours, contrasts, objects shown and viewing angles.
Branding was removed as appropriate and all pictures were
presented on a white background using E-Prime 2.0 software.
A pre-treated olfactory mask was worn by all participants.
This design was preferred to more traditional olfactory re-
search designs in which participants inhale from a beaker, as
it has been suggested that this earlier design may produce
demand characteristics in responses (Litt and Cooney 1999).
Participants in the current study were informed that external
light, sound and smell have been previously demonstrated to
adversely impact performance in the GNAT. The task instruc-
tions then went on to explain that it was for this reason that the
current study had taken steps to control these factors, by using
a mask, controlled lighting and sound-cancelling headphones
which respondents were also required to wear. This was done
with the intention of making the olfactory cues less overt so as
to prevent demand characteristics. Post-test assessments sug-
gested that although participants had noticed a slight smell
from the mask, they had not inferred the true aim of the re-
search nor interpreted smell as a variable of interest in the
research. During debriefing, participants were also asked not
to share the aims of the research with other potential study
candidates.
Research indicates that an odour that is not from the
same semantic category as alcohol, but is equally liked
or disliked, will ensure a priming effect (Smeets and
Dijksterhuis 2014). Furthermore, olfactory intensity has
been shown to impact odour perception, specifically at
higher concentrations (Smeets and Dijksterhuis 2014). It
was therefore necessary to ensure that the filters inside
the masks worn by participants contained subtle yet
comparable scents. Pilot testing was, therefore, carried
out using a number of varying alcohol-related and neu-
tral smells (at varying doses) in order to uncover two
scents (one from each category) which were equally
liked and rated as having an equivalent intensity. A
pipette was utilised in order pre-treat the masks with
small amounts of vodka (5 ml of diluted Glenn’s vodka,
1:5 dilution, administered as the alcohol-related olfacto-
ry cue) or citrus oil (5 ml of diluted oil, 1:10 dilution,
as the control condition).
Procedure
This research was approved by the appropriate ethics com-
mittee and the research was therefore been performed in
accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the
1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All persons gave their in-
formed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. This
research introduced olfactory cues into the paradigm of
Kreusch et al. (2013), who inserted alcohol-related visual
into the GNAT. Following ethical approval, participants
were recruited, briefed and seated in front of a computer.
They were then asked to fit the inhalation mask.
Response inhibition towards alcohol cues was assessed by
a GNAT programmed with E-Prime 2.0. In the GNAT, each
trial began with a white fixation cross on a black background
for 500 ms. Immediately, after the onset of the fixation cross, a
stimulus was presented in the centre against the black screen
for 500 ms Fig. 1.
Participants were required to inhibit their response to
target stimuli (see materials; alcohol condition=bottle of
beer; neutral condition=letter K), but to respond to all
other stimuli. If participants responded incorrectly (i.e.
they pressed the space bar when a target stimuli was
presented in no-go trials), a feedback tone (250 ms) was
presented. The experiment was organised into 16 blocks,
eight with alcohol visual stimuli and eight with neutral
(letter) stimuli. The order of blocks was randomised and
trial order was pseudo-randomised (with no more than
three of any given trial being permitted in a row and no
blocks starting with a no-go trial). The distribution of the
blocks and trials was also checked post hoc in order to
ensure distribution equivalency between olfactory and neu-
tral cue conditions. The study lasted approximately 30 min
and included breaks between blocks to mitigate fatigue.
The mask was removed at the end of testing. Following
the GNAT task, participants were asked to provide basic
demographic information and to complete the AUDIT, pri-
or to receiving a full debrief. This was the final compo-
nent of testing in order to limit the signal strength of the
study (c.f. Davies and Best 1996).

 Results
Missing trial data accounted for only 4 % (1371/31201). A
low pass filter (200 ms) was used, as stimuli were presented
for 500 ms, with the experiment moving onto the next trial at
that point. Following screening for normality, a 2 (visual stim-
uli: alcohol and neutral) × 2 (olfactory cues: alcohol or non-
alcohol) mixed Factorial ANOVA was used to examine the
effect of olfactory and visual stimuli on a go/no-go task.
Three analyses were conducted: one with FAR as the depen-
dent variable, one with reaction times on go trials (ms), and
one with response accuracy on Go trials.1 Means and standard
deviations of participants’ FAR, accuracy and reaction times
across olfactory and visual cueing conditions are reported in
Table 2. A main effect of olfactory cue was found (F(1,
38)=5.42, p=0.03, ηp
2= 0.13) such that the FAR was higher
for those receiving the alcohol olfactory cue (M = 0.56,
SD = 0.04) than for the control olfactory cue (M = 0.42,
SD=0.04). Furthermore, there was a main effect of pictorial
target (F(1, 38)=15.65, p≤0.01, ηp
2 = 0.29), such that the FAR
was higher for the neutral (letters) pictorial targets in compar-
ison with the alcohol pictorial targets. There was no significant
interaction between olfactory cue and pictorial target (F(1,
38)=0.29, p=0.60, ηp
2 = 0.01).
Reaction time on go trials
Whilst there was no main effect of olfactory cue on reaction
time (F(1, 38)=0.16, p>0.69, ηp
2= 0.00), a significant main
effect of pictorial target on reaction time was found (F(1,
38)=4.77, p=0.04, ηp
2= 0.11) such that reaction time was
slower for the neutral pictorial target than for the alcohol pic-
torial target. There was no significant interaction between ol-
factory cue and the pictorial target (F(1, 38)=0.93, p=0.34,
ηp
2= 0.02).
Accuracy on go trials
There was no main effect of olfactory cue on go accuracy rates
(F(1, 38)=0.76, p=0.39, ηp
2= 0.02) with the accuracy slightly
higher for the control olfactory cue than the alcohol olfactory
cue. Yet there was a main effect of pictorial target on accuracy
(F(1, 38)=4.26, p=0.05, ηp
2= 0.01), such that accuracy was
significantly higher for the alcohol pictorial target than the
neutral pictorial target. There was no significant interaction
between olfactory cue and pictorial target (F(1, 38)=0.71,
p=0.41, ηp
2= 0.02).
Separate analyses for alcohol and neutral visual stimuli
were also run (Appendix 1). The pattern shown was the same
as for combined analyses. D′ scores were also calculated2 (as
per Macmillan and Creelman 1991). Combined analyses
showed the same pattern of results as for FAR, as did separate
analyses (Appendix 1). The separate analyses were conducted
due to the different processes involved in letter recognition
and selection of pictures (Carr et al. 1982).
Discussion
The aim of the present research was to examine the extent to
which olfactory cues impact response inhibition in a popula-
tion of social-drinkers using GNAT. As hypothesised, FARs
were significantly higher among respondents receiving the
alcohol olfactory cue than those in the control condition.
Nonetheless, that this effect was generalised across both alco-
hol and non-alcohol-related visual cues was not predicted.
Early research indicates that the smell of alcohol leads to in-
creases in self-reported desire to drink (Laberg 1990) and
craving (Litt and Cooney 1999). The current research contrib-
utes to this body of knowledge by suggesting that inhibitory
control may also be affected by the smell of alcohol in a
similar fashion. It may be hypothesised that this operates via
the triggering of associated physiological and cognitive pro-
cesses, in-line with theories of cue reactivity. These findings
are also apparently in-line with the assertion that (non-
olfactory) cues elicit a psychomotor-activating response (c.f.
Wiers et al. 2002). This may lead to difficulties in inhibiting a
dominant response (also see Roberts et al. 2014), thus leading
to more errors than in those not exposed to such cues. In this
way, the current findings support the findings of previous
research that exposure to alcohol-related stimuli results in re-
duced accuracy in tasks requiring inhibitory control (Petit
et al. 2012).
1 FAR to no-go stimuli are commission errors to K or alcohol images—
when participants are not meant to respond but do. The ‘hit rate’ to Go
trials is equivalent to omission errors (proportion of stimuli responded to
correctly)
2 Combined analyses: There was a main effect of olfactory cue (F(1,
38) = 4.66, p = 0.04, ηp
2 = 0.11), insomuch that D’ for those receiving the
alcohol cue was lower (M = 1.66, SD = 0.61) than those receiving the
neutral cue (M = 2.00, SD = 0.62), indicating performance was signifi-
cantly affected by the alcohol olfactory cue. There was also a main effect
of pictorial target (F(1, 38) = 30.76, p ≤ 0.01, ηp
2 = 0.45), with D′ for alco-
hol stimuli higher (M = 2.06, SD = 0.67) than for neutral stimuli
(M = 1.60, SD = 0.51), indicating performance on the neutral stimuli
was significantly worse than for alcohol stimuli. There was no interaction
between olfactory cue and pictorial target (F(1, 38) = 0.17, p = 0.68,
ηp
2 = 0.00).
Separate analyses: For the alcohol stimuli, there was a marginal
main effect of olfactory cue (F(1, 38) = 3.48, p = .07, ηp
2 = 0.08), insomuch
that D’ for those receiving the alcohol cue was lower (M = 1.87,
SD = 0.66) than those receiving the neutral cue (M = 2.25, SD = 0.63).
For the neutral stimuli, there was also a marginal main of effect of olfac-
tory cue (F(1, 38) = 4.10, p = 0.05, ηp
2 = 0.10), with D’ for those receiving
the alcohol cue lower (M = 1.44, SD = 0.48) than those receiving the
neutral cue (M = 1.75, SD = 0.50). Overall, this suggests that performance
for both types of stimuli was affected by the alcohol olfactory cue.

 However, it was not expected that alcohol-related olfactory
cues would affect inhibition (manifest in increased FARs),
irrespective of the type of visual cue. These findings may
therefore demonstrate a pattern of generalised response im-
pairment (i.e. inhibition impairment regardless of visual stim-
uli). This effect is in keeping with the wider literature that
suggests that responses to unique stimuli (e.g. Baldi et al.
2004; Mühlberger et al. 2014) including olfactory cues (e.g.
Daly et al. 2001), can become generalised to wider contexts
and stimuli. In other words, there may be a carryover effect
from responding to specific cues, meaning that responses
translate to wider stimuli. Whilst not hitherto examined in this
field, such findings may therefore suggest that alcohol-related
olfactory cues may reduce inhibition to both alcohol-related
and non-alcohol-related cues. The real-world drivers of pro-
cesses such as attentional bias and inhibitory control require
further examination. Even so, the current research contributes
to the growing body of research that proffers the role of a
myriad of complex contextual cues.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that there were no observed
effects of olfactory cue on response time or accuracy on go
trials. In the GNAT, response selection occurs in conjunction
with response inhibition, as respondents must select whether
to execute an appropriate response or to inhibit an inappropri-
ate response (Suskauer et al. 2008). If one considers that re-
sponse selection is needed to process which responses to
make, then response inhibition is needed to withhold the re-
sponse for ‘no-go’ target (see below for further discussion). If
the olfactory cue impacted selection (rather than or more than
response inhibition) then it would be expected that perfor-
mance on the task using letters would be impaired over and
above performance on the alcohol-related pictorial stimuli, as
the former arguably places a greater demand on response se-
lection. The current findings may therefore indicate that olfac-
tory cues may have very specific effects on response inhibi-
tion (rather than selection). Such assertions are, nonetheless,
speculative at this stage and further research is recommended
to test this hypothesis.
Hypotheses regarding the effect of visual alcohol-related
cues were not supported. Here, FAR and accuracy was higher,
and reaction times slower, for the neutral stimuli in compari-
son with responses to alcohol-related pictures. Such findings
do not align with previous indications of heightened response
times and cue reactivity towards alcohol stimuli (Kreusch
et al. 2013; Petit et al. 2012). Petit et al. (2012) also showed
that participants found it harder to inhibit responses to alcohol-
related stimuli, leading to reduced accuracy. These divergent
results may be explained by a number of differences between
the stimuli used in the current study compared to others. First,
Kreusch et al. (2013) used pictures of neutral objects (e.g. a
stapler) as the non-target stimuli, whereas the current study
used letters, which are of a different semantic category and
thus may evoke different responses and or processes in
responding. Second, there were more non-target stimuli in
the current study when compared to previous research. This
may require a greater degree of response selection from par-
ticipants, in addition to the response inhibition necessitated by
this task. As response selection involves the selection of either
the appropriate response or the choice to inhibit an inappro-
priate response (Simmonds et al. 2008), tasks requiring re-
sponse selection as well as response inhibition may result in
slower responses and greater chances of errors due to addi-
tional processing. Furthermore, as noted by Kreusch and col-
leagues (2013), the provision of alcohol-related questions pri-
or to testing may have primed participants, whilst in this study
this was avoided. Further research is required to test such
assertions.
It should be noted that, in the current research, there was no
inclusion of a non- odour condition. That the citrus scent could
have had an independent effect over the alcohol olfactory cue
can thus not be excluded (Smeets and Dijksterhuis 2014).
Further research in this regard may therefore be recommended.
It is also suggested that other scents should be tested in the
future, in order to assess which types of alcohol elicit the greatest
response (c.f. Schneider et al. 2001 on beer). The expansion of
this research beyond a purely student-based sample is also rec-
ommended, given that University students are immersed in a
social, pub-based drinking culture (Borsari and Carey 2001;
Karam et al. 2007; Straus and Bacon 1953). Context-related
cueing may therefore be particularly likely (c.f. Rumelhart and
Todd 1993). It is also advisable that future research test trait
levels of impulsivity during testing, as baseline variability in
impulsiveness between the alcohol and neutral olfactory condi-
tions cannot presently be ruled out. Whilst the random allocation
of participants to olfactory condition reduces this possibility,
such potential does require acknowledgment.
Finally, it is recommended that further research is required
before firmer claims can be made as the effect of alcohol-

 related visual cues on inhibition. This is recommended in light
of two potential limitations of the current research. First, re-
verse instruction blocks were not inserted into the current
GNAT paradigm (i.e. where identical stimuli are assigned as
both go targets or no-go distracters in randomly administered
trials). Whilst recent research has shown little variation in
results when reversed conditions are included within an
alcohol-related GNAT (c.f. Pennington et al. in press), the
exploration of reversed conditions response patterns would
add further weight to the current findings. Specifically, a re-
cent review has suggested that the valence of stimuli can affect
the selection of appropriate or inappropriate actions, with pos-
sible implications for impulsivity and addiction (Guitart-
Masip et al. 2014). Including a reversed condition, where re-
sponses are only made to target stimuli (alcohol-related or
letter K) may therefore have allowed for deductions regarding
whether the effects were primarily due to generalised response
invigoration or inhibitory deficits. Second, there were inherent
variations in task difficulty within the current tasks: In the first
task, the participants must select an alcohol no-go target
among non-alcohol visual distracters. In the second task, they
must select a K-letter no-go target among other letter visual
distracters (a potentially more difficult task). This means that
further research is necessary in order to disentangle the effects
of task difficult and stimuli type on response times, accuracy
and reaction time. Nevertheless, the main finding, that olfac-
tory cues affected such measures, irrespective of visual cues,
is a novel and important research finding worthy of further
consideration.
Overall, this research offers an original insight into the
importance of acknowledging olfactory alcohol cues in devel-
oping a comprehensive understanding of alcohol-related be-
haviour. Context-related reductions in inhibitory control may
lead to increases in consumption, or to relapse in abstinence
users.
