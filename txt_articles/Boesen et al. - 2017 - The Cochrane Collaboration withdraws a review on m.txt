Abstract
A Cochrane systematic review on immediate-release 
methylphenidate for adults with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was withdrawn from 
the Cochrane Library on 26 May 2016 after substantial 
criticism of its methods and flawed conclusions. 
Retraction of scientific papers on this basis is unusual but 
can be necessary. We provide a summary of the criticism 
that led to the withdrawal. We detail the methodological 
flaws of the withdrawn Cochrane systematic review and 
general issues of bias and shortcomings of the included 
ADHD trials: cross-over designs compared with parallel-
group designs, exclusion of participants with psychiatric 
comorbidity, absence of ‘functional outcomes’ and use 
of clinical outcomes with limited relevance, short trial 
duration and small trial populations, broken blinding 
caused by easily recognisable side effects, combining 
outcome assessments by trial investigators and 
participants, outcome reporting bias, poor evaluation 
of cardiovascular and psychiatric harms and conflicts 
of interest of trialists and systematic reviewers. The 
withdrawal of the Cochrane systematic review signals 
recognition of previous unreliable clinical ADHD 
research. We conclude that clinical trials of immediate-
release methylphenidate in adults with ADHD are of very 
low quality. We urgently need well-conducted long-term 
trials free of bias to assess the benefits and harms of 
central stimulant treatment in adult ADHD.
Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults 
is one of the most controversial diagnoses in medicine,1 2 
and the use of methylphenidate is sharply rising.3 The 
Cochrane review by Epstein and colleagues about imme-
diate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD 
from September 20144 was therefore long awaited, 
also because it took 9 
years to appear after the protocol 
was published. However, four research groups inde-
pendently submitted extensive criticisms of the review 
during the period October 2014 to November 2015. Three 
of the four groups coauthored the present paper and 
were in frequent correspondence with the editors and 
eventually Cochrane’s editor-in-chief until the Cochrane 
editorial group decided to withdraw the review in May 
2016.5 They issued a note outlining the reasons for their 
retraction.
“The Editorial Base of the DPLPG (Developmental, 
Psychosocial, and Learning Problems Group) appre-
ciate the feedback received from the contributors named 
below, and their patience with our endeavours to secure 
a response from the author team. These endeavours have 
been persistent, but we were, until recently, unable to 
secure a response from the author team, by which time 
we had received guidance from Cochrane’s Funding 
Arbiter as to how to manage their conflict of interest. 
Subsequently, one of the authors has expressed a wish to 
have his name removed from the review, and we have still 
to hear from a second author. The third author wishes 
to remain an author but given these, and subsequent 
criticisms, together with an unsatisfactory response to 
those criticisms from the author team, we have decided 
to withdraw this review. To make public comments for 
the benefits of readers, we will delay withdrawing the 
review until 26 May 2016".4
The criticisms focused mainly on the review’s flaws 
and misleading conclusions that gave a false sense of 
certainty of the benefits and the absence of harms, when 
in fact this could not be concluded. Fundamental meth-
odological problems in the included trials that were not 
addressed in the review were also highlighted in the 
criticisms.4 The withdrawn Cochrane review reflects 
in many ways a general inadequacy of clinical ADHD 
research,6–8 but the review authors failed to point out 
important flaws in the included trials. We provide here a 
summary of the criticism and discuss the consequences 
of the withdrawal.
The confidence in the evidence
Using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach,9 
the review authors expressed ‘high’ confidence in the 
evidence for most outcomes, despite the fact that most 
domains in Cochrane’s Risk of Bias assessment for the 
included trials were labelled as ‘unclear’. Furthermore, 
there was very high heterogeneity between results from 
the individual trials for ADHD symptoms (between 76% 
and 88%; the maximum is 100%), and the estimates 
were very imprecise. The confidence in the evidence 
should therefore have been ‘very low’. The authors did 
not explore the reasons for the heterogeneity, except 
for a subgroup analysis that compared low versus high 
dosage methylphenidate, arguing that they had too 
few studies for meta-regression. However, reasons for 
substantial heterogeneity should always be explored.
Cross-over studies
Nine of the included 11 trials had a cross-over design. 
The cross-over design is questionable to use in trials of 
central stimulants (such as methylphenidate or amphet-
amine) due to the risk of carry-over effects.10 It also 
increases the risk of unblinding and is therefore more 
susceptible to expectancy effects (see also Lack of

blinding). According to the Cochrane Handbook,11 cross-
over studies may be used for ‘stable’ conditions where 
‘long-term follow-up is not required’, neither of which 
is the case for ADHD treatment. A previous meta-anal-
ysis that included trials of stimulants for adults with 
ADHD showed larger effects in cross-over studies than 
in parallel-group trials.12 The failures to consider such 
fundamental elements of the trial design and explore its 
importance in sensitivity analyses raise major concern.
Psychiatric comorbidity
Most adults with ADHD suffer from psychiatric comor-
bidity, primarily anxiety and depression,13 and the 
exclusion of such participants from the trials greatly 
impairs their external validity.14 Only 2 of the 11 trials 
explicitly did not exclude participants with psychiatric 
comorbidity; 5 trials excluded them, and it was unclear 
in 4 trials. The review paid no attention to this, which 
should have led to a downgrading for ‘indirectness’ 
according to GRADE.9 Downgrading for indirectness 
should be applied when the trial conditions (population, 
intervention, outcome measures) differ considerably 
from clinical practice.
‘Functional’ outcomes
The authors acknowledged the negative impact of 
ADHD on ‘functional outcomes’, such as frequency of 
job change, work performance, traffic accidents, marital 
status and academic achievements. Yet, the treatment 
effect on functional outcomes was not quantified in the 
review, although these outcomes are arguably the most 
important ones. None of the included trials reported data 
on these outcomes specifically, but this should have been 
highlighted in the review as an important limitation.
Trial duration
The trials lasted only 1–7 
weeks, and the long-term 
beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate are 
therefore unknown. Most adults with ADHD receive 
methylphenidate for substantially longer periods,15 and 
the beneficial effects may furthermore diminish over 
time. This was observed in the large Multimodal Treat-
ment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Study 
in children.7 16–18 The short trial duration should there-
fore have led to additional downgrading for indirectness 
according to GRADE.9
Small trials
The total sample size in the review was only 474 partic-
ipants, and the trial median was only 30. Small trials 
are underpowered to detect clinically relevant effects, 
and their results are generally misleading,19 particularly 
when they are biased, as is the case here. Furthermore, 
small trials cannot detect rare harms of drugs, a very 
important issue that was not mentioned in the review.4
Lack of blinding
Maintaining blinding in trials of central stimulant drugs 
with characteristic detectable (and for some people) 
pleasurable effects and also characteristic adverse effects 
is very unlikely without the use of an active placebo. 
This important issue was not considered in the review. 
Furthermore, 9 of the 11 studies used a titration scheme 
to achieve the highest tolerated dose, which virtually 
excludes the possibility that blinding was effective. Still, 
the trials were described as ‘double-blind’, and this was 
accepted by the review authors, the peer reviewers and 
the editors. The included trials did not formally assess 
whether the blinding was effective, but one trial20 
reported that all eight participants were able to guess 
their allocation. The inherent problem of maintaining 
blinded conditions in trials of central stimulants for 
ADHD was highlighted in the Cochrane reviews of meth-
ylphenidate for children with ADHD7 and of amphet-
amines for adults with ADHD.6
Pooling investigator-rated and self-rated ADHD 
symptom scores
The review reported the combined effect size for self-
rated and investigator-rated ADHD symptom scores, 
where the latter was preferred when both were reported 
in the same study. However, previous meta-analyses 
have demonstrated substantial differences, with inves-
tigators estimating higher effects.12 21 Obviously, the 
participants’ perception of the effect is more important 
than that of the investigator. It has been argued that the 
investigator is more ‘useful’ to detect changes in ADHD 
behaviour,12 but investigators may simply be more biased 
than participants in trials that have not been adequately 
blinded even though the detectable effects of central 
stimulants may bias the participants’ assessments. It is 
essential that both participant and investigator ratings 
are analysed and reported separately.
Outcome reporting bias
The authors of the retracted review wrote that prestated 
outcomes were reported in most studies and therefore 
judged the risk of outcome reporting bias as ‘low’.4 
However, in direct contradiction to this, they wrote 
in the abstract that “We were unable to determine 
whether adverse effects were not discussed by study 
authors because none occurred or because no data on 
adverse effects were collected”.4 They also noted that 
this prevented them from conducting meta-analyses of 
adverse events and concluded that “Trial data suggest 
that adverse effects from immediate-release methylphe-
nidate for adults with ADHD are not of serious clinical 
significance, although this conclusion may be limited, 
certainly in the case of weight loss, by the short duration 
of published studies”.4 It is misleading to conclude that 
trial data suggest that adverse effects are not of ‘serious 
clinical significance’ when important data are not avail-
able and follow-up is very short. The risk of outcome 
reporting bias in the included trials, most evident for the 
adverse events data, should have been stated clearly in 
the review.
Outcome reporting bias is not limited to old trials 
of immediate-release methylphenidate. We have pointed 
out22 that the most recent trial of extended-release 
methylphenidate from 201523 failed to report and specify 
crucial outcomes such as adverse events and quality 
of life.22 In addition, ‘absence from work’ and long-
term outcomes after 2.5 years were omitted from the 
 
publication.

Methods
Cardiovascular and psychiatric harms
The cardiovascular harms of stimulants have long been 
in focus.24 The review authors narratively described 
the cardiovascular effects in five studies, but they did 
not conduct meta-analyses for pulse or blood pressure 
changes, which are the only meaningful cardiovascular 
surrogate outcomes in small, short-term trials. Three of 
those five trials reported data for such an analysis. Stim-
ulants increase blood pressure and pulse in adults25 and 
may increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease beyond 
the short follow-up period of the trials, particularly 
in adults, where many have additional risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. In children and adolescents with 
ADHD, there is an increased risk of arrhythmias and 
myocardial infarction during the initial phase of meth-
ylphenidate treatment,26 and the risk of cardiovascular 
events with different levels of severity is doubled in 
stimulant users compared with non-users.27 The risk of 
developing psychiatric adverse events such as psychosis, 
mania and aggression was not mentioned in the review,4 
although a large Canadian population-based study28 and 
an FDA review29 30 found that ADHD drug use, including 
methylphenidate, was associated with such events in 
children and adolescents.
Comparison with other research
The review authors compared their results with those of 
three meta-analyses but not with three newer system-
atic reviews,12 31 32 nor with a comprehensive drug class 
review.33 These omissions are problematic as these 
reviews reported different effect sizes, considered several 
of the methodological limitations that we have outlined 
above and conducted subgroup and meta-regression 
analyses that Epstein and colleagues did not.4 The drug 
class review33 even abstained from doing meta-analyses 
as the authors considered the trials to be too unreliable.
Conflicts of interests
We believe that the trialists’ conflicts of interests should 
have been discussed in the review. Only 2 of the 11 trials 
were explicitly funded by the drug industry, whereas 2 
were unclear about this. Yet, two trials34 35 (one publicly 
funded35 and one with no declaration of funding34) were 
authored by three psychiatrists, which were investigated 
by US Senator Grassley in 2008 for financial ties to the 
pharmaceutical industry.36 The investigation revealed 
that each researcher had received millions of dollars 
from the drug industry without disclosing it.36 Two of 
the three authors of the Cochrane review declared finan-
cial conflicts of interests.4 It is very likely that authors of 
systematic reviews with conflicts of interests are influ-
enced in the same way as trialists are.11 We believe that 
the Cochrane Collaboration should introduce a policy 
that does not allow any financial conflicts of interest for 
review authors.
Discussion
The withdrawal sends a strong message to the field of 
clinical ADHD research and about the trustworthiness 
of the Cochrane Library. The decision to withdraw the 
review also provides indirect support to the Cochrane 
review on methylphenidate for children with ADHD, 
whose authors emphasised the ‘very low’ confidence 
they had in the evidence.7 This main conclusion has 
been criticised by the European Network for Hyper-
kinetic Disorders (EUNETHYDIS), a group of ADHD 
researchers. EUNETHYDIS has worked hard to discredit 
the Cochrane review of children37–43 by publishing virtu-
ally the same criticisms in several papers in their own 
journals,37 38 41 43 despite the fact that their criticisms 
have been refuted repeatedly by the Cochrane review 
authors.7 44–49 EUNETHYDIS seems to defend a certain 
opinion rather than to consider the many flaws and low 
quality of the data outlined here and in the review of 
children.7 A systematic review on atomoxetine for adults 
with ADHD50 concluded that the harms of treatment 
probably outweighed the benefits, but it was criticised 
in a similar manner by, among others, employees of Eli 
Lilly, the manufacturer of atomoxetine.51 52
Scientific papers are rarely retracted, even when 
they are seriously flawed. Outright fraud is a reason for 
retraction, but even then it can take many years before 
retraction,53 if it ever occurs. A policy of retracting 
papers that mislead readers importantly, with serious 
consequences for patients' and public health, should be 
introduced. Such initiatives could be taken by organi-
sations like the World Association of Medical Editors or 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. 
Appropriate measures should be taken, however, to 
avoid such policy being misused to get critical papers 
retracted.
The Cochrane editors should be praised that they 
made the difficult choice to retract the misleading 
Cochrane review, although we also note that it took 
19 months from the first critical comments were 
submitted in October 2014 until these were published4 
alongside the withdrawal in May 2016.5 During this 
time, the review was cited in influential publications 
such as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technol-
ogies in Health’s review of high-dose stimulants for 
ADHD;54 it was summarised in a ‘Cochrane for Clini-
cians’ article in the American Family Physician;55 and 
a recent JAMA editorial referred to the now withdrawn 
review in support of the view that methylphenidate trials 
are of high quality.56 We urge Cochrane editors to speed 
up communications with readers and to introduce func-
tions similar to the rapid responses in the BMJ or the 
response function in PubMed Commons as soon as it is 
technically possible.
Conclusions
The withdrawal of the Cochrane review on immedi-
ate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD 
was an important decision that underlines the fact that 
ADHD drug trials are unreliable. It is time to start doing 
them right, and we hope that the criticism we have listed 
above may serve as a checklist for future trials and also 
for systematic reviews of trials of central stimulants.
