ABSTRACT
Breakfast is thought to be beneficial for cognitive and academic performance in school children. However, breakfast is the most
frequently skipped meal, especially among adolescents. The aim of the current article was to systematically review the evidence from
intervention studies for the effects of breakfast on cognitive performance in children and adolescents. The effects of breakfast were
evaluated by cognitive domain and breakfast manipulation. A total of 45 studies reported in 43 articles were included in the review. Most
studies considered the acute effect of a single breakfast (n = 34). The acute studies looked at breakfast compared with no breakfast (n =
24) and/or comparisons of breakfast type (n = 15). The effects of chronic school breakfast program interventions were evaluated in 11
studies. The findings suggest that breakfast consumption relative to fasting has a short-term (same morning) positive domain-specific
effect on cognition. Tasks requiring attention, executive function, and memory were facilitated more reliably by breakfast consumption
relative to fasting, with effects more apparent in undernourished children. Firm conclusions cannot be made about the acute effects of
breakfast composition and the effects of chronic breakfast interventions because there are too few studies and these largely report
inconsistent findings. This review also highlights methodologic limitations of the existing research. These include a lack of research on
adolescents, few naturalistic breakfast manipulations or testing environments, small samples, and insensitive cognitive tests. Adv Nutr

Introduction
Breakfast is generally accepted to be the most important
meal of the day and is purported to confer a number of
benefits for diet quality, health, and cognitive and academic
performance. Children and adolescents who habitually
consume breakfast are more likely to have better micro-
and macronutrient intake (1), less likely to be overweight
or obese (2, 3), and more likely to have higher physical
activity levels (4). Despite the wealth of benefits, several
observational studies have reported that between 20%
and 30% of children and adolescents skip breakfast (1, 5,
6).
There is also evidence that breakfast consumption is ben-
eficial for cognitive performance in school children (7).
Children and adolescents may be particularly sensitive to
the nutritional effects of breakfast on brain activity and as-
sociated cognitive outcomes. Children have a higher brain
glucose metabolism than do adults (8). Moreover, the longer
overnight fasting period because of higher sleep demands
during childhood and adolescence can deplete glycogen
stores overnight (9). To maintain this higher metabolic
rate, a continuous supply of energy derived from glucose
is needed. Hence breakfast consumption may be vital to pro-
viding adequate energy for the morning.
Although a number of published reviews have examined
the effect of breakfast on school children’s cognitive perfor-
mance (7, 10–12), only one is systematic (7). The applica-
tion of systematic review methodology limits bias and
improves the reliability and accuracy of conclusions. The

 aim of the current review was to provide an updated system-
atic review of the evidence for the effects of breakfast on ob-
jective cognitive performance outcomes from intervention
studies in both children and adolescents. The current sys-
tematic review extends the published systematic review (7)
by highlighting the cognitive domains that are potentially
more sensitive to the effects of breakfast consumption. The
effects of breakfast were evaluated by cognitive domain
and type of breakfast manipulation. The acute effects of
breakfast compared with no breakfast, breakfast composi-
tion, and the chronic effects of school breakfast programs
(SBPs)4 were considered. The cognitive tasks were grouped
into 5 broad categories: memory, attention, executive
function, psychomotor function, and language (13).
Methods
Search strategy and search terms
The databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, and Web of
Science for articles published between 1950 and July 2014. The search terms
are shown in Table 1.
The reference lists of existing articles were examined individually to
supplement the electronic search.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
This review was limited to articles published in English in peer-reviewed
journals. Papers were included or excluded in this review by using the fol-
lowing criteria.
Participants. Studies of children or adolescents (4–18-y-old) of either sex
were included. All studies that used adult or elderly samples were excluded.
Studies were also excluded if they contained patient samples (e.g., those
with type 1 or 2 diabetes).
Manipulations. Studies that included any type of breakfast manipulation
were included (e.g., breakfast compared with no breakfast, different
breakfast types, and SBPs). Studies of the effects of manipulations at other
mealtimes were excluded. Breakfast was defined according to the defini-
tion applied within the studies reviewed. Generally, studies defined break-
fast as the first food or meal consumed in the day. However, most studies
did not include a controlled overnight fasting period. Studies were not ex-
cluded on the basis of the content of the meal. For example, studies that
included breakfast manipulations with the use of drinks and/or snacks
were included and studies that did not report breakfast composition
were included.
Outcome measures. Studies that included any outcome of objectively mea-
sured cognitive performance were included.
Design. Intervention studies examining acute effects (temporary effects oc-
curring shortly after breakfast consumption) and chronic effects (effects
occurring after the repeated consumption of breakfast) of breakfast
manipulations were included. Observational studies examining associations
between habitual breakfast consumption and cognitive performance were
excluded.
Study selection process
The process for selecting studies for inclusion in this review is detailed in
Figure 1. A total of 45 studies reported in 43 articles were included (2 arti-
cles reported >1 study)
Data extraction and tabulation of studies
The following data were extracted from each included study by 2 reviewers:
1) author and year; 2) study design; 3) characteristics of participants; 4) de-
tails of the breakfast intervention; 5) details of the cognitive measures; and
6) findings. A summary of the findings is shown in Tables 2–4. A summary
of the characteristics of each study is shown in Tables 5 and 6. The findings
are discussed by cognitive domain and type of breakfast manipulation
(acute or chronic) and comparison (breakfast compared with no breakfast
or breakfast composition).
Assessment of strength of evidence
A grading of the strength of evidence for each conclusion was made with the
use of the grade definitions in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Ev-
idence Analysis Manual (57).
Results
Summary of studies and their characteristics
Thirty-four studies considered the acute effect of a single
breakfast meal in which performance was typically assessed
within 4 h postingestion. These studies were further cate-
gorized into those using breakfast compared with no
breakfast (n = 24) and/or comparisons of breakfast
type (n = 15). Five studies examining the effect of breakfast
compared with no breakfast also included comparisons of
breakfast type (n = 5). The effect of chronic breakfast inter-
ventions on cognition was evaluated in 11 studies. Chronic
intervention studies were all evaluations of breakfast provi-
sion at school as SBPs and were all comparisons of SBP and
no SBP.
In the 15 acute intervention studies that compared differ-
ent breakfast types or size, 7 were comparisons of the glyce-
mic index (GI) or glycemic load (GL) of breakfast meals. An
additional 4 studies did not explicitly compare the GI or GL
of different breakfast meals, but the macronutrient compo-
sition differed across conditions such that the effects were
described in terms of differences in glycemic response.
The remaining studies were comparisons of high carbohy-
drate and high protein (2 studies) or comparisons of break-
fasts differing in energy (2 studies).
The breakfast manipulations were varied, but a common-
ality was the use of foods or meals that were carbohydrate-
rich. Most studies included ready-to-eat cereals or breads in
combination with other foods, including milk, sweet and
fat spreads, fruit, fruit juice, yogurt, and cheese. The mac-
ronutrient composition of the test meals varied widely
between the studies. The energy loads of the breakfast

 manipulations were also wide-ranging, from 95 to 600 kcal
(mean: 225 kcal). In acute intervention studies, the breakfast
manipulations were typically fixed rather than ad libitum. In
chronic intervention studies, meals were always ad libitum.
Studies were conducted in participants aged 3–20 y, but
most studies included children aged 6–11 y (28 studies)
with adolescent samples less frequent (10 studies). Two
studies included young preschool-aged children (3–6 y).
Seven studies included undernourished children. Most stud-
ies were carried out in well-nourished children of both sexes.
Most acute studies used crossover designs (74%; 25 of 34
studies), of which 20 were randomized and 5 were non-
randomized, but order of treatment was counterbalanced.
Eight studies used parallel-group designs, of which 7 were
randomized. Control groups were usually fasting, but
some studies attempted to include placebo controls such
as very-low-energy conditions. These are not true place-
bos, but they may account for the extra attention given
to children during breakfast provision. Of the 11 chronic
studies, 5 were nonrandomized matched school compari-
son studies, 1 was a nonrandomized matched participant
comparison study, 4 were randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), and the remaining study was a before-and-after
study. Control conditions usually included breakfast at
home or no breakfast, depending on participants’ usual
habitual breakfast intake.
A wide variety of cognitive tasks were used. Attention and
memory were the most frequently assessed cognitive do-
mains. Typically, the acute studies used a battery of
cognitive tasks to measure multiple domains. Studies also
often administered more than one measure within the
same domain. Hence, a single study could show positive,
negative, and equivocal findings. The multiple outcomes
from these studies are reflected by multiple entries in Tables
2–4. Within the acute studies, the temporal distribution of
the cognitive tasks across the morning was variable and
ranged from >10 min to $210 min postbreakfast. Some
studies (38%; 13 of 34 studies) tracked postintervention per-
formance across the morning usually shortly after breakfast
(e.g., >60 min), in the midmorning (e.g., $120–180 min),
and in the late morning (e.g., $210 min). However, many
acute studies (62%; 21 of 34 studies) included only one post-
intervention testing period. Furthermore, 25 studies did not
include a baseline (pretreatment) test session. In chronic
studies, assessment of cognitive function was commonly as-
sessed at one follow-up period after an intervention dura-
tion ranging from 1 mo to 3 school years.
Attention
Thirty-eight studies included measures of attention.
Acute intervention studies: Effects of breakfast compared
with no breakfast. Twenty-one acute studies examining at-
tention included breakfast and no breakfast conditions (Ta-
bles 2 and 5). Thirteen studies demonstrated a positive effect
from breakfast, of which 8 were in well-nourished children
and adolescents (18, 20–22, 30, 31, 40, 44). However, of the
studies reporting positive effects, 5 of 13 studies (38%) dem-
onstrated effects only in a specific subgroup of the sample
under study (14, 24, 38, 39, 41). For example, positive effects
of breakfast on attention were confined to male participants
(14), participants with an intelligence quotient below the
median of the sample (38, 39), and undernourished children
(24, 41). Furthermore, 3 studies reported negative effects
from breakfast in a specific subgroup of the sample under
study (14, 24, 41). For example, the negative effects of
breakfast consumption on attention were confined to well-
nourished children (24, 41) and female participants (14).
Fourteen studies reported equivocal findings on atten-
tion outcomes, of which 4 of 14 studies (29%) were in
well-nourished adolescents (23, 25, 26, 45), 7 of 14 studies
(50%) were in younger well-nourished children (18, 28,
31, 38–40) and 3 of 14 studies (21%) were in undernour-
ished children (19, 24, 29). However, one study observed a
ceiling level of performance on the attention task, which
may account for the null effects (23). Moreover, one study

 assigned participants to a condition based on habitual
breakfast intake, which is an obvious bias (29).
Acute intervention studies: Effects of different breakfast
types. Comparisons of the effects of different breakfast types
on attention were made in 14 studies (Tables 3 and 5). Nine
studies were comparisons of the GI or GL of breakfast meals
or foods, of which 6 of 9 studies (67%) demonstrated an ad-
vantage for lower-GI or -GL breakfast meals or foods (15,
22, 27, 31, 44). However, lower-GI conditions were not al-
ways classified as low GI (e.g., GI value # 55). For example,
one study reported that consumption of 2 types of ready-to-
eat cereal (GI ;74) (58) reduced the decline in attention
across the morning relative to a glucose drink (GI 100)
(44). In addition, conditions were not isocaloric in 3 studies
(15, 27, 44). Furthermore, 4 studies demonstrated no effect
from breakfast GI or GL on attention (16, 17, 31), and 1 study
observed that both high-GI–low-GL and high-GI–high-GL
breakfast meals were associated with better attention (32).
The remaining 5 studies compared high protein and high
carbohydrate breakfasts or breakfasts that differed in size
and/or provision of a midmorning snack. One study re-
ported that consumption of a high carbohydrate breakfast
impaired attention relative to a high protein breakfast
(14). However, the effects were specific to female participants,
and one study found no effect from a high-carbohydrate
compared with high-protein breakfast on attention (34).
There was no effect from breakfast size or midmorning
snack consumption on attention in 2 studies (35, 46). How-
ever, one study reported that attention was worse after
consumption of a higher-energy breakfast relative to habit-
ual breakfast consumption (33).
Chronic intervention studies: Effects of SBPs. Eight
chronic SBP studies measured attention (Tables 4 and 6).
Four studies showed an advantage for SBPs on attention,
with effects demonstrable after an intervention period of
1 mo to 3 y (54–56). Of the studies reporting positive effects,
1 of 4 studies (25%) was an RCT, but the trial suffered sub-
stantial contamination between treatment arms such that
77% of the children in the control arm had an SBP operating
at their school (55). Seven chronic studies demonstrated
equivocal findings for attention in well- and undernour-
ished children (47–49, 52, 54, 56).
Memory
Twenty-eight studies took measures of memory.
Acute intervention studies: Effects of breakfast compared
with no breakfast. Comparisons of breakfast and no break-
fast were made in 15 acute studies (Tables 2 and 5). An ad-
vantage for breakfast on memory was demonstrated in 8
studies in well-nourished children and adolescents (25, 31,
38, 40, 43–45). However, positive effects were only apparent
under conditions of greater cognitive load in 1 of 8 studies
(13%) (25), and positive effects were specific to male partic-
ipants in 1 of 8 studies (13%) (45).
Nine studies reported no effect from breakfast compared
with no breakfast on memory in well- and undernourished
children and adolescents (14, 18, 23, 28, 30, 31, 41, 45).
Moreover, 3 studies reported that memory was superior un-
der fasting conditions (30, 38, 39).
Acute intervention studies: Effects of different breakfast
types. Twelve studies investigated the effect of breakfast
composition on memory (Tables 3 and 5). Nine studies
were comparisons of the GI or GL of breakfast meals or
foods, which demonstrated varied results. Four studies re-
ported an advantage of lower-GI or -GL breakfasts for mem-
ory (15, 17, 27, 44), of which 1 of 4 (25%) studies
demonstrated a lower-GI breakfast facilitation effect in girls
only (17), 2 of 4 studies (50%) demonstrated a positive ef-
fect of a high-GI breakfast compared with a very high–GI

 breakfast (17, 44), and 3 of 4 studies (75%) did not include
isocaloric conditions (15, 27, 44). Five studies demonstrated
no effect from breakfasts differing in GI or GL on memory
(15, 16, 31, 32). One study demonstrated an advantage of a
high-GI relative to a low-GI breakfast for memory (42).
The remaining 3 studies compared high-protein and
high-carbohydrate breakfasts or breakfasts which differed
in size and/or a midmorning snack. One study reported
no effect from 2 isocaloric breakfasts that were either high
carbohydrate or high protein and matched for fat (14). One
study observed that memory was better after consumption of
a higher-energy breakfast relative to habitual breakfast (33).
One study showed that the decline in memory across the morn-
ing was reduced by consumption of a midmorning snack (35).
Chronic intervention studies: Effects of SBPs. Five chronic
intervention studies measured memory (Tables 4 and 6).
Only one study showed a positive effect from a chronic
breakfast intervention on memory, an effect that was specific
to schools with more poverty, undernourished children, and
lower achievement (47). Four studies found no effect from
SBPs on memory in well- and undernourished children
(50–52, 56), of which 2 of the 4 studies (50%) reported
data from the same RCT (50, 51).
Executive function
Nineteen studies included tests of executive function.
Acute intervention studies: Effects of breakfast compared
with no breakfast. Thirteen acute studies examined execu-
tive function after breakfast and no breakfast (see Tables 2
and 5). A positive effect from breakfast on executive func-
tion was demonstrated in 7 studies in children and adoles-
cents (20–22, 24, 25, 36, 37), of which 3 of the 7 studies
(43%) demonstrated effects under conditions of varying
cognitive load (21, 22, 25) and 1 of the 7 studies (14%) dem-
onstrated positive effects in undernourished children only
(24). Eight studies showed equivalence for this domain (14,
22, 24–26, 28, 29, 44). Furthermore, 1 study reported that ex-
ecutive function was better under fasting conditions; however,
effects were specific to well-nourished children only (41).
Acute intervention studies: Effects of different breakfast
types. Five studies investigated the effect of different types
of breakfasts on executive function (Tables 3 and 5). Most
studies [4 of 5 studies (80%)] were comparisons of break-
fasts differing in GI or GL, which demonstrated mixed
results on executive function. Two studies showed an ad-
vantage from higher-GI or -GL breakfasts (23, 33), 1 study
showed an advantage of lower-GI or -GL breakfasts (23),
and 3 studies showed no effect of breakfast GI or GL (27,
32, 44). The remaining study found no effect from a high-
carbohydrate compared with a high-protein breakfast on ex-
ecutive function (14).
Chronic intervention studies: Effects of SBPs. Four
chronic intervention studies measured executive function
(Tables 4 and 6). Two studies observed a positive effect of
SBPs on executive function (52, 53). However, positive ef-
fects were only apparent in specific trials of the task (52)
or in male participants (53). Two studies found no effect
from SBPs on executive function (49, 56).
Psychomotor function
Measures of motor control and coordination were used in 8
studies.
Acute intervention studies: Effects of breakfast compared
with no breakfast. Four acute studies measured psychomo-
tor function after breakfast and no breakfast conditions (Ta-
bles 2 and 5). Two studies showed an advantage of breakfast
for psychomotor function (31). However, 2 studies showed
equivalence (18, 28). Moreover, 1 study found that psycho-
motor function was better under fasting conditions, an ef-
fect that was specific to female participants (31).
Acute intervention studies: Effects of different breakfast
types. Three acute studies found no effect from different
breakfast types on psychomotor function (31, 35) (Tables
3 and 5).
Chronic intervention studies: Effects of SBPs. There were
3 chronic intervention studies (Tables 4 and 6). Two chronic
studies showed positive effects on psychomotor outcomes
after a 6 wk SBP (56). However, one study found no effect
from an 8 mo SBP compared with no SBP on psychomotor
function (49).
Language
Measures of language ability were used in 6 acute studies.
Acute intervention studies: Effects of breakfast compared
with no breakfast. Four studies examined the acute effect of
breakfast compared with no breakfast on language ability
(Tables 2 and 5). An advantage for breakfast on language
was demonstrated in 2 studies, both of which showed that
effects were specific to undernourished children only (19,
41). One study reported that performance on a vocabulary
test was better under fasting conditions in well-nourished
children, an effect that was not observed in undernourished
children (24). One study demonstrated no effect from break-
fast on a vocabulary test in well-nourished children (38).
Acute intervention studies: Effects of different breakfast
types. Two studies investigated the effect of breakfast com-
position on language (Tables 3 and 5). The effects of both
breakfast GI and GL on language were examined by 1 study
(32). The 4 breakfast conditions include low GI–high GL,
high GI–high GL, low GI–low GL, and high GI–low GL. Ver-
bal fluency was significantly improved after consumption of
the low GI compared with the high-GI breakfast, which was
consistent across high- and low-GL conditions. One study
showed that breakfast energy intake did not affect verbal flu-
ency (46).

 Discussion
Principal findings
The present review indicates that breakfast consumption has
a transient beneficial effect on cognitive function measured
within 4 h postingestion compared with breakfast omission.
There was also some evidence that the advantageous effects
on cognition of breakfast compared with fasting may be
more apparent in undernourished children. It is more diffi-
cult to make conclusions about the acute effects of breakfast
composition and the chronic effects of SBPs, because there
are fewer studies, and these largely report inconsistent find-
ings. Particularly, SBPs seem to have limited effects on cog-
nitive outcomes, but this may be partly attributed to the
difficulties in executing these typically large, pragmatic
trials. Furthermore, SBP studies tended to use one cognitive
measure, whereas acute studies tended to use a battery of
tasks and therefore increase the likelihood of finding effects.
Effect of breakfast on specific cognitive domains. The
findings indicate that breakfast-induced cognitive effects are
domain-specific. Tasks that required attention, executive func-
tion, and memory were facilitated more reliably by breakfast
consumption relative to fasting. In acute studies that compared
breakfast type, a low-GI breakfast (see information in the sec-
tion on breakfast composition and cognitive performance)
was most consistently associated with positive effects on
attention. There were also instances in which effects were
specific to certain variables within tasks, although the weight
of the evidence was insufficient to draw firm conclusions.
Although the findings suggest that there are domain-
specific effects on cognition from breakfast consumption
compared with fasting, it should be acknowledged that
cognitive functions are not discrete; they overlap. Further-
more, the categorization of certain cognitive tasks to a spe-
cific cognitive domain is not consistent.
The timing of the effects of breakfast on cognition across
the morning. Within acute studies, positive effects were
noted at many time points across the morning from imme-
diately postingestion ($10 min) to late morning ($210 min).
However, effects of breakfast consumption relative to fasting
appeared most commonly in the mid-late morning (;180
min postbreakfast). This may be when performance decre-
ments in fasted conditions become apparent, allowing for
greater discrimination between conditions. In the studies
that tracked performance across the morning with multiple
testing sessions, performance often declined across the
morning from baseline. However, breakfast consumption
functioned to reduce this decline in performance rather
than enhance performance above baseline levels.
Breakfast composition and cognitive performance. Firm
conclusions cannot be made regarding the acute effects of
breakfast composition. In acute intervention studies com-
paring breakfast to breakfast omission, effects were demon-
strated across a range of breakfast manipulations and energy
loads, suggesting that breakfast composition may be unrelated
to cognition. There are fewer studies comparing breakfast type
than there are those that compare breakfast with no breakfast,
and these demonstrate inconsistent findings. Within the
limited data comparing breakfast type, the evidence gener-
ally suggested that lower-GI breakfasts may facilitate cogni-
tion relative to higher-GI breakfasts. This suggests that
breakfast foods or meals that elicit a glycemic response char-
acterized by less oscillating glucose concentrations and a
sustained blood glucose concentration above fasting concen-
trations may facilitate cognitive function. This also suggests
that the postprandial blood glucose profile may mediate the
effects of breakfast on cognitive performance. However,
concomitant blood glucose measures were not always
taken in studies that reported such effects (27, 44). Further-
more, in studies that used continuous blood glucose moni-
toring, the evidence indicated that large differences in
postprandial glycemic responses elicited by high- and low-
GL conditions were apparent in the absence of any cognitive
performance effects (16). Moreover, some evidence indi-
cated that cognitive effects were apparent when postprandial
blood glucose concentrations had returned to baseline.
These temporal relations suggest that other factors associ-
ated with ingestion of these low-GI breakfast meals, rather
than glucose response per se, may mediate the effects on cog-
nitive performance. Alternatively, cognitive performance
could be related to blood glucose concentrations, but not in
a tightly, temporally coupled manner.
Methodologic considerations and strength of
evidence
A grading of the strength of evidence is shown in Table 7.
Quality. The quality of the acute studies comparing break-
fast with no breakfast or composition was graded as fair and
limited, respectively (Grade II and III; Table 7). The quality
of chronic intervention studies was graded as limited (Grade
III; Table 7). Overall, acute intervention studies comparing
breakfast and no breakfast had minor methodologic con-
cerns. For example, compliance to the breakfast manipula-
tion in terms of the amount consumed was rarely reported.
Compliance to the fasting requirements before and after
breakfast or no breakfast also was not always reported. Fur-
thermore, evening food intake typically was not reported or
controlled for. However, 8 acute laboratory studies did in-
clude an overnight stay and hence a monitored overnight
fasting period. A further limitation was that the cognitive
tests used often were not selected on the basis of their capac-
ity to differentiate subtle differences in cognitive perfor-
mance after nutritional manipulations. The evidence from
acute breakfast type comparisons was more limited because
breakfast conditions often differed in other characteristics
that were not intended to be manipulated.
The quality of evidence from chronic SBP studies was
graded as limited. In SBP studies, food consumed before
school was not recorded in both conditions and fasting re-
quirements were not prescribed. Hence, participants under
the non-SBP conditions could have consumed breakfast
608S

 and also possibly caffeine as part of breakfast at home. Fur-
thermore, compliance with the intervention in terms of
whether or not the SBP breakfast was actually consumed
was often not stated. Rather, studies usually described com-
pliance in terms of attendance rates. Hence, these compar-
isons are more strictly a test of the SBP regimen rather than
breakfast per se. Furthermore, these studies reported prob-
lems with contamination between treatment arms or poor
compliance (51, 55).
Consistency. The consistency of evidence from acute inter-
vention studies comparing breakfast and no breakfast was
graded as fair (Grade II; Table 7). However, the findings of
domain-specific effects of breakfast should be interpreted
cautiously, because significant positive findings for a partic-
ular cognitive domain in some studies were coupled with
null effects in other studies. Moreover, when positive effects
occurred, there were instances in which effects were appar-
ent only under specific conditions, such as more difficult
trials of the task, or in a specific subgroup of the sample un-
der study (e.g., often undernourished children). The failure
to detect an effect in some studies but not others may be a
result of true lack of effect. However, it may be because of
task insensitivity (59). Another factor that may account
for the inconsistent findings is the evidence for enhance-
ment effects on specific variables within tasks. For example,
some studies suggested that enhancement effects of break-
fast on reaction-time tasks are specific to response times
rather than accuracy, with other studies showing the reverse
pattern. Therefore, a limited analysis of outcomes (e.g., only
accuracy) may result in null findings. Finally, the large meth-
odologic variation between studies also may have contrib-
uted to the inconsistent findings. The variable findings for
particular cognitive domains should also be interpreted in
conjunction with an appreciation of the imbalance of re-
search effort across cognitive domains.
The possibility of publication bias should also be ac-
knowledged in relation to the consistency of findings. This
review included only published studies. Consequently, a
publication bias cannot be excluded. In addition, many of
the included studies were funded by a breakfast cereal man-
ufacturer, including this review. Industry funding has been
reported to bias conclusions in favor of the sponsor’s pro-
ducts (60). This may have increased the prevalence of the
published positive effects of breakfast.
The consistency of evidence from acute studies compar-
ing breakfast type and chronic SBP interventions was lim-
ited (Grade III; Table 7). Hence, there is insufficient
evidence to support a consistent effect from SBPs or break-
fast type on cognitive performance.
Quantity. Forty-five studies is a reasonable body of evi-
dence. However, most studies are acute, and comparisons
with no breakfast, providing a good quantity of studies for
this conclusion (Grade I; Table 7). However the number
of acute breakfast composition studies and chronic studies
is relatively low, providing a limited quantity of studies for
conclusions (Grade III; Table 7).

 Clinical impact. The clinical impact of the findings from all
studies was fair to limited (Grade II–III; Table 7). The results
did not show large breakfast-induced benefits for cognitive
performance. The evidence demonstrated that the effects
of breakfast consumption on cognitive performance are
likely to be subtle, and demonstrable only under specific
conditions or in particular subgroups of the samples. The
functions assessed could have some wider impact on learn-
ing in the classroom and educational achievement. However,
objective cognitive tests may not be relevant to a “real world”
classroom situation.
Generalizability. The generalizability of the findings from
acute intervention studies was limited (Grade III; Table 7).
Many acute studies lacked large representative samples. In
addition, children aged 6–10 y were overrepresented. There
was also a lack of acute studies using naturalistic breakfast
manipulations and contexts, which prevented generaliza-
tion to “real-life” situations. In acute intervention stud-
ies, the breakfast manipulations were typically fixed rather
than ad libitum. Ad libitum breakfast manipulations allow
participants to choose a breakfast that is palatable and suit-
able for them in terms of portion size. This should therefore
better reflect the participants’ usual eating habits. This is also
important given that deviation from habitual intake can ad-
versely affect cognitive performance (61). Furthermore, many
acute studies were laboratory-based. School-based studies
have the advantage of aligning with the participants’ normal
environment and daily routine, providing ecologically valid
evidence. In contrast, chronic SBP studies often included
much larger samples, more naturalistic breakfast interven-
tions, and settings providing good generalizability of the
findings to school children (Grade I; Table 7)
Mechanisms
Physiologic. Brain extracellular glucose concentrations fluc-
tuate with blood glucose concentrations such that brain ex-
tracellular glucose concentrations are ;20–30% of blood
glucose concentrations (62). This suggests that increasing
blood glucose by consuming carbohydrates will induce small
increases in extracellular glucose in the brain. However, it is
unlikely that this will lead to changes in brain activity and
thus cognitive function, because neuronal uptake of glucose
is driven by neural activity, not by extracellular brain glucose
concentration (62, 63). Astrocytes function as a buffering
system, regulating availability of brain extracellular glucose
for neurons in response to neuronal activity, and also con-
tain glycogen stores to prevent large fluctuations in glucose
availability (62, 63). This may explain why the effects of
breakfast consumption on cognitive performance can occur
when blood glucose concentrations have returned to base-
line. Alternatively, mechanisms involving glucose suggest
that increased blood glucose may improve cognition by fa-
cilitating neuronal glucose uptake specifically in regions in
which brain extracellular glucose concentrations are de-
creased during times of high neuronal glucose uptake (62,
64, 65). This is supported by research demonstrating that in-
creased neuronal glucose uptake driven by active neurons
during demanding cognitive tasks can lead to a local deficit
in extracellular glucose that is rate-limiting for glucose
transfer to neurons (62, 64, 65).
Secondary metabolic events induced by carbohydrate inges-
tion, such as changes to concentrations of neurotransmitters
and hormones, may mediate changes to cognition (62, 63,
65). Glucose-mediated insulin delivery to the brain may fa-
cilitate cognitive performance after ingestion of carbohy-
drates. Insulin crosses the blood–brain barrier, and insulin
receptors are located in the brain (66). Furthermore, admin-
istration of insulin intranasally has been shown to facilitate
cognitive performance in adults (67). Other mecha-
nisms may involve the excitatory neurotransmitter acetyl-
choline, given that synthesis of acetylcholine requires
glucose. Glucose ingestion may increase acetylcholine syn-
thesis, which could influence cognitive function. Cortisol
secretion as a result of the combination of carbohydrate
consumption and an arousing situation (cognitive testing)
may interact to facilitate effects on cognitive performance
(32). Cortisol receptors are abundant in the hippocampus.
Ingestion of glucose can interact with a stressful task and
provoke a greater cortisol response (68), which in turn
has dose-dependent and bidirectional effects on cognitive
function (63). This may account for the fact that beneficial
cognitive effects are most apparent at times when post-
prandial blood glucose concentrations have returned to
or below baseline values after breakfast consumption,
but when differences in cortisol are most likely to occur
(i.e., during cognitive testing).
Subjective state. Breakfast may affect cognitive perfor-
mance indirectly through changes in feelings or subjective
state (e.g., mood or alertness) caused by the consumption
of breakfast. There is consistent evidence that breakfast con-
sumption is associated with improved subjective feelings of
mood and alertness in school children (21, 25, 28, 44). The
positive changes in mood, alertness, and motivation after
breakfast may in turn facilitate cognitive performance by in-
creasing children’s ability to concentrate and/or motivation
to try hard on cognitive tasks.
Research recommendations
Further studies are needed with well-matched study condi-
tions to establish the effect of breakfast composition on
school children’s cognitive performance. Studies are also
needed with larger samples with sufficient power to detect
a statistically significant effect and in samples with adoles-
cents, in whom there are far fewer studies. Evidence is also
needed in more ecologically valid research conditions,
such as school-based studies and/or ad libitum breakfast
manipulations. This review also highlights the need for
more studies that use cognitive tasks sensitive to nutritional
manipulations (59).

 Conclusion
From the studies reviewed, the data suggest that consuming
breakfast has a short-term positive, domain-specific effect
on cognitive function measured within 4 h postingestion
in children and adolescents. The potential for breakfast to
have an impact upon cognitive performance appears to be
more pronounced in undernourished children. However,
the effects of breakfast composition and the long-term effects
of consuming breakfast are unclear because of insufficient
studies in this area and problematic experimental designs.
