ypertension is a highly prevalent risk factor and a major 
contributor to a myriad of cardiovascular diseases. It 
is difficult to overestimate the overall impact of effective 
hypertension control on the cardiovascular disease burden in 
the population. Because of consistent efforts to increase the 
awareness and treatment of hypertension in the United States 
during the past several decades, the overall control of hyper-
tension seems to be improving.1,2 Despite this effort, several 
studies have raised the concern of racial and ethnic inequalities 
in terms of hypertension treatment and control.3–6 Although 
suboptimal insurance coverage and poor access to health care 
are most widely accepted determinants of health disparities, 
the causes of racial inequalities are complex and require sys-
tematic studies to bridge the gap in achieving universal high-
quality clinical outcomes. We sought to examine the racial 
differences in hypertension treatment and control, describe 
antihypertensive drug utilization patterns, and explore poten-
tial causes of racial disparities in these measures.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
was conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
National Center for Health Statistics. NHANES volunteers were se-
lected using stratified, multistage probability sampling of the non-
institutionalized US population.7 Since 1999, NHANES has been 
implemented as a continuous, cross-sectional annual survey, and data 
are publicly released in 2-year circles. Survey participants receive de-
tailed in-person home interviews, followed by standardized physical 
examinations conducted in mobile examination centers, and labora-
tory tests using blood and urine specimens provided by participants 
during the physical examination. The overall participant response rate 
ranged from 72.6% to 80.5% for interviews and from 69.5% to 77.4% 
Background—A key to reduce and eradicate racial disparities in hypertension outcomes is to understand their causes. 
We aimed at evaluating racial differences in antihypertensive drug utilization patterns and blood pressure control by 
insurance status, age, sex, and presence of comorbidities.
Methods and Results—A total of 8796 hypertensive individuals ≥18 years of age were identified from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003–2012) in a repeated cross-sectional study. During the study period, all 3 racial 
groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics) experienced substantial increase in hypertension treatment and control. The 
overall treatment rates were 73.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.6%–76.2%), 70.8% (95% CI, 68.6%–73.0%), and 
60.7% (95% CI, 57.0%–64.3%) and hypertension control rates were 42.9% (95% CI, 40.5%–45.2%), 36.9% (95% CI, 
34.7%–39.2%), and 31.2% (95% CI, 28.6%–33.9%) for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectively. When stratified by 
insurance status, blacks (odds ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.64–0.86] for insured and 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36–0.94] for uninsured) 
and Hispanics (odds ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60–0.91] for insured and 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36–0.94] for uninsured) persistently 
had lower rates of hypertension control compared with whites. Racial disparities also persisted in subgroups stratified by 
age (≥60 and <60 years of age) and presence of comorbidities but worsened among patients <60 years of age.
Conclusions—Black and Hispanic patients had poorer hypertension control compared with whites, and these differences were 
more 
pronounced 
in 
younger 
and 
uninsured 
patients. 
Although 
black 
patients 
received 
more 
intensive 
antihypertensive 
therapy, 
Hispanics were undertreated. Future studies should further explore all aspects of these disparities to improve cardiovascular 
outcomes.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2017;10:e003166. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.003166.)

for examination at mobile examination centers for each survey cycle 
from 2003 to 2012. The surveys were reviewed and approved by the 
National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board, and 
documented consent was obtained from participants.
Participants included adults ≥18 years of age in NHANES 2003 
to 2012.
Hypertension was defined if 1 or more of the following conditions 
were met: (1) systolic blood pressure (BP)≥140 mm Hg; (2) diastolic 
BP ≥90 mm Hg; and an affirmative response to “Are you currently 
taking medication to lower your blood pressure?” A small proportion 
(<1%) of such participants were excluded from the analysis because 
of lack of valid BP measurements or pregnancy.
Race/ethnicity was self-reported and separated into non-Hispanic 
white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Hispanic ethnicity of 
any race.
Mean systolic and diastolic BP were determined per NHANES 
reporting guidelines. Up to 3 BP readings were obtained and used to 
calculate a mean systolic BP and a mean diastolic BP for each indi-
vidual. A detailed description of the procedures for BP measurement 
in NHANES has been published elsewhere.8
Hypertension control was defined first based on the Joint National 
Committee (JNC) 7 standards: systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastol-
ic BP <90 mm Hg for patients without chronic kidney disease and 
diabetes mellitus (DM) and systolic BP <130 mm Hg and diastolic 
BP <80 mm Hg for patients with either comorbidity.9 Alternatively, 
BP control thresholds recommended by the JNC 8 guidelines were 
explored. This analysis relies on retrospective application of JNC 8 
recommendations aimed at contrasting the measures of hypertension 
control based on old (JNC 7) and proposed (JNC 8) definitions. JNC 
8 eased the BP goals for older patients (≥60 years of age) without 
chronic kidney disease and DM to <150 mm Hg systolic BP and <90 
mm Hg diastolic BP, whereas for all other patients ≥18 years of age, 
the goals were set at <140/90 mm Hg.10
Antihypertensive medications were categorized into the fol-
lowing classes: (1) diuretics, (2) β-blockers, (3) calcium chan-
nel blockers (CCBs), (4) angiotensin II receptor blockers, (5) 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and (6) others (eg, direct 
vasodilators, renin inhibitors, α1-blockers, and other centrally acting 
drugs). Monotherapy was defined when a person only reported tak-
ing 1 antihypertensive agent. Combination therapy (polytherapy) was 
defined when a person reported taking >1 antihypertensive agents, 
including fixed-dose combination agents and combinations of dif-
ferent diuretics. Antihypertensive treatment rates (overall and class-
specific) were defined as the percentages of hypertensive individuals 
who reported using respective class of antihypertensive agents dur-
ing the study period. Likewise, prevalence of controlled hypertension 
was defined as the proportion of hypertensive individuals whose BP 
measured was below the thresholds for controlled hypertension per 
JNC recommendations.
DM was defined if 1 or more of the following conditions were 
met: (1) a positive response to 1 or more of the following questions, 
“Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?”, “Are 
you now taking insulin?”, and “Are you now taking diabetic pills to 
lower your blood sugar?”; (2) antidiabetic medication(s) reported or 
brought to examination by the interviewee; (3) fasting glucose ≥7 
mmol/L; and (4) glycosylated hemoglobin ≥6.5%.11,12
Chronic kidney disease was defined as either an estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a urinary albumin concen-
tration of >200 mg/g urinary creatinine, where glomerular filtration 
rate was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
equation.2 Serum creatinine values from NHANES 2005 to 2006 data 
were recalibrated according to the recommended standards.13
Participants’ age, sex, health insurance status, presence of a 
routine place for health care, poverty income ratio, and history of 
physician-diagnosed cardiovascular disease (such as stroke, conges-
tive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or coronary 
artery disease) were obtained by questionnaire.
Statistical Methods
We used descriptive statistics to identify the following patient 
characteristics: (1) sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare uti-
lization characteristics; (2) antihypertensive prescribing rates; and 
(3) hypertension control. Linear trends in the prescribing pattern 
and control of hypertension were assessed with regression models 
with a 2-year period treated as a continuous variable. We conduct-
ed logistic regressions to model the probability of antihyperten-
sive treatment and BP control among treated and reported odds 
ratios (ORs) of each racial/ethnic group relative to whites. This 
analysis was conducted in all study subjects and in subgroups by 
insurance, age, sex, and comorbidity status. We reported ORs in 2 
ways: unadjusted and fully adjusted. In the fully adjusted model, 
we adjusted for 3 categories of patient-level variables: patient de-
mographics, insurance status and whether patient had a routine 
place for healthcare, and clinical characteristics. Demographics 
included age bins (18–39, 40–59, ≥60 years of age), sex, and pov-
erty-to-income ratio (<100%, 200% to 299%, 300% to 499%, and 
≥500%). Clinical characteristics included physician-diagnosed 
DM, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. These 
variables were shown to be relevant in previous studies1,2,14 to hy-
pertension treatment and control, and they were all significantly 
associated with race (2-sided P<0.01) from χ2 tests. Pairwise inter-
actions between race and each of the other independent variables 
were tested for significance.
Appropriate sample weights were used to account for differen-
tial probabilities of selection and the complex multistage sample 
survey design.7 Taylor linearization was used for variance estima-
tion, and domain analysis was used for subpopulation analysis 
because selection of subpopulations may be unrelated to sample 
design. The analyses were performed only for subgroups with 
sample sizes large enough to produce reliable estimates according 
to the National Center for Health Statistics standards (sample size 
≥30 and relative SE <0.30).7 Examination of the hypertensive pa-
tient sample in our study indicated that the distributions of age were 
similar across survey years (P=0.74). Hence, we present estimates 
of antihypertensive-prescribing rates and hypertension control 
among US adults with hypertension without age standardization.
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Hypertension treatment and control have been 
improving during the past several decades, but some 
high-risk groups (including racial minorities) may 
still have suboptimal blood pressure control.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• The current repeated cross-sectional study was based 
on National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey from 2003 to 2012 and was aimed at evaluating 
racial differences in antihypertensive drug utilization 
patterns and blood pressure control.
• Black and Hispanic patients seemed to have poorer 
hypertension control compared with non-Hispanic 
whites, and these differences were more pronounced 
in younger and uninsured patients.
• Suboptimal insurance coverage and poor access to 
health care are most widely accepted determinants 
of health disparities, but the causes of racial inequali-
ties are complex and can be broadly categorized as 
patient related and healthcare related.
• Further efforts should focus on understanding the 
reasons for racial inequalities in hypertension con-
trol and mounting a broader effort in addressing 
these reasons.

 3  Gu et al  Racial Differences in Hypertension
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
Among the groups, whites were older, had a higher income 
level, and were more likely to have health insurance. These 
differences were more pronounced compared with Hispanic 
patients. Also, whites carried lower rates of obesity and DM 
and were less likely to be active smokers. Although they had 
high rates of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular dis-
ease, it is possible that comorbidities were underdiagnosed 
because of suboptimal access to healthcare, especially in the 
Hispanic group. Among the 3 groups, the rates of hyperten-
sion control based on JNC 7 recommendations were highest 
among whites (42.9%; 95% CI, 40.5%–45.2%), followed by 
blacks (36.9%; 95% CI, 34.7%–39.2%), and lowest among 
Hispanics (31.2%; 95% CI, 28.6%–33.9%); these differences 
were similar when JNC 8 standards were applied.
Temporal Trends
The percentage of hypertensive adults who reported taking 
 
an antihypertensive drug increased from 65.6% in 2003 
to 2004 to 77.3% in 2010 to 2012 (Ptrend<0.001), and this 
was consistent in all 3 groups (whites: 66.9% to 78.8%; 
Ptrend<0.001; blacks: 63.0% to 76.0%; Ptrend<0.001; and His-
panics: 57.1% to 68.3%; Ptrend<0.01) as shown in Table 2. 
Most notably, significant increases in utilization were 
observed for diuretics among whites (diuretics: 30.4% to

Prescription Patterns
Overall, diuretics (predominantly thiazide diuretics) were the 
most commonly utilized antihypertensive drug class account-

the study period (Table 3). At the same time, they were pref-
erentially used in combination therapy compared with other 
classes. Hispanic patients (60.7%; 95% CI, 57.0%–64.3%)

(whites: 45.8%; 95% CI, 43.6%–48.0%; blacks: 48.3%; 95%

tion therapy and they also had the highest average number 
of antihypertensive medications (whites: 1.78; 95% CI, 1.73–

Hypertension Control
During the 10-year study period from 2003 to 2012, the over-
all hypertension control based on JNC 7 criteria increased 
from 33.0% in 2003 to 2004 to 44.9% in 2011 to 2012 
 
(Ptrend<0.001). All 3 groups experienced substantial improve-
ment in hypertension control (whites: from 34.6% to 47.2%; 
Ptrend<0.001; blacks: from 30.2% to 39.2%; Ptrend<0.001; and 
Hispanics: from 22.3%– 36.9%; Ptrend <0.01). Further analy-
sis based on JNC 8 treatment goals and analysis restricted to 
treated hypertensive patients only (data not shown) showed a 
similar trend in hypertension control improvement (Figure).

Racial Difference in Treatment and Control of 
Hypertension
Table 4 presents the estimated ORs for the differences in the 
proportions of antihypertensive medications and hypertension 
control for each racial group relative to whites. Despite being 
more likely to receive combination therapy, black patients 
were less likely to achieve hypertension control (adjusted OR, 
0.73; 95% CI, 0.63–0.83). This is consistent with a notion that 
black patients have more aggressive forms of hypertension. 
As compared with whites, the prescription pattern for black 
patients was notable for higher odds of receiving diuretics 
(OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.26–1.61) and CCBs (OR, 2.13; 95% 
CI, 1.86–2.44) and lower odds of receiving β-blockers (OR, 
0.66; 95% CI, 0.57–0.78) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74–0.99). This pattern reflects 
the notion that black patients are more responsive to diuretic 
and CCB therapy and less responsive to agents that affect the 
renin–angiotensin system.
Similar to black patients, Hispanic patients were less likely 
to attain the treatment goals in adjusted analysis compared

with white patients (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.87), but unlike 
black patients, they received less intensive antihypertensive 
therapy (OR for combination therapy 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–
0.92). They were also least likely to receive any antihyperten-
sive therapy.
Potential Effect Modifiers
We considered the following effect modifiers in exploring 
the racial differences in hypertension treatment and con-
trol: health insurance coverage, age, sex, and comorbidities. 
Racial disparities in hypertension treatment and control per-
sisted among hypertensive individuals with health insurance 
coverage, yet they were more prominent among uninsured. 
For example, compared with whites, the odds of achieving 
hypertension control per JNC 7 criteria among uninsured 
Hispanics (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36–0.94) and blacks (OR, 
0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.94) were reduced by >40% (Table I in 
the Data Supplement). Also, uninsured blacks were substan-
tially less likely than whites to receive any antihypertensive 
treatment (OR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.91), whereas no sig-
nificant differences were observed for insured patients.
Racial differences in hypertension control appeared 
wider among younger (<60 years of age) patients (Table II 
in the Data Supplement). Both younger black patients (OR, 
0.58; 95% CI, 0.47–0.72) and Hispanic patients (OR, 0.62; 
95% CI, 0.46–0.83) were ≈40% less likely than whites to 
achieve hypertension control; these differences were not 
statistically significant among older patients (Table II in the 
Data Supplement). The racial differences in antihypertensive 
medication utilization were evident both in male patients and 
female patients but were somewhat more prominent in male 
patients (Table III in the Data Supplement).
The differences in antihypertensive drug utilization and 
hypertension control persisted across the cohorts categorized 
by presence of comorbidities: black and Hispanic patients with 
and without comorbidities were less likely to achieve hyper-
tension control compared with whites, but hispanic patients 
seemed to be undertreated (Table IV in the Data Supplement).
Discussion
Adequate hypertension control remains a healthcare priority 
in the United States because of potential large-scale impact 
on the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality burden. Several 
studies have reported recent improvements in hypertension 
awareness, treatment, and control.1,15,16 Our study confirms 
positive trends in both antihypertensive therapy utilization and 
hypertension control in all racial groups during the 10-year 
study period. At the same time, we observed marked racial 
differences in these measures. Black and Hispanic patients 
seemed to have poorer hypertension control (as assessed by 
both JNC 7 and JNC 8 criteria) compared with whites, and 
these differences were more pronounced in younger and unin-
sured patients. Although black patients received more inten-
sive antihypertensive therapy, Hispanics were undertreated. 
Therefore, further efforts should focus on understanding the 
reasons for racial inequalities in hypertension control and 
mounting a broader effort in addressing these reasons.
The reasons for uncontrolled hypertension are com-
plex and can be broadly categorized as patient related and 
healthcare related.17,18 Some of the important patient-related 
reasons include awareness and understanding of the dis-
ease,19 adherence to prescribed antihypertensive therapies 
and lifestyle changes,20,21 access to medical care including 
drug affordability22,23 and biology of the disease.24 Healthcare-
related reasons include accepted standards and goals in 
hypertension treatment and control, physician education and 
familiarity with therapeutic options, antihypertensive regimen 
complexity, provider–patient interaction, and adequate patient 
follow-up.18 The patient-specific factors are largely affected 
by education level as well as cultural and social environ-
ment that determines disease awareness, social support, and 
patient–physician interaction. Access to health care including 
affordable medications is also a major factor. In our study, 
there were significant racial disparities in patient income and 
health insurance status most pronounced between whites and 
Hispanics. Hispanic patients were less likely to get any anti-
hypertensive therapy, received less intensive antihypertensive 
regimen, and were less likely to achieve hypertension control. 
Racial differences were exaggerated by insurance status and 
younger age (likely in part because of Medicare ineligibility). 
Broader efforts to improve access to health care are likely to 
address social and racial differences in hypertension treatment 
and control.
In the settings of controlled clinical trials, which decrease 
confounding and ensure uniform access to health care and 
pharmacotherapy, Hispanic patients seem to achieve blood 
pressure control rates similar to white patients. This suggests 
that biological factors are less likely to explain the differ-
ences in blood pressure control between Hispanics and whites 
observed in our study.25,26 On the contrary, differences in the 
biology of the disease should be considered for black patients: 
it has been suggested that black patients have more aggressive 
forms of hypertension compared with white patients, and they 
are more prone to hypertension-related complications.27–29 
Also, black patients differ in responsiveness to various anti-
hypertensive drug classes.30,31 In our study, black patients 
received more intensive antihypertensive therapy compared 
with white patients including higher rates of combination ther-
apy. They also were more likely to receive CCBs and diuretics 
in favor of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which is 
consistent with the current understanding of responsiveness 
to antihypertensive drugs. Despite that, black patients were 
less likely to achieve hypertension control. Aside from innate 
biological reasons, lifestyle differences also contribute to the 
observed racial disparities. Black patients are more likely to 
have obesity, may have lower levels of physical activity, and 
may have higher caloric intake and lower potassium intake 
compared with white patients.32,33 In addition, racial dispari-
ties in medication adherence have been described in previous 
studies. A large study based on Kaiser Permanente’s Northern 
California Diabetes Registry found that Hispanic patients 
were less likely than white patients to adhere to their car-
diovascular medications.34 English language proficiency was 
identified as a barrier for good adherence. At the same time, 
other studies strongly suggested that racial discrepancies in 
medical adherence do not solely account for the disparities in 
hypertension control.35

 8  Gu et al  Racial Differences in Hypertension
While patient-specific factors contribute to the racial discrep-
ancies in hypertension treatment and control, physician-related 
factors (such as failure to escalate therapy in more severe forms 
of hypertension) also play a role. Previous studies have suggested 
some racial differences in patient-centered communications and 
physician–patient interaction.34,36,37 Efforts to engage patients 
in the medical decision making more effectively may improve 
patient–provider relationship and patient self-management.
Finally, the accepted thresholds for hypertension con-
trol are the subject of intense debate.38,39 Earlier JNC 7 goals 
were readdressed and somewhat relaxed by JNC 8 committee, 
but their report has been widely criticized and not uniformly 
accepted.40–42 Recently released SPRINT (Systolic Blood 
Pressure Intervention Trial) results with stricter hypertension 
control thresholds added another level of complexity.43 The 
lack of universally agreed definitions of hypertension control 
not only affects population studies but also impacts individual 
physician decision making.44
This is a serial cross-sectional study with inherent limi-
tations attributable to the observational study design and 
residual confounding. All the potential reasons for racial 
differences in hypertension treatment and control cannot be 
addressed by a single observational study, although we tried 
to explore some specific patient-related factors. Finally, data 
about patient long-term adherence to antihypertensive medi-
cations was not directly available. We used both JNC 7 and 
JVC 8 recommendations with understanding that neither of 
them is universally and inarguably accepted.
Conclusions
Despite major improvements in hypertension treatment and 
control during the 10-year study period, the racial differences 
in these measures persist. Future efforts should focus on sys-
tematically exploring and addressing these differences.
