Learning objectives
� To understand ‘how to ask’ women about mental health: by
normalising and raising awareness of perinatal mental health,
providing examples of open screening questions, recapping
psychiatric history and mental state examination, and performing
a risk assessment.
� To understand ‘how to help’ women with their mental health: by
guideline-driven advice at first contact for mild anxiety and low
mood, deciding on level of risk and the direction and urgency
of referral.
Ethical issues
� There is no evidence that discussing mental health or suicidal
ideation leads to an increased risk of self-harm or suicide, and in
fact it is known to decrease the rate of completed suicide.

Introduction
The 2015 Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits
and Confidential Enquiries (MBRRACE) report cites deaths
from psychiatric disorders as one of the leading causes of
maternal death.1 Between 2010 and 2012, 16 women
(0.67
per
100 000)
were
reported
as
dying
from
a
psychiatric cause. This is an increase from the previous
Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United
Kingdom (CEMD) (2006–2008) report where 13 women died
(0.51 per 100 000).2 There were more deaths in 2010–2012
from psychiatric causes than from haemorrhage (0.46 per
100 000), pre-eclampsia (0.38 per 100 000) or genital tract
sepsis (0.50 per 100 000).1 Of all the maternal deaths
reported by MBRRACE, 16.8% of the women concerned
had a recognised mental health problem and 7.5% had a
history of substance misuse.
Almost one-quarter of the women who died between
6 weeks and 1 year after pregnancy died from mental health-
related causes in the MBRRACE report: 14% from suicide
and 9% related to drugs and alcohol. Of the women who
committed suicide, over 80% were white and had a median
age of 29 years.1 Of the 29 women in the CEMD report who
committed suicide, over half were white, married, employed,
living in comfortable circumstances and were aged 30 years
or over.2 Time of death seems to peak at 43–84 days
postnatal (27%), 169–210 days postnatal (25%) and then
again at 295–365 days postnatal (21%).1 More than one-
quarter of women in the CEMD report had evidence
documented in the clinical notes of severe depressive illness
with psychotic features, and in at least one-quarter of these
cases
clinicians
had
made
the
wrong
initial
psychiatric diagnosis.
It is clear therefore that much groundwork needs to be
done. The stigma of mental health affects all of us –
professionals and patients alike – and leads to a reluctance to
discuss the subject.3,4 Clinicians may feel apprehensive in
broaching
the
subject
for
fear
of
asking
questions
insensitively, or perhaps of not knowing what to do with
the information divulged. Women may in turn be reluctant

 or fearful to disclose their thoughts because of perceived risks
to their autonomy and their child(ren).
This review aims to equip obstetricians with suggestions of
what and how to ask women about perinatal mental health. It
will focus on the primary encounter as an opportunity for
open
discussion,
therapeutic
support
and
basic
risk
assessment for those with known or emerging psychiatric
problems. We recap the psychiatric history and examination,
and provide suggestions for advice at first contact (front-
door advice) and how to manage lower and higher-
risk women.
How to ask
Some women may have had contact with mental health
services before – whether they received regular input from a
psychiatrist and/or mental health team or they received
counselling or talking therapies for an acutely stressful life
event. The brevity of information from the booking visit
offers little insight into the woman’s previous or current
mental health, and therefore the first encounter with an
obstetrician has a number of aims.
As the first encounter with the woman often occurs in the
early
second
trimester,
obstetricians
enter
the
multidisciplinary team at a point where primary care, the
community mental health team and midwifery colleagues may
have had prior input with preconception or early pregnancy
advice. Additionally, they may have offered support on low
mood, coping strategies and/or medication that is safe in
pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is well established that open
and active discussion with the woman, and within the
multidisciplinary
team,
can
help
establish
a
trusting
relationship and optimise future therapeutic support.
Opening statements
Communicating normalising introductory statements about
mental health is an effective way of explaining your intentions
and creating a neutral, open space for safe discussion. A key
point to explore with the woman is the frequency and
normality of mental health concerns in pregnancy and the
postnatal period. Examples of such statements include:
‘While I’m not expecting any particular issues with you or
your pregnancy, I would just like to briefly discuss mental
health. It is common that women develop concerns or
anxieties about what can be a difficult stage in their life:
dealing with pregnancy, childbirth and coping with a
newborn baby. It’s important to understand these concerns
are nothing to be ashamed of, and we can provide lots of help
and support.’
‘Pregnancy, childbirth and looking after a newborn baby can
be a difficult time in a woman’s life. It is common for women
to feel anxious or low in mood, and they may hide these
feelings for fear of seeming like they cannot cope. We can
discuss anything here, and I’d like to help wherever possible,
so tell me, how have you been feeling recently?’
It is important to keep an open mind and be prepared for
anything the woman may say, free from surprise or
judgement. You may perhaps be the first person to enquire
seriously about a woman’s mood, and she may be hiding her
feelings well.
Exploratory questions
Once a rapport has been established, it is important to
continue with exploratory questions. The aim of these
questions
is
to
explore
her
concerns,
and
gather
information
on
any
symptoms
she
is
experiencing.
Ultimately, you are looking to decide if the woman would
benefit from referral to mental health services, so listen
carefully to what she has to say. Some examples of follow-on
questions are:
� ‘How are you feeling at the moment?’
� ‘How has your mood been recently?’
� ‘Do you have any concerns or anxieties?’
� ‘Do you feel more support would be helpful?’
� ‘How are you coping at the moment?’
� ‘How are your sleep/appetite/energy levels?’
� ‘Are you able to find enjoyment in things?’
� ‘Have you had any unusual experiences recently?’
Direct questions
Once you have a focus for discussion, it is of utmost
importance to ask more direct (closed) questions to probe for
concerns that the women may be fearful to divulge. The
structure of these questions should not be leading, to avoid
providing a false sense of security for the woman or indeed
yourself.
In
the
example
of
women
struggling
with
hyperemesis,
where
it
is
known
that
previous
eating
disorders are a potential risk factor, resist the temptation of
saying ‘But, you’re not worried about gaining weight or
looking fat?’ as it leads the woman to affirming the negative,
and may in fact serve as practice for continually hiding her
innermost thoughts and feelings until she is in extremis.
Risk assessment
For the same reason, and to avoid ambiguity or uncertainty
in the answer, direct questioning in a risk assessment is
advised at every encounter. A risk assessment should be
performed at every encounter with a woman whose mental
health you are concerned about. The aim of the risk
assessment is to establish if there is any risk of self-harm or
harm to others. Although perhaps intimidating at first,
completing a risk assessment need not be difficult. For most
women a single question may be all that is required, and once

 again normalising and explanatory language is very helpful.
Examples might be:
‘I have the opportunity to talk to many women, and it is
common during more stressful or emotional life events, such
as pregnancy, to have thoughts that life is hopeless or not
worth living. Have you experienced such thoughts?’
‘One question I like to ask all women I meet with is about
mental health and risks, as pregnancy and childbirth can be a
difficult time in some women’s lives. Some women I meet
experience thoughts of harming themselves, or harming
others, and we can provide help and support in these
situations. Have you experienced any such thoughts?’
If the woman answers positively to a screening risk
assessment question then be prepared to ask follow-on
questions. Find out about any plans she may have made:
‘Have you thought about how you might hurt yourself?’; her
intent to act on these plans: ‘When do you think you might
go through with these plans?’; and any protective factors that
the women has: ‘What has stopped you acting on these
thoughts up to this point?’. Being empathetic is extremely
important, and the woman may feel a great sense of relief at
simply having the opportunity to discuss her thoughts and
feelings with a caring professional. Make sure you document
the answers, and be prepared to discuss them urgently with a
mental health professional (as further discussed below).
The MBRRACE report cites failure to recognise symptom
pattern and potential seriousness of symptoms as a key area
of focus: ‘assessment should always include a review of
previous history and always take into account the findings of
recent presentations and escalating patterns of symptoms,
their severity and any associated abnormal behaviour’.1
Expressions or acts of violent self-harm are ‘red flag’
symptoms and should ALWAYS be regarded as serious.
The questions discussed in this section can be used as
screening tools and may be adapted depending on the woman’s
responses. It is important to pick up on cues and ask further
questions as appropriate. For example, perhaps a woman with a
psychoticdisorderhasexpressedastronglyheldbeliefthatisout
of keeping with her social or cultural context (delusion)?
Perhaps she has mentioned feeling like someone is always
watching her (paranoid thoughts) or her speech and/or
thoughts are disordered? How is her mood and affect? It is
important to consider that new or changing presentations may
occur throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, and
we must be alert, and act upon, any initial signs and symptoms.
Remember to ask about the woman’s bonding with her child,
and the child’s attachment to her and other family members,
because this can be influenced by, and influence, mental ill
health. New and persistent expressions of incompetency as a
mother orestrangementfrom theinfant are‘red flag’ symptoms
(Box1)andmaybeindicatorsofsignificantdepressivedisorder.
It is important to note at this stage that the assessing
clinician may find it difficult to distinguish between normal
adaptive process and early signs and symptoms of mental ill
health. Junior medical or nursing staff may lack the breadth
of experience needed to distinguish between the two. The
MBRRACE report cites that failure to recognise herald
symptoms, an inability to see a pattern of escalating
behaviours
and
misattribution
to
normal
emotional
changes lead to rapid deterioration in perinatal mental
illness.
There
is
an
expectation
of
early
consultant
involvement and this should not be shied away from.
It may be appropriate to get to know the woman over
sequential
appointments
to
guide
your
diagnosis
and
management, remembering that any identified risks need to
be managed. Asking about life events during the consultation
can help with distinguishing between normal adjustment
reactions, to say a relationship breakdown, and the onset of a
psychiatric disorder.
Rating scales
There are several rating scales that clinicians may use to further
assess mood or other symptoms of mental health. These
include the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale,
and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. These have
been researched for use in pregnancy, and several are
recommended as screening tools by NICE guidance.5–7 These
scales can be most useful when time is limited, and can guide
clinicians
towards
further
assessment
when
necessary.
However, it is important to note that these scales only
provide
additional
information
to
a
full
psychiatric
assessment, because any mental health diagnosis is a clinical
one. They may also not be readily available at every encounter
with
a
woman
and
therefore
becoming
familiar
and
comfortable with exploring mental health symptoms without
these resources is a key skill for any obstetrician.
History and mental state examination
If you are able, and time allows, a full psychiatric history and
mental state examination should be performed (Boxes 2 and 3).
Such an assessment, while not essential for an obstetrician to
perform, is the backbone of psychiatric formulation and
management. If performed, it will aid any discussion with a
mental health team and guide the urgency for any psychiatric
Box 1. Red flag presentations1

 intervention that may be required. Tell the woman that you are
going to spend some time exploring her symptoms, so as to get
her the most appropriate support. Don’t be afraid to ask her
specific questions outright (such as alcohol intake, illicit drug
use and domestic violence), because while women may be
reluctant to disclose such difficult information, they are
unlikely to lie in a trusting environment when asked directly.
As always, be empathetic and non-judgemental as information
is disclosed and ask follow-on questions to clarify uncertainties.
Finally, it is important to make contact with the patient’s
primary care doctor who will often be able to provide much
more information, which can help in your understanding of the
clinical picture and in your future management. Ask for
permission from the woman and explain what you are doing.
The GP may also know some wider dynamics connected with
the woman, for example family circumstances, which can be
important in fully risk assessing the situation.
How to help
Based on the history, mental state examination and risk
assessment, you will have formed an idea of the most
appropriate setting for the management and urgency of any
referral to mental health services. This decision making must
be on a case by case basis and guided by your history,
examination and advice from a senior colleague if required. If
you are unsure then ringing your local liaison (or other
psychiatry access service) is encouraged. Most women can be
managed in the community, with referral to the perinatal
mental health team or community mental health team if the
former is unavailable. It is important to reassure the woman
and explain that mental health problems in the perinatal and
postnatal period are common and nothing to be ashamed of.
Acknowledge that it must have been difficult for her to open
up about her thoughts and reassure her that help is available.
It is good practice to offer her a copy of any referral letter you
write and make sure she knows to contact your service if she
is not offered an appointment with mental health services
within an agreed timeframe.

Box 3. Mental state examination
While these notes are a brief guide, it is important to remember that
describing in detail what you see and hear is the most important
aspect of a mental state examination.
Appearance and behaviour:
Describe dress, personal hygiene, any usual features (i.e. wearing
multiple layers and coats indoors), are they polite/rude/anxious/
aggressive/evasive?
Speech:
Rate (fast, slow, variable), rhythm (flowing, disjoined), volume, tone,
coherency, relevance
Mood:
Record subjective mood verbatim (‘awful doctor’) and objective mood
(low, manic, mixed). Affect – is this reactive and congruent?
NB: Affect is the minute-to-minute change in your emotions, while
mood is your pervasive and overriding emotion. I.e. someone with a
low mood (who is depressed) may find a joke humorous – their affect
would be ‘reactive’ and ‘appropriate’ in response to the joke, their
mood, however, remains low.
Thoughts:
Delusional thoughts (disturbance in thought content), thought
disorder (disturbance in thought form). Includes ideas of reference,
knight’s move thinking, obsessional thoughts, compulsions, anxieties,
overvalued ideas and other psychopathology. Describe what you see/
hear. Thoughts of self-harm and harm to others are included here.
Perceptions:
Hallucinations: auditory/visual/tactile. Describe in detail, i.e. are
auditory hallucinations in second or third person? What do they say?
Do they give commands?
Cognition:
Orientation to time/person/place, memory, concentration/attention
Insight:
What is their perception of any symptoms? Do they want help? Record
compliance with medications and treatments.
Box 2. Psychiatric history
Presenting complaint:
Mood, anxiety, psychotic symptoms, memory, cognitive function
History of presenting complaint:
Timeline of symptoms, third-party sources if available
Past psychiatric history:
Previous/current diagnosis, self-harm or harm to others, previous
admission (use of Mental Health Act), previous treatments and
outcomes
Past medical history:
Cardiac, renal, liver, etc.
Drug history:
Allergies, any psychotropic medication currently and previously
prescribed and adverse effects experienced
Family history:
Family tree, family history of psychiatric illness and self-harm/suicide
Social history:
Smoking status, alcohol, illicit drugs, housing and occupational
information including financial strains
Personal history:
Birth, development, childhood, school, relationships (with family/
parents and romantic/sexual), employment
Forensic history:
Convictions and contact with police
Premorbid personality:
‘How would others describe your personality when you are well?’

 professional) can help the majority of women with mild
anxiety or low mood, and you should not be afraid to discuss
this with your patients. Box 4 highlights such advice, including
extracts from that recommended by the NICE guidelines for
depression in adults.8 Additionally, you could provide women
with leaflets or direct them to helpful online resources. The
Royal College of Psychiatrists has a useful website with
downloadable leaflets and resources on most mental health
conditions, medications and treatments.9
Crisis management
At every contact with the woman, but particularly when
you
initially
uncover
any
mental
health
issues,
it
is
important to provide the woman with a safety net in the
event
of
a
crisis.
Advise
her
that
urgent
(but
not
necessarily immediate) support can be sought from the
GP, local mental health crisis team or mental health
midwife. Familiarise yourself with the relevant contact
numbers for these services (your local community mental
health team is the easiest place to start), and assist your
patient in writing them down in a memorable place.
Alternatively, if she has immediate concerns regarding the
safety of herself and/or her baby or family, she must go
immediately to the accident and emergency department in
the hospital. This advice may seem overly cautious but it is
important that women and their partners appreciate the
potential severity of perinatal mental health problems. By
raising awareness and normalising the need to access
support, we may come closer to reducing these potentially
life-threatening risks.
When women present in times of need, crisis or extremis,
we must be exemplary in our support. All trusts should have
a system where women’s perinatal mental health notes are
accessible by the community mental health team or crisis
team, general practitioner, mental health midwife and
obstetric team quickly and easily, both within and outside
working hours.
Safety concerns
If during your consultation you have concerns regarding the
safety of the woman and/or her baby or family, you must
escalate this to the duty psychiatric nurse (within hours), or
the liaison psychiatry nurse (out of hours). Once again,
familiarise yourself with your local services: ringing and
asking for local protocols and contact numbers is an easy
task, and will save you time and anxiety if a difficult situation
does present itself. Local teams will vary in name and nature,
however, there will be a service that will be able to provide
further advice and support on the urgency of referral, and if
necessary
arrange
urgent
assessment
with
or
without
inpatient management. Discussions with the woman and
the multidisciplinary team must be documented thoroughly,
including exact words or phrases of particular concern and
your initial actions.
Inpatient treatment
It is estimated that 4% of women require inpatient treatment
and should be admitted to a specialist mother and baby unit.
These units are currently funded centrally by the specialist
commissioning
board.
MBRRACE
recommends
that
admission to a mother and baby unit should be considered
where a woman has the following:1
� Rapidly changing mental state
� Suicidal ideation (particularly of a violent nature)
� Pervasive guilt or hopelessness
� Significant estrangement from the infant
� New or persistent beliefs of inadequacy as a mother
� Evidence of psychosis.
Local mental health services
Maternity services are designed to allow women to choose
where to book for delivery, while mental health services tend
to serve geographical areas. Therefore obstetricians must
familiarise themselves with the relevant mental health services
local to the woman as the vast majority of women with
psychological difficulties or psychiatric conditions can be
managed in the community.
Box 4. Simple lifestyle advice for mild low mood and anxiety
Sleep hygiene:
� Waking and going to bed at the same time every day
� Avoiding coffee after 5pm
� Avoiding screens after 8pm
� Hot drinks, reading in soft light, meditation before sleep
Managing hyperemesis:
� Small regular meals
� Good hydration
� Ginger-based tea/biscuits
� Regular anti-emetics, reassure safe in pregnancy
Importance of regular gentle exercise:
� Engage in a class for social interaction
� A structured group physical activity programme

 Are there any risks associated with
discussing mental health issues?
Some professionals may fear that asking about mental
health
issues
may
antagonise
or
embarrass
patients,
however, this is not the case. While mental health is
still stigmatising and far too little is known about it in
the perinatal or postnatal period, evidence shows that
patients appreciate a holistic approach to their care and
wellbeing.10 From women with general anxieties to those
with
significant
psychiatric
diagnoses,
most
will
be
relieved that a professional has opened the topic and
provided a safe platform for discussion. Handled well, the
encounter with obstetricians can be helpful and, indeed,
therapeutic for women who are in this vulnerable stage of
their lives.
Discussing perinatal and postnatal mental health alerts
women (and their partners) to the signs and symptoms of
deteriorating mental health, and facilitates help-seeking
behaviour in this and subsequent pregnancies. There is no
evidence that discussing mental health or suicidal ideation
leads to an increased risk of self-harm or suicide,11 and in fact
it is known to decrease the rate of completed suicide. Your
input matters.
Exemplar model of good practice
The Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health launched
ten key messages for commissioners developing a perinatal
mental health service in April 2011.12 The full list of key
messages can be found online, but the key points are to:
� Ensure your community specialist perinatal mental health
team is closely integrated with an inpatient mother and
baby unit.
� Develop a regional perinatal mental health strategy
involving all providers of perinatal mental health care in
your area, including: maternity, general mental health,
parenting and infant mental health services; health visiting
services; clinical psychology services linked to maternity
hospitals; Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
programme or equivalent services; general practice and the
extended primary care team.
� Ensure a training programme is in place for non-specialists
in the local area who are involved in the care of pregnant
women and women in the postnatal period to identify
early those at high risk of a perinatal mental illness. These
include
general
adult
mental
health
professionals,
obstetricians,
general
practitioners,
midwives,
health
visitors and Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
programme or equivalent workers.
It is clear that the simple advice in this article complements
the above model of care. Additionally, it highlights the
continuing need for further engagement and funding by
professionals and commissioning bodies to promote mental
health care in the perinatal and postnatal periods.
Conclusion
This article has discussed the importance of using the
primary obstetric encounter to create an open, honest and
supportive platform to establish rapport and facilitate a
therapeutic
relationship
between
clinician
and
patient.
Example questions are given to help introduce the subject
of mental health, and facilitate the comfort of both the
obstetrician and woman in discussing this sensitive and
potentially stigmatising topic. Initial broad questions are
advised to assess symptom severity and breadth, while
specific and direct questions are needed to assess risk.
Simple lifestyle advice is given for mild anxiety and low mood
that empowers the obstetrician’s therapeutic impact. A brief
recap on the psychiatric history and examination is provided
to aid assessment. We have explored how active and easily
accessible communication between obstetricians, perinatal or
community mental health teams and general practitioners is
needed to optimise the effective management in these
multifaceted and complex disorders.
In conclusion, opening the conversation of perinatal
mental
health
increases
our
awareness
of
signs
and
symptoms, reduces stigma in recognising and accepting
mental health concerns, and facilitates timely help-seeking
behaviour. The obstetrician can play a key role in this
vulnerable time in a woman’s life by empowering her to talk
about what can be a terrifying experience. Box 5 summarises
the key points of this article.
