Background: Recently, school mobility was identified as a risk factor for psychotic symptoms in 
early adolescence. The extent to which this risk continues into late adolescence, and the 
trajectories via which this risk manifests, remain unexplored. 
 
Methods: Psychotic symptoms in 4, 720 adolescents aged 18 were ascertained by trained 
psychologists using the Psychosis-Like Symptoms Interview. Mothers reported on 
sociodemographic factors (i.e., family adversity, ethnicity, urbanicity) from pregnancy to 4 
years; child’s involvement in bullying at age 6 to 7 years; residential mobility at 11 years and 
school mobility at 11 to 12 years. Young people reported on their friendships at 8 years, and 
antisocial behaviour and cannabis use at 15 years. 
 
Results: School mobility across childhood significantly predicted psychotic symptoms at 18 
years (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.17; 95% Confidence Intervals = 1.06, 4.41). Within path analysis, 
school mobility (β=0.183, p=0.035); involvement in bullying (β=0.133, p=0.013); antisocial 
behaviour (β=0.052, p=0.004); cannabis use (β= 0.254, p=0.020); and female sex (β=0.420, 
p<.001) significantly predicted psychotic symptoms. Residential mobility (β=0.375, p<.001), 
involvement in bullying (β= 0.120, p= 0.022) and poor friendships (β= 0.038, p= 0.014) 
significantly predicted school mobility. Residential mobility indirectly increased risk of 
psychotic symptoms via school mobility (β= 0.069, p= 0.041). 
 
Conclusions: Children who move schools often are more likely to have experienced peer 
problems. School mobility, in turn, appears to be a robust marker for psychotic symptoms in 
late adolescence. Clinicians and teachers should consider school mobility as an important risk 
indicator for both peer problems and psychopathology.

Introduction 
Psychotic symptoms exist on a continuum within the general population (Zammit et al., 2014). 
Evidence indicates that psychotic symptoms increase risk of psychotic disorder (Poulton et al., 
2000; Rössler et al., 2007), and that sub-clinical and clinical psychosis share similar risk factors 
(Van Os, Linscott, Myin-Germeys, Delespaul, & Krabbendam, 2009).  Consequently, researchers 
have examined psychotic symptoms in community populations to further understand the 
aetiology of psychosis (Zammit et al., 2014). By capturing individuals earlier in the 
developmental trajectory, community studies facilitate the examination of prospective 
pathways to psychosis while incorporating a range of psychosocial risk factors (Boyd et al., 
2013).  
Several environmental risk factors have been associated with psychosis including 
residential mobility (Pedersen & Mortensen, 2001), urban upbringing (Pedersen & Mortensen, 
2001), bullying involvement (Schreier et al., 2009), socioeconomic disadvantage  
(Wicks, Hjern, Gunnell, Lewis, & Dalman, 2014), and family breakdown (Van Os et al., 2009). A 
common theme underpinning these risk factors is that they appear to elicit feelings of “social 
defeat,” or of being an outsider (Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2007). Within this context, non-
promotional school mobility (i.e., school moves not related to being promoted to the next school 
level) was recently identified as another risk factor for psychotic symptoms in early 
adolescence. Singh, Winsper, Wolke, and Bryson (2014) found that school mobility at age 9 was 
significantly associated with psychotic symptoms at age 12 following control for a wide range of 
confounders including family adversity items (e.g., single status, financial adversity, etc), 
urbanicity, bullying, poor friendships, ethnicity, sex, and residential mobility. DeVylder, Oh, 
Pitts, and Schiffman (2015), in contrast, did not find a significant association between school 
mobility and psychotic symptoms in adulthood in unadjusted or adjusted analyses.  Assessment 
of school mobility in this study; however, relied on retrospective reports from adults up to 25 
years later. Therefore, the extent to which school mobility prospectively predicts psychotic 
symptoms later in development, and the trajectories via which this risk may manifest remain 
 4 
 
unknown. This question warrants further investigation given the potential negative effects of 
school mobility on mental health (Herbers, Reynolds, & Chen, 2013) and the relatively high 
prevalence of school mobility observed across populations (DeVylder et al., 2015; Rumberger, 
2003).  
There are several plausible pathways via which school mobility across childhood could 
be linked to psychotic symptoms in late adolescence. First, school mobility could directly impact 
on the development of psychotic symptoms by triggering psychological (e.g., development of 
low self-esteem) or physiological (e.g., sensitisation of the mesolimbic dopamine system) stress 
responses (Cantor-Graae & Selten, 2005; Lodge & Grace, 2011). Second, school mobility could 
mediate associations (i.e., act as a link in a causal chain) between early risk exposures and 
psychotic experiences. School mobility and psychotic symptoms share a number of antecedents, 
i.e., bullying, poor friendships (Schreier et al., 2009; Sorin & Iloste, 2006) and residential 
mobility (Pedersen & Mortensen, 2001; Rumberger, 2003).  Thus, it is plausible that school 
mobility could be one potential mechanism underpinning the negative effects of these prior 
exposures on subsequent psychotic symptoms  (Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2007). Finally, school 
mobility could be an early risk factor triggering a causal chain of adverse events (Singh et al., 
2014). School mobility has a range of negative sequelae. In particular, it has been linked to 
substance abuse (DeWit, 1998; Gasper, DeLuca, & Estacion, 2010) and antisocial behaviour 
(Ellickson & McGuigan, 2000; Herbers et al., 2013; Rumberger, 2003). As these two factors are 
robustly linked to the development of psychosis (Arseneault et al., 2002; Rössler et al., 2007; 
Vermeiren, 2003; Winsper et al., 2013), one route via which school mobility could increase the 
risk of psychotic symptoms is by increasing the risk of substance abuse and antisocial 
behaviour.   
 
Similarly, residential mobility could contribute to the development of psychotic 
symptoms via indirect pathways. Studies indicate that home moves and psychosis share similar 
risk factors including family adversity (Sorin & Iloste, 2006; Stilo et al., 2013), ethnicity 
(Morgan, Charalambides, Hutchinson, & Murray, 2010; Sorin & Iloste, 2006), and urbanicity  
 5 
 
(Pedersen & Mortensen, 2001; Sorin & Iloste, 2006). Therefore, a deeper examination of the 
effects of school mobility on psychotic symptoms  should consider both independent and 
overlapping risk pathways involving residential and school mobility (Pedersen & Mortensen, 
2001).   
In the current study, we aimed to add to the extant literature by testing long-term 
associations between school mobility in childhood and psychotic symptoms in late adolescence, 
while incorporating developmentally salient confounders including antisocial behaviour 
(Winsper et al., 2013) and cannabis use (Arseneault et al., 2002). We utilised path analytical 
methods to allow us to test several potential pathways simultaneously. Path analysis allows for 
the examination of the direct and indirect (i.e., mediational) effects of multiple independent and 
dependent variables within one comprehensive model (Stage, Carter, & Nora, 2004; Yanos, Roe, 
Markus, & Lysaker, 2015). Specifically, we addressed the following questions: 
 
1) Does school mobility independently increase the risk of psychotic symptoms in late 
adolescence (after adjustment for all other risk factors)? 
 
2) Does school mobility indirectly increase the risk of psychotic symptoms via an increased risk 
of antisocial behaviour and cannabis use? 
 
3) Are associations between early risk factors (i.e., involvement in bullying, poor friendships, 
residential mobility) and psychotic symptoms mediated by school mobility? 
 
4) Are associations between early risk factors (i.e., ethnicity, urbanicity, family adversity) and 
psychotic symptoms mediated by residential mobility? 
 
See Figure 1 for a theoretical representation of the research questions addressed 
simultaneously within the final model.

Methods 
Participants 
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a UK birth cohort examining 
the determinants of development, health and disease during childhood and beyond. The study 
has been described in detail elsewhere (Boyd et al., 2013). ALSPAC recruited pregnant women 
in Avon with expected dates of delivery between the 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992. 
14,541 pregnant women were initially enrolled in the study, and had returned at least one 
questionnaire or attended a “Children in Focus” clinic by the 19th July 1999. Of these initial 
pregnancies, there were 14,676 foetuses, resulting in 14,062 live births of which 13,988 
children were alive at 1 year of age. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years old, 
the sample was bolstered with eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally. 
Consequently, when considering variables collected from the age of seven onwards there are 
data available on 14,701 children (an additional 713 children). The study website contains 
details of all of the data that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary 
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/ data-access/data-dictionary/). The phases of 
enrolment are described in more detail in Boyd et al. (2013). Ethical approval was obtained 
from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics committee and the local research ethics committees. 
Measures 
Psychotic symptoms 
Psychotic symptoms at age 18 were assessed by trained psychology graduates with the semi-
structured Psychosis-Like Symptom Interview (Zammit et al., 2014). The interview comprises 11 
core questions to ascertain key psychotic symptoms occurring since age 12, i.e., hallucinations 
(visual and auditory); delusions (spied on, persecution, thoughts read, reference, control and 
grandiosity); and experiences of thought interference (broadcasting, insertion and withdrawal). 
Unspecified delusions were also rated. Experiences were rated as not present, suspected or 
definitely present (if a clear example was provided). Interviewers recorded audio interviews at 
three time-points (approximately 6 months apart) to test for interrater reliability. The average 
 7 
 
kappa value of psychotic experiences was 0.83. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 162 
adolescents re-interviewed after approximately 47 days (kappa=0.76, Se=0.078), 46 of whom 
were re-interviewed by the same interviewer (kappa=0.86, SE=0.136). As responses were 
highly skewed (i.e., very few for higher frequencies) and to remain consistent with the extant 
literature, we constructed our outcome variable to represent the presence of one or more 
definite psychotic symptoms (Schreier et al., 2009; Zammit et al., 2014).  
School mobility 
Mothers were asked how many different schools their child had attended when children were 
approximately 11 to 12 years. Most children experienced one, two or three school changes. This 
reflects normal progression through the English school system, typically beginning with 
reception class at 5 years (American equivalent: kindergarten); primary school from 6 to 11 
years (American equivalent: elementary school) and secondary school from 11 to 16/18 years 
(American equivalent: high school). We constructed a dichotomous school mobility variable, as 
the distribution of responses was highly skewed and we wanted to specifically test associations 
with school moves outside of normal school progression. “No school mobility” was coded as 0, 1, 
2 or 3 different schools and “school mobility” as four or more different schools. Consistent with 
previous research, the threshold of four was selected (DeVylder et al., 2015). 
Involvement in bullying 
Involvement in bullying was mother-reported when children were approximately 6.8 years of 
age. Mothers responded to the following statements: “she/he often fights with other children or 
bullies them,” and “she/he is picked on or bullied by other children.” Responses were coded as: 
“not true” = 0; “somewhat true” or “certainly true”= 1. In line with previous research (Winsper, 
Lereya, Zanarini, & Wolke, 2012), we combined these variables to create an involvement in 
bullying indices: 0=no involvement in bullying; 1=involvement as a bully; 2=involvement as a 
victim; and 3 = involvement as both a bully and victim. 
Poor friendships 
 8 
 
Friendship quality was self-reported during clinic sessions when children were approximately 8 
years old. Questions were based on the Cambridge Hormones and Moods Project Friendship 
Questionnaire (Goodyer, Wright, & Altham, 1990). Children were asked five questions: “Are you 
happy with the number of friends you’ve got (0 = very happy; 1=quite happy; 2 = quite unhappy; 
3 = unhappy);” “How often do you see your friends outside of school (0=almost every day; 1= 
>once a week; 2 = <once a week; 3 = hardly ever);” “Do your friends understand you (0=most of 
time; 1 = sometimes; 2 = not often; 3 = not at all);” “Do you talk to your friends about problems 
(0= most of time; 1 = sometimes; 2 = not often; 3 = not at all);” “Overall how happy are you with 
your friends (0 = very happy; 1=quite happy; 2 = quite unhappy; 3 = unhappy).” Responses were 
summed to create a continuous friendship scale from 0 to 15, with 0 denoting the most positive 
friendship score, and 15 the poorest (Singh et al., 2014).  
Antisocial behaviour 
Antisocial behaviour was self-reported during clinics at approximately 15 years. 
Adolescents were presented with 22 items (e.g., “Frequency young person has written things or 
sprayed paint on property that did not belong to them). A full list of items is presented (see 
Table S1 available online). Responses to each item were coded as: 0 (“not at all” or “just once”) 
and 1 (“2-5 times” or “6+ times”) (Kline, 2013). Item responses were summed, creating a 
continuous scale ranging from 0 to 22, with higher scores denoting more antisocial behaviour. 
Cannabis use 
Cannabis use was self-reported during clinics at approximately 15 years. Young people were 
asked if they had ever taken cannabis and if yes, how often. We constructed a variable 
representing regular cannabis use coded as: 0 = no use (i.e., not applicable, once twice ever, 
used to take sometimes never now; sometimes, less than once a week) and 1 = at least weekly 
use (i.e., 1-6 times a week; >6 times a week, not every day; to every day). We constructed a 
dichotomous cannabis variable with a threshold of at least weekly, as weekly use has been 
indicated as  a strong predictor of psychosis risk (Henquet et al., 2004). 
Residential mobility 
 9 
 
Home moves were mother reported when the child was 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 years old. 
Responses at each time-point were summed to derive the total number of home moves. 
Because of the skewed distribution of responses (very few responses for higher frequencies), 
we constructed a dichotomous variable consistent with previous reports. Unlike school 
progression changes (e.g., nursery to reception) home moves are not normative; therefore, we 
chose a lower threshold of 2 or more to indicate residential mobility (Singh et al., 2014). 
Ethnicity 
Child’s ethnicity was based on the ethnicity of the mother and her partner. If the mother 
and/or her partner reported non-white ethnicity the child was coded as non-white (Singh et al., 
2014).  
Family Adversity 
Multiple family risk factors were assessed using the Family Adversity Index (FAI) during 
pregnancy (‘long index’), 2 years (‘long index’), and 4 years (‘short index’). The 
FAI ‘long index’ has 18 items, e.g., maternal affective disorder, financial difficulties (see Winsper, 
Zanarini, and Wolke (2012) for a full description). The short index has the same items, with the 
exception of 3 excluded items: social, practical and financial support. If an adversity item was 
reported, it was given one point. Points were summed for a total FAI score at each time-point. 
Consistent with previous research (Wolke, Schreier, Zanarini, & Winsper, 2012), we summed 
the three FAI indices.  
Urbanicity 
Urbanicity was ascertained at birth and coded as in previous studies: 0 = village/hamlet; 
1 = urban/town (Zammit et al., 2009). 
Analysis 
Missing data 
As a substantial proportion of the original sample was lost to follow-up, we conducted logistic 
regressions to identify significant predictors of attrition. Adolescents lost to attrition were more 
often boys, of ethnic minority and low birth weight. They more often lived in rented properties, 
 10 
 
and were born to single mothers of lower educational level (See Table S2 available online). 
Using the variables associated with selective dropout as the predictors we fitted a logistic 
regression model (non-response vs. response outcome) to determine weights for each 
individual using the inverse-probability of response (Kinner, Alati, Najman, & Williams, 2007). 
We then compared results from the weighted and unweighted analysis.  
Logistic regressions 
Using SPSS version 22, we conducted unadjusted and adjusted (forced entry method) logistic 
regressions to examine which risk factors were associated with psychotic symptoms at 18 
years. We conducted regressions (logistic and linear) to examine the characteristics of children 
who had moved school often. Results are reported as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence 
Intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and β coefficients with 95% CIs for continuous 
outcomes. 
Path analysis 
We conducted path analysis using Mplus version 6. Path analysis is a method that can be used to 
determine whether a set of non-experimental data fit well with an a priori causal model.  
Modelled associations are unidirectional, and based on the temporal ordering of assessments 
(i.e., earlier risk factors are hypothesised to predict later outcomes). However, because the data 
are non-experimental, we cannot conclusively ascertain whether associations are causal (Stage 
et al., 2004).  Path analysis allowed us to control for multiple associations between pre-existing 
risk factors, school mobility, subsequent risk factors, and psychotic symptoms; and to examine 
direct and indirect (i.e., mediational) associations between risk factors and psychotic symptoms 
(Lleras, 2005). We used probit estimation as recommended for path models with both 
categorical and continuous variables (Winship & Mare, 1983). Probit regression is a log-linear 
approach analogous to logistic regression producing similar chi-square statistics, p values and 
conclusions to logit models (Allison, 2012). Coefficients indicate the strength of the relationship 
between the predictor variable and the probability of group membership, representing the 
change in the probability of “caseness” associated with a unit change in the independent 
 11 
 
variable. Thus, it is important to keep the scale of the predictor in mind when interpreting 
results. For example, a probit coefficient of 0.053 indicates that each one point increase in the 
antisocial behaviour scale resulted in an increase of 0.053 standard deviations in the predicted 
Z score of psychotic symptoms. The WLSMV estimator (weighted least squares with robust 
standard errors, mean and variance adjusted) was used yielding probit co-efficients for 
categorical outcomes and linear regression coefficients for continuous outcomes. Missing data 
was accommodated using the reliable Full Information Maximum Likelihood method (Wiggins & 
Sacker, 2002). 
We modelled several simultaneous pathways to test our four a priori research 
questions. First, to confirm whether school mobility was independently associated with 
subsequent psychotic symptoms (Singh et al., 2014), we incorporated direct associations 
between all risk factors in the model and the psychotic symptoms outcome (see Figure 1a). 
Second, to test the extent to which school mobility indirectly increased risk of psychotic 
symptoms we modelled the indirect pathways from school mobility to psychotic symptoms via 
cannabis use and antisocial behaviour (see Figure 1b). Third, to test the role of school mobility 
as a mediator, we modelled indirect pathways linking involvement in bullying, poor friendships, 
and residential mobility to psychotic symptoms via school mobility (see Figure 1c).  Finally, we 
examined the indirect associations from ethnicity; urbanicity; and family adversity to psychotic 
symptoms via residential mobility (see Figure 1d).  
In order to test the robustness of our main hypothesised pathways, we also adjusted for 
other associations between variables included within the model. We regressed cannabis use and 
antisocial behavior on sex (Moffitt, 2001), family adversity (Thapar, van den Bree, Fowler, 
Langley, & Whittinger, 2006), bullying (Bender & Lösel, 2011), poor friendships (Sutton, Smith, 
& Swettenham, 1999), and residential mobility (Simpson & Fowler, 1994). We also controlled 
for inter-correlations between highly related risk factors assessed in close temporal proximity 
(e.g., bullying involvement with poor friendships (Wei & Jonson-Reid, 2011), and antisocial 
behaviour with cannabis use (López & Emler, 2011)).

Results 
Data were available on 4, 720 adolescents who completed the Psychosis-Like Symptoms 
Interview at 18. A total of 4.9% of adolescents reported at least one psychotic symptom. 
A total of 4.9% of children had moved school 4 or more times by the age of 11 to 12. The pattern 
of results from the weighted (using the inverse-probability of response) and unweighted 
analyses was very similar; therefore, we report the unweighted analysis here. 
Logistic regressions 
Adolescents who moved school often were significantly more likely to have moved home 
(OR=4.90; 95% CI=3.63, 6.64); been involved in bullying as a bully-victim (OR=2.89; 95% 
CI=1.50, 5.57); and experienced poor friendships (OR=1.07; 95% CI=1.00, 1.14). School mobility 
was not significantly associated with ethnicity (OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.65, 2.81) subsequent 
cannabis use (OR=0.80; 95% CI= 0.25, 2.58) or antisocial behaviour (OR=β = -0.004; 95% CI=-
0.43, 0.34). 
In unadjusted logistic regressions, female sex, family adversity, residential mobility, 
school mobility, being a victim only and a bully-victim, weekly cannabis use and antisocial 
behaviour were all associated with psychotic symptoms. Ethnicity and urbanicity were not 
significantly associated with psychotic symptoms. In adjusted logistic regressions 
simultaneously controlling for all other risks, female sex, residential mobility, school mobility, 
being a bully-victim, and antisocial behaviour independently predicted psychotic symptoms 
(see Table 1). 
 
Path analysis 
Fit indices indicated a very good model fit: X2 = 19.97, p= 0.17; RMSEA=0.01; CFI=0.99. After 
controlling for all variables (and inter-correlations between related variables), female sex, 
involvement in bullying at 6 to 7 years, school mobility at 11 to 12 years, and weekly cannabis 
use and antisocial behaviour at 15 years all predicted psychotic symptoms at 18 years. 
Involvement in bullying, poor friendships and residential mobility significantly predicted school 
 13 
 
mobility. Family adversity significantly predicted residential mobility (see Figure 2 which 
reports the significant direct pathways within the model). Residential mobility was indirectly 
associated with psychotic symptoms via school mobility (Table 3). Family adversity and male 
sex were indirectly associated with psychotic symptoms via cannabis use and antisocial 
behaviour (see Tables 2). 
 
Discussion 
Using a large community cohort we examined whether school mobility increases risk of 
psychotic symptoms in late adolescence, and the pathways via which this increased risk may 
manifest. Our findings extend the literature in two ways. First, we found that school mobility 
was independently associated with increased risk of psychotic symptoms in late adolescence 
following adjustment for a number of salient confounders. Second, we found that the association 
between residential mobility and psychotic symptoms was significantly mediated by school 
moves. This supports the previously untested hypothesis that there may be something about 
school moves, in particular, rather than residential moves per se that contributes to the 
development of psychosis (Pedersen & Mortensen, 2001). 
It is striking that school mobility across childhood remained a significant predictor of 
psychotic symptoms even after controlling for subsequent cannabis use and antisocial 
behaviour. Furthermore, this association was not significantly attenuated following adjustment 
for a range of early psychosocial risk factors, suggesting that school mobility may have long 
term effects on the development of psychotic symptoms reaching into late adolescence. While 
many studies have reported on the detrimental effects of school mobility on academic 
performance, behaviour problems, and high school drop-out (Herbers et al., 2013), few have 
focused on the impact on mental health. School mobility is stressful for children and adolescents 
(Pollari & Bullock, 1988; Rumberger, 2003). Mobile students have to cope with new peers and 
social expectations, and negotiate new academic standards and expected classroom behaviours 
(Rumberger & Larson, 1998). These tasks may prove particularly difficult for those with a 
 14 
 
history of peer problems (as observed in this, and other (Wolke, Woods, & Samara, 2009) 
cohorts). Once children become involved in bullying, the pattern tends to persist for months or 
years even when the child changes school (Sapouna et al., 2011). Within this context, repeated 
school moves, especially for those with pre-existing experiences of exclusion (i.e., peer 
difficulties, or recurrent home moves), may induce or exacerbate feelings of “social defeat” 
(Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2007). Social defeat, especially if chronic, may lead to physiological, e.g., 
mesolimbic alterations (Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2007) and psychological, e.g., external locus of 
control (South, Haynie, & Bose, 2007) alterations, both of which could increase risk of psychosis 
(Fisher et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2011). 
It is somewhat surprising that antisocial behaviour and cannabis use did not mediate 
the association between school mobility and psychotic symptoms. Unlike previous reports 
(Gasper et al., 2010; Herbers et al., 2013), we did not find a significant association between 
school mobility and antisocial behaviour or cannabis use. As hypothesised, these risk factors 
were associated with psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, they significantly mediated 
associations between male sex and family adversity and subsequent psychotic symptoms.  
It may be that school mobility in this general population cohort is associated with 
antisocial behaviours in the realm of peer relationships (Ellickson & McGuigan, 2000) rather 
than criminal acts and drug taking, which may be more characteristic of high risk populations 
(Herbers et al., 2013). Alternatively, links with antisocial behaviour may become apparent later 
in adolescence when there tends to be a peak in such behaviour (Monahan, Steinberg, Cauffman, 
& Mulvey, 2009). In view of the strong associations between delinquency, substance abuse and 
psychosis, this area merits further attention (Catalano, Oesterle, Fleming, & Hawkins, 2004). 
Despite finding an association between school mobility and psychotic symptoms, we did 
not identify any significant mediators of this association. In a previous study, the association 
between school mobility and psychotic symptoms in early adolescence was significantly 
mediated by involvement in bullying (Singh et al., 2014). Considering the significant 
associations between peer problems and subsequent school mobility in the current study, 
 15 
 
bullying involvement may likely mediate the school mobility-psychotic symptoms link later in 
the developmental trajectory. Future studies may consider further potential mediators such as 
cognitive dysfunction, e.g., externalised locus of control (Thompson et al., 2011) and resilience 
factors, e.g., academic performance (Keefe et al., 2006; Temple & Reynolds, 2000). 
Contrary to previous studies, we did not find significant associations between ethnicity 
and residential/school mobility (Sorin & Iloste, 2006) or psychotic symptoms (Morgan et al., 
2010). This is somewhat surprising, and may be partly attributable to the data available, which 
did not allow for a fine-grained analysis of ethnic type. Previous studies (Singh et al., 2015) have 
indicated variations in psychosis (and associated correlates) according to ethnic type (e.g., Black 
versus Asian) and migrant status (Cantor-Graae, Pedersen, McNeil, & Mortensen, 2003).  
Our study had limitations. First, although the prospective design of our study enabled us 
to model predictive pathways based on the temporal ordering of the assessments, we cannot 
conclusively establish the direction of causality (e.g., that bullying led to school mobility) as risk 
factors were assessed at just one time-point. We cannot rule out reverse causality for some of 
the associations or that another unexplored variable had effects on the outcome (Stage et al., 
2004). Nevertheless, we carefully planned our analysis grounded in the extant literature to 
reduce the likelihood of spurious results. As a related point, some risk factors such as bullying 
were only assessed fairly early on in the developmental trajectory, which may have resulted in 
mis-classification bias.  
 Second, due to the epidemiological nature of the cohort, school mobility was assessed 
with a single question. Therefore, the data did not allow us to differentiate between promotional 
(i.e., standard progression) and non-promotional school moves, or definitively determine 
whether school moves were attributable to home moves or school problems. However, our 
assumption that 4 or more school moves represent non-promotional school changes has face-
validity in view of the English educational system (i.e., reception/primary school/secondary 
school) (DeVylder et al., 2015). Furthermore, we examined several potential pathways to 
psychosis to delineate developmental routes according to home- (e.g., family adversity) and 
 16 
 
school-related moves (e.g., peer problems) respectively. Future studies may collect more 
detailed information on reasons for school moves to further elucidate the mechanisms via 
which school mobility may increase the risk of psychosis.  
Third, there was selective attrition in the cohort, reducing statistical power and 
potentially biasing results. However, previous simulations indicate that selective drop out may 
lead to an underestimation of psychiatric disorders but only have a small impact on predictor 
and outcome relationships (Wolke, Waylen, et al., 2009). Indeed, weighted analysis taking into 
account factors associated with selective attrition did not substantially alter the results. 
Nevertheless, drop-out may still limit the generalisability of the results. 
Fourth, as our study focused on environmental determinants, we did not incorporate 
endogenous factors such as neurodevelopmental impairment or genetic vulnerability into our 
analyses. Future studies may explore the complex relationships between environmental and 
biological processes, and examine associations between mobility related risk factors and 
specific types of psychotic symptoms, e.g., peer victimisation and paranoid beliefs (Bentall & 
Fernyhough, 2008). 
We found that school mobility is independently associated with psychotic symptoms in 
late adolescence, and that it may mediate the association between residential mobility and 
subsequent psychotic symptoms. While school moves as a consequence of moving home may be 
unavoidable, our findings suggest that reducing school-related mobility and its associated 
antecedents (e.g., peer problems) may help alter risk trajectories to psychosis. As poor 
friendships and bullying were found to predict school mobility, interventions aimed at 
improving school connectedness, in terms of improving relationships and increasing 
commitment to school performance (Catalano et al., 2004), may help prevent a cycle of 
peer/discipline problems and subsequent school moves. Equally important are programmes 
designed to help mobile students successfully establish themselves within new school 
environments (MacArthur & Higgins, 2007). Our findings highlight that teachers and healthcare 
professionals should be aware of mobile students as a high risk population.
