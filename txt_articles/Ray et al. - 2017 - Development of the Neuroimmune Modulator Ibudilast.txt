Current directions in medication development for alcohol use disorder (AUD) emphasize the need to identify novel molecular targets and
efficiently screen new compounds aimed at those targets. Ibudilast (IBUD) is a neuroimmune modulator that inhibits phosphodiesterase-4
and -10 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor and was recently found to reduce alcohol intake in rats by ∼ 50%. To advance
medication development for AUD, the present study consists of a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory
study of IBUD in nontreatment-seeking individuals with current (ie, past month) mild-to-severe AUD. This study tested the safety,
tolerability, and initial human laboratory efficacy of IBUD (50 mg b.i.d.) on primary measures of subjective response to alcohol as well as
secondary measures of cue- and stress-induced changes in craving and mood. Participants (N = 24) completed two separate 7-day
intensive outpatient protocols that included daily visits for medication administration and testing. Upon reaching a stable target dose of
IBUD (or matched placebo), participants completed a stress-exposure session (day 5; PM), an alcohol cue-exposure session (day 6; AM), and
an i.v. alcohol administration session (day 6; PM). Participants stayed overnight after the alcohol administration, and discharge occurred on
day 7 of the protocol. Medication conditions were separated by a washout period that was ⩾ 7 days. IBUD was well tolerated; however,
there were no medication effects on primary measures of subjective response to alcohol. IBUD was associated with mood improvements
on the secondary measures of stress exposure and alcohol cue exposure, as well as reductions in tonic levels of craving. Exploratory
analyses revealed that among individuals with higher depressive symptomatology, IBUD attenuated the stimulant and mood-altering effects
of alcohol as compared with placebo. Together, these findings extend preclinical demonstrations of the potential utility of IBUD for the
treatment of AUD and suggest that depressive symptomatology should be considered as a potential moderator of efficacy for
pharmacotherapies with neuroimmune effects, such as IBUD.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic and relapsing
condition marked by repeated alcohol use despite a host of
negative physical and psychosocial consequences. To date,
only four pharmacotherapies are approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of AUD, and these
medications are only modestly effective (Johnson, 2008).
Therefore, the development of efficacious medications for
AUD remains a high research priority. To that end, current
directions in medication development emphasize the need to
identify novel molecular targets for AUD treatment and to
more efficiently screen new compounds aimed at those
targets (Litten et al, 2012). Novel molecular targets for the
treatment of AUD include modulation of neurotrophin
signaling and neuroimmune function.
Neurotrophins, including glial-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are
essential for synaptic plasticity (Airaksinen and Saarma,
2002), neuron survival, and basic cell signaling, including
midbrain dopamine transmission (Altar et al, 1992; Lin et al,
1993). In rodent models of AUD, reductions in GDNF and
BDNF expression underlie dysfunctional striatal dopamine
signaling, increased motivation to consume alcohol, and
heightened alcohol reward (Ahmadiantehrani et al, 2014;
Barak et al, 2015; Carnicella et al, 2009a; Hensler et al, 2003).
Conversely, increases in GDNF and BDNF signaling restores
mesolimbic dopamine function, reduces alcohol self-admin-
istration, and attenuates relapse to alcohol seeking (Barak
et al, 2011, 2015; Carnicella et al, 2008, 2009b; McGough
et al, 2004). These results suggest that medications that can
increase GDNF and BDNF expression may be useful
treatments for AUD.

 Chronic
alcohol
consumption
produces
a
sustained
inflammatory state such that individuals with AUD have
increased neuroinflammation throughout the brain (He and
Crews, 2008), and elevated peripheral levels of proinflam-
matory cytokines have been proposed as a biomarker for
AUD (Achur et al, 2010). In turn, alcohol-induced neuroin-
flammation is thought to contribute to chronic drug-seeking
behavior as well as the behavioral and neurotoxic effects
of alcohol (Mayfield et al, 2013). In rodents, lipopoly-
saccharide-induced neuroinflammation produces prolonged
increases in alcohol consumption (Blednov et al, 2011), and
knocking out neuroimmune signaling genes attenuates
alcohol preference and self-administration (Blednov et al,
2012).
Alcohol-induced
proinflammatory
signaling
also
mediates acute motor impairment by alcohol (Wu et al,
2011), and chronic alcohol exposure produces long-lasting
neuroinflammation that is associated with sustained cogni-
tive and behavioral impairment, as well as brain damage
(Alfonso-Loeches et al, 2010). Neuroinflammation mediated
by glucocorticoid pathways is thought to increase vulner-
ability to stress-induced drug seeking and relapse (Frank
et al, 2011). In sum, a medication that reduces proinflam-
matory signaling may produce antialcohol and neuroprotec-
tive effects that may be beneficial for the treatment of AUD.
Ibudilast (IBUD; also known as MN-166, previously
AV411) has been used in Japan for asthma and cerebrovas-
cular disorders (Ledeboer et al, 2007). IBUD has been
recently advanced as a novel addiction pharmacotherapy that
targets neurotrophin signaling and neuroimmune function.
IBUD inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and -10 (PDE10)
and
macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(MMIF)
(Johnson et al, 2014). As PDE4 and MMIF are critically
involved in proinflammatory signaling (Calandra and Roger,
2003; Teixeira et al, 1997), and PDE10 negatively regulates
neurotrophin expression (Giampà et al, 2010), the inhibition
of these molecules by IBUD has been theorized to reduce
neuroinflammation and promote neurotrophin expression
(Johnson et al, 2014). In support, IBUD enhances neuro-
trophin
expression,
reduces
proinflammatory
cytokine
release, and attenuates neuronal death (Mizuno et al,
2004). Most important to the present study, IBUD has been
demonstrated
to
reduce
ethanol
intake
by
∼ 50%
in
selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) and high alcohol-
drinking (HAD1) rats both under conditions of maintenance
and relapse testing (Bell et al, 2015). These recent preclinical
findings for IBUD support prior studies indicating that
pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 and PDE10 decreases
alcohol intake (Blednov et al, 2014; Logrip et al, 2014; Wen
et al, 2012). These results suggest IBUD represents a
promising treatment for AUD; however, the safety and
efficacy of IBUD in combination with alcohol administration
has not been tested in humans.
In summary, the available preclinical data have advanced
neuroinflammatory and neurotrophin signaling pathways as
plausible pharmacotherapy targets for AUD. To advance
medication development for AUD, the present study consists
of a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled
human laboratory study of IBUD in nontreatment-seeking
individuals with current (ie, past month) mild-to-severe
AUD. Specifically, this study tests the safety, tolerability, and
initial human laboratory efficacy of IBUD (50 mg b.i.d.). The
a priori primary outcomes, as registered in clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02025998), were IBUD effects on subjective response to
alcohol, whereas secondary outcomes were IBUD effects on
cue-induced craving and on stress-induced craving and
mood. IBUD has been well tolerated in opioid users (Cooper
et al, 2015) and it reduced subjective response to metham-
phetamine administration in patients with methampheta-
mine use disorder (Worley et al, 2016). Therefore, it was
hypothesized that IBUD would be well tolerated, alone and
in combination with alcohol, and that it would reduce the
rewarding subjective effects of alcohol as well as cue- and
stress-induced alcohol craving and negative mood.
Given that neuroinflammation is increasingly implicated
in mood disorders (Miller et al, 2009; Moieni et al, 2015;
Raison and Miller, 2011), exploratory analyses were con-
ducted to test the effects of IBUD on mood ratings during
the
experimental
protocol as well
as
the
moderating
role of depressive symptomatology on the effects of IBUD.
AUD severity was considered in these exploratory analyses
given the putative overlap between severity of AUD and
depressive symptomatology (Heilig et al, 2010; Sinha et al,
2009).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A community-based, nontreatment-seeking sample of in-
dividuals with current DSM-5 AUD was recruited via online
and print advertisements in the Los Angeles area between
January 2014 and June 2015. The study protocol and all
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the University of California, Los Angeles. Inclusion
criteria were: (1) age between 21 and 65 years; and (2) meet
current (ie, past month) DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AUD
(mild, moderate, or severe). Exclusion criteria were: (1)
current
treatment
for
alcohol
problems,
a
history
of
treatment in the 30 days before enrollment or treatment
seeking; (2) DSM-IV diagnosis of dependence on any
psychoactive substances other than alcohol and nicotine in
the past 12 months; (3) a lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or any psychotic disorder;
(4) current use of psychoactive drugs, other than marijuana,
verified by a toxicology screen; (5) clinically significant
alcohol withdrawal symptoms as indicated by a score of ⩾ 10
on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-
Revised (CIWA-R); (6) pregnancy, nursing, or a refusal to
use reliable method of birth control (if female); (7) a medical
condition that may interfere with safe study participation
(eg, unstable cardiac, renal, or liver disease, uncontrolled
hypertension, or diabetes); and (8) AST, ALT, or GGT ⩾ 3
times upper normal limit.
A total of 138 individuals consented to participate in the
initial screening/eligibility visit. Of these, 62 were clinically
eligible and invited to complete a screening physical exam
and laboratory tests. Initial screen failures were primarily
because of not meeting diagnostic criteria for AUD and/or
meeting criteria for one of the exclusionary diagnoses. Of the
62 eligible participants from the initial screening visit, 47
completed a physical exam and 38 were deemed medically
eligible. A total of 32 participants were randomized to the
first study medication, 28 of whom completed the first
medication condition and 24 of whom completed the entire
Ibudilast for alcoholism

 study. Demographic characteristics and alcohol use variables
for the 24 completers are summarized in Table 1. This study
was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02025998).
Screening Procedures
Interested individuals called the laboratory and completed a
telephone-screening interview. Eligible callers were invited to
the laboratory, and after receiving a full explanation of study
procedures and providing written informed consent, they
completed the in-person assessment visit. At the beginning
of the screening visit, participants were required to have a
breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 0.00 g/dl (measured
by Alcotest 6510; Drager Safety Diagnostics) and a urine
toxicology test (CLIAWaived, 10-panel drug test; Medimpex
United) negative for all drugs (excluding marijuana). The
toxicology
panel
comprised
cocaine,
marijuana,
opiate
(heroin, morphine, and codeine), amphetamine, metham-
phetamine, PCP, benzodiazepine, barbiturate, methadone,
and oxycodone.
During the in-person screening visit, participants com-
pleted questionnaires on demographics, drug use history,
and psychological functioning. The following interviews
were
administered
by
trained
master’s-level
clinicians
supervised by a licensed psychologist (LAR): (1) the 30-day
Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) to capture daily alcohol use
over the 30 days before the visit (Sobell et al, 1988); (2)
CIWA-R (Sullivan et al, 1989) to assess for exclusionary
clinically
significant
alcohol
withdrawal;
and
(3)
the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (First,
2005) to assess criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence
and to screen for exclusionary psychiatric diagnoses. In
addition, the symptom of alcohol craving was added to the
SCID using an interview item from the SSAGA (Bucholz
et al, 1994), thus allowing for diagnosing participants on
AUD according to DSM-5 criteria (which is reported
herein). The craving symptom was required to be current
(ie, present within the past month). The Penn Alcohol
Craving Scale (PACS) (Flannery et al, 1999), the Beck
Depression Inventory II (Beck et al, 1996), and the Beck
Anxiety Inventory (Beck and Steer, 1993) were administered
during the screening visit.
Participants deemed
eligible
following
the
in-person
screening were invited to return to the laboratory to
complete a physical exam with the study physician (KM).
Participants were required to provide a negative urine
toxicology screen for all drugs (excluding marijuana) at the
time of the physical exam that consisted of clinical laboratory
testing (ie, a blood chemistry panel and liver profile) and an
electrocardiogram (EKG).
Medication Administration and Intensive Outpatient
Procedures
The study medication and matched placebo were provided
by Medicinova and dispensed daily by the UCLA Health
Pharmacy Investigational Drug Section that also managed
the blind. Medically eligible participants were then rando-
mized to receive the first study medication. Each participant
completed two separate 7-day intensive outpatient protocols
at the UCLA Clinical and Translational Research Center
(CTRC), during which they completed daily morning visits
with a research nurse to take the AM study medication under
observation and assessments of vital signs and side effects
(collected using an open-ended question format). At each
daily visit the study nurse completed BrAC and toxicology
tests. All samples were negative for alcohol and drugs (except
for marijuana)
during
the
course of the experiment.
Participants were asked to take the PM dose at home and
a riboflavin (50 mg) tracer was used to verify compliance and
all samples fluoresced during the trial. Although a recent
study has raised concerns regarding the use of riboflavin as a
tracer substance for compliance testing (Herron et al, 2013),
the fact that individuals knew they would be tested by the
study nurse on a daily basis may have accounted for all the
samples fluorescing in this trial.
To assess tonic levels of alcohol craving, depression, and
anxiety, the PACS, BDI-II, and BAI were also administered
at day 1 (intake) and again at day 7 (discharge) of each
medication condition. See Figure 1 for study flowchart.
IBUD was available in 10 mg capsules and participants
were titrated as follows: 20 mg (ie, two 10 mg capsules) b.i.d.
during days 1 and 2, and 50 mg (ie, five 10 mg capsules) b.i.d.
during days 3–6. Matched placebo was provided and
medication order was randomized and counterbalanced.

 0800 h during days 1–6. Upon reaching a stable target dose
on the study medication (or placebo), participants completed
a stress-exposure paradigm (on day 5; PM), an alcohol
cue-exposure session (day 6; AM), and an i.v. alcohol
administration session (day 6; PM), which started at 1300 h.
Participants stayed overnight at the CTRC after the alcohol
administration
and
clinical
labs
were
repeated
before
discharge (day 7) from each medication condition. The
protocol
required
a
minimum
7-day
washout
period;
however, the observed washout period was on average
16 days (mean = 16.58, SD = 10.44, range = 7–40). For safety
reasons, participants were instructed not to drink during the
medication period and abstinence was verified daily by the
study nurse using a breathalyzer, thus limiting the natur-
alistic alcohol use data for analyses. Although no positive
breathalyzer readings were obtained in the study, self-report
TLFB data indicated that five participants drank alcohol
during the medication period (four in the IBUD condition
and one in the Placebo condition).
Following completion of the entire study and immediately
before discharge on day 7 of the second medication
condition, participants completed a motivational interview-
ing (MI) session targeting alcohol use reduction and
supporting
treatment
seeking.
The
intervention
was
delivered by a master’s-level clinician under the supervision
of a licensed psychologist (LAR). Participants received $30
for completing the in-person screening visit and $10 for the
physical exam. Daily medication visits with the study nurse
were compensated at $20/each. Participants received $40
for
completing
each
stress-exposure
and
cue-exposure
session, and $100 for each alcohol administration session.
Participants who completed the entire study received a
$50 bonus. The total compensation for all study procedures
was $590.
Medication Dose Justification
Selecting 50 mg b.i.d. as the single target dose in this study
was based on safety considerations, preclinical, and clinical
data. Consistent with the primary goal of establishing safety,
IBUD was tested at the highest dose that may be used
clinically (50 mg b.i.d.) that in turn sets the stage for future
dose-ranging studies. In addition, all in vitro (Cho et al,
2010a; Gibson et al, 2006a; Mizuno et al, 2004), in vivo
animal (Beardsley et al, 2010; Hutchinson et al, 2009), and
clinical neuropharmacology studies of IBUD found efficacy
to be dose or concentration incremental—at least up to
80–100 mg/day doses and plasma concentrations. In essence,
it appears as though ‘more is better’ up to the current clinical
maximum safe and well-tolerated high dose of 50 mg b.i.d.
correlates with ~ 100 ng/ml or ~ 0.5 μM steady-state plasma
concentration
(with
daily
AUC
~ 1500 ng × h/ml)
and
~ 1.5 μM brain concentration. Furthermore, the half-life of
IBUD is ~ 19 h (Rolan et al, 2008), supporting b.i.d. dosing.
Relatedly, Rolan et al (2008) found that IBUD concentration
was 5–10 ng/ml after 4 days of the last b.i.d. dose, suggesting
that the washout period of ⩾ 7 days is likely sufficient to
prevent carryover effects.
Experimental Procedures and Measures
The following well-validated (Bujarski and Ray, 2016; Mason
and Higley, 2013) experimental paradigms were implemen-
ted to examine medication effects on subjective response to
alcohol, cue reactivity, and stress reactivity:
Intravenous alcohol administration.
The alcohol infusion
was performed using a nomogram developed and validated in
our previous work (Ray and Hutchison, 2004) (0.166 ml/
min × weight in kg for males/0.126 ml/min × weight in kg for
females). On testing day, the 6% alcohol solution was
compounded and dispensed by the UCLA Health Pharmacy
Investigational Drug Section. BrAC was monitored every 3 to
5 min and target BrACs were 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 g/dl.
Upon reaching each of the target BrAC, infusion rates were
reduced in half for testing. The duration of the ramp period
where BrAC was increasing was ∼ 14 min to reach the 0.02 g/dl
time point (SD = 2), 15 min to reach the 0.04 g/dl time point
(SD = 7 min), 22 min to reach the 0.06 g/dl time point
(SD = 8 min), and 25 min to reach the final 0.08 g/dl time
point (SD = 8 min). Participants were held at a stable BrAC
during testing for an average of 6–7 min at each target BrAC
point (ie, BrAC = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 g/dl).
An i.v. alcohol administration method was selected given
that it affords precise control over BrAC level that is a large
source of between-subject variability in oral alcohol challenge
studies (Ramchandani et al, 2009). This approach also
eliminates alcohol cues and reduces alcohol expectancy
effects that could nonpharmacologically influence the prim-
ary outcome of subjective response to alcohol.
The following measures were given at baseline and at each
target BrAC: (1) The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES)
that captures the stimulant and sedative subjective effects of
alcohol (Erblich and Earleywine, 1995; Martin et al, 1993);
(2) The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) that measures
state levels of alcohol craving (Bohn et al, 1995; MacKillop,
2006); (3) The Alcohol Rating Scale that captures ‘liking’ and
Figure 1

 ‘wanting’ of alcohol; and (4) The Profile of Mood States
(POMS; McNair et al, 1971) that was used to record positive
and negative mood states.
Cue reactivity assessment (CR).
CR, as well as the other
paradigms, were assessed at each medication condition such
that participants served as their own controls. This is
important as studies found that not all individuals with
AUD are cue reactive (Litt et al, 1990; Rohsenow et al, 1994;
Rubonis et al, 1994), and that instead between 50 (Laberg
and Ellertsen, 1987) and 70% (Rubonis et al, 1994) of
individuals with AUD respond to cues by showing a ⩾ 50%
increase in subjective alcohol craving. CR followed well-
established procedures (ie, Monti et al, 1987, 2001). Each
session began with a 3 min relaxation period. Participants
were then asked to hold and smell a glass of water for
3 min to control for the effects of simple exposure to any
potable liquid. Next, they were asked to hold and smell
a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage for three 3 min
trials. Order was not counterbalanced given carryover
effects that are known to occur (Monti et al, 1987).
Participants who were smokers were allowed a smoke
break immediately before and after the CR assessment. After
each

where 10 = most stressful) were used in script development
and traumatic experiences were not included. The stress
exposure consisted of 5 min tape-recorded scripts recounting
current and unresolved stressful events in the participants’
lives, including cognitions and physical feelings. At baseline
and
after
imagery,
participants
completed
the
POMS
recording positive and negative mood, and the AUQ,
assessing alcohol craving.
Statistical Analyses
To examine safety, side effects on IBUD vs PLAC were
compared using Fisher’s exact test that represents a variation
of the χ2 test appropriate for small cell sizes (ie, infrequent
events). Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess for
IBUD-related cardiovascular changes following administra-
tion of alcohol.
To examine human laboratory efficacy data, repeated
measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to
analyze the effects of IBUD on subjective response to alcohol,
cue-induced craving and mood, and stress-induced craving
and mood. For each test we were interested in the main effect
of Medication (IBUD vs PLAC), the main effect of Trial
(ie, baseline and target BrAC levels, pre–post cue exposure,
and pre–post stress exposure), and the Medication × Trial
interaction. To explore the moderating role of depressive
symptomatology, scores on the BDI-II collected during the
in-person screening visit (ie, a continuous measure, log-
transformed for normality) were subsequently added to each
model as a between-subjects factor with the goal of
examining depressive symptoms as moderators of IBUD
effects (interaction terms of interest were: Medication × BDI-
II and Medication × BDI-II × Trial). An identical approach
was used to probe for AUD severity as a moderator as it
conceptually overlaps with depressive symptomatology such
that individuals with higher AUD severity are expected to
report greater depressive symptoms. Finally, a set of analyses
of order effects were conducted for the purpose of probing
for carryover effects given the study’s within-subjects cross-
over design.

conditions were tested using Fisher’s exact tests.
aDuring the physical exam (ie, baseline), the participant’s WBC (5.32 × 10E3/μl)
was within reference range. After taking placebo (ie, day 7 of the placebo
condition), WBC dropped outside of reference range to 3.95 × 10E3/μl.
Participant’s WBC continued to fall below reference range (3.03 × 10E3/μl) after
taking IBUD (ie, day 7 of the IBUD condition) and completing all study
procedures. Laboratory exams repeated 2 weeks after study completion
indicated that the participant’s WBC (5.38 × 10E3/μl) had returned to baseline

Regulatory Activities (MedDRA Version 14.0) terminology,
are presented in Table 2. More participants reported at least
one adverse event while on IBUD relative to placebo (Fisher’s
exact po0.001). In terms of individual adverse events,
significant differences between IBUD and placebo were only
observed for headaches (Fisher’s exact po0.05), and at a
trend-level effect for general gastrointestinal disorders (Fish-
er’s exact p = 0.090), both of which were more frequent on
IBUD vs PLAC. Comparisons of the results from the blood
chemistry panel and liver profile, obtained at day 1
(intake) and day 7 (discharge) for each medication condi-
tion, revealed that one participant experienced a decrease in
white blood cell count on the IBUD condition. All other
clinical labs were within range for all participants at
discharge from both IBUD and placebo conditions. Overall,
IBUD was well tolerated, and there were no study dropouts
directly related to IBUD as well as no dose reductions during
the protocol.
To test whether IBUD would increase alcohol-induced
nausea as compared with placebo, participants rated their
feelings of nausea at each BrAC level during alcohol adminis-
tration. Analyses revealed no significant main effect of
Medication (F(1, 22) = 0.38, p = 0.544) or BrAC (F(4, 88) =
0.91, p = 0.462); however, there was a trend-level Medica-
tion × BrAC interaction (F(4, 88) = 2.11, p = 0.0857), suggest-
ing that IBUD may increase feelings of nausea at rising BrAC
levels. Of note, none of the participants vomited during the
alcohol administration protocol.
To determine whether IBUD would affect cardiovascular
function in the context of alcohol intake, heart rate and blood
pressure were monitored during the alcohol administration
at baseline and at each target BrAC level. Overall, IBUD
produced a trend-level reduction in heart rate relative to
placebo (Med main effect: F(1, 21) = 3.55, p = 0.074), but
IBUD did not moderate the effect of alcohol on heart rate
(Med × BrAC: F(4, 84) = 0.37, p = 0.83). No effects of IBUD
were observed on systolic or diastolic blood pressure as
either a main effect or as a moderator of alcohol’s effect
across rising BrACs (p’s ⩾ 0.35).
Analyses of Primary and Secondary Aims
Alcohol administration.
The infusion of alcohol signifi-
cantly increased levels of craving for alcohol (F(4, 88) = 8.73,
po0.001), stimulation (F(4, 88) = 8.20, po0.001), sedation
(F(4, 88) = 8.20, po0.001), positive mood (F(4, 88) = 4.18,
po0.01), ‘liking’ (F(4, 88) = 45.89, po0.001), and ‘wanting’
(F(4, 88) = 7.15, po0.001), and decreased negative mood (F
(4, 88) = 5.01, po0.01). Averaging across the alcohol admin-
istration (ie, across rising BrAC levels), IBUD vs PLAC did
not affect subjective response to alcohol as indexed by
alcohol
craving,
stimulation,
sedation,
positive
mood,
negative mood, ‘liking’ of the alcohol, and ‘wanting’ the
alcohol (medication main effect p’s ⩾ 0.17, medication ×
BrAC interaction: p’s ⩾ 0.14).
Cue-exposure paradigm.
Presentation
of
alcohol
cues
increased craving for alcohol (F(1, 22) = 43.56, po0.001)
but did not affect either positive or negative mood (p’s ⩾
0.26). The medication main effects did not reach statistical
significance for the outcomes of alcohol craving, positive
mood, and negative mood (p’s ⩾ 0.38). However, a trend-
level Medication × Cue interaction was observed with respect
to positive mood (F(1, 22) = 3.62, p = 0.07), such that IBUD
vs placebo marginally increased positive mood during
alcohol cue presentation vs water. The Medication × Cue
interaction was not significant for craving or negative mood
(p’s ⩾ 0.14).
Stress-exposure paradigm.
As expected, the stress imagery
paradigm
increased
craving
for
alcohol
(F(5, 115)=3.50,
po0.01), increased negative mood (F(5, 115)=6.80, po0.001),
and decreased positive mood (F(5, 115)=3.62, po0.01). A
trend-level Medication×Trial interaction was observed with
respect to positive mood (F(5, 115)=2.19, p=0.06), such that
IBUD produced a more rapid recovery in positive mood to
baseline levels following stress exposure as compared with
placebo (Figure 2). IBUD did not affect alcohol craving or
negative mood during the stress imagery either as a main effect
(p’s⩾0.58) or over time (p’s⩾0.93).
Exploratory analyses
Alcohol administration.
A main effect of depressive
symptomatology, as measured by a log-transformed BDI-II
score (to account for data nonnormality), was observed with
respect to positive mood (F(1, 21) = 7.86, po0.05) and
stimulation
at
a
trend
level
(F(1, 21) = 3.83,
p = 0.06).
Furthermore, BDI-II scores moderated the effect of IBUD
(ie, BDI-II × Medication interaction) on the outcomes of
stimulation (F(1, 21) = 4.78, po0.05; Figure 3a), negative
mood (F(1, 21) = 4.47, po0.05; Figure 3c), and at a trend-
level positive mood (F(1, 21) = 3.67, p = 0.07; Figure 3b). In
addition, BDI-II score moderated the effect of IBUD on
alcohol-induced responses (ie, BDI-II × Medication × BrAC
interaction) on positive mood (F(4, 84) = 2.87, po0.05; also
in Figure 3b) as well ‘liking’ (F(4, 84) = 2.35, p = 0.06) and
‘wanting’ (F(4, 84) = 3.17, po0.05) of alcohol (Figure 4).
Overall, these BDI-II × Medication interactive effects were
such that IBUD decreased positive mood, stimulation,
‘liking,’
and
‘wanting,’
and
increased
negative
mood
responses to alcohol to a greater extent among participants
with higher BDI-II scores. Log-transformed BDI-II was

 entered as a continuous covariate into the repeated measures
ANOVA models. High and low groups were only created for
the purpose of visually plotting the results, based on a
median split.
Cue exposure.
Depressive symptomatology, measured
by the BDI-II, predicted the overall level of positive mood
during the cue paradigm (F(1, 21) = 6.85, po0.05), yet BDI-
II score did not significantly affect alcohol craving and mood
during cue exposure (p’s ⩾ 0.26).
Stress exposure.
BDI-II score predicted levels of positive
mood during the stress exposure (F(1, 22) = 8.42, po0.01),
but was not a significant moderator of alcohol craving,
positive
mood, and negative
mood
during
the
stress
paradigm (p’s ⩾ 0.12).
Pre–post medication measures.
In order to test tonic
effects of IBUD on alcohol-related phenotypes, craving
(PACS),
depression
(BDI-II),
and
anxiety
(BAI)
were
measured on day 1 and day 7 of each medication. Specifically,
a series of repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted
on these outcomes across time (day 1 vs day 7), treatment
(IBUD vs Placebo), and their interaction. Across medication
conditions, decreases in tonic levels of alcohol craving
(F(1, 21) = 6.15,
po0.05),
depression
(F(1, 20) = 12.76,
po0.01), and anxiety (F(1, 18) = 6.73, po0.05) were observed
from day 1 to day 7, thus suggesting that IBUD was not
depressogenic. Interestingly, IBUD produced a greater reduc-
tion in tonic alcohol craving over the course of the study
than placebo (Figure 5; (F(1, 21) = 4.55, po0.05). Depressive
symptomatology did not moderate the effect of IBUD on
alcohol craving or anxiety (p’s ⩾ 0.17).

the analyses examined depressive symptomatology (ie, log-transformed BDI-II scores) as a continuous predictor.

 Relationship between Depressive Symptomatology and
AUD Severity
Because depressive symptomatology conceptually overlaps
with AUD severity, we examined the correlation between the
log-transformed BDI-II score and AUD severity (indexed by
symptom count) and found it to be in the small-to-moderate
range (r = 0.34, p = 0.095), suggesting that ∼ 11% of the
variance between BDI-II and AUD severity is shared. In
addition, we tested AUD severity (ie, AUD symptom count)
as a moderator of IBUD effects in the laboratory paradigms
(ie, primary aims) and found no significant moderator
effects. Furthermore, we restricted our analyses to patients
with moderate-or-severe AUD (sample size = 15) and found
only one significant Medication × BrAC effect on Sedation (F
(4, 52) = 3.74, p = 0.0095), such that IBUD increased alcohol-
induced sedation compared with placebo in this subsample
of moderate-to-severe AUD cases. On balance, our results
suggest that AUD severity did not significantly alter the
results presented herein nor did it serve as a robust
moderator of IBUD effects in this trial.
Probing for Order Effects
Given
that
carryover
effects
may
be
an
issue
with
neuroimmune modulators, such as IBUD, several analyses
were conducted to rule out medication order effects. First,
medication order was entered as a covariate in all laboratory
early efficacy analyses reported above and the results
remained unchanged. Similarly, medication order did not
alter the results of pre–post medication effects on alcohol-
related measures as well as stress- and cue-exposure
paradigms. Furthermore, Medication × Order interactions
were tested and there were significant effects on Stimulation
and Sedation during the alcohol administration (p = 0.0095

Alcohol ‘Liking’ and ‘Wanting’ in response to alcohol is affected by the administration of IBUD and levels of depressive symptomatology. For ease

depressive symptomatology (ie, log-transformed BDI-II scores) as a continuous predictor.

 and 0.0226, respectively). However, the direction of these
effects was counter what would be expected from a carryover
effect. Specifically, for stimulation, the difference between
Placebo and IBUD was greater when IBUD was given first
(F(1, 10) = 11.43,
p = 0.007)
than
when
it
was
given
second (F(1, 11) = 1.18, p = 0.30). This pattern of results
was also observed with respect to Sedation (IBUD first:
F(1, 10) = 5.08,
p = 0.048;
Placebo
first:
F(1, 11) = 0.88,
p = 0.37). Second, between-subjects analyses were conducted
comparing
mood
variables
on
day
1
of
the
second
medication based on medication order and no significant
differences were found (p’s 40.10). Third, repeated mea-
sures ANOVAs were conducted to compare mood and
craving variables on day 1 of the first and second medication
to determine whether baseline levels at the beginning of each
medication condition were comparable. Results indicated a
significant decrease in BAI from the first to the second
medication condition (p = 0.009). This effect, however, was
not found to be significantly different between the two
randomization orders (ie, IBUD first vs Placebo first)
(F(1, 18) = 2.46, p = 0.14), such that anxiety was lower to
the same degree regardless of which medication was given
first. No other effects were statistically significant. Taken
together, these analyses provide no evidence of carryover
effects in this trial.
DISCUSSION
The present study tested the effects of IBUD, a novel
neuroimmune modulator, on subjective response to alcohol,
cue-induced and stress-induced craving, and mood among
nontreatment seekers with current (ie, past month) mild-to-
severe AUD. This approach is consistent with efforts to
screen novel compounds for AUD (Litten et al, 2012) as well
as with the use of human laboratory paradigms to advance
medication development by testing initial efficacy for alcohol
(Ray et al, 2010; Yardley and Ray, 2016) as well as drug
(Bigelow et al, 2012; Comer et al, 2013; Lofwall et al, 2014)
use disorders.
Results of the safety aim suggest that IBUD was well
tolerated in this study. Specifically, there were no study
dropouts directly related to IBUD as well as no dose
reductions over the course of the protocol. Analyses of
specific side effects revealed significant differences between
IBUD and placebo for headaches and a trend-level effect for
general gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the coadmi-
nistration of IBUD with alcohol was not associated with
significant changes in cardiovascular parameters, such as
blood pressure and heart rate. A trend-level effect for nausea
during alcohol administration suggested that IBUD may
increase feelings of nausea at rising BrAC levels as compared
with placebo. Together, these findings support the safety of
IBUD, at the 50 mg b.i.d. dose, in samples with mild-to-
severe AUD. This is particularly noteworthy given that
PDE-4 inhibitors, such as rolipram, have yielded promising
preclinical findings for AUD (Franklin et al, 2015) while
raising safety concerns during testing in humans. As
reviewed elsewhere (Palfreyman and Souness, 1996), PDE-4
inhibitors, including rolipram, are often associated with
gastrointestinal distress, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting within
their therapeutic window (Brunnee et al, 1992). These effects
are believed to be due to increases in gastric acid secretion
(Barnette et al, 1995) as well as central effects in brain areas
regulating emesis and the vestibular system (Duplantier et al,
1996). Although the effects of IBUD are not limited to
PDE-4, and include inhibition of PDE-10 and macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (Cho et al, 2010b; Gibson et al,
2006b; Mizuno et al, 2004; Suzumura et al, 1999), these
results support the potential application of IBUD to AUD
treatment in human clinical samples and are consistent with
recent safety studies for opiate (Cooper et al, 2015) and
methamphetamine (Worley et al, 2016) dependence.
In addition to safety testing, this study examined initial
efficacy markers using well-established human laboratory
paradigms of alcohol administration, cue exposure, and
stress exposure. Results for the alcohol administration
paradigm, which were the primary aims of the study,
revealed that IBUD did not alter the subjective responses to
alcohol in this sample. Nevertheless, when exploratory
analyses were conducted accounting for depressive sympto-
matology as a moderator of medication effects, results
indicated that IBUD decreased positive mood, stimulation,
‘liking,’ and ‘wanting’ responses, and increased negative
mood responses to alcohol to a greater extent among
participants reporting greater levels of depressive symptoms
on the BDI-II. Depressive symptomatology was advanced as
a moderator in this study in light of the suppressant effects of
IBUD on proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-
α) that in turn have been convincingly implicated in major
depression (Miller et al, 2009; Moieni et al, 2015; Raison and
Miller, 2011). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that
some of the beneficial effects of IBUD on efficacy markers
for AUD, such as alcohol craving and subjective responses,
may be, at least in part, due to its effects on mood.
Furthermore, it may be that greater levels of neuroinflam-
mation, putatively associated with mood dysregulation in
participants with high BDI-II scores, may be required for
IBUD to exert a stronger effect on both mood- and alcohol-
related end points. These results, however, should be
interpreted with caution as they represent exploratory
analyses as compared with the a priori analyses for this
study registered in clinicaltrials.gov.
Regarding medication effects on cue reactivity, which was
a secondary aim of this study, there was a trend-level effect
such that positive mood was greater when presented with the
alcohol cue while on IBUD relative to alcohol cue presenta-
tion on placebo. This finding, although trend level, is
generally consistent with results from the stress-reactivity
paradigm wherein positive mood recovered more quickly to
baseline levels following exposure to the stressful imagery on
IBUD as compared with placebo. Although there was no
effect of IBUD on the secondary outcomes of stress- or cue-
induced craving, analyses of the tonic alcohol craving,
measured by the PACS over 7 days of medication, indicated
that craving decreased significantly more sharply on IBUD vs
placebo.
Taken together, results from human laboratory paradigms
examining early efficacy markers revealed a pattern whereby
IBUD improved mood outcomes during stress and cue
exposure
as
well
as
lower
tonic
craving
during
the
medication period. Results for the effects of IBUD on the
alcohol administration measures were largely negative in this
study. A pattern of significant effects emerged only during
Ibudilast for alcoholism
LA Ray et al

Neuropsychopharmacology
 exploratory analyses whereby depressive symptomatology
was considered as a moderator. In that case, IBUD was found
to produce greater decreases in the stimulant and mood-
altering effects of alcohol only among individuals with higher
BDI-II scores. Importantly, these findings must be inter-
preted in the context of the overall mean for the BDI-II scale
at study entry (M = 8.04, SD = 9.03) that fell below the
clinical depression cutoffs. This pattern suggests that the
BDI-II score may be capturing subclinical mood dysphoria
in this sample that in turn is thought to be associated with
chronic alcohol use and AUD. As argued by the allostatic
model of addiction, dysphoric mood and stress dysregulation
may be particularly prominent at later stages of addiction
(Koob, 2009,2014). This is also consistent with a recent
proposal to characterize addiction in terms of three domains,
namely executive function, incentive salience, and negative
emotionality, each domain tied to a distinct phase in the
cycle of addiction (Kwako et al, 2016). This approach
emphasizes the role of negative emotionality, possibly
captured in this study through the BDI-II scores, in addiction
that is distinct from requiring a comorbidity between AUD
and depressive disorders. According to this approach,
medications such as IBUD may be useful in ameliorating
mood-related AUD symptomatology, and this may be
particularly useful at later stages of the disorder when
‘curing the blues’ represents a clinical priority (Heilig et al,
2010). Notably, the effects of IBUD were not moderated by
AUD severity, as captured by DSM-5 symptoms, suggesting
that mood symptomatology may capture unique variance in
IBUD response above and beyond AUD severity.
Although this study represents a step forward in develop-
ing IBUD for AUD, its mechanisms of action and associated
clinical implications remain unclear. Based on the preclinical
evidence, we expect IBUD to help individuals reduce
drinking and maintain abstinence in the short or long term.
Preclinical data suggest that restoration of GDNF and BDNF
signaling helps normalize mesolimbic and nigrostriatal
dopamine transmission, subsequently reducing motivation
to consume alcohol and relapse to alcohol-seeking behavior
(Barak et al, 2011, 2015). This should theoretically reduce
drinking and prevent relapse, consistent with the recent
preclinical findings by Bell et al (2015). In addition, blockade
of proinflammatory signaling reduces motivation to con-
sume alcohol (Blednov et al, 2011, 2012) and negative mood
states (Wright et al, 2005). The latter function should
theoretically promote a reduction in alcohol consumption
before abstinence as well as continued abstinence after the
cessation or attenuation of drinking. These hypothesized
clinical effects, however, are decidedly speculative as clinical
studies of IBUD for AUD have not yet been conducted
(outside of the present report).
The present results should be interpreted in the context of
the study strengths and limitations. Study strengths include
the novel study medication with strong preclinical data,
novel molecular targets, and compelling neurobiological
rationale. The crossover design allowed us to reduce error
variance by having individuals serve as their own controls,
and the combination of three well-established human
laboratory paradigms afforded an efficient screening of
medication effects on initial efficacy markers. The intensive
outpatient design consisted of daily visits including observed
medication intake that addresses medication compliance
issues
and
allows
for
careful
medical
monitoring
of
medication safety and side effects. Study limitations include
the moderate sample size, although adequate for an early-
phase laboratory study, and the subchronic level of IBUD
dosing. This study recruited a sample of nontreatment
seekers
that
may
not
generalize
to
treatment-seeking
individuals with AUD (Rohn et al, in press). Furthermore,
the inclusion of AUD of mild severity in this study may not
be representative of clinical samples (ie, requiring DSM-IV
alcohol dependence criteria or DSM-5 AUD moderate and
severe only), particularly when the pathology associated with
alcoholism is required for medications to exert clinical
effects. Therefore, future studies may be better served by
recruiting samples with more severe AUD than what was
represented in this human laboratory trial. Laboratory
measures, such as those employed in this study, may not
reliably predict clinical efficacy (Yardley and Ray, 2016) and
the i.v. alcohol administration method has limited external
validity compared with oral alcohol intake. Regarding the
monitoring of adverse events in this trial, an open-ended
questioning approach was selected. Although this approach
is relatively common in psychotropic medication trials
(Hughes et al, 2016), it also carries the potential for
underreporting of adverse events compared with scale-
based adverse event monitoring (Berlin et al, 2008). In
addition, multiple outcomes were examined without type I
correction. However, given that IBUD is a novel pharma-
cotherapy with unknown mechanisms of action for AUD, a
thorough screening of its potential effects was warranted.
Furthermore, the sample size only allowed us to detect
medium-to-large effect sizes, and a p-value correction may
have resulted in an overly stringent threshold that obscures
medication effects.
In conclusion, this is the first study of IBUD (50 mg b.i.d.), a
neuroimmune and neurotrophin modulator, for AUD in
humans. Results suggested that IBUD was well tolerated;
however, there were no medication effects on primary
measures of subjective response to alcohol. IBUD was
associated with mood improvements on the secondary
measures of stress- and alcohol-cue exposure, as well as
reductions in tonic levels of craving. Exploratory analyses,
however, found that among individuals with higher levels of
depressive symptoms, IBUD was superior to placebo in
attenuating the stimulant, rewarding, and mood-altering
effects of alcohol during alcohol administration. These
exploratory analyses, although interesting, should be consid-
ered with caution and future studies are needed to more
clearly ascertain the biobehavioral mechanisms of action of
IBUD for AUD as well as its clinical efficacy. On balance,
these findings extend recent preclinical demonstrations of the
potential utility of IBUD for the treatment of AUD (Bell et al,
2015) and suggest that depressive symptomatology should be
considered as a potential moderator of efficacy for pharma-
cotherapies with neuroimmune effects, such as IBUD.
