n the United States, >1 in every 3 adults (≈83.6 million) 
have ≥1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD); of these, 
42.2 million are >60 years of age.1 Several studies have 
observed inverse associations between regular physical activ-
ity (PA) and CVD,2–4 and a 2008 systematic review by the US 
Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded 
that active individuals have lower rates of CVD than their sed-
entary counterparts.5 Yet, although CVD is especially com-
mon later in life, this report suggests that relatively little is 
known about the association between PA and CVD in older 
adults. The great majority of previous studies were conducted 
in middle-aged participants, typically averaging 45 to 60 years 
of age.5 Only a few studies comprised individuals with median 
or mean ages exceeding 65 years,5–10 and few data were avail-
able for individuals aged ≥75 years.5
Clinical Perspective on p 155
The influence of different types of PA on CVD later in 
life may also be relevant. With advancing age, the ability to 
perform more intense PA might decrease in many older adults, 
making light to moderate exercise such as walking of greater 
importance as a means to meet recommendations. An inverse 
association between moderate PA such as walking and the 
incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in older 
adults would be important to identify, especially among those 
age ≥75 years, because walking is the most common type of 
PA later in life.
Given the relative paucity of data on PA and the risk of 
CVD in older adults, especially those at higher ages (≥75 
years), we investigated how habitual PA related to incident 
Background—Although guidelines suggest that older adults engage in regular physical activity (PA) to reduce cardiovascular 
disease (CVD), surprisingly few studies have evaluated this relationship, especially in those >75 years. In addition, with 
advancing age the ability to perform some types of PA might decrease, making light-moderate exercise such as walking 
especially important to meet recommendations.
Methods and Results—Prospective cohort analysis among 4207 US men and women of a mean age of 73 years (standard 
deviation=6) who were free of CVD at baseline in the Cardiovascular Health Study were followed from 1989 to 1999. PA 
was assessed and cumulatively updated over time to minimize misclassification and assess the long-term effects of habitual 
activity. Walking (pace, blocks, combined walking score) was updated annually from baseline through 1999. Leisure-
time activity and exercise intensity were updated at baseline, 1992, and 1996. Incident CVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, coronary death, or stroke) was adjudicated using medical records. During 41 995 person-years of follow-up, 1182 
CVD events occurred. After multivariable adjustment, greater PA was inversely associated with coronary heart disease, stroke 
(especially ischemic stroke), and total CVD, even in those ≥75 years. Walking pace, distance, and overall walking score, 
leisure-time activity, and exercise intensity were each associated with lower risk. For example, in comparison with a walking 
pace <2 mph, those that habitually walked at a pace >3 mph had a lower risk of coronary heart disease (0.50; confidence 
interval, 0.38–0.67), stroke (0.47; confidence interval, 033–0.66), and CVD (0.50; confidence interval, 0.40–0.62).
Conclusions—These data provide empirical evidence supporting PA recommendations, in particular, walking, to reduce the 
incidence of CVD among older adults.

CVD, including CHD and stroke, in the Cardiovascular Health 
Study (CHS), an established prospective cohort of older US 
adults with repeated measures of different types of PA and 
careful assessment of incident CVD.
Methods
Population
The design and recruitment of the CHS have been described.11,12 In 
brief, 5201 ambulatory, noninstitutionalized men and women ≥65 
years of age were randomly selected and enrolled from Medicare 
eligibility lists in 4 US communities in 1989 to 1990, and an addi-
tional 687 black participants similarly, in 1992. The institutional 
review committee at each center approved the study, and all partici-
pants provided informed consent. Between 1989 to 1990 and 1998 to 
1999 participants were followed by annual study visits. Standardized 
evaluations included physical examination, diagnostic testing, labora-
tory evaluation, and questionnaires on health status, medical history, 
and cardiovascular risk factors.11–13 From a total of 5888 participants, 
we excluded 1366 participants with prevalent CVD at baseline and 
315 participants with missing information on PA at baseline. In total, 
4207 participants were included in this analysis.
Assessment of PA
PA was assessed at multiple serial visits (Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Usual leisure-time activity was assessed by using 
a modified, validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities question-
naire,14,15 which correlates with objective and subjective PA and 
physical fitness measures (r=0.23–0.75)16 and has also been associ-
ated with risk of multiple disease outcomes in this cohort.17–21 The 
questionnaire evaluated the frequency and duration of 15 different 
activities during the previous 2 weeks, including gardening, mow-
ing, raking, swimming, hiking, aerobics, tennis, jogging, racquet-
ball, walking, golfing, bicycling, dancing, calisthenics, and exercise 
cycling.19 Each activity was defined as having an intensity value in 
metabolic equivalent task units,15 and participant responses regarding 
types, frequency, and duration of each activity were used to calcu-
late weekly energy expenditure (kcal/week) from leisure-time activ-
ity. Usual exercise intensity was also separately assessed: based on 
the highest-intensity leisure-time activity reported over the previous 
2 weeks, participants were categorized as having engaged in high-, 
moderate-, or low-intensity activity or none, where high-intensity 
activity was estimated to require >6 metabolic equivalent task units.19 
Usual walking habits, including average walking pace (gait speed) 
and distance walked, were assessed annually at each follow-up visit. 
We evaluated these metrics in prespecified categories, including: 
usual pace walked (<2, 2–3, and >3 mph), blocks walked (quintiles), 
exercise intensity (none, low, moderate, and high), and leisure-time 
activity (quintiles). A previously defined walking score was also 
evaluated based on the combination of walking pace and walking 
distance.21
Ascertainment of Cardiovascular Events
Participants were observed during annual examinations and interim 
6-month telephone contacts through 1999 and 6-month telephone 
contacts thereafter.22 Medical records, information from interviews, 
physician questionnaires, death certificates, medical examiner forms, 
Health Care Financing Administration hospitalizations, and available 
computed tomographic or MRI scans were reviewed by centralized 
cardiac and stroke adjudication committees to classify events.22,23 
Myocardial infarction was diagnosed using an algorithm including 
cardiac symptoms as chest pain, abnormal cardiac enzyme concentra-
tions, and serial ECG changes. Fatal CHD included deaths not meet-
ing criteria for myocardial infarction if occurring within 72 hours of 
chest pain or with previous history of ischemic heart disease. CHD 
includes fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death. 
Strokes were classified as ischemic if there was evidence of focal 
brain deficit without evidence of primary hemorrhage; hemorrhagic 
if there was bloody spinal fluid on lumbar puncture or evidence of 
blood in the subarachnoid space, ventricles, or parenchyma on brain 
imaging or at surgery or autopsy that did not appear consistent with 
hemorrhage into an infarction; or unknown type if information was 
insufficient for classification.24 For this analysis, the primary outcome 
was incident CVD, defined as combined incident stroke, fatal and 
nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death.
Covariates
 Information on a wide range of covariates was obtained during study 
visits, including demographics, education, income, detailed smoking 
habits, alcohol use, usual dietary habits, body mass index, blood pres-
sure, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, medication use, health status, 
and daily living activities and instrumental scores.11
Statistical Analyses
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risk during 
the follow-up period. Follow-up was calculated from enrollment until 
the first event, death, or loss to follow-up, whichever happened first; 
we censored all follow-up at 10 years given the absence of further 
serial updated information on PA.12 Less than 1% of all person-time

was missing because of loss to follow-up. PA was updated over time 
by means of cumulative averaging to minimize misclassification 
(measurement error) and to assess long-term effects of habitual activ-
ity. Walking (pace and blocks) was updated annually from baseline 
in 1989 to 1990 until 1998 to 1999. Leisure-time activity and exer-
cise intensity were updated using data from baseline, 1992 to 1993, 
and 1996 to 1997. Multivariable models were adjusted for potential 
confounding factors including age, sex, race, education, income, 
enrollment site, smoking status, and body mass index. Time-varying 
covariates were updated at the same time periods as the PA measures. 
We separately evaluated factors that might be potential confounders 
or mediators of the effect of PA, such as body mass index, diabe-
tes mellitus, hypertension, cholesterol levels, self-perceived health 
status, depression, arthritis, cystatin-C, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity.
We also conducted several sensitivity analyses to minimize bias 
attributable to reverse causation because of undiagnosed CVD. First, 
we performed analyses with a 3-year lag between the PA measure 
and incident CVD events. Second, we restricted analyses to par-
ticipants reporting only good, very good, or excellent overall health 
status. Potential effect modification was assessed by age, sex, and 
overall self-perceived health status in stratified analyses. Because 
PA is known to improve self-perceived health status, we recognized 
that the latter stratified analyses might represent overadjustment for 
a mediator of the causal effects.25 Finally, we performed analyses 
with mutual adjustment for walking score, leisure-time activity, and

exercise intensity, simultaneously in the model, to determine poten-
tial independent effects.
Analyses were performed using Stata 10.0 (College Station, TX), 
2-tailed α=0.05.
Results
At baseline, mean age was 72.5 years (standard deviation=5.5), 
61% were women, and 21.7% were nonwhite (Table 1). About 
4 in 5 (83%) reported good, very good, or excellent health 
status. During 41 995 person-years of follow-up between 1989 
and 1999, 1182 CVD events occurred.
When we evaluated different aspects of walking, a greater 
pace, distance, and an overall walking score were each associ-
ated with lower risk of CVD (Table 2). In comparison with a 
pace <2 mph, those that habitually walked at a pace >3 mph 
had 50%, 53%, and 50% lower risk of CHD, stroke, and CVD, 
respectively. Similarly, in comparison with individuals that 
walked 0 to 5 blocks per week, those that walked ≥49 blocks 
per week had 36%, 54%, and 47% lower risk of CHD, stroke, 
and CVD, respectively. When we assessed the combined 
effects of walking pace and distance by means of a prespeci-
fied walking score, a graded inverse relationship was evident 
with incidence of CHD, stroke, and CVD. Greater leisure-
time activity and exercise intensity were also associated with 
lower risk of CHD, stroke, and CVD. With ischemic stroke, 
the associations were similar. Significant associations were 
not observed for hemorrhagic stroke, but comprised only 74

Adjustment for factors that could be either potential confound-
ers or mediators, including blood pressure, blood lipid levels, 
and C-reactive protein, did not appreciably alter the findings 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Results were generally similar when stratified by sex, with 
similar associations between PA and CVD in both men and 
women (Tables 3–5). Results were also similar when strati-
fied by age, with similar findings in adults <75 years of age 
or aged ≥75 at baseline. Findings were not appreciably altered 
in sensitivity analyses including a 3-year lag between the PA 
measure and incident CVD (data not shown). To minimize the 
possibility of reverse causation, we also restricted our analy-
sis to participants reporting only good, very good, or excel-
lent self-perceived overall health status. Findings were not 
appreciably different (Figure, Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement). We also conducted post hoc analyses fully strati-
fied by self-perceived health status (excellent, very good, good, 
fair, poor). Associations appeared very similar in those report-
ing either excellent, very good, or good health status; and pos-
sibly weaker in those reporting only fair health status (Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Few participants (n=69) 
reported poor health status to derive meaningful conclusions 
in this category. Results were also not appreciably altered in 
several sensitivity analyses (data not shown), including further 
adjustment for characteristics that could be either confounders 
or mediators of these relationships (see Methods for listing).
When we mutually adjusted for each type of PA simul-
taneously, walking score remained significantly associated 
with lower risk of CHD, stroke, and CVD; exercise intensity

remained significantly associated with lower risk of CVD, but 
not CHD and stroke; and leisure-time activity was no longer 
significantly associated with CHD, stroke, or CVD (Table VI 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
In this large prospective study among US men and women 
who were on average age 73 years at baseline, greater walk-
ing, leisure-time activity, and exercise intensity were inversely 
associated with CHD, stroke (especially ischemic stroke), and 
total CVD. To our knowledge, this is the first large prospective 
community-based study including a large number of participants 
>70 years and having updated PA over time, to demonstrate 
independent associations of PA measures with lower incidence 
of CHD, stroke, and total CVD. Results were robust in a range of 
sensitivity analyses. When different types of PA were simultane-
ously evaluated, greater walking and, to a lesser extent, exercise 
intensity were independently associated with lower risk, whereas 
leisure-time activity was not independently associated with risk.
With aging, the risk of developing and dying of chronic 
diseases such as CVD increases dramatically.26 In many coun-
tries in the world, the proportion of the population >60 years

 Soares-Miranda et al  Physical Activity and Risk of CVD in Older Adults  153
is increasing faster than any other age group, and by 2050, 
older people are projected to outnumber children worldwide.27 
In addition, among older adults >60 years of age, 1 in 5 glob-
ally will be >80 years of age by 2050.28 Low PA at least partly 
defines frailty in the elderly, which is associated with worse 
health outcomes including loss of mobility, greater number of 
falls, and hospitalizations.29 It is clear that strategies to maxi-
mize health and functional capacity of older adults are needed 
to optimize health and quality of life, and maintain autonomy 
and independence, as well. CVD represents one of the greatest 
challenges to healthy aging, and our findings support a role for 
moderate PA later in life for reducing CVD risk.
Long-term regular PA provides numerous physiological 
benefits that provide biological plausibility to our findings. PA 
has a direct action on cardiac function by improving myocardial 
contraction, myocardial oxygen supply, and electric stability.30 In 
addition, most major risk factors for CVD are modified by regu-
lar PA, including blood pressure, atherogenic lipoprotein levels, 
adiposity (especially visceral fat), insulin sensitivity, endo-
thelial function, and inflammation.5 Some of the mechanisms 
for these benefits include skeletal muscle insulin sensitization, 
maintenance or building of lean muscle mass, and reduction in 
visceral fat, which together reduce adipose tissue infiltration of 
proinflammatory cells, increase the production and liberation of 
anti-inflammatory myokines, and reduce expression of Toll-like 
receptors on monocytes and macrophages.31
Studies in largely middle-aged populations have sug-
gested that moderate levels of PA, such as regular brisk walk-
ing, are associated with lower risk of CVD, including CHD 
and stroke.3,9,32–34 Our results are in agreement with these 
studies in predominantly middle-aged individuals and with 
a smaller number of studies focusing on adults >65 years of 
age.7–9,33,35–39 Only 2 previous studies focused on individuals 
aged ≥75 years,38,39 showing lower CHD or total mortality 
among those performing regular vigorous PA (≥2 times per 
week) in comparison with no vigorous PA.38,39 These 2 stud-
ies had a follow-up of only 18 months,39 only assessed vigor-
ous PA and not walking or leisure-time activity, and did not 
update PA over time using time-varying covariates to reduce 
misclassification and provide a better measure of habitual PA.

Our findings build on and considerably expand these previous 
results by evaluating cumulatively averaged PA; by assessing 
different components and types of PA; and by evaluating inci-
dence of CHD, stroke, and total CVD in a well-established, 
community-based cohort of older US adults.
The American College of Sports Medicine and American 
Heart Association recommend that older adults engage in at 
least 30 min/d of moderate PA on most days of the week, 
75 to 150 min/wk of vigorous intensity PA, or an equivalent 
combination of both.26 Our results provide support for these 
clinical recommendations, providing empirical evidence 
that moderate PA, in particular walking, is associated with 
lower risk of CVD later in life, even in those ≥75 years of 
age. The observed benefits for higher exercise intensity are 
consistent with mechanistic studies suggesting that exercise-
induced adaptation of cardiomyocyte maximal oxygen uptake 
and function/structure depends on exercise intensity.40 These 
results are also in agreement with previous studies where high 
exercise intensity was associated with lower risk of all-cause 
mortality among older men (mean age, 66 years)7 or CHD 
among health professionals.41
Our analysis had several strengths. Participants were ran-
domly selected and enrolled from Medicare eligibility lists 
in several US communities, providing a community-based 
sample of older adults, thus increasing generalizability. 
The distribution of self-reported health in our study is simi-
lar to a broad US cross section of contemporary Medicare 
enrollees,42 supporting the generalizability of our findings. 
Information on PA and other risk factors was prospectively 
assessed by using standardized methods and updated over 
time, reducing misclassification and providing a better mea-
sure of long-term habits. Adjustment for a wide range of 
major risk factors minimized the potential impact of residual 
confounding. CVD events were centrally adjudicated, with 
little loss to follow-up, reducing the possibility of missed 
or misclassified events. A large number of CVD, CHD, 
and ischemic stroke events provided statistical power and 
allowed confirmation of findings in key demographic sub-
groups, and sensitivity analyses, as well.
Potential limitations were also present. PA measures were 
obtained from self-report, and may appropriately reflect rela-
tive ordering (ranking) of participants but not precise quantita-
tive levels of energy expenditure. In addition, health status was 
based on self-report, with similar limitations and strengths. 
Although a range of covariates were available and evaluated 
as potential confounders, and findings were similar in several 
sensitivity analyses, residual confounding remains an alter-
native explanation for the findings because of unknown or 
incompletely measured factors that cannot be excluded.
These data provide evidence supporting PA recommenda-
tions, in particular walking, as a way to reduce the incidence 
of CHD, stroke, and CVD among older adults. Our findings 
for walking distance and pace are especially important given 
that walking is the most common type of PA later in life; 
increasing either pace or distance seems to provide benefits. 
These results support the need for clinicians and policy mak-
ers to focus on regular PA as a way to maintain and promote 
cardiovascular health in older adults.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
One in every 3 adults in the United States has ≥1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD); of these, about half are >60 years of 
age. National guidelines suggest that older adults engage in regular physical activity (PA) to reduce CVD, but surprisingly 
few studies have evaluated this relationship. Most previous studies were conducted in middle-aged participants, typically 
averaging 45 to 60 years of age. A small number of studies included individuals with average ages exceeding 65 years, and 
few data were available for individuals aged ≥75 years. We investigated whether usual PA, assessed by walking pace, dis-
tance, and overall walking score, leisure-time activity, and exercise intensity, was associated with the incidence of coronary 
heart disease, stroke, and CVD, among older adults with an average age of 72.5 years at baseline. After multivariable adjust-
ment for major CVD risk factors, greater PA was inversely associated with coronary heart disease, stroke, and total CVD, 
even in those ≥75 years. These findings provide evidence supporting PA recommendations, in particular walking, as a way 
to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, and CVD among older adults. Our findings for walking distance 
and pace are especially important given that walking is the most common type of PA later in life; increasing either pace or 
distance seems to provide benefits. These results support the need for clinicians and policy makers to focus on regular PA as 
a way to maintain and promote cardiovascular health in older adults.
