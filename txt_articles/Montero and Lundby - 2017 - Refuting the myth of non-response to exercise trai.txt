Key points
r The prevalence of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) non-response gradually declines in healthy
individuals exercising 60, 120, 180, 240 or 300 min per week for 6 weeks.
r Following a successive identical 6-week training period but comprising 120 min of additional
exercise per week, CRF non-response is universally abolished.
r The magnitude of CRF improvement is primarily attributed to changes in haemoglobin mass.
r The potential for CRF improvement may be present and unveiled with appropriate exercise
training stimuli in healthy individuals without exception.
Abstract One in five adults following physical activity guidelines are reported to not demonstrate
any improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Herein, we sought to establish whether CRF
non-response to exercise training is dose-dependent, using a between- and within-subject study
design. Seventy-eight healthy adults were divided into five groups (1–5) respectively comprising
one,two,three,fourandfive60minexercisesessionsperweekbutotherwisefollowinganidentical
6-week endurance training (ET) programme. Non-response was defined as any change in CRF,
determined by maximal incremental exercise power output (Wmax), within the typical error
of measurement (±3.96%). Participants classified as non-responders after the ET intervention
completed a successive 6-week ET period including two additional exercise sessions per week.
Maximal oxygen consumption ( ˙
VO2max), haematology and muscle biopsies were assessed prior to
and after each ET period. After the first ET period, Wmax increased (P < 0.05) in groups 2, 3, 4 and
5, but not 1. In groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 69%, 40%, 29%, 0% and 0% of individuals, respectively,
were non-responders. After the second ET period, non-response was eliminated in all individuals.
The change in ˙
VO2max with exercise training independently determined Wmax response (partial
correlationcoefficient,rpartial �0.74,P<0.001).Inturn,totalhaemoglobinmasswasthestrongest
independent determinant of ˙
VO2max (rpartial = 0.49, P < 0.001). In conclusion, individual CRF
non-response to exercise training is abolished by increasing the dose of exercise and primarily a
function of haematological adaptations in oxygen-carrying capacity.

Introduction
Primary sources regarding the notion of physical activity
as a means to preserve health emerged along with
the inception of scientific medicine in ancient Greece
(Potteiger, 2013). More than 2 millennia later, outstanding
health benefits associated with physical activity have been
demonstrated by modern experimental, epidemiological
and clinical sciences (Morris et al. 1953; Lee et al. 1995;
Church et al. 2007; Wen et al. 2011; Pedersen & Saltin,
2015). Daily vigorous exercise decreases cardiovascular,
metabolic and all-cause mortality by 40–70%, irrespective
of age, sex and presence of disease (Wen et al. 2011). Many
of these benefits are closely associated with improvements
in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), as determined by
maximal oxygen consumption ( ˙
VO2max) or incremental
exercise power output (Wmax), independent of traditional
risk factors (Joyner & Green, 2009; Lee et al. 2010). CRF
is thus considered a key surrogate endpoint of exercise
training interventions in healthy and diseased individuals
(Laukkanen et al. 2001; Kodama et al. 2009).
Among exercise training modalities, CRF is particularly
responsive to endurance training (ET). ˙
VO2max and Wmax
commonly increase by an average of �3–35% at the
group level with regular ET in a dose (exercise duration
× intensity)-dependent manner (Wenger & Bell, 1986;
Church et al. 2007; Helgerud et al. 2007; Bouchard et al.
2011b; Bacon et al. 2013; Jacobs et al. 2013; Bonne et al.
2014; Montero et al. 2015a).
˙
VO2max and Wmax gains
induced by a given dose of supervised ET are, however, not
uniformattheindividuallevel,one-thirdofmeasurements
being dispersed more than 1 standard deviation from
the mean (Cohen & Holliday, 1979; Lortie et al. 1984;
Bouchard et al. 2011b; Bacon et al. 2013). Importantly,
some individuals seemingly do not demonstrate any
improvement in ˙
VO2max with ET according to current
dose recommendations (150 min of moderate endurance
exercise per week) (Bouchard et al. 2011b; Garber et al.
2011). The prevalence of ˙
VO2max non-responders has been
reported to reach up to 20% among healthy individuals
(Timmons et al. 2010), raising compelling challenges to
personalized preventive medicine (Buford et al. 2013).
As a first step, it is fundamental to understand which
factors contribute to interindividual differences in CRF
trainability. In this regard, much attention has been
paid to genetic determinants (Bouchard et al. 1999,
2011a,b; Bouchard, 2012; Timmons et al. 2010; Sarzynski
etal.2017).Twenty-onesingle-nucleotidepolymorphisms
were found to explain up to 50% of the ˙
VO2max individual
response to 5 months of moderate ET in a cohort of
473 sedentary adults from the HERITAGE Family Study
(HERITAGE henceforward) (Bouchard et al. 2011b).
Approximately 8% of these individuals increased ˙
VO2max
by 28% or more, whereas �7% demonstrated a change
in ˙
VO2max of only 4% or less (Bouchard et al. 2011b).
While these findings have to be replicated, the notion
has spread that CRF trainability is essentially a matter
of fate (Roth, 2008; Bouchard, 2012; Mosley, 2012). Yet,
it is uncertain whether HERITAGE outcomes can be
extrapolated to at-risk or diseased populations and above
all, it remains to be established whether or to what extent
CRF non-response is dose-dependent.
The influence of ET dose on CRF non-response was
recently examined in three groups of obese adults exposed
to three distinct levels of exercise amount and intensity for
6 months (Ross et al. 2015). CRF non-response, as defined
by any change in ˙
VO2max lower than the typical error of
measurement (TE), was observed in 39, 18 and 0% of
obeseindividuals,respectivelyrandomizedtolow-amount
(180–300 kcal per session)–low-intensity (50% ˙
VO2max),
high-amount (360–600 kcal per session)–low-intensity
(50%
˙
VO2max) or high-amount (360–600 kcal per
session)–high-intensity (75% ˙
VO2max) of ET, all including
four to five exercise sessions per week (Ross et al. 2015). A
similardeclineintheprevalenceof ˙
VO2max non-responders
was previously demonstrated in postmenopausal women
allocated to four to five exercise sessions requiring 4,
8 or 12 kcal kg−1 per week during 6 months (Sisson
et al. 2009). These studies therefore suggest that CRF
non-response might ultimately be the result of inadequate
exercise stimuli. Nonetheless, it should be noted that
only individuals who adhered to at least 90% of the pre-
scribed exercise sessions were included in these analyses
(Sisson et al. 2009; Ross et al. 2015). It thus cannot be
discounted that non-responders were primarily excluded
by study design. To unequivocally overcome this issue,
CRF non-responders should first be identified and then
subjected to higher dose ET (Mann et al. 2014). This
may be ideally addressed using a repeated ET intervention,
which likewise would limit the influence of within-subject
response variability, a well-known source of confounding
in the clinical arena but uncertain concerning exercise
training studies (Senn et al. 2011; Hecksteden et al. 2015).
Therefore, we assessed the response of CRF to ET
in healthy young individuals divided into five groups
comprising one, two, three, four or five 60 min exercise
sessions per week during 6 weeks. We used this relatively
short length of ET in order to secure a high pre-
valence of CRF non-responders while still provoking
extensive physiological responses at the group level
(Montero et al. 2015a). Likewise, Wmax was chosen as
the primary CRF outcome because its TE, as measured
in our laboratory, is lower compared with that frequently
reported for ˙
VO2max (�5%) (Shephard et al. 2004); indeed,
the relatively large contribution of test–retest errors in
˙
VO2max to the individual response to ET has been a
matter of controversy concerning seminal studies in
the current subject (Shephard et al. 2004; Hecksteden
et al. 2015). Individuals identified as non-responders
subsequently completed an identical 6-week ET period

but including two additional exercise sessions per week,
thereby augmenting the ET dose dispensed. In addition,
˙
VO2max as well as potential haematological and skeletal
muscle determinants of Wmax were assessed prior to and
after each ET period with the intent to determine physio-
logically relevant parameters that may explain variations
in trainability.
Methods
Participants
Seventy-eight
healthy
young
male
volunteers
[age
(mean ± SD) = 26.2 ± 3.4 years, height (mean ±
SD) = 180.8 ± 4.3 cm] were recruited to participate in the
study.Tothisend,adswereplacedattheuniversitycampus
looking for untrained individuals. As inclusion criteria,
individuals had to be to males between 18 and 35 years
of age not participating in organized sports, non-smokers
and medication free. Cycling and walking for commuting
purposes were allowed. The protocol was approved by the
local ethical committee (EK 2011-N-51) and conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to
the start of the experiments, informed oral and written
consents were obtained from all participants.
Experimental design
All individuals underwent a first period of supervised
training for 6 weeks consisting of 60 min sessions of cycle
ergometer exercise. Individuals could chose to participate
in five groups differing in the number of exercise sessions
per week. Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 performed one, two,
three, four and five exercise sessions per week, respectively,
corresponding to 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min per
week in total. Four different intensity profiles, comprising
moderate continuous exercise and high-intensity inter-
vals, were alternated to facilitate participant motivation
and compliance, as detailed previously (Robach et al.
2014).
Profile 1 consisted of a steady-state exercise, i.e. 60 min
at 65% of peak power output (Wmax) attained with the
incremental exercise test.
Profile2startedwith11.25minat65%ofWmax followed
by 0.5 min at 130%, 1.25 min at 50%, 0.5 min at 130%,
1min at50%,11.25min at65%,0.5min at130%,1.25min

0.5 min at 130%, 1.25 min at 50%, 0.5 min at 130%, 1 min
at 50% and 11.25 min at 65% Wmax.
Profile 3 started with 3 min at 50% of Wmax followed
by 3 min at 60%, 3 min at 65%, 3 min at 70%, 3 min at

Profile 4 started with 6 min at 65% of Wmax followed by
4 min at 75%, 6 min at 65%, 4 min at 75%, 6 min at 65%,
4 min at 75%, 6 min at 65%, 4 min at 75%, 6 min at 65%,
4 min at 75%, 6 min at 65% and 4 min at 75% Wmax.
Each profile had an average exercise intensity of 65%
of Wmax for 60 min. Workloads were calculated from
individual Wmax determined during the incremental
exercise
test
at
baseline.
CRF
non-response
was
determined using the TE (Hopkins, 2000). TE is a measure
of technological error and day-to-day biological variation.
It was calculated by the standard error of within-subject
standard deviation from duplicate Wmax assessments,
and expressed as a percentage of the individual’s mean
Wmax (i.e. in the form of a coefficient of variation). Any
percentage change in Wmax not beyond ±1 × %TE was
considered a non-response. Based on repeated testing
at baseline in all individuals, CRF non-response was
calculatedtobe±3.96%forWmax.Theaverageofduplicate
Wmax assessments was considered the baseline Wmax for
each individual. Less than 7 days after the end of the initial
ET period, non-responders in each exercise group started
a second 6-week ET program identical to the former
but adding two exercise sessions per week. The measures
described below were determined prior to and after the
first ET period as well as following the second ET period.
Experimental measures
Incremental
exercise
test. Wmax
and
˙
VO2max
were
determined
on
an
electronically
braked
bicycle
ergometer (Monark, Vansbro, Sweden) with continuous
measurementsof ˙
VO2 usinganonlinegascollectionsystem
(Innocor M400, Innovision, Glamsbjerg, Denmark). The
test started with a warm-up period of 5 min at 50–150 W
workloads. Thereafter, the workload was increased by
30 W every 60 s until exhaustion. The gas analysers and
the flowmeter of the applied spirometer were calibrated
prior to each test. Breath-by-breath values were averaged
over 30 s. The highest average value was taken as the
˙
VO2max provided that standard criteria were fulfilled
(AmericanThoracicSociety,2003).Wmax wascalculatedas
Wcompl + 30(t/60), where Wcompl is the last fully completed
workload and t is the number of seconds in the final
workload.
Blood. Haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) was measured as
previously described (Siebenmann et al. 2015), using
a modified version of the carbon monoxide (CO)
re-breathing technique (Burge & Skinner, 1995). All
individuals rested for 20 min in a semi-recumbent
position before each measurement. Thereafter, 2 ml of
blood was sampled from an antecubital vein via a 20-G
venflon catheter (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and

analysed immediately in quadruplicate for (i) percentage
carboxyhaemoglobin and Hb concentration ([Hb]) using
a haemoximeter (ABL800, Radiometer, Denmark), and
(ii) haematocrit (Hct) with the micromethod (4 min at
13,500 rpm). Subsequently, the subject breathed 100%
oxygen for 4 min to flush the nitrogen from the air-
ways. After closing the oxygen input, a bolus 1.5 ml kg−1
of 99.997% chemically pure CO (CO N47, Air Liquide,
Paris,France)wasadministratedintothebreathingcircuit.
The subjects rebreathed this gas mixture for 10 min.
Then, an additional 2 ml blood sample was obtained
and analysed in quadruplicate. The change in percentage
carboxyhaemoglobin was used to calculate Hbmass, taking
into account the amount of CO that remained in the
rebreathing circuit at the end of the procedure (2.2%)
(Burge & Skinner, 1995). Total red blood cell volume
(RBCV), blood volume (BV) and plasma volume (PV)
were derived from measures of Hbmass and Hct (Burge &
Skinner, 1995).
Skeletal muscle biopsies. Using the Bergstr¨
om technique
(Bergstrom, 1962) with a needle modified for suction,
skeletal muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were
obtained under local anaesthetics while the subject was at
rest with a minimum of 24 h following the last exercise
training bout. The biopsy specimen was dissected free
of fat and connective tissue, divided into sections and
immediately prepared for analysis as stated below.
Mitochondrial volume density. Four 1 mm3 pieces of
each muscle biopsy were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at
room temperature and processed according to standard
electron-microscopyprotocols.Transitionelectronmicro-
scopy images were obtained in a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit
electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) with an
Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA)
and interfaced with the transition electron microscope
user software (from FEI). Two hundred and sixteen images
per biopsy were acquired in a random systematic order
from 24 meshes distributed on eight grids from four
blocks. The Cavalieri feature in the Stereo-Investigator
software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) was used
to estimate mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) by
point counting (West, 2012). The grid spacing was 1 μm
along both x- and y-axes. Mitochondria boundaries were
recognized at the x8200 magnification. Each point was
assigned as one of mitochondria, muscle or ‘nothing’.
MitoVD was expressed as the percentage of muscle tissue
occupied by mitochondria. MitoVD was not assessed after
the second training period.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics
v. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were tested
for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test and for homogeneity of variances with Levene’s
test. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons was used to compare continuous
baseline variables among groups. To examine the impact
of the frequency of exercise sessions on the effects of
exercisetraining,aone-wayANOVAwasappliedincluding
baseline values as covariates and Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. When F was significant in
the ANOVA, planned pair-wise specific comparisons
were carried out. Effects of exercise training on studied
variables in each group were assessed by Student’s
paired t test. The proportion of CRF non-responders
was compared among groups with the chi-square test.
Finally, multiple regression analysis was used to identify
variables independently associated with absolute changes
(post-training minus pre-training, �) in Wmax or
˙
VO2max, including first and second ET periods. Variables
significantly associated with �Wmax or � ˙
VO2max in
univariateanalyses,asdeterminedbyPearson’scorrelation
coefficients, were entered into the regression model as
independent variables. In the case of high correlation
between independent variables, each of these were
separately entered into the regression model in order
to avoid high multicollinearity (variance inflation factor
>10). A two-tailed P-value less than 0.05 was considered
significant. Data are reported as the mean (±SD) unless
otherwise stated.

non-response was 69, 40 and 29% in individuals training

While
the
existence
of
interindividual

variability to exercise training is beyond dispute, less
convincing is the generalized idea that a substantial
fraction (�20%) of individuals fail to improve CRF
following intense ET (Timmons et al. 2010). Supporting
evidence primarily derives from HERITAGE, in which 473
Caucasian adults (51% females) completed three exercise
sessions per week progressively increasing their length
from 30 to 50 min and intensity from 55% to 75% of
maximal heart rate (HRmax), during 5 months (Bouchard
et al. 1995; Timmons et al. 2010). The HERITAGE

ET program thus reached the low end of current
recommendations as regards exercise time per week
(150 min) and did not comprise high intensity exercise
(�80%HRmax)(Garberetal.2011).Ofnote,sinceexercise
intensity was controlled by heart rate monitoring, inter-
individual fluctuations in training workload did occur and
partly explained ˙
VO2max responses to ET in HERITAGE
(Sarzynski et al. 2016). Most importantly, meta-analytical
evidence encompassing research performed during the
last four decades suggests that higher doses of ET
than those prescribed in HERITAGE can generate sub-
stantial improvements in
˙
VO2max in nearly all young
and middle-aged adults (Bacon et al. 2013). Likewise,
recent studies have observed gradual decreases in the
number of CRF non-responders with increasing doses
of ET in individuals who completed � 90% of the
exercise sessions prescribed (Sisson et al. 2009; Ross et al.
2015). A key limitation of these studies, however, is the
potential presence of CRF non-responders in individuals
who dropped out or failed to complete the minimum
number of exercise sessions. Definitive proof that CRF
non-responders may benefit from higher ET doses can
only be provided by within-subject study designs (Mann
et al. 2014; Hecksteden et al. 2015), as originally applied
in the current study and discussed hereunder.

differing in the number of sessions (1–5) and thus exercise
dose per week were compared. In more than 20% of
individuals allocated to one (60 min), two (120 min)
or three (180 min) sessions of ET per week, Wmax did
not increase (−1, −1 and 2%, respectively) more than
1 × %TE (4%) and hence they were considered as
CRF non-responders. Afterwards, CRF non-responders
accomplished a second ET period including 2 × 60 min
additional sessions per week of otherwise identical
training. After this additional training period CRF
non-response was no longer present in any individual.
This unequivocally demonstrates that CRF non-response
was not inexorably predetermined in the study subjects
and suggests that the potential for CRF improvements
might well be present and unveiled with appropriate
stimuli in healthy individuals without exception. Such
unanimous CRF response may also indicate a relatively
minor influence of within-subject response variability and
measurement error when applying successive higher doses
of ET (Bacon et al. 2013; Hecksteden et al. 2015).
Despite our data clearly denoting the spurious nature
of CRF non-response, a wide interindividual variability
in CRF improvements to identical ET dose is plainly
illustrated in Figs 1 and 2. Certainly, hereditary factors
must be assumed to play a role on CRF trainability
(Bouchard et al. 1999), although family- and large
population-based confirmatory/replication studies are
needed (Thomis, 2008). In addition, an often overlooked

factor is the typical use of some percentage of HRmax,
˙
VO2max or Wmax to prescribe exercise intensity, which
does not effectively standardize the homeostatic stress
caused by ET at the individual level (Meyer et al. 1999;
Gaskill et al. 2001; Scharhag-Rosenberger et al. 2010).
Therefore, provided a given ET dose, individuals may
experience diverse magnitudes of stimuli for adaptive
responses. Furthermore, a perfectly identical exercise
dose prescription for any individual may prompt distinct
homeostatic stress according to its interaction with
oscillating factors such as sleep and nutrition, both
affecting recovery and readiness to train (Kentta &
Hassmen, 1998; Samuels, 2009; Hawley et al. 2011).
Collectively considered, a comparable homeostatic stress
among individuals involved in ET, as commonly pre-
scribed, seems unlikely (Mann et al. 2014). It follows
that a certain degree of interindividual variability in CRF
trainability to a fixed ET dose may be generally expected
by default due to lack of truly standardized exercise
stimuli.
The question arises as to whether variability in CRF
response to ET lies upon a firm mechanistic basis. ET
is commonly associated with a surfeit of phenotypic
modifications along the O2 transport and utilization
chain – from lung to mitochondria – all potentially
contributing to
˙
VO2max and Wmax improvements via
enhancing convective oxygen delivery to and/or extraction
by active tissue (Hawley & Noakes, 1992; Helgerud
et al. 2007; Boushel et al. 2011; Lundby & Montero,
2015; Montero et al. 2015a; Wagner, 2015). The
bulk of evidence indicates that haemodynamic and
haematological
systemic
adaptations
increasing
the
capacity to deliver oxygen predominantly explain ˙
VO2max
improvementswithshort-term(5–11weeks)ETinhealthy
individuals (Montero & Diaz-Canestro, 2015; Montero
et al. 2015b). Empirical evidence demonstrates that the
increase in
˙
VO2max with 6 weeks of moderate-to-high
intensity ET is primarily attributed to augmented
circulating RBCV and oxygen-carrying capacity of blood,
as reflected by increases in total circulating Hbmass (Bonne
et al. 2014; Montero et al. 2015a). In turn, increases in
skeletal muscle capillarization and MitoVD, both possibly
facilitating oxygen extraction, do not seem to contribute
substantially to the increase in
˙
VO2max after 6 weeks
of ET (Montero et al. 2015a). Concurring with the
above, in the present study increases (�) in Hbmass
were the strongest determinants of � ˙
VO2max, which in
turn explained most of the variance in �Wmax. Yet,
approximately half of the variance in � ˙
VO2max remained
unexplained, which could be partially attributed to
non-assessed adaptations modulating cardiac output and
its distribution (Boushel et al. 2014; Lundby et al. 2017).
Theparallelismbetweenchangesin ˙
VO2max andunderlying
phenotypic modifications measured in this study implies
the presence of quantitative but not major qualitative
differences in either homeostatic stress induced by ET or
adaptive capacity on an individual basis. Ultimately, it is
worth noticing that the genetic bases of crucial physio-
logical pathways governing convective oxygen delivery
have not been identified (Sarzynski et al. 2016).
Another important outcome of this study was the
magnitude of increases in CRF at the group level according
to ET dose. Increases in Wmax with 240 or 300 min
were substantial (24 and 32%) and higher compared with
uniformly small Wmax changes observed with 60, 120 or
180 min of training per week (1, 5 and 7%, respectively)
(Fig. 1). Similar findings were obtained regarding ˙
VO2max
(Fig.3).Partofthisgapcouldbeattributedtolower Hbmass
in the 300 min group prior to ET (P = 0.064) facilitating
greater adaptations, albeit baseline values were included as
covariates. Regardless, the critical duration of exercise for
CRF improvements with moderate–high intensity ET may
liesomewherebetween>180�240minperweekformost
individuals. This finding concurs with previous reports
suggesting raising the minimum level of exercise dose in
physical activity guidelines for healthy adults (Bacon et al.
2013; Ross et al. 2015).
Limitations
Findings were obtained from a sample of healthy young
males. Further research will elucidate whether current
conclusions can be extrapolated to populations including
females,
older
individuals
and/or
cardio-metabolic
patients. Moreover, this study was designed to dissect the
independent contribution of overall ET dose, but not of its
components (frequency/length of exercise sessions, total
duration, intensity). In addition, ˙
VO2max measurements
were not duplicated at baseline and therefore %TE for
˙
VO2max was not calculated. Nonetheless,
˙
VO2max and
Wmax responses were closely associated and all Wmax
non-responders increased their ˙
VO2max with higher ET
dose (Figs 3 and 4). Finally, changes in body composition
potentially influencing CRF were not assessed.
Conclusion
This study fundamentally challenges the notion of
CRF non-response to exercise training. In 78 healthy
individuals performing moderate-to-high intensity ET
for 6 weeks, the prevalence of CRF non-response, as
determined by Wmax, gradually declined in individuals
exercising 60, 120 or 180 min per week. No vestige of Wmax
non-response was observed in individuals training 240 or
300minperweek.Followingasuccessive6-weekETperiod
comprising 120 min of additional ET per week, Wmax
non-response was universally abolished. Consistent with
sound experimental evidence, haematological adaptations
in oxygen-carrying capacity underlay ˙
VO2max and thereby
Wmax (non-)responses to ET. These findings highlight the
