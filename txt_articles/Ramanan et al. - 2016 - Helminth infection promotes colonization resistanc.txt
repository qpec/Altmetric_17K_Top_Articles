Increasing incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, in
developed nations is associated with changes to the microbial environment, such as
decreased prevalence of helminth colonization and alterations to the gut microbiota. We
find that helminth infection protects mice deficient in the Crohn’s disease susceptibility
gene Nod2 from intestinal abnormalities by inhibiting colonization by an inflammatory
Bacteroides species. Resistance to Bacteroides colonization was dependent on type 2
immunity, which promoted the establishment of a protective microbiota enriched in
Clostridiales. Additionally, we show that individuals from helminth-endemic regions
harbor a similar protective microbiota and that deworming treatment reduced levels of
Clostridiales and increased Bacteroidales. These results support a model of the hygiene
hypothesis in which certain individuals are genetically susceptible to the consequences
of a changing microbial environment.
D
ramatic increases in the incidence of in-
flammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the de-
veloped world point toward alterations
in the microbial environment, including
changes to the gut microbiota (1) and de-
creased exposure to intestinal parasites such as
helminths (2). Evidence supporting a central role
of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD has
led to a growing interest in defining the sym-
biotic relationship between the host and specific
microbial species (3). In insects, symbiotic rela-
tionships can develop to defend against envi-
ronmental hazards (defensive symbiosis) (4); this
concept may be applicable to host-microbiota
interactions. For example, specific bacterial taxa
found within the human gut microbiota prob-
ably mediate resistance to antibiotic-associated
diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (5). The
loss of beneficial members of the microbiota po-
tentially contributes to chronic inflammatory
diseases. Additionally, helminths and the gut mi-
crobiota have coevolved with their mammalian

Downloaded from 
 hosts, but the mechanisms of these interactions
and the consequence of decreased exposure to
intestinal helminths remain unclear. We find that
helminths can reduce intestinal inflammatory
responses by promoting expansion of protective
bacterial communities that inhibit proinflamma-
tory bacterial taxa.
We previously reported that mice deficient
in Nod2 develop several small intestinal (SI)
abnormalities, in a manner dependent on a
ubiquitous member of the gut microbiota, Bac-
teroides vulgatus (6). Consistent with the spe-
cific association between human NOD2 variants
and ileal Crohn’s disease (7), an IBD that affects
the small intestine, the most notable abnor-
mality was a SI goblet cell defect that resulted
in a compromised mucus layer, allowing sus-
tained colonization by B. vulgatus. We found
that chronic infection of Nod2−/− mice with the
parasitic worm Trichuris muris restored SI goblet
cell numbers and morphology (Fig. 1, A and B,
and fig. S1, A and B). These changes were not
detected in the colon, and wild-type (WT) mice
infected with T. muris did not display nonspe-
cific goblet cell hyperplasia (fig. S1C). Elevated
epithelial levels of the antimicrobial lectin Reg3b
and interferon-g+ (IFN-g+) CD8+ intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), inflammatory markers as-
sociated with goblet cell defects in Nod2−/− mice
(6), were also reduced upon T. muris infection
(Fig. 1, C to E; and figs. S1, D and E, and S2).
Nod2−/− mice develop severe intestinal patholo-
gies after SI injury induced by the nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam. Infection with
T. muris prevented the intestinal bleeding and
perforation, exaggerated weight loss, mucus de-
pletion, splenomegaly, and bacterial transloca-
tion observed in uninfected Nod2−/− mice treated
with piroxicam (Fig. 1F and figs. S3, A to C, and
S4). Blind histology analysis confirmed reduc-
tions in specific pathologies such as abscesses,
epithelial hyperplasia, villus blunting, and im-
mune infiltrates (Fig. 1, G and H, and fig. S3, D
to J). These results indicate that T. muris infec-
tion ameliorates spontaneous and inducible
intestinal defects in Nod2−/− mice.
Consistent with the dependence of these in-
flammatory pathologies on B. vulgatus (6), in-
fection with T. muris reduced the bacterial burden
to the limit of detection in the stool and SI tissue
of Nod2−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and F). B. vulgatus
inhibition was dependent on lymphocytes (fig.
S5, A to C), potentially reflecting goblet cell ac-
tivation by type 2 cytokines [interleukin-4 (IL-4)
and IL-13] produced by T helper (TH) cells during
helminth infections. We found increased phos-
phorylation of the type 2 transcription factor
Stat6 in the SI epithelium of T. muris–infected
Nod2−/− mice (Fig. 2B and fig. S5D). Additionally,
T. muris infection inhibited B. vulgatus only
transiently and did not restore goblet cells in
Stat6−/− mice reconstituted with Nod2−/− bone
marrow (Fig. 2C and fig. S5E). Nod2−/− mice in-
fected with T. muris displayed a dominant TH2
response characterized by a >10-fold increase in
IL-13+ CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria (Fig. 2,
D and E, and fig. S5, F and G). We confirmed these
results with a second helminth, Heligmosomoides
polygyrus, which induced an even greater TH2
response compared with T. muris, perhaps re-
flecting the distinct anatomical niches of these
parasites (Fig. 2, H and D, and figs. S6, C and D,
and S7B). H. polygyrus completely abolished
tissue-associated B. vulgatus, restored goblet
cells, and reduced IFN-g+ IELs in Nod2−/− mice
(Fig. 2, F and G, and figs. S6, A and B, and S7A).
Blockade of IL-13 inhibited the effect of H. poly-
gyrus on B. vulgatus and goblet cells, and ad-
ministration of recombinant IL-13 (rIL-13) or
rIL-4 to Nod2−/− mice was sufficient to reproduce
the effect of helminth infection (Fig. 2, I to L, and

Downloaded from 
 fig. S6E). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of
intestinal tissues from rIL-13–treated Nod2−/−
mice revealed a wound-healing response charac-
terized by expression of M2 macrophage genes
(Fig. 2M, fig. S6F, and table S1). These results are
consistent with the anti-inflammatory role of M2
macrophages in the gut (8, 9) and help to explain
how helminth infection ameliorates the exacer-
bated intestinal injury response in Nod2−/− mice.
These results do not contradict the regulatory
response induced by H. polygyrus in the colon
(9, 10), because type 2 immunity and regulatory
T cells can function concurrently to reduce in-
flammation (11).
The reduction of B. vulgatus in the presence
of helminths could be mediated indirectly through
alterations to the gut microbiota downstream
of the type 2 response. Cohousing mice allows
for coprophagic transmission of microbial pop-
ulations without transfer of parasites, because
the worms are not sexually mature until ~35 days
postinfection and eggs require several weeks
for germination (12). We found that uninfected
Nod2−/− mice cohoused with T. muris–infected
Nod2−/− mice showed a similar decrease in B.
vulgatus colonization (Fig. 3A and fig. S8A).
This reduction in B. vulgatus levels was not ob-
served in uninfected Nod2−/− mice when they
were instead cohoused with T. muris–infected
WT mice (fig. S8, B and C). 16S ribosomal DNA
sequencing analysis of stool samples indicated
that the alterations to microbial community com-
positions are different for T. muris–infected WT
and Nod2−/− mice (Fig. 3B), which may reflect
different intestinal responses between WT and
Nod2−/− mice (Fig. 2E). Whereas infected WT
mice have reduced alpha diversity, as previously
reported (13, 14), Nod2−/− mice increased their
alpha diversity at day 21 postinfection (fig. S8D).
The most significantly reduced bacterial taxa in
infected Nod2−/− mice were the Prevotella and
Bacteroides genera (belonging to the order Bac-
teroidales), and the Lachnospiraceae family of
the order Clostridiales was the most significantly
increased (Fig. 3C). The increase in Clostridiales
was less evident in WT mice (Fig. 3B), which po-
tentially explains why cohousing Nod2−/− mice
with T. muris–infected WT mice was not effec-
tive in reducing the B. vulgatus burden. The ex-
pansion of Clostridiales was also observed in the
stool of uninfected Nod2−/− mice treated with
rIL-13 or rIL-4 (Fig. 3D and fig. S8E). The expan-
sion of Clostridiales was even more pronounced
among tissue-associated bacteria in the small
intestine after infection with T. muris or H.
polygyrus (fig. S8, F and G). Thus, helminth in-
fection and type 2 cytokines inhibit B. vulgatus
and expand Clostridiales strains.
To determine whether Clostridia can directly
inhibit B. vulgatus, we inoculated Nod2−/− mice
with a mixture of Clostridium clusters IV, XIVa,
and XVIII and Erysipelotrichales strains iso-
lated from human feces (15). Repetitive gavaging
of Nod2−/− mice with this mixture, but not sterile
broth or an equivalent number of Lactobacillus
johnsonii [a host-interactive commensal bacte-
rium (16)], led to a decrease in B. vulgatus colo-
nization over time (Fig. 3E). The addition of
mucin to anaerobic cultures accelerates the
growth of all three representative Clostridia
strains tested, but not B. vulgatus (Fig. 3, F and
G, and fig. S8, H and I), which suggests that
increased mucus production by goblet cells
may alter the intestinal environment to favor
Clostridiales. Hence, our results indicate that in
Nod2−/− mice, the mucus response associated
with type 2 immunity during helminth infection
expands Clostridia strains that can inhibit col-
onization of B. vulgatus.
Inflammatory bowel disease is less prevalent in
regions where helminth colonization is endemic.
We previously found that helminth-colonized
individuals among indigenous populations in
Malaysia, known as the Orang Asli, have higher
microbial diversity than helminth-negative in-
dividuals (17). We compared individuals living
in urbanized Kuala Lumpur with rural Orang
Asli of the Temuan subtribe from a village 40 km
away (5.3% versus 96% of individuals colonized
by intestinal helminths, respectively) (table S2).
People living in Kuala Lumpur predominantly
cluster in a group driven by the abundance of a
single Bacteroides operational taxonomic unit
(OTU) (TaxID 3600504), which is less widespread
in the Orang Asli (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast,
the helminth-positive Orang Asli people fall into

Downloaded from 
 a second group characterized by Faecalibacterium
and Prevotella (Fig. 4A). This division between
the microbiota dominance of urban and rural
populations is also observed in other Asian
countries (18).
To control for factors other than helminth
colonization (e.g., diet), we analyzed stool sam-
ples collected from the Orang Asli before and
after deworming treatment with albendazole
(fig. S9, A and B, and table S3). Alpha diversity
of microbial communities was significantly re-
duced after treatment (Fig. 4F and fig. S9, C
and D). We used the linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm to show that
Clostridiales was the most significantly reduced
order, whereas Bacteroidales (Prevotella) was
significantly expanded after treatment (Fig. 4, C
to E, and fig. S9E). Using the egg-burden data,
we combined centered log-ratio transformation
with partial least squares regression to examine
within-subject changes, incorporating a repeated
measures design (19). The resulting model showed
that posttreatment intraindividual changes in
Trichuris trichiura egg burden are strongly as-
sociated with a small set of bacterial taxa, in-
dependent of age and gender (Fig. 4G; fig. S10,
A to C; and table S4). Specifically, Dialister and
Coprococcus are two members of the order
Clostridiales that are positively associated with
changes in egg burden, whereas the Bacter-
oidales species Prevotella and another OTU are
negatively associated (Fig. 4H and fig. S10D).
Individuals without reduced egg burden did not
show these microbiome changes, indicating that
these findings are unlikely to be due to nonspe-
cific effects of albendazole treatment (fig. S10, E
to G). Overall, these data support our hypothesis
that helminth infection promotes the expansion
of Clostridiales communities that outcompete
Bacteroidales communities, although we did not
examine the TH2 response. Finally, we applied a
method [sparse inverse covariance estimation
for ecological association inference (SPIEC-EASI)]
for inference of microbial ecological networks
(20) to publicly available human microbiome data
sets consisting of healthy U.S. residents (Human
Microbiome Project and American Gut Project)
and pediatric IBD patients (RISK cohort) (21–23)
and found that the antagonistic relationship be-
tween Clostridiales and Bacteroidales is the
most consistently observed negative relation-
ship (Fig. 4, I and J, and fig. S11).
In this study, Clostridiales are an example of
defensive symbionts that display an antagonistic
interaction with another common commensal
bacteria (Bacteroidales), which we consistently
observed in all human gut microbiome data sets.
Bacteroidales are pathogenic only in susceptible
Nod2-deficient hosts, and this competition re-
verses disease pathologies. Many Crohn’s disease
patients do not carry NOD2 variants and, hence,
may not respond to helminths, which have failed
in clinical trials. Helminths may be beneficial

Orang Asli (blue dots). (B) Relative abundance of a dominant Bacteroides OTU
in the Orang Asli and urban controls. (C to F) Supervised LEfSE analysis (C),
relative abundance of Bacteroidales (D) and Clostridiales (E), and alpha di-
versity as observed OTUs (F) of the Orang Asli stool microbiota before and
after treatment with albendazole (n = 19 for urban controls and 55 Orang Asli;
n = 53 for deworming experiments). (G) Partial least squares regression
biplots examining within-subject variances with repeated measures design to
identify bacterial taxa associated with T. trichiura worm burden (illustrated by the intensity of the spots).
Red arrows represent Clostridiales taxa; green arrows denote Bacteroidales taxa. (H) Specific OTUs iden-
tified to be positively (Dialister) or negatively (Prevotella) associated with changes to T. trichiura egg burdens.
(I and J) Microbial network inference demonstrating an antagonistic relationship between Clostridiales
and Bacteroidales communities from the Human Microbiome Project (I) and the pediatric IBD RISK cohort
(J).The node diameter is proportional to the geometric mean of the OTU’s relative abundance. Numerical values on the edges represent the fraction of edges
that are either majority-positive (green) or majority-negative (red). Also see fig. S10. ****P < 0.0001 by unpaired t test in (B) and paired t test in (D) to (F).

Downloaded from 
 only in patients with NOD2 variants or proin-
flammatory Bacteroidales species. We propose
that certain individuals may be more susceptible
to deleterious consequences of a changing mi-
crobial environment, and an understanding of
the contribution of genetic and environmental
factors toward the development of inflamma-
tory diseases is essential to devise therapeutic
strategies that consider the heterogeneity of
etiologies.
