Background: People with bipolar disorder (BD) experience additional parenting challenges associated with mood
driven fluctuations in communication, impulse control and motivation. This paper describes a novel web-based
self-management approach (Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention; IBPI) to support parents with BD. Method:
Parents with BD with children aged 3–10 years randomised to IBPI plus treatment as usual (TAU) or waitlist control
(WL). IBPI offered 16 weeks access to interactive self-management information concerning BD and parenting issues.
Feasibility was through recruitment, retention and web usage. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 24,
36 and 48 weeks. Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN75279027. Results: Ninety seven participants were recruited
with 98% retention to end of intervention and 90% to final follow-up (56%–94% data analysed of retained
participants; higher rates for observer measures). 77% of IBPI participants accessed the website (53% accessed
parenting modules). Child behaviour, parenting sense of competence and parenting stress improved significantly in
IBPI compared to WL to end of intervention, sustained to 48 weeks. Impacts of IBPI on family functioning, parent
mood and time to mood relapse were not significant. Conclusions: Online self-management support for parents with
BD is feasible, with promising improvements in parenting and child behaviour outcomes. A definitive clinical and
cost-effectiveness trial is required to confirm and extend these findings. Keywords: Bipolar disorder; web-based
intervention; parenting intervention; parents; randomised controlled trial.
Introduction
Bipolar disorder (BD) is an enduring mental health
problem characterised by severe fluctuations in affec-
tive, cognitive and physiological functioning. BD
impacts negatively on, sleep/wake cycles, impulse
control, communication and motivation, which may
undermine adaptive parenting (Phelan, Lee, Howe, &
Walter, 2006; Vance, Jones, Espie, Bentall, & Tai,
2008); whilst mood variation can trigger inconsistent
parenting (David, Styron, & Davidson, 2011; Dolman,
Jones, & Howard, 2013). Support for parents with BD
is particularly important as their children are at high-
risk for psychiatric conditions, including attention
deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), depression, anx-
iety, substance abuse, sleep disorders and BD (Axel-
son et al., 2015; Duffy, Jones, Goodday, & Bentall,
2016; Mesman, Nolen, Reichart, Wals, & Hillegers,
2013). Despite this, few of these children receive
clinical support (Calam, Jones, Sanders, Dempsey, &
Sadhnani, 2012; Jones, Tai, Evershed, Knowles, &
Bentall, 2006) which risks more severe psychological
disorders in later life (Duffy et al., 2016). Parenting
programmes offer a means to support parents in
encouraging desirable behaviours in their children:
consequent reductions in parenting stress might have
secondary clinical benefits for parents.
Parenting programmes are effective in reducing
child behaviour problems, including ADHD, conduct
disorder and antisocial behaviour (NICE, 2013).
Programmes such as the Triple P Positive Parenting
Programme (Sanders, 2012), foster adaptive parent-
ing through information and support based on social
learning and cognitive behavioural principles. Triple
P is effective in improving child behaviour problems,
parenting skills (Sanders, Kirby, Tellegen, & Day,
2014; and also maternal mood (Sanders & McFar-
land, 2000).
However, the impact of general parenting interven-
tions for parents with severe mental illness is unclear
(Bee et al., 2014) because of the low quality of current
evidence (Schrank, Moran, Borghi, & Priebe, 2015).
Parents with BD support the idea of parenting self-
management interventions (Jones et al., 2014) but
most do not access these, due to lack of availability
and reluctance to acknowledge parenting issues to
mental health services due to stigma and fear of over-
monitoring (Dolman et al., 2013).
Online interventions have potential to offer destig-
matising support at times and in locations conve-
nient to parents, at low cost (Kazdin & Blase, 2011).

 Supported online psychological interventions can
improve clinical outcomes in mothers with postnatal
depression (Kaplan, Solomon, Salzer, & Brusilovs-
kiy, 2014; O’Mahen et al., 2014) and parenting in
parents with and without mental health problems
(Love et al., 2016; Sanders, Baker, & Turner, 2012;
Sanders, Dittman, Farruggia, & Keown, 2014). Addi-
tionally, three studies of online Triple P indicated
child behaviour improvements (Love et al., 2016;
Sanders et al., 2012; Sanders, Dittman et al., 2014).
The
potential
benefits
of
online
parenting
approaches for parents with BD require further
investigation. Our team reported on a pilot RCT
combining online psychoeducational information on
BD, with an online version of Triple P (Jones et al.,
2014). Compared to waitlist control, intervention
parents reported improved parenting skills and child
behaviour. However, lack of follow-up, lack of inter-
activity and comprehensiveness in the intervention
and lack of assessment of impact on parental mood
symptoms were study limitations. The current study
addresses these to assess the feasibility, acceptabil-
ity and potential clinical benefit of delivering an
integrated
bipolar
parenting
intervention
(IBPI),
using an interactive self-management site for BD
developed by our team, combined with Triple P
online (Turner & Sanders, 2011) in an RCT design
with follow-up to 48 weeks postbaseline.
Methods
Study design and participants
A
rater-blind
randomised
controlled
trial
(preregistered:
http://www.isrctn.com; ISRCTN75279027: UK NHS Ethics
Committee
approved;
REC
ref,
12/NW/7049)
compared
16 weeks of parent access to IBPI plus treatment as usual
(TAU) with wait list control (WL). Protocol is published (Jones
et al., 2015).
Recruitment was from 17 UK NHS Trusts (30/1/13–16/4/
14) through clinical and self-referral. Inclusion criteria: (a) BD
diagnosis confirmed by structured clinical interview (First,
Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, & Benjamin, 1997); (b) ≥1 child aged
3–10 years (consistent with the age range that the Triple P
intervention was originally designed for; Turner & Sanders,
2011) with whom ≥10 hr of face-to-face contact weekly and (c)
internet access and ability to provide informed consent.
Exclusion criteria: (a) primary diagnosis of alcohol/other
substance misuse; (b) already receiving a parenting interven-
tion and/or intensive psychotherapy; (c) index child in receipt
of structured psychological therapy and/or subject to child
protection proceedings.
Procedure and intervention
Potential participants completed a telephone prescreen. Fol-
lowing consent, BD diagnosis was confirmed using the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis 1 disorders (SCID;
First et al., 1997) and baseline assessments completed. Indi-
vidual randomisation was conducted by MAHSC Trials Coor-
dination
Unit,
Manchester
which
provided
anonymised
condition allocation information to RP who was not involved
in any assessments. All assessment researchers were masked
to treatment condition. Participants were reminded prior to
each assessment to refrain from disclosing treatment alloca-
tion. All self-report measures were completed online. Observer
rated measures were completed in telephone interviews with
the researchers.
Integrated bipolar parenting intervention
Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention was developed with
service users with BD and parenting experience (Jones et al.,
2015). It included an eight module self-management interven-
tion with strategies for BD in parents covering the following:
What is Bipolar Disorder?; Benefits and Challenges; Managing
Emotions; Knowing Yourself; Mood Monitoring; Playing to your
strengths; Planning for yourself; Finding support and final
thoughts. Participants also received access to the eight module
Triple P online intervention (Turner & Sanders, 2011) covering:
What is positive parenting?; Encouraging desirable beha-
viours; Teaching new skills and behaviour; Managing misbe-
haviour; Dealing with disobedience; Preventing problems by
planning ahead; Making shopping fun; Raising confident,
competent kids. Both elements provided information and
opportunities for reflection through interactive and multimedia
features, including video clips, collaborative exercises and self-
evaluation. IBPI employed a normalising, self-regulatory focus
to avoid stigmatising or blaming participants. Participants
could work through each module of the intervention in around
30 min. Intervention access period was 16 weeks.
Assessment of outcomes
Feasibility and acceptability outcomes.
Feasibility
was evaluated through recruitment to target, retention to
follow-up in both trial arms and absence of adverse events
associated with IBPI. Acceptability was measured through
parent’s adherence to, and completion of the intervention,
through website usage data.
Follow-up period was 48 weeks from randomisation (see
Table 1) with blind assessments at baseline, 16 (end of
intervention), 24, 36 and 48 week follow-ups. All observer-
rated follow-up assessments were completed via telephone. All
self-report assessments were completed online.
Parenting and child behaviour outcomes:
Child
behaviour problems were assessed using the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 2001) and the
Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg & Pincus,
1999). Parenting skills, confidence and stress were measured
with the Parenting Scale (PS3; Arnold, O’Leary, Wolff, & Acker,
1993), the Parenting Sense of Competency Scale (PSOC;
Johnston & Mash, 1989) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI;
Abidin, 1990) respectively.
Parental mood, relapse and family coherence out-
comes:
Time to bipolar relapse was measured using the
SCID Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (SCID-LIFE;
Keller et al., 1987), whilst observer-rated mania and depres-
sion were assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D; Hamilton, 1960) and Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale
(MAS; Bech, 2012; Bech, Rafaelsen, Kramp, & Bolwig, 1978).
Self-reported mood symptoms were measured by the Internal
States Scale (ISS; Bauer et al., 1991), Centre for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1991) and Altman
Rating Scale (ASRM; Altman, Hedeker, Peterson, & Davis,
1997). Family coherence and functioning was evaluated by the
Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale (CHAOS; Matheny,
Wachs, Ludwig, & Phillips, 1995).
Rationale for sample size.
The primary outcome, to
demonstrate feasibility, was recruitment into the trial and

 retention to follow-up. We intended to recruit N = 100 partic-
ipants to ensure 30 participants per group, conservatively
assuming 35%–40% drop out (Jones et al., 2015), to reliably
determine these outcomes.
Data analysis
Sample characteristics including baseline mood and parenting
variables, recruitment and retention levels, data completion
and web usage were all summarised with descriptive statistics.
Clinical outcomes were analysed with R version 3.2.2 (R-
Core-Team, 2015). Treatment effects through time were spec-
ified as piecewise linear at 16 weeks after randomisation
(treatment endpoint). For HAM-D and MAS, data were piece-
wise linear terms implemented at 24 weeks. Linear regressions
with correlated errors, specifically by uniform correlation
structure, based on exploratory data analyses and diagnostic
checks, are used to assess these effects. Models were fitted
using the R (R Core: R-Core-Team, 2015) package nlme
(Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & R-Core-Team, 2015). All
analyses were run with and without controlling for baseline
variables (parent gender, age, education and service contact,
illness severity and history, family finances, family composi-
tion, child gender and age and presence of formal disabilities/
health problems in child). As controlling for these variables did
not impact on any results we have reported the former
analyses for each clinical variable.
Differences in treatment arms in hazard for the first
depression or mania data were analysed by Cox proportional
hazards regression (Cox, 1972) using the R package survival
(Therneau, 2015; Therneau & Grambsch, 2000). Missing data
were assumed to be missing at random, based on inspecting
the reasons for missing data, for which maximum likelihood
would provide reliable results.
Results
Participant Characteristics (summarised by
treatment arm in Table 2)
Participants were <38 years of age, predominantly
female (78%, n = 76) and ≤7 years since diagnosis of
BD. Most (94%, n = 91) had a bipolar I diagnosis and
subclinical
scores
on
observer-rated
depression
(84%, n = 81) and mania (100%, n = 97). Partici-
pants were prescribed a combination of antidepres-
sants, mood stabilisers and antipsychotics. Most
were receiving care from general practitioners (55%,
n = 53)
or
care
coordinators/community
mental
health teams (36%, n = 35). Supplementary demo-

and assessment point in Figure 1: highest completion
rates were for observer-rated measures, particularly
HAM-D and MAS (Figure 1, Table 3 and Table S3).
Ten participants were lost following randomisation,
one due to increased time commitments, two due to ill

No study-related adverse events were recorded.
Participant website use.
Of 47 participants ran-
domised to IBPI, 77% (n = 36) accessed bipolar mod-
ules (Table S2). Module 1 (What is Bipolar Disorder?)
was visited by the most (92%, n = 33), module 8
(Finding
support
and
final
thoughts)
the
least
(14%, n = 5). Average number of visits per person
ranged from ~10 for modules 1–3 (1; mean (�
x) = 9.97,
standard deviation (SD) = 8.05: 2; �
x = 9.95, SD = 7.0; 3;
�
x = 10.11, SD = 4.03) to �
x = 5.2, SD = 2.38 for module 8.
Twenty-five participants (53%) accessed Triple P
modules. All parents visited module 1 (What is
positive parenting?: 100%, n = 25) whereas only five
visited modules 5–8 respectively (Dealing with dis-
obedience; Preventing problems by planning ahead;
Making shopping fun; Raising confident, competent
kids: 20%). Average number of visits per person
ranged from �
x = 4.20 (SD = 2.52) for module 1 to
�
x = 1.4 (SD = 0.55) for module 8.
Baseline score for parenting and child beha-
viour.
Child behaviour problems on SDQ were
approaching borderline abnormal behaviour cut-off
(Goodman, 2001; Table 3). For ECBI, number of
problems (ECBI-P) and intensity (ECBI-I) were ele-
vated (Colvin, Eyeberg & Adams, 1999). Dysfunc-
tional parenting (PS3) was at clinical levels (Arnold
et al., 1993). Parenting confidence (PSOC) was mod-
erate and parenting stress levels (PSI) were clinically
significant (Abidin, 1990; Johnston & Mash, 1989).
Baseline scores for self-rated parental mood and
family coherence.
Internal States Scale-Activation
scores and Altman Scales were below mania cut-offs
(Altman et al., 1997; Bauer et al., 1991; Table S3).
ISS Wellbeing did not indicate depression, although
CES-D scores did (Radloff, 1991). Household distur-
bance (CHOAS) was extremely high compared to a
general population sample (Coldwell, Pike, & Dunn,
2006). Scores were similar in both arms.
Primary clinical outcomes (Tables 3 and 4; Figures

Child behaviour.
Strengths and Difficulties Ques-
tionnaire improved significantly to end of treatment in
IBPI (�0.48 units per 4 weeks, 95%, CI �0.76 to �0.19,
SE = 0.14, p < .01) but worsened in WL (0.35 units per
4 weeks, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.61, SE = 0.13, p < .01): this
slope difference was significant. After 16 weeks SDQ
did not change (IBPI; 0.01 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI
�0.15 to 0.18, SE = 0.09, p < .87: WL; �0.10 units per
4 weeks; 95% CI �0.26 to 0.06, SE = 0.08, p < .23)
indicating persistence of gains in IBPI.
ECBI-P did not change significantly for either
group during intervention (IBPI; �0.30 units per
4 weeks; 95% CI �0.77 to 0.17, SE = 0.24, p < .24:
WL; 0.04 units per 4 weeks; 0.06, 95% CI �0.36 to
0.48, SE = 0.21, p < .7) or follow-up (IBPI; �0.15
units per 4 weeks; 95% CI �0.43 to 0.13, SE = 0.14,
p < .29: WL; �0.01 units per 4 weeks; 95% CI �0.28
to 0.24, SE = 0.13, p < .94).
ECBI-I indicated the same pattern during inter-
vention (IBPI; 0.79 units per 4 weeks; 95% CI �2.42
to 0.84, SE = 0.83, p < .24: WL; 0.64 units per
4 weeks; 95% CI �0.75 to 2.04, SE = 0.71, p < .37)
and follow-up (IBPI; �0.61 units per 4 weeks; 95%
CI �1.57 to 0.34, SE = 0.49, p < .21: WL; �0.46

During interven-
tion, dysfunctional parenting (PS3) decreased signif-
icantly for IBPI (�0.04 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI
�0.08 to �0.01, (.E. 0.02, p < .02) but not WL (�0.02
units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.05 to 0.01, SE = 0.02,
p < .27). Difference in slopes was not significant.
After 16 weeks PS3 did not change in IBPI (�0.004
units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.03 to 0.02, SE = 0.01,
p < .68)
but
decreased
in
WL
(0.03
units
per
4 weeks; 95% CI �0.05 to �0.01, SE = 0.01, p < .01).
Difference in slopes was not significant.
Parenting confidence (PSOC) increased signifi-
cantly for IBPI (1.18 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI
0.55 to 1.82, SE = 0.32, p < .01) but not for WL to
16 weeks (0.01 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.53 to
0.56, SE = 0.28, p < .96). This difference in slopes
was significant. After 16 weeks PSOC did not change
in either arm indicating persistence of gains for IBPI
(IBPI; 0.19 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.18 to 0.57,
SE = 0.19, p < .32: WL 0.18 units per 4 weeks; 95%
CI �0.17 to 0.53, SE = 0.18, p < .31).
Parenting stress (PSI) reduced significantly during
treatment for IBPI (�1.87 units per 4 weeks, 95% CI
�3.07 to �0.68, SE = 0.61, p < .01) but not WL (0.06
units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.96 to 1.08, SE = 0.52,
p < .91). This difference in slopes was significant.
After intervention there was no change in IBPI (0.02
units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �0.69 to 0.72, SE = 0.36,
p < .96) but a significant decrease in WL (�0.88
units per 4 weeks, 95% CI �1.51 to 0.24, SE = 0.32,
p < .01). Difference in slopes was not significant.
Secondary clinical outcomes
No significant differences were observed for sec-
ondary clinical outcomes. Table S3 provides sum-
mary
data
for
family
functioning,
self
and
observed-rated mood, Table S4 indicates comparative
analysis of slopes. Figures S7–S9 illustrate time to
relapse outcomes for any mood episode, mania and
depression. These did not differ between groups.
Discussion
IBPI is a new online intervention for parents with BD
with young children, combining self-management
information about BD with parenting information in
an interactive format and is the only online inter-
vention of this type we are aware of. This study
explored the feasibility and acceptability of IBPI and
the trial design and provided preliminary estimates
of
clinical
effects.
Retention
rate
was
90%
to
48 weeks
follow-up
balanced
across
both
arms
(analysable data varied across measures). 75% of
participants accessed the bipolar self-help modules
and 53% accessed Triple P modules: earlier modules
were more popular for both. The low level of access to
parenting modules is of concern for an intervention
intended to improve parenting outcomes. Future
iterations of this intervention could explore both
improved integration of bipolar and Triple P modules
and
possibly
whether
parenting
modules
alone
improve uptake. It is acknowledged that this sample
was self-selected which might reduce generalisability
of our findings, for instance most of our sample were
educated to degree level.
Despite modest level of use for Triple P content in
particular, clinical outcomes suggest IBPI partici-
pants improved relative to WL. Child behaviour
problems (SDQ) improved significantly during access
to IBPI sustained throughout follow-up. A similar
but nonsignificant pattern was observed for ECBI
problems and intensity. Parenting stress and confi-
dence (PSI and PSOC) improved significantly during
the intervention, sustained through follow-up. Dys-
functional parenting (PS3) also improved during IBPI
but more marginally as difference in slopes was not
significant. Household disturbance (CHAOS) did not
change in either arm. These results were despite
parenting problems not being a selection criterion. It
is possible that greater differences between groups
might have been observed had this criterion been
included
and
this
should
be
considered
in
a
future trial.
Parental mood and relapse were not significantly
different between arms although numerical pat-
terns favoured IBPI. An appropriately powered trial

 is required to evaluate definitively whether improve-
ments in child behaviour and parenting have sec-
ondary benefits for parental mood and relapse in a
broader sample.
There have been few studies of online parenting
interventions for severe mental health problems and
only one for BD specifically (Jones et al., 2014). IBPI
is less resource intensive than approaches described
in other online interventions (Danaher et al., 2013;
Kaplan et al., 2014; O’Mahen et al., 2014; van der
Zanden, Speetjens, Arntz, & Onrust, 2010), as it did
not include a facilitated forum or chat sessions. Our
findings are consistent with outcomes of studies of
Triple P Online with healthy parents of children with
disruptive behaviour (Sanders et al., 2012; Sanders,
Dittman et al., 2014).
This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, it
was designed primarily to determine feasibility and
acceptability so was not powered specifically to
detect clinical outcome. Despite this there was
significant and sustained change in some parenting
and child behaviour measures, but other effects may
have been missed due to power issues. Secondly,
although BD and parenting elements of IBPI were
designed to be linked, integration was not perfect as
Triple P Online is designed for parents of all types.
Stronger results might have been obtained from a
further iteration of the intervention to tailor the
parenting modules more specifically to BD. Thirdly,
although overall retention was high, there was
variability in the number of measures completed by
participants at each time point. Exploration of addi-
tional approaches to enhance data completeness
would be important for a future definitive trial.
Highest completion rates were for observer-rated
measures so consideration should be given to pro-
viding telephone support for self-report measures.
Fourthly, level of site use was quite low, Sanders
et al. (2012) reported that 96% of their parents used
Triple P Online compared with 53%, in the current
study (77% accessed the bipolar modules). Future
studies should incorporate factors likely to further
enhance
site
engagement
including
additional
e-prompts (Alkhaldi et al., 2016).
Conclusions
IBPIis afeasible interventionwith positive outcomes for
parenting and child behaviour. A future definitive trial
is needed to confirm current effects, explore possible
impact on parental mood and determine cost-effective-
ness. IBPI has potential to deliver an accessible,
nonstigmatising intervention to bipolar parents at low
cost. As this intervention requires very little profes-
sional support it could be offered as a supplement to
current services without significant additional invest-
ment. Further research will be needed to explore in the
longer term whether the beneficial impacts of the
intervention translate into reduced risks of longer-
term mental health problems in addition to shorter
term improvements in current child behaviour.

Web based parenting intervention for parents with bipolar disorder
1039
 Key points
• The study compared a novel web-based self-management intervention for parents with bipolar disorder with
children aged 3–10 years with waitlist control in an RCT.
• The intervention and trial design were feasible and acceptable.
• Parents in the intervention arm reported improved child behaviour and parenting to 48 week follow-up.
• Parental mood and mood relapses were not significantly different between treatment arms.
• This low cost, flexible intervention may have potential for supporting parents with bipolar disorder.
• Longer term benefits for children are unknown.
