replication defects at telomeres resulting
in telomere fragility, replication fork

SUMMARY
Genome sequencing studies have revealed a number
of cancer-associated mutations in the telomere-
binding factor POT1. Here, we show that when
combined with p53 deficiency, depletion of murine
POT1a in common lymphoid progenitor cells fosters
genetic instability, accelerates the onset, and in-
creases the severity of T cell lymphomas. In parallel,
we examined human and mouse cells carrying POT1
mutations found in cutaneous T cell lymphoma
(CTCL) patients. Inhibition of POT1 activates ATR-
dependent DNA damage signaling and induces telo-
mere fragility, replication fork stalling, and telomere
elongation. Our data suggest that these phenotypes
are linked to impaired CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) func-
tion at telomeres. Lastly, we show that proliferation
of cancer cells lacking POT1 is enabled by the atten-
uation of the ATR kinase pathway. These results un-
cover a role for defective telomere replication during
tumorigenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Telomere dysfunction has been proposed as a key event that
causes transient genomic instability during cancer progression
(Artandi et al., 2000). According to this model, progressive
telomere shortening in preneoplastic cells results in telomere
dysfunction and end-to-end chromosomal fusions. The resulting
dicentric chromosomes undergo cycles of breakage-fusion-
bridge (BFB) and lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements.
At this stage, reactivation of telomerase (or engagement of the
alternative lengthening of telomeres [ALT] pathway) prevents
further telomere dysfunction and allows cancer cells to prolifer-
ate indefinitely. This model has been validated in vivo using a
mouse model in which telomerase activity can be experimentally
re-activated (Ding et al., 2012). Additional evidence in support of
this paradigm emerged from the analysis of telomere dynamics
in human tumors (Chin et al., 2004; Gordon et al., 2003; Rudolph
et al., 2001) and the detection of telomeric fusions in several
types of cancers (Lin et al., 2010; Simpson et al., 2015).
Mutations affecting the telomere-binding protein protection of
telomeres 1 (POT1) have been reported in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) (Quesada et al., 2011; Ramsay et al., 2013), famil-
ial melanoma (Robles-Espinoza et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014), car-
diac angiosarcoma (Calvete et al., 2015), glioma (Bainbridge
et al., 2014), mantle cell lymphoma (Zhang et al., 2014), and
parathyroid adenoma (Newey et al., 2012). Interestingly, analysis
of the clonal evolution of CLL suggested that POT1 alterations
arise during early leukemic development and are likely to
contribute to disease progression (Landau et al., 2013). POT1
is a member of the six subunit shelterin complex that also com-
prises TRF1, TRF2, TPP1, TIN2, and RAP1 (de Lange, 2005).
POT1 is anchored to telomeres by forming a heterodimer with
TPP1, which is in turn tethered to the rest of the shelterin com-
plex by TIN2 (Liu et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2004). POT1 binds
single-stranded telomeric DNA (ssDNA) using two conserved
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) folds (Baumann
and Cech, 2001; Lei et al., 2004), and has been proposed to
counteract RPA binding (Flynn et al., 2011; Gong and de Lange,
2010). Depletion of POT1 in human cells elicits a DNA damage
response (DDR) leading to the accumulation of telomere-
dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) and telomere fusions (Hocke-
meyer et al., 2005). Mice have two POT1 paralogs (POT1a and
POT1b) that differ in their functions, with POT1a being most
functionally related to human POT1. Depletion of POT1a leads
to telomere dysfunction and results in embryonic lethality (Hock-
emeyer et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006). In contrast, loss of POT1b
leads to excessive elongation of the 30 overhang (Hockemeyer
et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006) and does not impair the viability of
mice (Hockemeyer et al., 2006). Interestingly, conditional inacti-
vation of POT1a in vivo induces different phenotypes depending
on the cellular context. Depletion of POT1a in the nervous
system leads to cellular attrition and disruption of neurogen-
esis (Lee et al., 2014). In contrast, POT1a depletion in the
endometrium has no detectable consequences, but accelerates
endometrial carcinogenesis in p53 null settings (Akbay et al.,
2013). The POT1/TPP1 heterodimer also plays a key role in

 telomere length control (Nandakumar et al., 2012; Xin et al.,
2007; Zhong et al., 2012; Lei et al., 2005; Loayza and De Lange,
2003).
The reported cancer-associated POT1 mutations cluster in the
OB domains and disrupt the binding of POT1 to ssDNA in vitro
(Quesada et al., 2011; Ramsay et al., 2013; Robles-Espinoza
et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014; Trigueros-Motos, 2014). Despite
their prevalence among different cancer types, the mechanism
by which POT1 mutations alter proper telomere function and in-
fluence tumor progression remains unclear. Limited functional
analysis indicated that POT1 mutations promote excessive telo-
mere elongation and an increase in telomere fragility (Ramsay
et al., 2013; Robles-Espinoza et al., 2014). The telomere length-
ening phenotype indicates that the mutations possibly act by ex-
tending cellular lifespan, which would enable further acquisition
of cancer promoting mutations. However, the telomere fragility
suggests that these mutations may induce telomere dysfunction
leading to genome instability and tumor progression.
To elucidate the impact of POT1 inhibition in vivo, we
conditionally deleted POT1a in lymphoid progenitor cells. The
lymphatic system represents an ideal setting to address the con-
sequences of POT1 inactivation, especially given the reported
occurrence of somatic POT1 mutations in lymphoid tumors
(Ramsay et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). Our data demonstrate
that POT1 inactivation synergistically cooperates with p53 loss
to promote malignancy. Tumors derived from POT1 depleted
cells display hallmarks of telomere dysfunction, including chro-
mosome end-to-end fusions, telomere fragility, and gross chro-
mosomal rearrangements. Similarly, expression of POT1 muta-
tions (F62V and K90E) identified in cutaneous T cell lymphoma
(CTCL) patients resulted in telomere fragility, chromosome fu-
sions, ATR-dependent DNA damage activation, and replication
fork stalling. Interestingly, our results indicate that POT1 inhibi-
tion leads to a concomitant impairment in CST function. Based
on our data, we propose that inactivation of POT1 triggers
telomere dysfunction due to defective telomere replication, ulti-
mately leading to genome instability and enhanced tumorigen-
esis. Our data also suggest that growth of cancer cells carrying
POT1 mutations is potentially achieved by a compensatory
pathway that attenuates the ATR-dependent DDR pathway.
Altogether, our data describe a unique mechanism by which
defective telomere replication exacerbates tumor growth.
RESULTS
POT1a Inactivation in Common Lymphoid Progenitor
Cells
The frequency of POT1 mutations in cancers of lymphoid origin
prompted us to investigate the consequences of POT1 inhibition
in common progenitor lymphoid (CLPs) cells. Given the close
functional similarity between mouse POT1a and human POT1,
we crossed POT1a conditional knockout mice (Hockemeyer
et al., 2006) with the CLP cells specific CRE line hCD2-
iCRE (de Boer et al., 1988) and generated a cohort of
POT1aF/FhCD2Cre (hereafter referred to as POT1Cd2) mice. The
resulting mice were viable, but displayed a marked reduction in
circulating mature B and T cells and fewer splenic B cells and
CD4+CD8+ thymic T cells (Figures 1A and S1A–S1G and data
not shown). To test whether this reduction was caused by the
induction of a DDR, we crossed POT1aF/FhCD2Cre with mice
harboring a conditional p53 allele (Marino et al., 2000) and
generated animals in which both p53 and POT1a were depleted
from CLP cells (Figure S1A). The resulting mice (3 weeks of age)
had a partial rescue of CD4+CD8+ thymocyte development
(Figures S1B and S1C) when compared to POT1Cd2 mice. In
contrast, viability of B cells was not rescued by depletion of
p53 (Figures S1E–S1G). Gene expression analysis indicates
that the observed difference in viability is not due to differential
expression levels of Pot1a and Pot1b in B and T cells (Fig-
ure S1H). Our data therefore show that upon POT1a depletion,
B cells elicit a p53-independent cell death pathway, while
T cells initiate a cell death response that is partially dependent
on p53 activation.
Somatic Inactivation of POT1a and p53 Predisposes
Mice to Thymic Lymphomas
To evaluate the cooperation between POT1 and p53 inactiva-
tion during tumor progression, we monitored cohorts of
POT1a+/+p53Flox/FloxhCD2Cre
(p53Cd2),
POT1aFlox/Floxp53+/+
hCD2Cre
(POT1Cd2),
and
POT1aFlox/Floxp53Flox/FloxhCD2Cre
(POT1p53Cd2) mice. None of the wild-type controls or the
POT1Cd2 mice developed cancers (Figure 1B), whereas the ma-
jority of p53Cd2 mice presented with tumors by 20 weeks of age
and displayed a median lifespan of 24 weeks. p53Cd2 mice
developed both T cell lymphomas (14/18) as well as B cell lym-
phomas (4/18), and this is in agreement with the established
role for p53 in the suppression of tumor formation in hematopoi-
etic progenitors (Yin et al., 2011). Remarkably, POT1p53Cd2 mice
had significantly shorter lifespans than the p53Cd2 mice, with a
median age of 17 weeks (Figure 1B). This significant (log rank
test p < 0.01) difference in tumor-free survival suggests that
POT1 inactivation cooperates with p53 loss during tumor forma-
tion. Strikingly, all (18/18) POT1p53Cd2 mice developed thymic
lymphomas and did not show signs of other malignancies (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D), suggesting that POT1 inactivation alters the
distribution of T versus B cell lymphomas. Interestingly, the
vast majority of thymic lymphomas in POT1p53Cd2 mice dissem-
inated to both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, such as liver,
kidney, and lungs (Figure 1E). In contrast, only a small fraction
(�20%) of thymic lymphomas in p53Cd2 mice spread to other
tissues (Figure 1E). The T cell origin of the metastasis was
confirmed by staining for the T cell marker CD3 by immunohisto-
chemistry (Figure 1E) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis (data not shown). In conclusion, our results
show that POT1 inhibition cooperates with p53 inactivation dur-
ing the development of invasive thymic lymphomas.

 Increased Genome Instability in POT1p53Cd2 Mice
Next, we assessed whether the role of POT1 inactivation in tu-
mor progression was correlated with increased genome insta-
bility. To this end, we performed a set of analyses to define the
level of genomic instability observed in tumors derived from
p53Cd2 and POT1p53Cd2 mice. First, we performed whole
transcriptome analysis of tumors derived from p53Cd2 and
POT1p53Cd2 mice. In tissues from POT1p53Cd2 tumors, we
detected several transcripts derived from the fusion of genes
located on distinct chromosomes (Figure 2A). On average, tu-
mors from POT1p53Cd2 mice contained three times more gene
fusion products compared to those derived from p53Cd2 mice,
indicating a greater degree of genome instability (Figures 2B,
S2A, and S2B). To further strengthen this observation, we
collected metaphase spreads from freshly isolated p53Cd2
and POT1p53Cd2 thymic lymphomas. Telomeric fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that tumor cells
lacking POT1 show a significant increase in end-to-end chromo-
somal fusions (Figures 2C and 2D). Interestingly, telomeres
derived from POT1p53Cd2 tumors show elevated levels of telo-
mere fragility (Figures 2C and 2D), a phenotype indicative of
replication-dependent defects at telomeres (Sfeir et al., 2009).
To further characterize the level of chromosomal instability, we
carried out spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis on cells derived
from p53Cd2 and POT1p53Cd2 tumors (Figure 2E) and noted
that lymphomas from POT1p53Cd2 mice had elevated levels of
chromosomal translocations relative to p53Cd2 mice (Figures
2E, S2D, and S2E). Lastly, POT1p53Cd2 tumors are character-
ized by the presence of aberrant mitotic figures (Figures 2F,
S2F, and S2G), which were not detected in p53Cd2 tumors
(Figures S2F and S2G). Collectively, these data show that
the tumors derived from POT1p53Cd2 mice display increased
levels of chromosome instability when compared to tumors
derived from p53Cd2 mice, thereby establishing a role for POT1
inhibition in the onset of genome instability that promotes
tumorigenesis.
Somatic POT1 Mutations in CTCL
Next, we tested whether expression of cancer-associated POT1
mutations caused similar phenotypes to those detected upon
POT1a inhibition in vivo. POT1 mutations were found in �10%
of patients with CTCL by whole exome sequencing (Choi et al.,
2015) (Figures 3A and S3A). We found two recurrent amino
acid alterations (p.K90 and p.F62) that occurred in more than
one cancer sample (Figure 3A). All cases with POT1 mutations
had concomitant inactivating mutations in TP53 (Figure S3A).
There were two CTCLs with p.F62 alterations (p.F62V and
p.F62I). The p.K90E substitution was also identified in patients
with CLL (Ramsay et al., 2013). We therefore focused on these
two alleles (p.F62V and p.K90E) for further analysis. Of note,
these two somatic mutations (p.F62V and p.K90E) were highly
clonal (occurring in >95% of cancer cells), suggesting they
occurred early in disease pathogenesis (data not shown).
Characterization of POT1-F62V and POT1-K90E
To address the impact of F62V and K90E substitutions on the
association of POT1 with ssDNA, we performed electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSA). Expression and purification of re-
combinant wild-type and mutant human POT1 was carried out
using a baculovirus expression system (Figure S3B). The results
indicate that the F62V substitution substantially diminishes the
binding affinity of POT1 to a telomeric substrate comprising
three TTAGGG repeats (Figures 3B and 3C). This result is in
agreement with previous structural and biochemical analyses
that denote the importance of this phenylalanine residue for
ssDNA binding (Lei et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2006). Additionally,
the significantly reduced ability of POT1-F62V to bind telomere
DNA in vitro is consistent with limited analysis carried out on a
handful of cancer-associated POT1 mutations thus far (Ramsay
et al., 2013; Robles-Espinoza et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014).
As opposed to POT1-F62V, which was strongly impaired for
DNA binding in vitro, the POT1-K90E mutant allele binds telo-
mere DNA with similar affinity as POT1-WT (Figures 3B and
3C). The K90E substitution did not grossly alter the specificity
of POT1 to telomere DNA, since no binding to a non-TTAGGG
substrate was noted (data not shown). The striking difference
in DNA binding affinity between the two mutations prompted
us to investigate how they impact telomere maintenance and
protection.
To elucidate the impact of the CTCL-associated mutations on
telomere function at the cellular level, we pursued two comple-
mentary approaches. First, we generated heterologous cell lines
in which Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant POT1 alleles (F62V
and K90E) were overexpressed in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma
cells and POT1a alleles were overexpressed in mouse em-
bryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure S3C). In an independent
approach, which allows us to investigate the mutations when
expressed at endogenous levels, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene
targeting to manipulate the POT1 locus in human retinal pigment
epithelium-1 (RPE-1) cells and the POT1a locus in mouse embry-
onic stem cells (mESCs) (Figures S3D–S3F).
The growth rate of HT1080 cells expressing POT1 mutations
was similar to control cells (Figure S3G) and their cell cycle pro-
file was unaffected (Figure S3H). Similarly, we generated several
clonally derived cell lines carrying heterozygous and homozy-
gous alleles of POT1a-K90E and POT1a-F62V, suggesting that
the mutations do not grossly alter cellular survival. Indirect immu-
nofluorescence (IF) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
demonstrated that the mutant alleles are capable of localizing
to telomere DNA (Figures S3I–S3K). These results are expected
since POT1 recruitment to telomere DNA is mediated by an
interaction with TPP1 (Liu et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2004), and the
mutations lie in a region that does not interfere with POT1-
TPP1 binding (Figure 3A).
CTCL-Associated POT1 Mutations Promote Telomere
Elongation
To determine whether POT1 mutations affect telomere length
homeostasis and overhang processing, we cultured HT1080
cells overexpressing mutant POT1 alleles for increased popula-
tion doublings (PDs) alongside cells expressing wild-type POT1
and control cells (Figure 3D). Telomere restriction fragment
(TRF) analysis indicated that both mutations resulted in a signif-
icant and gradual increase in telomere length (Figures 3D, S3L,
and S3M). In addition, expression of POT1-K90E and POT1-
F62V lead to a small reduction in overhang signal (Figures S3L

 and S3M), similar to the phenotype observed upon depleting
POT1 from human cells (Hockemeyer et al., 2005) and following
the deletion of POT1a from MEFs (Hockemeyer et al., 2006).
Elongated telomeres were also observed in CRISPR/Cas9 tar-
geted cells carrying mutant POT1 (Figures S3N and S3O). In
conclusion, despite the significant difference in DNA binding
affinities (Figures 3B and 3C), both POT1 mutations lead to a
comparable telomere elongation. A similar telomere-lengthening
phenotype was previously noted in patient-derived cells carrying
analogous POT1 mutations (Ramsay et al., 2013; Robles-Espi-

subsequently computed from the differences in
median telomere length between lanes.
noza et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014; Tri-
gueros-Motos, 2014). The observed telo-
mere elongation is reminiscent of the
phenotype observed after partial inhibi-
tion of DNA replication in human cells
that have been treated with low levels of
aphidicolin (Sfeir et al., 2009; Tong et al.,
2015).
POT1 Mutations Activate an ATR-
Dependent DDR and Induce
Telomere Fragility
We next asked whether CTCL-associated
mutations impair the protective function
of POT1 at telomeres. Using IF-FISH (IF
for 53BP1 coupled with FISH for telo-
meres), we found that cells (HT1080 and
MEFs) expressing F62V and K90E mu-
tants have frequent TIFs (Takai et al.,
2003) (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A). We
also observed a significant increase in
the TIF response in human and mouse
cells carrying homozygous alleles for
F62V and K90E (Figures 4C, 4D, and
S4B). Notably, the expression of these
CTCL-associated POT1 mutations induced an ATR-dependent
DDR, as seen by the significant abrogation of TIFs in HT1080
cells treated with an ATR inhibitor (Figure 4B), led to the accumu-
lation of RPA foci at telomere DNA (Figure S4C), and induced
chromosome end-to-end fusions (Figures S4F and S4G). In addi-
tion, chromosome analysis revealed that POT1 mutations
increased the incidence of fragile telomeres (Figures 4E and
S4D), similarly to what was observed in thymic lymphomas
derived from POT1p53Cd2 mice (Figure 2D). Complementation
of POT1p53Cd2 thymocytes confirmed that POT1a mutant alleles
Cell Reports 15, 2170–2184, June 7, 2016
2175
 are unable to suppress telomere fragility. Indeed, re-expression
of a wild-type POT1a allele reduced the frequency of fragile telo-
meres, however, both mutants failed to rescue the telomere
fragility caused by POT1a depletion (Figures 4F and S4E). Alto-
gether, our data indicate that expression of cancer associated
POT1 alleles inhibit the function of a key shelterin component,
potentially leading to replication stress and telomere dysfunction.
POT1 Inhibition Induces Replication Fork Stalling at
Telomeres
To address the impact of POT1 mutations on telomere replica-
tion in a direct manner, we performed single-molecule analysis
of replicated DNA (SMARD) (Norio and Schildkraut, 2001) and
examined the progression of replication forks through telomere
DNA at single-molecule level. Analysis of CldU and IdU labeled
molecules, including ones which carry a subtelomeric DNA
segment, revealed several cases of labeling patterns indicative
of replication fork stalling before or within the telomeric DNA (Fig-
ures 5A, 5B, and S5). The partially labeled telomere molecules
were significantly enriched in cells expressing F62V and K90E
when compared to cells expressing wild-type POT1a (Figure 5C).
Thus, inhibiting POT1 function appears to challenge normal
progression of the replication fork as it copies telomere DNA.
POT1 Inhibition and the Impairment of CST Function at
Telomeres
The telomere phenotypes caused by expression of the POT1-
F62V and POT1-K90E alleles are reminiscent of the telomere
aberrations caused by depletion of the CST complex. Indeed, in-
hibition of CST leads to ATR activation, telomere fragility, and
significant lengthening of telomeres (Chen et al., 2012, 2013;
Gu et al., 2012; Kasbek et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2012). We
therefore wondered whether POT1 acts in the same pathway
as the CST complex to promote efficient telomere replication.
To test this hypothesis, we treated HT1080 cells overexpressing
wild-type or mutant POT1 with small hairpin (sh)RNAs against
CTC1 and STN1, independently. The TIFs response elicited by
the two POT1 mutants was not further enhanced following the
depletion of CST factors (Figures 6A and S6A–S6C). Moreover,
the percentage of fragile telomeres caused by the mutations
did not significantly increase when CTC1 was inhibited (Figures
6B, S6A, and S6B). These results suggest that POT1 mutants
act in the same pathway as CST inhibition to alter telomere
replication.
In recent years, it has become evident that the association
of CST with telomeres is modulated by the interaction with
the POT1/TPP1 heterodimer (Chen et al., 2012; Wan et al.,
2009; Wu et al., 2012). We therefore set out to test whether the
POT1 mutations destabilize the association between CST and
the shelterin complex. To address this possibility, we transiently
co-expressed FLAG-CST, HA-TPP1, and wild-type or mutant
Myc-POT1. IP with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by western
blot analysis for HA and Myc suggested that the K90E and
F62V substitution in POT1 do not impact the interaction between
CST and the TPP1/POT1 complex (Figures S6D and S6E).
Intriguingly, however, pull-down experiments showed a small,
but significant, reduction in the interaction between FLAG-
STN1 and HA-TEN1 in the presence of Myc-POT1-K90E or
Myc-POT1-F62V (Figures S6F and S6G). In summary, the co-
IP analyses suggest that alterations in the OB fold domain of
POT1 are unlikely to compromise the direct interaction between
the TPP1/POT1 heterodimer and the CST complex, yet both
substitutions subtly destabilize CST complex assembly, poten-
tially altering its function at telomeres. To address the impact
of POT1 mutations on the telomeric-localization of CST in a
direct manner, we generated knockin cells where endogenous
TEN1 was tagged with three FLAG epitoptes and performed
ChIP using FLAG antibodies. As evident by the results from
the ChIP analysis, a small reduction in TEN1 localization at
telomeres resulted when POT1-F62V and POT1-K90E were
expressed (Figures 6C and S6H–S6J). Furthermore, overexpres-
sion of TEN1 and STN1 was capable of partially complementing
the phenotypes associated with the POT1 mutations, indicated
by the repression of telomere fragility in HT1080 cells expressing
K90E and F62V (Figures 6D and S6K–S6M). Taken together, our
data highlight a previously unanticipated functional interaction
between POT1 and CST to ensure faithful telomere replication.
Attenuation of the ATR DDR Pathway in POT1p53Cd2
Tumors
So far, our data demonstrate that the development and progres-
sion of POT1-deficient tumors (Figure 1B) and the proliferation of
POT1 mutant cells (Figures 4 and S3G) take place despite robust
telomere dysfunction. To gain insight into the specific pathways
that enable cellular growth in settings where POT1 is inactivated,
we analyzed the transcription profile of thymic lymphomas
derived from p53Cd2 and POT1p53Cd2 mice. Our goal was to
identify potential differences in gene expression between tumors
developing in the context of p53 deficiency alone and the
aggressive malignancy resulting from the additional loss of
POT1. RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis of seven tumors derived
from p53Cd2 and POT1p53Cd2 mice identified 400 genes that
are differentially expressed between the genotypes (Figures 7A
and S7A). Interestingly, when we selectively examined the
expression of known DDR genes and ranked them based on dif-
ferential expression, we noted a significant reduction of DNA
damage genes, most notably genes in the ATR pathway such
as RPA1, ATR, and ATRIP (Figures 7A and S7A). Quantitative
(q)PCR
analysis
confirmed
that
tumors
derived
from
POT1p53Cd2 mice have lower expression of ATR and RPA1
when compared to thymic lymphomas derived from p53Cd2
mice (Figure S7B). Notably, we did not detect a significant differ-
ence in proliferation indexes between tumors derived from
p53Cd2 and POT1p53Cd2 mice (Figures S2F and S2G), excluding
that alterations in these genes is caused by cell cycle defects.
These results suggest that in POT1 deficient tumors, a reduced
level of expression of key ATR signaling factors allows cells to
evade cell cycle checkpoints. To corroborate this finding, we as-
sessed whether tumor cells derived from POT1p53Cd2 mice
showed any defect in the activation of ATR signaling. Our data
indicate that cells isolated from POT1p53Cd2 mice when chal-
lenged with UV irradiation had a severe impairment in the activa-
tion (phosphorylation) of the checkpoint kinase CHK1 (Figure 7B),
a key downstream target of the ATR kinase. Finally, to test
whether attenuation of the DDR in response to POT1 inhibition
occurs in other cell types, we used mouse ES cells in which

 the endogenous POT1 gene was mutated to the F62V allele
(Figures S3E and S4B). Using these cells, we could assess
the long-term TIF response to POT1 inhibition in an isogenic
setting. Consistent with our in vivo data, we found that when
cultured for �50 passages (late PD), POT1-F62V ES cells down-
regulate the DDR and accumulate less TIFs in comparison to the
same clones analyzed shortly after gene targeting (early PD)
(Figure 7C).
DISCUSSION
The experiments described here define a previously unrecog-
nized mechanism for telomere-driven genomic instability in
cancer cells. In addition to the classical view of telomere-
dysfunction due to telomere attrition, our findings highlight telo-
mere replication stress as an additional pathway that leads to
genomic rearrangements and fuels cancer progression. POT1
mutations have been previously documented in a number of
cancers, including CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, melanoma, and
glioma (Bainbridge et al., 2014; Quesada et al., 2011; Ramsay
et al., 2013; Robles-Espinoza et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014).
Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that POT1 inac-
tivation contributes to cancer progression in the lymphatic
system. We also identified two recurrent cancer-associated mu-
tations in CTCL and elucidated the mechanistic basis for their
potential tumor promoting activity.
POT1 Inhibition in Lymphoid Cells Promotes Tumor
Progression
Germline deletion of POT1a is lethal in mice, a phenotype that
cannot be rescued by p53 inactivation (Hockemeyer et al.,
2006). Conditional inactivation of POT1 in vivo yields different
phenotypes depending on tissue and cell type. Depletion of
POT1a in neural stem cells results in impaired neurogenesis, a
phenotype that can be rescued by p53 inactivation without pro-
moting tumor formation (Lee et al., 2014). In striking contrast,
depletion of POT1a in the endometrial epithelium had no detect-
able consequences on cell survival, but when combined with
p53 inactivation resulted in accelerated tumor formation (Akbay
et al., 2013). Mutations in human POT1 have not been associ-
ated with neurological defects nor with endometrial cancers,
thus the implication of these findings for human health remains
to be established. Here, we show that inactivation of POT1 in
the lymphatic system accelerates the development of T cell

 lymphomas, which genetically mimics leukemic CTCL and have
widespread genomic instability (Choi et al., 2015). While we
cannot exclude that the compromised immune surveillance
associated with POT1 deficiency is potentially contributing to
tumor formation, we propose that POT1 inactivation in preneo-
plastic cells fosters genomic instability which enables cancer
cells to acquire additional mutations to support unlimited growth
and aggressive behavior (Figure 7D). In agreement with this
hypothesis, we found that POT1a inactivation in mice results
in telomere dysfunction (telomere fragility and telomere fusions)
and genomic instability (chromosomal translocations), leading
to the formation of lethal thymic lymphomas that invade sur-
rounding tissues. Similarly, in CLL patients, POT1 mutations
are associated with the more aggressive type of cancers (Ram-
say et al., 2013).
Interestingly, our data indicate that depletion of POT1a shifts
the tumor spectrum toward T cell lymphomas. While p53 deple-
tion in CLP cells results in both T cell and B cell lymphomas,
mice lacking p53 and POT1a primarily develop T cell lym-
phomas. A possible explanation for this finding is that T cell lym-
phomas in POT1p53cd2 mice are highly aggressive leading to
accelerated lethality and precluding the development of the
less aggressive B cell lymphomas. In agreement with this
hypothesis, other mouse models that exacerbate p53 tumori-
genesis also show a shift toward aggressive thymic lymphomas
(Takahashi et al., 2007). Alternatively, it is possible that B cells
are inherently less resistant to telomere dysfunction. In that re-
gards, novel mouse models aimed at targeting POT1a and p53
depletion only in B cells will be required to fully address the
latter possibility.

 Shelterin Mutations: An Independent Pathway to Induce
Genomic Instability in Tumors
Mutations in the shelterin subunits TIN2 (Walne et al., 2008) and
TPP1 (Guo et al., 2014) have been previously identified in
patients with critically short telomeres affected by bone marrow
failure and dyskeratosis congenita. The increased risk of cancer
associated with these mutations is linked to telomere attrition. So
far, mutations in POT1 have not been found in short-telomeres

(D) Model depicting the proposed mechanism by which POT1 mutations shape tumor progression. POT1 inhibition impairs the function of CST at telomeres
possibly by destabilizing the interaction between STN1 and TEN1. This then induces replication-dependent telomere defects (telomere fragility, ATR-dependent
signaling, telomere elongation, and chromosome end-to-end fusions), which in turn triggers chromosomal instability. Ultimately, attenuation of the DDR enables
the proliferation of cancer cells, leading to more aggressive tumors.

 syndromes. Instead, POT1 is the first subunit of the shelterin
complex to show recurrent mutations in various types of
cancers. The mechanism linking POT1 mutations with tumor
development has been speculative. Our results show that
POT1 mutations stimulate telomere elongation and telomere
dysfunction, indicating that the compromised function of the
shelterin complex can lead to tumorigenesis independent of
the classic telomere erosion mechanism. Our findings raise
the question of whether mutations in other shelterin subunits
(or their accessory factors) might contribute to tumor progres-
sion, particularly mutations affecting telomere replication. In
agreement with this hypothesis, recent experiments have shown
that reduced TRF1 levels in mice can increase lymphoid tumor
formation (Hartmann et al., 2016), and deletion of TRF1 in p53
null keratinocytes leads to squamous cell carcinomas (Martı
´nez
et al., 2009). TRF1 has been shown to play a crucial role in telo-
mere replication (Martı
´nez et al., 2009; Sfeir et al., 2009), sug-
gesting that mice with reduced levels of TRF1 could display
defective telomere replication. In addition, mice carrying muta-
tions in RTEL1, a helicase that acts downstream of TRF1 in as-
sisting telomere replication, display accelerated tumorigenesis
when analyzed in the context of p53 deficiency (Vannier et al.,
2013). It remains to be determined whether TRF1, RTEL1, and
other telomere binding proteins are mutated in human cancers.
Notably, SNPs in CTC1 and STN1 have been recently identified
as risk factors in gliomas (Walsh et al., 2015).
A New Role for POT1 in Suppressing Telomere Defects
Induced by Replication Stress
The highly repetitive and G-rich nature of telomere DNA makes it
especially prone to forming G-quadruplex-like structures that
can impede replicative polymerases as they duplicate telomere
DNA (Parkinson et al., 2002). Telomeres evolved special ways
to prevent replication fork stalling and assist fork restart. The
shelterin subunit, TRF1, recruits unwinding helicases, including
RTEL1 and BLM to resolve secondary structures and allow
fork progression (Sfeir et al., 2009; Vannier et al., 2012, 2013;
Zimmermann et al., 2014). In addition, the hetero-trimeric CST
complex has been shown to assist in telomere duplication by
enabling replication fork restart, independent of TRF1 activity
(Stewart et al., 2012).
Our results highlight a previously unrecognized role for POT1
during telomere replication and suggest that this function is
potentially linked to the CST complex. How the two complexes
cooperate to ensure proper telomere duplication is far from being
understood. A direct interaction between CST and TPP1/POT1
was previously reported, whereby TPP1 binds to STN1 in human
cells (Chen et al., 2012, 2013), and POT1b recruits mouse STN1
during C-strand fill-in synthesis (Wu et al., 2012). This suggests
that the interaction between the two complexes is multi-faceted
and likely to be subject to different levels of regulation. Here,
we identify two CTCL-associated mutations in the first OB fold
domain of POT1 (F62V and K90E) that display very different bind-
ing affinities to telomere DNA in vitro, but lead to similar telomere
phenotypes in vivo. We find that the two mutations do not impact
the association between POT1/TPP1 and the CST complex.
Instead, both F62V and K90E substitutions slightly affect CST
complex assembly and impact its association with telomeres.
Structural Insight into the Deleterious Effect of F62V
and K90E on the POT1-CST Interaction
To gain insight into how the cancer-associated POT1 mutations
F62V and K90E could affect the function of the CST complex at
telomeres, we analyzed the structural implication of these muta-
tions.ThecrystalstructureofhumanPOT1 incomplexwithssDNA
reveals that a single, continuous nucleoprotein molecular surface
is formed by the side-by-side packing of the K90 residue and
ssDNA,while F62 makes a strong geometrically constrained bind-
ing interaction with ssDNA (Figure S7C). Mutation of either of
these sites is predicted to disrupt this surface, but only mutation
atF62would alsoabolishDNAbinding.This modelisinagreement
withtheinvitroDNAbindingassays(Figures3Band3C).Wespec-
ulate that this nucleoprotein surface serves as a scaffold for the
assemblyof the CSTcomplex and eitherofthese mutations would
affect CST assembly. According to this model, the F62 residue of
POT1 interacts directly with the ssDNA, while the K90 residue
would be potentially involved in the interaction with CST. An alter-
native model based on structural analysis predicts that the K90E
substitution might alter the conformation of ssDNA in the POT1-
ssDNA complex, which, in turn, might affect the CST complex
assembly. Undoubtedly, future biochemical and structural exper-
iments are required to further define the dynamic interplay
between the TPP1-POT1 complexes and the CST complex at te-
lomeric DNA. It is worth noting that recent work from Arabidopsis
thaliana highlighted an interaction between the OB fold domain of
POT1 and STN1 (Renfrew et al., 2014). In addition, expression of
STN1 mutants that interfere with proper CST complex assembly
leads to elongated telomeres and increased telomere fragility
(Bryan et al., 2013), phenotypes that closely resemble those
observed upon POT1 inhibition.
Attenuation of DDR Signaling as a Tumor Promoting
Mechanism
The discovery of shelterin mutations in tumors raises the ques-
tion of how tumor cells are able to proliferate despite high levels
of telomere dysfunction and the resulting activation of a DDR. In
the case of telomere erosion, re-activation of telomerase, or
engagement in the ALT pathway, enables cancer cells to sup-
press telomere dysfunction and proliferate indefinitely. Our
results indicate that attenuation of the ATR-dependent DDR rep-
resents one mechanism that allows tumor cells to bypass the
proliferation defect imposed by POT1 inhibition (Hockemeyer
et al., 2005, 2006). At a first glance, the impairment of the ATR-
pathway in POT1-mutated tumors might seem counterintuitive
especially that increased ATR signaling by activated oncogenes
allows tumor cells to cope with replicative stress (Lecona and
Ferna
´ ndez-Capetillo, 2014). However, attenuation of the ATR
pathway, perhaps in later stages of carcinogenesis or in the
context of other replicative-stressors, could potentially allow
tumor cells harboring replication defects to evade checkpoint
activation and cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this idea, ATR
or Chk1 heterozygous mice show increased incidence of tumors
(Brown and Baltimore, 2000; Liu et al., 2000; Tho et al., 2012).
In addition, somatic mutations in ATR and Chk1 have been found
in human tumors with microsatellite instability (Vassileva et al.,
2002). This observation is of interest given that complete sup-
pression of ATR is lethal and that inhibitors of this pathway
Cell Reports 15, 2170–2184, June 7, 2016
2181
 have been developed for clinical applications. It is tempting to
speculate that inhibition of the ATR pathway in tumors with an
attenuated ATR signaling might represent a valid treatment strat-
egy. In effect, slight perturbation in the levels of ATR signaling
might result in excessive inhibition of this essential signaling
pathway, leading to selective cell death of cancer cells. On the
other hand, one could imagine that treatments that reactivate
the ATR pathway in cancer cells with attenuated ATR signaling
might selectively kill such cancer cells without affecting healthy
surrounding cells.
