Although the brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit decreased brain pH relative to those of healthy controls
upon postmortem examination, it remains controversial whether this finding reflects a primary feature of the diseases or is a result of
confounding factors such as medication and agonal state. To date, systematic investigation of brain pH has not been undertaken using
animal models that can be studied without confounds inherent in human studies. In the present study, we first reevaluated the pH of the
postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by conducting a meta-analysis of existing data sets from 10 studies.
We then measured pH, lactate levels, and related metabolite levels in brain homogenates from five neurodevelopmental mouse models of
psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. All mice were drug naive with the same
agonal state, postmortem interval, and age within each strain. Our meta-analysis revealed that brain pH was significantly lower in patients
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than in control participants, even when a few potential confounding factors (postmortem interval,
age, and history of antipsychotic use) were considered. In animal experiments, we observed significantly lower pH and higher lactate levels
in the brains of model mice relative to controls, as well as a significant negative correlation between pH and lactate levels. Our findings
suggest that lower pH associated with increased lactate levels is not a mere artifact, but rather implicated in the underlying pathophysiology
of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) are highly heritable psychiatric conditions, with clinical
features transcending diagnostic categories (Hyman, 2010; Insel
et al, 2010). Accumulating evidence indicates that some genetic
influences (Carroll and Owen, 2009; Cross-Disorder Group of
the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013a, b; Lotan et al,
2014), gene expression abnormalities (Ellis et al, 2016; Shao and
Vawter, 2008), and neuronal dysfunctions (Goodkind et al,
2015; Yahata et al, 2016) associated with these conditions
overlap, suggesting a common underlying biological basis.
However, the shared neurobiological alterations among the
three conditions remain largely unknown.
A number of postmortem studies have indicated that pH is
decreased in the brains of patients with schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder (Guillozet-Bongaarts et al, 2014; Halim et al,
2008; Iwamoto et al, 2005; Lipska et al, 2006; Mistry et al,
2013; Prabakaran et al, 2004; Ryan et al, 2006; Shao and
Vawter, 2008; Sun et al, 2006; Torrey et al, 2005). Decreased
brain pH has also been observed in patients with ASD
(Young et al, 2011). In general, pH balance is considered
critical for maintaining optimal health, and low pH has been
associated with a number of somatic disorders (Kraut and
Madias, 2014; Narins and Emmett, 1980; Posner and Plum,
1967). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that lower pH
may exert a negative impact on brain function and play a key
role in the pathogenesis of various psychiatric disorders.
However, lower brain pH has largely been considered as an
artifact rather than a pathophysiology of such disorders.
Animal studies have indicated that chronic treatment with
antipsychotics may affect brain pH by increasing lactate
levels (Halim et al, 2008), and most patients with these
disorders receive chronic antipsychotic treatment through-
out their lives. In addition, the agonal state experienced

 before death decreases brain pH (Li et al, 2004; Tomita et al,
2004; Vawter et al, 2006), and this state may differ between
patients with psychiatric disorders and controls. In human
postmortem studies, it is technically difficult to exclude such
confounding factors and to determine whether decreased pH
and increased lactate levels are indeed artifacts.
In the present study, we first confirmed that patients with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit lower postmor-
tem brain pH by conducting a meta-analysis of publicly
available data sets. We then measured brain pH in multiple
mouse models of psychiatric disorders, which are devoid of
such confounding factors, in order to test the hypothesis that
decreased brain pH is a pathophysiological manifestation/
endophenotype of these disorders rather than a mere artifact.
We also measured lactate levels, increases in which have
frequently been linked to decreased pH in the brains of
patients with psychiatric disorders (Halim et al, 2008;
Prabakaran et al, 2004; Stork and Renshaw, 2005). To our
knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically
evaluate pH and lactate levels in mouse models of psychiatric
disorders that eliminate the confounds inherent in human
studies.
We focused on mouse models of psychiatric disorders
reported to exhibit neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the
brain, a part of which stay at a pseudo-immature state
(Hagihara et al, 2013). Specifically, we measured pH, lactate,
and related metabolite levels in the postmortem brains of the
following mouse models: schnurri-2 (Shn2) knockout (KO)
mice (Takao et al, 2013), forebrain-specific calcineurin (Cn)
KO mice (Cottrell et al, 2013; Miyakawa et al, 2003; Suh et al,
2013; Zeng et al, 2001), and neurogranin (Nrgn) KO mice
(Huang et al, 2006; Huang and Huang, 2012; Pak et al, 2000)
as a model of schizophrenia; mice with heterozygous
knockout
of
the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase II a (Camk2a HKO mice) (Hagihara et al, 2016;
Yamasaki et al, 2008) as a model of bipolar disorder; and
mice with heterozygous knockout of the long isoform of
chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (Chd8 HKO
mice) (Katayama et al, 2016) as a model of ASD. These
mouse strains are characterized by mutations in genes
implicated in the respective disorders and exhibit molecular
and behavioral abnormalities relevant to each condition,
indicating good construct and face validities, respectively (as
described in detail in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Data
We obtained pH data of healthy individuals and patients
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from the Stanley
Medical Research Institute (SMRI) database (https://www.
stanleygenomics.org). Duplicate data among studies in the
database were eliminated. In addition, we comprehensively
searched the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) database for studies
reporting individual pH data using the following terms:
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism. We also used pH
data for healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia
obtained from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource
Centre schizophrenia cohort (NSWBTRC-SC) (Fillman et al,
2013), and from a study by Dean et al (2016). Altogether, 10
publicly available data sets were utilized in the present study
(Supplementary Table S1): five schizophrenia data sets
(GSE17612, GSE21935, GSE21138, NSWBTRC-SC (Fillman
et al, 2013), and Dean et al, 2016)), one bipolar disorder data
set (GSE5392), and four combined schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder data sets (SMRI Collection A, SMRI Collection C,
GSE35977, GSE53987). In addition, we used data regarding
postmortem interval and age from these data sets, as well as
data regarding medication from SMRI Collection A, SMRI
Collection C, Dean et al, 2016, and GSE5392.
Animals
We measured pH, lactate, and related metabolite levels in
Shn2 KO mice (Takao et al, 2013) (n = 5, 6 (controls,
mutants)), Cn KO mice (Cottrell et al, 2013; Miyakawa et al,
2003; Suh et al, 2013; Zeng et al, 2001) (n = 6, 5), Nrgn KO
mice (Huang et al, 2006; Huang and Huang, 2012; Pak et al,
2000) (n = 6, 5), Camk2a HKO mice (Hagihara et al, 2016;
Yamasaki et al, 2008) (n = 5, 5), Chd8 HKO mice (Katayama
et al, 2016) (n = 5, 5), disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (Disc1)-
L100P mutant mice (n = 6, 6), Disc1-Q31L mutant mice
(n = 6, 6)( Shoji et al, 2012), voltage-gated calcium channel
β-anchoring and -regulatory protein (Barp) KO mice (Nakao
et al, 2015) (n = 10, 10), and their corresponding control
littermates. Shn2 KO and wild-type control mice were
obtained by breeding heterozygotes with a C57BL/6J back-
ground and those with a BALB/cA background (Takao et al,
2013). All other strains were characterized by a C57BL/6J
background. Both male and female mice were used in the
present study, as no difference in pH has been observed
between sexes (Catts et al, 2005). All mice were between 19
and 45 weeks of age, and no significant difference in age was
observed between controls and mutants within each strain
(Shn2 KO, 39.3 ± 3.0 weeks, controls (Con), 34.9 ± 1.2 weeks,
P = 0.19; Cn KO, 20.6 ± 0.47 weeks, Con, 20.6 ± 0.36 weeks,
P = 0.92; Nrgn KO, 32.9 ± 1.2 weeks, Con, 31.0 ± 0.14 weeks,
P = 0.12; Camk2a HKO, 33.0 ± 0.052 weeks, Con, 36.2 ± 1.9
weeks, P = 0.13; Chd8 HKO, 41.0 weeks, Con, 41.0 weeks;

weeks,
Con,

the institutional animal care and use committee of Fujita
Health University, based on the Law for the Humane
Treatment and Management of Animals and the Standards
Relating to the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals
and Relief of Pain. Every effort was made to minimize the
number of animals used. Shn2 KO, Cn KO, Nrgn KO,
Camk2a HKO, and Chd8 HKO mice—but not Disc1-L100P
mutant and Disc1-Q31L mutant, or Barp KO mice—exhibit
good construct and face validities for schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and ASD. Further details are included in the
Supplementary
Materials
and
Methods
(Supplementary
Table S2).
Measurement of pH
Mice were killed via cervical dislocation and decapitation,
following which whole brains were removed. The brains
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored

 at –80 °C until use. We measured brain pH as previously
described (Catts et al, 2005; Halim et al, 2008). Briefly,
mouse brains were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer
equipped with a conical pestle in ice-cold distilled H2O (5 ml
per 500 mg of tissue). The pH was measured using a pH
meter (LAQUA F-72, Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan) after a
three-point calibration at pH 4.0, pH 7.0, and pH 9.0. The
pH experiments were performed in triplicate for each
sample, following which homogenates were immediately
frozen and stored at –80 °C until required for further
analyses.
Lactate and Glucose Measurements
The concentration of lactate in the brain homogenates was
determined using a multi-assay analyzer (GM7 MicroStat;
Analox Instruments, London, UK) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. In our prior tests using several
samples, we loaded 5, 10, and 20 μl of supernatant to the
instrument, observing linear, volume-dependent increases in
the measured values (r240.99). Based on these results, we
used 20 μl of supernatant for lactate measurements. Simi-
larly, glucose concentrations in 20 μl supernatant samples
were determined using a multiassay analyzer following
calibration with 10 mmol/ml glucose standard solution. To
normalize the effects of differences in genetic background
and age among strains, Z-scores for pH and lactate levels
were calculated within each strain and used for the
correlation analysis.
Pyruvate Measurement
Pyruvate concentrations in 20 μl supernatant samples were
determined using a pyruvate assay kit (BioVision, Mountain
View, CA). The fluorescence intensities were measured using
a microplate reader equipped with a spectrofluorometer
(ARVO X, PerkinElmer).
Adenosine Diphosphate/Adenosine Triphosphate (ADP/
ATP) Ratio
An ADP/ATP Ratio Assay Kit (BioVision) was used to
measure the ADP and ATP concentrations, in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Data Analysis
Human data.
We used all data obtained and conducted
two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and covariance
(ANCOVA) for pH, factoring in diagnosis and data set using
SAS Studio software version 3.5 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test
after ANOVA or ANCOVA was also employed to assess the
significance of differences between the mean values of
diagnostic groups.
Because of differences in methods used to calculate
equivalent doses among the four data sets (fluphenazine vs
chlorpromazine equivalent), we calculated Z-scores for
lifetime antipsychotic use. Z-score transformation—a tradi-
tional method of data normalization for direct comparison
between different samples and conditions—was applied for
each antipsychotic equivalent value and pH value using
individual participant data within each of four data sets,
according to the following formula:
Z‑score ¼ valueP– mean valueP1yPn
ð
Þ=standard deviationP1yPn;
where P is any pH and P1…Pn represent the aggregate
measure of all antipsychotic equivalent or pH values.
Mouse data.
Student’s t-test was employed to assess the
significance of differences between the mean values of
controls and mutants in combination with the Bonferroni–
Holm correction for repeated measurements. Z-scores for
pH and lactate levels were calculated within strains as
described above.
Transcriptome Analysis and Bioinformatics Analysis
We used the following mouse brain transcriptome data:
frontal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of Shn2
KO mice (microarray) (Takao et al, 2013), hippocampal DG
of Camk2a HKO mice (microarray) (Hagihara et al, 2009),
and whole brains of Chd8 HKO mice (RNA-sequencing)
(Katayama et al, 2016). Gene expression patterns in the
frontal cortex of Camk2a HKO mice (n = 6, 6) and
hippocampal DG of Cn KO mice (n = 6, 6) were analyzed
via microarray (Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array; Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA), as previously described (Takao et al, 2013).
Gene expression patterns in the frontal cortex and hippo-
campal DG of Nrgn KO mice (n = 5, 5) were analyzed via
RNA-sequencing using the HiSeq platform in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego,
CA). A total of eight transcriptome data sets were used in the
present study. Genes with an absolute fold change 41.2 and
a t-test P-value o0.05 (mutants vs controls; without
correction for multiple testing) were imported into the
bioinformatics tool BaseSpace (Illumina), with which the
gene expression data obtained from different platforms were
matched (Hagihara et al, 2014). Genes meeting the above
criteria are included in Supplementary Table S3. Genes with
altered expression in at least four of the eight data sets
(yielding 80 features; Supplementary Table S3) were selected
based on the criteria of the BaseSpace tool and assessed for
enrichment in biological themes using the DAVID functional
annotation clustering tool, ADGO, and GOToolBox, in
which the default feature listings and algorithm settings
were used.
RESULTS
Lower pH in the Postmortem Brains of Patients with
Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder
We first performed a meta-analysis of postmortem studies
regarding brain pH in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder that consisted of nine schizophrenia data sets and
five bipolar disorder data sets (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table S1). A two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects
of diagnosis (F2, 694=22.01, P=5.32×10 − 10) and data set
(F9, 694=17.93, Po2.00×10 − 16), although no interaction was
observed between the two factors (F12, 694=1.70, P=0.063;
Figure 1). The post hoc comparisons with Tukey’s HSD test
indicated
that

 exhibited lower brain pH than healthy control. However, no
significant difference in brain pH was observed between
patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (adjusted
P=0.88). Similar results were obtained with Z-score-trans-
formed data: pH was significantly lower in patients with
schizophrenia (adjusted Po1.0×10 − 7) and bipolar disorder
(adjusted P=1.59 ×10 −5) than in healthy controls, and no
significant difference was observed between patients with
schizophrenia
and
bipolar
disorder
(adjusted
P=0.85)
(Supplementary Figure S1).
We observed no significant interactions between diagnosis
and postmortem interval/age in either schizophrenia (post-
mortem interval: F1, 485 = 2.56, P = 0.11; age: F1, 485 = 0.93,
P = 0.34) or bipolar disorder data sets (postmortem interval:
F1, 295 = 0.63, P = 0.43; age: F1, 295 = 1.07, P = 0.30). Hence, we
performed correlation analyses between pH and such
variables using the combined data of patients and controls
to test their effects on pH. In schizophrenia data sets,
significant correlations were observed between pH values
and age (r = − 0.17, P = 0.00013), but not between pH and
postmortem interval (r = 0.064, P = 0.14). In bipolar disorder
data sets, no significant correlations were observed between
pH and postmortem interval (r = 0.072, P = 0.20), or between
pH and age (r = 0.032, P = 0.57) (Supplementary Figure S2).
Therefore, we performed an ANCOVA (factors: diagnosis
and data set) on schizophrenia samples with age as a
covariate that revealed a significant main effect of diagnosis
(F1, 485 = 6.16, P = 0.013). However, no significant interaction
effects
were
observed
for
these
factors
(F8, 485 = 0.35,
P = 0.95). In bipolar disorder data sets, as no significant
correlations were observed between pH and potential
confounding factors, we performed an ANOVA to examine
the effect of diagnosis on pH. Our analysis revealed a
significant
main
effect
of
diagnosis
(F1, 305 = 9.11,
P = 0.0028), although no significant interaction effects were
observed (F4, 305 = 0.68, P = 0.60). The post hoc analyses
revealed that pH was lower in the brains of patients with
schizophrenia (Po0.0001) and bipolar disorder (P = 0.0028)
than in those of healthy controls. Furthermore, Z-score-
based meta-analysis of six data sets revealed no significant
correlation between pH and lifetime use of antipsychotics
(r = − 0.13, P = 0.094; Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting
that antipsychotic treatment is not a major contributing
factor affecting pH in the postmortem brains of patients with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Collectively, the results
of our meta-analysis support the notion that lower brain pH
is a pathological feature of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder rather than an artifact.
Lower pH and Increased Lactate Levels in the
Postmortem Brain of Mouse Models of Schizophrenia,
Bipolar Disorder, and ASD
The potential confounding factors identified in previous
studies (Halim et al, 2008; Tomita et al, 2004) are beyond the
investigator’s control in postmortem studies of the human
brain. We therefore measured pH and lactate levels in the
brains of mouse models of schizophrenia (Shn2 KO, Cn KO,
Nrgn KO mice), bipolar disorder (Camk2a HKO mice), and
ASD (Chd8 HKO mice). All mice used were drug naive and
killed via cervical dislocation, following which the removed
brains were snap-frozen within a few minutes, allowing us to
control for differences in agonal state and postmortem
interval differences. Brain pH was significantly lower in all
five mutant strains than in the corresponding controls (Shn2
KO, 7.17 ± 0.0060, Con, 7.20 ± 0.0056, P = 0.017; Cn KO,
7.08 ± 0.0057, Con, 7.13 ± 0.0080, P = 0.0055; Nrgn KO,
7.10 ± 0.017, Con, 7.16 ± 0.0080, P = 0.017; Camk2a HKO,
7.14 ± 0.0093, Con, 7.21 ± 0.0090, P = 0.0055; Chd8 HKO,
7.08 ± 0.0066, Con, 7.12 ± 0.0031, P = 0.0040; Figure 2a).
Significantly higher levels of lactate were observed in the
postmortem brains of all mutant mouse strains than in the
corresponding controls (Shn2 KO, 2.98 ± 0.080 mM, Con,
2.55 ± 0.076 mM, P = 0.015; Cn KO, 3.24 ± 0.051 mM, Con,
2.90 ± 0.073 mM, P = 0.015; Nrgn KO, 2.98 ± 0.11 mM, Con,
2.58 ± 0.054 mM, P = 0.015; Camk2a HKO, 2.86 ± 0.024 mM,
Con, 2.58±0.037 mM, P=0.0012; Chd8 HKO, 3.04±0.081 mM,
Con, 2.58 ± 0.086 mM, P = 0.015; Figure 2b). Z-score-based
analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between
pH and lactate levels (Pearson’s r = − 0.65, P = 1.19 × 10 − 7;
Figure 2c). In addition, lactate levels exhibited a significant
negative correlation with age in the control group, but not in
the mutant group (Supplementary Figure S4). However,
there were no significant differences in age between controls
and mutants of each strain (see the Materials and Methods).
No significant correlations between age and pH were observed
in either the mutant or control groups (Supplementary
Figure S4).
Disc1-L100P mutant, Disc1-Q31L mutant, and Barp KO
mice do not exhibit behavioral phenotypes associated with
psychiatric disorders (Nakao et al, 2015; Shoji et al, 2012)
(Supplementary Table S2). Unlike other model mice, mice of
these three lines exhibited no changes in brain pH or lactate
levels relative to those observed in the corresponding

 controls (Supplementary Figure S5). These results suggest
that genetic alterations in general do not necessarily cause
changes in pH and lactate levels in the mouse brain.
Lactate is formed from pyruvate during glycolysis. We
therefore measured pyruvate levels in model mouse brains,
observing that levels were significantly increased in Shn2 KO
(P = 0.042), Nrgn KO (P = 0.042), and Chd8 HKO mice
(P = 0.042). Cn KO (P = 0.092) and Camk2a HKO mice
(P = 0.092) exhibited a trend toward increased pyruvate
levels, although this trend did not survive Bonferroni–Holm
correction (Figure 2d). Glucose levels remained unchanged
in mutant mice relative to controls (Figure 2e), suggesting
that glucose supply/demand ratio in the brain may be
comparable
in
these
mouse
models.
In
addition,
no
significant differences in ADP/ATP ratio were observed in
these model mice following Bonferroni–Holm correction
(Figure 2f), suggesting no alteration of energy consumption
ratio in the brains of model mice.
We then analyzed transcriptome data (Supplementary
Table S3) in order to investigate the potential underlying
molecular mechanisms of increased lactate levels in mutant
mouse brains. Transcriptome data from five mouse strains
revealed an enrichment in Wnt- and epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-related pathways when analyzed using DAVID soft-
ware (Supplementary Table S4). Enrichment in Wnt-related
pathways was replicated in analyses performed using other
bioinformatics tools (ADGO and GOToolBox) using differ-
ent statistical methods (Supplementary Table S4).
As lactate is produced via glycolytic pathways in astrocytes
in the brain (Demetrius and Simon, 2012), we analyzed the
transcriptome data of model mice with particular focus on
glycolysis-related genes (Gene Ontology Consortium data-
base) as well as those related to pyruvate metabolism. The
results of the targeted gene expression analyses suggest that
elevated glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism shifting toward
lactate synthesis occur in the brains of model mice, especially
in Shn2 KO and Camk2a HKO mice (Supplementary Table
S5 and Supplementary Figure S6).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, our meta-analysis confirmed that the
brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
exhibit lower pH than healthy controls upon postmortem
examination. Lower pH was also observed in five different
mouse models of psychiatric disorders, all of which were
drug naive and controlled for other potential confounding
factors, such as agonal state and postmortem interval. We
also observed increased lactate levels in the brains of model
mice, as well as a highly significant negative correlation
between pH and lactate levels, consistent with the findings of
previous human postmortem studies (Halim et al, 2008).
These results suggest that lower pH and increased lactate
levels are implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of
the diseases rather than mere artifacts.
Our meta-analyses indicated that brain pH is decreased in
patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder when
postmortem interval, age, and antipsychotic use are regarded
as potential covariates of brain pH. There are, however, still
limitations regarding the covariates in the present study. One
major limitation involves the lack of data regarding agonal
state, as previous studies have reported that individuals who
experience prolonged agonal states exhibit lower brain pH
(Mexal et al, 2006; Tomita et al, 2004). These findings
suggest that agonal state may be a potential confounding
factor for postmortem brain pH. As such, studies using

 animal models are necessary to validate the findings from
human postmortem studies. However, as we cannot rule out
the possibility that agonal states were altered in our model
mice, further studies should examine pH and lactate levels in
the brains of animals with short, moderate, and prolonged
agonal states.
In addition to these limitations, other secondary factors
cannot be ruled out in animal studies. For example, a recent
study using Tbx1 mutant mice (ASD model mice) revealed
that a genetic risk factor can influence maternal care via the
phenotype of the risk carrier (Takahashi et al, 2016). Such
secondary environmental factors during childhood may thus
affect brain pH in mice. Increased locomotor activity may
alter oxygen levels in the brains, particularly in Shn2 KO, Cn
KO, Nrgn KO, and Camk2a HKO mice (Supplementary
Table S2). Considering that blood oxygen levels are positively
correlated with brain lactate levels (Bednařík et al, 2015),
oxygen levels may also represent a potential confounding
factor in the measurement of brain lactate levels. Moreover,
the balance between blood and brain cells may differ between
the brain homogenates of control and mutant mice. As
lactate concentrations in the blood are two- to three-fold
higher
than
those
in
the
mouse
brain
(extracellular
compartment) (Béland-Millar et al, 2017), such differences
may represent an additional confounding factor. Although
differences in genetic background are also of concern when
making
comparisons
between
different
mouse
strains
(Wolfer et al, 2002), we utilized over nine backcrossings in
addition to littermates within each strain. Thus, it is unlikely
that differences in pH and lactate levels between control and
mutant mice within each strain reflect differences in genetic
background.
We observed no significant differences in pH and lactate
levels in the brain of two lines of Disc1 mutant mice as
compared with corresponding controls. DISC1 has been
implicated in the genetic etiology of schizophrenia (Brandon
and Sawa, 2011; Ishizuka et al, 2006). However, a recent
large-scale
analysis
of
copy
number
variants
(CNVs)
suggested that DISC1 may not be a risk factor for the
disorder (Marshall et al, 2016); the analysis showed that there
are 5 deletions and 1 duplication in 21 094 schizophrenia
cases and 4 deletions and 2 duplications in 20 227 controls
(data deposited at UCSC Genome Browser on Human Mar.
2006, NCBI36/hg18). These results, combined with our
previous observations that Disc1 mutant mice used in the
present
study
did
not
exhibit
behavioral
phenotypes
associated with schizophrenia (Shoji et al, 2012), suggest
that these mutant mice may not represent a valid animal
model of the disorder.
Increased lactate levels have been observed within certain
brain regions in patients with schizophrenia (Halim et al,
2008; Prabakaran et al, 2004), bipolar disorder (Dager et al,
2004; Lan et al, 2008), and ASD (Goh et al, 2014) in both
postmortem and in vivo spectroscopic imaging studies. More
recent studies have confirmed increased lactate levels in the
brains
of
patients
with
schizophrenia
by
postmortem
analysis (Dean et al, 2016) and in vivo analysis using 7-
Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (Rowland
et al, 2016). Additional studies have revealed that pyruvate
levels are increased whereas glucose levels remain unchanged
in the postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia
(Dean et al, 2016). Our findings in mouse models are
substantially consistent with the evidence obtained from
previous human studies.
In our animal experiments, control baselines of pH and
lactate levels varied among strains (Figures 2a and b). Such
variations may have been due to differences in age, as we
observed a significant negative correlation between lactate
levels and age in control mice; lactate levels increased as
mouse age decreased (Supplementary Figure S4). These
findings align with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of
schizophrenia. Accumulating evidence suggests that matura-
tion abnormalities in certain types of brain cells, in which the
molecular and physiological properties are similar to those of
normal immature cells, represent an endophenotype com-
monly
observed
in
several
neuropsychiatric
disorders,
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy
(Hagihara et al, 2013; Shin et al, 2013; Walton et al, 2012).
For example, our previous study demonstrated that gene
expression patterns in the prefrontal cortex of patients with
schizophrenia are strikingly similar to those of typically
developing infants (Hagihara et al, 2014). Considering the
negative correlation between age and lactate levels in control
mice of the present study, higher lactate levels in mutant
mice may reflect one aspect of maturational abnormalities of
the brain. However, additional studies involving detailed
time-course analyses of developmental changes in pH and
lactate levels are required to verify this hypothesis.
Previous studies have also revealed that brain acidosis
influences a number of brain functions, such as anxiety,
mood, and cognition (Wemmie, 2011). Acidosis may affect
the structure and function of several types of brain cells,
including the electrophysiological functioning of GABAergic
neurons (Huang et al, 2015) and morphological properties of
oligodendrocytes (Goldman et al, 1989). Alterations in these
types of cells have been well documented in the brains of
patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ASD
(Bartzokis, 2005; Nakazawa et al, 2012) and may underlie
some of the cognitive deficits associated with these disorders.
Deficits in GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes have
also been identified in mouse models of the disorders,
including Shn2 KO mice (Takao et al, 2013). Brain acidosis
may therefore be associated with deficits in such cell types in
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ASD. However, as each
genetic
alteration
may
dysregulate
the
neurochemical
balances of downstream molecules that are not functionally
relevant to psychiatric disorders, further studies are required
to determine whether low pH and increased lactate levels are
functionally significant in psychiatric disorders.
A previous study indicated that chronic treatment with
antipsychotics increases lactate levels in the rat cerebral
cortex (Halim et al, 2008), suggesting that such increases
may be medication related. The authors of the report,
however, found no significant correlation between lactate
levels and history of antipsychotic use in the post-mortem
brains of patients with schizophrenia. In addition, increased
lactate levels have been observed in the anterior cingulate of
medication-free patients with bipolar disorder in in vivo
spectroscopic imaging studies (Dager et al, 2004). Further-
more, studies utilizing animal models of psychiatric dis-
orders have identified increased lactate levels in mutant
mouse brains in vivo (das Neves Duarte et al, 2012). In
addition, we observed an association between increased
lactate levels and decreased pH in the brains of model mice
Decreased brain pH in psychiatric disorders
H Hagihara et al

Neuropsychopharmacology
 in the present study, consistent with findings from previous
studies on patients with schizophrenia (Halim et al, 2008;
Prabakaran et al, 2004). Decreased brain pH has also been
observed in medication-free patients with bipolar disorder
(Kato et al, 1998). Although it is possible that antipsychotic
treatment increases lactate levels and lowers pH in the brain,
the aforementioned findings suggest that such changes may
occur as primary features of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder.
It should be noted that haploinsufficiency of Chd8, a gene
associated with ASD, results in lower brain pH and increased
lactate levels in mice, as well as molecular and behavioral
phenotypes relevant to ASD (Katayama et al, 2016). Previous
studies have reported that patients with ASD exhibit
decreased pH (Young et al, 2011) and increased lactate
levels (Goh et al, 2014) relative to healthy controls,
suggesting that our findings in model mice are consistent
with those observed in patients with ASD. In addition, CHD8
has also been implicated in schizophrenia (Kimura et al,
2016; McCarthy et al, 2014). Therefore, lower pH and
increased lactate levels in Chd8 HKO mice may reflect an
aspect of brain pathophysiology in ASD/schizophrenia.
Interestingly, we observed that Wnt- and EGF-related
pathways, which are highly implicated in somatic and brain
cancers (Nicholas et al, 2006), are enriched in the genes
whose expressions were altered among the five mutant
mouse strains. It is well known that cancer cells display high
rates of glycolysis, resulting in high lactate and pyruvate
levels, even in normoxia (Lu et al, 2002). This phenomenon
has been referred to as the Warburg effect. Genes whose
expression is known to positively regulate the Warburg
effect, such as Hk2 (Mathupala et al, 2009), Hif1a (Lu et al,
2002), and Pfkfb3 (Minchenko et al, 2002), were increased in
the brains of some of mouse models examined in the present
study, whereas expression of Prkaa1—a negative regulator of
the Warburg effect (Faubert et al, 2013)—was decreased
(Supplementary Table S3). These findings suggest that
elevated glycolysis underlies increases in lactate and pyruvate
levels in the brains of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and
ASD model mice. The results of the targeted gene expression
analyses conducted in the present study also support this
hypothesis. Glycolysis is also stimulated by the uptake of
glutamate
in
astrocytes
following
neuronal
excitation
(Pellerin
and
Magistretti,
1994).
Dysregulation
of
the
excitation–inhibition
balance
has
been
proposed
as
a
candidate cause of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and
ASD (Brealy et al, 2015; Marín, 2012). A shift in the balance
toward excitation would result in increased energy expendi-
ture and may lead to increased glycolysis. Indeed, Shn2 KO
mice exhibit higher glutamate levels in the hippocampus
(Takao et al, 2013). In vivo metabolite measurements have
suggested that increased glycolysis also occurs in the brains
of patients with schizophrenia (Rowland et al, 2016) and
bipolar disorder (Dager et al, 2004; Stork and Renshaw,
2005), whereas gene ontology analysis of microarray data has
suggested that decreased glycolysis occurs in the brains of
patients
with
schizophrenia
(Prabakaran
et
al,
2004).
Although further studies are required to determine whether
alterations in the rate of glycolysis are associated with
increased lactate levels and decreased pH, we hypothesize
that decreased pH in whole-brain samples was due to
increased lactate production driven by hyperactivity within
specific neural circuits (Hagihara et al, 2013; Heckers
and Konradi, 2015; Lisman et al, 2008). Therefore, it
would be of interest to investigate pH and lactate levels, as
well as glycolysis rate, in the brains of mouse models of other
mental disorders in which such hyperactivity has been
implicated, such as epilepsy (Seifert and Steinhäuser, 2013),
depression (Grace, 2016), and Alzheimer’s disease (Busche
et al, 2012).
Previous studies have indicated that lactate levels in the
mouse brain rapidly increase after at least 1 min of
decapitation, relative to those observed following in vivo
fixation via focused microwave irradiation, regarded as a
consequence of enhanced glycolysis under oxygen-deprived
conditions (Sugiura et al, 2014). Although the current
findings may differ from those obtained under physiological
conditions, they may also reflect functional changes (eg,
astrocyte activation) (Huang and Huang, 2012; Takao et al,
2013) that represent the main source of lactate production in
the brain.
Brain pH is associated with notable changes in gene
expression (Catts et al, 2005; Iwamoto et al, 2005; Mexal
et al, 2006; Tomita et al, 2004) and has hence been
considered as a confound for investigating changes in gene
expression related to the pathophysiology of psychiatric
disorders. Therefore, substantial effort has been made to
match tissue pH between patients and controls. Given that
lower brain pH is a pathophysiological component of certain
conditions, pH-dependent changes in gene expression are of
concern when attempting to elucidate the molecular basis of
the conditions. Some studies have indicated that gene
expression patterns are partially similar across diseases such
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ASD (Ellis et al, 2016;
Shao and Vawter, 2008). Decreased pH may underlie these
similarities in the pattern of gene expression. Thus, pH may
be an important factor in the elucidation of molecular
alternations in the brains of patients with these psychiatric
conditions.
