Abstract
Immunotherapy holds tremendous promise for improving cancer treatment1. Administering 
radiotherapy with immunotherapy has been shown to improve immune responses and can elicit an 
“abscopal effect”2. Unfortunately, response rates for this strategy remain low3. Herein, we report 
an improved cancer immunotherapy approach that utilizes antigen-capturing nanoparticles (AC-
NPs). We engineered several AC-NPs formulations and demonstrated that the set of protein 
antigens captured by each AC-NP formulation is dependent upon NP surface properties. We 
showed that AC-NPs deliver tumor specific proteins to antigen-presenting cells and significantly 
improve the efficacy of αPD-1 treatment using the B16F10 melanoma model, generating up to 
20% cure rate as compared to 0% without AC-NPs. Mechanistic studies revealed that AC-NPs 
induced an expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and increased both CD4+/Treg and CD8+/Treg 
ratios. Our work presents a novel strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy with 
nanotechnology.
Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful new strategy in cancer treatment4. 
Antibodies that block negative immune regulatory pathways (checkpoint inhibitors)5, 
including CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4) and PD-1 (programmed 
cell death 1) receptors, improve survival in patients with advanced disease such as 
melanoma, bladder, squamous cell head and neck and non-small-cell lung cancer6–11. A key 
clinical approach to improving cancer immunotherapy has been to combine radiotherapy 
with checkpoint inhibitors to induce the abscopal effect, a phenomenon where local tumor 
treatment produces systemic regression of metastatic lesions12. The abscopal effect is 
facilitated by the immune system and has been found anecdotally to mediate long-term, 
durable clinical responses. The synergistic interaction between radiotherapy and 
immunotherapy is thought to be due to immune stimulation by radiation-induced pro-
inflammatory protein production and increased exposure of immune cells to cancer specific 
antigens that are released following radiotherapy-induced cancer cell death13–16. We 
hypothesized that NPs could be used to improve treatment response to immunotherapy and 
to induce the abscopal effect by capturing tumor-derived protein antigens (TDPA) released 
during radiotherapy and transporting them to antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby 
promoting cancer immunity (Figure 1)17–22.
As proof of concept, herein we report on the development and use of several antigen-
capturing nanoparticles (AC-NP) formulations to improve cancer immunotherapy. NPs were 
formulated using poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a biocompatible and biodegradable 
polymer. The NPs’ surfaces were modified to enable binding of TDPAs by a variety of 
mechanisms. Unmodified PLGA AC-NPs bind to proteins through non-covalent 
hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. AC-NPs coated with amine- polyethylene glycol

 (NH2-PEG) (NH2 AC-NP) and 1,2-Dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane (DOTAP 
AC-NP) both bind to proteins via ionic interactions. AC-NPs coated with maleimide-PEG 
(Mal AC-NP) bind to proteins by forming stable thioether bonds. As a negative control, we 
also formulated AC-NPs with methoxy-PEG (mPEG), which should have minimal 
interactions with proteins23.
We first sought to determine whether the surface chemistry of AC-NPs impacted TDPA 
capture. AC-NPs were incubated with lethally irradiated B16F10 melanoma cell lysates ex 
vivo. Both the size and zeta potential of AC-NPs changed following incubation 
(Supplementary Figure 1a, b), indicating successful TDPA capture by AC-NPs. Successful 
TDPA capture was confirmed by quantifying the total amount of protein bound by each AC-
NP formulation. mPEG AC-NPs captured very little protein, a finding consistent with its 
anti-biofouling surface. All other AC-NP formulations captured relatively high amounts of 
protein (Supplementary Figure 1c). AC-NP bound proteins were then isolated and identified 
using mass spectrometry. We found that the diversity and composition of proteins captured 
by AC-NPs is dependent upon their surface chemistries. The PLGA and DOTAP AC-NP 
formulations captured the most comprehensive set of proteins (Figure 2a). Additionally, 
while some proteins were captured by multiple AC-NP formulations, some were discretely 
captured by only one AC-NP formulation (Figure 2b).
To determine whether AC-NPs captured tumor-specific antigens, we performed an in silico 
analysis on our mass spectrometry data to determine if any of the captured proteins contain 
neoantigens expressed by B16F10 cells24,25. Neoantigens are tumor specific antigens 
created by somatic mutations 26. We found that all AC-NP formulations, with the exception 
of mPEG AC-NPs, successfully captured neoantigens24 (Figure 2c, Supplementary Table 1). 
Notably, AC-NPs also captured a number of damage associated molecular pattern proteins 
(DAMPs), a broad class of pro-inflammatory molecules that have been shown to potentiate 
immune response27. Notably, we found that our AC-NPs were capable of capturing histone 
proteins and alarmins (including HMGB1), both of which have been shown to enhance anti-
tumor immune responses (Supplementary Table 1)27. Our data confirm that AC-NPs capture 
a myriad of TDPAs that are released after radiotherapy.
To investigate whether AC-NPs can improve immunotherapy, we employed a syngeneic 
mouse model of melanoma. Mice bearing bilateral B16F10 melanoma flank tumors 
underwent αPD-1 treatment. One of the tumors was irradiated (primary) and then injected 
with either PBS or AC-NPs, while the other tumor was shielded from radiation (secondary) 
(Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 2a). We assessed the immunotherapeutic efficacy and 
induction of the abscopal effect of different treatment regimens by measuring the growth 
rate of secondary tumors over time. We found that PLGA and Mal AC-NPs were able to 
significantly improve immunotherapy and the abscopal effect, eliciting the most robust 
therapeutic response across all treatment groups (Figure 3a, b). The greater therapeutic 
efficacy also translated into improved survival (Figure 3c). Impressively, the RT
+αPD-1+PLGA AC-NP treatment strategy yielded a complete response rate (CRR) of 20%. 
These animals successfully rejected tumor re-challenge (subcutaneous injection of 100,000 
B16F10 cells) 3 months later, demonstrating that this treatment strategy is capable of 
inducing durable anti-tumor immunity (Supplementary Figure 3). Of note, combining PLGA

 and Mal AC-NPs into the same treatment regimen did not further enhance immunotherapy, 
suggesting that TDPAs commonly captured by these formulations may be responsible for the 
observed therapeutic benefit (Supplementary Figure 4). Moreover, PLGA and Mal AC-NP 
facilitated immunotherapeutic enhancement is lost following CD8+ T cell depletion 
(Supplementary Figure 5). Importantly, we also found that AC-NPs improve immunotherapy 
in an orthotopic breast cancer tumor model (Supplementary Figure 6). Taken together, these 
data indicate that AC-NPs can indeed improve immunotherapy and promote the abscopal 
effect.
We next sought to determine the mechanism by which AC-NPs enhance the efficacy of 
cancer immunotherapy. As illustrated in Figure 1, successful immunotherapeutic tumor 
response requires the uptake and presentation of cancer antigens by APCs and the elicitation 
of an anti-cancer immune response. To confirm that AC-NPs are capable of delivering 
TDPAs to APCs, we injected rhodamine-labeled AC-NPs intratumorally and studied 
lymphatic drainage and distribution among lymph node residing dendritic cells, 
macrophages, and B-cells following radiotherapy. We found that AC-NPs injected into 
irradiated tumors readily trafficked to nearby tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) 16 
hours post administration (Figure 4a, b). Importantly, PLGA and Mal AC-NPs accumulate at 
higher rates in professional antigen presenting dendritic cells (CD11c+), macrophages 
(F4/80+) and B-cells (B220+) when compared to mPEG AC-NPs. Note that radiotherapy 
greatly enhances AC-NP uptake by APCs in resident lymph nodes (Supplementary Figure 
7). This observation, taken together with the low accumulation of mPEG AC-NPs in APCs 
following radiotherapy, suggests that cellular uptake of AC-NPs requires capture of TDPAs 
released by radiotherapy.
To further characterize the method in which AC-NPs accumulate in lymph node residing 
APCs, we sought to assess whether AC-NPs were being actively transported by APCs from 
irradiated tumors to TDLNs or whether AC-NPs drain freely to lymph nodes prior to being 
taken up by APCs28. Our data demonstrate that the degree to which different AC-NP 
formulations utilize active versus passive transport varies based not only on AC-NP 
formulation, but also APC type (Supplementary Figure 8). For example, Mal AC-NPs are 
robustly taken up by dendritic cells in the irradiated tumor at 1 hour after irradiation and 
then demonstrate a concurrent decreased accumulation in dendritic cells within irradiated 
tumors and increased accumulation in dendritic cells within the TDLNs at 16 hours post-
radiotherapy, suggesting successful dendritic cell mediated transport for this AC-NP 
formulation.
APCs play a pivotal role in initiating a successful adaptive immune response by processing 
foreign antigens and presenting peptide fragments to naïve T cells. Following antigen 
presentation, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells become activated, experience clonal expansion, 
and gain helper functions (e.g. cytokine secretion) or cytotoxic capabilities. To determine 
whether the accumulation of AC-NPs carrying TDPAs would translate to successful T cell 
activation and expansion, the relative abundance of tumor infiltrating T cells was assessed in 
untreated secondary tumors of animals 16 days following radiotherapy. We found that 
animals treated with PLGA and Mal AC-NPs have more infiltrating CD8+ T cells when 
compared to mice that did not receive AC-NP treatment (Figure 4c; Supplementary Figure 
Min et al.

 9). Additionally, the relative abundance of CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), an 
immune suppressive T cell population that dampens antitumor immune responses, was 
substantially decreased in mice that received AC-NP treatment when compared to mice that 
did not receive AC-NPs. (Figure 4c; Supplementary Figure 9). Overall, the addition of AC-
NPs to immunotherapy significantly increased intratumoral CD8+ T/Treg and CD4+ T/Treg 
ratios (Figure 4c), implying increased anti-tumor immunotherapeutic activity within the 
secondary tumor microenvironments of these animals. Although not significant, a similar 
trend was observed in the irradiated primary tumors of animals undergoing different 
treatment regimens. (Supplementary Figure 10). To further address whether AC-NPs are 
capable of eliciting systemic T cell activation, we assessed the ex vivo production of 
antitumor cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ)29 by splenocytes harvested from mice that received 
different treatment regimens. We found that splenocytes isolated from animals in the PLGA 
and Mal AC-NP treatment arms demonstrated the highest percentage of IFN-γ secreting 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when stimulated with TDPAs (Figure 4d; Supplementary Figure 
11). Importantly, negligible IFN-γ production was observed when T cell populations 
isolated from PLGA and Mal AC-NP treatment arms were stimulated with splenocyte 
lysates, indicating that the addition of these AC-NP formulations to standard immunotherapy 
promotes the production of a cancer specific immune response (Figure 4d; Supplementary 
Figure 12). To determine if AC-NP improve immunotherapy in an antigen-specific manner, 
we stimulated T cells isolated from animals undergoing different treatment regimens with 
neoantigen peptide fragments24 identified in our mass spectrometry analysis (Actn4, Tubb3, 
Dag1, and Eef2). We found using flow cytometric analysis that T cells from PLGA and Mal 
AC-NP treatment arms demonstrate more robust IFN-γ production following neoantigen 
stimulation. (Supplementary Figure 12). To further assess neoantigen stimulation, we also 
performed an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) assay using splenocytes isolated 
from all treatment arms. We found that PLGA and Mal AC-NP treatment arms trended 
towards having the most robust T cell activation following exposure to Actn4 and Tubb3 
(Supplementary Figure 13). Collectively, our results demonstrate that AC-NPs used in 
combination with radiotherapy and immunotherapy increased anti-cancer CD8+ and CD4+ 
effector neoantigen-specific T cell quantity and quality.
Finally, to confirm that the improved immunotherapeutic response and abscopal effect are 
attributable to AC-NP administration, we examined the effect of direct administration of 
AC-NPs coated with TDPA ex vivo to tumor bearing mice receiving αPD-1 immunotherapy 
treatment (Supplementary Figure 2b). Despite lower accumulation in lymph node residing 
APCs (Supplementary Figure 14), we found that administration of both Mal AC-NPs and 
PLGA AC-NPs coated with TDPAs ex vivo significantly delayed tumor growth (Figure 5a, 
b) and increased survival time (Figure 5c). As with the therapeutic enhancement observed in 
our in vivo abscopal studies, PLGA and Mal AC-NP facilitated immunotherapeutic 
enhancement of cancer vaccination is lost following CD8+ T cell depletion (Supplementary 
Figure 15).
In summary, we have developed biodegradable and biocompatible AC-NPs that can improve 
cancer immunotherapy and induce the abscopal effect. We show that AC-NPs enhance the 
presentation of TDPAs by APCs, resulting in a more robust activation of CD8+ T cells. A 
continuing challenge that limits the effectiveness of cancer therapy is tumor heterogeneity

 within individual patients and among patient populations. Traditional strategies of enhancing 
the immunotherapeutic response by administering one or several “chosen” antigens remain 
unsuccessful30, perhaps because this approach fails to account for tumor cell diversity. In 
contrast to traditional methods, our novel strategy exposes the immune system to a wide 
variety of TDPAs in a patient specific manner. This treatment approach carries important 
implications for the advancement of personalized medicine. Importantly, our AC-NP based 
approach is synergistic with existing clinical immunotherapy treatment regimens, and our 
AC-NPs formulations contain FDA generally regarded as safe (GRAS) materials, allowing 
for rapid clinical translation. Our work can potentially facilitate precision medicine with 
personalized immunotherapy and improve the outcomes of patients suffering from extensive 
metastatic disease.

Preparation of Antigen Capturing Nanoparticles (AC-NPs)
The NPs were synthesized using a previously reported nanoprecipitation technique31. 
Briefly, to prepare the PLGA NPs, PLGA (4 mg/mL) in acetonitrile (ACN) was added 
dropwise into 3 mL of endotoxin free water and stirred at room temperature under a vacuum

 until the ACN completely evaporated (approximately 3 hours). To prepare the DOTAP core-
shell NPs32, PLGA (4 mg/mL) in ACN was added dropwise into 3 mL of 4% ethanol 
solution containing lecithin/DOTAP (7:3 molar ratio) with a weight ratio of 15% to the 
PLGA polymer solution pre-heated to 55.0 °C. This solution was vortexed for 3 min and 
stirred at room temperature under a vacuum until the ACN completely evaporated. To 
prepare the X AC-NPs (X= mPEG, NH2 or Mal (Maleimide)), PLGA-PEG-X (20 mg/mL) 
in ACN was added dropwise into 3 mL of endotoxin free water and stirred at room 
temperature under vacuum until the ACN completely evaporated. The resulted NPs were 
used either for intratumoral injection in abscopal experiment or for preparing TDPAs coated 
AC-NPs ex vivo in the next step.
In Vitro Formulation of Antigen Capturing Nanoparticles (AC-NPs) coated with TDPAs
Preparing Tumor Antigens from Irradiated B16-F10 Cells—B16-F10 cells were 
seeded in T175 flask containing 25 mL of culture media and incubated overnight at 37°C. 
Cells were then washed with PBS or plain medium and irradiated with 100 Gy photon 
radiation delivered using a Precision X-RAD 320 (Precision X-ray, Inc.) machine operating 
at 320 kvp and 12.5 mA. Subsequently, the B16-F10 cells were incubated in media without 
FBS for 48 hours. Following incubation, the supernatant was collected and spun down at 200 
g for 5 min to remove insoluble cellular debris.
Preparation of AC-NP coated with TDPAs Ex Vivo—AC-NPs were incubated with 
antigen containing supernatants prepared from irradiated B16-F10 cells as described above. 
Specifically, 20 mg of each AC-NP formulation was mixed with the 20 mL of tumor 
antigens from 10 million irradiated B16-F10 cells. Following incubation, AC-NPs were 
washed with endotoxin free H2O or PBS using ultra-filtration (500–800g, Amicon Ultra, 
Ultracel membrane with 100, 000 NMWL, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Pre-loaded AC-NPs 
prepared using this method were either characterized or used for cancer immunotherapy 
assays in vivo.
Vials and stir bars for NPs preparation were autoclaved and washed with acetone and ACN 
before use. All NPs were made under endotoxin-free condition.
Characterization of AC-NPs Before and After Ex Vivo Antigen Capture—
Changes in AC-NP size after antigen capture was determined using intensity-average 
diameter (Dh, also known as hydrodynamic diameter) of NPs. Changes in the mean zeta 
potential (mean ζ) of AC-NPs following antigen capture was analyzed by dynamic light 
scattering and aqueous electrophoresis using a Zetasizer Nano ZS Instrument (Malvern, 
Inc.). Prior to the measurements, NPs were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL with DI H2O. The amount 
of protein bound by AC-NPs was determined using BCA analysis. Specifically AC-NPs 
were incubated in a supernatant containing TDPAs and subsequently removed. The total 
protein uptake by AC-NPs was determined by subtracting the protein concentration in the 
supernatant after AC-NP capture from the protein concentration in the supernatant before 
capture. All measurements were based on the average of three separate measurements 
(Supplementary Fig. 1).

 Identification of Proteins Captured by each AC-NP formulation by LC/MS/MS 
Analysis—Following preparation, pre-loaded AC-NPs were first washed with Centrifugal 
Device (300,000 NMWL, Nanosep) and the solutions were then diluted 5-fold with ACN. 
ACN was then evaporated under vacuum and the remaining solution was centrifuged at 200 
g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and processed for mass spectrum analysis using a 
previously established FASP (Filter assisted sample preparation) protocol33, a process that 
includes reduction, alkylation, and digested with trypsin. The peptides were then extracted, 
lyophilized, and resuspended in 2% acetonitrile/98% (0.1% formic acid). This peptide 
containing solution was then loaded onto a 2 cm long × 360 μm o.d. × 100 μm i.d. 
microcapillary fused silica pre-column packed with Magic 5 μm C18AQ resin (Michrom 
Biosciences). After sample loading, the pre-column was washed with 95% Solvent A (0.1% 
aqueous formic acid)/5% Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) for 20 min at a flow rate of 
2 uL/min. The pre-column was then connected to a 360 μm o.d. × 75 μm i.d. analytical 
column packed with 22 cm of 5 μm C18 resin. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 250 
nL/min by increasing the percentage of solvent B to 40% with a Nano-Acquity HPLC 
solvent delivery system (Waters Corp.). The LC system was directly connected through an 
electrospray ionization source interfaced to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos ion trap mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was controlled by Xcalibur 
software and operated in the data-dependent mode in which the initial MS scan recorded the 
mass to charge (m/z) ratios of ions over the range 400–2000. The 10 most abundant ions 
were automatically selected for subsequent collision-activated dissociation. Each sample 
was analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the 2 runs were denoted R1 and R2.
Raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) version 1.4 (Thermo 
Scientific). Peak lists were searched against a Reviewed Mouse Uniprot database 
(downloaded in 2016) using Sequest. The following parameters were used to identify tryptic 
peptides for protein identification: 10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance; 0.6 Da product ion 
mass tolerance; up to two missed trypsin cleavage sites; carbamidomethylation of Cys was 
set as a fixed modification; oxidation of Met was set as a variable modification. Peptide 
spectral matches (PSMs) for both runs for each sample were averaged. The relative 
abundance of proteins captured by each AC-NP formulation was determined by dividing the 
PSM values from each sample by the average PSMs across all samples for each protein 
(mean normalization).
The Percolator node within PD was used to calculate peptide false discovery rates (FDR), 
and a 5% FDR was used to filter all results. Only proteins identified in both runs with ≥2 
peptides were reported. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the 
ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE34 partner repository with the dataset identifier 
PXD006049. The proteins captured by different AC-NPs formulations were compared and 
the overall P value was calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey 
post-test using the GraphPad Prism 5.0. P value: *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.005.
Identification of neoantigens35 Captured by each AC-NP formulation—
Neoantigen-containing proteins in the B16F10 mouse model were predicted in silico using 
our previously described pipeline24, 25. Note that only combinations of adjacent missense 
mutations supported on the same read of WES data were considered and only neoantigens

 predicted in four of four biological replicates were included in our analysis. This neoantigen 
list was combined with a previously published list of neoantigens24, 36. Briefly, a list of 
nanoparticle bound proteins obtained from the mass spec data was run through a python 
script to find proteins with at least one predicted neoantigen or previously identified 
neoantigen.
In Vivo Efficacy Studies in Mice
For all in vivo assays, six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson 
Laboratory) with the body weight of 20 grams were used. Sample sizes were calculated 
based on our preliminary data. We calculated an effect size of 1.821. The nonparametric 
analog of this effect size can be stated in terms of p1=Pr (X<Y), or an observation in Group 
X is less than an observation in Group Y when H1 is true. The null hypothesis being tested is 
p1=0.5. For effect size 1.821, p1=0.099. A sample size of at least 8 in each group will have 
80% power to detect a probability of 0.099 that an observation in Group X is less than an 
observation in Group Y, using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test, with a 0.05 two-
sided significance level. Mice were assigned to treatment groups based on cage numbers. 
The groups were not blinded. The efficacy data is representative one from three independent 
experiments. All animal work was approved and monitored by the University of North 
Carolina Animal Care and Use Committee.
Efficacy of AC-NPs in Improving the Abscopal Effect—For abscopal studies, 
50,000 B16-F10 cells were suspended in DMEM, mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel 
(BD Biosciences), and subcutaneously injected on the left flank of C57BL/6 mice on day 0 
(primary tumors) and the right flank on day 3 (secondary tumors). The left flank tumors 
(primary tumors) were irradiated with 8 Gy37, 38 on days 8, 9, and 10 using a X-RAD 320. A 
lead shield protected the rest of the animal. αPD-1 blocking antibody (10 mg/kg) was 
intraperitoneally injected into animals on days 5, 8, and 11. AC-NPs (2 mg in 100 μL PBS) 
were injected into primary tumors on days 10, 11, and 12. Note PLGA AC-NPs were 
suspended in DI H2O containing 0.05% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The detailed schedule can 
be found in Supplementary Fig. 2a. CD 8 depletion assays were conducted by administering 
anti-CD8 (clone: 2.43) antibody two days prior to tumor inoculation, on the day of tumor 
inoculation, and every four days following tumor inoculation for the duration of experiment. 
Animals were sacrificed when an aspect of tumor lengths reached a size of 1.5 cm. The same 
methodology used for the B16-F10 xenograft model was also used for the 4T1 orthotopic 
model with the exception that in these studies tumors were created by injecting 50,000 4T1 
cells into the mammary pads of mice.
TDPAs coated AC-NPs as Cancer Vaccines—For vaccine studies, 50,000 B16-F10 
cells in DMEM were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and 
subcutaneously injected on the left flank of C57BL/6 mice on day 0. Pre-loaded AC-NPs (2 
mgs) or free tumor antigens were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of mice on 
days 3, 6, and 9. Free tumor antigen injections were prepared by concentrating the 
supernatant from 1 million irradiated B16-F10 cells (the same amount and composition of 
supernatant used for AC-NP loading). The supernatant was concentrated using ultra-
filtration through an Ultracel membrane (100,000 NMWL Millipore). αPD-1 (clone:

 RMP1-14) blocking antibody (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into animals on days 
3, 6 and 9. The detailed schedule can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2b. As before, CD 8 
depletion assays were conducted by administering anti-CD8 (clone: 2.43) antibody two days 
prior to tumor inoculation, on the day of tumor inoculation, and every four days following 
tumor inoculation for the duration of experiment. Animals were sacrificed when an aspect of 
tumors exceeded 2.0 cm in length.
Tumor Volume Measurements
Two perpendicular diameters were measured with a caliper and tumor volumes were 
calculated using the formula V = 0.52 × a × b2, where a and b are the larger and smaller 
diameters, respectively. The tumor volumes were assessed every 2–3 days. Two independent 
researchers assessed tumor volume over time with one researcher blinded to the treatment 
group assignments. Statistical differences in average tumor growth curves were determined 
by two-way ANOVA using variables of time and volume. Differences in survival in each 
group were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and the overall P value was 
calculated by the log-rank test using the GraphPad Prism 5.0. P value: *, P<0.05; **, 
P<0.01; ***, P<0.005.
Uptake of AC-NPs by Antigen Presenting Cells in Irradiated Tumor and Lymph Nodes
For tumor inoculation, 50,000 B16-F10 cells in DMEM were mixed with an equal volume of 
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and subcutaneously injected on the left flank of C57BL/6 mice 
on day 0. The tumor was irradiated with 8 Gy using a Precision X-RAD 320 (Precision X-
ray, Inc.) on days 8, 9 and 10. The rest of the body was protected with lead shielding. After 
the last dose of radiation on day 10, rhodamine B-labeled AC-NPs (2mg) were injected into 
the irradiated tumor. The rhodamine B-labeled AC-NPs were prepared as described above 
with the exception that 5% wt/wt of PLGA-Rb was used for nanoprecipitation. The 
concentration of all labeled AC-NPs was quantified with a fluorescence spectrum 
photometer. The irradiated tumor and the nearby TDLNs were dissected 1 hour or 16 hours 
post treatment for flow cytometric analysis. Rhodamine B-labeled AC-NPs within lymph 
nodes were imaged with an IVIS imaging system. Uptake of AC-NPs into antigen presenting 
cells was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of single cell suspensions. These were stained 
with anti-mouse CD11c, F4/80, and B220 (Supplementary Table 1). The drainage of AC-
NPs in vaccination studies to APCs in nearby lymph nodes was assessed by subcutaneously 
injecting TDPAs coated rhodamine B-labeled AC-NPs and collecting nearby lymph nodes 1 
hour or 16 hours post injection for flow cytometric analysis. P value was calculated by Mann 
Whitney test using the GraphPad Prism 5.0. P value: *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.005.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Relative Abundance of Tumor Infiltrating T Cell Populations
B16-F10 tumors were harvested on day 16–18 post tumor inoculation for flow cytometric 
analysis of in vivo experiments. Single cell suspensions were prepared using collagenase/
hyaluronidase and DNase and red blood cells were lysed using ACK Lysis Buffer (Life 
Technologies). Live/Dead fixable yellow dead cell staining kit (Life Technologies) was 
applied for live/dead cell discrimination. Before surface staining, samples were incubated 
with Fc Block for 5 min on ice, followed by surface staining with anti-mouse CD45, CD3, 
CD8, CD4 (Supplementary Table 1). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for

 intracellular FOXP3 (eBioscience). T effector cells were phenotyped as CD8+ and regulatory 
T cells (Treg cells) as CD4+FOXP3+. All flow cytometric analysis was done using a 
Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP and analyzed using software Summit 5.2. Flow cytometric 
data analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. Two independent researchers performed 
collection and analysis of flow cytometric data. Differences were compared and the overall P 
value was calculated by Mann Whitney test using the GraphPad Prism 5.0. (P value: *, 
P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.005.) The representative plots of relative abundance of tumor 
infiltrating T cells were showed in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Flow Cytometric Analysis Evaluating IFN-γ Production by T Cells following Stimulation Ex 
Vivo
Splenocytes were harvested on day 16–18 post B16-F10 tumor inoculation and plated for 
culture. The splenocytes were re-stimulated with TDPAs isolated from B16F10 lysates or 
neoantigens (Actn4, Eef1, Tubb3, Dag1) for 72 hours. After stimulation, splenocytes were 
washed and stained. Single cell suspensions were blocked with Fc Block for 5 minutes on 
ice and then stained with anti-mouse CD3, CD8, CD4 (Supplementary Table 1). Live/dead 
fixable yellow dead cell stain kit (Life Technologies) was applied for live/dead cell 
discrimination. For surface staining, samples were first incubated with Fc block for 5 min on 
ice and stained with anti-mouse CD3, CD8, CD4 (Supplementary Table 1). Cells were then 
fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular IFN-γ. All flow cytometric analysis was 
done using a Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP and analyzed using software Summit 5.2. The 
data were presented as the percentage of CD8+IFN-γ+ in CD8+ cells, and the percentage of 
CD4+IFN-γ+cells in CD4+ cells. Differences were compared and the overall P value was 
calculated by Mann Whitney test using the GraphPad Prism 5.0. (P value: *, P<0.05; **, 
P<0.01; ***, P<0.005.) The representative plots of relative abundance IFN-γ production T 
cells were showed in Supplementary Fig. 10.
Assessment Antigen Specific Immunity using ELISPOT
For analysis of interferon gammar (IFN-γ) production, spleens were harvested on day 16–18 
post B16-F10 tumor inoculation from animals in all treatment groups. Single cell 
suspensions were prepared. IFN-γ production was measured with BD™ ELISPOT assay 
system (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Briefly, the splenocytes were seeded at different cell densities into 96-well plates that were 
pretreated with capture antibody and incubated in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 
NEAA and 10 μM predicted peptides (Actn4, Eef1, Tubb3, or Dag1) at 37°C. After 18 
hours, cells were removed and production of IFN-γ was detected by adding detection 
antibody followed by enzyme conjugation. Signals were developed using BD™ ELISPOT 
substrate set and plates were evaluated in high resolution using automated ELISPOT reader 
systems from Zeiss (ELISPOT) and AID (Fluorospot).
