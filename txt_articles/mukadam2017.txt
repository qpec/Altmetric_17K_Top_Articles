Abstract.
7
Background: Bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve, protect against cognitive decline, and delay the onset of
dementia.
8
9
Objective: We systematically reviewed evidence about the effect of bilingualism on subsequent cognitive decline or dementia.
10
Methods: We searched electronic databases and references for longitudinal studies comparing cognitive decline in people
who were bilingual with those who were monolingual and evaluated study quality. We conducted meta-analyses using random
effects models to calculate pooled odds ratio of incident dementia.
11
12
13
Results: We included 13/1,156 eligible articles. Meta-analysis of prospective studies of the effects of bilingualism on future
dementia gave a combined Odds Ratio of dementia of 0.96 (95% CI 0.74–1.23) in bilingual participants (n = 5,527) compared
to monolinguals. Most retrospective studies found that bilingual people were reported to develop symptoms of cognitive
decline at a later age than monolingual participants.

17
Conclusion: We did not find that bilingualism protects from cognitive decline or dementia from prospective studies. Retro-
spective studies are more prone to confounding by education, or cultural differences in presentation to dementia services and
are therefore not suited to establishing causative links between risk factors and outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
22
As the number of people with dementia contin-
23
ues to rise worldwide, with the accompanying social
24
and healthcare burden [1], there is growing interest
25
in factors that may delay or prevent the onset of cog-
26
nitive decline and dementia [2]. It is recommended
27
that people should learn multiple languages to delay
28
the onset of dementia [3].
29
Cognitive reserve, defined as resilience to neu-
30
ropathological damage [4], has been shown to delay

dementia onset, possibly by enhancing neural net-
32
works [5] or improving specific cognitive strategies
33
[6]. Being fluent in two or more languages may
34
contribute to cognitive reserve [7], and this may be
35
a specific effect, rather than the general effect of
36
more education, because switching languages possi-
37
bly leads to an enhanced executive function rather
38
than enhancing medial temporal memory circuitry
39
[8]. Bilingualism, however, is complex and hetero-
40
geneous and is linked to factors, such as education,
41
that can also affect risk of dementia [9].
42
Retrospective studies have found that bilingual-
43
ism delays the onset of dementia by around four
44
years [7, 10, 11]. Some prospective studies have sim-
45
ilarly found a protective effect of learning additional

languages [12–14], while others have not [15–17].
47
We therefore systematically reviewed the literature
48
in this field to clarify the link between bilingualism
49
and cognitive decline or dementia.
50
METHODS
51
Search strategy
52
We searched PubMed (from 1946) and Web of
53
Knowledge (from 1900) until 23 November 2016,
54
using search terms “bilingual*” OR “language” AND
55
“dementia”, “AD”, “Alzheimer*” OR “cognit*”. We
56
placed no limits on language or date of publication.
57
We combined the search results and removed dupli-
58
cates. We searched the references of included papers
59
for further papers of interest.
60
Inclusion criteria
61
We included primary research published in peer-
62
reviewed publications in any language which fulfilled
63
the following three criteria:
64
• included people who spoke more than one lan-
65
guage and a comparison group who did not.
66
• reported on cognitive function in participants not
67
diagnosed with pre-existing neurological disor-
68
ders.
69
• reported either a quantitative cognitive outcome
70
measure on a validated cognitive test or incident
71
dementia or incident mild cognitive impairment.
72
Exclusion criteria
73
• Meeting abstracts and letters.
74
• Comparisons between multilinguals and bilin-
75
guals with no monolingual group.
76
Searches and inclusion of papers
77
One of the authors (NM) conducted the searches
78
and read all titles and abstracts. She read papers of
79
studies with abstracts or titles that met inclusion crite-
80
ria in full to decide whether they met inclusion criteria
81
and discussed those which there were any questions
82
about with the other authors.
83
Quality assessment
84
Two of the authors (NM and AS) independently
85
read included papers and assessed their quality using
86
an eight-point checklist from the Newcastle-Ottawa
87
scale for non-randomized studies [18] (see Sup-
88
plementary Table 1). The questions were: Was the
89
cohort representative of a defined population? Was
90
the exposure (language status) accurately defined
91
and measured? Was outcome clearly defined and
92
measured? Have the authors adjusted for all impor-
93
tant confounding factors? Was follow-up complete
94
(>70%) (including death as follow-up)? Was follow-
95
up long enough (>5 years)?
96
We pre-specified that we would categorize as
97
higher quality studies those with a definition of
98
or assessment of bilingualism, with reliable and
99
valid cognitive outcome measures and adjusted for
100
important confounders known to be associated with
101
cognitive outcomes such as age, sex, education, vas-
102
cular risk factors, and other potential confounders
103
such as immigration and socio-economic status.
104
This was to ensure that higher quality studies had
105
valid measures of the exposure and outcome and
106
the findings could not be accounted for by known
107
confounders. We contacted authors for further infor-
108
mation regarding their studies if this was not clear, in
109
order to be able to assess quality accurately.
110
Analysis
111
If studies had multiple waves of data collection,
112
we examined data from after the five-year follow-
113
up. We planned to combine data from three or
114
more studies where possible using a meta-analysis.
115
We extracted raw data of numbers of people diag-
116
nosed with dementia in the respective bilingual and
117
non-bilingual groups and combined unadjusted odds
118
ratios from included studies, to calculate an overall
119
unadjusted risk of developing dementia in bilinguals
120
versus non-bilinguals using random effects models
121
meta-analyses [19] with RevMan version 5.3 soft-
122
ware. This approach is suitable for combining studies
123
from heterogeneous populations and when different
124
binary outcome measures are reported as it accounts
125
for between-study variance [20].
126
RESULTS
127
The PRISMA diagram in Fig. 1 shows our search
128
strategy results. We included 13 of 1,154 articles,
129
reporting 13 separate studies fulfilling our crite-
130
ria. Four studies were excluded after the full paper
131
was retrieved—one because there was no record of
132
whether or not participants spoke more than one

language, [14], another because it did not include a
134
monolingual comparator group [21]. and two because
135
they compared bilingual participants with multilin-
136
gual rather than monolingual participants [12, 13].
137
Of the included studies, five were prospective and
138
reported in Table 1 and eight were retrospective
139
or cross-sectional and are reported in Table 2. We
140
contacted and obtained additional information on
141
follow-up rates and outcomes from authors of two
142
included papers. Quality scores for each item in all
143
studies are given in Supplementary Table 2.
144
Prospective studies (see Table 1)
145
The prospective studies all recruited a random
146
sample of community-dwelling participants with-
147
out baseline cognitive impairment [15–17, 22, 23].
148
Bilingualism was defined as the self-reported ability
149
to communicate in two languages. One study vali-
150
dated reports of bilingualism with a reading test [17]
151
but used self-defined proficiency in primary analyses.
152
The outcome, measured at least five years later, was
153
either cognitive testing or formal diagnostic assess-
154
ments. One study interviewed people in English and
155
defined them as native English speakers or non-native
156
English speakers with the latter group being asked
157
if they spoke another language and how often they
158
spoke it [23]. This study may therefore have included
159
some bilingual native English speakers in the ‘mono-
160
lingual’ group.
161
Four higher quality studies used dementia diag-
162
nosis as the outcome [15–17, 23]. All of these
163
studies made the diagnosis by using cognitive screen-
164
ing tests then further cognitive assessment if scores

were low. One of these studies calculated an odds
166
ratio for developing dementia, adjusted for age, sex,
167
education, and subjective memory loss [16]. The
168
others compared mean age of dementia diagnosis
169
[15], hazard ratio for incident dementia [23], and
170
Cox regression on rate of dementia conversion [17],
171
respectively. None of these studies found signifi-
172
cant differences between bilingual and monolingual
173
participants.
174
These outcomes were too heterogeneous to be
175
combined in a meta-analysis but all the papers con-
176
tained raw data of numbers of people diagnosed with
177
dementiaintherespectivebilingualandnon-bilingual
178
groups. We extracted this data and conducted a meta-
179
analysis of 5,527 participants. The meta-analysis
180
combined unadjusted odds ratios from included stud-
181
ies to calculate an overall unadjusted odds ratio
182
of developing dementia in bilinguals versus non-
183
bilinguals of 0.96 (95% CI 0.74–1.23) (see Fig. 2),
184
which indicates no advantage of bilingualism in
185
protecting against dementia compared to monolin-
186
gualism. In the studies included in the meta-analysis,
187
two reported bilinguals to have received more edu-
188
cation, one found no significant difference between
189
education of bilinguals and monolinguals, and one
190
reported that they received less education although
191
reading level and therefore English proficiency, was
192
similar in both groups.
193
Another, lower quality, study did not control for
194
any confounding factors (e.g., sex, education) [22].
195
This study used scores on validated tests of differ-
196
ent cognitive functions such as verbal fluency and
197
memory. It found that those who were bilingual
198
had higher scores on the tests of premorbid cogni-
199
tive functioning, National Adult Reading Test [24]
200
and General Fluid-Type Intelligence (G-factor), than
201
monolinguals.

211
pants by advertising to the public and specifically
212
requesting physician referrals of people with memory

215

216
or as speaking two languages for most of one’s adult
217
life.Onestudyinthisgroupalsoincludedanobjective

219
Five studies asked informants when they had first
220
noticed participants’ symptoms of cognitive impair-
221
ment [7, 10, 11, 27, 28]. All of these studies found that
222
bilingual participants’ informants noticed symptom
223
onset four to five years later than their monolingual
224
counterparts. In all of these studies, bilingual partic-
225
ipants were either more likely to be immigrants or to
226
have had more years of education than monolingual
227
participants.
228
Three studies used age of diagnosis at the clinic
229
visit at which they were diagnosed with either all-
230
cause dementia or MCI as the outcome [25, 26, 29].
231
Of these, two found no significant difference in age
232
of diagnosis between monolinguals and bilinguals
233
and no significant differences in years of educa-
234
tion between the two groups [26, 29]. The third
235
study found that age of diagnosis of amnestic MCI,
236
was on average 4.5 years later in bilinguals than
237
monolinguals but there was no difference in age of
238
diagnosis for multiple domain MCI (mean difference
239
–2.6 years, t(41) = 1·11; p = 0.27) [25]. The monolin-
240
gual and bilingual participants did not differ in years
241
of education but there was no information on their
242
employment or immigrant status.
243
DISCUSSION
244
Our systematic review is the first to bring together
245
all published evidence comparing cognitive decline
246
or dementia in people who are bilingual compared to
247
those who are monolingual. We found that, in indi-
248
vidual prospective studies, there was no difference
249
betweenbilingualandmonolingualparticipantsinthe
250
rate of development of dementia when baseline dif-
251
ferences were taken into account. Combining these
252
studies in this new meta-analysis has strengthened
253
this conclusion as we found no reduction in the odds
254
ratio of dementia in those who were bilingual com-
255
pared to those who were not. By contrast, bilingual
256
participants present around 4.5 years later in retro-
257
spective studies, where individuals’ participation in
258
the study depended on self-presentation, and time of
259
initial symptoms are self-reported rather than stan-
260
dardized.
261
Studying the effect of an exposure, in this case
262
bilingualism, on outcome is ideally carried out
263
prospectively in order to reduce recall bias and clarify

the temporal relationship. None of the prospective
265
studies of the development of dementia as an out-
266
come found any protective effect of bilingualism,
267
either individually, when adjusted for confounders,
268
or on meta-analysis. These studies were large, exam-
269
ined all participants for dementia using standard
270
methods, with good follow-up rates, controlled for
271
confounders, had a duration of 5–10 years and mea-
272
sured incidence of dementia, a clinically relevant
273
outcome. As large high-quality prospective studies
274
have not shown an association between bilingualism
275
and dementia, this indicates that bilingualism is not
276
an independent protective factor.
277
A prospective but lower quality study (which did
278
not control for sex or education) was not included in
279
the meta-analysis as it measured cognitive function
280
rather than incident dementia. It found bilingualism
281
had a protective effect on cognition. In this study,
282
bilingual people scored more highly on the National
283
Adult Reading Test, which is a measure of premorbid
284
attainment, suggesting higher cognition and educa-
285
tion at entry; although there was no information on
286
baseline differences in participants [22]. Thus, dif-
287
ferences in the groups’ outcomes may be due to
288
educational or social differences rather than to bilin-
289
gualism itself.
290
Retrospective studies in this review usually used
291
either informant report about the date of onset of
292
symptoms or the date of presentation to memory
293
clinic as date of onset. This is potentially influ-
294
enced by many personal and cultural factors. People
295
from minority ethnic backgrounds tend to seek help
296
later for dementia [30] and may define the onset of
297
symptoms differently, potentially explaining findings
298
of later reported symptom onset from retrospective
299
studies that included more immigrants in the bilin-
300
gual group. Although some of these studies adjusted
301
statistically for baseline differences in education,
302
they cannot account for cultural differences in help-
303
seeking.
304
Retrospective studies that did not include a greater
305
number of people from immigrant backgrounds in
306
the bilingual groups, usually included bilingual par-
307
ticipants with higher levels of education. Education
308
is protective against cognitive decline [31]. Although
309
these studies have adjusted for education in their anal-
310
yses, where group assignation is non-random, there is
311
no way of determining whether associations between
312
group membership (bilingual versus non-bilingual)
313
and the dependent variable are due to random error
314
or a true group difference [32]. In addition, years of
315
education completed is not always an indicator of
316
quality of education and the latter could be influenced
317
by other variables such as socioeconomic status.
318
Two studies which did not qualify for inclusion,
319
compared multilingual participants with bilingual
320
participants. Both of these studies were conducted in
321
countries where speaking multiple languages is com-
322
mon and participants were likely to switch between
323
different languages many times a day. One study had
324
a 14% follow-up rate and did not compare those who
325
droppedoutandthosewhodidnot[12].Theotherwas
326
cross-sectional and found being multilingual rather
327
than bilingual was protective, giving an odds ratio of
328
0.3 for cognitive impairment (95% Confidence Inter-
329
val 0.10–0.92) after adjustment for education and
330
age [13]. Both studies found that knowing and using
331
more than two languages seems to confer a cogni-
332
tive advantage and multi-lingualism may differ from
333
bilingualism but there is not enough evidence as yet
334
to draw definitive conclusions.
335
Strengths and limitations of this review
336
Our review was systematic and we searched using
337
broad search terms and refined our search strategy to
338
include as many potentially relevant papers as pos-
339
sible. We also hand searched references of relevant
340
papers to identify further papers. We are therefore
341
unlikely to have missed papers matching our inclu-
342
sion criteria. We also emailed authors for missing
343
information or clarification and this improved the
344
accuracy of our information. Quality rating was
345
completed using a scale which is widely used and
346

N. Mukadam et al. / The Relationship of Bilingualism Compared to Monolingualism
9
independently derived. The quality was rated by two
347
authors independently. However, only one author
348
screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. We have
349
not carried out a funnel plot to screen for publication
350
bias but as most of the prospective studies found neg-
351
ative results, publication bias is unlikely to positively
352
skew the results. We could only carry out a meta-
353
analysis on unadjusted odds ratios so our estimate is
354
likely to over-estimate the effect of bilingualism.
355
Conclusion
356
We did not find evidence that bilingualism, when
357
appropriately adjusted for education, protects from
358
cognitive decline or dementia. Public health policy
359
should therefore remove recommendations regard-
360
ing bilingualism [3] as a strategy to delay dementia
361
and instead concentrate on more generally reducing
362
cognitive inactivity [33].
