BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder 
leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of 
modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of 
AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether 
variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical 
hypothyroidism are also associated with AF.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual 
participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid 
function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from 
MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The 
euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 
4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with 
free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The association of TSH 
levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF 
was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid 
participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 levels 
and incident AF.
RESULTS: Of 30 
085 participants from 11 cohorts (278 
955 person-years 
of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 
individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was 
not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants 
or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline 
in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- 
and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 
1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; P for 
trend ≤0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after 
further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but 
not TSH levels, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
A
trial fibrillation (AF) affects >30 million individu-
als worldwide, and its prevalence and incidence 
are increasing globally.1 AF leads to significant 
morbidity and mortality,2 and increases the risk of 
stroke, heart failure, and subsequent hospitalizations.3 
Identification of modifiable risk factors and potentially 
reversible causes is crucial for the prevention and treat-
ment of AF. Overt hyperthyroidism is a recognized risk 
factor for AF,4 and measurement of thyroid function is 
recommended in the initial evaluation of patients with 
AF.5 Subclinical thyroid dysfunction, which is defined 
as abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 
with free thyroid hormone concentrations within the 
reference range, is common, with up to 9% of the adult 
population being affected by subclinical hypothyroid-
ism and 2% to 3% by subclinical hyperthyroidism.6,7 
The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroid-
ism, especially when TSH levels are <0.10 mIU/L.8,9
Subclinical hypothyroidism increases the risk of car-
diovascular events,10 but its association with incident AF 
risk remains uncertain.9,11–13 Variations in thyroid hor-
mone levels within the reference range have been as-
sociated with adverse cardiac events, and recent studies 
have suggested that higher free thyroxine (fT4) levels 
lead to an increased risk of heart failure and sudden 
cardiac death in euthyroid individuals.14,15 Data from 
observational studies on the association between thy-
roid function within the reference range and the inci-
dence of AF are conflicting.11,16,17
Therefore, we aimed to examine the risk of AF in 
individuals with thyroid function within the normal 
range and subclinical hypothyroidism by performing an 
individual participant data (IPD) analysis of prospective 
cohort studies. An IPD analysis might help clarify the 
conflicting results of previous studies; it is considered 
the methodological gold standard for summarizing evi-
dence from observational studies and for analyzing the 
impact of age, sex, and thyroid medication in subgroup 
analyses, because it is not affected by potential aggre-
gation bias from study-level meta-analyses (ecological 
fallacy).18,19 This approach allows also a uniform defini-
tion of thyroid function and adjustments of similar con-
founders with the aim of reducing heterogeneity across 
studies.
METHODS
This IPD analysis was conducted according to the predefined 
protocol registered on the international prospective regis-
ter of systematic reviews PROSPERO (registration number 
CRD42016043906). Reporting conformed to the PRISMA-IPD 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
Analyses of individual participant data) statement.20
Data Sources and Study Selection
We conducted a systematic literature review of published 
articles in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, from incep-
tion to July 27, 2016, on the association between TSH and 
AF events, without language restriction (Methods I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). We also performed a man-
ual literature search, in which we reviewed expert articles 
in the field, screened bibliographies from retrieved articles, 
and requested data from cohorts participating in the Thyroid 
Studies Collaboration.8,10,21,22 Predefined inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria were used to improve comparability and quality 
of the studies. We included only full-text published longitu-
dinal cohort studies that assessed thyroid function at base-
line (serum TSH and fT4), and that had a euthyroid control 
group and prospective follow-up of AF events. We excluded 
studies that included only participants with overt thyroid dys-
function (abnormal TSH and fT4 levels), that included only 
participants who took thyroid-altering medications (antithy-
roid drugs, thyroxine, or amiodarone), or that assessed only 
postoperative AF events. Two authors (C.B. and C.F.) indepen-
dently screened references for eligibility; discrepancies were 
resolved in consultation with a third author (N.R.). Agreement 
between reviewers was 98.6% for the first screening phase 
(titles and abstracts, κ=0.66), and 95.0% for the second 
screening phase (full-text screen, κ=0.83).
Two authors (C.B. and C.F.) rated the methodological 
quality of the included studies based on individual criteria of 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (Methods II 
in the online-only Data Supplement).23
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with 
increased risk of atrial fibrillation, but the associa-
tion with thyroid function in the normal range or 
subclinical hypothyroidism is unclear.
• We performed an individual participant data analy-
sis investigating the association between thyroid 
function within the normal range or subclinical 
hypothyroidism and the risk of atrial fibrillation, 
including >30 
000 participants from 11 prospective 
cohort studies.
• Our study showed that higher free thyroxine lev-
els were associated with an increased risk of atrial 
fibrillation in euthyroid persons, whereas thyroid-
stimulating hormone levels were not.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation and 
its potentially disabling clinical outcomes, identifi-
cation of modifiable risk factors is important.
• Free thyroxine levels might add to further assess-
ment of atrial fibrillation risk.
• Further studies need to investigate whether these 
findings apply to thyroxine-treated patients, who 
often have higher circulating free thyroxine levels 
than untreated participants, to assess whether 
treatment goals should be modified.

Institutional review boards approved all studies, and writ-
ten informed consent was granted by all participants. The 
sponsors had no role in the design, analysis, or reporting of 
the study.
Data Extraction
We contacted investigators from included studies and 
requested prespecified IPD on baseline thyroid function (TSH 
and fT4), demographic characteristics (age, sex, race), cardio-
vascular and AF risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, 
total cholesterol, smoking), preexisting cardiovascular disease, 
history of AF, and medication use at baseline (thyroid-altering 
medications including thyroxine, antithyroid medication, lith-
ium, amiodarone, glucocorticoids, iodine, aspirin, furosemide; 
cardiovascular medications such as antihypertensive and lipid-
lowering drugs) for each participant (see Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement for definition of baseline covariates in 
the included studies). Data on AF outcomes were collected. 
We checked data for consistency and completeness, excluded 
unrealistic data points, and contacted authors of the cohorts 
to clarify variable definitions. For 2 studies for which authors 
could not share IPD (one cohort because of legal constraints,24 
and another9 because of prohibitive costs; Table 1), we looked 
for published aggregate data on the association between thy-
roid function and AF, so we could perform sensitivity analyses 
that included these studies.
Thyroid Function Testing
In line with our previous analyses,8,10,21 and based on an expert 
consensus meeting of the Thyroid Studies Collaboration 
(International Thyroid Conference, Paris, France, 2010), 
expert reviews,34,35 and previous large cohorts,13,36 we used 
uniform cutoff levels of TSH to define thyroid dysfunction and 
optimize the comparability of the included studies. Similar 
to previous studies, euthyroidism was defined as a TSH level 
from 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L and further subdivided into 5 cat-
egories: 0.45 to 0.99 mIU/L; 1.00 to 1.49 mIU/L; 1.50 to 2.49 
mIU/L; 2.50 to 3.49 mIU/L; and 3.50 to 4.49 mIU/L.37
Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level 
between 4.5 and 19.9 mIU/L with fT4 levels in the reference 
range, and was further subdivided into subclinical hypothy-
roidism with mildly elevated TSH 4.50 to 6.9 mU/L, moderately

*We excluded from our analyses participants with prevalent AF at baseline, missing outcomes for AF, subclinical hyperthyroidism and overt thyroid dysfunction, 
and intake of thyroxine or antithyroid medication at baseline.
†We excluded participants <18 years of age.
‡Cardiovascular disease at baseline was defined as a known history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary 
angioplasty, or bypass surgery.
§We used a common definition of subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH 4.5 mIU/L to 19.9mIU/L and normal free thyroxine level, but TSH cutoff values varied among 
the previous reports from each cohort, so numbers are different than in the original articles. To analyze only endogenous subclinical hypothyroidism, we excluded 
253 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, 207 in the Health ABC Study, 43 in the MrOS, 15 in the Bari study, 12 in the Leiden 85-plus study, 107 in the 
SHIP
, 21 InCHIANTI, 26 in the Rotterdam study, 188 in the PROSPER study, 301 in the EPIC-Norfolk study, and 4 in the Busselton Health study because they used 
thyroid medication at baseline.
‖We had no data on thyroid medication use during follow-up for 481 participants in the Study of Health in Pomerania, and all participants in the EPIC-Norfolk 
and the Rotterdam study. Ninety-one participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study did not have information on thyroxin during follow-up, and information on 
antithyroid medication during follow-up was missing for all patients of the Cardiovascular Health Study. Five persons took both thyroxine and antithyroid medication 
during the course of follow-up.
#For all cohorts, we used the maximal follow-up data that were available, which may differ from previous reports of some cohorts. For the Cardiovascular Health 
Study, we set the baseline for our analysis to the year 5 visit of the original cohort because free thyroxine was measured at the year 5 visit.
**SHIP includes participants from Pomerania, where an iodine supplementation program began in the mid-1990s. This shifted the distribution of TSH values 
toward the left in its first years, which lowered TSH values in the population of the SHIP Study during baseline examinations in 1997 to 2001.
†† Number of participants with euthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism are not listed here, because they were 
not included in our sensitivity analysis or in the aggregate data from this cohort.
‡‡ Data on characteristics of 8740 participants included in the longitudinal analysis by Chaker et al24 was obtained through contact with the authors. Individual 
participant data of 1602 participants was available for Rotterdam Study Cohort I (see above).

performed a sensitivity analysis, with exclusion of individuals 
with missing fT4 values.
Study-specific cutoffs were used for fT4 (Table 2) because 
intermethod variation is greater for these measurements than 
in TSH assays10; participants were categorized in fT4 quartiles.
We excluded those with overt thyroid dysfunction or thy-
roid hormone values that suggested nonthyroidal illness (low 
TSH and fT4 levels) or subclinical hyperthyroidism, because 
we have already published these results (this previous pub-
lication was based on a smaller number of studies, because 
new data became available after its publication in 2012).8 
To restrict our analysis to patients with endogenous values 
of thyroid function, participants on thyroid medication (thy-
roxine, antithyroid medication) at baseline were excluded 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement), whereas 
those initiating thyroid medications during follow-up were 
included in the main analyses.8 Additional sensitivity analyses 
excluding users of thyroid medication during follow-up were 
performed.
Outcomes
The outcome was incident AF; participants with preexisting 
AF at baseline were excluded from all analyses. The ascer-
tainment of AF included ECGs during follow-up (9 studies), 
self-report, diagnostic codes, and review of medical records 
depending on the cohorts (Table 2). Because AF ascertain-
ment by self-report and review of medical records might be 
less specific, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding 
studies with AF diagnosis without ECG review. Any type of AF 
(paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) was considered.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in baseline characteristics of participants with 
euthyroidism and those with subclinical hypothyroidism 
were compared by using a χ2 test or Student t test, as appro-
priate. Crude incidence rates for AF per 1000 person-years 
were calculated by using an inverse variance random-effects 
meta-analysis of log incidence rates, and point estimates 
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were exponentiated 
to obtain the incidence rates. An IPD analysis was conducted 
by using a 1-step approach.18 A Cox proportional hazard 
regression analysis using random effects (shared frailty) by 
cohort was used to describe the association between inci-
dent AF and TSH or fT4.38 The proportional hazards assump-
tion was met. For the analysis with TSH as the explanatory 
variable, euthyroid participants within the TSH category 
from 3.50 to 4.49 mIU/L were used as the reference group. 
The reference group was chosen according to the assump-
tion of an S-shaped association between TSH and the risk of 
AF based on previous findings.11,14 All TSH categories were 
analyzed in a single model. Following the recent publica-
tions of studies indicating an association between fT4 levels 
in the reference range and major adverse events including 
AF14,24 and stroke,22 we also conducted a secondary analysis 
(not prespecified in the study protocol) of the association 
between fT4 in the euthyroid range and AF; study-specific 
quartiles of fT4 were computed, and the lowest fT4 quartile 
was the reference group. Only participants with both TSH 
and fT4 levels within the reference range were included in 
the secondary analysis.
The main analyses of both the association between TSH 
or fT4 and incidence of AF were adjusted for age and sex.10 
In a following step, additional adjustment was done for tra-
ditional cardiovascular risk factors, including systolic blood 
pressure, current or former smoking, diabetes mellitus, total 
cholesterol, and prevalent cardiovascular disease (multivari-
able adjusted analysis); because some of these risk factors 
might be mediators in the relationship between thyroid 
hormones and incidence of AF, the age- and sex-adjusted 
model was considered the main analysis. Whenever there 
was an indication of a linear association, we calculated P for 
linear trend for the main and multivariable adjusted analy-
sis. Because data were not available in all cohorts, we also 
performed sensitivity analyses additionally adjusted for (1) 
antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication and (2) body 
mass index. Additional sensitivity analyses (3) included all 
individuals regardless of intake of thyroid medication (thy-
roxine or antithyroid medication), so participants with thy-
roid medication use at baseline were added to this sensitivity 
analysis, (4) excluded participants who took amiodarone at 
baseline (or studies that did not provide this information), 
(5) excluded participants who took any other medications 
that might alter thyroid function (amiodarone, lithium, glu-
cocorticoids, iodine, aspirin, and furosemide) at baseline, (6) 
excluded those having received thyroid medication during 
follow-up (or studies that did not provide this information), 
(7) excluded studies in which no ECGs were used to diag-
nose AF, (8) excluded studies with >5% lost to follow-up, 
and (9) excluded a study that tested thyroid function an 
average of 3.4 years before incident AF was first assessed.26 
For analyses of the association between TSH levels and the 
risk of AF, we also performed sensitivity analyses that (10) 
excluded participants whose fT4 measurements were miss-
ing; (11) were restricted to individuals with persistent thyroid 
function state, ie, included only those with thyroid function 
measurements that remained in the same category (euthy-
roidism or subclinical hypothyroidism) during follow-up thy-
roid function testing; and (12) excluded a study29 conducted 
in a region where an iodine supplementation program was 
initiated a few years before the study was started, leading 
to a shift of TSH values toward lower levels in this popula-
tion during the baseline examination.39 All sensitivity analy-
ses were prespecified in our protocol, with the exception of 
analyses 4, 9, 11, and 12.
To examine potential sources of heterogeneity, we con-
ducted predefined subgroup analyses similar to those in our 
previous studies,8,10 which considered age, sex, race, and the 
prevalence of cardiovascular disease. In an additional analysis, 
individuals with thyroxine use at baseline were included, and 
a subgroup analysis stratified on thyroxine use at baseline was 
performed. P values to test for interaction in the subgroup 
analyses were derived from Wald tests.
We analyzed the association between continuous concen-
trations of TSH or fT4 and AF. For the association between 
TSH and AF, a 4-knot restricted cubic spline was used with 
knots at TSH levels of 1.0 mIU/L, 2.5 mIU/L, 4.5 mIU/L, and 
10 mIU/L, to represent 3 categories within the reference TSH 
range, and categories of subclinical hypothyroidism with 
mildly to moderately elevated TSH and markedly elevated TSH

levels, as well.10 Hazard ratios (HRs) were compared with a 
reference value of 3.5 mIU/L, according to the lower bound 
of the cutoff used for our reference category. For the asso-
ciation between continuous concentrations of fT4 within the 
reference range and AF, we expressed fT4 in SD units cen-
tered around the mean to make fT4 values comparable across 
studies. For this analysis, we used a 1-knot restricted cubic 
spline with the knot placed at the median value of fT4 in SD 
units, which resulted in the best model fit. Spline regression 
analyses were adjusted for age and sex. We calculated a P for 
nonlinear trend using a likelihood ratio test comparing the 
models with and without the TSH or fT4 splines, respectively. 
This analysis was not prespecified in our protocol. Statistical 
significance was tested 2-sided, and P values of <0.05 were 
judged significant. We used inverse variance random-effects 
meta-analysis to combine the summary estimates of our IPD 
analysis with results from 2 studies that provided only aggre-
gate data. We used a funnel plot to assess for potential 
publication bias of the association between fT4 levels within 
the reference range and the risk of AF, considering the esti-
mates of the highest quartile of fT4 in comparison with the 
lowest quartile. All analyses were conducted by using Stata 
version 14.1 (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: 
Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP
.).
RESULTS
Of the 1418 identified reports, 14 prospective studies 
met our eligibility criteria (Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement and Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Among those, 6 studies9,13,14,16,24,31 were 
published, and 8 cohorts25–30,32,33 offered previously un-
published data. Because 2 of the studies included the 
same population, we contacted 13 cohorts and asked 
them to share IPD. Of these, 11 international cohorts

(from Europe, the United States, and Australia) agreed 
to provide IPD, and we added summary estimates of 2 
studies that did not provide IPD in random-effects mod-
els as sensitivity analyses.
After exclusion of participants with thyroxine and 
antithyroid medication use at baseline, 30 085 indi-
viduals were included in the final analysis (Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Among included 
participants, the median age was 69 years at inclu-
sion, 51.6% were women, 28 127 individuals were 
euthyroid, and 1958 (6.5%) had endogenous subclin-
ical hypothyroidism. Median follow-up ranged from 
1.3 to 17 years across the different studies, adding 
up to 278 955 person-years of follow-up; during this 
time, 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed incident AF. 
Thyroid medication use (thyroxine and antithyroid 
medication) during follow-up varied from 1.2% to 
11.2% in the various studies (Table 1). In compari-
son with participants with euthyroidism, those with 
subclinical hypothyroidism were older, more likely to 
be women, or more likely to be affected by affected 
by comorbidities including cardiovascular disease or 
diabetes mellitus (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Overall study quality was high; all included studies 
scored ≥6 points on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality As-
sessment Scale. All cohorts were community based, 
and 2 cohorts27,32 did not use ECG review to diagnose 
AF. Length of follow-up was >5 years, except for 2 
studies,27,31 and loss of follow-up was <5% in 6 studies 
(Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
TSH Within the Reference Range  
and the Risk of AF
Crude incidence rates are presented in Figure 1. In age- 
and sex-adjusted analyses, there was no association 
between TSH levels in the reference range and risk of 
AF (Figure 1). When analyzing continuous concentra-
tions of TSH, the risk of AF increased with low-normal 
TSH levels and slightly decreased with higher TSH levels 
(but remained close to a HR of 1.0) in comparison with 
the reference level of 3.5 mIU/L (Figure III in the on-
line-only Data Supplement). Sensitivity analyses yielded 
similar results (Table 3 and Table V in the online-only 
Data Supplement), and no significant interaction was 
found when analyses were stratified according to sex, 
age, or previous cardiovascular disease. In the analysis 
with additional inclusion of individuals with thyroxine 
use at baseline, point estimates were higher among 
thyroxine users than among those not on thyroxine in 
a subgroup analysis, but without statistical significance 
likely because of the limited number of thyroxine users 
(n=1146, Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).
Subclinical Hypothyroidism and the Risk 
of AF
In comparison with the reference level of 3.50 to 4.49 
mIU/L, subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated 
with incident AF in age- and sex-adjusted analyses, 
with a HR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74–1.14) for a TSH level 
of 4.5 to 6.9 mIU/L, a HR of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.73–1.41) 
for a TSH level of 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, and a HR of 0.94

†For this sensitivity analysis, we added a total of 1177 thyroid medication users (thyroxin or antithyroid drugs) to the overall sample: 253 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study; 207 
in the Health ABC Study; 43 in the MrOS; 15 in the Bari Study; 12 in the Leiden 85-plus Study; 107 in the SHIP; 21 in the Invecchiare in Chianti Study; 26 in the Rotterdam Study; 188 in the 
PROSPER Study; 301 in the EPIC-Norfolk Study; and, 4 in the Busselton Health Study.
‡The number of thyroid medication users (thyroxin or antithyroid drugs) during follow-up is indicated in Table 1.
§A total of 123 participants who took amiodarone were excluded for this sensitivity analysis of the association between TSH and AF: 2 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study; 3 
in the Health ABC Study; 1 in the MrOS; 79 in the Bari Study; 1 in the Leiden 85-plus Study; 1 in the SHIP; 6 in the Invecchiare in Chianti Study; 6 in the Rotterdam Study; 23 in the PROSPER 
Study; and 1 in the EPIC-Norfolk Study. Information on amiodarone use was not available in the Busselton Health Study.
‖A total of 7786 participants who took other medications that could alter thyroid levels (corticosteroids, amiodarone, iodine, lithium, aspirin, furosemide) were excluded for this sensitivity 
analysis: 1634 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study; 881 in the Health ABC Study; 245 in the MrPS; 251 in the Bari Study; 56 in the Leiden 85-plus Study; 299 in the SHIP; 122 in the 
Invecchiare in Chianti Study; 151 in the Rotterdam Study; 3199 in the PROSPER Study; 948 in the EPIC-Norfolk Study.
#A total of 311 participants were excluded for this analysis: 22 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study; 5 in the Leiden 85-plus Study; 1 in the Invecchiare in Chianti Study; 282 in 
the Rotterdam Study; and 1 in the Busselton Health Study had missing measurements for fT4. In participants in the Health ABC study, fT4 was measured only in participants with TSH ≥7.0 
mIU/L (therefore, no fT4 measurement in 2270 participants), and, in the PROSPER Study, fT4 was measured only in participants with TSH <0.45 mIU/L or TSH ≥4.5 mIU/L (therefore, no fT4 
measurement in 4220 participants).
**Persistent thyroid function state was defined as persistent category (euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism) from baseline to follow-up thyroid function test. Follow-up thyroid function 
was measured in the Cardiovascular Health Study, Leiden 85-plus Study, PROSPER Study, SHIP
, and the Busselton Health Study.
††The Bari and EPIC-Norfolk studies were excluded.
‡‡The Cardiovascular Health Study, MrOS Study, SHIP Study, Invecchiare in Chianti Study, and Busselton Health Study were excluded.
§§In the MrOS Study, thyroid hormones were measured an average of 3.4 years before other baseline characteristics were assessed.
‖‖SHIP includes participants from Pomerania, where an iodine supplementation began in the mid-1990s, which shifted the distribution of TSH values toward the left during the first years, 
and lowered TSH values in the population in the SHIP Study during the baseline examinations in 1997 to 2001.

(95% CI, 0.61–1.47) for a TSH level of 10.0 to 19.9 
mIU/L (Table 4). The results remained similar in sensi-
tivity analyses (Table 4 and Table VII in the online-only 
Data Supplement), and analyses stratified by sex, age, 
previous cardiovascular disease, and thyroxine use at 
baseline showed no significant interaction (Table VIII in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Adding overall rela-
tive risks (HRs not reported) of 1 study from which we 
were not able to obtain IPD9 yielded similar results for 
the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and 
AF (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.72–1.58).
fT4 Within the Reference Range and the 
Risk of AF
Crude incidence rates are shown in Figure 2. Among 
the 30 085 individuals included in our study, 20 921 
were included in the analysis of the association be-
tween fT4 and AF, having both their TSH and fT4 with-
in the reference range. In those individuals, higher fT4 
levels at baseline were associated with increased risk 
of AF in age- and sex-adjusted analyses, with a HR 
of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02–1.35) in the second quartile, 
a HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.09–1.43) in the third, and a 
HR of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.26–1.66) in the fourth quartile 
in comparison with the first (lowest) quartile of fT4 
levels (P for trend across fT4 levels ≤0.001) (Figure 2). 
When modeled as a continuous variable, increasing 
fT4 levels within the reference range were associated 
with an increased risk of AF (Figure IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). In analyses with multivariable 
adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smok-
ing, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, and prevalent 
cardiovascular disease at baseline, HRs remained simi-
lar. Further adjustments for antihypertensive medica-
tion, lipid-lowering medication, and body mass index 
did not significantly change the results. Sensitivity 
analyses yielded similar results (Table 5 and Table IX in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Risks were similar 
when all individuals regardless of thyroid medication 
use at baseline were included, or after excluding stud-
ies without AF diagnosis by ECG review,27,32 or when 
excluding a study26 that started follow-up of incident 
AF an average of 3.4 years after baseline thyroid func-
tion was measured. Estimates did not change sub-
stantially after we added the aggregate results from a 
study that did not provide IPD.24
Stratified results are presented in Figure 3 and Table 
X in the online-only Data Supplement. In comparison 
with those without known cardiovascular disease, par-
ticipants with previous cardiovascular disease showed 
no association between fT4 levels and AF risk. However, 
this finding might be affected by selection bias attribut-
able to the exclusion of participants with prevalent AF 
at baseline. Risks did not differ substantially according 
to age, sex, and race. In an additional analysis including 
thyroxine users, risks were similar irrespective of thyrox-
ine intake at baseline.
Assessment of Potential Publication Bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not suggest 
publication bias for the association between fT4 within 
the reference range and the risk of AF (Figure V in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
Our IPD analysis including 30 
085 individuals from 11 
prospective cohorts showed no association between 
TSH levels within the reference range or subclinical hy-
pothyroidism and risk of AF. In euthyroid individuals,

we found a significant increase in the risk of AF with 
increasing fT4 levels within the reference range. Risks 
did not differ significantly by age and sex.
To our knowledge, our study is the first IPD analy-
sis of prospective cohorts on the association between 
thyroid function in the reference range or subclini-
cal hypothyroidism and the risk of AF. Our study was 
strengthened by its large sample size, which allowed us 
to assess risks in subgroups by TSH levels in the normal 
range. Furthermore, our results were robust across all 
sensitivity analyses. By conducting an IPD analysis, our 
results are free of potential aggregation bias found in 
study-level meta-analyses,18 and we could explore the 
impact of age, sex, and thyroid medication in subgroup

We defined the reference range for TSH as 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L and used study-specific cutoff values for fT4; the first fT4 quar-
tile was the lowest one. The P for trend refers to a linear trend. CI indicates confidence interval; fT4, free thyroxine; and TSH,

analyses. This approach also enabled us to standardize 
definitions of predictors and outcomes, use uniform ad-
justments for potential confounders to reduce hetero-
geneity across studies, and include unpublished data to 
increase the robustness of our results and power to de-
tect associations. IPD analyses are the ideal approach to 
aggregating evidence by pooling estimates from mul-
tiple studies.19
Our study confirmed previous results from 2 recent 
prospective population-based studies that found an in-
creased risk of AF in higher fT4 levels in euthyroid in-
dividuals, whereas TSH levels were not associated with 
AF.14,24 Similar results were shown in a cross-sectional 
study that included older adults.17 Recently, a large 
Danish retrospective register study of more than half 
a million individuals found a linear increase in risk of 
incident AF with decreasing TSH levels, resulting in a 
protective effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on AF 
in comparison with the euthyroid state. Participants in 
the high-normal euthyroidism subgroup defined as TSH 
of 0.2 to 0.4 mIU/L with thyroxine levels in the refer-
ence range had a higher AF risk (incident rate ratio, 
1.12; 95% CI, 1.03–1.21) than low-normal euthyroid-
ism, defined as TSH 0.4 to 5.0 mIU/L.11 However, the 
investigators chose different TSH cutoff values than 
used in our and other studies,8,9,13,16,17 and defined the 
TSH range 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L as high-normal euthyroid-
ism (which was defined as subclinical hyperthyroidism 
in our study); strictly speaking, risk of AF within the eu-
thyroid range with a TSH of 0.4 to 5.0 mU/L has not 
been investigated. In contrast to the Danish study, we 
identified no significant association between subclini-
cal hypothyroidism with AF, but our results showed a 
similar trend across higher TSH levels. However, the 
Danish study was based on retrospective administrative 
data, which have inherent drawbacks, including poten-
tial confounding by indication (TSH was not randomly 
ordered by general practitioners) and no ECG confirma-
tion of AF. In contrast, the results of the Framingham 
Heart Study aligned with ours: no association between 
TSH levels above the reference range and the risk of AF 
was found among 5069 participants during a 10-year 
follow-up.12
Thyroxine is one of the most frequently prescribed 
drugs in the United States (almost 120 million prescrip-
tions are dispensed annually)40 and prescriptions con-
tinue to rise, even for individuals with TSH levels <10 
mIU/L.41 Although our primary analyses focused on en-
dogenous thyroid function, we also examined thyrox-
ine users in stratified analyses. These results remained 
consistent with higher AF risk with increasing fT4 levels; 
our data also showed that the majority of thyroxine us-
ers had a fT4 level in the highest quartile. However, the 
subgroup of individuals on thyroid replacement ther-
apy at baseline was comparatively small in our study 
(n=1146), which precludes a meaningful interpretation 
of the AF risk associated with thyroxine therapy. Further 
studies are needed to evaluate whether our findings 
apply to this subgroup.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not 
prespecify our analysis of the association between fT4 
and AF risk in the protocol; because 2 prospective co-
horts, published after we completed our protocol, 
found a significant association between fT4 in the eu-
thyroid range and incident AF,14,24 we decided to ex-
plore AF risk according to fT4 levels. Our robust results 
have confirmed these previous findings. Second, AF can 
be paroxysmal or asymptomatic, and the real incident 
date for AF might have been missed in the cohorts that 
diagnosed AF solely by ECG review during study visits. 
Therefore, we might have substantially underestimated 
the true incidence of AF in our study and introduced 
nondifferential misclassification of outcomes, which 
would result in an underestimation of the association. 
Third, only 5 of the included studies provided data on 
follow-up thyroid function measurements, so data on 
the evolution of thyroid function over time were limit-
ed, which applies to most published large cohorts.13,16,25 
This limitation mainly affects the analysis of individu-
als with subclinical hypothyroidism, who might reverse 
to normal thyroid function or progress to overt thyroid 
dysfunction. However, a sensitivity analysis including 
only participants with persistent thyroid function dur-
ing follow-up thyroid function measurements yielded 
similar estimates. Fourth, despite the large number of 
individuals we included in our analysis, important sub-
groups of interest (such as participants with high TSH 
levels or individuals on thyroxine therapy at baseline) 
were small, and analyses restricted to these subgroups 
were underpowered. Fifth, we could not obtain IPD 
from 2 studies that met our inclusion criteria. There-
fore, we performed sensitivity analyses adding the pub-
lished aggregate results from these 2 studies,9,24 which 
yielded similar results. We could not add the aggregate 
results of the association between TSH in the reference 
range and AF published in the study by Chaker and 
colleagues,24 because they used different TSH cutoffs 
by subdividing TSH into quartiles. Sixth, we were not 
able to include time-updated variables in our analyses 
because of limited availability. Seventh, the definition 
of some of the baseline covariates including cardiovas-
cular disease and diabetes mellitus was heterogeneous 
across different cohorts. Finally, our study included 
mainly white subjects and younger participants were 
few (median age, 69 y), which reduces the generaliz-
ability of our findings to other populations.
The mechanism for the association between thyroid 
function and AF may be explained by the effects of thy-
roid hormones on the cardiovascular system. Thyroid 
function in the high range leads to an increase in vas-
cular resistance, cardiac contractility, heart rate, and left 
ventricular mass.42 Thyroid hormone levels in the high

range have been shown to be arrhythmogenic43 and in-
crease the frequency of atrial premature beats,44 which 
in turn is a risk factor for AF.45 These effects may explain 
the observation of an increased risk of AF in subclinical 
hyperthyroidism8 but not subclinical hypothyroidism. 
Because of the negative feedback, a negative log-linear 
relationship exists between fT4 and TSH with dispro-
portionately larger changes in TSH concentrations than 
those of fT4.46 Therefore, TSH would be expected to be 
more sensitive than fT4 to predict outcomes. However, 
circulating fT4 is peripherally converted to the biologi-
cally active triiodothyronine, which binds on nuclear re-
ceptors and mediates gene expression with consecu-
tive effects on end-organs, whereas TSH is a marker of 
pituitary effects of thyroid function.47 In contrast to the 
positive association between fT4 and AF, we did not 
find an association between TSH levels in the reference 
range and AF, and this pattern of a positive associa-
tion between fT4 but not TSH values in the reference 
range has also been shown for other adverse cardiac 
outcomes including congestive heart failure14 and sud-
den cardiac death,15 and for blood pressure, as well.48 
These results of the effect of normal thyroid function 
on the heart are in contrast to the findings of a statisti-
cally significant inverse association between TSH levels 
within the reference range and dementia, whereas no 
significant association between fT4 levels in the normal 
range and rates of dementia was found in this study,14 
suggesting that thyroid hormone metabolism and ac-
tion differ between target organs such as the heart and 
brain because of differences in deiodinase activity and 
thyroid hormone receptor expression47; these differ-
ences may explain why some clinical phenotypes are 
associated with fT4 only, some with TSH only, and oth-
ers with both. These findings are also consistent with 
the observation that fT4 concentrations may differ even 
among euthyroid persons with the same TSH values49: 
individuals with higher fT4 values have higher cardiac 
exposure to thyroid hormones and are consecutively at 
a higher risk of AF, which is reflected by the findings of 
our study. Levels of fT4 might be an additive risk factor 
for adverse cardiac outcomes; however, before making 
recommendations for fT4 screening in euthyroid indi-
viduals, further (ideally, randomized) studies are needed 
to assess the benefits and harms of fT4 screening.
In conclusion, our IPD analysis of prospective cohorts 
showed that fT4 levels within the high-normal range 
were associated with increased risk of incident AF, but 
incident AF events did not increase across TSH catego-
ries within the euthyroid range or in subclinical hypo-
thyroidism. Further studies are needed to investigate 
whether these results apply to thyroxine users, which 
might entail a careful evaluation of the risks and ben-
efits of current target thyroid hormone concentrations 
for thyroid replacement therapy.
