Background: although air pollution’s short-term effects are well 
understood to be marked and preventable, its acute neuropsychologi-
cal effects have, to our knowledge, not yet been studied. We aim to 
examine the association between daily variation in traffic-related air 
pollution and attention.
Methods: We conducted a follow-up study from January 2012 to 
March 2013 in 2,687 school children from 265 classrooms in 39 
schools in Barcelona (catalonia, Spain). We assessed four domains 
of children’s attention processes every 3 months over four repeated 
visits providing a total of 10,002 computerized tests on 177 different 
days using the child attention network test (ant). ambient daily 
levels of nitrogen dioxide (nO2) and elemental carbon (ec) in par-
ticulate matter <2.5 µm (PM2.5) filters were measured at a fixed air 
quality background monitoring station and in schools.
Results: Daily ambient levels of both nO2 and ec were negatively 
associated with all attention processes (e.g., children in the bottom 
quartile of daily exposure to ambient nO2 levels had a 14.8 msecond 
[95% confidence interval, 11.2, 18.4] faster response time than those 
in the top quartile, which was equivalent to a 1.1-month [0.84, 1.37] 
retardation in the natural developmental improvement in response 
speed with age). Similar findings were observed after adjusting for the 
average indoor (classroom) levels of pollutants. associations for ec 
were similar to those for nO2 and robust to several sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: the short-term association of traffic-related air pollut-
ants with fluctuations in attention adds to the evidence that air pol-
lution may have potential harmful effects on neurodevelopment. See

U
rban air pollution is associated with acute (short-term) 
and chronic (long-term) stroke and other cardiovascular 
and respiratory effects.1–4 chronic exposure to urban air pol-
lutants have also been associated with neuropsychological and 
behavioral effects.5 in addition to vascular effects, air pollu-
tion could cause brain damage through neuroinflammation, 
glial activation, and white matter injury.6 While air pollution 
is believed to have a marked preventable acute impact in addi-
tion to chronic effects,7 its acute neuropsychological effects 
have to our knowledge not yet been studied.
We previously reported an association between long-
term exposure to traffic pollution and attention and working 
memory development in school children.8 attention processes 
fluctuate daily in response to individual characteristics (e.g., 
medications and other central nervous system stimulants like 
glucose or caffeine) and environmental or situational variables, 
such as noise, temperature, and time of day.9,10 these acute 
fluctuations may have an important impact on learning and 
academic achievement in school children by fostering inatten-
tion, forgetfulness, disorganization, and careless errors.10,11
the hypothesis that air pollution is a neurodevelopmen-
tal toxicant has not yet been properly evaluated because of the 
limitations of conducting studies in the general population (e.g., 
exposure assessment and residual confounding).12 assessment 
of acute associations is more robust to exposure misclassifica-
tion and to residual confounding than chronic associations.13 
the analysis of acute associations has the advantage that it is 
not sensitive to participants’ individual or social characteris-
tics, because these characteristics do not change over time.13

We hypothesize that daily variations on traffic pollution 
could be associated with daily fluctuations in attention, inde-
pendent of its long-term association with attention develop-
ment. thus, the aim of this study, which we have carried out 
within the context of the BreatHe (Brain Development and 
air Pollution Ultrafine Particles in School children) project, 
is to examine the daily association of traffic air pollution on 
attention among school children, and the extent to which these 
associations are independent of its chronic relationship. to 
assess the robustness of our methodology, we performed the 
same analysis using working memory as an outcome. Working 
memory, a brain system involved in maintenance and manip-
ulation of information, is more stable over time in front of 
ongoing interference from environment triggers and can serve 
as a negative control.14
METHODS
Design
We selected 40 schools in Barcelona (catalonia, Spain) 
based on modeled values of traffic-related nitrogen dioxide 
(nO2),8 and paired low- and high-nO2 schools according to 
a socioeconomic vulnerability index and type of school (i.e., 
public/private). a total of 39 schools agreed to participate and 
were included in the study. School children (n = 5,019) without 
special needs in grades 2–4 (7–10 years of age) were invited to 
participate, and the families of 2,897 (59%) children agreed. 
Participants did not differ in terms of age and sex but had a 
higher good or excellent school achievement rate (53.5% vs. 
39.3%) and a lower prevalence of criteria of attention deficit 
and hyperactivity disorder (aDHD; 8.1% vs. 11.4%). How-
ever, the participation rate was equal for high-(59.0%) and 
low-(59.2%) exposed schools. all parents or guardians signed 
the informed consent form, and the study was approved by the 
clinical research ethical committee (no. 2010/41221/i) of 
the institut Hospital del Mar d’investigacions Mèdiques–Parc 
de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Spain.
Outcomes: Attention and Working Memory
cognitive development was assessed through change in 
attention and working memory functions. We selected these 
functions because they undergo considerable development 
between the ages of 6 and 10 years8 and are strongly related to 
intelligence and learning.15 in addition to its age-related devel-
opment, attention shows daily fluctuations that allow testing 
short-term associations, in contrast to working memory that is 
more stable over short periods of time.14 Between January 2012 
and March 2013, the children were assessed in four repeat vis-
its, every 3 months, in ~40-minute sessions with computerized 
tests. the validated tests chosen were the original child atten-
tion network test (ant)16 to assess attention, and the n-back 
task17,18 to assess working memory. these tests have shown 
good discriminative ability in previous studies.15–18 among the 
ant measures, we calculated inattentiveness scores accord-
ing to the continuous performance test formulas19: hit reaction 
time, a measure of response speed; standard error of hit reaction 
time (Se of hit reaction time for correct responses), a measure 
of response speed consistency throughout the test; omissions 
rate, a measure of missed targets (i.e., stimulus without click-
ing response); and commissions rate, a measure of incorrect 
responses to nontargets. inattention is indicated by higher 
values of hit reaction time and Se of hit reaction time, and by 
higher numbers of omissions and commissions.19 reaction time 
measures were calculated using reaction times associated with 
a correct response in 128 trials. reaction times shorter than 100 
msecond (5.80%) in each trial were excluded from reaction 
time calculations because of their physiological implausibil-
ity, implying that these responses are perseverative or anticipa-
tory.19 We excluded data from children with >30% errors in any 
visit from the analysis (1.4%) due to poor performance of the 
test because of uncontrolled factors.16 For the n-back task, we 
examined response to numbers and words stimuli challenged 
in the two-back preceding loads. We analyzed the d prime (d′) 
n-back parameter, a measure of detection obtained by subtract-
ing the normalized false alarm rate from the hit rate [(Zhit rate 
− Zfalse alarm rate) × 100]. Higher d′ values indicate more accurate 
test performance. We report results for two-back numbers but 
the findings were similar for three-back parameters (http://links.
lww.com/eDe/B143). tasks were created using the psychology 
experiment computer program e-Prime version 2.0 (Psychol-
ogy Software tools inc., Sharpsburg, Pa), and were performed 
on laptops with standard 15ʺ screens.
Traffic-related Air Pollution
We measured short-term exposures based on the daily 
ambient levels of nO2 (real-time chemiluminescence using 
model Sir-5012) and elemental carbon (ec) measured using 
particulate matter <2.5 µm (PM2.5) filters (high volume sam-
ples, quartz microfiber filters for sampling, and the thermo 
optical method for ec determinations); measures were taken 
at a fixed air quality background monitoring station in Bar-
celona (Palau reial air quality monitoring station; Figure 1) 
operating continuously throughout the year, as detailed else-
where.20,21 Daily values refer to the 09:00- to 17:00-hour 
period. in addition, we measured long-term school exposure 
based on average indoor pollution levels in classrooms, using 
direct measurements conducted in schools in days not coin-
ciding with the outcome assessment that cover the entire year 
2012. We measured each pair of schools simultaneously dur-
ing four complete days (from Monday to Friday) on two occa-
sions 6 months apart, during the warm and cold periods of 
the year 2012. We measured indoor air in a single classroom 
and outdoor air in the courtyard simultaneously. We measured 
the following pollutants during class time in schools: 4-day 
nO2, measured using one passive tube (gradko), and ec in 
PM2.5 filters measured daily for 8 hours (09:00 to 17:00) on 
each of the 4 days of the two campaigns using the same pro-
tocol as for the reference site, described above. Using data on 
classroom floor level, orientation (toward indoor area, outdoor

playground, or directly onto the street), outdoor pollutant lev-
els, and seasonal and meteorologic parameters such as daily 
temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, we modeled aver-
age concentrations of nO2 and ec for each classroom (eap-
pendix; http://links.lww.com/eDe/B143). Modeled levels of 
nO2 had very good validity (correlation coefficient r = 0.94) 
with respect to a subset (n = 19) of nO2 measurements con-
ducted in the different classrooms of six schools at the same 
time. levels of elemental carbon in PM2.5 filters showed a 
high correlation with black carbon measured with aethalom-
eters (r = 0.95) in the BreatHe study.8
Temporal, Contextual, and Individual 
Covariates
We obtained data on daily average temperature and 
humidity between 09.00 and 17.00 hours from the Faculty of 
Physics of the University of Barcelona. Sociodemographic 
status was expressed as a neighborhood socioeconomic vul-
nerability index (based on level of education, unemployment, 
and occupation at the level of census tract, the smallest spa-
tial census unit, with a median area of 0.08 km2) based on 
the home address.22 Parental educational level was measured 
using the BreatHe questionnaire. Symptoms of aDHD 
(aDHD/DSM-iV Scales)23 were reported by teachers. Parents 
completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) 
on child behavioral problems.24 long-term exposure to nO2 
and ec (PM2.5 absorbance) at home at the time of the study 
was estimated at the geocoded postal address of each partici-
pant using land use regression models, details of which are 
provided elsewhere.25 long-term exposure to school noise 
was measured directly as described elsewhere,8 and classroom 
noise was modeled according to the same procedure as for 
nO2, explained above. characteristics of individuals and con-
textual variables were described elsewhere.8
Statistical Analysis
From the 2,897 children, a total of 2,687 children were 
included in this study. One hundred ten (3.8%) children 
were excluded because of lack of complete data with which 
to model classroom air pollution levels. these 110 children 
belong to three out of the 268 classrooms. the rest of excluded 
children (n = 100) lack data on age, maternal education, and 
home address. there were no difference between included 
and excluded children with respect to outcomes, exposures, 
and key covariates. We fit linear mixed effects models to test 
for associations between daily levels of pollutants and the

quantitative outcomes at each visit (such as hit reaction time 
and Se of hit reaction time, and working memory), and nega-
tive binomial mixed regression models to test for associations 
with semiquantitative outcomes, such as omissions and com-
missions rate. the child and school variables were included as 
random effects in the models. From the 2,687 children, only 
2,086 (77.6%) did the four visits. the use of mixed models 
allowed handling the missing visits without excluding any 
child. to evaluate acute effects, models were adjusted for the 
following temporal variables: a cubic spline for daily tempera-
ture, daily relative humidity, season (cold, warm), day of the 
week, period (first or second school year of the study), and 
time of the day when the cognitive assessment was conducted. 
We selected three lag periods based on the a priori assumption 
that the effect could have very short lead time (hours): the cur-
rent day of the exam (lag 0), the day before (lag 1), and the two 
days before (lag 2). Under this assumption, and considering 
that most exams were performed in the morning (76%), lag 
1 is the variable that best reflects immediate exposure before 
the exam. indoor levels of pollutants in classrooms were used 
to evaluate long-term associations, because all children had 
been in the same classroom for >3 months before the start of 
the study. to adjust the daily associations for chronic effects, 
we included classroom pollutant levels in the previous mod-
els together with variables previously selected8 for assessing 
chronic associations: child’s age and sex, maternal educational 
level, socioeconomic status of the residential neighborhood, 
and air pollution at home. Models were further adjusted for 
long-term exposure to school noise. as mentioned elsewhere,8 
sensitivity analysis including any of the variables in table 1 in 
the multivariate models did not change the results. to assess 
the natural developmental improvement in attention param-
eters with age, we fit the models including only child’s age.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. We stratified 
our analyses by sex, maternal educational level, aDHD symp-
toms, season, and noise to assess effect modification. Pure 
within-subject effects were reassessed by including the indi-
vidual as a fixed instead of a random effect. temporal trends 
were further adjusted using semiparametric methods.26 Finally, 
analyses with lag-1 and lag-2 days (i.e., with effects preceding 
the exposure) was conducted. Statistical significance was set 
at P < 0.05, and all statistical analyses were carried out using 
Stata 12.1 (Stata corporation, college Station, tX).
RESULTS
the 2,687 children provided 10,002 valid tests on 177 
different days between January 2012 and March 2013. char-
acteristics of the children are shown in table 1. the proportion 
of girls was 50%, 59% had a mother with university degree, 
10% had a father who was unemployed, 28% were overweight 
or obese, and 15% were born out of country. Home SeS vul-
nerability index mean was 1.45 (SD = 0.21), mean greenness 
(in terms of normalized difference vegetation index) was 0.20 
(SD = 0.08), mean distance from home to school was1733 m 
(SD = 2381), and mean behavioral problems score was 8.4 
(SD = 5.2). table 2 shows the results of a descriptive analysis 
of attention and working memory, daily ambient levels of nO2 
and ec, and average indoor levels of nO2 and ec measured in 
classrooms during the study. We observed higher interindivid-
ual than intraindividual variability in cognitive function, for 
example, the interindividual variability of hit reaction times 
(SD) was 163 and the intraindividual variability was 94, and 
the variability of the intraindividual variability was 51. the 
distribution of omission errors and especially of commission 
errors was non-normal.
the ambient levels of nO2 and ec had a higher mean 
than indoor school levels (table 2). nO2 ambient levels were 
higher than average indoor school levels throughout the distri-
bution. the bottom quartile of indoor levels of ec was higher 
than that of ambient levels, whereas the top quartile of daily 
ambient levels of ec was higher than that of indoor levels. 
the seasonal distributions of daily levels of both pollutants 
were very similar (Figure 2).
attention parameters were moderately correlated 
with working memory while there were strong correlations 
between measurements of inattention, except for commission 
errors (table 3, outcomes). Daily ambient levels of air pol-
lutants were not correlated with their average indoor levels 
(i.e., we found no relationship between short- and long-term 
air pollution). there was a strong correlation between nO2 
and ec, for both daily ambient (r = 0.50) and indoor levels (r 
= 0.76; table 3, exposures). in contrast, correlations between 
either average indoor nO2 or ec and average indoor noise 
levels were weaker (r < 0.45). in addition, we found a correla-
tion between daily ambient and daily indoor levels of ec (r = 
0.49, 95% ci, 0.36, 0.61). Short-term nO2 and short-term ec 
concentrations were unrelated to children’s characteristics and

modestly related to relative humidity (r = 0.14 and r = 0.39, 
for nO2 and ec, respectively), season and day of the week; 
however, long-term nO2 and ec were related to education and 
socioeconomic status (etable 1; http://links.lww.com/eDe/
B143).
Daily ambient levels of both nO2 and ec were associ-
ated with impaired attention function (i.e., increased hit reac-
tion time, Se of hit reaction time, omissions, and commissions; 
table 4). thus, an interquartile increase (a difference between 
25th and 75th percentile) in daily levels of nO2 was associated 
with a 14.8 (95% ci, 11.2, 18.4) msecond increase in hit reac-
tion time or a 7% (95% ci, 3%, 12%) higher number of miss-
ing answers (omissions). this increase was equivalent to a 
1.1-month (0.84, 1.37) retardation in the natural developmen-
tal improvement in response speed with age (normally 13.4 
msecond per month). Similarly, age development of Se of hit 
reaction time was retarded by 1.45 months (0.78, 2.12) and 
omissions by 0.82 months (0.32, 1.32) for nO2. We obtained 
similar findings after adjusting for the long-term exposure 
(i.e., average indoor levels of pollutants in the classroom), 
which indicates that daily variations in ambient levels of pol-
lutants have a short-term association with outcomes, indepen-
dent of the average level of pollution in the school. thus, an 
interquartile increase in daily ambient levels of nO2 resulted 
in a 9.90-msecond increase in hit reaction time, independent 
of average indoor levels in the classroom. We did not find any 
short-term association with relative humidity. We controlled 
for potential confounding by complex relationships between 
neurodevelopment and temperature by adjusting for cubic 
splines of temperature. We did not observe short-term associa-
tions with working memory. in contrast, long-term exposure 
to indoor nO2 was associated with impaired attention pro-
cesses (hit reaction time, Se of hit reaction time, and omis-
sion errors) and working memory (table 4, etable 2; http://
links.lww.com/eDe/B143). these chronic associations did 
not change after adjusting for the acute relationship, except 
for the association between working memory and ec, which 
became stronger. this result also did not change after adjust-
ing for classroom noise.
Figure 3 shows the acute associations of ambient nO2 
with Se of hit reaction time and omission errors for each of the 
different lags, with and without adjustment for average indoor 
pollutant levels. We observed the strongest association for the 
lag 1 period, as well as for hit reaction time and commission 
errors (eFigure 1; http://links.lww.com/eDe/B143). this fig-
ure also depicts a stronger association with long-term exposure 
than with short-term exposure. We observed similar patterns 
for ec, with the strongest association for the lag 1 period.
the results did not change notably using alternative sta-
tistical modeling (etable 3; http://links.lww.com/eDe/B143), or

DISCUSSION
Daily variations in attention processes were associated 
with daily levels of traffic-related ambient air pollution, and 
this acute association was independent of the average level 
of pollution in the classroom. in addition to other factors pre-
viously reported as being related to short-term fluctuations, 
such as individual characteristics and environmental or con-
textual variables (e.g., temperature, time of day),9,10 urban air 
pollution levels also appear to trigger daily variation in atten-
tion. children’s performance was slower and less consistent 
throughout the test on days with higher levels of ambient 
traffic-related air pollution. the size of the estimated effect 
was modest (around 1 month in age-related development of 
attention); however, common exposures with small effects on 
cognitive function have an important population impact, as 
has been shown for lead.27 in contrast to attention, fluctua-
tions in working memory were not associated with daily lev-
els of ambient air pollution, even though we observed chronic 
associations of air pollution with the development of working 
memory in a previous study.8 Our results are consistent with 
several studies that highlight the contribution of the central 
executive component of the working memory system in resist-
ing interference by inhibiting distracters.15,28,29
We found that both nO2 and ec had acute associations 
with inattentiveness. We selected ec and nO2 as indicators 
of traffic pollution because of their link with vehicle exhaust 
emissions in the city of Barcelona.30 Based on observed brain 
damage in animal experiments,31–34 diesel pollutants are 
thought to be the most important inhaled neurotoxicants. as 
do many european cities, Barcelona has a diesel-dominated 
vehicle fleet (with very high nO2 and ec emissions, which 
are responsible for the majority of these pollutants in the city 
air).30,35 We did not aim to identify the specific neurotoxic

agents that are directly responsible for neuronal damage, or 
to disentangle which of the different agents in the mixture of 
traffic-related air pollutants causes the observed associations 
on attentiveness, but rather used a measure that is globally 
representative of exposure to traffic pollution. two recent 
studies in rats exposed to nO2 that observed clear evidence 
of brain damage,36,37 particularly neuron mitochondrial dys-
function,36 raises the possibility of a specific neurotoxicity of 
nO2. However, these experimental studies used high doses 
compared with real life.
the acute association of air pollution with attention 
probably arises through the same mechanism as the long-term 
association, as do for the cardiovascular effects of air pollu-
tion.7 there is evidence that short-term ambient PM exposure 
can be associated with day-to-day elevations in circulating 
proinflammatory biomarkers, endothelial cell activation, vas-
cular endothelial dysfunction, blood coagulation, blood pres-
sure, or altered heart variability.38 Several of these effects are 
related to an autonomic nervous system imbalance. Whether 
this reaction occurred because of a generalized oxidative 
stress response, as a consequence of specific soluble PM 
constituents directly altering central nervous system activ-
ity, or via altered reflex with lung nerve receptors, remains 
unknown.38 the most commonly reported brain effects involve 
microglia stimulation and altered innate immune response 
and inflammation, and synapse disruption, including dopa-
mine dysfunction, following exposure to diesel exhaust.6,39 
Dopamine function after a stimulant medication affects the 
attention variability in the short term.40 Similarly, the short-
term effects of air pollution on attention could be mediated 
by the catecholaminergic system, although how dopamine is 
acutely affected by PM exposure is unknown. interestingly, 
a unifying mechanism through which central dopaminergic 
influences might simultaneously affect vascular, neuronal, and 
behavioral domains has been proposed.41 there are currently 
no data on the time lapse between exposure and the onset of 
symptoms,7 although our observation of a lower association 
for 2 days’ lag than for 1 day’s suggests that this time lapse 
may be just a few hours. note than in our study, 1-day lag is 
the period that best represents the period before the computer 
tests for both nO2 and ec.
a secondary finding in this study is the additional chronic 
association observed by modeling classroom levels, in contrast 
to our previous study in which we only assessed indoor level in 
a single classroom per school.8 thus, we have extended the 39 
different school pollution exposure contrasts to 265 classroom 
levels, which reduces the risk of confounding school and par-
ticipant characteristics by chronic associations, given the use 
of different classrooms within the same schools. interestingly, 
we observed stronger associations than in our previous study,8 
which suggests that any residual confounding in our previous 
study would lead to an underestimation of associations (e.g., 
increase in the association between nO2 and Se of hit reaction 
time from 7.0 msecond [−1.0, 16] to 9.8 msecond [3.4, 16]).
a major shortcoming of observational studies assessing 
long-term associations is the potential for residual confounding 
by social class. Our study is unlikely to be affected by residual 
confounding because temporal variations in daily air pollution 
levels were analyzed within the same individuals. thus, the 
acute association of air pollution was independent of individual 
and school characteristics, and could only be affected by daily 
variations in other variables such as temperature or season, 
which were included in our models. in addition, a better appre-
ciation of attention fluctuations and their modulating factors 
such as traffic pollution may provide a more comprehensive 
understanding of the nature of inattentive classroom behavior. 
While fluctuations in performance and difficulties in focusing 
attention are widely known to be greater and more common 
in children with aDHD symptoms,10,42 we found that traffic 
pollution is negatively associated with variability of attention 
irrespective of the presence or absence of this syndrome.
a potential limitation of this study is the lack of daily 
information on noise, which could be a source of confound-
ing. We were unable to measure daily variation in classroom 
ventilation, which could also affect neuropsychological per-
formance,43 although adjusting for seasonal and environmental 
temperature makes a confounding effect unlikely. Furthermore, 
we did not find differences in the infiltration of nO2 and ec 
between the warm and cold seasons in the BreatHe study44 
which suggests small temporal variations in ventilation. More-
over, daily levels of air pollution on the days of the computer 
test were obtained from a reference station and not directly 
from the school, so the temporal associations are unlikely to 
be biased, as shown elsewhere.13 in fact, we found that there 
was a good correlation between ambient levels of ec at the 
reference site and indoor levels at the schools on the same days 
(r = 0.49). Finally, the participation rate was unrelated to the 
exposure, which suggests a lack of potential selection bias.
Overall, the short-term association of traffic-related air 
pollutants with attention fluctuations adds to the evidence that air 
pollution may have potential harmful effects on neurodevelop-
ment. Our study suggests that, if shown to be a causal relation-
ship, traffic pollution, and in particular diesel emissions addressed 
here by measuring nO2 and ec, could affect the cognitive perfor-
mance of school children while at the school. attention is a key 
cognitive function for school success and for avoiding social and 
behavioral problems,11 which highlights the importance for pub-
lic health of the acute associations we observed of traffic-related 
air pollutants with fluctuations in attention.
