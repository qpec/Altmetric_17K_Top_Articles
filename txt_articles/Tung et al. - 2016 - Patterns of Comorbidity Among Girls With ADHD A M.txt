abstract
CONTEXT: Although children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at 
elevated risk for comorbid psychopathology, the clinical correlates of ADHD in girls are far 
less understood relative to boys, despite ADHD being one of the most common childhood 
disorders in girls.
OBJECTIVE: To meta-analytically summarize rates of comorbid internalizing (anxiety, 
depression) and externalizing (oppositional defiant disorder [ODD], conduct disorder [CD]) 
psychopathology among girls with and without ADHD.
DATA SOURCES: Literature searches (PubMed, Google Scholar) identified published studies 
examining comorbid psychopathology in girls with and without ADHD.
STUDY SELECTION: Eighteen studies (1997 participants) met inclusion criteria and had sufficient 
data for the meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION: Odds ratios for each comorbid disorder were calculated from available 
data. Demographic (eg, age, race/ethnicity) and study characteristics (eg, referral source, 
diagnostic method) were also coded.
RESULTS: Compared with girls without ADHD, girls with ADHD were significantly more likely 
to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for each 
comorbid disorder assessed. Relative odds were higher for externalizing (ODD: 5.6×; CD: 
9.4×) relative to internalizing disorders (anxiety: 3.2×; depression: 4.2×). Meta-regression 
revealed larger effect sizes of ADHD on anxiety for studies using multiple diagnostic 
methods, featuring younger children, and including clinic-referred (versus community-
referred) girls; the effect of ADHD on ODD varied based on diagnostic informant.
LIMITATIONS: Findings were derived from cross-sectional studies, precluding causal inferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Girls with ADHD frequently exhibit comorbid externalizing and internalizing 
disorders. We discuss future research priorities and consider intervention implications for 
ADHD and comorbid psychopathology in girls.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, 
childhood-onset neurobehavioral 
disorder with considerable public 
health and financial consequences. 
1, 
 
2 
Although ADHD is 2 to 3 times 
more prevalent in boys than in 
girls, 
 
3 greater understanding of the 
clinical presentation of ADHD in 
girls is needed. Approximately 5.6% 
of girls are diagnosed with ADHD 
in childhood, making it among the 
most prevalent psychiatric disorders 
in girls. 
1, 
2 Similar to boys, ADHD 
symptoms in girls frequently persist 
into adolescence and adulthood, 
predicting poor mental health, 
academic, and social outcomes. 
4 
 
 
–8 
Some studies suggest that boys 
and girls with ADHD are similarly 
impaired, 
 
9 whereas other studies 
suggest that ADHD is more impairing 
for girls (eg, peer problems) 
10 despite 
being less prevalent. This “gender 
paradox” is evident across social, 
academic, and familial domains, 
which may reflect gender-atypical 
behavior and marginalization of girls 
with ADHD. 
11 
–13
ADHD frequently co-occurs with 
oppositional defiant disorder 
(ODD), conduct disorder (CD), 
anxiety disorders (eg, generalized 
anxiety disorder, social anxiety), 
and depressive disorders (eg, major 
depression). 
14 
 
– 
17 However, most 
studies of ADHD and comorbid 
psychopathology have relied on 
predominantly male samples. A 
meta-analysis of 21 mixed-gender 
population studies (published 
between 1987 and 1999) found 
that children with ADHD were over 
10 times more likely to have CD 
or ODD, whereas they were over 5 
times more likely to have depression 
and 3 times more likely to have 
an anxiety disorder compared 
with peers without ADHD.18 Thus, 
studies including boys with ADHD 
have typically focused on comorbid 
externalizing disorders, such as 
CD and ODD. In contrast, perhaps 
because girls overall have higher 
rates of internalizing (eg, anxiety, 
depression) versus externalizing 
disorders, 
 
3, 
 
19, 
 
20 many previous 
studies have somewhat narrowly 
emphasized the association between 
ADHD and internalizing problems 
in girls. Indeed, longitudinal studies 
show that girls with ADHD often 
experience internalizing problems, 
 
21, 
22 
and children with ADHD and 
comorbid depressive and/or anxiety 
disorders exhibit worse outcomes 
than youth with 1 disorder. 
23 At 
the same time, however, girls with 
ADHD show increased ODD, CD, and 
aggression as well, which uniquely 
predicts severe adult impairments, 
such as risky sexual behavior, 
involvement in abusive relationships, 
and criminality. 
22, 
 
24 
–26 Given that 
internalizing and externalizing 
psychopathology may differentially 
predict long-term outcomes for 
girls, clarifying early patterns of 
comorbidity in girls with ADHD is 
imperative to understanding the 
impact of childhood ADHD on adult 
outcomes.
To inform the clinical significance 
of ADHD in girls, comorbid 
psychopathology must be adequately 
characterized. Most research on 
girls with ADHD has compared girls 
(the minority group) to boys (the 
majority group), rather than directly 
comparing girls with versus without 
ADHD. The lack of gender-matched 
comparison groups potentially 
confounds true gender differences in 
the association between ADHD and 
comorbid disorders, which could 
also simply reflect gender differences 
in rates of psychopathology 
regardless of ADHD. Girls overall 
have higher rates of internalizing 
versus externalizing disorders, but 
it is unclear if ADHD affects these 
patterns; clarifying this is important 
for several reasons. First, because 
of the perception that internalizing 
problems are more relevant than 
externalizing problems for girls with 
ADHD, treatment of internalizing 
symptoms is often prioritized 
(eg, antidepressants), even when 
externalizing symptoms are present 
and impairing. 
27 Such treatment 
practices assume that ADHD in girls 
confers more risk for internalizing 
than externalizing symptoms. 
Importantly, results from previous 
studies of girls with versus without 
ADHD are mixed, with evidence that 
ADHD may be particularly predictive 
of anxiety and depression in girls 
28, 
 
29; 
alternatively, other studies suggest 
that ADHD poses a higher risk for 
externalizing disorders and that 
girls with ADHD have higher rates 
of internalizing symptoms than boys 
simply due to the main effect of 
gender. 
30 Similar to ADHD symptoms, 
externalizing behaviors in girls 
may reflect the gender paradox: 
despite its lower prevalence in girls 
compared with boys, externalizing 
symptoms are more impairing and 
produce worse outcomes for girls, 
underscoring the clinical significance 
of comorbid externalizing symptoms. 
Overall, these data suggest that 
narrowly focusing on internalizing 
disorders among girls with ADHD 
may undermine timely detection and 
treatment of externalizing problems 
in girls. Clarifying the relative effect 
of ADHD on comorbid externalizing 
versus internalizing disorders for 
girls requires direct comparison of 
girls with and without ADHD, the 
primary goal of this meta-analysis.
Given the increasing number of 
studies consisting of girls with and 
without ADHD, 
 
24, 
 
31 meta-analysis of 
comorbidity among girls with ADHD 
is timely. Thus, this meta-analysis 
characterized patterns of comorbid 
anxiety, depression, ODD, and CD 
among girls with versus without 
ADHD and also examined potential 
moderators of comorbidity patterns. 
Group differences in comorbidity 
rates may be sensitive to diagnostic 
procedures (eg, interview versus 
rating scale), sample characteristics 
(eg, age, race/ethnicity), and referral 
sources (eg, clinic-referred versus 
community-referred). 
32 For instance,

clinic-referred samples typically 
exhibit elevated rates of comorbidity. 
Because girls with ADHD are often 
underreferred relative to boys, clinic-
referred girls may be particularly 
impaired compared with nonreferred 
girls. Participant age is also 
relevant given that rates of lifetime 
ADHD increase from preschool to 
adolescence. 
33 Similarly, ADHD is 
most prevalent in non-Hispanic 
white children and adolescents.1 
Given these divergent patterns of 
association, a secondary goal of 
this meta-analysis is to examine 
study characteristics that may affect 
estimates of comorbidity among girls 
with ADHD.
METHODS
Search Procedure
Potential studies were identified 
using separate searches for each 
comorbid disorder (ODD, CD, 
anxiety, depression) in PubMed and 
Google Scholar. PubMed searches 
targeted studies with ADHD and 
each comorbid disorder in the 
title or abstract. For example, the 
search terms for ODD were: (ADHD 
OR attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder[Title/Abstract]) AND 
(ODD OR oppositional defiant 
disorder[title/abstract]). Additional 
PubMed filters were activated based 
on eligibility criteria: “Article types: 
Clinical Trial, Controlled Clinical 
Trial, Journal Article, Randomized 
Controlled Trial, Validation Studies; 
Publication dates From 1980/01/01; 
Species: Humans; Language: English; 
Sex: Female; Ages: Child: birth–18 
years, Adolescent: 13–18 years, Child: 
6–12 years.” Similarly, Google Scholar 
searches targeted studies published 
after 1980 that included ADHD and 
the comorbid disorder in the title. 
Sample search terms for ODD were: 
allintitle: (“Oppositional Defiant 
Disorder” OR ODD) (ADHD OR ADD 
OR “attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder”). The final search was 
completed in August 2014.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
 
Figure 1 shows the number of 
citations for each disorder yielded 
by the initial search as well as the 
study selection process. Following 
expert recommendations, 4 coders 
(I.T., J.I.M., K.L.J., and J.S.K.) screened 
these citations based on their titles 
and abstracts. 
34 After reducing the 
number of studies based on broad 
exclusionary criteria and removing 
duplicates, 124 unique samples were 
identified and independently coded 
by 2 extensively trained bachelor-
level coders (P.G.H. and P.M.O.) 
who were highly reliable (average 
κ = 0.84). Both in the screening and 
coding stages, coders met weekly 
with a doctoral-level supervisor (J.J.L. 
and/or I.T.) to resolve discrepancies. 
During this time, samples were 
additionally evaluated according 
to the inclusion criteria listed in 
 
Fig 1. To maximize validity, studies 
were required to assess ADHD and 
comorbid disorders using Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM)-based measures. 
Studies that produced diagnostic 
categories or could reasonably be 
recoded into diagnostic groups 
were considered. For studies that 
described comorbidity dimensionally 
using DSM-based measures (n = 17), 
we contacted authors to request raw 
data to create diagnostic groups. 
Given the significant variability in 
the number and types of anxiety 
disorders assessed, we included 
studies that assessed at least 1 
DSM-based anxiety disorder. For 
depression, we focused on studies 
that assessed major depression, 
but we also included studies based 
on “any depressive disorder” (eg, 
including dysthymia) if depressive 
disorders were not reported 
separately.
These procedures produced 39 
unique samples that were then coded 
for the following information: (1) 
number of girls with and without 
ADHD and (2) number of girls with 
ODD, CD, any anxiety disorder, and 
depression (separately) for the ADHD 
and non-ADHD groups. For the 3 
longitudinal studies, variables were 
coded from the first available data 
point. Finally, because few studies 
exclusively focused on girls with 
ADHD, most studies (n = 34) did 
not directly report diagnostic rates 
separately for girls with and without 
ADHD. Thus, we contacted authors to 
request those data. Eighteen unique

studies had sufficient data for the 
final analyses.
Moderator Variables
To explore potential moderators 
of the association between ADHD 
and each comorbid disorder, key 
demographic and methodological 
characteristics were coded for 
each study. Demographic factors 
included: (1) participant age range 
(child, adolescent, both) and (2) 
racial/ethnic composition (% white). 
Methodological variables included: 
(1) sample source (clinic-referred, 
community-referred, both), (2) 
medication status (% medicated), 
(3) ADHD subtypes included (any 
subtype, combined only), (4) 
informant for ADHD and comorbid 
disorders (parent, child, teacher), and 
(5) assessment method for ADHD 
and comorbid disorders (interview, 
rating scale). Finally, publication year 
(eg, 2003) was included as a potential 
moderator.
Calculation of Effect Sizes
Odds ratios (OR) were calculated 
from data extracted from 
publications or from data provided 
by study authors. We estimated 
4 separate effect sizes of the 
association between ADHD (versus 
non-ADHD) and the following 
dichotomously measured disorders: 
(1) ODD, (2) CD, (3), any anxiety 
disorder, and (4) depression. For 
example, to estimate the OR for 
ADHD versus non-ADHD for ODD, we 
used the formula (a + d)/(b + c), 
in which a = the number of girls with 
ADHD and ODD, b = the number of 
ADHD girls without ODD, c = the 
number of non-ADHD girls with 
ODD, and d = the number of non-
ADHD girls without ODD. When cell 
frequencies equaled 0, we added 0.5 
to each of the 4 cells to calculate the 
effect size. 
34
Statistical Analyses
We employed a random-effects 
model to estimate the OR, its 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and its 
significance. Publication bias was 
evaluated through visual inspection 
of Begg’s funnel plot, 
 
35 which plots 
each effect size with its SE, 
 
35 as 
well as using Egger’s test for funnel 
plot asymmetry, where significant 
asymmetry indicates potential 
publication bias. 
36 To adjust for 
bias, we implemented Duval and 
Tweedie’s “trim and fill” method, 
 
37 
a widely used method of addressing 
publication bias by first “trimming” 
(removing) studies causing the 
funnel plot asymmetry and using 
the trimmed funnel plot to estimate 
the true funnel “center, 
” then “filling 
in” the funnel by replacing the 
removed studies and their reflected 
counterparts around the center 
to produce a new pooled estimate 
based on the adjusted funnel plot. 
Simulation studies suggest that this 
method improves effect size CIs and 
detects how much point estimates 
may change as a result of potentially 
missing studies.38 Heterogeneity 
in effect sizes was estimated using 
the Cochran Q test; for outcomes 
with significant heterogeneity, we 
tested moderation separately for 
each demographic or methodological 
factor. All data were analyzed in 
Stata, version 12 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX) by using the meta, 
metarim, and metareg commands.
RESULTS
The final analyses included 1997 
participants across 18 independent 
studies, 
 
10, 
 
28, 
 
39 
 
 
 
 
– 
47 described in  
Table 1. 
Although the initial search included 
studies published since 1980, all of 
the final 18 studies were published 
in or after 1999, with 12 studies 
published since 2005. Sample sizes 
varied (mean n = 100 girls total) 
with studies being more likely to 
include whites (mean, 77% white) 
and school-aged girls (mean age 
range, 8.5–13.5 years). Of the 18 
studies, 11 included community- 
and clinic-referred participants, 
6 used community-referred samples, 
and 1 exclusively featured clinic-
referred youth. Most studies (n = 14) 
included any ADHD subtype in the 
ADHD group, and diagnoses were 
typically based on a diagnostic 
interview (n = 10) or a combination 
of interview and rating scale 
(n = 4). All studies used parents 
as informants, although some 
combined parent and child (n = 5) or 
parent and teacher report (n = 4) to 
establish diagnostic status. Fifteen 
studies used computerized and 
comprehensive structured diagnostic 
interviews (ie, Diagnostic Interview 
Schedule for Children, Kiddie 
Schedule for Affective Disorders 
and Schizophrenia for School-Age 
Children, Diagnostic Interview 
for Children and Adolescents-IV) 
and 3 studies used standardized 
rating scales (ie, Swanson, Nolan 
and Pelham Parent and Teacher 
Rating Scales or ADHD Rating Scale 
IV) to diagnose DSM-IV ADHD. In 
addition to construct validity based 
on DSM symptoms, these widely 
used diagnostic tools also have 
superior psychometric properties, 
including test–retest reliability and 
convergent validity. 
48 
–50 Thus, the 
studies included in the meta-analysis 
employed rigorous diagnostic 
procedures to ascertain ADHD.
ADHD and ODD
All 18 studies (n = 1997 participants) 
were included in this analysis. 
Among girls with ADHD, 42% were 
diagnosed with ODD relative to 5% 
of girls without ADHD. The initial 
pooled random effects OR estimated 
that girls with ADHD were >11 times 
more likely to have ODD than girls 
without ADHD ( 
Fig 2). However, 
potential publication bias was 
indicated by Egger’s test (t = 2.65, 
P = .02) and marginally by Begg’s test 
(τ = 51, P = .06); the Begg’s funnel 
plot suggested that smaller studies 
were more likely to yield larger ORs 
for ODD than larger studies. After 
adjusting for potential bias using the

trim and fill method, the re-estimated 
effect indicated that girls with 
ADHD were 5.6 times more likely to 
be diagnosed with ODD than girls 
without ADHD.
Given significant heterogeneity 
in effect sizes for ODD (Q = 41.51, 
df = 17, P < .01), we employed 
meta-regression to test potential 
moderators of heterogeneous effect 
sizes (Supplemental Table 2). Age, 
race, sample source, medication 
status, ADHD subtypes, assessment 
method, and publication year did not 
influence the association between 
ADHD and comorbid ODD. Only 
informant (parent, child, teacher) 
significantly moderated the effect; 
relative to parent-report only, studies 
that combined parent and child 
ratings for ADHD and ODD produced 
smaller effect sizes. However, there 
were no significant differences 
between parent-report only versus 
combined parent- and teacher-report.
ADHD and CD
Fifteen studies were included in the 
meta-analysis of ADHD and CD. A 
total of 12.8% of girls with ADHD 
were diagnosed with CD relative to 
0.8% of girls without ADHD. The 
pooled effect revealed that girls 
with ADHD were >9 times more 
likely to be diagnosed with CD than 
girls without ADHD ( 
Fig 3). Egger’s 
(t = –0.28, P = .79) and Begg’s test 
(τ = –31, P = .14) did not suggest 
publication bias, and there was no 
evidence of significant heterogeneity 
(Q = 8.01, df = 14, P = .89).
ADHD and Anxiety
Eleven studies were included in the 
meta-analysis of ADHD and anxiety 
disorders. Compared with 13.9% of 
girls without ADHD, 37.7% of girls 
with ADHD met diagnostic criteria for 
an anxiety disorder. Girls with ADHD 
were 3.66 times more likely to meet 
criteria for an anxiety disorder than 
girls without ADHD ( 
Fig 4). Begg’s 
test (τ = 17, P = .21) did not suggest 
potential publication bias, although 
Egger’s test was marginal (t = 1.82, 
P = .10). Visual examination of Begg’s 
test suggested that smaller studies 
may be slightly more likely to report 
larger effects. After adjusting for 
potential bias using the trim and fill 
method, the effect size for comorbid 
anxiety (OR = 3.19) was relatively 
similar.
Given evidence of significant 
heterogeneity (Q = 22.46, df = 10, 
P < .01), we employed meta-regression 
to examine potential moderators 
(Supplemental Table 3). Effect 
sizes were smaller for studies that 
included adolescents (versus children 
aged <13 years), and the association 
between ADHD and anxiety was 
larger in samples with clinic-referred 
girls (versus community-referred). 
Finally, multimethod assessments of 
ADHD (interview and rating scale) 
produced higher rates of comorbid 
anxiety compared with interview-
only assessments. Participant race, 
medication status, ADHD subtypes,

ADHD and Depression
Twelve studies were included in the 
meta-analysis of ADHD and comorbid 
depression. A total of 10.3% of girls 
with ADHD were diagnosed with 
depression relative to 2.9% of non-
ADHD girls. Girls with ADHD were 
>4 times more likely to be diagnosed 
with depression than non-ADHD 
girls ( 
Fig 5). Although Begg’s test for 
publication bias was not significant 
(τ = –10, P = .54), Egger’s test 
marginally suggested bias (t = –2.03, 
P = .07); examination of Begg’s funnel 
plot suggested that smaller studies 
tended to report smaller effect 
sizes for depression. There was no 
evidence of significant heterogeneity 
(Q = 15.05, df = 11, P < .18).
DISCUSSION
Across 18 studies, girls with 
ADHD were significantly more 
likely to meet DSM-IV criteria 
for externalizing (ODD, CD) and 
internalizing (anxiety, depression) 
disorders than non-ADHD girls. 
Despite having generally higher rates 
of internalizing psychopathology 
relative to boys, 
 
3, 
 
19, 
 
20 this meta-
analysis indicated that girls with 
ADHD have significantly higher odds 
of having comorbid CD and ODD 
than either anxiety or depression. 
Overall, effect sizes for ADHD and 
comorbid CD and depression were 
consistent across studies, but 
heterogeneity was observed for 
ODD and anxiety. The effect of ADHD 
on comorbid anxiety was larger in 
studies with clinic-referred (versus 
community-referred) girls, using 
diagnostic methods that combined 
interview and rating scale, and 
including children aged <13 years 
only (versus adolescents). The effect 
of ADHD on ODD was moderated 
by informant, with smaller effects 
for studies employing child self-
report in addition to parent-report. 
We observed evidence of potential 
publication bias where studies with 
smaller samples reported larger 
effect sizes for ODD and, to a lesser 
extent, anxiety. 
59 Effect sizes were 
unaffected by sample racial/ethnic 
composition, ADHD subtypes, 
and study publication year. These 
findings suggest that girls with 
ADHD are at substantially higher 
odds for comorbid externalizing and 
internalizing disorders than girls 
without ADHD.
The high rate of comorbid anxiety 
disorders (37.7%) and relatively 
lower rate of comorbid CD (12.8%) 
among girls with ADHD is consistent 
with previous studies comparing 
girls to boys with ADHD. 
30, 
 
60, 
 
61 
However, compared with girls 
without ADHD, girls with ADHD 
were most likely to have comorbid 
CD (9.4 times) and ODD (5.6 times), 
followed by depression (4.2 times) 
and anxiety (3.2 times). The finding 
that ADHD posed higher odds 
for comorbid externalizing than 
internalizing disorders is consistent 
with a previous meta-analysis of 
mixed-gender studies, 
 
18 suggesting 
that patterns of comorbidity in boys 
and girls with ADHD are comparable. 
Although CD is less prevalent in girls

than boys, girls with ADHD were >9 
times more likely to be diagnosed 
with CD than non-ADHD girls. 
Importantly, compared with girls 
with ADHD only, girls with ADHD and 
comorbid ODD and/or CD symptoms 
have particularly poor health and 
behavioral outcomes (eg, risky 
sexual behaviors).6, 
 
62, 
 
63 Furthermore, 
because of the perception that girls 
with ADHD exhibit fewer behavior 
problems than boys, girls who 
are clinic-referred for ADHD are 
often treated for their internalizing 
symptoms, even when externalizing 
symptoms are also evident.

the substantial odds that ADHD poses 
to girls for externalizing problems

in this meta-analysis, careful 
assessment of early ADHD and ODD/
CD in girls should be emphasized 
in clinical settings to facilitate early 
intervention of ADHD and comorbid 
externalizing symptoms to prevent 
later negative outcomes.
These meta-analytic results 
suggest that, compared with girls 
without ADHD, girls with ADHD 
have significantly higher odds of 
having a comorbid externalizing 
disorder than an internalizing 
disorder. The pathways of risk for 
developing internalizing disorders 
among girls with ADHD may be due 
to individual and environmental 
factors that are independent of 
their ADHD, such as cognitive 
factors (eg, perceived control), 
temperament (eg, inhibition), and 
unique family factors (eg, parental 
overprotectiveness). 
64 
– 
66 Thus, 
future studies should focus on 
understanding the factors that 
independently contribute to anxiety 
and depression for girls beyond 
those associated with ADHD. In 
addition to the direct treatment 
of ADHD symptoms in girls, 
reduction of comorbid internalizing 
psychopathology likely necessitates 
more complex treatment plans that 
separately target anxiety/depression 
symptoms (eg, cognitive behavioral 
therapy). 
67
Significant variability in effect 
sizes was observed across studies 
for ADHD with ODD and anxiety 
disorders. No single moderator 
explained the heterogeneity in 
effect sizes for ODD and anxiety; 
moderators were disorder-specific. 
Compared with studies relying on 
parent-report only, studies that 
combined parent and child reports 
yielded smaller effect sizes of the 
association between ADHD and ODD, 
but no differences were observed 
between parent and teacher reports. 
This is consistent with lower rates of 
youth self-reported psychopathology 
compared with parent- and 
teacher-report. 
68 Studies including 
clinic-referred girls reported 
stronger associations between ADHD 
and anxiety, whereas combined 
diagnostic methods (interview and 
rating scale) yielded higher effect 
sizes for anxiety than interview-only 
methods. Finally, girls with ADHD 
in samples including adolescents 
(versus children aged <13 years) 
had lower rates of comorbid anxiety, 
which is somewhat surprising given 
that anxiety generally increases 
with age. 
69 The present findings 
may reflect that samples exclusively 
focused on childhood assess different 
types of anxiety disorders (eg, 
separation anxiety, specific phobia) 
compared with other forms of 
anxiety (eg, generalized anxiety); 
however, the number of anxiety 
disorders assessed among studies 
did not influence effect sizes of ADHD 
and anxiety.
These findings were derived 
from cross-sectional studies, thus 
precluding causal inferences. It is 
unclear how variability in ADHD 
symptoms across development 
prospectively affects adult 
psychopathology, an important 
area of inquiry given the frequent 
persistence of ADHD. For example, 
rates of depression and CD were 
less prevalent in the non-ADHD 
groups compared with epidemiologic 
samples, which likely reflects the 
relative youth of study participants 
(versus adolescents or adults). 
Given that the median age of onset 
for CD and depression is in early 
adolescence and young adulthood, 
 
70 
respectively, studies must include a 
full range of development to clarify 
how patterns of comorbidity change 
over time. Especially for girls, 
ADHD may be particularly salient in 
initiating cascading effects that lead 
to long-term impairments because of 
the elevated stigma associated with 
the disorder. 
10, 
 
11 Thus, longitudinal 
studies are necessary to describe the 
developmental outcomes of girls with 
and without ADHD.
Importantly, an accurate estimation 
of comorbidity in girls with ADHD 
depends on knowing the true 
prevalence of ADHD in girls, a 
critical issue that remains largely 
unresolved. 
29, 
 
71 Some studies suggest 
that ADHD may be underdiagnosed 
in girls, 
 
27, 
 
72 whereas others suggest 
that ADHD is overdiagnosed 
in boys.73 The assumption of 
underdiagnosis of ADHD in girls 
may suggest that the comorbidity 
estimates derived in this study are 
inflated, because they are based 
on girls with particularly severe 
(ie, impairing) ADHD symptoms. 
Alternatively, it is also possible that 
rates of psychopathology in girls 
without ADHD were underestimated 
because these girls were more likely 
to be drawn from community versus 
clinical samples compared with girls 
with ADHD. Furthermore, relative 
to girls, boys with ADHD are more 
likely to be referred for treatment, 
reflecting a general delay in 
recognizing, diagnosing, and treating 
ADHD in girls that contributes to 
more severe symptoms among 
referred girls. 
74 This is consistent 
with the present findings that 
clinic-referred samples reported 
higher rates of comorbid anxiety 
than community-referred samples, 
although this was not the case for 
comorbid ODD, CD, or depression. 
Thus, despite our findings that 
indicate substantially higher odds for 
comorbidity among girls with versus 
without ADHD, securing the true 
estimates of comorbidity for girls 
with ADHD demands first improving 
diagnostic accuracy of childhood 
ADHD in girls.
Furthermore, although this meta-
analysis included any subtype 
of ADHD, and studies did not 
consistently report subtype 
differences for girls, the number of 
children with the inattentive subtype 
may be higher in community samples, 
whereas combined type cases are 
more common in clinic-referred 
samples. 
60, 
 
75 Because inattention may

be specifically linked to separation 
anxiety, 
 
76 whereas hyperactivity 
predicts more externalizing problems, 
 
77 
generalized anxiety disorder, 
76 
and suicide attempts and self-
injury, 
 
5 clarifying these differential 
associations has important 
implications for the assessment 
of ADHD and prevention of 
psychopathology. Future studies that 
directly explore ADHD subtypes and 
comorbidity patterns will elucidate 
how inattention and hyperactivity 
may differentially relate to comorbid 
psychopathology in girls.
This meta-analysis provides the 
first formal characterization that 
girls with ADHD are at substantially 
higher odds for comorbid CD, ODD, 
depression, and anxiety disorders 
compared with girls without ADHD. 
Given the rising prevalence and 
significant impairment of ADHD 
among girls, 
 
78 these findings attest 
to the need for increased scientific 
and clinical efforts to improve the 
diagnosis and treatment of girls 
with ADHD. Furthermore, these 
meta-analytic findings suggest that 
ADHD poses particularly higher 
odds for comorbid externalizing 
compared with internalizing 
disorders in girls. Careful assessment 
of early ADHD and ODD/CD in 
girls should be emphasized in 
clinical settings to facilitate early 
intervention and to prevent later 
negative outcomes associated with 
externalizing behaviors. Future 
longitudinal studies that investigate 
the developmental course of these 
associations are necessary to 
identifying the putative mechanisms 
underlying pathways between ADHD 
and other psychopathology in girls.
