doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00297.2016.—Prolonged sitting impairs endo-
thelial function in the leg vasculature, and this impairment is thought
to be largely mediated by a sustained reduction in blood flow-induced
shear stress. Indeed, preventing the marked reduction of shear stress
during sitting with local heating abolishes the impairment in popliteal
artery endothelial function. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that
sitting-induced reductions in shear stress and ensuing endothelial
dysfunction would be prevented by periodic leg movement, or “fidg-
eting.” In 11 young, healthy subjects, bilateral measurements of
popliteal artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were performed before
and after a 3-h sitting period during which one leg was subjected to
intermittent fidgeting (1 min on/4 min off) while the contralateral leg
remained still throughout and served as an internal control. Fidgeting
produced a pronounced increase in popliteal artery blood flow and shear
rate (prefidgeting, 33.7 � 2.6 s�1 to immediately postfidgeting, 222.7 �
28.3 s�1; mean � SE; P � 0.001) that tapered off during the following
60 s. Fidgeting did not alter popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate of
the contralateral leg, which was subjected to a reduction in blood flow
and shear rate throughout the sitting period (presit, 71.7 � 8.0 s�1 to 3-h
sit, 20.2 � 2.9 s�1; P � 0.001). Popliteal artery FMD was impaired after
3 h of sitting in the control leg (presit, 4.5 � 0.3% to postsit: 1.6 � 1.1%;
P � 0.039) but improved in the fidgeting leg (presit, 3.7 � 0.6% to
postsit, 6.6 � 1.2%; P � 0.014). Collectively, the present study provides
evidence that prolonged sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction is
preventable with small amounts of leg movement while sitting, likely
through the intermittent increases in vascular shear stress.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY
This study reveals that the simple behavior of fidgeting is
sufficient to counteract the detrimental effects of prolonged
sitting on leg endothelial function. Thus, we provide the first
evidence that the unfavorable vascular effects of sitting are
avoidable with small amounts of leg movement while seated for
an extended period.
ALTERATIONS IN LOCAL HEMODYNAMIC forces play a fundamental
role in the etiology of atherosclerotic disease (7). As early as
1969, it was noted that atherosclerotic lesions preferentially
develop in arterial regions characterized by low shear stress
(3). Indeed, studies in cultured endothelial cells as well as in
vivo studies in animals and humans demonstrate that low shear
stress impairs endothelial function and instigates atherosclero-
sis (4, 9, 10, 16, 22, 24, 27). Notably, arteries of the lower
limbs are exposed to marked reductions in blood flow and
shear stress during sitting, and this in turn leads to transient
endothelial dysfunction (15, 19, 20, 25). Consistent with the
notion that sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction is me-
diated by a reduction in shear stress, we recently found that
preventing the reduction of shear stress during prolonged
sitting using local heating to increase blood flow abolished the
impairment in popliteal artery endothelial function (20). Taken
together, it is conceivable that the proatherogenic hemody-
namic environment to which the vasculature of the lower limbs
is exposed to during sitting contributes to the increased pro-
pensity of the leg vasculature to disease.
Herein we examined whether periodic leg muscle contrac-
tion, or “fidgeting,” during sitting would be effective at avert-
ing the marked reduction in leg blood flow and shear stress
leading to preservation of leg endothelial function. Bilateral
measurements of popliteal artery flow-mediated dilation
(FMD) were performed before and after a 3-h sitting period
during which one leg was subjected to intermittent fidgeting (1
min on/4 min off) while the contralateral leg remained still
throughout and served as an internal control. We hypothesized
that sitting-induced reductions in shear stress and ensuing
endothelial dysfunction would be prevented by intermittent
fidgeting.
METHODS
Eleven young healthy and recreationally active subjects (male, n �
7; and female, n � 4) recruited from the University of Missouri
campus participated in this study (age, 26 � 1 yr; height, 173.4 � 3.3
cm; weight, 76.8 � 6.1 kg; body mass index, 25.0 � 1.1 kg/m2). All
experimental procedures and measurements conformed to the Decla-
ration of Helsinki and were approved by the University of Missouri
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. Before participating in
the study, each subject provided written, informed consent. Subjects
were recreationally active and nonsmokers with no history or symp-
toms of cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, or neurological disease
as determined from a medical health history questionnaire. No sub-
jects were using prescribed or over-the-counter medications.

 to eat a light meal 2 h or more before arriving to the laboratory. In
addition, subjects were asked to refrain from caffeine and supplements
for at least 12 h as well as from exercise for 24 h before the study visit.
Ten subjects were tested at 8:00 AM and one subject was tested at
2:00 PM. All study visits were performed in a temperature-controlled
room kept at 22–23°C. Upon arrival to the laboratory, subjects were
placed in a supine position with an automated sphygmomanometer
(SphygmoCor XCEL, AtCor Medical, Itasca, IL) for periodic mea-
surements of brachial artery blood pressure (BP), which were obtained
after resting quietly for 10 min. Popliteal artery diameter and blood
velocity were measured using duplex-Doppler ultrasound (Logiq P5;
GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). An 11-MHz linear array
transducer was placed over the popliteal artery just distal to the
popliteal fossa. Simultaneous diameter and velocity signals were
obtained in duplex mode at a pulsed frequency of 5 MHz and
corrected with an insonation angle of 60°. Sample volume was
adjusted to encompass the entire lumen of the vessel without extend-
ing beyond the walls, and the cursor was set at midvessel. Popliteal
artery FMD was assessed in both legs in the supine position as
previously described (2, 19, 20). Briefly, a rapid inflating cuff was
placed on the lower leg. Two minutes of baseline hemodynamics were
recorded and then the cuff was inflated to a pressure of 220 mmHg for
5 min. Continuous diameter and blood velocity measures were re-
corded for 3 min following cuff deflation. Recordings of all vascular
variables were analyzed offline using specialized edge-detection soft-
ware (Cardiovascular Suite, Quipu, Pisa, Italy).
Following baseline FMD measurements, subjects were positioned
into a seated position for 3 h. Ankle circumference (taken at midpoint
of malleolus lateralis) was measured on both legs as a crude estimate
of venous congestion. One leg remained still throughout the sitting
period (control leg), whereas the contralateral leg was subjected to
intermittent fidgeting (fidgeting leg, 1 min on/4 min off). For the
intermittent fidgeting intervention, subjects tapped the heel and
bounced the knee at their own natural cadence (Fig. 1A). The number
of heel taps was quantified during a fidgeting bout for each subject.
Single leg fidgeting was designed to create intermittent increases in

 blood flow and shear stress in one leg while the other leg remained
still (Fig. 1B). Throughout the entire protocol, a study representative
monitored the subject to ensure no leg movements or muscle contrac-
tions occurred in the control leg and during the nonfidgeting time. In
addition, monitoring of fidgeting was performed at each time interval.
Right and left legs were randomly assigned the condition of control
leg or fidgeting leg. Throughout the course of the sitting period, BP,
popliteal artery diameter and blood velocity, and ankle circumference
were measured on both legs every hour. It should be noted that
vascular measurements in control and fidgeting legs were not per-
formed simultaneously because only one Doppler ultrasound was
available for this study. We used a chair that allows sufficient space
for the ultrasound probe to access the popliteal artery during sitting.
Because it was technically challenging to obtain Doppler ultrasound
images during fidgeting, to quantify the blood flow and shear re-
sponses to fidgeting (in both legs), measures were initiated immedi-
ately (within 2 or 3 s) after the fidgeting bout. The basal measurements
of popliteal artery blood flow and shear (in both legs) during sitting
were performed after 2 min of rest following the 1-min fidgeting. At
every hour, BP was measured after the measurements of blood flow.
Following the 3-h sitting period, subjects were manually lifted and
placed back into the supine position to avoid any muscle activity of
the legs. FMD assessments were then immediately (within 5 min)
repeated. The order of FMD assessments was randomized between
control and fidgeting legs within each subject. Once FMD was
completed in one leg; the other leg was immediately set up for the
FMD measurement (�5 min). After the FMD measurements, one last
measurement of BP was performed while the subject rested supine.
Data analysis. Blood flow was calculated from continuous diam-
eter and mean blood velocity recordings at each of the experimental
time points using the following equation: 3.14 � (diameter/2)2 �
mean blood velocity � 60. Popliteal artery FMD percent change was
calculated using the following equation: %FMD � (peak diameter �
base diameter)/(base diameter) � 100. Shear rate was defined as 8 �
mean blood velocity/diameter (17). Hyperemic shear rate area under
the curve (AUC) up to peak diameter was calculated as stimulus for
FMD, as previously described (2, 24).
Statistical analysis. A two-way (time � leg) repeated-measures
ANOVA using the Tukey HSD test for pairwise comparisons was
performed on all dependent variables. FMD was also adjusted for
hyperemic shear rate AUC via ANCOVA to statistically control for
the influence of shear stimulus on the FMD response. ANCOVA
and ANOVA test were performed using SPSS software (version
23). Significance was accepted at P � 0.05. Data are expressed as
means � SE.
RESULTS
Over the course of the sitting period, popliteal artery blood
flow (Table 1) and shear rate (Fig. 2A) were progressively
reduced in both legs (P � 0.05). However, the fidgeting leg
exhibited a significantly higher blood flow (Table 1, P � 0.05)
and shear rate (Fig. 2A, P � 0.05) than the control leg during
the sitting period. Notably, each bout of fidgeting produced a
pronounced increase in popliteal artery blood flow and shear
rate (Fig. 2B, P � 0.05) that tapered off during the following
60 s. Fidgeting did not alter popliteal artery blood flow and
shear rate in the contralateral leg (Fig. 2B). During fidgeting,
subjects were instructed to adhere to their own cadence of heel
taps, which turned out to be fairly similar across individuals
(average, 248 � 6 taps/min; range, 220 to 290 taps/min).
Importantly, 3 h of sitting caused a significant impairment in
popliteal artery FMD in the control leg Fig. 3 (Cohen’s d �
1.08; P � 0.039), whereas, in contrast, the fidgeting leg
exhibited an increase in FMD (Fig. 3, Cohen’s d � 0.92; P �
0.014). All 11 subjects decreased FMD in the control leg, and
9 out of 11 subjects increased FMD in the fidgeting leg. The
improvement in FMD from fidgeting was not dependent on
whether the fidgeting leg was assessed first or second following
the sitting period (P � 0.858).
Hyperemic shear rate AUC was similar between legs before
sitting and significantly reduced in both legs after sitting (Table
1, P � 0.05). FMD corrected for hyperemic shear rate AUC by
ANCOVA did not affect the interpretation of the main findings
as FMD was reduced in the control leg and elevated in the
fidgeting leg (Table 1). No changes were observed in popliteal
artery diameter over time and no differences between legs were
detected across time points (Table 1).

 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly elevated
during the sitting period but returned to presitting levels there-
after (Table 1). Ankle circumference was increased over time
in the control leg (3-h sit, 2.58 � 0.7%, relative to presit, P �
0.05), whereas no changes were observed in the fidgeting leg
(3-h sit, 0.15 � 0.1%, relative to presit, P � 0.05).
DISCUSSION
The novel finding of the present study is that leg endothelial
dysfunction caused by prolonged sitting can be prevented by
small amounts of leg movement or fidgeting. Indeed, we found
that leg endothelial function was preserved in the leg subjected
to a natural pattern of intermittent fidgeting but impaired in the
leg that remained still. These findings support the notion that
small amounts of leg movement during sitting are sufficient to
prevent leg endothelial dysfunction in healthy young individ-
uals, likely through the intermittent increases in blood flow-
induced shear stress.
The prevalence of sedentary jobs in modern societies has
augmented radically in the last few decades such that occupa-
tions involving some level of physical activity now represent a
small fraction of the total workforce (5). Excessive sitting is
not only confined to the workplace as our home and social
environment is also full of incessant enticements to sit. While
it is becoming more appreciated that sedentary behavior is
correlated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular dis-
ease (5, 8), the mechanisms linking prolonged sitting time to
increased cardiovascular disease risk still remain unclear. An
understanding of the mechanisms by which too much sitting
imposes cardiovascular risk becomes of paramount importance
to create effective strategies that can mitigate the risks associ-
ated with this emerging “occupational” and “societal” hazard
(14).
Along these lines, we (19, 20) and others (15, 25) have
observed that during prolonged sitting, there is a marked
reduction in blood flow and shear stress in the lower extrem-
ities that subsequently leads to leg endothelial dysfunction. We
recently conducted a study designed to prevent the reduction in
leg blood flow and thus shear stress during prolonged sitting
with local heating of the foot (20). We found that leg endo-
thelial dysfunction following sitting was abrogated by prevent-
ing the decrease in shear during sitting, supporting the hypoth-
esis that sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction is indeed
mediated by a reduction in shear stress (20).
While local heating of the foot was effective at sustaining
leg blood flow and shear stress over the sitting period and
consequently prevent the impairment in endothelial function
(20), alternative more applicable strategies that could be used
to offset the detrimental effects of sitting need investigation.
As such, in the present study, we examined whether transient
elevations in blood flow and shear stress with just fidgeting was
sufficient to avert endothelial dysfunction caused by sitting.
This was accomplished by subjecting one leg to intermittent
fidgeting (1 min on/4 min off) during sitting while the con-
tralateral leg remained still throughout and served as an inter-
nal control. Our model of fidgeting was chosen to reflect the
natural behavior of fidgeting, and, as such, subjects were
instructed to adhere to their own cadence of heel taps which
turned out to be fairly similar across individuals (average, 248 �
6 taps/min). Importantly, we found that this small amount of
leg movement during sitting prevented the decline in leg
endothelial function. Each single 1-min bout of fidgeting
caused a marked and transient increase in blood flow and shear
stress that remained slightly elevated postfidgeting. Of note,
fidgeting did not alter blood flow and shear stress in the

 contralateral nonfidgeting leg. Given our previous work indi-
cating that sustained reductions in flow-induced shear stress is
a primary mechanism by which sitting induces leg endothelial
dysfunction (20), it is likely that the beneficial vascular effects
of fidgeting are mediated through the intermittent increases in
shear stress throughout the prolonged sitting period; however,
the involvement of other potential factors cannot be excluded.
Sitting-induced endothelial dysfunction in the lower extrem-
ities is of clinical relevance in light of evidence establishing
that the leg vasculature is highly vulnerable to atherosclerosis,
relative to other disease-resistant vasculatures such as the
brachial artery (1, 12, 13, 21, 23). Our previous findings (19,
20) and findings from others (15, 26) that sitting causes
endothelial dysfunction in the leg, but not the arm, fuel the idea
that increased susceptibility of the leg vasculature to athero-
sclerosis may be, in part, attributable to the direct detrimental
effects of prolonged sitting on that vasculature. Strategies such
as fidgeting can offset the decay in leg blood flow and shear
stress during sitting, thus preventing the consequent impair-
ment of endothelial function and potentially providing impor-
tant vascular benefits in the long term. However, more research
is needed to examine the extent to which preventing leg
endothelial dysfunction with sitting, through fidgeting or other
approaches, leads to long-lasting effects. Furthermore, it re-
mains unknown whether fidgeting with both legs would pro-
duce even greater beneficial vascular effects. It is also unde-
termined the extent to which the acute effects of fidgeting last
and whether there are sex differences in the vascular responses
to sitting as well as an influence of the menstrual cycle. Lastly,
future work should determine if the present results can be
extrapolated to clinical populations that are susceptible to
peripheral artery disease such as patients with type 2 diabetes.
The mechanisms by which sitting increases leg vascular
resistance and contributes to subsequent reductions in shear
stress warrant consideration. It is possible that in the absence of
muscle contraction, the increased hydrostatic pressure to which
the legs are exposed during sitting lead to blood pooling and
associated venous distension-induced arterial constriction and
pressure-induced myogenic constriction (11). The increased
ankle circumference observed during sitting in the control leg
suggests that venous congestion occurred in the noncontracting
lower limb. Venous distension has been shown to evoke
sympathetic activation via stimulation of limb afferents (6),
which may partially explain why muscle sympathetic nerve
activity is greater in the upright position compared with supine
(17). As a result, adrenergic vasoconstriction may also contrib-
ute to the increased leg vascular resistance. In this regard, we
found a mild but significant increase in blood pressure during
sitting.
In conclusion, the present study revealed that the simple
behavior of fidgeting is sufficient to counteract the detrimental
effects of prolonged sitting on leg endothelial function, likely
through the intermittent increases in blood flow-induced shear
stress. This study provides the first evidence that the detrimen-
tal vascular effects of sitting are preventable with small
amounts of leg movement while seated for an extended period.
Accordingly, people should be encouraged to consciously
engage in leg movement when sitting for prolonged periods of
time either at work or at home.
