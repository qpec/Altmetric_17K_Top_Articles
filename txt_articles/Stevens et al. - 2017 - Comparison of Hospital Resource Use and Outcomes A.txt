IMPORTANCE A physician’
s prior experience caring for a patient may be associated with
patient outcomes and care patterns during and after hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE To examine differences in the use of health care resources and outcomes among
hospitalized patients cared for by hospitalists, their own primary care physicians (PCPs), or
other generalists.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study analyzed admissions for the 20
most common medical diagnoses among elderly fee-for-service Medicare patients from
January 1 through December 31, 2013. Patients had at least 1 previous encounter with an
outpatient clinician within the 365 days before admission, and diagnoses were restricted to
the 20 most common diagnosis related groups. Data were collected from Medicare Parts A
and B claims data, and outcomes were analyzed from January 1, 2013, through January 31,
2014.
EXPOSURES Physician types included hospitalists, PCPs (ie, the physicians who provided a
plurality of ambulatory visits in the year preceding admission), or generalists (not the
patients’PCPs).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of in-hospital specialist consultations, length of
stay, discharge site, all-cause 7- and 30-day readmission rates, and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS A total of 560 651 admissions were analyzed (41.9% men and 59.1% women; mean
[SD] age, 80 [8] years). Patients’physicians were hospitalists in 59.7% of admissions; PCPs, in
14.2%; and other generalists, in 26.1%. Primary care physicians used consultations 3% more
(relative risk, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05) and other generalists used consultations 6% more
(relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.07) than hospitalists. Lengths of stay were 12% longer
among patients cared for by PCPs (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.13) and 6%
longer among those cared for by other generalists (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.06; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.07) compared with patients cared for by hospitalists. However, PCPs were more
likely to discharge patients home (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17), whereas
other generalists were less likely to do so (AOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96). Relative to
hospitalists, patients cared for by PCPs had similar readmission rates at 7 days (AOR, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.96-1.01) and 30 days (AOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04), whereas other generalists’
readmission rates were greater than hospitalists’rates at 7 (AOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07) and
30 (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06) days. Patients cared for by PCPs had lower 30-day
mortality than patients of hospitalists (AOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97), whereas the mortality
rate of patients of other generalists was higher (AOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07-1.12).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A PCP’
s prior experience with a patient may be associated
with inpatient use of resources and patient outcomes. Patients cared for by their own PCP
had slightly longer lengths of stay and were more likely to be discharged home but also were
less likely to die within 30 days compared with those cared for by hospitalists or other
generalists.

 T
hree dominant models of generalist care exist for adults
hospitalized for medical diagnoses in the United States.
For some patients, their primary care physician (PCP)
serves as the attending physician during a hospitalization. For
others, a hospitalist (a generalist physician who focuses pri-
marily on hospitalized patients) serves as the attending phy-
sician. Finally, some patients are cared for by a cross-
covering generalist who is neither the patient’
s PCP nor a
hospitalist (eg, physicians in group practices may cover inpa-
tient admissions for the practice for a few weeks per year).
These practice patterns reflect trade-offs between familiarity
with the patient and expertise in hospital care. The associa-
tion between these trade-offs and patient outcomes has not
been extensively investigated.
Hospitalists now outnumber any other specialty of inter-
nal medicine, care for an increasing number of patients,1 and
care for patients in approximately 75% of US hospitals.2 The
hospitalist model has been studied extensively, but whether
hospitalists increase the overall value of care has been a mat-
ter of some debate. Prior research3-6 has demonstrated few dif-
ferences between hospitalists and other internists in inpa-
tient mortality and readmissions, although some studies3-6
have noted decreased lengths of stay among patients cared for
by hospitalists. Those studies, however, do not distinguish be-
tween patients cared for by their own PCPs and other cover-
ing physicians who may have little prior knowledge of the pa-
tient, thereby potentially masking the benefits of familiarity
with the patient. Moreover, most prior research focusing on
costs of care has been limited to care in the hospital and ex-
cludes the rest of the episode of care.4,6-8
Inthiscontext,weaimedtoestimatedifferencesincareand
outcomes of hospitalized patients cared for by different types
of generalists. We used a nationally representative sample of
Medicarebeneficiarieshospitalizedforthemostcommonmedi-
cal diagnoses in the United States and hypothesized that famil-
iarity with the patient would be associated with less use of spe-
cialty consultation and shorter length of stay. We were also
interested in differences in the likelihood of discharge to home
(vs postacute care), readmissions, and 30-day mortality.
Methods
Study Population
We studied medical admissions to acute care hospitals from
January 1 through December 31, 2013, in the 50 states and
Washington, DC, among a random 20% sample of continu-
ously enrolled fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 66 years
or older. To identify a relatively homogeneous population, we
restricted our population to patients admitted for the 20 most
common medical diagnosis related groups (DRGs) (including
related DRGs for conditions without complications, with com-
plications, or with major complications). We also restricted the
population to beneficiaries with at least 1 encounter with an
outpatient clinician in the 365 days before admission. Admis-
sions to federal hospitals and hospitals with fewer than 10
medical admissions in 2013 were excluded.9 Our study was ap-
proved by the institutional review board at the Beth Israel Dea-
coness Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, which waived
the requirements of informed consent and authorization for
disclosure of protected health information.

We identified hospitalists by using previously estab-
lished methods based on the volume of inpatient claims per
year.1 We categorized claims billed by all generalist physi-
cians according to Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes
for care setting: ambulatory (CPT codes 99201-99205, 99211-
99215, and 99241-99245) or inpatient (CPT codes 99221-
99223,99231-99233,and99251-99255).Wethendefinedahos-
pitalist as a generalist physician who billed at least 20 claims
per year (equivalent to 100 per year given our 20% sample),
of which 90% or more were inpatient claims.

Key Points
Question Does the type of generalist physician caring for a
hospitalized patient—the patient’
s primary care physician, a
hospitalist, or another covering outpatient generalist—affect
patient outcomes in and out of the hospital?
Findings In this cohort study of 560 651 admissions of Medicare
beneficiaries in 2013, patients cared for during a hospitalization by
their own primary care physicians had slightly longer lengths of
stay, were more likely to be discharged to home, and were less
likely to die within 30 days compared with those cared for by
hospitalists. Patients cared for by hospitalists had fewer specialty
consultations, all of which represented significant differences.
Meaning A physician’
s prior experience with a patient may be
associated with resource use and patient outcomes in the hospital
and during the postdischarge period.

Demographic information, including age (categorized in 5-year

Hispanic white, Asian, and other), and sex were obtained from
the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File. We also identified
whether the beneficiary was dually eligible for Medicare and
Medicaid. We measured clinical comorbidities in the calendar
year before admission using the Center for Medicare & Medic-
aid Services hierarchical condition categories (HCCs)11 and es-

measuredthetendencyofahospitaltouseresources(themean
number of intensive care unit admissions in the previous year,
coded as quartiles10) and the hospital’
s patient illness burden
(measured as mean Medicare patient HCC scores).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from January 1, 2013, through January 31,
2014. The reference group for the analyses was the hospitalist
group. We compared patient characteristics across the 3 types
of generalists using χ2 tests for categorical variables and un-
paired t tests for continuous variables, with P < .05 (2 sided) in-
dicatingstatisticalsignificance.Inmultivariablemodels,weused
fixedeffectsforeachDRGfamilyandomittedvariablesthatwere
endogenous to the hospital stay. For the number of inpatient
consultations, we fit a Poisson regression model with a log link,
using generalized estimating equations to account for correla-
tion of patients within hospital (SAS code available in eTable 1
intheSupplement).Forlengthofstay,wefitanegativebinomi-
nal regression model with a log link and the same generalized
estimating equation structure for clustering. To analyze the bi-
nary outcomes (7- and 30-day readmission rates, 30-day mor-
tality,anddischargedestination),weusedgeneralizedestimat-
ing equation models with logit link and binomial distributions.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, because
hospitalists might have more experience with sicker patients,
we separately estimated the association between type of gen-
eralist and outcomes stratified by the complexity of the admis-
sion, defined by DRG complexity, and stratified by the overall
disease burden of the patient, defined by HCC score calcu-
lated during the prior year. Second, to understand the contri-
bution of prior patient knowledge to our results, we exam-
ined whether the same outpatient physicians behaved
differently with patients they knew and patients they did not
know by analyzing a subgroup of physicians who were PCPs
for some patients and other generalists for other patients and
who cared for at least 5 patients in each role. Third, because
hospitals with different care models might vary in other ways,
weexaminedtheassociationbetweengeneralistphysiciantype
and outcomes of interest after stratifying hospitals into quar-
tiles based on the proportion of admissions cared for by PCPs.
Fourth, because hospitalists may be more skilled at billing for
patient care than PCPs or other generalists, we performed a ro-
bustness check of our results by comparing our final model, in-
cluding DRG family and DRG severity, with a model with DRG
familyalone.Fifth,becausewerestrictedourpopulationtothe
most common medical admissions that distinguished among
different levels of severity of the same condition (eg, with or
without comorbidities or complications), we repeated our un-
adjusted analyses using all medical admissions.
Results
We studied a total of 560 651 medicine admissions (59.1%
women and 41.9% men; mean [SD] age, 80 [8] years; 14.4%
nonwhite) to 4535 hospitals from January 1 to December 31,

PCPs in 14.2%, and other outpatient generalists in 26.1%. Of
physicians assigned as PCPs, 76.4% were other generalists for
separate admissions at some point in 2013. The median length
of stay was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3-7 days); 28.5%
of admissions included an intensive care unit stay; and 10.6%
of patients died by 30 days after admission. Most admissions
were to hospitals with more than 250 beds, to nongovern-
ment and not-for-profit hospitals, and to hospitals in urban
areas. Patients cared for by each of the 3 physician types were

Sensitivity Analyses
In sensitivity analyses, the complexity of the admission (acu-
ity of the DRG) and patient disease burden (HCC scores) largely
did not modify the association of generalist type and resource
use, the likelihood of discharging patients home, readmission,
or mortality (eTables 8 and 9 in the Supplement). For example,
patientscaredforbyPCPshadthelowest30-daymortalityacross
all3physiciangroupsatallquantilesofDRGcomplexityandpa-
tient comorbidities. We repeated our analyses after stratifying
hospitals into quartiles of PCP use to distinguish whether the
caredeliverymodelofthehospitalorthetypeofphysicianmay
lead to differences in patient outcomes. Our findings were con-
sistent with our overall findings.
In analyses restricted to nonhospitalist physicians who
were classified as the PCPs of some patients but not of others,
physicians treating their own patients ordered fewer consul-
tations, more frequently discharged patients home, and had
lower 30-day mortality than when they were caring for pa-
tients with whom they were less familiar (eTables 10 and 11 in
the Supplement). In analyses of an expanded population of all
medical admissions, results also remained unchanged.

 other generalists has not distinguished between physicians
who were previously familiar with the patient and other cov-
eringgeneralistswhomighthavelessexperiencecaringforhos-
pitalizedpatients(comparedwithhospitalists)andlittleknowl-
edgeofthespecificpatient(comparedwiththepatients’PCPs).
We found that, although patients cared for in the hospital by
their own PCPs had slightly longer lengths of stay, they also
were more likely to be discharged home and had improved sur-
vival, even after controlling for differences in patient and hos-
pital characteristics. In contrast, patients cared for by physi-
cians with the least knowledge of the hospital and the patient
hadmorefrequentspecialtyconsultationsandthehighestrates
of readmission at 7 and 30 days, were the least likely to be dis-
charged home, and had the highest mortality at 30 days.
Sincethehospitalistmodelwasfirstintroducedintheearly
1990s, it has spread broadly in the United States. Hospitalists
develop expertise in complex, hospital-level care and are more
available at the patient’
s bedside.17-19 Thus, many believed that
hospitalist care would be more efficient and lead to better out-
comes, which influenced growth of the care model.20 This
model also reduced the need for office-based PCPs, who them-
selves had growing patient panels and increasing complexity
of care in the outpatient setting, to devote time to caring for
their patients who were hospitalized.21 Until now, the litera-
ture about hospitalist models has demonstrated that exper-
tise about hospital-level care has translated into slightly de-
creased length of stay and raised the possibility of improved
outcomes. Each of those studies, however, faced substantial
limitations. For instance, although some studies were able to
randomizepatientstodifferentmodelsofcare,theyweresingle-
institution studies that were also limited by a small number of
hospitalistsprovidingcareinthehospitalistarmofthestudy.3,5
Similarly,althoughLindenaueretal4comparedhospitalistswith
patientscaredforbyfamilyphysiciansorinternalmedicinephy-
sicians across a much larger sample of hospitals, they did not
differentiate among nonhospitalist physicians based on prior
knowledge of the patient. Finally, Jungerwirth et al22 looked
solely at the association of presence of hospitalists at institu-
tions with risk-adjusted outcomes, risking ecological bias.

ofourstudy,unmeasuredconfoundingmighthavecontributed
totheseresults.Furtherresearchisneededtoidentifythemecha-
nismsbywhichPCPsachievebetteroutcomes,suchaswhether
somepopulationsofpatientswithclinicallycomplexconditions
may benefit from a new type of physician who can incorporate
familiarity with the patient and the hospital.15
Our findings also suggest that engaging a patient’
s PCP in
his or her hospital care may be an approach to increasing the
rates of discharge home, an outcome important to the patient
and the hospital system, without increasing the risk for read-
missions at 7 days. When elderly patients are discharged to
postacute care facilities, their likelihood of returning home de-
creases, which has substantial implications for quality of life
and spending in ensuing years.23,24
Ourfindingsalsoshowthatpatientscaredforbyothergen-
eralists—physicians who neither work primarily in a hospital
setting nor likely have longitudinal knowledge of the patient—
had the worst outcomes. Conceptually, this third group of phy-
sicians has less outpatient continuity with patients than PCPs
and less specialization in hospital-based care than
hospitalists.4,25 Our results show that patients cared for by
these physicians had worse readmission and mortality out-
comes relative to those cared for by hospitalists. We found that
most of the PCPs who cared for their own patients in the hos-
pital also cared for other patients, suggesting that at least some
of these physicians practice in group arrangements that in-
volve cross-coverage. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis of
this group found that care patterns differed according to
whether the physician was that patient’
s assigned PCP, sug-
gesting that familiarity with a patient over time is responsible
for some of the findings we observed. Our study suggests that
opportunities exist to clarify which types of outpatient prac-
tice coverage arrangements yield the highest benefits for in-
patient care and meaningful gains in patient outcomes.26,27
Limitations
Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.First,westudiedolderadults
enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, and our findings may not
generalizetoyoungerpatients,otherpayers,orbeneficiariesen-
rolled in Medicare Advantage. We note, however, that Medi-
care patients are responsible for 39% of hospitalizations
nationally.28 Second, we used administrative data. These data
lackthenuanceandgranularityofclinicaldata,whichcouldcon-
tain information, for example, about patient functional status.
Third, we relied on specialty designations on claims and cer-
tain procedural codes to further differentiate specialists from
nonhospitalists, which may misclassify some physicians. This
type of misclassification would bias our results toward the null
if specialists use fewer hospital resources. Fourth, some as-
pects of admissions attended by PCPs, hospitalists, and other
generalists were different in meaningful ways at the admis-
sion and hospital levels. We attempted to control for these dif-
ferences in our regression models, but unmeasured confound-
ing may have contributed to our results. Furthermore, our
assignment of physician type ignores care provided by resi-
dentphysiciansoradvancedpracticeclinicians(eg,nurseprac-
titioners and physician assistants). Fifth, we used the dis-
charge destination field from billing claims to identify patients
dischargedhome,butthisvariablemaynotalwaysbeaccurate.29
Finally, from our models examining inpatient subspecialty use
and length of stay, we excluded a small number of admissions
inwhichpatientsweretransferredbetweenhospitals.Thesehos-
pitalizations were included in the models for discharge desti-
nation and readmission rates, but because these patients were
unlikely to have access to their PCPs at their transfer hospital,
including these cases likely biased our results toward the null.

 Conclusions
Our results suggest that longitudinal contact with a
patient may translate into meaningful differences in
care patterns and patient outcomes. Novel models of
care that integrate PCPs who care for patients in the ambu-
latory setting with their patients’hospital care may yield
substantial benefits in outcomes that are meaningful to
patients.
