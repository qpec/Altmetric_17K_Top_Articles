Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 1% of the general population. Various genes show associations
with schizophrenia and a very weak nominal association with the tight junction protein, claudin-5, has previously been identified.
Claudin-5 is expressed in endothelial cells forming part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, schizophrenia occurs in 30%
of individuals with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a population who are haploinsufficient for the claudin-5 gene. Here, we
show that a variant in the claudin-5 gene is weakly associated with schizophrenia in 22q11DS, leading to 75% less claudin-5 being
expressed in endothelial cells. We also show that targeted adeno-associated virus-mediated suppression of claudin-5 in the mouse
brain results in localized BBB disruption and behavioural changes. Using an inducible ‘knockdown’ mouse model, we further link
claudin-5 suppression with psychosis through a distinct behavioural phenotype showing impairments in learning and memory,
anxiety-like behaviour and sensorimotor gating. In addition, these animals develop seizures and die after 3–4 weeks of claudin-5
suppression, reinforcing the crucial role of claudin-5 in normal neurological function. Finally, we show that anti-psychotic
medications dose-dependently increase claudin-5 expression in vitro and in vivo while aberrant, discontinuous expression of
claudin − 5 in the brains of schizophrenic patients post mortem was observed compared to age-matched controls. Together, these
data suggest that BBB disruption may be a modifying factor in the development of schizophrenia and that drugs directly targeting
the BBB may offer new therapeutic opportunities for treating this disorder.

INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects ~ 1% of the
population and ~ 1.5 million people are newly diagnosed each
year globally.1 It is characterized by delusions (fixed and false
beliefs), hallucinations (visual and auditory), and disorganized
thinking and speech that begin in early adulthood and continues
through life.2 Symptoms can lead to abnormal social behaviours,
depression and anxiety, and may lead to the 10% incidence of
suicide in patients suffering from the condition.3,4 Little is known
about its cause, however, much attention has focused on the role
of neurochemistry and aberrant neural connectivity in the brains
of subjects.5,6
The disease has a strong genetic component to it, with twin
studies suggesting up to 80% heritability of the condition. Many
genetic studies have identified linkage to chromosome 22,
suggesting this region harbours major susceptible loci for
schizophrenia.7–9 Intriguingly, individuals with the chromosomal
abnormality 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) have a 30-fold
increased lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia and other
neuropsychiatric-related conditions due to microdeletions at the
chromosomal region 22q11.21.10–12 22q11DS occurs in ~ 1 in 4000
live births. Patients with 22q11DS display a distinctive set of
developmental defects that can include cardiac abnormalities,
intellectual disabilities and distinctive craniofacial patterning.13
The condition is characterized genetically by microdeletions
within chromosome 22 and these deletions can be up to 3 Mb
in size, which can comprise up to 40 genes. The deletions occur in
only one copy of the 22q11 region of chromosome 22, leaving
individuals essentially haploinsufficient for the genes within that
region. Functional genetic studies associated with 22q11DS
patients have previously focused on elucidating the role of
individual genes within the deleted region in the hope that
genetic predisposition to schizophrenia can be identified. One
major component of the so-called blood-brain barrier (BBB), the
gene claudin-5, is located within chromosome 22q11.21.
Of the numerous biological barriers throughout the body, the
BBB is one of a few highly selective and tightly regulated barriers,
reflecting the brain’s critical roles in cognitive function.14 The BBB
is essential in regulating the exchange of ions and nutrients
between the blood and brain and vice versa, while also protecting

 delicate neural tissue from potentially damaging blood-borne
agents such as pathogens, immune cells and anaphylatoxins.
Owing to this specialized barrier, central nervous system endothe-
lial cells are distinct from endothelial cells of the periphery in
several ways. Specifically, BBB-enriched transporter proteins control
the entry and exit of metabolites across cells (transcellular pathway).
In addition, highly electrical-resistant tight junctions (TJs) limit the
flux between adjacent endothelial cells (paracellular pathway) and
an absence of fenestrations (pores to allow the rapid exchange of
molecules between blood and tissue in peripheral endothelial cells)
function to limit the movement of molecules.15–18

dysfunction (in particular, S-100β) suggest the BBB may be
compromised in patients with schizophrenia,19,20 however, this is
an indirect correlation of BBB dysfunction, and a distinct molecular
genetic association between BBB dysfunction and schizophrenia
has not been described previously. Moreover, the BBB is not a
static microenvironment, it is highly dynamic in both homoeo-
static physiology and pathology.21,22
Here, we describe the involvement of the most enriched TJ
protein at the BBB, claudin-5, in predisposing an increased risk of
schizophrenia in individuals with 22q11DS. In addition, we show
that persistent and targeted suppression of claudin-5 at the BBB in
mouse models induces a correlative phenotype of psychosis-like
behaviours suggesting a regulation of BBB integrity and dyna-
mism may be therapeutically relevant for the treatment of
schizophrenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments and experimental groups
All studies carried out in the Smurfit Institute of Genetics in Trinity College
Dublin (TCD) adhere to the principles laid out by the internal ethics
committee at TCD and all relevant national licences were obtained prior to
commencement of all studies. All mice were bred on-site in the specific
pathogen-free unit at the Smurfit Institute of Genetics in TCD.
Genotyping of patients for SNP rs10314
Ethical approval for human studies was obtained through the Royal
Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects. DNA of 100 ng from patients was amplified by PCR in a volume of
50 μl using 1 × reaction buffer, 200 μM each of dNTPs, 0.2 μM of forward
and reverse primers, and 1.25 units of DNA Taq polymerase under the
following conditions: 95 °C 5 min; (95 °C 1 min; 58 °C 1 min; 72 °C
1 min) × 34; 72 °C 5 min; 4 °C hold. This produced an amplified product
of 603 bp using the following primers: forward primer 5′-CGACAAGAAG
AACTACGTCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGGTGGGAGAGAGTTCAAA-3′. The
amplified product was digested with restriction endonuclease PvuII giving
fragments of 177+199+227 and 199+404 for the g and c alleles,
respectively. DNA from the above amplification was purified using a
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and subjected to
direct sequencing using the forward primer (above).
Construction of claudin-5 pcDNA3-EGFP
Two human claudin-5 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) with 3′-UTRs
containing the g and c alleles of Snp rs10314, respectively, were synthe-
sized by GeneArt (Dublin, Ireland) and subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI site
of pcDNA3-EGFP (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Polysome analysis
Hek293 were grown to 70% confluency, and polysome extracts were
prepared as previously described23 with the following modifications, 0.5%
(v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml RNasin was added to the lysis buffer.
Cyclohexamide (CHX) of 100 μg/ml was added to cells and then incubated
on ice water for 30 min. Cells were subsequently scraped into 10 ml PBS
and 100 μg/ml CHX. The cells were pelleted at 400 g for 4 min and then
resuspended in lysis buffer. Following this, the cells were lysed further
with a 25 gauge needle and left on ice for 10 min. Extracts were layered
onto 15–50% sucrose gradients. The gradients were sedimented via
centrifugation at 40 000 r.p.m. in a Beckman (Clare, Ireland) ultracentrifuge
for 2.5 h, and the A254 was measured continuously to give the traces
shown. Fourteen fractions were collected across the gradient into two
volumes of trizol (Life Technologies, Dublin, Ireland), and the RNA was
extracted, precipitated and resuspended in diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated
water. cDNA was prepared and real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out; from this, claudin-5 transcript
levels in each fraction were determined as a percentage of total RNA.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis
Transcript levels were quantified using a two-step RT-PCR on the 7300 real-
time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Dublin, Ireland) with QuantiTect
SYBR Green I (Qiagen) as a fluorescent dye. cDNA was reverse-transcribed
from RNA with the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed with the FastStart Universal
SYBR Green Master (ROX) master mix (Roche, Dublin, Ireland). The RT-PCR
reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C × 10 min, (95 °C × 10 s, 60 °C
× 30 s) × 40, 95 °C × 15 s, 60 °C × 1 min, 95 °C × 15 s, 60 °C × 15 s. The primer
sequences for the RT-PCR experiments were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich
(Wicklow, Ireland) and were as follows: claudin-5 left, 5′-TTTCTTCTATGC
GCAGTTGG-3′, and right, 5′-GCAGTTTGGTGCCTACTTCA-3′; β-actin left,
5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′ and right, 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCA
TTGCCAATGG-3′. Relative gene expression levels were measured using the
comparative CT method (ΔΔCT). Expression levels of target genes were
normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin.
Cell culture and transfection
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum in a
5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. One day before transfection, HEK293 cells were
seeded on 12-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells per well). The next day, 500 ng of
plasmid containing wild-type or rs10314 claudin-5 cDNA was transfected
per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Dublin, Ireland). Mouse
brain
endothelial
cells
(Bend.3,

Type
Culture
Collection,
Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and 2 mM sodium pyruvate in a
5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Bend.3 cells were seeded on 12-well plates
(2.5 × 105 cells per well) and 100 ng/ml claudin-5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
was transfected per well using Lipofectamine 2000. RNA was extracted
from HEK293 cells and Bend.3 cells with the E.Z.N.A Total RNA Kit 1 (Omega
biotek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Proteins were isolated with lysis buffer (62.5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 10 mM
dithiothreitol, 10 μl protease inhibitor cocktail/100 ml (Sigma-Aldrich),
followed by centrifugation at 12 000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 °C and
supernatant was removed for claudin-5 protein analysis.
Adeno-associated virus production
shRNAs designed to target transcripts derived from mouse claudin-5 were
incorporated into adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2/9 vectors. shRNA was
cloned into the pSingle-tTS-shRNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA)
vector. The plasmid incorporating the inducible system with claudin-5
shRNA was digested with BsrBi and BsrGI, and ligated into the Not1 site of
the plasmid pAAV-MCS, such as to incorporate left and right AAV-inverted
terminal repeats. (L-ITR and R-ITR). AAV-2/9 was then generated using a
triple transfection system in a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line for the
generation of high-titre viruses (Vector BioLabs, Malvern, PA, USA).
Injection of AAV for claudin-5 suppression in the hippocampus
and medial prefrontal cortex
C57/BL6J mice (8–12 weeks old) were anaesthetized using a ketamine/
metadomidine mixture administered via intraperitoneal injection and
placed in a stereotaxic frame. An incision was made to expose the skull,
and burr holes were made using a surgical drill either above the dorsal
hippocampus or the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A Hamilton syringe
was loaded with an AAV expressing either a shRNA against claudin-5 or a
non-targeting (NT) control, and the needle was slowly lowered into the
dorsal hippocampus: (co-ordinates: A/P = − 1.9 mm; M/L = ± 1.55 mm; D/
V = 1.75 mm, or mPFC: (co-ordinates: A/P = +1.9 mm; M/l = ± 0.4 mm; D/
V = 2.5 mm). AAV solution of 2.0 μl was then injected at a rate of 0.5 μl per
min, and once complete, the needle was left in place for 5 min before
repeating the procedure in the other hemisphere. Anaesthesia was
reversed with an intraperitoneal injection of atipamezole and placed in

 an incubator until recovered. All mice were given 7 days of recovery
before introducing doxycycline into their drinking water (2 mg/ml in 2%
sucrose solution). Doxycycline treatment was continued for the length of
the behavioural experiments, with behavioural testing beginning 14 days
after the introduction of doxycycline to drinking water to ensure maximal
suppression of claudin-5. Behavioural testing was then performed for
~ 4 weeks before animals were killed for histological and molecular
analysis. In addition to mice used for behavioural experiments (see below),
a small cohort were injected with an AAV-expressing green fluorescent
protein to visualize the extent of AAV localization following injection.
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry
HEK293 cells and Bend.3 cells were seeded on 1% fibronectin-coated Nunc
Lab-Tek II Chamber Slides (Thermo Scientific, Dublin, Ireland) in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium. After plasmid or shRNA transfection, cells were fixed
for 10 min at room temperature with ice-cold methanol, washed twice with
PBS and incubated with 5% normal goat serum before overnight incubation
with polyclonal rabbit anti-claudin-5 (1:100). Cells were then washed twice
with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 2 h at room temperature and
counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclei.
Mice were killed and the brains quickly removed. One hemisphere was
embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (VWR, Dublin, Ireland),
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C prior to slicing on a
cryostat. Mouse brain cryosections (12 μm thick) were post-fixed in ice-cold
methanol for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS.
Sections were then incubated with 5% normal goat serum before overnight
incubation with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-claudin-5 1:100, rabbit anti-
ZO-1 1:100 and rabbit anti-occludin 1:100, Life Technologies). Sections were
double-stained with isolectin-IB4-Alexa Fluor 488 1:300, Life Technologies, to
label vessels. For permeability experiments, sections were incubated with
Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human fibrino-
gen 1:100, DAKO, or Cy3-conjugated streptavidin 1:100, Sigma-Aldrich,
overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes in PBS, sections were incubated
with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500; Abcam)
for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS and counter-
stained with Hoechst 33258 for 30 s at a dilution of 1:10 000 of a stock 1 mg/
ml solution to visualize nuclei. Sections were mounted and coverslipped with
Aqua Poly/mount (Polysciences, Washington, PA, USA). Sections were
imaged with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope
(Cambridge, MA, USA). TJ signal intensity was quantified with the region
of interest defined by isolectin-IB4 staining. For biotin and fibrinogen
quantification, the average signal intensity of 10 regions of interest outside
the blood vessels was normalized to the average signal intensity of 10
regions of interest within the blood vessels. All image analysis was
performed in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, USA).

Primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell isolation
Microvessels were isolated from cortical grey matter of C57BL/6J mice by
collagenase/dispase (Roche) digestion and bovine serum albumin density
gradient centrifugation. Purified vessels were seeded onto collagen IV/
fibronectin-coated tissue-culture plates or Corning (Corning, NY, USA) HTS
24-well Transwell polyester inserts (0.4 μm pore size, vessels from five
mouse brains per 3 ml) at high density. Cells were grown in EGM2-MV
(Lonza, Cambridge, UK) (with 5 μg/ml puromycin during the first 3 days for
endothelial cell selection) for 2–3 weeks until their transendothelial
electrical resistance values plateaued.
Drug treatments
Haloperidol, lithium chloride and chlorpromazine were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Confluent primary mBMEC cells were treated with 0.2, 2 and
20 μM chlorpromazine, or haloperidol diluted in culture medium containing
0.1% DMSO, and 0.1, 1 and 10 mM lithium diluted in culture medium. For
in vivo injections, haloperidol and chlorpromazine were diluted in 2.5%
polyethylene glycol 400 in saline and 200 μl was injected via tail vein at a
dose of 1 mg/kg body weight. Lithium was diluted in saline and injected at
a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. Animals were killed 24 h following
injection, and tissues were processed for protein and RNA analysis.
Generation of inducible claudin-5 knockdown mice
Mice were generated by standard blastocyst injection24 at Charles Rivers
Laboratory (Mayo, Ireland) using their strict VAF/EliteTM health standards.
A doxycyline -inducible claudin-5 shRNA (160 variant) was inserted at the
Col1a1 locus on chromosome 11. In addition, a CAG-lox-stop-lox-rtTA3-
IRESmKate2 (CLR3K) allele was knocked in at the endogenous Rosa26 locus
on chromosome 6. This gene utilizes the endogenous Rosa26 promoter to
drive expression of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator
(M2rtTA), once mice are crossed to a Cre-recombinase expressing
mouse.25–27 Mice were maintained as homozygous for the claudin-5
shRNA-containing gene and the rtTA gene. When required for experiments,
mice were crossed to transgenic Tie-2-Cre expressing animals and Cre-
negative mice were used as littermate controls.
For behavioural experiments, all mice (Cre-positive and Cre-negative)
were given doxycycline in their drinking water (2 mg/ml in 2% sucrose
solution) and kept on doxycycline for the length of the behavioural
experiments. Behavioural testing began 14 days after the introduction of
doxycycline to drinking water to ensure maximal suppression of claudin-5.
Behavioural testing was then performed for ~ 4 weeks before animals were
killed for histological and molecular analysis.
Magnetic resonance imaging
BBB integrity was assessed in vivo via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
using a dedicated small rodent 7 T MRI system located at TCD (www.
neuroscience.tcd.ie/technologies/mri.php). Anaesthetized mice were phy-
siologically monitored (electrocardiogram, respiration and temperature)
and placed on an MRI-compatible support cradle, with a built-in system for
maintaining the animal’s body temperature at 37 °C. The cradle was then
positioned within the MRI scanner. Accurate positioning was ensured by
acquiring an initial rapid pilot image, which was then used to ensure the
correct geometry was scanned in all subsequent MRI experiments. Upon
insertion into the MRI scanner, high-resolution anatomical images of the
brain were acquired (100 μm in-plane and 500 μm through-plane spatial
resolution). To visualize brain damage and lesion volumes, high-resolution
images were acquired using Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhance-
ment (RARE) 2-D sequence with a RARE factor of 8 and an echo time
resulting in an effective time of 42.2 ms (with a flip angle of 180 ). With an
acquisition matrix of 128 × 128 and a field of view of 1.8 × 1.8 cm2, the pixel
resolution was 0.141 mm per pixel. In the coronal plane, 15 slices, each
measuring 0.25 mm in thickness were acquired. Repetition time was
7274.2 ms, and four averages were used for a total measuring time of
7 min 45 s.
Compromises of the BBB were then visualized in high-resolution T1-
weighted MR images (resolution, 0.156 × 0.156 × 5 mm3; field of view:
20 × 20 × 17.9 mm3; matrix: 128 × 128 × 30; TR/TE: 500/2.7 ms; flip angle: 30;
number of averages: 3; acquisition time: 2 min, 24 s; repetitions: 12),
following administration of 100 μl of a 1 in 3 dilution of Gd-DTPA
(gadolinium diethylene-triamine penta-acetic acid), administered via the tail
vein. Image analysis was performed in ImageJ, where regions of interest were
drawn and signal intensity changes were measured as mean pixel intensity
and normalized to the signal intensity prior to injection of Gd-DTPA.
Electroretinography analysis of mice
Cre-positive Cl5-160 mice were dark-adapted overnight and prepared for
electroretinography under dim red light. Pupillary dilation was carried out
by instillation of 1% cyclopentalate and 2.5% phenylephrine. Animals were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (2.08 mg per
15 g body weight) and xylazine (0.21 mg per 15 g body weight).
Standardized flashes of light were presented to the mouse in a Ganzfeld
bowl to ensure uniform retinal illumination. The electroretinography
responses were recorded simultaneously from both eyes by means of gold
wire electrodes (Roland Consult, Brandenburg, Germany) using Vidisic (Dr
Mann Pharma, Berlin, Germany) as a conducting agent and to maintain
corneal hydration.
Acoustic prepulse inhibition
Sensorimotor gating was assessed by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the
acoustic startle response. The PPI apparatus consisted of a soundproof PPI
chamber with a weighing scale positioned in the centre of the chamber
beside a loudspeaker. Mice were maintained in a holding chamber placed
on the scale. Each mouse was given 2 days to habituate to the holding
chamber and PPI chamber with a constant background white noise

 (65 dB). Before the beginning of the experiment, all instruments were
calibrated and startle stimulus (71, 77, 83, 100, 110, 120 dB) were set. PPI
was divided into three stages:
1 Two minutes habituation with constant background noise of 65 dB.
2 Presentation of prepulse (71, 77, 83 dB) and pulse (100, 110, 120 dB)
intensities, to habituate animals to startle stimulus.
3 Ten blocks of random combinations of prepulse alone, pulse alone,
prepulse plus pulse and no stimulus trials.
Startle stimulus were presented as 20 ms bursts of white noise with an
interstimulus (time between presentation of prepulse and pulse stimuli)
interval of 100 ms. Data were averaged across the 10 blocks for each
prepulse, pulse, prepulse plus pulse and no stimulus trial, and PPI was
calculated as:
%PPI = 100 × (pulse − prepulse plus pulse)/pulse.
Human brain sections
Free-floating 60 μm-thick sections of post-mortem human brain tissue
from 24 deceased schizophrenia patients and 24 age-matched controls
were obtained from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. In addition to
information relating to their schizophrenia diagnosis, the data accom-
panying these samples also included genotype information. Sections were
washed in PBS and antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections
for 2 × 5 min in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween
20, pH 6.0). Sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100; blocked
with 5% NGS; and incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-claudin-5 (1:50;
Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) for 48 h at 4 °C. Brain sections were incubated
with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300, Abcam) for 3 h at room
temperature and counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Z-stacks were
acquired with identical acquisition settings across samples and three-
dimensional images were rendered with ImageJ 3D viewer. Staining and
microscopy were performed blind to diagnosis. Quantification of claudin-5
staining (intensity and continuity) in these samples was performed using
software designed for assessing blood vessel networks (Angiogenesis
Analyser plug-in for ImageJ, National Institutes of Health). Briefly, the red
channel (claudin-5) from the confocal images (at × 10 magnification) was
isolated and was processed to reduce background staining. The software
was then set to map the blood vessels present in each section and the
total length of the vessels was quantified (number of pixels). This
quantified data was analysed based on diagnosis and genotype.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test, with significance
represented by a P-value of ⩽ 0.05. For multiple comparisons, analysis of
variance was used with a Tukey–Kramer post-test and significance
represented by a P-value of ⩽ 0.05. G*Power was used to choose sample
size and ensure adequate power for experiments.

Individuals with 22q11DS display a distinctive set of develop-
mental defects that can include cardiac abnormalities, intellectual
disabilities and distinctive craniofacial patterning (Figure 1a). The
condition is characterized genetically by microdeletions within

association was also observed in other studies.29–31 Following
sequencing across the remaining claudin-5 allele from a cohort of
67 22q11DS patients, a weak nominal association (*P = 0.0388,
two-sided χ2-test) between the claudin-5 variant (rs10314) and
those 22q11DS patients who went on to develop schizophrenia
was observed (Figure 1c).
Highest frequencies for the derived allele at rs10314 in modern
populations (1000 Genomes Project Consortium) are observed to
occur in Eastern Eurasia and Siberia (~31%), with notable peaks
occurring in Northeast Siberian populations such as the Even,
Evenki, Koryak and Yakut (42–67%) (Supplementary Figures 1 and
2 and Supplementary Table 1), with lowest frequencies observed
in Afro-Asiatic speaking groups of Western Asia (3.23%).

ing that individuals with 22q11DS carrying the rs10314 variant
may express up to 75% less claudin-5 at their BBB than the general
population (50% for 22q11DS with the wild-type variant due to
haploinsufficiency and down by 75% for 22q11DS with the
rs10314 variant on top of haploinsufficiency). Interestingly, the
variant claudin-5 was less evident at the plasma membrane of
transfected cells, with positive immunoreactivity observed in
perinuclear bodies, possibly lysosomes (Figure 1e). There was

 however no difference in the levels of claudin-5 transcript over
96 h (Figure 1f), suggesting this variant confers a change in the
post-translational processing or stability of the protein product.
Transfection of the normal or variant constructs in cells with well-
established TJs (Caco-2 cells) showed the same decrease in
claudin-5 expression (Supplementary Figure 3).
The rs10314 SNP is a G to a C base change in the 3′-UTR of the
claudin-5 gene. In this regard, we sought to examine if micro RNA
(miRNA)-binding sites were impacted in any way. In the absence
of miR-3934 or miR-125a-3p, two miRNAs in which that variant
confers novel binding, the normal variant expresses significantly
more
promoter
activity
compared
to
the
rs10314
variant
(*Po0.05 and **Po0.01 for the respective miRNAs). However,
in the presence of either miRNA, there were no significant
differences in promoter binding between the normal and rs10314
variants (Figures 1g and h). Isolation of polysome fractions
however showed a distinct shift in the levels of claudin-5
transcript in the rs10314 variant to the sub-polysome fractions,
suggesting efficient translation is being impacted upon (Figure 1i).
Site-specific and chronic suppression of claudin-5 induces distinct

Such is the impact of the BBB on neural integrity, it can be
suggested that each neuron is essentially perfused by its own
capillary.

 hippocampus (Figure 2b) or mPFC (Figure 2c) with AAV-expressing
claudin-5 shRNA or a NT AAV as outlined. Claudin-5 levels were
significantly suppressed following supplementation of doxycycline
in the water of mice both in the hippocampus (*Po0.05,
Figures 2d and e) and mPFC (**Po0.01, Figures 2f and g).
Claudin-5 suppression did not trigger vascular remodelling events
as measured by the total stained length of isolectin-IB4 vessels in
NT or claudin-5 AAV-injected groups (Supplementary Figure 4c).
Suppression of claudin-5 in the hippocampus or mPFC had no

(340 kDa) in both the hippocampus (**Po0.01, Figures 2h and i)
and mPFC (**Po0.01, Figures 2j and k).
Intriguingly, a range of behavioural changes were observed in
mice across five domains (learning and memory; depression;
anxiety; social behaviour; and locomotor activity). Suppression of
claudin-5 in the hippocampus led to a significant impairment in
performance in the social novelty task (*Po0.05) and a significant
decrease
in

of
changes in affect (Figure 2l). Suppression of claudin-5 in the

 in recognition memory (**Po0.01) and working spatial memory
(*Po0.05) in addition to non-significant impairments in perfor-
mance in the Y-maze and radial arm maze (Figure 2m). In addition,
claudin-5
suppression
in

significantly
enhanced
performance in the forced swim test (***Po0.001), with mice
spending less time immobile compared to controls. Given the lack
of hyperlocomotion measured on other tests, this is suggestive of
increased resilience to the stress associated with the task. More

readouts
from
these
experiments
are
outlined
in
Supplementary Figure 6.
Generation and characterization of inducible claudin-5
knockdown mice
As claudin-5 knockout mice die within hours of birth,33 we
generated a mouse model that allows for inducible RNAi-based
suppression of claudin-5 levels at the BBB. We first identified two
shRNAs, 160 and 580, that would sufficiently suppress transcript
and protein levels of claudin-5 in vitro versus untreated and NT
controls (Figures 3a and b). Subsequently, we generated mice
such that a gene containing a doxycycline-inducible claudin-5 160
shRNA was inserted at the Col1a1 locus on chromosome 11. In
addition, a CAG-lox-stop-lox-rtTA3-IRESmKate2 (CLR3K) allele was
knocked in at the endogenous Rosa26 locus on chromosome 6.
This gene utilizes the endogenous Rosa26 promoter to drive
expression of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator
(M2rtTA), once mice are crossed to a Cre-recombinase expressing
mouse.25–27 When we cross the bi-allelic mice outlined above to
Tie-2-Cre mice (Figure 3c), animals that are Cre-positive show
significantly decreased levels of claudin-5 protein in their brain
when
administered
doxycycline
in
their
diet
(***Po0.001;
Figure 3d) in addition to significantly lower levels of claudin-5
messenger RNA (***Po0.001). In addition, using mKate (red) and
green fluorescent protein (green) reporter genes, confirmation of
rtTA and claudin-5 shRNA expression specifically in endothelial
cells was assessed. Suppression of claudin-5 did not significantly
impact on the levels of expression of other TJ components such as
ZO-1, occludin or tricellulin, either in the amount of translated
protein or at the transcript level (Figures 3h–j). Finally, suppression
of claudin-5 had a significant impact on the animals’ lifespan;
persistent suppression of claudin-5 in adult mice led to mortality
across all animals in this study within 40 days, unlike Cre-negative
littermate controls, inducible claudin-5 mice housed with normal
drinking water, and mice expressing a scrambled NT shRNA on
doxycycline (Figure 3k). This persistent suppression of claudin-5
also induced very distinct phenotypic readouts in the 48 h prior to
death, including behavioural arrest, tail flicking and hyperlocomo-
tion (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).
Inducible claudin-5 knockdown mice display characteristic
features of schizophrenia
Inducible knockdown mice showed significant impairments in
learning and memory tasks, with performance in the T-maze
(*Po0.05) and object recognition task (*Po0.05) particularly
affected (Figures 4a and b). Performance in the spontaneous
alternation task in the Y-maze was unimpaired due to the
development of a significant side bias (*Po0.05; Figure 4d). These
mice also displayed increased anxiety-like behaviour as assessed
by a significant reduction in open arm entries in the elevated plus
maze (*Po0.05; Figure 4c). While there were trends towards
depression-like symptoms, decreased social activity and increased
locomotion, none of these reached significance and are summar-
ized in Figure 4f. Detailed readouts from these experiments are
outlined in Supplementary Figure 12. Importantly, these mice did
not have any visual deficits that may have impacted behaviour as
examined by electroretinography measurements (Supplementary
Figure 15).
Acoustic PPI is a sensorimotor gating phenomenon that is
preserved across species and has previously been shown to
strongly associate with schizophrenia. Indeed, numerous pro-
posed mouse models of schizophrenia use acoustic PPI as a
correlate of a schizophrenia-like phenotype. Here, we show that
mice lacking sufficient claudin-5 at the BBB display a reduced
acoustic PPI response with a 77 dB prepulse at 110 dB (**Po0.01)
and 120 dB (*Po0.05; Figure 4e). Taken together, the behavioural
data presented here suggest a profound link between the gene-
dosage
effect
of
claudin-5
and
manifestations
of
many
schizophrenia-associated symptoms.
Finally, in vivo measurements of BBB permeability were
performed using contrast-enhanced MRI. In claudin-5-suppressed
animals, gadolinium extravasation lead to significantly increased
contrast in the acquired images (**Po0.01) compared to NT
control mice (Figure 4g). In addition, there was significantly
increased extravasation of fibrinogen throughout the brains of
claudin-5 suppressed animals (**Po0.01) compared to littermate
controls (Supplementary Figure 16).
Anti-psychotic drugs regulate claudin-5 levels and claudin-5
expression is aberrant in human schizophrenia patients
It is known that systemic biomarkers of BBB dysfunction are
increased in individuals with schizophrenia. Evidence for micro-
vascular dysfunction has also previously been linked with the
condition,34 however, a distinct molecular genetic link between
endothelial cell dysfunction and schizophrenia has been lacking.
We examined the effects of some of the most common anti-
psychotic drugs on claudin-5 levels both in vitro in primary brain
endothelial cell cultures and in vivo in wild-type c57/BL6 mice. We
found that lithium, haloperidol and chlorpromazine all signifi-
cantly increased levels of claudin-5 protein in a dose-dependent
manner in vitro (Figure 5a) with no obvious changes in the
expression pattern of claudin-5 (Figure 5b). In vivo, we found
similar increases in claudin-5 following anti-psychotic administra-
tion with significant increases in protein expression for all drugs
(*Po0.05; Figures 5c and d) and in messenger RNA transcription
for chlorpromazine alone (*Po0.05; Figure 5e). We also examined
the impact of these drugs on the levels of other TJ components,
and found that lithium and haloperidol increased levels of
occludin
(*Po0.05)
but
not
ZO-1
in
vitro
(Supplementary
Figures 17a–c), while chlorpromazine alone increased levels of
ZO-1 (*Po0.05) in vivo (Supplementary Figures 17d–f). To explore
whether these drugs were affecting claudin-5 expression through
Wnt signalling, we analysed downstream components of this
signalling and found that levels of Axin-2 and Sox17 expression
were unaffected (Supplementary Figure 18).
In addition, we examined brain sections from the parietal lobe
of 24 schizophrenia donor brains and 24 age-matched normal
control brains (Supplementary Figure 19). We stained for claudin-5
levels in brain sections, and assessed pattern and density of
staining in a blinded manner. While overall levels of protein were
not changed, an aberrant pattern of claudin-5 immunoreactivity
was observed in 62% of the schizophrenia cases—usually claudin-
5 is continuously expressed across the length of a blood vessel,
but was discontinuous in many of the samples taken from
individuals with schizophrenia (Figure 5f). Quantification of
claudin-5 expression in blood vessels revealed that, while there
were no significant differences between the diagnosis groups in
the absence of the rs10314 variant, claudin-5 levels were
significantly lower in individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
who had the rs10314 variant compared to control subjects who
harboured the rs10314 variant (*Po0.05, Figure 5g).

 DISCUSSION
Current treatment options for schizophrenia patients largely and
almost exclusively include the use of anti-psychotic therapies and
adjunct
psychosocial
therapy,
including
psychotherapy
and
cognitive behavioural therapy. However, anti-psychotic drugs are
often discontinued by patients due to inefficacy or intolerable side
effects. In addition, the average life expectancy of people with
schizophrenia can be between 10–25 years less than normal, with
a recent meta-analysis suggesting up to 16 000 people die
annually as a result of having to live with the condition.35 There
is now a clear and urgent need to better understand the
underlying molecular aetiology of schizophrenia and to develop
new forms of therapy for this debilitating condition.
To our knowledge, this is the first molecular-based evidence of
the involvement of the BBB to be described in schizophrenia, and
brings together an environmental- and genetic-based model for
the molecular aetiology of schizophrenia. The protein product of
the claudin-5 gene is a four pass transmembrane protein
consisting of two extracellular loops that reside at the apical
periphery of contacting endothelial cells of the BBB. These
extracellular loops can respond to the microenvironment and
can allow for rapid remodelling of the TJ dependent on a range of
environmental stimuli.36
The underlying molecular complexity of the BBB and how it
relates to health and disease is only beginning to be unravelled.
Indeed, the BBB is not a static microenvironment, it is highly
dynamic
in
both
homoeostatic
physiology
and
indeed
in
pathology. At the BBB, claudin-5 is by far the dominant TJ
component, but claudin-3 and claudin-12 are also present. Our
understanding of the claudins has been considerably improved
through genetic knockout models. In particular, the role of
claudin-5 in forming the BBB was confirmed in mice genetically
engineered to lack claudin-5. Nitta et al.33 showed that claudin-5
knockout mice have an impaired BBB that was compromised in a
size-selective manner to molecules up to 800 Da in size. However,
complete ablation of claudin-5 is lethal, with mice dying within
hours of birth. Intriguingly, however, in claudin-5 knockout mice, a
barrier can still form and remains intact to molecules 4 ~ 1 kDa
molecular weight. Our data obtained from inducible ‘knockdown’
mice now suggests a link between the gene-dosage effect of
claudin-5 and the onset of schizophrenia-like characteristics in this
mouse model. This does not by any means suggest that variations
in claudin-5 is a direct cause of schizophrenia, but that it may be a
contributing factor in the development of schizophrenia. It is
known that claudin-5 levels are impacted in other neurological
disorders such as ischaemia and traumatic brain injury17 and
neurodegenerative disorders.37–39
While the original studies describing the association of the
rs10314 variant in the 3′-UTR of claudin-5 with schizophrenia in
the general population were weak, our studies here showing a
nominal association in a cohort of individuals with 22q11DS with a
single remaining claudin-5 allele are important. The central role of
claudin-5 at the BBB cannot be underestimated and it has been
Figure 5.

 identified as an ohnologue, or a gene duplicate originating from
whole-genome duplication. Pertinently, ohnologues represent
critical dosage-sensitive elements of the genome, responsible for
some of the deleterious phenotypes observed for pathogenic
copy-number variations and as such are readily identifiable
candidate genes for schizophrenia.40,41
Critically, it appears that some of the most common anti-
psychotic drugs can potently regulate claudin-5 protein levels in a
dose-dependent manner. These findings are important given the
fact that brain endothelial cells are the first membranous interface
these drugs encounter in the cerebrum post administration. This is
the first example of these drugs being biologically active in brain
endothelial cells and may be fundamental to their mode of action.
This is highly suggestive that these drugs can regulate the
integrity of the BBB and may go some way to explaining why
select drugs have efficacy in some patients and not others. In
addition, this suggests that claudin-5 may be a therapeutic target
for
schizophrenia,
with
drugs
that
regulate
its
expression
representing a more targeted and ultimately safer approach to
treatment.
At the anatomical level, the central pathological findings in the
brains of schizophrenia patients are centred on a distinct loss of
cortical grey matter, cortical thinning and reduced numbers of
synaptic structures on cortical pyramidal neurons.42 There are
however no pathognomonic markers of schizophrenia observable
at the histological level post-mortem. Here, we were able to
identify an aberrant pattern of claudin-5 immunoreactivity in 62%
of schizophrenia patient brains based on an analysis of claudin-5
levels.
Recognizing that schizophrenia is a disorder with a cerebral
vascular component will impact the way this condition is treated
and lead to improved medicines for patients living with the
condition. These findings will also lead to a greater understanding
of other neuropsychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and
affective disorders.
