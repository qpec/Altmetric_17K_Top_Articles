Carbonyl emissions from tobacco cigarettes represent a substantial health risk
contributing to smoking-related morbidity and mortality. As expected, this is an important
research topic for tobacco harm reduction products, in an attempt to compare the relative
risk of these products compared to tobacco cigarettes. In this study, a systematic review
of the literature available on PubMed was performed analyzing the studies evaluating
carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes. A total of 32 studies were identified and presented.
We identified a large diversity of methodologies, with substantial discrepancies in
puffing patterns, aerosol collection and analytical methods as well as reported units of
measurements. Such discrepancies make comparisons difficult, and in some cases the
accuracy of the findings cannot be determined. Importantly, control for the generation of
dry puffs was not performed in the vast majority of studies, particularly in studies using
variable power devices, which could result in testing conditions and reported carbonyl
levels that have no clinical relevance or context. Some studies have been replicated,
verifying the presence of dry puff conditions. Whenever realistic use conditions were
ensured, carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes were substantially lower than tobacco
cigarette smoke, while newer generation (bottom-coil, cotton wick) atomizers appeared
to emit minimal levels of carbonyls with questionable clinical significance in terms of
health risk. However, extremely high levels of carbonyl emissions were reported in some
studies, and all these studies need to be replicated because of potentially important
health implications.

INTRODUCTION
Tobacco cigarette smoking has well-documented adverse health effects. Due to difficulty in quitting
smoking, harm reduction products have been developed in an attempt to help smokers switch
to less harmful forms of nicotine intake. Historically, snus has been used as a tobacco harm
reduction product; substitution of snus for cigarette smoking has significantly contributed to
reducing smoking-related mortality in Sweden (Ramström and Wikmans, 2014). One of the main
determinants of the public health effects of a tobacco harm reduction product is its safety/risk
profile and levels of toxin exposure, with snus having a documented substantially lower risk
compared to smoking (Lee and Hamling, 2009; Vidyasagaran et al., 2016).

Carbonyls in e-cigarettes
E-cigarettes were invented in recent years, but awareness
and use has grown exponentially. They are currently considered
the most popular tobacco harm reduction product among
smokers. Limited research exists on the epidemiological effects
of e-cigarettes; thus most research is focused on chemical and
toxicological assessment (Farsalinos and Polosa, 2014). Carbonyl
emissions from e-cigarettes represent a research subject that
has generated a lot of interest. High levels of carbonyls are
emitted in tobacco cigarette smoke, mainly derived from the
thermal degradation of sugars due to the high temperatures of
combustion during smoking (Rustemeier et al., 2002; Counts
et al., 2005; Baker et al., 2006; Paschke et al., 2014). Formaldehyde
is classified as a group 1 carcinogen for humans by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer while other
carbonyls such as acrolein and acetaldehyde are also listed
as toxic or carcinogenic (US OSHA, 2007, 2011). The main
ingredients in e-cigarette liquids, propylene glycol (PG) and
glycerol (VG) are known to be oxidized to carbonyls (Bekki
et al., 2014; Spencer and Lauterbach, 2015). As a result, evaluating
carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes is an important step in
determining the both the absolute and relative (to smoking)
risk of e-cigarettes, especially considering the variability of
performance characteristics designs and functional patterns of
different e-cigarette devices. The purpose of this study was
to perform a systematic review of the literature on carbonyl
emissions from e-cigarettes.
METHODS
This systematic review was performed through a search on
PubMed electronic database for English language articles without
any date restriction. This review focused on the main toxic
carbonyls that are found at high levels in tobacco cigarette
smoke, namely formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein,
and crotonaldehyde. The search terms on PubMed (title and/or
abstract) were: [e-cigarette(s) OR Electronic cigarette(s) OR
electronic nicotine delivery system] AND [aldehyde(s) OR
carbonyl(s) OR formaldehyde OR acetaldehyde OR acrolein OR
acetone OR crotonaldehyde]. The Prisma Flow Diagram for the
search is shown in Figure 1. The PubMed search resulted in 96
studies. After careful review of the titles, abstracts and full text,
66 studies were excluded, while two additional studies (which
did not include the terms of the search in the title or abstract)
was found from the citations of other studies. The current review
presents the findings from 32 published studies.
Published Studies on Carbonyl Emissions
from e-cigarettes
Uchiyama et al. (2010) analyzed an e-cigarette from the Japanese
market for the presence of carbonyls in the aerosol. They used
coupled silica cartridges impregnated with hydroquinone and 2,3
dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to trap carbonyls, and analysis
was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). The levels of carbonyl emissions were reported as
amount per m3. A puff flow rate of 500 mL/min was reported,
but no information on puff duration and interpuff interval was
provided. Formaldehyde was detected at levels of 8.3 mg/m3,
acetaldehyde at 11 mg/m3, acetone at 2.9 mg/m3, and acrolein
at 9.3 mg/m3.
Uchiyama et al. (2013) analyzed 13 brands of e-cigarettes for
the levels of carbonyl emissions using coupled silica cartridges
impregnated with hydroquinone and DNPH. The analysis was
performed with HPLC. The e-cigarettes were puffed based on
Health Canada Intense puffing regime (55 mL puff volume,
2 s puff duration, 30 s interpuff interval) and the levels were
reported as amount per m3. Formaldehyde levels varied from
non-detected to 61 mg/m3, acetaldehyde from non-detected to
48 mg/ m3, and acrolein from non-detected to 36 mg/ m3.
Other carbonyls such as propanal, and glyoxal were also detected
in some products. The authors noted that large variations in
carbonyl levels were detected, not only among different brands
but also among different samples of the same brand, while 4 of
the 13 brands did not generate any carbonyl emissions above the
method detection limit.
Goniewicz et al. (2014) tested 12 different e-cigarette brands,
in most cases first generation products that are today considered
outdated. They also tested a medicinal nicotine inhalator as
reference product. A relatively short puff duration (1.8 s) and
interpuff interval (10 s) was used, while the puff volume was
70 mL. Carbonyls were trapped in tubes packed with solid
adsorbent and analysis was performed by HPLC with diode
array detector (HPLC-DAD). The study detected 4 of the 15
carbonyls that were tested. Values, expressed in amount per 150
puffs, ranged from 3.2 to 56.1 µg for formaldehyde (0.021–
0.374 µg/puff), 2.0 to 12.0 µg for acetaldehyde (0.013–0.080
µg/puff), non-detected to 41.9 µg for acrolein (0.279 µg/puff)
and 1.7 to 7.1 µg for o-methylbenzaldehyde (0.011–0.047
µg/puff). Small amounts of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and o-
methylbenzaldehyde were also found in the nicotine inhalator.
The authors compared the findings with literature data and on
tobacco cigarettes and reported that carbonyl emissions were 9-
to 450-fold lower in e-cigarettes.
The same research group performed a second study measuring
carbonyl emissions from 10 commercially available liquids using
different voltage settings (3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 V) in a variable-voltage
e-cigarette battery device (Kosmider et al., 2014). Also, different
mixtures of e-cigarette liquid solvents (PG, VG and a mixture of
both) without flavoring, proprietary prepared by the researchers,
were tested. The authors used a now-outdated CE4-type (top
coil, silica wick) atomizer. Aerosol was generated at 1.8 s puff
duration and 17 s interpuff interval, while puff volume was 70 mL.
Carbonyls were trapped in tubes packed with solid adsorbent
and analysis was performed by HPLC with diode array detector
(HPLC-DAD) and levels were reported as amount per 15 puffs.
Additionally, the battery button was manually activated 1 s before
the puff was taken. At least one carbonyl compound was detected
in all samples. Formaldehyde levels ranged from non-detected to
59 ng/15 puffs (3.99 ng/puff), acetaldehyde from non-detected to
107 ng/15 puffs (7.11 ng/puff) and acetone from non-detected
to 296 ng/15 puffs (19.73 ng/puff). Acrolein and crotonaldehyde
were not detected in any sample, while other carbonyls such as
butanal, isovaleric aldehyde, and m-methylbenzaldehyde were
detected in some samples. The authors identified that higher

levels of carbonyls were emitted from PG compared to VG-based
liquids. Additionally, carbonyl emissions increased at 4.8 V by 4-
to 200-fold compared to emissions at 3.2 V.
Hutzler et al. (2014) tested 7 commercial liquids for the
presence of carbonyls. Initially, the authors incubated the liquids
in headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
at various temperatures for 2 h. They reported an increase in
formaldehyde (up to 10- to 20-fold) and acetaldehyde levels
(up to 700-fold) at 150◦C incubation temperature compared
to 100◦C. Subsequently, they used a smoking machine and
generated aerosol using a first generation (“cigalike”) e-cigarette
device using a puffing regime of 55 mL puff volume, 3 s puff
duration and 30 s interpuff interval. Aerosol production and
collection (in impingers containing DNPH) was performed
in discreet 10-puff blocks (after an initial 50-puff block) and
continued until no visible aerosol was released from the
cartridges. Analysis was performed with HPLC-DAD. The
authors identified high levels of carbonyls which reached or
exceeded the respective levels in tobacco cigarettes during the
later puff blocks, reaching to ∼5 µg/puff for formaldehyde, 8
µg/puff for acetaldehyde and 3.5 µg/puff for acrolein. This was
attributed to the lower liquid levels within the cartridges.
Tayyarah and Long (2014) compared carbonyl emissions
from 5 e-cigarette (“cigalike”) products (2 disposable and 3
rechargeable) with 3 tobacco cigarette products. Health Canada
Intense puffing regime was used (55 mL volume, 2 s duration and
30 s interval). Aerosol was collected in two impingers connected
in series containing DNPH, and analysis was performed with
Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with ultraviolet
detection (UPLC-UV). Formaldehyde was not detected in any of
the products, while acetaldehyde was detected at levels of 0.32
µg/puff in 1 product and acrolein was detected in 2 products
at levels up to 0.19 µg/puff. Propionaldehyde was also detected
in 1 product at levels of 0.11 µg/puff. The levels found were
reported to be 86- to 544-fold lower than tobacco cigarette
smoke.

Carbonyls in e-cigarettes
Geiss et al. (2015) tested carbonyl emissions from 2
commercial e-cigarettes. The puffing regime was 35 mL volume,
4 s duration and 30 s interpuff interval. They used a 2 L Tedlar
gas-sampling bag to collect aerosol generated through a smoking
machine and then the aerosol was passed through DNPH-silica
cartridges. Analysis was performed using HPLC-DAD. Levels
ranged from 19.6 to 23.5 ng/puff for formaldehyde, 8.1 to 39.9
ng/puff for acetaldehyde, 2.7 to 8.8 ng/puff for acetone and 0.5
to 13.5 ng/puff for acrolein. Contrary to Kosmider et al. (2014),
higher levels of carbonyls were observed in the VG-based liquid
compared to a mixed PG-VG liquid.
In a study that generated a lot of publicity, Jensen et al.
(2015) tested a “tank system” e-cigarette with a commercial e-
cigarette liquid (Halo “café mocha” flavor, 6 mg/mL nicotine
concentration) for the presence of formaldehyde hemiacetals.
Hemiacetals are compounds formed from the reaction of PG or
VG with formaldehyde. The authors tested two voltage settings
(3.3 V and 5.0 V) and used NMR spectroscopy to measure the
compounds. The puffing regime was 50 mL volume, 4 s duration
and 30 s interpuff interval. No formaldehyde hemiacetals were
detected at 3.3 V, while at 5.0 V a mean level of 380 µg/10
puffs was detected. Despite mentioning that the behavior of
formaldehyde hemiacetals in the respiratory tract are unknown,
they assumed that the risk is similar to formaldehyde and
reported that the cancer risk of long term vaping was “5 times
as high... or even 15 times as high... as the risk associated with
long term smoking” when comparing 3 mL liquid consumption
with 20 tobacco cigarettes.
Laugesen (2015) tested 14 e-cigarette products purchased
online from China, USA, and UK. Twelve of the products were
first-generation (“cigalikes”) while two were tank systems. The
puffing protocol was 70 mL puff volume, 3 s puff duration and
10 s interpuff interval. Aerosol was collected in two impingers
connected in series that contained DNPH and analysis was
performed with HPLC with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV).
Levels of formaldehyde ranged from 0.48 to 2.5 µg/L of aerosol
volume, acetaldehyde from 0.58 to 1.52 µg/L and acrolein from
0.4 to 2.1 µg/L. The authors reported that the levels of carbonyls
were 100- to 2,800-fold lower compared to the smoke of a
commercial tobacco cigarette.
Farsalinos et al. (2015) measured carbonyl emissions from a
new-generation (rebuildable tank) atomizer at different power
settings. Two samples of the atomizer were prepared, one with
double wick (silica) and the other with single wick. The later was
intentionally prepared to generate overheating conditions (dry
puffs) at low power settings compared to the other atomizer.
For the first time in a study measuring carbonyl emissions in
e-cigarette aerosol, experienced vapers were recruited and tested
the atomizers to detect and report the power settings associated
with dry puffs (discussed below). Power settings from 6.5 to
10 W were tested, and emissions were substantially lower with
the double-wick compared to the single-wick atomizer. The
puffing protocol was 60 mL puff volume, 4 s puff duration and
30 s interpuff interval. Aerosol was collected in two impingers
connected in series that contained DNPH and analysis was
performed with HPLC with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV).
At 10 W, up to 30-fold higher formaldehyde, 50-fold higher
acetaldehyde and 200-fold higher acrolein was emitted from the
less efficient atomizer, which was identified as generating dry
puff at this power setting. Under normal vaping conditions,
low carbonyl levels were detected, with formaldehyde up to 11
µg/10 puffs, acetaldehyde up to 4.5 µg/10 puffs and acrolein
up to 1 µg/10 puffs. The levels were 7- to 300-fold lower
compared to literature data on tobacco cigarette smoke. The
authors concluded that, under verified realistic (no dry puff)
conditions, e-cigarettes emit low levels of carbonyls.
Herrington and Myers (2015) evaluated 4 commercially
available first generation e-cigarettes. They used a manually
handled gas-tight syringe to collect aerosol in thermal desorption
tubes using 40 mL puff volume, 4 s puff duration and 10 s
interpuff interval. The thermal desorption tubes were then
transferred to a thermal desorption unit coupled with a GC-
MS analytical system. Analysis was performed using Thermal
Desorption Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (TD-GC-
MS). The authors verified the presence of several carbonyls in
the aerosol such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and
acetone. However, they did not report the amount of carbonyls
emitted with the exception of acrolein which was found at levels
of 1.5–6.7 ppmv per 40 mL puff.
Blair et al. (2015) developed a fast-flow tube system that would
allow the real time measurements of volatile organic compounds
using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(PTRMS). A puff volume of 43 mL, puff duration of 2 s and
interpuff interval ranging from 15 to 60 s was used. Aerosol was
collected in a Teflon bag and a fast-flow tube setup was prepared.
Two e-cigarette products were tested, and most probably they
were first-generation products (although that was not clear from
the publication). The authors reported acetaldehyde levels at 95.9
µg/9 puffs, acetone at 22.0 µg/9 puffs and acrolein at 32 µg/9
puffs. Several standardized and commercial tobacco cigarettes
were also analyze, with acetaldehyde levels being 3- to 6-fold
higher, acetone 7- to 15-fold higher and acrolein up to 2-fold
higher.
Talih et al. (2016) tested a “dripping” atomizer (a product that
does not contain a tank but needs to regularly “drip” liquid from
the mouthpiece in order to keep the wick wet). A very old and
now-outdated dripping atomizer was used. The authors added
2 drops of e-cigarette liquid and took 2–4 puffs before refilling
the atomizer. An extreme 8 s puff volume was used for aerosol
generation while puff volume and interpuff interval were set
at 152.8 mL and 10 s, respectively. The aerosol was collected in
DNPH-coated silica cartridges and carbonyls were analyzed with
HPLC-MS. Temperature measurements were also performed,
using an infrared camera, and ranged from 130◦C (during the
first two puffs) to 340◦C (at the 4th puff). Interestingly, the
temperature was inversely correlated with aerosol yield (liquid
consumption per puff), with the 4th puff delivering 3-fold
less aerosol compared to the 1st puff and having the highest
temperature. Expectedly, temperature correlated with carbonyl
emissions. Formaldehyde was detected at levels from 19.7 to
88.06 µg/15 puffs, acetaldehyde at 269.35 to1172.23 µg/15 puffs,
acetone at 22.28 to 196.55 µg/15 puffs and acrolein at non-
detected to 1.97 µg/15 puffs. The levels reported exceeded in
some cases the emissions from tobacco cigarettes.

Carbonyls in e-cigarettes
Flora et al. (2016) examined the aerosol of 4 variants of a
commercially available first-generation e-cigarette. The puffing
protocol was 55 mL puff volume, 4 s puff duration and 30 s
interpuff interval. Aerosol from 20 puffs was collected in two
impingers connected in series that contained DNPH and analysis
was performed with UPLC-UV. Formaldehyde was detected at
levels from 0.09 to 0.33 µg/puff while acetaldehyde was detected
below the LOQ (<0.71 µg/puff). Acrolein and crotonaldehyde
were not detected in the aerosol.
Gillman et al. (2016) tested 5 refillable tank-type e-cigarette
devices at different power settings for carbonyl emissions.
Devices included an outdated top coil, silica wick atomizer
(“CE4”) which had been used in a previous study (Jensen et al.,
2015) and some newer generation bottom coil, cotton wick
atomizers. The authors presented in detail the characteristics
of each device tested and reported that the minimum level of
liquid allowed in the atomizer during the aerosol collection was
at 50% of the tank capacity. A proprietary liquid composed of
PG, VG, and nicotine (no flavorings) was used in the study.
Power settings ranged from 5.2 to 25 W. Four power settings
were tested with each atomizer. A smoking machine was used to
generate aerosol and the puffing regime was 55 mL puff volume,
4 s puff duration and 30 s interpuff interval. The authors also
weighed the atomizer before and after aerosol collection in order
to determine liquid consumption, and carbonyl emissions were
reported per g of liquid consumption (they also reported levels as
amount per puff). A substantial variability in carbonyl emissions
was observed between atomizers. Newer generation atomizers
emitted formaldehyde from 0.02 to 0.08 mg/g, acetaldehyde from
0.006 to 0.08 mg/g and acrolein from non-detected to 0.06
mg/g. The CE4 atomizer released orders of magnitude higher
carbonyl levels compared to other atomizers, with formaldehyde
ranging from 2.1 to 7.3 mg/g, acetaldehyde from 1.7 to 5.8
mg/g and acrolein from 0.05 to 0.78 mg/g. Large variability
in liquid consumption per puff was observed between different
atomizers and power settings, ranging from 1.5 to 28 mg per
puff. The authors explained that when higher power resulted in
substantially increased liquid consumption per puff, the levels
of carbonyls remained low. Contrary to that, smaller increases
in liquid consumption per puff were associated increased
carbonyl emissions, probably due to liquid overheating and
decomposition of PG and VG. Finally, the authors explained
that the actual exposure is also limited by the dry puff
phenomenon causing an unpleasant taste that users detect and
avoid.
Jo and Kim (2016) tested an e-cigarette available in the Korean
market for the present of carbonyls in the aerosol. The puff
volume was 33.4 mL, the puff duration 2 s and the interpuff
interval 10 s. Five, ten, and fifteen puffs per collection were
obtained. Carbonyls were trapped in DNPH cartridges, and
analyzed using HPLC-UV. In general, low levels of aldehydes
were detected (reported as amount per volume of e-liquid), with
formaldehyde ranging from 2.03 to 9.17 µg/mL, acetaldehyde
from 7.76 to 14.4 µg/mL and acetone from 0.65 to 1.26 µg/mL.
Acrolein was not detected in any of the samples. The authors
reported that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were substantially
higher in the aerosol compared to the liquid, which is expected
since the main source of these compounds is the thermal
degradation of PG and VG.
Geiss et al. (2016) tested a new generation, variable power,
e-cigarette device at different power settings (from 5 to 25 W)
with a commercial liquid to determine carbonyl emissions.
Additionally, the temperature of the coil was monitored by
infrared thermography and an experienced vaper provided
feedback on the subjective quality of the emitted aerosol. The
puff volume was 50 mL, the puff duration 3 s and the interpuff
interval 20 s. Carbonyls were trapped on cartridges filled with
DNPH-coated silica gel adsorbent and analysis was performed
by HPLC/UV. Of note, different cartridges were tested and
some created significant pressure drop which interferes with the
airflow through the e-cigarette device and thus are unsuitable
for collecting aerosol from e-cigarettes. The authors found that
aldehyde emissions increased steeply from 15 W upwards with a
further steep increase at 20 W; however, the vaper identified as
borderline the taste at 15 W and perceived the flavor as different
and the vapor as too hot from 20 W upwards. At 20 W, the
temperature of the coil exceeded 300◦C. Formaldehyde levels
ranged from 24.2 to 1599.9 ng/puff, acetaldehyde from 13.2 to
348.4 ng/puff and acrolein from non-detected to 2.5 ng/puff (the
latter at 25 W only). Tobacco cigarettes emitted 7-fold higher
formaldehyde and 600-fold higher acetaldehyde levels compared
to the e-cigarette at 15 W.
Uchiyama et al. (2016) evaluated carbonyl emissions from
10 brands of second-generation e-cigarettes available in Japan.
Aerosol was generated using Health Canada Intense puffing
regime and was collected with a Cambridge filter and sorbent
cartridge packed with Carboxen-572 particles connected in
series. The puff volume was 55 mL, the puff duration 2 s and
the interpuff interval 30 s. Analysis was performed by HPLC-
UV. The authors noted that aldehyde emissions increased after
the first 11–15 puffs and then reached a steady-state. They
also reported substantial increases in carbonyl emissions above
4.0 V, while from 3.2 to 4.0 V carbonyl emissions were very
low. Of note, aerosol yield gradually increased at higher voltage
setting but decreased from 4.4 to 4.8 V, a clear indication of
insufficient liquid in the coil that can generate dry puff conditions
(Farsalinos et al., 2015; Gillman et al., 2016). Formaldehyde
ranged from non-detected to 790 µg/10 puffs, acetaldehyde from
non-detected to 520 µg/10 puffs, acetone from non-detected to
64 µg/10 puffs and acrolein from non-detected to 99 µg/10 puffs.
Other carbonyls such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal were also
detected.
Havel et al. (2017) measured carbonyl emissions from several
e-cigarette products at different voltage settings. An unflavored
liquid was used in the experiments and aerosol was generated at
3.0 V (6.0 W), 3.5 V (8.2 W), 4.0 V (10.7 W), 5.0 V (16.7 W), and
5.9 V (23.2 W). The puffing regime was 80 mL puff volume, 4 s
puff duration and 30 s interpuff interval. Aerosol was collected
in 3 impinger connected in series that contained DNPH and
analysis was performed with HPLC-UV. The authors did not
report the values of carbonyl emissions but presented a graph
(values in µg, probably per collection −15 puffs) showing that
carbonyl emissions (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein)
increased substantially at 5.0 V (16.7 W) and 5.9 V (23.2 W).

Carbonyls in e-cigarettes
Sleiman et al. (2016) two types of e-cigarette devices, a top-coil
silica wick atomizer and a bottom-coil silica wick atomizer, with
a commercial tobacco-flavored liquid. The puffing regime was
50 mL volume, 5 s duration and 30 s interpuff interval. Carbonyls
were trapped in DNPH cartridges (1–5 puffs per collection)
and analysis was performed with HPLC-UV. The authors also
measured aerosol temperature at the exit of the atomizer and
found that the temperature increased after the first 20 puffs.
Thus, they tested carbonyl emissions during the first 5 puffs
and after the 30th puff (“steady-state” condition). The authors
reported findings (in amount per mg liquid consumption) at
3.8 and 4.8 V with the first and at 3.8 V with the second of the
atomizer. Remarkably high levels of carbonyls were found at
steady-state, with formaldehyde ranging from 1,300 to 48,200
ng/mg, acetaldehyde from 260 to 19,080 ng/mg, acrolein from
120 to 10,060 ng/mg, acetone from 70 to 1,410 ng/mg and
crotonaldehyde from 10 to 720 ng/mg. In most cases, the levels
exceeded by far the respective emissions from tobacco cigarettes
that have been reported in the literature (Counts et al., 2005).
El-Hellani et al. (2016) tested 12 products from 10 brands,
including disposable and pre-filled first generation e-cigarettes as
well as tank-system atomizers. Different nicotine concentrations
and flavoring were chosen, with a total of 29 samples examined.
The puffing regime was 100 mL volume, 4 s duration and 10 s
interpuff interval. Aerosol passed through silica sorbent tubes
coated with DNPH and analysis was performed with HPLC. Total
carbonyls ranged from 3.06 to 48.85 µg/15 puffs, with the average
levels being 10.52 µg/15 puffs. Formaldehyde levels ranged from
0.87 to 7.57 µg/15 puffs, acetaldehyde from 0.67 to 31.80 µg/15
puffs, acetone from 1.07 to 5.16 µg/15 puffs and acrolein from
non-detected to 2.09 µg/15 puffs. The authors reported that
carbonyl levels correlated with power settings and were lower
compared to tobacco cigarette smoke.
Khlystov and Samburova (2016) examined the difference in
carbonyl emissions between flavored and unflavored liquids. Two
different e-cigarette atomizers (a top-coil and a bottom-coil,
both with silica wick) were tested with various flavored and an
unflavored liquid, with the latter containing similar proportion
of PG and VG as the former. A third device (a first-generation,
cigarette-like battery with prefilled cartomizers) was also tested
with flavored liquids only. The puffing regime was 40 mL volume,
4 s duration and 30 s interpuff interval. The authors collected the
aerosol of 2 puffs through DNPH cartridges after 15 “warm-up”
puffs were obtained (but not collected). Analysis was performed
using HPLC. Carbonyls were below the level of detection in
unflavored liquids. Carbonyl emissions varied between flavored
liquids and in some cases were remarkably high, especially
for one of the liquid brands tested (“Brand I”). Formaldehyde
ranged from 34.8 to 49.5 µg/puff, acetaldehyde from 18.63 to
27.7 µg/puff and acrolein from 1.31 to 3.44 µg/puff. Based
on the liquid consumption per puff reported to the authors,
the corresponding values per g liquid consumption were up
to 7210 µg/g for formaldehyde, 3631 µg/g for acetaldehyde and
346 µg/g for acrolein.
Wang et al. (2017) examined how carbonyl emissions
are affected by the e-cigarette solvent (PG or VG) and the
temperature of evaporation. Instead of using an e-cigarette
battery device and atomizer, they used a tubular reactor
to evaporate two commercial e-cigarette liquids and custom
preparations of PG, VG and a mixture of the two (in 1:1
ratio). The liquid (5–10 mg) was impregnated in a glass wool
piece and introduced into the reactor. Subsequently, the reactor
was introduced into a furnace with temperature set through a
controller. The puff flow rate was 200 mL/min, corresponding
to a transition time of e-liquid with air in the reactor of
2.9 s (mimicking a 3 s puff). Subsequently, the aerosol passed
through 2 DNPH cartridges connected in series. Analysis was
performed using HPLC-DAD. The authors found that carbonyl
emissions started to increase considerably above 215◦C for PG,
although the steepest increase was observed above 270◦C. The
level of formaldehyde was 0.03 µg/mg PG, 0.29 µg/mg PG and
2.03 µg/mg PG at 215◦C, 270◦C and 318◦C respectively. For
acetaldehyde the respective levels were 0.03, µg/mg PG, 0.30
µg/mg PG, and 2.35 µg/mg PG. No acrolein was detected when
testing the PG liquid. Evaporation of VG liquid resulted in higher
levels of carbonyls generated at lower temperatures compared to
PG. Additionally, acrolein was detected at 270◦C when testing
the VG liquid. At 270◦C, 27-fold higher formaldehyde and 5-
fold higher acetaldehyde was detected with the VG compared
to PG liquid. More complex reactions occurred when testing
the PG/VG mixture. The test of commercial liquids verified the
findings of the PG and VG liquids, with the authors concluding
that PG and GL were likely to be the primary sources of emitted
carbonyls from these two commercial liquids.
Flora et al. (2017) tested 6 commercially-available first
generation e-cigarette devices for carbonyls in the aerosol.
The puffing regime was 55 mL volume, 4 s duration, and 30 s
interpuff interval. Aerosol passed through a Cambridge filter
and then through an impinger containing DNPH. After aerosol
collection, the Cambridge filter was inserted into the DNPH
trapping solution to derivatize the particulate phase carbonyls.
Analysis was performed using UPLC-MS. Substantial variability
between different products and between different samples from
the same product was detected. Formaldehyde levels ranged from
0.07 to 14.1 µg/puff, acetaldehyde from 0.03 to 13.61 µg/puff,
acrolein from below limit of quantification (LOQ) to 4.11 µg/puff
and crotonaldehyde from non-detected to 0.04 µg/puff. The
authors also assessed the effect of temperature of evaporation on
formaldehyde emissions using an infrared camera, and reported
that formaldehyde emissions were low at temperatures below
350◦C but rose steeply with increasing temperature.
Ogunwale et al. (2017) tested 4 e-cigarette products and 6
liquids using a second generation device composed of a refillable
tank-type atomizer (EVOD 2 atomizer) and a variable voltage
battery (iTaste VV V3.0). The power of the variable voltage
device varied from 9.1 to 16.6 W (3.3–5.0 V). The puffing regime
was 91 mL volume, 4 s duration, and 30 s interpuff interval.
Aerosol was collected in Tedlar bags and subsequently passed
through silicon microreactors with a coating phase of 4-(2-
aminooxyethyl)-morpholin-4-ium chloride (AMAH). AMAH–
aldehyde adducts were measured using GC-MS while
1H
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze
hemiacetals in the aerosols. Formaldehyde levels ranged from
0.18 to 74.0 µg/10 puffs, acetaldehyde from 0.15 to 63.1 µg/10

puffs, acrolein from 0.02 to 5.8 µg/10 puffs and acetone from 1.29
to 12.5 µg/10 puffs. For the second generation device, the levels
were much higher at 16.6 W, reaching to levels of 819.81 µg/10
puffs for formaldehyde, 532.10 µg/10 puffs for acetaldehyde,
16.21 µg/10 puffs for acrolein and 808.72 µg/10 puffs for acetone.
Formaldehyde hemiacetals were detected only with one liquid
using the second generation device at high power (11.7 and
16.6 W).
Sala et al. (2017) presented a solid-phase microextraction
(SPME) technique with on-fiber derivatization for measuring
carbonyl
emissions
from
e-cigarettes.
A
2-cm
triphasic
divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane
fiber
was
used and derivatized carbonyls were measured by GC-MS. The
puff volume was 70 mL volume, the puff duration varied from 2
to 10 s and the interpuff interval was 20 s. Two types of second-
generation e-cigarettes were tested and carbonyl emissions were
reported as amount per mL liquid consumption. Differences
were observed between devices, with formaldehyde reaching up
to 135 µg/mL, acetaldehyde up to 170 µg/mL and acrolein up
to 1.3 µg/mL (approximate values derived from figures that did
not report the exact values). The authors also reported that puff
duration positively corrected with acetaldehyde and acrolein
emissions.
Klager et al. (2017) analyzed the aerosol of 26 first generation
e-cigarettes for carbonyl emissions. The puffing regime was
45–80 mL volume (volume levels necessary for the automatic
activation of the devices), 2 s duration, and 60 s interpuff interval.
No puff number was mentioned, but the authors reported that
the aerosol was sampled for ∼3 h. Silica sorbent tubes were
used for aerosol collection and the analysis was performed with
HPLC-UV. Levels were reported in µg/m3, with formaldehyde
ranging from below LOQ to 10,900 µg/m3, acetaldehyde
from 22.5 to 20,400 µg/m3, and crotonaldehyde from below
LOQ to 82,900 µg/m3. Unlike the findings by Khlystov
and Samburova (2016), no correlation between flavoring
compounds and carbonyl emissions was observed in this
study.
Farsalinos K. E. et al. (2017b) performed a replication of the
study by Jensen et al. (2015) using the same e-cigarette battery
device, atomizer and liquid. The authors recruited experienced
vapers to identify the voltage setting associated with overheating
(dry puffs) and then tested the device at different voltage settings
under both realistic (3.3, 3.6, 4.0 V) and dry puff conditions (4.2,
4.6, 4.8, and 5.0 V). The puffing regime was 60 mL volume, 4 s
duration, and 30 s interpuff interval. Aerosol was collected in two
impingers containing DNPH that were connected in series and
analysis was performed using HPLC-UV. Formaldehyde levels
ranged from 3.4 µg/10 puffs at 3.3 V to 718.2 µg/10 puffs at 5.0 V.
Compared to the findings by Jensen et al. (2015), formaldehyde
levels were detected at 3.3 V and were 89% higher at 5.0 V,
verifying that high formaldehyde emissions previously reported.
At the upper limit of dry puff conditions, formaldehyde levels
were 19.8 µg/10 puffs (1005.4 µg/3 g liquid consumption), a level
36-fold lower compared to 5.0 V. The authors concluded that
very high formaldehyde levels emitted at high voltage settings are
associated with dry puffs and thus are not relevant to true human
exposure. The authors also noted that the atomizer used was an
outdated and inefficient design that is no longer available in the
European Union.
Beauval et al. (2017) tested a second generation e-cigarette
device with 6 liquids (2 flavored and 1 unflavored, with and
without nicotine) for carbonyl emissions. The puffing regime was
55 mL volume, 3 s duration and 30 s interpuff interval. Aerosol
passed through silica cartridges coated with DNPH and analysis
was performed with HPLC-DAD. Carbonyl levels were expressed
as amount per mL puff volume, with formaldehyde ranging from
0.37 to 1.48 ng/mL, acetaldehyde from 0.16 to 0.96 ng/mL and
acrolein from non-detected to 2.11 ng/mL.
Talih et al. (2017) evaluated 2 “sub-ohm” atomizers (low
resistance value of the coil), which are normally used in a
“direct lung inhalation” pattern of e-cigarette use (users inhale
directly from the e-cigarette into the lung instead of keeping the
aerosol in the oral cavity during puff intake and subsequently
inhaling it). They used high power (50, 75, and 100 W), which
is necessary to generate aerosol with these devices. Another
conventional (“mouth to lung”) device tested at 4 and 11 W was
used for comparison. The puffing regime was 66.7 mL volume,
4 s duration and 10 s interpuff interval. Aerosol passed through
DNPH-coated silica cartridges and analysis was performed by
HPLC-UV. Formaldehyde ranged from 5.1 to 24.19 µg/15 puffs
(0.34 to 1.62 µg/puff), acetaldehyde from 8.36 to 25.06 µg/15
puffs (0.56 to 1.67 µg/puff), acetone from 2.34 to 55.41 µg/15
puffs (0.16 to 3.68 µg/puff) and acrolein from non-detected to
1.34 µg/15 puffs (0.09 µg/puff).
Farsalinos K. E. et al. (2017a) performed another replication,
testing the same e-cigarette device and liquid at the same
puffing patterns and voltage settings (3.8 and 4.8 V) as Sleiman
et al. (2016). Additionally, they tested another, newer-generation,
atomizer at two power settings (9 and 13.5 W) and different
puffing regime which, according to the authors, represented a
more realistic pattern. Two experienced vapers tested the devices
to identify whether the testing conditions were associated with
overheating (dry puffs). The puffing regime for the replication
part of the study was 50 mL volume, 5 s duration, and 30 s
interpuff interval. For the newer generation atomizer, the puffing
regime was 50 mL volume, 4 s duration, and 30 s interpuff
interval. Aerosol was collected in one impinger containing
DNPH and analysis was performed using HPLC-UV. Dry puffs
were identified in the replication experiment at both voltage
settings. Formaldehyde levels ranged from 796.7 to 4259.6
µg/ g liquid, acetaldehyde from 320.6 to 2156.2 µg/ g liquid
and acrolein from 69.1 to 623.6 µg/g liquid at 3.8 and 4.8 V,
respectively. Compared to the findings by Sleiman et al. (2016),
formaldehyde levels were detected at ∼11-fold lower levels,
acetaldehyde at 6- to 9-fold lower levels and acrolein at 16-
to 25-fold lower levels. The newer generation atomizer did
not generate dry puffs and emitted formaldehyde at 16.7 and
16.5 µg/g liquid, acetaldehyde at 9.6 and 10.3 µg/g liquid and
acrolein at 8.6 and 11.7 µg/g liquid at 9 and 13.5 W, respectively.
These levels represented a 94.4–99.8% lower carbonyl exposure
from consuming 5 g of liquid compared to smoking 20 cigarettes
per day. Of note, no statistically significant difference in carbonyl
emissions was observed between low and high power settings.
The authors explained that this was due to reporting the levels

per amount of liquid consumption, showing that the thermal
degradation rate of the liquid did not increase at high power
settings. The authors also reported that carbonyl emissions
from the newer generation atomizer were lower than commonly
measured environmental levels (indoor air) and occupational
safety limits.
Kosmider et al. (2017) analyzed carbonyl emissions from
a newer generation atomizer and a liquid at two nicotine
concentrations (6 and 24 mg/mL) using puffing patterns that
were recorded in experienced vapers previously (Dawkins et al.,
2016). Carbonyls were trapped in tubes packed with solid
adsorbent and analysis was performed by HPLC with diode array
detector (HPLC-DAD) and levels were reported as amount per
puff and amount per 1 h consumption (based on the puffing
topography recordings in vapers). Levels of carbonyls were lower
when using the 24 mg/mL compared to the 6 mg/mL nicotine
concentration liquid, with formaldehyde levels ranging from 1.49
to 3.41 µg/h, acetaldehyde from 1.59 to 3.31 µg/h and acetone
from 0.28 to 0.73 µg/h, respectively. Acrolein was not detected in
any samples. The authors reported that the levels of aerosol yield
per puff based on the puffing patterns recorded in vapers were
11.1 mg for the 6 mg/mL and 7.3 mg for the 24 mg/mL nicotine
concentration liquid.
DISCUSSION—METHODOLOGICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
The issue of carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes has generated
a lot of research interest. This is understandable both because
carbonyls are important toxicants and because it is reasonable to
expect carbonyls to be formed and emitted through the thermal
degradation of e-cigarette liquid ingredients. This systematic
review identified several discrepancies in research conducted
until now and raises several methodological considerations that
need to be addressed to improve the quality and usefulness of
future research.
A major characteristic observed from this review is the
diversity of puffing regimes, carbonyl trapping materials,
analytical methods, and reported units of measurements
(Tables 1, 2). This is expected due to the lack of standardized
puffing patterns. Of particular importance, 22 distinct puffing
regimes were identified. Puff volume ranged from 33.4 to
152.8 mL, with most studies using volumes from 40 to 70 mL.
Puff volume is not expected to affect carbonyl emissions when
within a reasonable range. However, it should be noted that
one study (Talih et al., 2017) used inappropriately low puff
volume (66.7 mL) for atomizers that are used for direct lung
inhalation. Direct lung inhalation is associated with puff volumes
by far exceeding tidal volume, with anecdotal measurements
(performed by the authors of this review) up to 1.5 L per puff or
more. Such difference could affect the temperature in the coil and,
thus, the thermal degradation rate of liquid ingredients, leading
to findings which are not applicable to true human exposure.
Puff duration ranged from 1.8 to 8 s, with most studies using
duration from 2 to 4 s. Puff duration is an important parameter
in temperature generation since it directly affects the energy
delivery to the atomizer. Although puffing topography studies
have identified a range from 2 to 4 s as a reasonable choice
(Farsalinos et al., 2013a; Hua et al., 2013), it should be noted
that this parameter is quite complex. Nicotine concentration
in liquids and power setting of devices are known factors that
affect puff duration (Dawkins et al., 2016; Lopez et al., 2016;
Farsalinos K. et al., 2017a). The latter is relevant to the newer
generation e-cigarette products, the vast majority of which are
variable power devices. Nicotine delivery to the aerosol is also
dependent on atomizer performance characteristics and varies
between atomizers even when using the same liquid (Farsalinos
et al., 2016). Thus, it is likely that a standardized puff duration
is not appropriate for testing all available e-cigarette products;
for example, it has been proposed that an approach of reducing
puff duration at high power in laboratory studies would be more
relevant to realistic human use (Farsalinos K. et al., 2017b).
Interpuff interval ranged from 10 to 60 s, with most studies using
30 s. The latter is probably a reasonable choice. The 10 s interpuff
interval was chosen based on observations in users (Goniewicz
et al., 2014), however they probably used first generation devices
with limited power and performance and they were also taking
short puffs (1.8 s). In one study, 10 s interpuff interval was used
while obtaining 8 s puffs (Talih et al., 2016), both of which
represent extreme patterns and probably not representative of
average use. The interpuff interval may affect the temperature of
evaporation since e-cigarettes generate heat only when activated
while on puff termination the temperature gradually decreases
toward environmental levels. A short interpuff interval may
result in higher baseline temperature at the time of the next
puff initiation, and this could affect the maximum temperature
and the overall thermal load. A potential result of a very short
interpuff interval could be the generation of dry puffs, discussed
below.
Another issue relevant to the choice of puff duration and
the power settings used in the laboratory setting is the dry puff
phenomenon. This is an organoleptic (sensory) parameter of
unpleasant (“burning”) taste related to overheating of liquids
that is widely known and reported by e-cigarette users. It was
first mentioned in the scientific literature in 2013 (Farsalinos
et al., 2013a; Romagna et al., 2013), and was presented in detail
in 2015 (Farsalinos et al., 2015). Overheating happens when
there is an imbalance between liquid supply to the wick of the
atomizer head and energy delivery to the coil. Energy delivered
from the battery device is transformed to heat needed to increase
the temperature of the liquid so that it evaporates. The system
eventually reaches to a balance where a specific temperature is
maintained and liquid evaporates throughout the puff (Soulet
et al., 2017). When there is not enough liquid on the coil to
maintain that balance, more energy is transformed to heat further
increasing the temperature of the coil and increasing the thermal
degradation rate of liquid ingredients. Conditions such as low
levels of liquid in the atomizer, too much energy delivered
relevant to the atomizer head design (too much power and/or
puff duration), or limited liquid supply to the coil (e.g., due to
liquids with high viscosity) can create an imbalance. Atomizer
design features such as mass and surface area of the heating coil,
volume and material of the wick and liquid feeding system to the

aOne study (Wang et al., 2017) did not use an e-cigarette to generate aerosol, and another study (Uchiyama et al., 2010) did not report puff duration and interpuff interval. Thus, puffing
regime is not identified in these studies. One study (Farsalinos K. E. et al., 2017a) tested two e-cigarette atomizers at different puffing regimes. One study (Kosmider et al., 2017) tested
puffing regimes based on topography recordings in experienced vapers; the puffing regimes are not displayed in the table.
bSome studies reported more than one unit for carbonyl emissions. One study (Kosmider et al., 2017) reported aerosol emissions as amount per hour of e-cigarette use.
wick determine the ideal energy (power × duration) range for
each atomizer, which obviously varies between different products.
The ability of e-cigarette batteries to deliver a large range of
power does not mean that all atomizers can be used at any
power setting. Since dry puffs are detected and avoided by e-
cigarette users due to the unpleasant taste and experience, it is
important for laboratory studies to ensure that dry puffs are not
generated during aerosol generation for emission testing. Since
this is a subjective sensory parameter, only experienced user can
determine generation of dry puffs, when testing the e-cigarette at
the same conditions (puff duration, interpuff interval, and power
settings) as tested in the laboratory. Dry puffs are more likely to
occur when variable power e-cigarette battery devices are tested.
Unfortunately a very small number of studies ensured that no dry
puffs were generated under the conditions tested or tested for the
generation of dry puffs by recruiting e-cigarette users (Farsalinos
et al., 2015; Farsalinos K. E. et al., 2017a,b; Geiss et al., 2016).
It should be noted that the studies performed under verified
realistic use conditions showed that carbonyl emissions from e-
cigarettes were by far lower than tobacco cigarette smoke. There
are indications from several studies that dry puff conditions
were generated during aerosol testing. Hutzler et al. (2014)
used the e-cigarette device until no visible aerosol was emitted,
which is a condition clearly associated with dry puffs. It has
already been documented that the findings by Jensen et al.
(2015) that e-cigarettes emit 5–15 times higher formaldehyde
levels compared to smoking were related to extreme dry puff
conditions (Farsalinos K. E. et al., 2017b). Sleiman et al. (2016)
found unusually high carbonyl emissions from e-cigarettes (up
to 48 mg/g formaldehyde and 19 mg/g acetaldehyde), which also
raised the possibility of dry puffs. Of note, the formaldehyde
levels detected correspond to exposure from using 5 g liquid
(an average daily consumption for e-cigarette users) being
equivalent to smoking >3,500 tobacco cigarettes (Counts et al.,
2005). The authors subsequently performed a risk assessment
analysis and identified, as expected, high levels of exposure
and risk to consumers (Logue et al., 2017). This study was
replicated by Farsalinos K. E. et al. (2017a) and identified both
the generation of dry puffs and a substantial overestimation of
carbonyl emissions. Therefore, the study measuring carbonyl
emissions and the subsequent risk assessment analysis have no
clinical relevance. In fact, carbonyl emissions can be produced
“on demand,” simply by overheating the devices to extreme
temperatures. The temperature can reach to levels approximating
1,000◦C when no liquid is present in the wick (Geiss et al., 2016),
and it is expected that carbonyl emissions will increase by orders
of magnitude at these temperatures. Therefore, ensuring that dry
puffs are avoided is essential when examining carbonyl (and other
thermal degradation) emissions in the context of realistic human
exposure.
There have been several different analytical approaches for
the measurement of aldehydes in e-cigarette aerosol but the
most common method includes the use of DNPH to produce
stable and easily measureable DNPH-adducts. DNPH based
methods have been widely used to the analysis of tobacco
smoke (CORESTA, 2014) and have been shown to be fit
for purpose for a wide range of sample matrixes (USEPA,
1999). However, DNPH based methods do have potential
limitations. Coated sorbent tubes have been shown to have poor
performance for the measurement of unsaturated aldehydes like
acrolein (Ho et al., 2011). Additionally, one study tested several
DNPH-coated cartridges with e-cigarettes and found that some
created significant pressure drop (Geiss et al., 2016), which
could impede the airflow through the atomizer and result in
overheating that a user would not experience under realistic
use. Importantly, DNPH reacts readily with a wide range of
aldehydes and ketones, not just formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
and acrolein which may lead to reporting of inaccurate results.
Considering that e-cigarette aerosols are complex mixtures
with flavorings containing several compounds, including non-
toxic aldehydes, there is the possibility for false-positive results
and misidentification of aldehyde flavoring compounds as
toxic carbonyls. The range compounds that might be present
in a particular flavored e-liquid makes it very difficult to
accurately determine carbonyl compounds produced by the
thermal decomposition of PG and VG. Analytical methods for
use with e-cigarettes are typically validated using just a few, if
any, flavored e-liquids, and since is not possible for method
validations to include the full range of commercially available
products, researchers are cautioned to confirm atypical results

aOne study (Wang et al., 2017) did not use an e-cigarette to generate aerosol, and
another study (Uchiyama et al., 2010) did not report puff duration and interpuff interval.
Thus, puffing regime is not identified in these studies. One study (Kosmider et al., 2017)
tested puffing regimes based on topography recordings in experienced vapers; the puffing
regimes are not displayed in the table. One study (Sala et al., 2017) used variable puff
duration, ranging from 2 to 10 s. One study (Blair et al., 2015) used variable interpuff
interval, ranging from 15 to 60 s.
using at least one alternate analytical method. Alternate analytical
methods also have drawbacks. Since -cigarette aerosols are a
complex mixture of semi-liquid particles (Ingebrethsen et al.,
2012), collection in Tedlar bags may lead to sample loss due
to condensation. Other analysis methods including GC-MS and
NMR are not widely used and method validation details have
not been published for these new methods. Results for new
or novel methods should always be compared with established
methodologies.
The levels of carbonyl emissions are typically reported as
amount per puff number. Although this could be relevant to
tobacco cigarette research, such reporting in e-cigarettes has a
major limitation when comparing different power settings or
puff durations. It does not take into account that aerosol yield
(liquid consumption) per puff increases substantially at higher
power settings (Gillman et al., 2016) or with higher puff durations
(Talih et al., 2015). Even if the thermal degradation rate (percent
of liquid that is transformed to aldehydes) remains stable, the
higher liquid consumption per puff will inevitably increase the
absolute levels of carbonyls per puff, but not necessarily the
amount per liquid consumption. Since surveys of vapers have
shown that electronic cigarette use consumption is measured
as liquid consumption per day rather than number of puffs
(Dawkins et al., 2013; Farsalinos et al., 2013b, 2014), reporting
the level of emissions per liquid consumption rather than puffs
is essential and relevant to true exposure. In fact, all e-cigarette
aerosol emissions should ideally be reported as amount per liquid
consumption, and liquid consumption is probably the main
determinant of emissions exposure. Characteristically, Kosmider
et al. (2017) reported higher carbonyl exposure when using 6
mg/mL compared to 24 mg/mL liquid, based on puffing patterns
and liquid consumption during a 1 h session in experienced
vapers. However, by calculating the levels of aldehyde emissions
per gram of liquid, based on the information on aerosol yield
per puff, slightly higher formaldehyde (4.343 µg/g vs. 4.153 µg/g)
and acetaldehyde (3.027 µg/g vs. 2.640 µg/g) were observed at
24 mg/mL compared to 6 mg/mL nicotine concentration liquid.
This clearly shows that it is the higher liquid consumption at
6 mg/mL that mainly determines the higher carbonyl exposure
in users. Reporting carbonyl emissions as mg/m3 could be
relevant to environmental emissions (second-hand exposure)
but is problematic when assessing exposure to users due to the
intermittent nature of e-cigarette use.
Some studies produced contradictory results. Kosmider et al.
(2014) found that VG liquids emitted lower carbonyl emissions
compared to PG liquids. Geiss et al. (2015) found that VG liquids
remitted higher carbonyl levels compared to mixed PG/VG
liquids and Wang et al. (2017) found higher levels of carbonyls in
VG compared to PG liquids. VG has higher viscosity compared
to PG and, unless diluted with water, it is possible that this
might adversely affect the liquid supply rate to the coil and, thus,
create overheating conditions. This is an issue that needs to be
further studied. Discrepancies were observed in the temperature
associated with marked elevation of carbonyl emissions. Hutzler
et al. (2014) found a steep elevation of carbonyl emissions at
150◦C, Wang et al. (2017) at 270◦C, Geiss et al. at >300◦C and
Flora et al. 350◦C. Of all these studies, only Geiss et al. (2016)

Carbonyls in e-cigarettes
and Flora et al. (2016) measured temperature in an e-cigarette,
and it is possible that the temperatures in these studies were
associated with dry puffs. It is currently unclear if under realistic
use conditions there is a critical temperature point above which
carbonyl emissions increase substantially.
One study that deserves specific mention found that flavoring
compounds are the main source of carbonyl emissions from e-
cigarettes (Khlystov and Samburova, 2016). In some flavored
liquids, very high levels of carbonyls were detected (up to ∼7
mg/g formaldehyde and 3.5 mg/g acetaldehyde). The authors
did not detect carbonyl emissions in unflavored liquids, while
up to 10,000-fold higher emissions were detected in flavored
liquids (Farsalinos K. et al., 2017a). A letter to the editor
commented that other studies which evaluated flavored and
unflavored liquids failed to detect such large differences in
carbonyl emissions Farsalinos K. et al. (2017a). Klager et al.
(2017) found no correlation between flavoring compounds and
carbonyl emissions. Since most e-cigarette users use flavored
liquids, a finding that flavorings are the main source of carbonyls
and result in substantial carbonyl emissions (e.g., more than 7
mg/g formaldehyde) has significant public health implications.
Thus, it is extremely important for the study to be replicated
and research should expand on different flavorings in an attempt
to identify potential compounds that could contribute to high
carbonyl emissions.
Finally, it should be mentioned that three studies which
assessed newer generation atomizers (tank systems using cotton
wick) found that carbonyl emissions were extremely low even at
high power settings (Gillman et al., 2016; Farsalinos K. E. et al.,
2017a; Kosmider et al., 2017). An important characteristic of
these devices is that the atomizer head is located at the bottom of
the tank (“bottom coil”) thus facilitating the liquid replenishment
due to the effects of gravity. Additionally, they contain cotton,
instead of silica, wick, which has more sorptivity and is more
porous thus further enhancing the liquid supply to the heat
source. Gillman et al. (2016) also tested old generation atomizers
and found substantially higher levels of carbonyl emissions. This
study indicated that the development of new atomizers with
better wicking material results in improvement of not only the
performance characteristics (more aerosol yield per puff) but also
the safety profile of the devices. In fact, carbonyl emissions from
the newer generation atomizers were not just lower than tobacco
cigarettes but lower than commonly measured environmental
levels and occupational safety limits. For example, the World
Health Organization (2010) reports that indoor air of homes can
have up to 250 µg/m3 formaldehyde, although on average levels
of <50 µg/m3 are found. Considering a daily ventilation volume
of 20 m3/d, the daily formaldehyde exposure from breathing
indoor air is ∼1,000 µg, by far higher than the total exposure
from consuming 5 g of the liquid using the newer generation
atomizer tested by Farsalinos K. E. et al. (2017a) which was found
to be 83.3 µg. Such levels of emissions are of questionable clinical
significance in terms of health risk. It should be mentioned,
however, that the overall risk related to e-cigarette use is not
solely linked to carbonyl emissions but to the emission of other
compounds that could have a toxicological potential. Further
studies should specifically examine how new wicking materials
affect the evaporation process, temperature of evaporation and
thermal degradation of liquid ingredients.
CONCLUSION
Carbonyl emissions in e-cigarettes represent an important
research topic that has generated a lot of interest. The present
review identified different methodologies used in the laboratory
assessment of carbonyl emissions. Of particular concern is
the large diversity of puffing patterns used, which makes
comparisons difficult while in some cases the puffing regime
was unrealistic. While varying puffing patterns is understandable
considering the diversity of e-cigarette device performance and
functional characteristics, it seems that choice of puffing regimes
was not based on these parameters. The variability of reported
units of carbonyl emissions can also create confusion and may be
difficult to interpret. A reasonable recommendation would be to
report values per amount of liquid consumption. Additionally,
analytical methods need to be accurately validated since the
possibility of false positive and false negative results is of
concern due to the complexity of ingredients in flavored liquids.
Finally, it is particularly important that laboratory studies ensure
that no dry puffs are generated under laboratory conditions;
otherwise testing realistic conditions relevant to true human
exposure cannot be ensured and the findings could be misleading
and misinformative for consumers and regulators. A result
of these research discrepancies is that the reported carbonyl
emissions varied from extremely low (lower not only compared
to tobacco cigarette but also compared to environmental levels)
to extremely high (up to orders of magnitude higher than
tobacco cigarettes. Further research should consider all these
concerns in order to improve research quality and find ways
to reduce thermal degradation and carbonyl emissions from
e-cigarettes.
