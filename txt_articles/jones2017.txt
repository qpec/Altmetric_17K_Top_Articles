Summary
We examined whether pet ownership increased the risk for tick encounters and tick-
borne disease among residents of three Lyme disease- 
endemic states as a nested co-
hort within a randomized controlled trial. Information about pet ownership, use of tick 
control for pets, property characteristics, tick encounters and human tickborne dis-
ease were captured through surveys, and associations were assessed using univariate 
and multivariable analyses. Pet- 
owning households had 1.83 times the risk (95% 
CI = 1.53, 2.20) of finding ticks crawling on and 1.49 times the risk (95% CI = 1.20, 
1.84) of finding ticks attached to household members compared to households with-
out pets. This large evaluation of pet ownership, human tick encounters and tickborne 
diseases shows that pet owners, whether of cats or dogs, are at increased risk of en-
countering ticks and suggests that pet owners are at an increased risk of developing 
tickborne disease. Pet owners should be made aware of this risk and be reminded to 
conduct daily tick checks of all household members, including the pets, and to consult 
their veterinarian regarding effective tick control products.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Lyme disease is caused by infection with certain species of Borrelia 
burgdorferi sensu lato and is transmitted through the bite of infected 
blacklegged ticks (Ixodes spp.). It is the most common vector- 
borne 
disease in the United States. Blacklegged ticks also transmit the 
causative agents of anaplasmosis, babesiosis and a Powassan virus 
variant. In the north- 
eastern United States, risk of exposure to the 
blacklegged tick is believed to be highest peridomestically due to 
land- 
use characteristics and human behaviour (Falco & Fish, 1988; 
Maupin, Fish, Zultowsky, Campos, & Piesman, 1991). Specific risk fac-
tors for exposure to blacklegged ticks have not been fully described.
Contact with pets, specifically cats and dogs, has been proposed 
as a risk factor for tickborne disease among humans (Rabinowitz, 
Gordon, & Odofin, 2007). Two early descriptions of Lyme disease cases 
suggested that owning pets and finding ticks on pets may be linked 
with disease (Curran & Fish, 1989; Lane et al., 1992). A subsequent 
case–control study demonstrated that the presence of pets (specifi-
cally cats) was a significant risk factor for Lyme disease and that cases 
found ticks on their pets more often than controls (Steere, Broderick, 
& Malawista, 1978). However, ensuing studies failed to demonstrate 
an association between pet ownership and Lyme disease (Cimmino 
& Fumarola, 1989; Connally et al., 2009; Eng, Wilson, Spielman, & 
Lastavica, 1988; Hanrahan et al., 1984; Lane et al., 1992; Ley, Olshen, 
& Reingold, 1995; Orloski et al., 1998; Schwartz & Goldstein, 1990; 
Steere, Taylor, Wilson, Levine, & Spielman, 1986). Pet ownership is in-
creasing in the United States, and many pet owners allow their pets to 
share their living space, including beds and furniture (Chomel & Sun, 
2011). To further explore pets as risk factors for tickborne disease, we 
examined the association between pet ownership and tick encounters 
and tickborne disease among residents of three Lyme disease- 
endemic 
states.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
As part of TickNET (a collaborative public health effort established by 
CDC with several state health departments for coordinated surveillance, 
research, education and prevention of tickborne diseases), households 
were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the ef-
fectiveness of a single springtime application of acaricide (tick pesticide) in 
preventing human tickborne disease (Hinckley et al., 2016). These house-
holds were located in counties with a high incidence of reported Lyme 
disease in Connecticut (Fairfield, Litchfield and New Haven Counties), 
Maryland (Baltimore, Harford, Howard and Carroll Counties) and New 
York (Dutchess County). Properties were selected based on landscape 
characteristics suggesting the potential for human exposure to black-
legged ticks. The study was conducted in 2011 and 2012 and households 
voluntarily participated during one of the 2 years (Hinckley et al., 2016).
Participants were asked to complete an initial survey administered 
by a study investigator over the phone, four brief monthly web- 
based 
surveys, and a final telephone survey administered by a study inves-
tigator. The initial survey contained questions regarding demograph-
ics, property and landscape characteristics, whether the household 
had a pet that went outdoors, and use of tick control on pets. The 
monthly web- 
based surveys asked about the number of ticks found 
on pets and found crawling on or attached to household members 
over the preceding month. The final survey was administered to the 
head of household 5–6 months post- 
treatment to capture incident 
tickborne diseases in household members. Self- 
reported cases were 
categorized as “verified” after a panel of three study team members, 
including two physicians, concurred with a diagnosis of tickborne dis-
ease following medical record review. With the approval of partici-
pants, we requested patient charts from medical provider offices and 
abstracted information, as described in Hinckley et al., 2016.
To explore the association between pet ownership and human 
tick encounters and tickborne disease, we conducted a nested cohort 
study within the RCT. Reported pets that were not dogs or cats (e.g., 
guinea pig or rabbit) were excluded from all analyses. We evaluated 
differences in household and property characteristics between house-
holds with and without pets using chi- 
squared tests for all households 
enrolled in the study. We evaluated differences in human tick encoun-
ter outcomes (ticks found crawling and ticks found attached) between 
households with and without pets for all participants who answered 
at least one monthly survey, and for human tickborne disease (self- 
reported illness and verified illness) for all participants who completed 
a final survey. The associations between pet ownership and human 
outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic 
regression models. Potential confounders of these associations in-
cluded property and household characteristics, RCT treatment group 
and year. Univariate analyses were conducted at the household level. 
Multivariable outcomes of ticks found crawling or attached were con-
ducted both at the household level and offset by the number of house-
hold members. These models were built manually and using backward, 
forward and stepwise selection procedures in SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC). The 
final models from each of these procedures were reviewed for conver-
gence to a single parsimonious model.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by ethics com-
mittees at CDC, Yale University, Connecticut Department of Public 
Health, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
New York State Department of Health.
3 | RESULTS
Among the 2,727 households enrolled in the study, over half (n = 1,546, 
56.7%) reported owning a dog or a cat (or both) that was allowed out-
side in the yard and inside the house; of these, 1,010 (65.3%) had 
dogs only, 231 (14.9%) had cats only, and 305 (19.7%) had at least 
one cat and at least one dog (Table 1). Of the 2,590 households that 
completed at least one monthly survey, 1,464 (56.5%) households had 
pets and 1,126 (43.5%) did not. Of the 2,541 households that com-
pleted the final survey, 1,438 (56.6) households had pets and 1,103 
(43.4) did not.
Of 1,546 households with a pet, 1,362 (88.1%) reported using some 
form of tick control on their pet; 1,193 (90.7%) dog- 
owning households 
and 338 (63.1%) cat- 
owning households reported using tick control on 
their dog or cat, respectively. There was no difference between pet- 
owning households and those without pets with respect to property 
treatment, study site and income level; however, heads of households 
with pets more commonly owned properties larger than two acres, had 
completed at least some college education and were white.
In total, 20.0% of pet- 
owning households reported finding ticks 
on their pets, 31.4% found ticks crawling on household members, and 
19.2% found ticks attached to household members during the study 
period (Table 2). No significant difference in self- 
reported tickborne 
disease was observed between pet- 
owning households as compared 
to households without pets (p = .60). Medical records were available 
for 44 of 80 tickborne disease reports, of which 39 were verified as 
provider- 
diagnosed tickborne disease based on review by the panel. 
Additionally, verified tickborne disease reports did not differ between 
pet- 
owning households and households without pets (p = .32).
Impacts
• In the largest evaluation to date to explore the associa-
tion between pet ownership and risk for tick encounters 
and tickborne disease, we demonstrated that pet owners, 
whether of cats or dogs, are at increased risk of finding 
ticks both crawling and attached to household members.
• Among pet-owning households, finding ticks on pets sig-
nificantly increased the risk of encountering ticks on 
household members, as compared to pet-owning house-
holds that did not find ticks on their pets.
• Pet owners should be made aware of this risk and be re-
minded to conduct daily tick checks of all household 
members, including the pets, and to consult their veteri-
narian regarding effective tick control products.

JONES Et al.
Owning only a dog, only a cat, or both a dog and a cat were all asso-
ciated with tick encounters among pet- 
owning households compared to 
households without pets (Table 3). Because having any type of pet ex-
plained the outcomes as well as each individual type of pet (dog versus 
cat versus both), we proceeded using any pet ownership as our predictor 
of interest. Pet- 
owning households had a significantly increased risk of 
finding ticks crawling on household members (odds ratio [OR] = 1.83; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53, 2.20) and a significantly increased 
risk of finding ticks attached to household members (OR = 1.49; 95% 
CI = 1.20, 1.84) as compared to households without pets. In addition 
to the pet variables, certain property characteristics, including having a 
vegetable garden, compost pile, log pile, bird feeder, stone walls and chil-
dren’s play equipment, had strong positive and significant associations 
with finding ticks both crawling and attached to household members.
After controlling for lot size and children’s play equipment, risk 
of finding ticks crawling on household members remained elevated 
(adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.45, 2.16) for pet- 
owning 
households as compared to households that did not own pets (Table 4). 
Similarly, after controlling for lot size and having a vegetable garden, 
bird feeder and children’s play equipment, risk of finding ticks attached 
was still increased (aOR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.77) for pet- 
owning 
households. Controlling for number of household members yielded 
similar findings for ticks crawling (aOR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.62) 
and attached (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.49).
Among pet- 
owning households, finding ticks on pets significantly 
increased the likelihood of finding ticks crawling on household members 
(OR = 2.69, 95% CI = 2.14, 3.37) and attached to household members 
(OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.92, 3.25) as compared to pet- 
owning households 
that did not find ticks on their pets (Table 3). Finding ticks on pets was 
not significantly associated with verified illness in household members. 
The reported use of tick control on cats (OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.92, 
2.26), dogs (OR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.22), or any pet (OR = 1.03; 
95% CI = 0.70, 1.52) was not protective against finding ticks on pets, 
nor against finding ticks crawling on or attached to humans.

4 | DISCUSSION
We present the largest analysis to date that explores the associa-
tion between pet ownership and tick encounters and tickborne 
disease. Owning indoor- 
outdoor pets increases human risk of en-
countering ticks, and finding ticks on pets further increases the 
likelihood of household members encountering ticks. Pets may 
bring ticks onto the property and even into the home where hu-
mans can encounter them. In addition, pet owners may engage in 
activities with their pets that take both themselves and their pets 
into tick habitat, increasing the risk of tick encounters for both the 
pet and the humans.

JONES Et al.
While we demonstrated consistently strong and significant as-
sociations between pet ownership and tick encounters, we failed to 
demonstrate an association between pet ownership or finding ticks on 
pets and human tickborne disease. As with previous studies, this was 
possibly a result of inadequate study power due to the infrequency 
of tickborne disease among study subjects (Cimmino & Fumarola, 
1989; Connally et al., 2009; Eng et al., 1988; Hanrahan et al., 1984; 
Lane et al., 1992; Ley et al., 1995; Orloski et al., 1998; Schwartz & 
Goldstein, 1990; Steere et al., 1986). A separate analysis conducted 
using data from the same RCT suggests that self- 
reported tick encoun-
ters may be a robust surrogate for disease risk at the household level 
(Hook et al., 2015). Therefore, we believe the greater risk of encoun-
tering ticks in pet- 
owning households reflects a true increase in risk of 
tickborne disease in these households.
Our result that finding ticks on pets significantly increases the 
likelihood of household members encountering ticks is also consistent 
with previous findings (Ley et al., 1995; Steere et al., 1978) and sub-
stantiates earlier observations (Curran & Fish, 1989; Lane & Lavoie, 
1988). However, we were surprised to find that the reported use of 
tick control on pets did not have a protective effect on tick encoun-
ters. We asked about tick control on pets during enrolment rather 
than on our monthly surveys throughout tick season, and therefore, 
it is possible that the reported use did not reflect actual application 
throughout the study period. In addition, we did not collect the brand 
of tick control product that was purportedly applied to know its effec-
tiveness when used according to the product label. In the light of these 
limitations, and given the strong association between finding ticks on 
pets and tick encounters among household members, we encourage 
pet owners to consult their veterinarians regarding effective tick con-
trol products.
In addition, we identified certain property characteristics (bird-
feeder, children’s play equipment) that independently increased the risk 
of tick encounters in households with those features. These findings 
are intriguing, and, other than one study that demonstrated increased 
risk associated with rock walls (Orloski et al., 1998), are in contrast to 
a previous study which failed to demonstrate increased risk associated 
with property features (Connally et al., 2009). It is reasonable to think 
that birdfeeders might attract rodents and other animals that may in-
troduce ticks to the property. Having children’s equipment might be a 
proxy measure for frequent use by a high- 
risk population (i.e., children) 
of all areas of the yard, irrespective of tick habitat. This analysis was 
designed to explore pets as risk factors for tickborne disease, and we 
included the significant property characteristics in our multivariable 
models to control for their effect as potential confounders. The results 
of our analysis, therefore, should not be considered a full characteriza-
tion of the association between property features and tick encounters 
and further investigation into these possible associations is warranted.
There were a number of limitations to this study. First, these data 
were not collected specifically for this analysis but rather as part of an 
RCT to assess effectiveness of a tickborne disease intervention. Future 
studies could be designed specifically to explore the association be-
tween pet ownership and tick encounters and disease. For instance, to 
clarify the effects of tick control products, investigators should collect 
the type of tick control product used and verify owner compliance with 
timeliness and method of application. In addition, we collected and an-
alysed data at the household level. Individual level data, including the 
number of ticks found on each household member and each pet as well 
as individual behaviours (e.g., sleeping with a pet), would help elucidate 
the role of pets in increasing human risk of encountering ticks and could 
help identify modifiable behaviours that can reduce tick encounters.

JONES Et al.
In summary, this large evaluation of pet ownership, human tick en-
counters and tickborne diseases shows that pet owners, whether of cats 
or dogs, are at increased risk of encountering ticks and suggests that 
pet owners are at an increased risk of developing tickborne disease. Pet 
owners should be made aware of this risk and be reminded to conduct 
daily tick checks of all household members, including the pets, and to 
consult their veterinarian regarding effective tick control products.
