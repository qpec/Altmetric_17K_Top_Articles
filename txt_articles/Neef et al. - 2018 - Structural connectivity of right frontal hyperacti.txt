A neuronal sign of persistent developmental stuttering is the magnified coactivation of right frontal brain regions during speech
production. Whether and how stuttering severity relates to the connection strength of these hyperactive right frontal areas to other
brain areas is an open question. Scrutinizing such brain–behaviour and structure–function relationships aims at disentangling
suspected underlying neuronal mechanisms of stuttering. Here, we acquired diffusion-weighted and functional images from 31
adults who stutter and 34 matched control participants. Using a newly developed structural connectivity measure, we calculated
voxel-wise correlations between connection strength and stuttering severity within tract volumes that originated from functionally
hyperactive right frontal regions. Correlation analyses revealed that with increasing speech motor deficits the connection strength
increased in the right frontal aslant tract, the right anterior thalamic radiation, and in U-shaped projections underneath the right
precentral sulcus. In contrast, with decreasing speech motor deficits connection strength increased in the right uncinate fasciculus.
Additional group comparisons of whole-brain white matter skeletons replicated the previously reported reduction of fractional
anisotropy in the left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus as well as at the junction of right frontal aslant tract and right
superior longitudinal fasciculus in adults who stutter compared to control participants. Overall, our investigation suggests that
right fronto-temporal networks play a compensatory role as a fluency enhancing mechanism. In contrast, the increased connection
strength within subcortical-cortical pathways may be implied in an overly active global response suppression mechanism in stut-
tering. Altogether, this combined functional MRI–diffusion tensor imaging study disentangles different networks involved in the
neuronal underpinnings of the speech motor deficit in persistent developmental stuttering.

 Introduction
Persistent stuttering is a fluency disorder that occurs during
early childhood without obvious reason and persists in
�1% of the adult population, predominantly in males
(Yairi and Ambrose, 1999, 2013). Characteristic signs are
involuntary sound and syllable repetitions, sound prolonga-
tions, and speech blocks (Bloodstein and Ratner, 2008).
Dysfluencies are frequently accompanied by facial grima-
cing, head and limb movements. Furthermore, negative
emotions and avoidance behaviour accompany stuttering
(Iverach and Rapee, 2014). Depending on severity, persist-
ent
stuttering
seriously
compromises
quality
of
life
(Koedoot et al., 2011).
Fluent speech production relies on the dynamic organiza-
tion of large-scale brain networks that coordinate cognitive,
sensorimotor, and emotional systems. Reliable connectivity
and effective signal transfer are essential to converge and
convey speech, but involved brain regions show atypical
activity in persistent developmental stuttering (Fox et al.,
1996; De Nil et al., 2000; Salmelin et al., 2000; Neumann
et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2010; Toyomura et al., 2011; Craig-
McQuaide et al., 2014; Etchell et al., 2014). Atypical acti-
vation patterns vary with imaging method and paradigm
(Ingham et al., 2012) as well as with the neural signatures
left by lifelong experience of stuttering and diverse thera-
pies (Wymbs et al., 2013). One of the most robust neural
signatures of stuttering is an excessive recruitment of right
frontal cortical areas while speaking. Right primary motor
cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA),
pre-SMA, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, frontal and
the rolandic operculum show amplified speech-related ac-
tivity (Budde et al., 2014; Belyk et al., 2015), with most
robust evidence for right rolandic operculum and precentral
gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 4/6, Belyk et al., 2017].
Previous studies discuss whether right frontal hyperactiva-
tions are related to compensatory, causal, or maladaptive
mechanisms (Fox et al., 2000; Neumann et al., 2003;
Preibisch et al., 2003; Watkins et al., 2008; Chang et al.,
2009; Kell et al., 2009; Neef et al., 2011, 2016). To sep-
arate these mechanisms several studies correlated local
brain activity with stuttering severity. Negative correlations
have been taken to suggest a compensatory role of the right
frontal operculum (Preibisch et al., 2003; Kell et al., 2009).
Positive correlations were reported for activity in the right
primary motor cortex (Fox et al., 2000; Chang et al.,
2009), right SMA, and right anterior insula (Fox et al.,
2000). However, cross-sectional studies of the adult brain
do not allow a distinction between causal factors that are
associated with the risk of developing stuttering, and mal-
adaptation, which is a result of life-long stuttering. Thus,
right frontal regions show both signs of compensatory ac-
tivity and signs of causal or maladaptive activity.
We still lack a clear understanding of supposed compen-
satory or causal mechanisms. Our previous functional MRI
study, in which we propose a potential neuropathological
principle, showed that right IFG activity relates to the in-
hibition of speech responses (Neef et al., 2016). We pro-
pose that stuttering might be caused by an overly active
global response suppression mechanism mediated via the
subthalamic nucleus-right IFG-basal ganglia hyperdirect
pathway. An amplified involvement of the hyperdirect
pathway might increase the system’s tendency to globally
inhibit motor responses. Fast inhibition via the hyperdirect
pathway is unspecific and induces a global reduction of the
thalamo-cortical drive (Nambu et al., 2002; Aron, 2011;
Aron et al., 2014). If this global inhibition is too strong
or imbalanced, as proposed in stuttering, the stopping of an
ongoing speech motor programme and/or the selection of a
succeeding speech motor programme might fail. Such a
failure would lead to sound prolongations, sound repeti-
tions and blocking of speech as characteristic for stuttering.
An overly involved hyperdirect pathway might exhibit an
increased structural connectivity within the larger network.
Connections between right hemisphere IFG, pre-SMA, sub-
thalamic nucleus, and striatum are the structures of interest
already suggested by neuroimaging evidence (Aron and
Poldrack, 2006; Aron et al., 2007; Jahanshahi et al.,
2015). Here, we investigate white matter structures that
connect right frontal hyperactive regions with the rest of
the brain, in order to test whether connection properties
support our proposed hypothesis, specifically that stuttering
might be related to an irregular global response suppression
mediated via the hyperdirect pathway.
Diffusion-weighted MRI quantifies properties of white
matter structures and, thus, helps to scrutinize structural
connectivity. In the context of stuttering, a number of dif-
fusion-weighted MRI studies report a reduced fractional
anisotropy in speech-related fibre pathways, such as the
left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF; Sommer et al.,
2002; Chang et al., 2008; Watkins et al., 2008; Kell
et al., 2009; Cykowski et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2014a;
Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016b), a prominent dorsal fibre
pathway that includes the arcuate fasciculus (Makris et al.,
2005) and that connects fronto-parieto-temporal regions
(Catani et al., 2005) of the speech network (Hickok and
Poeppel, 2007). More recently, structural differences were
also shown in the left frontal aslant tract (FAT; Kronfeld-
Duenias et al., 2016a), a fibre pathway that connects the
posterior region of the IFG with the SMA and pre-SMA
(Catani et al., 2012), relevant for fluent speech production
(Guenther, 2016; Kemerdere et al., 2016). However, the
picture
that
emerges
from
previous
diffusion-weighted
MRI studies on stuttering is diffuse (Neef et al., 2015).
Although only a few findings have been replicated, these
jointly highlight the implication of left hemisphere speech-
related fibre paths. Reports on right hemisphere white
matter differences are less robust (Cai et al., 2014a; Neef
et al., 2015). For the frontal lobe, structural differences
are reported in the white matter underneath the IFG, pre-
motor cortex, and middle frontal gyrus (MFG; Watkins
et al., 2008; Connally et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015),
in the anterior segment of the right anterior fasciculus

 (Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016b), and in the right FAT
(Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016a).
Inconsistency among white matter findings can partly be
explained by the variety of analysis approaches used. White
matter differences in stuttering resulted from voxel-based
statistics (Sommer et al., 2002), region of interest-based ana-
lysis (Chang et al., 2008), or tract-based spatial statistics
(TBSS; Watkins et al., 2008; Kell et al., 2009; Cykowski
et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2014a; Connally et al., 2014;
Chang et al., 2015; Civier et al., 2015). Fewer studies used
fibre tracking methods to scrutinize structural connectivity
(Chang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2014a; Connally et al.,
2014; Cieslak et al., 2015). The former methods locate
microstructural changes at specific points in the white
matter, while the latter mainly characterize the probability
and strength of connection between any two points in the
brain (Morris et al., 2008). Hybrid approaches locate micro-
structural white matter differences within such a connecting
volume (Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016a, b).
As a major difference to previous diffusion tensor ima-
ging (DTI) studies on stuttering, we used a different ap-
proach
to
test
structural
connectivity.
To
enable
comparison with most previous studies we also calculated
TBSS. This first step helped with locating microstructural
differences in the white matter skeleton, when comparing
adults who stutter and fluent control speakers. In a second
step we fed TBSS seeds into probabilistic tractographies to
generate connection probability density maps (Behrens
et al., 2003, 2007) and to reconstruct involved fibre path-
ways within and between both hemispheres. This procedure
allowed us to determine fibre pathways that are affected in
stuttering. Furthermore, a larger brain network that is
involved in stuttering was derived by this procedure. In a
third step, we combined DTI-based probabilistic fibre
tracking and functional MRI to gain probability density
maps
of
right
frontal
hyperactive
cortical
regions
in
adults who stutter. Eventually, in a fourth step, we used
these probability density maps to determine space and
volume for correlation analyses between the connection
probability density of each voxel and stuttering severity.
In this context, a significant cluster reflects the likelihood
and the relative connection density, a seed region shows
with this white matter region when related to stuttering
severity. For the sake of simplicity, we use the term con-
nection strength to refer to connection probability density.
In this study, we combined TBSS, DTI-based probabilistic
fibre tracking and functional MRI to determine white
matter differences between adults who stutter and matched
control participants, and to scrutinize how the structural
connectivity of right frontal hyperactive areas relates to
stuttering severity. Only a few studies combined both func-
tional MRI and DTI to study the neuronal basis of stutter-
ing (Watkins et al., 2008; Kell et al., 2009; Chang et al.,
2011), and only one study combined structural and func-
tional connectivity analyses in the same subjects (Chang
et al., 2011). This latter study showed that both functional
and structural connectivity of the left and right IFG pars
opercularis with their ipsilateral premotor and motor re-
gions were decreased in the left hemisphere, but tended to
be increased in the right hemisphere in adults who stutter
compared to fluent speakers. Until today, no study investi-
gated the link between right frontal hyperactivations, white
matter connectivity, and stuttering severity within the right
frontal lobe, examined here. In the context of our hypoth-
esis that stuttering might be caused by an irregular global
response suppression, such knowledge would make a good
starting point for the rational design of brain stimulation
approaches (Chesters et al., 2017), because it would advise
the appropriate site and direction (inhibitory or excitatory)
of potential stimulation protocols.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants were recruited for an MRI study that tested sex
differences in persistent developmental stuttering (Bu
¨tfering,
2015). Here we included only participants that successfully
finished
functional
MRI
scanning
and
diffusion-weighted
MRI scanning, of which 31 participants were adults who stut-
ter (15 females, aged 19–63 years, median age 36.0 years,
SD = 12.3) and 34 participants were matched controls (17 fe-
males, 20–62 years, median age 35.5 years, SD = 12.3).
Participants reported no neurological impairment, drug use,
or medical history that might affect their brain structure or
function. Twenty-two adults who stutter reported a family his-
tory of stuttering. None of the fluent speakers reported a
family history of speech or language disorders. Groups were
matched for age, sex, handedness (Oldfield, 1971), and years
of formal education. Table 1 summarizes the demographic in-
formation of the participants. Individual characteristics of all
participants are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Approval from the local ethics committee at the University
Medical Center, Go
¨ttingen, Germany, and written informed
consent was obtained prior to the study. Each participant
was paid E20 for participating.

 According to the OASES (German version of the Overall
Assessment of the Speakers Experience of Stuttering; Yaruss
and Quesal, 2006), two adults who stutter estimated the
total impact of stuttering on their life as mild, 10 as mild-to-
moderate, 16 as moderate, one as moderate-to-severe, and one
as severe. One adult who stutters refused to fill out the OASES
from section 2 to 4, thus no total impact was reported. The
stuttering severity instrument (SSI-4) (Riley, 2009) captures the
frequency and duration of stuttered syllables as well as phys-
ical concomitants of stuttering. According to the SSI-4, eight
participants showed very mild stuttering, seven were mild, two
were moderate, two were severe, and two were very severe.
Eight participants had an SSI score lower than 10, but were
included in the analysis because they perceived themselves as
persons who stutter as indicated by the OASES. There are two
possible reasons for the underscores. First, all participants who
stutter reported that they participated in stuttering therapy at
least once in their life. Although, nobody was under treatment
while participating in the current study, treatment experience
made it possible that fluency-inducing techniques were used
during the course of the interview. We tried to minimize this
effect by explicitly asking our participants to allow stuttering.
Second, all participants were recruited by the author C.B., who
stutters himself and who knew the participants who stutter
from various annual meetings organized across Germany by
the German Stuttering Association. He did not participate in
the current study because his handedness is left. All interviews
were conducted by C.B. Because of the familiarity between the
interviewer and the participants who stutter and because the
interviewer is a person who stutters himself, speech samples
were acquired in a relaxed situation. It is highly likely that
these circumstances led to an enhanced fluency and thus to
an underestimation of stuttering severity.
Image acquisition
MRI was conducted in a 3-T scanner (Tim Trio, Siemens
Healthineers) using an 8-channel head coil for signal reception.
Initially, structural whole-brain T1-weighted MRI were re-
corded using a non-selective inversion-recovery 3D turbo
FLASH sequence (repetition time = 2250 ms, echo time =
3.26 ms, flip angle = 9�, inversion time = 900 ms) at 1 mm3 iso-
tropic spatial resolution. All functional MRI measures were
based on a gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence (repe-
tition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle 70�) at
3 mm3 isotropic spatial resolution. We acquired 33 consecutive
slices in an axial-to-coronal orientation roughly parallel to the
intercommissural plane, covering the whole brain (64 � 64
� 33). All images were corrected for motion in k-space as
supplied
by
the
manufacturer
(Siemens
Healthineers).
Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed using a spin-echo
echo planar imaging technique at 1.9 mm isotropic resolution
(repetition time = 10 100 ms, echo time = 93 ms, parallel acqui-
sition factor 2; acquisition matrix: 128 � 128, 74 sections),
acquiring 64 image volumes with diffusion weighting (along
64 diffusion directions, b = 1000 s/mm2) and one reference
image without diffusion weighting.
TBSS analysis
All diffusion-weighted MRI images were visually inspected for
artefacts, which resulted in the exclusion of diffusion-weighted
volumes (maximal four volumes) in three adults who stutter.
Images were processed with tools from the FMRIB Software
Library [FSL, http://www.fmrbi.ox.ac.uk/fsl/ (Jenkinson et al.,
2012)]. Images were corrected for eddy currents and head
motion by using affine registration to the non-diffusion vol-
umes. For each voxel the diffusion tensor was calculated, and
fractional anisotropy of the tensor as well as mean diffusivity,
axial diffusivity (Behrens et al., 2003, 2007), and radial diffu-
sivity were calculated. White matter skeleton-based voxel-wise
statistical analysis of the fractional anisotropy data was carried
out using the FSL tool TBSS (Smith et al., 2006). Therefore,
the fractional anisotropy images of all participants were non-
linearly registered to the image of the most typical brain. All
images were then averaged, and a common white matter skel-
eton was created. For each brain, the local maximum close to
the computed skeleton was projected to the skeleton for ana-
lysis. The data for the two groups were compared at each
voxel location in the skeleton using randomization statistics.
Reported clusters on the skeleton were considered significant
at P 5 0.002 at voxel level and exceeded a cluster size signifi-
cance at P 5 0.05 based on global smoothness estimation on
the skeleton, computed with AFNI (version 16.1.28, http://
ADD_URL, 3dClusterSim and 3dFWHMx, (Cox, 1996). Bi-
sided thresholding resulted in a cluster size threshold of
k 5 11. Subsequently, significant clusters were projected to
the native space of each participant to extract further diffusion
properties (mean, axial, and radial diffusivity).
TBSS-based tractography
To reconstruct the fibre pathways that run through the signifi-
cant TBSS clusters, first, a two-fibre probabilistic diffusion
model was computed in every voxel using bedpostx, imple-
mented in FSL (Behrens et al., 2003, 2007). Individual TBSS
clusters were used as seed masks to compute fibre pathways
with FSL probtrackx (Behrens et al., 2003, 2007) using the
default parameters (5000 sample per voxel, curvature thresh-
old 0.2, maximum number of steps 2000, step length 0.5 mm,
loopcheck enabled). Resulting connection probability maps
were scaled by calculating the logarithm of the number of
computed connections in each voxel divided by the logarithm
of the total number of streamlines initialized (5000 � number
of voxels). This resulted in images with normalized connection
strength (connection probability distribution maps) between 0
and 1 in each voxel and allowed the following processing
steps. Normalized connection maps were warped to the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and an average
connectivity map was created and thresholded at 0.2 to ex-
clude spurious connections.
Crossing-fibre measures
The diffusion tensor-based measures such as fractional anisot-
ropy and radial diffusivity can only explain the underlying
white matter microstructure to a limited extent in regions
with crossing fibres. To analyse the origin of fractional anisot-
ropy differences in areas with two fibre populations, the prob-
ability of the major fibre direction (F1) and of the secondary
fibre direction (F2) were extracted from the clusters, which
showed significant differences in the TBSS analysis.

 Functional MRI
Task
To reveal the crucial functional brain region a task was
adopted from a previous publication (Riecker et al., 2000)
and was described in more detail in a previous study from
our lab (Neef et al., 2016). Three functional MRI scanning
runs were carried out. Each run consisted of 12 repetitions
of a speech condition and 12 repetitions of a humming condi-
tion, in a random order. During the speech condition partici-
pants imagined themselves reciting the months of the year in a
continuous, fluid manner. During the humming condition par-
ticipants imagined humming the non-lyrical tune of a serenade
(W.A. Mozart’s, Eine kleine Nachtmusik, KV 525). A trial was
initiated by a visual cue. After 6 s, a plus symbol signalled
participants to stop imagining and rest for the following
18 s. A run lasted 10 min. Two adults who stutter only finished
two runs. Prior to the experiment, participants listened to the
melody and performed the tasks outside the scanner to become
familiarized with the test materials.
Analysis
Functional MRI data processing was carried out with FEAT,
version 6.0, a tool from the FMRIB Software library (FSL;
http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Preprocessing involved motion cor-
rection, smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-
width at half-maximum. Non-brain tissue was removed and
all volumes were intensity-normalized. Temporal high-pass fil-
tering
was
achieved
by
Gaussian-weighted
least-squares
straight line fitting, with a high-pass filter cut-off at 100 s.
Functional images were spatially aligned to their respective
anatomical
image
by
affine
registration
(Jenkinson
and
Smith, 2001). A further non-linear registration of the anatom-
ical
images
to
the
standard
MNI152
template
brain
(Andersson et al., 2007) served to normalize the functional
images. Boxcar models were convolved with a Gamma func-
tion. Model fit was determined by statistical time-series ana-
lysis in the framework of the general linear model. A fraction
of the temporal derivative of the blurred original waveform
was added to achieve a slightly better fit to the data. Across
the three runs we calculated within-subject contrasts of ima-
gining speaking 4 imagining melody humming and imagining
melody humming 4 imagining speaking with a fixed-effect
analysis. Across participants, mixed-effects group analyses
were calculated. Z (Gaussianized T/F) statistic images were
thresholded using clusters determined by Z 4 2.3 and a cor-
rected cluster significance threshold of P 5 0.05 (Worsley
et al., 1996).
Tractography
To reconstruct the fibre pathways that originate in hyperactive
right frontal brain regions in adults who stutter, significant
clusters from the functional MRI analysis were used as seed
masks for tractography. Probtrackx parameters, normaliza-
tion, and alignment with standard space were kept constant.
Connection probability maps were then correlated for every
voxel with stuttering severity scores (SSI-4, OASES) using
FSL randomise (Anderson and Robinson, 2001; Winkler
et al., 2014). Reported clusters in the tract volumes were sig-
nificant at P 5 0.005 at voxel-level and exceeded a cluster size
significant at P 5 0.01 based on global smoothness estimation
of the connectivity maps in the thresholded tractography
volume
with
AFNI
(version
16.1.28,
3dClusterSim
and
3dFWHMx) (Cox, 1996). Bi-sided thresholding resulted in
the following cluster size thresholds, for the tract volume of
the IFG k 5 169, for the tract volume of the frontal pole (FP)
k 5 145, and for the tract volume of the MFG k 5 101.
Results
Group comparison with whole-brain
TBSS
TBSS results are illustrated in Fig. 1. Compared to control
participants, adults who stutter showed a reduced frac-
tional anisotropy in the left SLF/arcuate fasciculus (MNI:
�35, �5, 22; k = 51), in the parietal part of the right SLF II
(MNI: 30, �32, 40; k = 40), and in the right FAT (MNI:
31, 7, 28; k = 27) close to the precentral sulcus.
Diffusion properties and crossing
fibre measures
All clusters with a reduced fractional anisotropy in adults
who stutter showed an increased radial diffusivity and an
increased mean diffusivity, whereas the major fibre direc-
tion (F1) was reduced in adults who stutter compared to
controls (Fig. 1). This more fine-grained analysis character-
izes the significant differences in the fractional anisotropy
analysis, but cannot be tested statistically.
TBSS-based tractography
With the probabilistic tractography we reconstructed fibre
paths that link the significant TBSS clusters with cortical
and subcortical regions (Fig. 2). Specifically, the cluster in
the left SLF/arcuate fasciculus is most likely connected with
the left IFG pars opercularis and pars triangularis, precen-
tral and postcentral cortex, insula, posterior superior tem-
poral gyrus, planum temporale, and posterior middle
temporal gyrus. Subcortically, fibres run through the anter-
ior limb of the internal capsule as well as through the ex-
ternal capsule, thereby reaching and passing the putamen,
caudate, and thalamus towards the brainstem, where the
tractogram involves fibres of the anterior thalamic radi-
ation, cortical spinal/pontine tract, and cerebellar peduncle.
The cluster in the right SLF II is most likely connected to
the right IFG pars opercularis, the MFG, precentral, post-
central, superior parietal, inferior parietal regions of the
right hemisphere. Subcortically, fibres run through the pos-
terior limb of the internal capsule as well as through the
external capsule, thereby passing the putamen, caudate,
and thalamus towards the brainstem where the tractogram
involves fibres of the superior thalamic radiation and the
cortical spinal/pontine tract.
The cluster in the right FAT is most likely connected to
the right IFG pars opercularis, SMA, MFG, and precentral

Functional MRI-based tractography
To show which fibre pathways originate from the hyper-
active right frontal regions in adults who stutter and
whether adults who stutter have altered connectivity pro-
files,
we
computed
probabilistic
tractography
of
the
involved fibre tracts. Resulting tractograms are shown in
the middle column in Fig. 3.
The tractogram of the cluster in the right frontal pole
involves connections to the superior frontal gyrus, MFG,
frontal orbital cortex, anterior insular cortex. Fibre tracts
included are (i) the anterior thalamic radiation towards the
medial dorsal nucleus and the anterior nucleus of the right
thalamus; (ii) transcallosal fibres through the forceps minor
towards contralateral homologue regions of the frontal
pole; and (iii) the uncinate fasciculus towards the posterior
insular cortex and the superior temporal gyrus (see also
http://openscience.cbs.mpg.de/1/seed_rightFP.webm).
The tractogram of the cluster in the right posterior IFG
(pars opercularis) involves connections to the adjacent IFG

 pars triangularis, precentral gyrus, and MFG. Fibre tracts
included are (i) the FAT towards the preSMA and SMA;
(ii) the SLF towards the anterior intraparietal sulcus;
(iii) transcollosal fibres through the callosal body towards
the superior corona radiate of the contralateral hemisphere;
and (iv) corticospinal tract passing through the posterior
limb of the internal capsule, passing the putamen, the ven-
tral lateral nucleus of the right thalamus, subthalamic nu-
cleus, and cerebellar peduncle. The tractography ended in
the brainstem at the level of the pons (see also http://open-
science.cbs.mpg.de/1/seed_rightIFG.webm).
The tractogram of the cluster in the right posterior MFG
involves U-shaped connections to the adjacent inferior fron-
tal sulcus, precentral gyrus, and fundus of the central
sulcus. Fibre tracts included are (i) the SLF towards the
superior parietal lobule; (ii) transcallosal fibres through
the callosal body; and (iii) fibres through the internal cap-
sule ending at the level of the subthalamic nucleus as sug-
gested by the tractography (see also http://openscience.cbs.

Connection probability and stuttering
severity
We calculated voxel-wise correlation analyses across con-
nection probability maps of adults who stutter (n = 31) to
test the relationship between connection strength within
each tractogram and stuttering severity as measured by
the SSI-4 and the OASES. Only functional MRI-based
tractograms
revealed
significant
correlations
and
only
with SSI-4 scores (Fig. 3). Stuttering severity was positively
correlated with connection strength (i) in the right FAT
when seeding in the right IFG (x = 25, y = 10, z = 39;
k = 246); (ii) underneath the right precentral gyrus when
seeding
in
the
right
MFG
(x = 30,
y = �4,
z = 43;
k = 102); and (iii) in the right anterior thalamic radiation
when seeding in the right frontal pole (x = 10, y = 3, z = 7;
k = 436; x = 26, y = 16, z = �2; k = 121). Stuttering severity
was negatively correlated with connection strength in the
right uncinate fasciculus/extreme capsule fibre system when
seeding in the frontal pole (x = 31, y = 7, z = 43; k = 327).
Discussion
In this study, we analysed white matter brain structures in
adults who stutter and those who do not. The outcome of
this study is 2-fold. First, we have shown that stuttering
severity is linked to the strength of white matter connec-
tions of hyperactive right frontal brain regions. This brain
structure–behaviour relationship incorporates affected right
frontal spatially separated cortical regions into disparate
networks, thereby not only pinpointing areas of pathology,
but advancing circuit-based interpretations of the neuronal
basis of this disorder. The second valuable achievement of
this study constitutes the findings of reduced white matter
integrity in the bilateral SLF and the right FAT of adults
who stutter. We calculated TBSS to enable comparison
with previous DTI studies. Our large sample sizes and the
stringent correction for multiple comparisons validated
these findings that were inconsistently reported among pre-
vious studies.

 carrying out the task. However, these areas are not primar-
ily linked to speech behaviour.
The functional specialization in the right posterior IFG,
the pars opercularis (BA 44), is manifold. Neuroimaging
studies
associate
this
region
with
motor
imagery
(Lacourse et al., 2005; Guillot et al., 2008), imitation and
action observation (Heiser et al., 2003; Molnar-Szakacs
et al., 2005; Kilner et al., 2009), proactive and reactive
working memory control (Marklund and Persson, 2012),
task switching, cognitive flexibility and go/no-go control
(Buchsbaum et al., 2005; Hirose et al., 2009). Part of the
right posterior IFG implements the control of response in-
hibition, which comprises cognitive and motor inhibition
(Aron and Poldrack, 2006; Chambers et al., 2006; Li
et al., 2006, 2008; Aron et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014b).
The MFG is likewise involved in various operations that
are associated with higher-level executive functions and de-
cision-related processes (Talati and Hirsch, 2005). Similar
to the right IFG, the right MFG is active during imagery
tasks, stop-signal and go/no-go tasks (Rubia et al., 2001;
Yoo et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2008; Sebastian et al.,
2013). Given a large body of literature that associates
these two cortical regions with aspects of imagery and in-
hibition, it is intriguing that an overactivation of these
structures is a neural sign of stuttering.
The functional MRI task in the current study involved
reactive inhibition because participants were asked to stop
the speech motor imagery. In our previous study we con-
ducted an independent component analysis thereby show-
ing that the activation of the right posterior IFG, the pars
opercularis, was related to both aspects of the task. Speech
motor imagery is necessary to realize the task and reactive
inhibition to stop this realization (Neef et al., 2016).
Taking this line of thinking one step further, the imaginary
task itself involves continuous inhibitory control in order to
prevent overt motor responses. Accordingly, the involve-
ment of the right IFG, the pars opercularis, during imagin-
ing
speaking
might
be
primarily
associated
with
an
executive control over action, concretely, the suppression
of overt speech. This view would be consistent with the
observation that imagining speaking recruits the right IFG
(Tian et al., 2016), whereas overt speaking does not involve
the right posterior IFG but the left hemisphere homologue
(Turkeltaub et al., 2002; Ghosh et al., 2008; Guenther,

 2016). It is tempting to speculate that the stronger recruit-
ment of the right posterior IFG in stuttering is related to
imagery and inhibitory control mechanisms rather than to
processes that support compensation. And indeed, a recent
behavioural study supports the idea that the motor control
deficit in stuttering involves impaired motor inhibition
(Markett et al., 2016). Thus, behavioural and neuroima-
ging studies accumulate evidence for an affected response
inhibition mechanism in stuttering.
The third region that showed hyperactivity in adults who
stutter was the right frontal pole. The function of the right
frontal pole is poorly understood. Its involvement could be
related to domain-general functions, such as task monitor-
ing (Koechlin and Hyafil, 2007) or attentional gating
(Burgess et al., 2007). The observation of an amplified in-
volvement of regions that support imagery and attentional
allocation to the self-generated representations suggests that
speaking imagery was more challenging for a system that
repeatedly fails to produce fluent speech. This view would
be compatible with possible compensation mechanisms. An
alternative view would be that these hyperactivations reflect
an activation pattern inherent to the disorder and thus
would signal maladaptive or causal activity even in the
state of covert speech behaviour.
In summary, it is intriguing that none of the right frontal
hyperactive regions is primarily involved in speech produc-
tion in fluent speakers (Turkeltaub et al., 2002; Ghosh
et al., 2008; Guenther, 2016). Rather, right IFG and
MFG are involved in the ability to apply executive control
over actions, while the frontal pole contributes to the abil-
ity to stay focused on a given task.
Severity of stuttering is related to
increased structural connectivity of
the motor response inhibition
network
Right posterior IFG and MFG, however, are not solely re-
sponsible for response inhibition. Rather, they are part of
large-scale networks that also include the right SMG,
preSMA, subthalamic nucleus, and putamen. These cortical
and subcortical structures are known to function together
during the processing of go/no-go and stop signal tasks
(Aron
and Poldrack,
2006;
Cai
et
al.,
2014c).
This
observed pattern of functional connectivity is in agreement
with anatomical tracer analyses of corticocortical connec-
tions in non-human primates (Schmahmann and Pandya,
2009) and diffusion-weighted imaging studies in humans
(Aron et al., 2007; Neubert et al., 2010). Putamen and
subthalamic nucleus receive input from various brain sites
and thus constitute a part of the cortico-thalamocortical
loops that are regulated by cortex, basal ganglia, and cere-
bellum (Alexander et al., 1986; Alexander and Crutcher,
1990). The tract volume of the right posterior IFG tracto-
graphy reflects this connectivity at a macroanatomical
scale, and hence, proves the network aspect. Moreover,
the tract volume contains key nodes of the response inhib-
ition network, suggesting that it includes white matter
structures involved in this function.
The implication of these white matter structures in the
context of stuttering has already been suggested (Aron
et al., 2007). And indeed, our correlation analysis indicated
a positive correlation between stuttering severity and the
connection strength within the IFG tract volume. Our
data related more severe motor signs of stuttering to stron-
ger anatomical connections of the FAT linking the posterior
IFG with SMA and preSMA. This finding indicates that the
right FAT plays a crucial role in the motor aspect of the
disorder, which might reflect cause or maladaptation.
The functional role of the right IFG versus the right
preSMA in inhibitory control is not entirely clear yet
(Aron et al., 2014). However, both structures function to-
gether with the subthalamic nucleus in a network that me-
diates fast global inhibition. The characteristic motor signs
of stuttering are silent speech blocks, sound prolongations,
and sound and syllable repetitions. Common to all these
symptoms is the unsuccessful control of stop and go. While
speaking, the control of these processes happens rather
automatically. Accordingly, an overly active global re-
sponse suppression mechanism that induces an unspecific
broad inhibition is a most likely pathomechanism because
it would hinder the smooth successive execution of appro-
priate motor actions. The stronger connectivity of the right
FAT might be a neuroanatomical correlate of such an
overly implicated global response suppression mechanism.
Severity of stuttering is related to
increased connection strength
between right frontal pole and
anterior thalamic nuclei
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is part of the circuits
constituting the non-motor basal ganglia prefrontal loop.
Within these circuits, the frontal pole (BA 10) interacts
with anterior thalamic nuclei (Alexander et al., 1986).
These circuits might regulate the initiation and termination
of cognitive processes such as planning, working memory,
and attention (Graybiel, 1997). While the right IFG might
function together with the preSMA, subthalamic nucleus
and basal ganglia circuit to regulate reactive inhibition,
the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex might function to-
gether with the caudate and the thalamus to regulate pro-
active
inhibition
(Jahanshahi
et
al.,
2015).
Proactive
inhibition is prospective and assumed to regulate thoughts,
impulses, emotion, mood, and behaviour. In the context of
stuttering this network might be implicated in response to
the anticipation of stuttering. An overwhelming majority of
adults who stutter often experience anticipation of stutter-
ing (Jackson et al., 2015). There are two types of reactions,
avoidance strategies such as word substitution and circum-
locuting, adding meaningless speech, making non-speech
movement, and stalling, and self-management strategies

 such as pause, change of speech rate, use of fluency-shaping
or stutter-modification. Avoidance behaviour as well as
self-management strategies very likely implicate circuits
that regulate proactive inhibition. Until today, no neuro-
imaging study on stuttering scrutinized neuronal correlates
of stuttering anticipation and respective behaviour. We are
the first to bring such a brain–behaviour relationship into
awareness.
Future
studies
are
necessary
to
test
this
hypothesis.
In stuttering, right frontal structural
connectivity might support
compensatory mechanisms
When seeding in the frontal pole, the probabilistic fibre
tracking suggests connections of this region with further
higher-order prefrontal areas and thalamo-cortical net-
works, but no connections with the primary motor or sen-
sory cortex. Instead, reconstructed fibre pathways through
the extreme capsule linked the frontal pole to higher-order
auditory and multisensory areas of the superior temporal
gyrus via the uncinated fasciculus. The negative correlation
between stuttering severity and connection strength within
the right uncinated fasciculus, suggests a compensatory role
of this structure. The correlation was only evident when
considering the motor aspects of stuttering (SSI-4), but
not when considering emotional and social-cognitive as-
pects (OASES). Therefore, we can exclude that the brain
structure–function relationship observed here results from
the psychological strain the disorder entails. Rather, the
observed correlation underscores a close link between
the severity level of the motor aspect of the disorder and
the right-hemispheric fronto-temporal connection strength
of the ventrally located uncinate fasciculus. This finding is
consistent with a previous diffusion-weighted MRI study
with children who stutter; fractional anisotropy in the
right uncinated fasciculus correlated negatively with stutter-
ing severity as measured by the SSI (Chang et al., 2015).
The fact that children who stutter are already displaying
such a brain–behaviour relationship, suggests that impli-
cated networks support fluent speech very early on.
The view of a compensatory role of this connection finds
support in a previous interpretation (Neef et al., 2015) of
recent functional MRI activation likelihood estimate (ALE)-
metal analysis (Budde et al., 2014; Belyk et al., 2015),
which, however, needs to be considered with caution be-
cause previous ALE meta-analyses are based on a liberal
statistical thresholds and thus might involve false positive
results
(Belyk
et
al.,
2017;
Eickhoff
et
al.,
2017).
Nevertheless, when comparing functional MRI contrasts
of dysfluent state and fluent state within affected individ-
uals, it becomes evident that an additional recruitment of
right superior temporal regions supports the fluent state.
Presupposed, enhanced fluency requires additional cognitive
efforts, such as the allocation of attention to the task and
the multisensory monitoring of speech motor acts, in which
a compensatory role of the uncinate fasciculus and the solid
link between right fronto-temporal regions becomes highly
plausible.
In stuttering, left and right dorsal
pathways show signs of disconnection
A further important outcome of the present study is the
consolidation of white matter differences in fibre pathways
that are suspected of alterations in persistent stuttering.
TBSS located a reduction of fractional anisotropy bilat-
erally in the SLF, a massive intrahemispheric fibre system
that connects postrolandic regions with the frontal lobe
(Catani et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2005). Previous TBSS
studies on persistent stuttering have reported white matter
differences throughout the brain (Chang et al., 2008, 2015;
Watkins et al., 2008; Kell et al., 2009; Cykowski et al.,
2010; Cai et al., 2014a; Connally et al., 2014; Civier
et al., 2015). Our recent meta-analysis, however, assigned
most robust reductions of fractional anisotropy to the left
SLF/arcuate fasciculus (Neef et al., 2015), which is consist-
ent with current observations. Effects in the left SLF are
also reported in another study based the TBSS analyses
with a comparably large population (Connally et al.,
2014). According to this study a cluster in the left SLF
had an extent of 27 voxels at (x = �37, y = �25, z = 30),
which is close to the centre of gravity in the left SLF/arcu-
ate fasciculus reported here. Our meta-analysis yielded no
consistent cluster in the right hemisphere. Findings con-
sidering TBSS clusters of reduced fractional anisotropy in
the right SLF are indeed less straight forward. A few TBSS
studies report fractional anisotropy reductions along the
right SLF but in different fractions (Cai et al., 2014a;
Chang et al., 2015) when compared to the clusters found
here.
Considering functions of bilateral SLF, it is important to
separate two dorsal streams. It has been postulated that
dorsal fibre tracts linking left BA44 and left posterior tem-
poral cortex subserve syntactic processing (Catani et al.,
2005; Friederici et al., 2006; Anwander et al., 2007),
while a different segment of the SLF (SLF III) that connects
left BA 44 and BA 6 with the left supramarginal gyrus
supports articulation and repetition (Makris et al., 2005;
Gierhan, 2013). A speech production model maps the pro-
cessing of feedback control to fronto-parietal and fronto-
temporal networks (Guenther et al., 1998; Bohland et al.,
2009). Strikingly, left hemisphere feedback control is pos-
tulated to play a particular role during language acquisi-
tion; mapping sound to articulation is a crucial aspect in
this period (Guenther, 1995; Perani et al., 2011). In con-
trast, online control of perturbed auditory feedback or per-
turbed
somatosensory
feedback
during
speaking
is
primarily mediated by right hemisphere fronto-parieto-tem-
poral networks (Tourville et al., 2008; Golfinopoulos et al.,
2011). Accordingly, our findings of bilateral white matter
disorganization within dorsal fibre tracts in adults who

 persist to stutter, suggest a potential importance of feed-
back mechanisms in this disorder throughout life span.
Complementarily, in adults who stutter, previous fibre
tracking studies report a reduced fractional anisotropy in
the
right
anterior
segment
of
the
arcuate
fasciculus
(Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016b), reduced mean fractional
anisotropy across the whole tract volume (Connally et al.,
2014), and an anomalous white matter morphology of the
right posterior segment of the right arcuate fasciculus
(Cieslak et al., 2015). Here, fractional anisotropy was
reduced in the SLF II and in the anterior segment of the
SLF, a region that also contains fibres of the FAT, previ-
ously reported to be associated with stuttering (Kemerdere
et al., 2016; Kronfeld-Duenias et al., 2016a). Thus, previ-
ous and current observations strengthen the view of a com-
promised intrahemispheric transfer of neural signals in
stuttering that link the posterior IFG and the premotor
cortex to parietal and temporal regions.
Probability maps help to assign labels to affected struc-
tures (Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., 2007; Hua et al.,
2008), making it possible to draw inferences about discon-
nected brain regions. Here, we used TBSS-based fibre track-
ing additionally (Fig. 2) to pinpoint affected fibre tracts.
Tractograms from both hemispheres involve parts of the
SLF
that
connect
the
IFG
with
parietal
areas.
Furthermore, resulting tractograms indicate possible in-
volvement of ascending thalamo-cortical projection fibres,
and descending projections to the pons, cerebellar pendun-
cle, and the corticospinal tract, common structures of sus-
pect (Watkins et al., 2008; Connally et al., 2014), as they
belong to the speech-production networks implicated in
stuttering (Guenther, 2016).
Two other TBSS clusters of a recent ALE meta-analysis
(Neef et al., 2015) have not been found in the current
dataset, a cluster in the left inferior parietal lobule adjacent
to the angular gyrus and the posterior division of the supra-
marginal gyrus, and a cluster in the posterior midbody of
the corpus callosum. This recent meta-analysis was based
on seven existing DTI studies that reported foci of reduced
fractional anisotropy in participants older than 14 years.
Overall, the pooled set considered 60 reported foci from
121 adults who stutter and 126 fluent speakers. The quan-
titative GingerALE analysis (Eickhoff et al., 2009) estimates
the spatial uncertainty associated with each reported coord-
inate, thereby identifying regions which show a consistent
reduction of fractional anisotropy across studies. This ap-
proach is one way of overcoming the problem of small
sample sizes and low reliability inherent to previous DTI
studies. Critically, seven studies have insufficient statistical
power and only a few of the previous studies reported
TBSS findings that were corrected for multiple compari-
sons. Hence, TBSS studies in the field of stuttering are sus-
ceptible to false positive findings. The advantage of the
current study is that the high sample size and the applied
cluster thresholding reduce this susceptibility.
The interpretation of an altered fractional anisotropy is
complicated. This is particularly important in white matter
regions that contain fibre crossings and fanning. In particu-
lar, fibre crossings should be considered when interpreting
current TBSS findings. For the cluster in the right FAT, for
example, we cannot exclude an influence of crossing fibres
of the SLF. Thus, it is unclear whether fractional anisotropy
reductions result, for example, from demyelination, reduced
axonal packing, or increased diameter of axon calibres of
the FAT tract itself, or from a complex geometry of
involved fibres. One way of disentangling this complexity
is to consider further diffusion properties such as mean,
radial, and axial diffusivity, and to separate the major
and second major direction of streamlines passing through
certain voxels (F1 and F2). Strikingly, along with a reduced
fractional
anisotropy,
adults
who
stutter
showed
an
increased radial diffusivity, an increased mean diffusivity
together with a reduced F1, and no differences for F2
when compared with controls. This combination of diffu-
sion properties was evident across all three TBSS clusters,
the cluster in the left arcuate fasciculus/SLF, in the right
SLF, and in the right FAT. Thus, adults who stutter seem
to exhibit a weakened connectivity of fibre tracts along the
major diffusion direction, which favours the view that atyp-
ical structures are insufficiently myelinated or that the
axonal packing is reduced therein. It is unlikely that cross-
ing fibres of the secondary fibre direction exhibit a stronger
integrity, because in such a case F2 would be increased.
Consequently, our data reinforce previous findings of a
white matter deficit of the left and right SLF and the
right FAT. For the additional diffusion properties, group
differences
were
not
accessed
statistically
to
avoid
circularity.
Conclusion
Previous neuroimaging studies on persistent developmental
stuttering related the hyperactivity of right frontal areas to
compensatory or causal mechanisms of the disorder. This
view was based on the idea that involved hyperactive re-
gions are homologue areas of the left frontal network
involved in speech production (Turkeltaub et al., 2002;
Ghosh et al., 2008), and that its recruitment relates to
interhemispheric interactions that might cause or compen-
sate for a left hemisphere structural and functional deficit
(Neumann et al., 2005; Watkins et al., 2008; Kell et al.,
2009; Chang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2012; Beal et al.,
2015). The current study works out some details of these
opposing views, thereby considering the special role of right
hemisphere frontal regions in response inhibition and task
monitoring. Here, we show that an increased right hemi-
sphere structural connectivity between the posterior IFG
pars opercularis, pre-SMA, and subthalamic nucleus was
evident in participants with more severe stuttering, which
might reflect an amplified activity of the hyperactive path-
way that controls global response suppression and the abil-
ity to stop an ongoing motor response. In contrast, an
increased structural connectivity of right fronto-temporal
