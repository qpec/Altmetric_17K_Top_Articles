Abstract 
Background: Observational studies suggest that dietary patterns may impact mental health 
outcomes, although biologically plausible pathways are yet to be tested. We aimed to elucidate the 
longitudinal relationship between dietary patterns, adiposity, inflammation and mental health 
including depressive symptoms in a population-based cohort of adolescents. Methods: Data were 
provided from 843 adolescents participating in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) 
Study at 14 and 17 years (y) of age. Structural equation modelling was applied to test our 
hypothesised models relating dietary patterns, energy intake and adiposity (body mass index) at 
14 y to adiposity and the pro-inflammatory adipokine (leptin) and inflammation (high sensitivity 
C-reactive protein – hs-CRP) at 17 y, and these inflammatory markers to depressive symptoms 
(Beck Depression Inventory) and Internalising and Externalising Behavioral Problems (Child 
Behavior Check List Youth Self- Report) at 17 y. We further tested a reverse hypothesis model, 
with depression at 14 y as a predictor of dietary patterns at the same time-point. Results: The 
tested models provided a good fit to the data. A ‘Western’ dietary pattern (high intake of red meat, 
takeaway, refined foods, and confectionary) at 14 y was associated with higher energy intake and 
BMI at 14 y, and with BMI and biomarkers of inflammation at 17 y (all p<0.05). A ‘Healthy’ 
dietary pattern (high in fruit, vegetables, fish, whole-grains) was inversely associated with BMI 
and inflammation at 17 y (p<0.05). Higher BMI at 14 y was associated with higher BMI (p<0.01), 
leptin (p<0.05), hs-CRP (p<0.05), depressive symptoms (p<0.05) and mental health problems 
(p<0.05), all at 17 y. Conclusion: A ‘Western’ dietary pattern associates with an increased risk of 
mental health problems including depressive symptoms in adolescents, through biologically 
plausible pathways of adiposity and inflammation, whereas a ‘Healthy’ dietary pattern appears 
protective in these pathways. Longitudinal modelling into adulthood is indicated to confirm the 
complex associations of dietary patterns, adiposity, inflammation and mental health problems, 
including depressive symptoms.

Introduction  
Mental health disorders are expected to become one of the most serious global health issues by 
2020 (World Health Organization 2005). In many Western populations the lifetime prevalence of 
mental health disorders is approaching 50% (Begg et al. 2007). Up to half of adult mental health 
disorders originate before the age of 14 years (y) and a further 25% before the age of 24 y 
(Kessler, Berglund et al. 2005, Slade, Teesson et al. 2009), indicating that adolescence is a crucial 
period of biological change relevant to mental health (Lopez, Mathers et al. 2006). In Australia, 
national survey data show that those most commonly affected by depression, anxiety and 
substance abuse disorders are young people aged 16-24 y (Slade, Teesson et al. 2009). 
In parallel, obesity and related metabolic conditions are of epidemic proportions in both adults and 
children, particularly in Western countries. Cardiometabolic and mental health disorders share 
common pathophysiological pathways that may include chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, 
endothelial dysfunction, hyper-cortisolaemia and abnormal autonomic tone (Gans 2006, Bullo, 
Casas-Agustench et al. 2007, Tomfohr, Martin et al. 2008). Depression and anxiety are widely 
acknowledged as independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) (Goldston and Baillie 
2008, Figueredo 2009), and depressive disorders have been associated with features of the 
metabolic syndrome, including excess adiposity, glucose intolerance and dyslipidaemia 
(Murabito, Massaro et al. 2013). Results from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) (United States) of almost 6000 participants found that almost 
30% of depressed persons had elevated hs-CRP levels and more than 40% met the criteria for the 
metabolic syndrome (Rethorst, Bernstein et al. 2014). In the NHANES, persons with elevated 
inflammation were more likely to be obese, highlighting the significant inflammatory and 
metabolic burden of depression.  
   
5 
 
Mental health difficulties are frequently reported among overweight and obese individuals 
(Warschburger 2005), although the relationship may be bi-directional (Kivimaki, Lawlor et al. 
2009). 
Emerging data point to the inflammatory response as a potential contributor to the 
pathophysiology of depression (Miller and Raison 2016). A significant proportion of depressed 
persons show up-regulation of inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), 
tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and leptin (Raison, Capuron et al. 2006). These 
inflammatory cytokines can interact with pathophysiologic domains relevant to depression, such 
as neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and synaptic plasticity (Dantzer, 
O'Connor et al. 2008).  High levels of plasma inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-6) are also 
associated with aggression, impulsivity and diagnoses of Intermittent Explosive Disorder 
(Coccaro, Lee et al. 2014). It has been suggested that chronic inflammation may underlie the 
association between diet and depression (Lucas, Chocano-Bedoya et al. 2014), since negative 
health behaviors, such as a poor diet, may lead to both inflammation and depression in susceptible 
individuals (Kiecolt-Glaser, Derry et al. 2015). 
In the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Cohort study, we previously observed positive 
cross-sectional relationships between higher scores for a ‘Western’ dietary pattern and increased 
BMI (Ambrosini, Huang et al. 2010), cardiometabolic risk (Ambrosini, Huang et al. 2010), 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Howard, Robinson et al. 2011) and higher withdrawal, 
depression, delinquency and aggressive behaviors (Oddy, Robinson et al. 2009). We extend these 
previous findings in the same cohort by examining mechanistic pathways between dietary 
patterns, energy intake, BMI and inflammatory markers, and outcomes of depressive symptoms 
and mental health. We use prospective structural equation modelling (Hoyle 2012) to explore our 
hypotheses: 1) that dietary patterns and BMI at 14 y prospectively predict BMI and inflammatory 
   
6 
 
markers at 17 y, and 2) that inflammation at 17 y predict depressive symptoms and internalizing 
and externalizing problems at 17 y. In addition, in a reverse hypothesis model, we test whether 
increased levels of depressive symptoms lead to a poorer diet, increased BMI and inflammation.

Materials and Methods 
2.1 
Study design 
In the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, 2,900 women were recruited from 
King Edward Memorial Hospital antenatal classes and surrounding private practices in Perth, 
Western Australia between 1989 and 1991 and who were on average 18 weeks pregnant. The 
criteria for enrolment were gestational age between 16 and 20 weeks, sufficient proficiency in 
English to understand the implications of participation, an expectation to deliver at the hospital 
and an intention to remain in Western Australia so that follow-up was possible. Approximately 
100 women per month enrolled and a total of 2,868 live births (96%) were available for follow-up 
(Newnham, Evans et al. 1993). Data were collected from mothers, their partners, and offspring at 
18 and 34 weeks gestation, birth, and at one, two, three, six, eight, ten, 14 and 17 y of age. Data 
from the follow-ups at ages 14 and 17 y were used for the analysis and are presented here. The 
Raine Study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of King Edward Memorial Hospital 
for Women and Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia. Informed 
consent was obtained from the primary caregiver as well as from study participants at 14 and 17 y.  
2.2 
Dietary patterns 
We previously reported dietary pattern derivation at 14 y in this cohort (Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 
2009). Briefly, assessments of food and nutrient intake were made at 14 y (n=1631) using a food 
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation (CSIRO) Australia and using Australian food composition databases. Using the 
FFQ, we assessed dietary intake over the previous year and estimated serve size information and 
usual frequency of consumption of 212 foods or dishes in 38 food groups (Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 
2009). The  FFQ was completed by the parent with the assistance of the adolescent. Participants 
with an implausible dietary intake (<3,000kj and >20,000kj) were excluded (n=18) prior to 
   
8 
 
analysis leaving complete data from 1613 FFQ for the principal components analysis (PCA). PCA 
was applied to reduce the number of observed variables (food intakes from the food frequency 
questionnaire) into a smaller number of underlying factors or dietary patterns that explain 
variations in the observed data (Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2009). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure 
of sampling adequacy showed that the food group data were acceptable for factor analysis 
(KMO=0.80)(SAS 2002-2003). Using PROC FACTOR in SAS (SAS 2002-2003), PCA on all 
food groups (grams/day) was conducted, and was limited to those factors with an eigenvalue >1. 
The scree plot was used to identify the number of retainable factors (Abidoye and Eze 2000). 
Foods failing to load on any factor (r<0.10) were removed from the analysis. After applying 
varimax rotation, two retainable factors, or dietary patterns, were identified and labelled ‘Western’ 
and ‘Healthy’. Food groups having a loading of 0.30 or more were considered key contributors to 
each pattern. The ‘Western’ pattern comprised foods characterised most strongly by take-away 
and processed foods, red and processed meats, full-fat dairy, fried potatoes, refined grains, 
confectionary, soft drink, crisps, sauces and dressings. The ‘Healthy’ pattern was characterised by 
higher loadings on whole grains, fruit, vegetables, legumes and fish. Each participant received a z-
score for each dietary pattern to indicate the degree to which their reported dietary intake reflected 
these patterns. Combined, the two patterns explained 84% of the common variation (and 21.5% of 
the total variation) in food intake (Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2009, Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2015). 
Reliability of the dietary patterns was confirmed by a comparison of patterns created from the 
FFQ and the three-day food record both completed at 14 y (Ambrosini, O'Sullivan et al. 2011). 
2.3 
Clinical metabolic and mental health measures 
2.3.1 Clinical and metabolic measures 
At 14 y and 17 y, a trained research assistant weighed and measured participants in light clothing 
for height and weight using a calibrated stadiometer and electronic chair scales. BMI was 
   
9 
 
calculated as body weight (kg) / height (m) 2 and treated as a continuous variable. A blood draw 
was taken at the same time as BMI was measured at 17 y.  
At 17 y, venous blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast for the determination of 
adiponectin (µg/L), leptin (µg/L) and hs-CRP (mg/L) that were measured in the PathWest 
Laboratory at Royal Perth Hospital (Ridker 2003, Le-Ha, Beilin et al. 2012). hs-CRP was 
measured by an immunoturbidimetric method on the Architect c16000 Analyser (intra-assay CV 
15.96%). Serum leptin was measured by the ACTIVE® Human Leptin ELISA kit (DSL-10-
23100, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA). Acute inflammation was 
considered to account for hs-CRP >10 mg/L (Ridker 2003) and participants with this clinical 
indication of acute (or chronic) inflammation were excluded (n= 16) from all analyses. The 
rationale for exclusion of participants with hs-CRP > 10 mg/L was that those with >10 mg/L were 
more likely to have an acute and possibly transient response to a transient condition, such as an 
infection. and was based on recommendations by the American Heart Association (Pearson, 
Mensah et al. 2003).  
2.3.2 Mental health measures 
At 14 and 17 y we assessed the Beck Depression Inventory for Youth (BDI-Y)(Beck, Beck et al. 
2001) and other internalising and externalising mental health problems using the adolescent Youth 
Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach 1991, Warnick, Bracken et al. 2007). 
The BDI-Y is a well-established and psychometrically sound measure of depression (Beck, Beck 
et al. 2001) consisting of 20 items relating to feelings experienced over the previous two weeks up 
to the time of completion. The total raw score is calculated by adding all item scores (possible 
range 0–60), with higher scores reflecting the presence of more depressive symptoms. This 
continuous variable was used for structural equation model analyses. In addition, we report the 
percentage of our study sample with BDI-Y scores in the normal range (score ≤ 16) and those 
   
10 
 
with scores suggesting at least mild depressive symptoms (score >17), using the recommended 
clinical cut-points (Beck, Beck et al. 2001). 
The YSR is an adolescent self-report version of the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 4-18 
(CBCL/4-18) and consists of 118-items to measure child and adolescent behavior during the 
previous six months. The Internalising scale captures withdrawn, somatic, depressive, anxious, 
and inhibited problems whilst the Externalising scale captures aggressive, delinquent, attentional, 
hyperactive and conduct problems. Standardised T-scores, normalised separately for boys and 
girls by age for Internalizing and Externalizing Problem scales, were calculated. Higher scores 
indicate a higher level of emotional and behavioral problems for both measures (Achenbach 1991, 
Warnick, Bracken et al. 2007).  
2.4 
Data analysis 
We conducted a multivariate linear regression between our variables of interest for testing of our 
specific hypotheses prior to Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Potential confounding factors 
with respect to effects on inflammation were included in the multivariate linear regression 
analyses (Table 3). These included sex, maternal ethnicity, maternal education, dietary 
misreporting at 14 y, physical activity level at 14 y, smoking in the past four weeks at 14 y, 
alcohol consumed in the past six months at 14 y and family income category at 14 y. Longitudinal 
SEM was applied to test the relationships between dietary patterns, BMI, inflammation, and 
mental health problems. Both leptin and hs-CRP were log-transformed. No other potential 
confounding factors with respect to effects on inflammation were considered for exclusion, 
however two major risk factors for inflammation, body mass index and dietary patterns, were 
included in the SEM models. 
SEM involves estimating a measurement model based on correlation results (Table 3), which 
specifies relationships between a set of theoretical or latent constructs (e.g., depression) and a set 
   
11 
 
of measured or observed variables (e.g., questionnaire items designed to assess depressive 
symptoms), and a structural model which specifies relationships between the latent constructs 
under investigation (e.g., inflammation and depression). The overall model consists of both the 
measurement and structural components, and can be further divided into exogenous (predictor) 
and endogenous (dependent) variables. For our analyses, separate models were run for the three 
mental health outcome variables of depressive symptoms, Internalising Behavioral Problems, and 
Externalising Behavioral Problems, all at 17 y.  
2.4.1 Measurement models 
Measurement models are generally constructed by undertaking factor analysis with the variables 
(e.g., questionnaire items) measured to assess the construct in question, and then using the four 
highest loading items as indicator variables (Cole and Maxwell 2003). This was the approach 
taken for the Healthy and Western dietary patterns constructs (using the four highest loading items 
on each dimension, as identified in previous analyses) (Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2009) and 
depression (using the four highest loading items on the BDI-Y, as identified through PCA 
undertaken for this work). As there are four subscales contributing to the Internalising Problem 
scale of the YSR, and four contributing to the Externalising Problem scale of the YSR, these 
subscales were used as indicator variables for the Internalising and Externalising Problem 
constructs. For these constructs with four indicator variables (Dietary Patterns, Depression, 
Internalising and Externalising Problems), estimation of the measurement models included factor 
analysis estimation of item loadings and error terms for each indicator variable. 
 
For measurement models with a limited number of possible indicator variables, it is not possible 
for factor analysis to take place and so error terms must be set manually. This applied for BMI 
(indicated by a single variable: measured BMI), energy intake (indicated by a single variable: 
   
12 
 
reported kilojoule intake), and inflammation (indicated by two variables: measured hs-CRP and 
Leptin). For BMI and inflammation, error terms were fixed to the standard error of the item mean, 
which is consistent with standard practice  (Byrne 1998). This equated to 0.14 for BMI at age 14, 
0.15 for BMI at age 17, and 0.04 for the two markers of the inflammation pathway. As energy 
intake was estimated from self-reported dietary intake, the error term for this variable was set 
higher (=.25) in recognition of the possibility of dietary misreporting. This term was an estimate 
based on plausible likely error in dietary reporting. 
After identifying indicator variables for each construct, confirmatory factor analysis was 
conducted in LISREL 8.72 for the exogenous and endogenous measurement models. As noted, 
error terms were fixed for indicators of BMI, energy intake and inflammation. Each set of 
indicator variables were allowed to co-vary. Exogenous constructs were those that were not 
predicted by any other construct within the model (e.g., dietary patterns at age 14), whilst 
endogenous constructs were those that were predicted by at least one other construct (e.g., 
inflammation, depression). Analyses were conducted using polychoric correlations and covariance 
matrices, using the maximum likelihood technique (Hoyle 2012).  
Measurement models were evaluated in terms of the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted 
Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Root 
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). For a model to be considered a “good fit”, the 
GFI, AGFI, NFI, and CFI should exceed .90, with values closer to 1.00 being preferable. For the 
RMSEA, values should be below .05, with values below .10 considered acceptable (Byrne 1998, 
Kelloway 1998, Raykov and Marcoulides 2006). The Chi square statistic (χ2) was also examined 
and should be small relative to degrees of freedom and non-significant if a model does not differ 
from the observed data. However, χ2 is strongly influenced by sample size (with significant values 
more likely with large samples) and is a less useful index than the fit statistics described. 
   
13 
 
2.4.2 Structural models 
After measurement models were estimated, the exogenous and endogenous components of each 
model were combined and the structural pathways specified. Furthermore, we performed a reverse 
hypothesis model that positioned 14-year depression as a predictor of 14-year dietary patterns, 
with progression from there.  
Overall structural models were evaluated using the χ2and the goodness-of-fit indices described 
above. As the models were not nested (i.e. no one model was a subset of another, because each 
had different latent and indicator variables), we did not use χ2 difference tests to statistically 
compare model fit. It is important to note that no single measure of fit (or non-fit) is sufficient for 
judging the adequacy or otherwise of a structural equation model. Most fit indices are influenced 
by sample size and the number and complexity of the specified pathways, and thus need to be 
interpreted in conjunction with the predictive utility and theoretical grounding of the model in 
question. It is advisable that fit statistics be interpreted in the context of other models or theories 
within the research area, so that the relative fit of the model can be ascertained (Byrne 1998, 
McDonald and Ringo Ho 2002, Goffin 2006).

Results 
Figure (Fig.) 1 presents the flow diagram of adolescents attending both the 14 and 17 y 
follow-ups. Complete data, including BDI-Y at 14 y were available for n=843. We used the 
number with the BDI-Y at baseline. When considering the YSR with complete data n=838 
were available for Figs. 3 and 4. Supplementary Table 1 (ST1) in the Online 
Supplementary Material shows the characteristics of adolescents participating at both 14 y 
and 17 y compared to non-participants. Participants had mothers who were older at birth 
and had a higher birthweight compared to non-participants. 
Table 1 shows characteristics of study participants by sex. We performed the analyses by 
stratifying for sex (two group analyses with testing for equality of estimates among the sex 
groups) and by testing the inclusion of sex as a variable in the SEM model. Neither approach 
resulted in significantly different findings. We tested for interactions between sex and the key 
predictor variables prior to conducting SEM, in standard linear regression models. This included 
interaction terms between BMI and dietary patterns at 14 y in the prediction of BMI at 17 y; 
between sex and BMI at 17 y in the prediction of inflammation markers at 17 y; and between sex 
and inflammation markers at 17 y in the prediction of mental health at 17 y. Analyses were 
repeated by including any smoking in the past four weeks at 14 y and interaction with sex. No 
significantly different findings were observed. We found no evidence to support significant sex 
differences, with p values for the interaction terms ranging between 0.124 and 0.762. As such, we 
did not test for sex differences in the overall structural equation models.  
Table 2 shows the characteristics of participants who provided complete data at both time-points. 
Only 3% of study adolescents were smoking at 14 y and only 10% had consumed alcohol in the 
previous six months, although at 17 y 15% were smoking and 50% were consuming alcohol. Due 
to the small percentage of participants at 14 y in our study sample who were smoking or 
   
15 
 
consuming alcohol, estimation and conversion for the full SEM models could not be obtained. As 
measured by the Beck Depression Inventory at 14 y, 9% had mild, moderate or severe depressive 
symptoms. AT 17 y 15% had mild or more severe depressive symptoms which was increased by 
6% from 14 y. AT 17 y 16% had a clinically concerning internalizing T-Score and 20% had a 
clinically concerning externalizing score. For inflammation, 14% had hs-CRP levels that were 
higher than 3 mg/L but for 10 or lower, n=16 were excluded equating to 2% who were excluded 
due to acute inflammation. We considered maternal ethnicity by hs-CRP as mg/L and conducted 
an independent sample T-test for hs-CRP by maternal ethnicity. The mean hs-CRP in participants 
with a Caucasian mother was 1.8365 mg/L and in participants with a non-Caucasian mother, it 
was 1.1242 mg/L. Following a test for equality of variances, equal variances were not assumed 
and the difference was significant (p=0.022; 95% CI: -1.319, -0.1056). 
Table 3 includes both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression results underpinning the 
theoretical framework for the SEM. Following adjustment for the confounders (sex, maternal 
ethnicity, maternal education, dietary misreporting at 14 y, physical activity level at 14 y, smoking 
in the past four weeks at 14 y, alcohol consumed in the past six months at 14 y and family income 
category at 14 y), significant associations were shown for most relationships. However, 
attenuation of the results between leptin and hs-CRP with depressive symptoms following 
adjustment was observed. Table 4 gives the fit statistics for the SEM.  
3.1 
Measurement models 
All models made use of the same exogenous measurement model, consisting of Healthy dietary 
pattern, Western dietary pattern, and Kilojoule constructs at 14 y. Based on the factor analysis 
(Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2009), the Healthy dietary pattern construct was indicated by the four 
highest loading variables reflecting intake of yellow and red vegetables, leafy green vegetables, 
other vegetables, and tomatoes. The Western dietary pattern construct was indicated by the four 
   
16 
 
highest loading variables reflecting intake of red meat, refined grains, take away, and 
confectionary (chocolates, sweets). 
When confirmatory factor analysis was run for the exogenous measurement model, the Chi square 
statistic was significant, χ2 (19) = 68.18, p < .001 and fit statistics were good (RMSEA .055; GFI 
.98; AGFI .96; NFI .92; CFI .94). Item loadings can be seen in Fig. 2 through 4 (with slight 
variations across each model, due to the reporting of full model statistics). All items loaded 
significantly on their specified construct (p<0.01). 
The endogenous measurement models differed according to the measure of mental health used, 
but all included single indicators for BMI at ages 14 and 17 y, and leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y as 
markers of inflammation. 
The four highest ranked indicators of depression on the BDI-Y for the depressive symptoms 
model were the items: “I feel like bad things happen to me”, “I think I do things badly”, “I hate 
myself”, and “I feel sad”. When the measurement model for the depression analyses was 
specified, the model had good fit statistics χ2 (18) = 154.35, p = .001, RMSEA 0.095; GFI .99; 
AGFI .95; NFI .99; CFI .99). All items loaded significantly on their specified construct. Results 
were similar for the internalising and externalising problem models. In both cases, the 
measurement model was associated with a significant Chi square statistic (χ2 [18] = 136.35, p < 
.001 for internalising, and χ2 [18] = 86.22, p < .001 for externalising) and fit statistics were good 
(RMSEA .089; GFI .99; AGFI .96; NFI .98; and CFI .98 for internalising; RMSEA .010; GFI .98; 
AGFI .90; NFI .97; CFI .98 for externalising). All items loaded significantly on their specified 
construct.

Structural models  
3.2.1 Depressive symptoms 
The complete depressive symptoms model, consisting of the measurement and structural models, 
is shown in Fig. 2. The Chi square statistic was significant, χ2 (108) = 278.09, p < .001 and fit 
statistics were good (Table 4). The Western dietary pattern and energy intake at 14 y were 
significantly and positively associated with BMI at 14 y, and with BMI, leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y 
(p<0.05). The Healthy dietary pattern was not significantly associated with BMI at 14 y but was 
significantly and negatively related to BMI and hs-CRP at 17 y (p<0.05). BMI at 14 y was 
significantly and positively associated with BMI and inflammatory markers at 17 y (p<0.05). This 
inflammation was further linked to depressive symptoms at 17 y (Fig. 2). 
3.2.2 Internalising problem behaviors 
The complete Internalising problem behaviors model, consisting of the measurement and 
structural models, is shown in Fig. 3. The Chi square statistic was significant, χ2 (108) = 279.53, p 
< .001 but fit statistics were good (Table 4). A Western dietary pattern and energy intake at 14 y 
were significantly and positively associated with BMI at 14 y and with BMI, leptin and hs-CRP at 
17 y (all p<0.05). The Healthy dietary pattern at 14 y was negatively related to BMI at 17 y. BMI 
at 14 y was positively associated with BMI at 17 y, which was subsequently associated with leptin 
and hs-CRP at 17 y (all p,0.05). These in turn were positively associated with Internalising 
Behavioral Problems. 
3.2.3 Externalising problem behaviors 
The complete Externalising Problems model, consisting of the measurement and structural 
models, is shown in Fig. 4. It also showed a significant Chi square value, χ2 (108) = 276.73, p < 
.001 and good indicators of fit (Table 4). A Western dietary pattern and energy intake at 14 y were 
positively associated with BMI at 14 y and BMI, leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y (p<0.05). The 14 y 
   
18 
 
Healthy dietary pattern was significantly and negatively associated with BMI at 14 y, and with 
BMI, leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y (all p<0.05). BMI at 14 y was positively associated with BMI at 
17 y, and leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y, and these were positively and significantly associated with 
Externalising Behavioral Problems at 17 y (p<0.05). 
3.2.4 Reverse Hypothesis Model 
A reverse hypothesis model positioned 14 y depression as a predictor of 14 y dietary patterns, 
(Fig. 5). Depression at 14 y did not predict 14 y dietary patterns, refuting the hypothesis of a 
reverse pathway. This model was a worse fit than the original models (e.g., CFI = .63, GFI = .29) 
(Table 4) and similar results were obtained for internalising and externalising difficulties. We 
tested depressive affect and externalizing/internalizing behaviors at 14 y as a predictor of these 
disorders at 17 y. In every model tested, 14 y mental health disorders were a highly significant 
risk factor for 17 y mental health disorders (p<0.0001 – data not shown).  
Additional testing 
We tested models without adjusting for pathways from kilojoules to 17 y inflammation and 17 y 
BMI, and the direct pathways from the dietary pattern constructs to 17 y inflammation. Removing 
these pathways resulted in slight deterioration in model fit and were retained, given their 
theoretical justification. The results we present in Fig. 2-4 provide the best and most logical test of 
our hypotheses. 
Not all methodologists agree that standardized path-coefficients can be above 1.0 and are valid 
with suggestions of misspecification or overfitting of the model. Therefore, we tested the model in 
Fig. 4 without the direct path from 14 y Western Diet (1.46) on 17 y inflammation and without 14 
y kilojoule intake -> (1.28) on 17 y inflammation. These models were a poorer fit without the 
pathways. Regarding standardised coefficients >1, such coefficients are possible if other model 
parameters are appropriate (Byrne 1998) and we note this difference in the figure captions.

Discussion  
4.1 
Main findings  
This is the first study to show that pathways of diet and BMI were linked to inflammation and, in 
turn, mental health disorders in adolescents at 17 y. We have identified biologically plausible 
pathways between dietary patterns, adiposity, inflammation, and depression as well as 
internalising and externalising problem behaviors, confirming our hypothesised relationships. 
Higher BMI at 14 y was correlated with higher BMI, higher leptin and hs-CRP, depressive 
symptoms and mental health disorders at 17 y. A Western dietary pattern indirectly associates 
with an increased risk of mental health problems including depressive symptoms, in adolescents 
through biologically plausible pathways of adiposity and inflammation, and a ‘Healthy’ dietary 
pattern appears protective in these pathways.  
4.1.1 Diet, body mass index, inflammation and mental health 
We have previously shown that a Western dietary pattern at 14 y was associated with increased 
energy intake and higher BMI at 14 y (Ambrosini, Huang et al. 2010), and independently with hs-
CRP at 17 y. The Healthy pattern was mediated through adiposity and inflammation with a 
healthier dietary pattern, resulting in inverse associations with adiposity and inflammation. 
Dietary patterns appear to influence inflammation both directly and indirectly through BMI. 
Furthermore, the associations between diet, adiposity and inflammation are stronger than between 
inflammation and mental health, which is understandable given the multifactorial aetiology of 
mental health disorders. Although there is strong evidence that inflammation precedes depression, 
some studies have shown bidirectional effects (Irwin and Miller 2007, Gall, Sanderson et al. 
2016). We did not show effects of depressive symptoms on diet quality but we did show 
bidirectional effects from depression to adiposity and inflammation in Fig. 5, and that mental 
health problems at 14 y were a significant risk factor for mental health problems at 17 y. 
   
20 
 
Obesity and mental health problems share inflammation as a common link (Shelton and Miller 
2010) and, in our analysis, indices of inflammation were positively associated with all mental 
health outcomes, particularly depressive symptoms. Although our results of inflammation and 
mental health outcomes were attenuated in multivariate analyses, they continued to be in a 
positive direction of effect. Diets that promote inflammation also promote adiposity and are high 
in refined starches, sugar, saturated fats, and low in fibre, vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids 
(Galland 2010).  Others have shown a Western diet high in red and processed meat, confectionary 
and refined grains associated with higher hs-CRP compared with a healthy dietary pattern 
characterised by fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish and whole grains (Nanri, Moore et al. 2007). 
Therefore, inflammation-enhancing diets may contribute to depressive symptoms (Kiecolt-Glaser 
2010) and other mental health problems. Refined starches and sugar can rapidly alter blood 
glucose and insulin levels (Giugliano, Ceriello et al. 2008) and postprandial hyperglycaemia can 
increase free radical production and pro-inflammatory cytokines, accelerating and stimulating 
depressive symptoms (Kiecolt-Glaser 2010), and potentially increasing irritability and aggression 
(Zalcman, Siegel. 2006). Depressive symptoms and hs-CRP have been positively associated in 
population as well as clinical studies, with a dose-response relationship observed (Howren, 
Lamkin et al. 2009). Less is known of the link between externalizing problems and inflammatory 
markers, although our findings support prior work showing links between hs-CRP and aggression 
(Coccaro, Lee et al. 2014).  
4.1.2 Obesity and inflammation 
Obesity has been characterised as a state of chronic inflammation because IL-6, TNF-α, hs-CRP 
and leptin (Dandona, Aljada et al. 2004) are elevated and up to 30% of IL-6 may be derived from 
adipose tissue. Women with greater central adiposity had larger inflammatory responses to a 
laboratory stress test than their leaner counterparts (Dandona, Aljada et al. 2004). Adiposity has 
also been associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP in depressed people (Miller, Maletic 
   
21 
 
et al. 2009). As adiposity increases, leptin signals the release of hs-CRP from the liver (Jialal, 
Devaraj et al. 2004), increasing peripheral cytokines and leading to depressive symptoms, 
aggravating the process of adipose-induced inflammation further. High energy intake in the diet 
leads to increased accumulation of lipids in adipocytes resulting in an increased release of 
Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemoattractant that increases the infiltration of 
macrophages into adipose tissue (Shelton and Miller 2010). Both adipocytes and macrophages 
release inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-α and leptin into the peripheral circulation and 
leptin has wide ranging effects on the immune response (Miller, Freedland et al. 2003). Others 
have speculated that fat mass stimulates low level inflammation independently through the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) via direct and feedback interactions among the 
hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the adrenal glands (Waelput, Brouckaert et al. 2006). These 
interactions play a multiplicative role rather than acting as a confounder in mental health 
problems. 
4.1.3 Inflammatory cytokines and depressive symptoms 
Extant clinical evidence is restricted to situations where patients are exposed to high doses of 
inflammatory cytokines due to medical treatment such as cancer, whereby patients routinely 
develop depressive symptoms. Exposure to inflammatory mediators can produce a constellation of 
sickness behaviors (Dantzer, O'Connor et al. 2008, Shelton and Miller 2010). In a prospective 
study, high levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP measured at baseline predicted increased depressive 
symptoms over a five year period (van den Biggelaar, Gussekloo et al. 2007). A ‘Western’ diet 
may lead to increased hs-CRP and pro-inflammatory responses to high fat meals exaggerated by 
obesity, pushing elevated levels higher (O’Keefe, Gheewala et al. 2008).  
   
22 
 
4.1.4 Diet and inflammation 
Nutrients such as magnesium, fibre, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated 
fatty acids, flavonoids, and carotenoids from food associate with a Healthy diet and decreased 
levels of inflammatory markers, whereas saturated- and trans fatty acids, high-GI carbohydrates, 
and a high ω-6/ω-3 PUFA ratio associate with a Western diet and increased levels of 
inflammation (Galland 2010).  Habitual intake of a Western dietary pattern may exacerbate low-
grade systemic inflammation. The direct and indirect associations between dietary patterns, 
obesity and inflammation observed in our study are speculated to be partially due to diet and not 
solely to BMI, although further research is needed around this possibility. 
4.2 
Strengths and limitations  
The prospective design, community sample and adequate statistical power to measure outcomes 
are clear strengths of the Raine study. Extensive efforts were made to maximise participation rates 
and minimise loss-to-follow up. Our follow-up rates were comparable or better than similar 
studies (Wolke, Waylen et al. 2009). While the loss of more disadvantaged participants is 
expected, the original cohort over-sampled socially-disadvantaged mothers for this reason (Li, 
Kendall et al. 2008).  
A major strength of our study is that three mental health measures were collected (the BDI-Y, the 
YSR Internalising scale, and the YSR Externalizing scale), allowing multiple domains of mental 
health to be assessed in a large sample in a timely manner. A recent review of child and 
adolescent self-report questionnaires (Deighton, Croudace et al. 2014) demonstrates our measures 
are reliable and valid. However, there is the possibility of under- or over-reporting of symptoms 
using self-report methods: future research focusing on clinically diagnosed disorders would add to 
our study. Dietary intake was also self-reported and it is well known that overweight and obese 
individuals under-report dietary intake more than healthy weight individuals (Black 2000). 
   
23 
 
Although we could not include dietary misreporting in our structural equation models due to 
model non-convergence, we limited our analysis to individuals with plausible energy intakes 
(Ambrosini, Oddy et al. 2009).  
We collected data on depressive affect and externalizing/internalizing behavior at 14 y as well at 
17 y. However, including 14 y mental health variables in the models resulted in testing for effects 
of diet, BMI and inflammation on changes in mental health from 14 y to 17 y. However, in every 
model tested 14 y mental health problems were a significant risk factor for 17 y mental health 
problems. In our study, we sought to test a specific hypothesized model of how different factors at 
14 y (dietary patterns, BMI) and 17 y (BMI, inflammation) may interact to increase the risk of 
depressive symptoms and internalizing/externalizing problems in later adolescence, at 17 y. 
Further, the final pathways of these models (inflammation at 17 y to mental health at 17 y) are 
cross-sectional in nature, which we suggest, reduces the requirement for prior adjustment of 14 y 
mental health.  
A strength of structural equation modelling is that the analysis tests an overall model of specific, 
hypothesized relationships between multiple variables (Byrne 1998). While we attempted to 
control for relevant potential confounders, the observational nature of the study means that 
residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Other drug use, hormones related to menarche, 
hormonal treatments or pregnancy are important but remain unexplored in our analysis. We 
acknowledge that the hypothesised pathways may be due to underlying genetic or common 
environmental factors and that establishing true causality is difficult and beyond the scope of our 
analyses.

Conclusion  
Scientific work on the relationship of inflammation to mental health problems is still in its 
infancy, and this study provides an important contribution by mapping out the relationship of diet, 
   
24 
 
adiposity, inflammation and mental health disorders. The Western dietary pattern associates with 
increased obesity and increased chronic inflammation (Esposito and Giugliano 2006) and the 
healthy dietary pattern associates with less obesity and inflammation, as we have seen in the 
analysis presented here. A Western dietary pattern indirectly associates with an increased risk of 
mental health problems, including depressive symptoms in adolescents, through biologically 
plausible pathways of adiposity and inflammation, whereas a Healthy dietary pattern appears 
protective in these pathways. A reverse hypothesis was not supported but further longitudinal 
modelling into adulthood is indicated. An understanding of the co-morbidity of depression and 
other mental health disorders with obesity may provide a clearer understanding of the benefits of 
improved diet as a target for preventive strategies. We speculate that a diet high in red and 
processed meat, takeaway and refined foods, soft drink and confectionary contributes to a 
pathway involving adiposity, inflammation and depressive, internalising and externalising 
symptoms in adolescents. We further speculate that a diet high in fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish 
and wholegrains contributes to a pathway of less adiposity, inflammation and mental health 
problems in adolescents. A potential tri-directional relationship between adiposity, inflammation 
and depression should not be excluded (Stewart, Rand et al. 2009) with dietary and nutritional 
factors significantly influencing and impacting these relationships. Future investigation is 
warranted to describe the links between diet (food components and nutrients), adiposity, 
inflammation, depression and other mental health disorders.

Square boxes depict observed variables and bolded ellipses depict latent constructs. Values 
reflect standardised coefficients and standard error terms, and values in bold are significant 
(* p < .05, ** p < .01). In contrast to other statistical techniques, standardised coefficients

pattern and energy intake at 14 y were significantly and positively associated with BMI at 
14 y, and with BMI, leptin and hs-CRP at 17 y (p<0.05). The Healthy dietary pattern was 
not significantly associated with BMI at 14 y but was significantly and negatively related to 
BMI and hs-CRP at 17 y (p<0.05). BMI at 14 y was significantly and positively associated 
with BMI and inflammatory markers at 17 y (p<0.01). This inflammation was further linked

Depression at 14 y did not predict 14 y dietary patterns, refuting the hypothesis of a reverse 
pathway. This model was a worse fit than the original models (e.g., CFI = .63, GFI = .29) 
(Table 4) and similar results were obtained for internalising and externalising behavioral 
problems.

Highlights 
 Diet and adiposity are linked to inflammation and mental health problems in adolescents 
 A Western dietary pattern associates with increased depression risk in adolescents 
 A ‘Healthy’ dietary pattern protects against depression in adolescents through reduced 
BMI and associated inflammation
