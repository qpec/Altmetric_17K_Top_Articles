Abstract
Background Psoriasis is a common skin disease and
moderate to severe psoriasis is associated with a dose-de-
pendent risk for metabolic and cardiovascular morbidity. It
has previously been speculated that women have less
severe psoriasis, as men are overrepresented in psoriasis
registers and consume more care.
Objective The objective of this study was to investigate,
for the first time, the sex differences in the severity of
psoriasis using the gold standard of severity measurement,
the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and the
distinct elements of the PASI score.
Design, Setting and Participants This was a cross-sec-
tional study based on the national registry for systemic
treatment of psoriasis in Sweden (PsoReg), with 5438
patients experiencing moderate to severe psoriasis. Dif-
ferences in the PASI score and its elements at enrolment
were tested by multivariable ordinal logistic regressions.
Main Outcome Measures The different components of the
PASI score were used to analyze the assessment of disease
severity. For each body area (head, arms, trunk, and legs),
the score of the plaque characteristics and degree of skin
involvement were used as outcomes.
Results Women had statistically significantly lower med-
ian PASI scores (5.4) than men (7.3) [p \ 0.001], which
was consistent across all ages. The difference remained
statistically significant in a multivariable linear regression.
The itemized PASI analyses from the Mann–Whitney–
Wilcoxon tests and the adjusted ordinal logistic regressions
confirmed that women had significantly lower scores than
men in all areas of the body, except for the head. No dif-
ferences in the use of medications prior to enrolment could
be found that may cause this difference between the sexes.
Conclusions As the PsoReg contains the detailed disease
measurement PASI, which was traditionally used for
selected participants in clinical studies only, a nationwide
unselected population could be investigated. The fact that
women have less severe psoriasis can explain the domi-
nance of males in the systemic treatment of psoriasis.
These findings motivate a gender perspective in the man-
agement of psoriasis and in the prevention and manage-
ment of its comorbidities.
Key Points
This register-based study revealed that the severity
of psoriasis differs between men and women when
analyzing the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
(PASI), the most widely used instrument to assess
disease severity.
The distinct elements of the PASI score were
analyzed separately and it was found that men had
more severe psoriasis than women in all areas of the
body (trunk, arms and legs), except for the head.

 1 Introduction
Psoriasis is one of the most common skin diseases, with a
prevalence of approximately 2–4% in the Western world
[1]. It is known that moderate to severe psoriasis is asso-
ciated with a dose-dependent risk of cardiovascular mor-
bidity, metabolic syndrome, and depression [2–4]. The
prevalence of psoriasis is considered to be balanced
between the sexes [5, 6]; however, several studies have
indicated sex differences in the treatment of psoriasis. In
1945, Romanus showed that a population of 550 Swedish
patients had statistically significant differences in the
severity of psoriasis (p \ 0.001) depending on their sex.
The highest severity in his categorization ‘‘continues
symptoms and recommended hospitalization’’ was fulfilled
by 38.4% of men but only 28% of women [7]. It has also
been shown that women receive topical treatments to a
greater extent than men [8], while men are more likely to
receive systemic treatment [9, 10]. Furthermore, men are
more often treated by dermatologists, whereas women are
treated by general practitioners or treat themselves at home
[11–13], which has led to the hypothesis that systemic
psoriasis treatment for women of fertile age may be avoi-
ded [13, 14]. However, we have previously shown that
when adjusting for disease severity, among other factors,
sex was not a decisive factor in the initiation of biological
treatments, which have high acquisition costs [15].
The gold standard for assessing the severity of psoriasis
is the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which
combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the
extent of the affected area in a single index score [16]. We
have previously observed that the PASI score was a more
important factor than the Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI) in the decision to initiate biologic treatment, and
that women tended to have lower PASI scores than men
[17].
Therefore,
the
observed
treatment
differences
between the sexes might be due to less severe disease in
women. Consequently, we performed this study to test the
hypothesis that, at enrolment in the PsoReg, severe psori-
asis is less common in women. By analyzing the distinct
elements of the PASI score, we also wanted to investigate
whether any pattern could be discerned between men and
women in the different body parts and/or dimensions of
PASI measures.
2 Methods
2.1 Study Population
Data were retrieved in May 2016, and, in total, 5438
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were registered
in the PsoReg at this time. PsoReg, initiated in 2006, is the
national registry for systemic treatment of psoriasis in
Sweden. Patients are registered at local, regional, and
university hospitals, as well as in private practices and at
treatment centers initiated by the Swedish Psoriasis Patient
Organization (PSO) [18]. To be included in the PsoReg,
patients need to be diagnosed with moderate to severe
psoriasis and treated with, or considered for, systemic
treatment by a specialist in dermatology. Thus, patients
with mild psoriasis who are treated in primary care are not
eligible for inclusion in the register. Nationwide, 65% of all
biologically treated psoriasis patients and approximately
45% of all systemically treated psoriasis patients are esti-
mated to be included in the PsoReg.
2.2 Definition of Variables
PASI is a combined score consisting of several dimensions
of psoriasis, and is based on four areas: head, arms, trunk,
and legs. Furthermore, for each body area, three plaque
characteristics are assessed by the degree of erythema
(redness), induration (thickness), and desquamation (scal-
ing). The scores of the clinical signs in each area are
summed and are finally weighted according to the area’s
proportion of the body, before being converted to the final
score, which ranged from 0 to a theoretical maximum of
72.
For each patient, information on sex, age, body mass
index (BMI), disease duration, diagnosis of psoriatic
arthritis (PsA), smoking status, PASI score, and the season
in which assessment of the PASI score was carried out was
retrieved from the PsoReg.
2.3 Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were analyzed at enrolment to
examine differences between women and men. Continuous
variables (age, disease duration, and BMI) were analyzed
using the Student’s t test, while categorical variables
(smoking, PsA, obesity, and season of the PASI evaluation)
were tested using the Chi square test. The difference in the
aggregated PASI score was analyzed using a Mann–
Whitney–Wilcoxon test and a multivariable linear regres-
sion. At enrolment, a kernel-smoothing estimation was
used to plot the difference in PASI score for both men and
women, according to age at enrolment.
The differences in the independent PASI components
between women and men were first investigated using the
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test separately for the different
assessments: degree of involvement, erythema, induration
and desquamation, and within each body region (head,
trunk, arms, and legs). To be able to adjust for potential
confounders
and

modifiers,
a

 regression was used to analyze the weighted aggregated
PASI score, while multiple ordinal logistic regressions
were used to analyze the different components of the PASI
assessment. For each body area, four different regressions
were fitted, where the score of the plaque characteristics
(erythema, induration, and desquamation) and degree of
skin involvement were outcomes. Age (continuous), sex
(dichotomous), BMI (continuous), disease duration (con-
tinuous), PsA (dichotomous), smoking status (dichoto-
mous),
and
season
(categorical)
were
included
as
independent variables. The season variable was categorized
into four different periods; winter (December, January,
February), spring (March, April and May), summer (June,
July, August), and autumn (September, October, Novem-
ber). The assumption of proportionality in the ordinal
logistic regressions was tested by estimating the odds ratios
in logistic regressions to make sure that the estimates did
not vary between the two methods. Furthermore, different
thresholds were also tested for the various categories to
ensure that the results were stable.
To illustrate differences between sexes in the treatment
of psoriasis on a national level, independent from the
PsoReg, aggregated information on all dispensed pre-
scriptions for (biologic treatment) ustekinumab (Anatomi-
cal Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code L04AC05) and
(topical treatment) calcipotriol (± corticosteroid; ATC
codes D05AX02, D05AX52) was collected from the Pre-
scribed Drug Register (PDR). Both substances are indi-
cated for psoriasis and PsA, but not for other indications.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A p value
B0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
2.4 Ethics
This research was approved by the Umea
˚ Ethical Review
Board, and patients were recruited into the study after
informed consent had been obtained.
3 Results
This study included 3252 (59.8%) men and 2186 (40.2%)
women. For a subset of subjects (n = 3125; 57.5%),
information on dispensed medications was available for
analysis. At enrolment, women had significantly lower
(p \ 0.001) median PASI (5.4, interquartile range [IQR]
2.7–9.9) than men (7.5, IQR 3.6–12.2). Furthermore,
women were older (p \ 0.001), consisted of a higher pro-
portion of smokers (p = 0.003), and had a higher extent of
PsA (p = 0.015) compared with men. BMI was higher in
the male group (p = 0.003), but there was no significant
difference in the proportion of patients with obesity (BMI
[
30) [p = 0.896]. Disease duration was longer for women
compared with men (p = 0.002), and no difference was
found between men and women when comparing the time
of
year
the
PASI
measurements
were
conducted
(p = 0.315) (Table 1).
The kernel-smoothing plot shows that, in the PsoReg,
women had a lower PASI score at enrolment compared
with men, irrespective of age at registration. Both men and
women had a declining trend in PASI throughout the age
ranges (Fig. 1).
In the multiple linear regression analysis with PASI as
the dependent variable, after adjusting for age, BMI, dis-
ease duration, PsA, smoking status, and season, sex was a
significant explanatory variable (p \ 0.001), with women
having a lower PASI score than men.
3.1 Dimensions in Each Body Area
The difference between men and women’s PASI score
elements at enrolment was tested using the Mann–Whit-
ney–Wilcoxon test, and using the plaque characteristics
(erythema, induration, and desquamation) and degree of
skin involvement in each body region. Results showed that
women had a significantly lower PASI score in all com-
ponents in each body region, except for the characteristics
‘head area’, ‘head induration’, and ‘head desquamation’,
where the scores were almost identical for women and men
(Fig. 2).
The aggregated weighted PASI sums for each area (head,
trunk, arms, and legs) were used as outcomes in the multiple
ordinal regressions, with the same result as in the analysis of
each element for the body regions described above.
3.2 Ordinal Logistic Regressions
The assessment of plaque characteristics and the degree of
skin involvement for each body region were used as the
outcome in the multiple ordinal logistic regressions. The
models were adjusted by age, BMI, smoking, season, and
PsA, and the results were consistent with those of the
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests. Significant differences
were found for all plaque characteristics and the degree of
skin involvement in the arms, legs and trunk body regions,
where women had lower scores. No differences could be
identified with respect to the head. The largest differences
between men and women were found in desquamation
[odds ratio men vs. women: arms 1.75 (CI 95% 1.55–1.98),
trunk 1.65 (CI 95% 1.45–1.87), and legs 1.59 (CI 95%
1.41–1.80)] and induration at the arms [odds ratio men vs.
women 1.63 (CI 95% 1.43–1.27)] (see Fig. 3).
To compare the use of specific antipsoriatic drugs, inde-
pendent from the PsoReg, the number of patients nationwide
prescribed one of the two commonly used psoriasis-specific

 treatments—ustekinumab or calcipotriol (with or without
corticosteroid)—was investigated in the PDR. Of the
patients prescribed calcipotriol between 2006 and 2014, on
average 43.3% (range 41.9–44.1%) were women. Similarly,
39.6% (range 34.8–43.8%) of patients prescribed ustek-
inumab between 2010 and 2014 were women.
4 Discussion
We observed that women have less severe psoriasis com-
pared with men, after controlling for several possible
confounders. By analyzing the separate PASI elements, we
further confirmed that the lower PASI score in women is
consistent and is not a result of chance variations. In a
multivariable linear regression, controlling for several
other factors, this difference remained statistically signifi-
cant. The difference in all but one of the distinct elements
of the PASI score was also significant, both in unadjusted
comparisons of medians and in the ordinal logistic
regression models adjusted by age, BMI, disease duration,
concomitant PsA, smoking status, and season. However,
with respect to the head, women’s and men’s PASI scores
were equal (Figs. 2, 3). This is probably a consequence of
sex- and gender-specific differences in hair growth, care,
and styling, with women both (1) ‘shielding’ their scalp
from the beneficial effect of sunlight on psoriasis [19, 20],
and (2) provoking their head psoriasis via the Koebner
reaction [21], to such an extent that it falls into a similar
range as males.

 Previous studies have shown that specialist treatment in
psoriasis care is unbalanced, with men being more likely to
undergo specialist treatment than women [9, 13]. In the
PsoReg, approximately 60% of registered patients are men.
Most other European Registries for systemic psoriasis
treatment show an even larger dominance of registered
men: Denmark 66%, Germany 60%, Italy 67%, The
Netherlands 68%, and Spain 63% [22].
We employed the PDR to evaluate the nationwide pre-
scription of two psoriasis-specific treatments, independent
from the PsoReg. Both the biologic ustekinumab and
topical treatments with calcipotriol were, to a larger extent,
prescribed to men (55–60%). The PASI score, at enrolment
in the PsoReg, shows that women have significantly lower
disease activity compared with men across all ages,
including women of both fertile- and non-fertile age
(Fig. 1), making it unlikely that a restrictive prescription of
systemic psoriasis treatment for women of fertile age is a
relevant factor. Other differences between men and women
that were shown at enrolment are merely a reflection of
demographic factors that can be observed in the general
population, and indicate a representative enrolment in the
PsoReg. On average, men have a higher BMI than women,
while a higher proportion of women smoke and suffer from
joint disease.
In a descriptive study from Ireland, it was observed that
twice as many men (n = 93) received systemic treatment
compared with women (n = 53) [p = 0.015], and that
women had less severe psoriasis (experienced by the
clinicians) compared with men [10]. In a retrospective
study from Japan, Sakai et al. explored the prognostic
factors for the long-term outcome of plaque psoriasis
patients (109 men and 60 women) in a logistic regression,
and found that men developed more severe psoriasis

 according to the Dermatology Index of Disease Severity
during follow-up compared with women (p = 0.046), after
adjusting for age and BMI [23]. Furthermore, in a ques-
tionnaire survey based on 5739 patients, Zachariae et al.
showed that men received more systemic treatment in the
form of retinoids, calcipotriol, and psoralen plus ultraviolet
A (PUVA) as well as non-PUVA phototherapy than
women, after adjusting for a self-assessed disease severity
measurement [11]. These findings correspond with our
results as a majority of patients registered in the national
registry for systemic treatment of psoriasis in Sweden
(PsoReg) were men (59.1%) and had more severe psoriasis
than women.
In several other studies, it has been shown that women
received less (systemic) psoriasis treatment compared with
men; however, as these studies did not consider disease
severity [9, 13], different interpretations were made. Pre-
vious attempts to take disease severity into consideration
when analyzing the consumption of care have been carried
out by either questionnaires or the critical assessment tool
Dermatology Index of Disease Severity [24]. The objective
disease measurement PASI is traditionally used in ran-
domized clinical trials only [25]. The registry-based
integration of the objective disease measurement PASI
enabled a detailed analysis of disease activity in a nation-
wide unselected population. As such, this study showed sex
differences in the severity of psoriasis with a high level of
detail. PsoReg-independent analyses of the PDR corrobo-
rated these findings.
4.1 Limitations
The generalizability of this study is limited to patients with
moderate to severe psoriasis in need of systemic treatment
managed by dermatology specialists. The PASI is the gold
standard for assessing the severity of psoriasis. The
assessment is an objective description of disease severity,
and PASI has good inter- and intra-rater reliability [26, 27].
There is a theoretical possibility that the observed differ-
ences between the sexes with regard to disease severity are
due to the selective recruitment of patients to PsoReg. For
this to be true, dermatologists would either be more
inclined to register men with high disease activity than
women with high disease activity, or, conversely, women
with a low PASI score would be more likely to be regis-
tered in PsoReg than men with a low PASI score. However,

 we have not looked at other dimensions of psoriasis
severity, such as the DLQI. Considering this, if women are
more inclined to be enrolled in the PsoReg due to a high
DLQI score, while having a lower PASI score, this could
theoretically explain some of the discrepancies between the
severity of sexes shown in this study. However, one would
still wonder why women with a high PASI score did not
find their way into the register. Taken together, these sce-
narios are not likely, especially when considering (1) the
dominance of men registered in the registries for systemic
psoriasis treatment all over Europe; (2) previous descrip-
tions of higher consumption of systemic psoriasis treatment
by men [9, 10]; and, finally, (3) the PsoReg-independent
dominance of men in the PDR for both psoriasis- specific
treatments (calcipotriol and ustekinumab) demonstrated
here.
5 Conclusions
For more than 70 years it has been speculated that women
have less severe psoriasis compared with men. By inves-
tigating, for the first time, the sex differences in the severity
of psoriasis using the gold standard of severity measure-
ment—the PASI score—and the distinct elements of the
PASI score, we were able to corroborate this thesis in a
nationwide population. Further research is needed to sub-
stantiate this finding in different populations.
