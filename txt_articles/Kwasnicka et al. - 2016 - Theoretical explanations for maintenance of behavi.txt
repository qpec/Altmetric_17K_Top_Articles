ABSTRACT
Background: Behaviour change interventions are effective in supporting
individuals in achieving temporary behaviour change. Behaviour change
maintenance, however, is rarely attained. The aim of this review was to
identify and synthesise current theoretical explanations for behaviour
change maintenance to inform future research and practice.
Methods: Potentially relevant theories were identified through systematic
searches of electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO). In
addition, an existing database of 80 theories was searched, and 25
theory
experts
were
consulted.
Theories
were
included
if
they
formulated hypotheses about behaviour change maintenance. Included
theories
were
synthesised
thematically
to
ascertain
overarching
explanations for behaviour change maintenance. Initial theoretical
themes were cross-validated.
Findings: One hundred and seventeen behaviour theories were identified,
of which 100 met the inclusion criteria. Five overarching, interconnected
themes representing theoretical explanations for behaviour change
maintenance emerged. Theoretical explanations of behaviour change
maintenance focus on the differential nature and role of motives, self-
regulation,
resources
(psychological
and
physical),
habits,
and
environmental and social influences from initiation to maintenance.
Discussion: There are distinct patterns of theoretical explanations for
behaviour change and for behaviour change maintenance. The findings
from
this
review
can
guide
the
development
and
evaluation
of
interventions promoting maintenance of health behaviours and help in
the development of an integrated theory of behaviour change maintenance.

Introduction
Importance of behaviour maintenance
There is considerable evidence that behaviour can be effectively modified through behaviour change
interventions (Albarracin et al., 2005; Hobbs et al., 2013). However, evidence for the sustainability of
behaviour change in response to interventions is limited (Avenell et al., 2004; Carpenter et al., 2013;
Dombrowski, Knittle, Avenell, Araújo-Soares, & Sniehotta, 2014; Fjeldsoe, Neuhaus, Winkler, & Eakin,
2011). This is partly because few studies evaluate long-term effects and partly because intervention

 effects diminish over time (Curioni & Lourenco, 2005; Dombrowski, Avenell, & Sniehotta, 2010).
Relapse rates are high for individuals who join weight loss programmes (Tsai & Wadden, 2005);
initiate smoking cessation attempts (Carpenter et al., 2013; Hughes, Keely, & Naud, 2004); try to
reduce alcohol consumption (Moos & Moos, 2006) or make attempts to stop sexual risk behaviours
(Kelly, Stlawrence, & Brasfield, 1991). Theory of behaviour change maintenance can provide guidance
on the development and evaluation of interventions promoting sustained change in health beha-
viours. Current evidence about the effectiveness of theory-based interventions to change health-
related behaviours is inconsistent (Gourlan et al., 2015; Prestwich et al., 2014) which may, in part,
be due to the lack of theoretical elaboration on the process of maintenance after initial change.
Conceptual background to the analysis of behaviour change maintenance theories
To facilitate the review and synthesis of a wide range of theories with varied objectives, it is helpful
first to briefly rehearse their conceptual background in the psychology of behaviour. In any given situ-
ation individuals have various behavioural options. These behavioural options might be intentionally
and/or impulsively driven and may be predicated by prior behaviour. Each of these options has a
certain likelihood of being enacted at any given time, reflecting current individual (motivation,
habits, resources) and contextual (cues, opportunity costs and opportunities) factors. This likelihood
of enacting each behavioural response at a given time and in a given context has been termed a
‘behavioural potential’ by Rotter (1960). Similarly, Heckhausen and Beckmann (1990) conceptualised
the variable feature of how strongly an intention is predisposed for implementation in a given situ-
ation as ‘fiat tendencies’. Behavioural potentials vary over time and context as illustrated in a fictional
example in Figure 1. The individual is hypothesised to enact the behavioural option with the highest
potential in each situation and time (Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990; Rotter, 1960).
Before behaviour change, prior behaviour, such as unhealthy eating patterns, may be the domi-
nant response across times and contexts. After behaviour change, newly adopted behaviour may
become the dominant response in many contexts. Area A in Figure 1 illustrates times when enacting
the newly adopted behaviour is the dominant response, area B shows times when the prior behaviour
becomes dominant again, indicating the risk of a potential lapse. The new behaviour is likely to be
maintained over time if it becomes the dominant response across contexts. Thus, a theoretical analy-
sis of behaviour change maintenance will need to take into consideration various behavioural options
and the probability of them being enacted over time and across contexts. It is currently unclear what
conditions are required to maintain the new behaviour and prevent relapse, or to re-establish the
new behaviour after relapse.

 Theory and behaviour change maintenance
For the purpose of this review, theory was defined as a set of statements that organises, predicts and
explains observations. Theory explains how phenomena relate to each other, and what can be
expected under unknown conditions (Bem & Looren de Jong, 1997). Theory may be useful for
research to improve our understanding of maintained behaviour as well as for the design and
implementation of interventions to achieve behaviour change maintenance (Craig et al., 2008). To
date there has been no comprehensive review or synthesis of theories to explain behaviour
change maintenance. The aim of this review was therefore to identify and synthesise theoretical
explanations for behaviour change maintenance from behavioural theories and to examine the
relationships between these explanations. Theories for maintenance of any human behaviour were
examined; however, our particular interest was in the application of the findings to health behaviours.
The main research question was what are the current theoretical explanations for behaviour change
maintenance?
Methods
Design
Systematic review of behaviour theories. Table 1 provides a summary of methods.
Theory identification
Theories were identified in three ways:
.
Systematic database searches were performed to identify theories which met the inclusion criteria
(see below). Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo databases were searched using a comprehensive
search strategy (Appendix 1), a maintenance-relevant set of search terms included ‘maintenance’,
‘behaviour maintenance’, ‘maintain’, ‘sustain’, ‘sustained behaviour’, ‘sustained change’, ‘habit’ and
‘maintenance stage’ as well as appropriate synonyms, and American spellings, adjusted in accord-
ance with the particular database. There was no time limit applied. The search was updated on 1
March 2014.
.
Eighty theories from a systematic review of behaviour change theories across psychology, soci-
ology, anthropology and economics were reviewed for inclusion (Michie, Campbell, Brown, &
West, 2014).1
.
Forty behaviour change theory experts were contacted and asked to identify any theories relevant
to behaviour change maintenance; experts were defined as theory authors or critics.
.
For each theory, key articles were identified based on relevance and citations (Appendix 2).

 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: Theories published in any language before 1 March 2014 related to behaviour
change maintenance based on the following operational definitions (‘theory’ and ‘behaviour’ defi-
nitions taken from Michie et al., 2014):
Theory: A set of concepts and/or statements with specification of how phenomena relate to each
other. Theory provides an organising description of a system that accounts for what is known, and
explains and predicts phenomena.
Behaviour: Anything an individual does in response to internal or external events. Overt action
(motor or verbal) which is directly measurable; behaviours are physical events that occur in the
body and are controlled by the brain.
Behaviour change maintenance: The continuous performance of a behaviour following an initial
intentional change at a level that significantly differs from the baseline performance in the intended
direction. While some authors have suggested time cut-offs for behaviour change and transition to
behaviour change maintenance (Prochaska & Di Clemente, 1983; Prochaska, DiClemente, & Norcross,
1992), a time cut-off was not indicated here, as they may vary depending on behaviour, context and
individual factors.
Exclusion criteria: (a) Theories about animal behaviour; (b) theories exclusively based on research
with animals and (c) unpublished theories presented in dissertations and doctoral theses. Screening
was conducted by two reviewers. All cases where inclusion/exclusion was unclear were discussed and
agreed within the research team.
Data extraction
Each theory was allocated a unique ID (Appendix 3). The theory name and its full references were
recorded. Initially, verbatim statements about behaviour change maintenance and explanations of
behaviour change maintenance based on interpretations of the theoretical statements were
extracted from each theory using a standardised data extraction form. In addition, intended theoreti-
cal applications including behaviour, context or population specificity were extracted if stated. Data
was extracted by one reviewer and two other reviewers each independently extracted data from 10%
of the included articles. Extraction forms were compared resulting in full agreement between the
reviewers.
Data synthesis
Explanatory hypotheses for behaviour change maintenance were initially extracted by one
researcher. The data synthesis team met regularly over 18 months to discuss each of the theories
from the dataset and confirm the extracted theory statements. The data synthesis team consisted
of the authors with backgrounds in psychology and public health who have experience in research-
ing and applying behavioural theories, and in conducting systematic reviews and qualitative syn-
thesis. For each theory, statements about maintenance were extracted verbatim and transformed
into simple, jargon-free explanatory hypotheses about maintenance. This allowed for the grouping
of similar explanatory hypotheses across theories. The outcome of the meetings was a list of summa-
tive explanatory hypotheses about behaviour change maintenance derived from all included
theories.
Thematic theoretical analysis of the explanatory hypotheses was employed to synthesise the data
and identify patterns of theoretical explanations (themes). The analysis followed a staged process
including familiarisation with quotes and their interpretations, generating initial codes (specific
themes and subthemes), assessing themes among codes (overlapping characteristics), reviewing
themes, defining and naming themes and producing a final report. After theory themes were gener-
ated overlaps and relationships between themes were analysed. Their relationship and dependencies
280
D. KWASNICKA ET AL.
 are described in the discussion. Thematic analysis was used to generate a concise set of summative
explanatory constructs and propositions about their role in the maintenance of behaviour change.
These summative constructs represent broad themes based on commonalities between theoretical
explanations in terms of constructs and assumed mechanisms. The theoretical propositions within
each theme were further organised by subthemes, illustrated by subheaders in the results section.
The themes resulting from the data synthesis were cross-validated by 10 health psychology
researchers not familiar with the current review. They evaluated the validity of themes by allocating
each of a randomly selected 10% of the total extracted theoretical statements to themes (Appendix 4).
Allocation of one statement to more than one theme was permitted. Inter-rater agreement on allo-
cation of themes was calculated as Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 2012).
Results
A total of 264 records were identified through the search strategy. After removal of duplicates, 171
records were screened for eligibility. Full texts of 117 theories (Appendix 2) were examined, out of
which 100 published theories met the inclusion criteria (see Figure 2 for PRISMA diagram). To
further validate the search, 40 international theory experts were contacted, out of them, 25 replied
suggesting theories with relevant hypotheses for behaviour change maintenance. The most commonly
suggested theories were the transtheoretical model of change (n = 11) (suggested by Prochaska &
Di Clemente, 1983; Prochaska et al., 1992); the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) (n = 10)
(Schwarzer, 1992, 2008); social cognitive theory (n = 9) (Bandura, 1986); Marlatt’s relapse prevention

 theory (n = 9) (Marlatt & George, 1984; Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2004); Rothman’s theory of maintenance
(n = 8) (Rothman, 2000; Rothman, Baldwin, & Hertel, 2004; Rothman, Sheeran, & Wood, 2009); self-
determination theory (n = 7) (Ryan & Deci, 2000) and habit theories (n = 6) (Verplanken & Aarts,
1999; Verplanken & Orbell, 2003) (Gardner, 2015).
Among the 100 included theories, 73 were behaviour specific (see Appendix 3). Fifty-three out of
the 73 behaviour specific theories explained health-related behaviours. Most of the health behaviour
specific theories built upon other existing theories and applied these to behaviour specific contexts.
Twenty-six theories were behaviour specific and population specific; all population specific theories
included in this review were also behaviour specific.
How do current theories explain behaviour change maintenance?
Many behavioural theories do not explicitly address the issue of behavioural maintenance. Forty-
three included theories involved assumptions of dynamic reciprocity, meaning assumptions that
explanatory variables are modified through exposure to the target behaviour. For example, social
cognition models, such as the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) hypothesise that behaviour
is a function of cognitions about the desirability and controllability of behaviour. Repeated perform-
ance may lead to a re-evaluation of the behaviour and the individual may realise that it is less desirable
or controllable than they thought when they adopted the behaviour. While many theories suggest
that maintained behaviour is explained within the same theoretical constructs as behaviour initiation,
the content (e.g., self-efficacy), direction and value of the constructs may change substantially from
initiation to maintenance.
For the remaining theories where differential explanatory hypotheses for initiation and mainten-
ance could be derived, theory-guided thematic analysis resulted in five overarching interrelated
themes (Table 2). These themes were cross-validated by 10 psychologists, whose independent assess-
ments resulted in a high level of agreement (Krippendorff’s α = 0.87). The five themes reflect specific
theoretical explanations about how individuals maintain initial behaviour changes over time and in
different contexts. Themes focus on the changing roles of motives, self-regulation, habits, resources
and contextual factors from initial behaviour change to successful maintenance. Explanatory hypoth-
eses for behaviour change maintenance are described for each theme, followed by specific examples
taken from individual theories. Figure 3 provides an overview of the proposed inter-relationships
between the five theoretical themes.
Theme 1: Maintenance motives
Motives are the drivers for volitional behaviour. They help establishing priorities and allocating
resources. Initial behaviour change is often motivated by expectations of uncertain long-term out-
comes (e.g., changing one’s diet to reduce health risks). It has been hypothesised that maintenance
motives are often different from those motives that prompted individuals to make initial changes.
Motives are hypothesised to be particularly facilitating for maintenance if they enable regular grati-
fication from enacting the new behaviour, rather than from the experience of changing. For example,
by focusing on behaviour enjoyment, satisfaction with behavioural outcomes, self-determination or if
individuals experience congruence of the newly adopted behaviour with their identity, beliefs and
values.
Enjoyment of behaviour and satisfaction with outcomes
Behaviour is more likely to be sustained if the reinforcement structure emphasises immediate and
affective outcomes rather than long-term and rational outcomes. Motivation to avoid negative
health consequences is hypothesised to be insufficient to maintain preventive behaviour that
requires maintained effort. Therefore positive maintenance motives are needed (precaution adoption
process model – Weinstein, 1988; Weinstein & Sandman, 1992). Individuals engage more strongly in
282
D. KWASNICKA ET AL.
 what they are doing if they ‘feel right about it’ and if it fits with their decisions and prior engagement
(regulatory fit theory – Higgins, 2006). This may include the enjoyment of performing the behaviour
as such, or the enjoyment of immediate outcomes of the behaviour (temporal self-regulation theory –
Hall & Fong, 2007; model of behaviour maintenance – Rothman, 2000; Rothman et al., 2004; Gronin-
gen active living model – Stevens, Bult, de Greef, Lemmink, & Rispens, 1999). After initial adoption of
new behaviours individuals are theorised to evaluate the results of their efforts cognitively and
emotionally. If the actual results reflect the desired results, the initial motivation is reinforced, and indi-
viduals are likely to make positive self-judgements and to sustain their efforts (behavioural model of
medication adherence – De Bruin, Hosters, Van Den Borne, Kok, & Prins, 2005). The nature and timing
of anticipated and experienced outcomes impacts on behaviour change maintenance.
Self-determination
Immediate changes in behaviour are often motivated by extrinsic motivation (i.e., an individual think-
ing that they ought to comply with external demands). However, intrinsic motivation (i.e., the indi-
vidual wanting to maintain the new behaviour) is hypothesised to have a stronger influence on
behaviour maintenance than extrinsic motivation (self-determination theory – Deci & Ryan, 2000;
Ryan & Deci, 2000). Similarly, behaviour change is more likely to be maintained if a new behaviour
resembles an individual’s values and is perceived as personally relevant. Initially extrinsically motiv-
ated behaviour may develop intrinsic features over time and repeated performance.

 Identity
Individuals are thought to be more likely to maintain behaviours which are in line with the beliefs
they have about themselves (self-concept theory – Bracken, 1996; self-schema theory – Markus,
1977). Self-identity and nested beliefs and values can change as a result of engaging with a behav-
iour. For instance, an individual who exercises regularly can develop the self-representation of being
a sportsperson or a person who no longer smokes can develop the identity of a non-smoker. Such
changes in identity positively enhance behaviour change maintenance. These beliefs guide behav-
iour change maintenance as they lead and organise the processing of self-relevant information
and standards, and create ongoing positive experiences associated with the new behaviour.
Initial behaviour change that is triggered by a significant life event or crisis can cause a shift in an
individual’s identity (process of reinvention theory – Epiphaniou & Ogden, 2010; Ogden & Hills, 2008).
Such event-triggered changes are hypothesised to be particularly sustainable. A life event or crisis
usually relates to relationships, health or other changes in circumstances judged to be highly signifi-
cant. Behaviour change as a result of a life event is often maintained if the individual no longer per-
ceives themselves to benefit from the prior behaviour, if there are fewer opportunities to perform the
prior behaviour or if they believe that the prior behaviour was the cause of the crisis. Individuals
experience shifts in their beliefs, followed by identity changes which support behaviour change main-
tenance (Epiphaniou & Ogden, 2010).
Congruence with identity is theorised as a key feature of behaviour internalisation processes,
behavioural regulation and behaviour change maintenance (health behaviour internalisation
model – Bellg, 2003). Internalisation is described as the learning of values or attitudes. Self-needs
(i.e., identity, self-determination, security and support) and behaviour-related needs (i.e., preference,
context competence and coping) interact and influence internalisation and self-regulation of the new
health-related behaviour leading to behaviour change maintenance. Individuals are biased to self-
regulate their behaviour in line with their self-concept.

Note: STj describes the psychological situation S defined by features of the environment (e.g., available choices, external dis(incen-
tives), cues and opportunity costs) and personal features (e.g., motivation, automaticity) at time point Tj. New and prior behaviour
are competing against each other after initial behaviour change.

 Theme 2. Self-regulation
Self-regulation refers to any effort to actively control behaviour by inhibiting dominant and automatic
behaviours, urges, emotions or desires, and replacing those with goal-directed responses (Baumeis-
ter, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994). Theoretical explanations for behaviour change maintenance utilising
self-regulation focus on the need for active behaviour control, on self-regulation skill, and the
process of self-regulation and coping with barriers. Their relative contributions are dependent on per-
sonal resources, the strength of habits and environmental influences (Figure 3).
Self-regulation need
The need for active self-regulation changes over time and the course of the behaviour change
process. Figure 1 illustrates how the behavioural potential (dominance of response) of the new
behaviour and conflicting responses may vary over time as a result of individual and contextual
factors. Individuals often initiate behaviour change when the moment is right, e.g., at times when
opportunity costs and goal conflicts are low and motivation and capacity high. Context-specific
cues, options and opportunity costs as well as varying levels of motivation may increase the risk of
momentary lapses (Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990; Rotter, 1960).
In particular, self-regulation is thought to be needed when new behaviours are not fully automatic
and the behavioural potential of prior behaviours is still high (model of behaviour maintenance –
Rothman, 2000; Rothman et al., 2004). Temporal changes in motivation to maintain behaviour
change are directly related to self-regulation need; when motivation decreases, the need for active
self-regulation increases. Some theorists hypothesise that the need for self-regulation decreases as
individuals repeatedly engage in the new behaviour as they unlearn previous habits and develop
new ones (habit theory – Verplanken & Aarts, 1999) and build self-efficacy to maintain behaviour
(HAPA – Schwarzer, 1992, 2008). Conversely, some theoretical accounts suggest that the need for
self-regulation may increase over time as repeated effort and self-restriction result in ego depletion
(strength model of self-control – Baumeister, 2002, 2003; Baumeister & Heatherton, 1996) and
decrease in motivation over time.
Self-regulation skill
Individuals differ in their skill to regulate their behaviour, known as ‘self-regulatory capacity’ (tem-
poral self-regulation theory – Hall & Fong, 2007). Over time, costs and resources vary and the skill
to successfully self-regulate behaviour is more important when self-regulatory tasks are more challen-
ging. These stable differences in self-regulatory capacity are hypothesised to reflect executive control
functions (e.g., planning skill, inhibition control, task switching) and they explain the ability to over-
ride automated responses (Nederkoorn, Houben, Hofmann, Roefs, & Jansen, 2010). Those with lower
self-regulatory capacity are hypothesised to show weaker intention–behaviour relationships (Hall,
Fong, Epp, & Elias, 2008). With time and repetition, individuals may develop better skills to actively
self-regulate their behaviour (model of self-control – Muraven & Baumeister, 2000).
Self-regulation processes
Self-regulation includes the ongoing processes of self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reinforce-
ment (Kanfer & Karoly, 1972) as well as dealing with temptations, hedonistic and impulsive influences
that are in conflict with long-term goals. Behaviour change maintenance is theorised as an outcome
of active and on-going self-regulation. The process of self-regulation is based on a system of hier-
archically organised goals. Individuals monitor their behaviour against their goals and adjust their
efforts if they perceive discrepancy between the current and a desired state (control theory –
Carver & Scheier, 1982). If no discrepancy is detected or if behaviour exceeds standards, the individual
will feel satisfied (self-regulation theory – Kanfer & Gaelick-Buys, 1991). Behaviour that falls short of
relevant goals causes dissatisfaction and leads the individual to either spend more efforts or disen-
gage from the goal.

 Lapse, relapse and coping with behavioural barriers
Self-regulation involves coping with behavioural barriers, overcoming temptations, managing lapses
and avoiding relapses. A lapse is a singular event in which an individual deviates from their desired
goal (e.g., a cigarette smoked during an abstinence attempt). It may occur when the behavioural
potential is high for the prior behaviour and when motivation to adhere to new health behaviour
is low. A relapse is a sequence of lapses strung together, a setback, that causes reversion to the
prior behaviour (e.g., regular smoking) (Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2004). Relapse prevention theory
includes variables that directly influence behaviour change maintenance, but not necessarily behav-
iour initiation, including interpersonal stress, cravings, mood and self-efficacy for managing lapses
(Hendershot, Witkiewitz, George, & Marlatt, 2011).
In response to situations with a high risk of lapse or relapse, individuals may apply effective coping
responses and as a result their self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancies increase and the prob-
ability of future relapse decreases (relapse prevention theory – Marlatt & George, 1984). Nevertheless,
individuals may fail to apply effective coping responses in high risk situations and as a result their self-
efficacy and positive outcome expectancies decrease; then individuals often return to their prior
behaviour and their probability of future relapses increases (Marlatt & George, 1984).
In order to maintain a behaviour, an individual needs to develop high coping self-efficacy to over-
come barriers (HAPA – Schwarzer, 1992, 2008). An individual with a high level of coping self-efficacy
responds confidently to behavioural barriers with effective behaviour change maintenance strategies
(i.e., action planning and coping planning), with sustained effort and prolonged persistence. Recovery
self-efficacy, on the other hand, addresses the experience of failure followed by the recovery from a
setback (HAPA – Schwarzer, 2008). Coping planning involves prospectively linking coping strategies
to anticipated barriers to behaviour change (Sniehotta, Schwarzer, Scholz, & Schuz, 2005). Action
planning is considered to be more important during behaviour initiation, whereas coping planning
is hypothesised to facilitate behaviour change maintenance (Sniehotta et al., 2005).
Theme 3. Habits
Habits are actions that have become automatically triggered by situational cues (Lally, Van Jaarsveld,
Potts, & Wardle, 2010; Verplanken, 2006). Habit development follows a period of successful self-regu-
lation of a new behaviour. Consciously controlled behaviours become automatic over time with rep-
etition and are theorised to be performed outside of conscious awareness (Hofmann, Friese, & Wiers,
2008; Hunt & Martin, 1988; Rothman et al., 2009; Verplanken & Aarts, 1999). Developing new favour-
able, habitual cue responses can help maintain new behaviours, however the stronger prior habits
are, the more likely an individual is to lapse to the prior behaviour. Removing cues that may
trigger unhealthy behaviour from the environment supports behaviour change maintenance by
means of stimulus control (transtheoretical model of change – Prochaska & Di Clemente, 1983; Pro-
chaska et al., 1992).
Dual process models and habit theories
In dual process models behaviour is theorised to be governed by the interplay of two regulatory
systems, a reflective system, which is based on conscious deliberation, controlled but effortful,
which aims to override a quicker automatic system that responds in line with habits and impulses
(dual-system models – Strack & Deutsch, 2004). Individuals can maintain behaviour through
ongoing self-regulation, however, self-regulation draws on finite psychological resources which
can be depleted. When resources are low self-regulation is likely to fail. Thus, the most sustainable
mechanism for maintenance is to develop automaticity for the newly adopted behaviour.
Behaviour is a function of reflective and automatic processes (health-related model of behaviour
change – Hunt & Martin, 1988; 2 × 2 behaviour change matrix – Rothman et al., 2009; theory of inter-
personal behaviour – Triandis, 1977). Higher levels of cognitive processing are usually not necessary
286
D. KWASNICKA ET AL.
 when activities become habitual. Habitual behaviours are carried out with minimum awareness while
conscious behaviours are performed only occasionally. Relegation of habits to lower levels of con-
sciousness is seen as part of the human adaptation process. Individuals are able to deal with a
large number of internal and external stimuli because habitual behaviours require minimum levels
of awareness and resources. Higher level self-regulation, decision-making and monitoring processes
can then deal with more novel features of the environment. Habit facilitates behaviour change main-
tenance as desired activities become habitual, taking place outside of conscious awareness (habit
theory – Verplanken & Aarts, 1999). Reflective and automatic influences are altered by boundary con-
ditions (i.e., habitualness, ego depletion (impulsive versus reflective framework) Hofmann et al., 2008).
Learning theories and habit
Learning theories provide explanations for the influence of the environment on behaviour and for the
development of habits. Repetition and reinforcement are considered as a key to habit formation (and
associative theories of goal-directed behaviour – de Wit & Dickinson, 2009; Pavlovian instrumental
transfer – Hall, Parkinson, Connor, Dickinson, & Everitt, 2001; classical conditioning – Pavlov, 1927
and operant conditioning – Skinner, 1953; two-factor avoidance theory – Stasiewicz & Maisto,
1993). Behaviour change maintenance is promoted by a number of factors such as situating new
learning in the most relevant contexts, providing retrieval cues after the new learning is complete,
and varying the contexts in which the new learning takes place (a learning theory perspective on
the maintenance of behaviour change – Bouton, 2000). Learning theories provide a wide range of
explanations for how new behaviours are acquired and become habitual.
In order to maintain behaviour it is hypothesised that it is beneficial for individuals to be con-
ditioned to certain behavioural responses occurring in a given situational context. For new con-
ditioned reflexes to be established any external stimulus (which will become the signal in a
conditioned reflex) must overlap in time with the action of an unconditioned stimulus (classical con-
ditioning – Pavlov, 1927). After repeated association of a stimulus with a behavioural response, main-
tenance of behaviour develops. Individuals can be conditioned to perform new behaviours if a
stimulus and its behavioural response become associated; to break an existing association, stimuli
and response must be disassociated (classical conditioning – Pavlov, 1927; operant conditioning –
Skinner, 1953). For instance when individuals adopt a new, healthy diet, they are conditioned to
certain stimuli (e.g., lunch time), which produces a situational response (e.g., consuming a salad).
Repeated association of stimuli and response leads to behaviour change maintenance. Unleaning
or disassociation is a slow process and in some cases does not occur for behaviours which are
engrained and thus still remain response options even after many years of not practicing them.
Theme 4. Resources
Resources are psychological and physical assets that can be drawn on during the process of behav-
ioural regulation. As maintaining behaviour change is often difficult and requires sustained efforts,
resources available to the individual are hypothesised to play an important role. When resources
are limited or depleted due to stress, tiredness, exhaustion and intoxication, an individual’s self-regu-
latory capacity is limited.
Individuals are more likely to initiate behaviour change at times when their psychological and
physical resources are plentiful and when opportunity costs (effort needed to enact behaviour) are
low (i.e., resources are not immediately needed for competing demands). Over time opportunity
costs and resources vary and habitual behaviours are likely to dominate when resources are
limited (see Figure 1, situation B). The processes of breaking old habits and developing new ones
are likely to act in conjunction for behaviour change maintenance. Lapse and relapse are thus,
theorised to be associated with low levels of resources.
Dual process models offer a perspective on understanding how resources impact on behaviour
change maintenance. It is hypothesised that behaviour can be governed by either a resource-
HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
287
 intensive reflective system or a mostly automated impulsive system and that resources act as mod-
erators (boundary conditions) determining which of the system generates the response (dual-system
models (impulsive versus reflective framework) Hofmann et al., 2008; dual-system models – Strack &
Deutsch, 2004). Even when cognitive resources are limited effective maintenance can occur if the
behaviour is habitually instigated.
Self-regulation as a limited resource
It is suggested that self-regulation draws on finite mental resources which become depleted through
the use of self-regulatory processes and take time and to rest and recover (strength model of self-
control – Baumeister, 2003; Hagger, Wood, Stiff, & Chatzisarantis, 2009; Muraven & Baumeister,
2000). Coping with stress, resisting temptations, and controlling emotions requires additional self-
regulatory efforts and each additional attempt to self-regulate is more likely to fail. When cognitive
resources are limited, individuals who are actively self-regulating to engage in a new behaviour are
prone to engaging in impulsive or automatic actions which reflect the prior behaviour (strength
model of self-control – Baumeister, 2002, 2003; Baumeister & Heatherton, 1996). For instance,
dieters are vulnerable to uncontrolled eating when cognitive processes are disrupted (dietary
restraint theory – Polivy & Herman, 1985). Self-regulation or willpower draw upon a mental resource
and require energy which can be depleted; individuals who actively self-regulate are less effective at
subsequent tasks that also require self-control (Hagger et al., 2013). Rest and positive affect help
restore these resources (Baumeister, 2003).
Inter-individual differences in resources and resources availability
There are inter-individual differences in the availability of cognitive resources required to override
automatic responses (dual-system models – Strack & Deutsch, 2004). When resources are in short
supply, the automatic system overrides the reflective one, often leading to maintenance failure. Dis-
positional or situational moderators shift the weight between impulsive and reflective influences
(impulsive versus reflective framework – Hofmann et al., 2008). Restrained cognitive resources
paired with unconscious positive expectations towards unhealthy behaviour may hinder behaviour
change maintenance. Conditions that have been hypothesised to also hinder behaviour change
maintenance, include ego depletion (Collins & Lapp, 1992), high cognitive load (Friese, Hofmann,
& Wanke, 2008), low working memory capacity (Fletcher, Marks, & Hine, 2011), and the influence
of alcohol and other substances (Gunn, Finn, Endres, Gerst, & Spinola, 2013).
Throughout the lifespan, social and individual resources change and individuals develop, elabor-
ate and commit to individual goals (model of selection, optimisation and compensation – Baltes,
1997). Goal selection can be elective or in response to experienced change in resources. During elec-
tive goal selection individuals define their goals in order to match their individual needs and motives.
Loss-based goal selection is a response to the loss of previously available resources. Optimisation
refers to acquiring, applying and refining goal-directed means. Individuals adjust their goals to
focus or redirect their efforts to maintain functioning or they substitute for a functional loss via
compensation.
Theme 5. Environment and social influences
The final theme includes features of the social and environmental context of action which provide
available options, sets incentives and disincentives, opportunity costs and cues with contingency
for behavioural responses. This theme includes aspects of the choice architecture that alter the
opportunity costs and accessibility of behaviour options (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). Many theories
emphasise the role of a supportive external environment on behaviour change maintenance, and
most ecological models of behaviour suggest equal explanations for behaviour initiation and main-
tenance (Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1986; McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988; Panter-Brick, Clarke,
Lomas, Pinder, & Lindsay, 2006). However, some theories such as habit theories (Hofmann et al., 2008;
288
D. KWASNICKA ET AL.
 Hunt & Martin, 1988; Rothman et al., 2009; Verplanken & Aarts, 1999), hypothesise that environmental
cues related to prior and newly adopted behaviours explain whether or not a newly adopted behav-
iour is maintained. A supportive environment, positive social influences and constructive social
change facilitate maintenance of behaviour change as it lowers the opportunity costs of the new
behaviour. Environmental factors determine the amount of active self-regulation and resource
required by the individual and behaviour change is less likely to be maintained in environments
which are not conducive of the newly adopted behaviour (Mackenbach et al., 2014).
Environment
As active self-regulation is effortful, the default mode is to respond to the behavioural option most
facilitated by the environmental choice architecture (Figure 1). Individuals may develop context-
dependent associations which are easy to maintain in the same environment (process model for sup-
porting lifestyle behaviour change – Greaves et al., 2010; impulsive versus reflective framework –
Hofmann et al., 2008; 2 × 2 behaviour change matrix – Rothman et al., 2009; habit theory – Verplanken
& Aarts, 1999). It is theorised that if individuals change their context, they are more likely to perform
non-habitual behaviour (habit theory – Verplanken, Walker, Davis, & Jurasek, 2008). When the environ-
ment changes, a window of opportunity opens for habit change (habit theory – Verplanken et al., 2008)
and individuals may be more likely to maintain habitual behaviours in stable contexts. Environmental
changes can present a threat for habitual behaviours but also opportunity for new behaviours.
Social influence
Like environmental factors, social influence affects the opportunity costs and incentive structure for
behavioural options in a given context. It can affect the effort needed to perform new behaviours.
Provided support can increase individual capacity to maintain behaviour (e.g., by providing encour-
agement or help). Social influence occurs when an individual’s opinions, emotional states and beha-
viours are affected by others. Knowledge and skills are acquired through social modelling; the
observation and replication of other peoples’ actions (social cognitive theory – Bandura, 1986).
Individuals are more likely to follow the guidance given to them by people they trust and they feel
connected to (Bandura, 1986). Thus, to maintain a new behaviour a sense of relatedness must be
developed (self-determination theory – Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000). Group membership
define individuals; individuals are motivated to evaluate their group positively, usually showing a pre-
ference for a group they belong to as compared to other groups (social identity theory – Turner,
1987). Individuals attempt to achieve or to maintain positive social identity (social identity model –
Tajfel & Turner, 1979). They sustain actions which are in line with group norms and which are
approved by group members (e.g., substance abuse theory – Neff & MacMaster, 2005). Thus, individ-
uals tend to follow the social norms and rules of the group they belong to.
Social change – how norms are shaped, accepted and maintained
Social change can facilitate behaviour change maintenance. Large-scale behavioural change is often
achieved by changing the standards of what is acceptable in a given community (social change
theory – Thompson & Kinne, 1990). Social change is described as a three step process: unfreezing,
moving and freezing (theory of change – Lewin, 1951) or implementation, embedding and sustaining
(normalisation process theory – May & Finch, 2009; May et al., 2009). The process of freezing is similar
to maintaining newly introduced behaviours, which have become social norms and which are
accepted in the given context (theory of change – Lewin, 1951). ‘Social habits’ are socially accepted
behaviours that are resistant to change; ‘a quasi-stationary equilibrium state’ is stable and susceptible
to change state which at the same time is underpinned by an on-going social process (theory of
change – Lewin, 1951). Sustaining embedded practices in their social contexts, also called ‘inte-
gration’, is relevant to maintaining behaviours (normalisation process theory – May & Finch, 2009;
May et al., 2009). Through social change, practice can become routinely embedded in everyday
life. For social change to be maintained, individuals should feel responsible for the programmes

 promoting change and they should take control over them so they continue to maintain them after
initial organising efforts (social change theory – Thompson & Kinne, 1990).
Discussion
Main findings
By systematically reviewing maintenance-relevant behaviour change theories, five overarching inter-
connected theoretical themes emerged: maintenance motives, self-regulation, resources, habits and
contextual influences. Based on these themes, differential hypotheses for the initiation and mainten-
ance of health-related behaviours have been formulated. In Figure 3 a graphical illustration of the
review findings is presented, integrating these theoretical themes, and summarising current theoreti-
cal concepts relevant for behaviour change maintenance.
Individuals need at least one sustained motivator to maintain behaviour; these may include behav-
iour enjoyment, satisfaction with behavioural outcomes, self-determination or an experience of behav-
ioural congruence with beliefs and values, all of which often develop after initiating a new behaviour. It
is likely that individuals start behaviour change attempts at times when their motivation is at the
highest and opportunity costs are low (Figure 1). As motivation and opportunity costs regress to the
mean (i.e., as motivation decreases and costs increase), the need for self-regulatory effort is increased
in order to ensure that the new behaviour continues despite less than optimal conditions.
The ongoing and active use of limited cognitive self-regulatory resources can result in ego
depletion, with stress, tiredness, substance use and negative affect also leading to a decreased
ability to exert control over, or self-regulate, behaviour. At different times and depending on the avail-
ability of cognitive resources, motivation and level of depletion, behaviour change maintenance may
alternate between needing to be actively self-regulated and being automatic, context-driven and
effortless. With repeated performance of a new behaviour, the need for conscious self-regulation
decreases and behaviour becomes habitual, which in turn increases the chance that it will be
maintained.
Behaviour, whether under conscious control or occurring automatically and habitually, occurs
within an environmental and social context, with such influences serving to either facilitate or
hinder behaviour change maintenance. As with the initiation of behaviour change, stable contexts
make behaviour and habits easier to sustain. Thus, ecological factors are important for both behav-
iour initiation and maintenance.
Comparison with other studies
This systematic theory review adds to existing knowledge by providing a comprehensive review of
theories to identify theoretical hypotheses about maintained behaviour change. While previous
reviews have focused on behaviour change (Cane, O’Connor, & Michie, 2012; Michie et al., 2005),
this is the first review to specifically assess theoretical explanations for behaviour change mainten-
ance. Overall, this review provides a summary of theoretical explanations for behaviour change main-
tenance; however, further research is needed to test the proposed relationships within and between
the emerging themes.
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this review is the comprehensive and rigorous search and the thematic theor-
etical synthesis of available theories addressing behaviour change maintenance. In this study, a new
approach to theory analysis was presented, including identification of theoretical explanations and
theory synthesis specifically in relation to behaviour change maintenance. This review not only ident-
ified themes that relate to behaviour change maintenance, but also resulted in the formulation of a
290
D. KWASNICKA ET AL.
 number of theoretical predictions including the inter-relationships and dependencies between
themes.
While the resulting summary provides a detailed description of broad themes and relationships
relevant to maintenance, for a more detailed account of specific predictions, individual theories
may be more relevant. In the validation exercise, experts were asked to assign theoretical statements
to the themes emerging from the synthesis in this review. It cannot be ruled out, that a different set of
themes would have represented the data equally well or better.
This theory review drew mainly on theories which were designed and/or assessed in the context of
health-related behaviours, and while the findings may be applicable to other contexts and beha-
viours, the degree of generalisability requires testing. While some theories have been tested
(Hagger et al., 2009; Kwasnicka, Presseau, White, & Sniehotta, 2013; McEachan, Conner, Taylor, &
Lawton, 2011) many theories lack systematic empirical evaluations. Similarly, the theoretical
themes that emerged in this review will require further evaluation, development and testing as
part of a systematic interative process of theory building (Head & Noar, 2014; Noar & Head, 2014;
Rhodes, 2014; Sniehotta, Presseau, & Araujo-Soares, 2015).
Unanswered questions and future research
The main contribution of this review is the identification of the main hypotheses for behaviour
change maintenance formulated in the theoretical literature to date. It provides a platform for
future research and practice in behaviour change maintenance, which is a key priority area in behav-
iour change science. Future research should systematically review the existing evidence for each
theoretical theme; and undertake further empirical testing of each explanation, followed by empirical
testing of an integrated theoretical model. Evidence from theory-based interventions should be used
to revise, refine or reject theoretical principles (Rothman, 2004). Dialogue between theory and prac-
tice is encouraged so that theories are not only used to design interventions, but interventions also
inform the redevelopment of theories. Predictions and theoretical explanations should be tested
across a variety of settings and populations, facilitating theory development. Future research
should focus on the informed development of behaviour change maintenance theory, test themes
presented within this review, explore relationships between themes and constructs, and add new
theoretical predictions.
Implications for health behaviour change maintenance and conclusions
The theoretical explanations described within the five overarching themes can be applied in health
contexts to help explain maintenance of health-related behaviours. Listed theoretical assumptions
may be applied to facilitate interventions targeting health promotion and maintenance of health
behaviours. They can serve as guidance for intervention developers who can target five maintenance
processes:
(1) Helping individuals to maintain positive behaviour change maintenance motives, emphasising
positive outcomes of a new health behaviour, providing behavioural options which are enjoy-
able, inspiring individuals to redefine themselves in line with new healthy lifestyle principles.
(2) Facilitating behaviour self-regulation; for instance through self-monitoring behaviour and
helping individuals to develop effective strategies to overcome behavioural barriers and to
prevent relapse.
(3) Facilitating habit development and maintenance for positive health behaviour changes; for
instance by reshaping the environment and making healthy options salient and by cuing individ-
uals towards healthy behaviours.
HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
291
 (4) Providing individuals with resources that are needed to successfully maintain a new health
behaviour. Resources can be physical (e.g., sport facilities, health products) or psychological
(e.g., self-regulation training, mindfulness and relaxation methods).
(5) Reshaping the environment at individual, social and community levels. Providing social support
and introducing social changes that are in line with positive health behaviour change maintenance.
Specific theoretical explanations of behaviour change maintenance have been presented in this
review. This review examined and summarised 100 theories that explicitly or implicitly explain
how individuals maintain new behaviours. Five theoretical themes included maintained motivation,
active self-regulation, habitual cue driven responses and boundary conditions including resources
and environmental factors. This review can act as a starting point on the journey towards an inte-
grated behaviour change maintenance theory.
