The accidental ingestion of a foreign object often presents a difficult scenario for the clinician. This includes not only the decision
to retrieve the material but also the appropriate technique to use. We present the case of a young asymptomatic girl who swallowed
a magnetic activity watch, which was then successfully retrieved with an endoscopic snare. To our knowledge, this is the first
documented case of salvaging an operational watch from the stomach using an endoscopic technique.
1. Introduction
Foreign body ingestion is a challenging medical dilemma for
both surgeons and gastroenterologists, with the greatest inci-
dence seen in the psychiatric, elderly, and pediatric popula-
tions. The mechanism of ingestion varies based on the cohort
studied. The psychiatric population may have an altered
decision-making capability or will swallow objects for a sec-
ondary gain [1]. The elderly often have altered mental status,
decreased oropharyngeal sensation and control, and ill-fitting
dental appliances. The vast majority of cases, > 80%, occur in
children. However, only 10–20% require endoscopic removal,
with < 1% mandating an operation to remove the foreign body
[2, 3]. Younger children demonstrate the greatest risk as their
senses are developing and begin to explore their own envi-
ronment, frequently placing objects in their mouth [4]. The
object ingested, anatomical location, and age of the patient are
important factors when making the clinical decision to pur-
sue extraction through an invasive technique or to manage
the patient expectantly in hopes of transit through the gas-
trointestinal tract [5]. An endoscopic or operative approach
to extract dentures, batteries, or magnets is strongly recom-
mended, as these objects portend a greater risk of intesti-
nal laceration, perforation, obstruction, or luminal necrosis
[4, 6, 7].
As one may expect, there is a paucity of data in the
literature regarding the extraction of an ingested watch or
object with similar dimensions. One case report has discussed
the extraction of a watch through an open gastrostomy, three
cases have utilized an endoscopic approach for retrieval of an
impacted watch in the proximal esophagus, and one report
discussed successive esophageal balloon dilation, to dislodge
the timepiece, pushing it distally into the stomach to allow for
passage [8–11]. To our knowledge this is the first documented
case of a watch extraction from the stomach using a flexible
endoscope.
2. Case Report
This is a case of a healthy, well-developed, 13-year-old girl
who was reported to have accidentally swallowed a Shine
Misfit fitness tracking watch (Misfit Wearables, Burlingame,
CA, USA). While swimming, she removed the magnetized
functional portion of the watch from its band and placed this
in her mouth at which time it was swallowed by mistake.
At the time of presentation, the object was identified in
the stomach on an emergency department X-ray at our
community-sized hospital. The patient was initially managed
conservatively and was informed to return the following day
for serial imaging (Figure 1). After approximately 30 hours,
the watch was still retained in the stomach. Due to the failure
of distal progression through the pylorus and concern for
obstruction at the ileocecal valve, the decision was made to
proceed with an endoscopic intervention in the operating

room. The watch was magnetized, measuring 28.5 × 8.0 ×
28.5 mm (width × depth × height), which precluded grasping
the device [12]. The size and smooth oval shape of the watch
made capturing it with a wire basket or endoscopic snare
difficult (Figure 2). Finally, with no additional interventional
equipment available, a snare was used to manipulate the
device into the esophagus, where it was then secured uti-
lizing an end-on lassoing technique around the groove of
the watch. Once the device was fully encircled, it could
then be safely removed through the oropharynx (Figure 3).
Following this 72 min procedure, the patient recovered well
and was discharged home the following day with no apparent
sequela from the event. The watch retained normal function
despite the low pH of the stomach and manipulation upon
retrieval. When synchronized to her mobile device, the
Shine Misfit watch accurately recorded all advertised data
points to include steps taken, calories burned, sleep cycles,
and maintained accurate time. The patient’s father provided

3. Discussion
The accidental ingestion of a foreign object is far more
common in pediatric, elderly, psychiatric, and incarcerated
patients when compared to the adolescent or healthy adult
population. Once in the stomach, 80% of these objects
will eventually pass out of the body; therefore, intervention
remains uncommon as long as the patient is asymptomatic
[13]. The decision to proceed with endoscopic retrieval, in this
case, was prompted by a failure in the progression of the watch
for greater than 24 hours. In addition, there was an uncer-
tainty to the maintenance of the watch’s structural integrity
when exposed to a low pH for an extended period of time.
The device is advertised as being waterproof to 50 meters;
however, this did not allay the surgeon or patients’ concern
for battery exposure and the risk of a caustic perforation
[12]. Several studies have shown that sharp foreign bodies,
severe symptoms, long duration from ingestion to endoscopy,
and existence of mucosal injury are significant risk factors
predictive of complications related to removal of foreign
bodies [14, 15]. We believe that early detection and a timely
endoscopic removal were two factors that contributed to
successful retrieval for this case.
As this retrieval occurred at a small community hospital, a
limited variety of endoscopic tools were available. While there
are no published guidelines for which endoscopic snare or
grasper to utilize during foreign body recovery, the American
Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides
recommendations regarding the dimensions, configurations,
and indications for many commercially available devices [16].
In addition, the ASGE has published intervention timing
guidelines based on patient symptoms, object type and size,
and anatomic location. Although a magnetized digital watch
is not included in these published categories, disk batteries
and coins larger than 2 cm are recommended to be extracted
1-2 days following ingestion [17].
In conclusion, the retrieval of a magnetized watch from
the stomach with a flexible endoscope is a safe and efficacious
procedure. It is critical that the physician must consider
patient size, as well as the device size and design, to formulate
an appropriate management plan. The patient should under-
stand the endoscopic and operative risks and should be coun-
seled on the need for a timely intervention when observation
has failed.
