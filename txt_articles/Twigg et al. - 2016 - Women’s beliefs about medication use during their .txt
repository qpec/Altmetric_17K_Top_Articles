Abstract Background Previous research has examined the
number and extent of medicines taking in pregnant women
but not their beliefs and risk perception surrounding their
use. Objective To describe beliefs and risk perception
associated with medicines use for the treatment of common
acute conditions among UK women and explore whether
this is related to actual medicines use. Settings Cross-sec-
tional, web-based study in the UK. Methods Pregnant
women and mothers within 1 year of giving birth were
invited to participate in an online cross-sectional ques-
tionnaire-based study via a pregnancy website in the UK.
Anonymous data were collected from women regarding
their use of medicines (both over-the-counter and pre-
scribed) and their beliefs regarding medicines use during
pregnancy. Main outcome measures Pregnant women’s
beliefs about medicines and their relation to pharmaco-
logical treatment of acute conditions in pregnancy. Results
Pharmacological treatment of conditions in pregnancy
ranged from 65.4 % for urinary tract infections (UTIs) to
1.1 % for sleeping problems. Almost three out of ten
women avoided using some medications during pregnancy.
For heartburn and UTIs, women who did not treat the
condition viewed medicines in general as being overused,
more harmful and less beneficial, than those who treated the
condition. In general, UK pregnant women perceived
medicines to be beneficial and slightly overused. Conclu-
sions Women’s beliefs about medications impact on treat-
ment of specific conditions in pregnancy such as heartburn
and UTIs. Healthcare professionals should explore patient’s
beliefs regarding medication at the first maternity care visit
to promote appropriate medication use in pregnancy.

Impact on practice
•
Even though the level of treatment varies across various
acute pregnancy-related illnesses, many women do not
treat them pharmacologically and avoid using medica-
tion during pregnancy.
•
Women’s risk perception and beliefs about medications
seem to be important drivers in the decision-making
whether to treat a specific condition during pregnancy
with medicines, especially heartburn and UTIs.
•
Healthcare
professionals
should
explore
patient’s
beliefs regarding medication at the first maternity care
visit to promote appropriate medication use in preg-
nancy and hence ensure maternal–fetal health.
Introduction
Clear guidelines exist for maternity care in the UK [1],

ing pregnancy on the National Health Service (NHS)

 website is to ‘‘use as few over-the-counter medicines as
possible’’ [2]. The guidance relating to the use of medici-
nes, issued by the National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) is vague, suggesting simply that, if
necessary, antacids should be used for heartburn and diet
and lifestyle changes should be attempted for constipation
[1]. Moreover, the package insert leaflets often provide
general statements that use in pregnancy should only occur
if the benefits outweigh the risks [3]. For both health care
professionals and pregnant women themselves, lack of
clear recommendations make decisions concerning medi-
cation use during pregnancy difficult.
There have been numerous studies investigating the preva-
lence of medicine use during pregnancy [4–7]. Few studies,
however, distinguishing between over-the-counter (OTC) and
prescription medicines and report how different conditions in
pregnancy are being treated. Currently, the majority of UK
research focuses on the use of electronic database to charac-
terise utilisation patterns or to study medication safety in
pregnancy in a way that does not explore perceptions of preg-
nant women regarding taking medication [8–10].
Analysis of international data indicates that women over-
estimate the risk of taking OTC and prescribed medicines
during pregnancy [11]. The authors suggest this may have an
impact on whether a woman wants to treat a particular con-
dition during pregnancy. There is a lack of knowledge about
the relationship between the woman’s risk perception and her
actual medicines use during pregnancy in the UK.
Aim of the study
The aim of this paper was to describe women’s’ beliefs and
risk perception associated with medicines use for certain
conditions and whether this relates to actual medication
taking. A secondary aim was to describe the extent of
medication use according to specific common acute con-
ditions in pregnancy in a UK population and the sources
used to obtain information about use during pregnancy.
Ethical approval
In the UK, ethical approval for the study was received from
the University of East Anglia’s Faculty of Medicine and
Health Research Ethics Committee dated November 2011
(reference: 2011/2012-02).
Method
This study is a sub-study of the Multinational Medication
Use in Pregnancy Study which has been described in detail
elsewhere [12]. Study respondents were recruited via
advertisements on national websites commonly used by
pregnant women or new mothers in the UK: www.bounty.
com (a national charity involved in distributing support
information to pregnant women) and Pregnancy Forum
www.pregnancyforum.co.uk (a national website for preg-
nant women) during the period 15th November 2011 to
15th January 2012. The websites were selected on the basis
of the number of daily users and subscribers. Women who
were interested in participating were directed to the study
questionnaire platform by clicking on the study URL in the
advertisement. Before the woman could access the on-line
questionnaire, she was asked to read the study description.
Thereafter, the question ‘‘Are you willing to participate in
the study?’’ was posed. Informed consent was given by
ticking the answer ‘‘yes’’. The researchers had no access to
these e-mail addresses or personally identifiable data either
from the website company or the returned questionnaires.
The website company had no knowledge of those women
who had completed the questionnaire. Only women who
were either pregnant or within 1 year of giving birth were
eligible. If they did not meet these criteria they were
thanked for their interest and exited from the study.
General information regarding the respondents demo-
graphics and activities undertaken during pregnancy e.g.
smoking and drinking alcohol were obtained. Health lit-
eracy was measured by the Set of Brief Screening Ques-
tions (SBSQ) [13] and its use in this study is described in
more detail in a previous publication [14]. The SBSQ scale
was used as an ordinal variable in the analysis. The SBSQ
sum score was dichotomized into low/medium (score 0–9)
and high health literacy (score 10–12) due to numbers
available for analysis.
Respondents were asked to detail which common con-
ditions they had experienced during pregnancy from a list
of common ailments experienced in pregnancy, namely:
nausea, heartburn, constipation, common cold, urinary tract
infections, pain in the neck or pelvic girdle, headache and
sleeping problems. The questions were indication-for-use
orientated. The medicines used to treat these common
conditions were collected and coded using the World
Health Organisation’s ATC indexing system [15]. With the
exception of certain common medicines e.g. paracetamol,
coding was performed to the fourth level i.e. therapeutic
group. Respondents were also asked separately to detail
specific uses of OTC medicines and prescription medica-
tions during pregnancy and were aided with an OTC
example to aid recall.
General beliefs about medicines were obtained using the
validated Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-General
(BMQ-General) [16] with an additional four questions added
to reflect the benefits of medicines as described by Horne
et al. [17]. Respondents were therefore posed four statements
relating to the general overuse of medicines, four relating to
the harm associated with taking medicines and four relating
Int J Clin Pharm (2016) 38:968–976
969
123
 to the benefits of medicines. Each item was scored using a
1–5 scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly
agree. Responses to each group of four statements were
group together to give a score ranging from 4 to 20. Higher
scores indicate a higher level of agreement with the con-
structs represented by each of the sub-scales.
The extent to which respondents would avoid certain
medicines was ascertained by asking them to detail if they had
deliberately avoided any medicines during their pregnancy
and, if so, which ones. The avoided medications were coded
using the World Health Organisation’s ATC indexing system
[15]. Risk perception was determined by asking respondents
to rate their perception of risk of certain common medicines,
foods and other substances on the foetus. Respondents were
asked to tick a box if they perceived the substances to be not
harmful (score = 0) to very harmful (score = 10). A full list
can be found in a previous publication [18]. We analysed only
the three medication groups that were specifically ask about
both regarding use and risk perception; OTC anti-nauseants,
paracetamol and antibiotics.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the prevalence
of medication use during pregnancy and presented as per-
centages with 95 % CI. Chi-square tests and Fishers exact
tests
were
performed
to
investigate
the
relationship
between socio-demographic characteristics and medication
use. Where data were normally distributed, means and
standard deviations were used along with independent
samples t tests for comparisons. This was applied when
assessing the association between Beliefs about medication
(BMQ) and medication use. Where data were not normally
distributed or formed from an ordinal scale, medians and
interquartiles (IQ) were used along with Mann–Whitney
U tests for comparisons. This was applied when assessing
the association between risk perception and medication
use. The significance level was set at p \ 0.05. The Sta-
tistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v21 (IBM
SPSS Statistics) was used for the analysis.
In order to assess the sample for generalisability, a
comparison was made between the respondent demo-
graphics and data available for the national population at
the time of the study [19–22].
Results
Study population
The UK study sample consisted of 1120 women. The
majority (87.8 %) of these were from England with the
remaining from Scotland (6.2 %), Wales (4.1 %) and
Northern Ireland (1.7 %). Four-hundred and forty-two
(39.5 %) were pregnant at the time of completing the
questionnaire with the remaining having given birth in
the previous year. In those respondents who were not
currently pregnant, 34.4 % had a child over 29 weeks old
with 46.1 % between 9 and 28 weeks. Of those who
smoked before, 205 (72.7 %) gave up once pregnant, 67
(23.8 %) reduced and 10 (3.6 %) either smoked the same
or increased. Of the 1120 respondents 193 (17.2 %)
reported having a chronic condition of whom 74 (6.6 %)
had asthma, 48 (4.3 %) had allergies, 28 (2.5 %) had
hypothyroidism, 54 (4.8 %) had depression, 36 (3.2 %)
suffered
from
anxiety
and
76
(6.8 %)
had
another
chronic condition. Table 1 shows the demographics of
the sample compared to national data for all birthing
mothers in the UK at the time of the questionnaire.
Women who responded were more likely to be married,
have no previous children, drink alcohol and be a non-
smokers during pregnancy than the general birthing
population in the UK.
Medication use and treatment of common conditions
in pregnancy
In total, 856 women (76.4 %) reported the use of medi-
cation (both OTC and prescribed) to treat at least one of
the eight common conditions experienced during preg-
nancy.
The
most
commonly
used medications
were
paracetamol, alginic acid-type drugs e.g. Gaviscon and
osmotic laxatives e.g. lactulose. Table 2 illustrates the
frequency and treatments used in several common con-
ditions experienced during pregnancy. Although a sig-
nificant
number
of
respondents
experienced
these
conditions during pregnancy, relatively few of them took
medication for nausea (9.5 %), constipation (19.2 %) or
sleeping problems (1.1 %). In total, 730 (65.2 %) women
reported taking over-the-counter analgesics, used for a
variety of conditions including headache, neck pain and
pelvic girdle pain. One of the most important aspects of
Table 2 concerns the number of women experiencing a
UTI [n = 191 (17.1 %)] and not receiving treatment
[n = 66 (65.4 %)].
A comparison of demographics shows that a greater
number of women with higher health literacy, aged under
30 years, married, non-smoking and drinking alcohol dur-
ing pregnancy treated heartburn with medication when
compared to those who did not. Alcohol use was also
higher in the group that used medication to treat consti-
pation compared to those who did not. Comparisons for the
other conditions and variables listed in the method were not
significantly different (E-Table 1).

 Medication avoidance
In
total,
815
(72.8 %)
women
reported
deliberately
avoiding the use of certain medicines during pregnancy.
These were primarily the avoidance of paracetamol [149
(18.3 %)],
ibuprofen
and
combination
products
[144
(14.7 %)], cough and cold preparations [53 (6.5 %)],
antihistamines [36 (4.4 %)] and nasal decongestants [24
(2.9 %)]. The most common reasons for avoiding OTC
medicines were: a fear of harming the unborn child [218
women (19.5 %)], medication not recommended [215
(19.2 %)] and stating they would not take any medication
during pregnancy/endure as much as possible before taking
medication [70 (6.3 %)].
Beliefs about medicines, risk perception
and information needs
Table 3 shows the responses for each of the BMQ-General
questions. For the total study population the mean (SD) for
the overuse (score of 20 indicates overused), harm (score of
20 indicates harmful) and benefit (score of 20 indicates
beneficial) sections were 12.02 (2.69), 9.62 (2.62) and
15.98 (2.23) respectively. Table 4 illustrates the associa-
tion between beliefs about medicines and medicines used
for common conditions. There was a significant difference
between women with heartburn and urinary tract infections
(UTIs) who took medication and those who did not, in
terms of their perception of overuse, harm and benefits
associated with medicine taking. Table 4 also compares the
risk perception of OTC nausea medication, paracetamol
and antibiotics between respondents who took OTC med-
ication for nausea, pain relief and medication for a UTI
respectively. In all three groups, women who did not take
medication perceived the risk to be greater than those who
chose to take medication.
Finally, in terms of obtaining information, 518 (46.3 %)
respondents
stated
they
required
more
information
regarding medicines use during their pregnancy. In total,
365 (70.5 %) approached the midwife or nurse for this
information with 256 (49.4 %) approaching the physician,
230 (44.4 %) pharmacy personnel and 257 (49.6 %) the
internet.
Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first study specifically
exploring the relationship between beliefs and medications
use according to specific acute conditions in pregnancy in a
UK population with several of our findings important for
clinical practice. Firstly we show that a significant number
of women are treating common conditions experienced
during pregnancy with medication that is either prescribed
or purchased over-the-counter. The most concerning fig-
ure in this data are the number of women reporting having
a UTI and not receiving treatment. Secondly we show that
medication use is associated with different socio-demo-
graphic factors, particularly in cases of heartburn and
constipation. Thirdly, we illustrate the common medicines
that are avoided during pregnancy and womens’ reasons for
doing so. We go on to show that medicines in general are

 perceived to be beneficial and slightly overused and that
beliefs and risk perception may play an important role in
medication use among women with heartburn and UTIs.
Finally, pregnant women used a variety of sources when
searching for information about medicines, with 50 %
choosing to use internet sources.
The disparity in beliefs about medicines and risk per-
ception in respondents indicates a potential lack of
awareness of the appropriateness of medicines, particularly
in women experiencing heartburn and UTIs and not treat-
ing the condition. It is clear that further work should be
undertaken to explore these risk perceptions of medicines
to understand why women feel these medicines are not
safe. This data shows that women viewed medicines as
beneficial in general, with fewer suggesting that medicines
are overused and harmful when compared to other studies
in pregnant women [23].
In those respondents who did not take medicines to treat
the UTI, the risk perception aligned well with that from the
analysis of the overall international study [11], whereas
women treating the condition were significantly below this
international average. It may indicate that women need
more information regarding the safety of medicines during
pregnancy and what is appropriate for them to use, in order
to encourage them to treat conditions effectively. Under-
standing women’s concerns is also essential to promote
adherence to prescribed therapy during pregnancy.
The lack of medicines use in women experiencing
nausea and constipation is perhaps explained by the rela-
tive ease with which these symptoms can be alleviated
using diet and lifestyle measures [1, 2]. As this survey did
not collect data on severity of conditions or non-medicinal
treatments, we cannot evaluate the appropriateness of
therapy. However, in those with a UTI, the number not

a Respondents were asked to detail the medicines used to treat these common conditions in two sections—the first related to all medicines and
could be interpreted as prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) and the second section specifically asked for OTC medicines. Therefore, there is
likely to be some overlap between the two figures

 receiving treatment is concerning and potentially links to
the respondent’s perception of risk. If left untreated, UTIs
can cause significant complications and as such established
guidelines exist for the treatment of this acute condition in
pregnant women [24].
It is clear from this survey that women have different
views regarding their beliefs about medicines and their risk
perception of certain medicines for common conditions.
This may be having an impact on their willingness to take
medicines for these conditions which could lead to a
worsening of symptoms or, in the case of untreated UTIs,
harm on the fetus. This is particularly visible with the OTC
analgesic paracetamol, the use of which during pregnancy
is deemed suitable [25]. Yet a large number of women
perceived this as a risky medication and would avoid it
during their pregnancy. More work needs to be done to
explore these concerns with pregnant women at the outset
in order to structure a patient-centred consultation around
their beliefs and concerns regarding medicines.
Interestingly, the pharmacy is being used as a source of
information for medicines equivalent to the number seek-
ing advice from physicians. Currently, pharmacists are not
included in the routine care of pregnant women; however,
this data shows that they are being used as a source of
advice. In previous commentary, it has been stated that
pharmacists do not engage in providing information to
pregnant women, instead preferring to refer to an appro-
priate physician, resulting in further delay and appoint-
ments for the woman [26]. Therefore, pharmacists should
be made aware of these findings and receive adequate
professional training in evidence-based treatments in order
that they can structure their consultations around the
medicines-related beliefs of the patient. There is also, no
current guidance readily available for pharmacists and
therefore this should be the focus of work in the future to
ensure women receive the appropriate treatment at the right
time and if necessary are referred to secondary care ser-
vices. As discussed in the introduction current guidance is
vague, with Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs)
and national formularies often reliant on manufacturer’s
warnings rather than evidence behind their use in practice.
In the UK, the Teratology Information Service provides
guidance on the use of medicines in pregnancy [27] how-
ever it is not clear to what extent this is accessed by
healthcare professionals.
Strengths and limitations
This was a large cross-sectional, web-based study con-
ducted in the UK. The most important strength is that we
were able to include the women’s perspectives in relation
to their medication use in pregnancy. This permits com-
parison between attitudes and actual medication use during
pregnancy. Moreover, the use of an anonymous on-line
questionnaire may promote a more truthful answer to
sensitive questions [28] and enabled us to reach a large
proportion of the birthing population in the UK. Internet

 penetration rates in the UK are relatively high (85 % with
access to internet in their homes and 70 % using the
internet every day or almost every day) [29] making this
method more applicable compared to countries with lower
daily access to the internet. Also, several validated instru-
ments were used including the BMQ and the SBSQ
enabling comparison with other prior studies.
However, there are also several limitations that should
be acknowledged. Firstly, by using a web-based data col-
lection system we could not calculate a conventional
response rate, and the possibility of a self-selection bias
cannot be excluded. In order to reduce this risk and reach
the widest possible segment of the target population, the
invitation to participate in the study was sent to all women
subscribed to one website and posted on a pregnancy
forum, which were both selected according to the number
of daily users/subscribers. Use of pregnancy forums was
endorsed given their widespread use among the pregnant
population, even of more socially disadvantaged status
[30–32]. Recent epidemiological studies indicate reason-
able validity of web-based recruitment methods [28, 33].
Hence,
the
degree
to
which
our
findings
can
be
extrapolated to the target population is based on the rep-
resentativeness of the respondents to the general birthing
populations in each country. In most questionnaire-based
studies,
the
study
participants
are
somewhat
more
resourceful than the general birthing populations. This
might also be the case in our study where 7 % of the
respondents reported smoking during pregnancy versus
13 % in the general UK birthing population (Table 1). Our
findings may therefore be an underestimation of the true
occurrence of medication use during pregnancy. Another
limitation of this survey is the self-report nature of the
responses. The recall of respondents who were towards the
latter end of one year post birth may have been a problem
in this survey and despite currently being pregnant those
women who had not yet given birth would not have been
able to provide a full account of their pregnancy. As pre-
viously tested for the entire Multinational Medication Use
in Pregnancy Study dataset [12], the extent of OTC (8 %
difference) and medication use for acute/short-term ill-
nesses (4 % difference) reported by pregnant women was
lower than that reported by new mothers. The survey also
only asked about medicines-related treatments and did not

 explore diet and lifestyle modifications that women
undertook to treat these common conditions. This would
have been useful as most of these common conditions, in
the early stages, can be treated with the appropriate chan-
ges to diet and lifestyle. Our results should be interpreted
with these limitations in mind.
Conclusion
Beliefs and risk perception play an important role on
medication taking patterns in pregnancy. Pregnant women
should be encouraged to discuss their concerns about
medicines taking with healthcare professionals in order to
ensure they receive timely and effective treatment. How-
ever, more work needs to be done to determine if health-
care professionals have the tools available to them to allay
concerns,
assess
severity
of
conditions
and
provide
appropriate treatment advice for pregnant women.
