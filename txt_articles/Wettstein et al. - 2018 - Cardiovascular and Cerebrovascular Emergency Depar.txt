Background-—Wildfire smoke is known to exacerbate respiratory conditions; however, evidence for cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular events has been inconsistent, despite biological plausibility.
Methods and Results-—A population-based epidemiologic analysis was conducted for daily cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
emergency department (ED) visits and wildfire smoke exposure in 2015 among adults in 8 California air basins. A quasi-Poisson
regression model was used for zip code-level counts of ED visits, adjusting for heat index, day of week, seasonality, and population.
Satellite-imaged smoke plumes were classified as light, medium, or dense based on model-estimated concentrations of fine
particulate matter. Relative risk was determined for smoky days for lag days 0 to 4. Rates of ED visits by age- and sex-stratified
groups were also examined. Rates of all-cause cardiovascular ED visits were elevated across all lags, with the greatest increase on
dense smoke days and among those aged ≥65 years at lag 0 (relative risk 1.15, 95% confidence interval [1.09, 1.22]). All-cause
cerebrovascular visits were associated with smoke, especially among those 65 years and older, (1.22 [1.00, 1.49], dense smoke,
lag 1). Respiratory conditions were also increased, as anticipated (1.18 [1.08, 1.28], adults >65 years, dense smoke, lag 1). No
association was found for the control condition, acute appendicitis. Elevated risks for individual diagnoses included myocardial
infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, dysrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack.
Conclusions-—Analysis of an extensive wildfire season found smoke exposure to be associated with cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular ED visits for all adults, particularly for those over aged 65 years. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e007492. DOI: 10.

ildfire season in North America has increased in
intensity and duration, resulting in a greater popula-
tion at high risk of wildfire smoke exposure.1–3 Exposure to
wildfire smoke is already contributing to substantial clinical,
public health, and economic societal burdens, and yet, large-
scale wildfire events are projected to increase through the
end of the century in many regions, including in California.2,4,5
Wildfire smoke contains numerous air pollutants, including
particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, polycyclic aro-
matic compounds, and nitrogen dioxide, all of which have
previously been associated with respiratory and cardiovascu-
lar outcomes in health studies of air pollution.6–10 Fine
particulate matter (<2.5 lm in diameter [PM2.5]) is a known
respiratory irritant and causally related to cardiovascular
morbidity.11–13 PM2.5 passes deep into the lung and has been
shown to increase systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
and coagulation through PM2.5-mediated changes in the
autonomic nervous system.11,14 This has been linked to
cardiovascular health impacts such as ischemic heart disease
and cerebrovascular events such as ischemic stroke in the
ambient air pollutant PM2.5 literature.11,15–18 Other air
pollutants in wildfire smoke have also been linked to
cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes in urban and ambi-
ent air pollution studies, including nitrogen oxides, carbon
monoxide, and ozone.7–10

 Among the pollutants during wildfire smoke episodes, fine
particulate matter is the primary pollutant of concern to
human health because of its abundance.19 It is therefore
surprising that the literature is less consistent about the
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects associated with
wildfire smoke exposure.11–13 In contrast to respiratory
impacts, fewer studies have examined cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular outcomes and fewer yet reported positive
associations with respect to exposure to wildfire smoke,
potentially as a result of underpowered studies or limited
population exposed, as these studies generally were con-
ducted during solitary wildfire events.11,12,20
This study investigates a particularly widespread wildfire
season in 2015 in California, during which a series of fire
complexes encompassing over 800 000 acres burned in
northern and central parts of the state. We examined the
relative
risk
of
combined
and
specific
cardiovascular-,
cerebrovascular-, and respiratory-related emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits on light, medium, and dense plumes relative
to days without wildfire smoke exposure. Data were used
from the entirety of this intense fire season across a vast
region of California to elucidate the cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular health impacts previously inconclusive in the
literature.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure. The analytic
methods and the statistical program code can be made
available but access to the data requires institutional review
board approval from the Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects (CPHS) under the California Health and
Human Services Agency.
Study Setting
All ED visits between May 1 and September 30 were
included within 8 of the 15 California air basins in the
northern and central regions of the state that were most
exposed to smoke during the 2015 wildfire season: Great
Basin Valleys, Lake County, Lake Tahoe, Mountain Counties,
North Coast, Northeast Plateau, Sacramento Valley, and San
Joaquin Valley. The largest and longest fires during this study
occurred in the North Coast, Lake County, Sacramento
Valley, and San Joaquin Valley air basins but smoke plumes
were present in all 8 air basins during the study period.
During this period, precipitation was low and present mainly
at higher elevations.
Exposure Data
Exposure data were from the publicly available National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hazard
Mapping System (HMS) Fire and Smoke product. The HMS
provides geospatial boundaries of smoke plumes as seen by
visible band satellite imagery. The HMS incorporates data
from 7 NOAA and National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration environmental satellites, recording multiple plumes
throughout each day. Each smoke plume in HMS is accom-
panied by estimated concentrations of PM2.5 attributed to
wildfire smoke, generated using atmospheric models, and
grouped into light (PM2.5 range 0–10 lg/m3), medium (10.5–
21.5 lg/m3), and dense smoke categories (range 22+ lg/
m3).21,22 Daily maximum density of smoke at each zip code
was used to characterize exposure. All HMS smoke plume
densities are published daily as shapefiles on the NOAA
website and are used to communicate smoke plume locations
to researchers and the public.
Healthcare Utilization Data
Daily counts of ED visits for each zip code in the study area
and period came from the California Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). The OSHPD
Emergency Department Dataset (EDD) and Patient Discharge
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Wildfire smoke exposure was associated with increased
rates of emergency department visits for numerous cardio-
vascular disease outcomes, including ischemic heart dis-
ease, dysrhythmia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and
stroke.
• The
observed
risk
was
greatest
among
adults
aged>65 years.
• This analysis used data from nearly the entire wildfire
season across a large area of California, which is one of the
most extensive studies of wildfire health impacts in
California to date.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease risk
factors may be at risk for an acute cardiovascular or
cerebrovascular event during a period of wildfire smoke
exposure.
• Further studies should explore individual-level behavioral
interventions that may help reduce exposure to smoke
during wildfires.
• Hospital administrators and public health planners may
want to use these results to inform surge planning of
emergency departments, particularly among stroke centers
and hospitals with cardiac catheterization facilities.

 Dataset (PDD) contain records of over 14 million annual ED
visits from hospitals across California. Diagnoses were
included for all adults aged ≥19 years. International Classifi-
cation of Disease, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) codes were used for
diagnoses of interest, using all 25 discharge diagnosis code
positions in the OSHPD data set.13,23–26 Cardiovascular end
points were hypertension (ICD-9 codes 401–405), myocardial
infarction (410), ischemic heart disease (410–411, 413),
pulmonary embolism (415), dysrhythmia and conduction
disorder (426–427), heart failure (428), peripheral arterial
disease (444), and all-cause cardiovascular (401–405, 410–
411, 413, 415, 426–428, 444). Cerebrovascular end points
included
non-traumatic
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
(430),
intracerebral hemorrhage (431), non-traumatic intracranial
hemorrhage (432), precerebral vascular occlusion (433),
ischemic stroke (434), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (435),
lateral medullary syndrome (436), and all-cause cerebrovas-
cular events (430–436). Ischemic stroke and TIA were
analyzed individually, while the other outcomes were included
only in the all-cause cerebrovascular category given their
rarity. Respiratory end points were included for external
validity: asthma (493), COPD (491–492, 496), pneumonia
(480–486), other non-cardiac chest pain or respiratory
syndrome (786), and all-cause respiratory (480–486, 491–
493, 496, 786). Control end points were acute appendicitis
(540–542) and long-bone fracture (812–813, 820–821, 823)
given their independent pathophysiology from PM2.5-related
inflammation and coagulation, as has been done elsewhere.26
The category of all visits was used to approximate overall ED
volume, which included discrete ED visits for any diagnosis
code.
Covariate Data
US Census American Communities Survey 2015 population
estimates were used for zip code population estimates. Daily
mean temperature and relative humidity were obtained for 50
California airports from Weather Underground Data and
History Archive. The daily heat index, a combined metric of
temperature and relative humidity, was calculated for each zip
code based on the mean temperature and relative humidity
for the nearest airport to the zip code centroid.27
Statistical Analysis
A population-based epidemiological analysis was conducted
to examine zip code-level associations between daily maxi-
mum smoke density (low, medium, and dense) and ED visits
using a quasi-Poisson regression model. A quasi-Poisson
regression analysis was used to allow for under- and over-
dispersion of the data. Each health outcome was analyzed
separately and associations were examined for exposure
lagged between 0 and 4 days, with each lag analyzed
independently. Estimated relative risk (RR) of each health
outcome is reported for all adults, as well as for sex- and age-
stratified adults. Relative risk is expressed as rate of outcome-
specific ED visits on smoke days relative to the days with no
smoke. The statistical model included indicator variables of
smoke plume density (light, medium, dense), day of week, and
smoothing splines for heat index (3 degrees of freedom) and
for temporal trend (3 degrees of freedom), as done else-
where25,26 Logged zip code-population size was used as an
offset to adjust for differences in baseline rate of visits by
location. The sensitivity of the results was examined for
different degrees of freedom for the smoothing splines of the
covariates, and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) was used
to choose the best fitting model.28 No adjustment was made
for multiplicity of comparisons.
Statistical analyses were conducted using the R Project for
Statistical Computing Version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and emergency department
data cleaning and management was conducted with SAS�
software, Version 9.4, of the SAS System for Windows (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Ethics
The study was approved by the Committee for the Protection
of Human Subjects (CPHS) under the California Health and
Human Services Agency and the subject informed consent
requirement was waived.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
This analysis included 1 196 233 emergency department
outcomes that occurred in the study region and time-period:
361 087
cardiovascular,
15 505
cerebrovascular,
and
230 029 respiratory diagnoses, in addition to 2520 acute
appendicitis and 13 473 long-bone fracture diagnoses for the
controls. Age- and sex-stratified counts of ED visits delineated
by diagnosis categories are shown in Table 1.
Medium- and dense-smoke days were most frequent in
August, followed by September (Table 2). Three air basins
shared the largest burden of smoke days, including the North
Coast, Sacramento Valley, and San Joaquin Valley air basins
(Figure 1). These were also the air basins with the largest
population centers in the study region.

were
more
pronounced
among
adults
aged
≥65 years
(Tables 4 and 5). Risk increased for all-cause and individual
cardiovascular diagnoses across multiple lags (Figure 3). The
greatest change in risk was observed for myocardial infarction
(RR [95% confidence interval (CI)]) (1.42 [1.09, 1.84]) and
ischemic heart disease (1.22 [1.01, 1.47]) with dense smoke
at lag 1, among adults aged ≥65 years. Risk of dysrhythmia
was greatest among adults aged ≥65 years on days with
dense smoke exposure but was elevated across most lags and
smoke densities for all adults and those over aged >65 years.
Heart failure was associated most strongly with dense smoke
at lag 3 among adults aged ≥65 years (1.22 [1.10, 1.35]) and
elevated across all lags. Risk of heart failure was not
increased in other age groups (Tables 3 and 4). Associations
with all levels of smoke density were observed with hyper-
tension in adults aged ≥65 years, at lags 0 through 4.
Increased risk of pulmonary embolism was observed only at
lags 2 and 3 with medium and dense smoke, among adults
aged ≥65 years (1.71 [1.12, 2.62]).

 Cerebrovascular Outcomes
Risk of all-cause cerebrovascular ED visits on smoky days was
most pronounced among adults aged ≥65 years and persisted
at lag days 0 through 4 (Tables 3 through 5, Figure 2).
Increased risk was observed with all 3 levels of smoke
density, although not consistently statistically significant,
possibly because of the fewer number of cerebrovascular
events. Among adults aged >65 years, the highest relative risk
was observed at dense smoke levels on lag day 0 (1.22 [1.00,
1.48]) and lag day 1 (1.22 [1.00, 1.49]). However, elevated
risks were also seen for all adults and light smoke (1.09 [1.03,
1.15]) and medium smoke at lag days 1 and 3 (1.17 [1.06,
1.28], 1.14 [1.04, 1.26)]) (Table 3). In contrast, ischemic
stroke diagnoses were increased only at longer lags and
driven by the ≥65 age group. Among adults aged ≥65,
ischemic stroke was statistically significant at lag 3 for light
(1.16 [1.04, 1.29]) and medium smoke (1.25 [1.04, 1.50]),
and was also increased for all adults at lag 3 days (1.16 [1.00,
1.34]) and adults 19 to 44 years at lag 4 (1.90 [1.26, 2.85])
(Table S1). Associations with transient ischemic attack were

 significant only among adults 45 to 64 and medium smoke
at lag day 3 (1.39 [1.01, 1.92]) and consistently increased
but with wider CIs for older populations at multiple lags
(Tables 4 and 5).
Respiratory and Control Outcomes
All-cause respiratory outcomes were increased with medium
and dense smoke exposure (Table 3), but most pronounced in
adults aged ≥65 years (Figure 2). The risk of asthma related
ED visits among younger adults on medium and dense smoke
plume days was the highest but was elevated in other age
groups as well (Table S1). Risk for COPD and pneumonia were
increased across multiple lags and highest on dense smoke
days for adults aged ≥65 years (Table S1). Statistically
significant differences were not found among sex-stratified
results for these respiratory diagnoses (Table S2).
No association was found between wildfire smoke density
and
acute
appendicitis
diagnoses. Long-bone
fractures,
however, were observed to have a significant association
with PM2.5 among all adults at lags 0 through 2 and dense
smoke (1.31 [1.09, 1.56]), primarily adults 65 years and older
(1.47 [1.12, 1.92]). When stratified by sex, the association
was significant among women (1.37 [1.09, 1.70]) but not
among men (1.22 [0.90, 1.65]) (Table S2).
Sensitivity Analysis
Additional sensitivity analysis was conducted by assessing zip
code-specific associations between wildfire smoke density
and health outcomes and summarizing results using random-
effects meta-analysis to account for possible geographic
heterogeneity of outcomes (Table S3). Sparsely populated zip
codes had too low a count of diagnoses to perform the
analysis so a population cutoff of 13 250 per zip code was
used. The results are generally consistent with those
presented here, with smaller standard errors, since the data
were subset to larger zip code populations. Additional
sensitivity analysis was conducting using the zip code-specific
proportion of the population below the poverty level and the
results were also consistent with those of the original
analysis.
Additional age- and sex-stratified results, and those of rarer
outcomes, can be found in Tables S1 and S2.
Discussion
In this investigation, a positive association was found between
wildfire smoke density and ED visits attributable to cardio-
vascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease in northern
and central California in the summer of 2015. The impacts

 were greatest on medium and dense smoke days and among
adults aged ≥65 years, although also observed among
younger age groups for some clinical conditions. In addition
to the all-cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular cate-
gories, relative risk was elevated for specific outcomes
including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease,
dysrhythmia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, ischemic
stroke, and transient ischemic attack. All-cause respiratory
outcomes were statistically significant as well and surpris-
ingly, so were long-bone fractures. No association was found
with the control condition of acute appendicitis.
The evidence for particulate matter-mediated mechanisms
for cardiovascular disease has been discussed elsewhere.18
Recent reviews on the topic have identified 3 main patho-
physiologic mechanisms: modulation of autonomic balance
and neural input to the heart, release of pro-inflammatory
mediators by lung tissue with attendant systemic effects, and
penetration
of
particulate
matter
into
the
systemic
circulation.18,29–34 These 3 pathways can lead to an increase
in systemic oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and
other inflammatory responses, in addition to platelet activa-
tion, hypercoagulability, and vasoconstriction.18,29,30 Acute
PM2.5 exposure and the resulting autonomic stimulation, pro-
coagulability, and inflammation all favor the underlying
pathophysiology of the cardiovascular disease outcomes
observed in this investigation, including cardiac dysrhythmia,
ischemic heart disease, heart failure exacerbation, pulmonary
embolism, and cerebrovascular events.
These pathophysiologic mechanisms are consistent with
the apparent triggering of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular

 clinical events based on the temporal relationships observed
between short-term exposures to wildfire smoke and the
clinical
outcomes.35
Dysrhythmia,
likely
precipitated by
immediate changes in the balance of the autonomic nervous
system, first appeared at lag 0.36 Myocardial infarction and
ischemic heart disease appeared second at lag 1. Epidemi-
ologic studies indicate that ambient particulate matter
exposure is more strongly associated with ST-elevation
myocardial infarction than non-ST-elevation myocardial infarc-
tion, suggesting that the mechanism is dependent upon
erosion of a rupture-prone plaque and changes in the balance
of pro-thrombotic and anti-thrombotic processes promoting
more extensive thrombosis.37 ED visits for heart failure
appeared first at lag 0 and increased with time, with the
highest RR at lag 3. In contrast to the mechanisms accounting
for the triggering of myocardial infarction, hospitalizations for
heart failure are most likely secondary to exacerbations of
pre-existing heart failure worsened by PM-induced increases
in systemic blood pressure, and systemic and pulmonary
vasoconstriction.38–41 All these outcomes were most strongly
associated with the aged. Cerebrovascular responses primar-
ily manifested among older people and appeared within the
first day and continued through lag 4, consistent with
endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction, as well as
thromboembolic phenomena.
Studies of wildfire-related cardiovascular outcomes have
reported inconsistent findings. One recent review found that
most studies with combined cardiovascular outcomes have
found no significant associations, although some specific
outcomes have been shown to be increased in the context of
wildfire smoke, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, heart
failure, and ischemic heart disease.11 Another review found
that 6 of 14 studies revealed statistically significant associ-
ations of wildfires and cardiovascular outcomes.12 Since the
publication of that review, however, at least 4 subsequent
investigations have identified elevated risk of cardiovascular
events associated with wildfire smoke exposure, which may
reflect recent use of more sophisticated methods or utilization
of more specific outcomes.15,20,26,42
With respect to specific cardiovascular diagnoses, previous
research has shown mixed results on ischemic heart disease.
No association was found with wildfire smoke and ischemic
heart disease hospitalizations in California, while another
study found an increase in clinic-based ischemic heart disease
visits among Native Americans of the Hoopa tribe of northern
California.43,44 An Australian study mentioned earlier found
increased rates of hospital admissions and ED visits for
ischemic heart disease among women and adults aged >65
years at lag day 2.15
Similarly, heart failure was found to be associated with
wildfire smoke in this study. Elsewhere, heart failure-related ED
visits were elevated in the context of peat bog fires in North
Carolina in 2008, but the association was not significant
when repeated for fires in 2011 and only suggestive among
wildfires in 1 study from California.15,16,26,43,45 Other cardio-
vascular outcomes, such as cardiac dysrhythmia, or pulmonary
embolism, have not been found to have a clear association
with wildfire-PM2.5, although some suggestive effects have
been found for dysrhythmia.26,43,46 This investigation con-
tributes to those significant findings of dysrhythmia and
pulmonary embolism, but no association was found with
peripheral arterial disease, potentially because of a small
number of related ED visits.
Hypertension is another cardiovascular outcome that some
have found to have a significant association with wildfire-
PM2.5 and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of
more significant cardiovascular outcomes, such as ischemic
heart disease and non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.25,26
In this study, significant associations were also found
between wildfire smoke and hypertension diagnoses in the
ED.
In contrast to the evidence from the ambient PM2.5
literature, few studies discussed cerebrovascular impacts
associated with wildfire-PM2.5, and mostly in the context of all
cardiovascular disease outcomes combined.8,18 This study is
one of the few to explicitly investigate cerebrovascular
outcomes and to find significant associations with smoke
density defined by wildfire-PM2.5. Of 3 studies that described
this association, only 1 found elevated impacts.43,46,47
Another study of 1 wildfire season in New Mexico found
statistically significant elevated rates among adults aged 20
to 64 years (1.69 [1.03–2.77]) during the fire period.20
While the aim of this study was to explore cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular health impacts attributable to wildfire
smoke, respiratory outcomes were included for external
validity, given the strong associations between wildfire-PM2.5
and respiratory disease that have been documented else-
where, including asthma, COPD, and some respiratory infec-
tions such as pneumonia.11,12 As with other studies, positive
associations were found between wildfire smoke and asthma,
COPD, pneumonia, and respiratory-related chest pain symp-
toms. In 1 study of long-term wildfire-PM2.5 exposure and
asthma, adult women were found to be at greatest risk of
asthma-related ED visits. Differential impacts of wildfire- and
urban-PM2.5 are still being explored; 1 study found increased
pulmonary toxicity of wildfire-PM2.5 compared with back-
ground urban sources in an animal model.48 In addition to
differences in component particles in PM2.5 between urban
and wildfire sources, urban exposures can be an order of
magnitude lower but more persistent over time, while wildfire
particulate exposure can vary significantly, peaking at much
higher levels.49,50
We also used acute appendicitis and long-bone fractures
as control conditions that were not expected to be associated

 with wildfire-PM2.5 given their inflammation- and coagulation-
independent pathophysiology. No association was found with
acute appendicitis but acute appendicitis events were rare
and the resulting CIs were wide. Interestingly, an association
was found with long-bone fractures and wildfire smoke among
older adults at lag 0. Another study has used bone fractures
as a control condition and while their results were not
statistically significant, risk of bone fractures among all adults
exposed to wildfire smoke was increased (RR 1.06, 95% CI:
0.97–1.15).26 This could be because of trauma or falls,
particularly among older adults, in the context of the wildfire
response or evacuation. Motor vehicle accidents, for example,
may precipitate long-bone fractures and may be more
common during wildfire smoke events and evacuations,
during which “superfog”—a combination of smoke and
precipitation—may form at the ground level and can drasti-
cally reduce visibility on roadways.51 Additionally, cardiac and
cerebrovascular events can also precipitate falls and, given
the associations found with cardiac dysrhythmias and other
cardiac outcomes in this study, may offer another explanation
for the surprising association with long-bone fractures. Based
on the number of appendicitis-related visits and the possible
connection between cardiovascular outcomes and bone
fractures among older adults, we interpret the results for
these conditions with these considerations in mind.
A major strength of this study was using data from the
entirety of the 2015 wildfire season across a large area of
California, during which a substantial population was exposed
to a particularly intense season. This may have increased the
statistical power of detecting rare health events, such as the
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects observed in this
study. The HMS data set provided estimates of smoke density
on a smaller spatial resolution compared with the ground-
based monitoring data, particularly in rural areas of California,
where wildfires were more prevalent and monitors less so. In
some instances, an individual county may have only 1 ground-
based air monitor for PM2.5. In addition, the OSHPD
healthcare utilization data provided comprehensive state-wide
data of ED visits based on discharge diagnoses, whereas
some
other
studies
have
relied
upon
syndromic
surveillance.16,26,52 One study evaluated syndromic surveil-
lance for cardiovascular disease in New York City and found
high specificity for many of the disease entities, but often a
low sensitivity and positive-predictive value, which may
underestimate the impact of wildfire smoke on cardiovascular
disease.53
This analysis is not without limitations. In the current
analysis, because we focused on age-stratified and specific
cardiovascular outcomes, we were not able to further refine
daily counts of ED visits by other factors. For example, we did
not examine the effect of personal traits or characteristics
such as socioeconomic status, past medical history, race, sex
and other factors that may modify the association between
daily variation in smoke exposure and ED visits. The modifying
effect of these factors has previously been observed and
discussed in the literature.11,25,54 However, we did examine
the sensitivity of these results to the confounding by
socioeconomic status, such as poverty, and did not find
evidence of confounding between poverty, smoke exposure,
and health outcomes (Table S3).
The HMS data set provides smoke plume density based on
estimated PM2.5 concentrations and is characterized as light,
medium, and dense smoke, where cutoff points are chosen
with some degree of subjectivity.21 These categorical expo-
sure estimates made it difficult to complete a more nuanced
assessment of incremental changes in PM2.5 or other air
pollutants on outcomes. Additionally, the number of smoky
days was not evenly distributed between the different smoke
levels, leading to wider CIs among dense smoke results and
making the evaluation of a dose-dependent response more
challenging.
The HMS data, however, are convenient, publicly available,
and obtained via remote sensors providing more complete,
timely data compared with other publicly available ground-
based sources in California. Additionally, HMS data provide a
classification of categorical smoke density which is a
convenient representation for the purposes of making timely
public health announcements. The results of the current
analysis suggest that development of rapid ground-level air
pollutant concentration validation methods based on satellite
data could potentially be beneficial to public health risk
messaging.
While PM2.5 is a primary pollutant of concern from the
perspective of population wide exposures, smoke plumes
contain other pollutants that have known impacts on respira-
tory outcomes, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon
monoxide, coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5), and ultrafine
particulate matter (0.1 lm or less). These pollutants may play
an interactive role with PM2.5 on health outcomes. However,
other air pollutants are measured to a lesser extent with poor
geographic and spatial coverage. Additionally, a recent study
demonstrated that PM2.5 estimates alone significantly under-
estimated the particulate matter emissions of wildfire smoke
plumes in the western United States by a factor of 2 to 3.19
Therefore, examining health effects based on plume density as
visible by satellites may have its own advantages as the plume
may represent multiple air pollutants emitted from the fire.
Future research would benefit from an inclusion of co-pollutant
exposure in the analysis when such data are available.
These results may be useful for public health practitioners
in decision-making surrounding risk mitigation during wildfire
smoke events. Hospital administrators may find this informa-
tion helpful for hospital and emergency department surge

 utilization, and discharge challenges during ongoing wildfires.
Similarly, stroke centers and hospitals with cardiac catheter-
ization capabilities may find these results applicable to surge
preparation.
On the level of the individual patient, the Center for
Medicaid and Medicare Services and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, as part of the Million Hearts� 2022
framework
(https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/files/MH-Frame
work.pdf), have identified counseling of patients and family
on the risks of airborne particulate matter, along with
nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, and referral to
community-based physical activity programs and cardiac
rehabilitation, as healthcare strategies to optimize care.
Healthcare professionals may benefit from utilizing these
results for patient risk stratification and subsequent education
on risk mitigation for optimizing health care in the context of
wildfire smoke exposure. Interventions for higher-risk individ-
uals range from the well-established, such as evacuation from
the affected area or transport to a clean air shelter, and
reduction of outdoor activity, to other methods under study,
such as indoor air filtration of fine particulates or use of N-95
respirators.55,56 Further study is needed to define patient
populations at increased risk for specific events, but these
results suggest that patients with vascular and cardiac risk
factors would be among the most susceptible, including
patients with underlying coronary artery disease, heart failure,
peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular
disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.18
Conclusions
Time-series analysis was conducted of wildfire smoke and
emergency department visits for the 2015 wildfire season in
northern and central California. Despite the inconsistent
findings discussed elsewhere, in this study wildfire smoke
exposure was found to be positively associated with many
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health events, including
ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmia, heart failure, and
pulmonary embolism. Impacts were greatest among adults
≥65 years. This epidemiologic evidence helps strengthen the
association between wildfire smoke exposure and cardiovas-
cular disease outcomes and highlights the increased risk to
the older population. These findings, along with others,
support the need for clinical research to assess the clinical
and public health value of interventions to decrease exposure
to particulate matter, and particularly to wildfire smoke,
among those at highest risk.11,12,55,57–59 As wildfire season
intensity and duration is projected to increase in California,
understanding adverse health impacts of wildfire smoke and
identifying the most susceptible populations is relevant to a
broad group of stakeholders, including state and local officials
responsible
for
land
and
air
quality
management,
environmental scientists, policy makers, public health offi-
cials, and frontline public health and healthcare practitioners.

Table S3. Sensitivity Analysis - Risk of Select Outcomes Associated with Wildfire Smoke Exposure Among All Adults (19+) on Lag 0 Days, Calculated Using ZIP 
code Meta-Analysis, Poverty-Adjusted Analysis, and Compared to Manuscript Methods without ZIP code Stratification; 8 California Air Basins (Modeled, 
May 1 - September 30, 2015). Statistically Significant Relative Risks are Shown in Bold. 
 
Models adjusted for heat index, day of week, time trend, and log-population offset. RR indicates relative risk; CI, confidence interval. 
Meta-analysis excluded ZIP codes with populations less than 13,250 for model convergence. 
Poverty-Adjusted analysis did not include 9 of 738 ZIP codes for which ZIP code-specific poverty data were not available.
