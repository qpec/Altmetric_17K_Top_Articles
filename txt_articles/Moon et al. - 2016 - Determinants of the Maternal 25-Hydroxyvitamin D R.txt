Context: Current approaches to antenatal vitamin D supplementation do not account for inter-
individual differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) response.
Objective: We assessed which maternal and environmental characteristics were associated with
25(OH)D after supplementation with cholecalciferol.
Design: Within-randomization-group analysis of participants in the Maternal Vitamin D Osteo-
porosis Study trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy.
Setting: Hospital antenatal clinics.
Participants: A total of 829 pregnant women (422 placebo, 407 cholecalciferol). At 14 and 34 weeks
of gestation, maternal anthropometry, health, and lifestyle were assessed and 25(OH)D measured.
Compliance was determined using pill counts at 19 and 34 weeks.
Interventions: 1000 IU/d of cholecalciferol or matched placebo from 14 weeks of gestation until delivery.
Main Outcome Measure: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks, measured in a single batch (Diasorin Liaison).
Results: 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation was higher in the women randomized to vitamin D
(mean [SD], 67.7 [21.3] nmol/L) compared with placebo (43.1 [22.5] nmol/L; P � .001). In women
randomized to cholecalciferol, higher pregnancy weight gain from 14 to 34 weeks of gestation (kg)
(� � �0.81 [95% confidence interval �1.39, �0.22]), lower compliance with study medication (%)
(� � �0.28 [�0.072, �0.48]), lower early pregnancy 25(OH)D (nmol/L) (� � 0.28 [0.16, 0.40]), and
delivery in the winter vs the summer (� � �10.5 [�6.4, �14.6]) were independently associated with
lower 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation.
Conclusions: Women who gained more weight during pregnancy had lower 25(OH)D in early preg-
nancy and delivered in winter achieved a lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy when supplemented with
1000 IU/d cholecalciferol. Future studies should aim to determine appropriate doses to enable consis-
tent repletion of 25(OH)D during pregnancy. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 5012–5020, 2016)

 the neonate (3). Associations have been reported between
maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and obstetric
complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabe-
tes, preterm birth, and offspring anthropometry, although
the findings are inconsistent (3, 4) and require confirma-
tion in randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, the In-
stitute of Medicine (IOM) has suggested that risk of vita-
min D insufficiency, defined as a 25(OH)D less than 50
nmol/L, should be avoided during pregnancy (5), and this
is supported by the recent Global Consensus on the Pre-
vention of Rickets (6). Indeed many national guidelines
recommend universal antenatal vitamin D supplementa-
tion to prevent vitamin D insufficiency (7–9).
Risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency are well de-
scribed, and include ethnicity, extensive skin covering and
liberaluseofsunprotection,overweight/obesity,lowdietary
vitamin D intake, and smoking (1, 10, 11), in addition to the
seasonalvariationthatisobservedattemperatelatitudes(11,
12). Although vitamin D supplementation can improve ma-
ternal 25(OH)D status (10), little is known about how ma-
ternal characteristics might influence the 25(OH)D achieved
after supplementation. In nonpregnant adults, baseline
25(OH)D concentration, body weight/adiposity and age are
important determinants of the incremental rise in 25(OH)D
after vitamin D supplementation (13, 14). During preg-
nancy, maternal hemodilution is accompanied by a number
of physiological changes to both vitamin D metabolism (15)
and maternal body composition (16); such adaptations
might lead to differences in the determinants of response to
vitamin D supplementation between pregnant and nonpreg-
nant women. Clinically, understanding how individuals re-
spond could lead to individualized antenatal counseling re-
garding vitamin D supplementation to ensure vitamin D
repletionisachievedwithoutincreasingtheriskofvitaminD

ternal characteristics associated with achieved 25(OH)D af-

Materials and Methods
The Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study
(MAVIDOS)
The MAVIDOS study is a multicenter, double-blind, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation
in pregnancy. The primary outcome was neonatal bone mass. A
detailed description of the study methods (17) and primary find-
ings relating to offspring and maternal outcomes have been pub-
lished previously (18). The study was approved by the South-
ampton and South West Hampshire Research Ethics Committee.
MAVIDOS was registered prospectively (ISRCTN 82927713;
EUDRACT 2007-001716-23); full approval from United King-
dom (UK) Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Au-
thoritywasgranted,andwritten,informedconsentwasobtained
from all participants.
Briefly, women attending one of 3 UK hospitals (University
Hospital Southampton National Health Service (NHS) Founda-
tion Trust, Southampton, UK [latitude 50.9° North]; Oxford
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK [lat-
itude 51.8° North]; Sheffield Hospitals NHS Trust [University of
Sheffield], Sheffield, UK [latitude 53.4° North]) for early preg-
nancy ultrasound screening (11–14 wk of gestation) were invited
to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age over 18
years, singleton pregnancy, and gestation less than 17 weeks
based on last menstrual period and ultrasound measurements.
Women with known metabolic bone disease, renal stones, hy-
perparathyroidism or hypercalciuria, those taking medication
known to interfere with fetal growth, fetal anomalies on ultra-
sonography, and women already using more than 400 IU/d vi-
taminDsupplementationwereexcluded.Ascreeningbloodsam-
ple was obtained and analyzed on the local NHS platform (all 3
laboratories [Southampton, Oxford, and Sheffield] participate
in Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme vitamin D
quality assurance system [http://www.deqas.org/]). Women
with 25(OH)D between 25 and 100 nmol/L and serum calcium
less than 2.75 mmol/L were eligible to enroll fully in the study.
Participants were randomized to either cholecalciferol 1000
IU/d or matched placebo (Merck KGaA/Sharp Clinical Services
[previously DHP-Bilcare]), which was commenced before 17
weeks of gestation. The study medication was provided in a
blister pack in a single box containing all medication for the
whole pregnancy. All participants received standard antenatal
care and could continue self-administration of dietary supple-
ments containing up to 400 IU/d vitamin D.
Maternal assessments during pregnancy
Before commencing the study medication, and again at 34
weeks of gestation, the women attended the research center for
a detailed assessment of diet (including supplement use), lifestyle
(smoking, physical activity participation, employment), and
health (past medical history, current medication use) using in-
terviewer-led questionnaires. Ethnicity was determined by par-
ticipant self-report and subsequently categorized as White or
non-White.
Anthropometric measurements included height, measured to
the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer, and weight, assessed to

caliper. Pregnancy weight gain was calculated as the difference
between the weights at commencing study medication and 34
weeks of gestation.
Compliance with study medication
Participants were asked to bring any remaining study med-
ication to each assessment. The pills were counted and com-
pliance calculated as number consumed/expected consump-
tion based on number of days since medication was dispensed
and expressed as a percentage. The 34 week visit was used for
the calculation of compliance, and the count at 19 weeks was
used if a 34-week count was not available.
Assessment of 25(OH)D status
On the day that the study medication was dispensed and at
34 weeks of gestation, a nonfasted venous blood sample was
obtained, and serum was stored at �80°C. 25(OH)D was
assessed by RIA (Liaison RIA automated platform; Diasorin).
All samples were analyzed in a single batch at the end of the
study at Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Re-
search. Details of assay performance and quality control
through participation in Vitamin D External Quality Assess-
ment Scheme, National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy, and United Kingdom National External Quality Assess-
ment Service are given elsewhere (19, 20).
Statistical analysis
Women who had a measurement of 25(OH)D at both 14 and
34 weeks of gestation and delivered a live-born infant were in-
cluded in the analysis (because pathology associated with fetal
deathmightinfluence25(OH)Dconcentrations).Maternalchar-
acteristics were compared between the women who did and did
not complete the study using t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and
�2 tests for normally distributed, nonnormally distributed, and
categorical variables, respectively. Linear regression was used to
assess the association between maternal characteristics and
25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation for each treatment group
separately. Multivariate linear regression was subsequently per-
formed including all variables with a P � .2 from the linear
regression. Additionally, maternal factors associated with
achieving a vitamin D replete status (�50 nmol/L) were deter-
mined using Poisson regression with robust standard errors (21).
The cut-point of 50 nmol/L as the definition for vitamin D replete
status was chosen to reflect the IOM guidelines (5). Additionally,
we considered a 25(OH)D more than 125 nmol/L as indicating
risk of toxicity, as suggested by the IOM (5). In the primary trial
analysis, we classified season of birth according to the UK
Meteorological office recommendations (www.metoffice.
gov.uk) with winter (December–February), spring (March–
May), summer (June–August), and autumn (September–No-
vember). Because 25(OH)D concentrations are nonlinearly
associated with season, to facilitate ready comparison, we
collapsed this classification into 2 groups with a notional
“winter” (the months in which 25(OH)D concentrations
tended to be lowest, December-May) and a “summer” (the
months in which 25(OH)D concentrations tended to be high-
est, June-November). Finally, in sensitivity analysis, we ex-
cluded women who reported having taken any additional vi-
tamin D-containing supplements within 90 days of the late
pregnancy blood sampling. All analyses were performed in
Stata v14 (Statacorp). P � .05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Atotalof829women,whodeliveredaliveborninfantand
had measurements of 25(OH)D at both 14 and 34 weeks
of gestation, were included in the analysis (Figure 1).
Women with missing 25(OH)D measurements at 34
weeks, who delivered a live born infant (n � 136) were of
similar age, parity, height, ethnicity, educational achieve-
ment, early pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and smok-
ingstatustothoseincludedinthisanalysis(P�.05forall).
There were no significant differences in baseline charac-
teristics between women randomized to placebo and vi-
tamin D supplementation (Table 1). Compliance with
study medication was high in both treatment groups (pla-
cebo median 95% [interquartile range (IQR) 88%–98%],
cholecalciferol median 96% [IQR 89%–99%], P � .11).
Maternal 25(OH)D status at 34 weeks of gestation
by randomization group
Maternal 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation was
greater in the women randomized to cholecalciferol (mean
67.7 nmol/L [SD 21.3 nmol/L]) compared with the pla-
cebo group (mean 43.1 nmol/L [SD 22.5 nmol/L], P �
.0001); 83.3% of women randomized to cholecalciferol
achieved vitamin D replete status at 34 weeks of gestation
(�50 nmol/L) compared with 35.6% in the placebo group
(P � .001). Of the women who were not vitamin D replete
at baseline (n � 509), 78.8% in the cholecalciferol group
were replete at 34 weeks of gestation, compared with only
28.3% of the placebo group (P � .001). Similarly, only
48.4% of women who were vitamin D replete at baseline
and received placebo remained vitamin D replete at 34
weeks of gestation, compared with 89.8% in the chole-
calciferol group (P � .001). In both treatment groups, the
proportion of women who were vitamin D replete at 34
weeks of gestation was lower in those who delivered in
winter (Table 2). No participant reported symptoms sug-
gestive of vitamin D toxicity. Two participants (0.5%)
randomized to placebo and 1 to cholecalciferol (0.3%) (P
difference � .58) had a 25(OH)D more than or equal to
125 nmol/L at 34 weeks of gestation, with the maximum
value being 139 nmol/L.

the placebo and vitamin D supplementation groups (Table
3). Additionally, women who reported smoking in late preg-
nancy had significantly lower 25(OH)D in the placebo
group, but this association was not observed among women
randomized to cholecalciferol. Conversely, markers of ma-
ternal weight and adiposity were significantly inversely as-
sociated with maternal 25(OH)D in the cholecalciferol
group but not the women randomized to placebo.
In multiple linear regression analysis, maternal factors
significantly associated with greater 25(OH)D at 34

group were lower pregnancy weight gain (kg) (� � �0.81;

were significantly associated with achieving 25(OH)D
�50 nmol/L in the women randomized to cholecalciferol.
Interaction between baseline 25(OH)D and
randomization group
When comparing achieved 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of
gestation between placebo and cholecalciferol groups, it
was apparent that there was a statistically significant in-
teraction between baseline 25(OH)D and randomization
group (P � .001). Thus, there was a smaller difference in
25(OH)D concentrations at 34 weeks of gestation be-
tween the placebo and treatment arms with increasing
25(OH)D at 14 weeks of gestation.
Sensitivity analyses
As participants were permitted to continue taking daily
vitamin D supplements containing up to 400 IU, in the
sensitivity analysis we excluded 229 women (n � 117 ran-
domized to cholecalciferol) who reported taking other vi-
tamin D containing dietary supplements at the late preg-
nancy interview. Similarly, 81.0% of women randomized
to cholecalciferol were vitamin D replete at 34 weeks of
gestation, compared with 29.4% of women randomized
to placebo (P � .001). The maternal characteristics asso-
ciated with 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation and achiev-
ing vitamin D replete status were similar to those observed
in the whole cohort.
Discussion
We have assessed anthropometric and demographic fac-
tors associated with the response to antenatal supplemen-
tation with 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol. This dose achieved
vitamin D repletion in over 80% of women, without lead-
ing to 25(OH)D levels potentially associated with vitamin
D toxicity (at least within the included baseline of 25–100
nmol/L 25(OH)D). However, gaining less weight during
pregnancy, having a higher 25(OH)D in early pregnancy,
delivering in summer and having higher compliance with
supplementation were independently associated with
achieving a greater 25(OH)D concentration in late preg-
nancy among women randomized to vitamin D supple-
mentation. Thus, those women who are at risk of vitamin
D insufficiency in early pregnancy, gain greater weight,
and deliver in winter might need supplementation with a
higher dose of cholecalciferol to achieve similar 25(OH)D
concentrations. However, when vitamin D replete status

 was considered as the outcome, only non-White maternal
ethnicity and delivery in winter were significant predictors
of vitamin D nonreplete status after supplementation.
To our knowledge, the factors which determine the re-
sponse to vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy have
not previously been assessed. However, our findings are
consistent with those in nonpregnant adults (13, 14). It is
well recognized that individuals who are overweight or
obese are at higher risk of vitamin D insufficiency, and this
issimilarlyobservedinpregnancy(2,
22). Studies in nonpregnant adults
have also shown that obese individ-
uals achieve a lower 25(OH)D with
the same dose of supplementation as
nonobese individuals (14). Meta-
analysis of vitamin D supplementa-
tion studies has suggested that over
50% of the variance in 25(OH)D in-
crement in response to supplementa-
tion is explained by body weight (13).
Although the relationship between
body weight and 25(OH)D increment
after supplementation could reflect
sequestration in adipose tissue, we
found that in multivariate analysis,
prepregnancyBMIandlatepregnancy
triceps skinfold thickness (as a marker
ofadiposity),werenotassociatedwith
25(OH)D after supplementation, but
that pregnancy weight gain was nega-
tively associated. Similarly, we have
previously demonstrated that greater
gestational weight gain is associated
with a decline in 25(OH)D status dur-
ing pregnancy, independent of supple-
ment use (12). Weight gain in preg-
nancy represents not only increased
fat mass but also feto-placental tissues
and hemodilution (16); our data,
therefore, suggest that overall volume
ofdilution,andnotjustadiposity,may
be important for response to vitamin
D supplementation. However, impor-
tantly, when using a 25(OH)D more
than 50 nmol/L as a cut-point for
repletion, pregnancy weight gain
was not an independent predictor
of achieving vitamin D repletion.
Despite receiving 1000 IU chole-
calciferol per day, 25% of mothers
delivering in winter had a 25(OH)D
less than 50 nmol/L. This is a higher
nonrepletion rate than that reported
in other recent pregnancy supplement studies (23–25).
However, it is notable that there were marked differences
in baseline 25(OH)D concentrations between these inves-
tigations, and we observed that initial 25(OH)D status
was positively associated with both the likelihood of
achieving vitamin D replete status and absolute 25(OH)D
statusat34weeksofgestation.Importantly,thedifference

 in women randomized to placebo compared with chole-
calciferol decreased with increasing baseline 25(OH)D.
This is consistent with previous studies in adults, which
have shown that the incremental response to vitamin D
supplementation is higher in vitamin D insufficient than
replete subjects (13, 14) and that the increase in 25(OH)D
relative to supplementation dose is negatively associated
with dose of vitamin D supplement (26). This suggests that
physiological processes such as saturation of the hepatic
25-hydroxylase involved in the conversion of cholecalcif-
erol to 25(OH)D or conversion to 24- or 4-OH metabo-
lites, together with renal catabolism, limit attainment of
very high 25(OH)D concentrations (27). This mechanism
might be important in preventing hypervitaminosis D.
However, studies comparing the effectiveness of differing
doses of vitamin D in pregnancy have shown that 4000
IU/d can achieve a higher 25(OH)D than 400 IU/d (10,
28), but whether these higher doses are of clinical benefit
is yet to be demonstrated (4, 29) and at the general
population level, lower doses would be compatible with
keeping 25(OH)D below a concentration which might
be concerning.
It is evident from our findings that 1000 IU/d cholecal-
ciferol in pregnancy does not eliminate the seasonal vari-
ation in 25(OH)D status observed in pregnant women in
the UK (11, 12). Similarly, non-White ethnicity was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of not achieving vitamin D replete
status in the supplemented women. Hollis et al similarly
found that even with 4000 IU/d vitamin D during preg-
nancy, African-American women had lower 25(OH)D in
late pregnancy than Caucasian or Hispanic women (10).
Thus, future studies should aim to determine the dose re-
quired to achieve optimal 25(OH)D status among women
of non-White ethnicity and among those who deliver in
winter months. Maternal age was also positively associ-
ated in univariate analyses with 25(OH)D achieved at 34
weeks of gestation in women who received vitamin D sup-
plementation. It has previously been shown in pregnant
women that age is positively associated with 25(OH)D
status (30, 31). Although lower uptake of supplementa-
tion in younger women (12) could partly explain this ob-
servation, our finding would additionally suggest that
even in younger women who do use supplements, the
achieved 25(OH)D is lower. Data from healthy and hos-
pitalized adults have similarly shown that older individ-
uals achieve a higher 25(OH)D after vitamin D supple-
mentation (13, 32). As such, young pregnant women
mightparticularlyrequireadviceontheneedfor,andcom-
pliance with, vitamin D supplementation.
Although our findings are novel, and may enable the
development of individualized advice for antenatal vita-
min D supplementation, there are a number of limitations
which should be considered in the interpretation of this
study. Firstly, we could not, as a result of stipulations
made during the ethics approval process, include partici-
pants with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 25 nmol/L
or more than 100 nmol/L. As baseline 25(OH)D was as-
sociated with the likelihood of achieving vitamin D replete
status, it is likely that women with very low levels of
25(OH)D at baseline will require a higher supplementa-
tion dose to achieve vitamin D repletion. However, this
needs to be confirmed in future studies. Secondly, only a
small proportion of the women included in this study were
of non-White ethnicity. This reflects the local populations
and care should be taken in translating these findings to a
more ethnically diverse population. Thirdly, we did not
examinegeneticdeterminantsoftheresponsetovitaminD
supplementation. It has been demonstrated previously
that the incremental rise in 25(OH)D after supplementa-
tion differs by single nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin
D binding protein (33, 34) and 25-hydroxylase genes (33).
Although this genetic information can enable a more com-
prehensive understanding of the biochemical response to
vitamin D supplementation, the current inability to un-
dertake genotyping on a widespread population basis
means this additional information would not allow for
alterations to current clinical practice regarding vitamin D
supplementation in pregnancy. Finally, during pregnancy,
a number of physiological changes occur to vitamin D
metabolism, including an increase in vitamin D binding
protein and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (15), indices that
we were not able to include in our analysis.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that women who
gain more weight during pregnancy, have lower 25(OH)D
in early pregnancy, or deliver in winter tend to achieve a
lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy when supplemented
with 1000-IU/d cholecalciferol than do women with the
converse attributes. Future studies should aim to deter-
mine appropriate doses to enable consistent repletion of
25(OH)D during pregnancy, and our findings support the
notionthatclinicalapproachestovitaminDrepletionmay
be informed by individual characteristics. As such, per-
sonalized vitamin D supplementation advice might be-
come part of future antenatal care.
