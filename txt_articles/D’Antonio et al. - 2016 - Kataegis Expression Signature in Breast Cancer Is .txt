SUMMARY
Kataegis is a mutational process observed in �55%
of breast tumors that results in hypermutation in
localized genomic regions. Using whole-genome
sequence data of 97 tumors, we examined the distri-
bution of kataegis loci, showing that these somatic
mutations are over-represented on chromosomes
8, 17, and 22 and enriched in genic regions and active
chromatin elements. We show that tumors harboring
kataegis are associated with transcriptome-wide
expression changes consistent with low invasive po-
tential. We exploit the kataegis expression signature
to predict kataegis status in 412 breast cancers with
transcriptome but not whole-genome sequence data
and show that kataegis loci are enriched in high-
grade, HER2+ tumors in patients diagnosed with
breast cancer at an older age and who have a later
age at death. Our study demonstrates that kataegis
loci are associated with important clinical features
in breast cancer and may serve as a marker of
good prognosis.
INTRODUCTION
Kataegis is a mutational process that has been observed in
several cancer types (Alexandrov et al., 2013) and results in hy-
permutation (a few to several hundred C > T and C > G substi-
tutions enriched at TpCpN trinucleotides) on the same DNA
strand in small localized genomic regions (Taylor et al., 2013).
Alexandrov et al. (2013) computationally modeled a variety of
mutational signatures and defined kataegis as six or more
consecutive mutations with average intermutation distances
of %1 kb. Kataegis was first studied in breast cancer, in which
>50% of tumors contain one or more kataegis loci (Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012b), often in the vicinity of structural rearrangements
(Nik-Zainal et al., 2012a). A subfamily of the APOBEC (apolipo-
protein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like)
cytidine deaminases has been implicated as a source of katae-
gis mutations in part because aberrant expression in yeast
generates a similar C > T substitution mutational signature
(Roberts et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2013). Whether kataegis
plays a role in breast cancer etiology and is associated with
clinical features or is simply a byproduct of aberrant APOBEC
activity is unknown.
Here, we investigated the functional and clinical impact of
kataegis on breast cancer by studying: (1) associations be-
tween the chromosomal positions of kataegis loci and those
of functional elements, (2) gene expression differences be-
tween tumors that do and those that do not harbor kataegis
loci, and (3) associations between the occurrence of kataegis
and the occurrence of clinical features. We show that kataegis
loci are not randomly distributed across the genome but are
enriched in regions containing genes and functional regulatory
elements, in addition to being over-represented on chromo-
somes 8, 17, and 22 and depleted on chromosomes 2, 9,
and 16. Our study also shows that genes in the vicinity of ka-
taegis loci (within 500 kb) are less likely to be aberrantly ex-
pressed than distal genes. We determined that breast cancers
harboring kataegis have a transcriptome-wide
expression
signature that is consistent with low invasive potential and en-
ables the kataegis status of a tumor to be predicted using RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Furthermore, breast cancers that
harbor kataegis loci are enriched in patients with high-grade,
HER2+ tumors who are diagnosed at an older age and have a
higher age at death.
RESULTS
We analyzed the whole-genome sequences of 97 breast tumors
and their associated normal DNA, obtained from the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA), and detected 387,289 high-confidence
somatic mutations (Table S1A). For each tumor sample, we
calculated distances between somatic substitutions and found
a total of 132 kataegis loci (1–10 per sample) distributed across
55 samples (56.7%) (Figures 1A and S1; Table S1B). These 132
kataegis loci are significantly enriched for C > T and C > G sub-
stitutions, as expected (Figure 1B) (Taylor et al., 2013).

 Distribution of Kataegis Loci in the Genome
We examined the distribution of kataegis loci across the
genome with respect to chromosomal positions and functional
elements. We observed that the 132 kataegis loci are preferen-
tially located on chromosomes 8, 17, and 22 and depleted on
chromosomes 2, 9, and 16 (Figure 2A) as determined by per-
mutation testing (10,000 permutations). The coordinates of ka-
taegis loci overlap with copy number variations (CNVs = 83,
corresponding to 62.8% of all loci) at a higher rate than ex-
pected by chance (Figure 2B), consistent with the findings of
a previous study (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012a). Next, we intersected
the coordinates of each kataegis locus with functional elements
including (1) 15 chromatin states defined in three Roadmap Ep-
igenomics breast cell lines (Ernst et al., 2011; Roadmap Epige-
nomics Consortium et al., 2015); (2) gene coordinates derived
from Gencode; (3) DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), which
are marks of active chromatin, defined in two Encyclopedia
of DNA Elements (ENCODE) breast cell lines, human mammary
fibroblast (HMF), and T47D (Neph et al., 2012); and (4) binding
sites for 25 transcription factors derived from 66 different chro-
matin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments
in four ENCODE breast cell lines: human mammary epithelial
primary cell (HMEC), T47D, HMF, and MCF7. After correcting
for local sequence characteristics (see Experimental Proce-
dures), we determined that kataegis loci occur at a significantly
higher rate than expected within marks of active chromatin,
coding sequences, DHSs, and transcription factor binding sites
(65 of the 66 ChIP-seq experiments) (Figures 2C and 2D; Table
S2), which is consistent with previous findings (Kazanov et al.,
2015). All three Roadmap breast cell lines demonstrate strong
enrichment (�15 times higher than the expected random distri-
bution) in regions corresponding to active transcription start
sites (TSSs) and high depletion (on average 14 times lower
than the expected random distribution) in quiescent regions
(genomic loci that are not transcribed and do not overlap
ChIP-seq peaks associated with transcription factor binding
sites or histone modifications) (Lawrence et al., 2013). These
data demonstrate that kataegis loci are not found at random
positions in the genome but are preferentially located in func-
tional sequences that correspond to active chromatin in normal
breast tissue and breast cancer.
Kataegis Loci Stabilize the Expression of Neighboring
Genes
Because kataegis loci are enriched in regulatory elements (in
particular, TSS) and coding sequences, we investigated whether
they influence the expression of neighboring genes. For each tu-
mor harboring kataegis, we compared the expression level of
each gene (20,502 total genes) to the expression levels observed
in 106 unrelated normal breasts derived from TCGA. Considering
all 132 kataegis loci, nearby genes (within 500 kb) are less likely
to be downregulated than the transcriptome-wide average (p =
3.0 3 10�16) (Figure 3A). Because somatic CNVs can affect
gene expression, we investigated kataegis loci that do not over-
lap CNVs, that overlap CNV amplifications, and that overlap CNV
deletions as separate groups. We confirmed that neighboring
genes are less likely to be downregulated than expected in all
three groups of kataegis loci (Figures 3B–3D). In addition, neigh-
boring genes of kataegis loci that do not overlap CNVs or overlap
CNV deletions are less likely to be upregulated compared to the
transcriptome-wide average. These data show that genes neigh-
boring kataegis loci are less likely to be aberrantly expressed,
suggesting that the kataegis loci are somehow stabilizing their
expression.

 Gene Expression Signature Can Be Used to Predict
Kataegis Status in Tumors
We investigated whether kataegis mutations are associated
with transcriptome-wide expression differences. Using RNA-
seq data, we examined 20,502 human genes (Table S3) for differ-
ential expression between the 55 tumors with and the 42 tumors
without kataegis and detected significant differences in 628
genes. A principal-component analysis (PCA) using the expres-
sion levels of these genes showed distinct gene expression sig-
natures for breast cancer samples with and without kataegis
(Figures 4A and S2). To confirm the presence of these dis-
tinct expression signatures, we performed consensus clustering

 (Monti et al., 2003) using the first five principal components and
showed that samples with and without kataegis clearly separate
into distinct clusters (Figure 4B). Overall, the results from PCA
and consensus clustering indicate that gene expression data
can be used to discriminate between tumors with and those
without kataegis.
We explored whether the gene expression signature could be
exploited to predict the presence of kataegis in 998 TCGA breast
cancer samples that have RNA-seq but not whole-genome
sequence data. We built a generalized linear model (GLM) to pre-
dict the presence of kataegis loci using the first five principal
components and kataegis status of the 97 TCGA discovery tu-
mors as input. We performed a 10-fold cross-validation on the
97 TCGA discovery tumors and using the 95% confidence inter-
val (CI) of the GLM observed a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (Figure S2C; Table
S4A). We applied this model to the 998 TCGA tumors with only
RNA-seq data, of which 412 had values at the 95% confidence
level and could be assigned to one of the two categories (180
breast tumors with kataegis and 232 without kataegis) (Figure 4C;
Table S4B), while 586 samples could not be assigned and were
excluded from further analyses. These findings demonstrate that
our GLM (95% CI) is able, with high confidence, to separate sam-
ples with predicted kataegis loci from those without predicted
kataegis loci.

fications (n = 39), and (D) kataegis loci that overlap

lated with a Wilcoxon test.
Kataegis Status Is Associated with
Clinical Features
Kataegis is associated with a specific
expression signature, which leads us to
hypothesize that tumors carrying these
mutations may also be correlated with
particular clinical profiles. Therefore, we
studied the association between pres-
ence of kataegis and therapeutic treat-
ment, presence of known driver muta-
tions, breast cancer subtypes, tumor
grade, and patient age at diagnosis and
at death. The treating physicians of these
patients did not know the kataegis status
of their tumors. We initially examined the
412 patients with predicted kataegis sta-
tus for differences in clinical properties
and then investigated whether the same
associations hold in the 97 patients with
known kataegis status. Comparison of
the 180 patients and the 232 patients
whose tumors are predicted to harbor and not harbor kataegis
loci, respectively, shows that the former are less likely to undergo
therapy (q = 0.0185, Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hoch-
berg correction for multiple testing hypothesis) and, in particular,
hormone therapy (q = 0.0043) (Figures 5A–5D), more likely to
have mutations in TP53 (q = 1.4 10�8), and more likely to be es-
trogen receptor-negative (ER�) (q = 3.3 10�4), progesterone re-
ceptor-negative (PR�) (q = 3.3 10�6), and HER2+ (q = 1.4 10�8)
(Figures 5E–5I). We did not detect significant associations be-
tween predication of kataegis and chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
or presence of mutations in PIK3CA. The set of breast cancers
with predicted kataegis loci are composed of fewer luminal A
(ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2�) and a greater number of luminal
B (ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2+) and HER2-enriched tumors
(ER�, PR�, and HER2+, q = 1.2 10�10) (Figure 5J), and a lower
proportion are grade I tumors (q = 0.018) (Figure 5K). We also
examined 1,992 breast cancer samples in the METABRIC data-
set (Curtis et al., 2012) and observed significant associations be-
tween kataegis expression signature and ER�, PR�, and HER2+
status and mutations in TP53 (Figure S3). Tumors with predicted
kataegis are enriched in the HER2+ subtype, which is consistent
with the finding that they tend to be higher grade (Slamon et al.,
2006) and carry TP53 mutations (Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012). Likewise, tumors with predicted kataegis tend to be ER�
and PR�, which is consistent with the finding that the patients are
Cell Reports 16, 672–683, July 19, 2016
675
 less likely to undergo hormone therapy, which targets these re-
ceptors. Overall, these data show that kataegis tends to occur
in higher-grade breast tumors that are HER2+.
We also found that patients with predicted kataegis loci tend
to present with breast cancer at a later age (q = 0.0048, Cox pro-
portional hazard test adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg
method for a multiple testing hypothesis) (Figures 5L and S4A–
S4C), which is observed when restricting the analysis to only pa-
tients with grade II tumors (Figure 5M) and more prominent when
considering only grade III tumors (Figures 5N and S4C). The age
at death for patients with predicted kataegis is higher (q = 0.097,
Wilcoxon test adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for
a multiple testing hypothesis) (Figures S4D–S4F). We observed
that there is significantly shorter survival after diagnosis for pa-
tients with predicted kataegis (Figures S4G–S4I) but propose
that this is due to a significantly higher age at diagnosis and
consequently a shorter interval before death due to non-can-
cer-related causes. Considering all 412 TCGA patients, we
observe a significant negative correlation (�0.09, p = 0.039) be-
tween age at diagnosis and survival after diagnosis. To deter-
mine whether the difference in survival after diagnosis is due to
differences in age at diagnosis, we divided the patients into
four age groups, assessed the differences in survival after diag-
nosis between patients with and those without predicted katae-
gis in each age group, and found no significant differences
(Figures S4J–S4M), confirming that the shorter survival after
diagnosis for patients with predicted kataegis is likely due to their
older age. These data show that tumors with kataegis are en-
riched in patients diagnosed at later ages who tend to have a
higher age at death.
Analyses of the 97 TCGA patients with known kataegis status
shows similar trends with regards to clinical features, as
observed in 412 TCGA patients with predicted kataegis status
(Figures S5A–S5K). In particular, patients with kataegis loci are
enriched for being HER2+ (p = 0.066) (Figure S5I) and grade III
(p = 0.015, Fisher’s exact test) (Figure S5K). These patients
also tend to present with breast cancer at a later age (age at
diagnosis is 60.3 years compared to 54.1 years in patients
without kataegis, p = 0.0303, q = 0.0909, Cox proportional haz-
ard test adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method for a
multiple testing hypothesis) (Figures S5L–S5N) and the age at
death is higher (median age at death is 78 years compared to
47 years in patients without kataegis, p = 0.008, q = 0.059)
(Figures S5O–S5Q). There is no observed difference in the sur-
vival after diagnosis when considering all patients with known
kataegis status (q = 0.809, Cox proportional hazard test) (Figures
S5R–S5T), but patients with grade II tumors containing kataegis
tend to have improved survival (q = 0.0599) (Figure S5S).
Because whole-genome sequence data are available for these
97 TCGA tumors, we were able to examine whether the associ-
ation between CNVs and kataegis loci confounds the relation-
ship between kataegis and clinical features. We investigated
whether patients with tumors harboring kataegis loci that overlap
(n = 42) or do not overlap with CNVs (n = 13) vary in age at
diagnosis and determined that no differences exist (p = 0.631,
Wilcoxon test) (Figure S5U). This analysis suggests that the as-
sociations we observe between kataegis loci and clinical vari-
ables are not confounded by the association between kataegis
and CNVs. These analyses confirm that tumors with kataegis
loci are enriched in patients who are diagnosed at an older
age, die later in life, and have tumors that are higher grade and
HER2+.
Kataegis Status Is a Marker of Good Prognosis
Given the high degree of covariance between kataegis and
several well-established clinical variables, we investigated
whether kataegis status could be predicted by one or more clin-
ical variables. We fit a linear model to predict the kataegis status
in the 412 TCGA tumors based on the following variables: HER2
status, PR status, ER status, tumor grade, and presence of mu-
tations in TP53. Of all the clinical features examined, only tumor
grade was a weak predictor of kataegis (p = 0.048, t test)

 (Figure S6A), suggesting that the observed associations be-
tween kataegis and age of diagnosis and at death are not
confounded.
To examine kataegis as a prognostic marker, we used two in-
dependent methods. We initially defined a bad prognosis as
death before 55 years of age, while living patients and those
who died when they were older than 55 years were considered
to have a good prognosis. We fit a linear model to predict prog-
nosis using clinical variables (HER2 status, PR status, ER status,
tumor grade, and presence of mutations in TP53) and kataegis
status in the 412 TCGA patients. Kataegis is the only variable
that significantly contributes to prognosis (p = 0.020, t test) (Fig-
ure S6B). In addition, by analyzing the coefficients of the linear
model, we determined that, among these variables, kataegis
has the highest impact on prognosis (Figures S6C–S6F). We
next examined whether kataegis can predict age of death using
a Cox proportional hazard model. We used HER2 status, PR sta-
tus, ER status, presence of mutations in TP53, tumor grade, and
kataegis status as input variables, with the age at death or age at
last contact as the response variable. We found kataegis to be
the only significant predictor of age at death (Figure S6G). These
analyses demonstrate that kataegis is a better marker for good
prognosis than established clinical variables.
Functional Characterization of Tumors with Kataegis
To investigate the molecular underpinnings of the clinical differ-
ences between tumors with and those without kataegis loci, we
used the information coefficient (IC) (Kim et al., 2016) to examine
the 97 TCGA tumors with known kataegis status. IC is an infor-
mation-theoretic association metric that allows the discovery
of linear or non-linear correlations between genomic alterations
(here the presence or absence of kataegis loci) and functional
phenotypes, such as gene expression levels, protein expression
data, and pathway enrichment (Table S5). Using this approach,
we found that samples with kataegis are significantly associated
with high mRNA levels of PLAC1 (an immunotherapeutic target
for gastric adenocarcinoma) (Figure 6A) (Liu et al., 2015), high
HER2 (native and phosphorylated), EGFR (Figure 6B), and
ACC1 (involved in regulation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis) pro-
tein levels (Figure 6C) (Keenan et al., 2015). In addition, these
samples display low c-Myc protein (Figure 6D) and Ras-like pro-
tein GEM levels (Figure 6E). We next used the IC to investigate
molecular differences between tumors harboring kataegis loci
on chromosomes 8 and all other breast tumors. Kataegis loci
on chromosome 8 are associated with high expression of
DCLRE1B (a gene involved in DNA cross-link repair whose
expression is influenced by SNP rs11552449, a risk factor for
breast cancer (Caswell et al., 2015) (Figure 6F; Table S5). In addi-
tion, they are associated with high expression of SMARCE1 (a
suppressor of EGFR) (Figure 6G) (Papadakis et al., 2015), high
protein levels of ER-alpha (Figure 6H), and low inflammation
levels, as shown by the downregulation of the interleukin-5
(IL-5) pathway and the expression levels of VNN1, a gene
involved in lymphocyte migration (Figure 6J). The IC analysis
was also used to identify molecular differences between tumors
with kataegis loci on chromosome 17 and all other tumors and
between tumors with kataegis on chromosome 22 and all other
tumors. Tumors with kataegis on chromosome 17 or 22 are
associated with upregulation of HER2 and EGFR (Figures 6K
and 6L; Table S5). Of the 16 tumors with kataegis loci on one
of these two chromosomes, 11 tumors are HER2+ (68.8%) (Table
S1A), whereas only 8 tumors of the remaining 73 tumors are
HER2+ (11.0%, p = 2.1 10�6, Fisher’s exact test). Kataegis loci
on chromosome 17 are also associated with inactivation of the
NOTCH1 pathway (Figure 6M). Furthermore, kataegis loci on
chromosome 17 are strongly associated with the downregula-
tion of several pathways associated with aggressive metastatic
tumor behavior and HER2� tumors (in particular, basal-like
breast cancers, which are ER�, PR�, and HER2�) and the upre-
gulation of pathways associated with HER2+ tumors (in partic-
ular, luminal breast cancer) (Figure 7; Table S5). Overall, the IC
analyses conducted showed that kataegis occurs in tumors
that may have better response to treatment, given the overex-
pression of the immunotherapeutic target PLAC1 and the down-
regulation of genes involved in imatinib resistance. In addition,
kataegis loci across the genome are associated with higher
levels of HER2 and EGFR, while those on chromosome 17 are
specifically associated with low levels of NOTCH1 and gene
sets predictive of low invasiveness.
To further characterize the functional differences between tu-
mors with and without kataegis, we performed single-sample
gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) (Barbie et al., 2009; Sub-
ramanian et al., 2005) using the 50 hallmark Molecular Signatures
Database (MSigDB) gene sets derived from Liberzon et al. (2015).
We discovered that tumors harboring kataegis loci significantly
downregulate genes involved in cell-cell interactions, response
to hypoxia, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis,
and hematopoietic lineage, as well as KRAS, necrosis factor kB
(NF-kB), and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling path-
ways (Figure S7; Table S6). These expression differences suggest
that tumors with kataegis are more epithelial-like and have less
organized extra-cellular matrix and vasculature, with consequent
lower migration potential. These findings suggest that tumors
harboring kataegis loci may be less invasive.
DISCUSSION
Kataegis loci have previously been associated with several tu-
mor types, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lym-
phoma, leukemia, and lung adenocarcinoma (Alexandrov et al.,
2013). Although this phenomenon is present in more than 50%
of breast tumors (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012b), its role in tumorigen-
esis has not been thoroughly investigated. We show that katae-
gis loci are strongly associated with a transcriptome-wide
expression signature, which we exploited to predict the pres-
ence of kataegis in an independent set of 412 breast cancers
from TCGA. Our findings suggest that kataegis loci may mitigate
the aberrant expression of neighboring genes and thus do not
affect tumorigenesis in a manner similar to known regulatory
driver mutations (Killela et al., 2013; Weinhold et al., 2014). We
demonstrate that kataegis is enriched in patients whose tumors
are high grade and/or HER2+ and in patients who present cancer
at a later age and have a higher age at death. Although we do not
have information about the cause of death for breast cancer pa-
tients included in TCGA, patients without kataegis tend to die
younger (median age at death is 47 years) than patients with
678

 kataegis (median age is 78 years), which leads us to hypothesize
that they are more likely to die from breast cancer than are pa-
tients with kataegis.
It was previously shown that kataegis loci are often associated
with genomic rearrangements, although most rearrangements
do not exhibit kataegis (Alexandrov et al., 2013). We show that

 although there is a significant difference in the age at diagnosis
between breast cancer patients with and those without kataegis,
in the 55% of patients with tumors that have kataegis, there is no
difference in age at diagnosis between those that overlap (76%)
and those that do not overlap (�24%) with CNVs. In addition to
being co-localized with CNVs, kataegis loci are enriched in
genomic intervals harboring genes and regulatory elements
(DHSs, promoters, and transcription factor binding sites). These
data suggest that the previously observed association between
kataegis loci and CNVs may be confounded by both types of mu-
tations occurring preferentially in regions of open chromatin (Lu
et al., 2014). The observation that mutations driven by APOBEC
localize in open chromatin regions (Kazanov et al., 2015) sup-
ports this hypothesis.
The differences in pathway enrichment, gene expression, and
protein levels between breast cancers with and those without ka-
taegis, as determined by IC analysis, are consistent with the as-
sociations found with clinical features (i.e., tumors with kataegis
are associated with higher age at diagnosis and later age at
death, high HER2 levels, and higher grade). In particular, IC anal-
ysis confirms that tumors with kataegis express high levels of
HER2, which are known to have good response to treatment
and better prognosis (Voduc et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011). In
addition, tumors with kataegis upregulate a known immunother-
apeutic target (PLAC1) (Liu et al., 2015), and tumors with katae-
gis loci on chromosome 8 are correlated with downregulation of
genes involved in imatinib resistance (Mahadevan et al., 2007).
Thus, tumors containing kataegis loci may have better response
to treatment and kataegis may potentially serve as a predictive
marker for therapy outcome. We found that kataegis is associ-
ated with the inhibition of oncogenic pathways, such as KRAS
and NF-kB, and reduced expression of genes involved in migra-
tion, which is predictive of less invasive tumors (Eser et al., 2014).
Kataegis loci on chromosome 17 are strongly associated with
the downregulation of several pathways involved in aggressive
metastatic tumor behavior and HER2� tumors. Furthermore, tu-
mors with kataegis display a downregulation of genes and path-
ways involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, extracel-
lular matrix organization, and vasculature, suggesting that they
likely have a higher proliferation rate and lower invasion potential
(Mallini et al., 2014). Thus, pathway enrichment and expression
analysis suggest that tumors with kataegis likely have low inva-
sive potential, which is consistent with enrichment in patients
with a higher age at diagnosis and later age at death. In conclu-
sion, our results provide important insights into the role kataegis
plays in cancer etiology and suggest that the kataegis expres-
sion signature may serve as a marker for better prognosis in
breast cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

The BAM files of whole-genome sequences of 97 matched breast tumor and
blood samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub,

 https://browser.cghub.ucsc.edu/, frozen December 19, 2013) at the University
of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) (Wilks et al., 2014). Duplicated reads were
removed using Samtools 0.1.18 (Li et al., 2009), and then base-quality recali-
bration and local realignment around insertions or deletions were performed
using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.1.6-5-g557da77 (DePristo et al.,
2011). MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013) was used to call somatic point substitu-
tions in the 97 tumor genomes. Only substitutions with at least 14 reads
coverage in the tumor, 8 reads in the matched normal, and an allelic fraction
of >10% in the tumor were retained (Lawrence et al., 2013), resulting in
986,526 somatic mutations. All mutations within repetitive elements (Repeat-
Masker track from the UCSC Genome Browser) (Smit, 1999) were removed
to decrease the number of potential false positives, resulting in 387,289
high-confidence somatic mutations.
Identification of Breast Functional Elements
Functional elements active in breast were derived from four sources. First, 15
ChromHMM states (Ernst et al., 2011) associated with three breast cell lines
(E027, breast myoepithelial primary cells; E028, breast variant human mam-
mary epithelial cells [vHMECs]; and E119, HMECs) were retrieved from Road-
map Epigenomics (http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/) (Roadmap
Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015). Next, the coordinates of 34,020 genes
were derived from Gencode v.19 (Mudge and Harrow, 2015). Then, 266,757
DHSs from a HMF line (Wang et al., 2010) and 278,680 from the T47D breast
cancer cell line (Judge and Chatterton, 1983) were retrieved from the UCSC
Genome Browser track wgEncodeUwDgf by ENCODE (Neph et al., 2012).
Finally, ChIP-seq data for transcription factor binding sites was retrieved
from the ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding super-track on the UCSC
Genome Browser. To analyze transcription factor binding sites, we down-
loaded 66 tracks from four cell lines (HMEC, T47D, HMF, and MCF7), including
11 NarrowPeak files from the Uniform transcription factor binding site (TFBS)
track (wgEncodeAwgTfbsUniform), 42 BroadPeak files from the Hudson Alpha
Institute for Biotechnology (HAIB) TFBS Track (wgEncodeHaibTfbs), 11 Nar-
rowPeak files from the University of Texas, Austin (UTA) TFBS Track (wgEnco-
deOpenChromChip), and 2 BroadPeak files from the University of Washington
(UW) CTCF Binding (wgEncodeUwTfbs).
Permutation Tests
The position of each kataegis locus was permutated 10,000 times on the
genome using the runif function in R. The number of kataegis loci per sample
was maintained constant for each randomization, which was important for the
CNV analysis, because the distributions of CNVs are different across the 97
breast cancer genomes. Positions of each kataegis locus and all randomized
loci were intersected with (1) the 22 autosomal chromosomes and the X chro-
mosome, and (2) CNVs obtained from TCGA. Z scores were calculated as the
difference between the number of kataegis loci observed to overlap each class
of elements and the mean value in the 10,000 randomizations, divided by the
SD in the 10,000 randomizations.
Well-defined sequence characteristics are known to influence local muta-
tion probability. To determine whether kataegis loci are enriched, particularly
chromatin features, analyses were conducted by comparing each kataegis lo-
cus to genomic intervals with similar characteristics. We excluded centromeric
regions and divided the rest of the genome into 3 kb intervals (corresponding
to the average kataegis locus length) (M.D.A., D. Weghorn, A. D’Antonio-Chro-
nowska, C. DeBoever, F. Drees, A. Arias, F. Coulet, R.B. Schwab, S.R. Su-
nyaev, and K.A.F., unpublished data). We performed k-means clustering on
the basis of the values of (1) DNA replication timing (Koren et al., 2012), (2)
open and closed chromatin status measured by Hi-C mapping (GEO:
GSE35156) (Dixon et al., 2012), (3) GC content (Chapman et al., 2011), and
(4) local gene density (Lawrence et al., 2013). Local gene density was calcu-
lated as the fraction of base pairs within 250 kb overlapping RefSeq genes,
while the values for the other covariates were derived from the corresponding
publication. Genomic intervals were binned into 637 clusters. We determined
the percentage of kataegis loci that overlap each chromatin state or transcrip-
tion factor binding site and compared it with the null distribution derived from
selecting 100 random regions from the same clusters as the kataegis loci. Z
scores were calculated as the number of SDs between the mean percentage
across the 100 random sets and the observed value for kataegis loci.
Expression Analysis of Genes within 500 kb of Kataegis Loci
For 106 normal breast samples (unrelated to the tumor samples), normalized
expression levels derived from RNA-seq data were downloaded from TCGA.
The expression levels for each gene in each of the 55 breast tumors with ka-
taegis were compared with the 106 normal breast samples using edgeR
with default parameters (Robinson and Smyth, 2008). We considered a gene
in a tumor upregulated or downregulated if it had p < 0.05 after adjustment
for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The number of up-
regulated and downregulated genes near to (<500 kb distance) and distal from
each kataegis locus were calculated in each of the 55 tumors with kataegis,
and the Wilcoxon method was used to test for significance.
Identifying Upregulated and Downregulated Genes in Tumors with
Kataegis
Normalized expression levels of 20,502 human genes derived from RNA-seq
data for the 97 breast cancers were downloaded from TCGA. EdgeR with
default parameters (Robinson and Smyth, 2008) was run to determine the dif-
ferences in expression levels between samples with and those without katae-
gis for all 20,502 genes. The p values derived from edgeR were adjusted for
multiple testing hypotheses with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Adjusted
p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Model to Predict the Presence or Absence of Kataegis Loci in Breast
Cancer Samples
PCA was performed on the 628 genes with significant expression differences
between the 55 tumors with kataegis and the 42 tumors without kataegis. The
first five principal components, as well as kataegis status (presence of katae-
gis = 1, absence of kataegis = 0), were used as input to train a GLM using the
function glm in R with parameter family = binomial (link = logit). We also tested
a random forest method (using the function RandomForest from the Random-
Forest package in R) and a more stringent method that used the 95% CI values
of the GLM prediction (samples with a lower boundary >0.75 were considered
to be harboring kataegis loci, and samples with an upper CI boundary <0.25
were considered to not be harboring kataegis). To assess the performance
of these three models, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation; the 97 tumors
were divided into ten bins, and the presence of kataegis was predicted on one
bin (the testing set) using the other nine as training sets. By repeating this anal-
ysis using each of the ten bins as the testing set, the accuracy of predicting ka-
taegis status in all 97 tumors was determined (Figure S2C; Table S4). The GLM
(95% CI) performed the best, with a ROC AUC of 0.94.
Predicting the Kataegis Status in 998 TCGA Tumors
The normalized expression levels of the 20,502 human genes in 998 breast
cancers derived from RNA-seq data were downloaded from TCGA. Although
the GLM predictor and random forest methods were able to predict kataegis
status in all samples, we decided to employ the GLM (95% CI) method for
greater accuracy. Principal-component data were determined for the 998
breast cancer samples and used to predict the presence of kataegis, using
the function predict.glm in R with parameters type = link, se.fit = TRUE. This
parameter allows retrieval of the standard error of the prediction, which was
used to determine the prediction’s 95% CI.
Clinical Features of Breast Cancers
Level 2 Biotab files containing clinical information for the 1,095 breast can-
cer patients included in this study were downloaded from TCGA data
portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDownload.jsp). Values marked
as Equivocal, Indeterminate, [Not available], and [Not evaluated] were not
used in the statistical tests shown in Figures 5 and S6.
Assessing the Impact of Kataegis on Prognosis in Breast Cancer
A linear model (function lm in R) was used to show that kataegis status could
not be predicted based on clinical variables (HER2 status, PR status, ER sta-
tus, tumor grade, and presence of mutations in TP53) and to show that katae-
gis is the only significant predictor of prognosis. To determine the relative
impact of each of these variables on prognosis, the function calc.relimp
(included in the relaimpo package in R) (Gro
¨ mping, 2006) was applied to the
linear model using four distinct methods (Figure S6B): (1) R2 contribution
Cell Reports 16, 672–683, July 19, 2016

 averaged over orderings among regressors (Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold’s
method [LMG]), (2) usefulness, (3) squared covariance between prognosis
and each variable, and (4) product of the standardized coefficient and the cor-
relation (Darlington, 1968; Gro
¨ mping, 2007).
The survival Cox proportional hazard linear regression model was performed
using the coxph function in the Survival package in R. Input variables were
HER2 status, PR status, ER status, tumor grade, kataegis status, and pres-
ence of mutations in TP53, while age at death or age at last contact was
used as output.
Functional Analysis of Tumors with and without Kataegis with IC and
ssGSEA
The IC analysis (Kim et al., 2016) was performed using 11 distinct datasets as
input: (1) RNA-seq gene expression levels derived from TCGA (19,921 genes),
(2) reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) levels for 142 proteins derived from
TCGA, (3) ssGSEA pathway enrichment levels for 4,496 chemical and genetic
perturbation gene sets derived from MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2011, 2015), (4)
ssGSEA pathway enrichment levels for 217 Biocarta pathways, (5) ssGSEA
pathway enrichment levels for 674 Reactome pathways, (6) ssGSEA enrich-
ment levels for the targets of 221 microRNA, (7) ssGSEA enrichment levels
for the targets of 608 transcription factors, (8) ssGSEA enrichment levels for
426 cancer gene neighborhoods, (9) ssGSEA enrichment levels for 431 cancer
modules, (10) ssGSEA enrichment levels for 279 oncogenic signatures, and
(11) ssGSEA enrichment levels for 52 hallmark gene sets derived from MSigDB
(Liberzon et al., 2011, 2015). The IC analysis was run separately for (1) all tu-
mors with kataegis, (2) tumors with kataegis loci on chromosome 8, (3) tumors
with kataegis loci on chromosome 17, and (4) tumors with kataegis loci on
chromosome 22. The IC analysis is based on the use of a normalized differen-
tial mutual information function, which is a non-linear correlation coefficient
(Kim et al., 2016) with values in the range [�1,1], with 1 representing a perfect
match with kataegis and �1 representing a perfect anti-match. For the cases
of binary phenotypes (e.g., the kataegis status) and continuous genomic fea-
tures (e.g., gene expression), the IC becomes the generalized Jensen-Shan-
non divergence (Kim et al., 2016). An ssGSEA (Barbie et al., 2009) was used
to project the breast cancer samples into the space of the 50 hallmarks and
the larger collection of 9,092 gene sets divided into 11 distinct datasets as
input mentioned earlier. The significance of the associations between the Ka-
taegis phenotype and the genomic features was obtained by an empirical per-
mutation test on the Kataegis phenotype. The permutation IC values are then
used to create a null distribution from which nominal, family-wise error rate
(FWER), and Bonferroni p values and false discovery rates (FDRs) are
computed.
