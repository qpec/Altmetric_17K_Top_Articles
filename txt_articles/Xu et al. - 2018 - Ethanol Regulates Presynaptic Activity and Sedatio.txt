Abstract
Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it is not yet clear how this drug acts
within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology
in vivo. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol
binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol
(DAG) binding. The inhibition of DAG binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic
release. In Drosophila, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle
release in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and
Ca2� influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing
synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Drosophila, haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog Dunc13, are more resistant
to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of Dunc13 through mutation or
expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The
neuronal expression of Munc13-1 in heterozygotes for a Dunc13 loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the
ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between Munc13-1 and Dunc13 in
ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing Dunc13 activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to
sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing Dunc13 activity, genetically or pharmacologically
by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to
ethanol tolerance.
Key words: Drosophila; ethanol; Munc13-1; presynaptic; resistance; tolerance
Significance Statement
At relatively low concentrations, ethanol inhibits the activity of many presynaptic termini (Liu and Hunt,
1999). Homeostatic changes in presynaptic activity are proposed to underlie the formation of functional
tolerance (Koob and Bloom, 1988; Ghezzi and Atkinson, 2011). We do not currently know where ethanol
binds to bring about changes in presynaptic activity and homeostasis. We now show that ethanol will bind
to the C1 domain of the Munc13-1 protein at intoxicating concentrations and inhibit the binding of
diacylglycerol (DAG). Reducing the activity of the Drosophila Dunc13 ortholog leads to a homeostatic
change that promotes behavioral and physiologic resistance to intoxicating levels of ethanol. Hence, Unc13
proteins are likely sites for ethanol’s action within the presynaptic compartment that bring about tolerance.

 Introduction
Addiction to alcohol remains one of the most significant
mental health problems throughout of the world. A major
challenge is to understand how ethanol changes behavior
and the brain during the descent into addiction. A prom-
ising approach is to examine endophenotypes for this
disease in model systems (Dick et al., 2006; Salvatore
et al., 2015). One major endophenotype for the develop-
ment of alcoholism is the naïve behavioral sensitivity to
ethanol, wherein the sons of alcoholics there is a fourfold
increase in the likelihood of alcoholism among those with
a reduced naïve sensitivity to the intoxicating effects of
alcohol (Schuckit, 1980, 1994; Schuckit et al., 1996). The
naïve resistance to ethanol intoxication may be mecha-
nistically related to the formation of tolerance that follows
exposure to high concentrations of ethanol (Harris et al.,
2008; Mayfield et al., 2008).
During binge alcohol exposure, ethanol creates wide-
spread and long-lasting changes in neural activity, alter-
ing both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. An effect
of ethanol on presynaptic release is seen at concentra-
tions below 100 mM, where this drug typically produces
its sedative effects (Diamond and Gordon, 1997). A single
amino acid polymorphism in the Munc-18 active zone
protein and its homolog unc-18 were found to generate
strong resistance to ethanol sedation in mouse and Cae-
norhabditis elegans, respectively (Fehr et al., 2005; Gra-
ham et al., 2009). This mutation in Unc18 also decreased
the frequency of synaptic vesicle release (Graham et al.,
2009). The loss of synaptic vesicle proteins Rab-3A and
its homolog Rab-3 also results in the resistance to ethanol
sedation in both C. elegans and mouse (Kapfhamer et al.,
2008). Ethanol inhibits presynaptic vesicle release in rat
hippocampal slices induced by extracellular K� triggered
depolarization and dependent on voltage-gated calcium
channel activity (Maldve et al., 2004). Since Munc-18,
Rab-3A, and voltage-gated channels are essential for
presynaptic exocytosis, ethanol may alter presynaptic ac-
tivity by changing the probability of synaptic vesicle fu-
sion. The mechanism by which ethanol effects reduction
in presynaptic activity is unknown, but one candidate is
the slowpoke large conductance BK channel. The activity
of the slowpoke BK channel has an important role in
ethanol sedation and tolerance in both Drosophila and C.
elegans (Davies et al., 2003; Cowmeadow et al., 2005,
2006). Ethanol can directly bind to BK channels and the
binding is essential for ethanol sedation in C. elegans (Bu-
kiya et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2014). However, BK channel is
expressed both presynaptically and postsynaptically, and it
is not yet clear how much of the change in presynaptic
activity is attributed to ethanol binding to presynaptic BK
channels (Sailer et al., 2006).
Munc13-1 is also an alcohol binding protein and a
strong candidate for producing an effect of alcohol in the
presynaptic compartment (Das et al., 2013). Munc13-1 is
an active-zone protein essential for synaptic vesicle fu-
sion (Betz et al., 1997, 1998; Rhee et al., 2002). Munc13-1
directly interacts with and coordinates several other mem-
bers of vesicle fusion machinery at presynaptic action zones in
the mammalian brain, including syntaxin, RIM, Munc18, and
voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), (Rizo and Xu,
2015). The C1 domain of Munc13-1 binds diacylglycerol
(DAG), which promotes membrane localization of this pro-
tein and lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion, facil-
itating synaptic vesicle release (Basu et al., 2007). Ethanol
binds to the Munc13-1 C1 domain in vitro at concentra-
tions below 100 mM (Das et al., 2013). Reduction in the
level of Dunc13, the Drosophila ortholog of Munc13-1,
results in flies that self-administer ethanol at significantly
higher levels than wild-type controls (Das et al., 2013).
Herein, we demonstrate that ethanol inhibits DAG binding
to the Munc13-1 C1 domain at concentration as low as 25
mM. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila that ethanol im-
pairs synaptic vesicle release in excitatory neurons down-
stream of Ca2� influx into the active zone and that the
reduction in Dunc13 produces a behavioral and physiologic
resistance to sedative effects of ethanol.

Ethanol sedation
The ethanol loss of righting reflex (LOR) assay was
performed as previously described (van der Linde et al.,
2014). Female flies were collected and placed in vials
containing fresh food (1 n � 30 flies per vial) for 24 h
before behavioral testing. They were then transferred to
the empty plastic vials of the test apparatus and exposed
to a stream of ethanol vapor (50% unless noted) at a flow
of 250 ml/min for 1 h to test for ethanol sensitivity. The
ethanol vapor was produced by bubbling fresh air through
100% ethanol and pure water and mixing the two kinds of
vapors. The % ethanol refers to the percentage of the final
air/ethanol stream made up of the air bubbled through
ethanol. The percentage of flies sedated in each vial was
recorded at 5-min intervals. A fly was counted as being
sedated if it had fallen onto its back or side and could not
right itself. The time to 50% LOR was calculated for each
exposure tube by linear interpolation of the two time
points around the median and then averaged over the
number of tubes (Ojelade et al., 2015).
Ethanol metabolism and absorption
The ethanol metabolism and absorption assay has been
described before (Urizar et al., 2007). To study ethanol
absorption, 30 female flies were exposed to 50% ethanol
vapor at a 250 ml/min flow rate for 0, 20, 40, or 60 min.
Immediately after exposure, flies were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and homogenized in 200 �l of 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 15,000
� g at 4°C for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected.
The ethanol concentration in the supernatant was mea-
sured using the Ethanol Assay kit (catalog #MAK076,
Sigma-Aldrich). To determine whether equivalent amounts
of flies were assayed for each genotype, the protein con-
centration in the fly extracts was measured using the DC
protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Ethanol metabolism
was examined by exposing flies to 50% ethanol vapor for
60 min and allowing flies to recover for a period of 0, 30,
60, or 120 min. The ethanol concentration in fly extracts
was measured at the end of each recovery period.
Optical imaging and ethanol injection
Optical imaging was performed on live flies as previ-
ously described with modifications (Zhang and Roman,
2013). Each female fly was fixed on a pipette tip and its
head was secured to the tip opening with wax. The cuticle
on the top of head was removed and covered with a piece
of plastic wrap.
Before injection, each dissected female fly was checked
through gently touching the tip of its foreleg with forceps.
If the fly’s femur did not show any movement, it would be
discarded since it might be dead or close to dying. To
inject ethanol, a small piece of pipette tip which contained
fixed fly was removed to expose its scutellum. An insect
pin (catalog #26002-10, Fine Science Tools) was inserted
between scutum and scutellum to make a hole. A glass
pipette (top diameter �20 �m), was inserted into the hole.
Then an injector (MINJ-PD, Tritech Research) linked with
the glass pipette was turned on to inject �0.1 �l ethanol
solution into fly. The injected solution was Ringer’s solu-
tion plus 15% ethanol.
After 10 min, the injected fly was imaged under an
upright confocal microscope with a 20� objective (SP8,
Leica). Ethyl acetate was diluted in mineral oil to 1% and
delivered with an air flow at a rate of 400 ml/min bubbled
through the mineral oil. The delivery of odorants was
accomplished with a CS55 stimulus controller (Syntech),
which added the odor to an airstream. Flies were exposed
to 1-min air and then 3-s odor; there were no mechanical
disturbances during the transition from air to odor.
After the imaging, each fly was taken out of the pipette
tip to check for viability. Most of the flies exhibited leg
movements. However, if a fly’s legs showed no movement,
it was considered dead, and the data were discarded.
Biochemistry
The Munc13-1 C1 domain in pGEX-KG vector was
kindly provided by Dr. Josep Rizo (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX). Site-specific
mutations in the Munc 13-1 C1 domain were introduced
with PCR by presenting the mutation in oligonucleotide
primers using the he QuikChange II Site-Directed Mu-
tagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The Munc 13-1 C1
domain wild-type or the mutant fused with glutathione
S-transferase (GST) were expressed in BL21 DE3 gold
Escherichia coli (Agilent Technologies). Munc13.1C1 and
its E582A mutant were purified following the methods
described earlier (Das et al., 2013). Fluorescence reso-
nance energy transfer (FRET) between Munc13.1 C1 and
dansyl-DAG were determined using a PTI fluorimeter
(Photon Technology Instruments; Pany and Das, 2015).
Samples containing Munc13.1C1 (1 �M) and dansyl-DAG
(1 �M) in buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM
ZnSO4; pH 8) were incubated for 30 min at 25°C. For
measuring the effect of ethanol, mixtures were incubated
with ethanol (25 and 50 mM) for 30 min at 25°C. Samples
were then excited at 280 nm, and emission spectra were
recorded from 300 to 550 nm. Emission maxima of
Munc13.1 C1 and dansyl-DAG were found to be at 337
and 500 nm, respectively. Relative FRET indices were
calculated from fluorescence intensity at 500 nm using for-
mula: [(Fi � Munc13.1C1) � (Fi, �Munc13.1C1)] � [(F0 �
Munc13.1C1) � (F0� Munc13.1C1)], where Fi � Munc13.1C1
and Fi � Munc13.1C1 are the intensities of Dansyl-DAG in
the presence and absence of Munc13.1C1, respectively,

 and F0� Munc13.1C1 and F0� Munc13.1C1 are fluores-
cence intensities of the buffer solution in the presence or
absence of Munc13.1C1, respectively. The change in flu-
orescence intensities for each concentration of alcohol
was normalized using the equation: (1-F/F0) � 100, where
F and F0 are intensities of dansyl-DAG plus Munc13.1C1
in the presence or in the absence of alcohol.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
The differences between two groups were tested with
two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests; the differences among
multi-group data were tested with two-way ANOVA
(treatment � genotype), followed by Bonferroni-Dunn
post hoc tests. Planned within genotype comparisons
within these data were analyzed by Student’s t tests. For
each fly in the optical imaging experiments, the maximum
fluorescent intensity change ratio before and after stimu-
lation were calculated first. Then the ratio of vehicle-
injected flies and ethanol-injected flies was analyzed by
two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests. For t test and
ANOVA, � � 0.05.
Results
Ethanol binding to the C1 domain inhibits DAG
binding
Ethanol may affect sedation by binding to Munc13-1/
Dunc13 and directly changing the activity of these regu-
lators of vesicle priming. Previously, ethanol was found to
bind the E582 residue in the C1 DAG binding domain of
Munc13-1 (Das et al., 2013). Since the distance between
the E582 ethanol binding residue and the DAG binding site,
His567, is only 8.8 A, ethanol binding to the C1 domain
may impact DAG binding (Das et al., 2013). To investigate
this question, we measured the effect of ethanol on the
ability of the Munc13-1 C1 domain to bind DAG in vivo.
FRET between the C1 domain and dansyl-DAG was used
to quantify the relative amounts of DAG bound to the C1
domain in vitro. C1 domain fluorescence at �340 nm
excited the dansyl-DAG and the dansyl-DAG emission
was quantified at 500 nm (Fig. 1A,B). Overall, changing
ethanol concentration and genotype of the C1 domain
had a significant effect dansyl-DAG binding (F(3,14) � 10.321,
p � 0.001; genotype, t � 4.058, p � 0.001). Ethanol
concentrations of 25 and 50 mM significantly reduced
FRET between the wild-type Munc13-1 C1 domain and
dansyl-DAG (t � 16.97 and t � 12.121, respectively, p �
0.001 for both). However, FRET between the Munc13-
1E582A and dansyl DAG was not significantly altered by 25
and 50 mM ethanol (t � 0.439, p � 0.684 and t � 0.781,
p � 0.479, respectively). This resistance to ethanol meant
that the mutant E582A C1 domain was significantly less
sensitive to the effects of ethanol at both 25 and 50 mM
concentrations as compared to the wild-type C1 domain
(t � 3.68, p � 0.021 and t � 7.21, p � 0.002; Fig. 1C).
Hence, ethanol binding to the C1 domain reduces the
affinity
for
DAG,
presumably
leading
to
reduced
Munc13-1 activity. This inhibition relies on ethanol’s inter-
action with the C1 domain at E582.
Ethanol inhibits presynaptic vesicle release in
Drosophila
If the ethanol-induced inhibition of Munc13-1 activity is
an important mechanism for ethanol effects on presynap-
tic activity, then ethanol should impact synaptic vesicle
release in vivo, without impacting preceding presynaptic
activation events. To examine this prediction, we mea-
sured the effect of ethanol on presynaptic activity in Dro-
sophila of the OR42b olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)
using optical physiology techniques. The OR42b neurons
are excitatory cholinergic neurons that are strongly acti-
vated by ethyl acetate (Hallem and Carlson, 2006). The
OR42b OSN axons converge in the DM1 glomeruli (Gao
et al., 2000; Couto et al., 2005). The Or42b-Gal4 line was
used to drive three different genetically encoded sensors:
ArcLight to measure changes in membrane depolarization
(Cao et al., 2013); G-CaMP5 to measure Ca2� influx into
the presynaptic compartment (Akerboom et al., 2012);
and synapto-pHluorin to measure synaptic vesicle fusion
(Yuste et al., 2000; Reiff et al., 2005). These changes in
fluorescence were measured in the DM1 glomeruli of the
antennal lobe after a 3-s presentation of ethyl acetate. To
measure the effect of ethanol on the physiologic changes
Figure 1. Ethanol binding to the C1 domain inhibits DAG binding. A, Spectral emission after excitation at 290 nm reveals FRET
between the Munc13-1 C1 domain and dansyl-DAG (red trace). The C1 domain emission peaks at �335 nm (cyan trace), while the
dansyl-DAG emission peak is found at 500 nm (black trace). This FRET is disrupted by 50 mM ethanol (green trace). B, Spectral
emission of the Munc13-1 E582A mutation after excitation by 290-nm light is shown. C, The binding of dansyl-DAG as revealed by
FRET emission at 500 nm is reduced at both 25 and 50 mM ethanol concentrations. The E582A C1 domain mutation fails to bind
ethanol (Das et al., 2013). Ethanol does not inhibit dansyl-DAG binding to the E582A Munc13-1 C1 domain (n � 3 each; �p � 0.05,
���p � 0.001). Error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM).

 in the OR42b OSN, we injected either 0.1 �l vehicle or
15% ethanol before imaging each fly. The ethanol-injected
flies stopped normal leg movements, and appeared com-
pletely sedated for a period of �20 min. The flies were all
imaged during this period of sedation. Vehicle-injected flies
continued normal leg movements throughout the imaging
period. Flies that did not recover leg movements after 20 min
were excluded from the analysis.
Ethanol sedated flies did not have any detectable changes in
ethyl acetate-induced membrane depolarizations within
the presynaptic compartments of OR42b OSNs com-
pared to vehicle-injected flies (t � 0.198, p � 0.845; Fig
2A,B). Similarly, we failed to detect a significant change in
ethyl acetate induced Ca2� influx into the OR42b OSN
presynaptic compartment after ethanol sedation (t �
0.744, p � 0.464; Fig. 2C,D). In contrast, a significant
decrease in the ethyl acetate elicited synaptic vesicle
fusion was detected in the ethanol sedated flies (t �
4.129, p � 0.0002; Fig 2E,F). Together, these data that
indicate that intoxicating levels of ethanol inhibits synaptic
vesicle fusion largely independent of the incoming action
potentials and resulting Ca2� influx into the presynaptic
compartment. These data are consistent with a role for
ethanol-induced inhibition of Dunc13 activity, leading to a
reduction in presynaptic release. It remains possible that
ethanol may still impact Ca�2 influx within the presynaptic
compartment in other time scales, such as minutes, but
that we were unable to detect this effect. Munc13-1 en-
hances the function of presynaptic VGCC through direct
interactions between these channels and the Munc13
C2B domain (Calloway et al., 2015). Hence, it remains
possible that ethanol may subtly inhibit VGCC and pre-
synaptic
activity
by
inhibiting
the
binding
between
Munc13-1 and DAG.
Lastly, we asked if the inhibition of presynaptic vesicle
fusion in response to ethanol was altered in the behavior-
ally resistant Dunc13P84200/� flies. The Dunc13P84200 al-
lele is a loss-of-function mutant with a P-element insertion
into the Dunc13 locus (Aravamudan et al., 1999). Ho-
mozygotes for this allele fail to display neurotransmission
in the embryonic neuromuscular junction and die late in
embryogenesis (Aravamudan et al., 1999). The heterozy-
gotes have �50% wild-type levels of Dunc13 mRNA (Das
et al., 2013). In this experiment, there was a significant
difference between groups (F(2,81) � 21.474, p � 0.0001).
As previously shown, injection of ethanol decreased the
vesicle fusion in the OR42b OSNs elicited by ethyl ace-
tate, however, the Dunc13P84200/� flies were less sensi-
tive to this presynaptic inhibition as compared to wild-
type controls (t � 2.224, p � 0.031; Fig 2G,H). Naïve
Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes are physiologically more
resistant to ethanol’s inhibition of presynaptic activity.
Dunc13 activity modulates ethanol sedation
To examine whether the Dunc13-ethanol interaction
impacts behavioral responses to this drug, we further
examined the effect of reducing the activity of the Dunc13
on behavioral sensitivity to ethanol. Dunc13P84200/� flies
were previously shown to display a significantly higher
level of ethanol self-administration (Das et al., 2013).
Since increases in ethanol self-administration in Drosoph-
ila are likely a response to the hedonic properties of this
drug (Devineni and Heberlein, 2009; Kaun et al., 2011; Xu
et al., 2012), it is possible that the increased self-
administration in the Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes is
due to a naïve difference in the sensitivity to the neural
effects of ethanol. To determine whether Dunc13 activity
is involved in ethanol intoxication, we examined heterozy-
gotes for the Dunc13P84200 mutation in a LOR assay (van
der Linde et al., 2014). In the LOR assay, flies are exposed
to ethanol vapor, which passively enters through their
respiratory systems, increasing their internal alcohol con-
centrations (van der Linde et al., 2014). This leads to
progressively more flies losing their righting-reflex with
time. We use the T1/2, which is time needed for 50% of the
flies to lose their righting reflex, to compare differences in
the rate of intoxication (van der Linde et al., 2014).
Genetically reducing Dunc13 activity results in a re-
duced sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol. The
Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes are significantly more re-
sistant to the sedative effects of ethanol than wild-type
controls (t � 7.246, p � 0.001; Fig. 3A). This increased
resistance to ethanol vapor found in the Dunc13P84200/�
heterozygotes was not due to differences in the absorp-
tion of ethanol (F(4,41) � 9.19, genotype difference t �
0.583, p � 0.563; Fig. 3B), or in the rate at which the
heterozygotes metabolize the ethanol (F(4,43) � 11.16,
genotype difference t � 0.037, p � 0.971; Fig. 3C). More-
over, driving the expression of the Dunc13KK101383 RNAi
transgene throughout the nervous system using the
n-Syb-Gal4 driver, also dramatically reduced the ethanol
sedation sensitivity (F(2,33) � 72.73, p � 0.0001; Fig. 3D).
The T1/2 LOR for the experimental genotype, with Dunc13
RNAi being driven throughout the nervous system, was
significantly longer than both the Gal4 driver control (t �
7.36, p � 0.0001) and the Dunc13 RNAi control genotypes
(t � 19.18, p � 0.0001). The flies were viable, which
suggested a partial knockdown of Dunc13 in neural tissue.
Lastly, we induced the expression of the Dunc13JF02440 RNAi
transgene postdevelopmentally in neurons with the elav-
Gal4 and Gal80ts20 transgenes (McGuire et al., 2003).
There were significant differences between groups in this
experiment (F(3,31) � 5.191, p � 0.005). A 24-h 30°C
induction of Dunc13 RNAi expression also leads to a
significant decrease in ethanol sedation sensitivity com-
pared to the within genotype control (t � 2.95, p � 0.011;
Fig. 3E). Hence, reducing Dunc13 activity through muta-
tion or by using two nonoverlapping RNAi lines expressed
in the nervous system by two independent neuronal driv-
ers, all result in flies that are more resistant to the sedative
effects of ethanol. The independence of these drivers and
RNAi lines provide a strong indication that reducing
Dunc13 activity, similar to the Dunc13P84200/� haploinsuf-
ficent flies, produces a resistance to the sedative effects
of ethanol. The ability of the induced Dunc13JF02440 RNAi
expression to decrease ethanol sedation sensitivity fur-
ther suggests that this change results from a physiologic
rather than a developmental response to reduced Dunc13
activity, however, the RNAi transgene was expressed for

 2 d in this experiment, which would permit homeostatic
response to the reduced Dunc13 activity.
We further verified the requirement for wild-type levels
of Dunc13 for normal sedation sensitivity by rescuing the
haploinsufficiency of the Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes.
Previously, we had shown that a rat Munc13-1::EGFP
cDNA was capable of rescuing the Dunc13P84200/� in-
creased ethanol self-administration phenotype when ex-
pression was induced throughout the nervous system
(Das et al., 2013). Herein, we examined whether Munc13-1::
EGFP expression could also complement the Dunc13P84200
haploinsufficiency in ethanol sedation (F(3,56) � 9.875, p �
0.0001). The induced expression of this Munc13-1::EGFP
transgene (48 h at 30°C) reduced the ethanol sedation
sensitivity phenotype of Dunc13P84200/� females (t �
3.90, p � 0.001; Fig. 3G). The activity of Munc13-1 can
therefore functionally complement the Dunc13 activity
required for normal ethanol sedation sensitivity. These
data further indicate that ethanol sedation sensitivity is
modulated by Dunc13/Munc13-1 activity.
We next examined whether Munc13-1::EGFP could
also rescue the lethality of Dunc13P84200 homozygotes.
Two different UAS-Munc13-1::EGFP transgenes failed to
rescue the late embryonic lethality of Dunc13P84200 when
driven by Tubp-Gal4, elav-Gal4, or n-Syb-Gal4, suggest-
ing that Munc13-1 may not be able to fully complement
Dunc13 neural functions (over 300 progeny of each ge-
notype, with no viable homozygous Dunc13P84200 adult
progeny). One possible reason for the lack of full comple-
mentation could be due to problems in trafficking the
relatively large Munc13-1::EFGP protein to the presynap-
tic compartment. To see whether the Munc13-1::GFP
protein was localized to the presynaptic compartment in
Drosophila, we examined the neuromuscular junction of
3rd instar larvae with the genotype: UAS-Munc13-1::GFP/�;
nsyb-Gal4/�. Munc13-1::EGFP was located within the presyn-
aptic compartment in puncta. Bruchpilot, a protein localized to
presynaptic active zones (Wagh et al., 2006), was found to
be largely colocalized with Munc13-1::EGFP, although
there exists some Munc13-1::EGFP puncta that are non-
overlapping with Bruchpilot signals and vice versa (Fig.
3H). Hence, the Munc13-1 was trafficked to presynaptic
compartments.
Discussion
The work that we present here identifies a new presyn-
aptic mechanism for modulating ethanol sedation sensi-
tivity. Ethanol binds to the C1 domain of Munc13-1 (Das
et al., 2013), which inhibits DAG binding in vitro. This
inhibition occurs within the physiologically intoxicating
range of 25–50 mM ethanol (Majchrowicz, 1975). Inhibit-
ing DAG binding will decrease the activity of Unc13 pro-
teins by reducing the membrane localization of this
protein, leading to an increased energy barrier for vesicle
fusion and a reduction in synaptic vesicle release (Lackner
et al., 1999; Basu et al., 2007). We found using in vivo
optical physiologic approaches in Drosophila that intoxi-
cating levels of ethanol did not significantly affect either
membrane depolarization or Ca2� influx within the pre-
synaptic compartment of activated OR42b neurons, but
synaptic vesicle fusion was dramatically inhibited in the
neurons by these intoxicating levels of ethanol. Although
our results do not show a significant effect on presynaptic
Ca2� levels after alcohol, we cannot rule out that the
localization of Ca2� microdomains was not impacted by
ethanol. Nevertheless, our imaging results indicate that
ethanol acts to inhibit synaptic vesicle release down-
stream of voltage-gated Ca2� influx, which is consistent
with ethanol inhibition of presynaptic activity through the
reduction of DAG binding to Dunc13.
To verify a role for Dunc13 in the physiologic and behav-
ioral sensitivity to ethanol, we examined flies that had re-
duced levels of Dunc13 activity. A simple prediction would
be that these genetically sensitized flies, having already lost
some Dunc13 activity would be more sensitive to the effects
of ethanol. However, the genetically sensitized flies were
physiologically and behaviorally resistant to sedating con-
centrations of ethanol. The Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes
displayed reduced sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol
on synaptic vesicle fusion in the OR42b OSNs, and these
flies also displayed reduced behavioral sensitivity to eth-
anol sedation. The reduced behavioral sensitivity to eth-
anol in the Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes was partially
reversed by neural expression of either Dunc13 or
Munc13-1 cDNAs, indicating the phenotype was pro-
duced by a haploinsufficiency of Dunc13. Moreover, two
independent and nonoverlapping Dunc13 RNAi lines also
displayed reduced sedation sensitivity. Together these
data indicate that reducing Dunc13 levels reduces the
naïve responsiveness to the sedative effects of ethanol.
The functional complementation of Munc13-1 for Dunc13
haploinsufficiency in the LOR assay but not for the viability of
the Dunc13P84200 homozygotes indicates at least a partially
conserved function between these orthologs in Drosoph-
ila. There can be several reasons for the inability of a
Munc13-1 cDNA to rescue the lethality of the homozy-
gous Dunc13P84200 flies, including differences in func-
tional activity, expression levels, and protein localization.
Munc13-1 contains several identified functional domains:
C1 domain for DAG binding (Betz et al., 1998), CBS
domain for binding calmodulin (Dimova et al., 2009), C2A
domain for heterodimerization with RIM and regulating
later steps in vesicle docking and priming (Betz et al.,
2001; Camacho et al., 2017), C2B domain for binding
phospholipid and VGCCs (Shin et al., 2010; Calloway
et al., 2015), C2C domain, which may bind the plasma
membrane (Rizo and Südhof, 1998), and MUN domain for
binding syntaxin (Li et al., 2011). Although the C1, CBS,
C2B, C2C and MUN domains of mammalian unc-13 and
Drosophila unc-13 are highly conserved, Dunc13 lacks a
conserved C2A domain (Aravamudan et al., 1999). It is

 Figure 3. A reduction in Dunc13 activity leads to an increased resistance to ethanol sedation. A, The Dunc13P84200/� heterozygotes
require a greater time to reach 50% LOR (T1/2 LOR) reflex levels (���p � 0.001, n � 17). B, The concentration of ethanol was
determined in Dunc13P84200/� and control flies exposed to 50% ethanol vapor for 0, 15, 30, or 45 min; no significant differences were
found (p � 0.05, n � 6). C, The ability of Dunc13P84200/� and control flies to metabolize ethanol was determined by first exposing
flies to ethanol vapor for 45 min, and then by measuring the ethanol remaining in the flies 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after the exposure.
No significant differences in ethanol metabolism were detected at each time point (t � 0.037, p � 0.05, n � 6). D, The neural
expression of the Dunc13KK101383 RNAi transgene led to significantly slower T1/2 LOR compared to the genotype controls (���p �
0.05, n � 10). E, The induced neural expression of the Dunc13JF02440 RNAi transgenes also led to a significantly slower T1/2 LOR as
compared to the within genotype control (p � 0.01, n � 8). Induction was accomplished with a 24 h, 30°C heat treatment, followed
by a 3-h recovery period at room temperature. F, Inducing the expression of a wild-type Munc13-1 cDNA for 48 h led to a significant
decrease in LOR for the Dunc13P84200/� flies (���p � 0.001, N � 9). Induction was accomplished with a 48 h, 30°C heat treatment,
followed by a 3-h recovery period at room temperature. G, Munc13-1::EGFP is colocalized with Bruchpilot, a protein localized to
presynaptic active zones, in the presynaptic compartment of the larval neural muscular junction. All error bars are SEMs.

 currently unclear if the Dunc13 protein physically interacts
with RIM in docked vesicles, but since this is a central
interaction for vesicle priming it is likely this interaction is
conserved in Drosophila. Interestingly, the C2A domain
and the neighboring N-terminal sequences are necessary
for the C. elegans unc-13 isoform L to be correctly located
at the active zone (Hu et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013). We
found that the Munc13-1::EGFP was localized to puncta
in the larval neural muscular junction, although not com-
pletely overlapping with the active zone Bruchpilot pro-
tein.
How does a reduction of Dunc13 activity lead to a
resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol?
The
Dunc13P84200/�
haploinsufficiency
and
the
neurally-expressed Dunc13 RNAi lines likely mimic the
initial effects of intoxicating concentrations of ethanol on
this protein by genetically reducing its activity. The ge-
netic or pharmacological reduction in Dunc13 activity
would be expected to generate a widespread reduction in
the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP; Augustin
et al., 1999). This reduction in the RRP would produce
synaptic depression, triggering a homeostatic response in
the affected synapses (Davis and Goodman, 1998; Frank,
2014). Work from the Drosophila neural muscular junction
has demonstrated two convergent mechanisms for ho-
meostatic increases in presynaptic activity: potentiating
Ca2� influx through VGCCs and by increasing the RRP (Frank
et al., 2009; Müller et al., 2012). In vertebrate central synapses,
similar presynaptic homeostatic mechanisms have been dis-
covered in which inhibition of activity leads to increases in
both presynaptic Ca2� influx and in synaptic vesicle re-
lease (Zhao et al., 2011). The presynaptic portion of this
process may be largely driven by changes in cyclin-
dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activity (Kim and Ryan, 2010).
Suppression of synaptic activity decreases CDK5 activity,
which in turn promotes presynaptic Ca2� influx and in-
creases the resting vesicle pool available for promotion
into the RRP (Kim and Ryan, 2010).
The homeostatic changes in synaptic efficacy brought
about by ethanol reducing Dunc13 activity may mimic
tolerance. Ethanol resistance and tolerance share a re-
duced response to this drug but differ in their ontogeny.
Tolerance is a reduced responsiveness to alcohol brought
about by previous exposure to this drug, whereas resis-
tance refers to an innate difference in sensitivity to alcohol
(Ghezzi and Atkinson, 2011; Rothenfluh et al., 2014). Dro-
sophila melanogaster undergoes functional tolerance
when exposed to high levels of alcohol, but does not
develop metabolic tolerance (Scholz et al., 2000). This
functional tolerance in Drosophila can be long lasting and
dependent on epigenetic changes in gene expression and
new protein synthesis (Berger et al., 2004; Cowmeadow
et al., 2006; Engel et al., 2016).
There has been increasing evidence from Drosophila
indicating that the development of functional tolerance is
triggered by changes in presynaptic activity. Conditional
alleles in the dynamin gene shibire (shi) can completely
block the formation of rapid functional tolerance (Krishnan
et al., 2012). At nonpermissive temperatures, the dominant
negative shits alleles block synaptic vesicle recycling result-
ing in a depletion of the vesicle pool and a loss of presyn-
aptic activity as well as other endocytosis-dependent
events, such as receptor internalization (Kosaka and Ikeda,
1983). When this block in vesicle recycling was induced
during sedation, there was a failure in the production of
tolerance, while if it occurred after the initial binge expo-
sure, there was no impact on tolerance, indicating a role
for shi in the induction of tolerance (Krishnan et al., 2012).
Interestingly, blocking neural activity during sedation us-
ing a paralyticts conditional allele in a voltage-gated so-
dium channel or temperature-sensitive alleles of the
comatose NSF protein did not block the formation of
functional tolerance. These data suggest that dynamics in
the presynaptic vesicle pool during ethanol sedation, and
not changes in presynaptic activity per se, are required for
tolerance formation (Krishnan et al., 2012).
Alcohol exposures that induce functional tolerance also
bring about long-lasting changes in the levels of several
presynaptic proteins that are required for the induction of
functional tolerance (Ghezzi et al., 2013). Some of these
transcriptional changes necessary for chronic tolerance
require the activity of the Sir2 histone deacetylase (Engel
et al., 2016). These Sir2-dependent epigenetic changes
regulate the activity of presynaptic proteins including Syn-
apsin and also likely the cacophony voltage-gated Ca2�
channel and the cdk5 kinase, which are known to have
important roles in presynaptic homeostatic responses to
reduced synaptic activity (Davis, 2013; Frank, 2014). Mu-
tants in Synapsin are defective in tolerance formation, but
not in naïve sedation (Godenschwege et al., 2004; Engel
et al., 2016). Moreover, increases in the level of the slow-
poke BK channel are also required for the development of
functional tolerance (Cowmeadow et al., 2005; Cow-
meadow et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013). Increases in slow-
poke increase the ability for hire frequency firing (Ghezzi
et al., 2010). This increase in high-frequency firing may
reverse synaptic depression by facilitating the ability of
Ca�2 to increase the rate at which the RRP is replenished
(Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998).
In sum, there is strong evidence for specific homeo-
static changes in presynaptic activity underlying ethanol
tolerance, and an initial trigger for these changes may be
ethanol inhibiting the binding of DAG to the C1 domain of
Dunc13. A testable prediction from this hypothesis for the
inhibition of Dunc13 as an initial event in the formation of
tolerance is that compounds or mutations, such as the
Munc13-1 E582A, that inhibit ethanol binding to the C1
domain will reduce tolerance formation (Das et al., 2013).
However, for these reagents to be useful in elucidating the
role of Dunc13 inhibition in tolerance formation, they need
to have a limited effect on Dunc13/Munc13-1 activity in
the absence of ethanol. Otherwise they may lead to the
same homeostatic changes in naive animals found after
exposure to intoxicating levels of ethanol.
