Abstract
Importance—Healthcare professionals commonly recommend increased water consumption, 
typically to 8 cups/d, as part of a weight-reducing diet. However, this recommendation is based on 
limited evidence and virtually no experimental data in the pediatric age range.
Objective—The aim of this study was to compare two standard weight-loss diets, either with 
(Water) or without (Control) additional advice and behavioral support to increase habitual water 
intake to 8 cups/d.
Design—6-month randomized controlled parallel-group design.
Setting—The trial was conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, between 
February 2011 and June 2014.
Participants—38 overweight and obese adolescents who reported drinking ≤4 cups of water/d.
Intervention—Both groups received similar weight-reducing interventions, differentiated by 
water messages but controlled for other dietary recommendations and treatment intensity. The 
interventions included dietary counseling, daily text messages, and a cookbook with health guides. 
To support adherence to 8 cups water/d, the Water group received well-defined water messages

 through counseling and daily text messages, a water bottle, and a water pitcher with filters. The 
Control group received no specific advice on water consumption.
Main Outcome and Measures—Primary outcome was 6-month change in body mass index 
(BMI) z-score.
Results—All randomized participants completed the study. Both groups reported drinking ~2 
cups/d water at baseline. Self-reported change in water intake was greater in the Water Group 
compared to the Control Group (difference between groups, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.0 cups/d; 
P=0.03). The 6-month change in BMI z-score did not differ between groups (−0.0; 95% CI, −0.1 
to 0.1; P=0.88).
Conclusions and Relevance—Contrary to hypothesis, advice and behavioral supports to 
consume 8 cups water/d in the context of a weight-reducing diet did not affect body weight among 
overweight and obese adolescents. Despite intensive behavior supports, few achieved the 8 cups/d 
water target. Environmental interventions to reduce barriers to water consumption at school may 
be necessary in future research of feasibility and effectiveness to achieve the target of an 8-cup/d 
intake of water in adolescents.

INTRODUCTION
Adequate water intake is essential for health, but any benefit for weight management 
remains unclear. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals commonly recommend increasing 
water intake, typically to 8 cups/d, as part of a weight-reducing diet. Despite its widespread 
adoption, the evidence base is limited, with virtually no experimental data in the pediatric 
population 1.
The origin of the 8 cups of water/d recommendation is unclear 2. Adequate intake of total 
water for adolescents is 2.4–3.3L for boys and 2.1–2.3L for girls 3. The adequate intake was 
set at the median total water intake based on national survey data. However, dehydration is 
estimated in more than half of US children and adolescents 4 and almost one quarter report 
no intake of any plain water 5. The practicality of increasing habitual water intake to 8 
cups/d is unknown.
No trials to date have tested increasing water to 8 cups/d. Increased water intake was 
inversely associated with weight gain in a pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies 6 and 
associated with greater weight reduction in a post-hoc analysis of data from an 
interventional study 7. Cross-sectional studies show a positive association in children and 
adolescents 5, but not in adults 8. However, these studies are subject to residual confounding 
and reverse causation. In adults, trials of water preloads showed mixed results compared to 
no water preloads for weight loss 9,10. In children, trials that tested differences in advice to

 drink water 11 and a school-based intervention 12 did not result in significant weight loss 
compared to the control group.
Various mechanisms may plausibly relate increased water intake to weight loss. These 
include increased gastric distension 13,14, fullness 9,15,16, or energy expenditure via water-
induced thermogenesis 17,18; decreased hunger 9,16, energy intake 15, or solid food 
consumption from decreased thirst cues mistaken for hunger cues 19; reduced activation of 
adipose tissue RAS components associated with dehydration 20; displacement of calorie-
containing beverages 6,21,22; and improvements in diet quality 5,7,23.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of recommending consumption of 8 cups 
water/d on weight loss in adolescents with overweight or obesity during a 6-month weight-
reducing diet.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Design
We conducted a 6-month randomized, controlled parallel-group study comparing two weight 
loss interventions, comprising standard dietary recommendations either with (Water) or 
without (Control) additional advice and behavioral support to increase habitual water intake 
to 8 cups/d. We hypothesized that increasing water intake to 8 cups/d would decrease 6-
month change in BMI z-score (primary outcome) and other anthropometric outcomes. 
Participants were recruited from newspaper advertisements, internet listings, and pediatric 
primary care practices, with the study presented as an opportunity for weight loss. A multi-
step screening and enrollment process was used to confirm eligibility.
The institutional review board at Boston Children’s Hospital approved the protocol. 
Participants provided written informed assent and a parent provided written informed 
consent. Participants who completed the study received $120 as compensation for their time 
and effort. The study was conducted between February 2011 and June 2014.
Participants
Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with a BMI ≥85th percentile 24 were eligible for the study. 
Other inclusion criteria included access to a working cell phone, at least one parent willing 
and able to participate in the intervention with the participant, and medical clearance from a 
treating physician. Exclusion criteria were water intake of >4 cups/d (i.e., individuals for 
whom the intervention would likely produce relatively little change in habitual intake), BMI 
≥40 kg/m2, smokers, diagnosis of a major medical illness, and chronic use of medications 
that may affect study outcomes. To prevent contamination of random group assignments, 
members of the same family or household, or friends, classmates or co-workers who 
interacted with each other ≥1 time per week were not enrolled.
Master randomization assignments using a blocked randomization design stratified by sex 
and ethnicity/race (non-Hispanic white, other) with sequential randomization numbers, were 
prepared in advance by the study statistician. Individual group assignments were specified in 
a sequence of sealed envelopes, labeled with the same randomization numbers. The

 appropriate envelope was opened for each enrolled participant the day of the first in-person 
session with the dietitian.
Intervention
The two groups received similar weight-reducing interventions, comprising diets that were 
differentiated only with regard to specificity of recommendations for water consumption. 
The standardized weight-reducing intervention consisted of monthly individual nutrition 
education and behavioral counseling by a registered dietitian (alternating between in-person 
sessions and telephone counseling calls, 6 total contacts), and daily text messages. The 
standardized intervention was intentionally designed to be less intensive where any large 
reductions in body weight could potentially mask the effects of increasing water intake to 8 
cups/d. Well-defined key messages consistent with national dietary guidelines (USDA 
MyPyramid 25 and MyPlate 26 food guidance systems) included recommendations to eat 
ample vegetables, fruits, and legumes; whole rather than refined grains; and high-quality 
proteins at most meals and snacks. Additional messages focused on limiting intake of added 
fats and sugars, juices, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Participants were provided a 
cookbook with health guides and recipes written specifically for adolescents and a Corelle® 
plate with appropriate divisions to convey reasonable portion sizes and facilitate meal 
assembly. Telephone calls were conducted using a patient-centered counseling model 27,28 to 
encourage adherence. Daily text messages were sent using client-based messaging software 
(HipLink™, Semotus Solutions, Inc.) to reinforce key messages, foster adherence, and 
provide ongoing support with motivating and encouraging phrases. Text messages were sent 
on the hour between 4–7pm on weekdays and 9am–7pm on weekends to avoid school and 
sleeping hours. Physical activity advice consistent with current guidelines was the same in 
both groups 29,30.
Participants were masked to the specific aims of the study in order to maximize adherence to 
their group assignment. The Water group was counseled to increase water intake to 8 cups/d, 
“8×8” (eight 8-oz glasses of water/d). Water was defined as tap and plain bottled water. To 
support adherence, the Water group received well-defined water messages through 
counseling and daily text messages, a stainless steel water bottle, and a water pitcher with 
replacement filters. The Control group received no specific advice on water intake or 
altering beverage intake other than those as part of the standard weight-reducing diet 
described above. When asked, the dietitian advised that drinking plain water was the best 
way to satisfy thirst and instructed them to drink when thirsty.
Treatment Fidelity
Several strategies were implemented to maximize treatment fidelity. Scripts and education 
materials for presenting topics during the in-person sessions included well-defined messages 
for each diet. Guides for telephone counseling calls were designed to foster dietitian 
adherence to a patient-centered counseling model, with adequate flexibility for responding to 
the unique needs of each participant. Telephone calls were digitally recorded and a random 
selection (33%) was reviewed for quality control.

 Process Evaluation
Participant adherence was evaluated based on attendance at in-person sessions that included 
spot urines to measure hydration status, completion of telephone counseling calls, and self-
reported dietary and water intake. We also evaluated participant satisfaction with the 
intervention.
Diet and physical activity were assessed by 3 unannounced 24-hour recall interviews (2 
weekdays, 1 weekend day) at baseline and again at 6-months. The interviewer was masked 
to group assignment. Dietary data were collected using the Nutrition Data System for 
Research (NDSR) software versions 2010–2013, developed by the Nutrition Coordinating 
Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Final calculations were completed using 
NDSR version 2013. Physical activity data were collected using established methods 31,32 
and are presented as metabolic equivalents (METs) 33. At each in-person session, 
participants provided a spot urine sample that was immediately analyzed for specific gravity 
(MultiStix 10 SG reagent strips; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.). At the end of the 
study, participants responded to satisfaction questions related to the standard weight loss diet 
using 10-cm visual analog scales with appropriate verbal anchors. The Water group 
completed additional questions related to the “8×8” recommendation.
Outcomes
Outcomes were assessed after a 12-hour overnight fast at baseline and 6-months. Outcome 
assessors were masked to random group assignment. Data were managed using Research 
Electronic Data Capture 34.
BMI z-score and percentile were calculated using reference data for sex and age 24. Body 
weight and height were measured using a calibrated electronic scale and wall-mounted 
stadiometer, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. 
Waist and hip circumferences were measured according to established methods 35,36.
Statistical Analysis
In this study, the planned sample size of 30 per group, based on a previous trial 37, provided 
80% power to detect a difference between arms for 6-month change in weight (3.7kg) and 
BMI z-score (0.122). We randomized 38 participants (=2/3 of target) and stopped enrollment 
after 2.8y due to slow recruitment.
Data are presented as mean (95% CI) unless otherwise noted. All analyses followed the 
intention-to-treat principle. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups using 
the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. The primary 
outcome was 6-month change in BMI z-score. To adjust for variations in BMI based on sex 
and age of adolescents, BMI was transformed to BMI z-score (i.e. adjusting for sex and age 
based on reference data). The 6-month changes from baseline in outcomes were compared 
between groups using a general linear model. The findings of the primary outcome did not 
materially change with the inclusion of baseline covariates (water intake, BMI z-score, sex, 
age, height, income, race, energy intake, % calories from fat). Secondary outcomes were 
also analyzed with the inclusion of variance reducing baseline covariates (BMI z-score,

 water intake) and the findings did not materially change with the inclusion. We further tested 
covariates for potential effect modification (interaction). The null hypothesis was that the 6-
month change from baseline would not differ between diet groups. Relationships of BMI z-
score with water intake and urine specific gravity for changes over 6 months were calculated 
using Pearson correlations. SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all 
computations.
RESULTS
Recruitment and Retention
Over 100 adolescents attended an informational visit after initial telephone screening for 
eligibility. Of these, 42% reported drinking >4 cups of water/d and were excluded (Figure 
1). A total of 38 participants were randomized to a diet group. Baseline characteristics are 
presented in Table 1. There were no differences at baseline between groups except for 
annual household income and age. Study completion rate was 100% and all randomized 
participants were included in the primary analysis.
Process Measures
Completion of in-person sessions and telephone calls and receipt of daily text messages did 
not differ between groups. Participants attended 95% of in-person visits and received 89% of 
telephone counseling calls and 95% of text messages.
Compared to baseline, urine specific gravity decreased significantly at 6-months in the 
Water group [−0.007 (−0.012 to −0.002); P=0.012], with no change in the Control group 
[−0.001 (−0.007 to 0.004); P=0.59] (Table 2). However, at 6-months, no significant 
difference was observed with changes in urine specific gravity between diet groups [−0.006 
(−0.013 to 0.002); P=0.13].
Baseline water intake was ~2 cups/d in both groups. Reported change in water intake was 
greater in the Water group compared to the Control group [1.6 (0.2 to 3.0) cups/d; P=0.03]. 
At 6-months, the Water group reported 4.8 (3.8 to 5.9) cups of water/d and the Control group 
3.5 (2.6 to 4.4) cups/d. In the Water group, 1/19 subjects (~5%) reported drinking >8 cups 
water/d and 2/19 (~11%) ≥ 7.5 cups/d. One subject reported drinking ≥7.5cups/d in the 
Control group. No differences were reported between diet groups in energy and dietary 
intake whereas both groups reported similar changes while following the standard weight-
reducing diet (Table 2). No difference between groups was reported in physical activity.
Both groups were equally satisfied with the intervention where overall satisfaction was ~8 
on a 10-point scale (eTable 1). Specific to the Water group, participants reported a mean of 
~7 for the ease of following the “8×8” recommendation and usefulness of the water bottle, 
water pitcher, and daily water-specific text messages.
Outcomes
Outcomes are presented in Table 3. Changes in BMI z-score did not differ significantly 
between diet groups [−0.0 (−0.1 to 0.1); P=0.88], although both groups decreased from

 baseline by 0.1. Changes in other anthropometric measures also did not differ between 
groups. There were no significant interactions detected.
No significant correlation existed between change in BMI z-score and changes in water 
intake or urine specific gravity.
Challenges and Barriers to “8×8” Recommendation
Subjects in the Water group reported being comfortable drinking water in front of their 
immediate family, relatives, and friends. At school, although water was accessible, water 
fountains were reported to be inconveniently located (26%) and to provide unsafe drinking 
water (21%). Furthermore, 16% reported not being allowed to bring water to school and 
32% were not allowed to drink water in class. Outside of school or home, lack of convenient 
places to drink water from a fountain (47%) or refill a water bottle (37%) was also reported. 
Results are presented in eTable 2 and 3.
DISCUSSION
The present study evaluated two standardized 6-month interventions, comprising standard 
dietary recommendations for weight loss, either with or without additional advice and 
behavioral support to increase habitual water intake to 8 cups/d in adolescents with 
overweight or obesity. Contrary to the study hypothesis, advice and behavioral support to 
consume 8 cups water/d in the context of a weight-reducing diet did not affect BMI z-score 
among overweight and obese adolescents.
All randomized participants completed the study, although recruitment was less than 
expected. Based on the observed difference between groups and standard error, >6500 
participants/group would be required to demonstrate a significant finding in BMI z-score 
with 80% power. Thus, had we achieved our recruitment goal, we likely would not have 
detected a significant group effect.
A novel aspect of the study was the “8×8” recommendation, which has not been tested in 
previous trials. On average, water intake increased by 3 cups/d to a mean of 5 cups/d in the 
Water group. Although less than 8 cups/d, water intake increased 2.5 times from baseline 
and the two groups appeared well-differentiated with regards to water intake. Reported 
changes in water intake were consistent with changes in urine specific gravity. However, 
lack of adherence, based on self-report, to advice to increase habitual water intake to 8 
cups/d was the main study limitation. In addition to well-defined messages provided during 
the in-person sessions and telephone counseling calls, the study utilized several behavioral 
supports to foster adherence to advice to drink 8 cups water/d. Usefulness rating for the 
water bottle, water pitcher, and text messages were between 6 and 7 on a 10-point scale. 
Despite intensive efforts, the ease of the “8×8” recommendation was rated at 6.6 on a 10-
point scale, suggesting that increasing habitual water intake to 8 cups/d may be simple in 
concept, but difficult or impractical in reality, raising the issue of feasibility. Environmental 
barriers and challenges outside the home may have been key factors compromising 
adherence. Given these barriers, the observed increase in water intake may be at best what 
can be expected among adolescents.

 Almost one-third of the Water group reported not being able to drink water in class at 
school, presenting a significant barrier to adherence. Furthermore, ~40% reported lack of 
convenient places to drink water from a fountain or refill a water bottle outside of school or 
home. These barriers may have limited the ability of our participants to achieve the “8×8” 
recommendation. Access to drinking water often is compromised in schools due to older 
plumbing infrastructure and related cost implications and/or municipal water safety 
issues 38,39. These challenges may also be contributors to the high rate of dehydration 
among adolescents 4. Future studies testing advice to drink 8 cups/d water for weight loss 
will need to consider study designs that overcome the environmental barriers associated with 
the provision and/or accessibility of potable water, such as placement of ‘water jets’ in 
school cafeterias to increase access to drinking water 40.
Strengths of the present study include the randomized design, inclusion of a pediatric 
population, 100% completion rate, and masking of participants to the specific aims of the 
study. Additional strengths include the control for treatment intensity, a well differentiated 
water message with the same background standard weight-reducing intervention, and use of 
various behavioral supports to maximize differentiation and adherence. In addition to the 
suboptimal adherence to the “8×8” recommendation as discussed above, other study 
limitations include small sample size and reliance on self-report for dietary assessment, 
recognizing the well-documented potential for recall and social desirability biases.
In conclusion, the present study found that advice and behavioral supports to consume 8 
cups water/d in the context of a weight-reducing diet had no added benefits on body weight 
reduction among adolescents with overweight or obesity. Despite intensive behavioral 
supports, few achieved the 8 cups/d water target, likely due to environmental barriers. Future 
research to test feasibility and effectiveness may need to focus on environmental 
interventions – such as water provision at school – to achieve the target of 8 cups/d.

 KEY POINTS
Question
Are there differences in weight loss between two standardized weight-loss diets, either 
with or without additional advice and behavioral support to increase habitual water intake 
to 8 cups/d?
Findings
In this randomized controlled trial of 38 adolescents with overweight or obesity, the 6-
month change in BMI z-score did not differ significantly between groups. Increasing 
water intake to 8 cups/d may not be feasible without interventions focused on 
environmental barriers and challenges.
Meaning
Additional advice and behavioral supports to consume 8 cups water/d in the context of a 
weight-reducing diet did not affect body weight in adolescents.
