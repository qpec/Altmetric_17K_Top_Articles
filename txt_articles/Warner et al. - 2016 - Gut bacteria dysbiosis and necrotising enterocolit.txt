Summary
Background—Gut bacteria might predispose to or protect from necrotising enterocolitis, a 
severe illness linked to prematurity. In this observational prospective study we aimed to assess 
whether one or more bacterial taxa in the gut differ between infants who subsequently develop 
necrotising enterocolitis (cases) and those who do not (controls).
Methods—We enrolled very low birthweight (1500 g and lower) infants in the primary cohort (St 
Louis Children’s Hospital) between July 7, 2009, and Sept 16, 2013, and in the secondary cohorts

 (Kosair Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital at Oklahoma University) between Sept 12, 
2011 and May 25, 2013. We prospectively collected and then froze stool samples for all infants. 
Cases were defined as infants whose clinical courses were consistent with necrotising enterocolitis 
and whose radiographs fulfilled criteria for Bell’s stage 2 or 3 necrotising enterocolitis. Control 
infants (one to four per case; not fixed ratios) with similar gestational ages, birthweight, and birth 
dates were selected from the population after cases were identified. Using primers specific for 
bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we amplified and then pyrosequenced faecal DNA from stool samples. 
With use of Dirichlet multinomial analysis and mixed models to account for repeated measures, 
we identified host factors, including development of necrotising enterocolitis, associated with gut 
bacterial populations.
Findings—We studied 2492 stool samples from 122 infants in the primary cohort, of whom 28 
developed necrotising enterocolitis; 94 infants were used as controls. The microbial community 
structure in case stools differed significantly from those in control stools. These differences 
emerged only after the first month of age. In mixed models, the time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis 
interaction was positively associated with Gammaproteobacteria (p=0·0010) and negatively 
associated with strictly anaerobic bacteria, especially Negativicutes (p=0·0019). We studied 1094 
stool samples from 44 infants in the secondary cohorts. 18 infants developed necrotising 
enterocolitis (cases) and 26 were controls. After combining data from all cohorts (166 infants, 
3586 stools, 46 cases of necrotising enterocolitis), there were increased proportions of 
Gammaproteobacteria (p=0·0011) and lower proportions of both Negativicutes (p=0·0013) and the 
combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (p=0·0051) in infants who went on to develop necrotising 
enterocolitis compared with controls. These associations were strongest in both the primary cohort 
and the overall cohort for infants born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation.
Interpretation—A relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (ie, Gram-negative facultative 
bacilli) and relative paucity of strict anaerobic bacteria (especially Negativicutes) precede 
necrotising enterocolitis in very low birthweight infants. These data offer candidate targets for 
interventions to prevent necrotising enterocolitis, at least among infants born at less than 27 
weeks’ gestation.

Institute.
Introduction
Necrotising enterocolitis is a catastrophic necro-inflammatory injury to the intestines in very 
low birthweight infants. Its incidence (5–10% of very low birthweight infants), mortality 
(about 25%), and treatment (bowel resection for severe cases) have changed little in more 
than three decades.1 Necrotising enterocolitis does not occur in utero, and is positively 
associated with exposure to antibiotics2-4 and negatively associated with exposure to human 
milk5 and probiotics.6 These observations underlie the long-standing belief that necrotising 
enterocolitis and gut bacteria are causally associated.
Stool cultures cannot quantify individual fastidious bacteria and so culture-independent 
analyses have been used to study gut microbes in children at risk for necrotising 
enterocolitis. Improved technologies and databases have enabled direct sequencing and

 interpretation of bacterial DNA from stools, but researchers using these methods have 
reported either no correlation between bacteria and necrotising enterocolitis,7-9 incriminated 
disparate organisms such as Gram-negative bacilli,10-13 Actinobacteria,13 Clostridia11,12 and 
other Firmicutes,10 or suggested age-dependent differences between cases and controls.11 
Additionally, certain taxa (Propionibacteria,10 Bifidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes13) have 
been proposed as preventers of development of necrotising enterocolitis. However, these 
studies analysed sequences from a median of only three stools (IQR two to seven) of infants 
before they developed necrotising enterocolitis.
There are many sampling challenges encountered by investigators attempting to define 
causative or protective bacterial communities in necrotising enterocolitis. Necrotising 
enterocolitis occurs unpredictably throughout the first 2 months of age,14 a period during 
which gut bacteria assemble into consensus communities in children who do not develop 
necrotising enterocolitis (rapidly rising then slowly declining proportions of 
Gammaproteobacteria and increasing proportions of anaerobic bacteria) at rates that vary 
according to duration of gestation at birth. Also, despite this non-random choreographed 
progression, sudden population shifts are common.15 Moreover, the variable frequency of 
stool production within and between infants of this age results in non-uniformly timed 
sample sets before the onset of necrotising enterocolitis. Hence, dynamic gut bacterial 
communities and the widely varying frequency with which stool can be obtained necessitate 
studying many samples from many very low birthweight infants to determine if dysbiosis 
precedes, and therefore might cause, necrotising enterocolitis. Finally, the resulting data 
must undergo statistical testing that accounts for both the broad span of gestational ages at 
birth among at-risk infants, the extended risk of necrotising enterocolitis over the first 
several months of age, diverse clinical data such as antibiotic use and feeds, and repeated 
measures from the same individuals. It is likely that these challenges contributed to differing 
conclusions in previous studies, which were drawn on relatively few pre-event samples.
In this three-site prospective case-control study, we describe an intensive culture-
independent analysis of a large specimen set using a mixed model approach to control for 
confounding clinical variables from infants at risk for necrotising enterocolitis. We aimed to 
establish whether development of necrotising enterocolitis is associated with altered 
microbial content (dysbiosis).
Methods
Study design and participants
We used a prospective cohort design, within which we nested a case-control study. Our study 
population was formed of a primary cohort from St Louis Children’s Hospital (St Louis, 
MO, USA) and secondary cohorts from Children’s Hospital at Oklahoma University 
Medical Center (Oklahoma City, OK, USA) and Kosair Children’s Hospital (Louisville, KY, 
USA), hereafter termed the St Louis, Oklahoma City, and Louisville cohorts, respectively. 
Secondary cohorts were included in the initial study design to increase case numbers and to 
serve as validation cohorts. Each site’s institutional review board approved this study. 
Written informed consent was obtained from parents before enrolment.

 Study structure, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and specimen handling protocols used in 
the St Louis cohort are as described in previous studies.15,16 Briefly, all infants of 1500 g 
birthweight or lower who were expected to survive beyond 1 week and who were 
hospitalised in a neonatal intensive-care unit at the study sites were considered eligible for 
enrolment. We excluded from analysis infants with complex congenital heart disease or 
spontaneous intestinal perforation without radiographic evidence of necrotising 
enterocolitis17 unless it subsequently ensued.
Procedures
All stools produced by these infants were collected and refrigerated at 4°C before freezing at 
−80°C. Stool collection began on admission to the neonatal intensive-care units, with parents 
approached for consent as soon as possible. If consent was not obtained, collected samples 
were destroyed. All stools were collected by nurses and frozen by study staff before 
knowing which infants would develop necrotising enterocolitis.
Cases were defined as infants whose clinical courses were consistent with necrotising 
enterocolitis and whose radiographs fulfilled criteria (confirmed by a study radiologist) for 
Bell’s stage 2 or 3 necrotising enterocolitis.18 Controls (one to four per case; not fixed 
ratios) were selected after cases were identified and were chosen to correspond to cases from 
the same centre based on gestational age (plus and minus 1 week), birthweight (plus and 
minus 100 g), and birth date (details in appendix).
We analysed DNA extracted from all frozen stools from cases that had been collected up to 
and including the day before necrotising enterocolitis was diagnosed or 60 days of age, 
whichever occurred first. We analysed all frozen stools from controls up to age 30 days, and 
then every third stool thereafter, up to and including day of age 60 days. We sequenced V3 
to V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene on a Roche 454 platform, and classified reads using the 
Ribosomal Database Project Naive Bayesian Classifier version 2.5, training set 9. 
Bifidobacterial proportions were verified with quantitative PCR. Control stool sampling 
strategies and methods for sequencing all specimens and PCR quantification of 
Bifidobacteria are described in the appendix. Sequence and host data have been deposited in 
the NCBI dbGap (accession number phs000247.v5.p3) and BioProject (PRJNA46337).
Statistical analysis
For demographic and clinical features of case and control populations, we used the Student’s 
t test or the Mann-Whitney test to identify statistically significant differences in continuous 
variables, and the χ2 or Fisher’s exact test to identify differences in categorical variables. 
We used the generalised Wald-type test for Dirichlet multinomial distribution to determine if 
composite microbial community structure in stools pre-event differed from that in stools of 
controls.19 The four 15 day analysis intervals are detailed in the appendix and include 1–15, 
16–30, 31–45, and 46–60 days of age.
We then used mixed models accounting for repeated measures to determine if case or control 
status or other host variables (appendix) were associated with bacterial content in the serially 
collected stools. We compared Shannon diversity indices for bacterial content of stools in 
each analysis interval between cases and controls using mixed models, adjusting for

analyses we used SAS version 9.3 and R statistical software. We considered two-tailed p 
values of less than 0·05 as significant.

Results
We prospectively enrolled 972 infants (489, 276, and 207 infants from the three respective 
cohorts) over 4 years (primary cohort) or 2 years (secondary cohorts). The first participants 
were enrolled on July 7, 2009, in St Louis; Sept 12, 2011 in Oklahoma City; and Oct 3, 
2011, in Louisville. The last participants were enrolled in this study on Sept 16, 2013, in St 
Louis, May 25, 2013, in Oklahoma City, and May 20, 2013, in Louisville. 58 (6%) of 972 
infants developed necrotising enterocolitis; 21 (36%) of these infants died (appendix).
Infants born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation (n=368) developed necrotising enterocolitis 
more frequently (37 [10%] vs 19 [3%]; p=0·0002) and later (median age of occurrence 31 
days [IQR 23–49] vs 21 days [IQR 18–25]; p=0·003) than did those born after this 
gestational age (n=604).
We had sufficient pre-necrotising enterocolitis stools from 28, 13, and five infants (cases) 
from the St Louis, Oklahoma City, and Louisville cohorts, respectively, and compared these 
specimens to stools from 94, 20, and six infants (controls), from these respective cohorts. 
From the 166 infants in the three cohorts, we analysed DNA sequences from a total of 3586 
stools, with a median of 6078 (IQR 4748–7600) reads per specimen, and a mean of 466 
nucleotides per read.
The 28 cases in the primary (St Louis) cohort, compared with the 94 controls, were born 
after shorter gestations, weighed less at birth, had lower 5 min Apgar scores, were more 
frequently of black race, were more likely to die before discharge, and received more 
antibiotics and blood transfusions (table 1).
At the class level, Bacilli (largely Gram-positive cocci), Gammaproteobacteria (facultative 
Gram-negative bacilli), and Clostridia and Negativicutes (obligate anaerobes) accounted for 
92% of reads from case stools and 93% of reads from control stools (figure 1). Except for 
Clostridia, within each class the same three genera (or family if a read could not be assigned 
to a genus) predominated independent of case or control status (figure 2; appendix). 
Dirichlet multinomial comparisons showed statistically significant differences in composite 
community structure at analysis intervals three (31–45 days of age; p=0·0035) and four (46–
60 days of age; p=0·0001; figure 1; appendix), with samples from cases having greater 
proportions of Gammaproteobacteria and lower proportions of Clostridia and of 
Negativicutes than controls.

 To account for postmenstrual age influence on the kinetics of gut microbial community 
assembly,15 microbial content was examined separately for infants born before 27 weeks’ 
gestation or at or after 27 weeks’ (this demarcation was chosen because the median duration 
of gestation for the subjects in this cohort was 26·7 weeks). After this stratification, Dirichlet 
multinomial distributions differed significantly between cases and controls in analysis 
intervals three (31–45 days; p=0·0370) and four (46–60 days; p=0·0016), but only for infants 
born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation. Only one infant born at or after 27 weeks’ gestation 
developed necrotising enterocolitis after day 30, thereby precluding Dirichlet multinomial 
comparison in analysis intervals three and four (figure 1; appendix).
We used mixed model analysis taking into account the repeated measures from the same 
individuals for the entire observation period to identify clinical factors associated with 
microbial differences. Greater gestational age at birth was associated with higher proportions 
of Negativicutes (p=0·0079) and the combined Clostridia– Negativicutes class (p=0·0004), 
and lower proportions of Bacilli (p=0·0006). Vaginal birth was associated with lower 
proportions of Bacilli (p=0·0022). Greater antibiotic exposure, which corresponds to higher 
mean proportion of days within an analysis interval that an infant received an antibiotic, was 
associated with higher proportions of Bacilli (p=0·0212), and lower proportions of Clostridia 
(p=0·0142), and the combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (p=0·0009; table 2). Inotrope 
use, number of transfusions administered, and proportion of human milk feeds did not 
predict bacterial composition in the mixed models (table 2).
The mixed model also examined time-dependent factors associated with bacterial 
community progression. In both cases and controls, the fractions of Bacilli (p<0·0001) fell 
over time, whereas fractions increased of Gammaproteobacteria (p=0·0001), Clostridia 
(p=0·0003), and the combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (p<0·0001). However, and 
most importantly, there were significant time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis interaction factors 
for the progression over time of Gammaproteobacteria, Negativicutes, and the combined 
Negativicutes–Clostridia class. Relative to control stools, case stools showed significant 
increases in Gammaproteobacteria (p=0·0010) over time, and decreases in Negativicutes 
(p=0·0019) and the combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (p=0·0010). These time-by-
necrotising enterocolitis interaction effects in the mixed models were largely limited to 
infants born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation, with such cases being significantly associated 
with Gammaproteobacteria content (p=0·0066), and controls being associated with 
Negativicutes (p=0·0300), and the combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (p=0·0201). For 
infants born at or after 27 weeks’ gestation, the only significant interaction was for the 
combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class increasing over time among controls (p=0·0279; 
appendix).
Bifidobacteria, often used as probiotics, represented 1·2% of reads in case stools and 0·3% in 
control stools. PCR enumeration, done because of concerns that pyrosequencing might 
undercount Bifidobacteria,13 was in high agreement with pyrosequencing results 
(appendix).21
In a multivariate mixed model predicting the Shannon diversity index, adjusting for 
gestational age at birth, route of delivery, and birthweight, there was a significant time-by-

 necrotising-enterocolitis interaction indicating discordant trends in bacterial diversity in 
stools from cases versus controls (figure 3; p=0·0004 for interaction). In a model stratified 
by occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, diversity of bacterial content significantly 
increased in stools from controls (p<0·0001), but not from cases.
The bacterial classes and genera that predominated in St Louis cohort stools also 
predominated in the secondary cohorts (Louisville and Oklahoma City; appendix), and when 
all sites were amalgamated (appendix). In the secondary cohorts, stools were available for a 
median of only four cases per analysis interval (vs 14·5 cases per analysis interval in the 
primary cohort), preventing meaningful intrasite and intersite comparisons of case and 
control stools. However, when all cohorts were combined in a single mixed model, four 
associations became statistically significant: days on antibiotics versus diminishing 
Gammaproteobacteria content, gestational age at birth versus increasing Clostridia content, 
vaginal delivery versus increasing Clostridia content, and analysis interval during which 
samples were obtained versus increasing Negativicutes content. By contrast, only one 
association lost statistical significance: days on antibiotics versus diminishing proportion of 
Clostridia. Most importantly, the time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis interaction remained 
significantly associated with increased proportions of Gammaproteobacteria and decreased 
proportions of both Negativicutes and the combined Clostridia–Negativicutes class (table 2; 
appendix).
Discussion
The over-representation of Gram-negative facultative bacilli and potentially pathogenic 
organisms such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella and the under-
representation of obligate anaerobic bacteria, in particular Negativicutes and Clostridia, in 
infants’ guts before necrotising enterocolitis develops are consistent with the hypothesis that 
dysbiosis precedes this severe event. The time-by-necrotising-enterocolitis interaction, 
reflecting the different rates of change in bacterial composition over time in serially 
collected stools from cases and controls, best portrays this Gammaproteobacteria–
Clostridia–Negativicutes dysbiosis. This association is strongest in infants born at less than 
27 weeks’ gestation, and does not emerge until after the first month of age.
Our data show the need for exceptionally large patient and specimen sets to identify 
dysbiosis with confidence before a clinical event of interest. Indeed, the many ambiguities 
about microbial associations with necrotising enterocolitis might reflect the smaller scale of 
previous studies,7-13 a limitation that we designed our analysis of 1080 pre-event stools from 
46 children who developed necrotising enterocolitis to overcome.
Even though we identified microbial class signatures associated with necrotising 
enterocolitis before it occurred, conclusions are necessarily imperfect because we cannot 
discount the alternative hypothesis that dysbiosis reflects, rather than causes, an infant’s risk 
for this outcome. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence lend pathophysiological credence to 
the roles played by Gammaproteobacteria and by anaerobic bacteria. In animal models, 
Gram-negative bacteria elicit injury to the bowel that resembles necrotising enterocolitis,22 
and antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria diminish mucosal injury.23 Toll-like

 receptor 4, which binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, is implicated in cellular processes 
that could underlie necrotising enterocolitis.24,25 Anaerobic bacteria, responding to 
microbiota-accessible carbo hydrates,26 produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids, 
especially acetate, propionate, and butyrate.27 We hope our work stimulates mechanistic 
studies of necrotising enterocolitis using cellular and animal models, and moves the field 
beyond observational cohort studies and, ultimately, into microbiologically informed 
interventions. Relevant candidate bacterial drivers and attenuators of gut injury will be 
valuable reagents in these endeavours.
Human data indirectly corroborate our findings. Oral aminoglycosides, which reduce 
populations of Gram-negative gut bacteria28 but do not inhibit anaerobic bacteria, have 
conferred protection against necrotising enterocolitis in clinical studies in populations 
similar to those reported here.29 Bacterial gut community structure is intrinsically associated 
with degree of prematurity and age since birth,15 which are unequivocal epidemio-logical 
risk factors for necrotising enterocolitis. Clostridia become increasingly abundant as infants 
approach the equivalent of 36 weeks’ post-menstrual age, but the rate of community 
assembly varies inversely according to the degree of prematurity at birth, and putatively 
harmful Gammaproteobacteria predominate longer in the most premature infants.15 
Antibiotic use, a risk factor for necrotising enterocolitis, was significantly associated with 
lower proportions of potentially protective anaerobes, although unexpectedly also associated 
with lower proportions of Gammaproteobacteria. Our finding that case versus control status 
was associated with imbalanced proportions of Gammaproteobacteria and Clostridia–
Negativicutes is, therefore, consistent with the worldwide epidemiology of necrotising 
enterocolitis, at least among the most premature infants.
Our data also support the hypothesis that necrotising enterocolitis might be related to lack of 
gut bacterial diversity.30 However, because more than 90% of bacteria in the stool samples 
of cases and controls belonged to only four taxa, there are constraints on the degrees of 
freedom in which populations can differ at the class level. Hence, a change in fractional 
representation of a single taxon will produce a major change in bacterial diversity. 
Therefore, we cannot clearly attribute case or control status to changes in diversity in itself, 
versus changes in the ratios of the four taxa that define diversity in these non-complex 
communities. Also, we note that differences between cases and controls largely reflect 
maturation of diversity in control stool samples. That is, in controls, the decreasing 
proportions of Bacilli over time are counterbalanced by increasing proportions of anaerobes 
and stabilisation of Gammaproteobacteria but in infants that went on to develop necrotising 
enterocolitis bacterial populations do not show statistically convincing temporal changes in 
diversity. Our data also provide a microbiological explanation for the recent failure of the 
probiotic Bifidobacterium breve BBG-001 to prevent necrotising enterocolitis in a large and 
rigorous multicentre randomised controlled trial in the UK.31 Specifically, we found no 
evidence that Bifidobacteria were under-represented in the stools of infants who 
subsequently developed necrotising enterocolitis.
The associations between dysbiosis and necrotising enterocolitis among infants born at less 
than 27 weeks’ gestation and divergence of bacterial content between cases and controls 
only after the first month of age warrant comment. Incidence and case fatality rates from

 necrotising enterocolitis are highest in the most premature infants. Hence, the most apparent 
bacterial effect being identified in infants born at less than 27 weeks’ gestation is potentially 
quite meaningful for the subset of premature infants in whom this disorder is most 
consequential. However, the demarcation point of 27 weeks’ gestation, although providing a 
robust differentiation in microbial risk in this study, might not be applicable to all centres 
and should not be considered as a universally useful variable to assign risk. Notably, 
however, the delayed timing of these differences still permits a window to identify dysbiosis 
before necrotising enterocolitis occurs in the most premature infants, in whom this disorder 
has later onset than in less premature infants.14 Also, even though our data graphically 
present that microbial risk emerges after 30 days of age, we do not believe our findings yet 
support considering this day as a categorical boundary for seeking bacterial differences.
Our regression analysis should be considered as exploratory and not be used as a validated 
risk model. Nonetheless, our findings urge that future models of bacterial content and 
necrotising enterocolitis risk should address changes in proportions of Gammaproteobacteria 
and anaerobic bacterial populations, that children who are likeliest to benefit are those born 
most prematurely (<27 weeks), and that the interval of risk might not emerge until several 
weeks of age. Ultimately, microbiologically informed intervention studies will be needed to 
definitively establish the roles of specific bacterial populations in pre disposing to, or 
reducing the risk of, necrotising enterocolitis.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did PubMed and Medline searches before undertaking this study in 2009. We used 
the following keywords to identify papers of interest: “Gammaproteobacteria”, 
“microbiome”, “necrotising enterocolitis”, and “preterm birth”, with no date or language 
limitations. We identified only efforts to assess gut bacteria using gradient gel 
electrophoresis of amplified bacterial DNA and, occasionally, sequencing of selected 
bands excised from the gels. Our searches did not identify any studies that applied 
modern sequencing technology directly to stools to establish the role of bacterial 
populations in the development of necrotising enterocolitis.
During the assembly of our cohort, several groups reported data for gut microbial content 
before necrotising enterocolitis by sequencing bacterial DNA directly from stool. These 
studies produced conflicting data, probably because of the dynamic bacterial population 
content in this age group and the relatively few patients and samples in any single study. 
This problem is compounded by an inherently unstable gut bacterial population in this 
age group.
Added value of this study
We identified dysbiosis preceding necrotising enterocolitis through analysis of 10·7 
gigabases of DNA from 22 945 218 reads of 3586 stool samples from 166 infants in three 
US hospitals. This dysbiosis consists of over-representation of Gammaproteobacteria in 
stools of cases before necrotising enterocolitis develops, and under-representation of 
anaerobic bacteria, in particular Negativicutes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data might form the basis for informed discussion about management strategies of 
gut microbials in very low birthweight infants to avoid this catastrophic complication of 
preterm birth.

 Figure 1. Distribution of four major bacterial classes in composite community structure for each 
15 day analysis interval in the St Louis cohort (A) and broken down into children born at less 
than 27 weeks’ gestation (B) and at or greater than 27 weeks’ gestation (C) in this cohort
Bars show upper 95% CIs, which are symmetric around the means (lower bounds not 
shown). If a patient produced no samples within one of the 15 day intervals, no data were 
entered. If a patient produced more than one specimen within an interval, proportions were 
collapsed into composite values for that individual. For (C), one case was available for 
analysis intervals 3 and 4 so data for these intervals are not presented. Distributions are 
provided in 3D in the appendix. Dirichlet multinomial comparisons of class distribution (p 
values for case vs corresponding control comparisons) for each analysis interval for this 
cohort are provided in the appendix; significant p values are displayed in this figure.

 Figure 2. Predominant genera or families within Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes
Chart fractions represent the three most abundant genera (or families if a genus cannot be 
assigned) within Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes, among all reads generated by 
cohort, and by case or control status. Among these classes, Enterobacteriaceae is the only 
family identified. Colour code assignment for each pie fraction is provided beneath each 
class. Bacilli and Clostridia genera and families are presented in the appendix.

Data are coefficient (p value) for the primary (St Louis) cohort and for all cohorts combined. The appendix defines proportion of days on antibiotics, human milk, and time (defined as the analysis interval 
during which samples were obtained). Positive coefficients represent positive associations between host or clinical factors and bacterial content, except for the time-by-necrotising enterocolitis interaction, 
for which positive values represent an association between bacterial content and case status. Transfusions and inotropic support were included and found to have no effect.
*Gestational age corresponds to weeks of gestation completed at time of birth.
†The time-by-necrotising enterocolitis interaction term indicates the difference in rate of change in bacteria between cases and controls over time; the appendix provides more information. The appendix 
provides 95% CIs.
