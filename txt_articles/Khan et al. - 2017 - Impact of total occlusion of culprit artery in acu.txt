Aims
Total occlusion (TO) of the culprit artery usually presents with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A subset of pa-
tients with TO present as non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) without classic ST-elevation
on the electrocardiogram. This may lead to delay in identification of these patients and further management. We
performed a meta-analysis to estimate the difference in outcomes between totally occluded and non-occluded
culprit arteries in patients with NSTEMI.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Our literature search yielded seven studies with 40 777 patients. The outcomes assessed were clinical presentation
(Killip class), left ventricular ejection fraction, time to angiography, major cardiac adverse events (MACE) and all-
cause mortality. The generic inverse or Mantel–Haenszel method was used to pool relevant outcomes and the
mean difference (MD) or relative risk (RR) was calculated. A total of 10 415 (25.5%) patients had an occluded cul-
prit artery with a predominant infero-lateral distribution (40% right coronary and 33% left circumflex artery).
There was an increased risk of both MACE (short-term RR: 1.41; CI: 1.17, 1.70; P = 0.0003; I2 = 26%; medium- to
long-term RR: 1.32; CI: 1.11, 1.56; P = 0.001; I2 = 25%) and all-cause mortality (short-term RR: 1.67; CI: 1.31, 2.13;
P < 0.0001; I2 = 41%; medium to long-term RR: 1.42; CI: 1.08, 1.86; P = 0.01; I2 = 32%) with TO of the culprit artery.

Conclusion
Our meta-analysis suggests that patients with NSTEMI who demonstrate a totally occluded culprit vessel on coron-
ary angiography are at higher risk of mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Better risk stratification tools are
needed to identify such high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients to facilitate earlier revascularization and poten-
tially to improve outcomes.

Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of mortality and
morbidity.1–3 The spectrum of ACS includes ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. The electrocardiogram
(ECG) plays an important role in identifying and differentiating STEMI
from NSTEMI. ST-elevation on an ECG helps in recognition of total

occlusion (TO) of the culprit artery, and its presence is an indication
for immediate coronary angiography and revascularization. However,
in clinical practice, a subset of patients found to have TO of the culprit
artery based on invasive coronary angiography, present as NSTEMI
with elevated biomarkers and without classic ST-elevation on routine
ECG.4,5 This is more commonly reported in patients presenting with
either right coronary artery or left circumflex artery involvement.6–12
Current clinical practice guidelines recommend an emergent invasive
strategy (door-to-balloon time within 90min) for patients with STEMI
based on clinical and ECG findings.13 However, due to lack of classic
ECG findings, these NSTEMI patients, despite TO of the culprit artery
may be missed leading to either delay in or no revascularization.14 We
performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies
to estimate the difference in clinical outcomes of patients with
NSTEMI and TO compared with NSTEMI and non-TO (Central Figure).
Methods
Search strategy, study eligibility, and data
extraction
We followed reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines for this systematic review.15 Two authors (A.R.K.,
H.G.) developed the search strategy with help of a librarian (M.A.).
MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Elsevier) were searched from database in-
ception to 14 September 2016. The initial keywords along with MeSH or
Emtree terms used included: non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome,
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI, NSTE-ACS, acute TO,
occluded coronary artery, acute coronary occlusion, mortality, outcomes,
in-hospital mortality, and long-term mortality. References of the studies
found were also assessed for other potential studies. Two authors (A.T.,
C.B.) independently reviewed titles and abstracts of all studies and selected
studies as per our pre-defined eligibility criteria. There was no restriction
of language or inclusion of published abstracts in our analysis. The studies,
which fulfilled the eligibility criteria were those which compared clinical
characteristics and outcomes of patients who present with NSTEMI and
have either, totally occluded vs. non-occluded or partially occluded culprit
artery. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Two authors
(A.R.K., H.G.) extracted data from the selected studies independent of
each other. Extracted data included characteristics of study population,
associated co-morbid diseases, and relevant outcomes.
Outcomes of interest
The clinical outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and major car-
diac adverse events (MACE). The definition of MACE followed the out-
come as defined in each study. The clinical outcomes measured were
divided as short-term (in-hospital or 30-day) or medium to long-term (6–
12months). Other parameters measured at presentation which may
have an effect on initial management strategy and subsequent outcomes
were: clinical features as measured by the Killip class, left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF) as measures of severity of presentation and time to
angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Statistical analysis
The data were reported as either mean± standard deviation or percent-
age. The difference between the groups was calculated by Fisher’s exact or
v2 test where appropriate. Adjusted relative risk (RR) or hazards ratio
(HR) reported by individual studies were used in the analyses. Relative risk
was calculated from dichotomous outcomes when no adjusted outcomes
were reported. A cumulative RR was calculated by pooling the RR or HR
reported from the studies for all-cause mortality and MACE separately.
The inverse-variance method was used to pool the effect-estimate in a
fixed or random-effects model based on the associated heterogeneity. We
pooled RR and HR together because they may be regarded as similar
measures of association if the risk of the event does not vary greatly over
time.16 To attenuate the change in risk over time, we calculated mortality
and MACE at two time points (in-hospital/30 day and 6–12months).
Subgroup analysis was also performed to find any difference between the
two measures of association (RR and HR). Weighted mean difference
(MD) was calculated to find the difference between LVEF between the
two groups. The Mantel–Haenszel method was used to pool the differ-
ence in clinical presentation (measured by Killip class) between the two
groups. Sensitivity analysis was also performed with one-study removal
analysis to assess the role of individual studies on the effect-estimate.
The associated heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 statistic.
Publication bias was not assessed as there were only a small number of
studies (<10). All analyses were conducted using the statistical software
Review Manager (v5.2) and Comprehensive meta-analysis (version 3).
Quality assessment
Two authors (A.B.A., A.R.K.) via Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) as-
sessed the methodological quality of the included cohort studies. This
scale involves evaluation based on three areas; selection of the study
groups, comparability among groups, and the assessment of outcome be-
tween the groups.17 The scale assigns a maximum of 4 points for selec-
tion, 2 points for comparability, and 3 points for exposure/outcome
assessment. Studies with>7 points were considered of high quality and
studies with<5 points were considered low quality.
The overall evidence was then evaluated using the Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
approach.18 This approach evaluates the evidence based on the methodo-
logical quality, directness of evidence, precision of estimate, heterogeneity,
publication bias, effect size, and plausible explanation of the confounding or
bias. Using this framework, the quality of evidence is graded on the extent
the calculated effect-estimate may be close to the true effect-estimate.
Results
Identification of studies
Seven studies6–12 were included in the study out of 277 publications
identified from the literature search (see Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S1). All the studies were observational in nature; four
were from cardiovascular registries,6,9,10,12 two were post hoc ana-
lyses7,11 of randomized trials and one was a prospective study.8 In all
the studies, the patient cohort was representative of the general
population with both the TO and non-TO groups derived from the
same population. The groups were comparable and effect estimate
was adjusted for confounders in the individual analyses. The follow-
up was adequate and the outcomes were not present in any of the
studies prior to start of the study. Overall, the observational studies
included in the analysis had good methodological quality with
NOS score >
_7 (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).
Supplementary material online, Table S2 summarizes the characteris-
tics of the studies included in the analysis.
Study population
A total of 40 777 patients were included in the analysis, of whom
10 415 (25.5%) patients had TO of the culprit artery while 30 362

(74.5%) had non-occluded vessels. Most of the patients included in
the studies were male with an average age of 63 years. The study
population was comparable in terms of age, sex, and other co-
morbidities in all studies except in the study by Dixon and colleagues
in which the patients with TO were younger compared with the
non-TO group6 (see Supplementary material online, Table S3).
The culprit artery was identified and defined in six studies based
primarily on angiographic findings,7–12 and in one study based on the
first lesion attempted.6 In three studies, ECG and echocardiogram
also supported angiography in assessment of the culprit artery.9,10,12
The angiographic assessment and ascertainment of the culprit artery
was done by the treating physician and was validated in two studies:
either by an independent core lab11 or by two other experienced
cardiologists who were blinded to the clinical presentation.8
There was difference in anatomical distribution of the culprit ar-
tery between the TO and non-TO group; the right coronary artery
(TO: 40%, non-TO: 27%, P <0.0001) was the most commonly
involved culprit vessel in the TO group followed by left circumflex ar-
tery (TO: 32%, non-TO: 28%, P <0.0001) and left anterior descending
artery (TO: 28%, non-TO: 44%, P <0.0001) (see Supplementary ma-
terial online, Tables S3 and S4).
Presenting features
Both groups were compared in terms of high-risk clinical features
(Killip class III/IV), changes in ECG and left ventricular systolic function
(LVEF) at the time of presentation. Five studies7–10,12 reported the
Killip class at presentation. Our analysis showed no difference in Killip
class III/IV (RR: 1.13, CI: 0.95, 1.35, P = 0.16; I2 = 19%) at the time of
presentation between the two groups (Figure 1, upper panel).
There was lack of classic ST-elevation on ECG of these patients;
however other ECG changes were reported. Only four stud-
ies7,9,11,12 reported the changes in ECG at the time of presentation.
The ECG changes described were T wave inversion, ST-depression,
and presence of Q waves in more than two contiguous leads. In the
study by Warren et al.,11 they found an increased incidence of ST-de-
pression>
_1 mm in patients with TO (P = 0.0007) while Wang et al.7
found similar incidence of ST-depression>
_1 mm in patients with TO
and non-TO (P = 0.36). However, Wang et al. did find an increased in-
cidence of Q waves in patients with TO (P = 0.0004).
Six studies,7–10,11,12 reported myocardial injury at the time of presen-
tation as measured by biomarker elevation [creatine kinase MB fraction
(CK-MB), troponin-I, or troponin-T levels]. There was significant vari-
ability in the levels of CK-MB and troponin as different units were used
to measure them and they were measured at different time-points in
the individual studies, hence the results were not pooled. However,
three studies reported statistically significant differences between the
two groups, with increased biomarker levels found in patients with TO.
Six studies evaluated LVEF in the analysis, out of which four stud-
ies8,10–12 reported mean LVEF at presentation and two studies7,9 re-
ported the percentage of patients with LV dysfunction in patients
with occluded arteries and non-occluded arteries. A meta-analysis of
the four studies which reported LVEF suggested that the LV function
was worse in patients who had TO (MD -1.95, CI: -3.18, -0.72,
P = 0.002; I2 = 68%) (Figure 1, lower panel). This was limited by sub-
stantial heterogeneity between the studies. Out of the two studies
which reported the percentage of patients with LV dysfunction, one
reported worse LV function7 in patients with TO and one study re-
ported no difference between TO and non-TO groups.9

Time to angiography or percutaneous
coronary intervention
Six studies7–12 reported time to angiography or PCI of which three
studies reported time from hospital arrival to angiography,7,8,11 two
reported time from hospital arrival to PCI10,12 and one reported time
from symptom onset to PCI.9 Time as a factor does not have normal
distribution; hence the studies were not pooled to evaluate the differ-
ence in time to angiography. However, in all the studies the mean
time to angiography or PCI was more than 24h (TO: 31.3 h; non-TO:
34.2h). In only one study, angiography/PCI was done early (within
6 h) in both the groups. There was no significant difference in the
time to angiography in the individual studies.
Only two studies8,11 reported the presence or absence of collat-
erals, which were found to be increased in patients who present with
TO. There was no difference in rates of revascularization between the
two groups [TO: 1875/2226 (84.2%); non-TO: 3409/4079 (83.5%)]
(P= 0.49) among the studies that reported revascularization rates.
Major cardiac adverse events
Individual studies defined MACE differently. Three studies9–11 defined
MACE as death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or target vessel
revascularization. MACE was calculated in one study from the re-
ported incidence of death, MI, and target vessel revascularization.12
One study8 included admission for unstable angina along with death
and re-infarction in the definition of MACE, and one study7 included
death and non-fatal MI as MACE. A total of six studies7–9,11,12 re-
ported MACE, with five studies7–9,11,12 reporting both short- and me-
dium- to long-term MACE, while one study10 reported short-term
events only.
Our analysis suggested an increased risk of MACE in the short-
term with TO of the culprit artery (RR: 1.41; CI: 1.17, 1.70;
P = 0.0003; I2 = 26%) with mild heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis
showed the increased risk of short-term MACE persisted in both
measures of association (HR: 1.34; CI: 1.04, 1.74; P = 0.02; I2 = 29%
and RR: 1.49; CI: 1.07, 2.09; P = 0.02; I2 = 45%) (Figure 2). Sensitivity
analysis performed with the one-study removal analysis showed
minor variability in the pooled effect-estimate (RR: 1.35 to 1.52; CI:
1.05 to 1.27, 1.67 to 1.82).
In the medium- to long-term, the analysis demonstrated an
increased incidence of MACE events with TO of the culprit artery
(RR: 1.32; CI: 1.11, 1.56; P = 0.001; I2 = 25%) associated with mild
heterogeneity (Figure 3). Subgroup analysis also demonstrated an
increased risk of short-term MACE with the reported effect estimate
of HR (HR: 1.42; CI: 1.04, 1.93; P = 0.03; I2 = 55%) and a trend to-
wards increased risk of short-term MACE with the reported effect
estimate of RR (RR: 1.23; CI: 0.98, 1.53; P = 0.07; I2 = 0%) (Figure 3).
Sensitivity analysis showed only minor changes with the one-study re-
moval analysis (RR: 1.22 to 1.36; CI: 1.03 to 1.15, 1.45 to 1.68).
All-cause mortality
Seven studies6–12 reported all-cause mortality out of which one study
reported short-term mortality only6; one study reported medium- to
long-term mortality only10; and five studies reported both short-
term and medium- to long-term mortality.7–9,11,12 Overall, six studies
reported short-term mortality6–8,11,12 and six studies reported me-
dium to long-term mortality.7–12
Our meta-analysis showed increased short-term mortality with TO
of the culprit artery with moderate heterogeneity (RR: 1.67; CI: 1.31,
2.13; P< 0.0001; I2= 41%). Subgroup analysis showed a difference be-
tween the two subgroups (HR: 1.10; CI: 0.55, 2.20; P= 0.78; I2= 42%
and RR: 1.83; CI: 1.49, 2.25; P< 0.00001; I2= 26%) (Figure 4). Sensitivity
analysis showed no variability in the pooled effect-estimate (RR: 1.70 to
1.79; CI: 1.30 to 1.54, 2.00 to 2.23) with the one-study removal analysis.
Similarly, our meta-analysis showed increased risk of medium-
to long-term mortality with TO of the culprit artery (RR: 1.42; CI: 1.08,
1.86; P= 0.01; I2= 32%) with moderate associated heterogeneity
(Figure 5). Subgroup analysis showed a difference between the two sub-
groups (HR: 1.65; CI: 1.20, 2.26; P= 0.002; I2= 21% and RR: 1.08; CI:
0.76, 1.54; P= 0.65; I2= 0%) (Figure 5). Sensitivity analysis done showed
that there was some variability in the pooled effect-estimate (RR: 1.29 to
1.59; CI: 0.93 to 1.21, 1.69 to 2.08) with the one-study removal analysis.

Discussion
The results of our meta-analysis suggest that NSTEMI patients who
present with TO may represent a higher risk group as they may suffer
from impaired LV function and increased risk of both short-term and
medium- to long-term MACE and all-cause mortality. Despite the
increased risk of mortality or MACE, we did not find any significant
difference in high-risk clinical features (Killip class III/IV) between the
two groups at the time of presentation, perhaps because the majority
of patients included were all presenting with their first MI. Although,
we did not pool the differences in biomarker level because of the
associated variability as discussed above, the qualitative analysis sug-
gested that there may be an increased burden of myocardial injury in
the patients with TO. This lack of high-risk clinical features resulted in
no difference in time to angiography or PCI between the two groups.
Moreover, both the groups were out of the early invasive window
period at the time angiography was performed.19,20
Prior studies have shown that outcomes of patients with TO with-
out ST-elevation are inferior to even STEMI patients historically,
who present with TO but have characteristic electrocardiographic
changes leading to timely revascularization.14,21 Although the exact
reasons for the absence of characteristic ECG changes cannot be elu-
cidated by our analysis, there may be several possibilities. First, the
ECG has decreased sensitivity to show changes of TO in the infero-
lateral distribution. It is quite likely that this group of NSTEMI patients
may really represent a subset of STEMI patients, not recognized ef-
fectively by the 12-lead ECG screen. Second, there is a possibility
that transient ST-elevation may be missed by the routine 12-lead
ECG monitoring in patients who have an occlusive thrombus, which
resolves by spontaneous recanalization or after medical therapy. In
such patients, resolution of the ST-segment elevation would correl-
ate with clinical reperfusion and improvement in TIMI flow.22 In our
analysis, all the included patients demonstrated TO with TIMI 0-1
flow which suggests that transient ST-elevation with spontaneous
reperfusion was less likely to have occurred. Third, there is a possibil-
ity of a slowly developing occlusive thrombus along with adequate
collateral flow leading to only subendocardial ischaemia as opposed
to transmural infarction. However, except for one study,8 none of
the other studies reported associated collateral flow, which may
therefore suggest acute occlusion in the majority of patients included
in our study. In the one study, that reported collateral flow, it was
found in only 18% patients with TO.8 In addition, the presence of a
chronic TO would not lead to the typical ‘rise and fall’ pattern of bio-
marker release and myocardial injury as found in the included studies.
Finally, in some of the included studies, patients with prior MI, multi-
vessel disease and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery were
excluded which would decrease the likelihood of inadvertent inclu-
sion of patients with chronic TOs.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
and meta-analysis to evaluate outcomes in patients with TO of the
presumed culprit artery, who present without typical ST-elevation.
Our study has several potential clinical implications. Patients present-
ing with NSTEMI who have an occluded culprit vessel on coronary
angiography represent a subset of ACS whose identification based on
clinical and electrocardiographic criteria remains challenging. Current
clinical practice guidelines recommend an emergent invasive strategy
(within 2 h) for patients with either hemodynamic instability or fea-
tures of ongoing ischemia and an early invasive strategy (within 24h)
for high-risk patients with GRACE risk score> 140, temporal change
in troponins, dynamic ST-changes, or prior coronary revasculariza-
tion.19,20,23,24 Although, patients with TO of the culprit artery would
likely benefit from an emergent invasive approach; the absence of
high-risk features and lack of characteristic ECG changes excludes
them from such an approach. There was a mean delay of more than
24 h for an invasive procedure in almost all the included studies in
our analysis. To be able to identify these patients early, awareness
about these patients will be helpful. One of the most important
modalities to help identify these patients may be ECG changes espe-
cially in the infero-lateral distribution involving the left circumflex ar-
tery/right coronary artery distribution. Although not evaluated in the
studies included in our analysis, some ECG changes which have been
reported to suggest TO, such as the presence of ST-depression in
the precordial leads, especially V1–V3, may be suggestive of an occlu-
sive thrombus compared with similar changes in the lateral precordial

leads for the involvement of the left circumflex artery.5 Also employ-
ing tools such as extreme lateral leads V7–V8 or V4R25 and body sur-
face mapping potentials26 would be helpful, but modestly so along
with repeated ECGs in order not to miss any dynamic or transient
ECG changes. In addition, point-of-care echocardiography with
speckle tracking performed in a protocol-based manner may aid in
the early identification of these patients who are at a high-risk for ad-
verse outcomes.27 It may be argued that in the absence of a reliable
non-invasive modality to identify these patients and given the high in-
cidence of TO in patients who present with NSTEMI, it would be lo-
gical to perform early angiography, especially in patients who present
with infero-lateral ischaemia.
Our study has several limitations. The overall quality of evidence
was low because of the risk of bias due to the observational design of
the included studies, inconsistency of the results between the sub-
groups, indirectness of the results, confounding, and associated het-
erogeneity found in our meta-analysis. Furthermore, we were unable
to assess for publication bias because of the limited number of studies
in our analysis. The observational design in addition does not allow
establishment of causation, and therefore our analysis should be con-
sidered as hypothesis generating. In addition to the design of the
included studies, the evidence was affected by the presence of
between-study heterogeneity. The results may have been affected by
the differences in the baseline clinical characteristics of the patients

included in the individual studies, infarct size depending on the myo-
cardium at risk, and the use of anti-platelet or anti-coagulant agents at
presentation, which contribute to the variability in the results.
However, this heterogeneity underscores the differences in the pa-
tient population who may present with TO and highlights the need
to identify high-risk sub-groups. In addition, the presence of un-
adjusted outcomes may also have affected the results and contrib-
uted to the heterogeneity encountered in our analysis. Another
limitation was the difficulty in assessment of the acuteness of the oc-
clusion of the culprit artery. In the included studies, clinical profile,
associated comorbid diseases, echocardiographic parameters, and
the morphology of the lesion were used to determine the culprit ves-
sel and the acuteness of the occlusion by the treating interventional
cardiologist during angiography—as is customary in routine clinical
practice. There was independent validation of the angiographic find-
ings in only two studies.8,11 The lack of collateral flow would also be
suggestive of an acute occlusion; however, the presence or absence
of collateral flow was not known for most of the included studies.
Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that patients with NSTEMI who demonstrate
TO of culprit vessel on coronary angiography represent a specific
subset of ACS and are at higher risk of mortality and major adverse
cardiac events. Better risk stratification tools are needed to identify
such high-risk ACS patients to facilitate earlier revascularization and
potentially to improve outcomes.
