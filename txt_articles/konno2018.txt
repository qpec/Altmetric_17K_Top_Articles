The effectiveness of HPV vaccine against HSIL+ (pathologically diagnosed CIN2+) in the first cohort in
Japan was investigated in 22,743 women aged 20 to 29 years (parts of national cervical cancer screening
program of FY [fiscal year] 2015, the Japan Cancer Society). Vaccinated women had a statistically signif-
icant 69% lower risk of HSIL+ as compared to the unvaccinated women; the crude relative risk estimate
was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11–0.83; p-value = 0.013) by normal approximation and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.08–0.80;
p-value = 0.009) by the exact Poisson regression. The effect of age was not significant (chisq = 7.7
(df = 9), p-value = 0.569) and the estimate of relative risk remained essentially intact after adjustment
for age. This study brings scientific evidence on the effectiveness of HPV vaccine on development of
cervical high grade lesions.

In
Japanese
women
aged
15–39 years,
the
estimated
age-standardised incidence rate for cervical cancer reaches 12.9
per 105 person-years, the double of that in the US (6.7) [1]. The
mortality rate is also higher (1.5 per 105 person-years in Japan;
1.0 in the US) [1]. Incidence rates for cervical cancer have been
increasing since the mid-1990s, especially in the 15–39 age-
group (APC [annual percent change] of 4.4% between 1994 and
2011), while mortality rates are following the same trend (APC of
1.9% between 1994 and 2014) [2]. The low cancer screening
participation rate, especially among the young age group [3]
(6% among the 20–24 years old and 21% in the 25–34 years) along
with recent behavioral changes among young Japanese women
such as decreasing age at sexual debut and increasing smoking
rates [2], explain these worrying trends and motivate a need for
action, in particular by implementing primary prevention of
cervical cancer through vaccination.
In Japan, a National Immunization Program (NIP) for adolescent
girls (12–16 years old, clinic-based immunization, not school-
based) was introduced in April 2013, following an interim program
financed by the municipalities’ budget from 2010. Bivalent HPV
vaccine and quadrivalent HPV vaccine were licensed in October
2009 and in July 2011, respectively. Either vaccine was chosen by
girls and parents after informed consents. Since June 14th 2013,
the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has
suspended proactive recommendation for the HPV vaccination
program based on sensational media reports although without
any scientific evidence or any prior accurate medical investigation
before suspension. Currently, HPV vaccines are used minimally in
clinics settings with a coverage of 1%, reported from MHLW
(2017) [4].
The first cohort of adolescent girls vaccinated at age of 16 years
(birth year 1994), reached the Japanese screening target age of 20
in fiscal year (FY) 2014. Since cervical cancer occurs in adults, the
effectiveness of vaccine can be evaluated through the population-
based screening program, after the subjects have reached adult-
hood. In this study (data of the cervical screening in FY 2015),
HPV vaccination of women aged 20 and 21 had been subsidized
by municipalities’ budget in principle, at the period of FY
2010–2013, and women aged 23 and older had not been subsi-
dized, consequently only a small fraction of them was vaccinated
but at their own expense.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
HPV vaccine against the high grade precursor lesions of cervical
cancer (HSIL+) in a young adult female population, when 5 years
elapsed after vaccine inoculations. Cervical cancer screening in
Japan is, in principle, conducted as a population-based program
by local governments, based on the national guidelines of the
MHLW. The methods of screening are developed in the national

 guidelines, it includes an interview prior to an examination with
cytology; the target age is 20 years old or over (no upper limit of
age) and the interval is biennial. Each municipality provides invita-
tion cards or municipal administration letter including information
on screening to the targeted women identified through the Resi-
dent registry, and a list of participating gynecologists of the pro-
gram. However, there is no linkage of the screening registry with
other registries, such as cancer registry or vaccine registry, and
those are independent between municipalities [2]. The Japan Can-
cer Society has 46 branches among the 47 prefectures nationwide,
and is undertaking cancer screening from the municipalities. A
third of the numbers of total cervical cancer screening of the
municipalities by local governments is carried out by the Japan
Cancer Society. Some branches collect the data including the
results of the screening (cytology and histology results), the grade
of cervical lesions, the cancer stage, and methods of treatment. In
this study, we collected the data from 16 branches. In those
branches at the time of the data collection, information on history
of HPV vaccination was self-reported. The screening results were
matched with the history of HPV vaccination. Samples of cervical
cells obtained during the population-based screening by cytology,
(and triage of ASC-US by HPV testing) were used; the women with
abnormal cytology (�LSIL or ASC-US with a positive HPV test) were
referred to colposcopy for histology if necessary. Based on the
results of the cervical cancer screening from the Japan Cancer Soci-
ety of 22,743 women aged 20 to 29 years, within the FY 2015
national screening program, and information on their HPV vaccina-
tion status, we estimated the risk of developing pathological HSIL+
associated with HPV vaccination.
Among these 22,743 women, 1969 (8.7%) were vaccinated.
Those aged 20 (n = 1325), 21 (2470), 22 (1063), 23 (1736), 24
(1599), 25 (2809), 26 (2765), 27 (2325), 28 (3728), and 29 (2923)
years were vaccinated in 24.8%, 38.9%, 9.5%, 7.6%, 4.3%, 2.3%,
2.7%, 3.0%, 2.5%, 2.6% (irrespective of doses), respectively. Only 4
cases of HSIL+ lesions were detected in the vaccinated group
(0.20%) as compared to 138 cases (0.66%) in the unvaccinated
group. Vaccinated women had a statistically significant 69% lower
risk of developing pathological HSIL+ as compared to the unvacci-
nated women; the crude relative risk estimate was 0.31 (95% CI:
0.11–0.83; p-value = 0.013) by normal approximation and 0.31
(95% CI: 0.08–0.80; p-value = 0.009) by the exact Poisson regres-
sion. The effect of age was not significant (chisq = 7.7 (df = 9), p-v
alue = 0.569) and the estimate of relative risk remained essentially
intact after adjustment for age. Generally, effectiveness of HPV vac-
cine reduced HSIL+ significantly. Because the coverage (numbers)
of cervical cancer screening in those younger women was very
low, analysis on stratification by each age cohort was not possible.
Fig. 1 compares HSIL+ rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated
women in the 20–24 and 25–29 years old age groups separately
(see. Fig. 1).
There is an important limitation in epidemiological study (also
including this study) in Japan. National data surveillance is imma-
ture and is not organized systematically as a developed public
health program [2]. Unlike in Australia, the UK, Nordic countries,
Canada, among others, Japan has no monitoring system for screen-
ing nor vaccination registry. The screening coverage among
women younger than 30 years old was estimated 20% [4]. The Japa-
nese female population aged 20 to 29 years old is about 6 million.
But the real number of examinees is not grasped by the national
government, because the social health insurance number system
(called ‘‘My number” in Japan) cannot be used for linking different
public health-related information. It is speculated that a certain
number of young women are screened for cervical cancer at the
time of gynecologic examination, or outside the invitation from
municipalities in an opportunistic fashion. In this study, we col-
lected the matched data of the results of cervical biopsy and the
history
of
vaccination
from
22,743
women
on
behalf
of
population-based screening, this is the largest study ever in Japan.
Thus, using data from the Japan Cancer Society is the only way to
obtain nationwide data to evaluate the effectiveness of HPV vacci-
nation at the population level. Recent publications from Japan
based on a limited sample size, and on cytology results solely,
without any colposcopy and biopsy confirmation (i.e. with a higher
positivity rate of cytology for ASC-US as compared to that of HSIL),
reported a consistent efficacy of HPV vaccination on abnormal
cytology results [5–6].
It is crucial that the government and academia give a strong
statement on the effectiveness and safety of the HPV vaccine based
on scientific evidence and put in place an epidemiological monitor-
ing system [7–9]. The current results bring this scientific evidence
to the Japanese government for urgently reconsidering resuming
proactive recommendation of HPV vaccination before a growing
number of young women suffer or die from cervical cancer [10].
We hope that these results from Japan will also be convincing to
the countries where an effective HPV vaccination program is not
already in place.

not significant. it might result from the background of the lower screening coverage
and the higher prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 from invasive cervical cancer and HSIL
of Japanese women in their twenties [10]. Data source: Japan Cancer Society.
