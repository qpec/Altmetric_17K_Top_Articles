Current infectious disease molecular tests are largely pathogen specific, requiring test selection based on the patient’s symptoms.
For many syndromes caused by a large number of viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens, such as respiratory tract infections, this
necessitates large panels of tests and has limited yield. In contrast, next-generation sequencing-based metagenomics can be used
for unbiased detection of any expected or unexpected pathogen. However, barriers for its diagnostic implementation include
incomplete understanding of analytical performance and complexity of sequence data analysis. We compared detection of
known respiratory virus-positive (n � 42) and unselected (n � 67) pediatric nasopharyngeal swabs using an RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq)-based metagenomics approach and Taxonomer, an ultrarapid, interactive, web-based metagenomics data analysis
tool, with an FDA-cleared respiratory virus panel (RVP; GenMark eSensor). Untargeted metagenomics detected 86% of known
respiratory virus infections, and additional PCR testing confirmed RVP results for only 2 (33%) of the discordant samples.
In unselected samples, untargeted metagenomics had excellent agreement with the RVP (93%). In addition, untargeted
metagenomics detected an additional 12 viruses that were either not targeted by the RVP or missed due to highly divergent ge-
nome sequences. Normalized viral read counts for untargeted metagenomics correlated with viral burden determined by quanti-
tative PCR and showed high intrarun and interrun reproducibility. Partial or full-length viral genome sequences were generated
in 86% of RNA-seq-positive samples, allowing assessment of antiviral resistance, strain-level typing, and phylogenetic related-
ness. Overall, untargeted metagenomics had high agreement with a sensitive RVP, detected viruses not targeted by the RVP, and
yielded epidemiologically and clinically valuable sequence information.
L
aboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases has historically taken
a syndrome-based approach. Culture of appropriate speci-
mens on a combination of relevant media or cell lines enables
detection of certain common bacterial, viral, and fungal patho-
gens. However, culture requires experienced personnel, requires
several days to weeks to yield a definitive answer, depends on
viability and appropriate culture conditions, and has limited sen-
sitivity. Molecular tests have superior turnaround times, sensitiv-
ity, and taxonomic resolution. However, only targeted pathogens
can be detected, and differentiation of clinically or epidemiologi-
cally relevant strains or genotypes is limited. Moreover, molecular
tests need to be updated when new species or strains are recog-
nized to ensure that newly identified genetic variants can be de-
tected.
In contrast, next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic
testing combines and extends many advantages of molecular tests
and culture-based methods. Host- and pathogen-derived nucleic
acids are sequenced without a priori knowledge of expected patho-
gens, allowing simultaneous detection of a virtually unlimited
number of microorganisms, the only requirement being that they
possess sequence homology with reference sequences.
Metagenomics-based pathogen detection is especially power-
ful when many diverse pathogens cause overlapping symptoms
and when molecular markers for drug resistance are known. One
such application is the detection of respiratory pathogens. Even
with state-of-the-art, multiplex molecular tests, identifying the
etiology of respiratory tract infections is often unsuccessful; e.g.,
respiratory pathogens are detected in only �40 to 80% of patients
with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using standard test-
ing approaches (1–5). In addition, respiratory viruses of unclear
pathogenicity (e.g., rhinovirus) are often found as the sole patho-
gen in many respiratory samples. These facts suggest that the true
etiology (6–9) of many cases remains unknown. In these scenar-
ios, metagenomics-based detection methods have great diagnostic
potential as alternative causes can be identified or excluded with
greater confidence compared to panel-based approaches. More-
over, metagenomics-based testing enables genotyping, assessment

While several recent studies have demonstrated the power of
next-generation sequencing-based metagenomics for pathogen
detection (10–18), its performance compared to that of commer-
cially available molecular tests is incompletely understood.
Equally important, it remains to be demonstrated whether meta-
genomics approaches can be implemented in diagnostic laborato-
ries and employed within a clinically meaningful time frame using
computational resources and data analysis expertise available in
diagnostic laboratories. Complexities of laboratory workflow,
speed of sequence analysis, and expertise required for analysis and
interpretation are chief concerns.
We evaluated the analytical performance of metagenomics for
detection of respiratory viruses using kit-based RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) analysis of total RNA extracted from pediatric naso-
pharyngeal (NP) swabs. Resulting sequence data were analyzed
with a rapid, interactive, web-based data analysis tool, Taxono-
mer, eliminating the need for expensive computational hardware
and bioinformatics expertise (S. Flygare, K. E. Simmon, C. Miller,
Y. Qiao, B. Kennedy, T. Di Sera, E. H. Graf, K. D. Tardif, A. Ka-
pusta, S. Rynearson, C. Stockmann, K. Queen, S. Tong, K. V.

Ampofo, K. Eilbeck, G. Marth, M. Yandell, R. Schlaberg, submit-
ted for publication). We compared results to those of an FDA-
cleared, multiplex PCR-based test, the GenMark eSensor respira-
tory virus panel (RVP). Overall RNA-seq-based pathogen
detection was highly concordant with the GenMark eSensor RVP,
detected additional viruses not targeted by the RVP, and yielded
epidemiologically and clinically valuable sequence information.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples. All nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from children less than 5 years
old tested by the GenMark eSensor respiratory virus panel (RVP, Gen-
Mark Dx, Carlsbad, CA) between April 2013 and March 2014 were de-
identified using standard institutional procedures (University of Utah
IRB number 56504) and stored at �80°C. Specimens positive for RNA
viruses tested by the GenMark assay were retrospectively collected, with
preference given to dual infections (human metapneumovirus [HMPV],
n � 5; human rhinovirus [HRV], n � 10; influenza A virus, n � 5; influ-
enza B virus, n � 5; parainfluenza 1 virus [PIV-1], n � 5; PIV-2, n � 1;
PIV-3 virus, n � 4; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], n � 7 [see Table S1
in the supplemental material]). In addition, 67 samples were selected at
random for inclusion in a direct side-by-side comparison.
GenMark eSensor respiratory virus panel. Nucleic acid was extracted
from 200 �l of sample, plus 10 �l of internal control, on the NucliSENS
easyMAG (bioMérieux, Durham, NC) and eluted into 60 �l, 5 �l of which
was reverse transcribed and amplified with the eSensor respiratory virus
panel reagents by following the manufacturer’s instructions (GenMark).
The following 14 viral targets are reported in the eSensor XT-8 system
(GenMark): adenovirus B/E, adenovirus C, influenza A virus, influ-
enza A H1 virus, influenza A H3 virus, influenza A 2009 H1N1 virus,
influenza B virus, RSV subtype A (RSV-A), RSV-B, PIV-1, PIV-2,
PIV-3, HMPV, and HRV.
Library preparation and RNA sequencing. NP swabs were thawed
and vortexed, and 160 �l of the transport medium was transferred for
extraction with the QIAamp viral RNA minikit by following the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluted RNA was vacuum
dried and stored at �80°C overnight. RNA-seq libraries were prepared
with the TruSeq RNA sample prep kit by following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were quantified with the
Illumina universal library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wil-
mington, MA). Library quality was assessed with a high-sensitivity DNA
analysis kit on a 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA). Libraries from 24 samples were combined in equimolar ratios for a
final concentration of 9.6 nM and sequenced in batches of 24 samples per
lane on a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Data analysis. RNA-seq data were analyzed with Taxonomer, a kmer-
based, rapid, interactive metagenomic sequence analysis tool accessed
through a web interface on the iobio framework at http://taxonomer
.iobio.io (19; Flygare et al., submitted). Taxonomer classifies each read to
the highest taxonomic rank possible given a comprehensive sequence da-
tabase (Fig. 1A and B). For the purposes of this study and to valid-
ate Taxonomer results, relevant human pathogens detected by Tax-
onomer were manually confirmed using Geneious (Biomatters, Ltd.,
Auckland, New Zealand) by mapping reads against a manually curated
list of full-length viral reference sequences downloaded from the
NCBI. Instead of using an absolute or relative read count threshold for
respiratory virus detection, all positive results were manually reviewed
to ensure the accuracy of viral classifications and to reduce false-pos-
itive calls. To minimize errors due to sample-to-sample contamina-
tion or demultiplexing errors, we generated consensus sequences for
all viral strains with sufficient coverage. For all virus-positive samples
with low read counts, sequencing reads were aligned to the viral consensus
sequence of samples with high read counts processed in the same batch
and sequenced on the same HiSeq lane. When sequencing reads from
samples with low read counts showed no polymorphisms compared to
the consensus sequence from samples with high read counts, results
were excluded as likely contaminants. Sequence-based typing of viral
strains was performed by manual alignment to a reference genome and
BLAST analysis of the largest contig of the appropriate genomic seg-
ment (e.g., VP1/3 for rhinovirus) or whole viral genome, if possible.
Strains were considered typed if the references with the highest se-
quence identity over the entire contig all belonged to the same geno-
types (e.g., RSV-B was the highest match with no RSV-A at the same
percent identity).
qPCR for respiratory viruses. Total nucleic acid was extracted on the
Chemagic MSM I platform (PerkinElmer) using 200 �l of the NP swab
transport medium. Nucleic acid was eluted into 80 �l, and 10 �l of the
elution was used for amplification on an ABI 7900 instrument (Life Tech-
nologies, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for human
metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses,
parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, and enterovirus validated for diagnostic
testing at ARUP Laboratories were used for comparison (see Table S2 in
the supplemental material; all primers and probes were obtained from
EliTech) (20, 21). For human rhinovirus and coronavirus species (HKU1,
NL63, and OC43), research tests were used (22). qPCR detection of en-
terovirus, HMPV, HRV, influenza A and B viruses, and RSV was per-
formed using QuantiTect reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) master
mix (Qiagen) on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)
with the following amplification conditions: 50°C for 30 min, 95°C for 15
min, and 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 76°C for 30 s. qPCR
detection of parainfluenza viruses was performed using the Rotor-Gene
multiplex RT-PCR master mix (Qiagen) on a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen)
with the following amplification conditions: 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 5
min, and 50 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 56°C for 20 s, and 76°C for 20 s. qPCR
detection of human coronaviruses was performed using the AgPath-ID
One-Step RT-PCR kit (ThermoFisher) on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR
system with the following amplification conditions: 45°C for 10 min, 95°C
for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 55°C for 1 min. RNA
standards specific for each virus were used to generate standard curves.
qPCR was performed for each of the viruses detected by the RVP on the
respective samples.
Statistics. Linear and Spearman’s rank correlations were performed
with Prism (version 5.04, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and P
values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Metagenomic analysis of RVP-positive samples. To assess the
accuracy of untargeted metagenomics, archived nasopharyngeal
swabs (n � 42) positive for one or more viruses by the RVP were
retrospectively selected. Preference was given to samples with co-
detection of �1 virus. Agreement between RNA viruses detected
by the RVP and untargeted metagenomics was 86% (Fig. 1C). Six
respiratory viruses detected by the RVP were not detected by un-
targeted metagenomics (blue bars). Four of these (one each of
rhinovirus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza type 2, and respira-
tory syncytial virus) were also not detected by qPCR (hatched blue
bars). Considering these by RVP, adjusted positive agreement be-
tween the RVP and metagenomics was 95%. Both of the remain-
ing RVP-positive, untargeted metagenomics-negative samples
were low positive for rhinovirus, with qPCR threshold cycle (CT)
values of 33 and 35.
Untargeted metagenomic and RVP analysis of unselected
samples. Between April 2013 and March 2014, all NP swabs from
children less than 5 years of age submitted for the RVP were
banked after testing. From these, 67 were selected at random for
testing by untargeted metagenomics. Of these, 36 samples
(55.2%) were positive by RVP for one or more respiratory viruses
(adenovirus, n � 2; HMPV, n � 4; influenza A virus, n � 3; PIV-1,
n � 1; HRV, n � 20; and RSV, n � 7). Of the 37 swabs for which
respiratory virus was detected, 34 (91.9%) also had virus detected
by untargeted metagenomics (Fig. 1D). For two of the remaining
three samples, there was sufficient sample to attempt qPCR
confirmation of RVP results. In both cases, qPCR results agreed
with those of untargeted metagenomics. The overall positivity
rate for untargeted metagenomics was 63%. Untargeted meta-
genomics detected 12 additional respiratory viruses, 3 of which
were targeted by the RVP. Seven of the 12 additional viruses
(58.3%) were confirmed by qPCR, 3 were qPCR negative, and 2
could not be tested due to due to limited sample volumes. The
3 viruses detected by untargeted metagenomics but not qPCR
had low viral read counts (4 to 31 reads). However, these reads
were located across unique regions of viral genomes and se-
quences differed by several nucleotides from those of other
viral strains detected at higher read counts within the batch,
suggesting that they were not misclassifications and unlikely to
be contaminants. Rhinovirus was the pathogen most fre-

missed by untargeted metagenomics (blue bars) could not be detected by qPCR (hashed bars), resulting in detection of 36 of 38 viruses (95%) that were
consistently detected by targeted methods. (D) Untargeted metagenomics detected more viral infections (n � 48, including 11 not targeted by the RVP [asterisk])

 quently detected by either method (n � 22); RSV was second
(n � 6), followed by coronavirus (not included on the RVP; n � 5)
and HMPV (n � 5). Manual confirmation of Taxonomer results
showed 100% qualitative agreement for detection of respiratory
viruses.
Codetection of �2 respiratory viruses was more common with
untargeted metagenomics (14%) than with the RVP (3%). The
majority of codetections involved rhinoviruses and human boca-
virus (HBoV). When possible, these codetections were confirmed
with qPCR. There were several samples that were positive by both
the RVP and untargeted metagenomics but negative by qPCR,
suggesting that untargeted metagenomics has a sensitivity at least
comparable to those of the RVP and qPCR.
Correlation of viral read counts with viral loads determined
by qPCR. In some studies, semiquantitative detection of respira-
tory viruses has been shown to correlate with disease severity (23–
25). To assess the use of viral read counts to estimate viral burden,
we compared viral loads by qPCR with normalized viral reads
counts using the normalization scheme described in reference 26.
Briefly, numbers of viral reads in 68 positive samples were divided
by the number of total reads and the size of the respective viral
genome in kilobases and then multiplied by 1 million to generate
an RPKM (reads per kilobase of reference sequence per million
total sequencing reads) value. Our untargeted metagenomics ap-
proach generated a median of 15 million reads per sample (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 8 to 19 million), of which a median of 0.01%
was of viral origin (IQR, 0.002 to 0.07%) (Fig. 2A). The number of
viral reads spanned �5 orders of magnitude (2 � 105 to 3.2 � 105
reads) in RVP- and monoplex qPCR-positive samples (Fig. 2B).
Correlation of RPKM and viral copies per milliliter was highly
significant, with a P value of �0.0001 across viral taxa (Fig. 3A).
This suggests that normalized viral read counts can be used for
semiquantitative measurement of the viral burden in clinical sam-
ples.
Reproducibility. Three samples at different positivity levels by
untargeted metagenomics (fractional abundance of viral reads)
were selected to evaluate within-run and between-run variability.
Two of the viruses were also detected by the RVP; the third one
was a sample positive by qPCR for coronavirus. Each sample was
processed from start to finish (extraction to analysis) a total of 5
(HRV and HMPV) or 14 (HCoV) times. Libraries were sequenced
on the same (within run) and on different (between-run) HiSeq
lanes (Fig. 3B). Fractional abundance (viral reads as a proportion
of total reads) is graphed for each repeat, and the coefficient of
variation was calculated from these values. Given the complexity
of the workflow, untargeted metagenomics demonstrated excel-
lent reproducibility, with coefficients of variation of 65% (HMPV,
lowest fractional abundance), 16% (HCoV), and 47% (HRV,
greatest fractional abundance).
Sequence-based characterization of viral strains and antivi-
ral drug resistance determination. As metagenomics provides se-
quence information in addition to mere determination of pres-
ence or absence of pathogens, we studied available viral sequences
to demonstrate utility. Even though viral reads were a very small
proportion of the total reads, sufficient sequence was obtained for
84% of positive specimens to enable high-resolution, sequence-
based genotyping. Consistent with the RVP results, all of the in-
fluenza A virus-positive specimens were typed as 2009 H1N1
strains. By untargeted metagenomics, we were able to examine the
oseltamivir resistance mutation at amino acid position 275
(H275Y) of the neuraminidase gene in 6 out of 8 positive speci-
mens (1.6- to 200-fold median coverage), none of which showed
the H275Y amino acid substitution. Sequence coverage in the re-
maining 2 specimens was too low. RSV-B was far more common
than RSV-A (9 versus 3 of 12 RSV-positive samples). These results
were consistent with RVP-based typing. Most rhinoviruses be-
longed to rhinovirus species C (62%), with only 21% belonging to
rhinovirus species A and 3% to rhinovirus B (Fig. 4). Fourteen
percent of rhinoviruses were nontypeable. For 14 (52%) of the
rhinovirus-positive samples, coverage of the viral genome was suf-
ficient to generate full-length viral consensus sequences. Genetic
diversity was greatest for strains that belonged to rhinovirus spe-
cies C. Strains B and N, which clustered closely together, were
collected during the same month from patients from the same
state. The most divergent sample from any full-length sequence in
the NCBI nucleotide database was sample I, which had only 75%

 sequence identity with the closest match, HRV-C3 (strain HRV-
QPM; GenBank accession no. GQ223228). This sample was
missed by the RVP but tested positive by the monoplex qPCR,
with a threshold cycle value of 20. The one enterovirus sequence
was most similar to coxsackievirus B4 strain E2 (NCBI accession
number AF311939; 84% overall nucleotide identity). The alpha
coronavirus NL63 was detected in 3 samples, and beta coronavi-
ruses HKU1 and OC43 were detected in 2 samples each. All hu-
man bocaviruses detected (n � 4) belonged to genotype 1.
Detection of RNA from DNA viruses. Untargeted meta-
genomics was able to detect only 1 of 2 adenovirus-positive sam-
ples (Fig. 1B). Only a very few adenovirus reads were generated in
the 2 untargeted metagenomics-positive samples (Fig. 2B). How-
ever, human bocavirus RNA was detected at high read counts in
four samples (Fig. 2B). Additionally, high levels of RNA reads
from a number of nonrespiratory DNA viruses were detected by
metagenomics, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), cyto-
megalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and anellovirus
(data not shown). Optimized nucleic acid extraction methods or
simultaneous preparation of cDNA and DNA libraries may enable
more complete characterization of the DNA virome in clinical
samples.
Reagent contamination. Contamination from reagents em-
ployed during extraction, library preparation, and sequencing has
been previously described (27). To assess the contamination gen-
erated by our approach, we extracted and sequenced 3 molecular-
grade water samples alongside clinical samples. The reads gener-
ated by these samples were largely bacterial. No respiratory viruses
or known human-pathogenic viruses were detected (data not
shown).
DISCUSSION
We showed that untargeted metagenomic analysis can attain ac-
curacies and sensitivities that compare favorably with those of a
commercial RVP, even though different extraction protocols were

evaluated by extracting and sequencing the same sample 5 (human rhinovirus [HRV] and human metapneumovirus [HMPV]) or 14 (human coronavirus

abundance (viral reads per total reads) is shown for within-run replicates (same color) and between-run replicates (different colors). Precision is shown as
percent coefficient of variation (CV).
FIG 4 High-resolution, sequence-based typing of 14 human rhinovirus
strains based on RNA-seq directly from NP swabs. Most strains belonged to
rhinovirus species C (n � 12; 86%), with 2 strains (14%) belonging to lineage
1, 4 strains (29%) belonging to lineage 2, and 6 strains (43%) belonging to
lineage 3; 2 strains belonged to rhinovirus species A, and no rhinovirus species
B strains were detected. Near full-length sequences of 14 human rhinovirus
strains (strains A through N) were aligned (MUSCLE); a neighbor-joining
consensus tree (1,000 replicates) is shown. Full-length reference sequences for
rhinovirus A (HRV-A89), rhinovirus B (HRV-B14), and representative full-
length genome sequences from each of the rhinovirus C lineages (GenBank
accession numbers EF077280, GQ223227, and JN990702 [40]) were included
for comparison. Poliovirus 1 was used as the outgroup. For strains sequenced

 used. The unbiased nature of RNA-seq allowed us to query a the-
oretically unlimited number of pathogens in parallel, resulting in
detection of more human viruses and a higher positivity rate.
These included well-known respiratory viruses with clinical rele-
vance when detected in the upper respiratory tract, as well as po-
tential pathogens that may only be relevant in the appropriate
(e.g., immunocompromised) host and when detected from the
lower respiratory tract (e.g., HSV and CMV). Interestingly, even
though we used RNA-seq and included a DNase treatment step,
DNA viruses were detected in some, but not all, RVP-positive
samples. It is possible that detection of mRNA from DNA viruses
may serve as a marker of active replication. This is of relevance, as
several DNA viral respiratory pathogens can become latent (e.g.,
HSV and CMV) or persist for extended periods (e.g., human bo-
cavirus [HBoV]), so detection of their genomic DNA may not be
a sufficient indication for acute infections (28).
The sensitivity of untargeted metagenomics is a function of
sample composition and sequencing depth. When sequenced to
the same depth, samples with an abundance of nonpathogen RNA
(e.g., highly cellular samples or samples with abundant normal
flora) result in lower analytical sensitivity than samples in which
the pathogen RNA is more abundant (e.g., less cellular samples,
higher pathogen load, or absence of normal flora). As rRNA rep-
resents a large proportion of host RNA, rRNA depletion strategies
have been used to mitigate this effect. We decided not to use this
approach, as it may have off-target effects (e.g., depleting micro-
bial rRNA or other sequences with sufficient homology), which
limits the unbiased nature of metagenomics. In addition, rRNA
depletion or target enrichment steps add complexity and cost to
the workflow. Samples were sequenced to a depth of 5 � 106 to
10 � 106 reads/sample to limit sequencing costs. This sequencing
depth resulted in comparable positivity rates and agreement with
RVP and qPCR of �90%. When clinically relevant, samples can be
sequenced more deeply, resulting in proportional increases of an-
alytical sensitivity.
When approaching the limit of detection, small numbers of
viral reads pose challenges to result interpretation, as they can
represent true-positive, low-level detections or artifacts. False-
positive detections can be due to contamination during library
preparation (e.g., sample-to-sample contamination prior to in-
dexing), may be a result of sequencing artifacts (e.g., run-to-run
carryover or demultiplexing errors), or may be caused by errone-
ous classification during data analysis (e.g., due to highly homol-
ogous or low-complexity regions) (29). Thus, the confidence of
viral detection depends on the number of viral reads and evenness
of coverage. Given the testing complexity, read counts may vary
between analytical replicates. To determine the within-run and
between-run variability, we tested multiple aliquots of 3 virus-
positive samples from sample extraction through data analysis.
Respiratory viral read counts across a wide range of fractional
abundance were highly reproducible within and between runs
(coefficients of variation [CV] ranging from 16% to 63%). Collec-
tively, our results demonstrate that untargeted metagenomics can
be used to supplement current PCR-based tests and that meta-
genomics data can be rapidly and effectively analyzed using re-
cently published, ultrafast read-classification tools such as Tax-
onomer, SURPI (30), and Kraken (31).
Another distinct advantage of metagenomics-based pathogen
detection is the ability to determine the molecular subtype of a
particular virus and query it quickly for genotypic markers of drug
resistance or pathogenicity. In our study, molecular typing was
possible for 84% of all viral strains. Relevant information derived
from typing included the following: (i) almost two-thirds of rhi-
noviruses belonged to the more pathogenic species, C, including
one highly divergent strain missed by the RVP (32, 33); (ii) all
influenza A viruses were 2009 H1N1 strains, but none contained
the H275Y mutation conferring oseltamivir resistance; (iii)
RSV-B was 3 times more prevalent than RSV-A, which may be
relevant, as strain-specific differences in pathogenicity have been
suggested; (iv) high-resolution typing of an enterovirus as cox-
sackievirus B4; (v) typing of 7 coronaviruses as NL63, HKU1, and
OC43; and (vi) genotyping of 4 bocavirus strains as HBoV-1. As
genotype-phenotype correlations become better understood, ge-
notypic strain characterization will gain importance. This will also
facilitate epidemiologic investigations or studies of vaccine effec-
tiveness. Particularly in the case of influenza, real-time sequence
information will improve surveillance studies, enable early detec-
tion of antiviral drug resistance, and inform vaccination strategies.
Respiratory viral burden correlates with disease severity and
may help differentiate asymptomatic shedding from active infec-
tion (23–25, 34). Published studies correlating viral read counts
with qPCR had limited sample sizes (13–15). Thus, we tested
whether normalized read counts could be used for quantifica-
tion of the viral burden by comparison to viral loads deter-
mined by pathogen-specific, laboratory-developed qPCRs.
While viral reads always represented a small fraction of total
reads (Fig. 2A), normalized counts correlated highly significantly
with viral loads. Untargeted metagenomics could therefore also be
used to measure viral burden.
While we demonstrated analytical performance comparable to
the RVP, there are several barriers for routine diagnostic deploy-
ment of metagenomics-based testing. These include lengthy turn-
around times, costs, and complexity of data analysis. First, the
library preparation method used in this study required �14 h. We
performed sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument in
high-output run mode, which took an additional �11 days. At the
time of this writing, partially automated solutions for RNA-seq
library preparation within �8 h and sequencing within �1 day for
comparable per-base costs have become available (11, 35). These
advances are starting to enable diagnostic laboratories to provide
results in a clinically meaningful time frame and with a workflow
that can be implemented in diagnostic laboratories. However, for
wide adoption, rapid, automated, closed-system library prepara-
tion methods and quicker sample-to-data times are needed.
Second, cost is a great concern regarding the use of next-gen-
eration sequencing in infectious disease diagnostics. For the pres-
ent study, RNA-seq reagent costs per sample were within $10 to
$20 of reagent costs for RVP. This was in part due to multiplexing
24 samples per sequencing lane. At the time of this writing,
cheaper library preparation kits and sequencing platforms have
further decreased costs, quickly eliminating the cost differential.
Enrichment of viral sequences and depletion of uninformative
host RNA can reduce sequencing costs by increasing coverage but
introduces complexity and costs of library preparations (36, 37).
We analyzed untargeted metagenomics data solely for the pres-
ence of respiratory viruses, ignoring bacterial respiratory patho-
gens simultaneously identified by Taxonomer, as most of those
can be part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora and only NP
swabs were tested. However, when used with lower respiratory
tract samples, untargeted metagenomics has the potential to also

 replace a large number of commonly performed culture- and
PCR-based tests.
Finally, data analysis needs to be rapid, user-friendly, and reli-
able enough that it can be implemented without large investments
in highly trained personnel and computational infrastructure. We
used our recently published metagenomics data analysis tool, Tax-
onomer, to screen for the presence of respiratory viruses (Flygare
et al., submitted). Taxonomer analyzed �1 � 106 reads/minute,
requiring �10 min per sample. For diagnostic applications, data
analysis solutions are needed that minimize the time users spend
reviewing results. We confirmed all respiratory virus detections
manually to ensure accuracy. However, this was only informative
for samples with low viral read counts given concern of false-
positive results due to misclassification or sequencing artifacts
(see above). Several RVP and qPCR-positive samples produced
only �10 reads for that virus, making detections unreliable at this
low end (Fig. 2B). Deeper sequencing or target enrichment deple-
tion approaches could alleviate the problem but increase costs
and/or workflow complexity. For highly variable viruses (e.g., Pi-
cornaviridae), suspicious reads can be mapped back to viral con-
sensus sequences of source strains to identify reads that likely rep-
resent artifacts. For diagnostic adoption, interpretive criteria
similar to those being established for genomics laboratories will
need to be developed and incorporated in diagnostic data analysis
tools to enable consistent and rapid analyses (38, 39).
In summary, we showed that metagenomics-based detection
of respiratory viruses holds promise as a diagnostics tool enabling
unbiased pathogen detection, molecular tying, and genotypic as-
sessment of drug resistance or pathogenicity. Barriers to adoption,
including turnaround time, cost, and complex data analysis, are
rapidly being removed. Adoption may be for testing of immuno-
compromised or otherwise predisposed patients, when routine
therapeutic approaches fail, during clusters of infections of un-
known etiology, or when molecular characterization of pathogens
is sought. As highlighted by a diverse HRV-A strain missed by the
RVP, the unbiased nature of metagenomics can also assist with
detection of novel viruses or variant strains.
