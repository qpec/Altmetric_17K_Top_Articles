The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that the burden 
of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States 
is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted 
tobacco products (1). Cigarettes are the most commonly 
used tobacco product among U.S. adults, and about 480,000 
U.S. deaths per year are caused by cigarette smoking and 
secondhand smoke exposure (1). To assess progress toward 
the Healthy People 2020 target of reducing the proportion of 
U.S. adults aged ≥18 years who smoke cigarettes to ≤12.0% 
(objective TU-1.1),* CDC analyzed data from the 2016 
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). In 2016, the 
prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults was 
15.5%, which was a significant decline from 2005 (20.9%); 
however, no significant change has occurred since 2015 
(15.1%). In 2016, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 
higher among adults who were male, aged 25–64 years, 
American Indian/Alaska Native or multiracial, had a General 
Education Development (GED) certificate, lived below the 
federal poverty level, lived in the Midwest or South, were 
uninsured or insured through Medicaid, had a disability/
limitation, were lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), or had serious 
psychological distress. During 2005–2016, the percentage 
of ever smokers who quit smoking increased from 50.8% to 
59.0%. Proven population-based interventions are critical to 
reducing the health and economic burden of smoking-related 
diseases among U.S. adults, particularly among subpopula-
tions with the highest smoking prevalences (1,2).
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative in-person 
survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. 
The NHIS core questionnaire is administered to a randomly 
selected adult in the household (the sample adult). In 2016, 
the NHIS was administered to 33,028 adults aged ≥18 years;

objectives.
the response rate was 54.3%. Current cigarette smokers were 
respondents who reported having smoked ≥100 cigarettes dur-
ing their lifetime and were smoking every day or some days at 
the time of interview. Former smokers were respondents who 
reported having smoked ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime 
but were not smoking at the time of interview. The mean 
number of cigarettes smoked per day was calculated among 
daily smokers. Quit ratios were defined as the ratio of former 
smokers to ever smokers (i.e., persons who had smoked ≥100 
cigarettes during their lifetime).
Data were weighted to adjust for differences in the prob-
ability of selection and nonresponse and to provide nationally 
representative estimates. Current smoking was assessed overall

** Disability/limitation was defined based on self-reported presence of selected 
impairments including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations 
in performing activities of daily living was defined based on response to the 
question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in 
performing instrumental activities of daily living was defined based on response 
to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does 
[person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office 
or shopping?” Any disability/limitation was defined as a “yes” response 
pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (e.g., vision, 
hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental 
activities of daily living). A random sample of half the respondents from the 
2016 Person File were asked about disability/limitation. Disability/limitation 
estimates (%, population estimate) were obtained using the specific adult 
disability weight.
 
†† Starting in 2013, sexual orientation questions were added to NHIS for the 
first time. To determine sexual orientation, adult respondents were asked, 
“Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” with a 
response options of gay (“lesbian or gay” for female respondents), straight, 
that is, “not gay” (“not lesbian or gay” for female respondents), bisexual, 
something else, and I don’t know the answer.
 
§§ The six-question K6 scale was developed to identify persons with a high 
likelihood of having a diagnosable mental illness and associated functional 
limitations. The K6 scale asked how often during the past 30 days the 
respondents felt a) so sad that nothing could cheer them up; b) nervous; 
c) restless or fidgety; d) hopeless; e) that everything was an effort; and 
f) worthless. Responses were on a five-point Likert scale ranging from none 
of the time to all of the time. For each question, a value of zero, one, two, 
three, or four was assigned to the response “none of the time,” “a little of 
the time,” “some of the time,” “most of the time,” or “all of the time,” 
respectively. Responses to the six items were summed to yield a K6 score 
between 0 and 24, with a score of 13 or higher indicating serious 
psychological distress. Additional information available at https://www.cdc.

Differences between groups were assessed using a Wald F test, 
with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Population 
counts were estimated from extrapolated probability weights, 
rounded down to the nearest 10,000 persons. Quit ratios were 
calculated overall and by age group. Logistic regression was 
used to assess overall trends in prevalence, cigarettes smoked 
per day, and quit ratios during 2005–2016, controlling for 
sex, age, and race/ethnicity. T-tests were performed to examine 
differences between 2015 and 2016.
In 2016, 15.5% (37.8 million) of U.S. adults were cur-
rent cigarette smokers (Table). Overall, smoking prevalence 
did not change significantly from 2015 (15.1%) to 2016 
(15.5%). Current cigarette smoking prevalence was higher 
among males (17.5%) than among females (13.5%). By age 
group, prevalence was higher among adults aged 25–44 years 
(17.6%) and 45–64 years (18.0%) than among those aged 
18–24 years (13.1%) or ≥65 years (8.8%). Prevalence was 
highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives (31.8%) and 
lowest among non-Hispanic Asians (9.0%). Among adults 
aged ≥25 years, prevalence was highest among persons with a 
GED (40.6%) and lowest among those with a graduate degree 
(4.5%). Prevalence was higher among persons living below the 
poverty level (25.3%) than those at or above this level (14.3%). 
By region, prevalence was higher in the Midwest (18.5%) and 
South (16.9%) than the West (12.3%) or Northeast (13.3%). 
By insurance status, prevalence was higher among Medicaid 
enrollees (25.3%) and uninsured adults (28.4%) than among 
those covered by private insurance (11.8%), Medicare only 
(10.2%), or other public insurance (19.8%). Prevalence was 
higher among adults with a disability/limitation (21.2%) than 
among those with no disability/limitation (14.4%). Prevalence 
was higher among LGB adults (20.5%) than among hetero-
sexual adults (15.3%) and among adults with serious psycho-
logical distress (35.8%) than among those without serious 
psychological distress (14.7%).
Among current smokers, the proportion of daily smokers was 
76.1% in 2016, which declined from 2005 (80.8%, p-value 
for trend <0.05) (data not shown). Whereas mean number of 
cigarettes smoked per day declined from 2005 (16.7) to 2016 
(14.1) among daily smokers (p-value for trend <0.05), no 
change occurred between 2015 (14.2) and 2016 (14.1) (data 
not shown). During 2005–2016, increases occurred in the 
proportion of daily smokers who smoked 1–9 cigarettes per 
day (from 16.4% to 25.0%) or 10–19 (from 36.0% to 39.0%) 
cigarettes per day (Figure 1). At the same time, decreases 
occurred in the proportion of daily smokers who smoked 
20–29 (from 34.9% to 28.4%) or ≥30 (from 12.7% to 7.5%) 
cigarettes per day during 2005–2016 (p-value for trend <0.05). 
No significant changes in any category of number of cigarettes 
smoked per day occurred during 2015–2016.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that the burden of 
death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is 
overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted 
tobacco products. Cigarettes are the most commonly used 
tobacco product among U.S. adults, and about 480,000 deaths 
per year are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand 
smoke exposure.
What is added by this report?
The proportion of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined 
from 20.9% in 2005 (45.1 million smokers) to 15.5% in 2016 
(37.8 million smokers), but cigarette smoking prevalence did 
not change significantly during 2015–2016. Sociodemographic 
disparities in cigarette smoking persist. During 2005–2016, 
increases occurred in the proportion of adult ever smokers who 
quit smoking (50.8% to 59.0%).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Proven population-based interventions, including tobacco price 
increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, high-impact 
anti-tobacco media campaigns, and barrier-free access to 
tobacco cessation counseling and medications, are critical to 
reducing cigarette smoking and smoking-related disease and 
death among U.S. adults, particularly among subpopulations 
with the highest smoking prevalence.
The overall quit ratio increased from 50.8% in 2005 to 
59.0% in 2016 (p<0.05). During 2005–2016, the largest 
increase in quit ratios occurred among adults aged 25–44 years 
(from 37.0% to 48.9% [p<0.05]) (Figure 2).
Discussion
During 2005–2016, the prevalence of cigarette smoking 
among U.S. adults declined from 20.9% to 15.5%, and the 
proportion of ever smokers who had quit increased. However, 
during 2015–2016, cigarette smoking prevalence did not 
change significantly. In 2016, 37.8 million U.S. adults were 
current cigarette smokers, and marked sociodemographic 
differences in smoking prevalence persist. Proven population-
based interventions, including tobacco price increases, compre-
hensive smoke-free laws, anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, 
and barrier-free access to tobacco cessation counseling and 
medications, are critical to reduce cigarette smoking and 
smoking-related disease and death among U.S. adults, par-
ticularly among subpopulations with the highest prevalences.
The observed disparities in smoking prevalence are likely 
attributable to multiple factors (1). Racial or ethnic differ-
ences might be partly explained by sociocultural influences 
and norms related to the acceptability of tobacco use and 
variations in exposure to tobacco marketing, whereas dispari-
ties by education might be partly attributable to variations in

understanding of the range of health hazards caused by smok-
ing (3,4). Variations in access to evidence-based tobacco ces-
sation treatments through insurance coverage might partially 
explain the differences observed across insurance types (5). 
Smoking prevalence was higher among persons with severe 
psychological distress (6,7), potentially because of higher levels 
of addiction and dependence, lack of financial resources, less 
access to cessation treatments, and stressful living conditions 
among these persons (6,7). Assessing the smoking status of all 
patients served in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient settings, 
integrating evidence-based cessation interventions into mental 
health treatment plans, and implementing tobacco-free cam-
pus policies in mental health care facilities could help reduce 
smoking in this population (6,7).
During 2005–2016, an increasing proportion of adults who 
ever smoked cigarettes had quit smoking. However, following 
consecutive significant annual declines during 2013–2014 and 
2014–2015 (8), no change in smoking prevalence was observed 
between 2015 and 2016. Moreover, longstanding declines in 
the proportion of daily smokers who smoked ≥20 cigarettes 
per day have stalled in recent years. These findings could be 
the result of multiple factors, including slowed progress in the 
adoption of proven interventions (9), or increased nicotine 
dependence from the concurrent use of other tobacco products 
(1). These findings underscore the importance of enhanced 
and sustained implementation of proven population-level 
interventions to continue previously observed annual declines 
in adult cigarette smoking (2).

¶¶  Private coverage: Includes adults who had any comprehensive private insurance plan (including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider 
organizations). Medicaid: For adults aged <65 years, includes adults who do not have private coverage, but who have Medicaid or other state-sponsored health 
plans including Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). For adults aged ≥65 years, includes adults who do not have any private coverage but have Medicare 
and Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans including CHIP; Medicare only: Includes older adults who only have Medicare coverage; Other coverage: 
Includes adults who do not have private insurance, Medicaid, or other public coverage, but who have any type of military coverage or Medicare (for those aged 
<65 years). This category also includes adults who are covered by other government programs. Uninsured: Includes adults who have not indicated that they are 
covered at the time of the interview under private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, a state-sponsored health plan, other government programs, or 
military coverage.
 
*** Disability/limitation was defined based on self-reported presence of selected impairments including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in 
performing activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in performing 
instrumental activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have 
difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability/limitation was defined as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of 
the disabilities/limitations listed (e.g., vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample 
of half the respondents from the 2016 Person File were asked about disability/limitation. Disability/limitation estimates (%, population estimate) were obtained 
used the specific adult disability weight.
 ††† Response options provided on the National Health Interview Survey were “straight, that is, not gay” for men, and “straight, that is, not gay or lesbian” for women.
 
§§§ The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and feeling like 
everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging between “None of the time” (score = 0) and “All of the time” 
(score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; any person with a score of ≥13 was coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents 
with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, smoking status was self-reported and not validated 
by biochemical testing; however, self-reported smoking status 
is correlated with serum cotinine levels (10). Second, because 
NHIS does not include institutionalized populations and per-
sons in the military, results are not generalizable to these groups. 
Third, the NHIS response rate of 54.3% might have resulted 
in nonresponse bias, even after adjustment for nonresponse. 
Fourth, the assessment of broad racial/ethnic populations (e.g., 
Asians and Hispanics) can mask differences in smoking preva-
lence among subgroups of these populations.¶¶ Finally, these 
estimates might differ from those reported from other surveys. 
These differences can be partially explained by varying survey

methodologies and definitions of current smoking; however, 
trends in prevalence are comparable across surveys (1).
Sustained implementation of comprehensive state tobacco 
control programs can accelerate progress toward reducing adult 
smoking prevalence (2). Targeted interventions are warranted to 
reach subpopulations with the highest incidence of use, and can 
result in substantial reductions in tobacco-related disease and death 
and billions of dollars in savings from averted medical costs (1).
