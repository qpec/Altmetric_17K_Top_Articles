The importance of adequate 
intervention descriptions in minimising 
research waste and improving research 
usability and reproducibility has gained 
attention in the past few years. Nearly 
all focus to date has been on 
intervention reporting in randomised 
trials. Yet clinicians are encouraged to 
use systematic reviews, whenever 
available, rather than single trials to 
inform their practice. This article 
explores the problem and implications 
of incomplete intervention details 
during the planning, conduct, and 
reporting of systematic reviews and 
makes recommendations for review 
authors, peer reviewers, and journal 
editors
Up to 60% of interventions in trial reports are 
inadequately described, although more information 
can sometimes be obtained from the authors.1 
When interventions are inadequately described in 
randomised trials, clinicians and patients must guess 
how to use effective interventions, and researchers are 
unable to replicate or build on the research. Another 
consequence is that the intervention details are not 
available to the authors of systematic reviews. 
Few studies have examined the problem of 
inadequate description of interventions in systematic 
reviews. An analysis of 58 systematic reviews of 
stroke interventions2 found that most were missing 
information for the majority of items needed to make 
an intervention description adequate. For example, 
details such as the intervention procedure, materials, 
fidelity, and tailoring were missing from more than 
80% of reviews. 
Inadequate intervention reporting in trials not 
only produces avoidable waste for the original trials 
but is compounded in downstream uses of the trials, 
such as in systematic reviews, with implications for 
the reproducibility and usability of the systematic 
review.
Appropriate use of intervention details in the 
planning, conduct, and reporting of systematic 
reviews is facilitated by interventions being well 
described in trials and other evaluative studies. The 
Template of Intervention Description and Replication 
(TIDieR) checklist and guide was developed and 
published in 2014 to help authors comprehensively 
describe interventions, with an initial focus on trials.3 
Historically, the development of systematic review 
techniques, methods, and technologies has focused on 
aspects such as searching, assessing and reporting risk 
of bias, and statistical methods. The clinical usability 
of the results of systematic reviews has had less 
attention, and the reporting of intervention in reviews 
almost none.4
To identify a common approach for improving the 
consideration and reporting of intervention details 
in systematic reviews a group of experts—including 
systematic review authors, trial authors, journal editors, 
methodologists, and statisticians with expertise 
in intervention descriptions, reporting guidelines, 
trials, and systematic reviews—attended a one day 
meeting in Oxford in June 2016. Representatives from 
the following groups also attended: the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses (PRISMA) group,5 the Cochrane Library, 
the EQUATOR Network, the Template of Intervention 
Description and Replication (TIDieR) group,3 the 
Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and 
Coordinating (EPPI) Centre, and the NIHR Journals 
Library. The meeting organisers (TH, PG) invited 
participants, drafted the agenda, invited presentations, 
and collected and disseminated background literature. 
The day consisted of stimulus presentations on key 
relevant topics and associated research followed by 
group discussions and recording of discussion points 
and possible recommendations. In the final session, 
delegates discussed and collaboratively modified draft 
recommendations to improve the consideration and

SUMMARY POINTS
•  
Intervention details are rarely fully considered or completely reported in 
systematic reviews, limiting the reproducibility and usability of systematic 
reviews—this is wasteful
•  
 Intervention details are needed in many stages of the review process—from 
question formulation to decisions about eligibility and analyses, results 
interpretation, and use of the review findings
•  
 Systematic review authors should give careful consideration to intervention 
details during the planning, conduct, and reporting of the review, including 
extracting, requesting, and fully reporting them
•  
 Improving the consideration and description of interventions in systematic 
reviews, such by providing a summary table with details, is likely to contribute 
to reducing avoidable waste in health research

description of interventions in systematic reviews until 
group consensus was achieved. After the meeting, the 
group members (authors of this paper) refined the 
final wording of these recommendations, which are 
reported here.
Recommendations to improve the consideration of 
interventions when planning, conducting, and reporting 
systematic reviews
The recommendations that authors of systematic 
reviews should undertake when planning, conducting, 
and reporting their reviews are shown in box 1. An 
elaboration and explanation of each recommendation 
follows the box. They are applicable to all systematic 
reviews of studies of intervention effectiveness. 
Specific recommendations for Cochrane reviews 
and non-Cochrane reviews are detailed later in this 
section. For most systematic reviews, many of the 
recommendations also apply to the comparator 
intervention with these details needing appropriate 
consideration and reporting as well.
Recommendation 1—Consider intervention details 
during question formulation
Many systematic review authors use the PICO format 
(patient, 
population 
or 
problem; 
intervention; 
comparison intervention (if appropriate); outcome of 
focus) to design their review question. When doing 
this, the I (intervention, and where necessary, its 
characteristics; and if a multicomponent intervention, 
the major components) should be given as much 
consideration as the other parts. Authors should 
use TIDieR to identify any important details of the 
intervention that should determine the questions that 
the review will aim to answer; for example, which active 
components are used, the timing of the intervention, 
the dose, the mode of delivery, or who provides the 
intervention. Such details will also help to inform 
the breadth of the review. If a scoping exercise was 
performed as part of the planning process, summarising 
the intervention details (such as in a summary table) 
from studies found in the scoping exercise might help 
inform this decision. Authors should also carefully 
consider intervention details when deciding on the 
main comparison that will be made in the review.
Recommendation 2—Describe intervention 
considerations in the review protocol
When registering a systematic review title (such as 
at 
PROSPERO; 
www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) 
and writing a protocol, authors should carefully 
consider and describe the intervention and its relevant 
components (if multicomponent) and characteristics. 
Items in the reporting guideline for systematic review 
protocols (PRISMA-P) that are particularly relevant to 
this include: item 7, explicit statement of the review 
question; 8, eligibility criteria; 10, search strategy; 12, 
data items; and 15a, criteria for quantitative synthesis.6 
Further details about sections of the protocol relevant 
to intervention details are provided below:
Background
If relevant, protocol authors should report how 
consideration of details of the intervention affected 
the scope of the review and the categorisation of 
interventions within this scope. Where relevant, 
authors should also clarify why differences in the 
details of the intervention might modify its effects; 
for example, which active components are used, 
the timing of the intervention, the dose, the mode of 
delivery, or who provides the intervention.
Objectives
Intervention details might determine the main 
comparisons that will be made and should be 
considered when deciding on the review’s objectives.
Eligibility criteria
Intervention details might be part of inclusion or 
exclusion criteria and should be clearly stated. When 
intervention details in potentially eligible studies are 
not stated or not clear, this step in a review can be 
compromised.
Box 1: Recommendations for authors to improve the consideration interventions 
when planning, conducting, and reporting systematic reviews
Planning the review
1 Consider intervention details during question formulation
Use TIDieR3 to identify any important details of the intervention that will determine 
the questions that the review will ask, including how broad or narrow the review 
should be and what the main comparison will be.
2 Describe intervention considerations in the review protocol
Describe the intervention and its relevant components (if multicomponent) and 
characteristics in the protocol. Relevant protocol sections might include: the review 
question, background, search terms, eligibility criteria, data items, and quantitative 
synthesis plans.
Conducting the review
3 Extract intervention details as part of data extraction
Use TIDieR as a guide to the essential intervention characteristics to include in the 
data extraction form and extract accordingly.
4 Request missing intervention details
When feasible, request missing details from the authors, using TIDieR as a guide to 
which details to request, and note when details are not available.
5 Consider intervention characteristics during statistical analyses and exploration of 
heterogeneity when appropriate
Where appropriate and feasible, consider intervention characteristics as specified in 
the protocol when grouping studies, conducting analyses, and exploring 
heterogeneity.
Reporting the review
6 Report intervention details in a summary table
Provide a table that summarises the intervention details for each study (see template 
in web extra 1 and example in table 1).
7 Share intervention materials where possible
Where intervention materials are available, share or provide their location details in 
the review’s intervention summary table.
8 Describe implications for future research
If the summary of intervention details reveals important gaps in existing research or if 
the analyses identify a significant association between effect and the presence or 
absence of intervention components or characteristics, then describe the future 
research implications of this in the review

Data extraction
Protocols should include plans for collecting sufficient 
details about the interventions so that they can be 
described adequately. TIDieR items can be used as a 
guide to which intervention characteristics should be 
incorporated into the data extraction form.
Missing information
Because trial reports often do not adequately describe 
interventions but trial authors can provide missing 
details,17 review authors should plan at the protocol 
stage to request missing intervention details from 
investigators.
Statistical analyses, such as subgroup,  
dose-response, and meta-regression
Decisions about appropriate inclusion and grouping 
of studies for analyses often requires knowledge of the 
characteristics of the interventions that were studied. 
When there is a reason to believe that differences in 
intervention characteristics (for example, the dose) 
might lead to different effects, these differences should 
be identified in the protocol, together with the basis 
for the assumptions that they might modify the effect, 
the expected direction of effect modification, and a 
plan for undertaking a subgroup analysis or sensitivity 
analysis. In network meta-analyses, creating nodes 
can be difficult if the interventions are not sufficiently 
described.
Recommendation 3—Extract intervention details as part 
of the data extraction process
As specified in the protocol, in the data extraction 
stage, review authors should extract details of the 
essential intervention characteristics (guided by 
TIDieR items) for each included study.
Recommendation 4—Request missing intervention 
details
If, after extracting intervention details from the primary 
studies and other available sources (such as online 
supplements or trial websites), intervention details are 
missing, review authors should request the missing 
details from the authors, where feasible. When review 
authors attempt to contact trial authors and either do 
not receive a response or find that intervention details 
are unable to be shared, this should be noted in the 
review to alert readers This might inform their choice 
of intervention and also save them from trying to 
obtain details in vain.
Recommendation 5—Consider intervention 
characteristics during statistical analyses and 
exploration of heterogeneity when appropriate
When considering reasons for heterogeneity in review 
results, having sufficient information about the 
characteristics of the interventions evaluated might be 
very important. Where appropriate, decisions about 
grouping studies and conducting analyses should 
incorporate knowledge of intervention details as 
specified in the protocol.
Recommendation 6—Report intervention details in a 
summary table
Review authors should provide a table that summarises 
the intervention details for each study (see example in 
table 1 and the blank table provided as a template in 
web extra 1). The column headings are based on the 
TIDieR items. A summary table serves a few purposes; 
it helps readers to compare the characteristics of the 
interventions and consider those that may be feasible 
for implementation in their setting; it highlights 
interventions that have missing or unavailable 
details; it shows which trials did not specify certain 
characteristics as part of the intervention; and it 
highlights characteristics that have not been studied in 
existing trials. 
Review authors should list all trials and not 
omit those that provided evidence that a certain 
intervention was not effective. Knowing the details of 
an intervention that was not effective can inform future 
research. Moreover, it is helpful for readers to know 
that a particular implementation of the intervention 
in a specific context or when compared to a specific 
control did not work—context might be particularly 
important for non-drug interventions.
Recommendation 7—Share intervention materials
During the review process, the authors might 
gather intervention materials, such as educational 
materials provided to trial participants as part of the 
intervention from trial authors. These materials are 
the most common missing element of intervention 
descriptions,1 even though interventions cannot 
be faithfully implemented without them. If review 
authors have obtained permission to do so, these 
materials should be deposited in online repositories 
(such as Figshare, Dryad, Open Science Framework, 
or OpenTrials) or uploaded as online supplementary 
materials of the review, and their availability and 
location should be indicated in the intervention 
details table in the review.
Recommendation 8—Describe implications for future 
research
Review authors should summarise the intervention 
details of included studies (such as in table 1). If 
this summary reveals important gaps in existing 
research; for example, if no or few interventions 
used a particular component (for multicomponent 
interventions) or dose (or intensity for non-drug 
interventions) or delivery method, this should inform 
the future research section of the review. Similarly, if 
analyses conducted in the review show that particular 
characteristics or components of the intervention were 
(or were not) significantly associated with effect, this 
can also inform future research. Most of the time, the 
heterogeneity in effect sizes that might be explained by 
one or more specific characteristics of an intervention 
is not definitive, as such assessments are generally 
confounded by other study features. In the discussion 
section of the review, authors should consider and 
justify the extent to which the review findings support

conclusions about whether any of the differences in 
intervention details lead to important differences in 
effects.9 10
Cochrane reviews
Authors of Cochrane intervention reviews should 
follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane 
Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards. The revised 
MECIR standards published in October 201611 
reference TIDieR as a guide for collecting and reporting 
intervention characteristics (Standards C44 and R65). 
Information about TIDieR has also been added to the 
training materials for Cochrane authors.12 Cochrane 
authors are encouraged to provide a structured account 
of intervention details in the table of “Characteristics 
of included studies.” They can provide an additional 
summary table with intervention details for each study 
(as shown in table 1, which comes from a Cochrane 
review8) and can share intervention materials gathered 
during the review (see recommendation 7 and box 1) 
as appendices to the review.
Non-Cochrane reviews
Authors of non-Cochrane reviews are encouraged 
to follow the recommendations listed in box 1. 
The relevant PRISMA-P items are listed earlier in 
recommendation 2. The relevant PRISMA items 
include: 1, title; 2, abstract; 3, rationale; 4, objectives; 
6, eligibility criteria; 8, search; 9, study selection; 
10, data collection process; 11, data items; 18, study 
characteristics; 25, limitations; and 26, conclusion 
and future research. Modification of guidance for 
the relevant PRISMA5 and PRISMA-P6 items will be 
considered when these reporting guidelines are next 
updated.
Recommendations for peer reviewers and editors of 
systematic reviews
As with other research replicability and reporting issues, 
peer reviewers and editors also have a role to play in 
helping to ensure that interventions are appropriately 
considered and reported in systematic reviews. They 
should be guided by many of the recommendations in 
box 1 and should check that interventions are clearly 
defined and their details are appropriately considered 
in analyses, are reported as completely as possible, and 
are considered in the review’s discussion, conclusions, 
and, where appropriate, the future research section.
Using the findings of a systematic review: the 
importance of knowing intervention details
New trials should be designed according to what is 
already known from systematic reviews.13 Providing 
complete intervention descriptions in systematic 
reviews is important for informing researchers as they 
develop and modify interventions to evaluate in future 
studies (see recommendation 8).
Clinicians, patients, and policy makers cannot 
implement effective interventions if details of the 
interventions are not known. Review users should be 
able to compare the details of the interventions and 
consider whether—and, if so, how—to implement 
interventions in their setting (see details in the 
elaboration of recommendation 6 and section below). 
As well as individual decisions, having appropriate 
intervention details might also influence broader 
decisions, such as those about reimbursement or 
adapting standard practices. The usability of many 
downstream evidence resources that incorporate 
systematic review findings (such as clinical guidelines 
and patient decision aids) is also influenced by 
whether the interventions are appropriately detailed in 
the review. The safety of an intervention can also be 
compromised if there is not transparency about all its 
characteristics.
Choosing which intervention to implement
We do not intend to provide guidance about methods for 
selecting interventions for clinical implementation from 
those included in a systematic review. Such decisions 
need to be informed by multiple considerations14 
including the size of the desirable effects; the size 
of the undesirable effects; the balance between 
the desirable and undesirable effects (considering 
patients’ preferences and how much people value 
the main outcomes); the certainty of the evidence; 
resource requirements; cost effectiveness; impacts on 
equity; intervention feasibility and acceptability; and 
the availability of intervention details. Because these 
considerations go beyond the evidence that is included 
in most systematic reviews, and as there is no optimal 
method of selecting a particular intervention from 
those included in a review, in most circumstances it is 
not appropriate for review authors to nominate a single 
recommended intervention. Details of approaches for 
choosing an intervention are described elsewhere.14 15 
But all approaches require detailed descriptions of 
the intervention, and some also require detailed 
descriptions of the comparator interventions.
Although review authors generally should not 
make recommendations about a single intervention, 
they might want to provide a summary paragraph 
of the known factors to consider when choosing an 
intervention. This may be particularly helpful if users 
of the review choose to follow a “single trial based 
choice” approach.15 In this approach, users examine 
the trials and consider the effects (benefits and harms) 
and risk of bias of single studies; then they consider 
the context, feasibility, and requirements of the 
various interventions. A summary table of intervention 
details (such as in the example in table 1) might help 
the user with this step. While the information that 
needs to be considered and summarised will depend 
on the intervention being reviewed, an example of the 
broad content that a summary paragraph in a review 
might follow is: “Among the [number of] trials, there 
are [number of] trials that have a low risk of bias and 
have sufficiently described interventions. All of these 
involved [list common characteristics], but there are a 
number of variations to consider, depending on [cost,

time, risk of harms, training requirements, availability, 
and so on].”
Further research
Many aspects of using and reporting intervention 
details in systematic reviews need further research. For 
example, studies should explore methods for reporting 
intervention details and for incorporating intervention 
details into forest plots so that effect sizes, risk of 
bias, intervention characteristics, and availability of 
intervention details can be considered simultaneously. 
Incorporating intervention details into the conduct 
and presentation of overviews and network meta-
analyses16 also needs exploring. The extent to which 
review authors make changes to the scope of eligible 
interventions (and how broad or narrow this is) as 
reviews progress from registration, to protocol, to 
a published review is not known. More complete 
intervention reporting at each of these stages of a 
systematic review is necessary to progress this research 
agenda. Research with end users of reviews (including 
clinicians, patients, guideline developers, and policy 
makers) to better understand how they use review 
results and which details influence their choice when 
deciding between interventions would also be valuable. 
Further research is also needed into approaches, 
such as Qualitative Comparative Analysis17 and logic 
models,18 for identifying which configurations of 
intervention characteristics and contextual features19 
are critical for successful outcomes.
Conclusion
Improving 
the 
completeness 
of 
intervention 
descriptions in systematic reviews is likely to be a cost 
effective contribution towards facilitating evidence 
implementation from reviews and reducing the research 
waste that is caused by reviews failing to consider and 
provide sufficient details about interventions. With 
implications for being able to reproduce and implement 
systematic reviews, everyone with a role in producing, 
reviewing, and publishing systematic reviews should 
commit to helping to solve this remediable barrier.
