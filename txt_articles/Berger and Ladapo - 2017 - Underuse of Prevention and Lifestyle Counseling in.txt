Abstract
Background—Little is known about patterns of medication use and lifestyle counseling in 
patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the United States.
Objective—We sought to evaluate trends in both medical therapy and lifestyle counseling for 
PAD patients in the United States from 2005 through 2012.
Methods—Data from 1,982 outpatient visits among patients with PAD were obtained from the 
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care 
Survey, a nationally representative assessment of office-based and hospital outpatient department 
practice. We evaluated trends in the proportion of visits with medication use (antiplatelet therapy, 
statins, ACE-inhibitors [ACE-I] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB], and cilostazol) and 
lifestyle counseling (exercise or diet counseling and smoking cessation).
Results—Over the 8-year period, the average annual number of ambulatory visits in the U.S. for 
PAD was 3,883,665. Across all visits, mean age was 69.2 years, 51.8% were female and 56.6% 
were Non-Hispanic white. Comorbid coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 24.3% of 
visits. Medication use for cardiovascular prevention and symptoms of claudication was low: any 
antiplatelet therapy in 35.7% (standard error [SE] 2.7), statin 33.1% (SE, 2.4), ACE-I/ARB 28.4% 
(SE, 2.0), and cilostazol in 4.7% (SE, 1.0) of visits. Exercise or diet counseling was used in 22% 
(SE, 2.3) of visits. Among current smokers with PAD, smoking cessation counseling or medication 
was used in 35.8% (SE, 4.6) of visits. There was no significant change in medication use or 
lifestyle counseling over time. Compared to visits for patients with PAD alone, comorbid PAD and

 CAD were more likely to be prescribed antiplatelet therapy (OR 2.6 [1.8–3.9]), statins (OR 2.6 
[1.8–3.9]), ACE-I/ARB (OR 2.6 [1.8–3.9]), and smoking cessation counseling (OR 4.4 [2.0–9.6]).
Conclusions—The use of guideline-recommended therapies in patients with PAD was much 
lower than expected, which highlights an opportunity to improve the quality of care in these high-
risk patients.
Keywords
PAD; Cardiovascular Prevention; Lifestyle; Epidemiology
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic syndrome with an 
estimated global population burden of ~200 million people (1). Because of the aging 
population and risk factor trends, the prevalence of PAD is increasing (2,3). Patients with 
PAD are at heightened risk for adverse cardiovascular and limb events and impaired quality 
of life (4). In fact, PAD is considered a coronary artery disease (CAD) risk equivalent (5). 
From a societal perspective, the consequences of PAD are significant (6).
Given its high prevalence and poor prognosis, and shared risk factors with CAD, a major 
goal of PAD treatment includes risk factor modification and prevention of cardiovascular 
events (7). Guideline directed therapy includes cardioprotective pharmacotherapies (i.e., 
antiplatelet therapy; statins; and blood pressure control, preferably with angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) and lifestyle 
counseling for healthy behaviors (i.e., diet, physical activity, and smoking cessation) (6,8). 
Adherence to pharmacologic and lifestyle recommendations in PAD is uncertain. Several 
studies have shown that the use of proven cardioprotective medication for secondary 
prevention in patients with PAD significantly lags behind treatment for CAD (9–12). 
Previous analyses of PAD cohorts have been limited to populations enrolled in clinical trials, 
patients admitted to the hospital, patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, or a 
single snapshot in time. Moreover, most studies of guideline adherence have focused on 
pharmacologic therapies. Effective non-pharmacologic therapies for PAD exist, including 
smoking cessation, regular physical activity and diet counseling (6,8).
There is little known about national patterns of medication use and lifestyle counseling in 
patients with PAD in the United States; the extent to which trends may be attributable to 
changing population demographics, risk factors, and provider characteristics; or whether sex 
or racial/ethnic disparities exist in its use. Examining differences in this context is important 
because differences in the use (underuse) of medical therapies and lifestyle counseling could 
contribute to poorer cardiovascular health outcomes observed in certain groups. To answer 
these questions, we used nationally representative data to explore trends in medication use 
and lifestyle counseling in the United States among patients with PAD; investigate whether 
these trends may be attributable to shifts in population demographics, clinical risk factors, 
and provider characteristics; and evaluate whether sex or racial/ethnic disparities exist in 
such patients.

 Methods
Data and Study Population
We analyzed data from the 2006–2013 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), nationally 
representative surveys of adults seeking ambulatory care.(13) We included all visits to 
office-based physicians and hospital-based outpatient clinics by adults (18 years of age or 
older; N = 418,889 adult visits). The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the NAMCS and NHAMCS annually on 
a nationally representative sample of visits to office-based physicians, hospital-based 
outpatient clinics, and emergency departments in the United States. For the NAMCS, each 
physician is randomly assigned to a 1-week reporting period during which a random sample 
of visits are surveyed systematically. Data are collected on patients’ symptoms, comorbidity, 
and demographic characteristics; physicians’ diagnoses; medications ordered or provided; 
and medical services provided. For the NHAMCS, a systematic random sample of patient 
visits in selected non-institutional general and short-stay hospitals are surveyed during a 
randomly assigned 4-week reporting period. The data collected on patient and provider 
characteristics are comparable to those collected in the NAMCS. Data on outpatient hospital 
departments and community health centers from the NHAMCS were unavailable in 2012–
2013, but the majority of ambulatory care is performed in office-based visits and captured by 
the NAMCS (93% of visits during 2006–2011 occurred in the office rather than hospital 
outpatient departments, and 99% of office visits occurred outside of community health 
centers). However, we adjusted for the absence of these 2 care sites in our regression 
analyses and used the ratio of estimates derived from 2006–2011 with and without hospital 
outpatient/community health center visits to adjust 2012–2013 estimates of care provision 
and visit volume (14).
The NAMCS and NHAMCS intake materials allow physicians and staff to record up to three 
reasons for each visit and three diagnoses related to the visit, in addition to capturing several 
other major comorbid diagnoses (coded by NCHS staff using the International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]). From 2005 to 2013, the 
physician and hospital/outpatient clinic response rates in the NAMCS and NHAMCS ranged 
from 54% to 73% (except in 2012, when NAMCS response was 39%) and 80% to 95%, 
respectively, and item nonresponse rates were generally <5% in both surveys.
Study Population and Measures
We identified patients with PAD based on visit diagnoses using ICD-9 codes, including: 
440.20–440.24, 440.29, 440.30–440.32, 440.4, 440.9, 443.81, 443.9, 445.02, and 785.4.(15) 
We used visit diagnoses and reasons for visit from our prior work to identify patients with 
other risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, CAD, and stroke (16,17). We were unable to validate our PAD diagnosis codes but 
they were extracted from an American Heart Association Scientific Statement, and the 
NAMCS/NHAMCS uses rigorous methods to review and classify data reported on Patient 
Record Forms.

 We examined physician decision-making and treatment patterns for patients with PAD 
using: 1) Multum Lexicon drug codes and therapeutic drug categories and NCHS generic 
codes for antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and prasugrel), cilostazol, 
statins, ACE-Inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), and smoking 
cessation medications (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, or bupropion); and 2) 
physicians’ reports of their provision of behavioral therapy (diet, weight loss, or exercise 
counseling) and smoking cessation therapy among smokers during the visit. A maximum of 
8 medications could be recorded for visits between 2006 and 2011 and this increased to 10 
medications in 2012–2013. We limited our accounting to the first 8 medications for each 
visit across all years for conformity but performed a sensitivity analysis in which up to 10 
medications were assessed. This sensitivity analysis did not significantly change our results.
Other Measures
To examine factors associated with diagnostic and treatment patterns, we extracted 
information on demographic characteristics including age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance 
(private, Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay/no-charge, and other/unknown), U.S. census region 
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), and urban or rural setting. We characterized patients 
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other race. In sub-analyses, 
physician specialty was divided into cardiologists and primary care physicians (general/
family practice physicians and internists) because these physicians primarily manage PAD. 
Vascular surgeons were not included in these sub-analyses because they were not identified 
in the dataset.
Statistical Analysis
We used summary statistics to estimate the prevalence of PAD and management patterns 
among patients with and without concurrent CAD. We estimated simple logistic regressions 
with year included as a continuous linear predictor to examine time trends. We also 
estimated simple logistic regression models to examine differences in care among patients 
with PAD and CAD versus PAD alone, and among patients cared for by cardiologists versus 
primary care physicians. These models also adjusted for care site, based on whether visits 
occurred in a physician office, hospital outpatient department, or community health center. 
Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for patients’ clinical risk factors and 
demographic characteristics, insurance status, geographical region, setting (urban or rural), 
and care site. Analyses accounting for specialty were limited to the NAMCS because 
specialty information was unavailable in NHAMCS. To determine whether specific patient 
and provider characteristics accounted for any overall trends we observed, we constructed 
simple logistic regression models that assessed whether demographic factors or physician 
specialty changed in prevalence over the duration of our study period. We All analyses 
accounted for the complex sampling design of the NAMCS and NHAMCS and were 
performed using Stata, version 14 (StataCorp, Inc. College Station, Texas) (18).
Results
Over the 8-year period, the average annual number of ambulatory visits in the U.S. for PAD 
was 3,750,000. The estimated number of annual visits for PAD in the United States

 increased from 2.7 million (95% CI, 1.9–3.5 million) in 2006 to 3.4 million (95% CI, 2.4–
4.4 million) in 2013. The overall prevalence of a PAD diagnosis in adults in the data set was 
0.4%. Of all visits among patients with PAD, the prevalence of PAD with concomitant CAD 
was 24.1% and did not change significantly over time (Table 1). Patient age, sex, race/
ethnicity distribution, geographic region distribution, and proportion with reported Medicare 
coverage also did not change significantly over time in patients with PAD, but the proportion 
of visits by females fell over time (P<0.01). The prevalence of cardiologist visits did not 
change over time (22% in 2006 to 21% in 2013, P = 0.88 for trend).
Pharmacologic Therapy
The proportion of visits with reported use of antiplatelet therapy was 36.3% in 2006–2007 
and 39.7% in 2012–2013, with no significant change over time (P = 0.59 for trend; Figure 
1A). Neither aspirin nor clopidogrel use changed over time. Concomitant use of dual 
antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel was infrequent (7.3% in 2006–2007 to 
7.1% in 2012–2013, P=0.38 for trend). Visits by patients with PAD and CAD were more 
likely to be on antiplatelet therapy than PAD alone (Figure 2). When stratified by coexistent 
CAD, visits for PAD without CAD reported a numerical increase in the use of any 
antiplatelet therapy (33.8% in 2006–2007 to 37.6% in 2012–2013) and aspirin (21% in 
2006–2007 to 29.5% in 2012–2013) over time, though these trends were not statistically 
significant (P = 0.72 and P = 0.38, respectively). There was no change in antiplatelet therapy 
over time in patients with concomitant PAD and CAD (44.5%–46.6%, P = 0.43 for trend).
The overall proportion of visits with reports of statin therapy was 35% (Table 2) and did not 
change significantly over time (30.5% in 2006–2007 to 38.8% in 2012–2013, P = 0.18 for 
trend; Figure 1A). The most substantial increase in statin use was observed in patients with 
PAD alone, which trended toward significance (23.6% to 35.7%, P = 0.057 for trend). The 
proportion of visits with reports of ACE-inhibitors or ARBs was 31.1% and did not change 
significantly over time (32.9% in 2006–2007 to 29.7% in 2012–2013, P = 0.51 for trend). 
Use of cilostazol was noted in 5% of all visits and did not change over time (P = 0.85 for 
trend).
Lifestyle Counseling—The proportion of patient visits with reported exercise or diet 
counseling did not change over time (18% in 2006–2007 to 12.7% in 2012–2013, P=0.23 for 
trend). In our visit sample, 20% of patients were current smokers, 51% of patients were past 
smokers, and smoking status was not reported in 29% of visits. Among smokers, smoking 
cessation counseling or pharmacotherapy was observed in 36.2% of visits and this did not 
change over time (36.8% in 2006–2007 to 38.7% in 2012–2013, P=0.96 for trend; Table 2; 
Figure 1B).
Predictors of Medication use and Lifestyle Counseling—We assessed predictors of 
medication use and lifestyle counseling using data from the 1,982 surveys among patients 
with a PAD diagnosis in 2006 through 2013 (Online Table 1). Potential predictors included 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, geographic region, setting, cardiovascular risk 
factors, comorbid cardiovascular disease, and time trend. The only significant variable 
associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy was concomitant CAD (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6,

 3.4). Significant variables associated with statin use were dyslipidemia (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.2, 
5.1) and concomitant CAD (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0, 2.4). Use of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs was 
associated with dyslipidemia (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.5), diabetes (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4), 
and hypertension (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2, 3.0). We found no significant predictors for 
cilostazol use. Medication use did not differ over time in multivariate analyses.
Exercise or diet counseling was associated with obesity (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.1, 6.1) and 
hypertension (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9, 2.7) although the latter failed to reach statistical 
significance. Use of smoking cessation advice or medications was less likely in subjects ≥65 
years of age (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1, 0.7), non-whites (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1, 0.9) and more 
likely in subjects with concomitant CAD (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6, 7.4). Lifestyle counseling did 
not differ over time in multivariate analyses (Online Table 1).
Physician Type—Since quality of care can be dependent by physician type,(19) we sought 
to investigate medication use and lifestyle counseling by practicing physician. Specialty data 
is not available in NHAMCS (hospital outpatient) and thus a separate sensitivity analysis 
was performed with NAMCS (physician office) data. Cardiologists and primary care 
physicians were the most likely groups taking care of these patients. As noted in Figure 3, 
PAD visits with a cardiologist were more likely to be on antiplatelet therapy, statins, ACE-
inhibitors or ARBs, and more frequently counselled for smoking cessation (P<0.05 for all). 
After multivariate analysis, antiplatelet therapy was significantly more likely to be used in 
PAD when seen by a cardiologist (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 2.9). Use of statins, ACE-inhibitors 
or ARBs, and lifestyle counseling were not significantly different between groups.
Discussion
Peripheral artery disease is an increasingly common medical problem, and numerous clinical 
studies and guidelines have focused on its optimal treatment. To investigate the use of 
clinical guidelines, it is important to monitor physician practice patterns. The NAMCS and 
the NHAMCS provide unique insights into the clinical management of PAD in the United 
States over time. In the present study, we examined a representative sample of visits to 
physicians in the United States between 2006 and 2013 among patients with PAD. The 
proportion of visits reporting use of medical therapy and lifestyle counseling was low and 
appears suboptimal in consideration of the substantial benefit of secondary cardiovascular 
prevention and lifestyle counseling. These findings suggest that a considerable proportion of 
patients with PAD disease remain at increased risk for adverse outcomes.
Our findings clearly show the underuse of cardiovascular prevention medication in patients 
with PAD. It has been well documented that antiplatelet therapy and statins significantly 
reduce incident cardiovascular events in PAD (6,7). Although use of antiplatelet therapy and 
statins increased from 2006 to 2013, the magnitude of this increase was less than expected 
and this increase was not significant after adjusting for demographics and clinical 
characteristics of the patients. In multivariate analysis, sex and race/ethnicity of the patient 
did not play a role in the use of secondary prevention and lifestyle counselling. While we are 
unable to determine the reason for the underuse of secondary prevention and lifestyle 
counselling, interventions to optimize secondary prevention, such as physician note

 “checklists” or other systematic prescription programs, would likely improve medication use 
and lifestyle counselling (20,21).
While some, but not all, prior studies have reported comparatively higher rates of secondary 
prevention in patients with PAD, many of these studies focused on selected patients whose 
use of secondary prevention might be higher than that in the physician office setting assessed 
here (9,11,22). Studies of hospitalized patients have shown higher rates, likely due to the 
focused clinical attention that these patients receive. Hospitalized patients, however, 
constitute a minority of all patients with PAD. Practices in community settings may be more 
likely to reflect the public health impact of lifestyle recommendations and secondary 
prevention efforts.
Similar to prior studies, we demonstrate that secondary prevention use in PAD was not 
uniform across patient subpopulations. In particular, secondary prevention was less likely to 
be reported in patients with PAD alone (without concomitant CAD). While PAD and CAD 
represent a particularly high-risk group, patients with PAD alone are still at heightened risk 
for cardiovascular and limb events and impairment in quality of life. The greater use of 
secondary prevention medication in patients with PAD and CAD may indicate a higher use 
of medication in patients with polyvascular disease or the importance of secondary 
prevention in CAD irrespective of PAD. These data suggest important barriers to the 
uniform and widespread adoption of secondary prevention in PAD. The underuse of lifestyle 
recommendations and cardiovascular prevention in this population is a major concern and 
supports the need for better awareness and education for the vascular community.
Limitations
There are important limitations of this analysis. The NAMCS and NHAMCS provide a 
limited amount of clinical information on each patient visit; there is no data on the severity 
of PAD nor could we characterize the symptom status of the patient. Our estimates of 
medication use could also be lower than expected since underreporting of medication use 
and lifestyle counseling may have occurred, in particular, aspirin and diet counseling. The 
NAMCS and NHAMCS do not capture the longitudinal experience of the individual 
patients, and because the unit of measurement is by patient visit frequent users of care may 
be overrepresented. Finally, we are unable to determine specific reasons that patients are not 
taking medications, such as adverse drug reactions or patient preference. Thus, determining 
appropriateness of care is difficult. In addition, it may have been more appropriate to 
compare our patients with PAD and concurrent CAD to patients with CAD alone, but our 
analysis did not incorporate the latter cohort.
Conclusions
This analysis suggests that use of secondary prevention and lifestyle counseling in patients 
with PAD has not become a widely disseminated practice in the United States, a finding 
consistent with a global pattern (9,11,12). Our study identifies important targets for 
immediate improvement of health care outcomes in patients with PAD. New health care 
system strategies are required to ensure adequate resource utilization in patients with PAD.

 While much attention is focused on novel therapies in PAD, a refocus on established 
therapies and healthy behaviors is clearly needed. Attempts to increase patient and physician 
awareness of the benefits of lifestyle recommendations and secondary prevention may be 
necessary. In addition, systems of chronic disease management in which the use of nurses, 
other health care providers, or information systems complements the role of physicians also 
may be helpful. Finally, efforts to monitor the prevention practices taking care of PAD 
patients may provide new incentives for quality care. The personal, societal, and financial 
burdens of preventable deterioration of patients with PAD suggest that a substantial 
investment in such strategies may be warranted. Future research aimed at improving 
secondary prevention and lifestyle counseling in patients with PAD are certainly needed.

 Clinical Perspectives
Competency in Systems-Based Practice
Guideline-recommended measures for lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events are utilized in fewer than half the patients with peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) managed in ambulatory care practice.
Translational Outlook
More work is needed to develop systems of care that promulgate evidence-based 
interventions to improve clinical outcomes in this high-risk patient population.
