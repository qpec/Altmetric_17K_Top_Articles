ABSTRACT
Constipation is one of the most prevalent conditions in primary care settings and increases the risk of
cardiovascular disease, potentially through processes mediated by altered gut microbiota. However, little
is known about the association of constipation with CKD. In a nationwide cohort of 3,504,732 United States
veterans with an eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, we examined the association of constipation status and
severity (absent, mild, or moderate/severe), defined using diagnostic codes and laxative use, with incident
CKD, incident ESRD, and change in eGFR in Cox models (for time-to-event analyses) and multinomial
logistic regression models (for change in eGFR). Among patients, the mean (SD) age was 60.0 (14.1) years
old; 93.2% of patients were men, and 24.7% were diabetic. After multivariable adjustments, compared
with patients without constipation, patients with constipation had higher incidence rates of CKD (hazard
ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.11 to 1.14) and ESRD (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01 to
1.18) and faster eGFR decline (multinomial odds ratios for eGFR slope ,210, 210 to ,25, and 25 to ,21
versus 21 to ,0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.20; 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.09; and
1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03, respectively). More severe constipation associated with an incrementally higher
risk for each renal outcome. In conclusion, constipation status and severity associate with higher risk of
incident CKD and ESRD and with progressive eGFR decline, independent of known risk factors. Further
studies should elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

CKD is a growing public health problem due to its
increasing prevalence and strong association with
cardiovascular disease, ESRD, and mortality.1 Al-
though some risk factors of CKD, such as diabetes
mellitus and hypertension,2 have been established,
the identification of novel risk factors and interven-
tions applicable to primary care settings may help
to ameliorate the risk for subsequent adverse out-
comes and reduce the global burden of CKD.
Constipation is the prototype of functional gas-
trointestinaldisordersandoneofthemostprevalent
conditions encountered in primary care settings.
Approximately 30% of the general population
experience problems with constipation during their
lifetime,3 with elderly people and women being
mostly affected. The chronic symptoms of constipa-
tion impair patients’ quality of life and may impose a

 substantial economic burden on patients and society.4,5 Further-
more, recent observational studies have shown an association of
chronic constipation with increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease6,7 and suggested the possible involvement of chronic in-
flammation caused by altered gut microbiota as an underlying
mechanismfor the association.6,7 It isplausible that constipation
may also be a risk factor for the development of CKD, potentially
mediated by altered gut microbiota or other intermediate risk
factors, such as diabetes, use of nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory
drugs, or lack of physical exercise, which have been associated
with both constipation6,8 and CKD progression2,9–11; however,
to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have examined the
association between constipation and the risk of CKD.
In this study, we hypothesized that patients with constipa-
tionareathigher riskofincidentkidneydiseaseandmorelikely
toexperiencerapiddeclineofkidney functionandthatpatients
with more severe constipationwould have a greater riskof such
events than those with less severe constipation. To test these
hypotheses, we investigated the association of constipation
status and its severity with incident CKD and ESRD along
with change in eGFR using a large nationally representative
cohort of United States veterans with eGFR of $60 ml/min per
1.73 m2.
RESULTS
Patients’ baseline characteristics overall and those in patients
categorized by constipation status are shown in Table 1. The
mean age at baseline was 60.0 years old (SD=14.1); 93.2% were
men, 15.3% were black, and 24.7% were diabetic. The mean
eGFR was 83.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (SD=15.6). Compared
with patients without constipation, those with constipation
were older and more likely to be black, had a higher prevalence
of comorbidities except HIV/AIDS and a lower per capita in-
come, and were less likely to be married. They also had more
frequent health care encounters and longer cumulative length
of hospitalization during the 2-year baseline period. The use of
angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II re-
ceptor blockers, statins, antidepressants, nonopioid analgesics,
and opioids and the administration of influenza vaccination(s)
were more common in patients with constipation. Baseline
characteristics were well balanced in the propensity-matched
cohort (Table 1).
Incident CKD
During a median follow-up of 7 years, there were a total of
360,541 events of incident CKD (crude rate, 17.2 per 1000
patient-years; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 17.2 to
17.3), including 46,022 (crude rate, 33.9 per 1000 patient-
years; 95% CI, 33.6 to 34.2) and 314,519 (crude rate, 16.1
per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 16.0 to 16.1) events in patients
with and without constipation, respectively. As depicted in
Figure 1A, patients with constipation had a higher cumulative
incidence of CKD (log rank P,0.001). Figure 2A shows the
association between constipation status and incident CKD in
unadjusted and adjusted models. In the crude model, the pres-
ence of constipation was associated with a higher risk of in-
cident CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 2.06 to 2.10).
Although adjustment for covariates resulted in the attenuation
of this association, the risk of incident CKD remained signif-
icantly higher in patients with constipation (adjusted HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.14). Compared with patients with
absent constipation, those with more severe constipation
showed incrementally higher associations with the incidence
of CKD: log rank P,0.001 (Figure 1A); fully adjusted HRs,
1.10; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.12 and 1.16; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.18 for
mild and moderate/severe constipation, respectively (Supple-
mental Figure 1A).
Incident ESRD
A total of 7677 patients developed ESRD (crude rate, 0.39 per
1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.40), including 902 (crude
rate, 0.65 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.70) and
6775 (crude rate, 0.37 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 0.36 to
0.38) events in patients with and without constipation, respec-
tively. Cumulative incidence of ESRD was higher in patients
with (versus without) constipation (log rank P,0.001) (Figure
1B). Patients with constipation had a significantly higher risk
of incident ESRD (adjusted HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.18)
(Figure 2B). With increasing constipation severity, a higher
cumulative incidence of ESRD (Figure 1B) as well as a greater
risk of incident ESRD (Supplemental Figure 1B) were also
observed.
Change in eGFR
Among 3,242,681 patients in the eGFR slope analysis, 119,165
(3.7%), 189,792 (5.9%), and 905,877 (27.9%) experienced
decline in eGFR of ,210, 210 to ,25, and 25 to ,21
ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year, respectively, whereas 1,378,842
patients (42.5%) had stable or increasing eGFR ($0 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 per year) (Supplemental Table 1). Figure 2C shows
the association between constipation status and change in
eGFR. Compared with patients without constipation, those
with constipation were at a greater risk of experiencing
more progressive eGFR decline, with higher risks seen in pa-
tients with faster eGFR decline (adjusted multinomial odds
ratios [MORs], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.20 for eGFR slopes
,210; 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.09 for 210 to ,25; and 1.01;
95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03 for 25 to ,21 [versus 21 to ,0] ml/min
per 1.73 m2 per year), and they also had a higher risk of in-
creasing eGFR (adjusted odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.11
for eGFR slopes $0 [versus 21 to ,0] ml/min per 1.73 m2
per year). The risk of progressive eGFR decline was higher
in patients with mild and moderate/severe constipation
than those with absent constipation (adjusted MORs of
eGFR slopes ,210 [versus 21 to ,0] ml/min per 1.73 m2
per year, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.21 and 1.30; 95% CI, 1.25
to 1.35, respectively; adjusted MORs of eGFR slopes 210 to
,25, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.10 and 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09 to

,21, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03 and 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to
1.06, respectively) (Supplemental Figure 1C). Similarly, the
risk of increasing eGFR was incrementally higher in those
with more severe constipation (adjusted odd ratios of
eGFR$0 [versus 21 to ,0] ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year,
1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.10 and 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.17
for mild and moderate/severe constipation, respectively)
(Supplemental Figure 1C).
Sensitivity Analyses
Results were similar in the various sensitivity analyses (Figure
3, Supplemental Figure 2, and Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of United States veterans with baseline
eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, we examined the association
of constipation status and its severity with incident CKD, in-
cident ESRD, and change in eGFR. We found that the presence
of constipation and the severity of constipation were associ-
ated with increased risk of incident CKD, incident ESRD, and
progressive eGFR decline. These findings were similarly ob-
served in selected subgroups and robust to sensitivity analyses
accounting for confounding by indication, competing risk,
and missing data.
The prevalence of constipation has been shown to be higher
in patients with CKD, particularly among those undergoing
dialysis, than the general population,12 mostly due to their
dietary restrictions, medications like phosphate binders, and
high prevalence of comorbidities.13 In recent years, there has
been a growing interest in the association between CKD and
intestinal environment (often referred to as “CKD-Colonic
Axis”), showing that CKD can cause significant quantitative
and qualitative alterations of gut environment, which in turn,
may contribute to the pathogenesis of CKD progression and
several CKD–related complications.14 However, these studies
have focused primarily on patients with advanced CKD, and
hence, it remains unknown whether the altered gut environ-
ment is associated with the development of de novo kidney
disease in patients with preserved kidney function. Given the
fact that gastrointestinal motility and gut environment are inter-
related and exert reciprocal effects on each other,15,16 it is plau-
sible that constipation, one of the clinical forms of altered gut
environment, can be a risk factor for kidney disease progression.
There are several potential mechanisms for the association
between constipation and the risk of adverse renal outcomes.
Recently, emerging evidence has disclosed a tight and coordi-
nated connection between gut microbiota and host nutrition,
metabolism, and immune function,17 indicating that distur-
bance of the gut microbiota is linked to the pathogenesis of
diverse illnesses, such as metabolic syndrome18 and cardiovas-
cular disease,19 through chronic inflammation and/or altered
metabolite profiles. For example, trimethylamine-N-oxide, a

derived uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sul-
fate,9 which in turn, seem to accelerate kidney disease progres-
sion by causing renal fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative
stress.23 Although a large clinical trial examining the reduction
of systemic toxin absorption through gastrointestinal sequestra-
tion via spherical carbon adsorbent AST-120 (Kremezin; Kureha
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) has failed to show a benefit toward
slowing kidney disease progression,24 adherence to the medica-
tion inthis clinicaltrialwas poor, and hence, itremains unclear if
proper administration of this or other similar products could be
renoprotective. Considering the possible existence of altered gut
microbiota in patient with constipation, these pathophysiologic
mechanisms could serve as a potential explanation for the asso-
ciation between constipation and adverse renal outcomes.
Another plausible mechanism for the observed association
may be through increased levels of serotonin. Serotonin is
synthesized in the gut and incorporated into platelets, which
when activated, release serotonin and enhance vasoconstric-
tion and thrombus formation, resulting in the development of
atherosclerotic plaques.25 Previous studies have also reported
an association between elevated plasma levels of serotonin and
increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.26 Be-
cause serotonin synthesis and release have been shown to be
increased in patients with constipation27 and those using cer-
tain laxatives,28 increased serotonin levels could also explain
the underlying pathogenesis of kidney disease progression. In
addition to these mechanisms, the use of certain types of lax-
atives may directly (e.g., through drug-induced nephrotoxi-
city) or indirectly (e.g., through dehydration or electrolyte
disturbances) cause kidney damage and could potentially con-
tribute to the increased risk of renal events.

 Interestingly, we found a significant association between
constipation and the risk of increasing eGFR. As previously
reported,29–31 increasing eGFR has been recognized as a pre-
dictor of adverse clinical outcomes through loss of muscle
mass associated with chronic debilitating conditions, and
increasing eGFR may also reflect recovery
from AKI. Although we did not measure
lean body mass and hence, precise mecha-
nisms underlying the observed associa-
tion remain speculative, the greater risk
of increasing eGFR might reflect a higher
incidence of some chronic illnesses accom-
panied by a decline in serum creatinine
among patients with constipation. Most
importantly, however, the associations of
constipation with adverse renal out-
comes still remained statistically significant
even after accounting for various potential
confounders, including comorbidities,
number of Veterans Affairs (VA) health
care encounters, and cumulative length of
hospitalization, which highlights the bio-
logically plausible link between the gut
and kidney and provides additional insights
into the pathogenesis of kidney disease
progression.
Given the high prevalence of constipa-
tion and the simplicity of its assessment in
primary care settings, our study may also
have several clinical implications. Physi-
cians should be aware of the risk of kidney
disease progression in patients with consti-
pation.Whenevaluatingapatientwithcon-
stipation and reduced kidney function in
clinical practice, it is also important for
health care providers to acknowledge the
excess risk of kidney damage caused by de-
hydrationanduse(especiallyoverthecoun-
ter use) of nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory
drugs. Careful observation of kidney func-
tion trajectory may, thus, be required in
those patients, particularly among those
with more severe constipation. Further-
more, if the relationships between consti-
pation and renal events are causal, our
findings suggest that the treatment of con-
stipation through lifestyle modifications
(e.g., exercise and high-fiber diet32,33)
and/or use of probiotics34 rather than
laxatives could potentially reduce the risk
of adverse renal outcomes and may deserve
future clinical trials.
Our study is notable for its large sample
size and being representative of veterans in
the entire geographic United States; how-
ever, several limitations need to be acknowledged. Because this
study was observational, the results do not allow us to infer
causality. It could be argued that constipation may be merely a
nonspecific marker of general illness rather than a causative
factor; however, the significant association that was robust to

 adjustment for a wide assortment of confounders combined
with plausible mechanistic explanations raise the possibility
ofacausallink betweenconstipationandrenaloutcomes. Most
of our patients were men; hence, the results may not be gen-
eralizable to women or patients from other geographic areas.
We defined our cohort on the basis of an eGFR$60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, but we did not have markers of earlier stages of CKD
(e.g., proteinuria). Because information about subjective
symptoms of constipation was not available and constipation
status and its severity were defined using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM) codes and laxative prescription records
during the 2-year baseline period, we were unable to assess
the effect of lifetime duration of constipation and its status
over the entire follow-up period on the outcomes, and pa-
tients with constipation might have been misclassified as
absent constipation or having less severe constipation. Nev-
ertheless, such misclassification would tend to bias the true
effects toward the null, and our results still showed signifi-
cant associations of constipation with increased risk of renal
events. Several statistical methods were applied in our
sensitivity analyses to address the effect
of confounders, but we cannot eliminate
the possibility of unmeasured con-
founders. In conclusion, in this large na-
tionwide cohort of .3 million United
States veterans, we found that constipa-
tion status and its severity were associated
with a higher risk of incident CKD, inci-
dent ESRD, and progressive eGFR decline,
independent of known risk factors. Addi-
tional studies are needed to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms and determine
whether the amelioration of constipation
can prevent adverse renal outcomes.
CONCISE METHODS
Cohort Definition
Our study used data from a retrospective cohort
study examining risk factors in patients with
incident CKD (the Racial and Cardiovascular
Risk Anomalies in CKD Study).35 The algorithm
for cohort definition is shown in Figure 4. We
used the national VA Corporate Data Ware-
house LabChem data files36 to extract serum
creatinine measured between October 1, 2004
and September 30, 2006 (baseline period) and identified 3,582,478
patients with baseline eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. eGFR was cal-
culated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collabora-
tion creatinine equation.37 After exclusion of patients with missing
ICD-9-CM codes (n=11,311) or erroneous data (n=66,435),
3,504,732 patients were included in our final cohort.
Data Collection
Predictors and Covariates
Constipation was defined as having either at least two diagnoses for
constipation as identified by the ICD-9-CM (Supplemental Table 4)
that were .60 days apart or two or more prescriptions of laxatives of
$30-day supply each that were 60–365 days apart during the baseline
period on the basis of information obtained from VA Pharmacy dis-
pensation records.38 Constipation severity was also quantitatively de-
fined according to the number of different types of laxatives prescribed
during the baseline period and stratified into three groups as follows:
absent (no laxative), mild (one type of laxative), or moderate/severe
(two or more types of laxatives).
Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, medica-
tion use, and laboratory characteristics were obtained as previously

 described.39,40 Briefly, information about age, sex, race, marital status
(married, single, divorced, or widowed), mean per capita income,
service connectedness, body mass index, systolic and diastolic BPs,
comorbid conditions, and medication use was obtained from various
national VA research data files.41 Prevalent comorbidities were de-
fined as the presence of relevant ICD-9-CM and Current Procedural
Terminology codes recorded from October 1, 2004 to September 30,
2006 (Supplemental Table 4).39,40 Prevalent coronary heart disease
(CHD) was defined as the presence of diagnostic codes for coronary
artery disease, angina, or myocardial infarction or procedure codes
for percutaneous coronary interventions or coronary artery bypass
grafting. Bowel disorders were defined as the presence of diagnostic
codes for inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or
diarrhea. In addition to the information derived from VA sources, we
included select socioeconomic indicators using 2004 county typology
codes (housing stress, low education, low employment, and persis-
tent poverty) (Supplemental Table 5).
Outcomes
The coprimary outcomes of interest were incident CKD, incident
ESRD, and change in eGFR. Incident CKD was defined as two
eGFR levels ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 separated by $90 days and a
.25% decrease from baseline eGFR.42 Incident ESRD was defined as
initiation of maintenance dialysis or preemptive renal transplanta-
tion occurring between the cohort entry date and September 13,
2011, the last date of available event record provided by the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS). Change in eGFR (slope) was calcu-
lated in each patient from an ordinary least squares regression model
using all outpatient eGFR measurements available from the cohort entry
date to October 13, 2012 (the last date of available serum creatinine mea-
surement) and stratified into five categories as follows: ,210, 210 to
,25, 25 to ,21, 21 to 0 (reference), and $0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per
year. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of eGFR measure-
ments used to calculate eGFR slopes was 10 (IQR, 5–17). Information
about all-cause mortality was obtained from the VAVital Status Files.43
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as number (percentage) for categorical variables
and mean6SD for continuous variables with a normal distribution
or median (IQR) for those with a skewed distribution. The start of
follow-up was the date of the first eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
during the baseline period. Patients were followed up until death or
the last date of VA contact. The associations of constipation status and
its severity with outcomes were assessed with the Kaplan–Meier
method and log rank tests and using Cox proportional hazards
models (for time to event analyses) and multinomial logistic regres-
sion models (for change in eGFR). The proportionality assumption
was tested by plotting log (2log [survival rate]) against log (survival
time) and scaled Schoenfeld residuals, and it showed no violations.
For the time to event analyses, patients were followed up until death
or censored at the date of the last encounter or October 13, 2012 and
September 13, 2011 for incident CKD and ESRD, respectively. All as-
sociations were examined in unadjusted and multivariable adjusted
models. Models were incrementally adjusted for the following con-
founders on the basis of theoretical considerations: model1, unadjusted;
model 2, adjusted for age, sex, and baseline eGFR; model 3, model 2
variables plus prevalent comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
CHD, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral
vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, rheumatic disease, malignancy,
depression, liver disease, chronic lung disease, HIV/AIDS, and bowel
disorders); model 4, model 3 variables plus baseline body mass index
and systolic and diastolic BPs; and model 5, model 4 variables plus
socioeconomic parameters (mean per capita income, marital status,
service connectedness, housing stress, low education, low employ-
ment, and persistent poverty), indicators of sickness (number of VA
health care encounters and cumulative length of hospitalization) and
quality of care (receipt of influenza vaccination[s]), and use of
angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II recep-
tor blockers, statins, antidepressants, nonopioid analgesics, and opi-
oids at baseline.
We additionally performed several sensitivity analyses. All out-
comeswereexamined in subgroups ofpatientscategorized bybaseline
age, sex, race, prevalent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, CHD, con-
gestive heart failure, eGFR, and income level. Analyses were repeated
in a propensity score–matched cohort to account for baseline differ-
ences arising from dissimilarities in clinical and demographic char-
acteristics of patients with and without constipation. Propensity
scores for the likelihood of presence versus absence of constipation
were calculated by logistic regression using all variables included in
multivariable models and performing a 1:1 nearest neighbor match-
ing without replacement. Because death and incident CKD/ESRD are
competing events, competing risk regressions were also performed
using unadjusted models in the overall cohort as well as the propensity-
matched cohort. Of the variables included in multivariable adjusted
models, data points were missing for race (9.7%), body mass index
(4.7%), BP (1.4%), per capita income (6.9%), and socioeconomic in-
dicators (4.0%). Missing values were not imputed in primary analyses
but were substituted by multiple imputation procedures using the Stata
(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) “mi” set of commands in sen-
sitivity analyses.
Because of the large sample size, the significance of differences in
the main cohort was established on the basis of considerations of
biologically or clinically meaningful differences. Differences between
variables in the overall and propensity-matched cohorts were exam-
ined by calculating standardized differences, and values .0.1 were con-
sidered significant. All of the analyses were conducted using Stata/MP
version 14 (Stata Corporation). The study was approved by the institu-
tionalreview boardsattheMemphisandLongBeachVAMedicalCenters.
