of Living with Nature

Experiences of nature provide many mental-health benefits, particularly for people living in urban areas. The natural characteristics of city 
residents’ neighborhoods are likely to be crucial determinants of the daily nature dose that they receive; however, which characteristics are 
important remains unclear. One possibility is that the greatest benefits are provided by characteristics that are most visible during the day 
and so most likely to be experienced by people. We demonstrate that of five neighborhood nature characteristics tested, vegetation cover and 
afternoon bird abundances were positively associated with a lower prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, dose–response 
modeling shows a threshold response at which the population prevalence of mental-health issues is significantly lower beyond minimum limits 
of neighborhood vegetation cover (depression more than 20% cover, anxiety more than 30% cover, stress more than 20% cover). Our findings 
demonstrate quantifiable associations of mental health with the characteristics of nearby nature that people actually experience.

T
he economic costs of anxiety and mood disorders,  
 such as depression, have been estimated at €187.4 billion 
per year for Europe alone (Gustavsson et al. 2012, Olesen 
et al. 2012). Alongside stress, they are some of the most 
prevalent work-related health issues (13.7% of all reported 
work-related cases; Eurostat 2012). This growing problem 
has, at least in part, been attributed to the increasing discon-
nect between people and the natural world that is resulting 
from more urbanized, sedentary lifestyles (the “extinction 
of experience”; Miller 2005, Soga and Gaston 2015). This is 
supported by research that shows interactions with nature 
promote psychological restoration (Kaplan 1995), improved 
mood (Hartig et al. 2003, Barton and Pretty 2010, Roe and 
Aspinall 2011), improved attention (Hartig et al. 2003, 
Ottosson and Grahn 2005) and reduced stress and anxiety 
(Ulrich et al. 1991, Grahn and Stigsdotter 2003, Hartig et al. 
2003, Maas et al. 2009).
The causal factors behind poor mental health are com-
plex and diverse (Kinderman et al. 2015), and cultural and 
socioeconomic differences between regions may influence 
responses to interactions with nature (reviewed by Keniger 
et al. 2013). Understanding and capitalizing on the mecha-
nisms by which natural environments provide psychological 
benefits nonetheless have the potential to be a novel and 
cost-effective approach to reducing the prevalence of some 
forms of mental ill health (Hartig et al. 2014, Shanahan et al. 
2015b). Indeed, nature is likely to influence mental health 
through a range of mechanistic pathways (Shanahan et al. 
2015b). Attention-restoration theory proposes that the natu-
ral world promotes recovery from mental fatigue that occurs 
during the performance of cognitive tasks that require the 
prolonged maintenance of directed attention (Kaplan 1995), 
whereas stress-reduction theory argues that natural environ-
ments facilitate reductions in physiological arousal follow-
ing stress (Ulrich et al. 1991). Both of these complementary 
theoretical frameworks lead to improved mental health 
from experiencing nature through decreased rumination, 
increased cognition, and reduced stress (Berman et al. 2012, 
Jiang et al. 2014, Tyrväinen et al. 2014, Bratman et al. 2015).
Increasingly, evidence suggests that the availability and 
quality of neighborhood green spaces are associated with 
greater well-being (White et al. 2013) and lower levels of 
depression, anxiety, and stress (Beyer et al. 2014). These 
benefits may be gained from intentionally interacting with 
nature (e.g., through visiting neighborhood green spaces 
or spending time in a garden), from incidental interactions 
whereby people are exposed to nature as they engage in other 
activities (e.g., walking to the shops), or indirectly while not 
actually being present in nature (e.g., viewing it through 
a window; Keniger et al. 2013). The natural environment

around the home is the nature that most people will expe-
rience every day and therefore, through all three kinds of 
nature interactions, will significantly contribute toward 
people’s daily nature experience.
To date, most research into the health benefits of nature 
has considered the role of green spaces per se. The role of 
specific biological components of those spaces remains 
unclear, although these need to be identified effectively 
to guide planning to operationalize the use of nature as 
a health-promoting tool. In urban areas, two of the most 
visible elements of nature are vegetation cover and bird 
communities. The presence of vegetation has been found 
to have positive mental-health benefits, including but not 
limited to helping to reduce stress and promoting restora-
tion from mental fatigue (e.g., Fuller et al. 2007, Alvarsson 
et al. 2010, Dallimer et al. 2012). Having more bird species 
in the environment and watching birds have been shown to 
be good for people’s psychological well-being (Fuller et al. 
2007, Curtin 2009, Brock et al. 2015, Cox and Gaston 2016), 
whereas listening to bird song has been shown to contribute 
toward perceived attention restoration and stress recovery 
(Ratcliffe et al. 2013).
Previous studies investigating the relationship between 
components of biodiversity and psychological well-being 
have focused on measuring absolute diversity (how much 
diversity is estimated actually to be present; Fuller et al. 
2007, Luck et al. 2011) and/or the diversity that people per-
ceive to be present (Dallimer et al. 2012, Shwartz et al. 2014, 
Belaire et al. 2015). However, these may not reflect the bio-
diversity that people actually experience. In particular, daily 
activity levels of people and other organisms often differ, 
so understanding the well-being effects of the diversity that 
people actually experience requires consideration of lower 
than actual values.
Here, we address two key questions. First, what compo-
nents of nature are linked to positive mental-health out-
comes? To answer this, we explore the relationships between 
three established self-reported measures of mental health for 
depression, anxiety, and stress and five metrics of neighbor-
hood nature (vegetation cover, estimated actual abundance 
and richness of birds, and the abundance and richness of 
birds that people are likely to experience). Our second ques-
tion is whether there is a threshold in the mental-health 
response. To answer this, we use dose–response modeling to 
estimate the point at which neighborhood vegetation cover (a 
tangible component of nature that relevant stakeholders can 
manage) influences the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and 
stress and the reduction in prevalence that could be achieved 
through enhanced exposure across the urban population.
Assessment of mental health and the participants
We delivered an urban lifestyle questionnaire online (see 
Shanahan et al. 2016 for details) through a market research 
company (Shape the Future Ltd) to 1023 adults enrolled in 
their survey database. All the participants lived within the 
urban limits of the “Cranfield triangle,” a region in southern 
England, United Kingdom, comprising the three adjacent 
towns of Milton Keynes, Luton, and Bedford. Together, 
they constitute an urbanized area of approximately 157 
square kilometers and an urban population of approximately 
524,000 (according to the 2011 UK census). The triangle 
represents great variation in human population density 
(including examples of low- and high-density living), urban 
history, and urban form. The survey was delivered in May 
2014, a period of reasonably mild weather when the respon-
dents were most likely to engage with nature around their 
home, so the benefits of nature may be more pronounced. 
The participants were self-selecting and were compensated 
with either a nominal fee or a prize draw entry (see supple-
mental appendix S1 for ethical clearance). A subset of 263 
respondents for whom there was both vegetation and bird 
survey data was then used in the analysis (see the metrics of 
neighborhood nature section below).
The survey respondents were asked to complete the 
short version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 
(DASS 21; Lovibond and Lovibond 1995). On a four-point 
scale, the respondents rated the extent to which each of 21 
statements applied to them over the previous week (seven 
statements each for depression, anxiety, and stress; supple-
mental table S2a). To characterize the degree of severity 
for each mental disorder relative to the wider population, 
these scores were summed for each disorder before band-
ing as normal, mild, moderate, severe, or extremely severe 
(table S2b; Lovibond and Lovibond 1995). If a respondent 
did not score a statement, then the relevant disorder for 
that respondent was discarded from the analysis (remaining 
respondents; depression = 248, anxiety = 259, stress = 240).
The survey collected sociodemographic and personal 
circumstance data that could potentially influence mental 
health, including age, gender, the primary language spoken 
at home, personal annual income, the number of days exer-
cised for 30 minutes or more during the survey week (an 
an indicator of physical activity), self-assessment of health, 
and highest formal qualification. As a potential confound of 
recent nature exposure, we asked the respondents relatively 
how much time they spent out of doors in the previous week 
(supplemental table S1 shows how these variables were used 
for analysis). The respondents were requested to provide 
a full UK postcode so that their neighborhood could be 
characterized (one UK postcode covers approximately 20 
households). On the basis of the postcode, the English Index 
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was used to assess the level 
of socioeconomic disadvantage (sharegeo.ac.uk; data sourced 
from data.gov.uk). Finally, using the UK Gridded Population 
Based on the Census 2011 and Land Cover Map 2007 (Reis 
et al. 2016), we calculated neighborhood population density 
(see supplemental appendix S2 for full description of these 
two variables).
Metrics of neighborhood nature
We measured five key components of nature that people 
were exposed to around the home. We first measured

neighborhood vegetation cover as vegetation 0.7 meters (m) 
or more in height, within a 250 m buffer around the centroid 
of each respondent’s postcode, approximately reflecting 
the viewscape from and the area immediately adjacent to 
people’s homes. Vegetation cover maps were derived from 
airborne hyperspectral and light detection and ranging 
(LiDAR) data; full details of the spatial product development 
are provided in the supplemental appendix S3.
We conducted extensive bird surveys within the towns 
to generate a further four metrics of neighborhood nature. 
We estimated actual bird abundance and species richness as 
that recorded during early-morning surveys, when birds are 
most active and so most likely to be recorded (supplemental 
appendix S4). We also estimated the bird abundance and 
species richness that people were likely to experience as 
those birds that were recorded during afternoon surveys 
when most people are also active (appendix S4). These 
were derived from point count surveys, using distance sam-
pling, at up to four locations within 116 tiles, each of 500 
m × 500 m squares that were selected randomly across the 
three towns (full details are provided in appendix S4). We 
estimated neighborhood bird abundances and richness for 
those respondents whose 250-m neighborhood buffer over-
lapped with at least one bird survey location within a survey 
tile (respondents = 263; tiles = 84; see supplemental table 
S3 for sociodemographics of subset; supplemental figure S1 
illustrates an example of overlap). This subset of respondents 
was used in subsequent analyses.
The neighborhood vegetation cover varied ninefold across 
the 263 respondents (supplemental table S4). Pearson’s rank 
sum tests of the five metrics of neighborhood nature showed 
that actual and afternoon species richness were highly cor-
related (Pearson’s r = 0.72, p < .0001), whereas the remain-
ing nature variables were either weakly or not correlated 
(r < 0.28; see supplemental table S5 for correlation matrix 
between nature variables).
Relationships between mental health and 
neighborhood nature
We used ordinal regression to explore relationships between 
the five metrics of neighborhood nature and each mental-
health disorder in turn. We incorporated age, gender, lan-
guage, income, physical activity, self-assessment of health, 
level of education, relative time out of doors in the previ-
ous week, neighborhood population density and the IMD 
as covariates. We standardized the five nature metrics and 
neighborhood population density such that each had mean 
zero and standard deviation one. Because multicollinear-
ity of more than 0.7 can severely distort model estimation 
(e.g., Dormann et al. 2013, Cade 2015), we built two models 
for each mental state, including either actual or afternoon 
species richness in each along with the other three nature 
metrics and covariates. We used the Multi-Model Inference 
(MuMIn) package (Bartoń 2015) to produce all subsets of 
models on the basis of the global model and to rank them 
on the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). 
Overdispersion in models is problematic in AICc analysis 
and may be due to not accounting for important covari-
ates or multicollinearity, which can result in the selection 
of overly complex models that can lead to poor inference. 
Following Burnham and Anderson (2002, p. 131) and 
Richards (2008), we reduced the retention of overly complex 
models by excluding from the set of candidate models all 
models that are more complicated versions of any model 
with a lower AICc value (i.e., nesting of models). To be 95% 
sure that the most parsimonious models were maintained 
within the best-supported model set, we then retained all 
models in which ΔAICc < 6 (Richards 2005, 2008). We 
then calculated averaged parameter estimates and standard 
errors using model averaging among the retained models 
(Burnham and Anderson 2002).
People living in neighborhoods with higher levels of veg-
etation cover and afternoon bird abundances had reduced 
severity of depression, anxiety, and stress (table 1; figure 1). 
In contrast, there was no relationship with the estimated 
actual neighborhood bird abundance and species richness 
or afternoon species richness (table 1). The respondents 
who spent less time outdoors than usual in the last week had 
worse depression and anxiety (table 1). The respondents 
over the age of 45 years were less likely to suffer from depres-
sion than the younger respondents, whereas those between 
46 and 60 years were less likely to suffer from anxiety 
(table 1). Mental health was positively correlated with self-
reported physical health (table 1; inherent bias within self-
reported surveys is here, at least in part, mitigated through 
large sample sizes and a robust ordinal regression analytical 
approach).
Here, we have shown that metrics of nature that were 
most visible during the day and so most likely to be expe-
rienced by people, namely vegetation cover and afternoon 
bird abundances, were positively associated with a lower 
population prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress. 
This may have arisen for a range of nonmutually exclusive 
reasons. First, experiences of visible nature may act to 
improve people’s mental health, as was predicted from pre-
vious empirical studies of interactions between nature and 
well-being (see our introduction for references). Second, 
people with no or low mental-health disorders may be 
self-selected by electing to move into neighborhoods that 
are greener. Third, they may provide resources for birds, 
thereby increasing opportunities for closer interactions 
throughout the day. Therefore, it is unclear whether a lower 
population prevalence of poor mental health is shaped by 
the natural environment people live in or whether people 
move to a neighborhood that reflects that trait, or whether 
it is some combination of these factors. However, we found 
no relationship with the metrics estimating actual bird 
community composition or actual or afternoon species 
richness, nor were there relationships between mental 
health and covariates such as the IMD, education, or 
population density, although this is not entirely unsurpris-
ing given the complex nature of mental-health disorders

and that previous studies have recorded wide variation 
in these relationships across different human populations 
(e.g., Das et al. 2007). The difference in the associations 
of actual and visable bird abundance with mental health is 
indicative of an effect of visible nature on mental health. 
Notwithstanding, future research needs to focus on further 
unpicking causal pathways, such as through studies of 
brain activity and function during exposure to nature (e.g., 
Bratman et al. 2012, 2015).
The shape of the relationships between vegetation cover 
and the increasing severity of each mental-health disorder 
suggests that the greatest benefits were gained by those 
respondents with mild or moderate mental-health disorders 
(figure 1). This may be because the severity of depression 
often determines behaviors and therefore the degree to 
which people engage with nature. So people suffering from 
severe mental-health disorders may be less likely to venture 
outdoors, and the mechanisms behind their disorders may 
be different, thereby reducing the positive influence of 
nature. The respondents who spent relatively less time out 
doors in the survey week were more likely to report worse 
depression and anxiety. Intriguingly, this suggests that the 
relative nature experienced is a significant contribuing 
factor.

We found no relationship between mental health and 
either measure of bird richness or that of actual abun-
dance. Given that most people cannot distinguish between 
species (Dallimer et al. 2012, Shwartz et al. 2014) benefits 
may be provided through directly experiencing abun-
dance, with richness contributing when people can see 
multiple species within a relatively small timeframe, such 
as around a feeder (Cox and Gaston 2015). Although the 
positive benefits for mental health of interacting with 
birds is compelling, in this study, it was not possible to 
determine the actual abundances of birds that the respon-
dents interacted with; therefore, there may be more than 
one explanation for the positive associations between 
afternoon bird abundances and improved mental health. 
First, as seems likely, the abundances recorded by ecolo-
gists in the afternoon may be a good representation of the 
birds that most people experience and gain benefits from. 
Second, these abundances may be a proxy for another bio-
logical component.
Dose–response relationships between neighborhood 
vegetation cover and mental health
We next calculated the dose–response of each mental-
health disorder within the survey population that could 
be attributed to levels of neighborhood vegetation cover. 
We created a further three binary response variables: 
those with normal mental health for each of depression, 
anxiety, and stress and those suffering with mild or worse 
cases (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995). We used logistic 
regression for each binary response variable in turn to 
estimate the relative odds of occurrence in an individual 
given specific risk factors that were statistically significant 
in the previous analysis. Each covariate (i.e., risk factor) 
was transformed into a binary factor conveying high 
versus low risk (see supplemental table S6). For each 
mental-health disorder, we ran multiple logistic regres-
sion models. The first model contained the risk factors 
described above with the binary factor vegetation cover 
set at 10%, below which the risk of poor mental health was

considered high. The model was then repeated applying an 
incrementally increased break point in vegetation cover 
(i.e., less than 15%, less than 20%, less than 25%, 30%, and 
less than 35%). We identified the point at which the health 
gains were first recorded as better than the null model on 
a plot of dose versus the odds ratio for use in the analysis 
described below (i.e., the confidence interval did not over-
lap with an odds ratio of one).
For each mental-health disorder, we calculated the 
population average attributable fraction to estimate the 
proportion of cases in the population attributable to each 
of the predictor variables (or risk factors; e.g., Rueckinger 
et al. 2009). Each risk factor was removed sequentially 
from the population by classifying every individual as low 
risk. The probability of each person experiencing mild or 
worse depression, anxiety, or stress was then calculated, 
in which the sum of all probabilities across the population 
was the adjusted number of disease cases expected if the 
risk factor were not present. The attributable fraction was 
calculated by subtracting this adjusted number of cases 
from the observed number of cases. The risk factors were 
removed in every possible order, and an average attribut-
able fraction from all analyses was obtained (table 2).
After accounting for covariates, the odds of having mild 
or worse depression were significantly lower when neigh-
borhood vegetation cover reached a threshold of 20%, with 
gains in the odds ratio of 0.35 by 35% vegetation cover 
(figure 2a). There was a significantly lower chance of hav-
ing anxiety and stress after 30% and 20% vegetation cover 
respectively, although there was greater variability in the 
dose–response curve (figure 2b and 2c). The power of the 
tests for all three mental-health disorders was reduced at 
higher levels of vegetation cover (indicated by wider 95% 
confidence intervals) because the proportion of the respon-
dents reporting poor mental health declined at these levels; 
increasing the number of respondents may reduce the vari-
ability in the dose–response curves.
This threshold analysis has important implications for 
setting future research directions toward operationalizing 
nature as a tool for improving health and well-being for pop-
ulations. Although there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all 
policy for optimizing nature in cities, establishing minimum 
levels of vegetation cover in neighborhoods is a practical 
approach that could be incorporated into city design.
The results suggest that if all the respondents lived in 
neighborhoods with vegetation cover of more than 20%, 
then the total number showing symptoms of depression 
would be reduced by up to 11%. The number of cases of 
anxiety and stress could be reduced by up to 25% and 17% 
if vegetation cover were more than 30% and more than 20%, 
respectively. Within the survey population, 38%, 76%, and 
38% of the respondents were considered at risk of showing 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively, 
because neighborhood vegetation cover levels were not met. 
In 2007, it was estimated that depression cost the English 
economy £7.5 billion, and anxiety cost £8.9 billion in health 
costs and lost workdays (McCrone et al. 2008). Although the 
causes of poor mental health are diverse, a simplistic calcula-
tion would be that if minimal levels of neighborhood vegeta-
tion cover were met, it has the potential to contribute toward 
an annual saving of up to £0.5 billion and £2.6 billion per 
year for depression and anxiety alone. Doubtless, the finan-
cial implications are marked. Consequently, manipulation of 
neighborhood vegetation and bird populations to “optimal” 
levels can and should be encouraged to be undertaken by 
both private and public stakeholders. There are multiple 
approaches available, including through the innovative addi-
tion of green infrastructure such as tree planting, through 
the addition of green walls and roofs (Tzoulas et al. 2007), 
or through the provision of supplementary food and nest-
ing locations to increase local bird abundances (Fuller et al. 
2008) and to bring birds into closer contact with people.
Research is starting to tease apart the mechanistic pathways 
behind how different components of nature benefit mental

Note: We show a positive association between a reduced population prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress and minimal thresholds of 
neighborhood vegetation cover* (depression more than 20% cover, anxiety more than 30% cover, stress more than 20% cover). An odds ratio 
above 1 indicates that the mental-health disorder is more likely to be present where the risk factor is present.

health (e.g., Bratman et al. 2015, Shanahan et al. 2015a). 
Although this study does not demonstrate causation per se, 
the positive relationships between two metrics of neighbor-
hood nature and better mental health are consistent with a 
mechanistic effect. Indeed, the dose–response relationship 
for depression—and to a lesser extent, anxiety and stress—is 
considered to provide some evidence of causality according 
to Hill’s criteria (Hill 1965). These benefits are likely to be 
provided via two pathways: first by increasing the attractive-
ness and appeal of green space such that people are more 
likely to spend time out of doors and therefore increase the 
likelihood that they will engage in physical or social activi-
ties, and second by increasing the visual complexity of the 
landscape, enhancing its effect on mental restoration and 
well-being (Shanahan et al. 2015b). However, at the same 
time, it is important to acknowledge that living close to too 
much, or inappropriate, nature can also provide a range of 
dis-services, such as the destruction of property from veg-
etation and breeding birds (e.g., Rock 2005) or increased 
levels of vegetation leading to feelings of decreased safety in 
some neighborhoods (e.g., Kuo et al. 1998). Future research 
into “best” doses of nature would benefit from exploring the 
trade-offs between the benefits and dis-services.
Conclusions
Although the causes and drivers of poor mental health 
are diverse (Kinderman et al. 2015), this study suggests 
that even low levels of key components of neighborhood 
nature can be associated with better mental health, provid-
ing promise for preventative health approaches. This study 
shows that quantifiable reductions in the population preva-
lence of poor mental health can be achieved if minimal 
thresholds of vegetation cover are met. This has important 
implications for policy to set minimum levels of neighbor-
hood nature and paves the way to test for health gains that 
arise from specific interventions. Obviously, optimized 
levels of nature are not a silver bullet for the prevention or 
treatment of mental-health problems, but it is an approach 
that can and should be applied in conjunction with existing 
frameworks such as medical and social services, reducing 
crime, and increasing community-driven action. Indeed, 
optimizing the key components of nearby nature has been 
shown to change behavior toward increased social cohe-
sion (e.g., Weinstein et al. 2015) and green exercise (e.g., 
Mitchell and Popham 2008).
