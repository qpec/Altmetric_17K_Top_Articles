Abstract
Background: Nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU) refers to the self-treatment of a medical condition using
medication without a prescriber’s authorization as well as use to achieve euphoric states. This article reports data
from a cross-national investigation of NMPDU in five European Countries, with the aim to understand the prevalence
and characteristics of those engaging in NMPDU across the EU.
Methods: A parallel series of self-administered, cross-sectional, general population surveys were conducted in 2014.
Data were collected using multi-stage quota sampling and then weighted using General Exponential Model. A total
of 22,070 non-institutionalized participants, aged 12 to 49 years, in 5 countries: Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Spain,
and Sweden. Lifetime and past-year nonmedical use of prescription medications such as stimulants, opioids,
and sedatives were ascertained via a modified version of the World Health Organization’s Composite International
Diagnostic Interview. Information about how the medications were acquired for NMPDU were also collected
from the respondent.
Results: Lifetime and past-year prevalence of nonmedical prescription drug use was estimated for opioids (13.5 and
5.0 %), sedatives (10.9 and 5.8 %), and stimulants (7.0 and 2.8 %). Germany exhibited the lowest levels of NMPDU, with
Great Britain, Spain, and Sweden having the highest levels. Mental and sexual health risk factors were associated with
an increased likelihood of past-year nonmedical prescription drug use. Among past-year users, about 32, 28, and 52 %
of opioid, sedative, and stimulant nonmedical users, respectively, also consumed illicit drugs. Social sources (sharing by
friends/family) were the most commonly endorsed methods of acquisition, ranging from 44 % (opioids) to 62 %
(sedatives). Of interest is that Internet pharmacies were a common source of medications for opioids (4.1 %), stimulants
(7.6 %), and sedatives (2.7 %).
Conclusions: Nonmedical prescription drug use was reported across the five EU countries we studied, with opioids
and sedatives being the most prevalent classes of prescription psychotherapeutics. International collaborations are
needed for continued monitoring and intervention efforts to target population subgroups at greatest risk for NMDU.
Background
Nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU) typically
encompasses consumption of a medication that is not
prescribed to a user or that is consumed in a manner
not intended by the prescriber (e.g. taking higher doses,
using non-approved routes of administration). It also
captures situations in which the medication is obtained
illegally (e.g. purchased through a dealer or the Internet)
or under false pretenses (e.g. doctor shopping or feigning
symptoms). In addition to the source of acquisition and
the route of administration, the underlying motivations
for use may include using the medication for self-
treatment of a physical and/or mental health problem or
for tension reduction/relaxation/euphoria [1]. NMPDU
is among the leading public health issues in the United
States (US) [2–5]. Prescriptions written for central
nervous system (CNS) medications in the US has dra-
matically increased over the past decade, primarily in
the therapeutic classes involving opioids, sedatives, and
stimulants [6, 7]. Inspection of the number of peer-
reviewed publications and media reports focusing on
prescription drug abuse, misuse, and diversion over the
past several years suggests that NMPDU is more wide-
spread in the US than other nations, including the

 European Union (EU). This lack of attention is surpris-
ing, as the EU has also witnessed a rise in the number of
prescriptions across these same therapeutic classes [8].
In tandem, there has also been an increase in emergency
room visits and drug treatment admissions for prescrip-
tion CNS medications in the EU [9–12]. Yet, the EU
lacks a systematic method for identifying and monitor-
ing trends in NMPDU over time, so its prevalence and
associated user characteristics are largely unknown.
The US has arguably the most sophisticated and
diverse drug abuse surveillance systems in the world,
ranging from direct estimates of self-reported drug use
to administrative data on drug arrests, seizures, and drug
treatment admissions [13–20]. In the EU, the European
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
(EMCDDA) is the agency charged with coordinating
information about specific drugs, and their health and
social consequences. The agency was established in
1993, and disseminates reports using data provided from
its member nations. Most of its data are from secondary
sources, such as arrests, seizures, and drug treatment ad-
missions [21]. While the US has numerous opportunities
for funding epidemiological studies on NMPDU, the EU
has comparatively fewer sources of funding to support
new data collection efforts. On occasion, the EMCDDA
is able to acquire primary survey data from dedicated
government funding.
Due to the lack of a comprehensive surveillance sys-
tem and funding for NMPDU studies in the EU, most of
what is known comes from studies conducted in the US.
A consistent finding in the literature from the US and
the EU is that NMPDUs often engage in polydrug use
[22, 23]. However, there is also a group of persons who
engage in NMPDU but who do not engage in poly-drug
use [24–26]. Of importance is that few studies have spe-
cifically examined these two groups, including providing
estimates of the number of users relative to the total
group of persons engaging in NMPDU, as well as their
defining characteristics.
NMPDU has received a considerable amount of atten-
tion in the US, but anecdotal evidence suggests that
other nations are experiencing dramatic increases as well
[27]. Drug abuse is becoming more global in nature.
With regard to prescription medications, global studies
are critical to pharmacovigilance, which is the process of
monitoring the individual and population-level health
effects after medications have been approved for retail
sales. This process has relevance for numerous stake-
holders, as NMPDU is a key metric that provides a
measure of a medication’s abuse liability and safety pro-
file for clinicians, payers, and policy-makers. Prescription
drug abuse is a prominent topic in many Internet
chat-rooms, including information about availability,
consumption, and side-effects. These discussions are
international
in
focus,
as
participants
come
from
many different types of nationalities. The international
borders that separate the drug trade in each country
are also eroding. For example, drug users are even
able to make anonymous purchases through online
pharmacies [28–30]. There is need to understand whether
the high levels of NMPDU observed in the United States
are similar in other EU countries. The objectives of this
study are to examine the prevalence NMPDU in the EU,
including a set of analyses to identify the subgroups at
greatest risk and the methods of acquisition.
Methods
Study population and design
The European Union Medicine Study (EU-Meds Study)
was a parallel series of national surveys conducted in
Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, and Sweden.
The target sample age range was 12 to 49 years, which is
the typical period of initiation for substance use around
the globe. The study design used a quota sampling
methodology [31]. First, targets were identified in each
country based on sex, age, and marital status. Quotas
were also set based on characteristics that were highly
associated with NMPDU, such as tobacco and marijuana
use [32]. The overall recruitment targets were set to
achieve an initial sample proportionate to size in each
country. The targets were monitored each week, and
once a quota was met, no additional persons matching
those characteristics were eligible for the study. The sec-
ond stage, described later, adjusted the sample using
weighting under the General Exponential Model (GEM)
weighting [33]. This step further calibrated the quota
sample much in the same way a post-hoc weight is ap-
plied to a probability sample. Both methods are used to
achieve the same goal: a nationally representative sam-
ple. A brief note on the measurement of race in this
study. Typically, EU countries do not measure race in
the same way, so we limited our investigation to the
measure of race based on white and non-white. We
compared our racial characteristics to available data and
it appears that the distribution of non-whites in the EU
countries we studied ranges between 87 % (Great
Britain) to Denmark (98 %).
Participants were recruited through a diverse range of
methods, first starting with advertisements in local
newspapers, then moving to street-intercept recruit-
ments in open-air drug markets, needle exchanges,
homeless shelters, and parks/libraries. Another method
of recruitment was to use market research lists to recruit
either adults or adults with children. Because of ethical
requirements in the protection of minors in the EU, the
study sample and recruitment/data collection proce-
dures were divided into two age groups: one for youth
(ages 12 to 17) and another for adults (ages 18 to 49).

 The youth sample was required to complete the survey
of one of the onsite research sites. The facilities were
located in geographically centralized areas to ensure a
diverse range of participants across the rural/suburban/
urban environments. Once recruited, the youths were
asked to arrive on-site with their legal guardian. Adults
were provided with a unique web link to take the survey
on their own. Identity was verified using a unique pass-
code for each respondent. Individuals were paid approxi-
mately €50 Euros. A total of 22,075 individuals completed
the survey, but 5 respondents were eliminated due to sig-
nificant missing data (>0 %) on the survey items. The final
sample was 22,070, which included 2,032 youths and
20,038 adults. The consent rate for the overall study was
78 % based on the number of individuals who screened
eligible and those who consented to be part of the study.
Questionnaire and measures
The participants were able to take the survey in English
and also in each country’s native language (i.e. Danish,
German, Swedish, and Spanish). The measures were all
based on self-report, including demographics such as
age, sex, and race. The surveys were initially developed
using the World Health Organization’s Composite Diag-
nostic Interview Schedule (CIDI) [34]. CIDI has been
adapted for self-administration as part of a diagnostic
calibration [35]. The primary outcome measures were
based on the NMPDU for three of the most commonly
abused therapeutic classes: stimulants, opioids, and seda-
tives (e.g., tranquilizers, benzodiazepines). A respondent
was first provided with a written introduction that de-
fined nonmedical use as either (a) self-treatment using a
prescription that was not their own or (b) misuse of the
product for euphoria. For instance, the questions starts
outs with an explanation that…”we are not interested in
your use of over-the-counter medications that you
cannot obtain without a doctor’s or pharmacist’s permis-
sion.” Next, the question asks the respondent whether
they have ever used medication “for euphoria, to obtain
a high” and or “to self-treat a medical problem using
mediation that was not specifically prescribed for you.”
The primary independent variables were ascertained
by self-report measures based on whether the respond-
ent had endorsed that they were prescribed stimulants,
opioids, or sedatives for any reason by a licensed pre-
scriber. A single question asked if the respondent was
diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (with or with-
out Hyperactivity) and another question ascertained a
diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. An additional question asked if
the respondent was ever arrested for any legal reason,
regardless of whether they were incarcerated as a result
of the arrest. Finally, serious psychological distress was
measured by the Kessler Six Item (K6) measure, which
included items on depressive mood, self-derogation,
anxiety, and role impairment. The K6 has been validated
as a screening measure for mood and anxiety disorders.
Analysis
A
goal
of
the
sampling
design
was
to
produce
population-based estimates within each country. The
pool of respondents was selected from a quota sample
methodology; within this design, the selection probabil-
ities are unknowable because the sample is based on
multiple recruitment channels rather than a single sam-
pling frame. After the data collection was completed in
each country, the study statistician reviewed the bias in
the final sample and the targets. The first step in the
analysis plan was to create weights for respondents in
each country, generalizable to the larger population aged
12 to 49. This step is similar to post-hoc weight adjust-
ments that are typically used in probability-based sam-
ples. The method of calibration weighting was applied to
the raw survey data to make the inferences generalizable
to the larger population of non-institutionalized resi-
dents in each country. In order to calculate the post-
stratification weights, the sample was first divided into
two separate population groups: youth (ages 12 to 17)
and adults (ages 18 to 49). The available data varied by
country, but the main variables for which distributions
were available included age, sex, marital status, employ-
ment status, education, and nativity. Two additional sub-
stance
use
variables
were
included:
alcohol
and
cigarettes were also included. The final weighted data
closely approximated the final demographic distributions
in each country as well as substance use characteristics
associated with the primary outcomes of interest. Add-
itional sensitivity analyses (not shown) compared the
final weighted results to published data. Once the sam-
ple weights were finalized, the analyses were conducted
on the weighted data. Cross tabulations and multivari-
able logistic regression methods were used via SUDAAN
(release 11.1, RTI International). For the logistic regres-
sion models, separate analyses were estimated for each
therapeutic class. Because it is possible that NMPDUs
may engage in use for therapeutic reasons as well as eu-
phoria, we examined the association comparing those
who just engaged in NMPDU relative to those engaging
in NMPDU and illicit drug use. Put differently, it is pos-
sible that initial NMPDU may serve as a gateway to
other substances by exposing users to the physiological
and socio-cultural aspects of substance use. There is also
a possibility of a selection effect, whereby persons using
illicit drugs are at higher risk for NMPDU. With cross-
sectional data, we are unable to resolve this question;
yet, data from this study provide an examination of the
preliminary associations that can be investigated in
future studies that contain developmentally sensitive
measures collected on the same set of individuals over

 time. Such information will help identify the factors
that differentiate NMPDU from non-users, and then
between NMPDUs and poly-drug use involving illicit
drug use. This outcome was coded as a binary vari-
able (0 = no NMDPU and 1 = any NMPDU) for the first
analysis, and then as a binary variable (0 = NMDPDU only
and 1 = NMPDU and ILLICIT DRUGS), except that the
analyses are subset to those with any NMPDU.
Results
Prevalence of nonmedical prescription drug use
The demographics are provided in Table 1 but they are
representative to the demographics in each of the 5 EU
countries, including race, gender, and age. The overall
lifetime and past-year prevalence estimates of NMPDU
in the combined sample (Table 1) indicated that opioids
were the most commonly endorsed medication for the
overall lifetime use (13.5 %) whereas sedatives were the
most commonly endorsed medication for the overall
past-year use (5.8 %). Stimulants were the least com-
monly endorsed medication for both lifetime (7 %) and
past-year (2.8 %) use. Illicit drug use was 38.1 % for life-
time use and 11.7 % for use in the past-year. Marijuana
was the most frequently used illicit drug in both the life-
time and past-year estimates.
Characteristics of nonmedical prescription drug users
The prevalence of NMPDU varied across numerous sub-
groups, as shown in Table 2. Great Britain had by far the
highest nonmedical use of prescription stimulants for
both past-year (3.9 %) and lifetime (9.1 %) estimates.
The remaining four countries were closely aligned in
past-year stimulant use, ranging from 2.2 % (Germany)
to 2.6 % (Sweden). This grouping was similar for lifetime
estimates, with the prevalence estimates ranging from
5.8 % (Germany) to 6.8 % (Spain). Nonmedical stimulant
use was the least common in Germany for both past-
year (2.2 %) and lifetime (5.8 %) estimates.
The highest prevalences of nonmedical opioid use
were in Spain (6.8 % past-year, 18.3 % lifetime) and
Great Britain (6.2 % past-year, 14.6 % lifetime). Germany
had the lowest estimates for opioid nonmedical use.
Spain and Sweden had the most prevalent use of seda-
tives, followed by Great Britain and Denmark. Germany
had the lowest percentage of users in the population for
past-year (2.8 % for stimulants) and lifetime (5.5 % for
sedatives) NMPDU.
The lifetime and past-year prevalence estimates of the
three therapeutic classes of prescription CNS medica-
tions indicated that usage was more common among
males relative to females, non-whites relative to whites,
and those who were unemployed compared with other
levels of employment. Those aged 12 to 17 years were
also at lower risk of NMPDU compared with those aged
18 years or older at the time of survey administration.
In addition to the bivariable comparisons, we also ex-
amined the association between NMPDU and selected
health characteristics and past-year NMPDU. As shown

 in Table 3, having received a prescription for the particu-
lar outcome drug was associated with an elevated risk of
nonmedical use. For example, having a prescription for a
pain reliever was associated with nearly an eight times
higher risk of nonmedical use of prescription pain re-
lievers. The risk was ten times higher for sedatives and
seven times higher for stimulants. Other mental health-
related conditions were also powerful correlates of
NMPDU, including non-specific psychological distress
and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD).
Early childhood risks in terms of being arrested prior to
age 15, and current sexually transmitted disease (STD)
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status were
also associated with higher odds of past-year use of all
three types of prescription medications.
Polydrug use involving nonmedical prescription drug use
and illicit drug use
As illicit drug use is a well-documented risk factor for
NMPDU and may also be a consequence of initiation,
the next set of analyses (Table 4) sought to examine dif-
ferences between two subgroups of users: those who use

There
were
country-wide differences only for opioids and sedatives,
with Great Britain being the country with the highest
rate of poly-drug use. Among past-year nonmedical
sedative users, 48 % of past-year users in Great Britain
also used illicit drugs, compared to 26 % in Germany,
22 % in Denmark and Sweden, and 20 % in Spain.
Among past-year nonmedical prescription opioid users,
43 % of past-year users in Great Britain also used illicit
drugs, compared to 41 % in Sweden, 30 % in Germany,
24 % in Denmark, and 21 % in Spain.

 Females were about half as likely to engage in con-
comitant illicit drug use as males. Interestingly, there
were no age-related differences across any of the
three drug-classes investigated. Conversely, those with
serious psychological distress were almost twice as
likely to engage in illicit drug use with NMPDU.
ADHD and HIV did not confer additional risk, yet
those with an STD were more likely to have reported
poly-drug use than those without STDs. Similarly,
those with childhood arrests were more likely to en-
gage in illicit drug use with NMPDU.
Sources of access
Those who engaged in theft, forgery, or doctor shopping
were about 2 to 2.5 times more likely to have also used
illicit drugs. For example, past-year users of stimulants
were about 90 % (odds ratio [O.R.] = 1.9, 95 % confi-
dence interval [C.I.] = 1.2–2.9) more likely to also use
illicit drugs if they reported non-social sources of access.
Those using for euphoria or other non-treatment reasons
were far more likely to have also consumed illicit drugs in
the past year, with the risk being higher for opioids
(O.R. = 4.8, 95 % C.I. = 3.1–7.4), sedatives (O.R. = 3.5,
95 % C.I. = 2.0–6.1), and stimulants (O.R. = 1.9, 95 %
C.I. = 1.2–3.1).
Figure 1 presents the prevalence estimates for dif-
ferent types of sources. Among the past-year users of
stimulants, 71 % reported one source for obtaining
the medication for nonmedical use, 16 % reported
two
sources,
and
13
%
reported
three
or
more
sources. This distribution was similar for opioids (one
source = 73 %, two sources = 18 %, three or more
sources = 9 %) and sedatives (one source = 80 %, two
sources = 12 %, three or more sources = 8 %). Across
all three classes of mediations, a friend or family
member was the most common method of acquisition
for stimulants (46.6 %), opioids (44 %), and sedatives
(61.4 %). The next most common method of acquisi-
tion was those who reported taking them from another
person without their knowledge. Of note, Internet pur-
chases were the least common methods for stimulants
(8 %), opioids (4 %), and sedatives (3 %).
Discussion
This study documented the cross-national prevalence
of NMPDU and associated characteristics of users in
five EU countries. The results reported here provide
important comparative estimates for cross-national inves-
tigations. For instance, data from the 2013 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which is
among the leading epidemiological sources of drug
abuse in the United States, revealed that 20 % of
those aged 12 years or older reported any lifetime use
of a prescription psychotherapeutic [36]. The lifetime
estimates for the EU-Meds Study ranged between 7
and 13 %. Despite methodological differences across
studies, the findings suggest that the prevalence esti-
mates in the EU are likely to be lower than the
prevalence of nonmedical prescription drug use in the
US. There were no data available on the health con-
sequences of NMPD in this study, such as motor
vehicle
accidents
or
emergency
department
visits.
Therefore, it is possible that the EU and the US may
share similarities in the level of use, but the individ-
ual and societal consequences associated with use
may differ. Compared to the EU, the US has a higher
rate of motor
vehicle accidents and unintentional
overdoses that can be attributable to prescription

 medicines [2, 37–39]. The limited data from the EU
suggest that much of the burden is attributable to
illicit drugs rather than prescription-type medications
[40]. Although Europeans may be using these medica-
tions on their own or without their physician’s know-
ledge, the public health consequences may not have
reached levels similar to those in the US.
This epidemiological study also examined different
patterns of exposure to prescription medications. One of
the pathways to NMPDU is commonly referred to as
“iatrogenic addiction” [24]. This pathway leads to non-
medical use after receiving treatment for a legitimate
medical condition. Therefore, persons initiated into
NMPDU through this pathway are less likely to have a
history of poly-drug use. These data show that persons
receiving a prescription had a higher likelihood of en-
gaging in NMPDU than persons without a prescription.
However, poly-drug users were not at differential risk
than persons engaging only in NMPDU. A note of cau-
tion is that this study is population-based, and did not
link exposure from a specific prescription to long-term
outcomes. Instead, the survey asked about the receipt of
medications used to treat common conditions, and the
subsequent use of prescription medications nonmedi-
cally. Given the limitations of observational data, this
finding should not be construed as a recommendation
against prescribing medications to treat legitimate condi-
tions. Any such recommendation should be based on
methodologies that allow for a greater ability to address
confounding than an observational design. Future stud-
ies are needed to more thoroughly investigate the role of
patient access and the likelihood of NMPDU. In the EU,
some prescription medications are available directly
from a pharmacist. For example, codeine is available
from a pharmacist in several EU countries. Additional
studies are needed to examine how differences in pre-
scribing are related to the onset and course of NMPDU.
This study also found that social sources (e.g. a family
member or friend) were the most prevalent methods of
acquisition, which is similar to findings in the US and
other international studies [13, 41, 42]. However, the
patterns we observe in the self-reported methods of ac-
quisition regarding medications for NMPDU suggest
that the Internet is becoming less common for accessing
prescription medications for NMPDU in the US [43].
Inciardi and colleagues conducted an analysis of 2006
NSDUH data, showing that among those using the
Internet to acquire medications, stimulants were the
most common prescription drug purchased on the Inter-
net (4 %), followed by sedatives (1 %), and opioids
(0.5 %) [30]. According to a 2009 study conducted by
the Pew Research Center, approximately 74 % of adults
aged 18 years or older in the US use the Internet [44].
Compared with the US, preliminary evidence indicates
that a larger proportion of citizens in the EU use the
Internet, and also use it more frequently [45]. The US
has been aggressive in regulating Internet pharmacies
over the past several years, so it is unclear whether dif-
ferences in the number of Internet users or aggressive
policies may explain any between-country differences
between the EU and other countries [46, 47].
Like any community based epidemiologic investiga-
tion, there are numerous limitations inherent in the
study design. Perhaps the most lingering question about
this study is whether the quota sampling methodology
may have also increased the between-country differences
due to its reliance on proactive recruitment instead of
using a preexisting sampling frame. Nonprobability sam-
ples have been shown to yield prevalence estimates for
illicit drug use that are higher than probability surveys
[48]. Therefore, this design used a diverse range of re-
cruitment methodologies (e.g. street intercept, recruit-
ment flyers, print advertisements), including proactive
recruitment across diverse ranges of population strata.
This design yields less bias in terms of coverage, nonre-
sponse, and measurement than an internet panel study,
but in theory introduces more bias than a probability
sample. However, probability studies also face challenges
because cellular telephones, privacy concerns, and iden-
tity threats significantly hamper their ability to recruit
subjects [49]. This study conducted numerous validation
checks by comparing our results with other known
population-based studies of drug abuse in selected EU
countries. The data were comparable, increasing confi-
dence in study findings. For example, we subset our data
to prevalence data obtained from reports sourced by the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addic-
tion (EMCDDA). The data were sourced for persons of a
similar age range in the same countries [50]. For canna-
bis, the EU estimate was 43.6 and the EU-Meds survey
was 44.5 %, a difference of −0.9 percentage points. We
also compared data from individual countries. To illus-
trate, the differences in amphetamine use, which in-
cludes prescription and illicit (e.g., methamphetamine)
ranged from −2.8 percentage points to 2.2 percentage
points. To illustrate, the estimate for Denmark, ages
15–34 in the 2014 EU Meds study was 7.5 %, but
was 10.3 % for a study conducted in Denmark in 2011, re-
ported by the EMCDDA. The survey methods were kept
as comparable as possible across the countries, although it
is possible that even subtle differences in the survey pro-
cedures (e.g. instrument translation, recruitment methods)
may have increased the observed differences in the
between-country estimates.
Conclusions
With these limitations in mind, projects such as the
current study can provide important comparative data
Novak et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:274 
Page 10 of 12
 for countries across the EU, the US, and beyond. The
US is fortunate in that it has numerous systems and
funding for drug abuse research that can be used to
study substance use across geographic space and time.
The EU drug abuse surveillance systems tend to focus
less on human population-based studies, thereby making
a direct comparison between the population rates in the
US and the EU quite challenging. This study used the
same base interview schedule that is also used by NSDUH,
but modifications were made to accommodate cultural
differences in terminology and self-administration. Thus,
there are important methodological differences between
the two studies that preclude direct comparisons. How-
ever, identification of the initial scope and prevalence of
NMPDU in the EU is an important first step in building a
worldwide system that can be used to monitor trends in
substance use, track prominent risk and protective factors,
and trace the transmission of information and products
across national borders.
