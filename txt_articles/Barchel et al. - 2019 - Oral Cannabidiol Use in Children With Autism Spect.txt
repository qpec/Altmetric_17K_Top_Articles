Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly exhibit comorbid
symptoms such as aggression, hyperactivity and anxiety. Several studies are being
conducted worldwide on cannabidiol use in ASD; however, these studies are still
ongoing, and data on the effects of its use is very limited. In this study we aimed to
report the experience of parents who administer, under supervision, oral cannabinoids
to their children with ASD.
Methods: After obtaining a license from the Israeli Ministry of Health, parents of
children with ASD were instructed by a nurse practitioner how to administer oral drops
of cannabidiol oil. Information on comorbid symptoms and safety was prospectively
recorded biweekly during follow-up interviews. An independent group of specialists
analyzed these data for changes in ASD symptoms and drug safety.
Results: 53 children at a median age of 11 (4–22) year received cannabidiol for a median
duration of 66 days (30–588). Self-injury and rage attacks (n = 34) improved in 67.6%
and worsened in 8.8%. Hyperactivity symptoms (n = 38) improved in 68.4%, did not
change in 28.9% and worsened in 2.6%. Sleep problems (n = 21) improved in 71.4%
and worsened in 4.7%. Anxiety (n = 17) improved in 47.1% and worsened in 23.5%.
Adverse effects, mostly somnolence and change in appetite were mild.
Conclusion: Parents’ reports suggest that cannabidiol may improve ASD comorbidity
symptoms; however, the long-term effects should be evaluated in large scale studies.

INTRODUCTION
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly exhibit co-morbid symptoms of
hyperactivity, self-injury, aggressiveness, restlessness, anxiety and sleep disorders (Mannion and
Leader, 2013; South et al., 2017). Conventional medical treatment includes various psychotropic
medications such as atypical anti psychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’
s),

stimulants and anxiolytics (Canitano and Scandurra, 2008;
Stachnik and Gabay, 2010; Wink et al., 2010; Hurwitz et al., 2012).
Several studies are being conducted worldwide on the
use of cannabidiol in children with ASD to treat comorbid
symptoms. However, there is limited published data on the
use of cannabinoids in this population (Kurz and Blaas,
2010; Kuester et al., 2017). A recent review has suggested
cannabidiol as a candidate for treatment of ASD (Poleg
et al., 2019). Cannabis contains numerous chemically active
compounds, including �9-tetrahydrocannabinol (�9-THC),
cannabidiol (CBD) and terpenoids (Russo, 2011). �9-THC
activates the endocannabinoid system in the central nervous
system, affecting appetite, anxiety, cognitive function and
memory (Palmieri et al., 2017). In contrast, CBD is anxiolytic,
anti-inflammatory, antiemetic and antipsychotic (Detyniecki
and Hirsch, 2015). Studies in mice models of ASD have
demonstrated the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in
the pathogenesis of ASD symptoms (Foldy et al., 2013; Wei et al.,
2015).
In this study we aimed to record the experience of parents who
administered under supervision cannabidiol to their children
with ASD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Included were children from all over Israel diagnosed with ASD
based on DSM IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
or DSM V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria,
between three and 25 years of age, who were followed up for
at least 30 days after commencement of cannabidiol treatment.
An independent group of specialists including a pediatric
neurologist specialized in ASD, clinical pharmacologists and
pharmacists objectively analyzed the data recorded during the
follow up to assess symptom response and adverse effects. Four
ASD comorbidity symptoms were evaluated: (a) hyperactivity
symptoms (b) sleep problems, (c) self-injury and (d) anxiety.
For each comorbid symptom, the evaluations marked
improvement, no change, or worsening of symptoms, as
compared to the baseline, according to the parent’
s reports. An
overall change was defined based on the summation of all parent’
s
reports.
Children were recruited from a registry of patients with
authorization to obtain cannabidiol (Tikun Olam Inc., Israel).
Parents received a license for pediatric use of CBD from the Israeli
Ministry of Health. The cannabinoid oil solution was prepared
by “
Tikun Olam”company, which is an approved supplier, at
a concentration of 30% and 1:20 ratio of cannabidiol (CBD)
and �9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Quality assurance of the
cannabidiol concentrations are routinely performed by HPLC on
an Ultima 3000 Thermo Dionex instrument. Recommended daily
dose of CBD was 16 mg/kg (maximal daily dose 600 mg), and for
THC- daily dose of 0.8 mg/kg (maximal daily dose of 40 mg).
For all participating children this was their first experience
with cannabidiol and no other cannabinoids were used before
this study. During the first meeting, parents were instructed
by an experienced nurse practitioner how to administer the
preparation. Thereafter, a biweekly follow-up telephone interview
was conducted with the parents. During the telephone interview,
parents were asked on the status of the various ASD comorbid
symptoms (graded as improvement, no change, worsening),
emerging adverse effects and medications that had been used.
Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (Food Drug Administration, 2004). The
change in each comorbid symptom in the study cohort was
compared to published data using conventional treatment.
For this purpose we used the following values: Hyperactivity
symptoms- Improvement was considered as 80% (Handen et al.,
2000), for self-injury an improvement was considered as 82%
(Richards et al., 2016), for sleep problems an improvement was
considered as 60% (Devnani and Hegde, 2015), and improvement
in anxiety symptoms was considered as 64% (Moore et al., 2004).
The Study Was Not Financially
Supported by Tikun Olam Company
The study was approved by the local research ethics committee.
The need for written parental consent for this study was waived
by the Assaf Harofeh Medical Center research ethics committee.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables such as gender, related ASD comorbid
symptoms, were described using frequency and percentage.
Continuous variables such as age and daily CBD dose were
evaluated for normal distribution using histograms and Q–
Q
plots. Normally distributed continuous variables were described
as mean and standard deviation and skewed variables were
expressed as median and interquartile range or range. Length
of follow-up was described using a reverse censoring method.
A comparison of improvement in symptoms between CBD
treatment and conventional treatment was analyzed using
binomial test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
(IBM Corp 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0,
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).
RESULTS
Fifty- three patients were included in the study, 45 males (85%)
and 8 females (15%). The median age was 11 (range: 4–
22)
years (Table 1). Median duration of follow-up was 66 (range:
30–
588) days. THC median interquartile range (IQR) daily dose
was 7 (4–
11) mg and CBD median (IQR) daily dose was 90
(45–
143) mg.
Six children were excluded because they were treated for less
than a month. None of them has discontinued treatment nor had
adverse effects. A total of 266 interviews were performed (median
5 interviews per patient).

Five families discontinued follow-up at different time points.
Two families reported ineffectiveness and chose to stop
treatment; two families decided to continue treatment with a
different medical cannabis supplier and in one family the license
expired.
DISCUSSION
In this study, based on recorded data reported by parents of
children with ASD, in all four ASD comorbidity symptoms
described, parents have reported an overall improvement.
This is one of the first publications on the use of cannabidiol to
treat comorbid symptoms of patients with ASD. There are studies
which are being conducted these days in several countries such as
the United States and Israel, to examine the efficacy and safety
of cannabidiol in this population; however, these studies are still
ongoing.
The incidence of hyperactivity symptoms in the ASD
population ranges between 41 and 78% (Sturm et al., 2004;
Murray, 2010). In our study there was an overall improvement
of 68.4% [95%CI (51.4–
82.5%)] in hyperactivity symptoms
as reported by the parents. Conventional treatments for
hyperactivity include treatment with methylphenidate. In one

study, methylphenidate improved symptoms in 80% (Handen
et al., 2000). Comparing the overall improvement in hyperactivity
symptoms in children treated with cannabidiol to that achieved
with
methylphenidate,
non-inferiority
of
cannabidiol
was
observed (p = 0.125).
Self-injurious behavior is common in ASD, with incidence
ranging between 35 and 60% (Richards et al., 2016). Our
study presented an overall improvement of 67.6% [95%CI
(49.5–
82.6%)] and worsening of 4.9% [95%CI (1.9–
23.7%)]
in these symptoms. Currently, atypical antipsychotics are
recommended for the treatment serious behavioral symptoms
and self-injury (Marcus et al., 2009). Aripiprazole improves
symptoms in 82% (any improvement) while 4% presented
worsening in symptoms (Marcus et al., 2009). Comparing the
overall improvement and worsening in self-injury symptoms in
children treated with cannabidiol in our study to that described
in the literature with aripiprazole, non-inferiority of cannabidiol
was observed (p = 0.063, p = 0.307, respectively).
Sleep problems in children and adolescents with ASD range
between 40 and 80% (Devnani and Hegde, 2015). Conventional
treatment with melatonin improved sleep problems in 60%
of the patients (Devnani and Hegde, 2015). In our present
study cannabidiol was reported to be effective in 71.4% [95%CI
(47.8–
88.7%)] of the patients in improving sleep problems.
Comparing the overall improvement in sleep problems in
children treated with cannabidiol to that reported in children
treated with melatonin, non-inferiority of cannabidiol was
observed (p = 0.40).
Anxiety symptoms in children with ASD are common
(Sukhodolsky et al., 2008) and are usually controlled with
selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI’
s) treatment in
55–
73% (Moore et al., 2004). In our study, reports on 17 patients
with these symptoms were recorded and in 47.1% [95%CI
(23.0–
72.2%)] of the children an improvement of symptoms
was reported. It has been suggested that by improving sleep
and disruptive behavior, the motivation and the ability to
communicate with the family and the caregivers is improved.
Comparing the overall improvement in anxiety symptoms in
children treated with cannabidiol to that reported in children
treated with SSRI’
s, non-inferiority of cannabidiol was observed
(p = 0.232).
�9-THC
and
CBD
are
substrates
and
inhibitors
of
cytochrome
P450
enzymatic
pathways
relevant
to
the
biotransformation
of
commonly
prescribed
psychotropic
agents (Rong et al., 2018). �9-THC is rapidly metabolized by
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes and CBD is metabolized
by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 (Stout and Cimino, 2014). Data
suggest minimal induction of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and
3A4 by �9-THC and CBD. However, drug–
drug interaction
should be considered; phenytoin plasma concentration might
be increased, even up to toxic range (Rong et al., 2018). Animal
studies have demonstrated that the exposure to �9-THC may
reverse the neurobehavioral effects of risperidone, which may
be less effective (Brzozowska et al., 2017). Other potential
drug–
drug interactions of cannabidiol include SSRI’
s, tricyclic
antidepressant and CNS depressants which may result in toxic
levels of these medications (Lindsey et al., 2012). In our study,
signs and symptoms of toxicity of these medications were not
reported.
Most frequent adverse effects, as reported by the parents,
were somnolence and change in appetite (Table 3). These
symptoms were perceived by the parents as related to the
treatment with cannabidiol. All adverse effects were reported
to be transient and resolved spontaneously. Several studies
have demonstrated that the most common adverse effects
associated with CBD use in children and adults are somnolence,
change in appetite, diarrhea, and weight changes (Devinsky
et al., 2016). Case-studies indicate that cannabinoids may
induce acute psychosis which is self-limited over time (Shah
et al., 2017); however, cannabis is not considered as the only
cause for persistent psychotic disorder. More likely it is the
interaction of several factors, such as age at onset of cannabis
use, childhood abuse, genetic vulnerability and psychiatric
comorbidities which result in psychosis (Wilkinson et al., 2014).
Patients with a history of psychotic attacks are more likely to
develop cannabis induced psychotic attacks and this should be
a contraindication for treatment with CBD (Degenhardt et al.,
2018).
Our study has several limitations. All information was based
on parents’reports, with no control group, and there was no
objective assessment tool for symptoms changes. We did not
have information on the history of ASD symptoms in each
patient.
Parents may subjectively report an improvement due to
high expectations from the treatment. However, we believe
that the main caregivers are the best source to evaluate
the child’
s status and adverse events. In this population of
children with ASD, adverse events are reported by the caregivers
rather than the medical staff. Several studies, examining the
efficacy and safety of cannabidiol in children with epilepsy,
based upon parents’report, were published in the medical
literature (Porter and Jacobson, 2013). Furthermore, our study
was conducted on a cohort of patients who were followed
up consistently, and not a case series; hence, the rates of
treatment success or failure are calculated based on a genuine
denominator.
CONCLUSION
Children with ASD commonly have comorbid symptoms such
as aggression, hyperactivity and anxiety. There is an increase in
the use of cannabidiol in children with ASD. Based on parents’
reports, our findings suggest that cannabidiol may be effective
in improving ASD comorbid symptoms; However, CBD efficacy
and safety should be further evaluated in children with ASD in
large-scale clinical trials.
