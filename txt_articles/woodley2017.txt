Background
About one-third of women have urinary incontinence and up to one-tenth have faecal incontinence after childbirth. Pelvic floor muscle
training (PFMT) is commonly recommended during pregnancy and after birth for both prevention and treatment of incontinence.
This is an update of a review previously published in 2012.
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in the prevention or treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence
in pregnant or postnatal women.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (16 February 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi-randomised trials in pregnant or postnatal women. One arm of the trial included PFMT. Another arm was no
PFMT, usual antenatal or postnatal care, another control condition, or an alternative PFMT intervention.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. We extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Populations
included: women who were continent (PFMT for prevention), women who were incontinent (PFMT for treatment) at randomisation
and a mixed population of women who were one or the other (PFMT for prevention or treatment). We assessed quality of evidence
using the GRADE approach.

Pelvic floor muscle training for prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Main results
The review included 38 trials (17 of which were new for this update) involving 9892 women from 20 countries. Overall, trials were
small to moderate sized, and the PFMT programmes and control conditions varied considerably and were often poorly described. Many
trials were at moderate to high risk of bias. Other than two reports of pelvic floor pain, trials reported no harmful effects of PFMT.
Prevention of urinary incontinence: compared with usual care, continent pregnant women performing antenatal PFMT may have had a
lower risk of reporting urinary incontinence in late pregnancy (62% less; risk ratio (RR) for incontinence 0.38, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.20 to 0.72; 6 trials, 624 women; low-quality evidence). Similarly, antenatal PFMT decreased the risk of urinary incontinence in
the mid-postnatal period (more than three to six months’ postpartum) (29% less; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; 5 trials, 673 women;
moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient information available for the late (more than six to 12 months’) postnatal period to
determine effects at this time point.
Treatment of urinary incontinence: it is uncertain whether antenatal PFMT in incontinent women decreases incontinence in late
pregnancy compared to usual care (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.13; 3 trials, 345 women; very low-quality evidence). This uncertainty
extends into the mid- (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24; 1 trial, 187 women; very low-quality evidence) and late (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13
to 1.93; 2 trials, 869 women; very low-quality evidence) postnatal periods. In postnatal women with persistent urinary incontinence,
it was unclear whether PFMT reduced urinary incontinence at more than six to 12 months’ postpartum (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to
1.07; 3 trials; 696 women; very low-quality evidence).
Mixed prevention and treatment approach to urinary incontinence: antenatal PFMT in women with or without urinary incontinence
(mixed population) may decrease urinary incontinence risk in late pregnancy (26% less; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 9 trials, 3164
women; low-quality evidence) and the mid-postnatal period (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 5 trials, 1921 women; very low-quality
evidence). It is uncertain if antenatal PFMT reduces urinary incontinence risk late postpartum (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 2 trials,
244 women; low-quality evidence). For PFMT begun after delivery, there was considerable uncertainty about the effect on urinary
incontinence risk in the late postnatal period (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 3 trials, 826 women; very low-quality evidence).
Faecal incontinence: six trials reported faecal incontinence outcomes. In postnatal women with persistent faecal incontinence, it was
uncertain whether PFMT reduced incontinence in the late postnatal period compared to usual care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94;
2 trials; 620 women; very low-quality evidence). In women with or without faecal incontinence (mixed population), antenatal PFMT
led to little or no difference in the prevalence of faecal incontinence in late pregnancy (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.25; 2 trials, 867
women; moderate-quality evidence). For postnatal PFMT in a mixed population, there was considerable uncertainty about the effect
on faecal incontinence in the late postnatal period (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.21; 1 trial, 107 women, very low-quality evidence).
There was little evidence about effects on urinary or faecal incontinence beyond 12 months’ postpartum. There were few incontinence-
specific quality of life data and little consensus on how to measure it. We found no data on health economics outcomes.
Authors’ conclusions
Targeting continent antenatal women early in pregnancy and offering a structured PFMT programme may prevent the onset of
urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and postpartum. However, the cost-effectiveness of this is unknown. Population approaches
(recruiting antenatal women regardless of continence status) may have a smaller effect on urinary incontinence, although the reasons
for this are unclear. It is uncertain whether a population-based approach for delivering postnatal PFMT is effective in reducing urinary
incontinence. Uncertainty surrounds the effects of PFMT as a treatment for urinary incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women,
which contrasts with the more established effectiveness in mid-life women.
It is possible that the effects of PFMT might be greater with targeted rather than mixed prevention and treatment approaches and in
certain groups of women. Hypothetically, for instance, women with a high body mass index are at risk factor for urinary incontinence.
Such uncertainties require further testing and data on duration of effect are also needed. The physiological and behavioural aspects
of exercise programmes must be described for both PFMT and control groups and how much PFMT women in both groups do, to
increase understanding of what works and for whom.
Few data exist on faecal incontinence or costs and it is important that both are included in any future trials. It is essential that future
trials use valid measures of incontinence-specific quality of life for both urinary and faecal incontinence.

Pelvic floor muscle training for prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women (Review)

 How effective are pelvic floor muscle exercises undertaken during pregnancy or after birth for preventing or treating inconti-
nence?
Review question
To assess whether doing pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME) during pregnancy or after birth reduces incontinence. This is an update
of a review published in 2012.
Background
More than one-third of women experience unintentional (involuntary) loss of urine (urinary incontinence) in the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy and about one-third leak urine in the first three months after giving birth. About one-quarter of women have
some involuntary loss of flatus (wind) or faeces (anal incontinence) in late pregnancy and one fifth leak flatus or faeces one year after
birth. PFME are commonly recommended by health professionals during pregnancy and after birth to prevent and treat incontinence.
The muscles are strengthened and kept strong with regular PFME. Muscles are contracted several times in a row, more than once a day,
several days a week and continued indefinitely.
How up-to-date is this review?
The evidence is current to 16 February 2017.
Study characteristics
We included 38 trials (17 new to this update) involving 9892 women from 20 countries. The studies included pregnant women or
women who had delivered their baby within the last three months. Women reported leakage of urine, faeces, both urine or faeces, or
no leakage. They were allocated randomly to receive PFME (to try and prevent incontinence or as a treatment for incontinence) or not
and the effects were compared.
Study funding sources
Nineteen studies were publicly funded. One received grants from public and private sources. Three studies received no funding and
15 did not declare funding sources.
Key results
Pregnant women without urine leakage who did PFME to prevent leakage: women may report less urine leakage in late pregnancy and
three to six months after childbirth. There was not enough information to determine whether these effects continued beyond the first
year after the baby’s birth.
Women with urine leakage, pregnant or after birth, who did PFME as a treatment: it was uncertain whether doing PFME during pregnancy
reduced leakage in late pregnancy or in the year following childbirth. It was unclear if doing PFME helped women with leakage after
giving birth.
Women with or without urine leakage (mixed group), pregnant or after birth, who did PFME to either prevent or treat leakage: women
who began exercising during pregnancy were less likely to report leakage in late pregnancy and up to six months after birth, but it was
uncertain if the effect lasted at one year following birth. For women who started PFME after delivery, the effect on leakage one year
after birth was uncertain.
Leakage of faeces: few studies (only six) had evidence about leakage of faeces. One year after delivery, it was uncertain if PFME helped
decrease leakage of faeces in women who started exercising following childbirth. It was also uncertain if women with or without leakage
of faeces (mixed group) who started PFME while pregnant were less likely to leak faeces in late pregnancy or up to one year after birth.
There was little information about how PFME may affect leakage-related quality of life. There were two reports of pelvic floor pain but
no other harmful effects of PFME were noted. It is unknown if PFMEs offer value for money because no study had a health economics
analysis. It is unknown if PFME offer value for money as no health economics data were identified.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, studies were not large and most had design problems, including limited details on how women were randomly allocated into
groups, and poor reporting of measurements. Some of the problems were expected because it was impossible to blind health professionals
or women to whether they were exercising or not. The PFME differed considerably between studies and were often poorly described.
Evidence quality was generally low to very low.

 B A C K G R O U N D
Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests that women who
have had a baby are at increased risk of developing urinary incon-
tinence. It seems that both pregnancy and delivery are risk factors
(Foldspang 1999; Milsom 2017; Rortveit 2003a; Rortveit 2003b;
Viktrup 2006). Similarly, these women seem to be at greater risk
of faecal incontinence, particularly those who have had vaginal
deliveries (Eason 2002; MacArthur 2001; Pollack 2004; Sultan
1999).
Description of the condition
Urinary incontinence
Urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine) is a common
problem amongst adults living in the community (Milsom 2017).
It is more frequent in women and pregnancy or the postnatal pe-
riodmaybe the firsttime manywomenexperience urinaryinconti-
nence. Stress urinary incontinence (involuntary urine leakage with
physical exertion) and urgency urinary incontinence (involuntary
leakage associated with, or immediately following, a sudden com-
pelling need to void) are the two most common types of urine
leakage in women. Many women have symptoms of both stress
and urgency urinary incontinence. This is called mixed urinary
incontinence. Of these types, stress urinary incontinence is most
commonly associated with pregnancy and the postnatal period,
although there is a small but significant increase in risk of urgency
urinary incontinence (Milsom 2017).
It seems that the prevalence of urinary incontinence increases dur-
ing pregnancy (particularly in the second trimester) and then grad-
ually decreases during the first postpartum year (Milsom 2017).
Variation is evident in prevalence estimates of all types of uri-
nary incontinence during pregnancy but this may be as high as
58%, with stress urinary incontinence affecting about 31% of
nulliparous women and 42% of parous women (Wesnes 2007).
The prevalence of persistent urinary incontinence in the first three
months following delivery is approximately 30% (Thom 2010).
Findings from moderate- to large-sized cohorts of women suggest
that factors associated with a greater risk of postpartum urinary
incontinence are:
• parity (Milsom 2017);
• higher maternal body mass index (BMI) (Durnea 2017;
Gyhagen 2013; Pizzoferrato 2014; Quiboeuf 2016; Svare 2014);
• age (Quiboeuf 2016);
• urinary incontinence before or during pregnancy (Durnea
2017; Gartland 2016; Pizzoferrato 2014; Svare 2014);
• vaginal delivery (Gartland 2016; Gyhagen 2013);
• operative vaginal deliveries or perineal or anal sphincter
trauma (Durnea 2017; Gartland 2012; Svare 2014);
• high birthweight of the baby (Gyhagen 2013; Pizzoferrato
2014; Wesnes 2017).
These associations have been observed anywhere between four
to six months’ postpartum through to 12 to 20 years following
first delivery (Gartland 2012; Gyhagen 2013; Pizzoferrato 2014;
Wesnes 2017).
Faecal incontinence
Faecal incontinence (involuntary loss of solid or liquid stool) is
less common than urinary incontinence but is particularly distress-
ing both psychologically and physically (Johanson 1996). Women
may also experience involuntary loss of flatus (wind). The term
anal incontinence is used to encompass involuntary loss of faeces
or flatus.
The prevalence of faecal incontinence is difficult to estimate as
the definition of this condition varies between studies, different
assessment tools are used and because women may be reluctant
to admit to faecal incontinence (MacArthur 2013). In addition,
variation is also apparent in the time points at which faecal incon-
tinence is measured during pregnancy and following delivery and
in which groups of women (e.g. primiparous versus multiparous).
For the purpose of this review, faecal incontinence was considered
a generic term that encompassed involuntary loss of solid stool,
liquid stool, flatus, or a combination of these.
Some form of faecal incontinence may be present during preg-
nancy in first-time mothers, with a prevalence anywhere up to
12% to 35% for flatal incontinence and 2.0% to 9.5% for loss
of formed stool (Johannessen 2016; Svare 2016). Persistent symp-
toms at three months’ postpartum may be 19% to 46% for flatus
and 2.4% to 8.0% for the involuntary loss of formed stool (Brown
2012; Signorello 2000). In the longer term, these rates seem to
persist, with about 31% of primiparous women reporting invol-
untary loss of flatus at six and 12 years after delivery and 9% to
12% reporting loss of formed stool (MacArthur 2013). One sys-
tematic review by Bols 2010 suggested that the aetiological factor
most strongly associated with postpartum faecal incontinence is a
third- or fourth-degree rupture of the external anal sphincter.
Description of the intervention
Pelvic floor muscle training
Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) refers to the performance of
repeated voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM),
according to a protocol that outlines the frequency, intensity and
progression of exercises, as well as the duration of the training
period. A PFMT programme typically includes one or more sets
of exercises per day, performed on at least several days of the week,
for at least eight weeks. It is recommended that initial training
be followed by maintenance PFM exercises to ensure duration of
effect in the longer term (Bø 2004; Mørkved 2014).
In many countries, it is common for women to receive informa-
tion about, and encouragement to perform, some PFM exercises
6

 during pregnancy and after delivery. During pregnancy, informa-
tion on PFMT may be received from a health professional or ob-
tained from other sources (e.g. leaflets and websites) but this ad-
vice may not lead to effective training if the exercise parameters
and behaviour are insufficient. Nevertheless, we continued to use
the term PFMT to make the review easier to read.
For women who are continent during pregnancy, PFMT is un-
dertaken to prevent leakage. Women who develop symptoms of
incontinence during pregnancy or postpartum may be referred to
a health professional specifically for treatment and supervision of
exercise.
Prevention of urinary and faecal incontinence with
PFMT
Prevention is primary, secondary or tertiary prevention (Hensrud
2000). Primary prevention aims to remove the causes of a dis-
ease. As an example, a trial that compares two obstetric practices
(e.g. liberal versus restrictive episiotomy policies) and the effect
on the prevalence of postnatal incontinence amongst previously
continent women is a primary prevention trial. Secondary preven-
tion aims to detect asymptomatic dysfunction and treat it early to
stop progression. A trial that compares a treatment to improve the
muscular supports of the bladder with no treatment in postnatal
women who had weak PFM but no urinary incontinence symp-
toms is classified as a secondary prevention trial. Tertiary preven-
tion is the treatment of existing symptoms to prevent progression
of disease.
Clinically, it may be difficult to screen all potential trial partici-
pants to see if a disease process is either absent altogether or present
but asymptomatic. In addition, with a condition such as inconti-
nence there might be more than one factor that could contribute
to development of the problem, for example denervation, fascial
deficits and poor muscle function. It is impractical to screen for all
possible factors and, in many cases, there are no reliable or valid
clinical tests available. Consequently, prevention trials may enrol
people purely on the basis of the absence of symptoms. This is
commonly the case in incontinence studies and the findings of
these studies are probably a combination of primary and secondary
prevention effects. This review makes no attempt to distinguish
between primary and secondary effects and considers them to-
gether.
Treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence with
PFMT
PFMT for the treatment of urinary incontinence was popularised
by Arnold Kegel (Kegel 1948). However, in one review of the lit-
erature prior to 1949, Bø 2004 identified several records of the
use of PFM exercise. PFMT was principally recommended in the
treatment of stress and mixed urinary incontinence but was in-
creasingly part of treatment offered to women with urgency uri-
nary incontinence. The use of PFMT in the treatment of urinary
incontinence is based on two functions of the PFM: support of the
pelvic organs and a contribution to the sphincteric closure mech-
anism of the urethra. More detail about how PFMT might work
to treat urinary incontinence can be found in the background to
a previous Cochrane review of PFMT (Dumoulin 2014).
PFMT is used in the treatment of faecal incontinence, although
there are fewer studies of its effectiveness than for urinary inconti-
nence. Theoretically, the external anal sphincter muscle (which is
continuous with the puborectalis muscle component of the PFM)
could be trained in a similar way and it is unclear whether it is
possible for people to know the difference between a voluntary
external anal sphincter contraction and a voluntary PFM contrac-
tion (Norton 2012).
PFMT is recommended as a first-line therapy for urinary incon-
tinence (Abrams 2017; Dumoulin 2014). However, a wide range
of options is available to treat urinary and faecal incontinence, in-
cluding conservative interventions (PFM rehabilitation including
use of electrical stimulation and biofeedback), lifestyle interven-
tions, bladder training, anti-incontinence devices, pharmaceutical
interventions and surgery.
How the intervention might work
There are a variety of plausible reasons why PFMT might help
prevent urinary incontinence. For example, trained muscle might
be less prone to injury and previously trained muscle might be
easier to retrain after damage as the appropriate motor patterns
are already learned. It may be that previously trained muscle has
a greater reserve of strength so that injury to the muscle itself, or
its nerve supply, does not cause sufficient loss of muscle function
to reach the threshold where reduced urethral closure pressure
results in leakage. During pregnancy, training the PFM might help
to counteract the increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by
the growing fetus, the hormonally mediated reduction in urethral
closure pressure, and the increased laxity of fascia and ligaments
in the pelvic area. A similar rationale might be used to support
the use of PFMT to improve the function of the external anal
sphincter and thus prevent faecal incontinence.
Essentially, a PFMT programme may be prescribed for women to:
• increase strength (the maximum force generated by a
muscle in a single contraction);
• increase endurance (ability to contract repetitively, or to
sustain a single contraction over time);
• co-ordinate muscle activity (such as the precontraction of
PFM prior to a rise in intra-abdominal pressure, or to suppress
urgency);
• address a combination of these (Bø 2014).
However, based on the plausible reasons above, strength training
tends to be emphasised for pregnant and postnatal women. Char-
acteristic features of strength training include low numbers of rep-
etitions with high loads and one way to increase load is to increase
7

Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 the amount of voluntary effort with each near maximal voluntary
contraction (Bø 2014).
There is a subgroup of women where there are particular uncer-
tainties about whether the intervention might work and how it
might work (Hilde 2013). These are women with avulsion (separa-
tion) of the PFM from the pelvic wall or other major defects in the
PFM that are palpated or seen on imaging (e.g. ultrasound, mag-
netic resonance imaging). It is possible that these women might
benefit from PFMT after the birth, helping the injury ’heal’ (Hilde
2013). However, it is also possible that PFMT does not assist the
return of function if the muscle no longer has the attachments
that anatomically enable it to compress and lift the urethra with a
muscle contraction.
Why it is important to do this review
Urinary and faecal incontinence are experienced by many women
during pregnancy and following childbirth and can have a signif-
icant impact on quality of life (Handa 2007; Rogers 2017). With
the high prevalence of incontinence in pregnant and postnatal
women, this is potentially a ’costly’ condition. There are direct
costs borne by women, such as buying continence products, laun-
dry costs and visits to a general practitioner or continence service.
Less direct but no less important costs for women may include
the social or physical activity limits they adopt to prevent embar-
rassment of leakage in public. Preventing or treating the condition
with PFMT is likely to incur considerable cost to health services
because supervised (e.g. several one-to-one contacts with a health
professional) conservative therapies such as PFMT are more ex-
pensive than usual care (Wagner 2017). However, cost-effective-
ness modelling of non-surgical treatments for stress urinary in-
continence in women found more intensive forms of PFMT were
likely to be worthwhile (Imamura 2010). It is unclear if it would
offer greater value for money to prevent the condition than treat
it.
Although PFMT is recommended as the first choice of conser-
vative management for incontinence, uncertainties about its ef-
fectiveness in antenatal and postnatal women remain (Dumoulin
2017), such as whether PFMT might be more effective if targeted
to specific groups, or more effective as a prevention or treatment
intervention. Also, with increasing pressure on constrained health-
care budgets worldwide, it is important to clarify whether the in-
tervention offers value for money to ensure efficient allocation of
resources.
This review is a major update of Boyle 2012, which examined
the effectiveness of PFMT for the prevention, treatment or mixed
prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in
antenatal and postnatal women. Uncertainties identified in previ-
ous iterations of the review appear to have contributed to comple-
tion of some moderate- to large-sized randomised controlled trials
in this population (e.g. Fritel 2015). As several new trials have
now been published with findings that could change the review
outcomes, an update that was rigorous in terms of methods and
analyses was required.
Since the last update of this review in 2012, other authors have
published systematic reviews that address the effects of PFMT
during pregnancy and after delivery for the prevention and treat-
ment of urinary incontinence and the effects of antenatal PFMT
on labour and delivery outcomes (Du 2015; Mørkved 2014).
O B J E C T I V E S
To determine the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training

control condition for the:
◦ primary or secondary prevention of incontinence;
◦ treatment of incontinence;
◦ mixed prevention or treatment of incontinence (i.e.
treating a mixed population with PFMT).
• Postnatal PFMT versus no PFMT, usual care, or other
control condition for the:

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised (including cluster and cross-over) controlled trials
and quasi-randomised studies (e.g. allocation by alternation) were
eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of controlled clin-
ical trials.
Types of participants
Trials that recruited antenatal (i.e. pregnant) or postnatal women
(i.e. women immediately following delivery or women with persis-
tent urinary or faecal incontinence symptoms up to three months
after their most recent delivery). Women could be with or without
8

 urinary, faecal, or both urinary and faecal incontinence symptoms
at recruitment.
We compared three populations of women.
• Prevention trials in antenatal women who were continent
when randomised.
• Treatment trials in antenatal or postnatal women who were
incontinent when randomised.
• Mixed prevention and treatment trials in antenatal or
postnatal women where some women had incontinence
symptoms and some did not when randomised.
Close attention was given to the distinction between treatment
and prevention trials because the effect of PFMT might differ
for these two purposes. For the trials that recruited antenatal or
postnatal women, whether they had symptoms of incontinence or
not, the PFMT intervention was a prevention strategy for the non-
symptomatic women and treatment for symptomatic women. The
two effects could not be distinguished in these trials.
Types of interventions
One arm of all eligible trials included a PFMT programme to
improve the function of the PFM, the external anal sphincter or
both. PFMT was a programme of repeated voluntary PFM con-
tractions, although this was a limited definition compared with
the fuller ideal (Dumoulin 2014). All types of PFMT were con-
sidered, including variations in the purpose and timing of PFMT
(e.g. PFMT for strengthening, PFMT for urgency suppression),
ways of teaching PFMT, types of contractions (fast or sustained)
and number of contractions.
Acceptable control interventions were usual antenatal and post-
natal care, placebo treatment or no treatment. Usual antenatal or
postnatal care in many countries included advice about PFMT.
We included studies in which the control group had, or might
have, received PFMT advice providing the PFMT arm was more
intensive in some way than the control arm. For example, in the
PFMT arm, women were taught the exercises by a health profes-
sional, whereas usual care involved distribution of a leaflet about
PFMT on the postnatal wards.
Trials in which PFMT was combined with other physical therapy
modalities such as biofeedback, electrical stimulation or multi-
modal exercise programmes were included. Studies where advice
on strategies for symptoms of urgency and frequency (but with-
out a scheduled voiding regimen characteristic of bladder training)
were also eligible for inclusion. Trials in which PFMT was com-
bined with another stand-alone therapy such as bladder training
or drug therapy (e.g. anticholinergic drug) were excluded. Trials
of electrical stimulation (without PFMT) were excluded.
Types of outcome measures
With regards to prevention, it seemed that the most appropriate
measure of outcome was the self-reported absence of urinary or
faecal incontinence symptoms. For treatment, a wider range of
outcomes was considered important, although the self-reporting
of cure or improvement in urinary or faecal incontinence symp-
toms was thought to be most important. These outcomes are the
opposite of each other, being either the presence or absence of in-
continence symptoms. For consistency throughout the review, we
chose to report presence of incontinence symptoms rather than
absence. For the comparisons that addressed the effect of PFMT
for treatment of existing continence symptoms, readers should be
aware that the data were ’negative,’ that is continuing incontinence
rather than cure.
Primary outcomes
• Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence.
• Incontinence-specific quality of life (e.g. International
Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ; 4 items,
higher score worse), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ;
30 items, higher score worse), Urogenital Distress Inventory
(UDI; 19 items, higher score worse ) (Avery 2004; Avery 2007;
Shumaker 1994).
Secondary outcomes
• Women’s observations:
◦ severity of incontinence (e.g. Incontinence Index
score, slight, moderate or severe (Sandvik 1993)).
• Quantification of symptoms:
◦ number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes.
• Clinician’s measures:
◦ loss of urine under stress test (e.g. cough or pad test).
• Other quality of life and health status measures:
◦ psychological measures (e.g. Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Score (Zigmond 1983));
◦ general health status (e.g. 36-item Short Form (SF-36)
(Ware 1993)).
• Health economics:
◦ costs of intervention(s);
◦ resource implications of differences in outcomes (e.g.
differences in number of doctor visits, or referrals);
◦ formal economic analysis (cost effectiveness, cost
utility).
• Adverse effects:
◦ discomfort or pain associated with PFMT.
• Other outcomes:
◦ labour and delivery outcome (e.g. type of delivery,
perineal trauma, episiotomy, length of second stage) for women
who did antenatal PFMT;
◦ sexual function;
◦ pelvic organ prolapse;
◦ non-prespecified outcomes that were judged
important when performing the review.

 While notoutcomesperse, we alsoextracteddataontwoparticular
variables that might help explain variations in PFMT effect:
• PFM function (e.g. electromyography, vaginal or anal
squeeze pressures);
• Treatment adherence (e.g. surrogates such as class
attendance, and more direct measures such as home exercise
frequency).
Search methods for identification of studies
We imposed no restrictions on language of publication, publica-
tion status (i.e. full publication, grey literature, etc.) or any other
restrictions on the searches described below.
Electronic searches
We drew on the search strategy developed for Cochrane In-
continence. We identified relevant trials from the Cochrane
Incontinence Specialised Register, which is also described un-
der the Cochrane Incontinence module in the Cochrane Li-
brary. The register contains trials identified from the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MED-
LINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print,
CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization In-
ternational Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP),
UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio and handsearching of
journals and conference proceedings. Some of the trials in the
Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register are also contained in
CENTRAL. The date of the last search was 16 February 2017.
The terms used to search the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised
Register are given in Appendix 1.
Searching other resources
We searched for other possible relevant trials in the reference lists
of relevant articles. We performed no tailored search for health
economics studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors assessed all potentially eligible studies without
prior consideration of the results. We resolved any disagreements
by discussion and, where these were not resolved, a third review
author had final responsibility. We included only randomised or
quasi-randomised controlled trials, and excluded trials that made
comparisons other than those prespecified. Excluded studies are
listed, with reasons for their exclusion, in the Characteristics of
excluded studies.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently undertook data extraction onto
a proforma and cross-checked them. We resolved any differences
by discussion. Where trial data were possibly collected but not
reported, or data were reported in a form that could not be used in
the formal comparisons, we sought further clarification from the
trialists. We processed all included trial data as described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently evaluated the methodological
quality of the included trials using the ’Risk of bias’ tool devel-
oped for Cochrane. We considered random sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel,
blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and
other bias and deemed each category at low, high or unclear risk
of bias. Where there was insufficient information to make a clear
decision, trials were rated at ’unclear risk.’ Any disagreements were
resolved by discussion.
Allocation (selection bias)
When considering random sequence bias, we assessed whether the
method used to generate the allocation sequence in each study
would allow an assessment of whether it produced comparable
groups. We assessed the method as:
• low risk of bias: any truly random process such as
computer-generated random number sequences;
• high risk of bias: any non-random process such as allocation
by birth date or bed number;
• unclear risk of bias.
For assessing allocation concealment, we determined the meth-
ods to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in ad-
vance or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We as-
sessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias: all forms of remote or web-based allocation
and sequentially numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes;
• high risk of bias: open random allocation, envelopes where
not all the above criteria were met (not sequentially numbered,
unsealed, non-opaque), all methods of alternation;
• unclear risk of bias.
Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)
We did not have any criteria for performance bias as it was not
considered feasible due to the nature of the intervention to blind
the personnel or participants to group allocation. It is likely that
this lack of blinding would unfortunately influence the results of
the review.

 We did not have any criteria for detection bias as it was not con-
sidered feasible to blind participants to the assessment of the two a
priori outcomes of this review (prevalence of incontinence and in-
continence quality of life) as both were self-reported. We assessed
blinding separately for other outcomes, such as the pad test and
PFM function measures.
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
For each outcome, we described the completeness of data, includ-
ing attrition and exclusions from the analysis. In making a judge-
ment about attrition bias, we considered the:
• proportion of the total sample lost to follow-up and the
adequacy of any imputation methods used for missing data;
• similarity in proportion of losses by group;
• whether reasons were provided for losses and whether these
differed by group;
• if participants were analysed in the group to which they
were assigned.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias: trials with 10% or less loss to follow-up and
without a differential loss to follow-up;
• high risk of bias: trials with more than 20% loss to follow-
up without appropriate imputation methods or trials in which
participants were not analysed in the group to which they were
randomised;
• unclear risk of bias: when the proportion of dropouts was
between 10% and 20% without appropriate imputation methods
(with no major differential or lack of similar reasons between
groups) or when there was no reporting of losses to follow-up.
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
For each included trial, we determined the possibility of selective
outcome reporting bias and described what we found based on the
following criteria:
• low risk of bias: it was clear that all of the trial’s prespecified
outcomes were reported;
• high risk of bias: not all of the trial’s prespecified outcomes
were reported, a primary outcome was not prespecified,
outcomes of interest to the review and for which data were
collected, were reported incompletely and so could not be used;
• unclear risk of bias: a lack of detail in reporting made it
difficult to assess whether all prespecified outcomes were
presented.
Other bias
For each included study, we described any important concerns
we had about other possible sources of bias that had not previ-
ously been considered in the categories above. In particular, we
looked for a declaration of conflict of interest and the funding
source. Other sources of bias were reported in the Characteristics
of included studies.
Measures of treatment effect
For categorical outcomes, we related the numbers reporting an
outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk
ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous
variables, we used means and standard deviations (SD) to derive
mean differences (MD). Where possible, data from different stud-
ies were pooled using a fixed-effect model.
Some trials measured outcomes at more than one time point, usu-
ally in trials where PFMT began antenatally. There were some dif-
ferences in the timing of outcome measures but, for the meta-anal-
ysis, timing seemed to fall into the following clinical categories:
• late pregnancy (from 20 weeks’ gestation up to delivery);
• early postnatal (zero to three months after delivery);
• mid-postnatal (more than three to six months after
delivery);
• late postnatal (more than six to 12 months after delivery);
• medium term (more than one to five years after index
delivery);
• long-term (more than five to 10 years after index delivery);
• very long-term (more than 10 years after index delivery).
Where a trial took measures at two time points within a single
category (e.g. at eight and 12 months after delivery), we used
the data from the longer time period. Few medium-, long- and
very long-term data were available. Accordingly, these data were
reported in text and not forest plots.
Unit of analysis issues
The primary unit of analysis was per women randomised.
For the meta-analysis of multi-arm studies, the data from the
PFMT intervention arms were combined for comparison with the
control arm. The mean and standard deviation for the combined
data were calculated according to the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Dealing with missing data
Where possible, the trial data were analysed according to the in-
tention-to-treat principle, that is by the randomised groups, and
irrespective of whether women received treatment according to
their randomised allocation. We did not impute missing outcome
data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
The extent of heterogeneity was assessed in three ways: visual in-
spection of data plots, Chi² test for heterogeneity and the I² statis-
tic (Higgins 2011). Possible explanations for the heterogeneity
were sought and discussed.

 Assessment of reporting biases
To minimise reporting bias, the review authors undertook a com-
prehensive search for eligible trials and were vigilant for duplica-
tion of data.
Data synthesis
We used the Mantel-Haenszel methods with a fixed-effect model
approach in the meta-analyses in this review, unless statistically
significant heterogeneity (Chi² test, P < 0.10) in the comparison
suggested a more conservative random-effect model was indicated.
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ tables
We created ’Summary of findings’ tables using the following out-
comes:
• urinary incontinence in late pregnancy (antenatal PFMT
trials only);
• urinary incontinence mid-postnatal period (antenatal
PFMT trials only);
• urinary incontinence late postnatal period;
• faecal incontinence in late pregnancy (antenatal PFMT
trials only);
• faecal incontinence mid-postnatal period (antenatal PFMT
trials only);
• faecal incontinence late postnatal period;
• incontinence-specific quality of life.
For antenatal PFMT trials, we assessed the evidence in late preg-
nancy (postintervention effect) and the mid-postnatal period
(durability of effect postdelivery). In postnatal training trials, we
assessed the evidence in the late postnatal period (sustained postin-
tervention effect). We used the five GRADE considerations (study
limitations, inconsistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and
publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence as it
related to the studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses for
the prespecified outcomes (Atkins 2004). We used methods and
recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using
GRADEpro GDT software (GRADEpro GDT; Higgins 2011).
We justified all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of
studies using footnotes and made comments to aid the reader’s
understanding of the review where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
In each comparison, trials were subgrouped according to the con-
trol comparison because, a priori, we thought it plausible that the
size or direction of effect would be influenced by the control con-
dition. The four subgroups were:
• PFMT versus no PFMT;
• PFMT versus unspecified control (i.e. the trialist gave
insufficient information about the control condition to classify it
as one of the others);
• PFMT versus usual care;
• PFMT (more intensive, e.g. addition of biofeedback) versus
PFMT (less intensive).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis with respect to trial quality was planned, as
there is some evidence that the adequacy of randomisation (se-
quence generation and allocation concealment) may have an im-
pact on the findings of a meta-analysis (Moher 1998). However,
there were insufficient trials and too many other potential causes
of heterogeneity to make this useful.

The previous version of the review included 49 reports of 22 stud-
ies (Boyle 2012). The search update yielded 831 titles and ab-
stracts and 121 records were obtained for further assessment. We
included 48 reports from 17 new studies. The updated review now
synthesises data from 94 reports of 38 studies that randomised
9892 women (4939 PFMT, 4953 controls) from 20 countries.
One trial included in the previous review did not meet the eligibil-
ity criteria for the intervention and was excluded from the update
(Dannecker 2004; see Excluded studies). Forty-six reports of 38
studies were excluded from the update and reasons are given in the
Characteristics of excluded studies. In addition, 15 studies were
classified as ongoing (see the Characteristics of ongoing studies)
and eight require further assessment to determine eligibility (see
the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification).
Three papers were published in Chinese and the data were ex-
tracted by translators for screening and further analysis (Kou 2013;
Liu 2011; Wen 2010).
Included studies
The review includes 38 trials and further details are provided in
the Characteristics of included studies.
• Seven were primary or secondary prevention trials (i.e. none
of the women had incontinence symptoms at the start of
training) (Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004; Kocaoz
2013; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Stothers 2002). Two trials
provided subgroup data for women continent at randomisation
(Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998). All nine investigated the effect
of beginning PFMT antenatally.
• Ten were treatment trials (i.e. all women had incontinence
symptoms at the start of training). These investigated the effects
of beginning PFMT antenatally and postnatally (Ahlund 2013;
Cruz 2014; Dinc 2009; Dumoulin 2004; Glazener 2001; Kim
2012; Sangsawang 2016; Skelly 2004; Wilson 1998; Woldringh
2007).
• Twenty-one were mixed prevention or treatment trials as
some women did, and others did not, have incontinence
13

 symptoms at the start of training. These trials investigated the
effects of starting PFMT antenatally or postnatally (Assis 2015;
Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002; Dokmeci 2008; Ewings 2005; Fritel
2015; Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Hilde 2013; Hughes 2001;
Ko 2011; Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Meyer 2001; Miquelutti 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Peirce 2013; Sampselle 1998; Sleep 1987; Stafne
2012; Wen 2010).
Twenty of the 38 studies were included in the previous version
of this review (Assis 2015; Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002; Dinc 2009;
Dumoulin 2004; Ewings 2005; Glazener 2001; Gorbea 2004;
Hughes 2001; Ko2011; Meyer2001; Mørkved 2003; Reilly2002;
Sampselle 1998; Skelly 2004; Sleep 1987; Stafne 2012; Stothers
2002; Wilson 1998; Woldringh 2007). Two trials were previously
included in abstract form (Assis 2015; Stafne 2012).
The primary reference for eight trials was a conference abstract
(Cruz 2014; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Gaier
2010; Hughes 2001; Skelly2004; Stothers 2002). No further pub-
lished reports were found for seven of these eight trials and one tri-
alist kindly provided additional data from a thesis (Hughes 2001).
One-to-one randomisation was assumed (the numbers in the in-
tervention (139 women) and control (129 women) groups sug-
gested this was likely) for one trial so that data could be used in
the meta-analysis (Skelly 2004).
Nineteen of the 38 included studies were publicly funded (uni-
versity or national research funds or charitable trust) and one
received grants from both public and private sources (Glazener
2001). Three studies did not receive any specific funding (Ahlund
2013; Barakat 2011; Kim 2012). Sixteen studies did not declare
funding sources (Assis 2015; Bø 2011; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014;
Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004; Hughes 2001; Kim
2012; Kocaoz 2013; Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Pelaez 2014; Skelly
2004; Stothers 2002; Wen 2010). Fourteen trials declared no con-
flicts of interest (Ahlund 2013; Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002; Dinc
2009; Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015; Glazener 2001; Hilde 2013;
Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Peirce 2013; Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang
2016; Stafne 2012). The remaining 14 trials did not report fund-
ing.
In all, 34 of the 38 trials contributed data to one or more meta-
analysis.
Settings
Women were recruited from various health services including an-
tenatal and urology clinics, outpatient physiotherapy clinics, gy-
naecology and obstetric departments, and hospital settings in the
following 20 countries: Australia (Chiarelli 2002), Brazil (Assis
2015; Cruz 2014; Miquelutti 2013), Canada (Dumoulin 2004;
Skelly 2004; Stothers 2002), China (Ko 2011; Kou 2013; Liu
2011; Wen 2010), England (Ewings 2005; Glazener 2001; Reilly
2002; Sleep 1987), France (Fritel 2015), Ireland (Peirce 2013),
Italy (Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010), Mexico (Gorbea 2004),
Netherlands (Woldringh 2007), New Zealand (Glazener 2001;
Wilson 1998), Norway (Bø 2011; Hilde 2013; Mørkved 2003;
Stafne 2012), Republic of Korea (Kim 2012), Scotland (Glazener
2001), Spain(Barakat 2011; Pelaez2014), Sweden(Ahlund2013),
Switzerland (Meyer 2001), Thailand (Sangsawang 2016), Turkey
(Dinc 2009; Dokmeci 2008; Kocaoz 2013), and the US (Frost
2014; Sampselle 1998).
Sample characteristics
Parity (number of births)
Seven studies did not report parity or gravidity (Cruz 2014; Frost
2014; Frumenzio 2012; Kocaoz 2013; Skelly 2004; Stothers 2002;
Wen 2010). Five of these were conference abstracts (Cruz 2014;
Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Skelly 2004; Stothers 2002). Tri-
als that investigated the effects of antenatal PFMT for prevention
of urinary incontinence recruited only continent women in their
first pregnancy or having their first baby (or both), which trialists
variously called nulliparous or primiparous women, or continent
women regardless of parity (Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010; Gorbea
2004; Pelaez2014; Reilly2002). Trialstestingantenatallyfortreat-
ment of incontinence included women in their first pregnancy
or nulliparae or multiparae women (Dinc 2009; Sangsawang
2016; Woldringh 2007). In trials of postnatal PFMT for treat-
ment of urinary incontinence, all but one (Ahlund 2013, prim-
iparous) recruited nulliparae or multiparae women (Dumoulin
2004; Glazener 2001; Kim 2012; Wilson 1998). In the mixed
prevention and treatment studies investigating antenatal PFMT,
most recruited women in their first pregnancy or who were hav-
ing their first baby (Assis 2015; Bø 2011; Dokmeci 2008; Fritel
2015; Hughes 2001; Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003;
Sampselle 1998). One included both nulliparae and multiparae
(Stafne 2012). In the mixed prevention and treatment trials of
postnatal PFMT, four included women who had just had their
first baby (Hilde 2013; Liu 2011; Meyer 2001; Peirce 2013). The
other three recruited mixed nulliparae and multiparae (Chiarelli
2002; Ewings 2005; Sleep 1987). In the trials with mixed parity
samples, it is unknown if parity was comparable in six trials (Cruz
2014; Frumenzio 2012; Kocaoz 2013; Kou 2013; Skelly 2004;
Stothers 2002). It was not comparable in one trial (Barakat 2011).
Age
Participant age was variously described, although five trials did not
report this (Cruz 2014; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014; Peirce 2013;
Skelly 2004). Three trials reported an age range, with women aged
between their early 20s to early 40s (Kou 2013; Stothers 2002;
Wen 2010). In two trials, about 50% to 60% of the women were
aged 20 to 29 years (Chiarelli 2002; Ewings 2005). Median age
was about 28 years in two trials (Hughes 2001; Reilly 2002) and
36 years in another trial (Dumoulin 2004). In the remaining 24
studies, the mean age was in the early 20s (Miquelutti 2013),
14

 mid to late 20s for 14 trials (Assis 2015; Dinc 2009; Fritel 2015;
Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004; Kocaoz 2013; Liu 2011; Meyer 2001;
Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014; Sampselle 1998; Sangsawang 2016;
Sleep 1987; Wilson 1998), and early 30s for 10 trials (Ahlund
2013; Barakat 2011; Bø 2011; Frumenzio 2012; Glazener 2001;
Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Ko 2011; Stafne 2012; Woldringh 2007).
Age was comparable at baseline between groups in 29 trials but was
unclear in the other nine (Cruz 2014; Dokmeci 2008; Frumenzio
2012; Kou 2013; Meyer 2001; Peirce 2013; Skelly 2004; Stothers
2002; Wen 2010).
Weight
Twenty-two of the 38 trials reported bodyweight or BMI. For the
women recruited antenatally, mean or median BMI was in the
low to mid 20s (Barakat 2011; Bø 2011; Fritel 2015; Gaier 2010;
Hughes 2001; Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Pelaez
2014; Reilly 2002; Sangsawang 2016; Stafne 2012; Woldringh
2007). Two trials reported that mean bodyweight in kilograms was
in the mid 60s on average (Assis 2015, 67 kg; Gorbea 2004, 66 kg).
About 30% of women had a BMI in the overweight or obese range
in one trial that recruited women antenatally and in two that re-
cruited women on postnatal wards (Chiarelli 2002; Ewings 2005;
Kocaoz 2013). In three trials that recruited postnatal women with
persistent incontinence symptoms, the mean or median BMI was
in the normal range (Ahlund 2013; Dumoulin 2004; Kim 2012).
BMI was about 26 kg/m² in one mixed treatment and prevention
study which recruited women postnatally (Hilde 2013). BMI or
bodyweight was comparable at baseline between groups for all of
these trials, although two trials noted that weight gain in preg-
nancy differed significantly between the groups, being greater in
either the PFMT group or in the control group (Barakat 2011;
Gorbea 2004).
Type of delivery
Some details on delivery were given by 11 of 15 trials that be-
gan PFMT after delivery. In eight of these trials, all women de-
livered vaginally (Chiarelli 2002; Frost 2014; Hilde 2013; Kim
2012; Liu 2011; Peirce 2013; Sleep1987; Wen 2010). In the study
by Chiarelli 2002, all women had a forceps or ventouse delivery,
while Peirce 2013 reported that about 39% of women had an in-
strumental delivery. The types of delivery appeared comparable
across the PFMT and control groups in both trials. In the trials by
Glazener 2001 and Wilson 1998, some women had a caesarean
section (about 8% in Glazener 2001 and 18% in Wilson 1998)
with the proportion of caesarean sections being similar in both
the PFMT and control groups for both trials. Glazener 2001 also
reported that about 14% of women in both the PFMT and con-
trol groups had assisted vaginal deliveries. In the remaining small
trial by Meyer 2001, it was unclear if all 107 women delivered
vaginally but it was reported that 30% of PFMT group and 16%
of control group women had forceps delivery; this difference was
not “statistically significant” (P = 0.10).
For the trials in which PFMT began antenatally, it is possible that
the type of delivery was affected by PFMT. For these trials, the
type of delivery was a possible confounder of the postnatal incon-
tinence outcome but may itself be an outcome of importance. A
short summary of the data is given here. The data are also reported
in more detail in the analysis. Some details on the type of delivery,
by group, were given by only 13 of the 23 trials in which PFMT
began antenatally. In 11 trials, the delivery type was similar across
both comparison groups (Barakat 2011; Fritel 2015; Frost 2014;
Hughes 2001; Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Reilly
2002; Sampselle 1998; Stothers 2002; Woldringh 2007). How-
ever, in two trials, there seemed to be fewer vaginal deliveries in
the PFMT group (Dinc 2009; Gorbea 2004). Miquelutti 2013
reported a “statistically significantly” longer duration of delivery
in the PFMT group (MD 9.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 18.64; P < 0.05).
Exclusion criteria
The most common exclusion criterion (in 27 trials) was a co-
morbidity that contraindicated exercise in pregnancy or made
PFMT difficult (or both), or might have altered the outcome
of training, such as serious medical or neuromuscular condi-
tions. Ten trials excluded women with high-risk pregnancies (Bø
2011; Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015; Gorbea 2004; Ko 2011; Meyer
2001; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Sangsawang 2016; Stafne
2012). Sixteen trials included women with singleton pregnan-
cies or excluded women with twins, or other multiple pregnan-
cies or births (Ahlund 2013; Barakat 2011; Bø 2011; Cruz 2014;
Fritel 2015; Gorbea 2004; Hilde 2013; Liu 2011; Meyer 2001;
Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang 2016;
Stafne 2012; Stothers 2002; Wen 2010). Eight excluded women if
the baby was stillborn or was very ill or died after birth (Chiarelli
2002; Ewings 2005; Glazener 2001; Hilde 2013; Mørkved 2003;
Peirce 2013; Sleep 1987; Stafne 2012). Five excluded women if
language difficulties meant it was difficult to seek informed con-
sent (Chiarelli 2002; Dumoulin 2004; Ewings 2005; Peirce 2013;
Woldringh 2007). An additional six outlined language require-
ments as part of their inclusion criteria (Bø 2011; Cruz 2014;
Fritel 2015; Hilde 2013; Peirce 2013; Pelaez 2014). Four trials
specifically excluded women who experienced pain with a PFM
contraction (Dinc 2009; Ko 2011; Mørkved 2003; Sangsawang
2016).
Pelvic floor muscle training regimens and control
interventions
The PFMT and control interventions are described in the
Characteristics of included studies (overview) and in Table 1 (de-
tails of exercise parameters and adherence).
First,the PFMTprogrammeswere classifiedbytheirpossible phys-
iological effect(s) (strength, endurance, co-ordination or a combi-
15

 nation), based on the described exercise parameters. Second, the
amount of contact or supervision from health professionals (low
fewer than five contacts; moderate six to 12 contacts; high more
than 12 contacts), confirmation of a correct PFM contraction and
nature of the control interventions were examined. Third, adher-
ence data were considered to assess whether exercise behaviour
was likely to support a physiological effect. Trials were classified
according to whether they provided data for both the intervention
and control groups, the intervention group only or neither group.
The likely impact of the exercise programmes on PFM function
and the clinical difference between the intervention and control
conditions are considered in the Discussion.
We categorised 11 trials as providing strength training and six as
probably strength training trials, 17 in all.
• Eleven trials clearly provided exercise parameters that
favoured strength training; short duration contractions of
maximal or near maximal effort and a relatively small number of
repetitions (Ahlund 2013; Bø 2011; Dinc 2009; Dumoulin
2004; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Kocaoz 2013; Miquelutti 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998; Stafne 2012). The exercise
protocol described by Bø 1995 was the PFM strength training
protocol on which the trials by Bø 2011, Mørkved 2003, and
Dumoulin 2004 were based. Supervised treatment duration was
only eight weeks in the trials by Dumoulin 2004 and Kim 2012
and this might have been insufficient for muscle hypertrophy to
be established. In addition to strength training, Dumoulin 2004
included some co-ordination type training. Women were
encouraged to perform voluntary PFM contraction in
conjunction with rises in intra-abdominal pressure, such as with
coughing or sneezing, also known as ’the Knack’ (Miller 2008).
Kim 2012 included trunk stabilisation exercises. With regard to
contact with health professionals, this was low in two trials
(fewer than five contacts) (Ahlund 2013; Miquelutti 2013),
moderate (six to 12 contacts) in four (Dumoulin 2004; Kocaoz
2013; Mørkved 2003; Stafne 2012) and high (more than 12
contacts) in three (Bø 2011; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012). Four trials
stated that PFMT was supervised in an exercise class (Bø 2011;
Hilde 2013; Mørkved 2003; Stafne 2012). Eight trials confirmed
a correct voluntary PFM contraction prior to training (Ahlund
2013; Dinc 2009; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Kocaoz 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998; Stafne 2012). Five of these also
confirmed a correct contraction in the control group along with
provision of usual antenatal and postnatal care (Ahlund 2013;
Dinc 2009; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Mørkved 2003). In the
remaining six trials, the control conditions were usual care, which
may or may not have included PFMT or no PFMT as controls
were asked not to train (Bø 2011; Dumoulin 2004; Kocaoz
2013; Miquelutti 2013; Sampselle 1998; Stafne 2012). With
regard to adherence, five trials reported some information about
exercise behaviour and four of these compared group exercise
classes and home PFMT versus usual care (Bø 2011; Hilde 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Stafne 2012). The fifth trial with adherence data
compared standardised instruction and home PFMT with usual
care (Sampselle 1998). In Stafne 2012, 67% of the PFMT group
performed home PFMT at least three times per week compared
to 40% of controls in late pregnancy. At six months’ postpartum,
Hilde 2013 found that 96% of the PFMT group who completed
the trial adhered to 80% of the class and daily home training,
whereas 16.5% of controls reported daily PFMT at home, three
or more times per week. The other three trials reported data only
for the intervention group, with adherence to PFMT of about
70% (Bø 2011) and 80% (Mørkved 2003), or 85% of PFMT
women doing PFMT 75% of the time (Sampselle 1998).
• Six trials described PFMT programmes that were
characteristic of strength training but did not mention loading
(effort) (Assis 2015; Chiarelli 2002; Gorbea 2004; Ko 2011;
Peirce 2013; Reilly 2002). Two trials referenced the exercise
protocols of other authors. Reilly 2002 cited Bø 1995 (strength
and load training) and Ko 2011 cited Reilly 2002. The
supervised treatment duration was only eight weeks in the trial
by Chiarelli 2002 and this may have been insufficient for muscle
hypertrophy to be established. In addition to strength training,
women undertook some co-ordination type training, daily
biofeedback or participated in a weekly exercise class supervised
by a physiotherapist (Ko 2011; Peirce 2013; Reilly 2002). In two
trials, the control groups did not exercise (Assis 2015; Gorbea
2004). In the other four trials, controls were randomised to usual
care which may or may not have included PFMT (Chiarelli
2002; Ko 2011; Peirce 2013; Reilly 2002). A correct PFM
contraction for women in the exercise group was confirmed in
five of the six trials (Assis 2015; Chiarelli 2002; Gorbea 2004;
Ko 2011; Peirce 2013). However, none of the control groups
appeared to have confirmation of a correct contraction. With
regard to adherence, five of the six trials reported some
information about exercise behaviour (Chiarelli 2002; Gorbea
2004; Ko 2011; Peirce 2013; Reilly 2002). Five trials offered
individual supervision (Assis 2015; Chiarelli 2002; Gorbea 2004;
Peirce 2013; Reilly 2002). One offered group sessions (Ko 2011).
At three months’ postpartum, Chiarelli 2002 reported that more
women in the PFMT group (84%) compared to controls (58%)
were doing “adequate” PFMT. Similarly, in Reilly 2002, about
75% of the PFMT group and 66% of the control group were
doing more than occasional or no PFMT (27.5% in the PFMT
group and 34% in the control group reported occasional or no
PFMT). During the antenatal intervention period, nearly half
the women in the PFMT group exercised for 28 days or more
(which is approximately once per week over 20 weeks). The
other three trials reported data only for the intervention group,
with two reporting that over 80% of women attended most or all
supervised visits (Gorbea 2004; Ko 2011). Ko 2011 and Peirce
2013 reported that more than three-quarters of women in the
PFMT group completed 70% or more of the prescribed exercise.
There was insufficient detail in the other 21 trials to classify them
16

 as providing strength or endurance training.
• Seven trials provided some information about PFMT but
could not be categorised (Glazener 2001; Kou 2013; Liu 2011;
Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang 2016; Wen 2010; Wilson 1998). None
had any description of effort (i.e. load). Supervised treatment
was only six to eight weeks in two trials and this might have been
insufficient for muscle hypertrophy to be established if
strengthening was intended (Sangsawang 2016; Wen 2010). Five
of the seven trials included variously described mixes of fast and
slow contractions with relatively large numbers of sets (eight to
10 per day) and few repetitions per set (about 10) or exercise sets
of 15- to 30-minute duration (Glazener 2001; Pelaez 2014;
Sangsawang 2016; Wen 2010; Wilson 1998). Overall, all
appeared to recommend a large number of contractions per day
(more than 100) or a minimum of 30 minutes of PFMT per day.
The programmes might have affected strength or endurance, or
both, depending on the number of contractions performed daily
and the amount of voluntary effort with each contraction. The
amount of contact with healthcare providers varied. In two trials,
women participated in group exercise sessions, either three
groups over a period of six weeks or a total of 70 to 80 groups
over 22 weeks (Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang 2016). In another two
trials, women had one-to-one sessions with health professionals,
with three or four visits spread over eight to nine months
(Glazener 2001; Wilson 1998). In three trials, the number and
duration of contacts with healthcare providers was unknown
(Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Wen 2010), although it is possible this
was twice per week in the trial that included biofeedback (Kou
2013). Only three trials mention confirmation of correct PFM
contraction, being verified by an obstetrician or by the women
themselves using self-palpation, mirror observation of the
perineum or mid-stream urine stoppage (Pelaez 2014;
Sangsawang 2016; Wen 2010). In all trials, the control group
received usual care that may have included advice or
opportunities to do PFMT (e.g. in an antenatal class), with the
exception of Sangsawang 2016 where women received usual care
but no information on urinary incontinence or PFMT. Four
trials provided some adherence data. The women in the trials by
Glazener 2001 and Wilson 1998 were supervised individually
and performed significantly more voluntary PFM contractions
per day at 12 months’ postpartum in the PFMT groups. The
mean number of contractions was 20 (SD 29) and 86 (95% CI
69 to 104) per day in PFMT women, and 5 (SD 15) and 35
(95% CI 30 to 40) per day in control women. Glazener 2001
followed up women for six years after the index delivery. Similar
proportions of women in both groups were doing some PFMT,
50% (132/263) in the intervention group and 50% (127/253) in
the control group. The other two trials offered group supervision
and reported adherence data for the training groups only. Pelaez
2014 reported that all PFMT women attended at least 80% of
the exercise sessions (approximately 70 to 78 in total). In the trial
by Sangsawang 2016, it appeared that all women had done
PFMT for 28 days (of 42 in total).
• Fourteen trials did not specify any details of the PFMT
received by intervention group (Barakat 2011; Cruz 2014;
Dokmeci 2008; Ewings 2005; Fritel 2015; Frost 2014;
Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010; Hughes 2001; Meyer 2001; Skelly
2004; Sleep 1987; Stothers 2002; Woldringh 2007). Eight of
these were conference abstracts (Cruz 2014; Dokmeci 2008;
Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010; Hughes 2001; Skelly
2004; Stothers 2002). Four trials mentioned that women were
asked to do daily PFMT at home (Fritel 2015; Frumenzio 2012;
Hughes 2001; Stothers 2002). One asked women to complete a
daily exercise diary (Sleep 1987). Most trials provided one or
more one-to-one supervisory sessions with a health professional,
two invited women to one or two additional group sessions
(Ewings 2005; Hughes 2001). Barakat 2011 provided PFMT
within approximately 85 exercise classes over the course of
pregnancy. Three trials confirmed a correct PFM contraction
either by digital palpation or observation and palpation of the
perineal body (Fritel 2015; Hughes 2001; Woldringh 2007).
The control conditions were: no PFMT (Frumenzio 2012;
Meyer 2001; Stothers 2002), usual care (which may or may not
have included advice on PFMT) (Frost 2014; Gaier 2010;
Hughes 2001; Skelly 2004), usual care that included advice
about PFMT (Ewings 2005; Sleep 1987; Woldringh 2007), and
PFMT at home (Cruz 2014; Fritel 2015). In two trials, the
control condition was unclear (Barakat 2011; Dokmeci 2008).
In five of the 14 trials, no information was provided about
adherence, or the number of contacts with health professionals
in either the intervention or control groups (Cruz 2014;
Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010). All
were abstracts. Six of the 14 trials provided some information
about exercise behaviour (Barakat 2011; Ewings 2005; Fritel
2015; Hughes 2001; Sleep 1987; Woldringh 2007). Three trials
reported adherence data for both the intervention and control
groups (Fritel 2015; Sleep 1987; Woldringh 2007). In the trial
by Fritel 2015, 69% of women in the PFMT group completed
all eight supervised weekly exercise sessions and 83% completed
at least one. Fewer women in the PFMT group (4.3%) compared
to controls (10.6%) were doing daily exercise at home at the end
of pregnancy. Woldringh 2007 reported that 37% of the PFMT
women were exercising intensively, compared to 14% of controls,
at 36 weeks’ gestation. Similarly, at three months’ postpartum,
Sleep 1987 reported that more women in the PFMT group
(58%) compared to controls (42%) were doing some PFMT.
The other three trials provided data only for the intervention
group (Barakat 2011; Ewings 2005; Hughes 2001). Barakat
2011 reported “adherence to training in the experimental group
was 90%” (a mean of 85 sessions in total) and Hughes 2001
(personal communication) observed that 79% of women
assigned to PFMT attended the single group training session. In
contrast, Ewings 2005 invited PFMT women to attend a class at
two and four months postnatally and, of the 117 women, only
17

 18% attended at two months and 4% attended at four months.
Outcome measures
Twenty-five of the 38 trials clearly stated the primary outcome(s)
of interest in the trial.
• In 17 trials, it was self-reported urinary incontinence (Assis
2015; Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002; Cruz 2014; Ewings 2005; Fritel
2015; Glazener 2001; Gorbea 2004; Hilde 2013; Ko 2011; Kou
2013; Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Sangsawang
2016; Skelly 2004; Stafne 2012). Three used the International
Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form
(ICIQ-SF) (Cruz 2014; Fritel 2015; Pelaez 2014).
• Three trials used loss of urine under stress test (Dumoulin
2004; Kocaoz 2013; Stothers 2002).
• One trial used the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract
Symptoms (BFLUTS; 34 question tool, higher score worse)
questionnaire, quality of life domain (Kim 2012).
• One trial combined data from a urinary diary and
questionnaire to give an incontinence severity score (Woldringh
2007).
• One trial used the unspecified “urinary condition score”
(Liu 2011).
• One trial used PFM strength (perineometry) (Ahlund
2013).
• One trial used the occurrence of traumatic tears and use of
episiotomy (Gaier 2010).
While there was some consistency in the choice of outcome mea-
sures by trialists, the differences in the measures or the way the
data were reported limited the possibilities for combining results
from individual trials.
Only three trials reported long-term results after the first year
(Glazener 2001; Mørkved 2003; Reilly 2002).
Excluded studies
Thirty-eight trials were excluded for the following reasons.
• Twenty-eight studies did not collect any urinary or faecal
incontinence outcome data (Agur 2005; Assis 2013; Barakat
2014; Barakat 2016; Dias 2011; Domingues 2015; Dougherty
1989; Golmakani 2015; Hou 2010; Huang 2014; Lekskulchai
2014; Li 2010; Liu 2013; Mahmoodi 2014; Morin 2015;
NCT01696201; NCT01723293; NCT01753622; Nielsen
1988; Norton 1990; Oblasser 2016; Okido 2015; Perales 2016;
Ruiz 2013; Siva 2014; Thorp 1994; Wang 2014; Zhu 2012).
• Three trials compared the Epi-No device versus control
(Dannecker 2004; Dietz 2014; Kamisan Atan 2016). The
women were recruited in very late pregnancy (33 to 37 weeks’
gestation) and the primary purpose of the intervention was
prevention of perineal trauma. In one trial, it seemed women did
PFM contractions with the Epi-No device in the vagina
(Dannecker 2004). However, this was unclear in the other two
(Dietz 2014; Kamisan Atan 2016).
• Four trials included PFMT as part of an intervention but
the actual comparisons were: active versus sham magnetic
stimulation (Culligan 2005), one type of feedback versus another
(Fynes 1999; Mahony 2004), and PFMT plus episiotomy versus
caesarean section (Taskin 1996). Another trial compared
abdominal exercise with no abdominal exercise (Gouldthorpe
2003).
• One study was excluded because of internal inconsistencies
and data discrepancies (Mason 2010).
• One trial was listed in a trials register but there was no
report of this trial available. There was no response to a letter
sent to the principal investigator (Mason 1999).
Risk of bias in included studies
We have provided details for each trial in the Characteristics of
included studies. A summary of the risk of bias for each individual
trial is presented in Figure 2, while Figure 3 summarises the risk
of bias across all trials included in the review.

Due to the brevity of reporting, it was difficult to assess the
eight trials that were published as conference abstracts (Cruz
2014; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010;
Hughes 2001; Skelly 2004; Stothers 2002). In addition, one of
these abstracts did not report sample size (Skelly 2004). How-
ever, one-to-one randomisation was assumed. Three trials were
small, with fewer than 25 women per comparison group (Dokmeci
2008; Dumoulin 2004; Kim 2012). Ten were of moderate size,
with between 25 and 50 women per group (Ahlund 2013; Assis
2015; Barakat 2011; Cruz 2014; Dinc 2009; Frumenzio 2012;
Gorbea 2004; Sampselle 1998; Sangsawang 2016; Stothers 2002).
Twenty-one trials allocated more than 50 women per group (Bø
2011; Chiarelli 2002; Ewings 2005; Fritel 2015; Frost 2014;
Gaier 2010; Glazener 2001; Hilde 2013; Hughes 2001; Ko 2011;
Kocaoz 2013; Kou2013; Liu 2011; Meyer2001; Miquelutti 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Stafne 2012; Wen 2010;
Woldringh 2007). Three of these were large, that is, with more
than 300 women per comparison group (Chiarelli 2002; Glazener
2001; Stafne 2012). Two were very large trials of more than 500
women per group (Hughes 2001; Sleep 1987). Peirce 2013 used
blockrandomisation,meaning30 womenwere allocatedto PFMT
and biofeedback and 90 women were included in the PFMT-only
group. Wilson and colleagues randomised just over 100 women
to the control and individual treatment groups, with the individ-
ual treatment group being further randomised into three groups:
PFMT only, PFMT with vaginal cones and vaginal cones only
(Wilson 1998).
Twenty-two of the 38 trials reported an a priori power calcula-
tion (Ahlund 2013; Assis 2015; Barakat 2011; Chiarelli 2002;
Dinc 2009; Dumoulin 2004; Fritel 2015; Glazener 2001; Gorbea
2004; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Ko 2011; Meyer 2001; Miquelutti
2013; Mørkved 2003; Peirce 2013; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002;
Sangsawang 2016; Sleep 1987; Stafne 2012; Woldringh 2007).
One of the trials without a power calculation was a pilot trial
(Ewings 2005).
Allocation
Random allocation generation
Twenty-two trials provided enough information on random allo-
cation generation for us to be reasonably sure that they had a low
risk of bias (Assis 2015; Barakat 2011; Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002;
Cruz 2014; Dumoulin 2004; Ewings 2005; Fritel 2015; Glazener
2001; Gorbea 2004; Hilde 2013; Hughes 2001; Miquelutti 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Peirce 2013; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Sampselle
1998; Sangsawang 2016; Stafne 2012; Wilson 1998; Woldringh
2007). Fourteen trials provided insufficient information for a
judgement to be made, therefore these trials were at unclear risk
of bias (Ahlund 2013; Dinc 2009; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014;
Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010; Ko 2011; Kou 2013; Liu 2011;
Meyer 2001; Skelly 2004; Sleep 1987; Stothers 2002; Wen 2010).
Two trials were categorised as high risk of bias (Kim 2012; Kocaoz
2013). Kocaoz 2013 used methods suggestive of alternation and
20

Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Kim 2012 provided participants with an envelope from which
they drew one of two cards.
Random allocation concealment
Sixteenstudiesreportedadequate allocationconcealmentandwere
at low risk of bias (Ahlund 2013; Bø 2011; Chiarelli 2002; Cruz
2014; Dumoulin 2004; Ewings 2005; Fritel 2015; Gorbea 2004;
Hilde 2013; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Peirce 2013; Reilly
2002; Sampselle 1998; Sangsawang 2016; Stafne 2012). Two tri-
als were at high risk of bias, being unable to adequately conceal
randomisation (Kim 2012; Kocaoz 2013). The 22 remaining tri-
als were at unclear risk of bias as insufficient information (e.g. not
described or stated “randomised”) was provided.
Blinding
Blinding of participants and therapists
Given the nature of the intervention, it was not feasible for the
included trials to blind the treatment provider or participants to
groupallocationandsoall 38trialswere athigh riskof performance
bias. The difficulty of blinding exercise-based interventions is a
common problem.
Blinding of outcome assessment
Because the two main outcomes of interest in this review, urinary
incontinence and incontinence-specific quality of life, are self-
reported, these are unblinded measures. As a result, all 38 trials
were deemed to be at high risk of detection bias. Blinded outcome
assessment should be possible for some secondary outcomes, such
as pad testing, and 12 trials attempted this (Bø 2011; Chiarelli
2002; Cruz 2014; Dumoulin 2004; Fritel 2015; Glazener 2001;
Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Mørkved 2003; Reilly 2002; Sampselle
1998; Stothers 2002).
Incomplete outcome data
Reporting of dropout and withdrawal and analysis by
intention to treat
Based on the criteria for assessment of attrition bias reported in
the methods (see ’Assessment of risk of bias’ in Included studies),
10 trials were at low risk of attrition bias (Assis 2015; Chiarelli
2002; Dumoulin 2004; Hilde 2013; Kim 2012; Ko 2011; Meyer
2001; Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang 2016; Stothers 2002). Another
10 were at unclear risk (Ahlund 2013; Barakat 2011; Frumenzio
2012; Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Reilly 2002; Skelly 2004; Sleep 1987;
Stafne 2012; Wen 2010). Some trials did not report on losses to
follow-up and were at unclear risk of bias (Bø 2011; Frumenzio
2012; Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Skelly 2004; Wen 2010). Two of these
were abstracts (Frumenzio 2012; Skelly 2004). The remaining 12
trials were at high risk. All trials appeared to analyse participants
in the groups to which they were assigned.
Selective reporting
All outcomes appeared to have been reported in the majority of
trials, with 28 of 38 trials assessed at low risk of bias in this domain.
Eight trials were at high risk of bias. Six of these did not report all
of the prespecified outcome measures (Ahlund 2013; Assis 2015;
Bø 2011; Dokmeci 2008; Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010), and, of
these, two also did not state the a priori primary outcome measure
(Dokmeci 2008; Frumenzio 2012). A further two were at high
risk due to not presenting data that related to a key outcome of
the review (i.e. self-reported urinary incontinence) (Frost 2014;
Kocaoz 2013). Three of these were conference abstracts (Dokmeci
2008; Frost 2014; Frumenzio 2012). Two trials were at unclear
risk of bias as it was uncertain if selective reporting had taken place
(Skelly 2004; Stothers 2002).
Other potential sources of bias
From the 38 trials in this review, we considered 21 to be free of
problems (such as conflict of interest) that could put them at risk
of other bias. We considered the risk of other bias as unclear for
17 trials (Ahlund 2013; Cruz 2014; Dokmeci 2008; Frost 2014;
Frumenzio 2012; Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004; Hughes 2001; Kou
2013; Liu 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Pelaez 2014; Sampselle 1998;
Skelly 2004; Sleep 1987; Stothers 2002; Wen 2010).

There were some data available to explore the hypothesis that
PFMT is better than usual antenatal and postnatal care, or no
treatment, for the prevention or treatment of urinary and faecal
incontinence. The primary analysis investigated the prevalence of
urinary and faecal incontinence. Data for outcomes of secondary
interest (in ’Other data’ tables) are only briefly discussed to give an
indication of whether the findings were broadly consistent with
the pooled data, or not. Thirty-four trials contributed data to one

for prevention of incontinence
Tentrialsreportedantenatal PFMTforpreventionof incontinence
(Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004; Kocaoz 2013; Mørkved
2003; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Sampselle 1998; Sangsawang
2016; Stothers 2002). Seven recruited nulliparous or primiparous
or primigravid women during pregnancy (Gaier 2010; Gorbea
2004; Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Sampselle 1998;
Sangsawang 2016). The other three recruited “pregnant women”
or both primiparous and multiparous women (Barakat 2011;
Kocaoz 2013; Stothers 2002). All women were continent at re-
cruitment.
In all 10 trials, PFMT began during pregnancy. Controls were
asked not to do PFMT, did not receive instruction on PFMT, re-
ceived usual care that might have included information on PFMT,
or the control condition was not specified (Barakat 2011; Gaier
2010; Gorbea 2004; Kocaoz 2013; Mørkved 2003; Pelaez 2014;
Reilly 2002; Sampselle 1998; Sangsawang 2016; Stothers 2002).
Two of these trials were mixed prevention and treatment trials but
published or unpublished data were available for women who were
continent at recruitment (Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998). In
Sampselle 1998, 54/72 women were continent based on a standing
stress test at 20 weeks’ gestation. After dropouts, there were unpub-
lished data from 37 previously continent women (16 PFMT and
21 controls). Mørkved 2003 published data for 207/301 women
who were continent before pregnancy and at 20 weeks’ gestation.
After dropouts, there were data from 193 previously continent
women (94 PFMT and 99 controls). Neither trial was powered
to find differences in the previously continent subgroup, as the
subgroup sizes were small.
Primary outcome
Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence
• Women randomised to PFMT were about 62% less likely
to report urinary incontinence in late pregnancy compared to
controls (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.72; 6 trials, 624 women,
random-effects, I² = 78%, T² = 0.44; low-quality evidence)
(Analysis 1.1).
There was statistically significant heterogeneity in this compari-
son and in both subgroups (PFMT versus no PFMT, PFMT ver-
sus usual care). A random-effects model was used because of the
heterogeneity. Two trials appeared to contribute most to the het-
erogeneity (Gorbea 2004; Pelaez 2014), and both found many
fewer cases of urinary incontinence in the intervention than con-
trol groups. Gorbea 2004 was the only trial that specifically asked
controls not to do PFMT during pregnancy. In addition, as none
of the PFMT women reported urinary incontinence in late preg-
nancy, the point estimate and CIs were perhaps less stable given
there were no events in one of the two comparison groups. In
Pelaez 2014, the PFMT was very intensive and of longer duration
than other trials in the same subgroup. The intervention included
three supervised exercise classes per week for at least 22 weeks and
80% of women attended the maximum number of classes.
• PFMT women were about 62% less likely to report urinary
incontinence, compared to controls, in the early postpartum
period (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.83; 5 trials, 439 women,
random-effects, I² = 74%, T² = 0.55) (Analysis 1.2). There was
statistically significant heterogeneity in this comparison, as well
as in one subgroup (PFMT versus usual care), which included
the trial by Pelaez 2014 (see above).
• PFMT women were still less likely than controls to have
urinary incontinence in the mid-postnatal period (three to six
months), although the difference in risk had reduced to 29%
(RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; 5 trials, 673 women, fixed-
effect, I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.3).
Overall, the pooled estimate favoured PFMT.
• There were not enough participants (44 women; low-
quality evidence) in the trial by Sampselle 1998 to identify
whether there was a difference in prevalence of urinary
incontinence between PFMT women and women in the control
group at 12 months’ postpartum (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.65 to
2.21) (Analysis 1.4).
Two trials measured incontinence at greater than five years
(Mørkved 2003; Reilly 2002; see Table 1 ). The pooled data sug-
gested that the earlier effectiveness of PFMT did not persist in the
long term (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.48; 2 trials, 352 women,
fixed-effect, I² = 25%) (Analysis 1.6). Reilly 2002 found that
68.4% of women randomised to the intervention group were still
performing PFMT, with 38% doing PFMT at least twice per week
after eight years. Mørkved 2003 reported that the same number
of women in the PFMT and control groups (45%) were exercis-
ing at least weekly, six years after the primary study. The lack of
22

 a difference in prevalence rates of incontinence in these three tri-
als suggests that perhaps PFMT is not effective in the long term.
There could be three immediately plausible explanations for this.
The women may have stopped exercising, they may have had sub-
sequent pregnancies or, as shown by Mørkved 2003, women were
performingsimilarPFMTregimensregardlessof which groupthey
had initially been randomised.
None of the 10 trials reported data on the prevalence of either
antenatal or postpartum faecal incontinence.
Incontinence-specific quality of life
Reilly 2002 (King’s Health Questionnaire) and Pelaez 2014
(ICIQ-SF) were the only two trials to mention incontinence-spe-
cific quality of life. Pelaez 2014 found a difference between the
two groups in favour of PFMT (MD -2.42, 95% CI -3.32 to -
1.52; 2 trials, 152 women; moderate-quality evidence) (Analysis
1.13; lower score indicates better incontinence-specific quality of
life). Reilly 2002 did not report their data but stated there was
no difference between the groups on any of the eight subscales
(Analysis 1.14).
Secondary outcomes
Severity of incontinence
Sevenof the 10trialsreportedsome dataonsymptomseverity, such
as frequency or amount of urine leakage (Analysis 1.14) (Barakat
2011; Gorbea 2004; Pelaez 2014; Reilly 2002; Sampselle 1998;
Sangsawang 2016; Stothers 2002). The choice of measures (many
of these of unknown validity) or the ways of reporting these were
highly variable and data reporting was often incomplete. Two of
the most recent trials used individual item scores from the ICIQ-
SF; frequency (item 3) and amount of leakage (item 4) (Barakat
2011; Pelaez 2014). There was a consistent pattern of effect in
favour of PFMT, when compared to usual care, for frequency,
amount and other urinary incontinence severity indices in two
trials (Pelaez 2014; Sangsawang 2016).
Number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes
None of the trials reported number of urinary or faecal inconti-
nence episodes.
Loss of urine under stress test
Three trials reported whether women were continent or not based
on a stress test (positive cough or one-hour pad test) (Gorbea 2004;
Kocaoz 2013; Reilly 2002). Women in the PFMT group were
less likely to be incontinent in late pregnancy (RR 0.36, 95% CI
0.19 to 0.70; 1 trial, 102 women) or in the early postnatal period
(RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.47; 2 trials, 174 women, fixed-effect,
I² = 0%) when compared with no treatment controls (Analysis
1.15; Analysis 1.16) (Gorbea 2004; Kocaoz 2013). There was no
difference between PFMT versus usual care groups in the early
postnatal period (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.29; 1 trial, 148
women) (Analysis 1.16) (Reilly 2002). Two trials used the SF-36
(Barakat 2011; Reilly 2002). In the general health domain, Reilly
2002 reported that the PFMT group scored significantly higher
than the control group at three months’ postpartum (MD 7.2,
95% CI 2.36 to 12.04), while Barakat 2011 found that women
in the PFMT group were more likely to rate their health as very
good (18/34 women in the PFMT group versus 9/33 women in
the control group) (Analysis 1.17).
Other quality of life and health status measures
None of the trials reported other quality of life and health status
measures.
Health economics
None of the trials reported health economic data.
Adverse effects
Only one trial noted any adverse events: two of 43 PFMT women
withdrew due to pelvic floor pain (Stothers 2002). Barakat 2011
stated “there were no exercise-related injuries experienced during
pregnancy.” No other trial reported whether there were adverse
effects or not.
Other outcomes
Pelvic floor muscle function
Three trials measured PFM function (Gaier 2010; Gorbea 2004;
Reilly 2002). However, Gaier 2010 reported no data. Measures
were electromyography and vaginal squeeze pressure (Gorbea
2004; Reilly 2002). The lack of explanation of the type of elec-
tromyography and unusual presentation of the data in Gorbea
2004 made it difficult to interpret the findings. In Reilly 2002,
mean vaginal squeeze pressure was not greater in the PFMT group
than the control group (MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.31 to 3.31) (Analysis
1.18). Gaier 2010 reported significantly higher PFM strength in
women doing PFMT. However, it was unclear how this was mea-
sured and the data were not given in the conference abstract.
Delivery outcome
Five trials reported delivery outcome (Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010;
Gorbea 2004; Reilly 2002; Stothers 2002). However, the data by
23

 Stothers 2002 were not reported by group. Three trials reported
the number of caesarean sections (Barakat 2011; Gorbea 2004;
Reilly 2002). There was no difference between PFMT and control
groups in any of these trials (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.85; 3
trials, 373 women, fixed-effect, I² = 49%) (Analysis 1.19). Two
trials reported type of vaginal delivery (normal or instrumental)
(Barakat 2011; Reilly 2002). Two trials reported perineal trauma
(Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010). There were no apparent differences
between groups for either outcome (Analysis 1.20).
Any other outcome not prespecified but of interest
None of the trials reported any other outcomes not prespecified
but of interest.
Comparison 2: antenatal pelvic floor muscle training
for treatment of incontinence
Four trials reported antenatal PFMT for treatment of inconti-
nence (Cruz 2014; Dinc 2009; Skelly 2004; Woldringh 2007).
Two trials recruited primiparous and multiparous women (Dinc
2009; Woldringh 2007). Two trials reported as abstracts did not
state parity (Cruz 2014; Skelly 2004). In all four trials, the control
group received usual care.
Primary outcome
Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence
• There was no difference in prevalence of urinary
incontinence in late pregnancy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.13;
3 trials, 345 women, random-effects, I² = 71%, T² = 0.11; very
low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.1).
This comparison showed statistically significant heterogeneity; a
random-effects model was used to provide a more conservative
estimate (Analysis 2.1).
• There were no differences in the early postnatal period (RR
0.75, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.53; 2 trials, 292 women, random-effects,
I² = 65%, T² = 0.19) or mid-postnatal period (RR 0.94, 95% CI
0.70 to 1.24; 1 trial, 187 women; very low-quality evidence)
(Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3).
• Two trials measured urinary incontinence in the late
postnatal period. A random-effects model was used because of
statistically significant heterogeneity in this comparison and
there was no difference between groups (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13
to 1.93; 2 trials, 869 women, random-effects, I² = 94%, T² =
0.89; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.4) (Skelly 2004;
Woldringh 2007). Skelly 2004 was available only as a conference
abstract with limited data on which to base a risk of bias
assessment and about half of the women randomised appeared to
have urinary incontinence symptoms pre-pregnancy. In
Woldringh 2007, at 35 weeks’ gestation, about two-thirds of
women in the control group were doing some form of PFMT,
compared to 94% in the PFMT group. These, or other unknown
reasons, could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity.
None of the four trials reported data on the prevalence of either
antenatal or postpartum faecal incontinence.
Incontinence-specific quality of life
Two trials used a validated incontinence-specific quality of life
measure (Cruz 2014, ICIQ-SF; Woldringh 2007, IIQ). Cruz2014
found a better quality of life in PFMT women in late pregnancy
(MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.13 to -0.87; 1 trial, 41 women, low-
quality evidence) (Analysis 2.14; lower score better). Woldringh
2007 categorised IIQ scores, which meant that it was not possible
to interpret these data (Analysis 2.15).
Secondary outcomes
Severity of incontinence
Woldringh 2007 reported on leakage severity, but the validity of
this measure is unknown (Analysis 2.16).
Number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes
None of the trials reported number of urinary or faecal inconti-
nence episodes.
Loss of urine under stress test
None of the trials reported loss of urine under stress test.
Other quality of life and health status measures
None of the trials reported other quality of life and health status
measures.
Health economics
None of the trials reported health economic data.
Adverse effects
None of the trials reported on adverse effects.

 Other outcomes
Pelvic floor muscle function
Cruz 2014 found no difference between the groups in maximal
vaginal squeeze pressure in the third trimester (Analysis 2.17).
Comparison 3: antenatal pelvic floor muscle training
for mixed prevention and treatment of incontinence
Eleven trials reported antenatal PFMT for mixed prevention and
treatment of incontinence (Assis 2015; Bø 2011; Dokmeci 2008;
Fritel 2015; Frumenzio 2012; Hughes 2001; Ko 2011; Miquelutti
2013; Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998; Stafne 2012). The control
group consisted of usual care in seven trials (Bø 2011; Fritel 2015;
Hughes 2001; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998;
Stafne 2012). There was no PFMT in two trials (Assis 2015; Ko
2011). Two did not specify the control group (Dokmeci 2008;
Frumenzio 2012).
Nine trials were in women who were delivering their first baby
(Assis 2015; Bø 2011; Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015; Hughes 2001;
Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Sampselle 1998).
One recruited both primiparous and multiparous women (Stafne
2012). Parity was not stated in Frumenzio 2012, which was an
abstract.
Primary outcome
Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence
• Women randomised to PFMT had about 26% less risk of
urinary incontinence in late pregnancy (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61
to 0.90; 9 trials, 3164 women, random-effects, I² = 82%, T² =
0.06; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 3.1).
There was statistically significant heterogeneity in both subgroups
(PFMT versus no exercise and PFMT versus usual care) in this
comparison (Analysis 3.1). The point estimates favoured PFMT
in all but two trials (Bø 2011; Fritel 2015). In the seven tri-
als where the point estimates favoured PFMT, there was con-
siderable variation with RR ranging from 0.07 to 0.93 (Assis
2015; Hughes 2001; Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003;
Sampselle 1998; Stafne 2012). The data that appeared notably dif-
ferent, being markedly in favour of PFMT, were those from Assis
2015 for reasons unknown, although this was one of two trials in
which controls were asked not to do PFMT. In the two trials where
the point estimates did not favour PFMT, there were plausible ex-
planations for no differences between the two groups. Participants
in Bø 2011 were encouraged to attend at least two out of three
possible exercise classes every week. These exercise classes were led
by general fitness instructors who were taught by a physiotherapist
how to deliver PFMT to women. It may be that the women in
this trial considered the classes solely as general fitness and did not
concentrate on the PFMT component. In Fritel 2015, the authors
reported that at the end of pregnancy there was no difference in
the frequency and duration of PFMT between groups, suggesting
no difference in exercise adherence between the PFMT and usual
care groups.
• There was a difference in the prevalence of urinary
incontinence between antenatal PFMT and control groups in
the early postnatal (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.95; 5 trials, 760
women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%, T² = 0.00) (Analysis 3.2) and mid-
postnatal periods (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 5 trials, 1921
women, random-effects, I² = 65%, T² = 0.06; very low-quality
evidence) (Analysis 3.3), but not in the late postnatal period (RR
0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 2 trials, 244 women, fixed-effect, I²
= 0%; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 3.4).
In the mid-postnatal period, while all the point estimates favoured
PFMT, these varied considerably between the trials (RRs of 0.42
to 0.97). In the one trial with long-term data (six years), Mørkved
2003, there was no difference between groups (RR 1.38, 95% CI
0.77 to 2.45; 1 trial, 188 women) (Analysis 3.6). Women in the
control group were offered a description of the PFMT programme
after the post-treatment comparison and this and other events
(such as subsequent births) may have contributed to a lack of
difference.
Two trials collected data on faecal incontinence in late pregnancy
(Bø 2011; Stafne 2012). Bø 2011 also reported on faecal incon-
tinence in the early postnatal period. There were no differences
between PFMT and usual care groups at either time-point (late
pregnancy: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.25; 2 trials, 867 women,
fixed-effect; moderate-quality evidence; early postnatal: RR 0.36,
95% CI 0.04 to 3.37; 1 trial, 90 women) (Analysis 3.7; Analysis
3.8).
Incontinence-specific quality of life
Four trials used a validated incontinence-specific quality of life
measure (Fritel 2015, ICIQ-SF and Contilife (higher score better);
Dokmeci 2008; Ko 2011, IIQ-7; Hughes 2001, BFLUTS ques-
tionnaire). Fritel 2015 (ICIQ-SF) found no difference in inconti-
nence-specific quality of life between PFMT and usual care groups
at any of three time points (late pregnancy, early and late (late:
MD -0.20, 95% CI -1 to 0.81; 190 women, low-quality evidence)
postnatal periods) (Analysis 3.13; Analysis 3.14; Analysis 3.15).
However, all point estimates were in favour of the PFMT group.
The two trials that reported IIQ-7 scores had contrasting find-
ings. Ko 2011 found better quality of life in the PFMT group at
each of three time points (late pregnancy, early and mid-postnatal)
compared to no PFMT, whereas Dokmeci 2008 stated there were
no “statistically significant” differences in late pregnancy or early
postpartum (no data provided) between PFMT and unspecified

 controls (Analysis 3.18). The overall score in the trial by Hughes
2001 was not reported.
Secondary outcomes
Severity of incontinence
Two trials reported some data on symptom severity, such as fre-
quency or amount of urine leakage. None of the data suggested
that PFMT was superior to control, or vice versa, at the primary
endpoint of either three months’ postpartum (Hughes 2001) or
12 months’ postpartum (Sampselle 1998).
Number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes
None of the trials reported number of urinary or faecal inconti-
nence episodes.
Loss of urine under stress test
The single trial reporting pad test data (24 hour) found no differ-
ence between PFMT and usual care groups (Analysis 3.17) (Fritel
2015).
Other quality of life and health status measures
Other quality of life and health status measures included:
• Urogenital Distress Index-Short Form (UDI-6) (Dokmeci
2008; Ko 2011);
• Female Pelvic Floor questionnaire (bladder, bowel, prolapse
and sex scores; Fritel 2015);
• Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual
Questionnaire (PISQ; higher score better) (Dokmeci 2008);
• State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Miquelutti 2013);
• Psychological General Wellbeing Index (Stafne 2012);
• Euro-QoL-5D (Fritel 2015; higher score better).
There were no differences between groups for these other measures
of well-being (Analysis 3.18).
Three trials measured some aspect of sexual function in pregnancy,
immediately postpartum and up to six years post-index delivery (
Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015; Mørkved2003). Overall, there wasno
difference insexual functionorthe proportionof women whowere
sexually active in late pregnancy and up to 12 months’ postpartum
(Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015). At six years, Mørkved 2003 found
that PFMT women were twice as likely to report sexual satisfaction
compared to controls (Analysis 3.18).
Health economics
None of the trials reported health economic data.
Adverse effects
Two trials reported no adverse effects (Fritel 2015; Miquelutti
2013).
Other outcomes
Pelvic floor muscle function
PFM function was measured using perineometry, electromyogra-
phy and digital palpation (Assis 2015; Dokmeci 2008; Fritel 2015;
Mørkved 2003). In the three trials that reported data, point es-
timates favoured PFMT women over controls (Assis 2015; Fritel
2015; Mørkved 2003). There were differences in favour of PFMT
in both trials that measured vaginal squeeze pressures (Analysis
3.19) (Assis 2015; Mørkved 2003).
Delivery outcome
Six trials reported the number of caesarean sections, with no differ-
ence between groups (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.14; 6 trials, 1899
women, fixed-effect, I² = 25%, T² = 0.00) between PFMT and
control groups (Analysis 3.20) (Bø 2011; Fritel 2015; Ko 2011;
Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Stafne 2012). Mørkved 2003
found no difference in the type of delivery, although women in the
supervised antenatal PFMT group had a shorter second stage of
labour. However, it is worth noting that fetal head circumference
was also smaller in the PFMT group. Ko 2011 also reported rates
of episiotomy among women and there was no difference between
the groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39).
Participant satisfaction and further treatment
Fritel 2015 reported no difference between the groups in the pro-
portion of women who wanted further supervised training at 12
months’ postpartum, or in the number of medical visits since de-
livery between the PFMT and usual care groups (Analysis 3.22).
Comparison 4: postnatal pelvic floor muscle training
for treatment of incontinence
Five trials reported postnatal PFMT for treatment of inconti-
nence and provided supervised PFMT beginning at three or
more months’ postpartum as treatment for women with per-
sistent urinary incontinence symptoms after delivery (Ahlund
2013; Dumoulin 2004; Glazener 2001; Kim 2012; Wilson 1998).
The control group received usual care or were asked not to do
PFMT (Ahlund 2013; Dumoulin 2004; Glazener 2001; Kim
2012; Wilson 1998).

Pelvic floor muscle training for prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Primary outcome
Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence
• Women randomised to PFMT were about 22% less likely
to have urinary incontinence after treatment compared to
controls more than six and up to 12 months postdelivery (RR
0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.87; 3 trials, 696 women, fixed-effect).
However, there was statistical heterogeneity in this comparison
(I² = 90%) and when the more conservative random-effects
model was used there was no difference (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29
to 1.07; 696 women, I² = 90%, T² = 0.30; very low-quality
evidence) (Analysis 4.3).
Women in all three studies were recruited at three months or more
postpartum. In the case of Dumoulin 2004, women were recruited
after completing an incontinence questionnaire at their annual
gynaecological visit, so it seems likely many were much more than
three months’ postpartum at trial entry. Therefore, after a further
two months’ intervention, it seemed likely the postintervention
outcome was between six and 12 months’ postdelivery for most.
For this reason, a decision was made to present the data from the
trial in the late postnatal category (greater than six to 12 months)
along with that from Glazener 2001 and Wilson 1998, who both
measured outcome 12 months postdelivery.
In addition to possible differences in timing of outcome measure-
ment, there were other obvious dissimilarities between the three
studies. In Dumoulin 2004, women randomised to the control
group were specifically asked not to do any PFMT, while women
in the control group in Glazener 2001 and Wilson 1998 received
usual postnatal care and some did PFMT. Glazener 2001 reported
a mean of 20 PFM contractions every day in the PFMT group
versus five PFM contractions every day in the control group. A
total of 86 (PFMT) versus 35 (control) were performed in the
trial by Wilson 1998. The second difference was that Dumoulin
2004 employed a strengthening PFMT regimen which incorpo-
rated electrical stimulation and biofeedback, while participants
also had weekly contact with a physiotherapist for eight weeks. In
contrast, Glazener 2001 and Wilson 1998 did not clearly aim their
PFMT regimens at either strength or endurance and in both stud-
ies the intervention group had three or four contacts with health
professionals over a six-month period.
Glazener 2001 reported urinary incontinence prevalence at six
years (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05; 1 trial, 516 women) and 12
years after the index delivery (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 1
trial, 471 women), with no difference between PFMT and control
group at either time-point (Analysis 4.5; Analysis 4.6).
Two trials reported data on the prevalence of faecal incontinence
one year after delivery (Glazener 2001; Wilson 1998). There was
statistically significant heterogeneity, therefore a random-effects
model was used to give a more conservative estimate of effect (RR
0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94, random-effects, I² = 74%, T² = 0.42;
2 trials, 620 women; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 4.9).
Glazener 2001 reported no difference in the prevalence of faecal
incontinence at six years (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.50; 509
women) and 12 years (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.22; 1 trial,
468 women) post-index delivery (Analysis 4.11; Analysis 4.12). At
both these time points, Glazener 2001 reported that about 50%
of women in both the intervention and control groups were doing
“any” PFMT. When questioned about performing daily PFMT,
it was interesting to note that only 6% of the PFMT group were
exercising daily, compared to 12% of the control group at six years’
follow-up. After 12 years, 7% of the intervention group and 8%
of the control group were performing daily PFMT (Table 1).
Incontinence-specific quality of life
Two trials used incontinence-specific quality of life measures (
Dumoulin 2004: IIQ and UDI; Kim 2012: BFLUTS). Kim 2012
found no difference between PFMT and usual care groups post-
treatment (MD -1.66, 95% CI -3.51 to 0.19; 18 women) (Analysis
4.13). Dumoulin 2004 reported an improvement in IIQ and UDI
score in women who were doing PFMT compared with women
who were randomised to the control (no PFMT) group (Analysis
4.15).
Secondary outcomes
Severity of incontinence
All five treatment trials reported some data on incontinence sever-
ity, for instance frequency or amount of urine leakage. None of
the measures, or the methods of reporting these, were common to
the five trials. The data suggest that women randomised to PFMT
with symptoms of urinary incontinence might have had less severe
symptoms than women in the control groups but this was not a
consistent or clear-cut finding (Analysis 4.14).
Number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes
None of the trials reported number of urinary or faecal inconti-
nence episodes.
Loss of urine under stress test
None of the trials reported loss of urine under stress test.
Other quality of life and health status measures
Glazener 2001 used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to
measure quality of life and found reduced anxiety in the PFMT
group (Analysis 4.15).

 Health economics
None of the trials reported health economic data.
Adverse effects
Dumoulin 2004 stated that none of the women in the PFMT
group reported any adverse events (with PFMT or electrical stim-
ulation).
Other outcomes
Pelvic floor muscle function
One trial measured PFM function using a dynamometer and three
trials reported vaginal squeeze pressure (Ahlund 2013; Dumoulin
2004; Kim 2012; Wilson 1998). Dynamometer findings favoured
the PFMT group, as did the vaginal squeeze pressure readings in
two trials (Analysis 4.16) (Ahlund 2013; Dumoulin 2004; Kim
2012).
Any other outcome not prespecified but of interest
Wilson 1998 noted that the mean time to teach PFMT to the
intervention group was 32 minutes (95% CI 30 to 34) but no
further economic analysis was reported (Table 1).
Comparison 5: postnatal pelvic floor muscle training
for mixed prevention and treatment of incontinence
Ten trials reported postnatal PFMT for mixed prevention and
treatment of incontinence (Chiarelli 2002; Ewings 2005; Frost
2014; Hilde 2013; Kou 2013; Liu 2011; Meyer2001; Peirce 2013;
Sleep 1987; Wen 2010). These randomised women to postnatal
PFMT versus usual care with the exception of one, in which the
controls were asked to do no exercise (Meyer 2001). The trials re-
cruited previously nulliparous women during their first pregnancy
(Meyer 2001), women having their first baby (Hilde 2013; Liu
2011; Peirce 2013), or postnatal women of mixed parity (Chiarelli
2002; Ewings 2005; Sleep 1987). Three trials did not report this
information (Frost 2014; Kou 2013; Wen 2010).
Primary outcome
Self-reported urinary or faecal incontinence
The only information from the early postnatal period was from
Frost 2014, a conference abstract. This trial did not contribute
any data to the review but the authors stated that there were no
significant differences in “urinary symptoms” at six to eight weeks’
postpartum between the PFMT and control (usual care) groups.
There was no difference in the prevalence of urinary incontinence
in women randomised to postnatal PFMT or control group in the:
• mid-postnatal period, up to six months (RR 0.95, 95% CI
0.75 to 1.19, random-effects, I² = 65%, T² = 0.04; 5 trials, 2800
women) (Analysis 5.2) or
• late postnatal period, more than six to 12 months (RR
0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09, fixed-effect, I² = 50%, T² = 0.00; 3
trials, 826 women; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 5.3).
There was statistically significant heterogeneity in both compar-
isons. There was no detail of the PFMT programmes in three of
the five trials contributing data to the mid-postnatal comparison
(Ewings 2005; Meyer 2001; Sleep 1987). In addition, there were
other notable dissimilarities, including the risk profile of the re-
cruited population (e.g. Chiarelli 2002) and the degree of con-
trast between PFMT and control groups in exercise supervision
and prescription (e.g. Sleep 1987, low contrast; Kou 2013, high
contrast). In the two trials with findings in favour of PFMT, the
control groups were offered usual care, while the PFMT interven-
tions were intensively supervised or enhanced with application of
health behaviour theory (Chiarelli 2002; Kou 2013). In addition,
Chiarelli 2002 recruited women who were at potentially increased
risk of postnatal incontinence, such as those who had a large baby
or a forceps delivery.
There was considerably less difference in PFMT and control
groups in the other three trials for various reasons and none found
a difference between the groups. All control groups received usual
postnatal care that may have or did include information about
PFMT. Ewings 2005 reported that 114/117 women randomised
to PFMT received one-to-one instruction on PFMT but only 21
attended one group class, with five attending both available classes.
There was no difference between groups. Hilde 2013 randomised
women to PFMT delivered in a weekly exercise class plus home
exercise, versus a home exercise control condition. Both groups
had a correct PFM contraction confirmed prior to training. Sleep
1987 randomised women within 24 hours of delivery to an indi-
vidual daily session with a midwife co-ordinator while in hospital
and home exercise, versus usual care that included postnatal classes
taken by an obstetric physiotherapist. At three months’ postpar-
tum, the proportion of women doing PFMT was reasonably sim-
ilar (58% with PFMT and 42% with control).
Chiarelli 2002 and Kou 2013 also contributed data to the late
postpartum comparison with the addition of that from Meyer
2001. Women in the study by Meyer 2001 were randomised to
either eight months of supervised PFM rehabilitation with a phys-
iotherapist or no PFMT. Like Kou 2013, there was a high degree
of contrast between the PFMT and control groups. However, un-
like Kou 2013, Meyer 2001 found no difference between groups
in the prevalence of urinary incontinence. Neither of these trials
reported details of their randomisation procedures.
Two trials reported the prevalence of postnatal faecal incontinence
28

 (Meyer 2001; Sleep 1987). Neither demonstrated a difference be-
tween PFMT and control groups (at more than six to 12 months:
RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.21; 1 trial, 107 women; very low-
quality evidence) (Analysis 5.6; Analysis 5.7; Analysis 5.8).
Incontinence-specific quality of life
One of the 10 trials reported incontinence-specific quality of life
data, with no differences between PFMT and controls for faecal
incontinence (Analysis 5.10; Analysis 5.13; Peirce 2013).
Secondary outcomes
Severity of incontinence
Four trials reported some data on symptom severity (Hilde 2013;
Liu 2011; Sleep 1987; Wen 2010).
At three months’ postpartum, Sleep 1987 found no difference
between the groups in frequency of leakage or the number of
women using absorbent pads (often or always), whereas Liu 2011
reported less severe urinary incontinence (unspecified measure) in
the PFMT group (Analysis 5.11).
Number of urinary or faecal incontinence episodes
None of the trials reported number of urinary or faecal inconti-
nence episodes.
Loss of urine under stress test
At six months’ postpartum, Hilde 2013 found no difference be-
tween the groups for amount of leakage on pad test and the re-
sults for unspecified urinary incontinence severity were inconsis-
tent (Liu 2011; Wen 2010). Pooled data from two studies found
no difference in the risk of positive pad test between PFMT com-
pared to usual care (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.57; 2 trials, 85
women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%) (Analysis 5.12) (Hilde 2013; Wen
2010). At 12 months, unspecified urinary incontinence severity
was less in the PFMT group compared to usual care and fewer
women in the PFMT groups had a positive pad test (Wen 2010).
Other quality of life and health status measures
Two trials measured some aspect of sexual function (Meyer 2001;
Sleep 1987). Meyer 2001 noted fewer women in the PFMT group
reported a diminished vaginal sexual response at 10 months’ post-
partum, while Sleep 1987 found no difference between groups in
the proportion of women who had attempted or had pain with
sexual intercourse at three months’ postpartum (Analysis 5.13).
Health economics
None of the trials reported health economic data.
Adverse effects
Two trials collected data on adverse events, with none reported in
either group or in those using biofeedback as an adjunct to PFMT
(Hilde 2013; Peirce 2013).
Other outcomes
Pelvic floor muscle function
Two studies measured PFM function using the Oxford scale (Liu
2011; Wen 2010). The outcomes at three, six and 12 months’
postpartum were in favour of the PFMT group compared to usual
care. Three trials assessed vaginal squeeze pressure at six, 10 and 12
months’ postpartum and found no difference between the groups
(Hilde 2013; Kou 2013; Meyer 2001). Two trials measured anal
pressure, in cm of water (Meyer 2001) or mmHg (Peirce 2013),
and neither found a difference between PFMT and control groups
(Analysis 5.14).
Any other outcome not prespecified but of interest
One trial measured pelvic organ prolapse symptoms at six months’
postpartum and found no difference between the groups (Analysis
5.15) (Hilde 2013).

High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low quality: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1Downgraded three levels due to serious risk of selection bias (one trial with heavy weighting in the pooled estimate at high
risk), inconsistency and indirectness, and very serious imprecision (fewer than 300 events, wide confidence interval, two
trials without any details about PFMT interventions).
2Downgraded three levels due to serious risk of selection bias, indirectness and imprecision (singe trial, fewer than 300
events, wide confidence interval, no details about PFMT interventions).
3Downgraded three levels due to very serious risk of selection bias, inconsistency and imprecision (fewer than 300 events,
wide confidence interval) and serious indirectness (no details about the PFMT intervention in one trial with about half the
weighting in the pooled estimate).
4Downgraded two levels due to serious indirectness and imprecision (single trial, fewer than 300 participants, wide confidence
interval).
The outcome measures relate to the presence of incontinence symptoms rather than absence. As this comparison addresses
the effect of PFMT for treatment of existing continence symptoms, the data are ‘‘negative,’’ that is continuing incontinence
rather than cure. Symptoms of urinary and faecal incontinence were measured based on self-report.

Pelvic floor muscle training for prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
This review considers whether PFMT (as defined by the trialists)
is better than usual antenatal or postnatal care for the prevention
and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in childbear-
ing women. Another Cochrane Review addressed a similar ques-
tion (whether PFMT was better than no treatment, placebo or
inactive control treatments) in women with urinary incontinence
(Dumoulin 2014). This review specifically excluded trials that re-
cruited antenatal or postnatal women.
Summary of main results
Is pelvic floor muscle training better than usual
antenatal or postnatal care for the prevention and
treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence?
There are three possible ways of delivering PFMT interventions to
women during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The first
way is to provide PFMT for women who have no symptoms when
PFMT begins (i.e. prevention). The second is to prescribe PFMT
for women who have already developed symptoms of incontinence
(i.e. treatment). The third is to provide PFMT for all women
regardless of whether they have urinary incontinence symptoms
or not when PFMT begins (i.e. mixed prevention and treatment
approach). Comparisons were drawn within the following three
populations of women.
• Women who were continent when randomised to
intervention groups, that is, prevention studies.
• Women who were incontinent at randomisation, that is,
treatment studies.
• Trials including a mixed population, that is, some women
were continent and some women were incontinent at
randomisation.
Primary or secondary prevention of incontinence
Summary data from six trials suggested that PFMT during preg-
nancy decreased urinary incontinence in late pregnancy compared
to usual care (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.72; 624 women; low-
quality evidence). At between three months and up to six months
following delivery (mid-postpartum), summary data from five tri-
als suggested that PFMT decreased the prevalence of urinary in-
continence compared to usual care (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to
0.95; 673 women; moderate-quality evidence). With only sub-
group data from one small trial of 72 women, there were too
few data from six months to one year after delivery (late postpar-
tum) to comment meaningfully (Sampselle 1998). A single trial of
152 women suggested PFMT probably improved incontinence-
specific quality of life in late pregnancy compared to usual care
(ICIQ-SF: MD -2.42 , 95% CI -3.32 to -1.52 ; moderate-quality
evidence) (Pelaez 2014). None of the trials reported data on faecal
incontinence in late pregnancy, or in the mid- and late postpartum
periods (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Two trials conducted a long-term follow-up of participants at eight
andsixyearswith nodifference betweenPFMTandcontrol groups
(Analysis 1.6) (Mørkved 2003; Reilly 2002).
Treatment of incontinence
We expressed uncertainty about the effects of PFMT for treatment
of urinary incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women below.
The uncertainty arose from the lack of precision in the pooled
estimate of effect; the CIs for the summary statistic were generally
wide, and included a null effect.
Antenatal women
Based on summary data from three trials, we are uncertain whether
PFMT decreased existing urinary incontinence in late pregnancy
compared to usual care (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.13; 345
women; very low-quality evidence). We are equally uncertain
whether PFMT to treat antenatal urinary incontinence reduced
urinary incontinence in the mid- (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24;
1 trial, 187 women; very low-quality evidence) or late (RR 0.50,
95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; 2 trials, 869 women; very low-quality ev-
idence) postnatal periods. Data from a single trial of 41 women
suggested that PFMT may have improved incontinence-specific
quality of life in late pregnancy compared to usual care (ICIQ-SF:
MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.13 to -0.87; low-quality evidence) (Cruz
2014). None of the trials reported data on faecal incontinence in
late pregnancy, or in the mid- and late postpartum periods in this
comparison (Summary of findings 2). Evidence in this compari-
son was particularly weak, with all trials limited by incomplete re-
porting of intervention and control conditions and trial methods.
Two trials in this comparison were reported only as conference
abstracts.
Postnatal women
Based on summary data from three trials, we were uncertain
whether PFMT to treat postnatal urinary incontinence reduced
urinary incontinence in the late postnatal period (RR 0.55, 95%
CI0.29to1.07; 696women; verylow-qualityevidence).We noted
that two of the three trials that carried the greatest weighting in the
pooled estimate compared PFMT (with limited supervision by a
healthcare professional) with usual care and some women in the
control groups were doing PFMT (Glazener 2001; Wilson 1998).
There was no difference between groups in Wilson 1998 and close
to no difference in Glazener 2001. In the third trial, Dumoulin
2004 compared a shorter and more intensively supervised PFMT
intervention with no treatment and found a reduction in the risk
of urinary incontinence in favour of PFMT. Based on the data
from a single very small trial, we were uncertain whether urinary
incontinence-specific quality of life after treatment was improved
39

 with PFMT (BFLUTS: MD -1.66 , 95% CI -3.51 to 0.19; 18
women; very low-quality evidence) (Kim 2012). Likewise, based
on summary data from two trials, we are uncertain whether PFMT
reduces faecal incontinence in the late postnatal period compared
to usual care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 620 women; very
low-quality evidence) (Glazener 2001; Wilson 1998) (Summary
of findings 4).
Glazener 2001 carried out long-term follow-up of women at six
and 12 years after the initial study. There was no difference in
the prevalence of urinary incontinence between the PFMT and
control groups at either of these time points suggesting that the
possible benefits of PFMT were not upheld in the long term.
Glazener and colleagues also measured faecal incontinence atsix
and 12 years after delivery. These results did not show a difference
but the CIs were wide, highlighting the need for more evidence in
this area.
Trials with a mixed prevention and treatment approach
Antenatal women
Summary data from nine trials suggested that antenatal PFMT,
delivered to a population of women with or without existing uri-
nary incontinence symptoms, may have decreased the prevalence
of urinary incontinence in late pregnancy (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61
to 0.90; 3164 women; low-quality evidence). The two trials that
compared PFMT to no training seemed to show a greater effect
than the other seven trials that compared PFMT and usual care
(Assis 2015; Ko 2011). Summary data from the mid-postnatal pe-
riod also favoured PFMT over control, although there was uncer-
tainty about this effect (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 5 trials,
1921 women; very low-quality evidence). Two trials reported data
on urinary incontinence in the late postpartum period and there
may have been no difference in urinary incontinence prevalence
between PFMT and usual care, although there was uncertainty
about this effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 244 women;
low-quality evidence).
Similarly, antenatal PFMT may have led to little or no difference in
the prevalence of faecal incontinence in late pregnancy (RR 0.61,
95% CI 0.30 to 1.25; moderate-quality evidence). There were no
data for the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the mid- or late
postnatal periods in this comparison. A single trial (ICIQ-SF: MD
-0.20, 95% CI -1.21 to 0.80; 190 women; low-quality evidence)
found that antenatal PFMT may have led to little or no difference
in incontinence-specific quality of life in the late postnatal period
compared to usual care (Fritel 2015). However, it is important
to note that in Fritel 2015, women in both groups reported a
similar frequency and duration of PFMT (including the number
of contractions) at the end of pregnancy. This suggested that the
lack of difference between groups was because the control group
was routinely doing adequate PFMT, which was encouraging in
terms of delivering PFMT to the general population (Summary
of findings 3).
Postnatal women
Based on summary data from three trials, we were uncertain
whether postnatal PFMT, delivered to a population of women
with or without existing urinary incontinence symptoms, reduced
urinary incontinence in the late postnatal period (RR 0.88, 95%
CI 0.71 to 1.09; 826 women; very low-quality evidence). We were
equally uncertain whether PFMT reduced faecal incontinence in
the late postnatal period compared to no PFMT (RR 0.73, 95%
CI 0.13 to 4.21; 1 trial, 107 women; very low-quality evidence)
(Meyer 2001). There were no incontinence-specific quality of life
data in this comparison (Summary of findings 5).
Delivery outcomes
Few adverse events were reported with PFMT. However, it was
possible that PFMT during pregnancy might influence labour and
delivery outcomes. This did not seem to be the case based on data
from nine antenatal PFMT trials included in this review.
Three of the antenatal PFMT trials for the prevention of inconti-
nence reported on delivery outcome (Barakat 2011; Gaier 2010;
Gorbea 2004). The risk of caesarean section was not different (RR
1.28, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.85; 373 women) (Analysis 1.19). Gaier
2010 reported data on rates of episiotomy, with the control group
receiving more episiotomies than the PFMT group, while Barakat
2011 reported rates of perineal trauma with no apparent differ-
ence in grades of perineal tear between the groups (Analysis 1.20).
Six of the antenatal PFMT trials for mixed prevention and treat-
ment of incontinence reported on delivery outcome (Bø 2011;
Fritel 2015; Ko 2011; Miquelutti 2013; Mørkved 2003; Stafne
2012). The risk of caesarean section was not different (RR 0.95,
95% CI 0.79 to 1.14; 1899 women) (Analysis 3.20). None of the
three trials that reported data for the risk of assisted vaginal de-
liveries found a difference between the PFMT and control groups
(Analysis 3.21) (Fritel 2015; Mørkved 2003; Stafne 2012). Two
trials reported data on rates of episiotomy, with the control group
receiving more episiotomies than the PFMT group (Analysis 3.21)
(Ko 2011; Mørkved 2003). Du 2015 published a non-Cochrane
systematicreviewof antenatal PFMTanddeliveryoutcomeswhere
their findings appeared consistent with the above. Their review
included more studies, as it contained trials that did not collect
urinary incontinence or faecal incontinence data.
There were no data on labour or delivery outcomes reported in
any of the trials of antenatal PFMT for treatment of incontinence.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The self-report measures of urinary and faecal incontinence were
considered the most important outcomes in this review. However,
40
Pelvic floor muscle training for prevention and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence in antenatal and postnatal women (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 there was variability in the way urinary and faecal incontinence
were defined, how the questions were asked and how the data were
presented. There were few incontinence-specific quality of life data
and little agreement about a standard measure. Further, some trials
only partially reported a score (e.g. one domain of several included
in the total score) or a statement about difference or lack of it,
sometimes with a P value, as these data were collected but not
reported or only partially reported this is a form of reporting bias.
Unfortunately, faecal incontinence data were rarely collected in
the prevention or mixed prevention and treatment trials; only six
studies presented data. Being a less common event than urinary
incontinence, larger trials are needed to accurately document the
effect of PFMT on this outcome and more trials must collect these
data to enable a more precise effect estimate based on pooled data.
The usefulness of evidence was somewhat reduced by the short
durations of follow-up after intervention. This was particularly
problematic in the antenatal PFMT trials, where the outcome was
either measured at the end of pregnancy or in the three months
postbirth. At three months’ postpartum, there may not have been
full resolutionof manyof the physiological changesassociated with
pregnancy and childbirth. A minimum follow-up of six months
postnatally is probably more useful to be sure how many cases of
urinary or faecal incontinence are persistent. For treatment studies,
while a postintervention measure is useful, data on the duration of
effect (e.g. one year or longer) are needed. With regard to longer-
term follow-up, only three studies provided data after five years (
Glazener2001; Mørkved2003; Reilly2002). Longer-termdataare
difficult to interpret, as control groups may be offered a structured
PFMT after the postintervention outcome is measured, women
may have more children and so on. However, in the absence of
longer-term data about urinary and faecal incontinence and other
variables (parity, bodyweight, etc.), there is an insufficient evidence
base to begin to analyse and interpret.
Pregnancy and birth appear to be the most consistent and impor-
tant factors associated with the development of urinary and faecal
incontinence in women. Therefore, all women who have a child,
or children, might be considered at risk of later incontinence. In
addition, some women (such as those who have a connective tissue
disorder, high BMI or an assisted delivery) might be at even greater
risk (Durnea 2017; Svare 2014). The bulk of trials reviewed were
undertaken in samples of antenatal women, principally those in
their first pregnancy and most data were for urinary incontinence.
The findings suggested that continent antenatal women benefited
more from “structured” PFMT programmes (in terms of content
and delivery) than women in usual care groups that may have in-
corporated some (or ad hoc) PFMT advice or teaching.
Trials of antenatal PFMT for mixed prevention and treatment also
mostly recruited women having their first baby and showed a sim-
ilar pattern of benefit of structured PFMT versus control condi-
tions. However, the pooled data suggested less reduction in risk of
urinary incontinence, upper CIs closer to one (i.e. no reduction
in risk of urinary incontinence) and overall there was also more
uncertainty about the effect.
Efforts to determine what value women, healthcare professionals
and their professional organisations, provider and funding bodies
give to this body of evidence about urinary incontinence preven-
tion through structured and supervised antenatal PFMT (at least
for first-time mothers) are warranted. If the findings are consid-
ered sufficiently certain and of value, then changes to the current
ad hoc delivery of PFMT advice in pregnancy within ’usual care’
are needed. Alongside this, and to inform any decisions about the
’value’ of antenatal PFMT for prevention of incontinence, inves-
tigations into health economics are needed. In the absence of such
studies, there is no evidence about value for money. It is encour-
aging that one ongoing study identified in the search planned to
collect and report economic data (Berghmans 2016).
We summarised data from all the trials. There were a few that
we considered informed us enough about what was done in both
PFMT and control groups that we were more confident in the
estimate of differences in outcome. These were trials where suffi-
cient information was provided about the intervention and control
conditions such that it was possible to reach a judgement about:
• the soundness of the physiology of the PFMT (i.e. whether
the structured PFMT intervention was likely to strengthen
muscle);
• exercise behaviour in both groups (i.e. were both groups
doing similar or quite different amounts of PFMT);
• the degree of contrast between the two groups (e.g. did the
PFMT group attend many exercise classes while the control
group had none (high contrast), or did the PFMT group have
one instruction session and the controls had none (low contrast))
(see Table 1 and Potential biases in the review process
(heterogeneity)).
Four trials contained the necessary amount of information (
Chiarelli 2002; Hilde 2013; Reilly 2002; Stafne 2012). All were
at low risk of selection bias and had moderate to large sample
sizes. Two examined the effect of antenatal PFMT for preven-
tion of urinary and faecal incontinence (Reilly 2002; primiparous
women with bladder neck hypermobility) and mixed prevention
and treatment (Stafne 2012; healthy pregnant women, mixed par-
ity) and two the effect of postnatal PFMT for mixed prevention
and treatment of urinary and faecal incontinence (Chiarelli 2002,
mixed parity, after ventouse or forceps delivery or baby weighing
4000 g or greater; Hilde 2013, primiparous women after vagi-
nal delivery). Looking at the GRADE rated outcomes, data from
these individual trials were consistent with the pooled estimates
of effect. Antenatal training appeared to have clinically important
reductions in urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and between
more than three to six months postnatally (Reilly 2002; Stafne
2012). The effect of postnatal training for mixed prevention and
treatment may not be clinically important at more than three to
six months after delivery for urinary incontinence (Chiarelli 2002;
Hilde 2013). However, it is possible that women at higher risk of
postnatal incontinence benefited more (Chiarelli 2002).

 Quality of the evidence
Overall, the evidence was moderate, low or even very low qual-
ity (see Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary
of findings 2; Summary of findings 3; Summary of findings 4;
Summary of findings 5). The most common reasons for down-
grading the evidence were:
• imprecision, with few overall events contributing to the
pooled analysis and wide CIs around the estimates of effect;
• inconsistency, because many of the meta-analyses
demonstrated statistically significant heterogeneity (Chi² test P <
0.10) or had an I² > 50%;
• indirectness, due to lack of clear reporting of the PFMT
intervention or the control condition or both.
Some comparisons were downgraded for selection bias, arising
from inadequate reporting of random sequence generation and
random allocation. Most comparisons in the ’Summary of find-
ings’ tables were affected by more than one of the above and were
downgraded twice or three times.
Trial quality and reporting
We evaluated methodological quality from the trial reports, which
was limited when the only source of publication was from an
abstract (see Included studies). In addition, abstracts reported few
data.
The adequacy of reporting randomisation remains disappointing
as fewer than half of the included trials reported both random se-
quence generation and allocation concealment and 13/38 studies
described neither. The nature of the intervention means it was not
feasible to blind the treatment provider or participants to group
allocation (performance bias) in any of the included trials. The
difficulty of blinding exercise-based interventions is unavoidable.
Furthermore, it is impossible to blind either of the primary out-
comes in the review because both were self-reported (prevalence
of urinary incontinence or faecal incontinence and incontinence-
specific quality of life). Approximately three-quarters of the trials
(28/38) had a low risk of reporting bias but only just over half
(21/38) were deemed to be low risk in terms of potential sources
of other biases (Figure 2; Figure 3).
Based on the reported adequacy of randomisation, proportion and
management of participant dropouts and withdrawals, and low
risk of selective reporting or other biases, six trials appeared to be
at low risk of bias (Chiarelli 2002; Dumoulin 2004; Hilde 2013;
Mørkved 2003; Peirce 2013; Sangsawang 2016). However, this
assessment did not take into account the quality of descriptions of
the PFMT interventions or control conditions. If this was taken
into account, the trial by Sangsawang 2016 would be downgraded
inquality, asthe interventionwasof shortdurationandinsufficient
information was provided to determine the likely physiological
effect of the PFMT. Sensitivity analysis on the basis of trial quality
was not considered appropriate in view of the small number of
trials contributing to each comparison.
Potential biases in the review process
We combined data from a diverse set of studies. This may in-
evitably impact on the applicability of our findings to practice.
We summarise below the issues related to the heterogeneity of the
studies we used.
Sources of heterogeneity
There were three notable sources of clinical heterogeneity. These
were the variation in baseline characteristics (e.g. parity, type of
delivery, type and duration of incontinence, if women were symp-
tomatic when recruited), the PFMT programmes and the control
care. To investigate the effects of baseline characteristics on treat-
ment outcome would require an individual participant data meta-
analysis, which was beyond the scope of this review.
Variability of pelvic floor muscle training regimens
The content of PFMT programmes was often poorly described.
Downgrading the evidence on the basis of inconsistency and in-
directness was therefore inevitable in view of lack of information
about PFMT and control conditions, PFMT content, and super-
vision of exercise programmes (see ’Summary of findings’ tables).
More than half the trials provided insufficient information to be
sure of the likelyphysiological effectof the exercise andonlyhalfre-
ported confirmation of a correct PFM contraction prior to training
(see PFMT regimens and control interventions, Included studies
and Table 1). Consequently, it was difficult to evaluate the poten-
tial physiological efficacy of the exercise programmes. Including
trials with a suboptimal exercise regimen alongside those with a
sufficient regimen could adversely influence the pooled estimate
of PFMT effect.
Alongside the physiological efficacy of the exercise, support for the
behavioural aspects of exercise is also required. Behavioural sup-
port is commonly provided through supervision of exercise, and
the extent of this varied markedly between trials. The least super-
vision was either one group or individual session to introduce the
PFMT and the most was a mean of 85 classes between the sixth to
39th week of pregnancy (Table 1). Attendance was sometimes used
as a surrogate for measuring adherence. It may be a good measure
of adherence if the number of required attendances was sufficient
to strengthen the PFM (Haskell 2007). However, if clinic atten-
dance was less than twice per week, then it was likely that addi-
tional training needed to be completed at home to achieve a suffi-
cient exercise regimen. Measurement of home exercise adherence
then becomes a critical component of assessing the likely efficacy
of the training. Half of the included trials reported some type of
adherence data for women in the intervention or control groups
but only nine studies asked women in both PFMT and control
groups about their exercise behaviour (see Included studies). Ad-
herence data should be collected in both study groups, although it
is acknowledged that measuring it may change exercise behaviour.
In turn, this may lead to an overestimate of the likely effect in ’real’

 life and may diminish the difference in effect between structured
PFMT and control conditions.
Assessment of the interaction between quality and the effect of
the intervention has been recommended but there were too few
trials to conduct a formal sensitivity analysis by intervention qual-
ity (Herbert 2005). Rather than excluding or including trials on
the basis of sufficiency of PFMT, or the likelihood that a clear-
cut comparison between PFMT and the control condition had
been made, the preferred approach would be a sensitivity analysis
on the basis of PFMT programme characteristics or amount of
clinical difference between the PFMT and control interventions.
However, more trials would be needed in each of the comparisons
in the review before this was possible. We tried to distil informa-
tion about the physiological and behavioural quality of the PFMT
interventions, alongside the degree of contrast between the PFMT
and control groups (see ’Sample characteristics’ in Included studies
and Summary of main results).
Variability of control conditions
The control conditionswere alsohighlyvariable andusuallypoorly
described, with many including a blanket statement about women
in control groups receiving usual or standard care. However, it
often it was unclear whether usual care encompassed advice about
PFMT (i.e. written or verbal instructions) or a more ad hoc ar-
rangement (see ’Sample characteristics’ in Included studies, and
Table 1).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The overall findings and conclusions in this updated review are
generally the same as the previous version, despite this update con-
taining more trials and substantially more data than the previous
review and integrating the GRADE scores for assessing the qual-
ity of evidence (Boyle 2012). Since the last update of this review
in 2012, one non-Cochrane systematic review on the effects of
PFMT during pregnancy and postpartum for the prevention and
treatment of urinary incontinence has been published (Mørkved
2014). Although Mørkved 2014 considered the data in slightly
different categories, they reported that PFMT during pregnancy
and after delivery was effective in treating and preventing urinary
incontinence, particularly when women adhered to a strength-
training protocol and were closely supervised. The findings of this
review agreed with those of Mørkved 2014 relating to method-
ological factors such as the heterogeneity of the populations in
the included trials, differences in reported outcome measures, and
considerable variation in the PFMT and control conditions be-
tween trials.

Implications for practice
The findings from this review suggest that targeting continent an-
tenatal women early in their pregnancy and offering a structured
pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) programme may prevent the
onset of urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and postpartum.
Populationapproaches, thatis, recruitingantenatal womenregard-
less of their continence status, might also reduce the prevalence of
urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and postpartum but the
effect may be less pronounced. However, the reasons for this are
unclear. The findings about the effects of PFMT as a treatment
for antenatal urinary incontinence are uncertain.
Similarly, it is uncertain whether a population-based approach for
delivery of postnatal PFMT (i.e. recruitment of women regardless
of continence status immediately following delivery) is effective.
It is possible that a ’high-risk’ approach (e.g. women who have
an assisted delivery or deliver a large baby) leads to more clinical
benefit than a population approach.
It is also unclear whether PFMT is an effective treatment for per-
sistent urinary incontinence symptoms (i.e. women recruited at
three months’ postdelivery). This uncertainty around the efficacy
of PFMT as a treatment for urinary incontinence in the immedi-
ate postnatal period is perhaps surprising given the summary find-
ings of Dumoulin 2014, which suggested PFMT is an effective
treatment for established urinary incontinence symptoms in non-
postnatal women.
We can suggest some plausible reasons for the differences in find-
ings of the effectiveness of PFMT as a treatment for persistent post-
natal urinary incontinence, compared to the findings of Dumoulin
2014, in non-postnatal women. First, there are differences in the
participants in the included trials. In this review, trials included
postnatal women who may have altered physiological capabilities
(muscle, nerve and connective tissue) consequent on the changes
of pregnancy and delivery (Nygaard 2017). Postnatal women may
find it particularly difficult to adopt or sustain exercise behaviour
postdelivery, especially when they are distracted and occupied with
caring for a new baby (Gillard 2010; Mason 2001). In contrast,
Dumoulin 2014 reported outcomes from trials in non-postnatal
women, which may not have the same barriers. Second, there are
differences in the comparator or control groups. In this review, the
comparator group in the two large trials which carried the greatest
weighting in the pooled estimate was usual care (which may have
included PFMT), whereas the control group received no treatment
in the majority of studies included in Dumoulin and colleagues’
review (Analysis 4.3). It is possible that the potential lack of con-
trast between the intervention and control groups in this review
contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the effect of PFMT
as a treatment for postnatal urinary incontinence. Interestingly,
in the one small study, which compared an intensively supervised
strengthening PFMT programme to no treatment, rather than two
larger trials that compared a minimally supervised PFMT pro-
43

Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 gramme with uncertain physiological effect, the benefit of PFMT
was more marked (Analysis 4.3).
There are insufficient data on faecal incontinence to state whether
or not PFMT is effective to prevent or treat this problem in preg-
nant or postpartum women. Furthermore, there are insufficient
data to determine whether or not PFMT is effective to prevent
urinary incontinence more than one year after birth. However, it
is acknowledged that assessing the long-term effects of PFMT is
challenging, as women may go on to have subsequent pregnancies,
be offered a specific PFMT programme if they had taken part in
the control arm of a trial or initiate their own PFMT (Mørkved
2003).
Implications for research
Since the previous version of this review, 17 new studies have been
added, most of which were small- to moderate-sized trials (i.e.
fewer than 500 women per arm). Unfortunately, the variability
in rigour of methods and quality of reporting continued and this
affordsanopportunitytomake some recommendations forfurther
research (Boyle 2012).
First, the lack of faecal incontinence data was notable. It is en-
couraging to see some attention is being directed specifically to-
wards investigations of faecal incontinence in antenatal and post-
natal women (Johannessen 2017; Oakley 2016; Characteristics of
studies awaiting classification). However, these studies are small
and, therefore, unlikely to provide sufficient data for certainty
about the effects of PFMT. Because fewer women may have fae-
cal incontinence, every trial conducted on antenatal and postnatal
incontinence must collect faecal as well as urinary incontinence
data so we can learn more about this problem.
As there is insufficient evidence about the continuing effects of
PFMT, trialistsshould, ataminimum,collectfollow-updataabout
antenatal training at three months’ postpartum and about postna-
tal training at 12 months’ postpartum. Ideally, for both antenatal
and postnatal training, data should also be collected in both the
intervention and control groups beyond one year.
The descriptions of the PFMT and control interventions and
choice of outcome measures require attention. It is important
that both the physiological and behavioural aspects of exercise are
thoroughly described in both the intervention and control groups
(Frawley 2017). In particular, there is a need to know what types
of PFMT advice and behaviour occurs in the usual care group, as
these details are infrequently measured or reported. In addition,
it is recommended that all future trials collect valid measures of
incontinence-specific quality of life for both urinary incontinence
and faecal incontinence (e.g. ICIQ-SF for urinary incontinence
and an agreed measure for faecal incontinence) (Avery 2007). In
antenatal trials, the effect of PFMT on labour and delivery out-
comes is worthy of further investigation. This would help to elu-
cidate whether or not there are any associations between PFMT
parameters, such as the type, frequency, intensity and duration of
pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises and outcomes for mother and
baby.
The evidence to date about the benefit of mixed prevention and
treatment approaches is uncertain in antenatal populations and
notatall clearinpostnatal populations. However, these population
approaches are probably the most common in clinical practice.
It is possible that the effect of PFMT in these mixed approaches
is diluted by some women who will never become incontinent
and also those in whom PFMT is unlikely to be effective, such
as those with denervation. Perhaps the focus in future population
type trials should be to target women who are at heightened risk of
developing urinary or faecal incontinence (such as women with a
high body mass index or women who have had an assisted vaginal
delivery).
The effect of PFMT for treatment of urinary and faecal inconti-
nence, especially in antenatal women, is a high priority for further
investigation. High-quality health economics studies, alongside
any future trials, are also a high priority.
Any further large pragmatic trials will ideally include process eval-
uation and fidelity checking, so some evaluation of treatment can
be provided (Moore 2015).

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Ahlund 2013
Methods
2-arm (parallel groups) RCT.
Participants
98 postpartum primiparous women, 10-16 weeks after delivery.
Inclusion: normal term singleton vaginal delivery, stress UI.
Exclusion: neurological bladder dysfunction or tumours in the genital area
Age, mean (SD), years: PFMT 33 (3.4); control 33 (3.9).
Parity: primiparous.
Delivery: not reported.
BMI, mean (SD): PFMT 23 (3.5); control 23 (3.2).
Incontinence at recruitment: 100% (as outlined in inclusion criteria).
Setting: 4 different private antenatal clinics in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden
Interventions
PFMT (n = 49): supervised home exercise programme (written instructions), daily
exercises, for 6 months. Instructions from study midwife on how to perform correct
PFM contraction, confirmed by vaginal palpation. Participants visited the midwife every
6 weeks (total of 3 times during the study period) for follow-up of progress and to
encourage PFMT
Control (n = 49): usual postnatal care. Instructions from study midwife on how to
perform correct PFM contraction, confirmed by vaginal palpation. Received customary
writtenpostpartuminstructionsexplainingPFM anatomyandrecommendations around
PFMT
Outcomes
Measured at 3 (baseline) and 9 months’ postpartum.
Primary endpoint: 9 months’ postpartum.
UI at 9 months’ postpartum: not reported.
Primary outcome: PFM strength (maximal voluntary contraction) measured using per-
ineometry (mmHg)
Secondary outcomes: PFM endurance (sec), PFM strength using Oxford grading scale,
self-reported UI using ICIQ FLUTS short form questionnaire, general health form with
19 questions related to delivery, motherhood and current health status
Notes
Losses to follow-up at 9 months: PFMT 9/49; control 7/49 (total 16.3%)
Funding: not specifically funded.
Conflicts of interest: none declared

(working with groups of 10-12 participants) with the assistance of an obstetrician, 3 days
per week from the beginning of pregnancy (weeks 6-9) to the end of the 3rd trimester
(weeks 38-39). Thus, an approximate 85 training sessions were originally planned for

amounts of walking) for the last 6 months, within the 1st 24 weeks of pregnancy, and
able to understand verbal and written instructions in the Norwegian language
Exclusion: severe heart disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, history of ≥ 2 mis-
carriages, bleeding after 12 weeks’ gestation, uncontrolled thyroid disease, pre-eclampsia
or other diseases that could affect participation

Parity: 100% primiparous.
Delivery: unclear, appeared to report delivery details for women with incontinence only.
Of those with incontinence: PFMT 2 instrumental deliveries, 1 caesarean; control: 3
instrumental, 2 caesarean
BMI, mean (SD): PFMT 23.8 (3.8); control 23.9 (4.7).

trol 23%; FI: PFMT 0, control 0
Setting: university-conducted primary care study, single centre, Oslo, Norway
Interventions
PFMT (n = 52): as part of an aerobic fitness class (2-3 times per week, 60 min), for
at least 12 weeks. Progressive PFMT programme that was incorporated into 15 min of
strength training which included PFMT. All sessions were led by instructors who were
trained (which included instructions on how to explain a correct PFM contraction) by
an experienced physiotherapist. Women were also encouraged to be physically active for
at least 30 min per day and to increase their daily activity as much as possible. Women
were given a book on general exercise during pregnancy with a specific PFMT pamphlet
developed for pregnant women, explaining the anatomy of the pelvic floor, how to do a
correct PFM contraction, and training prescription of 3 sets of 8-12 close to maximum
PFM contractions per day
Control (n = 53): usual antenatal care.
Outcomes
Measured before the start of the intervention (baseline, 12-24 weeks’ gestation), after
the intervention (36-38 weeks’ gestation), and 6-8 weeks’ postpartum
Primary endpoint: not reported.
Primary outcome: self-reported UI and FI (flatus or anal incontinence, or both)
Secondary outcomes: questions from the Severity Index and ICIQ-SF.
Notes
Losses to follow-up after the intervention (36-38 weeks’ gestation): PFMT 10/52; control
11/53 (total 20%)
Losses to follow-up 6-8 weeks’ postpartum: PFMT 9/52; control 6/53 (total 14.3%)

PFMT (n = 140): 1-to-1 sessions, 20-30 min once per week, between 6th and 8th
month of pregnancy (total of 8). An evaluation of PFM contraction was performed at
each session through vaginal examination. PFMT supervised by 37 different therapists
(physiotherapists and midwives who received an initial training course given by a phys-
iotherapist specialising in PFM training), chosen by the woman from the list drawn up
in each centre. Women were encouraged to perform daily PFM exercises at home. No
specific instructions provided on the number or intensity of the contractions. However,
note that abstract (Fritel and colleagues 2013) states women were given written infor-
mation about UI and how to perform a series of 10 to 20 PFM contractions daily
Control (n = 142): written information on pelvic floor anatomy and PFM contraction
exercises, at the time of inclusion. These instructions were also given to the PFMT group

Methods
2-arm, parallel groups RCT.
Participants
20 women with UI symptoms, < 6 weeks’ postpartum.
Inclusion: UI after childbirth, as diagnosed by an urogynaecologist, < 6 weeks after
normal vaginal delivery
Exclusion: genitourinary disease or infection, treatment administered for UI, obstetrical
operation history
Age, mean (SD), years: PFMT 31.4 (2.8); control 32.0 (2.6).
Parity, mean (SD), number: PFMT 1.4 (0.5); control 1.6 (0.5).
Delivery: normal vaginal.
BMI, mean (SD): PFMT 23.6 (1.8); control 24.6 (1.8).
Incontinence at recruitment: all.
Setting: Dong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.
Interventions
PFMT (n = 10): utilising trunk stabilisation (Koumantakis 2005), as part of a group
session (3 times per week, 60 min) led by a specialist physiotherapist, over 8 weeks (23
in total). At the 1st session, the physiotherapist provided participants in both groups
with information on basic anatomy and PFM function to facilitate a voluntary PFM
contraction. Perineometry used to assist awareness and control of PFM contractions
(but unclear if this was part of every session). Participants were instructed to perform
the PFMT programme daily at home, and were provided with a home exercise training
booklet and an exercise diary
Control (n = 10): women received the same information and demonstration session as

described above for those in the supervised group sessions. They then followed the same
PFMT programme, performing the same daily home exercises by themselves for an 8-
week period without physiotherapist supervision
Outcomes
Measured at baseline (< 6 weeks’ postpartum) and at 8 weeks’ post-treatment
Primary endpoint: 8 weeks’ post-treatment.
Primary outcome: BFLUTS - quality of life domain.
Secondary outcomes: BFLUTS - urinary symptoms domain; PFM strength (blinded
perineometry, maximal vaginal squeeze pressure and holding time, mean of 3 trials)
Notes
Losses to follow-up at 8 weeks postpartum: PFMT 1/10; control 1/10 (total 10%). These
2 participants were excluded from the data analysis due to “irregular participation in
intervention sessions.”

Interventions
PFMT (n = 103): either in groups or on an individual basis (50 min, median 5 (range
2-10)) depending on the number of women present, supervised by a physiotherapist
between 18-24 weeks’ and 36-38 weeks’ gestation. PFMT was additional to the routine
activities offered at the antenatal clinic (but held on the same days as these antenatal
visits). Each session included non-aerobic exercises designed to reduce back pain, help
venous return, prevent UI and minimise anxiety. Women also received standard antenatal
education, and were instructed to perform daily PFMT at home as well as ≥ 30 min of
aerobic exercise daily. Instructions provided on performance of correct PFM contraction,
but this was not evaluated (due to the pragmatic nature of the study). Women were given
an exercise guide (PFMT and general stretching) and asked to complete an exercise diary
Control (n = 102): usual care. Women participated in routine antenatal educational
activities and received standard postnatal care and education from trained physiotherapy,
nursing and medical staff (on the maternity ward)

BMI, mean (SD): not reported.
Incontinence at recruitment: not reported.
Setting: labour ward and perineal clinic, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin
Interventions
PFMT plus biofeedback (n = 30): 2 sessions per day, 3 months’ duration. Biofeedback
training was undertaken in the perineal clinic and was delivered by either a specialist
obstetrician, a specialist nurse, or a combination of both; no written information was
provided. PFMT education was provided by senior midwives or physiotherapists on the
postnatal ward and written information was provided, with women to perform standard
Kegel exercises for 5 min. There was no mention of checking for a correct pelvic floor
contraction and once given the programme it appeared that no further contact was made
until the 3-month follow-up. Women were given an exercise diary to complete
PFMT alone (n = 90): women were educated on the ward before discharge, by senior
midwives or physiotherapists. Written instructions were provided with women to per-
form standard Kegel exercises for 5 min, 2 sessions per day

Setting: Gynecology and Obstetrics Service of Fuenlabrada University Hospital, Madrid,
Spain
Interventions
PFMT (n = 73): supervised exercise class (3 times per week, 60 min, 8-12 women)
designed and led by a physical activity and sport sciences graduate, at least 22 weeks’
duration (about 70-78 sessions in total). Class included a progressive PFMT programme
(approximately 10 min of each session), low impact aerobics including general strength
training, and stretching, relaxation and massage. All women received standard education
and information on PFM anatomy and function, but a correct PFM contraction was
not verified. Women were encouraged to perform 100 PFM contractions distributed in
different sets every day (unclear if this was in reference to a home programme)
Control (n = 96): usual care, which included follow-up by midwifes including infor-
mation about PFMT. Women were not asked not to do PFMT
Outcomes

Methods
2-arm (parallel groups) RCT.
Participants
268 primigravid women.
Inclusion: 20 weeks’ gestation, bladder neck hypermobility (> 5 mm linear movement
following standardised Valsalva) on perineal ultrasound
Exclusion: pre-pregnancy UI, neurological disorder.
Age, median (range), years: PFMT 27 (17-42); control 29 (16-47).
Parity: all primigravid.
Delivery: PFMT 66.1% vaginal, 17.8% instrumental, 16.1% caesarean; control 65.5%
vaginal, 21.8% instrumental, 12.7% caesarean
BMI, mean (SD): PFMT 25 (4); control 24 (4).
Incontinence at recruitment: none.
Setting: single centre, UK.
Interventions
PFMT (n = 139): 1-to-1 monthly sessions with a physiotherapist, between 20 weeks’
gestation and delivery. Progressive PFMT programme (based on that of Bø 1995) that
included daily PFMT at home (2 sets of exercises) with women asked to complete an
exercise diary. Women unable to follow PFMT protocol due to inability to contract the
PFM had an individualised programme until they were able to follow the study regimen
Control (n = 129): likely to have received verbal advice on PFMT from midwives
at antenatal classes. Probably monthly clinic visits for measurement of bladder neck
mobility and vaginal squeeze pressure (perineometry)

prepregnancy BMI < 30
Exclusion: stress UI during pregnancy, complications such as preterm labour, pregnancy-
induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, antenatal haemorrhage, pain during
PFM contraction or diseases that could interfere with the participant
Age, mean (SD), years: PFMT 27.6 (SD 5.1); control 28.2 (5.0).
Parity: primiparous.
Delivery: not applicable as primary endpoint was during pregnancy.
BMI prior to pregnancy, mean (SD): PFMT 21.7 (1.9); control 22.0 (1.9).
Incontinence at recruitment: none.
Setting: antenatal clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecological Nursing, Sri-
nakharinwirot University, Thailand (July-October 2012)
Interventions
PFMT (n = 35): supervised group PFMT programme (45 min, held once every 2 weeks,
4-5 women) led by a midwife, 6 weeks’ duration (a total of 3 sessions). All women received
antenatal education about PFM function, PFM strengthening and how to perform PFM
exercises. The ability to contract the PFM was assessed using the “stop test” (stop or slow
urinary flow for 1-2 sec). Women were instructed to perform 20 sets of exercises twice
per day at home, at least 5 days per week, and were provided with a 25-page PFMT
handbook and a urinary dairy
Control (n = 35): usual antenatal care from health professionals, obstetricians or mid-
wives (who were not involved in the study). Received information on diet, sleep, breast-
feeding and antenatal exercise for the benefit of preparing for childbirth and were in-
structed in the “stop test.” They did not receive information about stress UI during
pregnancy and had no training to support the performance of correct PFMT
Outcomes
Measured at baseline (20-30 weeks’ gestation) and 38 weeks’ gestation
Primary endpoint: 38 weeks’ gestation.
Primary outcome: self-reported UI (defined as involuntary leakage of urine on sneezing,
coughing, effort or physical exertion, ≥ 1 times per week)
Secondary outcomes: severity of UI comprised of frequency, volume of urine leakage
(minimal = a few drops, moderate = wetting underwear, large = sufficient to dampen
outer clothing) and perceived severity (visual analogue scale, 0-10)

Setting: 2 centres in Norway. Trondheim University Hospital (St. Olavs Hospital) and
Stavanger University Hospital
Interventions
PFMT (n = 429): supervised group exercise class (once per week, 8-15 women, 60 min)
, led by a physiotherapist over a 12-week period. Class included a progressive PFMT
programme that was included in a 20- to 25-min block of strengthening exercises (in
addition to 30-35 min low-impact aerobics and 5-10 min of stretching). All women
received written information on PFMT, individual instruction in PFM anatomy and
how to perform a correct PFM contraction (confirmed by vaginal palpation) by a phys-
iotherapist. Also encouraged to perform PFMT at home at least twice per week as part
of a 45-min home programme (written instructions provided) and complete an exercise
diary
Control (n = 426): usual care including standard antenatal care and information pro-
vided by midwife or general practitioner. Women were not discouraged from doing
PFMT. All women received the same written information and recommendations on
PFMT as the intervention group, including detailed information about the pelvic floor
and an evidence-based PFMT programme
Outcomes
Measured at baseline (18-22 weeks’ gestation) and end of treatment (32-36 weeks’ ges-
tation)
Primary endpoint: end of treatment (32-36 weeks’ gestation).
Primary outcome: self-reported UI and anal incontinence via a questionnaire that in-
cluded Sandvik’s severity index (UI) and St. Marks score (anal incontinence). Urinary
leakage subclassified as UI, stress UI and urge UI with severity categorised as “urinary
leakage < once per week” or “urinary leakage equal to or greater than once per week”
(severe UI). Anal incontinence categorised into FI and flatal incontinence
Secondary outcomes: frequency, intensity and type of physical activity (including
PFMT), training diary (intervention group only). Labour and delivery outcomes

physiotherapist at 3, 4, 6 and 9 months’ postpartum with use of perineometer at each
visit for biofeedback. Women were to aim for 80-100 voluntary PFM contractions daily,
for up to 9 months

1. The search was updated to February 2017 and 17
new trials incorporated (taking the total number of in-
cluded trials to 38 (involving 9892 women)). In addi-
tion, two abstracts which were the primary reference
in the last version were replaced by full papers.
2. The GRADE method was implemented through-
out the review to assess the quality of evidence; and a
’Summary of findings’ table was added.
3. The comparisons and subgroups were substantially
amended.
4. There has been a change in authorship.
20 December 2017
New citation required and conclusions have changed
1. The overall findings are similar to the previous ver-
sion of the review, with the exception of the evidence
summary for the effectiveness of postnatal pelvic floor
muscle training as a treatment for incontinence; we
are less certain about this effect than previously. The
findings altered because the way the data were grouped
changedtoreportoutcomesaccordingtothe time since
the birth rather than time since intervention. This de-
cision about timing of outcomes was made, a priori,
when choosing outcomes for the ’Summary of find-
ings’ table

1. In accordance with the latest Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, this updated review now includes the use of
GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence and includes ’Summary of findings’ tables, which were not in the previous version
of this review (Boyle 2012; Higgins 2011).
2. The way the data were grouped changed to report outcomes according to the time since the birth rather than time since intervention.
This decision about timing of outcomes was made, a priori, when choosing outcomes for the ’Summary of findings’ table.
3. A previously included trial was excluded (Dannecker 2004) (see the Characteristics of excluded studies).
