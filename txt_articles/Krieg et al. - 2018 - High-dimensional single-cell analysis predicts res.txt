Abstract: Immune-checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer therapy. In particular, inhibition of
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has been found to be effective for the treatment of metastatic
melanoma and other cancers. Despite a dramatic increase in progression-free survival, a large proportion
of patients do not show durable responses. Therefore, predictive biomarkers of a clinical response are
urgently needed. Here we used high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline
for the in-depth characterization of the immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with stage
IV melanoma before and after 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. During therapy, we observed a
clear response to immunotherapy in the T cell compartment. However, before commencing therapy, a
strong predictor of progression-free and overall survival in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the
frequency of CD14+CD16−HLA-DRhi monocytes. We confirmed this by conventional flow cytometry in
an independent, blinded validation cohort, and we propose that the frequency of monocytes in PBMCs
may serve in clinical decision support.

ABSTRACT 
Immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer therapy. In particular, 
inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is effective for the treatment of 
metastatic melanoma and other cancers. Despite a dramatic increase in progression-
free survival, a large proportion of patients do not show durable response. Therefore, 
predictive biomarkers of clinical response are desperately needed. Here, we employed 
high-dimensional single cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline for the in-
depth characterization of the immune compartment in liquid biopsies from the same 
metastatic melanoma patient before and after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We could 
observe a clear treatment response to immunotherapy in the T cell compartment. 
However, a strong predictor of progression free and overall survival in response to 
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the frequency of CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi monocytes. 
We could confirm this by regular flow cytometry in an independent validation cohort 
and propose this as a novel predictive biomarker for therapy decisions in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION 
Immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 aims to block the interaction of tumor-reactive T cells 
with PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) expressed on various cell types including 
leukocytes and the tumor cells themselves1. Clinical trials on PD-1 and PD-L1 
blockade for patients with advanced melanoma have demonstrated consistent 
therapeutic responses, thus prompting their application to several other cancers2-8.  
Despite these encouraging results, clinical outcomes remain highly variable, with only 
a fraction of patients showing durable responses, some with early progression and 
others with late response, while the majority of treated patients show no beneficial 
clinical response2,9. Reliable criteria to discriminate responders from non-responders 
prior to treatment initiation are urgently needed. Predictive biomarkers would allow 
for the selection of patients who are more likely to respond and to provide potential 
non-responders with alternative, perhaps more efficacious, therapeutic options. Some 
recent reports used single-cell analysis to evaluate the expression of PD-1 and 
downstream signaling molecules on tumor infiltrating and circulating CD8+ T cells 
with the aim of identifying such predictive biomarkers10,11. However, these 
approaches are hampered by the limited accessibility of patient material, low 
dimensionality, overfitting due to the absence of independent validation cohorts, and 
lack of systematic, unbiased bioinformatics pipelines resulting in a paucity of 
predictive biomarkers to date12. Single-cell analysis of human immune compartments 
has so far been limited by the parameters that can be visualized by conventional flow 
cytometry13.  
In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from metastatic 
melanoma patients before and during therapy as a readily accessible and minimally 
invasive biopsy that has been shown to be more representative than tumor biopsies to 
probe 
immune 
signatures 
associated 
with 
responsiveness 
to 
anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy14. High dimensional, single cell mass cytometry was used along with 
optimized immune marker panels and a customized, interactive bioinformatics 
pipeline to generate a thorough analysis of the peripheral blood immune cells in an 
effort to identify a responsiveness-associated predictive signature.

RESULTS 
Stratification of responders versus non-responders using single cell mass cytometry 
We performed the initial analysis with 40 cryopreserved PBMC samples isolated from 
the blood of a cohort of 20 melanoma patients before and after anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy, as well as 20 samples from 10 age- and sex-matched healthy donors 
(toal N=60). Baseline samples and samples obtained after 12 weeks of anti-PD1 
therapy originated from the same patients (Table 1, Figure 1A and Supplementary 
Figure 17).

For the CyTOF analysis, frozen PBMCs were thawed and stained (Figure 1A and 
Supplementary Table 1) using three separate and partially overlapping mass 
cytometry panels, one for the phenotypic characterization of lymphocytes, one for T 
cell function and one specifically for the in-depth characterization of myeloid cells. 
The first staining panel contained 30 leukocyte markers to identify all major immune 
cell populations and cover all stages of T cell differentiation and activation 
(Supplementary Table 1).  After acquisition, each sample was de-barcoded using 
Boolean gating.  Staining quality was evaluated by defining a biological positive and 
negative control (Supplementary Figure 1).

After data pre-processing (see Methods), we performed hierarchical clustering on 
normalized (per batch) median marker expression values on CD45+ live cells in every 
patient before and after therapy. As shown in Figure 1B, the dendrogram displayed 
two major clades of samples. The left branch contained 15 samples, of which all were 
responders, whereas the right branch consisted of 72% non-responders (18/25). Thus, 
normalized median marker expression was sufficient to robustly separate most 
responders from non-responders. The unbiased clustering approach stratified the 
patients into responders and non-responders prior to therapy, which encouraged us to 
analyze the dataset more deeply. 
 
Altered T cell memory compartment before therapy in responders 
We began our comparative analysis between responders and non-responders, before 
and after therapy initiation, by investigating the global (measured based on all the 
cells) median expression of the 29 markers (Figure 1C). Significant increases in the 
expression of HLA-DR, CTLA-4, CD56, and CD45RO and decreased amounts of 
CD3, CD27, and CD28 were observed in responders versus non-responders. 
Next, we sought to identify which cell populations best described the cellular 
frequency differences between responders and non-responders. Markers used for 
subsequent cell clustering were selected using the PCA informativeness score 
established by Levine et al.15, cells were clustered using the FlowSOM algorithm16,17 
with consensus clustering, separately for each of the measurements rounds. A two-
dimensional t-stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) projection18 was used for 
visualization along with heatmaps of normalized (0-1) median marker expression in 
each cluster, as shown in Figure 1D. Based on the median marker intensities observed 
in the clusters, we manually annotated the seven major cell populations (CD4 T cells, 
CD8 T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, B cells, γδT cells, and myeloid cells) in both 
measurement rounds. We subsequently examined differences in frequencies of the 
identified clusters between the three groups (HD, NR, R) (Figure 1E) using 
generalized mixed models (see workflow19 and Supplementary Methods). Of note, the 
barcoding allowed the model to track the patients and match baseline and on-
treatment samples for the analysis. In responders, the frequency of CD4+ T cells and 
CD8+ T cells was lower, while the frequency of CD19- HLA-DR+ myeloid cells was 
significantly elevated (adjusted p-values = 1.55e-05, 1.74e-03 and 1.74e-03, 
respectively) compared to the non-responders (before and during treatment, Figure 1E 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 5 of 30 
 
and F). We also observed a higher frequency of NKT cells and a lower frequency of 
γδT cells (adjusted p-values = 3.07e-03 and 2.52e-03) in responders versus non-
responders at both time points. In order to evaluate whether the immune status in the 
blood of responders might be reflected in the tumor environment, we analyzed 23 
matched tumor biopsies within our cohort. Specifically, we assessed the infiltration by 
T cells (CD3, CD8, CD4), the number of phagocytes (CD68, CD163), as well as the 
expression of PD-L1. As expected, we found that responding patients had higher 
numbers of infiltrating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure 2). 
 
Since T cells are described to be the major target of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and 
given the altered T cell composition in responders before immunotherapy, we next 
compared the median marker expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (isolated in silico 
from the sets displaying in Figure 1D, 1E) between non-responders and responders 
before and after therapy. Global differential marker expression on merged samples in 
CD4+ T cells in responders showed an up-regulation of CTLA-4, HLA-DR, CD69, 
and BTLA (Figure 2A). CD8+ T cells in responders showed a higher expression of 
CD45RO, CTLA-4, CD62L, CD69, CD11a, and CCR4 (Figure 2B). This finding, 
together with the enrichment of CD8+ T cells in the tumor biopsies of responding 
patients, suggests that their CD8+ T cells show a higher migratory capacity. 
To determine whether there were differences in T cell subpopulations, we reran 
FlowSOM on the extracted CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells and subdivided them into 
CD45RO-CD62L+ naïve, CD45RO-CD62L- effector cells (TE), CD45RO+CD62L- 
effector memory (EM) cells, CD45RO+CD62L+ central memory (CM) cells or 
CD127-CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) by manual annotation19.  
 
We then compared the frequencies of resultant T cell sub-clusters between responders 
and non-responders before and 12 weeks after therapy (Figure 2C and 2D).  The 
patients who eventually responded to the therapy showed a significantly lower 
frequency of circulating CD4+ EM T cells, as well as a lower frequency of CD8+ 
naïve T cell at baseline and after treatment (adjusted p-values = 8.21e-03, 6.95e-03, 
respectively). Additionally, the CD8+ T cell subpopulation of responders had a higher 
frequency of CM T cells before and after treatment as compared to non-responder 
patients. In order to refine our analysis on CD8+ T cells, which have previously been 
associated with response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy20,21, we analyzed the phenotype 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 6 of 30 
 
of CD8+ T cell clusters at higher resolution using 100 FlowSOM clusters before and 
after therapy (Supplementary Figure 3). Only 2 clusters were found to be 
differentially abundant before therapy while 10 clusters after therapy were expanded 
in responders, which clearly shows a therapy-induced proliferative burst. Cluster 16 
(CD45RO+, CD27+, HLA-DR+) closely resembles the central memory CD8+ T cells, 
which were previously described to expand during anti-PD1 immunotherapy20. In 
agreement with previous research, we also found an increase in Tregs in cancer 
patients compared to healthy controls (Figure 2C). 
 
Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy alters the properties within the T cell compartment  
In order to compare the functional properties of T cells between non-responders and 
responders, we designed a second mass cytometry panel to investigate cytokine 
production (Supplementary Figure 4) in polyclonally activated cells. PBMCs were 
processed as described above. Briefly, single cell suspensions were cultured for 4h in 
the presence of PMA/Ionomycin, barcoded, stained, fixed and analyzed by mass 
cytometry. In order to analyze T cell function and the T cell phenotype independently, 
we first used surface markers (CD45RO, CD45RA, CCR7, CD28, CD127, CD69 and 
CD25) to define T cell subpopulations as in Figure 2C and 2D. Independent of the 
surface markers we extracted the frequencies of cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, 
IL-17A, GM-CSF, TNF-, IFN-, Grz-B), PD-1 and CTLA-4 positive T cells. 
Importantly, we found a modest increase in IL-4, granzyme-B, IFN-, and GM-CSF 
in CD4+ T cells and CTLA4, granzyme-B and IL-13 in CD8+ T cells between 
responders and non-responders prior to therapy (data not shown). However, after 
therapy T cells from responders presented with higher frequencies for PD-1, IL-4, 
IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-17A, and granzyme-B in CD4+ T cells (Figure 3A-D).  For CD8+ T 
cells, an up-regulation of CTLA4 and granzyme-B was detected in responders (Figure 
3E-H). In order to account for multifunctional T cells, we created a binary matrix 
containing all possible cytokine and PD-1 and CTLA-4 presence / absence 
combinations (based on marker-specific cutoffs; see Supplementary Materials for 
further details) in CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells. Cytokine combination groups (CCG) 
that were found to be differentially abundant between responders and non-responders 
are displayed for CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells in Figure 3B and 3F, respectively. 
Using this approach, we found 3 CCGs in the CD4+ T cell subsets that were observed 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 7 of 30 
 
at a higher frequency in responders compared to non-responders (Figure 3C). For 
CD8+ T cells, we found 13 CCGs that were expanded and 1 CCG that was reduced in 
responders (Figure 3G).  The significantly different CCGs were then linked back and 
displayed in context to the initial T cell subpopulation. Among the enlarged CCGs in 
the CD4+ T cells, the most common signature was CTLA-4+, granzyme-B+, TNF-α+, 
and PD-1+, thus the phenotype of these CCGs resembled CM (Figure 3D).  As for the 
CD8+ T cells, CCG 1, which was the only one down-regulated in frequency when 
comparing responders to non-responders, expressed no cytokines and its cell surface 
proteome resembled TE cells (Figure 3H). The only other cell population resembling 
TE cells was CCG 14, which was Granzyme-B+, TNF-α+, IFN-+, and IL-2+. The 
remaining 12 CCGs were expanded and were positive for at least two 
marker/cytokine combinations, thus most likely resembling so-called multifunctional 
T cells; all 12 were CTLA4+ and displayed a CM/TM or EM surface phenotype 
(Figure 3H). CTLA4+ CCGs could be separated into four groups distinguishable by 
their cytokine and CTLA4/PD-1 expression:  CCGs 4, 5, 12, 13, 21, and 28 expressed 
CTLA4 and were granzyme-B+, CCGs 44 and 45 were CTLA4+, TNF-α+, or IL-2+, 
CCGs 22, 30; 36 were all CTLA4 positive and produced IL-2 or IL-17 and CCG 43 
was only CTLA4+. Surface phenotype and cytokine profiles of the previously 
identified CCGs overlap with previously published CD45RA-Grz-B+CD8+ T cell 
populations expanding under anti-PD-1 immunotherapy20,21.  
 
Myeloid cell frequencies predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy 
Since we found higher frequencies of myeloid cells in anti-PD-1 therapy responders 
before therapy (Figure 1E), we interrogated a third myeloid centric panel 
(Supplementary Figure 5). FlowSOM was used to separate 7 subpopulations, which 
were annotated as T cells, B cells, NK cells, CD14+(CD11b+HLA-DRhi) myeloid cells, 
CD14-(CD11b+HLA-DRlo) myeloid cells, classical CD1c+CD11c+HLA-DR+ dendritic 
cells cDC, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD123+CD303+HLA-DR+CD11c- pDC). 
For the annotated clusters, cell frequencies were calculated in each sample and the 
composition of the individual samples was plotted (Figure 4A and Supplementary 
Figure 6). As already shown in Figure 1D, a significant lower frequency of T cells (p-
value = 1.59e-03) and a higher frequency of CD14+ myeloid cells was observed in 
responders (p-value = 5.82e-03, Supplementary Figure 6). Next, to better characterize 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 8 of 30 
 
the myeloid cells, we extracted live myeloid cells by manually gating out CD3+ and 
CD19+ cells, clustered, annotated and excluding CD7+ and CD56+ cells and marker 
expression from further analysis. Unsupervised clustering of normalized median 
marker expression values in myeloid cells again separated patients into two distinct 
clusters, with one clade being mostly composed of non-responders (12/14; 86%) and 
the other clade consisting of 76% (19/25) responders (Figure 4B). While we found 
that CD14- myeloid cells were indeed higher in cancer patients compared to healthy 
donors, we did not observe differences in this cell population between responders and 
non-responders. 
We next searched for changes in global median marker expression between non-
responders and responders, before and 12 weeks after therapy, and we found that 16 
markers (i.e., CD86, HLA-DR, CD141, ICAM-1, CD11c, PD-L1, CD38, CD16, 
CD33, CD11b, CD303, CD62L, CD1c, CD64, CD14, and CD34) were significantly 
up-regulated in the myeloid compartment of responders (Figure 4C). Of note, the 
enhanced frequency of IFN--producing T cells correlated with the expansion of the 
myeloid compartment and PD-L1 expression after therapy (Supplementary Figure 7). 
Next, FlowSOM was used to subdivide the myeloid compartment into 4 major 
clusters, which were annotated as CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi classical monocytes, 
CD14-CD33lowCD11b+HLA-DRlo myeloid cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
(CD123+CD303+HLA-DR+CD11c- pDC) and classical CD1c+CD11c+HLA-DR+ 
dendritic cells (cDC, Figure 4D). For higher resolution and in order to identify a core 
myeloid signature, 100 FlowSOM clusters were run on all cells and CD14+ myeloid 
cells were extracted. Clusters 8, 9, and 18 differed in some markers such as CD14, 
CD11c and PD-L1 expression but were still elevated in R over NR showing that they 
are a relatively homogenous cell population (Supplementary Figure 8).  
 
Identification of a monocyte signature using CellCnn 
FlowSOM allowed us to identify and characterize CD14+CD16b-HLA-DRhi 
monocytes as being elevated in responders compared to non-responders prior to anti-
PD-1 immunotherapy. To identify a core myeloid signature within CD14+CD16b-
HLA-DRhi cells that would allow us to predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy without prior assumptions, we used the machine learning 
algorithm CellCnn, which is based on a representation learning approach using 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 9 of 30 
 
convolutional neural networks and is designed to detect rare cell populations 
associated with disease status22. In a data driven way, CellCnn automatically “learns” 
combinations of markers (“filters”, which do not need to correspond to known 
populations), whose presence or frequency discriminates between two groups. We ran 
CellCnn on all cells of the baseline samples with staining panel 3 and identified a 
discriminating cell population with a relative abundance of 4.8% +/- 2.0% (mean +/- 
standard deviation) in responders compared to 2.4% +/- 1.5% in non-responders 
(Supplementary Figure 9).  Although the variability within each group was relatively 
large, we found the difference in abundance to be statistically significant (p-value < 
0.01, see Supplementary Materials). In terms of marker expression, we found that this 
automatically detected population contained a core signature of CD14+, CD33+, HLA-
DRhi, ICAM-1+, CD64+, CD141+, CD86+, CD11c+, CD38+, PD-L1+ and CD11b+ 
monocytes (Supplementary Figure 9). Back projection of this cell population to the 
tSNE map, independently generated from all cells in panel 3, showed a striking 
overlap with the CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi cluster (Supplementary Figure 10). 
 
In depth characterization of the myeloid compartment by RNA-seq 
In a final approach, in order to characterize the identified myeloid cells in more depth, 
we performed RNA sequencing on sorted CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi cells from HD, NR 
and R at baseline. The most striking differences in gene-expression were observed 
between cancer patients and healthy donors. In particular, we found an enrichment in 
genes associated with metabolism, migration and inflammation in caner patients 
(Figure 4E). No immunosuppressive genes were found to be elevated in the 
circulating CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi cells of cancer patients as compared to healthy 
donors. Moreover, we found no significant difference in gene expression when 
comparing CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi cells of non-responders and responders, with the 
exception of CXCL2, which was marginally elevated in responders (Supplementary 
Figure 11). These data suggest that the frequency of circulating myeloid cells rather 
than 
gene-expression 
patterns 
or 
monocyte 
polarization 
correlates 
with 
responsiveness to anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

Validation of cellular immune signature by Citrus and conventional flow cytometry  
As an independent validation of the computational results, we employed Citrus, which 
is a clustering-based supervised algorithm that identifies stratifying signatures, to 
compare the identified cell types and marker expression differences that could 
distinguish between non-responders and responders before therapy (Supplementary 
Figures 12 and 13).  Citrus independently confirmed the lower frequency observed in 
the T cell compartment and the elevation of the myeloid compartment before therapy, 
as shown in panels 1 and 3.  
To facilitate the translation of our observations into clinical practice, we designed a 
flow cytometry-based validation panel using a reduced number of markers. We 
selected a combination of markers that were significantly differentially expressed in 
Figures 1C and 4C and markers that define the cellular composition in the blood 
(Supplementary Figure 14). A blinded validation was performed on PBMCs from a 
second independent cohort of 31 melanoma patients containing 15 responders and 16 
non-responders before anti-PD-1 therapy (Table 2).

The data confirmed the lower frequency of T cells (CD3+ CD56-, p=1.67e-02) and the 
higher frequency of CD14+ monocytes (CD3-CD19-CD14+CD16-HLA-DR+, p=1.99e-
06) before therapy in responders, as already shown by mass cytometry (Figure 4F). In 
order to visualize and assess the survival benefit conferred by a higher frequency of 
classical monocytes prior to treatment, we calculated the optimal cut-off point in 
monocytes frequency, which best stratifies responders and non-responders. The 
calculated cutoff of 19.38% was then used to compute a cumulative hazard function 
for the high and low monocyte frequency groups. The resulting plot shows a clear 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 11 of 30 
 
difference in hazard ratios between patients who have a high frequency or a low 
frequency of classical monocytes at baseline. Our model thus indicates that a classical 
monocyte frequency higher than 19.38%, before anti-PD1 therapy initiation, is 
predictive of a better treatment response and patient survival (Figure 4G). 
 
Cox regression identified immature granulocytes and measured monocytes to be 
associated with progression free survival 
Finally, using a Cox proportional-hazards model, we assessed the prognostic value of 
53 standard clinical parameters (Supplementary Figure 15) plus the frequency of 
classical monocytes (all measured at the baseline) with progression-free survival 
(PFS) in all the 51 patients used in this study. Multiple variables were significant in 
the univariate analysis (Supplementary Figure 16). There were no additional variables 
robustly associated with PFS in the multivariate analysis (including all factors with p-
values < 0.05 from the univariate analysis), other than immature granulocytes and 
classical monocytes (Supplementary Figure 16B). The same 53 parameters were 
tested for association with response (NR versus R) using linear models (LM) for 
continuous parameters and generalized linear models (GLM) for the binary 
parameters and confirmed classical monocytes to be different (data not shown). This 
was an exhaustive analysis of all features that are routinely recorded in a standard 
clinical setting and confirms the relevance of our discovery that the measurement of 
classical monocyte frequencies could provide a simple yet powerful tool to clinical 
practice.

DISCUSSION 
The successful therapeutic responses in patients with advanced melanoma encouraged 
the application of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to several other cancers, such as non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), metastatic renal cell carcinoma, metastatic 
squamous NSCLC, Hodgkin`s lymphoma, advanced gastric cancer, advanced bladder 
cancer, head and neck cancer, and triple negative breast cancer2,3,23,5-7,9,24,25. Despite 
increasing overall survival in 33-40% of melanoma patients, anti-PD1 treatment is not 
effective in the majority of treated patients and results in disease progression at a 
median follow-up of 21 months in only 25% of patients26,27. Moreover, given the 
broadening of its application, we can anticipate that the rate of non-responding and 
relapsing patients to anti-PD-1 therapy will further increase. In this context, the 
identification of biomarkers allowing for the discrimination of responders and non 
responders before therapy initiation may tailor the application of this treatment only 
to those patients that are likely to benefit from it, while providing alternative 
treatments to the patients that are unlikely to show a response.  In our study, by using 
single cell mass cytometry combined with clustering and regression analyses, we 
searched for differential immune signatures in responders versus non-responders 
before therapy. Besides a modest alteration of the lymphocyte compartment before 
therapy, i.e. lymphopenia of CD4 and CD8 T cells, γδT cells and a slight elevation of 
NKT cells, we could clearly show that classical CD14+CD16-CD33+HLA-DRhi 
monocytes were the strongest predictor of responsiveness 
to anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy.  
The higher frequency of CD14+CD16-CD33+HLA-DRhi classical monocytes in 
responders before therapy is striking. In recent years, the role of myeloid cells in 
cancer has been extensively debated and numerous studies have addressed the role of 
the so called myeloid derived suppressor cells, which have been shown to arise during 
chronic inflammation and cancer28. However, the phenotypic, morphological and 
functional heterogeneity of these cells generates confusion when investigating their 
roles in anti-cancer immune responses. It has been proposed that high frequencies of 
myeloid cells with immunosuppressive features, defined as CD33+CD11b+HLA-
DRlo/-, may lead to T cell dysfunction and failure to respond to immunotherapy. 
Accordingly, a reduction of suppressive myeloid cells correlated with an increase in 
the objective clinical responses and long-term survival29-31. Myeloid-associated 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 13 of 30 
 
markers have been linked to poor clinical outcome32,33. In our study, we used 
clustering to define cell populations and found that the frequency of a cell population 
resembling CD33lowCD11b+HLA-DRlo myeloid cells shows no differences between 
responders and non-responders and remains constant before and after therapy. In 
addition, in responding patients classical monocytes (CD14+CD16-) were highly 
activated as shown by increased ICAM-1 and HLA-DR levels. This suggests that 
monocytes may sustain the development of an effective anti-tumor immune response 
during anti PD-1 immunotherapy, similarly to what has been described for CD14-
CD16+ monocytes during anti-CTLA-4 treatment34. Further support for a critical role 
of monocytes in anti-tumor immune responses comes from a study in which untreated 
melanoma patients with the highest tumor burden harbored dysregulated intermediate 
(CD14+CD16+) and non-classical monocytes (CD14-CD16+) characterized by a 
dramatic decrease of HLA-DR and inflammatory markers35. Further, the up-
regulation of PD-L1 on the monocytes from responders before therapy could be a 
result of the higher activation status of these cells. It is well described that IFN-γ can 
induce the up-regulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 on T and myeloid cells, respectively36,37.  
 
In line with the notion that the presence of highly activated classical monocytes may 
be a prerequisite for a successful response during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy we 
reported higher frequencies of central memory T cells and NKT cells in circulation 
and a more activated (CTLA-4+, TNF-α +, PD-1+, granzyme-B+ and IL-2+) T cell 
compartment after therapy in responding patients. This is consistent with the 
observation by Wherry and colleagues that after 3 weeks of anti-PD-1 therapy T cell 
proliferation peaks but can still be observed after 12 weeks20.  
Given the shift of frequency from naïve to central memory T cells in responders 
before therapy and the increase in CTLA-4, IFN-, IL-17A, granzyme-B and PD-1 
after therapy, our findings confirm that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy supports 
functionally activated T cells. This is in line with recent research showing that higher 
levels of CTLA-4 on intra-tumoral T cells correlated with better response to anti-PD-
1 treatment and that resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was associated with 
defects in the pathways of antigen presentation and interferon-receptor signalling10,36. 
Indeed, besides being a regulator during T cell expansion, CTLA-4 is also a marker of 
activated T cells38. Further, enhanced NK T cell frequencies after immunotherapy 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 14 of 30 
 
correlated with positive clinical responses in melanoma patients, while elevated 
frequencies of some γδT cell subsets following anti-CTLA4 treatment correlated with 
decreased clinical benefit39,40. Lastly, we found a consistent and significant reduction 
of T cells in the peripheral blood of responders compared to non-responders (Fig. 2C 
and D). This phenomenon may be due to their enhanced ability to migrate to the 
tumor site41. Indeed, we also found an up-regulation of CD11a in the CD8+ T cell 
compartment of responder patients, which has been shown to be essential for 
migration to lymph nodes and distal sites 38,42. Lastly, Th17 cells were recently 
demonstrated to be potent apoptosis-resistant anti-tumor effector cells43,44. 
The goal of this study was to interrogate the PBMC compartment for signatures that 
predict anti-PD-1 response. We observed that a reduction in T cell frequency and 
increase in myeloid cells -before therapy initiation- correspond with treatment 
response and overall survival. Further, the tendency of increased tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes in R patients supports the notion that myeloid cell frequency increases 
when T cells move from the blood into the tumor, which is consistent with previous 
studies10,41. This phenomenon is - in all likelihood - the result of the increased (albeit 
insufficient) anti-tumor response in baseline patients, who are more likely become 
responders. Indeed, IFN-gamma produced by anti-tumor NK cells and T cells can 
trigger myeloid cell egress from the bone marrow45,46. In addition, IFN-gamma has 
been shown to enhance myeloid cell expansion47. Altogether, we provided evidence 
for a response-associated immune signature in metastatic melanoma patients during 
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. In order to do this, we applied a recently-developed 
bioinformatics workflow19. The advantage of this workflow over existing methods, 
such as Citrus48, is that we can compare multiple conditions (HD, R vs NR), account 
for sample pairing and adjust for batch effects, all in a single model. We are aware of 
the large variability between the two measurements in the discovery cohort, but, using 
our custom bioinformatic workflow, we were able to observe a significant difference 
in classical monocyte frequencies. Moreover, using traditional FACS analysis we 
could confirm this monocyte frequency difference in R vs NR patients in a 
second, blinded, independent cohort of patients undergoing immunotherapy. 
 
Future studies entailing a systematic, prospective collection of paired blood and tumor 
samples should confirm these signatures in larger, multi-center cohorts of melanoma 
patients as well as in patients with other cancer types for which anti-PD-1 treatment 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 15 of 30 
 
has been approved. A prediction signature could then be directly used in clinical 
practice to stratify patients prior to initiating immunotherapy. Our findings might help 
to further elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of anti-PD-1 activity. 
 
 
ONLINE METHODS 
Patient Samples 
Fifty-one cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples of 
melanoma patients (median: 84 days, range: 23-162 days, average: 87.3 days) were 
provided by the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland  
(see Table 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figure 17). From 20 of these patients, called 
the discovery cohort, samples before and about 12 weeks after anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy initiation were used (N=40). Patients were treated with 3mg/kg 
Nivolumab every 2 weeks or 2mg/kg Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 12 weeks 
when their clinical status was assessed again. Response was defined as the patient’s 
disease control rate (DCR) in the course of treatment. That is, the responder group 
comprises every patient who showed signs of clinical benefit within the first 15 weeks 
of treatment, which includes partial response (PR), complete response (CR), and 
stable disease (SD) thus better capturing “real-world-patients”. The non-responder 
group included every patient who discontinued treatment due to disease progression 
or showed signs of progression within the first 15 weeks of treatment. Progression 
was defined as either a measurable increase in tumor size, new metastatic sites, or the 
need to treat the patient with a secondary treatment such as radiotherapy. The 
validation cohort was composed of 31 melanoma patients. Samples from the 
validation cohort were collected prior to anti-PD-1 therapy initiation. 
 
Stimulations, stainings, and mass cytometry acquisition 
PBMC stimulations, staining and acquisition by mass cytometry were performed as 
described previously49. Frozen PBMCs were used in this retrospective study to 
balance cohorts in terms of response and to reduce batch-effects through a unique bar-
coding strategy.  Data were stored using the Flow Repository50 which can be accessed 
under: https://flowrepository.org/experiments/1124. Full methods are included in the 
Supplementary Materials. 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 16 of 30 
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
Data acquired by mass cytometry was normalized using the standalone MATLAB 
normalizer (Version 2013b)51, marker expression was controlled in FlowJo 
(Version10.1r5) and patient samples were de-barcoded using Boolean gating. For 
further analysis we developed a customized R workflow in order to discover different 
biomarkers when comparing marker expression between responders and non-
responders. The workflow is described in the Supplementary Materials and the R code 
can be accessed under: https://github.com/gosianow/carsten_cytof_code.  Additional 
analyses to identify distinguishing cell subsets were done using CellCnn, see 
Supplementary 
Materials 
(code 
available 
under: 
https://github.com/lmweber/PD1_analysis_CellCnn).  
 
Transcriptomic analysis 
CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhiLin- (CD3, CD4, CD19, CD45RO) monocytes were sorted 
from frozen PBMC form blood samples from HD, R and NR at baseline. RNA was 
isolated using the RNA plus micro kit (Qiagen). We used the SMARTer Stranded 
total rna-seq pico kit (Clontech) for RNA preparations. Samples were sequenced on 
Illumina MySeq. Reads in FASTQ format from the 12 samples were quantified at the 
transcript level using Salmon52 against an Ensembl catalog, aggregated to the gene 
level using tximport53 and delivered to edgeR54 for the differential expression analysis 
using the GLM functionality55.  To determine differential expression, a (false 
discovery rate) FDR cutoff of 5% and minimum fold-change of 1.5 was used. Due to 
the gender bias in responders (R) versus non-responders (NR), 14 genes from the Y 
chromosome were removed before differential expression analysis. 
 
Validation by flow cytometry 
Validation of the CyTOF data was done with a combination of markers with 
significantly different expression from the initial discovery mass cytometry approach, 
and markers that defined the cellular composition in blood using flow cytometry 
(Supplementary Figure 9). A set of PBMCs was analyzed in a blinded fashion from a 
second, independent cohort of 31 melanoma patients containing 15 responders and 16 
non-responders before anti-PD-1 therapy. The panel is described in the 
Supplementary Materials. At least 100`000 live cells were acquired using Diva 
 Krieg et al. - HighDim analysis predicts response to PD-1 therapy – manuscript 
page 17 of 30 
 
software on a Fortessa flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software 
(TriStar). From FlowJo data, the frequencies of CD3+ T cells and CD14+CD16-HLA-
DRhi monocytes were extracted from the three groups (R, NR, HD). For statistical 
testing, we applied a generalized linear model (GLM) and cutpoint calculations as 
described in the Supplementary Materials.

tSNE visualization of 45`000 merged events from non-responders (NR), responders (R), and healthy 
donors (HD) from dataset 1. Cells are colored according to the cluster they were assigned to using the 
FlowSOM algorithm and manual annotation. The heatmap represents the median arcsinh-transformed 
marker expression normalized to 0-1 range of respective markers within the 7 cellular clusters from 
dataset 1 and was used to annotate clusters. (E) Direct comparison of cluster frequencies in healthy 
donors (HD, black), non-responders (NR, pink) and responders (R, green) in dataset 1 and 2. Asterisks 
indicate the significance level of differences in cell frequencies between NR and R before and after 
treatment (adjusted p-value < 0.01***). (F) Relationship between CD4 or CD8 T cell frequency and 
myeloid cell frequency. R indicates Spearman correlation between these quantities.

Figure 2. Differences in T cell activation status and in the frequency of the T cell subpopulations 
before and after 12 weeks of therapy in responders and non-responders. (A, B) Heatmap of per 
batch normalized (mean of zero and standard deviation of one) median marker expression for markers 
that are significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.05) differentially expressed between responders (green bar 
on top) and non-responders (pink bar on top) before and after therapy in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. 
Numbers in brackets show adjusted p-values. (C, D) FlowSOM was used to generate indicated T cell 
subpopulations and resultant cluster frequencies are plotted as in Figure 1E. Asterisks indicate the 
significance level of differences in cell frequencies between NR and R before and after treatment, 
except for Tregs, where the difference between HD and cancer patients (R and NR) was tested 
(adjusted p-value < 0.01***, < 0.1*).

Figure 3 (continued). Increased activation in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells after immunotherapy start in 
responders. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after therapy were polyclonally activated with PMA/Ionomycin. 
Frequencies of PD-1, CTLA-4, and cytokines in (A, E) CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in responders 
(green) and non-responders (pink) were compared. Healthy subjects (black) served as controls. 
Asterisks indicate the significance level of differences in cell frequencies between NR and R after 
treatment (adjusted p-value < 0.01***, < 0.05**, < 0.1*) (B, F) A matrix combining all cytokine 
positive cells into cytokine combination groups (CCGs) for CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was created 
and cells were sorted into this matrix using FlowSOM. Shown are the significantly different CCGs 
after comparing responders to non-responders. (C, G) Shown are frequencies of significantly different 
CCGs between responders and non-responders from that matrix. (D, H) The phenotypic composition of 
the significantly different CCGs for CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (right panel). Phenotypes were 
derived from heatmaps shown in the left panel.

Figure 4. Patient stratification based on myeloid cell markers and expansion and enhanced 
activation of classical monocytes in responders. (A) Comparison of sample composition in healthy 
donors (HD) non-responders (NR) and responders (R) before and after anti-PD-1 therapy. (B) Heatmap 
of normalized median marker expression with dendrograms for markers (rows) and samples (columns) 
constructed, as in Figure 1B, for myeloid markers. Bars on top of the heatmap represent individual 
samples from responders (green) and non-responders (pink) from the two time points (no. patients=20, 
no. samples=39 - one baseline sample with a cell count < 50 was excluded from the further analysis. 
(C) Heatmap of normalized median marker expression for markers that are significantly (adjusted p-
value < 0.05) differentially expressed between responders and non-responders before and 12 weeks 
after therapy initiation, as in Figure 1C, in the myeloid compartment (CD3−CD19−). Bars on top of the 
heatmaps represent individual samples from responders (green) versus non-responders (pink). Numbers 
in brackets show adjusted p-values.

Figure 4 (continued). Patient stratification based on myeloid cell markers and expansion and 
enhanced activation of classical monocytes in responders. (D) tSNE visualization of FlowSOM-
generated myeloid clusters (CD3−CD19−) in merged data from non-responders (NR), responders (R) 
and health donors (HD), as in Figure 1D. CD7+ and CD56+ cells were excluded from analysis. The 
heatmap on the right represents the expression of respective markers within the cellular clusters. (E) 
RNA sequencing analysis of CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi monocytes sorted form HD, R, and NR before 
therapy displaying a heatmap of 56 significantly different genes when comparing HD to cancer patients 
(R and NR).  Expression values were quantified with Salmon and represented as a fold-change relative 
to the median gene expression. Differential expression was determined using edgeR. The three 
columns on the left sort the genes according to their function (migration, inflammation and 
metabolism).

Figure 4 (continued). Patient stratification based on myeloid cell markers and expansion; 
enhanced activation of classical monocytes in responders. (F) Validation of results on a second 
independent cohort of 31 patients using flow cytometry and CD3, CD4, CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD16, 
CD33, CD56, HLA-DR markers (HD black, NR red, R green). (G) Cumulative hazard and overall 
survival in patients with monocyte frequencies above (blue) and below (red) 19.38% over time 
(months). Shows p-value of log-rank test. The box plots represent monocyte frequency at baseline 
against progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months and overall survival (OS) at 12 months in non-
responders (red) and responders (blue). Wilcoxon test was used to calculate the displayed p-value.
