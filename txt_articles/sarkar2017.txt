Association between adiposity outcomes and residential 
density: a full-data, cross-sectional analysis of 419 562 UK 
Biobank adult participants
Chinmoy Sarkar, Chris Webster, John Gallacher
Summary
Background Obesity is a major health issue and an important public health target for urban design. However, the 
evidence for identifying the optimum residential density in relation to obesity has been far from compelling. We 
examined the association of obesity with residential density in a large and diverse population sample drawn from the 
UK Biobank to identify healthy-weight-sustaining density environments.
Methods For this full-data, cross-sectional analysis, we used UK Biobank data for adult men and women aged 
37–73 years from 22 cities across the UK. Baseline examinations were done between 2006 and 2010. Residential unit 
density was objectively assessed within a 1 km street catchment of a participant’s residence. Other activity-influencing 
built environment factors were measured in terms of density of retail, public transport, and street-level movement 
density, which were modelled from network analyses of through movement of street links within the defined 
catchment. We regressed adiposity indicators of body-mass index (BMI; kg/m²), waist circumference (cm), whole 
body fat (kg), and obesity (WHO criteria of BMI ≥30 kg/m²) on residential density (units per km²), adjusting for 
activity-influencing built environment factors and individual covariates. We also investigated effect modification by 
age, sex, employment status, and physical activity. We used a series of linear continuous and logistic regression 
models and non-linear restricted cubic spline models as appropriate.
Findings Of 502 649 adults in the prospective cohort, 419 562 (83·5%) participants across 22 UK Biobank assessment 
centres met baseline data requirements and were included in the analytic sample. The fitted restricted cubic spline 
adiposity-residential density dose–response curve identified a turning point at a residential density of 1800 residential 
units per km². Below a residential density of 1800 units per km², an increment of 1000 units per km² was positively 
related with adiposity, being associated with higher BMI (β 0·19 kg/m², 95% CI 0·14 to 0·24), waist circumference 
(β 0·41 cm, 0·28 to 0·54), and whole body fat (β 0·40 kg, 0·30 to 0·50), and with increased odds of obesity (odds 
ratio [OR] 1·10, 1·07 to 1·14). Beyond 1800 units per km², residential density had a protective effect on adiposity and 
was associated with lower BMI (β –0·22 kg/m², –0·25 to –0·20), waist circumference (β –0·54 cm, –0·61 to –0·48), 
and whole body fat (β –0·38 kg, –0·43 to –0·33), and with decreased odds of obesity (OR 0·91, 0·90 to 0·93). 
Subgroup analyses identified more pronounced protective effects of residential density among individuals who were 
younger, female, in employment, and accumulating higher levels of physical activity, except in the case of whole 
body fat, for which the protective effects were stronger in men.
Interpretation Housing-level policy related to the optimisation of healthy density in cities might be a potential 
upstream-level public health intervention towards the minimisation and offsetting of obesity; however, further 
research based on accumulated prospective data is necessary for evidencing specific pathways. The findings might 
mean that governments, such as the UK Government, who are attempting to prevent suburban densification by, for 
example, prohibiting the subdivision of single lot housing and the conversion of domestic gardens to housing lots, 
will potentially have the effect of inhibiting the conversion of suburbs into more healthy places to live.

Introduction
Cities are experiencing rapid urban growth driven by 
land-use changes, demographic shifts, and socio-
economic development, resulting in new public health 
challenges.1,2 Obesity has emerged as a global pandemic;3 
excessive adiposity being an important risk factor for 
morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes as well as 
for cardiovascular disease and cancer.4–6 The residential 
built environment has been shown to be one of the first 
causes of obesity.7–9 A systematic review of 132 articles 
concluded that neighbourhoods with high residential 
density, street intersections, and services were associated 
with lower risks of obesity.10
Housing is the fundamental component of a city’s built 
environment and residential density, expressed as the 
number of residential units per residential acre, constitutes

one of the simplest proxies of urban densification. Specific 
residential density profiles have carrying capacities to 
support particular levels of health-influencing land uses 
and services in their neighbourhood. As such, optimisation 
of residential density profiles to make them capable of 
supporting 
health-promoting 
infrastructures 
and 
behaviour via the allocation of housing stocks in developing 
cities and via retrofitting in fully developed cities is 
intrinsic to healthy urban living. Increased residential 
density has been hypothesised to support compact mixed-
use urban development, enhancing street-level physical 
accessibility and connectivity to employment and service 
destinations. Increased residential density is also thought 
to be associated with reduced private vehicle-miles 
travelled and an increased frequency of active travel and 
physical activity.11–13 The protective effects of optimum 
urban density on obesity have been reported in previous 
studies through direct density metrics14,15 and through 
more composite indicators of urban sprawl.16,17
With the global effect of urban densification, more 
specifically, the pervasive effect of the built environment 
on health, the evidence for the identification of the 
optimum residential density in relation to obesity is a 
current priority. No studies on the dose–response 
relationship between residential density and adiposity 
have been done so far that adjust for all other activity-
influencing built environment factors to identify optimum 
density levels for guiding healthy housing policies. 
Furthermore, most studies use census-defined aggregate 
data, are relatively small scale, and are done in low-density 
settings within relatively homogeneous environments.
To establish robust evidence of the links between 
residential density and obesity, we assessed a large and 
diverse population sample for residential density and 
various indicators of adiposity. We modelled objective 
measures of residential density and activity-influencing 
built environment at an individual level of analysis to 
identify optimum levels of residential density for 
sustaining healthy weight.
Methods
Study population
For this full-data, cross-sectional analysis, we obtained 
data from the UK Biobank, a prospective population 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and 
Google/Google Scholar databases for studies and reports 
published in English between Jan 1, 2003, and May 15, 2017, 
using terms including “residential/housing density”, “urban 
density”, “built environment”, and “walkability”; and body mass 
index”, “physical activity”, “obesity”, and “adiposity”. There is now 
an increasing body of evidence that several measures of high 
urban density, including residential density, retail and service 
density, street-intersection density, and land-use diversity, are all 
associated with lower body-mass index and obesity. Housing is 
the fundamental component of any city’s built environment and 
residential density is a key parameter around which land uses and 
services that affect health are planned and developed. The 
evidence for identifying the optimum residential density in 
relation to obesity has been far from compelling. Very few studies 
have been done examining the associations between housing 
unit density and adiposity. Previous studies have mostly used 
aggregate-level, census-defined data with limited reliability. In 
some of the studies, residential density only constitutes one 
component of composite indicators of sprawl and walkability, 
and a dose–response relationship cannot be established. Most of 
the studies so far have been small scale, in low-density settings, 
and within relatively homogeneous environments, generating 
limited statistical power. As we build and retrofit our cities, there 
is an increasing necessity to examine the dose–response 
relationship between residential density and adiposity to identify 
optimum density environments for sustaining healthy weight.
Added value of this study
The study analysed a high-quality dataset of unprecedented size 
(>419 000 individuals across 22 UK cities) and diversity, both in 
terms of population characteristics and environmental exposures. 
The study included highly characterised built environment data 
with objectively measured housing unit density, street-level 
movement density, and density of activity-influencing 
destinations measured at individual level. The study uses 
objective measures of body-mass index, waist circumference, and 
whole body fat as indicators of adiposity. These design features 
enabled analyses with exceptional detail and statistical rigour. Our 
study is the first to have systematically investigated non-linear 
associations across the continuum of residential density and to 
examine effect modification (by age, sex, employment status, 
and levels of physical activity). The association of residential 
density and adiposity has been shown to be curvilinear, with the 
dose–response curve detecting a turning point at 1800 residential 
units per km² and the findings being consistent across all three 
measures of adiposity and robust to adjustments. Below 
1800 housing units per km², higher residential density was 
associated with higher adiposity, whereas above 1800 units 
per km² the associations were protective.
Implications of all the available evidence
Housing unit density is independently associated with adiposity. 
The curvilinear dose–response curve of residential density and 
adiposity, with an identified turning point at a density of 
1800 residential units per km², might have important public 
health consequences—especially in the identification of 
parameters for residential density associated with low adiposity, 
thereby guiding evidence-based policy related to densification 
as an upstream obesity prevention intervention. Further 
longitudinal evidence is needed to identify potential pathways 
and thereby effectively guide policy.

cohort of 502 649 adults aged 37–73 years (99·9% aged 
between 40–69 years) at recruitment. Participants were 
selected from the National Health Service patient register 
and resided within a 25 mile radius of one of the 
22 assessment centres. The baseline examination 
(2006–10) 
included 
detailed 
questionnaires 
on 
sociodemographics, lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and 
medical 
history; 
anthropometric 
measurements; 
biosampling (blood, urine, and saliva); imaging; cognitive 
function; and hospital-related outcomes.18 Details of the 
UK Biobank study protocol, including the scientific 
rationale and study design, can be found elsewhere.19
UK Biobank received ethical approvals from the North 
West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee, the 
Community Health Index Advisory Group, the Patient 
Information Advisory Group, and the National Health 
Service National Research Ethics Service.
Data on adiposity outcomes, sociodemographics, and 
related covariates were collected at baseline (2006–10), 
whereas individual-level built environment exposures 
were assessed towards the end of the baseline phase (2010).
Obesity indicators
Conventional measures of body-mass index (BMI) 
in kg/m², waist circumference in cm, and whole body fat in 
kg constituted the primary indicators of adiposity. They 
were assessed as per UK Biobank’s standard protocol for 
anthropometric measurements.19,20 Additionally, WHO’s 
definition of obesity as BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher was 
used. Standing height (cm) was measured with a Seca 202 
device and waist circumference (cm) with a Wessex non-
stretchable sprung tape. Weight and whole body fat 
mass (kg) were measured using electrical bio-impedance 
with the Tanita BC-418 MA body-composition analyser. 
BMI was derived by dividing weight (kg) by the square of 
standing height (m²).
Exposure assessment: dwelling environment
Built environment data were derived from the UK Biobank 
Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBUMP). UKBUMP 
comprises a set of urban objectively assessed metrics of 
density, design, and accessibility to quantify health-
influencing environmental exposures within predefined 
catchments of each participant’s geocoded dwelling 
address. In reference to each Biobank participant’s 
dwelling location, multiple health-influencing and activity-
influencing built environment metrics were developed 
through a series of Geographic Information System-based 
spatial and network analyses of the UK Ordnance Survey 
spatial database and other national-level datasets. The 
methods are detailed elsewhere.21 These built environment 
metrics of UKBUMP were previously piloted in the 
Caerphilly Prospective study22 and were used in the 
obesity-risk–built-environment study23 within the UK 
Biobank.
We modelled density metrics from the UK-wide 
AddressBase Premium data of Ordnance Survey, which 
comprised approximately 36 million valid address point 
features of 550 different land-use classifications. 
Residential density (units per km²) was defined as the 
number of housing units, including detached, semi-
detached, terraced, and self-contained flats within a street 
catchment of 1 km of a participant’s geocoded dwelling. 
We had tested multiple neighbourhoods as a part of a 
previous sensitivity analysis with pilot data and chose the 
criterion of a 1 km network catchment for land-use 
density variables corresponding to a 10 min walk from 
the geocoded dwellings.22 The criterion also corresponds 
well with a-priori evidence on functional neighbourhoods 
in previous built-environment–adiposity studies.14
Other activity-influencing, built-environment density 
variables statistically controlled for included exposure to 
retail outlets and public transport (bus stops and train 
stations), expressed as the density (number per km²) 
within the 1 km home neighbourhood. A graphical metric 
of “betweenness centrality” was used as a proxy for street-
level movement density, expressed in terms of the 
underlying morphology and design of street network, and 
modelled through network analyses24 of the Ordnance 
Survey Integrated Transport Network database, which 
comprises 5 million street links within a 50 km radius of 
each of the UK Biobank assessment centres. Movement 
density within an 800 m street network catchment of a 
participant’s dwelling was expressed as the simulated 
counts of movement along each street link adjoining a 
participant’s dwelling given its relative position in the 
network and its topological connectivity with all other 
links in the network.21,22 Our choice of 800 m corresponded 
to a network activity space equivalent to a 10 min walk and 
was found to be correlated with walking25 and obesity.23 
Movement density or “betweenness” of any street link (x) 
in a graph of a number of links (N) can be defined as: 
In this formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry 
is the set of links within a defined radius (800 m in this 
case) from y; L(y) and L(z) are length of links y and z, 
respectively; and Pz is the proportion of link z within the 
defined radius.
The origin-destination (OD) function is defined as:

Covariates
The addition of study covariates was theoretically informed 
from a-priori research evidence on the links between 
obesity 
and 
sociodemographic, 
lifestyle, 
and 
environmental factors. Sociodemographic covariates 
comprised age, sex, employment status, and education. 
Employment status was expressed as a 3-level factor 
(employed; retired; and unemployed, home maker, or 
other). Self-report education was coded as a 5-level factor 
(no qualification; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs [school 
certificate]; A levels or AS levels [high school certificate]; 
NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; 
and college or university degree). Among the lifestyle-level 
factors, vehicle ownership was categorised as none, one, 
two, and more than two, whereas housing tenure was 
modelled as a 3-level factor (own outright, own with 
mortgage, and rented). Processed meat intake was 
included as a dietary variable expressed as never, up to 
once a week, two to four times a week, more than 
four times a week. In a subsample of 60 694 participants, 
we obtained data on dietary energy intake (in kJ) from the 
24 h diet recall questionnaire.26 Intake was calculated from 
food and beverage consumption yesterday, excluding any 
supplements. Smoking was coded as a 3-level factor 
(never, previous, or current). Family history of disease was 
derived from history of mother’s illness, coded as a 3-level 
variable (none; heart or cerebrovascular disease; or 
cancer). Self-reported medication use for cholesterol, 
blood pressure, or diabetes, or use of exogenous hormones 
was coded as a 4-level variable (none; use of medication 
for cholesterol; use of medication for hypertension; 
insulin-use, hormone replacement, or contraceptive pills; 
and medicine for multiple morbidities). Neighbourhood 
deprivation (expressed in terms of Townsend score) was 
derived from postcode of residence and categorised into 
quintiles. Physical activity behaviour, expressed in 
metabolic equivalent of task (MET) h/week, was derived 
from the self-reported International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire short form and was computed as the sum 
of weekly walking, moderate physical activity, and vigorous 
physical activity components.27 Physical activity data across 
all the three activity components were available for 
331 814 participants.
Statistical analysis
For this cross-sectional analysis, a systematic multilayered 
analysis protocol was pursued. Separate linear models 
were fitted for each of the adiposity outcomes using the 
full data. BMI, waist circumference, and whole body fat 
mass were treated as continuous outcomes, and odds of 
obesity (in reference to non-obese: BMI <30 kg/m²) was 
modelled as a binary outcome. Residential density acted as 
a continuous linear predictor in our models. We estimated 
average effects of 1000 units per km² (10 units per ha) 
increments in residential density (which is also equivalent 
to approximately 1 IQR) on adiposity outcomes. The initial 
model building exercise involved sequential introduction 
of covariates and assessment of collinearity and fit statistic. 
Model 1 included sociodemographic and lifestyle level 
variables of age, sex, education, employment status, vehicle 
ownership, housing tenureship, smoking status, processed 
meat intake, mother’s illness, and medication use, and 
health-influencing built environment density variables of 
density of retail outlets, public transport, and street-level 
walking density. In model 2, neighbourhood-level 
deprivation was introduced. Model 3 further controlled for 
physical activity.
As a second step, we repeated these analyses using 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) models to examine non-
linearity in the associations between residential density 
and adiposity, with a restricted spline basis for residential 
density. Harrell’s knots were placed at equal percentiles 
of the data on the basis of a series of prior iterations, 
with 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 knots along the residential density 
spline. Respective goodness-of-fit by Akaike information 
criteria were compared to produce the most parsimonious 
model.28 The fitted RCS curve showed the variation of 
adiposity in relation to the residential density continuum. 
The mfxrcspline command in Stata was further used to 
generate marginal effect plots of first derivative or slope 
of the adiposity function with respect to residential 
density. The marginal effect plots determined the so-
called turning point in the association. Linear models 
were then fitted piecewise on either side of the identified 
turning point.
Finally, 
effect 
modification 
was 
examined 
by 
sequentially introducing interaction terms between the 
residential density spline basis and four variables (age, 
sex, employment status, and physical activity behaviour), 
adjusting for all other factors.
For each point estimate, two-tailed 95% CIs estimated 
by bootstrapping are presented. Stata 14 was used for all 
analyses.
Role of the funding source
The study was done using UK Biobank resources. The 
funders and UK Biobank participants did not participate 
in developing the research questions, outcome measures, 
and environmental measures of the present study. They 
had no role in the study design, modelling, data analysis, 
data interpretation, or writing of the report. CS, CW, and 
JG had full access to all the data in the study, take 
responsibility for the integrity of the data and the 
accuracy of the data analysis, and had final responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of 502 649 adults in the prospective cohort, 419 562 (83·5%) 
participants across 22 UK Biobank assessment centres had 
valid baseline data on BMI, waist circumference, body fat, 
residential density, and other built environment densities, 
and were included in the analytic sample (table 1). The 
three markers of adiposity (BMI, waist circumference, and 
whole body fat) used as outcome measures in respective

models 
were 
positively 
correlated 
with 
Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient ranging from 0·65 to 0·88. 
A summary of residential density and other built 
environment exposures is presented in table 2. The mean 
duration of residence was 17·4 years.
Overall, an inverse linear association between 
residential density and obesity was found (table 3). 
Collinearity remained low, with the variance inflation 
factor lying in the range of 1·2 and 1·9. For the fully 
controlled model, a 1000 dwelling units per km² 
increment within a 1 km dwelling catchment was 
associated with lower adiposity across the four indicators 
of BMI, waist circumference, whole body fat, and obesity 
(table 3).
Goodness-of fit tests identified models with three knots 
as parsimonious fits for the adiposity outcomes. The 
variance inflation factor remained between 1·2 and 2·2. 
The fitted RCS models of adiposity-residential density 
dose–response are shown in figure 1. A clear obesogenic 
asymptote corresponding to the turning point (change in 
direction of the slope) was consistently seen at a 
residential density of about 1800 units per km² for all the 
three measures of adiposity. Fully adjusted piece-wise 
models developed on either side of the detected turning 
point are presented in table 4 (see the appendix for full 
results). Below a residential density of 1800 units per 
km², an increment of 1000 units per km² was associated 
with higher BMI (β 0·19 kg/m², 95% CI 0·14 to 0·24), 
waist circumference (β 0·41 cm, 0·28 to 0·54), and whole 
body fat (β 0·40 kg, 0·30 to 0·50), and with increased 
odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1·10, 1·07 to 1·14). Above 
1800 units per km², residential density had a protective 
effect across all the markers of adiposity, being beneficially 
associated with BMI (β –0·22 kg/m², –0·25 to –0·20), 
waist circumference (β –0·54 cm, –0·61 to –0·48), and 
whole body fat (β –0·38 kg, –0·43 to –0·33), and with 
decreased odds of obesity (OR 0·91, 0·90 to 0·93).
As a sensitivity analysis, we further examined the 
relation between physical activity and residential density 
by rerunning the RCS model with log-transformed 
physical activity (figure 2), adjusting for all other 
variables. We also estimated the odds of reporting less 
than the 7·5 MET h/week activity (cutoff corresponding 
to evidenced health benefits29) either side of the identified 
turning point in the adiposity–density relationship. The 
OR of reporting low physical activity per 1000 units 
per km² increment in residential density was 1·14 
(95% CI 1·09–1·19) for a density of 1800 units per km² or 
less, and 0·95 (0·94–0·97) for a density greater than 
1800 units per km².
To examine the effects of residential density among 
participants who are not obese but at risk of obesity, we 
excluded obese participants from the analyses and 
modelled the odds of being overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m² 
and <30 kg/m²) in reference to the healthy weight 
(BMI <25 kg/m²) category. We found a slight attenuation 
in the effects per 1000 units per km² increment in 
residential density. The OR for overweight was 
1·04 (95% CI 1·01–1·07) for residential densities of 
1800 units per km² or less, and 0·95 (0·93–0·96) for 
densities greater than 1800 units per km².
We also tested the effects of additionally controlling for 
dietary energy intake in a subsample (n=49 981) for whom 
calorific data were available. Effect estimates remained

consistently significant, being slightly modified in the 
case of waist circumference and whole body fat (in 
reference to the models over the full data; appendix).
From an urban planning perspective, UK policy guide-
lines consider densities below 3000 units per km² 
as inefficient use of land and encourage housing 
development to have densities of 3000–5000 units 
per km².30 As a sensitivity analysis to further interpret our 
findings in relation to prevailing residential densification 
scenario, we created an additional cutoff point at 3200 units 
per km² (32 units per ha) and obtained piecewise effect 
estimates in the density ranges 1800–3200 and more than 
3200 units per km². This cutoff point represents the mean 
residential 
density 
surrounding 
newly 
developed 
residential units over the period 2014–16.31 The associations 
were protective within the density range 1800–3200 units 
per km² for both BMI (β –0·13 kg/m², 95% CI –0·21 to –0·05) 
and obesity (OR 0·98, 0·94 to 1·02; table 5). However, a 
more pronounced beneficial effect was seen beyond the 
density of 3200 units per km² for BMI (β –0·17 kg/m², 
–0·21 to –0·12) and obesity (OR 0·92, 0·90 to 0·94). 
Similar trends were seen in the cases of waist circumference 
and whole body fat (table 5).
Interaction terms were introduced to examine 
modification by age, sex, employment status, and physical 
activity (figure 3, appendix). Effects on adiposity of 
increasing residential density were greater in younger 
age groups, women, employed people, and people who 
are more physically active (≥50 MET h/week), with a 
pinteraction of less than 0·01 in each case. The results in the 
case of whole body fat suggested a more pronounced 
protective effect in men than in women. The mean whole 
body fat was also higher in women (26·9 kg [SD 10·0]) 
than in men (22·3 kg [SD 8·2]).
High adiposity might be associated with self-selection 
and migration to low density areas. As a further 
sensitivity analysis, adiposity was correlated with density 
according to high (>10 years), medium (3–10 years), and 
low (<3 years) duration of residence. No differences in 
the association were found between these subgroups.
Discussion
Using objective measures of the built environment, in a 
large and diverse population sample, we have shown the 
association of residential density and adiposity to be 
curvilinear, suggesting a turning point at a residential 
density of 1800 units per km². This finding was consistent 
across all three measures of adiposity, with stronger 
associations being found among people who are younger, 
female, employed, and accumulating higher levels of 
physical activity.
Overall, our results suggest that high residential density 
was significantly and independently associated with lower 
adiposity outcomes. These results are consistent with a

few mostly small-scale studies on the topic. In a study14 of 
10 878 participants residing in a low-density environment 
in Atlanta, GA, USA, significant negative correlation was 
found between residential density and BMI and distance 
walked in men. Density was expressed in people per acre 
within census block group. Another large-scale Canadian 
study15 involving 3·78 million participants from Toronto 
and 1·63 million from Vancouver15 found a protective 
association between residential density and BMI. Their 
density measure was similar to the present study’s and 
the reported effect estimates for BMI were slightly lower 
for Toronto (at –0·05 kg/m²) but higher for Vancouver (at 
–0·30 kg/m²). Another small-scale ecological study32 of 
2375 adolescents from Nanjing, China, found that 
participants residing in the highest density tertile had 
2·17 times higher odds of being overweight compared 
with participants in the lowest tertile. However, this was 
an ecological study with a poorer resolution-density 
measure (expressed in terms of number of residents per 
km² within districts) for children. With respect to physical 
activity, a 2016 multicountry study13 involving 6822 adults 
across 14 cities reported a consistent positive association 
between net residential density and moderate-to-vigorous-
intensity physical activity.
None of the previous residential density–adiposity 
studies investigated non-linearity and associations 
stratified across density profiles. In this regard, our 
findings are important in principle and in practice. In 
principle, the findings show the value of a large, high-
quality health dataset and detailed environmental metrics 
to identify environmental determinants of chronic 
disease. In practice, the curvilinear association of 
residential density with adiposity identifies a turning 
point with public health consequences, providing a 
metric for the estimation of the effect of housing policy 
and urban planning on adiposity.
In a low-residential-density setting of 1800 units 
per km² or less, the positive association between density 
and adiposity might point to a low density suburban 
sprawl effect. Typically, the left end of the curve reflects 
semi-urban neighbourhoods that facilitate walkability 
and physical activity via access to private outdoor spaces 
in the form of larger residential gardens33 and enhanced 
exposures to salutogenic green and open amenities.34 
The density nearing the turning point of the RCS curve 
(at 1800 units per km²) might be a proxy of areas 
experiencing suburban sprawl. The positive associations 
of suburban sprawl with obesity16,17 and inadequate 
physical activity35 are well established, primarily on 
account of sedentary lifestyles, including increased 
vehicle-miles travelled to employment centres and 
decreased activity levels. Our physical activity analysis 
supports this finding with higher odds of reporting less 
than 7·5 MET h/week of physical activity. Above 
1800 units per km², increasing density had a protective 
effect on adiposity. This density range corresponds to 
urban suburbs, compact inner suburbs, and city centres,

which are well evolved and designed to accommodate 
densification with additional supporting infrastructures 
in the form of retail, employment centres, pedestrian 
facilities, and other attractive destinations. These urban 
design features could promote increased walkability and 
physical activity. The physical activity model corroborated 
this hypothesis, finding lower odds of reporting less than 
7·5 MET h/week of physical activity in this density range. 
The observed associations in these medium-to-high 
density regions might point to a physical activity-related 
mechanism, with the residential exposures acting as a 
proxy of the degree of walkability and activity friendliness 
of a neighbourhood. Further evidence based on 
accumulated longitudinal data are needed to conclusively 
verify such a causal assumption. We also note that fitted 
RCS curves can be applied with confidence to the UK 
context but might not be valid in other countries. These 
models, when calibrated in the USA and Australia would 
probably lie along the left of our turning point of 
1800 units per km² because, apart from the most densely 
populated parts, densities tend to be below this figure in 
these countries (the USA has an average residential 
density of 1200 units per km² and Australia of 
1000 residential units per km²).
Although present UK housing density averages 
2300 dwellings per km², the mean density around dwelling 
addresses newly allocated in 2013–14 was 3100 units 
per km², and 3200 units per km² for 2014–16.31 From an 
urban health policy perspective, our models suggest a 
more pronounced protective effect beyond the range of 
3200 units per km² (compared with 1800–3200 units 
per km²), supporting the policy towards healthy suburban 
densification. As a recommendation for practice, for dense 
and compact environments to become active environments, 
planners need to design them as multifunction urban 
spaces rather than monofunction suburban spaces.1,36
In view of the potentially significant benefits of healthy 
density environments on weight outcomes, understanding 
underlying pathways merits further investigation for 
effective policy making. First, high residential density is 
synonymous with compactness, greater access to 
destinations, and walkability, and thus active travel. 
Positive associations with healthy weight have been 
reported for walkability37 and active commuting.38 A 
physical activity-based pathway of energy expenditure and 
corresponding obesity reduction is plausible in view of the 
evidenced activity-promoting effects of housing density 
mentioned previously.13 Physical activity is related to 
adiposity via its role in influencing levels of individual 
energy expenditures.39 Although we were not able to 
directly test for mediation, our RCS model for physical 
activity found that higher residential density (more than 
2000 units per km²) had beneficial effects on accumulated 
weekly activity, whereas the interaction models found that 
the protective effects of density on adiposity were more 
pronounced among the highly active participants 
(>50 MET h/week). Second, a highly compact dense 
residential environment might act as a proxy for enhanced 
community social capital and support. The intangible 
stress-relieving potential of centrality, accessibility, and 
social capital needs to be further examined in view of their 
protective effects on obesity.40 Third, high residential 
density, after adjusting for all other built environment 
factors, might also represent well designed environments 
shielding exposures to stressors related to proximity 
to roads, and having greater provisions for recreational

activity spaces such as greenspace. The obesogenic 
potential of air quality and noise pollution41–43 is well 
established, and so are the protective effects of green 
access.23
Limitations originate from the use of a cross-sectional 
and observational study design, designs used by most 
studies examining associations between health and 
environmental exposures. The cross-sectional design 
prevented causal inference. We could not take into account 
the effect of self-selection, with high adiposity attributed to 
people moving into areas of low residential density. To 
address this potential limitation, we examined the 
association of density with adiposity stratified by duration 
of residence and detected no differences between duration 
groups; however, reverse causation cannot be ruled out. 
Another limitation of cross-sectional data is that they 
might not reflect the long-term effect of an exposure. 
However, a mean duration of residence of 17·5 years 
suggests a cohort with fairly stable residential histories. 
Future studies should use accumulated longitudinal data 
to model changes in health in relation to changes in the 
built environment. Similarly, as accumulated follow-up 
data become available in the UK Biobank, other designs, 
such as the effect of migration from one density

environment to another, might also be considered for a 
small subsample of participants moving houses.
Large-scale data also pose some challenges. Temporal 
mismatch between assessment of outcomes and 
covariates and measurement of exposures was inevitable. 
The model outcomes and covariates were assessed 
during the study’s baseline period (2006–10), whereas 
the built environment was measured in 2010. This 
temporal mismatch was unlikely to have significantly 
affected our findings because the built environment 
typically changes slowly in the UK. The issue of inferring 
small effects (often encountered in environment–health 
studies) with caution in big data statistical analyses must 
be stated. Our data also deciphered significant differences 
among population subgroups. We followed a detailed 
multilayered statistical modelling framework. In addition 
to preliminary analyses using the full data, subsequent 
models were developed by stratifying the data by density 
profiles and meaningful population characteristics, 
thereby obtaining a range of reliable estimates with 
respect to different chunks of data.
The risk of residual confounding exists, as in all 
observational data. Apart from the built environment, the 
study did not consider other environmental attributes, 
including land-use heterogeneity, quality of transit 
services, green quality, and recreation potential. We could 
not study how these effects might have moderated the 
associations. The study did not have data on weight-
influencing intestinal microbiota and calorific intake data 
were available for a subset of participants. The intangible 
effects of prevailing urban and environmental policy and 
demographic contexts also need to be controlled for to 
enhance generalisability in future studies.
The range of residential density available to the analysis 
was representative of the UK’s semi-urban and urban 
environments. However, the findings should not be 
extrapolated beyond this range for other socially and 
culturally different contexts. Cities in the UK, as with most 
European cities, do not have the very high-density 
developments commonly encountered in Asian population 
centres, such as in Hong Kong, mainland China, and 
India, and it’s likely that in these high-density areas other 
turning points would be encountered that are endemic to 
such density extremes. We emphasise that comparable 
country-specific evidence from other countries (with 
different contexts) needs to be reproduced by other 
research groups and is likely to produce different curves, 
but it would help us gain insights for policies regarding 
global healthy densification.
The UK Biobank is an adult cohort (in the age range of 
38–73 years) and the reported findings are not 
generalisable to young adults and children. Additionally, 
the sampling is associated with a healthy volunteer 
selection bias and as such might not be representative 
with respect to the prevalence of obesity and related 
comorbidities. However, in view of the sufficiently 
diverse population and heterogeneity of environmental 
exposures, sample selection is unlikely to have a material 
effect on the associations reported.44,45
Notwithstanding the mentioned limitations, this is the 
first systematic, large-scale analysis examining the 
trajectory of adiposity along the residential density 
continuum after adjusting for a range of other built 
environment factors and covariates and testing for non-
linearity and effect modification. The strengths of the 
study are owed to the use of a high-quality dataset of 
unprecedented size (n>419 000) and diversity (22 cities). 
The UK Biobank data underwent substantial centralised 
quality control. Standardised measurement protocol 
ensured uniformity and reliability of the markers of 
adiposity. In addition to the standard measure of BMI, 
the use of additional markers46 provided a more holistic 
measure of adiposity. A distinctive feature was the use of 
UKBUMP 
built 
environment 
data, 
which 
were 
characterised with objective indicators.46 Reliance on the 
UK-wide Ordnance Survey data meant the density data 
could be measured at the building-unit level within a 
street network catchment, and therefore be representative 
of functional neighbourhoods, rather than at the parcel-
level data within census-defined neighbourhoods, as 
used in all previous studies. Data were analysed at the 
individual level to avoid the modifiable unit area problem 
and the ecological fallacy. These design features have 
provided analyses of exceptional detail and statistical 
power, enabling a multilayered analysis to detect non-
linear associations across the density continuum, and 
the implementation of informative subgroup analyses. 
Although longitudinal data are required to confirm these 
findings, they are not dissimilar to previous reports. The 
inverse relationships between residential density and 
obesity in sprawling suburbs has been shown 
elsewhere,16,17 as have differential effects according to sex47 
and age48 on adiposity.
With increasing demand for urban housing, alongside 
controlling 
sprawl 
and 
enhancing 
infrastructure, 
sustaining healthy communities is a major planning 
challenge. This large-scale study provides evidence that 
informs the planning equation in terms of identifying 
parameters for residential density that might sustain 
healthy weight. Our study consistently found that beyond 
a threshold of 1800 units per km², residential density had 
a protective effect on adiposity outcomes, suggesting that 
the relentless trend towards suburban densification can 
plausibly be a public health opportunity to be embraced. 
The inference that residential density is a determinant of 
adiposity in the general population, and that this 
association can be specified with sufficient precision to 
inform policy in support of environments promoting 
healthy weight, is a conclusion of sub 
stantial public 
health significance that requires careful consideration by 
urban health planners and policy makers. Further 
longitudinal studies based on accumulated data are 
needed to measure changes in adiposity in relation to 
changes in density, and to infer causality and thereby
