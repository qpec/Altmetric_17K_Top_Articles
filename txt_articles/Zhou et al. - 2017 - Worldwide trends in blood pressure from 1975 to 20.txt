Worldwide trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015: 
a pooled analysis of 1479 population-based measurement 
studies with 19·1 million participants
NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)*
Summary
Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. 
We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and 
number of people with, raised blood pressure, defi
 ned as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic 
blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.
Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had 
measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends 
from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 
200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the 
increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.
Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardised 
mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7–128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg 
(121·0–123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9–79·5) for men and 
76·7 mm Hg (75·9–77·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% 
(21·4–27·1) in men and 20·1% (17·8–22·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure 
decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacifi
 c countries, moving these countries 
from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also 
decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central 
Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in 
high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, 
south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia 
had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some 
middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure 
increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income 
countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net eff
 ect of increase due to 
population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specifi
 c prevalence.
Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from 
high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while 
blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

Introduction
Raised blood pressure is the leading global risk factor for 
cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease.1 One 
of the global non-communicable disease (NCD) targets 
adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2013 is to lower 
the prevalence of raised blood pressure, defi
 ned as systolic 
blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood 
pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, by 25% compared with 
its 2010 level by 2025.2 Consistent global information is 
needed to understand how countries compare on blood 
pressure levels and trends, and where interventions to 
curtail the rise in blood pressure are most needed.
The prevalence of raised blood pressure measures the 
number of high-risk people irrespective of treatment 
status, and is the indicator used in the global NCD target. 
However, blood pressure has a log-linear association with 
cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease that 
continues well below the threshold for raised blood 
pressure, and treatment provides similar proportional risk 
reductions irrespective of pretreatment blood pressure.3,4 
Trends in mean population blood pressure measure how 
blood pressure distribution has shifted over time.
We pooled population-based data to estimate national, 
regional, and global trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean

systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and in the 
prevalence of raised blood pressure, for adults aged 
18 years and older in 200 countries and territories. We 
also estimated trends in the number of adults with raised 
blood pressure, and calculated how much these trends 
are attributable to changes in prevalence versus changes 
in population size and age structure.
Methods
Study design and data sources
For this pooled analysis, we included data collected from 
samples of a national, subnational (ie, covering one or 
more subnational regions), or community (one or a small 
number 
of 
communities) 
population 
in 
which 
participants’ blood pressure had been measured. Our 
methods for identifying and accessing data sources are 
described in the appendix (pp 2–6). When a study 
measured blood pressure more than once in participants 
(1053 [86%] of 1220 studies for which information about 
number of measurements was available), we discarded 
the fi
 rst measurement, and used the average of the 
remainder.
292 (20%) of the 1479 data sources we analysed 
(2298 [16%] of 14 391 age-sex-study-specifi
 c data points) 
that were from a previous global pooling5 or extracted 
from publications did not have data on one or more of 
our primary outcomes. We used regressions to convert 
available data in these sources to the missing primary 
outcomes because the various blood pressure outcomes 
are correlated.6 Details of conversion (or so-called 
cross-walking) regressions and their coeffi
  cients are 
presented in the appendix (pp 7, 8, 44–152).
Statistical analysis
The statistical model used to estimate means and 
prevalence by country, year, and age is described in detail 
in a statistical paper and related substantive papers.5,7,8 In 
summary, we organised countries into 21 regions, mainly 
on the basis of geography and national income, which 
we further aggregated into nine “super-regions” 
(appendix pp 14, 15). The model had a hierarchical 
structure in which estimates for each country and year 
were informed by its own data, if available, and by data 
from other years in the same country and from other 
countries, especially countries in the same region with 
data for similar time periods. The hierarchical structure 
shares information to a greater extent when data are non-
existent or weakly informative (eg, have a small sample 
size or are not national), and to a lesser extent for data-
rich countries and regions.
The model incorporated non-linear time trends and age 
patterns. It allowed the age association of blood pressure 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) for articles published in 
English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, French, or 
Farsi between Jan 1, 1950, and Feb 19, 2014, using the search 
terms (“blood pressure”[Mesh:NoExp] OR 
“hypertension”[Mesh:NoExp]) AND (“Humans”[Mesh]). 
We screened articles according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria described in the appendix.
Some studies, including the MONICA Project, have reported 
on blood pressure change or trends in one or more countries. 
Two previous global analyses, done more than a decade ago, 
pooled data from diff
 erent countries and reported mean 
systolic blood pressure or prevalence of hypertension in the 
year 2000 for the world and its major regions. A more recent 
analysis published in 2016 pooled 135 studies to estimate 
global and regional hypertension prevalence in 2000 and 
2010, but did not report changes in mean blood pressure, 
which refl
 ect shifts in the population distribution of blood 
pressure. None of these studies provided consistent estimates 
for all countries or accounted for the fact that the data used 
were collected in diff
 erent years. The only analysis of trends at 
the country level reported mean systolic blood pressure from 
1980 to 2008 but did not report mean diastolic blood 
pressure or prevalence of raised blood pressure, which is of 
clinical relevance and needed for monitoring progress towards 
the global target.
Added value of this study
This study provides the most complete picture of trends in 
adult blood pressure for all countries in the world with the 
longest observation period of any global blood pressure study 
to our knowledge, and includes trends in mean diastolic blood 
pressure and prevalence of raised blood pressure, which were 
not included in previous studies and are of clinical, public 
health, and health systems signifi
 cance. We also estimated 
trends in the number of adults with raised blood pressure, and 
how much these trends are driven by changes in prevalence 
versus population size and age structure.
Implications of all the available evidence
During the past four decades, the highest levels of blood 
pressure worldwide have shifted from high-income countries to 
low-income and middle-income countries in south Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa, while blood pressure has been persistently 
high in central and eastern Europe. The global target of reducing 
raised blood pressure prevalence by 25% by 2025 is unlikely to be 
achieved in these regions. The number of people with raised 
blood pressure has risen worldwide, with the increase happening 
mainly in low-income and middle-income countries. 
Population-based interventions throughout the life-course and 
pharmacological treatment for people with high absolute risk or 
people with substantially raised blood pressure should be a part 
of any eff
 ort to address the global burden of non-communicable 
diseases, especially in the poorest countries.

to vary across populations, and the rise in means and 
prevalence over age to be steeper where blood pressure is 
higher.9,10 The model accounted for the possibility that 
blood pressure in subnational and community studies 
might systematically diff
 er from nationally representative 
ones, and might also have larger variation than in national 
studies; the model also accounted for rural–urban 
diff
 erences in blood pressure, and used it to adjust 
rural-only and urban-only studies. The statistical model 
included covariates that help predict blood pressure, 
including mean number of years of education, proportion 
of national population living in urban areas, and a 
summary measure of availability of diff
 erent food types 
for human consumption (appendix pp 9, 10).
We fi
 tted the statistical model with the Markov chain 
Monte Carlo algorithm, and obtained 5000 post-burn-in 
samples from the posterior distribution of model 
parameters, which were in turn used to obtain 
the posterior distributions of primary outcomes. The 
reported 
credible 
intervals 
(CrI) 
represent 
the 
2·5th to 97·5th percentiles of the posterior distributions. 
Each primary outcome was analysed separately, and all 
analyses were done separately by sex to allow blood 
pressure, its trends, and age associations to diff
 er among 
outcomes and between men and women.
We calculated mean change in mean blood pressure 
and the prevalence of raised blood pressure across the 
41 years of analysis (reported as change per decade). We 
also report the posterior probability (PP) that an estimated 
trend represents a true increase or decrease. We generated 
age-standardised estimates using the WHO standard 
population,11 by taking weighted means of age–sex-specifi
 c 
estimates, with use of age weights from the standard 
population. We tested how our statistical model predicted 
mean blood pressure and the prevalence of raised blood 
pressure when a country-year did not have data 
(appendix pp 11–13), which showed that the model 
performed well in its predictive validity.
We calculated the contribution of population growth 
and ageing to the change in the number of adults with 
raised blood pressure by fi
 xing age-specifi
 c prevalence at 
its 1975 levels while allowing age-specifi
 c population to 
change as it did. We calculated the contribution of change 
in prevalence by fi
 xing age-specifi
 c population at its 
1975 level while allowing age-specifi
 c prevalence to 
change as it did. The interaction between the two 
contributions is the residual change in the number of 
adults with raised blood pressure after accounting for the 
two forementioned components.

Results
We included 1479 population-based measurement surveys 
and studies, with 19·1 million participants aged 18 years 
and older for whom blood pressure was measured. We 
had at least one data source for 174 (87%) of the 
200 countries we made estimates for, covering 97·5% of 
the world’s population in 2015 (appendix pp 193, 194), and 
at least two data sources for 122 (61%) countries. Of these 
1479 sources, 517 (35%) were from national samples, 
249 (17%) covered one or more subnational regions, and 
the remaining 713 (48%) were from one or a small number 
of communities. Regionally, data availability ranged 
from 0·83 data sources per country in central Africa 
to 37 sources per country in high-income Asia Pacifi
 c. 
543 (37%) data sources were from years before 1995 and 
another 936 (63%) were from 1995 and later.
Globally, age-standardised adult mean systolic blood 
pressure remained virtually unchanged from 1975 to 
2015 in men (126·6 mm Hg [95% CrI 124·0 to 129·3] 
in 1975 and 127·0 mm Hg [125·7 to 128·3] in 2015; an 
increase of 0·07 mm Hg per decade [–0·59 to 0·74]; PP of 
being a true increasing trend is 0·5808) and decreased 
slightly in women (123·9 mm Hg [121·3 to 126·6] in 1975 
and 122·3 mm Hg [121·0 to 123·6] in 2015; a decrease of 
0·47 mm Hg per decade [–0·20 to 1·15]; PP=0·9210; 
fi
 gure 1). Trends in age-standardised mean diastolic 
blood pressure, which was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9 to 79·5) for 
men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·9 to 77·6) for women in 2015, 
were similar (fi
 gure 2).
Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure 
decreased substantially during these four decades in 
high-income western and high-income Asia Pacifi
 c 
super-regions, moving these two super-regions from 
being among those with the highest blood pressure 
in 1975 to the lowest in 2015 (fi
 gures 1, 2). The largest 
decrease in mean systolic blood pressure, which occurred 
in high-income Asia Pacifi
 c, was 3·2 mm Hg per decade 
(95% CrI 2·4–3·9) for women and 2·4 mm Hg per decade 
(1·6–3·1) for men (PP>0·9999). The largest decrease in 
mean diastolic blood pressure, which was in the 
high-income western super-region, was 1·8 mm Hg 
per decade (1·4–2·3) for women and 1·5 mm Hg 
per decade (1·0–1·9) for men (PP>0·9999). Mean systolic 
blood pressure also seems to have decreased in women 
in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, 
and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these 
super-regions had larger uncertainty than those in 
high-income 
super-regions; 
mean 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure showed a similar, but less pronounced, decrease 
in these super-regions (fi
 gures 1, 2). Little or no change 
in mean systolic or mean diastolic blood pressure 
occurred in men in these super-regions.
By contrast with these decreases, mean systolic blood 
pressure might have increased in men and women in 
east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and 
sub-Saharan Africa, with a similar trend in mean diastolic

132 mm Hg. Countries with the lowest mean diastolic 
blood pressure were Peru and several high-income 
countries 
including 
Canada, 
Australia, 
the 
UK, 
New Zealand, and Singapore. Diastolic blood pressure 
was high throughout central and eastern Europe, 
south Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, with age-standardised 
mean surpassing 85 mm Hg in Lithuanian men. Mean 
systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure were 
correlated across countries (correlation coeffi
  cients of 
0·69 for men and 0·86 for women in 2015). However, 
men and women in countries in south Asia, central and 
eastern Europe, and central Asia, Middle East, and 
north Africa had higher diastolic blood pressure than 
expected on the basis of their systolic blood pressure and 
the systolic blood pressure–diastolic blood pressure 
association (fi
 gure 5); the opposite was seen for men and 
women in Oceania.
South Korea, Canada, the USA, Peru, the UK, 
Singapore and Australia had the lowest prevalence of 
raised blood pressure in 2015 for both sexes, with an age-
standardised prevalence of less than 13% in women and 
less than 19% in men (fi
 gure 4). At the other extreme, 
age-standardised prevalence surpassed 35% in men in 
some countries in central and eastern Europe including 
Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Slovenia; 
prevalence was more than 33% in women in a few 
countries in west Africa.
In 2015, men had higher age-standardised mean systolic 
blood pressure than women in most countries (fi
 gure 6). 
Men also had higher diastolic blood pressure and 
prevalence of raised blood pressure than women in most 
countries, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the sex 
pattern was reversed in most countries, and a few countries 
in Oceania and Asia. The male–female diff
 erences in 
age-standardised means and prevalence were virtually all 
due to diff
 erences in people younger than 50 years; among 
people aged 50 years and older, on average men and 
women had similar mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and prevalence of raised blood pressure, with 
countries divided into some with lower and others with 
higher male blood pressure (results not shown). The 
male–female diff
 erence in blood pressure in 2015 was 
largest in high-income countries and countries in central 
and eastern Europe. Compared with 1975, the male excess 
in mean blood pressure increased in high-income 
super-regions, central and eastern Europe, Latin America 
and the Caribbean, and central Asia, Middle East, and 
north Africa but decreased (and in the case of diastolic 
blood pressure reversed) in sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, 
and south Asia (results not shown).
The estimated number of adults with raised blood 
pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion 
in 2015 (fi
 gure 7), comprising 597 million men and 
529 million women. At the global level, this increase was 
attributable to population growth and ageing, off
 set 
partly by falling age-specifi
 c prevalence. In the 
high-income western super-region, the absolute number 
of people with raised blood pressure has decreased 
steadily since 1975 because the steep decrease in 
prevalence outweighed the eff
 ect of population growth 
and ageing. Nonetheless, 141 million adults in the 
constituent countries had raised blood pressure in 2015. 
Similarly, in central and eastern Europe, the number of 
people with raised blood pressure peaked in 1988 and 
went below its 1975 levels in 2002, driven by decreasing 
prevalence. In high-income Asia Pacifi
 c, the number of 
people with raised blood pressure has decreased since 
2007 but is still higher than it was in 1975. In other

low-income and middle-income super-regions, the 
number of people with raised blood pressure is still 
increasing. In Latin America and the Caribbean and 
central Asia, the Middle East, and north Africa, this rise 
is a net eff
 ect of increase due to population growth and 
ageing and decrease due to lower age-specifi
 c prevalence. 
In Oceania, south Asia, east and southeast Asia, and 
sub-Saharan Africa, three quarters or more of the rise is 
attributable to population growth and ageing, and the 
remainder is due to an increase in prevalence (fi
 gure 7). 
In 2015, 258 million (23%) of the 1·13 billion adults with 
raised blood pressure lived in south Asia (199 million of 
whom in India) and another 235 million (21%) lived in 
east Asia (226 million of whom in China).
Discussion
Raised blood pressure has transitioned from a risk factor 
largely aff
 ecting high-income countries to one that is 
now most prevalent in low-income countries in 
south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, while being a 
persistent health issue in central and eastern Europe. 
Although favourable trends continue in high-income 
countries, and might also be happening in some middle-
income regions, other low-income and middle-income 
regions are aff
 ected by rising, or at best stable but high, 
blood pressure. The number of people with raised blood 
pressure in the world has increased by 90% during these 
four decades, with the majority of the increase occurring 
in low-income and middle-income countries, and largely 
driven by the growth and ageing of the population.
At the global level, we estimated lower mean systolic 
blood pressure in the 1980s, and hence a smaller 
reduction over time, than reported by Danaei and 
colleagues,5 possibly because we had more data than 
their earlier analysis. At the regional level, the additional 
data from low-income and middle-income countries 
included in our analysis gave more confi
 dence to our 
fi
 nding of a rise in mean systolic blood pressure in Asia 
and sub-Saharan Africa than the trends estimated by 
Danaei and colleagues.5 Our results cannot be directly 
compared with the studies by Kearney and colleagues12 
and Mills and colleagues13 because these studies included 
people who used antihypertensive medicines when 
calculating prevalence. Despite this diff
 erence in the 
reported metric, the reports are broadly consistent in 
identifying central and eastern Europe, central Asia, and 
sub-Saharan Africa as regions at the highest risk. Lawes 
and colleagues14 also reported the highest mean systolic 
blood pressure in central and eastern Europe and central 
Asia, as we did, but unlike our study they found lower 
mean systolic blood pressure in south Asia than in most 
regions. This diff
 erence is largely because blood pressure 
in south Asia has increased since 2000, the reporting 
year of Lawes and colleagues’ study; the diff
 erence might 
also be attributable to us having substantially more data 
from south Asia than Lawes and colleagues.
The estimated decrease in blood pressure in high-
income countries in our analysis is consistent with 
fi
 ndings of country studies and the MONICA Project.15–34 
Fewer studies have analysed blood pressure trends in 
low-income and middle-income countries than in high-
income countries. The available studies suggest 
reductions in blood pressure in central and possibly 
eastern Europe,35–38 the Middle East and north Africa,39 
and Latin America,40 and increases in south Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa,41–43 and possibly in east and 
southeast Asia.44,45
We also found that the prevalence of raised blood 
pressure decreased in some regions where mean blood 
pressure did not change, and remained unchanged 
where the mean increased. Some other studies32,46 have 
also found a larger decrease in the upper tail of blood

pressure distribution than in its mean. In the MONICA 
Project,16 the upper percentiles of blood pressure 
distribution decreased more than the mean in some 
communities but not in others. Although the changing 
shape of the distribution is partly due to antihypertensive 
drugs, it has also occurred in younger adult ages when 
medication use is uncommon.32,46 To investigate the 
drivers of the changing distribution would require 
historical data on multiple determinants of blood 
pressure throughout the life course. Finally, our fi
 nding 
of a higher mean blood pressure in men than in women, 
especially in premenopause ages, is consistent with 
previous studies.47
The strengths of our study include its scope in making 
consistent and comparable estimates of trends in both 
mean and raised blood pressure over four decades for all 
the countries in the world. We used a large amount of 
population-based data covering countries in which more 
than 97% of the global adult population lives. We used 
only data from studies that had measured blood pressure 
to avoid bias in self-reported data. We analysed data 
according to a consistent protocol, and NCD Risk Factor 
Collaboration members verifi
 ed the characteristics of 
data from each country through repeated checks. We 
pooled data using a statistical model that took into 
account the epidemiological features of blood pressure, 
including non-linear time trends and age associations. 
Our statistical model used all available data while giving 
more weight to national data than to subnational and 
community sources.
Similar to all global analyses, our study is aff
 ected by 
some limitations. First, some countries had no or few 
data sources, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa and 
the Caribbean. Estimates for these countries relied 
mostly or entirely on the statistical model. The absence 
or scarcity of data is refl
 ected in wider uncertainty 
intervals of our estimates for these countries and regions, 
emphasising the importance of national NCD-oriented 
surveillance. Second, we had fewer data sources for the 
years before 1990 in most regions, which was refl
 ected in 
the larger uncertainty for these years. In a sensitivity 
analysis, we analysed trends starting in 1990 with an 
identical model, and compared the post-1990 estimates 
with estimates from the main analysis (which included 
data from 1975 onwards). The estimates were very similar 
with correlation coeffi
  cients between the estimates from 
the main and sensitivity analyses being 0·94 or higher in 
1990 and 0·98 or higher in 2015 (appendix pp 197, 198). 
Third, only 53% of sources included people older than 
70 years, necessitating the use of data in these older ages 
elsewhere to infer an age pattern and make estimates in 
older ages. In view of the ageing trends throughout the 
world, inclusion of older people in health surveys should 
be emphasised. Fourth, our model accounted and 
adjusted for systematic and random errors in subnational 
and community data. However, the adjustments are not 
country-specifi
 c because estimation of country-specifi
 c 
adjustments would require national and subnational or 
community data in the same country and year. Therefore, 
the correction for each single country remains uncertain. 
Fifth, although data held by NCD Risk Factor 
Collaboration members were analysed to provide all the 
primary outcomes, individual participant data could not 
be accessed for 20% of data sources. To overcome this 
issue, we systematically used the reported metrics to 
estimate all of our primary outcomes; the cross-walking 
regressions used for this purpose had good predictive 
accuracy but increased the uncertainty of our estimates. 
Sixth, over time, standard mercury sphygmomanometers 
have been replaced by random-zero sphygmomanometers 
and more recently digital oscillometric devices in health 
surveys. Similarly, studies diff
 ered on whether they used 
multiple cuff
  sizes or one cuff
  size. We note that the 
eff
 ect of measurement device and protocol on population 
mean and prevalence depends on the circumstances of 
each survey. For example, an automated digital device 
with a standard cuff
 , although not the traditional gold-
standard in a clinical setting, avoids observer bias and 
increases compliance, and possibly even response rate, 
compared with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer 
with multiple cuff
 s.48 Nonetheless, measurements from 
diff
 erent devices are not fully comparable,49–51 which 
might have aff
 ected the estimated trends. When we 
included device type as study-level covariate in our 
statistical 
model, 
studies 
using 
random-zero 
sphygmomanometers, which were used commonly in 
the late 1980s and 1990s, had lower mean blood pressure 
(by about 4·5 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and by 
about 3 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure) and 
prevalence of raised blood pressure than studies using 
standard mercury sphygmomanometers. The mean 
diff
 erence between studies using digital devices and 
mercury sphygmomanometers was about 2 mm Hg for 
systolic blood pressure and about 0·2 mm Hg for 
diastolic blood pressure. Finally, blood pressure had been 
measured only once in some of our data sources. In 
those sources with multiple measurements, the median 
diff
 erence between the fi
 rst measurement and the 
average of subsequent ones was 1·5 mm Hg for systolic 
blood pressure and 0·0 mm Hg for diastolic blood 
pressure, suggesting that mean blood pressure and 
prevalence of raised blood pressure might be slightly 
overestimated in some of our sources.
Blood pressure is a multifaceted trait, aff
 ected by 
nutrition, environment, and behaviour throughout the 
life course, including fetal and early childhood nutrition 
and growth,52 adiposity,53,54 specifi
 c components of diet, 
especially sodium and potassium intakes,53 alcohol 
use,54,55 smoking,56 physical activity,54 air pollution,57 lead,58 
noise,59 psychosocial stress, and the use of blood pressure 
lowering 
drugs. 
Changes 
in 
risk 
factors 
and 
improvements in detection and treatment of raised blood 
pressure have, at least partly, resulted in the decrease in 
blood pressure in high-income countries, although the

decrease seems to have begun before or in the absence of 
specifi
 c interventions for risk factors and scale-up of 
treatment, and is only partly accounted for by the 
measured risk factors and treatment.17,19–21,34,35,46,60–70 In 
particular, the decrease in high-income and some 
middle-income 
countries 
has 
happened 
despite 
increasing body-mass index.71
The partly unexplained nature of these favourable 
trends necessitates speculation about their drivers, which 
might include unmeasured improvements in early 
childhood nutrition and year-round availability of fruits 
and vegetables, which might increase the amount and 
regularity of their consumption. Our results show that 
similar decreasing trends in mean blood pressure and 
prevalence of raised blood pressure might have begun in 
some middle-income regions, although at a slower rate 
than trends in high-income regions, but not in the 
poorest populations, including those in south Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa, and in populations aff
 ected by major 
social and economic changes in central and eastern 
Europe. These populations have low consumption of 
fresh fruits72 and, in many cases, high consumption 
of salt.73 South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the 
highest prevalence of maternal undernutrition,71,74 
preterm and small-for-gestational age births, and child 
undernutrition;75,76 they have also had some of the 
smallest gains in adult height,74 which is associated with 
lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Many cases of 
raised blood pressure go untreated in these regions.13,77 
The absence of these favourable determinants of low 
blood pressure, coupled with rising body-mass index,71 
might be causing the increase in mean blood pressure 
in these regions. Therefore, if governments and 
multinational organisations are to address the large and 
inequitable burden of cardiovascular diseases and kidney 
disease associated with high blood pressure, they need to 
take a multifaceted approach using both population-
based strategies throughout the life course and individual 
lifestyle management and treatment through primary 
care systems.78
