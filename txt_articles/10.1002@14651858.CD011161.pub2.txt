Background
’Keratinocyte cancer’ is now the preferred term for the most commonly identified skin cancers basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), which were previously commonly categorised as non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Keratinocyte
cancer (KC) represents about 95% of malignant skin tumours. Lifestyle changes have led to increased exposure to the sun, which has,
in turn, led to a significant increase of new cases of KC, with a worldwide annual incidence of between 3% and 8%. The successful use
of preventive measures could mean a significant reduction in the resources used by health systems, compared with the high cost of the
treatment of these conditions. At present, there is no information about the quality of the evidence for the use of these sun protection
strategies with an assessment of their benefits and risks.
Objectives
To assess the effects of sun protection strategies (i.e. sunscreen and barrier methods) for preventing keratinocyte cancer (that is, basal
cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the skin) in the general population.
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase,
and LILACS. We also searched five trial registries and the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of preventive strategies for keratinocyte cancer, such as physical barriers and
sunscreens, in the general population (children and adults), which may provide information about benefits and adverse events related to
the use of solar protection measures. We did not include trials focused on educational strategies to prevent KC or preventive strategies
in high-risk groups. Our prespecified primary outcomes were BCC or cSCC confirmed clinically or by histopathology at any follow-
up and adverse events.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for eligibility using Early Review Organizing Software (EROS). Similarly, two
review authors independently used predesigned data collection forms to extract information from the original study reports about
the participants, methods of randomisation, blinding, comparisons of interest, number of participants originally randomised by arm,
follow-up losses, and outcomes, and they assessed the risk of bias. We resolved any disagreement by consulting a third author and
contacted trial investigators of identified trials to obtain additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected
by Cochrane.
Main results
We included one RCT (factorial design) that randomised 1621 participants.
This study compared the daily application of sunscreen compared with discretionary use of sunscreen, with or without beta-carotene
administration, in the general population. The study was undertaken in Australia; 55.2% of participants had fair skin, and they were
monitored for 4.5 years for new cases of BCC or cSCC assessed by histopathology. We found this study to be at low risk of bias for
domains such as allocation, blinding, and incomplete outcome data. However, we found multiple unclear risks related to other biases,
including an unclear assessment of possible interactions between the effects of the different interventions evaluated (that is, sunscreen
and beta-carotene). We found no difference in terms of the number of participants developing BCC (n = 1621; risk ratio (RR) 1.03,
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.43) or cSCC (n = 1621; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.54) when comparing daily application of
sunscreen with discretionary use, even when analyses were restricted to groups without beta-carotene supplementation. This evidence
was of low quality, which means that there is some certainty that future studies may alter our confidence in this evidence.
We reported adverse events in a narrative way and included skin irritation or contact allergy.
We identified no studies that evaluated other sun protection measures, such as the use of sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, or hats,
or seeking the shade when outdoors.
Authors’ conclusions
In this review, we assessed the effect of solar protection in preventing the occurrence of new cases of keratinocyte cancer. We only found
one study that was suitable for inclusion. This was a study of sunscreens, so we were unable to assess any other forms of sun protection.
The study addressed our prespecified primary outcomes, but not most of our secondary outcomes. We were unable to demonstrate
from the available evidence whether sunscreen was effective for the prevention of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma (cSCC).
Our certainty in the evidence was low because there was a lack of histopathological confirmation of BCC or cSCC in a significant
percentage of cases. Amongst other sources of bias, it was not clear whether the study authors had assessed any interaction effects
between the sunscreen and beta-carotene interventions. We think that further research is very likely to have an important impact on
our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

Sun protection (including sunscreens) to prevent basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
What is the aim of this review?
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if using topical sunscreen and physical barrier methods (such as sun-protective
clothing, hats, sunglasses, and the active search for shade when outdoors) compared with no specific precautionary activity prevented
the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the skin in adults and children.
What was studied in this review?
Keratinocyte cancer (BCC and cSCC of the skin) is the most commonly identified type of skin cancer. The main risk is exposure
to ultraviolet radiation, which is a component of sunlight. Prevention has become an important way to manage this cancer, so it is
important to assess the effectiveness of methods used to prevent keratinocyte cancer in the general population. In this review, we assessed
the effects of using topical sunscreen and physical barrier methods (such as sun-protective clothing, hats, sunglasses, and the active
search for shade when outdoors) compared with no specific precautionary interventions aimed at preventing the development of BCC
and cSCC in adults and children.

 We searched the medical literature up to May 2016 for randomised controlled trials that evaluated preventive strategies. We found
only one study suitable for inclusion. This study compared the daily application of sunscreen (with or without beta-carotene, which
is a precursor of vitamin A) compared with the occasional use of sunscreen (with or without beta-carotene) in the general population,
without restriction by gender or age. The study was undertaken in Australia, where 1621 participants, 55% of them with fair skin,
were monitored for 4.5 years for new cases of BCC or cSCC assessed by histopathology (which is a method used to detect cancerous
cells under the microscope).
What are the main results of this review?
We found no difference between the number of people who developed BCC or cSCC in the two groups over the time period of the
trial. So, there did not seem to be a difference in applying sunscreen daily compared with using it occasionally.
Key messages
Our one included study was a study of sunscreens, so we were unable to assess any other forms of sun protection.
We identified no studies that evaluated other sun protection measures, such as the use of sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, or hats,
or seeking the shade when outdoors.
We did not find evidence for the effectiveness of daily sunscreen for preventing BCC or cSCC compared with the occasional use of
sunscreen. The certainty of the evidence was low, which means that future studies may alter this result.
Side effects from the sunscreen used with or without the addition of beta-carotene included a low percentage of cases of contact allergy
and skin irritation.
How up to date is this review?
This review included studies identified up to May 2016.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
¹Downgraded by one level due to other potential sources of bias, including an unclear assessment of interaction between the
effects of the different interventions evaluated (that is, sunscreen and beta-carotene).
²Downgraded by one level due to indirectness because it is not clear whether these results are applicable to the wider
population. Also, these results included cases not confirmed histologically (by clinical examination only).

Description of the condition
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell car-
cinoma (cSCC) were previously commonly categorised as non-
melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), but now the preferred term ’ker-
atinocyte cancer’ is used (Albert2003). Throughout the review, we
have used this term when we refer to BCC and cSCC collectively.
Keratinocyte cancer (KC) is a term that includes BCC and cSCC
of the skin. Together, KC represents about 95% of all skin can-
cers (Dubas 2013). Since 1960, changes in lifestyle have led to
increased exposure to the sun, which has in turn led to a sig-
nificant increase of new cases of KC, with a worldwide annual
incidence of between 3% and 8% (Glass 1989; Ricotti 2009).
Around 1.2 million keratinocyte cancers are diagnosed per year in
the USA (Ricotti 2009). In Australia, the estimated incidence is
400 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (Johnson 1992; Stern 2010). In
Colombia, an equatorial country with a predominant population
of phototype III (skin type), a significant increase in KC figures has
been documented, rising from 23 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in
2003 to 41 cases per 100,000 in 2007 (Sánchez 2011). In Europe,
there is an increasing trend in the incidence of keratinocyte can-
cer, with exceptional cases such as Switzerland where the highest
rate of cSCC has been documented in the whole continent, rising
from 14.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 1978 to 28.9 cases per
100,000 inhabitants in 1997 (Lomas 2012).
The action of ultraviolet radiation on the keratinocyte layer of
cells in the epidermis is the common site of the development of
cSCC and BCC lesions (Preston 1992). The mechanism involves
damage to DNA and its repair system, specifically the formation
of pyrimidine dimers (the bases that are part of the structure of
DNA), as well as mutations of p53 tumour suppressor genes (
Preston 1992). Basal cell carcinoma is characterised by a slow rate
of growth and extremely low probability of metastasis; however,
this condition can compromise wide areas of tissue, cartilage, and
bone and produce local damage (Rubin 2005). By contrast, the
potential for distant metastasis of cSCC is greater, with up to 5%
of lesions metastasising within five years (Miller 2010).
The diagnosis of KC is based on clinical examination of the lesion
and confirmation by histopathology (Motley 2003; Telfer 2008),
and is classified into two large groups: basal cell carcinomas and
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (Gloster 1996). The Amer-
ican Cancer Society reports that around 50% to 65% of KCs are
classified as BCC, and 20% to 25%, as cSCC (Kornek 2013).
Basal cell carcinoma is a tumour of epithelial (outer layer of the
skin) origin, which rarely metastasises (ranging from an incidence
of 0.0028% to 0.1%) (Glass 1989), but has significant disease
burden and considerable costs (Green 2010; Sánchez 2011; Stern
2010). The main risk factor for developing BCC is exposure to
ultraviolet radiation (UV) (Corona 2001). Other factors, such as
sun exposure during work, skin cancer family history, personal
history of sunburn, presence of actinic keratoses, and having skin
phototypes I to III, have also been associated with its onset (Lear
1997; Sánchez 2012). By contrast, cSCC is a locally invasive ma-
lignant tumour with a great potential to spread to distant parts of
the body (Lansbury 2010). Presence of cSCC has been associated
with different factors, such as chronic exposure to UV radiation,
history of burns and occupational exposure, inherited skin con-
ditions (albinism or xeroderma pigmentosum), and human papil-
loma virus infection, among other factors (Green 2010; Sánchez
2013).
Description of the intervention
Prevention is an important component in the management of KC
and includes measures to avoid and reduce the consequences of
exposure to the sun (Kornek 2013). These measures are broadly
divided into sunscreens and physical barriers.
Sunscreen agents include all the products designed to reduce con-
tact between the skin and UV radiation (Mulliken 2012). The
ability of sunscreens to prevent the damage related to UV radi-
ation is measured by the sun protection factor (SPF) (Mulliken
2012). Briefly, the SPF is defined as the time needed to produce
sunburn when the sunscreen is applied to the skin, divided by
the time needed to cause sunburn when nothing is applied to the
skin (Schalka 2011). The sun protection factor is accepted as the
worldwide standard for the assessment of protection against the
erythemogenic (reddening) effects of UVB and UVA radiation
(Schalka 2011). The effectiveness of a sunscreen is dependent on
such characteristics as specific ingredients, general formulation,
water-resistance, time over which the solar filter has been exposed
to the sun, and the quantity of sunscreen applied (Saki 2012).
Similarly, numerous studies have confirmed that instances of sun-
burn throughout life increase the risk of developing skin cancer
(Sánchez 2012; Sánchez 2013; Zanetti 1996). UVB generates di-
rect changes in DNA (Ravanat 2001). So, sunscreens that block
UVB radiation would potentially increase the time of sun exposure
without sunburn and, in theory, reduce the risk of developing skin
cancer. The level of protection against UVB can be quantified by
measuring the MDE (minimum dose of radiation that can pro-
duce erythema, which is reddening of the skin) and the SPF. The
SPF is the result of the relationship between the minimal erythema
dose (MED) with and without protection (MDE with sunscreen/
MDE without sunscreen) (Jansen 2013a). Then, the question is
to define the SPF that is able to decrease the risk of DNA damage
resulting from sunburn and thus prevent the occurrence of new
cases of KC.
Physical barriers can also help in preventing and minimising the
harmful effects of UV radiation (Gasparro 1998; Latha 2013).
Some authors have proposed that such measures could be more ef-
fective than sunscreen to prevent skin cancer (Linos 2011). Phys-
ical barriers include photoprotection with special clothes made of
different materials, which provide protection against both UVB

 and UVA radiation (Diaz 2013). Polyester is the material with the
highest ultraviolet light absorption capacity, while cotton has the
lowest capacity (Diaz 2013). Hats can provide protection to the
head and neck depending on their size and shape and the mate-
rials from which they are made (Klostermann 2013). Sunglasses,
depending on their size, shape, and ability to block UV radiation,
are effective in protecting the periorbital region, usually on the
lower eyelid and inner edge, which are both areas highly exposed
to solar radiation (Klostermann 2013). Finally, the active search
for shade may be from a physical barrier, such as from a roof or the
use of an umbrella when outdoors. These could provide significant
protection against UV radiation without modifying exposure to
visible light (Burnett 2012; Cooley 2013).
How the intervention might work
Sun protection strategies, such as those previously mentioned, act
by blocking or diminishing the contact of UVA and UVB radia-
tion with the skin, thus, avoiding DNA damage and the develop-
ment of keratinocyte cancer (Sambandan 2011). Although there
is a larger proportion of UVA (wavelength = 320 nm to 400 nm)
radiation in the solar spectrum, UVB radiation (290 nm to 320
nm) causes most of the acute and chronic biological damage to
the skin (Cole 2001). Any strategy suitable for wide implementa-
tion should protect against both types of radiation (Latha 2013).
An intervention, such as beta-carotene supplementation, has been
evaluated in its role as a protective agent of the skin, for example,
in the prevention of sunburn (Kopcke 2008).
Why it is important to do this review
Ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor in the development of KC
(Lucas 2006), which has an effect on the quality of life of those
with the condition, as well as having serious cost consequences for
countries’ health systems. The use of preventive measures could
mean a significant reduction of the resources used by health sys-
tems compared with the high cost that the treatment of KCs and
their aftermath entails. At present, there is no information about
the evidence for the use of these sun protection strategies with an
assessment of their benefits and harms.
Our review aims to systematically assess the effectiveness and re-
lated adverse events of these protective elements, providing infor-
mation on the possible routes for controlling the increasing inci-
dence of keratinocyte cancer in the general population.
The plans for this review were published as a protocol ’Sun pro-
tection for preventing basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers’
(Sánchez 2014).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled clinical trials that may provide
information about benefits and adverse events related to the use of
solar protection elements, such as physical barriers and sunscreens,
as preventive strategies for keratinocyte cancer.
We did not include trials focused on educational strategies to pre-
vent KC (Langbecker 2014), nor preventive strategies in high-risk
groups (for example, people with actinic keratoses, organ trans-
plant recipients, etc.), because there are other Cochrane Reviews
published or in development that focus on these specific issues
(Bath-Hextall 2007; Morales-Sánchez 2016).
Types of participants
We included trials focused on the general population (children and
adults) without restriction by gender or age. We did not include
trials focusing on special populations (for example, people with
actinic keratoses, organ transplant recipients, etc.).
Types of interventions
Studies included one or more of the following interventions versus
no intervention, placebo, or other interventions.
1. Sunscreens with any sun protection factor (SPF).
2. Wearing hats, sunglasses, and special clothing outdoors.
3. Staying out of the sun (e.g. use of shady places, roofs, and
umbrellas outdoors, etc.).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) confirmed clinically or
histopathologically at any follow-up.
2. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) confirmed
clinically or histopathologically at any follow-up.
3. Adverse events (e.g. dermatitis from sunscreens, acne
secondary to the use of sunscreens, dermatitis from the use of
hats and clothes, vitamin D deficiency from lack of exposure to

 the sun, etc.) reported by a number of participants or
individually.
We have explained our reason for the addition of ’clinical’ to our
two primary outcomes in the Differences between protocol and
review section.
Secondary outcomes
1. Number of self-reported sunburns or skin lesions, defined
by each study, at the end of follow-up.
2. Actinic or solar keratoses at any follow-up.
3. Total hours of ultraviolet radiation exposure at the end of
follow-up.
4. Total hours outdoors in peak exposure times at the end of
follow-up.
5. Minimal erythema dose (MED) at the end of follow-up.
6. Participant’s compliance with preventive strategies at the
end of the trial.
Search methods for identification of studies
We aimed to identify all relevant randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) regardless of language or publication status (published,
unpublished, in press, or in progress).
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases up to 10 May 2016:
• the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register using the
search strategy in Appendix 1;
• the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) 2016, Issue 5, in the Cochrane Library using the
strategy in Appendix 2;
• MEDLINE via Ovid (from 1946) using the strategy in
Appendix 3;
• Embase via Ovid (from 1974) using the strategy in
Appendix 4; and
• LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science
Information database, from 1982) using the strategy in
Appendix 5.
Trial registries
We searched the following trials registries and portals up to 10
May 2016:
• the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (www.controlled-
trials.com);
• the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials
Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov);
• the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (
www.anzctr.org.au);
• the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch); and
• the EU Clinical Trials Register (
www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu).
We used the terms “non melanoma skin cancer”, “basal cell carci-
noma”, “squamous cell carcinoma”, “bowen disease”, and “actinic
keratosis”.
Searching other resources
References from included studies
We checked the bibliographies of included studies for further ref-
erences to relevant trials.
Adverse effects
We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of the
target intervention, but we examined data on adverse effects from
the included study that we identified.
Data collection and analysis
Due to the lack of studies, we were unable to carry out analyses
that we had planned in our protocol. We have explained this in
the Differences between protocol and review section.
Selection of studies
Two review authors (MO and GS) independently selected stud-
ies for eligibility with Early Review Organizing Software (EROS)
(Ciapponi 2011; Glujovsky 2010; Glujovsky 2011). We checked
the titles and abstracts of all of the retrieved studies to determine
if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria previously proposed. We as-
sessed the full texts of identified studies to confirm their final in-
clusion. We resolved all disagreements by involving a third author
(IA-R). We were not blinded to characteristics such as the authors’
names, institutions, or the journal of publication at any stage of
the review. We recorded the reasons for our exclusion of potential
studies in the ’Characteristics of excluded studies’ tables (Higgins
2011).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (CS and JG) used predesigned data collection
forms to retrieve information, such as randomisation methods,
blinding of participants and personnel, comparisons, number of
participants by arm, and follow-up losses, from the original study
in an independent way (Higgins 2011). We tested this format prior
to extended use. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with
a third review author (JN). We entered extracted data into Review
Manager 5 for further analyses (Review Manager 2012).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two authors (ARH and IA-R) used the criteria outlined in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to in-
dependently assess the risk of bias of the included trial (Higgins
2011). We took six domains into consideration: random sequence
generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, per-
sonnel, and outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selec-
tive reporting; and other biases. We resolved any disagreement by
discussion with a third author (GS). We assessed the likely magni-
tude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely
to impact on the findings (Higgins 2011). We summarised the
information in a ’Risk of bias’ table, which is an extension of the
’Characteristics of included studies’ table. We planned to explore
the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity anal-
yses (see the Sensitivity analysis section), but we did not perform
this analysis because of the number of studies included.
Measures of treatment effect
We presented results of dichotomous outcomes (such as BCC and
cSCC) as summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), as well as the number needed to treat for an additional
harmful outcome (NNTH) as an absolute measure of harm, and
NNTH as the reciprocal of risk differences (RD) (McQuay 1998).
We alsoplannedthatforcontinuousoutcomes(such asthe number
of sunburns and total hours of ultraviolet radiation exposure), we
would report the mean difference (MD) with its corresponding
95% CI, but these outcomes were not reported (see Differences
between protocol and review section).
Unit of analysis issues
We did not expect to find any unit of analysis issues as we did not
expect to find cross-over studies. In the case of within-participant
trials (e.g. split face) related to the effectiveness of the sunscreen,
we planned to report the results in a narrative way and not include
this information in planned meta-analyses. However, we found
that information about these kinds of tumours can be expressed as
number of participants affected, as well as total number of tumours
by groups.
Dealing with missing data
We planned to retrieve levelsof attrition of information if possible.
We planned to explore, by using sensitivity analyses, the impact
of trials with high levels of attrition in the assessment of treatment
effects. If possible, we carried out analyses, as far as possible on
an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis (i.e. we attempted to include in
the analyses all randomised participants in the denominator of the
assessed groups).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We planned to investigate heterogeneity in the first instance
through visual examination of measures of treatment effect forest
plots. Main sources of heterogeneity could include skin phototype,
duration of follow-up, and gender and age groups. We planned to
evaluate statistical heterogeneity by means of the I² statistic. This
statistic estimates the percentage of total variation across included
trials due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (Higgins
2003; Higgins 2011). We planned to explore heterogeneity if the
I² statistic was greater than 30%, and in cases where the I² statistic
was more than 80%, we did not plan to present pooled results.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to create funnel plots of the primary outcomes to
provide a visual assessment of reporting bias if at least 10 trials
were available (Higgins 2011; Sterne 2011). Also, we planned to
use two tests to assess asymmetry in the corresponding funnel plot:
the regression asymmetry test (Egger 1997) and the adjusted rank
correlation test (Begg 1994). However, we did not perform this
analysis because of the number of studies included.
Data synthesis
We planned to summarise the findings using random-effects mod-
els with the DerSimonian and Laird method and carry out statis-
tical analyses using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2012).
We planned not to present a pooled result if we identified sub-
stantial heterogeneity (I² statistic was greater than 80%). Also, we
planned to conduct a trial sequential analysis (TSA), which com-
bines an information size calculation (cumulated sample sizes of
included trials) for meta-analysis with the threshold of statistical
significance. We planned to conduct a TSA using the TSA soft-
ware on binary outcomes (Brok 2009; Pogue 1997; Pogue 1998;
Thorlund 2009; Wetterslev 2008) and apply trial sequential mon-
itoring boundaries according to a heterogeneity-adjusted required
information size, based on an a priori 10% relative risk reduc-
tion (RRR) employing alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20 (CTU 2011;
Thorlund 2011). However, we did not perform these analyses due
to the number of studies included, and we present the results in a
narrative way, with figures to illustrate the main information.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to undertake subgroup analysis and perform interac-
tion tests to check for subgroup differences where this assessment
would be meaningful. For the primary outcomes, we planned to
consider subgroup analyses for the following factors, as appropri-
ate:
• gender;
• age groups (i.e. less than 18 years, 18 to 40 years, 41 to 60
years, greater than 60 years);
• skin phototype (i.e. I, II, III, IV, V, VI);
9

 • hair colour phenotype (i.e. redhead, blonde, black, etc.);
• eye colour phenotype (i.e. blue, green, black, brown, etc.);
• duration at follow-up (less than one year, between one to
two years, between two to five years, more than five years); and
• history of skin cancer or precancerous lesions (personal and
family).
However, we did not perform these analyses because of the number
of studies included (see Differences between protocol and review
section).
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis using those trials
classified as having a low risk of bias (Higgins 2011) in three core
domains: allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and
blinding of outcome assessment. However, we did not perform this
analysis because of the number of studies included (see Differences
between protocol and review section).
’Summary of findings’ tables
We used the guidelines of the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working
Group (Guyatt 2008) to assess the quality of the evidence related
to primary outcomes, and developed a ’Summary of findings’ ta-
ble with the GRADE profiler software. The GRADE system as-
sesses the quality of evidence based on the extent to which users
can be confident that an association reflects the item being eval-
uated (Guyatt 2008). Assessment of the quality of evidence in-
cluded consideration of the risk of bias, heterogeneity, directness
of the evidence, risk of publication bias, and precision of effect esti-
mates (Guyatt 2011; Guyatt 2011a; Guyatt 2011b; Guyatt 2011c;
Guyatt 2011d; Guyatt 2011e; Guyatt 2011f; Guyatt 2011g).

 Included studies
We included one study, which compared daily application of sun-
screen versus discretionary use (mostly for recreational use). We
did not find studies of children or studies comparing sunscreen at
any sun protection factor (SPF) with no intervention or placebo.
Also, we did not identify studies about interventions such as wear-
ing hats, sunglasses, or sun-protective clothing outdoors, or stay-
ing out of the sun (use of shady places, roofs, umbrellas, etc.).
Design
We included one study that randomly assigned 1621 people and
included 1383 with full skin examination in the analysis (see the
Characteristics of included studies section). This study was a ran-
domised 2x2 factorial trial developed in Australia, which evalu-
ated the following four interventions: daily sunscreen and beta-
carotene supplementation (30 mg beta-carotene tablet each day);
daily sunscreen and placebo; discretionary sunscreen and beta-
carotene supplementation (30 mg beta-carotene tablet each day);
and discretionary sunscreen and placebo. The use of placebo cream
alone was considered “unethical”; thus, the daily application of
sunscreen was compared with the discretionary use of sunscreen.
However, the study authors effectively reduced the comparisons
to two by combining the groups (see below).
Participants
Adult participants were selected from a population-based preva-
lence survey of skin cancer conducted in 1986, with 43.7% being
men; the average age was 48.77 years. Fifty-two per cent of the
participants were fair skinned; 18.7% had an occupation that they
carried out mainly outdoors; and 27% had a previous diagnosis of
skin cancer.
Sample size and setting
One thousand two hundred and one eligible residents of Nambour
were randomised to the different groups of this trial. The study
authors presented analysis based on 1383 trial participants who
had full skin examination during the follow-up period. The study
authors estimated that a minimum of 1600 participants needed
to be enrolled to detect a 36% reduction of basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and a 59% reduction of cutaneous squamous cell carci-
noma (cSCC).
Interventions
Four groups were evaluated.
• Participants in group one received instructions for daily use
of SPF 16 sunscreen and a 30 mg beta-carotene tablet to be
taken each day.
• Participants in group two received instructions for daily use
of SPF 16 sunscreen and a 30 mg placebo tablet each day.
The study authors added groups one and two together to obtain
results for all participants with daily administration of SPF 16 sun-
screen (daily sunscreen group: number of participants randomised
= 812).
• Participants in group three received a 30 mg beta-carotene
tablet each day and received instructions to use sunscreen on a
discretionary basis.
• Participants in group four received a 30 mg placebo tablet
each day and received instructions to use sunscreen on a
discretionary basis.
The study authors added groups three and four together to obtain
results for all participants with discretionary administration of SPF
16 sunscreen (non-daily sunscreen group: number of participants
randomised = 809).
One thousand three hundred and eighty-three participants com-
pleted the full follow-up period of 4.5 years (85.3%). We included
the 1621 participants originally allocated to our analysis (inten-
tion-to-treat analysis). Losses by group ranged from 12.3% to
17.1%. The administration of sunscreen on a daily basis involved
the application of a layer of sunscreen to all exposed sites of the
head, neck, arms, and hands every morning.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of our sole included study was the num-
ber of new cases of BCC and cSCC (Green 1999). Secondary
outcomes were change in the prevalence of solar keratosis (as full
body counts and per sunscreen site counts), adverse events (main
reported complaints), and the degree of photoageing. The re-
searchers assessed the participants’ compliance with sunscreen use
every three months by comparing the weight of the sunscreen pro-
vided with the average rate of consumption for a group of non-
participants. Likewise, the use of sunscreen in the control group
was measured through a standard questionnaire delivered annu-
ally. Two follow-up clinics in 1994 (two years after the beginning
of the study) and 1996 (at the end of the study) assessed the par-
ticipants, and all lesions identified at those times were evaluated by
histopathology. Local doctors documented the rest of the lesions
on prespecified cards.
Excluded studies
We excluded 21 studies for reasons reported in the ’Characteristics
of excluded studies’ tables after assessment of the full text of the
12

 report and most frequently because they did not evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of sun protection strategies in the prevention of ker-
atinocyte cancer.
Risk of bias in included studies
We assessed the one included study for risk of bias and reported
the judgments for the individual domains in the ’Risk of bias’ table
(see Figure 2).

 Allocation
Regarding randomisation issues, Green 1999 declared, “A cus-
tomized randomization computer program was used to assign
all attending the baseline study clinics to one of four treatment
groups.” Likewise, regarding allocation concealment, they added,
“The treatment code was known only to the investigator who gen-
erated it and the two people who packaged the tablets for distri-
bution. None of these people had contact with participants.” We
therefore judged these two domains to be at low risk of bias.
Blinding
Regarding blinding of participants, personnel, and assessment of
outcomes, the authors of Green 1999 reported that the treatment
code was known only to the investigator who generated it and to
the two people who packaged the tablets for distribution. None of
these people had contact with participants. Likewise, a single der-
matopathologist histologically examined all clinically diagnosed
skin cancers during these follow-up surveys. Dermatologists in-
volved in the study survey were unaware of the treatment alloca-
tion. We judged these domains at low risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Regarding attrition bias for our primary outcomes, Green 1999
declared: “At the end of the study in year 5, 238 (15%) partici-
pants had withdrawn without a complete skin examination by a
dermatologist in the follow-up period.” The percentage of losses
to follow-up was similar for all groups, and it was the same for
all primary outcomes (group one: 12.37%; group two: 17.15%;
group three: 14.1%; group four: 15.01%). We judged this domain
at low risk of bias.
By contrast, the number of participants lost to follow up was
bigger for actinic keratosis (ranging from 28% to 36%), and the
risk was considered high for this outcome. One thousand three
hundred and eighty-three participants completed the full follow-
up period of 4.5 years, but we included the 1621 participants
originally randomised under intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.
Selective reporting
In a secondary reference, Green 1999 reported the association
between possible predictors of sunscreen use and frequency of
sunscreen application, including general information on variables
such as time outdoors on weekdays in summer and burns during
the trial, but this information was not reported in a sufficient way
to enable analysis. So, we judged this domain to be at unclear risk
of bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We identified other potential sources of bias in the study, includ-
ing an unclear assessment of the interaction between the effects
of the different interventions evaluated (that is, sunscreen and
beta-carotene), an unclear impact of multiple posthoc analyses not
planned a priori (repeated significance testing), and an unclear im-
pact of clinical versus histological diagnosis of keratinocyte can-
cer. We did not consider funding as a source of bias as the Public
Health Research and Development Committee of the National
Health and Medical Research Council of Australia provided fund-
ing.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Daily
application of sunscreen compared with discretionary use for
preventing basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell skin cancers
We only found information from one study comparing the daily
application of sunscreen (in which participants applied a layer of
sunscreen themselves every morning to all uncovered areas on the
head, neck, arms, and hands, reapplying after substantial sweat-
ing, bathing, or extended sun exposure) versus discretionary use
(mostly for recreational use).
For the main analyses, Green 1999 included all participants in
the trial, including those who received beta-carotene tablets. They
combined groups one and two to obtain results for all participants
with daily administration of SPF 16 sunscreen (i.e. those partici-
pants who received instructions for daily use of SPF 16 sunscreen
and a 30 mg beta-carotene tablet to be taken each day, plus those
participants who received instructions for daily use of SPF 16 sun-
screen and a 30 mg placebo tablet each day). These were compared
to all participants (groups three and four) with discretionary ad-
ministration of SPF sunscreen (i.e. those participants who received
a 30 mg beta-carotene tablet each day and received instructions to
use sunscreen on a discretionary basis, plus those participants who
received a 30 mg placebo tablet each day and received instructions
to use sunscreen on a discretionary basis).
For BCC and cSCC, the trial authors provided information for
cases confirmed histopathologically in terms of incidence density
ratios (IDR); these estimates are provided below as supplementary
information. For actinic keratosis (AK), authors combined all le-
sionsonthe whole bodyateach examination(full bodycounts)and
also added all lesions on the sites to which sunscreen was applied
(sunscreen site counts). Also, Green 1999 provided supplementary
analyses for BCC and cSCC excluding participants assigned to
beta-carotene tablets (i.e. groups one and three). However, there
was not enough information about the number of cases per arm
to estimate risk ratios (RR). Information about IDR (which was
the effect measure reported by the study authors) is provided as

 supplementary information.
We present the quality of the evidence in Summary of findings for
the main comparison.
Primary outcomes
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) confirmed clinically or
histopathologically at any follow-up
The incidence of new BCC was similar in the daily-application
group (812 participants randomly assigned) compared with the
discretionary-use group (809 participants randomly assigned) (RR
1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.43; Analysis 1.1).
This evidence was of low quality, which means that there is some
certainty that future studies may alter our confidence in this evi-
dence.
It was reported in a narrative way that the incidence was similar,
even when authors restricted analysis to cases of BCC “that had
been diagnosed histologically”. The study authors also provided
information in terms of IDR when they excluded groups receiving
beta-carotene (that is, the authors excluded groups one and three),
but they did not find differences between groups (IDR 0.96, 95%
CI 0.59 to 1.56).
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) confirmed
clinically or histopathologically at any follow-up
The incidence of new cSCC was similar in the daily-application
group (812 participants randomly assigned) compared with the
discretionary-use group (809 participants randomly assigned) (RR
0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.54; Analysis 1.2). This evidence was of
low quality, which means that there is some certainty that future
studies may alter our confidence in this evidence.
Likewise, the incidence rate of histologically diagnosed cSCC,
based on 40 participants with pathological confirmation, was sim-
ilar in both groups (IDR 0.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.38). The study
authors also provided information in terms of IDR when they
excluded groups receiving beta-carotene (that is, the authors ex-
cluded groups one and three), but they found no differences be-
tween groups (IDR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.77).
Adverse events
In a narrative report, Green 1999 stated that the main complaints
made by the daily sunscreen use group were related to skin irrita-
tion or contact allergy (25 participants out of 812) and skin oili-
ness (10 participants out of 812). This evidence was of low quality,
which means that there is some certainty that future studies may
alter our confidence in this evidence. Adverse events related to the
discretionary-use group were not reported.
Secondary outcomes
We did not find information about the number of self-reported
sunburns or skin lesions, total hours of ultraviolet radiation ex-
posure, total hours outdoors in peak exposure times, or minimal
erythema dose (MED). Our sole included study only reported the
following secondary outcomes.
Actinic or solar keratoses at any follow-up
The rate of change in the total number (full body count) of preva-
lent actinic keratoses between 1994 and 1996 was similar in the
daily-application group (n = 812 participants randomly assigned)
and in the discretionary-use group (n = 809 participants randomly
assigned; 559 participants analysed) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to
1.20; Analysis 1.3).
Participant’s compliance with preventive strategies at the
end of the trial
In a narrative report, Green 1999 stated, “75% of participants
assigned to daily sunscreen use were applying sunscreen to their
neck, arms and hands at least 3 to 4 days a week and those people
not assigned to the sunscreen group were applying sunscreen to
head, neck and arms not at all or no more than 1 or 2 days a week.”
For the daily use group, the median daily weight of sunscreen
applied on average throughout the trial was 1.5 g/d (range 0 to

Summary of main results
In this review, we only identified one study, which evaluated
whether regular daily use of sunscreen in comparison with dis-
cretionary or occasional use prevented new cases of basal cell
carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC),
and our secondary outcome actinic keratoses at follow-up (Green
1999). The study was undertaken in Nambour in South East
Queensland (Australia); the researchers also studied adverse events
and adherence related to the use of sunscreen. They found that sun
protection factor (SPF) 16 sunscreen applied on exposed sites of
the body, such as the head, neck, and upper limbs, every morning
and repeated after heavy sweating or bathing made no difference
in terms of reducing the occurrence of new cases of BCC and
cSCC confirmed or not by histopathology at 4.5 years, in compar-
ison with discretionary use (low-quality evidence; see Summary
16

 of findings for the main comparison). We did not identify studies
comparing the use of sunscreen against no use of sunscreen.
Adverse events associated with the use of sunscreen in the daily
sunscreen use group, such as occasional local reactions, like con-
tact dermatitis; the feeling of oily skin; and interference with per-
spiration, were documented.
We identified no studies that evaluated other sun protection mea-
sures or regimens, such as wearing sun-protective clothing, glasses,
or hats, or seeking the shade when outdoors.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
of sun protection strategies aimed at preventing the development
of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and
actinic keratoses, we found only one study, which was on the use
of sunscreen. Limitations of this study were that it was restricted
to only one SPF (SPF 16); it was in a population at higher risk of
keratinocyte cancer due to the majority of participants having fair
skin (55.2% were fair) and therefore a higher risk of sun damage
and developing keratinocyte cancer (KC); and it did not address
several of the prespecified secondary outcomes planned in our
review.
Our review did not find differences between two sunscreen regi-
mens (daily use versus discretionary use) in terms of the number
of participants with new cases of BCC or cSCC, so to date, avail-
able evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of preventive
strategies for cSCC and BCC is scarce. This result could be at-
tributed to a short period of exposure to sunscreen (4.5 years) and
a limited tracking time. Given the above, it is possible that the
clinical assessment did not last long enough to demonstrate that
a protective effect can reduce the occurrence of BCC.
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma lesions are strongly related to
sun exposure. It is estimated that 90% of these occur in body sites
that are usually exposed to the sun (Miller 2010). Preventing early
stages of carcinogenesis would indicate the benefit of performing
preventive procedures from childhood with a longer follow-up
period (Zelen 1988). The pattern of BCC-causing sun exposure
seems to be different from that of cSCC, because although it is
accepted that ultraviolet exposure (UV) is the main causal factor,
the accurate relationship between the amount, timing, and pattern
of exposure is unknown (i.e. exposure age, number of years, inten-
sity of exposure, etc.) (Roewert-Huber 2007). Although cSCC le-
sions show a higher metastatic profile in comparison with basal cell
carcinoma lesions, there are BCC histologic patterns that might
be locally aggressive without correlation with its metastatic risk
(Roewert-Huber 2007). However, reduced sunlight exposure can
be deleterious for some populations, producing long-term harms
such as vitamin D deficiency and depression, which is a reason
for not recommending reduced exposure to sunlight as a general
measure (Maslin 2014).
The results of this study highlight that there are peculiarities in
populations that could change the estimate of the effect, among
which, phototype, type of radiation, geographic location (altitude
above sea level, ozone layer, and latitude), and the number of
hours spent outdoors are worth noting (Holman 1984). Thus,
the benefits of using sunscreen may vary from one population to
another. Finally, we must emphasise that Green 1999 conducted
an evaluation of effectiveness with only one sun protection factor
(SPF 16) and a once a day application scheme, which today would
be considered inadequate (Pissavini 2013).
Quality of the evidence
The results of this single study suggest that using sunscreen on
a daily basis, compared with discretionary use, does not reduce
the onset of new cases of basal cell or cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma. This evidence was of low quality, which means that
there is some certainty that further research is very likely to have
an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect
and is likely to change the estimate. We downgraded the risk of
bias due to a number of potential risks that had an unclear im-
pact on the results, including an unclear assessment of interaction
between the effects of the different interventions evaluated (that
is, sunscreen and beta-carotene), an unclear impact of multiple
posthoc analyses not planned a priori (repeated significance test-
ing), and an unclear impact of clinical versus histological diagnosis
of keratinocyte cancer. We deemed other considerations such as
inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias as not serious, but
readers should consider these issues when considering the main
results of this trial.
Potential biases in the review process
This review was comprehensive in aiming to identify clinical trials
addressing the issue of the effectiveness and safety of sun protec-
tion measures for the prevention of cSCC and BCC. In general,
we followed most of the strategies recommended by the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011)
regarding identification of relevant studies. However, the number
of references identified was low, demonstrating the poor level of
research at trial level in this area. This is understandable given the
difficulty of long-term population experiments, which are needed
to adequately identify incident cases of KC. Also, the effectiveness
of sun protection measures is often studied in conjunction with
educational strategies to maximise adherence to preventive strate-
gies, but this review did not address the educational aspect.
In this review, we made some changes from the protocol, which
may be sources of bias. We expanded the criteria for confirmation
of BCC and cSCC lesions, because histopathological confirmation
of keratinocyte cancer could be a difficulty in population-based
studies with large sample sizes, and then, clinical confirmation is
17

 more likely to be used. Despite expanding our criteria, we consid-
ered that there was a lack of applicability of our results to a wider
population, so we downgraded for indirectness. This change could
be considered a source of bias in this review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
van der Pols 2006 contained the results of a follow-up study of
the cohort of people participating in the Nambour study eight
years after the cessation of the trial. Including the time of the
trial, a 12-year follow-up was completed. Comparing the group
of participants originally assigned to daily sunscreen use with the
group not assigned to daily sunscreen use, the author found that
sunscreen significantly reduced the incidence of cSCC in both
the number of people affected (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94)
and the number of tumours diagnosed (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to
0.90). However, it was not possible to demonstrate, even during
this monitoring period, that the regular application of sunscreen
could reduce the occurrence of new cases of BCC, which may take
many years to develop (van der Pols 2006). Although our plan
was to assess the development of BCC or cSCC at any follow-up
period, it was clear to us (because of the participants’ compliance
with the preventive strategies) that the information reported in
this study was a follow-up of a cohort of participants who did not
necessarily use sunscreen as planned in the trial.
Bimczok 2007 found that the minimum dose of sunscreen to be
effective was SPF 15, and the minimum amount should be 2 mg/
cm². However, subsequent studies have reported that the general
population applies close to 1 mg/cm², which would affect the
effectiveness of the intervention (Jansen 2013a; Jansen 2013b).
In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recom-
mended the use of sunscreen with a SPF higher than 15, and that
same year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) in the UK published a guide for the prevention of skin
cancer in which it too recommended the use of sunscreen with
a SPF higher than 15 (NICE 2011). Pissavini and collaborators,
who after studying the population’s patterns of sunscreen use and
ultraviolet (UV) exposure, recommended the use of SPF 30, have
recently supplemented these results, given that the effectiveness
of this measure is related to frequency of use and the dose used
(Pissavini 2013).

Implications for practice
In different countries, it has been documented that there has been
a progressive increase in the rates of skin cancer (Lomas 2012;
Sánchez 2011), driving the implementation of strategies that may
help to control this growing phenomenon. The present systematic
review explored the evidence related to the effect of sun protec-
tion measures against the occurrence of new cases of keratinocyte
cancer, but was unable to find evidence for the effectiveness of
sunscreen to prevent the development of basal cell carcinoma le-
sions (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in the
participants (Green 1999).
Implications for research
Despite the fact that well-planned studies need to be performed
to address the main objective of this review, the widespread use of
sunscreen may make it more difficult to run clinical trials where
placebo creams are used as the control. However, other important
questions remain, such as the optimal application frequency and
minimum sun protection factor for the adequate prevention of
cSCC and BCC, as well as the safety of the different sunscreen
brands and their effects when applied to the skin. Future stud-
ies should also include histological confirmation of keratinocyte
cancer (KC) cases, in order to obtain an accurate estimation of
incident cases of cSCC or BCC, as well as the harms and possible
adverse effects related to reduced sun exposure, such as vitamin D
deficiency and depression.
Another difficulty is the proper monitoring of participants, with
sufficient time to fully identify incident cases, which in the case of
BCC could be longer than for cSCC. Population studies should
be designed to assess follow-up periods longer than 10 years to
establish the effectiveness of sunscreen in preventing KC, because
current studies have had short follow-up periods. Although these
short-term outcome variables could be assumed as “proxy” in the
incidence of KC, they do not allow for the generation of defini-
tive conclusions given that they provide insufficient evidence. In
addition, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the effect of mul-
tiple barrier measures combined with the use of sunscreen. It is
important to remark that the design and conduct of these inter-
ventions need to be delivered within a suitable behavioural change
framework. Such complex interventions require understanding
the lessons learned from existing educational campaigns and be-
havioural motivation studies in these areas.
With regard to other protective measures (such as wearing sun-
protective clothing, glasses, or hats, or seeking the shade when
outdoors), clinical studies need to be developed to evaluate their
effectiveness and safety. These could be carried out in combination
with the use of sunscreens and also in special groups, such as
children or those with predominant skin phototypes I to III who
have a higher risk of developing skin cancers.
The design of future studies in sun protection might be improved
with the following suggestions.
1. Evaluating different sun protection factors and different
application regimens in order to establish what is the best
sunscreen regimen to avoid onset of KC.
18

 2. Combining different sun protection strategies compared
with sunscreen use in order to assess their effectiveness and safety.
3. Comparing other sun protection strategies (such as wearing
sun-protective clothing, glasses, or hats, and seeking the shade
when outdoors) versus sunscreen in order to assess whether there
are differences between these interventions in terms of
effectiveness and safety.
4. Running campaigns to prevent skin cancer in different
populations, especially those including the predominant skin
phototypes I to III who have a higher risk of developing it.
5. Adding adverse events as an important endpoint in the
assessment of all of these preventive strategies.

Multisite: no
International: no
Treatment duration: 4.5 years
Follow-up: 4.5 years
Random unit: participants
Analysis unit: participants, tumours
Participants
Inclusion criteria
Residents of Nambour (South East Queensland), aged between 20 and 69 when they
took part in a skin cancer survey in 1986. To be eligible for the current study, the original
survey participants had to participate in a second survey in 1992, undergo a complete
skin examination by a dermatologist with removal of all diagnosed skin cancers, and give
written consent to take part in this randomised trial until 1996
Exclusion criteria
Participants who were taking vitamin supplements containing beta-carotene and those
who reported that they were already applying sunscreen on a strict daily basis were
excluded
Participant groups
1621 participants were randomised to 1 of 4 groups (Green 1994: the original protocol
reported 1626 participants):
Basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, adverse events
• Group 1: 404 (50 participants lost to follow up = 12%); 354 participants analysed
• Group 2: 408 (70 participants lost to follow up = 17%); 338 participants analysed
• Group 3: 416 (59 participants lost to follow up = 14%); 357 participants analysed
• Group 4: 393 (59 participants lost to follow up = 15%); 334 participants analysed
Actinic keratosis
• Group 1: 404 (110 participants lost to follow up = 28%); 294 participants
analysed
• Group 2: 408 (145 participants lost to follow up = 36%); 263 participants
analysed
• Group 3: 416 (136 participants lost to follow up = 32%); 280 participants
analysed
• Group 4: 393 (114 participants lost to follow up = 29%); 279 participants
analysed
Frequency of sunscreen used
• Group 1 + 2 = 812 (48 participants lost to follow up = 5.9%); 764 participants
analysed
Demographic characteristics
• Group 1: mean age = 48.5 years (SD: 12.9); percentage of men = 44.3%; skin
type: always burn = 21.8%; skin colour: fair = 54.6%; occupation type: mainly indoors
= 42.6%; previous skin cancer = 27.7%

type: always burn = 19.6%; skin colour: fair = 51.6%; occupation type: mainly indoors
= 45.2%; previous skin cancer = 29%
Interventions
4 groups:
• Group 1: daily application* of SPF 16 cream + 1 30 mg beta-carotene tablet once
a day with a meal
• Group 2: daily application* of SPF 16 cream + 1 placebo tablet a day with a meal
• Group 3: 1 30 mg beta-carotene tablet a day with a meal + discretionary use of
sunscreen
• Group 4: 1 placebo tablet a day with a meal + discretionary use of sunscreen
*Daily sunscreen: self-application of a layer to all exposed sites on the head, neck, arms,
and hands every morning (reapplication was advised after heavy sweating, bathing, or
long sun exposure)
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
1. Basal cell carcinoma confirmed by histopathology at any follow-up.
2. Squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by histopathology at any follow-up.
Secondary outcomes
1. Adverse events (e.g. dermatitis from sunscreens, acne secondary to use of
sunscreens, dermatitis from the use of hats and sun-protective clothing, vitamin D
deficiency from lack of exposure to the sun, etc.) reported by a number of participants
or individually.
2. Actinic keratosis (Darlington 2003): counts were recorded as the number of
defined actinic keratoses observed on each site, except where this number exceeded 50
or on sites where more than 50% of the skin surface area was confluent with keratosis.
Assessment of participants’ compliance with preventive strategies at the end of the trial
(Neale 2002) through a questionnaire: weight and frequency of sunscreen used

Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Unclear risk
Neale 2002 reported the association be-
tween possible predictors of sunscreen use
and frequency of sunscreen application, in-
cluding information on variables such as
time outdoors on weekdays in summer and
burns during the trial, but this information
was not reported in a full way in other ref-
erences
Other bias
Unclear risk
The impact of multiple posthoc analysis
(repeated significance testing) was unclear
The report of the number of participants
randomised (1626 versus 1621) was un-
clear
The impact of differences in sample size es-
timationsandfinal sample obtained(differ-
ent estimations in Green 1994 and Green
1999) was unclear.
The impact of clinical versus histologic di-
agnosis of skin cancer was unclear. Quote:
“67% of all interim skin cancers were di-
agnosed histologically, and 33% were clin-
ically diagnosed.” (Page 725 - Green 1999)
The impact of missing data was unclear.
Quote: “Analyses have been based on the
1383 trial participants (85%) who had out-
come data based on at least one complete
skin examination by a dermatologist in
1994 or 1996.” (Page 725 - Green 1999)
The assessment of interaction between the
effects of the different interventions (sun-
screen and beta-carotene) was unclear
SD = standard deviation.
SPF = sun protection factor.

1. Due to scarcity and nature of data (one single study was identified and included in our review), we were not able to implement
the following methods:
i) sensitivity analysis of ’Risk of bias’ results;
ii) analysis of heterogeneity;
iii) assessment of reporting biases;
iv) subgroup analyses; or
v) trial sequence analysis and summarising the findings using random-effects models with the DerSimonian and Laird method
to carry out statistical analyses using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2012).
2. We were not able to identify numerical information about the following continuous outcomes:
i) the number of self-reported sunburns or skin lesions;
ii) total hours of ultraviolet radiation exposure;
iii) total hours outdoors in peak exposure times; or
iv) minimal erythema dosis (MED).
3. We expanded on our primary outcomes by adding confirmation by ’clinical’ criteria of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions and
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) lesions, because histopathological confirmation of keratinocyte cancer could be a
difficulty in population-based studies with large sample sizes, and then, clinical confirmation is more likely to be used. However, we
thought that this was a source of indirectness, and we downgraded the evidence related to these outcomes in the corresponding
Summary of findings for the main comparison.
4. We added a ’Summary of findings’ table, which was not planned in the protocol. However, these are now recommended in
Cochrane Reviews to assess the quality of evidence.
