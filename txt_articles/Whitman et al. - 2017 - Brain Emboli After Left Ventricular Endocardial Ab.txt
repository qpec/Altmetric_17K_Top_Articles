BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia and 
premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of 
atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to 
cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but 
cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.
METHODS: We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria 
scheduled for ventricular tachycardia or PVC ablation over a 9-month 
period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared 
with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. 
Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or 
permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in 
all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times 
of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural 
brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the ablation 
procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion 
and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI 
within a vascular distribution.
RESULTS: The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, 
half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular 
disease or heart failure. LV ablation was performed in 12 patients 
(ventricular tachycardia, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular ablation 
was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular tachycardia, n=1; PVC, 
n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV ablation experienced a total 
of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right 
ventricular ablation (P=0.04). Seven of 11 patients (63%) undergoing a 
retrograde approach to the LV developed at least 1 new brain lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients undergoing routine LV ablation 
procedures (predominately PVC ablations) experienced new brain emboli 
after the procedure. Future research is critical to understanding the long-
term consequences of these lesions and to determining optimal strategies 
to avoid them.

T
he prevalence of endocardial ablation as a treatment 
method for various cardiac arrhythmias is growing, 
with well >235 
000 ablations performed annually. 
Endocardial catheter ablation of the left and right ventri-
cles primarily for ventricular tachycardia (VT) comprises 
≈7% of ablations in the United States, a proportion that 
is expected to increase.1–3 Furthermore, there is growing 
evidence that premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) 
may be a more common cause of systolic dysfunction 
than had been realized, and thus the number of patients 
considered for PVC ablation will likely also substantially 
increase.4–8
Early research into the risks associated with diagnos-
tic aortic valve procedures demonstrated new asymp-
tomatic cerebral emboli in 22% of patients with the use 
of MRI. These lesions were attributed to disruption of 
debris from the degenerative aortic valves because of 
multiple attempts to cross the valve with a wire.9 Coro-
nary angiography was then shown to be associated with 
the same phenomenon in ≈10% of patients, potentially 
related to the vascular disease common in patients with 
coronary disease or emboli related to the frequent ex-
change of materials through the diagnostic catheters.10 
Subsequently, the development of cerebral emboli after 
atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation was established, ranging 
from ≈6% to 38% of all cases.11–15 Risk factors included 
duration of radiofrequency ablation, suggesting that the 
uniquely large number of ablation lesions in AF ablation 
might be important, and intraprocedural cardioversion, 
signifying left atrial appendage stunning as being at least 
partly responsible.12,16–18
It is important to note that although these embolic 
infarcts were initially thought to be subclinical, ensuing 
investigation has demonstrated they may have negative 
neurocognitive effects.19–21 Unlike diagnostic catheter-
based procedures for aortic valve disease, left ventricu-
lar (LV) ablation procedures are often performed in pa-
tients with normal valves. Unlike coronary angiography, 
there is generally no injection of any material directly 
into the left side of the heart and, in comparison with 
AF ablation, the number of lesions in many LV ablation 
procedures is fewer, the ventricle is a higher-flow and a 
more dynamic chamber, and cardioversion is generally 
not relevant. However, given the growing number of LV 
ablations, particularly in light of the growing popularity of 
ablation among otherwise healthy patients with PVCs, we 
sought to determine whether any risk of cerebral embo-
lism might be present.
METHODS
We sought to determine whether cerebral emboli identified 
by comparing pre- and postprocedural diffusion-weighted MRI 
(DWI-MRI) of the brain occur after LV endocardial ablation. We 
prospectively screened the charts of consecutively scheduled 
ventricular ablations at our center for eligible patients. Patients 
were excluded for an age <18 years, contraindication to MRI, 
the presence of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or perma-
nent pacemaker, or the inability to provide informed consent. 
To test the hypothesis that some proportion of cerebral emboli 
would be observed specifically in the retrograde approach (via 
the femoral artery, through the aorta and the aortic valve to 
reach the LV) and on the basis of rates observed in previous 
left-heart procedures (generally 10%–20%),9–15 we sought to 
enroll all consenting consecutive patients scheduled for PVC 
or VT ablations without any of the exclusion criteria (as above) 
until at least 10 purely retrograde LV procedures had been 
completed (to detect if at least 1 in 10 such patients experi-
enced a new cerebral embolus).
Once identified as eligible and consented to enroll, partici-
pants underwent DWI-MRI of the brain within 1 week of their 
scheduled ablation. This included 3D T2 cube fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and axial and coronal 
planes DWI-MRI (GE Healthcare 750 3T, 24X software platform) 
with the following characteristics: FLAIR – repetition time/echo 
time/inversion time=5800 ms/117.5 ms/1560 ms, echo train 
length 160, matrix 256×256, slice thickness 1.1 mm, field 
of view 24 cm, scan time ≈6.5 minutes; axial DWI imaging 
– repetition time/echo time=12s/minimum, b=1000 s/mm2, 
3 directions, number of excitations=4, matrix=112×140, slice 
thickness 2 mm, field of view 24 cm, scan time ≈2.4 minutes; 
coronal DWI imaging – repetition time/echo time=12s/mini-
mum, b=1000 s/mm2, 3 directions, number of excitations=4, 
matrix=100×90, field of view 24 cm, scan time ≈2.4 minutes. 
On the first postprocedural day, a repeat DWI-MRI of the brain 
using the same protocol was obtained.
The MRIs were interpreted by a board-certified neuroradi-
ologist blinded to the details of the patient’s clinical condition 
and procedure. A complete neurological examination was per-
formed at the time of the pre- and postprocedural DWI-MRIs 
by a physician or research coordinator trained in neurological 
examination. Before initiation of the study, the following pro-
tocol was established on the basis of recommendations from 
expert neurology colleagues: in the event of positive asymp-
tomatic DWI-MRI findings, patients were started on aspirin 81 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Brain imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI of patients 
undergoing left ventricular endocardial ablation dem-
onstrated a significant risk of brain emboli, even in 
the absence of clinically apparent stroke.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The long-term consequences of subclinical emboli 
to the brain are unknown. Given their prevalence in 
patients undergoing left ventricular endocardial abla-
tion, their long-term effects should be addressed by 
future research.
• Future research should elucidate risk factors for 
brain emboli and the optimal strategies to prevent 
brain emboli associated with left ventricular endo-
cardial ablation.

mg daily if not already taking it and referred to the Neurology 
Clinic as an outpatient. Any neurological deficits or symptoms 
would trigger an immediate assessment by a neurologist.
On the day of the ablation, all patients were evaluated by 
an anesthesiologist before the procedure. Decisions regard-
ing the use of general anesthesia before the procedure, 
management of intraprocedural sedation, and dosing of intra-
procedural anticoagulation were made by the electrophysiol-
ogy attending physician. Decisions regarding vascular access 
and, in patients undergoing LV ablation, approach to the LV 
(ie, retrograde aortic versus transseptal) were made on the 
basis of clinical grounds. Participants underwent standard VT 
or PVC ablation procedures. All cases were performed with a 
cardiac electrophysiology fellow. Venous access was obtained 
using ultrasound and micropuncture approaches. Transseptal 
punctures were performed under intracardiac ultrasound and 
fluoroscopic guidance. Standard dosing of all intraprocedural 
medications was used, including heparin dosing on the basis of 
weight. Heparin was infused before any LV access, and hepa-
rin dosing and activated clotting times were recorded with a 
goal-activated clotting time of 300 to 400 seconds. Standard 
sheaths and irrigated-tip catheters (SmartTouch, Biosense; 
TactiCath, St. Jude Medical) for ventricular ablation were used 
in a power-controlled system (up to 40 W) and an irrigation rate 
using 0.9% heparinized saline of 20 to 35 mL/min to main-
tain a tip temperature of <45°C. The CARTO (Biosense) and 
EnSite NavX (St. Jude Medical) mapping systems were used 
for each case. All left-sided ablations using a retrograde aortic 
approach underwent a femoral angiogram (primarily to assess 
for the suitability of closure device placement). A board-certi-
fied interventional cardiologist with expertise in peripheral vas-
cular disease who was blinded to all outcomes reviewed all the 
femoral angiograms for evidence of vascular disease.
The study was approved by the University of California, 
San Francisco Institutional Review Board. All patients gave 
informed consent.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using STATA version 13.0. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were described 
by using means with standard deviations. The postprocedural 
cerebral embolic burden was quantified in comparison with pre-
procedural DWI-MRI findings, and comparisons between groups 
were performed using the Fishers Exact Test or Students t 
test, as appropriate. A 2-tailed P value of <0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
RESULTS
We screened 119 patients scheduled for PVT or VT abla-
tion between November 2014 and May 2016, with 18 
ultimately included in the study (Figure 1). LV ablation 
(10 for PVC and 2 for VT) was performed in 12 patients 
(retrograde only and crossing the aortic valve in 10, both 
retrograde and transseptal in 1, and transseptal only in 
1) and right ventricle–only ablation in 6 patients (5 for 
PVC and 1 for VT). In patients undergoing LV versus right 
ventricle ablation, there were no detectable differences 
in patient characteristics (Table 1). Patients undergoing 
LV ablation had longer procedures. In the LV ablation 
group, 16 new cerebral emboli were identified in 7 pa-
tients (58% of all LV patients) (Figure 2), in comparison 
with zero in the right ventricle ablation group (P=0.04). 
None of the patients were symptomatic and none of the 
pre– or post–physical examinations revealed any new 
neurological deficits. Those with cerebral emboli all 
underwent retrograde aortic approaches (64% of retro-
grade procedures, and excluding 1 patient who under-
went a transseptal approach as well, 70% of all purely 
retrograde procedures). Patients with new brain emboli 
had higher intraprocedural minimum systolic blood pres-
sure (Table 2), but no other procedural characteristics 
were associated with a higher risk. There were no sta-
tistically significant associations between procedural-
activated clotting time values or protamine dosing and 
development of brain emboli (online-only Data Supple-
ment Table I). None of the femoral angiograms of pa-
tients undergoing retrograde aortic procedures revealed 
any evidence of peripheral vascular disease (online-only 
Data Supplement Figure I). Only 1 patient underwent 
intraprocedural cardioversion, and that patient had no 
postprocedural cerebral emboli. The regions ablated in 
those undergoing LV ablation are depicted in Figure 3, 
and no regional pattern was detected in association with 
occurrence of cerebral emboli.
DISCUSSION
Performing DWI-MRI on 18 consecutive patients meeting 
study inclusion criteria and using a standard approach to 
ventricular ablation, we found that more than half of the 
patients developed new asymptomatic brain emboli re-
lated to the LV ablation procedure. Seven of 11 patients 
undergoing a retrograde aortic approach to the LV devel-
oped postprocedural cerebral emboli by MRI. The dra-
matic incidence of brain emboli was surprising, because 
it was higher than that seen with AF ablation despite 
being in a higher-flow chamber with substantially fewer 
radiofrequency burns, and because the great majority of 
patients were relatively healthy and only undergoing PVC 
ablations. This important finding underscores questions 
regarding the etiology of these emboli, their potential 
sequelae, and best practice for LV endocardial ablation.
That a minority of patients undergoing AF ablation ex-
perience new brain lesions is now well established.11–15 
Although the incidence of clinically apparent cerebral 
emboli (ie, stroke) after AF ablation is <2%,12,22 the 
incidence of subclinical emboli detected by brain MRI 
occurs in up to 6% to 38% of cases.11–15,17,23 However, 
there are several characteristics inherent to AF ablation 
that are not applicable to LV ablation procedures. AF 
itself, and particularly cardioversion, is associated with 
stroke (because of preexisting thrombi in the left atrial 
appendage or subsequent formation of thrombi during

postcardioversion stunning). Although severely dilated 
left ventricles may also harbor thrombi, this is generally 
not relevant in patients with predominately idiopathic 
PVCs or VT, and none of our patients had an ejection 
fraction <35%. AF ablation often involves considerable 
left atrial time and not infrequently can include >50 or 
even >100 ablation lesions. In contrast, the average 
number of LV lesions in our study was <10. Last, the 
high-flow chamber of the LV has generally been thought 
to be less prone to thrombus formation than the low-
flow left atrium, which might be more prone to clots 
related to stagnant blood flow. Conversely, previous 
literature regarding diagnostic catheters (outside the 
realm of electrophysiology and not involving ablation), 
such as during aortic valve studies9 and coronary an-
giography involving a retrograde aortic approach,10 
have also exhibited a risk of cerebral emboli. However, 
simply crossing the aortic valve with a diagnostic cath-
eter was associated with a 22% incidence of new brain 
emboli, and, because this was done only in patients 
with aortic stenosis, this observation has largely been 
attributed to pathology of the aortic valve and associ-
ated debris that may easily embolize. Among patients 
undergoing coronary angiography, 10% exhibited new 
brain lesions, but, unlike with catheter ablation, there 
is direct injection of material, which itself may pose 
unique risk.
The incidence of new brain lesions among our pa-
tients is therefore striking, because many factors previ-
ously thought to be causes of brain emboli in catheter-
based cardiac procedures are less relevant in our study 
patients, and the patients were relatively healthy. The 
incidence of stroke stemming from LV ablation is rare, 
similar to that occurring with AF ablation, and has typical-
ly been observed in populations with relatively prevalent 
ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe systolic dysfunc-
tion and chronic kidney disease.24,25 Indeed, the majority 
of patients in our study underwent LV ablation for PVCs, 
which are typically treated in lower-risk patients with less 
significant underlying cardiac disease and generally re-
quire fewer ablation applications than in those with VT. 
Furthermore, in contrast to typical patients undergoing 
ventricular ablation, the patients in our study undergoing 
LV ablation had a prevalence of only 50% of hypertension 
or hyperlipidemia, and were relatively free of diabetes 
mellitus, coronary disease, heart failure, and atrial fibril-
lation. No patients had chronic kidney disease or a his-
tory of peripheral vascular disease, and an examination 
of all femoral angiograms for those undergoing retro-
grade LV procedures revealed no evidence of peripheral 
vascular disease. In fact, PVC patients are arguably the 
lowest possible risk group undergoing LV ablation. Yet, 
over half of patients in the study experienced cerebral 
emboli, including 60% of those undergoing PVC ablation.
The patients in the present study were, on aver-
age, healthier than the typical patient undergoing LV 
ablation, suggesting that the risk of emboli in patients 
with ischemic VT and dilated cardiomyopathies may

be even higher. The common presence of implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators in these less healthy groups 
poses a unique challenge given safety concerns re-
garding MRI procedures. However, with increasing 
evidence that MRIs are safe for patients with implant-

ous neurological deficits.10,28,29 However, debate exists 
as to whether they may have negative neurocognitive 
effects, including influence on executive function, visual 
and auditory learning, attention, psychomotor speed, 
and memory.19–21,30,31 Although the presence of cerebral 
emboli and neurocognitive decline after cardiac surgery 
is well described, the 2 phenomena have not been uni-
formly associated with one another.21,31 However, in a 
study evaluating patients undergoing intracardiac proce-
dures only (ie, valve surgery, excluding bypass surgery) 
and excluding patients with prevalent mood disorders, 
cognitive decline was associated with the presence of 
postoperative cerebral emboli and worsening cognitive 
function correlated with increasing postoperative cere-
bral embolic burden.20
In the single study to date in the AF literature ex-
amining postprocedural neurocognitive performance, 
a decline in neurocognitive function was observed in 
13% to 20% of patients undergoing pulmonary vein iso-
lation for paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively, 
the majority of whom had CHADS2 scores of 0 to 1.19 
Although these patients did not undergo MRI to cor-
relate these neurocognitive findings with cerebral em-
bolism, the decline was statistically greater than those 
undergoing ablation for supraventricular tachycardia 
or those with AF awaiting ablation, suggesting that 
some procedural effect related to left atrial ablation is 
the likely culprit. Fortunately, evidence does suggest 
that >80% of the cerebral emboli detected by MRI 
shortly after the procedure resolve on follow-up MRI 
weeks later.11,14 However, this stands in contrast to the 
persistence of the neurocognitive effects, which may 
be long lasting.19 In fact, cerebral tissue necrosis may 
persist even after resolution of radiological lesions, 
and neurological and cognitive deficits can persist de-
spite normal DWI-MRI.32–34
The exact etiology of these brain lesions remains un-
clear. The AF ablation literature demonstrates that the 
type of ablation catheter can be important,13,15 suggest-
ing that emboli originating from the eschar at the site of 
ablation lesions may be implicated.35–38 Prior literature 
has demonstrated intraprocedural cardioversion to be 
a risk factor for in AF ablation12,16,17; however, only 1 
patient underwent intraprocedural cardioversion in the 
present study despite a high rate of postprocedural 
cerebral emboli (and the absence of postprocedural 
cerebral embolus in that single patient). The incidence 
of cerebral emboli has been shown to diminish with AF 
ablation performed on therapeutic warfarin, arguing that 
embolization of thrombus plays an important role.39 It is 
noteworthy that we found no statistically significant rela-
tionships between activated clotting time measurements 
and brain emboli; the only relationship that neared statis-
tical significance (P=0.05) revealed a trend toward more 
subtherapeutic time in those without the development of 
emboli. It is important to note that although the ablation 
itself is always performed using high-dose heparin, the 
conventional approach has been to reverse the heparin 
effect at the end of the procedure to achieve hemostasis 
at the access sites. Therefore, the on-warfarin proce-
dures may offer a protective effect in the period after re-
versal of anticoagulation, but this has not become com-
mon practice for LV ablations. Indeed, because these 
cases often involve femoral arterial access, there may 
be a greater reluctance to perform such procedures on 
therapeutic anticoagulation. Air entrained through the 
catheter, tissue from transseptal puncture, or calcium or 
plaque from valves may also play a role in the pathogen-

esis of procedurally related cerebral embolism observed 
in the current study.9–15 The data from diagnostic proce-
dures using a retrograde aortic approach suggests that 
dislodgment of debris, either aortic atheroma or mate-
rial on the aortic valve, may be especially important.9,10 
However, only 2 patients in our study had either aortic 
sclerosis or aortic vascular disease by echocardiogram 
or by history (none had aortic stenosis), 1 of whom was 
found to have a cerebral embolus. Although only one of 
our patients underwent LV ablation via a purely transsep-
tal approach, it is interesting to note that all cerebral em-
boli were detected in patients undergoing a retrograde 
aortic approach. On the basis of these results, it is only 
conjecture to suggest that embolism may be associated 
with a retrograde aortic approach to the LV. However, 
future studies may help determine if a transseptal rather 
than a retrograde aortic approach might reduce the risk 
of emboli.

The implications pertaining to catheter technology, 
procedural approach to the LV, anticoagulation man-
agement, and patient risk stratification are severalfold. 
Clearly, the neurocognitive impact of these cerebral em-
boli requires further understanding to better assess the 
risk-benefit ratio before LV ablation, particularly in pa-
tients with PVCs undergoing truly elective procedures. 
In those undergoing LV ablation, identifying mechanisms 
and risk factors for harmful emboli will ultimately facili-
tate effective screening strategies as the first step in 
prevention. For example, transesophageal or intracar-
diac echocardiography identifying aortic root plaque 
before accessing the LV might steer an operator to-
ward a transseptal approach. Computed tomography 
imaging or other peripheral vascular disease screening 
represents other possible tools that, on the basis of 
mechanisms and risk factors not yet identified, could 
function to help assess patients and guide clinical de-
cisions regarding optimal approaches. It may be that 
procedural factors are more at play than patient factors 
in increasing risk for cerebral emboli, and the results 
of the present study necessitate better understanding 
this. Is a transseptal approach protective relative to the 
retrograde aortic access to the LV? Should patients be 
continued on uninterrupted anticoagulation (either on 
warfarin or a novel anticoagulant, for example) through-
out the procedure and during sheath removal? Are cer-
tain regions of the LV more prone to coagulation at the 
site of ablation?
This study has several limitations. Because of a rela-
tively small sample size, we were likely underpowered 
to identify specific predictors of cerebral emboli among 
those undergoing LV ablation. Nonetheless, despite a 
small sample size, this is the first study to demonstrate 
a previously underappreciated risk of cerebral embo-
lism with LV endocardial ablation, and we believe the 
proportion of patients exhibiting new brain lesions is re-
markable. Patients in the study did not routinely undergo 
transesophageal echocardiography or computerized 
axial tomography to assess for aortic atherosclerosis; 
however, no patients had a history of peripheral vas-
cular disease, only 3 carried a diagnosis of coronary 
artery disease or aortic vascular disease, and none of 
those undergoing retrograde aortic approaches had evi-
dence of peripheral vascular disease on their femoral 
angiogram. Although subclinical disease may have con-
tributed in some patients, there were no clear risk fac-
tors identified using the current standard of care.
CONCLUSION
Patients undergoing LV endocardial ablation are at sig-
nificant risk of cerebral emboli, the significance of which 
is unknown. In fact, more than half of patients may devel-
op cerebral emboli with LV endocardial ablation, a much 
larger proportion than that seen in AF despite fewer abla-
tion lesions and ablation to a high-flow cardiac chamber. 
Future research is critical to understanding the long-term 
consequences of these lesions and to determine optimal 
strategies to avoid them.
