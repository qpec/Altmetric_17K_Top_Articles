Abstract
Background—Acquired aplastic anemia results from immune-mediated destruction of bone 
marrow. Immunosuppressive therapies are effective, but reduced numbers of residual stem cells 
may limit their efficacy. In patients with aplastic anemia that was refractory to 
immunosuppression, eltrombopag, a synthetic thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, led to clinically 
significant increases in blood counts in almost half the patients. We combined standard 
immunosuppressive therapy with eltrombopag in previously untreated patients with severe aplastic 
anemia.
Methods—We enrolled 92 consecutive patients in a prospective phase 1–2 study of 
immunosuppressive therapy plus eltrombopag. The three consecutively enrolled cohorts differed 
with regard to the timing of initiation and the duration of the eltrombopag regimen (cohort 1 
received eltrombopag from day 14 to 6 months, cohort 2 from day 14 to 3 months, and cohort 3 
from day 1 to 6 months). The cohorts were analyzed separately. The primary outcome was 
complete hematologic response at 6 months. Secondary end points included overall response, 
survival, relapse, and clonal evolution to myeloid cancer.
Results—The rate of complete response at 6 months was 33% in cohort 1, 26% in cohort 2, and 
58% in cohort 3. The overall response rates at 6 months were 80%, 87%, and 94%, respectively. 
The complete and overall response rates in the combined cohorts were higher than in our historical 
cohort, in which the rate of complete response was 10% and the overall response rate was 66%. At 
a median follow-up of 2 years, the survival rate was 97%; one patient died during the study from a

 nonhematologic cause. Marked increases in bone marrow cellularity, CD34+ cell number, and 
frequency of early hematopoietic progenitors were noted. Rates of relapse and clonal evolution 
were similar to our historical experience. Severe rashes occurred in two patients, resulting in the 
early discontinuation of eltrombopag.
Conclusions—The addition of eltrombopag to immunosuppressive therapy was associated with 
markedly higher rates of hematologic response among patients with severe aplastic anemia than in 
a historical cohort. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01623167.)
In patients with aplastic anemia, the “empty” bone marrow does not produce blood cells, and 
when pancytopenia is severe and untreated, almost all patients die within 1 year after 
diagnosis.1 Acquired aplastic anemia has immune pathophysiological features, as inferred 
from numerous laboratory studies and animal models.2 Patients are cured by the replacement 
of both the hematopoietic and immune systems in a stem-cell transplant, but 
immunosuppressive therapy alone is also effective. Approximately two thirds of patients 
have increased blood-cell production after a single course of horse antithymocyte globulin 
and cyclosporine.3-5 Hemato-logic response is strongly correlated with long-term survival.6
Many efforts to improve on the standard treatment with horse antithymocyte globulin and 
cyclosporine have failed. Rabbit antithymocyte globulin, a more potent lymphocytotoxic 
agent than horse antithymocyte globulin, was less effective than horse antithymocyte 
globulin in a randomized trial.5 Cyclophosphamide had unacceptable toxic effects.7 
Empirical efforts to increase the rate of response8,9 and rational attempts to modulate the 
immune response further10,11 have not been successful in research trials.
A likely limit to the efficacy of immunosuppression is the stem-cell deficit. Early progenitor 
and hematopoietic stem cells are greatly reduced in all patients with severe aplastic 
anemia.12 Blood counts are the major predictors of outcome in patients with aplastic anemia 
and are assumed to reflect stem-cell reserve. Residual levels of reticulocytes and 
lymphocytes have correlated with both response to antithymocyte globulin and survival.13 
The rates of hematologic response to immunosuppressive therapies are higher among 
children than adults14 and are worse among older adults,1515 correlating with the stem-cell 
loss that occurs with aging.
We previously found that eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, was 
effective in patients with aplastic anemia that was refractory to immunosuppression.16,17 
Approximately 45% of the patients had a hematologic response to single-agent eltrombopag; 
not only did they have higher platelet counts, but they also had marked increases in 
hemoglobin levels and higher neutrophil numbers. We hypothesized that the addition of 
eltrombopag to standard immunosuppression as the first treatment for severe aplastic anemia 
would increase the rate of complete response and improve long-term outcomes.

 Methods
Study Design and Implementation
This investigator-initiated, nonrandomized, historically controlled, phase 1–2 study was 
approved by the institutional review board at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI). The protocol is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.or. The 
Intramural Research Program of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, funded this 
research. GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, the manufacturers of eltrombopag, provided the 
drug and research support to the U.S. government under a Cooperative Research and 
Development Agreement. A data and safety monitoring board monitored the study. The 
authors wrote the manuscript without assistance, gathered and analyzed the data, vouch for 
the completeness and accuracy of the data and analysis, and vouch for the adherence of the 
study to the protocol. All the patients or their legal guardians provided written informed 
consent.
Antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine were administered as standard 
immunosuppression. Three eltrombopag dosing schemes were implemented in consecutively 
enrolling cohorts (Fig. 1). Participants underwent evaluations that included serial bone 
marrow biopsies, blood counts, and health-outcome questionnaires (see the protocol). 
Evaluations were performed at the Hatfield Clinical Research Center, Bethesda, Maryland. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed in a subgroup of patients (see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
Patients
Patients 2 years of age or older who had previously untreated severe aplastic anemia1 were 
eligible. Participants with Fanconi's anemia, severe liver impairment, or evidence of a clonal 
myeloid disorder on cytogenetic testing performed within 12 weeks before study entry were 
excluded (see the Supplementary Appendix). From June 2012 through November 2015, all 
the consecutive patients who were eligible were offered enrollment (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Treatment Regimen
Horse antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM, Pfizer) and cyclosporine were administered as 
described previously (see the Supplementary Appendix).5 Eltrombopag (Promacta, Novartis) 
was administered at a dose of 150 mg daily in patients who were 12 years of age or older, at 
a dose of 75 mg daily in patients who were 6 to 11 years of age, and at a dose of 2.5 mg per 
kilogram of body weight per day in patients who were 2 to 5 years of age. East or Southeast 
Asian participants were administered 50% of the eltrombopag dose because of higher 
eltrombopag exposure due to differences in pharmacokinetics observed in this ethnic group. 
Dose reductions were implemented as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The 
duration of treatment with eltrombopag varied according to cohort (Fig. 1).
CD34+ Cell Enumeration and Assay of Hematopoietic Progenitors
Enumeration of CD34+ cell numbers was performed on serial bone marrow aspirates by 
means of flow cytometry in all patients (see the Supplementary Appendix). In addition,

 hematopoieticstem cells CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+CD49f+ phenotype with low 
rhodamine uptake) and multipotent progenitors (CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90-CD49f- 
phenotype) were measured in 13 patients by means of flow cytometry as previously 
described (see the Supplementary Appendix).18
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was complete response at 6 months. The primary safety end 
point was the safety profile in the 6 months after the initiation of treatment. Secondary end 
points included partial and overall hematologic responses at 3 months, at 6 months, and at 
each year of follow-up; survival; self-reported health outcomes; relapse; paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); and clonal evolution, which was defined as a new clonal 
cytogenetic abnormality or characteristic changes in bone marrow consistent with the 
myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.
Hematologic response was defined according to our previously published studies4,6and 
categorized as follows: a complete response was defined as an absolute neutrophil count of 
at least 1000 per cubic millimeter, a hemoglobin level of at least 10 g per deciliter, and a 
platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter (all three criteria had to be met); 
nonresponse was defined as blood counts that continued to meet the Camitta criteria1 for 
severe aplastic anemia; and partial response was defined as blood counts that no longer met 
the criteria for severe aplastic anemia but also did not meet the criteria for complete 
response. The overall response rate corresponded to the proportion of patients who had a 
partial or complete response.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size for each cohort was calculated on the basis of Simon's two-stage “minimax” 
design19 to test the null hypothesis that the 6-month complete response rate (primary end 
point) was 10% or lower versus the alternative that the 6-month complete response rate was 
30% or higher, at the 0.05 significance level and 80% power. The 10% rate was estimated on 
the basis of three decades of historical complete response rates associated with horse 
antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine at our institution. The primary end point was 
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle; patients who withdrew before 6 
months were considered to not have had a response. To compensate for early withdrawals 
and to allow for a sufficient number of patients to be evaluated for secondary end points, 
while maintaining statistical power for the primary end point, we adopted the following 
upper limits of the cohort sample sizes: 31 participants in cohort 1, 33 in cohort 2, and 31 in 
cohort 3. Results in each cohort were analyzed separately for the primary end point. 
Secondary and exploratory end points in each cohort and in all the cohorts combined were 
compared with a historical cohort of 102 patients who had received horse antithymocyte 
globulin plus cyclosporine while they were participating in randomized control groups of 
one of our two most recent clinical trials (see the Supplementary Appendix).5,11

 Results
Patients
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were similar across cohorts and 
were similar also to those of the historical cohort (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The median follow-up was 703 days (23 months; range, 84 to 
1422 days) in all patients and 713 days (24 months; range, 194 to 1422 days) in surviving 
patients (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Hematologic Response
The primary efficacy end point of the rate of complete hematologic response at 6 months 
exceeded the historical rate of 10% in all the cohorts combined (Table 2). Complete 
response was most frequent in cohort 3 (occurring in 58% of the patients), in which 
eltrombopag was administered from day 1 and then continued for 6 months. The rate of 
complete response was lowest in cohort 2 (occurring in 26% of the patients), in which the 
exposure to eltrombopag was shortest. Response rates also were higher across all cohorts as 
compared with the rate in our historical cohort (66%), and almost all the patients in cohort 3 
(94%) had a hematologic response (Table 2).5,11
The absolute neutrophil counts and platelet counts in all the cohorts were higher at 3 months 
and 6 months than they were in patients in the historical cohort who had a response (Fig. S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In 26 patients with very severe neutropenia (absolute 
neutrophil count, <200 per cubic millimeter) who had a response (across all cohorts), the 
median time to an absolute neutrophil count of more than 500 per cubic millimeter was 48 
days (interquartile range, 35 to 54). Among patients who had a response, the median time to 
transfusion independence was 32 days (interquartile range, 12 to 38) for platelets and 39 
days (interquartile range, 10 to 73) for red cells. Eltrombopag was discontinued in 17 
patients because the platelet count increased to greater than 200,000 per cubic millimeter.
Comparison of Cohorts and Predictors of Response
The response rates among the cohorts were compared and were highest in cohort 3, which 
had the earliest initiation of eltrombopag and the longest duration of treatment (Table 2). On 
multivariate logistic regression, none of the previously reported baseline hematologic 
characteristics that are predictive of response to immunosuppression13 were associated with 
complete response or overall response in the current study. A longer telomere length of 
leukocytes at baseline was significantly correlated with response, as was younger age (Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
Eltrombopag was briefly discontinued during the first 2 weeks in 7 patients who had 
transient elevations in liver-enzyme levels. Two severe adverse events, cutaneous eruptions 
of grade 2 (in Patient 86) and grade 3 (in Patient 54), were attributed by the investigators to 
eltrombopag and resulted in the discontinuation of the drug (at 4 weeks in Patient 86 and at 
6 weeks in Patient 54) (Table 3, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adverse 
events that were not attributed to eltrombopag by the investigators were neutropenic

 infections and known toxic effects from antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). One patient died 3 months after treatment from a 
nonhematologic disorder, specifically paraneoplastic encephalopathy that was attributed to 
thymoma that predated study entry.
Self-Reported Health Outcomes
A total of 69 adult patients who spoke English or Spanish completed surveys and reported 
clinically relevant impairments in their physical health at baseline, with improvement in 
their physical health and overall health-related quality of life by 6 months. Patients with a 
response at 6 months reported significantly higher levels of physical health and overall 
health-related quality of life than did patients who had not had a response (see the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic measurements in 21 patients showed a higher-than-predicted geometric 
mean area-under-the-curve value of 668 μg per milliliter (coefficient of variation, 50.6%) 
and a maximum concentration of 33.8 μg per milliliter (coefficient of variation, 43.2%) for 
the 150-mg daily regimen of eltrombopag (see the Supplementary Appendix). There was no 
correlation of the area under the curve with response, but a trend toward a higher area under 
the curve was observed in older participants and women.
Long-Term Outcomes
The overall survival rate at 2 years was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94 to 100) in all 
the cohorts and 99% (95% CI, 97 to 100) when data were censored because of 
transplantation (Fig. S4A and S4B in the Supplementary Appendix). Transplantation was 
indicated in 12 patients; 6 patients had not had a response or remained dependent on blood-
cell transfusions, 3 had a relapse, and 3 had clonal evolution. A total of 3 patients died: 1 
patient died during the study, and 2 died after allogeneic transplantation from a matched 
sibling (Patient 9) or an unrelated donor (Patient 15). A total of 10 patients underwent 
transplantation successfully and were alive at last follow-up; 5 patients received a transplant 
from a matched sibling donor, 2 from a matched unrelated donor, 1 from a haploidentical 
family donor, and 2 from an unrelated cord-blood donor in combination with a transplant 
from a haploidentical family donor.
Relapse, defined as declining blood counts that warranted the reintroduction of full-dose 
cyclosporine, occurred in 25 of 78 patients with a response (32%) after 6 months. The 
protocol was amended to allow the continuation of lowdose cyclosporine from 6 months to 2 
years after the administration of antithymocyte globulin (Fig. S4C in the Supplementary 
Appendix). This change was effective in reducing the frequency of relapse: 6 of 43 patients 
with a response (14%) in whom the drug was continued at a low dose beyond 6 months had 
a relapse, as compared with 19 of 35 patients with a response (54%) in whom cyclosporine 
was stopped at 6 months. The reinstitution of full-dose cyclosporine was effective in 
reversing relapse and increasing blood counts in 13 of 25 patients. The addition of 
eltrombopag in combination with cyclosporine reversed relapse in an additional 10 patients.

 Clonal cytogenetic evolution occurred in seven patients at 2 years. The incidence was 8% 
(standard error, ±3%) according to a competing-risk analysis (Fig. S4D and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Five patients had the loss of chromosome 7, which was 
associated with dys-plastic bone marrow changes in three patients. One patient with a 
complex karyotype (t(3;3) (q21;q26), –7) had progression to acute myeloid leukemia (Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Clonal evolution occurred 3 to 6 months after treatment 
in five patients and at 30 months in two patients. The frequency of clonal evolution was 
similar to our historical experience with standard immunosuppressive therapy (at 2 years, 
8% [standard error, ±3%] of the patients in our historical cohort had clonal evolution) (Fig. 
S4D in the Supplementary Appendix).20 Hemolytic PNH developed in two patients during 
long-term follow up; these patients received eculizumab therapy. Two patients who were 
receiving eculizumab before the development of severe aplastic anemia continued to take 
eculizumab during the study for persistent, large PNH clones. In nine patients, the 
preexisting PNH clones became undetectable after treatment with the three-drug regimen.
Hematopoiesis
Serial samples from bone marrow biopsies showed improved cellularity in 79 of 92 patients 
(86%) at either 3 or 6 months (Fig. 2A). There was no increase in the incidence of fibrosis. 
The median number of bone marrow CD34+ cells at baseline had increased by a factor of 3 
at 3 months (Fig. 2B, and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Bone marrow 
populations that were highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent 
progenitors were measured by means of flow cytometry in 13 patients. Although they were 
undetectable at baseline, these cells constituted 2 to 48 hematopoietic stem cells and 1 to 27 
multipotent progenitors per 100,000 CD34+ cells at 3 or 6 months after therapy, which is 
similar to the frequencies detected in healthy persons (Fig. 2C, and Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).21
Discussion
We added eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, to standard immunosuppressive 
therapy in patients with previously untreated severe aplastic anemia. In this prospective 
phase 1–2 study, the primary end point was complete hematologic response, defined as 
normal or near-normal blood counts, at 6 months. Patients who have a robust hematologic 
response have fewer complications, particularly with regard to relapse and clonal evolution 
to myeloid cancers, than do those without a robust response.20 Partial responses to 
antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine are the usual outcome of therapy, with only 10 to 
20% of patients having a complete response. However, in the current study, more than one 
third of the patients had a complete response by 6 months. The overall response rate, a 
secondary end point in our study, included patients who had a complete or partial response, 
the majority of whom reached transfusion independence and had neutrophil counts that were 
adequate for the avoidance of infection.6
The response rate was also higher than expected with standard immunosuppression: the rate 
was 87% in the current study, as compared with 66% in our historical cohort. The overall 
response rate (94%) and complete response rate (58%) were notably higher in cohort 3, in

 which patients had the longest exposure to eltrombopag. The great majority of partial and 
complete responses were present at 3 months, a secondary end-point time. The average time 
to transfusion independence was approximately 1 month, and clinically meaningful 
increments in the neutrophil level occurred within a few weeks after therapy began, even in 
patients with very severe neutropenia. Overall increases in blood levels of platelets and 
neutrophils were higher in patients in this study than in our historical cohort. The addition of 
eltrombopag to the current standard immunosuppression regimen therefore appeared to 
substantially increase the frequency, speed, and robustness of hematologic recovery in 
patients with severe aplastic anemia. The survival rate was greater than 95% at a median 
follow-up of 2 years.
Two severe cutaneous eruptions led to the premature discontinuation of eltrombopag early in 
the regimen. Liver-test abnormalities, although frequent, did not limit the administration of 
eltrombopag and were often transient. Health-related quality-of-life surveys showed an 
improvement in physical health and overall health-related quality of life after treatment that 
correlated with hematologic response.
Clonal evolution, the development of the myelo-dysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid 
leukemia from aplastic anemia, was a concern in our study of eltrombopag in patients with 
heavily pre-treated and refractory aplastic anemia.17 In the current study, we observed 
chromosomal changes in seven patients that were within the range that would be expected 
with immunosuppression alone at 2 years after the initiation of treat-ment.6,20,22 In two 
patients, chromosomal aberrations were either of unclear significance (trisomies 6 and 15 in 
2 of 21 cells in Patient 7, who had very short telomeres on initial testing) or transient 
(deletion of the q arm of chromosome 13 in Patient 14). In five patients, however, the loss of 
chromosome 7, either alone or in combination with complex cytogenetic abnormalities, was 
noted at follow-up bone marrow assessment; in three patients, this was accompanied by 
morphologic evidence of dysplasia or full myeloid malignant transformation. Three of the 
five patients who had a loss of chromosome 7 did not have somatic mutations that were 
detectable in candidate genes that are recurrently mutated in the myelodysplastic syndrome 
and acute myeloid leukemia; in the other two patients, small clones that had mutated in 
ASXL1 or DNMT3A were present but of uncertain significance — findings that were 
consistent with our earlier report regarding the loss of chromosome 7 after aplastic 
anemia.23 Two patients with clonal evolution had germline mutations in RTEL1, a gene 
encoding a helicase that is involved in telomere maintenance.24,25
The mechanism by which eltrombopag acts in the context of bone marrow failure is unclear. 
It is likely that eltrombopag acts directly to stimulate the proliferation of small numbers of 
residual stem-progenitor cells in patients with aplastic anemia. Telomere length at baseline 
and the age of the patient were predictive; both were reflective of the stem-cell pool. The 
interruption of the thrombopoietin-Mpl–receptor axis in animals and in humans culminates 
in general bone marrow failure.26,27 Nevertheless, thrombopoietin blood levels, similar to 
concentrations of other hematopoietic growth factors (erythropoietin and granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor) in circulating blood, are markedly elevated in patients with 
aplastic anemia.28,29 As a small molecule, eltrombopag may avoid plasma protein binding 
and kinetics, factors that could result in extremely high local concentrations in the stem-cell

 niche. Eltrombopag also may circumvent the inhibition of signal transduction from growth 
factor receptors that is induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma 
(data not shown),30 which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of immune-mediated 
bone marrow failure.
A large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RACE; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02099747) is under way in Europe to confirm our results. Longer follow-up data from 
the current trial and the RACE trial will allow for more precise determination of late risks of 
relapse and myeloid cancer. The median time to clonal evolution with immunosuppressive 
therapy is 4 to 6 years, which is longer than the median follow-up of 2 years in the current 
study. Given reproducibility and no unexpected late complications, eltrombopag in 
combination with immunosuppression may help patients optimize the timing of allogeneic 
stem-cell transplantation or avoid it. Of particular interest would be use of eltrombopag in 
combination with less toxic immunosuppressive regimens that omit antithymocyte globulin, 
particularly in older patients, in patients with coexisting conditions, and in developing 
countries where aplastic anemia is prevalent and conventional therapies extremely costly. 
Eltrombopag has shown some efficacy beyond aplastic anemia, including myelodysplastic 
syndromes,31 unilineage cytopenias, or moderate aplastic anemia (data not shown).

 Figure 1. Study Design and Treatment Plan According to Cohort
All the patients received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine. Three 
eltrombopag dosing schemes were implemented in consecutively enrolling cohorts. Results 
from each cohort informed the design of the subsequent cohort. In cohort 1, eltrombopag 
was initiated after ATG, owing to concern about overlapping hepatotoxic effects, especially 
when it is coadministered with ATG and cyclosporine. Since most responses in cohort 1 
appeared within 3 months and in order to limit eltrombopag exposure, eltrombopag was 
discontinued at 3 months in cohort 2. Because the hepatotoxic effects in cohort 2 were found 
to be infrequent and the rate of complete response was lower than in cohort 1, in cohort 3 
eltrombopag was initiated on day 1 with ATG and continued for 6 months. Details regarding 
the daily dosing scheme are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The primary end 
point was the rate of complete hematologic response at 6 months. The rate of partial 
response and the overall response rate (which included patients with a partial or complete 
response) were secondary end points.

 Figure 2. (facing page). CD34+ Cell Enumeration and Assay of Hematopoietic Progenitors
Panel A shows serial measurements of bone marrow cellularity in all 92 patients at baseline 
(green) and at 3 months and 6 months after the initiation of treatment (blue). Representative 
samples from bone marrow core biopsies (hematoxylin and eosin) obtained from Patient 7 at 
these three time points are shown. Each circle indicates one patient. The long horizontal bar 
indicates the mean, and the I bar the standard deviation. Panel B shows the serial 
quantification of CD34+ cells of the patients in cohort 3 at baseline (green) and at 3 months 
and 6 months after the initiation of treatment (blue). The long horizontal bar indicates the 
median, and the I bar the interquartile range. Representative flow-cytometric analyses at 
these three time points are shown for Patient 67; the numbers in the boxes represent the 
percentages of cells within the indicated fraction. SSC denotes side scatter. At 3 months, the 
median fraction of CD34+ cells in this cohort had increased from the baseline value by a 
factor of 3 (baseline value, 0.13%; value at 3 months, 0.45%; and value at 6 months, 0.37%). 
Similarly, the numbers of CD34+ cells in bone marrow increased during treatment in cohorts 
1 and 2 (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Panel C shows representative serial flow-
cytometric analyses of phenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; 
CD34+CD38–CD45RA–CD90+CD49f+ phenotype with low rhodamine uptake) in the bone 
marrow of Patient 29 and in a sample obtained from a healthy person (control).21 Nucleated 
bone marrow cells were initially enriched for CD34+ cells by Magnetic Automated Cell

 Separation (MACS) and analyzed by means of flow cytometry for markers expressed on 
HSCs. Owing to the paucity of CD34+ cells at baseline, most of the cells that were 
measured had a CD34– phenotype. Representative flow-cytometric analyses of multipotent 
progenitors are shown in Figure S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. The P values were 
calculated by one-way analysis of variance.

*The baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown according to cohort and in the total population of patients. All patients received 
horse antithymocyte globulin on days 1 to 4 and cyclosporine from day 1 to 6 months. All the patients received eltrombopag at an age-dependent 
dose, with cohort 1 receiving eltrombopag from day 14 to 6 months, cohort 2 from day 14 to 3 months, and cohort 3 from day 1 to 6 months. 
Patient 11 in cohort 1 was excluded from the analysis owing to ineligibility (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix). Patient 17 in cohort 1 had 
fluctuating blood counts at the 6-month time point owing to a viral infection and was categorized as having a complete response.
†Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)–deficient neutrophils could not be measured in eight patients owing to severe neutropenia.

*Complete response was defined as an absolute neutrophil count of at least 1000 per cubic millimeter, a hemoglobin level of at least 10 g per 
deciliter, and a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter. Partial response was defined as blood counts no longer meeting the criteria 
for severe aplastic anemia but not meeting the criteria for complete response. The results for overall response correspond to the proportions of 
patients with a partial or complete response. Three patients in cohort 1 withdrew from the study before 6 months, as did two patients in cohort 2 
and one in cohort 3 (Fig. S1A, S1B, and S1C in the Supplementary Appendix). The P value is for testing the null hypothesis that the rate of 
complete response at 6 months would be 30% or greater. The 95% confidence intervals were computed on the basis of normal approximation.
†The overall response rate in all cohorts was an exploratory end point. The P value is for testing the comparison of the overall response rate to the 
overall response rate in a historical cohort (67 of 102 patients [66%]).

*All the adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were attributed by the investigators to eltrombopag are shown. The data-cutoff date was May 25, 
2016. Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. Patient 87 
required a temporary dose reduction of cyclosporine and eltrombopag owing to conjugated bilirubinemia associated with pruritus. Eltrombopag 
was discontinued temporarily as mandated by the protocol in seven patients owing to a transient elevation in the liver-enzyme levels during the 
administration of antithymocyte globulin or during serum sickness that occurred during the first 2 weeks.
†Severe adverse events were observed in Patient 54 (in cohort 2) and Patient 86 (in cohort 3), who had maculopapular rashes of grade 3 and 2, 
respectively, that were associated with fever and oral pain and that resulted in hospitalization, discontinuation of eltrombopag, and treatment with 
glucocorticoids.
