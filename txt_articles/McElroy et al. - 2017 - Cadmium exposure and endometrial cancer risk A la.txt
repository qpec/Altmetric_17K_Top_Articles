Abstract
Estrogen-mimicking chemicals, such as cadmium, may be associated with increased sus-
ceptibility to hormone-dependent cancers, though supporting data are sparse, particularly
for endometrial cancer. The Health and Environmental Exposure Research (HEER) study
worked with the Arkansas Central Cancer Registry, Iowa Cancer Registry and Missouri
Cancer Registry to obtain names of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer who were
willing to be contacted for participation in our case control study. Voter registration lists from
Iowa and Missouri were used to randomly select similarly aged women as represented in
the case population. Participants were interviewed by telephone to obtain information on
known or suspected endometrial risk factors. Urine kits were sent to participants for home
collection and returned for analysis. Our case-control study consisted of 631 incident cases
of endometrial cancer diagnosed from January 2010 to October 2012 and 879 age-matched
population-based controls, ages 18–81 years (mean age 65 years). We quantified cadmium
amounts in urine and standardized these values through creatinine adjustment. Using data
from all survey completers, we developed a multivariable model for endometrial cancer.
Creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration was added to this model. Odds ratio (OR) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for endometrial cancer were calculated. After multivariable
adjustment, higher creatinine-adjusted cadmium exposure was associated with a statisti-
cally significant increase of endometrial cancer risk (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03–1.44). Our
results provide evidence that cadmium may increase the risk of endometrial cancer, possi-
bly through estrogenic effects.
Introduction
Cadmium is a toxic, bioaccumulating, non-essential, and highly persistent metal with a variety
of adverse health effects. These include renal dysfunction; breast, lung, pancreatic, and

 endometrial cancer risk; and disturbances in calcium homeostasis [1–5]. Ingesting food con-
taining cadmium (e.g., kidney, liver, crustaceans, cereals) is the primary non-occupational
source [6,7]. Smoking is the second major source of cadmium exposure in the general popula-
tion [7]. Tobacco plants readily take up agricultural sources of cadmium [8]. A doubling of uri-
nary cadmium levels may be found in heavy smokers (>300 pack years (number of smoking
years times usual number of cigarettes per day)) compared to non-smokers [9].
Because the estimated biological half-life of cadmium is from 10 to 30 years [10], only a
small fraction of inhaled or ingested cadmium is excreted, and the body burden increases over
time. Women generally have higher cadmium levels than men [11], and parous women are
more likely to have depleted iron stores and therefore absorb more cadmium when compared
to nulliparous women [12].
Endometrial cancer, the fourth most common cancer for women, occurs primarily in post-
menopausal women. In 2016, approximately 60,050 women are expected to be diagnosed with
cancer of the body of the uterus (endometrial cancers and uterine sarcomas), with 10,470 pro-
jected deaths [13]. Endometrial cancer is associated with both endogenous and exogenous estro-
gen exposure [14]. Cadmium mimics estrogen and may increase estrogen-receptor-mediated
proliferation—the classical estrogen signaling, thereby potentially contributing to endometrial
cancer risk [15,16]. Two nuclear estrogen receptors, (estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen
receptor beta (ERβ)) are involved in the classical estrogen signaling. The ERα and ERβ directly
interact with specific DNA binding sites that regulate gene expression [17,18]. Alternatively, Ali
and colleagues demonstrated that cadmium exposure in mice affected the height of the uterine
luminal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner. They suggested that the effects of cadmium
exposure was through non-classical estrogen receptor signaling [19]. In 2008, Akesson et al
reported a significant association between endometrial cancer and cadmium intake based on
assignment of cadmium exposure levels from a food frequency questionnaire [1]. However, more
recent studies using food frequency questionnaires to estimate cadmium levels have not reported
an association [20–22]. Vacchi-Suzzi [23] reported minimal correlation between urinary cad-
mium levels and estimates of dietary cadmium intake. This finding and inconsistent observa-
tional studies using estimated cadmium exposure from self-reported dietary intake has brought
the validity of food frequency questionnaires for cadmium estimation into question [24–26].
The Health and Environmental Exposure Research (HEER) study aimed to investigate the
association between endometrial cancer risk from cadmium exposure after adjusting for con-
founders in a population-based case-control study using cases from the Arkansas, Iowa and
Missouri state cancer registries and age-matched controls from voter registration lists.
Materials and methods
Study population
Incident cases of endometrial carcinoma diagnosed from January 2010 to October 2012 were
obtained from three cancer registries: Arkansas Central Cancer Registry, Iowa Cancer Registry
and Missouri Cancer Registry. In situ and non-carcinomas, such as Mu
¨llerian and mesodermal
malignant tumors, were excluded. Case ascertainment also included local or regional stages,
excluding metastatic endometrial cancer cases. Cases were contacted by each registry to obtain
written permission to pass their names to our study. Of those that agreed, contact information
was sent to HEER study staff.
Age-matched controls were randomly selected from the Iowa and Missouri voter registra-
tion lists only as the Arkansas voter registration list was not available. The Iowa voter registra-
tion list provided date of birth, whereas the Missouri voter registration list provided age. For
Missouri controls, the age of the participant was at the last voter registration period and was

 thus approximately one to three years younger than the current year. We therefore used the
listed age plus 2 years for matching. For each case, four to five controls were randomly selected
from the voter registration lists with replacements on names for which the telephone number
or residential address in Missouri or Iowa was missing. Imperfect age matching occurred due
to variable responses by potential controls. The age or year of cancer diagnosis for cases was
used as the reference age or year for the matched controls, respectively. Most questions asked
for information during the year before diagnosis, i.e. reference age/year minus one.
Introductory letters with a study brochure and consent information were sent to all poten-
tial participants. For participants who did not contact the study to decline participation and
for whom a valid address was obtained, contact information was sent to the University of
South Carolina Call Center for telephone interviews.
Assessment of cadmium and covariates
All participants were interviewed by telephone by trained interviewers. The 35-minute inter-
view asked about physical activity, reproductive history, alcohol consumption, height and
weight, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, personal and family medi-
cal history, demographic factors, a limited set of dietary components, and smoking history.
Upon completion of the telephone interview a kit to collect saliva and urine at home and
return to the study center was sent to participants. Urine sample containers and urine hats
used to collect the sample were exhaustively cleaned using multistep acid leachings before
sending to participants [27]. Analyses of acid leaching solutions from kit materials revealed no
detectable cadmium. Urine collection containers were used to prepare method blanks.
Detailed photo-essay instructions were carefully designed for the urine collection kits to mini-
mize trace element contamination during specimen collection and handling.
Urine samples were immediately refrigerated (4o Celsius) upon receipt. The University of
Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) has a laboratory that is specially designed for trace ele-
ment analysis and is subject to high-efficiency particulate air filtration. The trace-analysis labo-
ratory at MURR has been has been conducting elemental analyses of biological monitors for
35 years [28]. Cadmium was quantified by using inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction
cell-mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) following an established protocol from the National
Health and Nutritional Examination Study (NHANES) [29], with an additional correction for
the effect of strontium on the tin interference. Trace metal analyses were performed from
November 2012 to July 2014. A comprehensive quality-control program incorporating numer-
ous methods including method blanks, monitoring multiple cadmium isotopes, internal and
external controls, stability samples, replicates, spikes, and routine inclusion of National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference materials (SRM) ensured high-
quality data. The instrument detection limit (DL) for cadmium was 0.0017 μg/L, the method
detection limit (MDL) was 0.0082 μg/L, and the limit of quantification (3.3 x MDL) was 0.027
μg/L. Cadmium levels in every sample exceeded the MDL, and in no case did the method
blank (prepared using urine vials from empty specimen collection kits) exhibit [Cd] > DL.
Measurements of NIST SRM 2670a “low” yielded (average ± standard. deviation, % relative
standard deviation [RSD]) 0.045 ± 0.006 μg/L, 13%RSD (n = 19); 2670a “high” yielded 4.90 ±
0.16 μg/L, 3.3%RSD (n = 18). Three participant samples were aliquoted and measured repeat-
edly throughout the study, yielding 0.223 ± 0.016 μg/L, 7.2%RSD (n = 17); 0.184 ± 0.013 μg/L,
7.0%RSD (n = 17); 0.650 ± 0.030 μg/L, 4.7%RSD (n = 17). Urine creatinine level was also mea-
sured using a colorimetric assay based on the Jaffe
´ reaction to control for kidney function [30].

 respective state cancer registries. Participants provided written consent to have their names
passed to the HEER study. Each cancer registry kept these written consents. Invitation letters
were sent to registry-consented participants with an explanation of the study as well as infor-
mation about the next step—to telephone the participant to conduct the survey. Contact infor-
mation was also included in the invitation letter for those who did not wish to be called to opt
out of being telephoned. Upon telephoning the participants, the study was explained with an
opportunity to ask questions to clarify any concerns. Those who agreed to be interviewed were
considered to have provided verbally informed consent.
Statistical analysis
We initially compared creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration between cases and controls
using a t-test. We performed cross-tabulations of survey variables with case-control status to
screen for inclusion in a multivariable model. Missing data were relatively rare however we
imputed missing values with multiple imputation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method to impute 20 datasets to be used in the multivariable conditional logistic models. Prior
to multiple imputation, we imputed menopausal status based on participant report, smoking
status, and use of hormone replacement therapy. A woman was classified as premenopausal if
she reported still having periods and was not using hormone replacement therapy. A partici-
pant was classified as postmenopausal if she reported an oophorectomy or natural menopause
(no menstrual periods for at least 6 months) before the reference date. Women who were tak-
ing postmenopausal hormones and still having periods, and women who reported hysterec-
tomy alone were classified as premenopausal if their reference ages were in the first decile of
age at natural menopause among the controls (32 years old for current smokers and 36 years
old for nonsmokers), and postmenopausal if their reference ages were in the highest decile for
age at natural menopause in the control group (56 years old for both current smokers and non-
smokers). For six women in the intermediate age category (second to ninth deciles), meno-
pausal status was considered unknown. Thus, we defined three categories of menopausal
status: premenopausal, postmenopausal, and unknown [31].
We developed a multivariable conditional logistic model, stratifying on age at diagnosis. Var-
iables that were selected a priori (race, marital status, body mass index (BMI)), menopause at
age 56 or older, menopausal status at diagnosis, smoking history, second hand smoke exposure,
age at menarche, number of live births, weight gain, history of weight loss attempt, family his-
tory of endometrial cancer in a first degree relative, exposure to unopposed estrogen, oral con-
traceptive use, history of breast or ovarian cancer, history of uterine fibroids, history of diabetes,
sleep habits, irregular work schedule, alcohol use, protein shake and whole milk consumption)
were tested for association with case-control status in a multivariable conditional logistic regres-
sion. Those with p<0.1 were retained for further analysis. BMI, weight in kilograms divided by
squared height in meters, was capped at a maximum value of 70 kg/m2 to avoid undue influence
of extreme outliers. Variables were selected by both forward stepwise inclusion and backwards
elimination, using p = 0.1 for both entry and exit. Both stepwise models retained the same set of
variables. Interactions between variables in the model were tested; none were retained.
After the “best” case-control model had been achieved, the base-2 logarithm of creatinine-
adjusted cadmium was added to the model to test for its association with case-control status
after controlling for other risk factors, using data from women who returned a urine sample.
Because the women who opted to provide urine samples differed from those who did not, we
developed a multivariable logistic model to adjust for a potential non-response bias in the
case-control model [32]. The inverse of the predicted probability of returning a sample was
used as a weight in the conditional logistic regression model. The final set of independent

 variables were race; marital status; BMI; history of weight loss attempt; smoking status; pack-
years of cigarette smoking for former and current smokers; history of endometriosis, breast
cancer, ovarian cancer or uterine fibroids; family history of endometrial cancer; years of oral
contraceptive use; years of unopposed estrogen use; menopause at age 56 years or older; meno-
pausal status at diagnosis; protein shake and whole milk consumption; and non-response bias.
We also ran the model with only post-menopausal women and a model that excluded smoking
status. SAS for Windows v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used.
Results
Of those approached by the cancer registries (n = 2597) for permission to send their names to
our study for potential enrollment, 29% of the names (m = 749) were sent to the call center for
interviewing (approximately 25% of MO and AR and 44% of IA). Of 711 eligible cases 89%
(n = 631) completed an interview. In comparison to those who declined to pass their names to
our study from the cancer registries, those who passed their names were more likely to be
White (94% versus 90%) or married or living with partner (66% versus 55%) and less likely to
be diagnosed with endometrioid carcinoma (International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology: 8380) (74% versus 78%). The proportion with tumor grade I or II and age at diag-
nosis were similar between the two groups.
For the controls, 4280 age-matched names were randomly selected from the voter registra-
tion lists. Of the 4280 controls, 3120 were eligible and 888 completed the survey (28% participa-
tion proportion). Of the 2597 cases, 749 women with endometrial cancer were passed to the
HEER study and 631 completed the survey (24% participation proportion for cases). Among
these 1519 participants, 498 cases (79%) and 545 controls (61%) also returned urine specimens.
For the current study, we excluded 9 controls with a history of endometrial cancer, leaving 1510
participants (631 cases and 879 controls). See Fig 1 for a summary of participant enrollment.
Controls were slightly older than cases (mean age 63 years versus 60 years, respectively),
with less education (high school graduate or less: 43% versus 37%). Both marital status and
racial compositions differed between the two groups (Table 1). The cases and controls were
similar in income and employment status. Among the cases, 86% had Type I, mostly endome-
trioid adenocarcinomas, which is driven by hormonal mechanisms, and 14% were Type II,
endometrial carcinomas, which often display as serous or clear cell histology [33].
Characteristics of refusal at enrollment
Of those who actively declined to participate, 17% (9 cases and 194 controls) agreed to answer
a few demographic questions. Compared to participants who completed the interview, these
helpful refusals were more likely to be high school graduate or less (40% versus 54%) and be
married or living with partner (71% versus 82%). The educational attainment of spouse or
partner, percent of Hispanic ethnicity, race, income and sexual orientation were similar
between these two groups.
Reliability substudy
Of the 165 respondents contacted for a second interview, 2 individuals refused to be inter-
viewed, 29 could not be reached, and 134 were re-interviewed (81%; 69 cases and 65 controls).
Mean time between interviews was 13.9 months (range 3.1–20.8 months). Time between inter-
views was not different between cases and controls.
Participation in moderate and vigorous physical activity showed good concordance
between interviews (93% and 82% respectively); the kappa for moderate physical activity was
0.54 (lower confidence limit (LCL) 0.27) and vigorous physical activity was 0.64 (LCL 0.51).

 History of ever using mineral supplements showed good concordance (84.2%) with a low
kappa (0.27, LCL 0.05). The kappa for BMI category was .84 (LCL .75) with 89.6% concor-
dance. There was high concordance for ever being diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syn-
drome (97%); the kappa was 0.48 (LCL 0.05). Ever being diagnosed with diabetes showed high
concordance (95.5%); the kappa was 0.85 (LCL .74). Having a biological family member that
was ever diagnosed with endometrial cancer had high concordance between interviews (88.1).
Correlation between the repeated measures of weight, height, BMI, and age of diabetes diagno-
sis was high (0.98, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively).
Cadmium analysis
Creatinine-adjusted cadmium levels ranged from to 0.005 to 0.417 (mean 0.037) μg/g in case
participants and from 0.006 to 0.649 (mean 0.041) μg/g in control subjects. A t-test of the

 creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration between cases and controls was not statistically
significant (p = .101).
After multivariable adjustment, a doubling of urine cadmium increased the endometrial
cancer risk by 22% (Table 2; odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.44;
p-value = .02) No substantive changes were observed in any parameter estimates when only
post-menopausal women were included (S1 Table). A similarly elevated endometrial risk for
cadmium exposure was also observed among those diagnosed with Type I endometrial carci-
noma (n = 550) compared to controls (OR: 1.21 95% CI 1.03–1.47). Women diagnosed with
endometrial carcinoma who were also 50 pounds over ideal weight had an increased endome-
trial cancer risk for cadmium exposure (S2 Table). When we re-ran the model and did not
include current smoking, cadmium concentration remained statistically significant (OR: 1.19,
95% CI: 1.01–1.41) (S3 Table). A similarly elevated endometrial risk for cadmium exposure
was also observed when we re-ran the model and include two additional established risk fac-
tors, age of menarche and number of live births, (S4 Table). We also re-ran the model and
included creatinine concentration as a separate covariant and base-2 logarithm of unadjusted
cadmium concentration. Cadmium concentration remained statistically significant (S5 Table).
Discussion
In this population-based case-control study of Midwestern U.S. women, we found a statisti-
cally significant positive association between urine cadmium levels and endometrial cancer

 risk. Specifically, a 22% increased risk of endometrial cancer was associated with doubling cad-
mium exposure. Our confidence in the findings is strengthened by our large number of cases,
evaluation of those who declined to participate at various points in our study, use of popula-
tion-based controls that were age-matched to cases, inclusion of a reliability study, the use of
urine as the biomarker to ascertain lifetime cadmium exposure, additional analyses to account
for potential bias, and using an established protocol for urine analysis with an additional cor-
rection factor.
To our knowledge, this is the first published report on cadmium exposure and endometrial
cancer risk using urine as a biomarker for cadmium measurement. Four other cohort studies
conducted in Japan, Denmark, Sweden, and the United States have reported on this associa-
tion; all have estimated cadmium exposure using food frequency questionnaires with mixed
results. Eriksen et al reported a null finding for cadmium exposure and risk of endometrial
cancer (192 endometrial cancer cases over 13 year period) using a Danish population-based
prospective study as did Sawada in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study
(75 endometrial cancer cases over 9 year period) [20,34]. The Women’s Health Initiative has
also reported a null finding on cadmium exposure and endometrial cancer (1198 endometrial
cancer cases over 10 year period) [21]. In contrast, Akesson et al reported an increased endo-
metrial cancer risk (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04–1.86) among the Swedish Mammog-
raphy Cohort comprised of postmenopausal women (378 endometrial cancer cases over 16
year period) [1]. In a meta-analysis of dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk, Cho reported
an increase cancer risk among studies with Western populations (RR: 1.15; 95% CI 1.08–1.23)
particularly for hormone-related cancers (prostate, breast and endometrial) though only two
of the aforementioned four cohort studies were included in Cho’s meta-analysis [22]. One
recent cancer mortality study using NHANES III data (1988–1994) and creatinine adjusted
urinary cadmium found a suggestion of an increased risk for uterine cancer among those with
highest level of urinary Cd (n = 7 deaths, mean follow-up 14 years; adjusted hazard ratio
(aHR): 1.03; 95% CI 0.23–4.62 and aHR per 2-fold urinary Cd: 1.63; 95% CI 1.06–2.51) [35].
After humans ingest or inhale cadmium, the body excretes only a very small fraction and
efficiently retains the rest [7]. Among the potential matrices used to measure cadmium (blood,
nail, hair, urine), urine specimens more closely reflect lifetime cadmium exposure than the
other matrices [11]. Although not without criticism [36], using creatinine-adjusted values in
the field of toxicology for spot urine samples, such as in this study, is common and several
papers support this analytic technique [37]. For example, the Jaffe
´ reaction may cause overesti-
mation of creatinine, as mentioned in National Health and Nutrition Examination material
[38]. Barr et al suggest using urinary creatinine as an independent variable which allows for
urinary dilution and demographic difference adjustment [39]. When we included the base-2
logarithm of unadjusted cadmium concentration and creatinine concentration in our model,
results were essentially unchanged from those reported in Table 2. Our unadjusted geometric
mean of cadmium was slightly higher (0.32, 95% CI: 0.31–0.34 μg/l) than those reported from
1999–2010 NHANES for women age 20–85 years (0.25, 95% CI: 0.24–0.26 μg/l), though this
may reflect a different age structure between these two samples. As noted by Adams and New-
comb, urinary cadmium values for those aged 60–69 years was 2.7 fold greater compared to
those 20–29 years old [40].
Cadmium levels are related to level of smoking. Heavy smokers may have twice as much
cadmium, and moderate smokers’ cadmium burden may increase by approximately sixty per-
cent compared to non-smokers [9]. Former smokers have a cadmium body burden that is
intermediate [24,41]. Smoking has been shown to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer,
likely through endometrial atrophy [42]. However, Brinton and others suggest that smoking in
conjunction with use of exogenous estrogens significantly multiplies the risk of developing

 endometrial cancer, especially in thin women [43]. Unfortunately we did not have a sufficient
number of thin smokers to confirm this finding and only 6.5% of cases were smokers.
With our extensive survey we were able to consider numerous variables that are known or
suspected to increase the risk of endometrial cancer in the logistic regression models. Well
documented endometrial cancer risk factors include late menopause, early menarche, nullipar-
ity, and obesity [14]. Among these risk factors, obesity is strongly associated with an increased
endometrial cancer risk [43]. Davies et al suggests this is especially true for those who are 50
pounds or heavier than their ideal weight [44]. Additional risk factors that may be associated
with endometrial cancer risk include hypertension [45], family history of cancers (breast,
endometrial, ovarian, and/or Lynch’s syndrome) [46], history of endometriosis [47], sleep
[48], irregular work schedule [49], uterine fibroids [50], alcohol consumption [51], and dietary
choices [52], such as milk consumption [53]. We explored the risk of endometrial cancer and
consumption of protein shakes. Besides the typical consumption of milk as part of the protein
shake, undeclared anabolic androgenic steroids are found in up to 15% of commercially avail-
able non-hormonal supplements (i.e., protein drinks) [54]. Though no data are available on
this consumption and endometrial cancer, one risk factor of PCOS relates to dysfunction of
androgen receptors leading to hyperandrogenism and an increased risk of endometrial cancer
[55,56]. Protective factors may be physical activity [57] and oral contraceptive use [58].
Among these risk factors, we found obesity, late age of menopause, selected dietary choices
(milk and protein shakes), history of ovarian cancer or endometriosis, and family history of
endometrial cancer as characteristics that increased the risk of endometrial cancer. In our
analysis, years of oral contraceptive use, years of unopposed estrogen use, history of breast can-
cer, smoking and being married were protective factors.
Several limitations should be considered in evaluating our results. One limitation was the
low participation proportion of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Obtaining consent
was a two-stage process. Each cancer registry approached eligible cancer cases and required
written consent to pass their names to the HEER study. The second stage involved verbal con-
sent upon contact by telephone by the HEER study team. Only 25%-44% of the women agreed
to let their respective cancer registry pass their names onto HEER for enrollment. The second
stage participation proportion was 89% of the eligible cases; another 1% who declined to partici-
pate answered a few questions to obtain a few details. Those not consenting at stage one were
more likely to be married or living with partner while those opting to not enroll at stage two
were less likely to be married or living with partner. Differences were also observed in racial
composition. Those not consenting to pass their names were more likely to be Black, but no dif-
ference was observed in declining to enrollment by race. Proportion of tumor grade I and II
and age of diagnoses was similar at both stage one and two among the two groups—those con-
senting and those declining to participate. Among the controls, our participation proportion
was 28%. Although we assessed some characteristics between the two groups at the time of
interview (n = 203) in our refusal sub-study, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias.
As with any case-control study, the risk of recall bias is also a limitation. All data except
information about urinary cadmium measurement and tumor characteristics for cases ere self-
reported. However, of the few questions we re-asked of participants, the concordance between
the two time periods was quite good. Nevertheless, we cannot eliminate the possibility of recall
bias.
In conclusion, our results provide evidence that cadmium may increase the risk of endome-
trial cancer, possibly through estrogenic effects. Further studies that employ urinary cadmium
as the biomarker are necessary given the weak association with estimated cadmium from die-
tary sources. A comprehensive list of suspected and known risk factors should also be collected
to fully adjust the regression models.
