BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in coordinating
care for high-risk patients through care management pro-
grams despite inconsistent results on cost reduction. Ear-
ly evidence suggests patient-centered benefits, but we
know little about how participants engage with the pro-
grams and what aspects they value.
OBJECTIVE: To explore care management program par-
ticipants’ awareness and perceived utility of program
offerings.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey administered
December 2015–January 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in a Boston-area pri-
mary care-based care management program.
MAIN MEASURES: Our main outcome was the number of
topics in which patients reported having Bvery helpful^
interactions with their care team in the past year. We
analyzed awareness of one’s care manager as an interme-
diate outcome, and then as a primary predictor of the
main outcome, along with patient demographics, years
in the program, attitudes, and worries as secondary
predictors.
KEY RESULTS: The survey response rate was 45.8%
(n = 1220); non-respondents were similar to respondents.
More respondents reported worrying about family (72.8%)
or financial issues (52.5%) than about their own health
(41.6%). Seventy-four percent reported care manager
awareness, particularly women (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01–
1.77) and those with more years in the program (OR 1.16,
95% CI 1.03–1.30). While interaction rates ranged from
19.8% to 72.4% across topics, 81.3% rated at least one
interaction as very helpful. Those who were aware of their
care manager reported very helpful interactions on more
topics (OR 2.77, 95% CI 2.15–3.56), as did women (OR
1.25, 95% CI 1.00–1.55), younger respondents (OR 0.98
for older age, 95% CI 0.97–0.99), and those with higher
risk scores (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06), preference for
deferring treatment decisions to doctors (OR 2.00, 95% CI
1.60–2.50), and reported control over their health (OR
1.67, 95% CI 1.33–2.10).
CONCLUSIONS: High-risk patients reported helpful in-
teractions with their care team around medical and social
determinants of health, particularly those who knew their
care manager. Promoting care manager awareness may
help participants make better use of the program.
KEY WORDS: high-risk care management; high cost patients; patient-
centered care; population health management.

INTRODUCTION
As provider organizations take on greater financial risk for
patients under value-based payment contracts, there is
growing focus on the highest risk patients who incur an
outsized portion of health care costs. Care management
programs have emerged as one strategy to reduce health
care costs and utilization for these patients—in particular,
through practice-based programs in which care managers
embedded in primary care or other clinical sites assist
panels of high-risk patients in managing their medical
conditions and related psychosocial problems.1,2 These
programs are predicated on trusting relationships between
patients and their care teams to help them navigate com-
plex medical and social issues.3,4 While the programs
have shown variable success at cost reduction,1,5–7 there
is limited but growing evidence of patient benefits—such
as satisfaction, quality of life, and perceived care
integration—that are worthwhile and perhaps more realis-
tic outcomes of such efforts.1,8–11 By better understanding
how patients engage with care management programs and
what they value in these interactions—the mechanisms
through which programs might improve cost and quality
outcomes—we may come closer to achieving both finan-
cial and patient-centered goals.12
Therefore, we surveyed patients participating in the Partners
HealthCare care management program, a primary care-based,
delivery system-operated program and one of the few that
have demonstrated reduced costs and utilization,8,13–15 to un-
derstand patient perspectives on high-risk care management.
We explored their attitudes about their health and how much
they worried about health, financial, and family issues. We
then investigated how many of them were able to identify the
presence of a care manager and measured the topic and per-
ceived helpfulness of the interactions they reported having

 with their care teams. We hypothesized that patients who
identified the presence of a care manager were more likely to
report helpful interactions with their care team around medical
and social determinants of health.
METHODS
Telephone-based surveys of patients enrolled in the Partners
HealthCare care management program were conducted by an
independent survey research firm between December 7, 2015
and January 26, 2016.
Study Population. We used a stratified random sample of
adult Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization,
Medicaid, and commercial plan beneficiaries under risk
contracts who had been enrolled in the program for at least 6
months prior to survey administration. Program enrollees are
18 years old or greater and are chosen using a claims-based
algorithm combined with clinician review.16
Survey Instrument. The 15-minute survey addressed the re-
spondent’s awareness of a care manager; health attitudes;
worry about health, family, and financial issues; and recollec-
tion and perception of interactions with their care team.
Patient awareness of a care manager was based on a survey
item that asked respondents if there was an individual within
their primary care practice who met the functional description
of this role. This item, which is used as a quality metric within
Partners HealthCare, was internally validated in a previous
iteration of the survey by asking respondents to name the
individual. We measured preference to leave treatment deci-
sions to one’s doctors, perception of control over one’s own
health, and level of worry about issues including health as well
as housing, bills, and caring for family members.17 We used
open-ended responses from the previous survey to delineate
eight topics of interactions that patients might value having
with their care team (Fig. 2). The wording for two of these
items was adapted from Massachusetts Health Quality Part-
ners (MHQP) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Pro-
viders and Systems (CAHPS) surveys. For each item, the
respondent was asked if anyone in his/her primary care doc-
tor’s office had done the stated task. If the answer was yes, he/
she was asked how helpful it was. If the answer was no, he/she
was asked how helpful it might be.
Survey Distribution. We called 3936 potential respondents
between December 7, 2015 and January 26, 2016. Six call
attempts were made for each individual to maximize sample
size. Surveys were conducted in English and in Spanish.
Measures. We determined baseline characteristics including
the 2016 Impact Pro Risk Score (calculated using January–
December 2015 claims) as well as area-level poverty (percent
of individuals living in the subject’s census tract with incomes
below the federal poverty level, among those for whom data
were available) and area-level education (percent of individ-
uals living in the subject’s census tract who attended any
amount of college, among those for whom data were avail-
able) from the 2008–2012 American Community Survey.18
We dichotomized each type of worry as present (Ba great
deal^ or Ba fair amount^) or absent (Bonly a little^ or Bnot at
all^). Caregiver worry was defined as reported worrying about
Bcaring for your family^ or Bthe health of a close family
member,^ while financial worry was defined as reported wor-
rying about Bpaying your bills,^ Brunning out of food or
affording food,^ or Bmaintaining your income or job.^ We
reported health control (defined as Bstrongly agree^ that BI
have control over my health^) and, separately, preference for
doctors making treatment decisions (defined as Bstrongly
agree^ that BI prefer to leave all treatment decisions to my
doctors^). Care manager awareness was defined as answering
Byes^ to the question: BIs there someone who works with your
primary care doctor who helps you with your medical care?^
Data Analysis. We calculated descriptive statistics of
respondents’ demographic and other baseline characteristics;
health attitudes; health, financial, and caregiver worries;
awareness of their care manager; and the receipt and
perceived or anticipated helpfulness of various topics of
interactions with the care team. Confidence intervals were
calculated using standard error. To evaluate differences
between respondents and non-respondents, we used chi-
square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous
variables.
We first analyzed care manager awareness as an intermedi-
ate outcome. We then examined awareness of the care man-
ager as a primary predictor and time in the program, health
worry, financial worry, and caregiver worry as secondary
predictors of our main outcome: the number of issues about
which patients reported having Bvery helpful^ interactions
with their care team (range 0–8). For the binary outcome
assessing awareness of the care manager, we performed bivar-
iate analyses using the t-test for continuous variables and the
chi-square test for dichotomized variables. For the ordinal
outcome measuring the number of very helpful interactions,
we used univariate ordinal logistic regression models.
Models. We built a logistic regression model to determine the
adjusted effects on care manager awareness of sex, age,
insurer, risk score, preference to defer health decisions,
health control, health, financial, and caregiver worry, and
time in the program. We then created an ordinal logistic
regression model to examine the effect of care manager
awareness on the number of very helpful interaction topics
while controlling for gender, age, insurance type, risk score,
preference to defer health decisions, health control, health,
financial, and caregiver worry, and time in the program.

 All analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 for Win-
dows (STATA Corp., College Station, TX). All reported
p values are two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The primary purpose of the Partners
HealthCare care management program patient survey was to
improve care quality; secondary research use of the data was
approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board. The
study had no external funding source.
RESULTS
We achieved a 45.8% response rate based on the American
Association for Public Opinion Research RR3 definition
(n = 1220);19 38 patients who were discharged from the
program prior to the beginning of the survey period were
subsequently excluded from this analysis (n = 1182). Non-
respondents did not differ significantly from respondents by
sex, age, race, area-level poverty and education, or risk score
(Table 1). Eight percent of analyzed surveys were completed
by proxies (94, 8.0%).
Demographics, Attitudes, and Worries. Respondents were
predominantly female, white, and enrolled in Medicare
(Table 1). Their ages ranged from 25 to 104 years old.
Over one-third (39.3%) of respondents said that they
prefer to leave all treatment decisions to their doctors,
while 64.2% reported feeling in control of their health.
More respondents reported worrying about a family mem-
ber’s health or taking care of family (72.8%) or about
financial issues such as bills, maintaining income, or
affording food (52.5%) than about their own health
(41.6%). No respondents reported worrying exclusively
about their own health (Fig. 1).
Care Manager Awareness. Nearly three quarters (73.7%)
of patients reported someone fitting the description of a
care manager (Table 2). Women (1.33; 95% CI 1.01–
1.75) and those with more time in the program (1.16
per year; 95% CI 1.03–1.30) had higher odds of
identifying a care manager in adjusted analyses. In
bivariate analyses, those who reported health and
caregiver worry also had higher odds of identifying a
care manager, but these effects were not significant in
the multivariable model.

 Interactions with Care Team. The percentage of respondents
reporting a given topic of interaction in the previous year
ranged from 19.8% to 72.4% (Fig. 2). Eighty-one percent
(81.3%) reported at least one topic of Bvery helpful^ interac-
tion with their care team; respondents reported such interac-
tions on an average of three out of eight possible topics.
Patients who identified the presence of a care manager were
more likely to recall interactions in each of the topics (data not
shown) and had significantly greater odds (2.77; 95% CI
2.15–3.56) of reporting very helpful interactions across more
topics when controlling for covariates (Table 3). Women,
younger patients, and respondents with higher risk score as
well as those who reported health control and preference to
defer treatment decisions also had greater odds of reporting
more of these interactions. In bivariate analysis, Medicaid
patients had greater odds of reporting very helpful interactions,
but this result was no longer significant in the multivariate
model. In a secondary analysis, we found that this effect was
explained by younger age and higher odds of financial and
health worry among Medicaid patients compared to Medicare
beneficiaries.
DISCUSSION
We found that patients in a high-risk care management pro-
gram reported very helpful interactions with their care team
around core program features such as post-hospitalization
follow-up and addressing barriers to self-care, although there
were some missed opportunities for engagement. Those who
were aware of their care manager were more likely to report
very helpful interactions with the care team across more
topics.
Program participants were enrolled primarily on the basis of
their medical cost and complexity, yet notably, no respondent
worried exclusively about their own health and they were
more likely to report worrying about family members or about
financial issues. These findings substantiate previous studies
showing that high cost patients tend to have greater unmet
resource needs20 and lower socioeconomic status.21–25 These
challenges, in turn, may make it more difficult for individuals
to address health issues or navigate the health system.17,20,26–28
Responses to questions about worry may not only reflect health
and socioeconomic realities but also the respondents’ propensity
to worry, a trait that seems to be independent of anxiety and
depression.29 Whatever the underlying cause, the marked preva-
lence of these worries emphasizes the need for care management
programs to help patients address such issues. These findings also
highlight the idea that patients’ priorities may not align with those
perceived or focused on by their clinicians and that collaborative
goal setting with patients may be an important strategy to im-
prove outcomes.27
Awareness of the Care Manager. Most respondents reported
that there was Bsomeone who works with your primary care
doctor who helps you with your medical care^—suggesting
that they could identify the individual and found his or her role
helpful. This question serves as an institution-wide quality
metric—a marker of the relationship upon which the program
is based—and the proportion responding yes rose by 10%
from the previous year. In our survey, participants enrolled in
the program for longer durations were more likely to answer
Byes,^ perhaps reflecting greater opportunity to become
acquainted with their care managers; women were also more
likely to identify a care manager.
Interactions. Previous work has found that patients in care
management programs are 1.3 to 2.6 times more likely than
non-enrollees to recall receiving education on topics such as
diet, exercise, and medication administration; in most of the
programs studied, the majority of participants recalled having
such discussions and receiving help from their care teams, but
it was not clear if they found them helpful.5 In our study, most

 patients reported at least one very helpful interaction and an
average of three such interactions. Still, our findings suggest
that there were missed opportunities for patient engagement
around topics such as opportunities for lower cost medications
or supplies. With the exception of follow-up after visiting the
emergency department or hospital, which is contingent on
having had such a visit in the past year, all eight interaction
topics would be applicable to any high-risk patient.
These interactions represent the mechanisms by which care
management programs might achieve improved quality and
cost outcomes for patients.30 One of the distinguishing fea-
tures of two care management programs showing early suc-
cess was patient self-report of being taught how to take their
medications.5 In a follow-up study, successful programs were
more likely to feature (1) care managers who played the role of
communication coordinator, (2) strong evidence-based patient
education, (3) comprehensive medication management, and
(4) attention to post-hospitalization transitions6—all topics
that respondents in our study reported to be helpful.
Not surprisingly, those who reported awareness of their care
manager were more likely to report helpful interactions with
their teams: care managers likely play a role in these interac-
tions, whether as leaders or facilitators. Patients with stronger
connections to their care managers may have more of these
important interactions, or conversely it may be that patients
got to know their care managers through the interactions. A
third factor—such as patient cognitive function—may explain
both care manager awareness and recollection of helpful
interactions.
Women were more likely to be aware of their care managers
and to report more helpful interactions—in line with studies
showing that female patients tend to seek out and use more
Fig. 2 Frequency and Reported Helpfulness of Interactions. For each of the items, the respondent was asked if anyone in his or her primary
care doctor’s office had done the stated task in the last 12 months. If the answer was yes, he or she was asked how helpful it was. If the answer
was no, he/she was asked how helpful it might be in the future. We included Bdo not know^ responses as BNo, would be somewhat or not at all
helpful.^ We did not include Brefused^ responses; total respondents for each sub-question ranged from 1174 to 1181. *Adapted from

 health care services than men, including more medical visits,
and report higher satisfaction with care.31,32 This may also
reflect the positive impact of gender concordance in building
relationships, given that approximately 95% of care managers
in the Partners program are female. Younger patients and those
with greater medical complexity were also more likely to
report very helpful interactions across topics, perhaps
reflecting greater need for these services. We also found that
patients who reported control over their health as well as those
who preferred to leave treatment decisions to their doctors had
higher odds of reporting very helpful interactions across more
topics. These associations might be mediated by factors such
patients’ ability to express and advocate for their needs during
an interaction or by patients’ trust in their doctors or in the
health system. Interestingly, a previous study found that hos-
pitalized patients who preferred to defer medical decisions had
shorter lengths of stay and lower hospitalization costs.33
Finally, while our study was underpowered with respect
to Medicaid enrollment, these patients were disproportion-
ately likely to know their care manager and, in bivariate
analysis, had statistically significant greater odds of
reporting more helpful interactions, suggesting that these
patients may particularly benefit from care management.
This is particularly notable given the recent emergence of
Medicaid Accountable Care Organization pilot programs
in Massachusetts and elsewhere.
Implications. Though it is impossible to show causality in this
study design, the association between care manager awareness
and the number of very helpful interactions does support the
hypothesis that an intervention that strengthens patients’
relationships with their care manager may help them make
better use of the program. This finding is consistent with
previous studies showing that successful care management
programs are more likely to feature frequent face-to-face in-
teractions between care managers and patients.6 An interven-
tion such as an introductory video series might similarly help
patients get to know their care managers and has since been
employed at some program sites.34 In addition, our study
suggests that patient attributes such as preference to defer
treatment decisions or sense of health control may help to
identify candidates who will most benefit from these
resource-intensive programs.3
Limitations. These results should be interpreted in the context
of the study’s limitations. The survey focused on the care
management program of a single health system, albeit one
that represents one of a few successful care management
models and spans several care settings including two
quarternary care hospitals and numerous community-based
primary care sites and community health centers.8,13,15 Our
response rate was somewhat low, though not unusually so for
a patient survey in a high-risk population.35 Furthermore, we
found nonsignificant differences between respondents and
non-respondents across most demographic categories, sug-
gesting limited non-response bias.36 Respondents were more
likely than non-respondents to be Medicare beneficiaries and
to have spent less time in the program, so our findings may
disproportionately represent these groups.
Due to the cross-sectional design, we cannot make causal
inferences about the associations that we observed. We as-
sumed stability of responses about worries and health atti-
tudes, though some aspects of worry such as food security
may be dynamic in the course of a year. We used generic
terminology to ask respondents if they were aware of their care
manager because this role has differing titles across care
management program sites; this may have biased our esti-
mates in either direction. Respondents may have difficulty
remembering interactions over the past year, so we may un-
derestimate interaction rates; however, at most 5.4% of re-
spondents answered BI do not know^ to any of these ques-
tions. Finally, the hybrid claims and clinician-based patient
selection methodology used in the Partners HealthCare care
management program may skew our sample in favor of pa-
tients who are perceived as either engaged or having needs
likely to be met by the program,16 limiting the generalizability
of our study to programs with a similar selection approach.
However, to our knowledge, most programs employ this ap-
proach, mitigating this limitation.37
Despite these limitations, this study robustly addresses the
patient-centered outcomes of care management interventions
that may serve as more proximal and meaningful outcomes of
such programs than reductions in cost and utilization.
Conclusion. We found that respondents worried much
more about financial and caregiver issues than about

 their own health, reinforcing the socioeconomic burdens
felt by high-risk patients and the need for programs to
address these issues. As with any intervention, it is
important to ensure that care management programs pro-
vide patients with services that they themselves want and
find to be useful. Most participants in our survey found
interactions with the care team very helpful across sev-
eral topics, particularly if they were aware of their care
managers, suggesting that strengthening these relation-
ships may improve the patient-centered outcomes that
are meaningful and realistic goals of high-risk care
management.
