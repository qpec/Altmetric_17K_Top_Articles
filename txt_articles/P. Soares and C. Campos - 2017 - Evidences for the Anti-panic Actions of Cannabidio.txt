Abstract: Background: Panic disorder (PD) is a disabling psychiatry condition that affects 
approximately 5% of the worldwide population. Currently, long-term selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for PD; however, the common side-effect profiles and drug 
interactions may provoke patients to abandon the treatment, leading to PD symptoms relapse. 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is the major non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant with anti-
anxiety properties that has been suggested as an alternative for treating anxiety disorders. The aim of the 
present review was to discuss the effects and mechanisms involved in the putative anti-panic effects of 
CBD.  
Methods: electronic database was used as source of the studies selected selected based on the studies 
found by crossing the following keywords: cannabidiol and panic disorder; canabidiol and anxiety, 
cannabidiol and 5-HT1A receptor).  
Results: In the present review, we included both experimental laboratory animal and human studies that 
have investigated the putative anti-panic properties of CBD. Taken together, the studies assessed clearly 
suggest an anxiolytic-like effect of CBD in both animal models and healthy volunteers.  
Conclusions: CBD seems to be a promising drug for the treatment of PD. However, novel clinical trials 
involving patients with the PD diagnosis are clearly needed to clarify the specific mechanism of action of 
CBD and the safe and ideal therapeutic doses of this compound. 
Keywords: Animal models, cannabidiol, human studies, 5-HT1A receptors, panic disorder, serotonin.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric 
disorder that is characterised by unexpected and recurrent 
panic attacks and affects approximately 0.8-5% of all people 
worldwide and may vary according to socio-demographic 
factors [
1]
. PD patients experience psychosocial impairment 
and a high risk of psychiatric co-morbidities and suicide [
2]
. 
In the early 1960s, Donald Klein described the efficacy of 
the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine in blocking panic 
attacks [
3]
. Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) are the first-line compounds in the treatment of PD, 
although other drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants and 
highly potent benzodiazepines, are also indicated. Less than 
half of the patients who suffer from PD show complete and 
sustained remission of the symptoms after long-term 
treatments with the currently available treatments [
2]
. This 
apparent discrepancy might be due to genetic variations in 
PD etiology that could affect the pharmacological responses

and side effects [
2]
. Thus, the development of more effective 
drugs with a better pharmacological profile than the current 
ones used to treat this psychiatric condition is needed. 
 
Over the last two decades, the therapeutic potential of 
cannabinoids has been extensively studied. Although 
cannabis abuse is connected to marked anxiety, panic 
attacks, depersonalisation, and emotional liability (primarily 
due to the psychotropic effects of ∆
9-THC) [
4
]
, a growing 
body of evidence suggests that non-psychotomimetic 
phytocannabinoids could be useful as therapeutic tools. The 
most promising of these compounds is cannabidiol (CBD), 
the major non-psychotomimetic constituent of Cannabis 
sativa. Different from the endogenous ligands anandamide 
and 2-arachidonylglycerol act as agonists of CB1/
CB2 
receptors [
5, 6]
, CBD has a very low affinity for these 
receptors in vitro [
7, 8]
 but it can facilitate endocannabinoid 
signalling by inhibiting the cellular uptake and enzymatic 
hydrolysis of endocannabinoids [
7]
. Finally, CBD can also 
promote the blockade of adenosine uptake or act as an 
agonist of vanilloid (TRPV1) or 5-HT1A serotonergic 
receptors [
9-12]
. Pre-clinical studies have shown that 
systemically administered CBD induces anxiolytic-like 
effects in several animal models that have been associated

with generalised anxiety (GAD), such as the elevated plus 
maze (EPM), the Vogel conflict test and aversive 
conditioning [
7]
. Reinforcing these findings, human studies 
have suggested that the drug decreases generalised anxiety 
symptoms [
7]
. The specific effects and the relevance of each 
of these mechanisms for the putative anti-panic effects of 
CBD are discussed in this review. MEDLINE/

(www.pubmed.com) electronic database was used as source 
of the studies selected for this review (from 1990 to July 
2015). Works were selected based on the studies found by 
crossing the following keywords: cannabidiol and panic

2. 
ANTI-PANIC 
EFFECTS 
OF 
CBD 
IN 
HUMANS 
 
In humans, responses related to PD have been assessed in 
both healthy volunteers and panic patients submitted to 
controlled conditions of psychological or chemical-nature 
stimuli [
15, 16]
. For instance, in the simulated public 
speaking (SPS) test, the participant must prepare a speech 
and talk in front of a video camera [
17]
. Indices of anxiety 
and other emotional states during the test are obtained by 
applying scales, such as the Visual Analog Mood Scale 
(VAMS; [
17]
) and the Self-Statements during Public 
Speaking Scale [
18]
. 
 
Fear of public speaking is accepted to increase anxiety in 
healthy people, irrespective of their trait anxiety level [
16]
. 
Classical benzodiazepines decrease the VAMS indices 
before and after the speech, without affecting speech 
preparation or performance (which is associated with “fear 
of 
speaking”). 
Conversely, 
speech 
preparation 
and 
performance are reduced by antidepressants [
15]
. Based on 
pharmacological studies, it has been proposed that the neural 
networks activated by SPS are involved in anxiety disorders 
[
16]
 and, thus, that the fear of speaking provoked by the SPS 
test can be helpful in understanding the brain areas involved 
and potential new drugs targets for PD. 
 
Regarding CBD, the work of Zuardi and coworkers [
14
]
 
showed that a single dose of CBD (300 mg, p.o.) decreased 
anxiety after the SPS test in healthy volunteers. In another 
study, Bergamaschi et al. [
19]
 showed that social anxiety 
disorder patients presented higher anxiety, cognitive 
impairment and discomfort, as well as increased alertness 
during their speech performance when compared with 
healthy controls. After CBD (600 mg, p.o.) treatment, 
however, a significant reduction in anxiety-related measures 
obtained during their speech performance was observed. 
These results have encouraged new approaches in the study 
of the putative effects of CBD on PD. 
3. 
EFFECTS 
OF 
CBD 
IN 
ANIMAL 
MODELS 
 
Animal models of panic attacks are supported by the 
observation of Blanchard and co-workers that, depending on 
the presence or absence of the predator and its distance from 
the prey, animals display different defensive strategies [
20]
. 
According to this hypothesis, panic attacks would be related 
to the flight and freezing defensive responses elicited by 
proximal threats. Thus, the flight/
escape and freezing 
responses generated by a stimuli, such as natural predators, 
open/
unprotected spaces and electrical/
chemical stimulation 
of brain areas (such as the dorsal periaqueductal grey 
(dPAG) or the medial hypothalamus), have been used to 
study several aspects of PD [
21]
. 
 
For instance, the encounter between the mouse and the 
wild snake Epicrates cenchria crassus elicited several 
defensive behaviours. Of note, the acute administration of 
CBD (0.3-30 mg/
Kg, i.p.) decreased the expression of panic-
related behaviours, such as defensive immobility, explosive 
escape and total escape of the mice [
22]
. 
 
The anti-panic effect of CBD was also observed in rats 
submitted to the open arm of the elevated T-maze or to the 
electrical stimulation of the dPAG. The local administration 
of CBD (30–60 nmol, intra-dPAG) inhibited the escape 
response generated by both tests [
23]
. Recently, the effects 
of CBD on experimental PD were reinforced by Campos and 
colleagues [
24
]
, who demonstrated that the chronic (5 
mg/
kg, i.p., 21 days), but not acute (5, 10 and 20 mg/
kg, 
i.p.), peripheral administration of CBD was able to reduce 
the escape response of rats submitted to the elevated T-maze. 
These latter studies also provided new evidence regarding 
the brain sites and mechanisms involved in the anti-panic 
effects of CBD.

MECHANISMS

THE

OF 
CBD 
ON 
PANIC 
4.1. 
Brain 
Sites 
 
Although the network involved in the anti-panic effects 
of CBD remain largely unknown, both preclinical and 
clinical studies have suggested some brain areas related to 
panic disorder [
16, 25]
 as possible sites for the therapeutic 
actions of this compound (Table 1, Fig. 1). 
 
Structural differences have been described in the 
amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulated cortex 
and parahippocampal gyrus of PD patients [
26]
. Functional 
magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed the 
activation of the amygdala during spontaneous panic attacks 
[
27-29]
. Other neuroimaging studies have presented increased 
activity in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and posterior 
cingulated cortex in PD patients or during panic anticipation 
[
25]
. These results indicate the amygdala, hippocampus, 
hypothalamus and cingulate cortex as possible brain sites for 
the panicolytic action of CBD. Crippa and colleagues [
30]
 
conducted a functional neuroimaging study to investigate the 
brain areas recruited after CBD administration in humans.  
A single dose of CBD, administered orally in Healthy 
volunteers, promoted a reduction in anxiety evoked by a 
tracer injection and scanning procedure. CBD also altered 
resting activity in limbic and paralimbic brain areas. Of note, 
CBD decreased the activity of the left amygdala-hippocampal 
complex, hypothalamus and posterior cingulated cortex 
while increasing the activity of the left parahippocampal 
gyrus compared with placebo. 
 
Regarding the parahippocampal gyrus, although its 
deactivation has been observed after panic attacks induced 
by lactate [
31]
 or cholecystokinin-4
 [
32]
, spontaneous panic 
attacks have also been associated with the activation of this 
area [
25]
. Because the study of Crippa and colleagues [

was conducted in healthy volunteers, it would be of interest 
to test whether CBD would also alter the activity of those 
limbic and paralimbic areas in PD patients. 
 
In healthy volunteers treated with CBD and submitted to 
a model of the presentation of fearful faces, a decreasing of 
the amygdala and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex 
activities and a disruption in the connections between the 
amygdala and the anterior cingulated cortex were observed 
[
13, 33]
. Interestingly, previous studies have suggested that 
the anterior cingulated cortex is connected to the amygdala 
in response to fear and anxiety [
30]
, suggesting these brain 
areas as candidates for the action of CBD on PD. However, 
as noted by Kowal and colleagues [
35]
, the effects of CBD 
on anterior cingulate cortex activity might depend on the 
nature of the task used in imaging studies. While verbal 
paired associate learning is associated with cognition, facial 
expressions task seems to be more related to emotion. These 
different tasks might differently recruit cingulate cortex. 
Thus, the effects of CBD in this area might be dependent on 
the task (emotion vs cognition). In addition to the attenuation 
of anterior cingulate cortex activity [
13, 33]
, other studies 
have failed to detect changes in the activity of the anterior 
cingulate cortex by CBD [
36- 38]
. 
 
These apparent discrepancies, however, could be 
explained by the fact that CBD may increase the activity in a 
brain area depending on the stimuli presented to the 
volunteers and on the anxiety disorder under observation. 
Preliminary data involving generalized social anxiety 
disorder patients suggested that CBD decreased VAMS 
anxiety scores with a concomitant reduction in the left 
parahippocampal gyrus activation and an increase in the 
right posterior cingulate gyrus activation, in contradistinction 
to the previously described results [
30]
. According to the 
authors, these discrepancies might be related to differences 
in the activity of the parahippocampal gyrus and cingulated 
gyrus in healthy individuals versus patients with anxiety 
disorders [
39]
.

Imaging studies have also demonstrated that CBD can 
alter the activity of brain areas such as the medial and left 
temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex and insula [
36, 4
0]
, regions 
that were also found to be modified in PD patients [
25]
. 
Moreover, the participation of other brain structures also 
related to PD [
4
1]
, such as the midbrain areas, caudal pons 
and medulla, on the anti-panic effects of CBD cannot be 
ruled out. However, these brain areas are significantly smaller, 
and the detection of small alterations during neuroimaging 
studies could be difficult [
4
2]
. One example of a small area 
that is strongly related to panic responses is the dPAG [
4
2]
. 
Previous studies conducted in humans demonstrated that 
midbrain stimulation, which was evaluated many years ago 
while attempting to produce pain relief in patients, induced 
neurovegetative changes (such as increases in the heart beat 
and respiratory frequency), followed by feelings of imminent 
death and suffocation, which is very similar to a panorama 
described by patients during a panic attack [
4
3]
. 
 
Aiming to investigate the role of dPAG in the 
panicolytic-like effect of CBD, Soares and colleagues [
23]
 
injected different doses of CBD (30–60 nmol, 0.2 μL) into 
the dPAG and successfully inhibited escape responses 
generated in two animal models: the electrical stimulation of 
the dPAG and the exposure to the open arm of the elevated 
T-maze. In addition, the anti-panic effects of the chronic 
treatment of CBD, observed in animals tested in the 
elevated-T maze, are mediated by serotonergic mechanisms 
located in the dPAG [
24
]
. 
4.2. 
Pharmacological 
Mechanisms 
of
 
CBD 
on 
PD 
 
So far, several mechanisms of action have been 
associated with CBD effects [
7]
. Although many of the 
described mechanisms are not directly connected to anxiety 
disorders, the type 1A serotoninergic receptor has been 
extensively reported to be a key partner in the anti-anxiety 
and anti-panic effects of CBD [
7, 23, 24
, 4
4
]
. 
 
In mice, the panicolytic-like effect of CBD was 
prevented by the peripheral administration of a 5-HT1A 
receptor antagonist, WAY-100635 (0.1–0.9 mg/
kg, i.p.) [
4
4
]
. 
Accordingly, in rats, intra-dPAG CBD administration 
impaired escape responses generated by the open arm of the 
elevated T-maze and by the electrical stimulation of the 
dPAG; in both cases, the effects were prevented by the 
administration of WAY-100635 (0.37 nmol) [
23]
. Later, 
Campos and coworkers [
24
]
 suggested that the panicolytic-
like effect promoted by the repeated peripheral administra- 
tion of CBD in rats was also mediated by 5-TH1A receptors 
located in the dPAG. Interestingly, the effect of CBD on the

dPAG seems to be dependent on its actions on the 5-HT1A 
receptor rather than the modulation of serotonin release  
or 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C expression, as observed after 
antidepressant treatment. 
 
In fact, the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the dPAG 
has been proposed to reduce panic-like responses and to be 
involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressants [
4
5]
. 
In addition to the dPAG, preclinical studies have noted the 
amygdala and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus as 
other brain sites for the panicolytic-like effect mediated by 
5-HT1A receptor activation [
4
6, 4
7]
. In patients with a PD 
diagnosis, studies have shown that both presynaptic and 
postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor binding is reduced in the 
anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, raphe, orbitofrontal 
cortex, temporal cortex and amygdala [
4
8]
. Other genetic 
studies propose an association between 5-HT1A receptor 
gene polymorphisms and PD [
4
9]
. 
 
CBD has been suggested to activate 5-HT1A receptors in 
several brain regions, such as the basal ganglia [
50]
, the bed 
nucleus of stria terminalis [
51]
, the prelimbic prefrontal 
cortex [
52]
 and the dorsal raphe nucleus [
53, 54
]
. Although 
the molecular mechanism by which CBD favours 5-HT1A 
activation remains unclear, it might involve the allosteric 
modulation of this receptor, the ability of CBD to facilitate 
the 5-HT1A agonist-related stimulation of [
35S]
GTPᵧS 
binding [
12]
 or the indirect recruitment or formation of 
heterodimers consisting of 5-HT1A and other receptors, such 
as CB1 [
55]
. 
 
In addition to serotonin, other mechanisms might be 
involved in the anti-panic effects of CBD. For instance, 
chronic treatment with CBD can increase the anandamide 
levels within the hippocampus with concomitant increases of 
hippocampal neurogenesis [

. CBD may also favour 
neurogenesis during the aging process by activating PPARγ 
[
57]
. Other receptors may also be involved in the actions of 
CBD, such as CB1, adenosine 1, TRPV1 and TRPA1 [
7]
. 
For instance, after chronic (21 days) treatment, CBD reduced 
5-HT2A receptor binding in the substantia nigra [
58]
 and 
increased mitochondrial complex and creatine kinase activity 
in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of rats 
[
59]
. However, the contribution of the aforementioned 
mechanisms in the anti-panic actions of CBD has yet to be 
investigated. 
5. 
CONCLUSIONS 
AND 
PERSPECTIVES: 
 
Taken together, the results presented in this chapter, 
which were derived from both laboratory animal and human 
studies, support the notion that CBD exhibits anti-panic 
properties. Despite the described panic response reported as 
a result of cannabis use, it is important to note that CBD 
does not present psychoactive effects; it is safe and well-
tolerated via the oral route (up to 1,500 mg/
day) [
19]
. 
Moreover, because this compound does not induce 
dependence, tolerance and abstinence symptoms, it can be, in 
the future, a good alternative as a substitute for high potency 
benzodiazepines and antidepressant drugs in PD patients 
who are resistant to the current treatments. However, it is 
important to stress that we are just in the first steps in the 
route to get a possible final approval of CBD for the 
treatment of PD. Several clinical trials using CBD alone or in 
combination with other cannabinoids are under development. 
The GW compound Epidolex®, that basically has CBD in its 
formula, is currently in phase 3 trial for the treatment of 
orphan pediatric epilepsy syndrome. Therefore, new studies 
conducted with a reasonable number of PD patients (phase 2 
and phase 3 studies) are necessary to demonstrate the 
efficacy and the dose range of CBD for the treatment of this 
anxiety disorder.
