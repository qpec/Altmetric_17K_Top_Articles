Uncontrollable bleeding is a major problem in surgical procedures and after major trauma.
Existing hemostatic agents poorly control hemorrhaging from traumatic arterial and cardiac
wounds because of their weak adhesion to wet and mobile tissues. Here we design a photo-
reactive
adhesive
that
mimics
the
extracellular
matrix
(ECM)
composition.
This
biomacromolecule-based matrix hydrogel can undergo rapid gelling and fixation to adhere
and seal bleeding arteries and cardiac walls after UV light irradiation. These repairs can
withstand up to 290 mm Hg blood pressure, significantly higher than blood pressures in most
clinical settings (systolic BP 60–160 mm Hg). Most importantly, the hydrogel can stop high-
pressure bleeding from pig carotid arteries with 4~ 5 mm-long incision wounds and from pig
hearts with 6 mm diameter cardiac penetration holes. Treated pigs survived after hemostatic
treatments with this hydrogel, which is well-tolerated and appears to offer significant clinical
advantage as a traumatic wound sealant.

ncontrollable bleeding following trauma or occurring
during surgery is a major cause of global mortality1. In
particular, repair of aortic rupture and stemming heart
bleeding from cardiac penetration wounds are difficult surgical
challenges. Currently, surgical suture is the only clinical method
for aortic rupture and heart wound sealing; however, this is not
feasible outside surgical units and is not attempted in most
emergency situations2. With recent progress in materials science,
many experimental chemical agents have been tested for rapid
wound sealing, such as fibrin glue, gelatin, collagen, oxidized
cellulose, zeolites, peptides, polymers, and hydrogels3–9. However,
none of these materials are suitable for aortic and heart trauma
hemostasis and sealing because of their slow hemostatic perfor-
mance, poor wet tissue surface adhesion, and weak or inflexible
bonding mechanics.
Rapid hemostasis for cardiac and arterial breeches requires fast
adhesion in the presence of continuous blood flow, strong
adhesion between wet tissue walls and surfaces, high mechanical
strength to maintain blood pressure, and good biocompatibility
for tissue regeneration. However, it is extremely difficult to bond
wet and dynamic tissue surfaces10–12. Cyanoacrylate (CA) is a
strong adhesive and has been investigated for vascular anasto-
mosis13; however, it is cytotoxic and fails to bond wet surfaces, as
it solidifies immediately upon exposure to water10. Although a
few studies have reported that other artificial polymers can adhere
to wet tissue surfaces, the clinical application of those materials
has been limited due to either their long gelling time, inflexibility,
or toxic degradation products10,14,15.
Here we report a biomimetic tissue adhesive product that can
polymerize and adhere within seconds, and strongly bond to wet
biological tissue surfaces after UV photo-activation. The product
design has been inspired by consideration of the extracellular
matrix composition of biological connective tissues. These are
generally made of collagen (10–15%), glycosaminoglycans (3–6%),
and water (70–80%), and have strong and flexible bio-mechanical
properties16. The matrix hydrogel bio-adhesive used here was
composed of 5% methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), 1.25% N-(2-
aminoethyl)−4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)−2-methoxy-5-nitrosophe-
noxy) butanamide (NB) linked to the glycosaminoglycan hya-
luronic acid (HA-NB)17 with 0.1% of the polymerization initiator
lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP).
The chosen ratio of GelMA:HA-NB in our candidate product is
similar to that of collagens to glycosaminoglycans of human
connective tissue. In a previous study, this class of HA-NB
polymer matrices has shown good tissue fusion and integration,
probably due to UV photo-generated aldehyde groups bonding
with the amino groups on the tissue surface17. However, in this
prototype gel, it took more than 20 s for HA-NB to polymerize
with other primary amino-bearing macromolecules and unpoly-
merized material was easily washed away by blood flow before a
bonded gel could be formed. The introduction of a GelMA
component into the hydrogel maintains its capacity for wet
wound sealing and accelerates polymerization by an order of
magnitude, thus greatly increasing the clinical utility of this
wound sealing hydrogel.
Results
Matrix gel synthesis and its physical characterization. The
matrix hydrogel bio-adhesive used here was composed of 5%
GelMA, 1.25% NB linked to the HA-NB17 with 0.1% of the
polymerization initiator LAP. We selected these precursor and
relative composition ratios in a prior series of optimization and
characterization studies on the chemistry and mechanical prop-
erties of biomimetic matrix hydrogels (see Supplementary Fig. 1
and Supplementary Table 1).
Figure 1a illustrates the chemistry involved in the generation
of the hydrogel from HA-NB and GelMA. To overcome the
problem of slow polymerization/adhesion, a relatively low-level
substituted GelMA (see Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplemen-
tary Table. 1) was chosen, as it will rapidly photo-crosslink
internally, while leaving some amino groups available to react
with photo-generated aldehyde groups17. An ~3.27% substitution
level of disaccharides was found to be an optimum compromise
between gel strength and important factors such as solubility and
biocompatibility (Supplementary Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table. 1,
and Supplementary Fig. 1). We found that gels formed in less
than a second when exposed to UV (365 nm, 30 mW/cm2)
(Fig. 1b). To monitor the gelling process, an in situ, dynamic
time-sweep rheological experiment was carried out with a photo-
rheometer. As shown in Fig. 1b–d, the gel point was reached at
1.384 ± 0.0006 s for GelMA/HA-NB with LAP, similar to the
1.384 ± 0.001 s gel point for GelMA alone with LAP. These are
much faster gelling points than the 32.1 ± 1.54 s for GelMA/HA-
NB without LAP. The final torsion modulus (twisting shear
resistance) after complete gelation is 3183 ± 71 Pa also much
larger than the shear resistance of 547 ± 40 Pa for GelMA/HA-NB
hydrogels without added LAP and the shear resistance of 475 ±
14 Pa for GelMA with LAP alone (Fig. 1c). These results indicate
that the double-network structure of UV-crosslinked GelMA and
Schiff bases greatly strengthened the hydrogel, primarily by
increasing the degree of internal crosslinking.
The hydrogel formed was porous. The cryo-scanning electron
microscopy (cryo-SEM)-observed pore size of GelMA/HA-NB
with LAP was nanoscale, smaller, and denser than GelMA/LAP
and GelMA/HA-NB. Furthermore, the morphology of GelMA/
HA-NB/LAP hydrogel has the characteristics of GelMA/LAP and
GelMA/HA-NB hydrogels (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This result is
consistent with the formation of two internal networks of UV-
crosslinked GelMA and Schiff bases. Maximum swelling ratios
(SRs) were reached after 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Adhesion and mechanical strength study of the matrix gel. The
adhesion strength of the hydrogel is one of the most important
factors for heart and artery hemostasis, as the hydrogel needs to
rapidly adhere to halt bleeding under arterial blood pressure. The
adhesive must both form strong bonds with the substrate and
the material composition of adhesive plus substrate must dis-
sipate energy by hysteresis10. Burst pressure tests are probably the
primary efficacy tests relevant to investigating the capacity of
these hydrogels to withstand blood pressure, while at the same
time rapidly adhering to tissue walls to seal the rupture. In Fig. 2,
the capacity of several hydrogels and commercially available
surgical glues to adhere to experimental biological surfaces and
resist bursting pressures were compared. Hydrogel were formed
in situ on the wet surface of porcine sausage skins, covering a
2 mm diameter hole in a chamber linked to a syringe pump and
filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Thirty sec-
onds after UV irradiation to polymerize the hydrogels, the syringe
pump began to pump PBS and exert pressure on the hydrogel-
sealed hole (Fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows that the measured burst
pressure of GelMA/HA-NB with LAP was 155 ± 27 mm Hg,
much higher than GelMA /HA-NB without LAP (38 ± 4 mmHg)
and GelMA with LAP (31 ± 7 mmHg). The burst pressure of the
GelMA/HA-NB with LAP casing seals was significantly higher
than the normal systolic blood pressure (120 mm Hg), which
would make it a promising sealing agent for hemostasis.
Hemostatic
performance
fundamentally
depends
on
the
weakest property of the materials used and if the adhesion force
is higher than the gel’s mechanical strength, the hydrogel could
rupture under pulsing blood pressure. In the burst pressure tests,

 we found the failure positions of GelMA/HA-NB with and
without LAP were all directly above the sealed hole (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4a). The hydrogels were punctured but were not
separated from the porcine sausage membrane. Using hydrogels
without HA-NB led to edge adhesion failures and expulsion of
the gel as a plug (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This phenomenon
indicated that the tissue adhesion strength of GelMA/HA-NB
(with and without LAP) was actually higher than its mechanical
strength. We therefore doubled the matrix component concen-
trations (to 10% GelMA, 2.5% HA-NB, and 0.2% LAP) to
enhance hydrogel mechanical strength. The burst pressure
resistance increased to 290 ± 18 mm Hg. This value significantly
exceeds the performance of all reported adhesives and commer-
cially available surgical sealants10,15,18. Two further classes of
adhesive strength tests are wound closure tests and peeling
adhesion resistance tests. Results of these additional tests are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 4b-e. In both wound-sealing and
-peeling adhesion assays, at failure, the hydrogel still adheres to
the porcine sausage membrane, but the hydrogel itself fractured.
Taken together, these material strength tests indicated that it is
critical that the adhesive hydrogel has sufficient internal strength
and capacity to form strong bonds with the tissue substrate.
More exact data directly determining the chemical composition
of the hydrogel and hydrogel–tissue interface can be achieved by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a technique more
commonly employed in material science than in medical biology.
Using XPS we detected large-scale formation of C = N bonds on
the tissue surface, which supports our hypothesis that Schiff bases
are being created at the interface between the tissue and hydrogel
(Supplementary Fig. 5). The fact that burst pressure increased
as the substitution rates of HA-NB increased also supports
this model of extensive Schiff base formation strengthening the
hydrogel’s adhesive and mechanical properties (Supplementary
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
In the process of healing, the wound and matrix gel would be
subjected to shear force and mechanical force pressure. Therefore,
we used a lap shear test and a compression test to investigate
these mechanical properties (Supplementary Fig. 6). Again, these
mechanical properties of hydrogels composed of GelMA/HA-NB
with LAP were much higher than those composed of GelMA/HA-
NB without LAP and GelMA with LAP. These results again
demonstrate that the double-network structure of UV-triggered,
crosslinked GelMA and Schiff bases significantly strengthens
the hydrogel.
Biocompatibility and biodegradation of matrix gel. Good bio-
compatibility is an essential property of hemostatic adhesives. The
cellular cytotoxicity of these hydrogels was initially evaluated by co-
incubation with L929 fibroblastic cells. The hydrogel-exposed cells
and the untreated control cell cultures grow (Supplementary
Fig. 7c). Fibroblasts were also encapsulated in situ with the hydrogel
and cultured for 5 days. The great majority of cells survived this
treatment and stained normally (Supplementary Fig. 7a). C3H cells,
which easily form spreading monolayers, attach and spread well on
the hydrogel surface after seeding, and these cells were also observed
to proliferate and migrate into the hydrogel as culture progressed
(Supplementary Fig. 7b). Finally, this hydrogel was subcutaneously
implanted in rats to assess in vivo biodegradation and local inter-
action of the implant with the animal tissue and the cellular
immune response of the host. Implanted material was excised for
assay at days 7, 14, 28, and 56. The size of the implants increased
after implantation because of initial osmotic swelling and local
inflammation, then decreased with time after implantation as the
hydrogel degraded (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c, e). The proportion of
implanted mass remaining after 7 days was 82.5 ± 5.5%, after
14 days this had diminished to 59.6 ± 6.7%, after 28 days 25.5 ±
6.7% remained, and after 56 days only 20.0 ± 5.0% remained. These
results indicate that the hydrogel progressively biodegrades (Sup-
plementary Fig. 8d).
A hemostatic agent should not compromise wound healing19
and surgical sealants, and hemostats must not be toxic or highly
inflammatory20–22. Pathological staining with hematoxylin and
eosin showed that a number of inflammatory cells appeared near
the interface of hydrogel and tissue, indicating that, as would be
expected,
a
postoperative
inflammatory
response
occurred.
However, this inflammatory response gradually disappeared,
and progressive growth and migration of non-inflammatory
dividing cells occurred within 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Similarly, more severe postoperative inflammation was observed
in a Fibrin Glue-treated group, whereas some necrosis was
observed from a CA glue-treated group (Supplementary Fig. 8).
These results indicate good biocompatibility and diminished
cytotoxicity following the hydrogel treatments.

 Sealant and hemostatic performance on rabbits and pigs. Our
first investigation of the actual in vitro hemostatic capacity of the
hydrogel on mammalian tissues used fresh pig livers to simulate
hemorrhages. The best way to present such real-time experi-
mentation is via video recordings. The hydrogel is shown to be
capable of immediately arresting puncture lesion bleeding fol-
lowing fixation by UV irradiation (Supplementary Movie 1). In a
comparative trial, commercially available fibrin glue was washed
away by the blood flow and the bleeding could not be stopped
(Supplementary Movie 2). These experimental operations vividly
demonstrate the importance of fast wound sealing and strong
adhesion to rapidly halt blood loss from wet, slippery, and mobile
mammalian organs.
In vivo hemostatic capacity tests were performed in both rabbit
and pig experimental surgery. In rabbit surgical testing, the
matrix gel could stop bleeding of a liver cut and a femoral artery
section in a few seconds. Blood losses following hydrogel sealing
were significantly less than in the untreated controls and Fibrin
Glue wound treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 9). During pig
experimental surgery, 4~ 5 mm punctures were created in the
carotid artery, resulting in arterial blood expulsion from the
puncture. Hemostatic forceps were then used to clamp the blood
vessels and hydrogel was applied, followed by UV irradiation for
3~ 5 s. After 30 s (a conservative precaution to allow complete
polymerization), the hemostatic forceps were removed and no
further blood leakage was observed (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Movie 3). Because of the vessel and tissue edema caused by injury,
the volumetric flow rate decreased after surgery; however, the
measured volumetric flow rate indicates the systemic integrity of
blood flow has been maintained (Fig. 3c).
We also used Fibrin Glue and SurgifloTM in experimental
surgical comparison (Supplementary Movie 4). In this video, it
can be seen that when the hemostatic forceps were relaxed, blood
flow out immediately when Fibrin Glue or the SurgifloTM had
been applied. When the matrix hydrogel was applied, no such
bleeding was observed after the hemostatic forceps were removed.
All hydrogel-treated pigs survived surgery and were reared for
2 weeks longer (n = 3). The hydrogel still adhered to the defect
sites after 2 weeks (Fig. 3d) and no thrombus was observed in the
vessel, as confirmed by tissue section staining (Fig. 3e). The
regeneration of the wound was incomplete, as 2 weeks is a short
healing period. However, the wound was connected by neo-
vascularized tissues, indicating that healing had commenced. This
experimental surgery vividly demonstrates that the matrix gel has
the required rapid in vivo hemostatic capacity and can protect
major wounds during the postoperative healing process.
The heart is the central organ of vertebrate circulatory
physiology and when cardiac penetration injuries occur, massive
hemorrhage results in lives being lost within a very short time.
We have been able to demonstrate that the hydrogel can be used
to close and seal cardiac penetration injuries. A high concentra-
tion matrix gel (10% GelMA, 2.5% HA-NB, 0.2% LAP) was used
in these experimental surgical procedures to withstand the high
blood pressure exerted by heart muscle.
The surgical operation procedure was illustrated in Fig. 4a,
with the ventriculus sinister of the pig heart being pierced by a
6 mm inner diameter needle, resulting in immediate high-
pressure blood expulsion (Fig. 4b). Hydrogel was immediately
injected to cover the blood hole and UV irradiated to fix and
seal the heart muscle puncture wound (Fig. 4b). Although the
puncture hole is covered by the gel, blood initially continued to
hemorrhage. However, after the UV polymerization, the bleeding
decreased rapidly and soon stopped completely (Fig. 4b). The
hemostatic process took <30 s (Supplementary Movie 5). High-
pressure ventricular bleeding occurred after the large diameter
needle was removed during some of these surgical procedures
(Supplementary Movie 6). Even in such serious cardiac wounds,
the bleeding was stopped by application of the matrix gel within
30 s (Supplementary Movie 6). In similar situations, 4 mL Fibrin
Glue and 8 mL SurgifloTM were injected to the wound, but failed
to stop such bleeding, which was only stemmed by application of
the matrix gel (Supplementary Movie 7).
Postoperative analysis of cardiac tissues after autopsy was
carried out on one pig. SEM analysis was used to investigate the
ultrastructural appearance of the zone of matrix gel adhesion to
heart tissue, immediately after experimental surgery, following
killing of one pig (Fig. 4c). The appearance of closed, effective
sealing indicates that the procedure has been successful. Three
other pigs were allowed to recover after surgery and were kept for
a further 2 weeks. The electrocardiogram of pig 2 showing no
abnormalities during the 2-week nursing period (Fig. 5a). The
heart rate of the pig was elevated slightly for the first week after
surgery, possibly caused by anesthesia and operative shock, but
had returned to normal by the second week (Fig. 5b).
The level of blood aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) rose after
surgery, indicative of the trauma caused by operations (Fig. 5e±g).
These indices returned to normal levels after 4 days of recovery.
Levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin T
(cTn-T), and CK-MB in the blood did not rise significantly,
indicating that no myocardial infarction or heart failure happened
during the 2-week recuperation period (Fig. 5c–h). This cardiac
marker analysis indicates the resumption of normal heart
function in these pigs after surgery. The hydrogel also effectively
sealed the heart wound after 2 weeks (Fig. 4d), and almost no
necrosis and very little inflammation were observed at the wound
interface in pathology section staining (Fig. 4e), confirming the
excellent biocompatibility of the matrix hydrogel.
Discussion
It is the first time that high-pressure bleeding of beating heart
with 6 mm diameter cardiac penetration holes were rapidly
stopped and the wounds were stably sealed by only using matrix
gel within 20 s without suture. Although some studies have
reported other polymer-based materials could adhere on wet
tissue surface10,14, suture is still needed for pre-closure of the
wound before closure with the material or the materials that
are not safe for clinical use, as the degradation products are toxic.
We gave these hydrogels excellent functions, e.g., fast wound
sealing, strong wet and dynamic tissue surface adhesion, suitable
mechanical properties with good biocompatibility, and, impor-
tantly, ease of use, through modification and combination of the
natural bio-macromolecules. All this is not simple to achieve.
Our data demonstrate that this synthetic gel with its con-
trollable and rapid matrix polymerization properties can rapidly
stop bleeding from cardiac penetration injuries. The effective wet-
adhesion properties of matrix gel derive from photo-generated
aldehyde groups bonding with the amino groups on the tissue
surface and its mechanical strength derives from its two internal
covalently crosslinked networks. Upon UV irradiation, the
GelMA rapidly generates the first crosslinked network elements
of the hydrogel. Meanwhile, some of the photo-generated alde-
hyde groups on HA-NB at the tissue–hydrogel interface react
with amino groups of the tissue proteins and proteoglycans,
forming Schiff bases. Meanwhile, the photo-generated aldehyde
groups on the hydrogel HA-NB react with the amino groups of
GelMA to form a second crosslinking network. As the reaction
progresses, the remaining aldehyde groups react with amino
groups of tissue and GelMA to bond tissue and increase internal
crosslinking. The creation of two different chemically crosslinked
matrices leads to a significant increase in the tissue adhesion and

 internal strength of the hydrogel23. The good wet tissue adhesion
and mechanical properties of the hydrogel would ensure its
stability in wound closure.
Maintaining porous structures in hydrogels intended to be
used as hemostatic agents is important in stopping bleeding, as
dense, porous material can absorb wound exudates and largely
block escape of red blood cells and platelets24, while maintaining
a suitably moist environment for effective wound healing25,26.
Although hydrogels will absorb water from the serum to con-
centrate red blood cells and platelets24, large SRs could com-
promise the mechanical strength of the hydrogel, causing the
hydrogel to break before wound healing can take place27. These
GelMA/HA-NB/LAP hydrogels appear to have suitable SRs,
which can meet the requirement for effective absorption of water
from serum, while maintaining mechanical sealing and protection
of the wound.
Here we need to declare that blank control in pig carotid artery
model cannot be used, because bleeding could not be stopped and
the pig would die in few minutes because of severe blood loss.
In this kind of experimental surgery, we think that comparative
quantification of the blood losses is not really possible, as the
animals would simply not survive control or inadequate treat-
ments. No more bleeding was observed in matrix gel-treated
groups in our surgical experiments but this was not the case in
the other treatment groups (Supplementary Movie 4).
For the penetrated cardiac injuries hemostatic experiments, we
have tried to use an aspirator to collect blood during the opera-
tion. However, this is a not very accurate process because it is
difficult to collect all the blood. We also weighed the pig before
and after surgery as to supplement this data, but this is also
inaccurate because unanticipated excretions happened in some
pigs during the operation. What is relevant is that most of the

 blood loss occurred before the matrix gel was used and almost
no blood was lost after the application of the matrix gel (see
Supplementary Movies 5–7). In Supplementary Movie 7, neither
Fibrin Glue nor SurgifloTM could staunch bleeding. Taking these
facts into consideration, we think true quantitative comparisons
of the blood losses are not realistically possible in these penetrated
cardiac injuries hemostasis experiments. Bleeding was staunched
in matrix gel group yet the bleeding was not controlled and
the animal would die in the Fibrin Glue, SurgifloTM-treated, and
untreated groups.
The hemostatic and wound-sealing performance of matrix
gel is significantly better than commercial Fibrin Glue and
SurgifloTM. Together with its biomimetic composition and
biocompatibility, these properties make the matrix hydrogel a
radically improved hemostatic sealant. Meanwhile, safety is
the top priority in the clinical application of biomaterials.
The matrix gel exhibit excellent biocompatibility in both
in vitro and postoperative recovery. However, these studies are
only the preliminary steps in safety testing. In further studies,
we are carrying out more in-depth research to assess whether
our hydrogel has any potential toxicity before it is applied to
humans.
Numerous attempts have been made to develop alternatives to
suturing because of the difficulty and limitations of suture tech-
niques when dealing with diseased, damaged, or small blood
vessels15,28–30. The precursor of this matrix gel has relatively low
viscosity and can be readily injected. Meanwhile, light-induced
polymerization is an accurate and convenient method that have
been widely used in dental medicine. With a UV flashlight or an
optical fiber, this material can potentially be used for completely
sutureless hemostasis and sealing, which make it a promising
bio-glue for use in surgery and emergency hemostasis.
Methods
Synthesis of NB and HA-NB. Methyl 4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)−2-methoxy-5-
nitrophenoxy)butanoate (mNB) was synthesized as follows17: 4-hydroxy-3-
methoxybenzaldehyde (vaniline) (8.90 g, 58.5 mmol, 1.06 eq.), methyl 4-
bromobutanoate (9.89 g, 55.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.), and potassium carbonate (10.2 g,
73.8 mmol, 1.34 eq.) were dissolved in N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (40 mL).
The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h, after which time the
resulting solution was poured into chilled water (200 mL) and allowed to pre-
cipitate for 15 min at 0 °C. The solid was filtered off, washed with water, redissolved
in dichloromethane, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure to yield a white solid (methyl 4-(4-formyl-2-methox-
yphenoxy)butanoate, 12.2 g, 48.4 mmol, 88 %). Methyl 4-(4-formyl-2-methox-
yphenoxy)butanoate (9.4 g, 37.3 mmol, 1 eq.) was added slowly to a pre-cooled

 (−2 °C) solution of nitric acid (70%, 140 mL) and stirred at −2 °C for 3 h. It is
important to note that—depending on the temperature of the nitration reaction—
ipso substitution of the formyl moiety occurs. The resulting solution was poured
into chilled water (500 mL) and allowed to precipitate for 15 min at 0 °C (note: as
saponification of the product can occur under these conditions, the precipitation
time should be kept as short as possible). The product was filtered, washed with
water, and dissolved in dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over mag-
nesium sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a slightly
yellow powder (methyl 4-(4-formyl-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy)butanoate, 7.7 g,
25.9 mmol, 69%). Sodium borohydride (1.50 g, 39.7 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was slowly
added at 0 °C to a solution of methyl -(4-formyl-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy)
butanoate (7.7 g, 25.9 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in EtOH/THF 1:1 v/v (100 mL). After 3 h, all
solvents were removed in vacuo and the residue was suspended in water (50 mL)
and dichloromethane (50 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted two times with
dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over
magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. In order to
increase the overall yield and to remove partially saponified products, methanol
(100 mL) and tosylic acid (50 mg) were added to the residue. The solution was
stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent was removed in vacuo and
the residue was suspended in water (50 mL) and dichloromethane (50 mL). The
aqueous layer was extracted two times with dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL) and
the combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was
removed under reduced pressure to yield a yellow solid as a raw product, which
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate =
1:1 (Rf = 0.6) and finally 5.22 g (4.81 mmol, 75%) of a slightly yellow powder mNB
were obtained.
Then mNB (0.5 g, 1.8 mmol) and ethylenediamine (1.1 mL, 2 mmol, Sigma-
Aldrich) were dissolved in methanol. The mixture was refluxed overnight until the
starting individual components were undetectable by thin layer chromatography.
After the reaction was complete, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The
crude precipitate was dissolved in methanol and re-precipitated three times using
ethyl acetate. The filter cake was then dried for 12 h at 30 °C under vacuum until
NB appeared as light yellow powder (0.4 g, 1.2 mmol, 66.7%). HA-NB was
synthesized according to a previous report17. Briefly, HA (408 mg, 1 mmol of
disaccharide unit, Dongyuan Biotech, Zhenjiang) was dissolved in 50 mL deionized
water at room temperature and NB (224 mg, 0.69 mmol) was added followed by
HOBt (153 mg, 1 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich). The pH of the mixed solution was
adjusted to pH 4.5, after which 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)–3-ethylcarbodimide
hydrochloride (200 mg, 1.04, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the mixture and stirred
for 48 h at room temperature. The solution was loaded into dialysis tubing
(Molecular Weight (MW) cutoff 3500, Spectrum®) and dialyzed against diluted
HCl (pH 3.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl for 2 days, then dialyzed against deionized
water for a further 2 days. The solution was lyophilized and HA-NB was obtained
in powder form. The substitution degree of nitrobenzyl groups (3% of HA
disaccharide units) was verified by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
Synthesis of GelMA. Type A gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS at
50 °C to make a 10% w/v homogeneous solution. Then, a 0.1 mL methacrylic
anhydride (MA) (Sigma-Aldrich) per gram of gelatin was added to the gelatin
solution at a rate of 0.5 mL/min, with continuous stirring. The mixture was allowed
to react at 50 °C for 3 h. The GelMA solution was dialyzed against deionized water
using 8–14 kDa cutoff dialysis tubing (VWR Scientific USA) for 6 days at 50 °C
to remove unreacted MA and any byproducts. The GelMA solution was frozen
overnight at −80 °C, then lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until further use31,32.
The substitution degree of MA was verified by 1H-NMR.
Synthesis of the photo-initiator. Dimethyl phenylphosphonite (Ourchem) was
reacted with 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) via a
Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction. At room temperature and under argon gas, 3.2 g
(0.018 mol) of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride was added dropwise to an equimolar
amount of continuously stirred dimethyl phenylphosphonite (3.0 g). The reaction
mixture was stirred for 18 h whereupon a fourfold excess of lithium bromide
(Aladdin, 6.1 g) in 100 mL of 2-butanone (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) was
added to the reaction mixture from the previous step, which was then heated to 50
°C. Ten minutes later, a solid precipitate had formed. The mixture was cooled to
ambient temperature, allowed to rest for 4 h, and then filtered. The filtrate was
washed and filtered three times with 2-butanone to remove unreacted lithium
bromide and excess solvent was removed by vacuum33.
Precursor preparation of the hydrogels. For precursors of GelMA/HA-NB/LAP
hydrogel, the freeze-dried GelMA foams and HA-NB foams were dissolved in PBS
solution at 40 °C, then the photo-initiator LAP was added. The final precursor is
composed of 5% GelMA, 1.25% HA-NB, and 0.1% LAP for low-concentration
matrices, and 10% GelMA, 2.5% HA-NB, and 0.2% LAP for high-concentration
matrices. For precursors of GelMA/HA-NB hydrogels, the freeze-dried GelMA
foams and HA-NB foams were dissolved in PBS solution at 40 °C to a final
concentration of 5% GelMA and 1.25% HA-NB. For precursors of GelMA/LAP
hydrogels, the freeze-dried GelMA foams were dissolved in PBS solution at 40 °C
and then added to the photo-initiator LAP to a final concentration of 5% GelMA
and 0.1% LAP.
Adhesion mechanism study. XPS (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) was used to char-
acterize the surface composition of the sausage skin membranes; skins were treated
with non-photo illuminated HA-NB and also with photo-illuminated HA-NB,
using an Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). A detailed scan for Nitrogen was carried out
with a step of 0.1 eV. The Carbon 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used for calibration.
SEM analysis. Cryo-SEM imaging was performed on a FEI Helios NanoLab 600i
Analytical Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope fitted with low-
temperature sample carrier Quaroum PP3000T, to examine the gross morphology
hydrogels. The samples were loaded on the cryo-specimen holder and cryo-fixed in
slush nitrogen (−210 °C), then quickly transferred to the cryo-stage in the frozen
state. The sample was transferred into the cryo-stage (Quorum Technologies,
PP300T, East Sussex, UK), a chamber attached to the microscope (FEI, Helios
Nanolab 600i, Hillsboro, USA). Once the sample was inside the chamber, a fracture
of the sample was made to get a fresh clean surface to be examined. The tem-
perature of the sample was raised by heating the holder to −90 °C for 30 min, in
order to increase the contrast and sublimate free-water in the solid-state lakes,
followed by a temperature decrease to −180 °C, to stabilize the sample. The surface
of the frozen preparation was then coated with platinum (10 mA, 30 s) to prevent
charging of the sample and to obtain a good relation between signal and noise. The
coated sample was thereafter transferred into the microscope chamber where it was
analyzed at a temperature range of −180 °C. To evaluate the integration of the
tissue and hydrogels, the samples were first fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for >4 h, then washed three times in phosphate
buffer for 15 min each. The samples were dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol
extractions (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100%) for 15–20 min at each step
and the dehydrated samples were coated with gold-palladium in a Hitachi E-1010
ion sputter for 4–5 min before viewing. Then the samples were observed under a
SEM (Hitachi TM-1010, Japan).
SR of the hydrogels. The GelMA/HA-NB/LAP (n = 3), GelMA/HA-NB (n = 3),
and GelMA/LAP hydrogels (n = 3) were incubated in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h, then
lightly blotted dry and weighed (Ws). Hydrogels were then freeze-dried and
weighed to determine the dry weight (Wd). The SR of the swollen gel was calcu-
lated according to the following equation34.
SR ¼ ðWs � WdÞ

Rheological studies. Rheological properties of hydrogels were analyzed following
a reported method17. In brief, dynamic rheology experiments were performed
using a HAAKE MARS III photo-rheometer with parallel-plate (P20 TiL, 20-mm
diameter) geometry and OmniCure Series 2000 (365 nm: 30 mW•cm−2) at 37 °C.
Time-sweep oscillatory tests of GelMA/HA-NB/LAP (n = 3), GelMA/HA-NB
(n = 3), and GelMA/LAP hydrogels (n = 3) were performed at a 10% strain, 1 Hz
frequency, and a 0.5 mm gap (CD mode). Strain sweeps were performed on the
pregel solution to verify the linear response. The gel point was determined at the
time when the torsion modulus (G’) surpassed the loss modulus (G”).
Burst pressure test. Burst pressure testing was performed using a published
method35. Briefly, a piece of 4 × 4 cm porcine sausage skin membrane was cut and
cleaned to remove any excess fat. The membrane was fixed to the measurement
device linked to a syringe pump filled with PBS solution. A 2 mm incision was
made on the sausage skin membrane surface and the membrane surface was kept
wet. Then, 500 μL precursor solutions were injected onto the incision, after which
the hydrogels formed in situ on the puncture site after UV illumination. The
thickness of the hydrogels was ~4.4 mm and burst pressure was measured after gel
formation. Peak pressure before pressure loss was considered the burst pressure.
All measurements were repeated three times. Fibrin Glue (Shanghai RAAS Blood
Products, Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China), CA (Beijing Compont Medical Devices, Co.,
Ltd, Beijing, China), and SurgifloTM (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) were tested
using the same parameters and conditions.
Wound-closure tests. The adhesion strengths of the GelMA/HA-NB/LAP
hydrogels and of Fibrin Glue, CA, and SurgifloTM were tested using the modified
ASTM F2458–05 standard, a standard test for the determination of tissue/sealant
material adhesive strength15. Porcine skin was prepared from fresh porcine skin
pieces obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The skin sample dimensions were
30 mm × 10 mm. Tissues were pre-wet by immersion in PBS before testing, then
fixed onto two glass slides (25 mm × 50 mm) using the ParafilmTM. The tissue was
cut in the middle with a straight edge razor to simulate wounding, hydrogel
solutions (1 mL) were injected onto the desired adhesion zone (20 × 20 mm), and
crosslinked by UV. The two glass slides were placed into an Instron mechanical
tester (Instron-5543 with a 1 kN sensor) for adhesion strength test by tensile
loading with a strain rate of 1 mm/min. Maximum adhesive strength of each
sample was obtained at the point of tearing. All measurements were repeated
three times.
Peeling adhesion test. The peeling adhesion test was performed according to
reported methods10. The sausage skin membrane was bonded to a rigid

 polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with CA glue. One end of the PET film was
kept open, in order to limit deformation at the crack tip. Then, hydrogel solutions
(1 mL) were injected on the membrane surface (40 × 15 mm) and a hydrogel
polymerized by UV irradiation. Finally, another PET film was bonded to the
hydrogel (40 × 15 mm) with CA, forming a bilayer with an edge crack. This
experimental set-up was used, because the sausage membranes are not transparent
to UV and the hydrogel could not form if these membranes were used on both
sides. An Instron machine (Instron-5543 with a 1 kN sensor) was used to apply
unidirectional tension, while recording the force and the extension. The loading
rate was kept constant at 1 mm/min. All measurements were repeated three times.
In vitro lap shear test. The lap shear test was performed according to a previous
study15. The shear resistance of the GelMA/HA-NB/LAP hydrogels (n = 4),
GelMA/HA-NB hydrogels (n = 4), and GelMA/LAP hydrogels (n = 4) was tested
according to the modified ASTM F2255-05 standard for lap shear strength prop-
erty of tissue adhesives. The sausage skin membrane was bonded to glass slides
with CA glue. Then, hydrogel solutions (200 μL) were injected on the membrane
surface (10 mm × 15 mm) and a hydrogel polymerized by UV irradiation. Finally,
another glass slide was bonded to the hydrogel (10 mm × 15 mm) with CA. The
two glass slides were placed into an Instron mechanical tester for shear testing by
tensile loading with a strain rate of 1 mm/min. The sealant shear strength was
determined at the point of detachment.
Compression test. The compressive stress–strain measurements were performed
using a tensile-compressive tester (Instron-5543 with a 1 kN sensor). In
compression-crack test, compressive samples were prepared in the molds for
compression tests (10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in depth). Prior to the test,
hydrogels were incubated in PBS at 37 °C for 4 h. The compressive strain rate was
5 mm/min and strain level was up to 75% of the original height. The compressive
moduli were the approximate linear fitting values of the stress–strain curves in the
strain range of 15–25%. All measurements were repeated three times.
Cell encapsulation and proliferation assay. L929 fibroblast cells (L929, Cell bank
of the Chinese Academy of Science), at a density of 4 × 106 cells/mL were sus-
pended in the sterile polymer precursor solution GelMA/HA-NB/LAP to evaluate
the cytotoxicity of hydrogels. The cell-containing precursor solution (25 μL) was
irradiated (30 mW/cm2, 3 min) to produce a cell-laden hydrogel and cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1, 3, and 5 days. Cell viability
was determined using the live/dead cytotoxicity kit (Dojindo, Japan). Encapsulated
cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope (X71; Olympus). The pro-
liferation of L929 cells was assessed by the Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method.
Briefly, L929 cells were seeded into 96-well plates with a density of 1000 cells/100
μL/well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator to obtain
a monolayer of cells. Cell medium was replaced with hydrogel extracts and further
incubated for 1, 3, and 5 days. The sample solution was removed and CCK-8
reagent was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was
measured using a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, USA) at 450 nm. For each
sample, five independent cultures were prepared and proliferation assays were
repeated three times for each culture.
Cell attachment test. C3H cells (C3H10T1/2, Cell bank of the Chinese Academy
of Science) (5 × 104 cells/hydrogel) were seeded onto the GelMA/HA-NB/LAP
hydrogel coated onto coverslips. Cells were stained with phalloidin (Cytoskeleton,
Inc.) and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino- 2-phenylindole, Beyotime Institute of Bio-
technology, Inc., Jiangsu, China) 1, 3, and 5 days following seeding. Before staining,
cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1%
(w/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, and then blocked with 1% bovine
serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. Actin filaments were stained in 200 ×
10−9 M phalloidin for 45 min and nuclei were stained in 14.3 × 10−6 M DAPI for 5
min. Stained cells were then imaged under a confocal microscope with a ×40 water
objective (BX-FV1000, Olympus).
In vivo degradation of hydrogels. Male rats (~ 250 g) were used in the in vivo
degradation studies. All animals were treated according to the standard guidelines
approved by the Zhejiang University Ethics Committee (ZJU20170969). A 1 cm
incision in the mediodorsal skin of was made and a lateral subcutaneous pocket
prepared. Hydrogel samples (n = 20; 10 × 3 mm cylinders) were implanted under
sterile conditions. At designated time intervals (days 7, 14, 28, and 56), the rats
were sacrificed and the samples were processed for histological analyses and
biodegradation studies.
In vivo biocompatibility. Male rats (~ 250 g) were used for the in vivo bio-
compatibility studies. All animals were treated according to the standard guidelines
approved by the Zhejiang University Ethics Committee (ZJU20170969). A 1 cm
incision was made in the rat mesodorsal epidermis and a small lateral subcutaneous
pocket was prepared. Matrix hydrogel (n = 8), CA (n = 8), and Fibrin glue (n = 8)
were implanted into the dorsal subcutaneous pockets under sterile conditions. At
designated time intervals (days 7 and 14), the rats were killed and the samples were
processed for histological analyses. The degree of inflammation was assessed by
three expert histopathologists, under blinded experimental conditions.
In vitro hemostasis experiments on pig livers. In vitro experiments were carried
out on fresh pig livers purchased from the market to study hemostatic performance
under wet and dynamic conditions. First, a 10 mm incision was pierced in pig liver
and a perfusion tube was inserted with a 20 mL/min blood flow volume to mimic
the heavy bleeding. The hydrogel was applied to the bleeding site and crosslinked
by 365 nm UV light. The Fibrin Glue was used as control group.
In vivo hemostasis on rabbit’s livers and arteries. To study the hemostatic
properties of hydrogels in vivo, the liver lobes and femoral artery of male New
Zealand white rabbits (2.5–3.0 kg, n = 22), and the heart and carotid artery of male
BA-MA Mini-pigs (20–25 kg, n = 5) were used as models. All animals were treated
according to guidelines approved by the Zhejiang University Ethics Committee
(ZJU20170969). For liver hemostasis, a large (3 cm) incision was made in the liver
using surgical scissors. The hydrogel was injected onto the incision, followed by
illumination with 365 nm UV light for 3~ 5 s. During the surgery, the blood was
carefully collected with filter papers at time point of 10 min. The total amount of
the blood loss was determined by weighing the papers and recorded10. For femoral
artery hemostasis, the femoral artery of rabbit was peeled from the surrounding
tissues and an incision (2 mm) created by scalpel. Hemostatic forceps were then
used to clamp the blood vessels. Then the hydrogel was applied to the incision site
and illuminated by UV light for 3~ 5 s. After 30 s for gelation, hemostatic forceps
clamped in the proximal vascular was removed to observe whether the bleeding
was stopped or not. Then, the distal part of the artery was clipped to observe
whether the vessel was free or not.
Hemostatic experiments on pig carotid arteries and hearts. For hemostasis of
penetrated cardiac injuries, after general anesthesia, a 6 mm inner diameter needle
was used to pierce the ventriculus sinister of pig hearts (n = 7). For the experi-
mental group, the defects and surrounding tissue were rapidly covered with
hydrogel and irradiated by UV (n = 4). For the control group, the wound and
surrounding tissue were first covered with Fibrin Glue, then with SurgifloTM, and
finally with the hydrogel, followed by UV fixation (n = 3). The electrocardiograph
was recorded using noninvasive telemetry for large animals (Emka Technologies,
France).
The carotid artery hemostasis of pigs was carried out in a similar way to the
femoral artery hemostasis of rabbit, the difference being that the incision (4–5 mm)
was created by needle puncture followed by full scalpel incision. Blood flow volume
was tested before and after surgery using the MFV-3200 electromagnetic flow
meter (Nihon Kohden, Japan). The comparative experiments with Fibrin Glue and
SurgifloTM were made using carotid artery hemostasis. After these operations,
one pig was sacrificed for cardiac wall section histopathology and SEM analysis,
and other pigs were allowed to recover.
All animals were treated according to guidelines approved by the Zhejiang
University Ethics Committee (ZJU20170969).
Myocardial enzyme test. The levels of AST, CK, and LDH in the blood were
analyzed by automatic biochemical analyzer (HITACHI 7020, Tokyo, Japan). The
levels of BNP, cTn-T, and CK-MB were measured by ELISA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute).
Histological evaluation. After 2 weeks recovery, the pigs were sacrificed. The heart
and carotid artery were surgically removed and the samples were processed for
histological analyses.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. Differences between
the values were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; Tukey’s
post-hoc test), except in vivo biocompatibility experiment (two-way ANOVA;
Tukey’s post-hoc test). Data are presented as means with 95% confidence interval.
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
