Abstract 
Background: It is anticipated that malaria elimination efforts in Africa will be hampered by increasing resistance 
to the limited arsenal of insecticides approved for use in public health. However, insecticide susceptibility status of 
vector populations evaluated under standard insectary test conditions can give a false picture of the threat, as the 
thermal environment in which the insect and insecticide interact plays a significant role in insecticide toxicity.
Methods: The effect of temperature on the expression of the standard WHO insecticide resistance phenotype was 
examined using Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus strains: a susceptible strain and the derived resistant 
strain, selected in the laboratory for resistance to DDT or pyrethroids. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to the pyre-
throid deltamethrin or the carbamate bendiocarb was assessed at 18, 25 or 30 °C. The ability of the pyrethroid syner-
gist piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) to restore pyrethroid susceptibility was also assessed at these temperatures.
Results: Temperature impacted the toxicity of deltamethrin and bendiocarb. Although the resistant An. funestus 
strain was uniformly resistant to deltamethrin across temperatures, increasing temperature increased the resistance 
of the susceptible An. arabiensis strain. Against susceptible An. funestus and resistant An. arabiensis females, deltame-
thrin exposure at temperatures both lower and higher than standard insectary conditions increased mortality. PBO 
exposure completely restored deltamethrin susceptibility at all temperatures. Bendiocarb displayed a consistently 
positive temperature coefficient against both susceptible and resistant An. funestus strains, with survival increasing as 
temperature increased.
Conclusions: Environmental temperature has a marked effect on the efficacy of insecticides used in public health 
against important African malaria vectors. Caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions about a chemical’s 
efficacy from laboratory assays performed at only one temperature, as phenotypic resistance can vary significantly 
even over a temperature range that could be experienced by mosquitoes in the field during a single day. Similarly, it 
might be inappropriate to assume equal efficacy of a control tool over a geographic area where local conditions vary 
drastically. Additional studies into the effects of temperature on the efficacy of insecticide-based interventions under 
field conditions are warranted.

Background
The development and spread of insecticide resistance 
in mosquito vectors is thought to be a major threat for 
malaria control and elimination programmes world-
wide. Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has been 
identified in populations of malaria vectors across 
Africa [1, 2] and, given the central role of this class of 
insecticides in insecticide-based vector control (the 
only one approved by the WHO to be used in treated 
bed nets and the most-used in indoor residual sprays 
[3]) the increasing prevalence of resistance is regarded 
with concern, as it may undermine malaria control and 
elimination activities [4, 5].
Continuous monitoring of insecticide susceptibility in 
malaria vector populations informs the choice of chem-
icals to be used in an area and allows for the manage-
ment of insecticide resistance [6]. However, insecticide 
toxicity does not only depend on the active ingredient. 
The efficacy of a chemical against its target is also a 
function of the formulation, the biology of the insect, 
and the environment in which these interact [7]. Thus, 
it is difficult to predict how an insecticide susceptibility 
test in a laboratory or insectary, where insecticide dose, 
mosquito physiological status (e.g., age, blood feeding, 
larval nutrition) and climate are controlled [8], trans-
lates to the efficacy of an insecticide in the field [9].
Environmental temperature in particular has been 
shown to influence the outcome of insecticide exposure; 
temperature differences expected to occur naturally 
under field conditions can lead to notable variations in 
chemical efficacy [10]. The importance of such changes 
in effectiveness to the control of malaria vectors has not 
been widely considered, though temperature-depend-
ent sensitivity to insecticides has been demonstrated in 
Anopheles gambiae (pyrethroid permethrin: [11], pyr-
role chlorfenapyr: [12]) and Anopheles stephensi with 
varying levels of resistance (organochlorine DDT and 
organophosphate diazinon: [13], permethrin: [11], per-
methrin and organophosphate malathion: [14]).
Here, the effects of temperature on the expression 
of insecticide resistance in Anopheles arabiensis and 
Anopheles funestus were examined by exposing sus-
ceptible and resistant strains of these species to the 
pyrethroid deltamethrin or the carbamate bendiocarb 
at 18, 25 or 30°C. The ability of the pyrethroid syner-
gist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) to restore susceptibility 
in pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes was also evaluated 
at these temperatures. This is the first investigation into 
the effects of temperature on insecticide susceptibility 
in these major vectors of southern Africa, and the first 
look at the contribution of environmental temperature 
to the efficacy of PBO in resistant mosquitoes.
Methods
Mosquito strains
For each of two Anopheles species, two strains of mosqui-
toes were used: a parent strain and a strain derived from 
the parent by insecticide selection (Table 1). All experi-
ments were carried out in the Vector Control Research 
Laboratory (VCRL) in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
Strains were reared and maintained according to their 
standard procedures, described in Hunt et al. [15].
SENN is an An. arabiensis strain from Sennar, Sudan, 
that has been maintained at the VCRL since 1990. As 
described in Oliver and Brooke [16], SENN-DDT was 
selected by exposing 1–3 days old non-blood fed SENN 
mosquitoes to 4% DDT for 1 h and then allowing survi-
vors to breed. This procedure, repeated each generation 
since 1995, has selected for multiple insecticide resist-
ance (DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin, malathion), medi-
ated by increased detoxification enzyme activity and 
fixation of the L1014F kdr mutation [16, 17].
FUMOZ is an An. funestus strain from southern 
Mozambique that has been maintained at the VCRL 
since 2000. Similar to the method used to generate the 
SENN-DDT strain, selection pressure with 0.75% perme-
thrin, a pyrethroid, was used to generate the FUMOZ-R 
strain. Although selection ceased in 2005, both strains 
remain resistant to pyrethroids and carbamates. No kdr 
alleles are present in either An. funestus strain [18]. The 
mechanism of resistance in these mosquitoes is meta-
bolic in nature [19, 20]. Updated assessments of the 
resistance status of SENN-DDT, FUMOZ and FUMOZ-R 
are described in Venter et al. [21].
Temperature treatment and insecticide exposure
Exposures to 0.05% deltamethrin and 0.1% bendiocarb 
followed the WHO insecticide-resistance monitor-
ing ‘tube test’ protocol [8], using test papers acquired 
from the WHO. To evaluate the effect of tempera-
ture on insecticide susceptibility, two temperature 
treatments were included in addition to the stand-
ard 25 °C specified in the tube test protocol. The low 
temperature treatment, 18 °C, represents a possible 
average night-time temperature or the average daily 
African highland temperature, while the high tem-
perature treatment, 30 °C, is a temperature that might

be expected closer to mid-day, or an average in some 
parts of sub-Saharan Africa during the summer [22]. 
Incubators (0.32 m × 0.31 m × 0.33 m) and thermoreg-
ulators (Sable Systems, North Las Vegas, NV, USA) 
were used to maintain conditions at 18 and 30 °C; wet 
towels were added to maintain relative humidity (RH) 
over 70%. The VCRL insectary provided the stand-
ard environment (~ 25 °C, 80% RH). Temperature and 
humidity were monitored at 5-min intervals with USB 
data loggers (SSN-22, AWR Smith Process Instrumen-
tation, South Africa). Mean and standard deviation of 
temperature and per cent RH for each experiment are 
listed in the supplementary information (Additional 
file 1: Table S1), and the averages for all experiments 
are listed in Table 2.
For each temperature, groups of approximately 25 
female mosquitoes were transferred by mouth aspirator 
to plain paper-lined holding tubes: two tubes were des-
ignated as control replicates (therefore, ~ 50 control 
females), 4 as insecticide-exposed replicates (~ 100 
exposed females). Tubes were moved to their respective 
temperature treatments, and mosquitoes were given 1 h 
to acclimate before the 1-h exposure. Acclimatization and 
exposure occurred during mosquito scotophase (‘mos-
quito night’). At the end of the exposure to control or 
insecticide-treated papers, mosquitoes were moved back 
to the holding tubes and sucrose was provided. Mosqui-
toes were kept at their treatment temperatures for 24 h 
in the dark (due to equipment limitations), after which 
mortality was recorded. Experiments with each mos-
quito strain were replicated to generate the sample sizes 
in Table 2. Number of experimental replicates: using del-
tamethrin SENN: 2, SENN-DDT: 5; FUMOZ: 3; FUMOZ-
R: 2; using bendiocarb FUMOZ: 2; FUMOZ-R: 3.

The effect of the pyrethroid synergist piperonyl-butox-
ide (PBO) on the toxicity of deltamethrin at these tem-
peratures was also assessed. At each temperature, there 
were 4 control or insecticide treatments: untreated con-
trol, PBO-only control, deltamethrin-only, deltame-
thrin + PBO. PBO-only and deltamethrin + PBO groups 
were exposed to papers treated with 4% PBO [23] post-
acclimatization, for 30 min prior to the 1-h experimental 
period. Thirty minutes was used because a 1-h exposure 
to PBO alone at 30°C induced 100% mortality. Number of 
experimental replicates: SENN: not tested, SENN-DDT: 
2; FUMOZ: 1; FUMOZ-R: 1.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R v. 3.2.1 [24]. 
Mortality data (number of mosquitoes dead and alive 
per tube) were analysed with generalized linear models, 
using a binomial error distribution and logit link func-
tion, to assess the affect of treatment on mosquito sur-
vival. Temperature was the independent variable (low, 
standard, high), and was coded as a categorical variable, 
with the low group as the reference level. Experimental 
replicate was included as a random effect. Groups with 
consistently ~ 0 or ~ 100% mortality (e.g., control or del-
tamethrin + PBO groups) could not be included in analy-
sis due to complete separation.
Results
Anopheles arabiensis strains
Only insecticide-exposed mosquitoes were included in 
the analysis of SENN experiments due to uniformly high 
control survival across temperatures. Similarly, control 
mosquitoes were excluded from the SENN-DDT analysis, 
as their survival was not affected by temperature (Fig. 1b; 
Χ2 = 1.1, df = 2, p = 0.6).
Temperature significantly influenced the probability 
of unselected and selected An. arabiensis strains dying 
from deltamethrin exposure (Fig. 1; SENN: χ2 = 30.3, 
df = 2, p < 0.001; SENN-DDT: χ2 = 17.2, df = 2, p < 0.001). 
However, the changes in susceptibility with tempera-
ture differed slightly between the two strains. Deltame-
thrin toxicity in the unselected SENN strain consistently 
decreased as temperature increased; thus, deltamethrin 
displayed what is called a negative temperature coef-
ficient. SENN had significantly greater odds of dying at 
the low temperature, compared to the standard 25 °C 
(Table 3). Deltamethrin was less toxic to SENN-DDT 
females at the standard temperature than at either 
extreme; both the low and high temperatures increased 
the likelihood of being killed by deltamethrin exposure 
(Fig. 1b, Table 3). PBO exposure completely restored sus-
ceptibility to deltamethrin in SENN-DDT at all tempera-
tures (Fig. 1b).

Anopheles funestus strains
Due to uniformly high survival in control groups of both 
An. funestus strains, and uniformly high mortality in 
deltamethrin + PBO-exposed groups (Figs. 2, 3, dotted 
lines), only mosquitoes exposed to deltamethrin- or ben-
diocarb-only were included in the analyses.
Although survival to deltamethrin in the selected 
FUMOZ-R was consistently high across temperatures 
(Fig. 2b; FUMOZ-R: χ2 = 0.8, df = 2, p = 0.7), temperature 
significantly influenced the probability of the unselected 
FUMOZ females being killed by exposure to the pyre-
throid deltamethrin (Fig. 2a; FUMOZ: χ2 = 111.7, df = 2, 
p < 0.001). FUMOZ exposed at 18° or 30 °C had a greater 
risk of dying than those exposed at the WHO standard 
exposure temperature (Table 3). PBO exposure com-
pletely restored susceptibility to deltamethrin in both of 
these An. funestus colonies, at all temperatures (Fig. 2).
In both An. funestus strains, temperature significantly 
affected the probability of surviving exposure to ben-
diocarb (Fig. 3; FUMOZ: χ2 = 49.0, df = 2, p < 0.001; 
FUMOZ-R: χ2 = 66.7, df = 2, p < 0.001). Bendiocarb dis-
played a consistently positive temperature coefficient, 
with mortality increasing as temperature increased.
Discussion
Here it was demonstrated for the first time that: (1) tem-
perature impacted insecticide toxicity in An. arabiensis 
and An. funestus; (2) temperature affected the toxicity 
of deltamethrin and bendiocarb differently; and, (3) the 
synergist PBO fully restored pyrethroid susceptibil-
ity independent of temperature. These chemicals are of 
interest due to their utility in current (i.e., pyrethroids [3, 
4]), and future (i.e., synergist PBO, incorporated into the 
next generation of pyrethroid-LLINs [25]) vector control 
interventions.

Temperature has long been known to be a critical fac-
tor underlying insecticide toxicity [7, 9, 11], and has 
now been demonstrated to impact the efficacy of public 
health insecticides against a number of malaria vector 
species (An. gambiae and An. stephensi [11, 12, 14]; An. 
arabiensis and An. funestus, this paper). The relationship 
between insecticide-induced toxicity and temperature is 
described in terms of a temperature coefficient (TC). If 
toxicity increases as temperature increases, the chemi-
cal has a positive TC. In other insects, DDT and pyre-
throid insecticides often have negative TCs, i.e., toxicity 
decreases with increasing temperature, so the chemical is 
most effective at lower temperatures [7]. Here, the effect 
of temperature on deltamethrin toxicity depended on 
mosquito strain and its temperature coefficient was not 
always consistently positive or negative. Against both 
FUMOZ and SENN-DDT females (two different spe-
cies and selection backgrounds, but similar levels of del-
tamethrin tolerance/resistance) this pyrethroid was more 
lethal at temperatures both lower and higher than the 
standard insectary temperature. Hodjati and Curtis also 
observed a non-linear (bi-modal) change in pyrethroid 
toxicity with temperature in An. stephensi exposed to 
permethrin [11]. They discussed the potential interaction 
of chemical toxicity or nerve sensitivity and mosquito 
behaviour over different temperatures. Although behav-
iour could not be observed in these experiments, the 
influence of temperature on mosquito activity levels is 
likely to be especially important in the case of pyrethroid 
insecticides, which are characterized by their effects on 
mosquito behaviour: irritancy and knockdown [7]. As the 
L1014F kdr mutation is present only in the SENN-DDT 
strain [21], a difference in neural sensitivity may under-
pin some of the variation seen between the strains.
Interestingly, the ability of the synergist PBO to restore 
pyrethroid susceptibility was not affected by tempera-
ture. At the temperatures tested, all mosquitoes exposed 
to PBO and then deltamethrin died. This is the first 
examination of the interaction between PBO and tem-
perature in mosquitoes, and is especially important 
given that the next generation of long-lasting insecticidal 
nets (LLINs) that have received interim approval from 
the WHO to integrate PBO as a pyrethroid resistance 
countermeasure [25, 26]. Although it is unclear how the 
addition of PBO might drive increases in the intensity of 
resistance in mosquito populations, these experiments 
indicate that PBO could be effective in restoring suscepti-
bility to deltamethrin independent of climatic conditions 
(in comparison to other novel vector interventions [12]). 
One possibility is that the addition of PBO as a selection 
pressure may shift the mechanism of pyrethroid resist-
ance from P450-based to an alternative mechanism as, 
although P450s are the most common metabolic detoxi-
fication mechanism, it is not the only one [27]. Another 
important observation was that PBO alone for 1 h killed 
mosquitoes at 30 °C. The increased toxicity of PBO at 
high temperatures may be a manifestation of an increased 
reaction rate of irreversible inhibition at the higher tem-
perature; given time, PBO will shift from being a syner-
gist (defined in part by its lack of insecticidal activity on 
its own) to being toxic [28].
It is important to keep in mind that the outcomes 
presented here relate to the standard WHO suscepti-
bility tests [8]. However, the observed drastic change 
in susceptibility over the three temperatures (that are 
reasonable in African transmission settings [22]), along 
with the increasing need to integrate non-pyrethroids 
into control programmes, reinforces the need for fur-
ther investigation into the influence of temperature 
on insecticide toxicity. As demonstrated here (and 
elsewhere [10, 14]), it is important to consider local 
environmental conditions when monitoring insecti-
cide resistance, as they have the potential to alter the 
outcomes and thus to affect conclusions and actions 
needed [9]. As such this work contributes to the ongo-
ing debate on the limitations of the WHO tube assay 
[29, 30]. For example, SENN would be classified as 
resistant to deltamethrin, but exposures at cooler 
temperatures kill enough mosquitoes for SENN to 
be classified as susceptible. In addition, FUMOZ and 
FUMOZ-R are resistant to bendiocarb at the standard 
test temperature. However, when exposed to warmer 
temperatures mortality increases to 95 and 92%. 
Although both would still be classified as ‘resistant’
, as 
mortality is below the WHO threshold of 98%, these 
differences (approx. onefold increase in mortality) may

have a significant epidemiological impact. As the cur-
rent and future chemical arsenal is limited [31] and 
resistance to multiple insecticide classes is now com-
mon [3], an adequate qualification of resistance is criti-
cal to maximize the number of available effective tools 
in the vector control toolbox.
Perhaps more importantly, this phenomenon (observed 
temperature-toxicity effects) may apply to actual chemi-
cal vector control interventions (LLINs, IRS or other 
chemical-based interventions, such as durable wall lin-
ers). Tools may be more or less effective under certain 
conditions, given that there are strong effects of tem-
perature on toxicity. This was recently highlighted for 
chlorfenapyr, a pyrrole insecticide being evaluated for 
inclusion on LLINs for pyrethroid-resistance manage-
ment [32]. Chlorfenapyr displayed a strongly positive 
temperature coefficient between 21 and 29 °C against 
the susceptible KISUMU strain of An. gambiae: while 
82–100% of mosquitoes were killed at 27 °C, exposure at 
22 °C killed 12–45% [12]. Although it is unclear what this 
difference means in terms of loss of disease control, it is 
clear that the importance of temperature in determin-
ing the efficacy of tools (and of other well-known factors, 
such as mosquito age, blood-feeding status, available 
dose, circadian rhythm [see 9]) adds to the complexity 
of the ongoing debate on the impact of insecticide resist-
ance on intervention efficacy and transmission intensity 
[1, 33–36].
Conclusion
Given their utility, insecticide-based vector control tools 
will continue to play a crucial role in malaria control and 
elimination strategies [37]. As novel active ingredients 
for public health insecticides are expected to be delivered 
no earlier than 2020 [1], and the second generation of 
non-pyrethroid, multi-insecticide-treated nets will only 
be available for widescale deployment in several years’ 
time, the current chemical arsenal needs to be deployed 
to its maximum potential, which may require us to think 
beyond laboratory insecticide resistance results. Per-
forming efficacy tests with actual vector control products 
and local (wild-caught) vectors under real, field condi-
tions (which would include exposures during the appro-
priate season and relevant time of day) would limit the 
impact of confounding factors (such as temperature, 
shown in this paper) and yield more accurate entomo-
logical intelligence for evidence-based decision-making.
