Abstract Many important gram-negative bacterial pathogens use highly sophisticated type III
protein secretion systems (T3SSs) to establish complex host-pathogen interactions. Bacterial-host
cell contact triggers the activation of the T3SS and the subsequent insertion of a translocon pore
into the target cell membrane, which serves as a conduit for the passage of effector proteins.
Therefore the initial interaction between T3SS-bearing bacteria and host cells is the critical step in
the deployment of the protein secretion machine, yet this process remains poorly understood.
Here, we use high-throughput cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the T3SS-mediated
Salmonella-host cell interface. Our analysis reveals the intact translocon at an unprecedented level
of resolution, its deployment in the host cell membrane, and the establishment of an intimate
association between the bacteria and the target cells, which is essential for effector translocation.
Our studies provide critical data supporting the long postulated direct injection model for effector
translocation.

Introduction
Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are widely utilized by many pathogenic or symbiotic Gram-nega-
tive bacteria to directly inject bacterially encoded effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells
(Deng et al., 2017; Gala
´n et al., 2014; Notti and Stebbins, 2016). The central element of the T3SS
is the injectisome, a multi-protein machine that mediates the selection and translocation of the effec-
tors destined to travel this delivery pathway. The injectisome is highly conserved, both structurally
and functionally, across different bacterial species including important pathogens such as Salmo-
nella, Yersinia, Shigella, Pseudomonas and Chlamydia species. It consists of defined substructures
such as the needle complex, the export apparatus, and the cytoplasmic sorting platform
(Gala
´n et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Loquet et al., 2012; Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011;
Worrall et al., 2016). The needle complex is composed of a membrane-anchored base, a protruding
needle filament, and a tip complex at the distal end of the needle (Kubori et al., 1998;
Schraidt et al., 2010; Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011; Worrall et al., 2016). The export apparatus,
which is formed by several inner membrane proteins, functions as the conduit for substrate

 translocation across the bacterial inner membrane (Dietsche et al., 2016). The sorting platform is a
large cytoplasmic multiple-protein complex that orderly selects and delivers the substrates to the
export apparatus (Lara-Tejero et al., 2011).
In many bacterial species the activity of these protein injection machines is stimulated upon con-
tact with the target eukaryotic cell membrane, a process thought to be mediated by the tip complex
(Barta et al., 2012; Blocker et al., 2008; Deane et al., 2006; Me
´nard et al., 1994; Zierler and
Gala
´n, 1995). Host cell contact triggers a cascade of poorly understood events that lead to the
deployment of the protein translocases onto the host cell membrane where they form a protein
channel that mediates the passage of the effector proteins. In the case of the Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) T3SS encoded within its pathogenicity island 1, the protein
translocases are SipB and SipC, which through a process that requires the tip protein SipD, are
inserted in the host-cell membrane to form the translocon channel (Collazo and Gala
´n, 1997).
Deployment of the translocon also results in the intimate association of the bacteria and the host
cell, which is orchestrated by the protein translocases themselves (Lara-Tejero and Gala
´n, 2009;
Misselwitz et al., 2011). Despite the critical role of the translocases in intimate attachment and
effector translocation, little is known about their structural organization when deployed in the host
cell membrane, and previous attempts to visualize them did not provide distinct structural details.
This paucity of information is due at least in part to the intrinsic difficulties of imaging bacteria/host
cell interactions at high resolution. Here, we used bacterial minicells and cultured mammalian cells
combined with high-throughput cryo-ET to study the initial interaction between S. Typhimurium and
host cells. This experimental system allowed the visualization of the intact translocon deployed in
the host cell membrane, in contact with the tip-complex of the T3SS injectisome, at unprecedented
resolution. This study provides new insights into the initial events of the T3SS-mediated bacteria-
host cell interactions and highlights the potential of cryo-ET as a valuable tool for investigating the
host cell-pathogen interface.
Results
In situ structures of the T3SS injectisome in the presence or absence of
protein translocases
An intrinsic property of many T3SSs is that their activity is stimulated by contact with the target host
cell membrane (Me
´nard et al., 1994; Zierler and Gala
´n, 1995). This interaction results not only in
the stimulation of secretion but also in the deployment of the protein translocases in the host cell
membrane, a poorly understood process that is orchestrated by the tip complex of the injectisome’s
needle filament. In the case of the S. Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS the tip complex is thought to be com-
posed of a single protein, SipD, which organizes as a pentamer at the tip of the needle filament
(Rathinavelan et al., 2014). However, it has been previously proposed that in Shigella spp., in addi-
tion to IpaD, a homolog of SipD, the tip complex also contains IpaB, a homolog of SipB
(Cheung et al., 2015). To get insight into the structural organization of the tip complex prior to bac-
terial contact with cultured cells, we compared the in situ structures of fully assembled injectisomes
from minicells obtained from wild-type, DsipB, and DsipD S. Typhimurium strains (Figure 1A–D,
Table 1). We found that injectisomes from wild-type or the DsipB strains were indistinguishable from
one another. In contrast, injectisomes from a DsipD strain exhibited a shorter needle (~45 nm) in
comparison to the needle filaments of injectisomes from the wild-type or DsipB strains (~50 nm).
These observations suggest that SipD is the only structural component of the tip complex
(Figure 1E). To further explore this hypothesis, we examined by cryo-ET the injectisomes of minicells
obtained from S. Typhimurium strains expressing FLAG-epitope-tagged versions of SipB, SipC, and
SipD, after labeling with anti-FLAG antibodies (Lara-Tejero and Gala
´n, 2009) (Figure 1F–H, Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1). Only injectisomes from minicells obtained from the strain expressing
SipD-FLAG showed the antibodies bound to the needle tip (Figure 1H, Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1D,I). This observation is consistent with the notion that, prior to cell contact, SipD is the
main, and most likely only component of the tip-complex (Lara-Tejero and Gala
´n, 2009).

 High-resolution imaging of the T3SS mediated Salmonella-host cell
interface
It is well established that effector translocation through the T3SS requires an intimate association
between the bacteria and the host cell (Grosdent et al., 2002). It has also been previously demon-
strated that such intimate attachment requires an intact type III secretion machine, and in particular,
the protein translocases, which most likely mediate such bacteria/host cell interaction (Lara-
Tejero and Gala
´n, 2009). Despite its central role in effector translocation, however, very little is
known about the architecture of this specialized host/bacteria interface. This is largely because of

 the lack of amenable experimental approaches that would allow a detail view of this interface. Cryo-
ET is uniquely suited to examine host/pathogen interactions at high resolution. However, sample
thickness limits the utility of this approach. To get around this limitation we used bacterial minicells
as a surrogate for whole bacteria since it has been previously shown that they are capable of assem-
bling functional T3SS injectisomes that can deliver de novo synthesized T3SS substrates into cultured
cells (Carleton et al., 2013). However, minicells are inefficient at triggering membrane ruffling, actin
filament remodeling, and bacterial internalization due to inefficient partitioning of the effector pro-
teins that trigger these responses. Consequently, while minicells are proficient at establishing a
T3SS-mediated intimate association with cultured epithelial cells, they are inefficient at triggering
their own internalization thus remaining firmly attached on the cell surface. These features make
them ideally suited for high-resolution cryo-ET imaging. Therefore, we applied bacterial minicells
obtained from wild-type S. Typhimurium onto cultured epithelial cells grown on cryo-EM grids. We
found that the periphery of adherent cells is sufficiently thin (<500 nm) for high-resolution imaging
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We readily observed T3SS injectisomes at the interface between
minicells and the plasma membrane of cultured epithelial cells (Figure 2A,B). We found that in the
presence of the injectisomes, the spacing between the surface of the S. Typhimurium minicells and
the cultured-cell plasma membrane was ~50 nm, which matches the needle length of the injectisome
imaged prior to their application to cultured cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–F,M). The ori-
entation of the injectisomes in the bacteria/target cell interface was perpendicular relative to the
host PM, and the needle of the host-interacting injectisomes appeared straight (Figure 2C). We also
observed that the interaction of the injectisome and the target cell resulted in a noticeable inward
bend of the PM (Figure 2C, Video 1). Consistent with this observation, the distance between the
bacterial cell and the PM was shorter (~30 nm) than the distance observed in areas immediately adja-
cent to the injectisomes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–L). However, we did not observe any
sign of penetration of the needle filament through the host cell plasma membrane as it has been
previously proposed (Hoiczyk and Blobel, 2001). The length of the bacterial-envelope-embedded
injectisome base substructure before (30.5 ± 2.3 nm) and after (30.8 ± 2.2 nm) the bacteria/target
cell interactions remained unchanged (Figure 2—figure supplement 2M,N). This is in contrast to
the Chlamydia T3SS, which has been reported to undergo significant conformational changes upon
contact with host cells (Nans et al., 2015). The reasons for these differences are unclear and may
either reflect intrinsic differences between these T3SS, or differences in the methodology used,
which resulted in higher resolution of the visualized S. Typhimurium T3SS structures. Together, these
observations indicate that (1) the interactions of the T3SS injectisome with the target cell results in
the bending of the PM without penetration of the needle filament, and (2) upon contact with target
cells the injectisome does not undergo conformational changes that could be seen at this level of
resolution.
Visualization of the formation of the translocon in the target host cell
membrane
The deployment of the translocon is an essential step in the T3SS-mediated delivery of effector pro-
teins. However, very little information is available on both, the architecture of the assembled translo-
con, as well as the mechanisms leading to its deployment on the target cell. It is believed that the
deployment process must be initiated by a sensing step most likely mediated by the tip complex
(i.e. SipD), a step that must be followed by the subsequent secretion of the translocon components
(i.e. SipB and SipC) destined to be inserted on the target eukaryotic cell PM. To capture the forma-
tion of the translocon, we analyzed over 600 injectisomes adjacent to the host PM. Classification of
sub-tomograms depicting the region of the tip complex (Figure 3A) showed the PM at various con-
formations and distances to the needle tip (Figure 3B–I), which presumably represent intermediate
steps prior to the deployment of the translocon and the resulting intimate attachment of the bacte-
ria to the PM. After further alignment and classification of the injectisomes in intimate association
with the PM, we obtained a distinct structure of the putative translocon in the host PM (Figure 3J).
Sub-tomogram averages of injectisomes from the S. Typhimurium translocase-deficient mutants
DsipB or DsipD in close proximity to the target cell PM did not show this distinct structure
(Figure 3K,L), thus confirming that this density most likely corresponds to the assembled translocon.
To better visualize the translocon in 3D, we segmented the distinct translocon structure in the con-
text of the host PM, the needle, and its tip complex (Figure 3M,N). We found that the translocon

 has a thickness of 8.1 nm spanning the host PM and a diameter of 13.5 nm on its protruding portion
(Figure 3J). This size is substantially smaller than reported size of the translocon of enteropatho-
genic E. coli assembled from purified proteins in vitro, which was estimated to be 55–65 nm in diam-
eter (Ide et al., 2001). One half of the translocon is embedded in the host PM, while the other half
protrudes towards the host cytoplasm. In the middle of the protruded portion, we observed a hemi-
spherical hole, which may represent the channel through which effectors make their way into the tar-
get cell plasma membrane (Figure 3N). The presence of this structure is entirely consistent with the
long-standing notion that the translocon forms a conduit through the host PM to facilitate the trans-
location of effectors (Mueller et al., 2008).

 Comparison of the arrangement of the injecti-
somes in relation to the target cell PM in wild-
type and translocase-deficient strains revealed
marked differences. In comparison to wild-type,
bacterial cells obtained from translocase-deficient
mutants showed a smaller proportion of injecti-
somes attached to the host PM (Figure 4A). We
also noticed that, unlike wild-type injectisomes,
which most often appeared perpendicular to the
target cell PM (Figure 2C), the injectisomes from
the translocase deficient mutant strains DsipB,
DsipD, or DsipBCD appeared arranged at various
angles relative to the PM (Figure 4B–J, Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 1). These observa-
tions
are
consistent
with
the
observations
indicating that in the absence of the translocases,
the injectisomes do not intimately attach to the
target cell PM (Lara-Tejero and Gala
´n, 2009). These data also further support the notion that the
distinct structure embedded in host membrane in close apposition to the T3SS injectisome needle
tip is formed by the translocon.
One of the striking features associated with the intimate T3SS mediated contact and the forma-
tion of the translocon is the target cell PM remodeling around the translocon-injectisome needle tip
interface, appearing in a ‘tent-like’ conformation (Figure 2C, Video 1). This feature is likely the result
of the close association between the bacteria and the target cell presumably mediated not only by
the T3SS but also by multiple additional adhesins encoded by S. Typhimurium. In fact, the distance
of the bacteria OM and the target cell is shorter than the length of the needle itself, which results in
the bending of the target cell PM and the ‘tent-like’ conformation around the injectisome target cell
PM interface. It is possible that this intimate association may facilitate the T3SS-mediated transloca-
tion of effector proteins (Figure 5, Video 2). These observations are also consistent with previous
reports indicating that needle length, which presumably influences the ability of the bacteria to
‘push’ the needle against the host cell membrane, does contribute to type III secretion translocation
efficiency (Mota et al., 2005).
Discussion
We have presented here a high-resolution view of the interface between the S. Typhimurium T3SS
injectisome and the target eukaryotic cell plasma membrane, which has provided new details on the
intimate attachment of this pathogen that precedes T3SS-mediated effector protein translocation.
Notably, we observed a well-defined ‘bend’ on the target cell membrane in areas of the bacteria/
host cell membrane interface surrounding the needle filament. These observations reflect the inti-
mate attachment that is known to be required for optimal T3SS-mediated effector translocation.
Importantly, we have been able to visualize a distinct density within the region of the target host cell
membrane in close apposition to the needle tip of the T3SS injectisome. We present evidence that
this density corresponds to the deployed T3SS translocon since this density was absent in the bacte-
ria/PM interface of mutant bacteria that lack the translocon components. It has been previously
shown that protein translocases SipB and SipC form a complex in the host membrane (Hayward and
Koronakis, 1999; Myeni et al., 2013). Single-molecule fluorescence photobleaching experiments in
a Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3SS further suggested that two translocases form a hetero-complex of
defined stoichiometry in a membrane bilayer (Romano et al., 2016). Although our in situ structure
of the translocon is not sufficient in detail to determine its stoichiometry, it appears to be large
enough to accommodate multiple copies of SipB/SipC complex. The translocon is partially embed-
ded in the host membrane. A large portion of the translocon extends towards the host cytoplasm,
which is consistent with results in P. aeruginosa showing that the translocase PopB is stably inserted
into lipid bilayers with its N-terminal domain and C-terminal ends exposed to the host cytoplasm
(Discola et al., 2014). The dimensions of the in situ translocon structure determined in this study
(~13.5 nm in diameter, 8 nm in thickness) are much smaller than previous estimates (50–65 nm in
Video 1. A typical reconstruction shows the detailed
interaction between the T3SS machines and the target
cell and the membrane remodeling.

on red blood cells (Ide et al., 2001). It is unlikely that these differences may reflect substantial differ-
ences between the dimensions of translocons from different T3SSs. It is possible that the observed
differences may reflect differences in the experimental approaches used in the different studies.
However, most likely these observations indicate fundamental differences in the translocon assembly
mechanisms from purified components in comparison to translocon assembly during bacteria/target
cell membrane interactions. It is well established that the deployment of the translocon during

 bacterial infections is orchestrated by the tip complex of the T3SS injectisome. In the absence of the
tip protein, the components of the translocon are very efficiently secreted but they are unable to
form the translocon (Kaniga et al., 1995; Me
´nard et al., 1994). It is therefore possible that the
insertion in the membrane of the purified translocon components in the absence of the tip protein
may lead to a structure that is substantially different from the one that results from the interaction of
bacteria with target cells.
Contrary to what has been previously proposed for the Chlamydia T3SS (Nans et al., 2015), we

any
obvious

changes in the injectisomes prior and post inter-
action with host cells. It is unlikely that these
observations are an indication of fundamental dif-
ferences between the T3SS injectisomes in differ-
ent bacteria. Rather, the differences observed
might reflect differences in the experimental
approaches used in our studies, which resulted in
a substantially higher resolution.
In summary, our studies have provided a
close-up view of the interface between the T3SS
injectisome and the target cell PM, which has
resulted in the visualization of the deployed T3SS
translocon complex. Importantly, given the highly
conserved nature of the T3SSs among many
Gram-negative bacteria, our studies have broad

Bacterial strains
The minicell producing S.Typhimurium DminD, which is referred to in this study as wild-type, has
been previously described (Carleton et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017). Mutations in the genes encoding
the translocases (DsipB, DsipC) or tip complex (DsipD) proteins where introduced in into the DminD
S. Typhimurium strain by allelic exchange as previously described (Lara-Tejero et al., 2011). The
strains were listed in Key Resources Table.
Isolation of minicells
Minicell producing bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37˚C in LB containing 0.3M NaCl. Fresh
cultures were prepared from a 1:100 dilution of the overnight culture and then grown at 37˚C to late
log phase in the presence of ampicillin (200 mg/mL) and L-arabinose (0.1%) to induce the expression
of regulatory protein HilA and thus increase the number of injectisomes partitioning to the minicells
(Carleton et al., 2013). To enrich for minicells, the culture was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 min to
remove bacterial cells, and the supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min
to collect the minicells. The minicell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium
(DMEM) prior to their application to cultured HeLa cells.
Antibody labeling
Minicells expressing 3xFLAG-epitope-tagged versions of SipB, SipC, and SipD were incubated with
a saturating amount of anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 by volume) for 30 min at room temperature.
After incubation, minicells were pelleted and resuspended in a fresh LB broth containing ampicillin
(200 mg/ml) for 3 times to remove unbound antibodies.

 HeLa cell culture on EM grid and infection
HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50
mg/ml). The day before plating, gold EM grids with 2/1 Quantifoil were placed in glass bottom Mat-
Tek dishes (facilitating fluorescence imaging and removal for cryo-preservation) and coated with 0.1
mg/ml poly-D-lysine overnight at 37˚C. After rinsing the grids with sterile water, freshly trypsinized
HeLa cells were plated on top of the pre-treated grids that were allowed to grow overnight at 37˚C/
5% CO2. To infect HeLa cells with S. Typhimurium minicells, grids with adherent HeLa cells were
removed from the culture dish and minicells were directly applied to the grids.
Vitrification and cryoEM sample preparation
At different time points after infection, the EM grids with HeLa cells and S. Typhimurium minicells
were blotted with filter paper and vitrified in liquid ethane using a gravity-driven plunger apparatus
as described (Hu et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2015).
Cryo-ET data collection and reconstruction
The frozen-hydrated specimens were imaged with 300kV electron microscopes. 713 tomograms
were acquired from single-axis tilt series at ~6 mm defocus with cumulative does of ~80 e�/A
˚ 2 using
Polara equipped with a field emission gun and a direct detection device (Gatan K2 Summit). 313
tomograms were acquired from single-axis tilt series at ~1 mm defocus with cumulative does of ~50
e�/A
˚ 2 using Titan Krios equipped with a field emission gun, an energy filter, Volta phase plate, and a
direct detection device (Gatan K2 Summit). The tomographic package SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005)
was utilized to collect 35 image stacks at a range of tilt angles between �51˚ and +51˚ for each data
set. Each stack contained 10–15 images, which were first aligned using Motioncorr (Li et al., 2013)
and were then assembled into the drift-corrected stacks by TOMOAUTO (Hu et al., 2015). The
drift-corrected stacks were aligned and reconstructed by using marker-free alignment (Winkler and
Taylor, 2006) or IMOD marker-dependent alignment (Kremer et al., 1996). In total, 1051 tomo-
grams (3,600 � 3,600 � 400 pixels) were generated for detailed examination of the Salmonella-host
interactions (Table 2). The softwares used in the study were listed in Key Resources Table.
Sub-tomogram analysis
Sub-tomogram analysis was accomplished as described previously (Hu et al., 2015) to analyze over
700 injectisomes extracted from 458 tomograms. Briefly, we first identified the injectisomes visually
on each minicell. Two coordinates along the needle were used to estimate the initial orientation of
each particle assembly. For initial analysis, 4 � 4 � 4 binned sub-tomograms (128 � 128 � 128 vox-
els) of the intact injectisome were used for alignment and averaging by using the tomographic pack-
age I3 (Winkler and Taylor, 2006; Winkler et al., 2009). Then multivariate statistical analysis and
hierarchical ascendant classification were used to analyze the needle tip complex (Winkler et al.,
2009).
3-D visualization and molecular modeling
Outer membrane (OM) and inner membrane (IM) of S. Typhimurium, Plasma membrane (PM) of
HeLa cells, actin filaments, and ribosomes were segmented using EMAN2 (Chen et al., 2017). UCSF
Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018) were used to visualize
the sub-tomogram average structures in 3-D and build atomic model of the T3SS injectisome. The
atomic model was built as described briefly (Hu et al., 2017) except for the basal body, which we
docked PDB-5TCR (Worrall et al., 2016) and PDB-3J1W (Bergeron et al., 2013). Video clips for the
supplemental videos were generated using UCSF Chimera, UCSF Chimera X, and IMOD, and edited
with iMovie.
Distance measurement and statistical analysis
IMOD (3dmod Graph) was used to measure lengths (in pixels) of various features. Each measurement
was recorded in MS Excel for statistical analysis: Mean, standard deviation, standard error of mean,
and Welch’s t-test.
