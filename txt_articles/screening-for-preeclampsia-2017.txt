Screening for Preeclampsia
US Preventive Services Task Force
Recommendation Statement
US Preventive Services Task Force
IMPORTANCE Preeclampsia affects approximately 4% of pregnancies in the United States.
It is the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and may lead to serious
maternal complications, including stroke, eclampsia, and organ failure. Adverse perinatal
outcomes for the fetus and newborn include intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight,
and stillbirth. Many of the complications associated with preeclampsia lead to early induction
of labor or cesarean delivery and subsequent preterm birth.
SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS Preeclampsia is more prevalent among African American
women than among white women. Differences in prevalence may be, in part, due to
African American women being disproportionally affected by risk factors for preeclampsia.
African American women also have case fatality rates related to preeclampsia 3 times higher
than rates among white women. Inequalities in access to adequate prenatal care may
contribute to poor outcomes associated with preeclampsia in African American women.
OBJECTIVE To update the 1996 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommendation on screening for preeclampsia.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening and
diagnostic tests for preeclampsia, the potential benefits and harms of screening for
preeclampsia, the effectiveness of risk prediction tools, and the benefits and harms
of treatment of screen-detected preeclampsia.
FINDINGS Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity
and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of blood pressure measurements, the
USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial
benefit for the mother and infant. In addition, there is adequate evidence to bound the harms
of screening for and treatment of preeclampsia as no greater than small. Therefore, the
USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of screening
for preeclampsia in pregnant women.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for preeclampsia
in pregnant women with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy.

Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF recommends screening for preeclampsia in pregnant
women with blood pressure measurements throughout preg-
nancy (B recommendation) (Figure 1).
Rationale
Importance
Preeclampsia, a relatively common hypertensive disorder occur-
ring during pregnancy, affects approximately 4% of pregnancies in
theUnitedStates.1Ithasmultiplesubtypesandpotentiallyserious,
evenfatalhealthoutcomes.2,3Althoughpregnantwomencanhave
otherhypertensiveconditionsalongwithpreeclampsia,preeclamp-
sia is defined as new-onset hypertension (or, in patients with exist-
inghypertension,worseninghypertension)occurringafter20weeks
of gestation, combined with either new-onset proteinuria (excess
protein in the urine) or other signs or symptoms involving multiple
organ systems. The specific etiology of preeclampsia is unclear.2-6
Preeclampsia can lead to poor health outcomes in both the mother
and infant. It is the second leading cause of maternal mortality
worldwide7,8 and may also lead to other serious maternal compli-
cations,includingstroke,eclampsia,andorganfailure.Adverseperi-
natal outcomes for the fetus and newborn include intrauterine
growthrestriction,lowbirthweight,andstillbirth.Manyofthecom-
plicationsassociatedwithpreeclampsialeadtoearlyinductionofla-
bor or cesarean delivery and subsequent preterm birth.
Detection
Obtaining blood pressure measurements to screen for preeclamp-
sia could allow for early identification and diagnosis of the condi-
tion, resulting in close surveillance and effective treatment to pre-
ventseriouscomplications.TheUSPSTFhaspreviouslyestablished
that there is adequate evidence on the accuracy of blood pressure
measurements to screen for preeclampsia.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that testing for protein
in the urine with a dipstick test has low diagnostic accuracy for de-
tecting proteinuria in pregnancy.
Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment
Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome. It can quickly evolve into a se-
verediseasethatcanresultinserious,evenfatalhealthoutcomesfor
the mother and infant. The ability to screen for preeclampsia using
blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effec-
tivelytreatapotentiallyunpredictableandfatalcondition.TheUSPSTF
foundadequateevidencethatthewell-establishedtreatmentsofpre-
eclampsia result in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant by
reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness
ofriskpredictiontools(eg,clinicalindicators,serummarkers,oruter-
ine artery pulsatility index) that would support different screening
strategies for predicting preeclampsia.
Harms of Early Detection and Treatment
TheUSPSTFfoundadequateevidencetoboundthepotentialharms
of screening for and treatment of preeclampsia as no greater than
small. This assessment was based on the known harms of treatment
with antihypertension medications, induced labor, and magnesium
sulfate;thelikelyfewharmsfromscreeningwithbloodpressuremea-
surements;andthepotentialpoormaternalandperinataloutcomes
resulting from severe untreated preeclampsia and eclampsia. The
USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of risk prediction.
USPSTF Assessment
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for
preeclampsia in pregnant women with blood pressure measure-
ments has a substantial net benefit.
Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
Thisrecommendationappliestopregnantwomenwithoutaknown
diagnosis of preeclampsia or hypertension (Figure 2).
Assessment of Risk
All pregnant women are at risk for preeclampsia and should be
screened. Important clinical conditions associated with increased
risk for preeclampsia include a history of eclampsia or preeclampsia
(particularlyearly-onsetpreeclampsia),apreviousadversepregnancy
outcome,maternalcomorbidconditions(includingtype1or2diabe-
tespriortopregnancy,gestationaldiabetes,chronichypertension,re-
nal disease, and autoimmune diseases), and multifetal gestation.4,9
Other risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, African American race,
low socioeconomic status, and advanced maternal age.4,9
IntheUnitedStates,preeclampsiaismoreprevalentamongAfri-
can American women than among white women. Differences in
prevalence may be, in part, due to African American women being
disproportionally affected by risk factors for preeclampsia. African
American women have case fatality rates related to preeclampsia 3
times higher than rates among white women (73.5 vs 27.4 per
100 000cases).4,10-12Higherprevalenceandcasefatalityratesfac-
tor into why African American women are 3 times more likely to die

Suggestions for Practice
B
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or
there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
Offer or provide this service.
C
The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients
based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty
that the net benefit is small.
Offer or provide this service for selected
patients depending on individual
circumstances.
D
The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service
has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

on multiple measurements.
Treatment
Management strategies for diagnosed preeclampsia include close
fetal and maternal monitoring, antihypertension medications, and
magnesium sulfate.4,5
Additional Approaches to Prevention
The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as
preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who
are at high risk for preeclampsia.9
Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
TheUSPSTFhasidentifiedseveralresearchgaps.Moreresearchon
the complex pathophysiology of preeclampsia is needed to better
understand and define its subtypes and their risks to maternal and

ing tools targeting its various subtypes and different study popula-

tions in current preeclampsia screening practices in various types
of health care settings would be helpful for identifying alternative
screening approaches to evaluate in clinical studies. Research ex-
amining screening algorithms and new markers for screening are
needed. Studies are needed to further develop and validate tools
for risk prediction using rigorous methodology, including appropri-
ate calibration statistics and validated models that use parameters
availableinroutinecare(eg,clinicalhistoryandclinicaltesting).Large
studies are needed to compare different approaches to screening
and effects on maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as
long-term health outcomes.
Further evaluation of the accuracy of the protein to creatinine
ratio in point-of-care urine testing in general populations and re-
peat testing could better determine the optimal role of the ratio for
detecting proteinuria. Research to evaluate the effects of changing
diagnostic criteria on screening practices is also needed.
Discussion
Burden of Disease
Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome defined by new-onset hyper-
tension after 20 weeks of gestation. Proteinuria is often but not al-
ways present. Recent guidance indicates that a preeclampsia diag-
nosis can be made without proteinuria when other clinical signs or
symptoms are present.5

All pregnant women are at risk for preeclampsia and should be screened. Important clinical conditions associated with increased
risk include a history of eclampsia or preeclampsia (particularly early-onset preeclampsia), previous adverse pregnancy outcome,
maternal comorbid conditions (type 1 or 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, and autoimmune
diseases), and multifetal gestation. Other risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, African American race, low socioeconomic status,
and advanced maternal age.
Blood pressure measurements are routinely used to screen for preeclampsia. The patient’s blood pressure should be measured while
she is relaxed, quiet, and in a sitting position, with her legs uncrossed and her back supported. The patient’s arm should be at the level
of the right atrium of the heart. If the patient’s upper arm circumference is ≥33 cm, a large blood pressure cuff should be used.
Blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout pregnancy. If a patient has an elevated
blood pressure reading, the reading should be confirmed with repeated measurements.
Management strategies for diagnosed preeclampsia may include close fetal and maternal monitoring, antihypertension medications,
and magnesium sulfate.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women.
The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women at high
risk for preeclampsia. This recommendation is available on the USPSTF website (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).

development, possibly resulting in increased oxidative stress and
a maternal inflammatory response.2-4 However, these 2 processes
may occur alone or in combination.
Preeclampsia is a relatively common condition in pregnancy,
affecting an estimated 2% to 8% of pregnancies worldwide.4,7,8
Approximately 9% of maternal deaths in the United States are di-
rectly attributed to preeclampsia and eclampsia,4,19 and more than
one-third of severe obstetric complications are associated with
preeclampsia.4,20 Maternal complications include cerebrovascular
bleeding,retinaldetachment,andHELLP(hemolysis,elevatedliver
enzyme levels, and low platelet counts) syndrome. Approximately
1% to 2% of preeclampsia cases lead to eclampsia, a severe mani-
festation of the syndrome characterized by seizures and complica-
tions such as brain damage, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary
edema, placental abruption, disseminated coagulopathy, acute re-
nal failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, and coma.4,8
Fetalandneonatalcomplicationsofpreeclampsiaincludeintra-
uterinegrowthrestriction,oligohydramnios,placentalabruption,neo-
natal intensive care unit admission, stillbirth, and neonatal death.
Delivery of the fetus is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia; as
a result, preeclampsia is a leading cause of medically indicated in-
duced preterm birth and low birth weight in the United States.4,21
Infants born to mothers with preeclampsia account for 6% of pre-
termbirthsand19%ofmedicallyindicatedinducedpretermbirths.4,21
Most cases of preeclampsia occur after 34 weeks of gestation.
Preterm infants (ie, those born before 37 weeks of gestation) are at
increased risk of morbidity and mortality; the risk of poor outcomes
increases with earlier delivery.4,22
Scope of Review

dence on screening for preeclampsia.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF has previously assessed the accuracy of blood pres-
suremeasurementstoidentifyhypertensioninadultsasadequate.13
Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests
There are several tests for proteinuria, including the protein to cre-
atinine ratio urine test, albumin to creatinine ratio urine test, urine
protein dipstick test, and 24-hour urine protein test. Although the
24-hour urine protein test is the gold standard, it is not practical for
use in primary care. The USPSTF found variable and limited evi-
dence on the accuracy of these tests.
Fourteen studies (n = 1888; 4 good quality and 10 fair quality)
assessedthediagnosticaccuracyofurinetestsindetectingprotein-
uriacomparedwith24-hoururinecollection(goldstandard).Twelve
studies assessed the protein to creatinine ratio urine test, 2 studies
assessedthealbumintocreatinineratiourinetest,and4studiesas-
sessed the urine protein dipstick test. Evidence on the accuracy of
repeat testing was not found.4 All studies of urine protein test per-
formance were conducted among pregnant women with sus-
pected preeclampsia. Six studies took place in the United States,
4 in the United Kingdom, and 1 each in New Zealand, Canada, Chile,
andtheNetherlands.4Meta-analysiswasnotperformedduetoclini-
cal and statistical heterogeneity across the studies.4
Sensitivity of the protein to creatinine ratio urine test ranged
from 0.65 to 0.96 (I2 = 80.5%; 11 studies), with most studies
reporting sensitivity greater than 0.81; specificity ranged from 0.49
to 1.00 (I2 = 91.8%; 11 studies). The albumin to creatinine ratio urine
test (2 studies) had high sensitivity (0.94 and 1.00) and dissimilar
specificity (0.94 and 0.68).4 The automated urine protein dipstick
test (4 studies) had sensitivity ranging from 0.22 to 1.00 and speci-
ficity ranging from 0.36 to 1.00.4 One automated urine protein dip-
stick test had both specificity and sensitivity near 0.80. The
remaining studies found either high sensitivity and low specificity
or vice versa.4
Performanceofurinetestsforproteinvariedwidely.Issuessuch
as limited information on the diversity of index tests used, study
eligibility criteria, prevalence of proteinuria, spectrum bias, and
heterogeneity limit the conclusions that can be made about the ac-
curacy of urine tests for protein in routine clinical care. In addition,
the studies were conducted among pregnant women with sus-
pected preeclampsia and not in the general asymptomatic preg-
nant population typically found in primary care.4
Evidence suggests that automated tests have better test per-
formancethanmanuallyreadtests.Thetimeofdayoftestingisnot

erally used in the first trimester of routine prenatal care.4 None of
the risk models were based solely on patient history or clinical indi-
cators that could be captured during prenatal visits.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No studies directly compared the effectiveness of screening for
preeclampsia on health outcomes in a screened vs unscreened
population. One randomized clinical trial examined the benefits
and harms of a reduced prenatal visit schedule. This trial was an
opportunity to evaluate a specific screening approach compared
with the standard of care. This fair-quality trial (n = 2764) among
low-risk pregnant women showed that fewer prenatal care visits
(9 vs 14 visits) did not result in worse maternal or neonatal health
outcomes at delivery. However, the mean difference in the number
of visits between groups was smaller than intended (12.0 [SD, 4.2]
vs 14.7 [SD, 4.2]; P < .001), and the study was underpowered to
detect difference for some health outcomes. In addition, the trial
was published nearly 20 years ago, and there have since been
changes to clinical practice in the United States.4,23

Although the USPSTF found no recent studies on the direct
effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia in improving health
outcomes, trial evidence and extensive clinical experience provide
evidence of effective treatments for preeclampsia. Antihyperten-
sion medications, when indicated, and administration of magne-
sium sulfate reduce the risk of adverse events. The Magpie Trial
(n = 10 141), an international randomized clinical trial of treatment
with magnesium sulfate, showed a benefit for preventing eclamp-
sia. Pregnant women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia who
were given magnesium sulfate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia
(95% CI, 40%-71%) than women who received placebo.4,24
Incidence of placental abruption was significantly lower in the
treatment group, and there was no evidence of short- or longer-
term (�2 years) harms from treatment for the mother or infant.4,24
A Cochrane review of anticonvulsant management of preeclampsia
found that treatment with magnesium sulfate reduced the risk
of eclampsia by more than half and also likely reduced maternal
mortality.4,25

or neonatal outcomes.4,26
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found
good-quality evidence that measuring blood pressure has few ma-
jor harms.13 The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of
screening for and risk prediction of preeclampsia.
The USPSTF identified 2 fair-quality studies that reported on
potential harms of alternative approaches to screening for pre-
eclampsia. Neither study found evidence of harms, but both were
underpowered to provide evidence on rare clinical outcomes.
One was a fair-quality trial (n = 2764) that found no difference in
birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight, preterm birth, or cesarean
delivery) when the number of prenatal care visits was reduced
from 14 to 9 visits.4,23 As noted earlier, this trial was not suffi-
ciently powered to detect differences for rare outcomes related
to preeclampsia such as progression to eclampsia, organ failure,
stroke, and death.
The second study was a fair-quality, retrospective, before-
after comparison cohort study (n = 1952) of low-income pregnant
Hispanicwomen.Thestudydidnotidentifyanyharmsrelatedtopre-
eclampsia diagnosis and birth outcomes when targeted urine pro-
teinscreeningwasusedforspecificindicationsonlycomparedwith
routine use in prenatal care.4,27
One fair-quality prospective cohort study (n = 255) con-
ducted in Spain found no difference in anxiety before and after
counseling on preeclampsia risk and categorization as high or low
risk based on results of a multivariable risk prediction model.
High-risk women were subject to changes in their clinical care,
and the low-risk group received usual care. Measures of anxiety
over time did not change but were collected from less than half of
the study participants.4,28
The potential harms of treating preeclampsia are well estab-
lishedandincludepretermdelivery,neonatalcomplications,cesar-
eandelivery,andadverseeffectsfrommagnesiumsulfate(eg,nau-
sea,headache,blurryvision,andfloppyinfant)andantihypertension
medications (eg, fatigue, headache, and nausea).29
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and peri-
natal morbidity and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of
blood pressure measurements, the USPSTF found adequate evi-
dence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial ben-
efit for the mother and infant. In addition, there is adequate evi-
dence to bound the harms of screening for and treatment of
preeclampsia as no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF con-
cludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net ben-
efit of screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome among a range of hyperten-
sion disorders occurring during pregnancy. Preeclampsia may in-
volve abnormal formation of uterine arteries during placental de-
velopmentorincreasedoxidativestressandamaternalinflammatory
response(orboth).2-4Althoughtheconditionmayremainstableun-
til delivery, it can rapidly and unpredictably result in serious, even
fatal health outcomes for the mother and infant.4
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for
public comment on the USPSTF website from September 27 to
October 24, 2016. Some comments requested elaboration on the
urine protein dipstick test. In response, the USPSTF addressed test-
ing for proteinuria in the Clinical Considerations and Rationale sec-
tions. Some comments requested more information on screening
intervals, which is provided in the Clinical Considerations. Other
comments requested clarification about risk prediction of pre-
eclampsia. In response, the USPSTF added information about risk
prediction models to the Rationale and Discussion sections.
Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation

statementonscreeningforpreeclampsiawithbloodpressuremea-

Recommendations of Others
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada rec-
ommends that the diagnosis of hypertension be based on office
or in-hospital blood pressure measurements and that all pregnant
women should be assessed for proteinuria. It does not recom-
mend screening with biomarkers or Doppler ultrasonography.30
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recom-
mends screening for preeclampsia by obtaining blood pressure
measurements and urinalysis for proteinuria at each antenatal
visit.31 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
