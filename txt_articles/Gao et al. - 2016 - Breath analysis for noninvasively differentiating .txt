Abstract
A number of multiresistant pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) place a 
heavy burden on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in intensive care units (ICU). It is 
critically important to differentiate between bacterial infection and colonization to avoid prescribing 
unnecessary antibiotics. Quantitative culture of lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens, however, 
requires invasive procedures. Nowadays, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been studied in 
vitro and in vivo to identify pathogen-derived biomarkers. Therefore, an exploratory pilot study was 
conceived for a proof of concept that the appearance and level of A. baumannii-derived metabolites 
might be correlated with the presence of the pathogen and its ecological niche (i.e. the infection and 
colonization states) in ICU ventilated patients.
Twenty patients with A. baumannii VAP (infection group), 20 ventilated patients with LRT A. 
baumannii colonization (colonization group) and 20 ventilated patients with neurological disorders, 
but without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization (control group) were enrolled in the in vivo 
pilot study. A clinical isolate of A. baumannii strains was used for the in vitro culture experiment. 
The adsorptive preconcentration (solid-phase microextraction fiber and Tenax® TA) and analysis 
technique of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were applied in the studies.
Breath profiles could be visually differentiated between A. baumannii cultivation in vitro and 
culture medium, and among in vivo groups. In the in vitro experiment, nine compounds of interest 
(2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 1-undecene, isopentyl 3-methylbutanoate, decanal, 1,3-naphthalenediol, 
longifolene, tetradecane, iminodibenzyl and 3-methyl-indene) in the headspace were found to 
be possible A. baumannii derivations. While there were eight target VOCs (1-undecene, nonanal, 
decanal, 2,6,10-trimethyl-dodecane, 5-methyl-5-propyl-nonane, longifolene, tetradecane and 
2-butyl-1-octanol) exhibiting characteristics of A. baumannii VAP derivations. The selected VOC 
profile in vivo could be adopted to efficiently differentiate the presence of LRT A. baumannii from its 
absence, and LRT A. baumannii infection from its colonization (AUC  =  0.89 and 0.88, respectively).
It is not feasible to simply transfer the metabolic biomarkers from the in vitro condition to in 
vivo. The direct detection of exhaled A. baumannii-derived VOCs may be adopted for an early alert 
of the LRT bacterial presence in ventilated ICU patients, and even in different parasitic states of A. 
baumannii (i.e. infection and colonization). However, further refinement and validation are required 
before its clinical use.

1. Introduction
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a subset of 
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or nosocomial 
infection, represents a significant cause of morbidity, 
mortality and resource utilization within intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients. The mortality attributed to VAP is 
estimated to be 6–10% [1, 2]. Late-onset VAP is most 
critical due to infection with multiresistant pathogens. 
In fact, multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively 
drug-resistant (XDR), or pandrug-resistant (PDR) 
pathogens currently pose a serious threat to clinical 
practice, especially the prevalence of carbapenemase-
producing Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), including 
Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) [3, 4]. 
A. baumannii infections in critically ill patients 
were therefore associated with increased mortality 
[5, 6]. CHINET 2014 surveillance of bacterial 
resistance in China illustrated the serious resistance 
problem of clinical bacterial isolates, including 
 
A. baumannii. Approximately 65% of Acinetobacter spp.  
(A. baumannii accounts for 93.0%) strains were 
resistant to carbapenem antibiotics [7]. VAP was the 
predominant infection that the pathogenic bacterium 
A. baumannii was responsible for, and the mortality rate 
of A. baumannii VAP ranged from 35–60% [8, 9].
Acinetobacter spp. strains are non-fermentative, 
strictly aerobic and opportunistic bacterial pathogens, 
of which A. baumannii has been the most frequently 
discovered from clinical isolates. It can contaminate 
inanimate hospital surfaces and devices, and colonize 
patients’ normal skin, wounds or oropharynx. Res-
piratory tract colonization is common in intubated 
patients, which has been regarded as a high risk factor 
for VAP. It is a vital challenge to differentiate coloniza-
tion from infection. Failure to do this often results in the 
unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, and the subse-
quent aggravation of antimicrobial resistance.
Breath volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis 
has increasingly attracted clinicians’ interest, due to its 
noninvasiveness and rapidity. Various respiratory dis-
eases including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, cancer 
and tuberculosis, have been studied for their respective 
breath VOC profiles [10–14]. Several typical breath 
tests have been approved by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for diag 
nostic and screen-
ing tools in humans [15]. Their clinical uses include 
the detection of breath ethanol and acetaldehyde con-
centrations after alcohol consumption, 13C-urea or 
ammonia breath tests for the diagnosis of Helicobacter 
pylori infection, breath carbon dioxide concentration 
monitoring (i.e. capnography) for use in anesthe-
sia and intensive care, and nitric oxide test for asthma 
 
screening.
It is of great value to seek specific pathogen-derived 
volatile metabolites in breath for the underlying micro-
bial etiology identification of pneumonia, though cer-
tain endogenously produced biomarkers in breath have 
been reported to be derived from the host, not the path-
ogen. These host-derived volatiles include saturated 
hydrocarbons, such as pentane, propane, malondial-
dehyde and methylated hydrocarbons involved in lipid 
peroxidation, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as 
isoprene involved in the mevalonic pathway of choles-
terol synthesis [16]. To identify the pathogen-derived 
or pathogen-specific VOCs, many viruses and bacteria 
have been cultured in vitro and analyzed, including 
the influenza virus, human rhinovirus, Enterococcus 
 
faecalis, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa (P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) 
and Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) [17–20]. 
These microorganisms constantly induce VAP. Of the 
above bacteria, some VOCs were discovered to be emit-
ted by more than one strain, yet several were found to 
be potentially exclusive, which was properly reviewed 
by Bos et al [21]. Additionally, the aim should be shifted 
from finding one single VOC representative of the 
presence or absence of a specific pathogen, to exploring 
entire VOC fingerprints, i.e. the volatome. The concen-
tration profile of volatile compounds is likely correlated 
with the course of bacterial metabolism and host– 
pathogen interactions. To date, the prevalent bacterium 
A. baumannii has not been critically involved, which 
was frequently separated in lower respiratory tract 
(LRT) specimens of VAP. Several recently published 
reports associated with VAP and its breath VOC profile 
have implicated multiple different types of pathogens, 
and the limited number and heterogeneity of subjects, 
thus hindering the identification of specific strain-
derived VOCs in vivo [22–24].
We conducted this prospective pilot study to test 
 
the primary hypothesis that exhaled A. baumannii-
derived VOCs could be used for an early alert of the 
presence of LRT bacteria in ventilated ICU patients. We 
further hypothesized that the metabolite concentration 
profiles might be associated with the different states of 
A. baumannii infection and colonization.
2. Materials and methods
The study was performed at the 52-bed adult mixed-
ICU of the tertiary teaching hospital (Sir Run Run 
Shaw Hospital, SRRSH), Zhejiang University, China, 
over a period of 24 months, from February 2014 to 
February 2016. The study was approved by the SRRSH 
Ethics Committee (protocol number 20130703-4) and 
adhered to the ethical principles for medical research 
involving human subjects from the World Medical 
Association Declaration of Helsinki [25]. Informed 
consent was required from the patient, family/relative, 
guardian, or proxy according to Chinese law. The study 
taken here was explorative and the findings obtained 
had no impact on patient care.
2.1. Definitions of VAP and colonization
Because most definitions of VAP lack perfect sensitivity 
and specificity, we chose a combination of the two

J Gao et al
widely used VAP criteria, the clinical pulmonary 
infection score (CPIS) and the definition from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
of America (tables 1 and 2). The CPIS was initially 
developed by Pugin et al [26], and later modified 
by Luna et al [27]. This diagnostic tool for VAP was 
recommended by the American Thoracic Society and 
the Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) 
[28]. The cut-off value of six was adopted for pulmonary 
infection diagnosis. Ventilator setting parameters were 
added to the streamlined surveillance definition of 
CDC, to promote the sensitivity and specificity of the 
VAP diagnosis [29]. Chest radiographs were judged by 
one radiological specialist and one clinical attending 
doctor, who were both blinded to the study procedure. 
Quantitative cultures from LRT specimens, including 
endotracheal aspirate (ETA), bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL) and protected specimen brush (PSB) samples, 
were taken to guide the choice of antibiotic therapy.
Respiratory tract A. baumannii colonization was 
defined by the bacterium A. baumannii cultured and 
isolated from LRT specimens, but the VAP standard and 
bacterial threshold of quantitative culture, as described 
above, could not be reached. The diagnosis of VAP due 
to A. baumannii infection or just its respiratory tract 
colonization was decided by two clinical attending doc-
tors independent of the study, based on the above two 
VAP criteria.
2.2. Admission criteria and clinical practice
Twenty critically ill patients with identified A. baumannii 
VAP (infection group) and 20 critical care patients 
requiring ventilation with defined respiratory tract 
A. baumannii colonization (colonization group) were 
enrolled. Of these, seven patients overlapped, which 
meant that A. baumannii VAP and its respiratory 
tract colonization occurred to them during different 
stages of the ICU stay. These two groups could be 
combined as a group with the presence of A. baumannii 
(bacterium group). Another 20 ventilated patients 
with neurological disorders, but without pneumonia 
or respiratory tract A. baumannii colonization were 
included as a negative control (control group). Patients 
with confirmed structural lung diseases, such as COPD, 
respiratory tract neoplasms and asthma were excluded.
In our present study, the LRT microbiological spec-
trum varied, particularly with antibiotic usage, dur-
ing the ICU stay of the enrolled patients. These LRT 
 
pathogens were also cultured and isolated before or 
after this A. baumannii VAP or colonization episode 
(i.e. the time point of breath sampling). Actually, we 
chose the time point for breath sampling under the con-
dition that the only LRT microorganism isolated was 
A. baumannii, and the duration of positive culture was 
at least 3 d. The condition of LRT co-existing micro-
organisms (co-infection or co-colonization or both 
crossed) was deliberately excluded for breath sampling 
in our present study.
The LRT specimens taken with a fiberoptic bron-
choscope (BAL and PSB) or without (ETA) were stored 
in a sterile sealed container. Then, the samples were 
transferred quickly to the microbiology laboratory 
(<1 h) or temporarily preserved under the conditions 
of 2 °C–8 °C. The standardized procedure for specimen 
inoculation, smear, Gram staining, and quantitative or 
semi-quantitative cultivation was performed according 
to the guidelines from the American Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Chinese Stand-
ard for Bacterial Culture Procedures of Lower Respira-
tory Tract Infections. The blood biomarkers for liver, 
renal and inflammation intensity were tested daily or 
every two days routinely. The results of the para 
meters 
detected at a time closest to breath sampling were 
recorded for the following analysis.
Characteristics of all eligible patients were recorded, 
such as age, gender, diagnosis, smoking history, serum 
markers for liver and renal function (e.g. bilirubin, 
alanine transaminase (ALT); aspartate transaminase 
(AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), alka-
line phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
urea and creatinine), blood biomarkers for infection 
besides core temperature (e.g. white blood cell (WBC), 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT)), 
sources of the LRT specimen (e.g. ETA, BAL and PSB), 
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)/oxygen con-
centration in inspired air (FiO2) and antibiotic usage.
The prescription of antimicrobial agents was per-
formed in accordance with the guideline from a Chi-
nese consensus statement on clinical management and 
infection control of the infections induced by XDR 
GNB [30]. Other routine therapies, such as a head 
elevation, prophylaxis of peptic ulcer and deep vein 
thrombosis, sedative and analgesic supervision, ventila-
tion adjustment and weaning were executed according 
to the corresponding standardized clinical protocols by 
two independent attending doctors.

2.3. In vitro experiment
In order to determine which substances in the breath 
gas were potentially A. baumannii-derived, an in 
vitro experiment was simultaneously conducted with 
microbial cultures at comparable densities to the in 
vivo setting. A clinical isolate of an A. baumannii strain 
was used for the present in vitro experiment, which 
was inoculated at 102 cfu ml−1 in 1 ml. The strain’s 
serial dilution within sterile physiological saline for 
inoculation was determined by turbidometry, and the 
finishing suspension was confirmed by a quantitative 
plate count. The culture was incubated at 37.0 °C for 12 h 
in a standard BacT/ALERT® SA (Aerobic bioMerieux, 
Inc., Durham, NC, USA) plastic disposable bottle 
containing 40 ml medium. Uninoculated medium 
underwent the same procedure as the negative control. 
Forty bottle cultures and another forty corresponding 
controls were available for the following treatment.
The methods for strain cultivation, headspace gas 
extraction, thermal desorption and gas chromatogra-
phy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, QP2010 Plus, Shi-
madzu®) settings have been detailed elsewhere [13, 
31], and they were utilized with certain revisions in this 
experiment. Briefly, a solid-phase microextraction fiber 
(SPME; divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane 
(DVB/CAR/PDMS) 50/30 μm; Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for the preconcentration 
of the volatile compounds in the headspace, through 
exposure in a culture bottle for 60 min at 37 °C. Then, 
the SPME fiber was inserted into the GC inlet and the 
adsorbed headspace chemicals were desorbed for 2 min 
at 250 °C. The GC cycle was set as follows: 6 min hold at 
55 °C followed by 7 °C min−1 ramp to 97 °C, 2 min hold 
followed by 2 °C min−1 ramp to 110 °C, 5 °C min−1 ramp 
 
to 130 °C, 4 min hold followed by 5 °C min−1 ramp to 
 
160 °C, 4 min hold followed by 4 °C min−1 ramp to 
 
230 °C, 10 °C min−1 ramp to 280 °C and hold 4 min. 
The constant flow rate of 1.8 ml min−1 was adopted for 
helium as a carrier gas. The total ion chromatogram 
(TIC) mode within the range of 35–350 m/z was used 
for the identification of potential target compounds.
The target compound (i.e. A. baumannii-derived 
compound) was defined as the level of which in the 
headspace from bacterial cultivation increased by 
comparing with that from medium control. Only the 
produced VOC was considered as a target, as the VOC 
consumed in metabolism (i.e. with a decreased level by 
comparison) was probably based on different culture 
medium.
2.4. Breath sample collection and GC-MS analysis
The instrumentation as well as procedure for breath 
sample collection, thermal desorption and subsequent 
GC-MS analysis were performed according to previous 
descriptions with some modifications (figure 1) [22, 32, 
33]. In brief, a T-piece (polytetrafluoroethylene) was 
connected to the expiratory tube for breath sampling. 
The length of the transfer line from the T-piece to the 
sorption tube was approximately 50 cm. All samples 
were collected in triplicate. In the present study, the oral 
tracheal tube (Mallinchrodt™, COVIDIEN™, Mexico, 
USA) and ventilator (Puritan Bennett 7200 and 840) 
were available. The preconditioned Tenax® TA steel-
tube (PerkinElmer®, a porous polymer 2,6-diphenyl 
furan resin, 60/80 mesh, 200 mg) was placed in an 
airtight stainless cylinder (internal diameter 26 mm) 
with a temperature controller. The cylinder was 
thermostated at 40 °C during the adsorption process, 
to avoid excessive water vapor sorption. The gas 
samples were preconcentrated by adsorption on the 
stainless tube, with the flow generated by a vacuum 
pump at a rate of 200 ml min−1 for 20 min. Therefore, 
approximately 4 l of expiratory gas was adsorbed in the 
Tenax tube.
The sample with Tenax TA was thermally desorbed 
inside a thermal desorption unit. Firstly, the tube was 
heated to 250 °C within 2.5 mins, and simultaneously 
the sample was relocated onto a trap at  −10 °C. The 
cold trap was then heated to 250 °C at 40 °C s−1, and 
volatiles were transferred to the chromatographic col-
umn for separation. A GC capillary column (Rtx-5MS, 
film thickness 0.25 μm, inner diameter 0.25 mm, length 
30.0 m, dimethylpolysiloxane) was used. The temper-
ature program of the column was set as follows: 40 °C 
held for 1 min, then ramped 5 °C min−1 up to 250 °C, 
and an isothermal hold for 1 min. The constant helium

flow rate of 0.47 ml min−1 was used as a carrier gas. The 
TIC mode within the 20–200 m/z range was applied 
by MS for the identification of potential target com-
pounds. A high-precision molybdenum quadrupole 
mass filter/analyzer was available for the detection of 
product ions.
GC-MSSolution (LabSolutions, Shimadzu®) and 
Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identifi-
cation System (AMDIS, NIST) software were available 
for raw data preprocessing, including denoising, base-
line correction (the drift and slope parameters were pre-
set), resolution of overlapped chromatographic peaks 
and alignment. The detected compounds corresp-
onding to the peaks were identified by spectra match-
ing with the above software and Mass Spectral Library 
(NIST 05). The retention time and mass spectrum simi-
larities were used to identify the compounds of interest 
[23, 34]. The highest similarity matches were presumed 
to be the most likely candidate compounds. Manual 
checking was initiated for cautious identification if the 
similarity matching results were less than 80%. The 
area under the curve (AUC) of each chromatographic 
peak was associated with one quantity of compound. 
Because we emphasized the different breath profiles 
between A. baumannii VAP and its colonization in ven-
tilated patients, we did not measure the absolute VOCs 
quantities using pure substances.
The ‘20% rule’, which was introduced by Profes-
sor van Schooten et al, was applied for data selection 
[20, 35]. Briefly, a variable was adopted when nonzero 
data were available for at least 20% of all samples within 
at least one of the experimental groups. Certain com-
pounds, including siloxanes, phthalate and adipate 
plasticizers, e.g. bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and its deg-
radation product 2-ethylhexanol, were also excluded 
initially [36]. After this step, the 349 VOCs detected 
primarily in the in vitro experiment were reduced to 21 
VOCs, and the 245 VOCs detected in the in vivo study 
reduced to 19 VOCs. Actually, the selected compounds 
were present at least 90% of all samples in at least one 
of the groups.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial 
least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were 
adopted to visually differentiate between groups 
using Simca-P software (Umetrics, Sweden). The 
deduced plots (PCA and PLS-DA) were based on 
the proximities between the samples of the enrolled 
groups. Due to the relatively small number of 
detected VOCs, a nonparametric statistical analysis 
was employed for each variable (detected VOC) 
comparison between groups. The Mann–Whitney 
U-test was used in the in vitro experiment, while the 
Kruskal–Wallis H-test followed by the Nemenyi test 
were applied for inter-group comparison in the in 
vivo study.
The in vivo target VOC (i.e. possibly A. bauman-
nii VAP-derived) was defined as the value in which 
significant differences were all achieved when com-
paring inter-group (infection group versus control 
group, infection group versus colonization group, and 
colonization group versus control group). The whole 
target compounds were also adopted to compare the 
bacterium group (i.e. infection group and colonization 
group combined) with the control group, to assess the 
presence or absence of A. baumannii.
Distinction capabilities of detected metabolites 
were evaluated by receiver operating characteris-
tic (ROC) curves, from which the AUC, sensitivity 
and specificity could be obtained. The differential 
accuracy was characterized as follows: AUC values 
between 0.5 and 0.7 indicated low accuracy, values 
between 0.7 and 0.9 indicated moderate accuracy, and 
values greater than 0.9 indicated high accuracy [37]. 
Optimum sensitivity and specificity were achieved, 
when maximum (sensitivity  −  (1  −  specificity)) was 
reached.

patients. A T-piece was connected to respiratory tube for exhaled breath collection (①). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. The 
samples were preconcentrated by adsorption on the stainless Tenax® TA steel-tube, which was placed in an airtight stainless cylinder 
with a temperature (T) controller. The adsorption process was implemented with the cylinder thermostat at 40 °C, and the flow 
controller at a rate of 200 ml min−1 while a vacuum pump was working for 20 min.

table 4. There were statistically significant differences 
in the levels of liver and renal function, systemic 
inflammatory intensity and respiratory support, when 
comparing those from A. baumannii VAP patients 
to corresponding ones from ventilated patients of 
 
A. baumannii respiratory tract colonization, or to 
ones from ventilated patients without pneumonia or 
 
A. baumannii colonization.
The individual value of each related parameter, 
the bacterial quantity related to sources of LRT species 
(ETA, BAL and PSB), disease diagnosis and antibiotic 
usage during breath sampling, and ever isolated micro-
organisms pertaining to individuals before or after the 
time point of breath sampling (⩾3 d) are presented 
in detail in the supplementary data (stacks.iop.org/
JBR/10/027102/mmedia).
3.4. Breath profile from A. baumannii VAP
The expiratory VOCs profile from A. baumannii VAP 
patients is presented in detail in table 5. There were 
19 compounds of interest included in the following 
analysis. Of these, eight target ones were considered 
to be possibly derived from A. baumannii VAP after 
comparing inter-groups.
3.5. Profile differentiation in vivo
The exhaled breath profiles consisting of the above 
selected 19 VOCs could be fairly discriminated 
among A. baumannii VAP patients, ventilated patients 
with A. baumannii colonization in the respiratory

tract, and ventilated patients without pneumonia or 
 
A. baumannii colonization, by using the PLS-DA 
method (figure 3).
Based on ROC analysis, eight target compounds 
could be adopted to efficiently distinguish ventilated 
patients with the presence of A. baumannii in the res-
piratory tract from those without, though the former 
group exhibited heterogeneity (i.e. patients with A. 
baumannii infection and colonization). Furthermore, 
the A. baumannii VAP patients could be differentiated 
from ventilated patients with A. baumannii coloniza-
tion in the respiratory tract due to ROC analysis for 
these eight breath compounds. A moderate accuracy 
was reached for both (AUC  =  0.89 and 0.88, respec-
tively). The ROC curves are displayed in figure 4. The 
relative abundances of the eight target VOCs in infec-
tion, colonization and control groups are presented in 
the supplementary data.
4. Discussion
This prospective, controlled and non-blinded clinical 
pilot study provides a proof of concept that the 
appearance and concentration profile of A. baumannii-
derived metabolites might be correlated with the 
pathogen presence and its ecological niche (i.e. 
the infection and colonization states) in ventilated 
patients. The direct detection of breath VOCs could be 
potentially employed as a novel, noninvasive and rapid 
means to identify A. baumannii VAP patients, especially 
in the precise targeting of antibiotic treatment and the 
reduction of invasive diagnostic manipulations.
It is still under study for the precise diagnosis of VAP 
and accurate prescription of antibiotics. Serum PCT 
has recently been regarded as an important marker in 
the diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis, including 
LRT infection. It can be used to assist clinicians in initi-
ating or discontinuing antibiotic therapy [38, 39]. How-
ever, the test results should be interpreted carefully, and 
the clinical value requires further validation [40, 41]. In 
fact, the biomarker has a relatively low sensitivity in the 
diagnosis of pneumonia. Other important biomarkers 
are extensively used for bacterial infection screening, 
such as WBC and CRP, and also have a limited value for 
specificity. Thus, it is worth searching alternative breath 
markers taken noninvasively from A. baumannii VAP in 
ICU patients.
Quantitative cultures from LRT specimens, such 
as ETA, BAL and PSB samples, could be adopted for 
the rational use of antibiotics. A diagnostic threshold 
(ETA  ⩾  105 cfu ml−1, BAL  ⩾  104 cfu ml−1, PSB  ⩾  103 
cfu ml−1, respectively) was recommended by ATS/IDSA 
in the decision to continue or discontinue antibiotics 
[28]. However, its application is restricted because it is 
an invasive procedure with imperfect sensitivity and 
specificity [42]. Moreover, the culture results are not 
immediately available. The time-consuming microbio-
logical culture of LRT specimens often presents false 
negative results, particularly already with antibiotic 
therapy. Herein, we propose this novel noninvasive 
approach for the early detection of LRT A. baumannii 
presence by monitoring breath volatile metabolites of 
ventilated patients.
Breath analysis using e-nose and GC-MS techniques 
have been previously studied in ICU VAP patients. Ini-
tially, the e-nose method was applied in breath-print 
research for VAP patients [43–45]. The diagnostic 
accuracy of exhaled breath profiling in discriminat-
ing between VAP (+) and VAP (−) patients was fairly 
well, when compared to that from chest computed 
Figure 2. The scatter plot of PCA. PCA was applied to visually differentiate the headspace profiles between from A. baumannii 
cultivation in vitro and the negative control (only medium). The profiles consisted of 21 detected VOCs. The samples close to each 
other exhibited a similar property, while objects that were located far away from each other indicated different characteristics.

tomography scanning [43] or CPIS [44], and even bet-
ter when the breath analysis was combined with CPIS 
[45]. However, the e-nose cannot precisely identify 
the VOCs underlying pulmonary infection. Lately, the 
GC-MS technique has been widely accepted as the gold 
standard for VOC separation and quantification. Using 
the GC-MS method, some recently published studies 
involving exhaled VOCs analysis on ICU VAP patients 
discovered that the breath profile could accurately 
distinguish between VAP(+) and VAP(−) patients 
[22–24]. Pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, Candida 
albicans, K. pneumonia and Enterobacter aerogenes were 
discovered on VAP patients in one study [22], while in 
another study, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, K. pneu-
monia, Haemophilus influenzae and A. baumannii were 
the most commonly identified as invasive pathogens for 
pneumonia [23]. However, the heterogeneity in path-
ogen population and the limited number of subjects 
per pathogen has hampered the determination of the 
specific strain-derived VOCs in vivo. Most individual 
compounds in these studies cannot correspond to those 
discovered in our pilot study; this lack in overlap might 
be explained by the underlying diverse pathogens. Tet-
radecane was reported in a newly published study [23] 
containing three VAP patients with A. baumannii infec-
tion, which was also identified in our study. This alkane 
probably endows A. baumannii with its metabolic char-
acteristics.

decanal, 1,3-naphthalenediol, longifolene, tetradecane, 
iminodibenzyl and 3-methyl-indene) were presumed 
to be derived from A. baumannii. While the breath-
print in vivo consisting of eight compounds of inter-
est (1-undecene, nonanal, decanal, 2,6,10-trimethyl-
dodecane, 5-methyl-5-propyl-nonane, longifolene, 
tetradecane and 2-butyl-1-octanol) was considered to 
be derived possibly from A. baumannii VAP. Of these, 
only four substances were found to be the same. The dif-
ferent profiles indicate that the headspace volatiles from 
in vitro experiments only provided somewhat useful 
clues for the in vivo screening target breath-prints. The 
direct transfer of biomarkers from in vitro conditions 
to in vivo is not feasible. One recently published study 
demonstrated that only 25–34% of peaks were shared 
between the in vitro and in vivo fingerprints from the 
same bacterial strains [46]. The distinct metabolic 
niche and host response should be taken into account.
The dynamic progression from colonization to 
pneumonia depends on host defenses and pathogen 
invasion, and vice versa. In order to avoid the overuse 
of antibiotics and subsequent bacterial resistance, it 
is of great clinical importance to distinguish between 
bacterial colonization and infection. However, the 
available approaches are imperfect. Clinical symptoms 
and signs, combined with the bacterial culture of LRT 
secretions, have a useful but limited value. The detec-
tion of intracellular organisms (i.e. leukocyte phagocy-
tosis) in respiratory specimens to distinguish infection 
from colonization is under consideration. Currently, 
the detection of breath VOC profile has emerged as a 
promising tool due to its noninvasiveness and rapidness 
features. Metabolites derived from pathogenic organ-
isms or the host could be analyzed by highly sensitive 
technology, such as mass spectrometry. This technique 
can potentially be adopted to diagnose and monitor 
critical illness usefully. This preliminary study demon-
strates that the breath VOC profile could be related to 
the different ecological conditions of LRT A. bauman-
nii infection and its colonization within mechanically 
ventilated patients, with a relatively high sensitivity and 
specificity (both reaching 85.0%). The distinction capa-
bility of breath-print detection for LRT A. baumannii 
infection from its colonization may be more powerful 
when combined with the aforementioned means avail-
able in clinical practice, though further affirmation is 
required.
The variable abundance of breath-prints is sup-
posed to be associated with the corresponding inten-
sity of bacterial metabolism, in addition to the differ-
ent inflammatory responses in the host to the bacterial 
invasion [22, 31, 47]. However, we did not conduct

a Certain breath compounds detected from the infection group (A. baumannii VAP patients) were considered to be possible  
A. baumannii VAP derivation, when the compound’s level increased by comparing which from the infection group with the 
corresponding one from the colonization group (ventilated patients with A. baumannii LRT colonization), and with that from the 
control group (ventilated patients without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization), and by comparing which from the colonization 
group with that from the control group. That meant statistically significant differences were all achieved when comparing inter-groups 
(infection group versus control group, colonization group versus control group and infection group versus colonization group) using 
the Kruskal–Wallis H-test followed by the Nemenyi test. If not, the detected compounds were regarded as other origin, including 
respirator, tubes (e.g. respiratory tubes, tracheal tube, connecting tube and extension tube), and host.

the correlation analysis between LRT bacterial load 
and the level of breath VOCs, because of the diverse 
sources of LRT species and relatively limited number 
of corresponding subjects. The metabolic and func-
tional mechanisms of the originated VOCs require 
further research. The different profiles and corresp-
onding VOCs levels under different parasitic states 
(infection versus colonization) in our present study 
were probably associated with the intensity of host 
immunological responses, such as the changes in the 
concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 
(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and regulated 
upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted 
(RANTES) [48, 49].
The blood-borne VOCs derived from organs 
other than the lung can also be detected in exhaled 
breath. As reported, acetone is produced in diabe-
tes mellitus, methane and hydrogen from intestinal 
bacteria activity, sulfur-containing compounds (i.e. 
dimethylsulfide, methyl mercaptan, ethyl mercap-
tan) in liver impairment, and nitrogen-containing 
Figure 3. The scatter plot of PLS-DA. The PLS-DA was adopted for visual separation among groups, which included the infection 
group of A. baumannii VAP patients, the colonization group of A. baumannii respiratory tract colonization of ventilated patients, 
and the control group of ventilated patients without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization. The breath profiles consisted of 19 
detected VOCs. The plot was based on the proximities among samples.
Figure 4. ROC curves. The distinction capability of eight selected VOCs (target ones), which were derived possibly from  
A. baumannii VAP, were evaluated by ROC curves. The AUC was 0.89, after comparison between the bacterium group (that from  
the infection group and the colonization group combined, i.e. ventilated patients with A. baumannii detected in the respiratory 
tract) and the control group (ventilated patients without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization). The optimum sensitivity  
and specificity were 88.3% and 83.3%, provided that maximum (sensitivity  −  (1  −  specificity)) was achieved. Meanwhile,  
the AUC reached 0.88 by comparison between the infection group (patients with A. baumannii VAP) and the control group.  
The corresponding optimum sensitivity and specificity both reached 85.0%.

compounds (i.e. ammonia, dimethylamine, tri-
methylamine) in kidney impairment [50, 51]. Some 
host-derived volatile metabolites in the breath have 
also been reported after pathogen infection due to 
non-specific lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress 
[16, 34]. Certain target compounds in vivo might be 
influenced by unmatched liver/renal functions or 
systemic inflammatory reactions due to infection. As 
discussed by Professors Haick and Cohen-Kaminsky, 
breath-prints from lung infection are a balanced mix-
ture of pathogen-derived VOCs, host-derived VOCs, 
host-derived VOCs in response to pathogens (e.g. 
immune response), host-derived VOCs in response 
to pathogen volatiles and pathogen-derived VOCs in 
response to host VOCs [52]. Certain volatiles derived 
from microorganisms are considered to possess com-
munication and defense functions [38]. Overall, the 
specific biosynthetic pathways of the detected sub-
stances need to be further explored. Whether these 
VOCs are end products in the metabolic cycle or only 
regarded as precursors to secondary metabolites and 
the role in the pathophysiological process, all require 
elucidation in the future.
Mixed expiratory gas was sampled in our present 
study. The alveolar fraction in exhaled breath is poten-
tially ideal for exploring pathogen-derived compounds 
in vivo, as the dilution effect of dead-space gas from the 
respiratory tract and endotracheal tube could be mini-
mized. It is impossible to absolutely avoid the dilution 
effect while alveolar samples are taken, even using a CO2 
capnograph monitor. The breath collection devices in 
ventilated patients need to be optimized for simplicity 
and ease of use in gas sampling, such as employing a 
CO2-triggered valve [15, 34]. Some unknown quantity 
of VOCs may be lost or decreased due to their conden-
sation and absorption in condensed water on the inner 
walls of the tubing. The collecting facility will be further 
improved, as the transfer line is thermostated in addi-
tion to the cylinder.
We did not simultaneously detect inspiratory gas 
for background correction because the emphasis in 
the present study was placed on comparing breath 
profiles from ventilated patients with the presence of 
 
A. baumannii in the respiratory tract with those with-
out, and those with A. baumannii infection to those 
with colonization, not the absolute concentration of the 
detected compounds. Bias in the same direction could 
be offset by compariso 
ns so that it would not interfere 
with the outcome of analyses. A simple 1D subtraction 
method is not a favorable strategy without knowledge 
of the concentration of the target compound in blood, 
its pulmonary adsorption and exhalation ratio, and the 
lung ventilation/perfusion rate [34, 53].
Our finding of sesquiterpene longifolene in the 
breath VOCs is interesting; it has been previously dis-
covered in pine resin and Nigella sativa oil [54]. Ter-
penoids are biosynthesized through the mevalonate 
pathway or the newly discovered deoxyxylulose 
phosphate pathway. Multiple bacteria are reported to 
 
produce many species-related volatiles, including 
terpenoids released by cyanobacteria, actinomycetes 
(e.g. Streptomyces) and myxobacteria, which have been 
reviewed thoroughly by Schulz and Dickschat [20]. 
Some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have also 
been detected in the breath of patients with invasive 
aspergillosis and sputum headspace for the presence of 
P. aeruginosa [55, 56]. The sesquiterpenoid isolongi-
folene was found to be released by Marine Artic bacte-
ria [36]. Longifolene was detected in the present in vitro 
and in vivo studies, which endowed A. baumannii with 
its metabolic characteristics. Further studies involving 
its actual metabolic pathway and its potential function 
need to be carried out.
Our present pilot study has some limitations. The 
first is the relatively small number of subjects. Larger 
studies on A. baumannii VAP should be further devel-
oped. However, the research period could be extended, 
particularly with a progressively strict control of 
nosocomial infection, or a multicenter cohort could 
be utilized for clinical applications. The second is the 
diagnostic accuracy of VAP. Several patients might 
be misdiagnosed without histological examination, 
known as the gold standard, which could possibly have 
influenced the findings of the current study. Overall, 
biopsy or autopsy has not been considered as a rou-
tine method for clinical VAP diagnosis. The third 
refers to the unparalleled baseline regarding liver/
renal functions and the extent of the inflammatory 
reaction between groups. As discussed above, further 
work should be performed for the biosynthetic and 
metabolic pathways of these compounds. The fourth 
indicates that the detected values of the compounds 
were not converted to the absolute quantities, though 
this method has been employed in previous studies 
[55, 57]. The integrated area of each compound’s GC 
peak was calculated as the relative abundance of the 
metabolites in breath samples. Overall, we have placed 
emphasis on the comparison between the variable bac-
terial states.
5. Conclusion
It is not feasible to simply transfer the metabolic 
biomarkers from the in vitro condition to in vivo due to 
their distinct volatile profiles. This pilot study mainly 
provides a proof of concept that the direct detection 
of exhaled A. baumannii-derived VOCs might be 
adopted for an early alert of the LRT bacterial presence 
in ventilated ICU patients and even different parasitic 
states (i.e. infection and colonization) of A. baumannii, 
though further refinement and validation are required 
before clinical use.
