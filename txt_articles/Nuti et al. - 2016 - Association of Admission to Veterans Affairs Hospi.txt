IMPORTANCE Little contemporary information is available about comparative performance
between Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA hospitals, particularly related to mortality and
readmission rates, 2 important outcomes of care.
OBJECTIVE To assess and compare mortality and readmission rates among men in VA and
non-VA hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis involving male Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older hospitalized between 2010 and 2013 in VA and non-
VA acute care hospitals for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), or pneumonia
using the Medicare Standard Analytic Files and Enrollment Database together with VA adminis-
trative claims data. To avoid confounding geographic effects with health care system effects, we
studied VA and non-VA hospitals within the same metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
EXPOSURES Hospitalization in a VA or non-VA hospital in MSAs that contained at least 1 VA
and non-VA hospital.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For each condition, 30-day risk-standardized mortality
rates and risk-standardized readmission rates for VA and non-VA hospitals. Mean aggregated
within-MSA differences in mortality and readmission rates were also assessed.
RESULTS We studied 104 VA and 1513 non-VA hospitals, with each condition-outcome
analysis cohort for VA and non-VA hospitals containing at least 7900 patients (men; �65
years), in 92 MSAs. Mortality rates were lower in VA hospitals than non-VA hospitals for AMI
(13.5% vs 13.7%, P = .02; −0.2 percentage-point difference) and HF (11.4% vs 11.9%, P = .008;
−0.5 percentage-point difference), but higher for pneumonia (12.6% vs 12.2%, P = .045; 0.4
percentage-point difference). In contrast, readmission rates were higher in VA hospitals for all
3 conditions (AMI, 17.8% vs 17.2%, 0.6 percentage-point difference; HF, 24.7% vs 23.5%, 1.2
percentage-point difference; pneumonia, 19.4% vs 18.7%, 0.7 percentage-point difference,
all P < .001). In within-MSA comparisons, VA hospitals had lower mortality rates for AMI
(percentage-point difference, −0.22; 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.04) and HF (−0.63; 95% CI, −0.95
to −0.31), and mortality rates for pneumonia were not significantly different (−0.03; 95% CI,
−0.46 to 0.40); however, VA hospitals had higher readmission rates for AMI (0.62; 95% CI,
0.48 to 0.75), HF (0.97; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.34), or pneumonia (0.66; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.91).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older men with AMI, HF, or pneumonia,
hospitalization at VA hospitals, compared with hospitalization at non-VA hospitals, was
associated with lower 30-day risk-standardized all-cause mortality rates for AMI and HF, and
higher 30-day risk-standardized all-cause readmission rates for all 3 conditions, both
nationally and within similar geographic areas, although absolute differences between these
outcomes at VA and non-VA hospitals were small.

T
he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are col-
laborating in calculating and reporting hospital perfor-
mance. The alignment of reporting systems provides an
opportunity to compare performance of VA and non-VA hos-
pitals directly with respect to risk-adjusted outcomes for key
conditions, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart
failure (HF), or pneumonia. Prior studies, which are a decade
or more old or are not nationally representative, and oc-
curred before validated hospital-level outcome measures ex-
isted,foundthatpatientswhoreceivedcareatVAhospitalshad
either similar or lower mortality rates than patients who re-
ceived care at non-VA hospitals1-4; with respect to readmis-
sion rates, a study in New York found that elderly patients had
higher rates of 30-day readmission in VA hospitals than in
non-VA hospitals.5 Contemporary knowledge about hospital-
level outcomes would help to better understand quality of care
for the approximately 9 million veterans enrolled in the na-
tion’
s largest integrated health care system compared with
those in Medicare.6
Accordingly, we assessed and compared 30-day risk-
standardized all-cause mortality rates and 30-day risk-
standardized all-cause readmission rates in VA hospitals and
non-VA hospitals for patients hospitalized with AMI, HF, or
pneumonia. We applied the measure method that is used to
calculate publicly reported mortality and readmission rates.
To avoid confounding geographic effects with health care sys-
tem effects, we studied VA and non-VA hospitals within the
same metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
Methods
Study Population
WeusedacombineddatasetoftheCMSStandardAnalyticFiles
andEnrollmentDatabasetogetherwithVAadministrativeclaims
data to identify Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65
years or older hospitalized from July 1, 2010, through June 30,
2013, with a principal discharge diagnosis of AMI, HF, or pneu-
monia in VA or non-VA acute care hospitals in the United States
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification codes identical to those used in the pub-
licly reported mortality and readmission measures.7-12 For VA
beneficiaries, we studied only those enrolled in the Medicare
fee-for-service program. These databases include enrollment
status, admissions, patient demographic information, inpa-
tient and outpatient diagnosis codes, mortality, and readmis-
sions. They also include unique patient identifiers that enable
theidentificationofpatientsacrossVAandnon-VAsystems.We
excluded beneficiaries for whom a complete claims history for
the 12-month period preceding the claim was unavailable be-
cause of the use of data in the year before hospitalization in risk
adjustment. We included patients admitted to hospitals in ur-
ban MSAs that contained at least 1 VA and non-VA hospital to
reduce confounding geographic effects from health system ef-
fects (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for VA hospitals included
in the study).13,14 This also helps minimize potential confound-
ingfromtheinclusionofnonurbanhospitals,giventhatthechal-
lenges faced by rural and urban hospitals differ.15,16 Because
more than 90% of patients in VA hospitals are male,17 we
restricted our analyses to men.
The Yale University Human Investigation Committee re-
viewed the study and waived the requirement for informed
consent.
Risk-Standardized Mortality and Readmission Rates
To calculate 30-day risk-standardized all-cause mortality rates
and 30-day risk-standardized all-cause readmission rates for
each condition, we used the specifications used in the mea-
sures developed for CMS and endorsed by the National Qual-
ity Forum.7-11 Briefly, the technique of risk-adjustment em-
ploys a hierarchical logistic regression model to create a
hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized mortality or readmis-
sion rate. This modeling appropriately accounts for the struc-
ture of the data (patients clustered within hospitals) and the
underlying risk due to patients’age and comorbidities when
estimating hospital mortality or readmission rates. This ap-
proach simultaneously models 2 levels (patient and hospital)
to account for the variance in patient outcomes within and be-
tween hospitals. At the patient level, the model uses the log-
odds of mortality or readmission within 30 days of admission
or discharge as the dependent variable and age and selected
clinical covariates as the independent variables (or predic-
tors). The second level models the hospital-specific inter-
cepts as arising from a normal distribution. The hospital-
specific intercept, or hospital-specific effect, represents the
hospital contribution to the risk of mortality or readmission
after accounting for patient risk and can be inferred as a mea-
sure of quality. The hospital-specific intercepts are given a dis-
tribution to account for the clustering (nonindependence) of
patients within the same hospital.
We defined 30-day mortality as death from any cause
within 30 days of the admission date for an index hospitaliza-
tion for AMI, HF, or pneumonia. Readmission was defined as
1 or more rehospitalization for any unplanned cause to any
acute care hospital within 30 days of the discharge date for an
index hospitalization for AMI, HF, or pneumonia among pa-
tients surviving the index hospitalization. Planned readmis-
sions were identified and excluded using planned readmis-
sion algorithms (version 2.1).7-11,18 We used the top 25 diagnosis
and procedure codes for risk adjustment across all outcomes
and conditions in both VA and non-VA hospitals.
For the mortality cohort for each condition, we randomly
selected 1 admission per year for patients with multiple admis-
sions for the same diagnosis during the study period.13 For in-
dividuals admitted to both a VA and non-VA hospital (<2.1% of
patients for each condition-outcome analysis in our cohort;
Table 1), we randomly selected 1 admission from all admis-
sions regardless of location hospitalized. For transfers be-
tween hospitals, relevant hospitalizations were linked into a
single episode of care, with mortality attributed to the hospital
to which the patient was first admitted; transfers between VA
and non-VA hospitals were treated similarly to transfers
between VA and VA or between non-VA and non-VA hospitals.
For the readmission cohort for each condition, we in-
cluded all admissions for patients with multiple admissions

for the same diagnosis during any study year. Hospitaliza-
tions within 30 days of discharge from an index hospitaliza-
tion were considered readmissions and not additional index
hospitalizations.Readmissiontoanothersystem(VAtonon-VA
or non-VA to VA) was counted as a readmission attributed to
the index hospital. Transfers were linked into a single epi-
sode of care, with readmissions attributed to the hospital that
discharged the patient to a nonacute setting; transfers be-
tween VA and non-VA hospitals were treated as described
above. We also calculated the number of patients who died af-
ter discharge, but before 30-day readmission, within each
health care system for each condition.
Hospital Characteristics
Hospital characteristics were derived from the American Hos-
pital Association Annual Survey in the corresponding year,
other than Medicare condition-specific 3-year volumes, which
were derived from the Standard Analytic Files and Enroll-
ment Database.19 These variables include total staffed beds,
ownership type, region, teaching status, Joint Commission ac-
creditation, and hospital capacity to provide coronary artery
bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention.
Metropolitan statistical area population size data, from April
1, 2010, to July 1, 2012, were obtained from the US Census
Bureau.20
Patient Characteristics
Demographic information included age and race (white, black,
other); there are no measures of socioeconomic status avail-
able in these data. Race (white, black, other) for these catego-
ries is derived from the Social Security Administration21 and
was assessed as a descriptive characteristic of the popula-
tionsstudied.Wedefinedcomorbiditiesaccordingtothespeci-
fications used by CMS to profile hospitals, using principal and
secondary diagnosis codes from hospitalizations in the 12
months before the index hospitalization (See eTable 2 in the
Supplement for medical history characteristics).7-11
Statistical Analysis
We compared VA and non-VA hospitals for differences in both
patient factors (demographic and clinical characteristics) and
hospital factors. For the 3 conditions, within the full 3-year
pooled sample, we estimated mortality and readmission rates
for each VA and non-VA hospital using hierarchical logistic re-
gression models. Each model included age and selected clini-
calcovariates(eTable2intheSupplement)aswellasahospital-
specific random effects intercept. Risk-standardized mortality
and readmission rates are calculated as the ratio of the num-
ber of predicted outcomes to the number of expected out-
comes (death or readmission), multiplied by the unadjusted
rate of the given outcome within our overall sample. We cal-

culated aggregate mortality and readmission for each condi-
tion-outcome group for VA and non-VA hospitals by weight-
ing hospital-specific mortality or readmission rate estimates
by a hospital’
s condition-specific volume.
In addition, for each condition, we calculated the mean-
aggregatedMSA-specificmortalityandreadmissionratesstrati-
fied by VA hospital status to reduce confounding geographic
effects from health system effects and minimize potential con-
founding from the inclusion of nonurban hospitals, and de-
termined the average within-MSA difference between VA and
non-VA hospitals. As above, within MSAs, we weighted hos-
pital-specificmortalityorreadmissionratesbytheircondition-
specific volume. After aggregating outcome rates for the VA
hospitals and non-VA hospitals within an MSA, we calculated
the difference between the rates of VA and non-VA hospitals
in each MSA, and then calculated the mean and 95% confi-
denceintervalofthedifferencesamongallMSAsinoursample.
Differences were presented as the rate in VA hospitals minus
the rate in non-VA hospitals; values of less than 0 indicate a
lower mortality or readmission rate for VA hospitals.
Analyses were performed separately for AMI, HF, and
pneumonia. For all 3 conditions, we calculated the mean (95%
CI) mortality or readmission rate grouped by VA and non-VA
hospitals. The corresponding P values were obtained using
t tests. In the above calculations, weights were added by the
condition-specific number of hospitalizations to account for
the variability in hospital sample sizes. We considered P val-
ues <.05 (2-sided) to be statistically significant. Analyses were
conducted using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).

pitals (104 VA hospitals with 22 882 patients and 1500 non-VA
hospitals with 215 312 patients) for mortality and 1604 hospi-

monia, 1609 hospitals (104 VA hospitals with 21 092 patients
and 1505 non-VA hospitals with 190 798 patients) for mortal-

and 1506 non-VA hospitals with 205 060 patients) for read-

set (eTable 1).
Patient Characteristics
For the mortality and readmission analyses for all 3 condi-
tions, patients who received care in VA hospitals were
younger and generally less likely to be white than those who
received care in non-VA hospitals (Table 1). Among patients
hospitalized for AMI, VA patients were more likely to have a
history of HF or diabetes. Among patients hospitalized for
HF, VA patients were also more likely to have a history of HF
or diabetes, but less likely to have a documented history of
coronary atherosclerosis or valvular heart disease. Among
patients hospitalized for pneumonia, VA patients were more
likely to have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and less likely to have a history of pneumonia,
protein-calorie malnutrition, or fibrosis of the lung or other
chronic lung disorders.
Hospital Characteristics
Veterans Affairs hospitals were more likely to be teaching hos-
pitals and were larger, with a greater number of hospital beds
(Table 2). For HF and pneumonia hospitalizations, but not for
AMI, a greater proportion of VA hospitals had 3-year condition-
specific volumes of more than 150 patients.
30-Day Mortality Rates
Before risk-adjustment, VA hospitals had lower mortality rates
thannon-VAhospitalsacrossall3conditions(Table3).Afterrisk-
adjustment,VAhospitalshadlowermortalityratesthannon-VA
hospitals for AMI (13.52%; 95% CI, 13.38% to 13.66% vs 13.69%;
95% CI, 13.64% to 13.74%; −0.17 percentage-point difference)
and HF (11.43%; 95% CI, 11.11% to 11.75% vs 11.87%; 95% CI,
11.80% to 11.93%; −0.44 percentage-point difference) (P < .03
for both; Table 3, Figure 1). However, for pneumonia, VA hos-
pitalshadhighermortalityratesthannon-VAhospitals(12.63%;
95% CI, 12.19% to 13.07% vs 12.17%; 95% CI, 12.08% to 12.26%,
P = .045;0.46percentage-pointdifference).Thedistributionof
mortality rate performance was not markedly different be-
tween VA and non-VA hospitals for all 3 conditions (Figure 1;
eFigure, eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
Inwithin-MSAcomparisons,VAhospitalshadlowermean-
aggregated within-MSA mortality rates for AMI (−0.22 per-
centage points; 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.04; P = .02) and HF (−0.63
percentage points, 95% CI, −0.95 to −0.31; P < .001) than did
non-VA hosptials. However, in contrast with the overall com-
parison, VA hospitals had mean-aggregated within-MSA mor-
tality rates that were not significantly different for pneumo-
nia (−0.03 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.46 to 0.40; P = .90).
30-Day Readmission Rates
Before risk-adjustment, VA hospitals had higher readmission
rates than non-VA hospitals across all 3 conditions (Table 3). Af-
ter risk-adjustment, VA hospitals had higher readmission rates
thannon-VAhospitalsforall3conditions(Table3;Figure2).For
AMI, the readmission rates were 17.84% (95% CI, 17.71% to
17.96%)forVAhospitalsvs17.21%(95%CI,17.17%to17.25%)for
non-VA hospitals (0.63 percentage-point difference); for HF,
24.66% (95% CI, 24.31% to 25.02%) vs 23.46% (95% CI, 23.39%
to 23.53%) (1.2 percentage-point difference); and for pneumo-
nia, 19.44% (95% CI, 19.19% to 19.69%) vs 18.68% (95% CI,
18.63% to 18.73%) (0.76 percentage-point difference) (P < .001
for all). The distribution of readmission rate performance dif-
fered between VA and non-VA hospitals (Figure 2; eFigure,

0.48 to 0.75) for AMI, 0.97 percentage points (95% CI, 0.59 to
1.34) for HF, and 0.66 percentage points (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.91)
for pneumonia (P < .001 for all; Table 3).
Across conditions, among those who were initially hospi-
talized in VA hospitals, approximately 12% were readmitted to
non-VA hospitals; among those initially hospitalized in non-VA
hospitals, less than 1% were readmitted to VA hospitals
(Table 1).
Discussion
In this national study comparing CMS 30-day mortality and re-
admission measures for 3 major conditions, we found that VA
hospitals have lower mortality rates for AMI and HF com-
paredwithnon-VAhospitals.However,VAhospitalshadhigher
readmission rates for AMI, HF, and pneumonia than non-VA
hospitals. These differences persisted after accounting for geo-
graphic variation in hospital location by limiting compari-
sons of VA and non-VA hospitals to those within the same MSA.
In general, however, the magnitudes of differences were small
for both measures across all 3 conditions.
We were unable to find another national study using
CMS hospital mortality and readmission measures to com-
pare the quality of care between VA hospitals, which com-
prise the largest integrated health care system in the United
States, and non-VA hospitals. This study is also distinct
because it compares outcomes between VA and non-VA hos-
pitals within similar geographic areas. The finding that risk-
standardized mortality rates for cardiovascular conditions
were lower, albeit with small absolute differences, in VA hos-
pitals may reflect higher quality of care in VA hospitals as
represented by adherence to process measures.3,22-25 The
lower mortality rates also may be due to the quality
improvement efforts that can be implemented across the
VA’
s integrated delivery system. For example, upon evidence
of possible higher cardiovascular mortality in VA hospitals
compared with non-VA hospitals, in 2003 the VA undertook
a comprehensive cardiac care improvement initiative across
all its hospitals, after which AMI mortality declined.4 Similar
initiatives and programs, such as the VA Heart Failure Pro-
vider Network,26 may have helped lower mortality rates.
However, the lower mortality result for VA hospitals was not
consistent for pneumonia, with no difference in mortality
rates between VA and non-VA hospitals after accounting for
geographic location, and the differences in cardiovascular
condition mortality outcomes were modest. Another possi-
bility is that there are unmeasured case-mix differences,
which could have produced the small differences.
There are several possible reasons for the finding of higher
readmission rates in VA hospitals. First, VA hospitals may have
a higher propensity to admit. For example, a study that sought
to reduce readmissions in VA hospitals by increased access to
primary care resulted in an increase in readmissions in the in-
tervention group.27 Second, the distance VA patients need to
travel to the hospital may be greater than that for non-VA pa-
tients,whichhasbeenassociatedwithhigherreadmissionrates
among veterans28; however, greater distance could also pro-
duce lower readmission rates because patients may be less
likely to go to the hospital when they need care. Third, the CMS
Hospital Readmission Reduction Program introduced finan-
cial penalties for non-VA hospitals in 2012, and national pub-
lic reporting of, and incentives for reducing, readmissions in
non-VA hospitals may have contributed to lower readmission
rates for non-VA hospitals during our study period. Neverthe-
less, the VA has undertaken efforts to prevent readmissions in
recent years,29,30 and we are unable to assert whether or how
the combination of efforts in VA hospitals and public report-
ing for non-VA hospitals contributed to relatively lower read-
missionratesamongnon-VAhospitals.Theresultsofthisstudy
may be helpful to the VA system by highlighting the variation

duce unnecessary readmissions.
Of note, the range in performance among both VA and
non-VA hospitals for both outcomes was as little as approxi-
mately 3.5 percentage points, although in some cases it was
as much as approximately 13 percentage points. Some read-
ers may consider the difference modest and an indication of
little opportunity for improvement. However, it may also be
that, for some conditions, hospitals are aggregating around a
similar performance but have opportunities for marked im-
provement, as has been demonstrated with mortality over the
last 15 years and more recently by readmission.31,32 In any case,
this study sought to compare 2 health systems, and whether

fact that their current performance is separated by only a few

Although VA outcome data for these 3 key conditions are
currently available on the Hospital Compare website, this ini-
tial integration of measures is going to be followed by an ex-
pectation that a broader set of quality measures be reported
across both VA and non-VA hospitals as part of the Veterans
Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.33 Within this
context, our study has multiple implications. First, the avail-
ability of this information, with equal standards of reporting,
willallowfortheassessmentofcomparativequality,whichcan
inform targeted improvements in VA and non-VA hospitals
alike. It also affords a unique opportunity for the VA to part-
nerwithpublicandprivateentitiestotestandimplementstrat-
egies to improve care. The current study serves as an ex-
ample of national performance comparison for VA and non-VA
hospital care, which sets the stage for future performance and

and other benchmarking efforts could inform efforts to im-
prove quality in the VA, particularly our findings of variation
in performance, by identifying and learning from high-
performinghospitalsanddisseminatingbestpracticestolower-
performing hospitals to elevate the entire performance curve.
Finally, given the new Veterans Choice Program for the fund-
ing of private care for some veterans, VA policy makers should
recognize that there is also variation in quality among non-VA
hospitals and take steps to encourage veterans who choose to
use non-VA hospitals to use the highest quality ones to en-
sure optimal outcomes and high-value care.
Our study has several limitations. First, we only studied
elderly, male VA patients and Medicare patients, and are un-
abletoassertwhetherourfindingsaregeneralizabletoyounger
or female populations. Second, we studied administrative
claims data, which lack information about clinical disease se-
verity, but these are the same data used for the publicly re-
ported outcomes measures and, at the hospital level, studies
have shown that administrative data and clinical data per-
form similarly for both VA and non-VA hospitalizations.7-9,34
Third,whilepriorliteraturesuggeststhatVAandnon-VApopu-
lations are different, with VA populations generally having
worse health status but similar mortality rates,35-37 these re-
ports did not study older populations. Other studies suggest
that VA beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, who comprise our
cohort, have similar or better physical health status and bet-
ter mental health status than younger VA beneficiaries,38-40
which is in contrast with non-VA populations in which older
populations are less healthy. Fourth, we could not study all VA
hospitals in the United States because some were in rural areas
or were not within an urban MSA with another non-VA hospi-
tal; nevertheless, studying hospitals within the same urban
MSA allowed us to make more direct comparisons between VA
and non-VA hospitals by accounting for geographic differ-
ences. Fourth, there were hospitals for which hospital char-
acteristics were not available; however, these hospitals rep-
resented only approximately 4% of VA or non-VA hospitals in
our cohort, so it is unlikely that this would influence the re-
sults. Fifth, we only studied 3 common conditions among el-
derly patients, which may not be representative of care for all
patients in either VA or non-VA hospitals; however, these out-
come metrics are CMS core condition measures.
Conclusions
Among older men with AMI, HF, or pneumonia, hospitaliza-
tion at VA hospitals, compared with hospitalization at non-VA
hospitals, was associated with lower 30-day risk-standard-
ized all-cause mortality rates for AMI and HF, and higher 30-
day risk-standardized all-cause readmission rates for all 3 con-
ditions, both nationally and within similar geographic areas,
although absolute differences between these outcomes at VA
and non-VA hospitals were small.
