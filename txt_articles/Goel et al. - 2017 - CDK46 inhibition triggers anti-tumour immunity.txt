Abstract
Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are 
required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies1,2. Pharmacologic inhibitors of 
CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumors3,4. Their primary mechanism 
of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor 
suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumor cells5. Here, we use murine models of breast 
carcinoma and other solid tumors to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumor 
cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumor immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through 
transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for 
breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumor immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 
inhibitors activate tumor cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing 
intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III 
interferons and hence enhances tumor antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly 
suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 
inhibitors on both tumor cells and Tregs are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, 
DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T cell-mediated clearance of 
tumor cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our 
findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumor immunogenicity and provide rationale for 
new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer 
treatment.
We first assessed the impact of CDK4/6 inhibition in vivo using our recently described 
MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 transgenic mouse model of mammary carcinoma6. Cells derived 
from these tumors express RB and arrest in response to CDK4/6 inhibition6. In three 
independent experiments, the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib caused regression of bulky 
tumors, evidenced by a ~40% reduction in tumor volume at the 12-day end-point (Fig. 1a). 
As expected, abemaciclib reduced tumor cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
Expression analysis across a panel of 3,826 cancer-related genes from MMTV-rtTA/tetO-
HER2 tumors (Fig. 1b) showed that abemaciclib downregulated genes within Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) terms relating to cell cycle, 
mitosis, and E2F targets (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Strikingly, only two GO process terms 
were significantly enriched for genes upregulated by abemaciclib: “antigen processing and 
presentation of peptide antigen” and “antigen processing and presentation” (Fig. 1c). 
Specifically, genes encoding murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I 
molecules were upregulated in abemaciclib-treated tumors (H2d1, H2k1, and B2m), as were 
genes directing peptide cleavage (Erap1), peptide transporters (Tap1 and Tap2), and 
transporter-MHC interactions (Tapbp) (Fig. 1d). Moreover, abemaciclib treatment in vitro 
increased expression of homologous genes in human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-
MB-453, MCF7, and MDA-MB-361) (Fig. 1e; Extended Data Fig. 2a) and palbociclib, 
another CDK4/6 inhibitor, yielded similar results (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Importantly,

 treatment with either agent increased cell-surface expression of β2M and MHC class I 
proteins (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced increase in expression of 
antigen processing and presentation genes was also observed in a patient-derived breast 
cancer xenograft of a treatment-refractory breast cancer (PDX 14-07, previously described6) 
(Fig. 1f). Furthermore, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data7 revealed that 
breast cancers harboring cyclin D1 amplification (i.e., enhanced CDK4/6 activity) display 
significantly lower expression of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C than non-amplified tumors 
(Extended Data Fig. 2d).
To determine the functional consequences of increased antigen presentation gene expression, 
we treated ovalbumin (OVA) expressing murine cancer cell lines (MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3-
OVA and B16-OVA) with abemaciclib. Abemaciclib increased expression of MHC class I-
bound SIINFEKL, an 8 amino acid peptide derived from OVA (Extended Data Fig. 2e), 
confirming enhanced antigen processing and presentation. Co-culture of abemaciclib-
pretreated tumor cells with MHC class I-restricted OVA-specific CD8+ T cells (OT-I cells) 
significantly increased OT-I cell proliferation, IFN-gamma production, and TNF-alpha 
production (Fig. 1g; Extended Data Figs. 2f, g). CD8+ T cell proliferation was both antigen-
specific (P14 CD8+ T cells, which recognize an irrelevant antigen, did not increase their 
proliferation) and MHC class I-specific (MHC class I blocking antibody partially suppressed 
OT-I T cell proliferation) (Fig. 1g; Extended Data Fig. 2f).
In agreement with other reports2,6, abemaciclib did not directly induce breast cancer cell 
apoptosis; rather, it caused cell cycle arrest and induced cellular phenotypes consistent with 
senescence (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Cellular senescence has been associated with 
apoptosis resistance8; indeed, abemaciclib reduced tumor cell Poly ADP-ribose polymerase 
cleavage and suppressed the apoptotic response to staurosporine (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). 
Collectively, these results establish that CDK4/6 inhibitors induce breast cancer cell 
cytostasis without directly causing their apoptosis, and enhance their capacity to present 
antigen and stimulate cytotoxic T cells.
We next sought mechanistic insight for the increase in antigen presentation after CDK4/6 
inhibition. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of three human breast cancer cell lines and 
PDX 14-07 tumors revealed that abemaciclib upregulated expression of genes within GO 
terms related to interferon signaling and cellular defense response to virus (Fig. 2a, b; 
Extended Data Fig. 4a). Several interferon-sensitive transcription factors (e.g., STAT1, 
STAT2, IRF2, IRF6, IRF9, and NLRC5) were upregulated in all three cell lines, PDX 14-07 
tumors, and MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3 cells (Figs. 2c, d; Extended Data Figs. 4b, c). Similar 
trends were observed when abemaciclib was given in conjunction with anti-estrogen therapy 
- the current standard in luminal breast cancer treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4d). 
Expression of other interferon-sensitive genes (ISGs) - OAS1, OAS2, IFIT1, IFIT2, BST2, 
SP100, RSAD2 - was also enhanced in cell lines and PDX tumors, suggesting global 
upregulation of an interferon-driven transcriptional program (Extended Data Figs. 4e, f). 
Consistent with active interferon signaling, both phosphorylated and total STAT1 protein 
were increased after abemaciclib treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Furthermore, forced 
overexpression of the endogenous CDK4/6 inhibitor CDKN2A (encoding p16INK4a)

 increased expression of STAT1, B2M, and MHC class I genes (Extended Data Fig. 4h), 
suggesting that these are “on-target” effects.
Importantly, we made similar observations in MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor tissues after 
abemaciclib treatment. Enriched GSEA expression signatures included “allograft rejection”, 
“interferon alpha response”, and “interferon gamma response” (Fig. 2e). Specifically, 
abemaciclib also significantly increased tumor expression of interferon-responsive 
transcription factors in these tumors (Fig. 2f), as well as that of interferon-inducible T cell 
chemoattractants and other ISGs involved in lymphocyte adhesion and co-stimulation 
(Extended Data Figs. 4i, j). STAT1 protein levels were also higher within tumor cells of the 
abemaciclib-treated cohort (Fig. 2g). In keeping with their roles in regulating antigen 
presentation via MHC class I, in vivo expression of transcription factors Stat1 and Nlrc5 was 
tightly correlated with that of H2d1, H2k1, Tap1, Tap2, and Tapbp in MMTV-rtTA/tetO-
HER2 tumors (Extended Data Fig. 4k). Thus, CDK4/6 inhibition directly induces ISG 
expression in tumor cells, likely explaining their enhanced capacity for antigen presentation.
We next interrogated genome-wide expression data from the NeoPalAna trial, in which 
patients with primary ER-positive breast cancer underwent tumor biopsies before 
commencing palbociclib and serially after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 
5a)9. As expected, palbociclib treatment significantly downregulated genes within the “E2F 
target” and other cell cycle-related signatures (Extended Data Fig. 5b). When we compared 
upregulated genes from biopsies taken before initiation of palbociclib to those after 12 
weeks of treatment, 3 of the top 5 ranked “Hallmarks” GSEA signatures were “allograft 
rejection”, “inflammatory response” and “interferon gamma response” (Fig. 2h) and these 
gene sets were already significantly upregulated after 2 weeks of palbociclib treatment 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c). These signatures are the same as those we observed to be 
upregulated in the tumors from abemaciclib-treated MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mice (Fig. 2e), 
and demonstrate the clinical relevance of our findings.
We speculated that heightened ISG expression after CDK4/6 inhibition might be caused by 
enhanced tumor cell interferon production. The Janus Kinases (JAKs) mediate intracellular 
signaling after ligand-dependent activation of interferon receptor, and the JAK inhibitor 
ruxolitinib completely mitigated abemaciclib-induced increases in tumor cell p-STAT1 and 
total STAT1 (Extended Data Fig. 6a), suggesting that CDK4/6 inhibition stimulates tumor 
cell interferon production. Notably, ELISA did not detect interferons alpha, beta, or gamma 
in conditioned medium of abemaciclib-treated tumor cells (not shown), and neutralizing 
antibodies against interferons alpha and gamma did not mitigate interferon signaling 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). However, gene expression and protein secretion of type III 
interferons (IL-29, IL-28a, and IL-28b) were significantly increased in abemaciclib-treated 
tumor cells (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Figs. 6e, f). Neutralizing antibodies to type III 
interferons reversed abemaciclib-induced increases in tumor cell p-STAT1 and total STAT1 
(Fig. 3b). Collectively, these data suggest that CDK4/6 inhibition increases tumor cell 
production of type III interferons to drive ISG expression in an autocrine fashion.
Increased tumor cell interferon signaling via type III interferon production has previously 
been shown to occur in response to DNA demethylation caused by agents such as 5-

 azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)10. In that context, DNMT 
inhibition reduces methylation of endogenous retroviral genes (ERVs), triggering “viral 
mimicry” and a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) response, in turn stimulating type III 
interferon production to activate ISGs10. Notably, the mammalian DNA methyltransferase 
DNMT1 is a bona fide E2F target gene, and CDK4/6 enzyme activity can enhance DNMT1 
gene expression in an RB-E2F dependent fashion11. Strikingly, tumor cell levels of DNMT1 
(but not DNMT3A) mRNA and protein fell markedly and rapidly in abemaciclib-treated cell 
lines (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Figs. 7a–c). Similarly, abemaciclib reduced DNMT1 mRNA 
levels in vivo in both PDX 14-07 and MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors (Fig. 3d; Extended 
Data Fig. 7d). These were on-target effects, as abemaciclib did not reduce DNMT1 levels in 
tumor cells expressing shRNA targeting RB1 (Extended Data Fig. 7e). The abemaciclib-
related increases in IFNL2, STAT1, and HLA-B expression were also mitigated in shRNA-
RB1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7e), supporting the concept that the RB-E2F-DNMT1 axis 
mediates type III interferon production and its downstream consequences.
Consistent with previous studies10,12, suppression of DNMT1 was associated with reduced 
DNA methylation at ERV sequences; combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) 
showed that abemaciclib decreased tumor cell DNA methylation at the 5′-LTR of ERV3-1 
(Extended Data Fig. 7f). Accordingly, expression of certain ERVs was increased in vitro and 
in vivo (Fig. 3e, f; Extended Data Fig. 7g), accompanied by significantly higher levels of 
dsRNA within tumor cells (Fig. 3g; Extended Data Fig. 7h). In turn, expression of the 
dsRNA pattern recognition receptors, RIG-1 (DDX58), LGP2 (DHX58), and MDA5 
(IFIH1), was significantly increased in cell lines and PDX tumors (Extended Data Fig. 7i, j). 
In further support of abemaciclib-mediated DNMT1 suppression as the trigger for this 
cascade of events, overexpression of DNMT1 in tumor cells attenuated the abemaciclib-
induced increase in expression of dsRNA response genes, type III interferon, and ISGs (Fig. 
3h; Extended Data Fig. 7k). Independent of altered ERV expression, CDK4/6 inhibitors 
could theoretically increase tumor cell immunogenicity by inducing a “senescence 
associated secretory phenotype” (SASP)13. Although abemaciclib increased tumor cell beta-
galactosidase activity (Extended Data Fig. 3b, 8a), expression of key SASP factors was not 
increased (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, doxorubicin 
increased tumor cell expression of SASP genes (Extended Data Fig. 8d), consistent with the 
notion that the SASP is more pertinent to DNA damage response-associated senescence13 
and does not explain tumor immunogenicity after CDK4/6 inhibition.
Our observation that CDK4/6 inhibition enhances the efficiency of tumor cell antigen 
presentation prompted us to examine the tumor immune microenvironment. Flow cytometric 
analysis of MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors revealed that abemaciclib did not alter fractions 
of most types of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Strikingly, however, 
there were significant increases in CD3+ T cells (Fig. 4a) and reductions in CD4+FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells (Tregs, Fig. 4b). Circulating Treg numbers were also significantly lower 
(Extended Data Fig. 9b). These results were upheld in MMTV-PyMT mammary and CT-26 
colorectal carcinomas (Extended Data Fig. 9c, d). Moreover, the Treg:CD8 T cell ratio 
decreased significantly in abemaciclib-treated tumors, further suggesting a tipping of the 
immune balance in favor of anti-tumor immunity (Fig. 4c).

 In tumor-free mice, both abemaciclib and palbociclib significantly reduced Treg numbers 
and the Treg:CD8 ratio in the spleen and lymph nodes, demonstrating tumor-independent 
effects of these agents (Fig. 4d; Extended Data Fig. 9e, f). Plasma levels of anti-nuclear and 
anti-double stranded DNA antibodies were unchanged (not shown; Extended Data Fig. 9g), 
indicating no significant accompanying autoimmune phenotype. To understand why Tregs 
were reduced in number, we analyzed the impact of CDK4/6 inhibitors on various aspects of 
Treg biology. Palbociclib and abemaciclib each significantly reduced total thymic mass, 
decreased immature CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes, and increased the fractions of 
CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive thymocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9h–k), consistent with 
previous reports of CDK6 inhibition14. However, proportions of thymic Tregs were 
unchanged, arguing against a defect in natural Treg production (Extended Data Fig. 9l). 
Similarly, CDK4/6 inhibitors did not prevent in vitro differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells 
into Tregs, and did not affect rates of Treg apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 9m, n). We then 
turned our attention to Treg proliferation. In vitro, abemaciclib markedly reduced the 
proliferation of CD4+CD25+ Tregs isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of wild-type 
mice, but had a weaker effect on the proliferation of CD4+CD25− and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 
4e). Likewise, the fraction of proliferating Tregs, but not CD8+ T cells, within abemaciclib-
treated tumor tissue was significantly reduced (Fig. 4f; Extended Data Fig. 9o). DNMT1 
inhibition in Tregs has previously been reported to suppress their proliferation, ostensibly 
via hypomethylation of the Cdkn1a promoter, thus increasing expression of the Cdkn1a 
protein, p21 - a potent and promiscuous cell cycle inhibitor15. In tumor-free mice treated 
with abemaciclib for 12 days, Dnmt1 expression was reduced in Tregs by ~70%; in contrast, 
Dnmt1 mRNA was unchanged in naïve CD4+ T cells and fell by only 20% in CD8+ T cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 9p). Mirroring the magnitude of these changes, expression of Cdkn1a 
increased 75-fold in Tregs, 2.8-fold in CD8+ T cells, and was unchanged in naïve CD4+ T 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 9q). Therefore, the relatively selective suppression of Treg 
proliferation after CDK4/6 inhibition could relate to enhanced cell cycle inhibition due to 
overexpression of p21, associated with reduced levels of DNMT1.
Tumor cells presenting antigen via MHC class I can be recognized by cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTLs), and Tregs suppress CTL responses, in part by promoting their 
exhaustion16. Therefore, to determine whether CTLs were involved in abemaciclib-mediated 
therapeutic efficacy, we implanted MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor fragments orthotopically 
into athymic Foxn1nu mice maintained on doxycycline, and treated them once tumors were 
established. In contrast to tumors in immunocompetent mice, abemaciclib-treated tumors in 
nude mice continued to grow, albeit at a significantly slower rate than vehicle-treated 
tumors, and in no case did tumors regress (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). We therefore treated 
MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor-bearing mice with an anti-CD8 antibody prior to 
abemaciclib administration. Abemaciclib-induced tumor regression, which was observed in 
control IgG treated mice, was significantly mitigated by CD8 neutralization (Fig. 4g and 
Extended Data Fig. 10c). Hence, tumor regression mediated by CDK4/6 inhibition is, at 
least in part, dependent on the presence of CTLs.
Intratumoral CD8+ T cells in abemaciclib-treated mice displayed markedly reduced 
expression of PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4, and LAG3 (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 10d–g), 
markers typically indicative of T cell exhaustion17. The number of inhibitory receptors

 detected on any given CTL was lower in abemaciclib-treated MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 and 
MMTV-PyMT tumors (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 10h). Specifically, the fractions of both 
PD-1high and PD-1+/TIM-3+ CTLs were significantly reduced (Fig. 4h; Extended Data Fig. 
10d). Levels of Ifng mRNA (the main effector cytokine of CTLs) were more than 4-fold 
higher in abemaciclib-treated bulk tumor tissues (Extended Data Fig. 10i). Collectively, 
these results indicated that CDK4/6 inhibition results in activation of CTLs, which are 
necessary for abemaciclib-induced tumor regression.
Increased tumor cell antigen presentation coupled with anti-tumor T cell responses 
suggested that immune checkpoint blockade might further enhance the efficacy of 
abemaciclib. We treated MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor-bearing mice with either vehicle or 
abemaciclib, and a control IgG or an anti-PDL1 antibody (Extended Data Fig. 10j). In 
agreement with our initial experiments, abemaciclib-treated tumors initially decreased in 
volume before stabilizing and ultimately resuming growth by day 21 (Fig. 4j). In contrast, 
tumors in mice treated with abemaciclib and anti-PDL1 combination therapy regressed to 
the greatest degree (~70% reduction in tumor volume by day 13), and did not resume growth 
by day 35 (Fig. 4j; Extended Data Fig. 10k). Similar results were obtained for the CT-26 
colorectal carcinoma model, wherein combination therapy induced complete tumor 
regression in all cases, and rendered mice disease-resistant when re-challenged with a 
subsequent injection of CT-26 tumor cells 5 weeks after stopping therapy (Extended Data 
Fig. 10l, m).
Collectively, our data in cell lines, animal models, and breast cancer patients demonstrate 
that CDK4/6 inhibitors enhance anti-tumor immunity by overcoming two central 
mechanisms of tumor immune evasion (Extended Data Fig. 10n). First, they increase tumor 
cells’ functional capacity to present antigen. Second, they reduce the immunosuppressive 
Treg population by suppressing their proliferation. Intriguingly, these phenomena might not 
only cooperate to enhance tumor immunogenicity, but could also have the same mechanistic 
underpinning – suppression of the Rb-E2F axis, leading to reduced DNMT1 expression and 
thus hypomethylation of genes that regulate immune function10,12,15. The selective 
suppression of Treg proliferation (and not that of CD8+ or naïve CD4+ T cells) might relate 
to the fact that Tregs express higher levels of Rb1, a key mediator of CDK4/6 pathway 
modulation18 (e.g. Rb1 expression is 3.1-fold higher in Tregs than CD8+ T cells19). With 
respect to breast cancer specifically, we note that the majority of human breast cancers are 
estrogen-receptor positive – these tumors generally retain Rb function and are considered 
inherently less immunogenic. Interestingly, a high number of Tregs in these tumors also 
predicts a poor clinical outcome20. Our findings therefore suggest that CDK4/6 inhibitors 
might enhance the susceptibility of such tumors to immune checkpoint blockade.

 (C57BL/6 Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J; Jackson Labs) were used as a source of CD8+ T cells 
for in vitro co-culture assays. FVB CD45.2+ mice (gift from Dr. Daniel Tenen, Harvard 
Medical School) were used as a source of T cells for in vitro studies.
Tumors were induced and maintained in MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mice using doxycycline as 
previously described6. For experiments in transgenic MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 and MMTV-
PyMT mice, tumors measured 4–10 mm at treatment initiation. Prior to treatment, mice 
were assigned into groups of equal average tumor volume. For CT-26 experiments, 1×105 
tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in 1:1 PBS:Matrigel, injected subcutaneously into 
Balb/c mice, and treatment was initiated one week later. For rechallenge experiments, 5×105 
tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in 1:1 PBS:Matrigel 33 days after treatment was 
stopped. PDX 14-07 was established from a biopsy of a liver metastasis from a patient with 
ER+/Her2+ breast cancer as previously described6.
For studies in Foxn1nu mice, MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor fragments were orthotopically 
implanted bilaterally into nude mice, as previously described6. Prior to treatment initiation, 
mice were randomized into groups of equal average tumor volume (5–10 mm diameter).
For in vivo experiments, samples sizes were determined based on previous model-specific 
experience. Tumors were measured by caliper 2–3 times per week, and volume was 
calculated as previously described6. For tumor growth kinetic analysis, we performed two-
way ANOVA or one-way ANOVA tests with correction for multiple comparisons using 
Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. No animals were excluded from analyses. Ex vivo 
analyses of mouse tissues were performed in a blinded fashion such that the investigators 
were unaware of treatment groups. Source data for tumor volume measurements can be 
found in Supplementary Table 2.
Abemaciclib (75–90 mg/kg, as noted for individual experiments, Haoyuan Chemexpress, 
prepared as previously described6) and palbociclib (90mg/kg, Haoyuan Chemexpress, 
diluted in 50 nM sodium D-lactate) were administered daily by oral gavage. For CD8 
depletion experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with either α-CD8 antibody 
(400 μg; clone YTS 169.4, BioXcell) or isotype control (400 μg; clone LTF-2, BioXcell) 48 
and 24 hours prior to beginning abemaciclib therapy (90mg/kg) and every 4 days thereafter. 
For combination therapy, treatment with abemaciclib was initiated at a dose of 90 mg/kg 
daily for 3 days; thereafter, the dose was dropped to 75mg/kg daily and intraperitoneal 
injection of either α-PDL1 antibody (200 μg every 72 hours; BioXcell, clone 10F.9G2) or 
isotype control antibody (200 μg every 72 hours, clone LTF-2, BioXcell) was added to the 
regimen.
Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. All mouse experiments were performed in 
compliance with federal laws and institutional guidelines as approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committees of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical 
School, and Boston Children’s Hospital. The maximum tumor diameter permitted under the 
relevant animal protocols is 25mm, and this limit was not exceeded in any experiment.

 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunostaining for Ki-67 (Vector), HER2 (AB16901; Abcam), and STAT1 (AB47425; 
Abcam) was performed as previously described6. Secondary antibodies (AF488 AffiniPure 
donkey anti-mouse IgG, Cy3 AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG) were from Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Images were acquired with a Yokogawa spinning disk 
confocal on an inverted Nikon Ti fluorescence microscope using MetaMorph image 
acquisition software, and 3–5 fields were analyzed per tumor. Image analysis was performed 
using a semi-automated in-house platform (NIH ImageJ).
Immunofluorescence for FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s; eBioscience), CD8 (clone 4SM15; 
eBioscience), and Ki-67 (clone SP6; Thermo Scientific) was performed as previously 
described21. Secondary antibodies (AF488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, AF647 goat anti-rat IgG) 
were from Life Technologies. Tissues were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images 
were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope using NIS Elements software, and 5–10 
fields were analyzed per tumor.
Human cell lines
BT474, SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, and MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines 
were maintained as previously described6 with slight modifications: antibiotics and anti-
fungals were not used in cell culture media. MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). All cell lines were obtained from ATCC, 
tested negative for mycoplasma, and their identity was verified by short tandem repeat 
analysis (Promega GenePrint 10 System).
Murine cell lines
MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3 cells22 (gift from Dr. Andreas Möller, QIMR Berghofer Medical 
Research Institute) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). 
B16-OVA cells23 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 μg/mL 
G418 (Invitrogen). CT-26 cells (gift from Dr. Steve Elledge, Harvard University) were 
cultured in RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell lines tested negative for 
mycoplasma, and their murine strain of origin was confirmed by short tandem repeat 
analysis (Bioassay Methods Group, NIST).
In vitro drug studies
Abemaciclib and lapatinib (Haoyuan Chemexpress) were diluted as previously described6. 
For in vitro use, palbociclib was diluted in DMSO. Cleaved PARP was measured after 48 
hours of treatment with DMSO, lapatinib, or abemaciclib. Lapatinib was used at 30 nM for 
BT474 and SKBR3; 500 nM for MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361. Abemaciclib was used 
at 300 nM for BT474 and SKBR3; 25 nM for MDA-MB-453; 500 nM for MDA-MB-361. 
For staurosporine experiments, MDA-MB-453 cells were pretreated with DMSO or 
abemaciclib (500 nM) for 0, 1, or 7 days prior to exposure to staurosporine (500nM, Enzo 
Life Sciences) for 4 hours. For hormonal therapy studies, cells were treated with 
combinations of DMSO, abemaciclib (100 nM), and fulvestrant (100 nM, Sigma Aldrich). 
To determine JAK dependency, cells were treated with combinations of DMSO, abemaciclib 
(500nM), and ruxolitinib (500nM, Selleckchem) for 7 days.

 Western blots
Western blotting was carried out as previously described6 using antibodies to cleaved PARP 
(CST 9541), cleaved caspase-3 (CST 9661), phospho-STAT1 Y701 (CST 9167), STAT1 
(CST 9172), and FLAG (CST 2368) (Cell Signaling Technologies), vinculin (V9131, 
Sigma) and DNMT1 (92314, Abcam). For western blots assessing phosphorylated and total 
STAT1 in tumor cells, lysates from equivalent numbers of cells were loaded in each lane. 
Uncropped western blots can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.
β-galactosidase activity
SA-β-galactosidase expression was determined as previously described6.
Transcriptome methodology
AmpliSeq™ libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Ion Torrent Proton platform 
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as previously described24,25. 
For human gene analysis in cell lines, the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene 
Expression Kit is designed for targeted amplification of over 20,000 human RefSeq genes 
simultaneously in a single primer pool. A short amplicon (~110 bp) is amplified for each 
targeted gene. Since an AmpliSeq transcriptome mouse kit is not commercially available, an 
Ion AmpliSeq™ Custom Panel was designed by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) using Ion 
AmpliSeq™ Designer for targeted amplification of 3,826 mouse genes that are most relevant 
for our studies (one short amplicon for each gene) in one primer pool for mouse studies. For 
each sample, 10 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA library preparation. Multiple libraries 
were multiplexed and clonally amplified using the Ion OneTouch 2 System (Thermo Fisher), 
and then sequenced on an Ion Torrent Proton machine (Thermo Fisher). Data was first 
analyzed by Torrent Suite and ampliSeqRNA analysis plugin (Thermo Fisher) to generate 
count data.
Mouse transcriptome analysis
Raw read counts per gene were mapped to corresponding human homologs, using homology 
information from the Mouse Genome Informatics database (The Jackson Laboratory). For 
GO analysis, differential gene expression was determined using DESeq226 and genes were 
ranked according to log2 fold change (MAP). For GSEA analysis, we used the 
GSEAPreranked tool, with the above ranked gene list, using MSigDB v5.1 Hallmarks gene 
sets collection and the “classic” method for calculating enrichment scores27,28.
Human transcriptome analysis
Analyses were performed on normalized read counts per gene. For GO analysis, only genes 
with an absolute read count of >20 on at least one sample were included. For these genes, 
the fold change in normalized read count was determined for each replicate experiment, and 
the mean fold change was calculated for each gene. Genes with a mean fold change of >2 
(DMSO vs abemaciclib) were then included for analysis using gene ontology enrichment 
analysis.

 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis
Gene expression data were obtained using the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://
www.cbioportal.org). Data were obtained from the breast cancer dataset “TCGA, 
Provisional (1105 samples)” for comparisons between cyclin D1 shallow deletion, amplified, 
gain, and diploid tumors7,29.

 Flow cytometry
Tumor cell lines: 1×106 cells per condition were stained with the appropriate antibodies 
diluted in PBS (Hyclone) plus 2% FBS (Life Technologies) for 30 minutes on ice. Matched 
fluorescence minus one (FMO) staining for each condition was performed as a control.
Blood: Obtained by retro-orbital sampling at intermediate time points and by cardiac 
puncture at experimental endpoints. Blood cells and plasma were separated by centrifugation 
at 1,500 × g for 8 minutes at 4°C.
Spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes: Single cell suspensions were obtained by mechanical 
digestion.
Tumor: Tumors were first mechanically disrupted by chopping, then chemically digested in 
dissociation buffer (2 mg/mL collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochemical), 0.02 mg/mL 
DNase (Sigma Aldrich) in DMEM (Life Technologies) containing 5% FBS (Life 
Technologies), PenStrep (Hyclone)) with agitation at 37°C for 45 minutes.
Following RBC lysis if necessary (blood, spleen, thymus, tumor; PharmLyse, BD 
Biosciences), single cell suspensions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (Biolegend) for 20 
minutes on ice and then incubated with appropriate antibodies for 30 min on ice.
Murine antibodies: Antibodies were purchased from Biolegend unless otherwise indicated: 
CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 145-2C11), CD8 (clone 53-6.7), CD4 (clone RM4-5), 
PD-1 (clone 29F.1A12), Tim-3 (clone RMT3-23), CTLA-4 (clone UC10-4B9), LAG-3 
(clone C9B7W), B220 (clone RA3-6B2), NK1.1 (clone PK136), CD11b (clone M1/70), 
Ly6G (clone 1A8), Ly6C (clone AL-21; BD Pharmigen), and FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s; 
eBioscience). Human antibodies: β2-microglobulin (clone 2M2) and HLA-A,B,C (clone 
W6/32). Anti-mouse/rat FoxP3 staining set (eBioscience) was used for intracellular staining 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. dsRNA was detected by the K1 antibody 
(English and Scientific Consulting (Hungary) using 75% ethanol for fixation. 7AAD was 
used to distinguish live/dead cells, except in cases requiring intracellular staining in which 
case eFluor 450 (eBioscience) or Zombie Yellow (Biolegend) fixable viability dyes were 
used. To determine the absolute number of cells in a sample, CountBright absolute counting 
beads (Molecular Probes, ThermoFisher) were added. Flow cytometry was performed on a 
LSRII (BD Biosciences) or FACSCANTOII (BD Biosciences), and data was analyzed using 
FlowJo (TreeStar). Flow cytometry gating strategies can be found in the Supplementary 
Methods (regulatory T cell gating strategy, Supplementary Methods 1; thymic cell 
populations, Supplementary Methods 2; and immune checkpoint molecules on intratumoral 
T cells, Supplementary Methods 3).
Tumor cell/OT-I co-culture assay
MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3-OVA and B16-OVA cells were pre-treated with abemaciclib (500 
nM or 1000 nM, respectively) or DMSO for 7d. Tumor cells were pre-incubated with 40 
μg/mL of appropriate antibodies for 1 hr at 37°C. For the MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3-OVA 
experiments, anti-H-2Kb (clone Y-3) or isotype control IgG2b (clone MPC-11) were used

 from Bioxcell. For the B16-OVA experiments, anti-H-2Kb-SIINFEKL (clone 25-D1.16) or 
isotype control (clone IS5-21F5) from Miltenyl Biotec were utilized. CD8+ T cells were 
isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of OT-I or P14 mice using a CD8a+ T cell isolation 
kit (Miltenyl Biotec) with an autoMACS pro separator. Isolated T cells were suspended in 
RPMI (ATCC) with 5% FBS, labeled with 5 μM CFSE (Biolegend) for 10 minutes in the 
dark at room temperature, and washed twice in 10× volume of T cell media (RPMI, 10% 
FBS, 55 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco)). 1×105 CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with 
abemaciclib or control pre-treated tumor cells at a ratio of 1:8 tumor cells:T cells (MMTV-
PyMT-S2WTP3-OVA) or 1:4 tumor cells:T cells (B16-OVA) in a final concentration of 10 
μg/mL of the appropriate antibody with 2.5 ng/mL IL-7 (Peprotech), 50 ng/mL IL-15 
(Peprotech), and 2 ng/mL IL-2 (Peprotech) for 48 hrs (MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3-OVA) or 72 
hrs (B16-OVA) at 37°C in the dark. At the experimental endpoint, cytokines in conditioned 
media were analyzed by ELISA, and CD8+ T cell proliferation was determined by CFSE-
dilution by flow cytometry.
Overexpression vectors and transfection
MMTV-PyMT-S2WTP3 cells were infected with lentiviral particles expressing the pHAGE-
deltaOA-zsGreen plasmid as previously described6, and infected cells were isolated by 
FACS.
MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells were transient transfected with pBabepuro3-p16Flag 
(Addgene Cat # 24934) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. 72 hours after transfection cells were selected in puromycin for 
48 hours. p16 overexpression was confirmed by anti-FLAG western blots.
For overexpression of DNMT1, MDA-MB-453 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3/
Myc-DNMT1 vector (Addgene Cat #36939) using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were treated with abemaciclib 72 hrs after transfection.
ELISAs
Cells were treated with DMSO or abemaciclib (500 nM) for 7 days. For the last 24 hours, 
culture media was replaced with serum free media. Following concentration of conditioned 
medium using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore), cytokines were analyzed 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations: human IFN gamma ELISA Ready-SET-
Go! (Affymetrix eBioscience), human TNF alpha ELISA Ready-SET-Go! (Affymetrix 
eBioscience), Verikine human IFN alpha ELISA kit (PBL assay science), VeriKine-HS 
human IFN beta serum ELISA kit (PBL assay science), human IL-28B quantikine ELISA 
kit (R&D Systems), human IL-28A DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems), and human IL-29 
DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems). Cytokine production by OT-I T cells in OVA/OT-I co-
culture assays was measured by mouse IFN gamma ELISA Ready-SET-Go! (Affymetrix 
eBioscience) and mouse TNF-alpha Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-ANA and anti-dsDNA ELISAs (Alpha Diagnostic) were 
performed on plasma according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was 
measured on a Synergy Neo plate reader (BioTek) using Gen5 software.

 Interferon neutralization experiments
Cell lines were treated with DMSO or abemaciclib (500nM) for 7 days. For the duration of 
drug treatment, neutralizing antibodies were applied including: IFN gamma (1 μg/mL, R&D 
Systems, MAB2851), IFN alpha (2.0–2.5 μg/mL, R&D Systems, 21100-1), IL-28a (0.5 
μg/mL, R&D Systems, MAB1587), or IL-29 (1 μg/mL, R&D Systems, MAB15981-100). 
Successful neutralization was validated using recombinant human IFN gamma (Peprotech, 
250pg/mL) and IFN alpha (Life Technologies, 250pg/mL). Recombinant proteins were 
administered 24 hours prior to protein collection.
Analysis of methylation of the ERV3-1 5′-LTR
Genomic DNA was extracted from cells and subjected to RNAse treatment before standard 
bisulfite conversion (MethylEdge Bisulfite Kit, Promega). Bisulfite DNA was subjected to 
PCR, and then a second nested PCR, to amplify the 5′;-LTR of ERV3-1 using the method 
and primers as previously described30 to amplify a DNA fragment of 644bp. The PCR 
product was enzymatically digested using the RsaI restriction enzyme (New England 
Biolabs). Due to a CG site in the native DNA within this amplicon, this digestion will cut 
methylated DNA amplicons into ~ 317 bp and ~327 bp fragments, leaving the non-
methylated DNA uncut.
shRNA experiments
Two shRNA constructs to RB1 (TRC ID# TRCN0000295892 and TRCN0000295842) and 
shLuciferase control were expressed in tumor cells as previously described6. Suppression 
efficiency was validated by RT-qPCR.
Doxorubicin-induced senescence
MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells were treated with doxorubicin (Sigma Aldrich, 200nM) for 
a period of 24 hrs. The cells were then cultured in fresh media for 72 hours after treatment, 
and RNA was extracted for qPCR.
In vitro regulatory T cell differentiation
CD4+CD25− T cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of naïve FVB mice using 
the CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T cell kit (Miltenyl Biotec) with an autoMACs pro separator. 
Cells were cultured for 72 hours in T cell medium with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (1:1 ratio of 
cells:beads, ThermoFisher), 100 U/mL rhIL-2 (Peprotech), +/− 25 ng/mL rhTGF-β (R&D 
Systems) with DMSO or abemaciclib (125–1000 nM). Differentiation status for each 
condition was determined by intracellular flow cytometry for FoxP3. Fold change in percent 
differentiation with the addition of rhTGF-β was calculated for each condition and 
normalized to the DMSO control.
T cell proliferation in vitro
CD4+CD25− and CD4+CD25+ T cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of naïve 
FVB mice using the CD4+ CD25+ Regulatory T cell kit (Miltenyl Biotec); CD8+ T cells 
were isolated as described above. Isolated T cells were labeled with 5 μM CFSE (Biolegend) 
as described above. 1×105 cells were cultured in T cell medium with CD3/CD28 beads (1:1

 ratio of cells to beads), 100 U/mL rhIL-2 and DMSO or abemaciclib (250 or 500 nM) for 72 
hours at 37°C. CFSE dilution was analyzed at endpoint by flow cytometry.
Gene expression in isolated T cell populations
CD8+, CD4+CD25−, and CD4+CD25+ T cells were isolated as described above from lymph 
nodes and spleens of naïve FVB mice treated with vehicle or 90 mg/kg abemaciclib for 12 
days. Purity of isolated populations was confirmed by flow cytometry. mRNA was obtained 
using the NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. RT-qPCR was performed as described above.
Patient data
Gene expression data (GEO GSE93204) were obtained from biopsy samples from the 
NeoPalAna clinical trial (NCT01723774)9. Expression data was utilized in the log2 
normalized form. We used GSEA software (Broad Institute, MA) with the following settings 
for analysis: Number of permutations: 1000; Collapse dataset of gene symbols: true; 
Permutation type: gene set; Enrichment statistic: weighted; Metric for ranking genes: 
Signal2Noise; Gene list sorting mode: real; Gene list ordering mode: descending; Max size/
exclude larger sets: 500; Min size/exclude smaller sets: 15. Analysis was performed using 
the “Hallmarks v6.0” GSEA signatures.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed as described in the figure legend for each experiment. 
All statistical tests were two-sided, and non-parametric tests were used when variance was 
dissimilar between groups. All data are presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise noted in 
the legend. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p value ≤ 0.05. All data 
shown is representative two or more independent experiments, unless indicated otherwise.
