Abstract
Background—For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests due to non-shockable rhythms, delays 
in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the 
extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its impact on hospital-level 
outcomes is unknown.
Methods—Within Get with the Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103,932 adult patients 
(≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest due to a non-shockable rhythm who 
received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 to 2014. We constructed two-level 
hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in rates of delayed epinephrine 
administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital rates of survival to discharge and 
survival with functional recovery.

 Results—Overall, 13,213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this rate varied 
markedly across hospitals (range: 0% to 53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration 
were 58% higher at one randomly selected hospital compared to a similar patient at another 
randomly selected hospitals (median odds ratio [OR] 1.58; 95% C.I. 1.51 – 1.64). Median risk-
standardized survival rate was 12.0% (range: 5.4% to 31.9%) and risk-standardized survival with 
functional recovery was 7.4% (range: 0.9% to 30.8%). There was an inverse correlation between a 
hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine administration and its risk-standardized rate of survival to 
discharge (ρ= −0.22, P<0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ= −0.14, P=0.001). 
Compared to a median survival rate of 12.9% (interquartile range 11.1% to 15.4%) at hospitals in 
the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-standardized survival was 16% lower at hospitals in 
the quartile with the highest rate of epinephrine delays (10.8%, interquartile range: 9.7% to 
12.7%).
Conclusions—Delays in epinephrine administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are 
common and varies across hospitals. Hospitals with high rates of delayed epinephrine 
administration had lower rates of overall survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest due to non-
shockable rhythm. Further studies are needed to determine if improving hospital performance on 
time to epinephrine administration, especially at hospitals with poor performance on this metric 
will lead to improved outcomes.

More than 80% of in-hospital cardiac arrests are due to a non-shockable rhythm – namely 
asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA).1 Clinical guidelines recommend epinephrine 
within 3–5 minutes of onset of cardiac arrest for improving survival for asystole and PEA.2,3 
However, delays in epinephrine administration are common,4 and incremental delays in 
administration of epinephrine in non-shockable in-hospital cardiac arrests are associated 
with progressively worse survival.4,5 Based on these studies, some have advocated for 
adopting time to epinephrine administration as a hospital quality-metric for in-hospital 
resuscitation care.
It is conceivable that hospital efforts aimed at improving timely administration of 
epinephrine could potentially improve survival in this population where survival rates have 
been traditionally poor. The extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine 
administration, however, remains largely unknown. Quantifying hospital variation in delayed 
epinephrine administration, and its association with hospital factors and outcomes, would be 
important to understand in order to determine whether this gap in care is pervasive across 
hospitals or isolated to specific hospital groups.
To address this gap in knowledge, we used data from the Get With The Guidelines-
Resuscitation registry to examine hospital-level variation in rates of delayed epinephrine 
administration and whether certain hospital characteristics are associated with higher or 
lower rates of delays. Moreover, we examined the implications of hospital variation by 
determining the association between a hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine treatment and

 its rate of overall survival and survival with functional recovery for patients with non-
shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest.
Methods
Data Sources
We used data from the the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines®-
Resuscitation, a large prospective, hospital-based clinical registry of in-hospital cardiac 
arrest. The design of the registry has been described previously.1 Briefly, all patients with an 
in-hospital cardiac arrest, defined as absence of pulse, apnea, and unresponsiveness, without 
do-not-resuscitate orders, and who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation are identified and 
enrolled by trained personnel. To ensure completeness, multiple case-finding approaches are 
used, including a centralized collection of cardiac arrest code-sheets, review of hospital 
paging system logs, pharmacy records, hospital billing charges for resuscitation medication 
supplies, and routine checks of code carts.6 Data collection in the registry is based on the 
Utstein template, which is a standardized template of reporting on cardiac arrest.7,8 A 
number of measures have been implemented to further ensure data completeness and 
accuracy. These include rigorous training and certification of hospital staff, use of 
standardized software with internal logic checks, and periodic re-abstraction of data to 
ensure submitted records are accurate, with one particular data audit revealing an error rate 
of 2.4%.6 Matched data from American Hospital Association survey was used to obtain 
corresponding information on hospital characteristics.
Study population and variables
We identified 123,649 adults (≥18 years) with an index in-hospital cardiac arrest due to 
asystole or PEA in a hospital ward or intensive care unit (ICU) from January 1, 2000 to 
December 31, 2014. Given the different etiologies, staffing, and circumstances associated 
with cardiac arrest in the emergency department and procedural areas, cardiac arrests in 
these locations were not included in our study. Since our primary focus was to evaluate 
delays in epinephrine administration, we restricted our cohort to 107,139 patients who 
received at least one dose of epinephrine during resuscitation, did not receive vasopressin 
before epinephrine, and had available information regarding timing of epinephrine 
administration. We further excluded patients with missing data on the primary outcome of 
survival to discharge, and hospitals with low case-volume (< 10 cases) and missing data on 
hospital characteristics. Our final cohort comprised 103,932 patients at 548 hospitals 
(eFigure 1).
Study Variables and Outcomes
The primary exposure variable was time to administration of epinephrine, which was 
calculated as the difference between the time of first epinephrine administration and the time 
of cardiac arrest in whole minutes. Epinephrine administration >5 minutes after the 
recognition of cardiac arrest was defined as delayed, based on current guideline 
recommendations for administration of epinephrine within 3–5 minutes of cardiac arrest.2,3

 The primary study outcome was survival to discharge, and the secondary outcome was 
survival with functional recovery. The latter was defined as cerebral performance category 
(CPC) scores 1 (mild or no neurological disability) or 2 (moderate neurological disability).
Patient-level information included demographics (age, sex, race), cardiac arrest 
characteristics (initial rhythm - asystole or PEA, location [ICU, telemetry, non-monitored 
ward]), use of hospital-wide code alert, time of day [daytime vs. after-hours] and day of the 
week [weekday vs. weekend]), time to initiation of chest compressions (≤1 vs. > 1 minute), 
co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, major trauma, acute 
stroke, heart failure, hepatic and renal insufficiency, metastatic malignancy, sepsis, 
hypotension and fluid/electrolyte disorders), and interventions in place at the time of cardiac 
arrest (e.g. mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and hemodialysis). In addition, information 
regarding hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association 
database, and the included variables were hospital admission volume, total number of 
hospital beds, proportion of ICU beds, geographic region and teaching status. These patient. 
arrest, and hospital characteristics are defined in eTable 1 (online supplement).
Statistical analyses
Rates of delayed epinephrine administration for each hospital were calculated, and hospital 
variation in rates of delayed epinephrine was examined. Hospitals were then categorized into 
quartiles based on their rate of delayed epinephrine administration. Differences in patient- 
and hospital-characteristics across hospital quartiles of delayed epinephrine were evaluated 
using Cochrane-Armitage test for categorical variables and simple linear regression for 
continuous variables.
Next, we constructed a multivariable hierarchical regression model (patient- and hospital-
level) to examine the relationship of delayed epinephrine administration with patient and 
hospital factors. Such models account for clustering of patients within each hospital. In these 
models, we included hospital site as a random effect and adjusted for the above listed patient 
characteristics as fixed effects. We used the median odds ratio to quantify the extent of 
hospital variation in rates of delayed administration of epinephrine. The median odds ratio is 
obtained from a hierarchical model with only patient-level variables, is calculated using the 
estimate of the variance of the random hospital intercept, and is always greater than 1. For 
example, a median odds ratio of 1.5 suggests that the odds of delay in epinephrine 
administration for a patient are 50% higher at one randomly selected hospital compared to 
another randomly selected hospital for a similar patient. After quantifying the extent of 
hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration, we then added hospital 
characteristics to the hierarchical regression model to identify which hospital characteristics 
were associated with a hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine administration.
Finally, to examine the association between a hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine 
administration and its rate of survival to discharge, we first calculated risk-standardized rates 
of survival to discharge for each hospital using a previously validated methodology.9 To 
accomplish this, we constructed a multivariable hierarchical regression model with survival 
to discharge as the dependent variable. This model adjusted for patient factors, including 
demographics (age and sex), cardiac arrest characteristics (e.g., initial rhythm and location

 of arrest – monitored/non-monitored bed), delayed chest compressions (> 1 minute), 
comorbidities (e.g. myocardial infarction during hospitalization, major trauma, heart failure, 
diabetes, hepatic and renal insufficiency, metastatic malignancy, sepsis and fluid/electrolyte 
disorders), interventions in place at the time of cardiac arrest (e.g., mechanical ventilation, 
vasopressors and hemodialysis) based on the patient-level predictors of survival for in-
hospital cardiac arrest in prior reports.9 We calculated a hospital’s risk-standardized survival 
rate (RSSR) as the ratio of predicted-to-expected number of survivors at each hospital 
multiplied by the unadjusted survival rate.
The correlation between a hospital’s rate of delayed epinephrine administration with its risk-
standardized survival was then evaluated using Pearson’s correlation. Differences in risk-
standardized survival across hospital quartiles by rates of delayed epinephrine use were then 
described. Additionally, we quantified the proportion of the hospital variation in survival 
explained by hospital-level differences in rates of delayed epinephrine by including rates of 
delayed epinephrine use as an additional covariate in the hierarchical risk-adjustment model 
for survival.10 Finally, we included hospital characteristics (hospital teaching status, number 
of beds, proportion of ICU beds, case volume, and hospital quartile of delayed epinephrine) 
as independent variables in the above hierarchical regression model to determine their 
association with hospital risk-standardized survival rate. All analyses were then repeated for 
our secondary outcome of survival with functional recovery.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted a number of additional analyses to determine the robustness of our findings. 
First, in order to determine whether our findings were influenced by our definition of 
delayed epinephrine administration, we repeated the analysis of our primary outcome using 
a threshold of 3 minutes instead of 5 minutes to define delayed epinephrine administration. 
Second, given that delays in epinephrine administration and other aspects of resuscitation 
response may differ in patients who arrest in an ICU compared to patients who arrest outside 
an ICU, we repeated our primary analyses of hospital variation in epinephrine administration 
and its association with risk-standardized survival after restricting our cohort only to patients 
who arrested outside an ICU. Finally, since patients on vasopressor therapy prior to the onset 
of cardiac arrest may not derive benefit from additional epinephrine bolus, we repeated our 
analyses of hospital-level relationships after excluding patients receiving vasopressor 
therapy at the time of cardiac arrest.
All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (Cary, NC). Level of 
significance was set at P<0.05. The study was reviewed by the University of Iowa 
Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement for informed consent because the 
study used deidentified data.
Results
Overall, administration of epinephrine was delayed in 12.7% of patients. The proportion of 
patients with delayed epinephrine treatment varied widely across hospitals and ranged from 
0% to 53.8% (Median 13.5%, interquartile range: 9.5% – 19.0%, Figure 1). Hospitals were

 categorized into quartiles based on the proportion of patients with delayed epinephrine as 
follows: Q1:0–9.5%, Q2:9.5–13.5%; Q3:13.5–18.9%; Q4:19.0–53.8%.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize patient and hospital characteristics across hospital quartiles of 
delayed epinephrine use. Compared to patients at hospitals in the lowest quartile of delay 
(Q1), patients at hospitals in the highest delay quartile (Q4) were older (mean age 66.0 years 
in Q1 vs. 66.8 years in Q4), less likely to be women (43.1% in Q1 vs. 41% in Q4), and more 
likely to have renal insufficiency (39.2% in Q1 vs. 34.4% in Q4), hepatic insufficiency 
(9.6% in Q1 vs. 8.8% in Q4), septicemia (21.2% in Q1 vs. 16.7% in Q4), PEA as the initial 
pulseless rhythm (57.7% in Q1 vs. 55.9% in Q4), or be located in the ICU at the time of 
arrest (62.7% in Q1 vs. 52.0% in Q4) (Ptrend < 0.0001 for all). They were also less likely to 
be receiving vasopressors (30.0% in Q1 vs. 23.5% in Q4) or mechanical ventilation (36.4% 
in Q1 vs. 25.6% in Q4) at the time of cardiac arrest (Ptrend < 0.0001 for both). Hospitals in 
the highest quartile of epinephrine delay had lower non-shockable cardiac arrest volume 
(median volume in Q1, 151 vs. 45 in Q4), lower overall admission volume (proportion of 
hospitals with annual volume <10,000: 22.6% in Q1 vs. 52.2% in Q4), fewer beds (<250 
beds: 28.5% in Q1 vs. 57.3% in Q4), and were more likely to be non-teaching hospitals 
(42.3% in Q1 vs. 55.8% in Q4) (Ptrend < 0.0001 for all)
The median odds ratio for delayed epinephrine use after adjusting for differences in patient 
characteristics across hospitals was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.51, 1.64) suggesting 
that the odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at one randomly 
selected hospital compared to a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital. 
Among hospital structural characteristics, low hospital case-volume (<100 cases) was the 
only factor that was associated with delayed epinephrine administration (odds ratio [OR} 
1.30, 95% C.I. 1.17, 1.44; P<0.0001; eTable 2 in the online supplement). Hospital teaching 
status, total number of beds and proportion of ICU beds were not associated with delay in 
epinephrine administration. After additionally adjusting for hospital characteristics, 
substantial variation in delayed epinephrine administration persisted (median odds ratio 1.52 
(95% C.I: 1.46, 1.58).
Table 3 presents unadjusted and risk-adjusted study outcomes. Overall patient-level rate of 
survival to discharge was 12.3%, and survival with functional recovery was 7.8%. Hospital 
rate of delayed epinephrine was inversely correlated with unadjusted rates of survival to 
discharge (ρ=−0.22, P<0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ=−0.14, P=0.0005). 
After adjustment of patient characteristics across hospitals, the median hospital RSSR was 
10.8% at hospitals in the highest delay quartile (interquartile range [IQR]: 9.7% – 12.7%) 
compared to 12.9% in the lowest delay (best) quartile (IQR: 11.1% – 15.4%, Table 3, Figure 
2). Notably, addition of the variable, hospital rates of delayed epinephrine, explained 10% of 
the observed hospital variation in risk-standardized survival. Hospital performance on 
epinephrine administration was significantly associated with its RSSR even after adjusting 
for hospital volume, with lower survival at hospitals with more frequent delays (Q1: 
referent, Q2: 0.91 [0.81, 1.02], Q3: 0.86 [0.77, 0.97], Q4: 0.69 [0.60, 0.78]; Ptrend 0.03). 
Similarly, risk-standardized rates of survival with functional recovery were lower in the 
worst hospital quartile for delayed epinephrine administration (median 6.6%, IQR: 5.0% – 
8.6%) as compared with the best quartile (median 8.3%, IQR: 5.1% – 12.0%, Ptrend 0.003).

 The results of our sensitivity analyses closely aligned with those of our primary analysis. We 
redefined delayed epinephrine administration using a cut-off of > 3 min after onset of 
cardiac arrest. In these analyses, delayed epinephrine administration remained inversely 
correlated with risk-standardized survival to discharge (ρ= −0.24, P<0.0001), as in our main 
analyses (eTable 3 in the online supplement). Similarly, after restricting our sample to arrests 
outside of the ICU, we observed a wide variation in rates of delayed epinephrine use 
(median OR 1.48, 95% C.I. 1.42, 1.54, eFigure 2), which was inversely correlated to the 
hospital risk-standardized cardiac arrest survival rate (ρ= −0.19, P-value <.0001, eFigure 3). 
Finally, in analyses limited to patients not receiving vasopressor therapy at the time of 
cardiac arrest, we observed a wide hospital-variation in delayed epinephrine use (median OR 
1.51, 95% C.I. 1.44, 1.57, eFigure 4) as well as an inverse association between a hospital’s 
rate of delayed epinephrine administration and its risk standardized survival rate (ρ=−0.22, 
P-value <.0001, eFigure 5), consistent with the results of our primary analysis.
Discussion
In a large, multicenter registry of in-hospital cardiac arrests, we found large variation in 
timely administration of epinephrine for patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm of 
pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Differences in patient and cardiac arrest 
characteristics only partly explain the observed hospital-level differences in delayed 
epinephrine administration. Moreover, rates of overall survival and survival with functional 
recovery were lower at hospitals with more frequent delays in epinephrine administration 
compared to hospitals where such delays were less common. In sensitivity analysis, we 
demonstrated a similar relationship for a definition of epinephrine delays as >3 minutes, 
with significantly higher mortality in poorly performing hospitals. A number of our findings 
are important and merit further consideration.
In a recent patient-level analysis, there was a strong inverse association between delay in 
epinephrine administration and survival following non-shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest.4 
This study also suggested improved rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 
survival with functional recovery with timely administration of epinephrine. Our study adds 
to this growing literature, by showing marked hospital-level variation in delays to 
epinephrine treatment. Hospitals with lower rates of delays to epinephrine had higher rates 
of risk-standardized survival and survival with functional recovery.
Timely administration of epinephrine in patients with non-shockable rhythm has been 
proposed as a metric to assess hospital resuscitation quality, similar to time to defibrillation 
in patients with a shockable rhythm. However, contemporary evidence regarding the efficacy 
of epinephrine remains uncertain. The only randomized controlled trial that has evaluated 
epinephrine against placebo in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was terminated 
early due to poor enrolment. Only 600 patients were enrolled, compared to a projected 
sample size of 5000 patients.11 Treatment with epinephrine compared to placebo was 
associated with a nearly three-fold improvement in rates of ROSC (23.5% with epinephrine 
use vs. 8.4% with placebo). Survival to hospital discharge was also numerically higher in the 
epinephrine arm (4.0% vs. 1.9%) but was not statistically significant.11 Similar findings 
were noted in the subgroup of 289 patients with non-shockable rhythms, with higher rates

 for ROSC (20.9% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001) and survival to admission (23.5% vs. 11.0%) with 
epinephrine use.
At the same time, data from observational studies of epinephrine use in cardiac arrest are 
conflicting. While some studies have suggested worse survival,12,13 others have suggested a 
benefit.4,5,14,15 A key limitation of studies that showed a detrimental effect of epinephrine 
was that many of them included patients who did not receive epinephrine as the comparator 
group, leading to selection bias.12,13 Moreover, timing of epinephrine administration – an 
important confounder, was not accounted for in the analyses.12,13 Despite the uncertainty 
related to epinephrine in clinical studies, recent guidelines recommend administration of 
epinephrine as soon as feasible after cardiac arrest with initial non-shockable rhythm.2 
Therefore, the large variation in rate of delayed epinephrine administration observed in our 
study was particularly striking, with a median odds ratio of 1.61. Moreover, delays in 
epinephrine administration were more common at hospitals with low cardiac arrest case-
volume compared to high volume hospitals. This may point toward a lack of institutional 
experience at low volume sites with regards to resuscitation care as an important underlying 
factor. We did not find an association between hospital structural factors such as teaching 
status, or hospital bed size with delays in epinephrine administration. However, this finding 
wasn’t altogether surprising. In a previous study, substantial hospital variation was noted in 
rates of delayed defibrillation for in-hospital cardiac arrest due to shockable rhythm.16 
However, delays in defibrillation were not associated with hospital structural characteristics, 
except bed size in that study. These findings suggest that hospital processes of care are likely 
more important in determining hospital quality. Previous studies have shown that strategies 
such as more frequent CPR training and participation in simulation or mock codes may help 
improve retention of CPR skills, improve CPR quality and minimize treatment delays.17–19 
Understanding hospital-level determinants of delay in epinephrine administration, which 
may differ across sites, is an important next step.
The Institute of Medicine has recommended focused research on identifying and 
implementing best practices from hospitals with high survival rates for cardiac arrest to 
improve cardiac arrest outcomes across all hospitals.20,21 However, survival for cardiac 
arrests with an initial rhythm of PEA or asystole remains dismally low at less than 15%.1 
Moreover, few interventions have been effective in reducing the high mortality associated 
with non-shockable cardiac arrests. Given that patients with asystole or PEA comprise more 
than 80% of in-hospital cardiac arrests, efforts are urgently needed to identify processes of 
care that can improve survival in this high-risk population. Although, we found that hospital 
rate of delayed epinephrine administration was associated with survival outcomes for 
patients with non-shockable rhythms, our findings suggest a potential target for quality 
improvement but does not demonstrate causality. Future studies are needed to assess whether 
interventions directed at improving timeliness of epinephrine administration at poor-
performing hospitals leads to an improvement in survival rates at these hospitals.
Our findings should be interpreted in the light of the following limitations. First, while the 
registry includes detailed information on patient characteristics, there is potential of 
unmeasured residual confounding in our study due to its observational design. Although we 
used a robust risk-adjustment methodology, our study doesn’t suggest causality. It is possible 
Khera et al.

 that delays in epinephrine administration are confounding by other components of 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts, including quality of chest compressions, which is 
difficult to quantify and is not measured in the Get With The Guidelines – Resuscitation. 
Second, functional status has been inferred from CPC scores at discharge. While favorable 
CPC score at discharge is associated with improved long-term survival,22 patient 
performance on dedicated scales for neurological assessment were not available and we 
were therefore only able to assess functional status. Third, the time to epinephrine 
administration is obtained from retrospective hospital records, and is subject to discrepancy 
due to recording of time from multiple clocks in a code (e.g. the monitor, defibrillator, 
etc.).23 Any misclassification in documentation of times, however, would have biased our 
findings toward the null. Fourth, while there is information on preceding events and 
comorbid conditions, the specific etiology for cardiac arrest (e.g. trauma) are not reported. 
Finally, since participation in the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry is optional, 
our data may not be applicable to hospitals outside of those participating in this quality 
improvement registry.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found marked variation in the rates of delayed epinephrine administration 
across hospitals for in-hospital cardiac arrests due to asystole and PEA. This variation is 
only partly explained by differences in patient-, cardiac arrest- and hospital-characteristics 
across hospitals. Moreover, hospitals that performed poorly on this metric had worse 
survival outcomes. Further investigations are needed to identify the reasons for delayed 
epinephrine administration at poorly performing hospitals, and to understand if reducing 
delays to epinephrine treatment results in improved outcomes.

 Clinical Perspective
What is New?
•
In a large national registry, we found that delays in epinephrine 
administration (>5 minutes) for non-shockable in-hospital cardiac 
arrest varied substantially across hospitals.
•
Hospitals with higher rates of delays in epinephrine treatment had 
worse survival outcomes for its cardiac arrest patients.
What are the Clinical Implications?
•
While current resuscitation guidelines recommend prompt delivery of 
epinephrine treatment to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest due to 
asystole and pulseless electrical activity, there is substantial practice 
variation across hospitals.
•
Our findings suggest that hospitals with low survival rates for these 
cardiac arrest rhythms may benefit from quality improvement efforts 
that include minimizing delays in epinephrine administration.
