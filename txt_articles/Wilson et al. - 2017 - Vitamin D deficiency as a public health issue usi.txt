vitamin D3 in future fortification strategies

The role of vitamin D in supporting the growth and maintenance of the skeleton is robust;
with recent research also suggesting a beneficial link between vitamin D and other non-
skeletal health outcomes, including immune function, cardiovascular health and cancer.
Despite this, vitamin D deficiency remains a global public health issue, with a renewed
focus in the UK following the publication of Public Health England’s new Dietary
Vitamin D Requirements. Natural sources of vitamin D (dietary and UVB exposure) are
limited, and thus mechanisms are needed to allow individuals to achieve the new dietary
recommendations. Mandatory or voluntary vitamin D food fortification may be one of
the mechanisms to increase dietary vitamin D intakes and subsequently improve vitamin
D status. However, for the food industry and public to make informed decisions, clarity
is needed as to whether vitamins D2 and D3 are equally effective at raising total 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations as the evidence thus far is inconsistent. This review
summarises the evidence to date behind the comparative efficacy of vitamins D2 and D3 at
raising 25(OH)D concentrations, and the potential role of vitamin D food fortification as a
public health policy to support attainment of dietary recommendations in the UK. The com-
parative efficacy of vitamins D2 and D3 has been investigated in several intervention trials,
with most indicating that vitamin D3 is more effective at raising 25(OH)D concentrations.
However, flaws in study designs (predominantly under powering) mean there remains a
need for a large, robust randomised-controlled trial to provide conclusive evidence, which
the future publication of the D2–D3 Study should provide (BBSRC DRINC funded: BB/
I006192/1). This review also highlights outstanding questions and gaps in the research
that need to be addressed to ensure the most efficacious and safe vitamin D food fortification
practices are put in place. This further research, alongside cost, availability and ethical con-
siderations (vitamin D3 is not suitable for vegans), will be instrumental in supporting gov-
ernment, decision-makers, industry and consumers in making informed choices about
potential future vitamin D policy and practice.
Vitamin D2: Vitamin D3: 25-hydroxyvitamin D: Fortification
Overview of vitamin D
Role of vitamin D
The role of vitamin D in skeletal health is robust; the
major biological function of the active form of vitamin
D (1,25(OH)2D) is to maintain serum calcium and
phosphorus homeostasis, essential for bone mineralisa-
tion(1) and neuromuscular function(2). The discovery that
the vitamin D receptor is expressed in virtually all cells
in the human body(3) has led to the recognition that vita-
min D may have a role to play in many more processes
than previously thought. This concurs with the growing

 body of observational data showing associations between

concentrations
and
chronic diseases and conditions such as CVD, diabetes
and colorectal cancer(4). However, whether low 25(OH)D
concentrations are a cause or effect of such conditions
has not been established(4).
Sources of vitamin D
Vitamin D is the generic term used for both vitamin D2
and vitamin D3, also known as ergocalciferol and chole-
calciferol, respectively. Vitamin D2 is synthesised by the
exposure of ergosterol in plants to UVB radiation,
whereas vitamin D3 is synthesised in the skin of human
subjects and animals by the action of UVB radiation.
There are therefore two sources of vitamin D; diet and
exposure to sunlight. In human subjects, the action of
direct sunlight, containing UVB radiation of wavelengths
290–315 nm, on skin results in synthesis of vitamin
D. The first step in this synthesis is the conversion of
7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3, which is then
converted to vitamin D3 by a temperature-dependent iso-
merisation reaction.
Naturally occurring dietary sources of vitamin D
include both vitamin D2, found in plants and fungi,
and
vitamin
D3,
found
in
meat,
fish
and
eggs.
However, few naturally occurring food sources of vita-
min D are considered a rich source of vitamin D. The
few foods considered a good source of vitamin D are
mostly of animal origin and therefore contain vitamin
D3 such as oily fish, egg yolks and meat, liver and kidney.
Other sources include supplements or fortified foods,
which will be discussed later in this review. Both vitamins
D2 and D3 can be commercially synthesised for use as
supplements and to fortify foods, by UVB irradiation
of ergosterol from plants and fungi and 7-dehydrocholes-
terol from sheep’s wool, respectively.
In most countries, exposure of skin to UVB radiation
or supplement use are the main source of vitamin D and
in the UK skin synthesis is the primary source. The latest
UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey data collected in
2012/13 and 2013/14 showed mean dietary intakes of 3·1
and 2·5 µg/d in adult men and women, respectively(5),
although lower dietary intakes of 1·25–1·6 µg/d have
been reported for South Asian women in the UK(6).
Global vitamin D status and recommendations
Rates of vitamin D deficiency
Data from across the globe have shown that vitamin D
deficiency is a worldwide issue. Although different cut-
off points have been used to define deficiencies, these
data are based on 25(OH)D concentrations below 25
nM/l. Studies have reported the prevalence of deficiency
to range from 2 to 30 % across Europe(7), 38 to 80 % in
women of child-bearing age in the Middle East(8,9), and
3·5 % in the USA, although when ethnicity was consid-
ered the prevalence of deficiency were highest among
non-Hispanic black individuals at 15 %(10).
In the UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition
Survey(5) reported that 22 % of men and 15 % of
women aged 19–64 years had total 25(OH)D concentra-
tions below 25 nM/l all year-round. Furthermore, sea-
sonal variation in 25(OH)D concentrations exists(11);
previous National Diet and Nutrition Survey data
reported rates of deficiency increasing to 39 % in men
and
women
between
January
and
March(12).
Sub-groups of the population, particularly those consid-
ered at-risk of vitamin D deficiency, have shown even
higher
rates
of
deficiency;
a
longitudinal
study
(D-FINES) looking at dietary and sunlight contribution
to seasonal vitamin D status in South Asian and
Caucasian women of child-bearing age reported that
51·4 % of the South Asian women had 25(OH)D concen-
trations <25 nM/l in the summer months, and this rose to
64·5 % in the winter(13).
Vitamin D dietary recommendations
In July 2016, the Scientific Advisory Committee on
Nutrition published the new UK recommendations for
vitamin D(14). Based on the health outcome of musculo-
skeletal health, the Scientific Advisory Committee on
Nutrition concluded that the estimated average nutrient
intake required to maintain 25(OH)D concentrations at
or above 25 nM/l in winter for 97·5 % of the population
aged between 11 years and older is 10 µg/d, and a refer-
ence nutrient intake (RNI) of 10 µg/d was set for every-
one aged 1 year and above. Prior to this update, there
was no RNI for vitamin D set for those aged 4–64
years(15), unless the individual was considered at-risk of
deficiency. This was based on the assumption that suffi-
cient vitamin D was made, through skin synthesis, and
stored during the summer months to sustain 25(OH)D
concentrations during the winter months, which is now
known not to be the case(11,13).
This new RNI brings the UK in-line with other
European and international recommendations being
previously the only country in Europe without a dietary
recommendation for all aged 4–6 years(7).
Vitamins D2 and D3
Comparative metabolism
The chemical structures of vitamins D2 and D3 are simi-
lar but not identical; vitamin D3 has an additional dou-
ble bond and methyl group, and it is postulated that
this different structure results in vitamin D3 being the
preferred substrate at several stages of the pathway of
metabolism of vitamin D.
Both vitamins D2 and D3, irrespective of source,
undergo the same metabolism process from the venous
circulatory system, a two-step hydroxylation process.
Firstly, vitamins D2 and D3 are transported by the vita-
min D-binding protein to the liver where they are con-
verted to 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3, respectively, by
the action of 25-hydroxylase. These are then transported,
again by the vitamin D-binding protein, to the kidneys
where they are converted to the biologically active form

D
(1,25(OH)2D),
by
the
action
of
1-α-hydroxlyases.
There is data to suggest that the differences in the side
chains of the two forms of vitamin D directly affect the
rate of vitamin D hydroxylation at the liver, with vitamin
D3 thought to be the preferred substrate for hepatic
25-hydroxylase(16,17). Vitamin D3 and its metabolites
also have a higher binding affinity to the vitamin
D-binding protein than vitamin D2
( 18). In addition to
these metabolic differences between the two forms of
vitamin D, the degradation of vitamin D3 requires an
addition step/process to that of vitamin D2, which sug-
gest that the degradation rate of vitamin D2 may be
higher than that of vitamin D3
( 19).
Therefore, there are several biologically plausible
mechanisms by which vitamin D3 may have a greater
capacity than vitamin D2 to raise and maintain 25(OH)
D
concentrations,
as
reviewed
by
Houghton
and
Vieth(18), although randomised-controlled trial (RCT)
data have not conclusively supported this theory, as dis-
cussed below.
Comparative efficacy at raising 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentrations
Historically, vitamins D2 and D3 were considered as
equally effective at raising 25(OH)D concentrations(20).
However, since the 1980s there have been a number of
intervention trials, including RCT, published that have
investigated specifically this, as shown in Table 1, and
these have shown conflicting results. Although the major-
ity of intervention trials comparing the two forms of vita-
min D have provided data suggesting that vitamin D3 is
superior to vitamin D2 in raising 25(OH)D concentra-
tions(21–36), there have also been four trials that have pro-
duced data supportive of vitamins D2 and D3 being
equally effective(37–40). There are no studies which have
shown that vitamin D2 is more effective than vitamin D3.
In 2012, Tripkovic et al. conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis of RCT data comparing the efficacy of
vitamins D2 and D3 in raising 25(OH)D concentra-
tions(41). Although ten studies were identified within the
systematic review, only seven studies had sufficient and
available data to be included within the meta-analysis.
The primary analysis, of all seven studies regardless of
dosing frequency, showed that vitamin D3 led to a
greater absolute change in 25(OH)D concentrations
than vitamin D2, with a weighted mean difference of
15·23 (95 % CI 6·12, 24·34; Z = 3·28; I2 = 81 %; P =
0·001). To determine any confounding effect of dosing
frequency, separate analyses were performed on: (a) stud-
ies giving bolus doses and (b) studies with daily supple-
mentation.
For
bolus
studies
alone
vitamin
D3
remained significantly more effective than vitamin D2,
with a weighted mean difference of 34·10 (95 % CI
16·39, 51·83; Z = 3·77; I2 = 77 %; P = 0·0002). However,
when the analysis was completed on the daily dosing
RCT data alone, the differentiation between the two
forms of vitamin D was moderated with a non-significant
weighted mean difference of 4·83 (95 % CI −0·98, 10·64;
Z = 1·63; I2 = 41 %; P = 0·10).
Key limitations of the meta-analysis were identified
and discussed by the authors. Firstly, there were few
studies for inclusion within the analysis, and of the stud-
ies that were available these were small and unpowered
with respect to study population size (n 19–89). There
was also substantial between-study heterogeneity, with
diverse intervention strategies, including varied doses of
vitamin D, frequencies of supplementation and methods
of administration, and all the studies used supplementa-
tion doses in excess of current recommendations(14).
Taking these factors into consideration, the authors con-
cluded that far larger, more robust trials are required to
not only measure 25(OH)D concentrations in response to
vitamins D2 and D3, but also to explore potential
mechanisms behind any differences seen.
Since the 2012 meta-analysis, there have been at least
another ten further intervention trials comparing the
efficacy of vitamins D2 and D3 in raising 25(OH)D
concentrations(23,26,27,29–31,33,34,38,40). However, findings
remain equivocal with eight of the studies showing vita-
min D3 to be more effective at raising or maintaining
25(OH)D
concentrations
compared
to
vitamin
D2
( 23,26,27,29–31,33,34), and two of these trials reporting no
significant
difference
between
the
two
forms(38,40).
However, a direct comparison between the total change
in 25(OH)D concentrations in response to vitamins D2
and D3 was not reported in the analysis by Fisk et al.
which returned neutral findings(38).
These more recent studies have addressed some, but
not all, of the limitations identified from the 2012 system-
atic review and meta-analysis. Specifically, over half of
the studies since 2012 examined supplementation doses
closer to the range of current global recommendations.
However, underpowered sample sizes remain an issue;
the largest published RCT comparing the efficacy of vita-
mins D2 and D3 on raising 25(OH)D concentrations had
a total of 107 subjects across three intervention groups(27)
as shown in Table 1. There remains a need for a large,
robust RCT to provide more conclusive evidence in
which confidence in results can be sought and the publi-
cation of the BBSRC Diet and Health Research Industry
Club (DRINC) funded D2–D3 Study (BBSRC DRINC:
BB/I006192/1, ISRCTN23421591); an RCT in n 335
healthy white Caucasian and South Asian women,
should provide just that(42).
Potential mechanisms from randomised-controlled
trial data
Within some of these intervention trials the mechanisms
by which vitamins D2 and D3 might lead to different
effects on total 25(OH)D concentrations have been
explored. Where methods such as LC-MS/MS for meas-
uring 25(OH)D concentration are implemented, 25(OH)
D2 and 25(OH)D3 concentrations are measured, which
are added together to determine total 25(OH)D concen-
trations. In studies where these two metabolites have
been measured, the vitamin D2 interventions have led
to an increase in 25(OH)D2 concentrations and the vita-
min D3 interventions have led to an increase in 25(OH)
D3 concentrations(21,24,27,29,37,38), as would be expected.

 However, a decreasing effect of vitamin D2 interventions
on 25(OH)D3 concentrations has been noted in several
intervention trials(21,22,27,35), although not all(24,37,38).
The same has not been shown for vitamin D3; vitamin
D3 interventions have not shown a decreasing effect on
25(OH)D2 concentrations; however, baseline 25(OH)D2
concentrations tend to be far lower at baseline (typically
<5 nM/l) and so the opportunity for a decreasing effect is
not available. Although even where mean baseline 25
(OH)D2 concentrations were slightly higher (13·3 nM/l)
no change was shown in the vitamin D3 intervention
group(24).
This decline in 25(OH)D3 concentrations reported in
those taking vitamin D2 could explain why vitamin D3
is more effective at raising total 25(OH)D concentra-
tions, and although the exact mechanisms are unknown
this
could
reflect
either
competitive
binding
for
25-hydroxylase or the vitamin D-binding protein, or
changes in degradation rate as discussed previously.
Further research is needed to elucidate the exact
mechanisms and to understand the impact of these
changes on overall health, and not just total 25(OH)D
concentrations.
Fortification
Across Europe, legislative and voluntary fortification
policies and practices vary from country to country. In
1940, vitamin D fortification of margarine and fat
spreads became mandatory in the UK and Ireland,
although only to bring the vitamin D content up to the
level naturally found in butter and not with the aim of
improving population intakes. Currently most margar-
ines and fat spreads are still fortified voluntarily despite
the mandatory requirement being revoked in 2014(43);
however, it is important to note that although these
would be considered fortified food, the amount of vita-
min D added is 7·5–10 µg per 100 g, and thus the contri-
bution to population intakes of vitamin D is minimal.
Vitamin D, in the form of either vitamin D2 or D3, is
legally permitted to be added to foods on a voluntary
basis (Annex 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006,
amended by the Commission Regulation (EC) No
1170/2009), and foods which are most commonly for-
tified include breakfast cereals and more recently, non-
dairy milks. However, as the amount of vitamin D
added in to fortified products is low, fortified foods still
contribute very little (0·8 µg/d) to the dietary intake of
the UK adult population(12).
It
has
been
suggested
that
additional
strategic
approaches to fortification, including bio-fortification,
of a wider range of foods, have the potential to increase
vitamin D intakes in the population(44). Bio-fortification
is the process by which nutritional quality is enhanced
through agronomic or modern biotechnology techniques,
as opposed to being added manually at a later stage of
product processing. A thorough review of food-based
solutions for vitamin D deficiency has recently been pub-
lished by Hayes and Cashman earlier this year(45) and
includes a review of the need for traditional fortification

 but also provides an overview of recent advances in the
field of bio-fortification, which may have greater con-
sumer appeal. To date, there are several methods of bio-
fortification that have begun to be explored, including
vitamin D3 enhancement in eggs and meat through add-
ition of vitamin D to animal feeds(45), and the use of UV
radiation to enhance the vitamin D2 content of foods
such as mushrooms, which has recently been examined
in a systematic review and meta-analysis(46). Although
the majority of these developments have proved success-
ful at improving vitamin D status in RCT, one recent
RCT, feeding bread baked with UV-treated yeast,
resulted in no significant change in 25(OH)D concentra-
tions, despite the vitamin D2 content of the baked bread
being confirmed by HPLC(26,47). This raises concerns
about the bio-accessibility of these bio-fortified foods
and highlights the need for human RCT data to provide
proof of efficacy and safety prior to products reaching
the market.
There are two key projects that have, and continue to,
significantly contribute to the evidence base for the
potential role of vitamin D fortified foods: (1) the
Optimal Fortification with vitamin D (OPTIFORD;
www.optiford.org) European project investigated the
feasibility of fortification as a strategy for improving vita-
min D status; among their findings they concluded that
bread was a safe and feasible vehicle for fortification(48);
(2) the food-based solutions for optimal vitamin D nutri-
tion and health throughout the life cycle project (ODIN;
www.odin-vitd.eu), an EU funded project consisting of a
multi-disciplinary team across 18 countries, aiming to
develop food-based strategies with agri-food producers
and the food industry that provide proof of efficacy
and safety. To date the research team have published
several key studies including a RCT with vitamin
D-enhanced eggs(49) and a meta-analysis of studies exam-
ining the effects of UV-exposed mushrooms(46) on vita-
min D status. The final report from the ODIN project
is due in 2017.
Supplementation
Supplementation is another potential strategy to support
the UK population in achieving the dietary recommen-
dation and subsequently improving vitamin D status.
Although there are no data showing the number of peo-
ple in the UK currently taking vitamin D supplements
specifically, National Diet and Nutrition Survey data
have shown that 23 % of adults aged 19–64 years and
39 % of adults over 65 years take at least one dietary sup-
plement(12). Currently the UK advise daily supplements for
those considered at-risk of vitamin D deficiency such as
young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, house-
bound elderly and those with darker skin tones. However,
the awareness and adherence to this current guidance is
poor(50) and so the impact of this advice, and any potential
future advice, will only be realised if individuals are willing
to take supplements and remember to do so. Universal
provision of supplements has been identified as a successful
strategy in some European countries where they are recom-
mended for infants (Norway, Germany, Austria and
Switzerland) and children up to the age of 5 years
(Sweden). The potential universal use of vitamin D supple-
mentation in the UK is therefore worthy of further
research, as discussed in greater detail in two recent
reviews(7,50).
Conclusion
The introduction of 10 µg/d as the new RNI for the UK
population aged 1 year and above introduces a new era
for
vitamin
D
recommendations(51).
The
Scientific
Advisory Committee on Nutrition Vitamin D Working
Group recognised that achieving the new RNI of 10 µg/
d from natural dietary sources alone would be a chal-
lenge and so they have recommended that the UK gov-
ernment,
namely
Public
Health
England
and
the
Department of Health, give consideration to strategies
to support the UK population with achieving this
RNI(14). One of these potential strategies is fortification
of foods, via mandatory or voluntary means. There has
been significant progress in the research to support the
use of vitamin D in food fortification, including the
growth of potential bio-fortified foods, but there are out-
standing questions and gaps in the research that need to
be addressed to ensure the most efficacious and safe for-
tification practices are put in place. In addition, this
review also highlights the need for further clarity as to
the relative efficacy of vitamins D2 and D3 in raising
total 25(OH)D concentrations, which the publication of
the D2–D3 Study results will support. This further
research will be key, alongside considerations, including
cost, availability and ethics (vitamin D3 is not suitable
for vegans), in allowing government, decision-makers,
industry and consumers to make informed choices
about potential future vitamin D policy and practice.
