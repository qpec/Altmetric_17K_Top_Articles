IMPORTANCE Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing leads to antimicrobial resistance and
suboptimal clinical outcomes. Changing antimicrobial prescribing is a complex behavioral
process that is not often taken into account in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether an antimicrobial stewardship approach grounded in
behavioral theory and focusing on preserving prescriber autonomy and participation is
effective in improving appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Dutch Unique Method for Antimicrobial
Stewardship (DUMAS) study was a prospective, stepped-wedge, participatory intervention
study performed from October 1, 2011, through December 31, 2015. Outcomes were
measured during a baseline period of 16 months and an intervention period of 12 months. The
study was performed at 7 clinical departments (2 medical, 3 surgical, and 2 pediatric) in a
tertiary care medical center and a general teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Physicians
prescribing systemic antimicrobial drugs for any indication for patients admitted to the
participating departments during the study period were included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS We offered prescribers a free choice of how to improve their antimicrobial
prescribing. Prescribers were stimulated to choose interventions with higher potential for
success based on a root cause analysis of inappropriate prescribing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions was
determined using a validated approach based on guideline adherence and motivated
guideline deviation and measured with repeated point prevalence surveys (6 per year).
Appropriateness judgment was masked for the study period. Antimicrobial consumption was
extracted from pharmacy records and measured as days of therapy per admission. We used
linear and logistic mixed-model regression analysis to model outcomes over time.
RESULTS A total of 1121 patient cases with 700 antimicrobial prescriptions were assessed
during the baseline period and 882 patient cases with 531 antimicrobial prescriptions during
the intervention period. The mean antimicrobial appropriateness increased from 64.1% at
intervention start to 77.4% at 12-month follow-up (+13.3%; relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.04-1.27), without a change in slope. No decrease in antimicrobial consumption was found.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of a behavioral approach preserving prescriber autonomy
resulted in an increase in antimicrobial appropriateness sustained for at least 12 months. The
approach is inexpensive and could be easily transferable to various health care environments.

ppropriate antimicrobial prescribing has significant
clinical benefits (ie, reduced mortality) and reduces de-
velopment of antimicrobial resistance and health care
costs.1,2 Antimicrobial stewardship programs aim to improve
antimicrobial prescribing but sometimes fail to acknowledge
thatimprovingantimicrobialprescribingactuallymeanschang-
ing human behavior.3,4 Human behavior is not based on a fully
rational process but depends on a complex interplay between
several behavioral determinants and social norms.5-10 De-
spite its rational theoretical foundation, stewardship pro-
grams are known to persistently encounter prescriber resis-
tance. This resistance is generated by the tension between the
governance of the stewardship team and the autonomy of in-
dividual prescribers.11-19 Behavioral and social theory seem
underused in antimicrobial stewardship intervention pro-
grams, contrary to more common use in other scientific
fields.3-8,10,20,21 Previous studies8,22-27 using interventions
based on behavioral theory have found promising results in
improving antibiotic prescribing. Most of these studies fo-
cused on antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infec-
tions in primary care.
We used behavioral theory to design and implement an in-
tervention approach to improve appropriateness of hospital
antimicrobial prescribing for all indications. Our approach was
inspiredbytheparticipatoryactionresearchparadigm,28which
focuses on collaboration and empowerment of the stakehold-
ers in the change process and is effective in other complex
health care situations.28 In our approach, prescribers were in-
vited to choose and codevelop 1 or more interventions to im-
prove their own prescribing, whereby they were stimulated to
base their choice on conclusions of a prior root cause analysis
of their prescribing patterns. The approach is therefore de-
signed to benefit from tailoring to local determinants7,29-33 and
draws on 3 behavioral principles: (1) respect for the prescrib-
ers’autonomy to avoid feelings of resistance11-19; (2) the incli-
nation of people to value a product higher and feel more own-
ership for it if they made it themselves, which is referred to as
the IKEA effect34-36; and (3) the tendency of people to follow
uponanactiveandpubliccommitment.8,37-40Weaimedtotest

Methods
Study Design
TheDutchUniqueMethodforStewardship(DUMAS)studywas
aprospective,stepped-wedge,participatoryinterventionstudy
aimed to improve antimicrobial prescribing. The institu-
tional medical ethics review boards of the VU University Medi-
cal Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and OLVG, Amster-
dam, the Netherlands, approved all study procedures and
waived informed consent for patients.
Setting
The study was performed from October 1, 2011, through
December 31, 2015. Seven departments from 2 hospitals
participated, of which 3 were surgical, 2 were medical, and
2 were pediatric departments. Hospital 1 was a 700-bed ter-
tiary care medical center with salaried specialists, and hos-
pital 2 was a 550-bed teaching general medical center with
self-employed specialists, both located in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. During the study period, hospital 1 used a pre-
existing preauthorization system for broad-spectrum anti-
microbials, whereas hospital 2 performed antimicrobial
audit and feedback interventions but only in departments
not participating in the study.
Enrollment
The local antibiotic formulary committee selected depart-
mentsforstudyparticipationbasedontheneedforchange(low
appropriatenessandmoderatetohighantimicrobialconsump-
tion), for which the results of 12 months of baseline antimi-
crobial appropriateness and consumption measurements
were available. We then approached department heads or the
department’
s infectious disease expert with a participation re-
quest. Participation was voluntary, and we offered no finan-
cial compensation. Seven of 8 approached medical depart-
ments agreed to participate; 1 department head refused for
unspecified reasons. Timing of the start of the intervention
phase for each department was not randomized because of ex-
pected availability issues of relevant department stakehold-
ers,educationschedules,andpotentialapprovaldelaysofethi-
cal review boards. Intervention start sequence and timing are
shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.
Outcome Measures
Our primary outcome was antimicrobial appropriateness,
measured with a validated appropriateness assessment
instrument.41 One of 3 infectious diseases specialists (includ-
ing M.A.v.A. and E.J.G.P.) assessed the adult prescriptions, and
1 of 3 infectious diseases/immunology pediatricians (includ-
ing M.v.d.K.) assessed the pediatric prescriptions for appro-
priateness. They were masked for clinical outcomes and study
period (baseline or intervention). Data were collected prospec-
tively, but assessments were performed retrospectively to
enable masking. Each of the following antimicrobial prescrip-
tion factors was assessed for appropriateness: indication,
Key Points
Question How effective is an antimicrobial stewardship approach
grounded in behavioral theory and focused on preserving
prescriber autonomy and participation in improving
appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals?
Findings In this multicenter intervention study examining 1121
patient cases with 700 antimicrobial prescriptions during the
baseline period and 882 patient cases with 531 antimicrobial
prescriptions during the intervention period, appropriateness of
antimicrobial prescribing significantly increased by 13.3% during a
follow-up period of 12 months after intervention start.
Meaning Future antimicrobial stewardship efforts in hospitals
should use behavioral theory to improve intervention
effectiveness in various clinical settings.

of the following criteria applied for each of the above factors:
complete guideline adherence or guideline deviation or no
guideline but based on rational reasons, as judged by the as-
sessing infectious diseases specialist, immunology special-
ist, or pediatrician. Rationality was defined as an effective an-
timicrobial regimen that covered relevant pathogens without
being excessive (ie, unnecessary combination therapy or broad
spectrum when a more narrow spectrum is available). If pre-
sent, drug allergies, oral intake, and previous culture results
were taken into account. Cases that could not be assessed be-
cause of missing information were excluded. We notified clini-
cal staff of both hospitals by email before the start of the base-
line measurements.
Antimicrobial consumption was a secondary outcome, re-
ported in days of therapy per 100 admissions per month. An-
timicrobial appropriateness and consumption measure-
ments only included prescriptions with Anatomical
TherapeuticChemicalcodesbeginningwithJ01,J02,J04AB02,
and J05AB.42 Other outcomes were changes in specific appro-
priateness categories, intravenous antimicrobial consump-
tion, consumption of specific antimicrobial subgroups, and
length of hospital stay.
Data Collection
Antimicrobial appropriateness was measured through point
prevalence surveys at a rate of 6 times per year. Local antimi-
crobial stewardship teams performed the surveys as part of
standard quality measurements. All team members were
trained and supervised by the coordinating investigator
(J.J.S.) using standard operating procedure documents. An
antimicrobial case was included in the survey if the patient
was admitted to a clinical ward of a participating depart-
ment and had a prescription for a systemic antimicrobial
agent at 0.00 hours on the day of the survey. Relevant clini-
cal data needed for assessment, including prescription indi-
cation and reasons for guideline deviations, were collected
by contacting the responsible ward physician or were
retrieved from medical files. Antimicrobials prescribed for
prokinetic reasons (erythromycin) were excluded. Data
were then coded and stripped from any identifying informa-
tion. To prevent anticipatory behavior, we did not notify the
clinical wards of the exact survey dates.
Data on antimicrobial consumption, admission rates,
admission diagnoses, and length of stay were derived from
pharmacy systems and administrative records. Only data on
patients with a length of stay of at least 24 hours were
included. Two pediatric critical care units were not included
because of lack of electronic data. Baseline and intervention
periods were at least 12 months, but more data were col-
lected whenever possible.
Root Cause Analysis
An analysis of local root causes of inappropriate prescribing
was performed after 12 months of baseline measurements
for the baseline phase of each department separately. The
analysis was based on interviews of a purposive sample of
department members. Sample size depended on depart-
ment size but included at least 2 medical specialists, 2
junior physicians, and 2 nurses per department. Interviews
were audio recorded. The interviewer (J.J.S.) was a psy-
chologist and physician trained in qualitative research.
Interviewees supplied written informed consent before the
interview start. The interviews were guided by a topic list
that consisted of standard questions that focused on the
cause categories of the Eindhoven Classification Model:
technical, organizational, human, and patient (see eTable 1
in the Supplement for a translated topic list).43,44 The inter-
viewer asked additional questions on potential causes for
inappropriate prescribing using the 5 whys method, which
entails repeatedly asking for a cause underlying each cause
of a certain event as supplied by the interviewee.45 For addi-
tional validity, the conclusions of the analysis were dis-
cussed with department members during the intervention
approach.
Intervention Approach
Figure 1 summarizes the intervention approach. The ap-
proach was performed for each department separately and
started with a plenary introduction and discussion with
department physicians. Participation was voluntary for
each department and physician. Department members were
stimulated to choose interventions with higher potential for
success based on the root cause analysis, which would
result in one set of interventions per department. Interven-
tion choice was not predefined, was free, and was only
restricted by practical feasibility. Essential to the approach

 was the appointment of 1 or more antibiotic ambassadors
chosen by their peers, which defined the start of the inter-
vention period. We also informed nurses from each depart-
ment of the baseline results. The ambassador team con-
tained at least 1 medical specialist per department, but
participation of junior physicians, nurses, and quality-of-
care personnel was encouraged. Department ambassadors
were asked to represent their department during subse-
quent intervention discussions, to champion good antibiotic
policy and the chosen interventions,3,29 and to help develop
and implement the interventions. Support and involvement
of study personnel with each department’
s intervention
approach were determined by the preferences of the antibi-
otic ambassador(s) and limited to a maximum of 12 months
after the start of the intervention period.
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic mixed regression analysis to model antimi-
crobial appropriateness time trajectories and linear mixed re-
gression analysis to model monthly antimicrobial consump-
tionandlength-of-staytimetrajectories.Eachmodelcontained
the fixed-effects variables of time, study period, and the in-
teraction term, which allowed the baseline period to func-
tion as control for the intervention period. The intervention
period was considered to have started with the first plenary
department meeting. Odds ratios were converted to relative
risks for better interpretability.46 We included random ef-
fects for department and clinical ward in each model. Antimi-
crobial consumption analyses contained a random effect for
month of the year to account for season effects. All continu-
ous outcomes were log transformed before analysis. To be able
to report outcomes on the original scale of measurement, we
calculated predicted means per time point, which were then
back-transformed in case of continuous outcomes. Regres-
sioncoefficientsfromthesemodelswerebacktransformedand
then transformed to change percentages for optimal interpret-
ability.
The CIs were calculated with 10 000 bootstraps while ac-
counting for the clustered nature of the data. Significance level
was.05(2-sided).Mainanalyseswerelimitedtotheperiodwhen
data were available for all departments: 16 months before and
12 months after the start of the intervention period.
We performed a sensitivity analysis for both primary out-
comes: a mixed-model analysis with only study period as the
fixed effect, ignoring slopes. We performed the analyses of the
antimicrobial appropriateness and consumption subgroups
using the same single fixed-effect method because we as-
sumed time trend estimations were more vulnerable to chance
events in these small groups. We used R statistical software,
version 3.2.3 with package lme4, version 1.1-11, for all analy-
ses (R Development Core Team).
Results
Population and Point Prevalence Survey Characteristics
There were 21 306 clinical admissions during the baseline
periodand15 394clinicaladmissionduringtheinterventionpe-
riod. The appropriateness surveys included 1121 patients
during the baseline period and 882 patients during the inter-
vention period. Detailed characteristics are given in Table 1.
Root Cause Analyses and Chosen Interventions
The root cause analyses identified causes in 4 themes: physi-
cian (eg, lack of knowledge), culture (eg, rejection of interfer-
ence), organization (eg, infectious diseases experts set wrong
example), and guidelines (eg, hard to find and use). Between
2 and 4 interventions per department were chosen, each con-
nected to 1 or 2 of the above themes; for example, participa-
tory education sessions (physician and culture), presence of
infectious diseases physicians during ward round (organiza-
tion), and guideline revision (guidelines). Detailed character-
isticsaregiveninFigure2andeTable1intheSupplement.Time
from the first plenary meeting to the implementation of the
first intervention varied between immediate (supervisors
promise to improve) to 6 months for the first pediatrics de-
partment, where the antibiotic ambassadors team was formed
4 months after the plenary meeting because of logistical
problems.
Antimicrobial Appropriateness
The intervention approach was associated with a significant
13.3% (95% CI, 64.1%-77.4%) increase in antimicrobial appro-
priateness (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.27), without any
significant changes in time trends (Figure 3A). Results of the

 Antimicrobial Consumption
Antimicrobial consumption did not decrease significantly dur-
ing the intervention phase, and there were no changes in time
trends (Figure 3B). Results of the analyses per antimicrobial
drug group are given in Table 2 and per department in eTable
2 in the Supplement.
Other Results
Length of hospital stay did not change relative to the start of
the intervention approach (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The
single fixed-effect sensitivity analysis supported the primary
analysis showing similar results (Table 2).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first hospital antimicrobial stew-
ardship study grounded in behavioral science and allowing
physicians a free choice in how to improve their own
prescribing.28 In our multicenter study in 7 departments di-
vided between 2 hospitals (a teaching and an academic hos-
pital), we found that our approach was associated with a sig-
nificant13.3%increaseinantimicrobialappropriatenessduring
a period of 12 months after the intervention start. We found
no reduction in antimicrobial consumption.
We believe the observed increase in antimicrobial appro-
priateness is clinically relevant because our definition of ap-
propriateness specifically focused on unwanted prescrip-
tions from a stewardship point of view. Attainment of
underlyinggoals,suchasempiricaltherapy,accordingtoguide-
linesandde-escalationoftherapyimprovesmortalityandother
clinical outcomes.2 The potential drawback of such a method
is that it is based on expert opinion. However, in a recent vali-
dation study,41 the used appropriateness instrument had 80%
agreement with a reference standard that consisted of the
modal assessment of 15 medical specialists (infectious dis-
eases specialists and clinical microbiologists). Of impor-
tance, the persistence of the effect during the relatively long
follow-upperiodof12monthssuggestsgoodsustainability.20,47
ThetrendbacktobaselineinFigure3issuggestivebuttoosmall
and the CI is too wide to interpret this as such. The true effect
of our approach can be estimated by extrapolating the results
from our point prevalence surveys to all antimicrobial days of
therapyprescribedatparticipatingdepartmentsduringthefirst
12 months of the intervention period (37 046 days). This would
mean that the 13.3% increase in appropriateness equaled 4927
improved days of therapy.
Our study design incorporated an extensive number of re-
peated measurements, which allowed us to control interven-
tion effects for baseline levels and trajectories. This way we
could discern between the effects of our intervention ap-
proach and previous events or interventions. By starting the
intervention approach at a different time for each depart-
ment (stepped-wedge design), we minimized the chance that
the overall effect was influenced by external events (eg, na-
tional campaigns for prudent antimicrobial use).
The effectiveness of our approach is explained by the
advantages of using methods from behavioral science. We
hypothesize that participating department members felt rela-
tively nonthreatened by our approach because of their free-
dom in choosing a personal solution, which is an important
theme in antimicrobial stewardship.11-17,19 Moreover, by com-
mitting to the project and choosing and developing their own
intervention set, they may have felt more inclined to support
the project and change their own prescribing behavior.8,34-40
This may have been an important intervention in itself.

 Finally,givingprescribersafreeinterventionchoicecouldhave
led to them choosing an easy way out, for instance, choosing
education as the only intervention. However, because our ap-
proachincorporatedarootcausesanalysisofprescribing,arec-
ommendedstrategyinstewardship,7,30-33prescribersweregen-
tly nudged toward using interventions that were likely to be
more effective.48 An approach similar to ours has been unsuc-
cessful in improving antimicrobial prescribing in nursing
homes.49 However, among other differences, that study used
apredeterminedlistofpossibleinterventions,whichmayhave
limited prescribers’feeling of freedom and diminished sup-
port of the aforementioned IKEA effect.34-36
We found no reduction of antimicrobial consumption in
our study. This finding may reflect that overall antimicrobial
use is a nonspecific measure without information on appro-
priateness of therapy. Moreover, an increase in antimicrobial
prescribing quality can be reached without a reduction in days
of therapy, for instance, by increasing streamlining, better dos-
ing, and using more narrow-spectrum therapy empirically
(Table 2).2 In line with this, we found a significant 26% reduc-
tion in the consumption of penicillins with β-lactamase in-
hibitors, which was the most prescribed type of antibiotic in
our population. Alternatively, that finding could suggest that
prescribers find it harder to stop or refrain from starting than
to narrow antibiotic prescribing because these situations may
be more dependent on individual clinical reasoning than on
evidence-based guidelines.
The patient safety of our approach was based on the pre-
served full autonomy of prescribers at all times during the
study, which would make a worsening of patient safety un-
likely. Our focus on appropriateness had the advantage that it
stimulated adherence to multidisciplinary and generally evi-
dence-based guidelines, even when this would lead to more
instead of fewer days of therapy. The absence of an increase
in length of hospital stay can be seen as circumstantial evi-
dence in this regard.
Limitations and Strengths
Ourstudyhaslimitations.First,prescribers’awarenessofbeing
monitored could have led to a change in behavior (Haw-
thorne effect). Because they were informed of the study be-
fore the start of the baseline measurements, this could have
led to diminished intervention effects. Of importance, the de-
partmentreceivedevenmoreattentionfromtheresearchteam
during the start of the intervention phase; thus, the Haw-
thorne effect would then be even bigger. However, this behav-
ioralphenomenon(ie,personalattentionforcommitmentleads
to behavioral change) is in fact a feature not a bug of the in-
tervention approach mechanism.
Second, the stepped-wedge enrollment order was non-
randomized because the approach was dependent on practi-
cal circumstances, such as department preferences, room in
the educational roster, or availability of department heads
and opinion leaders. We believed that adapting to these cir-
cumstances superseded the advantages of randomization,
especially because this adaption will also be necessary when
implementing our approach in practice. Still, although
we found no evidence of this, departments could have
stalled their participation in the study until they improved
their antibiotic prescribing on their own just before interven-
tion start.
Third, the earlier validation study of the antimicrobial
appropriateness method was limited to prescriptions for adult
patients.However,therewasnoproceduraldifferencewiththe
method used for the assessment of pediatric prescriptions.
Fourth, execution of our approach in one pediatric depart-
ment was less fluent, with delayed implementation of some
interventions. This was caused by time constraints of the an-
tibiotic ambassador and the department’
s extensive size. The
local effect of the approach on appropriateness mirrored this
(eTable 2 in the Supplement), perhaps reflecting the impor-
tance of the ambassador on the effect.
Fifth, the Dutch health care system differs from other sys-
tems, which may limit generalizability. However, our results
were achieved regardless of specialists’payment structure
because we included both salaried (hospital 1) and self-
employed specialists (hospital 2).

 Sixth, a potential weakness of a stepped-wedge design is
contamination of the intervention; thus, information or ef-
fects of departments in the intervention period could have in-
fluenceddepartmentsstillinthebaselineperiod.Althoughthis
effect cannot be excluded, to our knowledge, there were no
physicians who transferred between participating depart-
ments in this period.
Our approach offers good potential for implementation in
other hospitals, even in resource-challenged circumstances,
because it adapts to local possibilities, requires no expensive
investments, and is successful in surgical, medical, and pedi-
atric settings. The root cause analysis method was relatively
simple and pragmatic and was performed without help from
qualityimprovementpersonnel.Ourstudywasperformedwith
a minimal budget, comprising the salary of 1 research physi-
cian and an estimated 3 hours per week of infectious diseases
specialisteffortsfor3years.Ofimportance,forpracticalimple-
mentation without research objectives, many (but not all) of
ourtime-consumingappropriatenessmeasurementsmaythen
be omitted. On the other hand, a bigger financial budget may
increase effectiveness because more expensive desired inter-
ventions, such as mobile applications, could then be imple-
mented.
Conclusions
Useofaparticipatoryapproachbasedonbehavioraltheorywith
a central focus on prescriber autonomy resulted in an in-
crease in antimicrobial appropriateness sustained for at least
12 months. The approach is unique, inexpensive, and suited
to different types of hospital departments.
