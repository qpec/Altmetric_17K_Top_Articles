In Brief
The hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, feeds
from and lays eggs on plants. Bisch-
Knaden et al. show that feeding and
oviposition can be elicited by
monomolecular, plant-derived odorants
and that odor-evoked neural activity in
distinct olfactory glomeruli is correlated
with these types of behavior.

SUMMARY
Female hawkmoths, Manduca sexta, use olfactory
cues to locate nectar sources and oviposition
sites. We investigated if the behavioral significance
of odorants is represented already in the antennal
lobe, the first olfactory neuropil of the insect0s
brain. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we first estab-
lished a functional map of the dorsal surface of the
antennal lobe by stimulating the moths with 80
ecologically relevant and chemically diverse mono-
molecular odorants. We were able to address 23 ol-
factory glomeruli, functional subunits of the antennal
lobe, in each individual female. Next, we studied the
relevance of the same odorants with two-choice ex-
periments (odorant versus solvent) in a wind tunnel.
Depending on odorant identity, naive moths made
attempts to feed or to oviposit at the scented targets.
A correlation of wind tunnel results with glomerular
activation patterns revealed that feeding and ovipo-
sition behaviors are encoded in the moth’s antennal
lobe by the activation of distinct groups of glomeruli.
INTRODUCTION
Insects, like many other animals, use their sense of smell to
locate ecologically relevant targets from a distance. Olfactory
cues play an important role for nocturnal insects, like the hawk-
moth Manduca sexta, that forage, mate, and oviposit from dusk
to dawn. These moths feed on floral nectar from solanaceous
plants, including jimson weed (Datura wrightii) and coyote to-
bacco (Nicotiana attenuata), which also serve as host plants for
the herbivorous caterpillars. The adult moths also use flowers
from non-hosts (e.g., Palmer’s century plant [Agave palmeri])
as nectar sources (Alarcon et al., 2008). Hence, the life history
of M. sexta is closely associated with different plant species,
and it has been shown that its behavior to a large part is gov-
erned by olfactory cues (Haverkamp et al., 2016b; Kessler and
Baldwin, 2007; Raguso and Willis, 2002; Riffell et al., 2008;
Spa
¨ the et al., 2013b). Odorants are often innately attractive or
aversive, thereby helping the animal to decide, for instance, to
approach or avoid a potential food source or oviposition site.
Odorants with a specific valence activate spatially distinct re-
gions in higher brain centers of mammals (Rolls et al., 2003)
and insects (Strutz et al., 2014), but do so even at the first
processing levels, for example, the olfactory bulb in the mouse
(Kobayakawa et al., 2007), or the antennal lobe of the vinegar
fly (Knaden et al., 2012). Here, we investigated how different
plant-derived odorants contribute to decision-making in this
moth and if we find neuronal correlates of these decisions in
the first olfactory processing center, the antennal lobe.
Being similarly organized, both the olfactory bulb of mammals
and the antennal lobe of insects have a species-specific number
of spherical structures, so-called olfactory glomeruli. Each
glomerulus receives input from a subpopulation of olfactory sen-
sory neurons expressing the same type of olfactory receptor.
Hence, each glomerulus constitutes a functional subunit of the
antennal lobe, and the number of glomeruli roughly reflects the
number of olfactory receptors expressed in that species (Gao
et al., 2000; Vosshall et al., 2000). The incoming olfactory infor-
mation is modulated by local interneurons that connect to sen-
sory neurons and to projection neurons (Heinbockel et al.,
2013; Reisenman et al., 2011), the latter conveying the informa-
tion to higher levels of the olfactory pathway. Studies with vine-
gar flies have shown that a single odorant activating a single,
narrowly tuned glomerulus can mediate innate attraction or aver-
sion (Ebrahim et al., 2015; Stensmyr et al., 2012). However, a
concerted action of several input channels is commonly required
to control the fly0s behavior (Badel et al., 2016; Kreher et al.,
2008). Odorants usually activate several glomeruli implicating a
combinatorial coding strategy of olfactory information (Malnic
et al., 1999).
In M. sexta, the antennal lobe comprises �70 glomeruli
(Grosse-Wilde et al., 2011) arranged in a single layer around
a central fiber core. After opening the head capsule, the
neural representation of odorants at the dorsal surface of the
antennal lobe (i.e., in �35 glomeruli) can be studied simulta-
neously using in vivo calcium imaging (Galizia et al., 1999).
A bath-applied fluorescent calcium sensor allows monitoring
of neural activity in the exposed brain area on stimulation of
the antenna with odorant puffs. In this way, odorant-specific
spatial
patterns
of
glomerular
activity
can
be
recorded
(Bisch-Knaden et al., 2012; Hansson et al., 2003). As all cell
types in the antennal lobe are monitored by using a bath-
applied calcium sensor, the question arises of whether the
observed activation patterns reflect the response of input or

 output neurons. Each glomerulus in the antennal lobe of fe-
male M. sexta receives input via 4,000–5,000 olfactory sensory
neurons (Oland and Tolbert, 1988). The number of projection
neurons per glomerulus, however, is only four to five (Homberg
et al., 1988; King et al., 2000). This convergence ratio of about
1,000:1 between input and output neurons strongly suggests
that the activation patterns reflect rather the activity of
incoming sensory neurons than the activity of projection
neurons. The response of �360 local interneurons, most of
them arborizing in many if not all glomeruli, might additionally
contribute to neural activation patterns (Homberg et al., 1988;
Reisenman et al., 2011).
The volatiles from hawkmoth-visited flowers (Loughrin et al.,
1990; Raguso et al., 2003a; Raguso et al., 2003b; Riffell et al.,
2009a) as well as the odorants emitted by vegetative parts of
host plants (Fraser et al., 2003; Reisenman et al., 2013;
Spa
¨ the et al., 2013b) have been thoroughly investigated. Plant
volatiles have been shown to attract moths when presented
as a blend of several compounds (Fraser et al., 2003; Riffell
et al., 2009a), but single chemicals can also be attractive or
repellent (Haynes et al., 1991; Kessler and Baldwin, 2007;
Morgan and Lyon, 1928). In our study, we analyzed the activity
patterns evoked by these ecologically relevant floral and
vegetative odorants in the antennal lobe of female moths
and included additional odorants to cover a comprehensive
area of chemical space. We next tested the behavioral rele-
vance of the same odorants in a two-choice behavioral assay
(odorant versus solvent) to determine their innate meaning for
M. sexta.
By establishing a functional map of the antennal lobe using a
set of diagnostic odorants, we were then able to correlate the
odorant-evoked activation level of each glomerulus with the
observed valence of the same odorant. Previous studies have
given emphasis to a temporal coding mechanism of complex ol-
factory information by performing simultaneous recordings
from a mixture of local interneurons and projection neurons in
restricted areas of the antennal lobe (Riffell et al., 2009a; Riffell
et al., 2009b). Although calcium imaging does not inform us
about the temporal details of the neural responses, it provides
a view on the spatial representation of monomolecular odorants
across the full dorsal glomerular array at the sensory input level.
By this means, we were also able to draw conclusions about the
molecular receptive range of receptor neurons targeting these
glomeruli. Furthermore, we could identify glomeruli whose acti-
vation was correlated with feeding behavior, and we found
other glomeruli whose activation was correlated with oviposition
behavior.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Neural Representation of Odorants in the Brain of
M. sexta
We recorded in vivo neural activation patterns in the antennal
lobe of female moths that were stimulated with monomolecular
odorants. Eighty stimuli were chosen to represent a wide
range of ecologically relevant and chemically diverse odorants
(Table S1). Such activation patterns are odorant specific
and reproducible between animals (Bisch-Knaden et al., 2012).
However, we could not directly align activity spots to olfactory
glomeruli, because a thick neurolemma that prevents visible
glomeruli contours in the living animal covers the antennal lobe
in M. sexta (Figure 1A). To identify individual glomeruli and to
be able to describe the molecular receptive range of their inner-
vating olfactory sensory neurons, we chose odorants with a
characteristic activation pattern, one or two consistent activity
spots per diagnostic odorant (Figure 1B), and created a sche-
matic of putative olfactory glomeruli in the antennal lobe (Fig-
ure 1C). The position of each activity spot in this schematic
was defined by its position relative to other activity spots (Soucy
et al., 2009). With the help of 19 diagnostic odorants (Table S1),
we were able to identify 23 putative glomeruli that could consis-
tently be recognized in the antennal lobe of each individual. That
is, two-thirds of the glomeruli at the dorsal surface of the lobe
have been identified in our study. The remaining dorsal glomeruli
might be narrowly tuned to odorants that have not been tested
here, and therefore could not be addressed.
Animal preparations were stable enough to present the diag-
nostic odorants in each animal to create an individual glomerular
schematic and to test �20 additional odorants. There was a cor-
relation between the physicochemical properties of the 80 odor-
ants and their neural representations as has been shown for
vinegar flies, bees, tadpoles, and rats (Haddad et al., 2008):
the more similar two odorants are in chemical space, the more
similar was the representation of these two odorants in the
antennal lobe of M. sexta (r = 0.4, p < 0.0001, Mantel test). This
highly significant correlation let us assume that the identified
23 activity spots in the antennal lobe corresponded to 23 olfac-
tory glomeruli.
In 60.2% of the 1,840 odorant-glomerulus combinations, the
neural activation level was low (Figure 1D, blue cells in heatmap),
a medium response (cyan to orange cells) was found in 39.2% of
the cases, and a strong response (red cells) was observed in
0.6% of odorant-glomerulus combinations. Strongly responding
glomeruli were mainly located in the central part of the antennal
lobe, indicating that glomeruli close to the margins and at the

 entrance region of the antennal nerve were partly masked by
overlying glomeruli or the antennal nerve, respectively. Neural
representations of odorants were often more similar within a
chemical class than between chemical classes (Figure S1A). Ar-
omatics, for example, evoked significantly different activation
patterns than terpenes, corresponding to previous imaging
studies with small sets of odorants (Bisch-Knaden et al., 2012;
Hansson et al., 2003). Moreover, a hierarchical cluster analysis
revealed four functional groups of glomeruli (Figure S1B).
Glomeruli belonging to the same functional group were located
close to each other (Figure S1C). Thus, the neural representation
of odorants in the antennal lobe of M. sexta seems to be partially
chemotopic, which is consistent with findings in honeybees
(Sachse et al., 1999). However, a chemotopic representation
is still under debate in vinegar flies (Couto et al., 2005;
Hallem and Carlson, 2006) and mice (Soucy et al., 2009; Uchida
et al., 2000).
To further validate the assignment of glomeruli, we intended to
compare the observed glomerular response profiles with results
obtained by other electrophysiological methods. Yet, in M. sexta
females, there are only two glomeruli whose response character-
istics have previously been described via intracellular recordings
from uniglomerular output neurons: the female-specific lateral
large female glomerulus (LFG) (King et al., 2000) and one glomer-
ulus next to the lateral LFG (Reisenman et al., 2005). The latter
glomerulus is located deep in the antennal lobe and therefore
could not be accessed in our functional imaging study. The
lateral LFG, in contrast, can be addressed by its size and
because of its distinct location at the entrance of the antennal
nerve into the antennal lobe (Ro
¨ ssler et al., 1998). Output neu-
rons associated with the lateral LFG are mainly tuned to linalool,
with a higher response to (+)-linalool than to (�)-linalool (Reisen-
man et al., 2004). In our imaging study, glomerulus #2 was
located at a similar position in the lobe as the lateral LFG and
also responded more strongly to (+)-linalool than to (�)-linalool
(median response: 2.0 versus 1.2, n = 11 moths, p = 0.019, Wil-
coxon matched-pairs test). Furthermore, there was a good cor-
relation between the rank order of responses to eight odorants
from three chemical classes that were tested in both studies
(r = 0.86, p = 0.007, Pearson correlation). Hence, based on its
similar location and its characteristic response profile, glomer-
ulus #2 might coincide with the lateral LFG.
Sensory neurons that express the same type of olfactory re-
ceptor usually target the same glomerulus (Gao et al., 2000).
That is, the response spectrum of each olfactory sensory neuron
is correlated to the response spectrum of one of the olfactory
glomeruli in the antennal lobe. In extracellular recordings
from sensilla on the M. sexta antenna, however, it is difficult to
separate responses from collocated sensory neurons within a
sensillum (Kaissling et al., 1989; Spa
¨ the et al., 2013b). Still, olfac-
tory sensory neurons could be identified that responded mainly
to aromatics or terpenes or that were broadly tuned to odorants
from several chemical classes (Ghaninia et al., 2014; Shields and
Hildebrand, 2001). Accordingly, in the present imaging study,
we found glomeruli responding predominantly to aromatics
(e.g., #20), terpenes (e.g., #4), and also broadly tuned glomeruli
(e.g., #6). On the other hand, the receptive range of glomeruli #22
and #23 could not be related to any neuron or sensillum type
described in M. sexta (Ghaninia et al., 2014; Shields and Hilde-
brand, 2001; Spa
¨ the et al., 2013b). Up to now, single sensillum
recordings in M. sexta have only been done with trichoid and ba-
siconic sensilla, the most abundant and accessible types on the
antenna. There are, however, two more antennal sensillum types
with an olfactory function: auricillic and coeloconic sensilla
(Shields and Hildebrand, 1999a, 1999b). The response spectrum
of auricillic sensilla in other moth species is diverse, including
plant volatiles and sex pheromone components (Ansebo et al.,
2005; Pophof et al., 2005), and is therefore difficult to match
with our results. Neurons housed in coeloconic sensilla, in
contrast, are stereotypically tuned to acids, aldehydes, and
amines in moths (Pophof, 1997; Pophof et al., 2005), as well as
in other insect species like vinegar flies (Yao et al., 2005), drag-
onflies (Piersanti et al., 2014), and cockroaches (Altner et al.,
1977). Thus, glomeruli #22 and #23, which were activated by
acids, aldehydes, and, in the case of #22, also by an amine,
are presumably targeted by olfactory sensory neurons housed
in coeloconic sensilla. These mutual findings, together with the
correlation of neural representations of the odorants and their
physicochemical properties, support the validity of the glomeruli
identified in our study.
Testing the Valence of Odorants in Two-Choice
Experiments in the Wind Tunnel
Knowing the activity patterns odorants evoked in the antennal
lobe of the moths, we next addressed how these odorants might
affect the behavior of the animals in a wind tunnel (Figure 2A).
During the 3 min after taking flight, we recorded the duration of
contacts individual moths made at each of two targets: a filter
paper with the diluted test odorant and a filter paper with the sol-
vent only. We tested 20 moths per odorant and observed 12 ± 4
moths (mean ± SD) contacting at least one of the filter papers in
each of the 80 experimental series. Contacts were made either
with the tip of the unrolled proboscis (10 ± 4 moths/experimental
series), or with the tarsi (3 ± 4 moths/experimental series),
respectively. Both types of behavior occurred while the moth
was hovering in front of the upright filter paper. Subsets of fe-
males contacted the targets exclusively with their tarsi when
tested with a given odorant (22% ± 16% of the overall number
of contacts/experimental series) or showed both behaviors alter-
nately (16% ± 13%). Most frequently, however, moths made pro-
boscis contacts only (62% ± 20%).
Unrolling the proboscis and contacting a target indicates a
feeding attempt (i.e., the moth mistakes the filter paper for a
rewarding flower). To reveal the effect of a visual, unscented
stimulus, we provided both filter papers with solvent. In this
control experiment, 13 out of 20 moths contacted at least one
of the filter papers with their proboscis, showing that the visual
stimulus alone, a small white circular object, is sufficient to
attract foraging moths from a distance (Haverkamp et al.,
2016a). However, the median duration of those proboscis con-
tacts at an unscented target was only 1 s (Figure S2A). Adding
an attractive odorant to a visual stimulus extends the contact
duration (Raguso and Willis, 2002). Accordingly, we calculated
for each moth the net duration of proboscis contacts with the
odorant (contact duration at the odorant source minus contact
duration at the solvent control) as a measure of the odorant0s

Figure 2. Odor-Mediated Behavior of M. sexta
in a Two-Choice Experiment
(A) Schematic of the wind tunnel (2.5 m 3 0.9 m 3 0.9
m). Naive, starved, 3-day-old females were released
individually, and their behavior at two filter papers
(6 mL of diluted odorant [1:102 in solvent] versus 6 mL of
solvent) was recorded for 3 min after takeoff; n = 20
moths/odorant.
(B) Proboscis contacts. Box plots depict the median
net proboscis contact duration for each experimental
series (vertical line in the box) and the 25th and 75th
percentiles (left and right margins of the box) together
with minimum and maximum values (whiskers) (out-
liers not shown). Filled boxes, net contact durations
different from zero (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test).

 attractiveness (Figure 2B). Odorants were regarded attractive if
they had positive net contact durations significantly different
from zero.
Using this criterion, 41% of the tested odorants (33/80) had an
innate positive valence for foraging moths (Figure 2B, odorant
names underlined). The most attractive odorants were esters
and several aromatic odorants. The median net contact duration
at attractive odorants from these two chemical classes was 11 s.
Some of the ketones, nitrogenous compounds, and terpenes
were also attractive. However, these odorants evoked a median
net contact duration of only 4.5 s.
To compare our results obtained with monomolecular odor-
ants with the behavior a moth would show when confronted
with a more natural (i.e., complex) olfactory stimulus, we tested
behaviorally active subsets of the complete flower scents of
two important nectar sources: D. wrightii (three components;
90% benzyl alcohol) and A. palmeri (six components; 91% ethyl
sorbate). It has been shown that foraging M. sexta do not
discriminate between these reduced blends and the respective
full flower bouquets, which contain more than 60 components
each (Riffell et al., 2009a). In our wind tunnel assay, both flower
mimics were attractive for female moths. Notably, there was
no difference in attractiveness between a flower mimic and its
major component (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the observed con-
tact duration at filter papers scented with these attractive odor-
ants corresponds to the probing time of M. sexta at real flowers
(Haverkamp et al., 2016b; Riffell et al., 2008). Taken together,
these findings indicate that hungry moths evaluate single odor-
ants as promising as a complete flower bouquet.
Consistent with this result, monomolecular odorants were
described to attract both sexes of numerous moth species
belonging mainly to the noctuid family (Do
¨ tterl et al., 2006; Hay-
nes et al., 1991; Landolt et al., 2014; Meagher, 2001), but also
hawkmoths, including M. sexta, are strongly attracted by single
compounds in laboratory and field studies (Kessler and Baldwin,
2007; Morgan and Lyon, 1928; Scott and Milam, 1943). Male
M. sexta, in contrast to our findings with females, were not at-
tracted by single odorants but only by odorant mixtures when
tested in a wind tunnel (Riffell et al., 2009a). This differing obser-
vation might be based on methodical constraints or depicts
another example of sex specificity in hawkmoth foraging strate-
gies (Alarcon et al., 2010; White et al., 1994).
The most attractive chemicals in our behavioral tests were
aliphatic esters. These compounds (e.g., ethyl sorbate and butyl
butyrate) are rare floral volatiles (Knudsen et al., 2006) and are not
present in typical hawkmoth-pollinated flowers like Datura and
Nicotiana (Knudsen and Tollsten, 1993). Esters, however, are
characteristic for Agave flowers (Riffell et al., 2008), which offer
a prolonged and nectar-rich resource in the semi-arid grassland
habitat of M. sexta in southern Arizona (US). There, Agave pollen
was the most abundant proboscis pollen load of wild male and fe-
male M. sexta across different years, showing that moths heavily
exploit these flowers (Alarcon et al., 2008; Riffell et al., 2013).
Furthermore, two-choice experiments in the laboratory revealed
that this attraction to Agave is innate, as more than 90% of naive
moths preferred paper flowers emitting the floral scent of
A. palmeri to unscented paper flowers (Riffell et al., 2008), which
is in line with our results using ester-scented filter papers.
Long proboscis contacts also occurred in tests with aromatic
compounds like benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetone, and methyl ben-
zoate, as well as with nitrogenous aldoximes. These odorants
are signature chemicals for the scent of many hawkmoth-polli-
nated flowers (Knudsen and Tollsten, 1993), making them
obvious candidates for attractive stimuli. Like the scent of Agave,
the scent of Datura is innately attractive for foraging M. sexta (Rif-
fell et al., 2008). However, not every floral volatile proved to be
attractive, which was especially apparent in the case of ter-
penes. Although two-thirds of the most common floral volatiles
belong to this chemical class (Knudsen et al., 2006), moths
were significantly attracted by only 5 out of 18 tested single
terpene compounds with much shorter proboscis contacts
than in experiments with esters or aromatics. A higher impact
of aromatics compared with terpenes was also reported for but-
terflies, as none of 14 tested terpenes but 8 out of 16 aromatic
compounds elicited strong proboscis extension reflexes across
all three investigated nymphalid species (^
Omura and Honda,
2009). Terpenes might, however, be important constituents of
attractive floral mixtures (Riffell et al., 2009a) considering the
robust activity some of the terpenes evoked in the antennal
lobe of M. sexta (Figure 1D).
In experiments with 17 odorants (some acids, alcohols, alde-
hydes, and aromatics), moths spent slightly more time at the
control target than at the scented target. However, none of the
odorants had a negative median net contact duration that was
significantly different from zero (i.e., none of the tested odorants
could be classified as aversive). This result indicates that our
behavioral paradigm allowed the identification of attractive odor-
ants but was not suitable for the detection of repellent odorants,
as the baseline set by the control target was too low (Figure S2A).
Odorants Eliciting Oviposition Behavior
Whenever moths made tarsal contacts with the filter paper, they
kept their proboscis rolled up, indicating that the moths did not
try to feed. This behavior, therefore, has to be seen in a different
context. In the control experiment with two unscented filter pa-
pers, 6 out of 20 moths contacted at least one of the targets
with their tarsi. Thus, the visual stimulus alone could evoke tarsal
contacts, but with a lower frequency than proboscis contacts
(13/20 moths). Furthermore, tarsal contacts occurred in experi-
ments with almost all odorants at least once, but were less
frequently observed than proboscis contacts (4 ± 3 moths with
tarsal contacts/experimental series versus 10 ± 4 moths with
proboscis contacts/experimental series). Usually, moths had a
straight abdomen while grabbing the filter paper with their
tarsi. However, some moths markedly curled their abdomen
(Figure 2C, odorant names marked with +), most of them
solely at the odorant side. Tarsal contacts with a curled abdomen
lasted much longer than tarsal contacts with a straight abdomen
(median net duration/experimental series: 13 s versus 1 s,
p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). Curling of the abdomen usu-
ally precedes oviposition, but virgin moths as well show this
behavior whenever they are able to contact the leaves of a suit-
able host plant (Mechaber et al., 2002). In our behavioral assay,
several of the moths, although virgin, even laid eggs at the
scented target (Figure 2, odorant names marked with �). We
therefore assume that the observed behavior was related to
Cell Reports 22, 2482–2492, February 27, 2018
2487
 oviposition. Abdomen curling at the scented filter paper did
not occur randomly across odorants but was observed only in
experiments with odorants belonging to three chemical classes
(aromatics, ketones, and nitrogenous compounds), indicating
that these monomolecular compounds are innately associated
with oviposition.
Some plant species are used as a nectar source and others
as an egg-laying substrate by female moths (Gabel, 1992) or
butterflies (Stanton, 1984). Because post-mating nectar feeding
doubles the number of fertile eggs in hawkmoths (Schmidt-
Busser et al., 2011), plants that simultaneously provide floral
nectar and an appropriate oviposition substrate, like Datura
or Nicotiana, are especially beneficial (Alarcon et al., 2010)
and might emit volatiles that are innately attractive in both con-
texts. Accordingly, we found that key odorants of Datura and
Nicotiana (aromatics and aldoximes) were attractive feeding
cues and that 6 out of 13 attractive aromatics and aldoximes
also evoked abdomen curling, emphasizing the significance
of these odorants in the behavioral ecology of M. sexta. Agave
flowers, on the other hand, are an even more rewarding nectar
source than Datura flowers (Riffell et al., 2008), yet hawkmoths
do not oviposit on Agave plants (Alarcon et al., 2008). Conse-
quently, Agave-specific esters were very attractive feeding
cues, but abdomen curling never occurred at ester-scented fil-
ter papers. A similar although reversed phenomenon has been
described in the vinegar fly: a repulsive feeding cue is preferred
by female flies for oviposition (Joseph et al., 2009). The odor-
ants that elicited abdomen curling were not as effective
as shown for the complete host plant bouquet (Mechaber
et al., 2002) because abdomen curling occurred only at low
frequencies (maximal, 30%). In line with this finding, a recent
study showed that the unaltered bouquet of a host plant is
required for the choice of oviposition sites in M. sexta (Spa
¨ the
et al., 2013a), indicating that oviposition, in contrast to foraging,
might depend more on complex
blends than on single
compounds.
Linking Brain Activity to Odor-Directed Behavior
Moths showed clear odor-guided behavior when tested with
monomolecular odorants in the wind tunnel and contacted a
scented filter paper with proboscis or with tarsi and a curled
abdomen. Although a small subset of attractive feeding odorants
also elicited abdomen curling, most odorants were effective in
only one behavioral context. Therefore, feeding-related and
oviposition-related behaviors might be represented in different
subsets of glomeruli in the antennal lobe. We first tested this
hypothesis by comparing odor-evoked activation levels of indi-
vidual glomeruli (Figure 1D) with the median net duration of pro-
boscis contacts moths made at the same odorants (Figure 2B).
In most of the cases, there was no correlation between the two
datasets. For four glomeruli, however, we found a highly signifi-
cant positive correlation; that is, the more these glomeruli were
activated, the longer the moth contacted a scented filter paper
with its proboscis (Figure 3A). Three of these ‘‘feeding glomeruli’’
were located at the entrance and the lateral region of the
antennal lobe, and the fourth glomerulus was in a more medial
position (Figure 3B). Next, we examined the coding of oviposition
behavior, and found that the activation levels of six glomeruli
were positively correlated with the median net duration of
abdomen curling contacts (Figure 3C). These ‘‘oviposition
glomeruli’’ were mostly located in medial parts of the antennal
lobe (Figure 3D). Strikingly, we found only glomeruli whose activ-
ity was significantly correlated with feeding or with oviposition,
but never with both behaviors. Moreover, we found this link be-
tween brain activity patterns and behavior, although we moni-
tored only 33% of all glomeruli present in the antennal lobe of
M. sexta, which is in line with studies in honeybees (24% of all
glomeruli; Guerrieri et al., 2005) or vinegar flies (38%; Knaden
et al., 2012).
Studies dealing with the coding of olfactory valence in in-
sects are usually based on the comparison of attractive and
aversive feeding cues (Knaden et al., 2012; Kreher et al.,
2008). Our study revealed that another essential behavior,
oviposition, could also be correlated to the activation of a
distinct group of olfactory glomeruli. The lateral LFG and neigh-
boring glomeruli have been suggested to be involved in the
detection of oviposition sites in M. sexta (King et al., 2000;
Reisenman et al., 2004), whereas another study using single
sensillum recordings with subsequent retrograde staining in
female cabbage looper moths (Todd and Baker, 1996) sug-
gested that this region of the antennal lobe processes attractive
feeding odorants. In line with the latter findings, our results
favor a role of glomeruli located in the entrance area of the
antennal lobe in feeding but not in oviposition behaviors
(Figure 3).
In vinegar flies, a segregated representation of attractive and
repellent foraging odorants exists (Knaden et al., 2012). Different
from our findings in moths, the medial part of the fly’s antennal
lobe codes for attractive foraging odorants, whereas the lateral
part processes aversive olfactory stimuli. Thus, the position of
glomeruli responding to positive feeding cues seems not to be
conserved in insects. Furthermore, the representation of olfac-
tory valence in flies is weak at the level of olfactory sensory neu-
rons and becomes significant only at the level of output neurons
(Knaden et al., 2012) in contrast to our results in M. sexta, as we
monitored mainly the activity of input neurons. However, repre-
sentation of behavioral meaning already at the first olfactory pro-
cessing level is not restricted to insects but was found also in
mice, where, like in M. sexta, olfactory valence was already
coded at the input level of the olfactory glomeruli (Kobayakawa
et al., 2007).
Our study provides two comprehensive resources: a func-
tional atlas of an insect’s antennal lobe based on calcium imag-
ing experiments with 80 odorants and the innate behavioral
significance of each of these odorants. Furthermore, we found
two distinct sets of glomeruli whose activation levels were either
correlated with feeding or with oviposition behavior.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Study Species
M. sexta (Sphingidae) larvae were reared in the laboratory on an artificial diet
(Grosse-Wilde et al., 2011). Female pupae were kept in a climate chamber
(25�C, 70% relative humidity [RH]) with a reversed light cycle (8 hr dark:
16 hr light), and moths were tested up to 3 days after hatching (calcium imaging
experiments) or at day 3 after hatching (wind tunnel experiments), respectively.
Moths were starved, virgin, and had no experience with plant-derived volatiles.
2488
Cell Reports 22, 2482–2492, February 27, 2018
 Preparation for Calcium Imaging Experiments
Moths were pushed in a 15-mL plastic tube with the tip cut open. The head was
protruding at the narrow end and was fixed in this position with dental wax.
Labial palps and proboscis were also fixed with wax to reduce movement ar-
tifacts during the experiments. A window was cut in the head capsule between
the compound eyes, and the tissue covering the brain was removed until the
antennal lobes were visible. The membrane-permeant form of a fluorescent
calcium indicator (Calcium Green-1 AM, Invitrogen) was dissolved in physio-
logical saline solution (Christensen and Hildebrand, 1987) with 6% Pluronic
F-127 (Invitrogen) to a concentration of 30 mmol. Twenty mL of this dye solution
was applied to the exposed brain, and the preparation was incubated in a wet
chamber for 45 min at room temperature. Then, the brain was rinsed several
times with physiological saline solution to remove excess dye, and the moths
were stored at 4�C overnight. Imaging experiments were performed the
following day.
Calcium Imaging
The imaging setup consisted of a CCD camera (Olympus U-CMAD3) mounted
to an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI) equipped with a water immersion
objective (Olympus, 103/0.30). Calcium green-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) was
excited at 475 nm (500 nm shortpass (SP) optical filter; xenon arc lamp, Poly-
chrome V, Till Photonics), and fluorescence was detected at 490/515 nm
(dichroic longpass/longpass [DCLP/LP]). The set-up was controlled by the
software Tillvision version 4.6 (Till Photonics). Four-fold symmetrical binning
resulted in image sizes of 344 3 260 pixels,with one pixel corresponding to
an area of 4 mm 3 4 mm.
Odorant Stimulation
We tested 80 monomolecular odorants (Table S1). Six microliters of the diluted
odorants were applied onto a circular piece of filter paper (diameter: 12 mm,
Whatman); 6 ml of solvent served as a control stimulus. Filter papers were in-
serted into glass pipettes and were renewed every day. The immobilized
moth was placed upright under the microscope. A glass tube was directed
to one antenna (diameter: 5 mm; ending 10–15 mm from the tip of the antenna)
to deliver a constant stream of clean, moistened air (0.1 l/min). Two glass pi-
pettes were inserted through small holes in the tube. One pipette (inserted
5.5 cm from end of tube) was empty and added clean air to the continuous
airstream (0.5 L/min). This airstream could automatically be switched (Syntech
Stimulus Controller CS-55) to the second pipette (inserted 3.5 cm from the end
of tube) that contained an odorant-laden filter paper. By this procedure, the
airstream reaching the antenna was not altered during odorant stimulation,
thus reducing mechanical disturbances.
One odorant stimulation experiment lasted 10 s and was recorded with a
sampling rate of 4 Hz corresponding to 40 frames. The time course of
an odorant stimulation experiment was as follows: 2-s clean airstream
(frame 1–8), 2-s odorant airstream (frame 9–16), and 6-s clean airstream
(frame 17–40). Odorants were presented with at least 1-min interstimulus inter-
val to avoid adaptation. Nineteen diagnostic odorants (Table S1) were tested in
each animal plus �20 other odorants. The sequence of stimulations changed
from animal to animal. Stimulations with the solvent were presented at the
beginning, in the middle, and at the end of an experimental series.
Processing of Calcium Imaging Data
Stimulation experiments resulted in a series of 40 consecutive frames that
were analyzed with custom written software (IDL, ITT Visual Informations So-
lutions). Several processing steps were applied to enhance the signal-to-noise
ratio: (1) background correction: background activity was defined as the
average fluorescence (F) of frames 3–7 (i.e., before stimulus onset) and was
subtracted from the fluorescence of each frame. This background-corrected
value (deltaF) was divided by the background fluorescence to get the relative
changes of fluorescence over background fluorescence for each frame
(deltaF/F); (2) bleaching correction: the fluorescent bleached slowly during
the exposure to light, and therefore, we subtracted from each frame an expo-
nential decay curve that was estimated from the bleaching course of frame 3–7
and frame 26–40 (i.e., just before and after stimulus and response); (3) median
filtering: a spatial median filter with a width of 7 pixels was applied to remove
outliers; and (4) movement correction: possible shifts of the antennal lobe from
one stimulation experiment to the next one were corrected by aligning frame
20 of each experiment to frame 20 of the median experiment in a given animal.
The outline of the antennal lobe and remains of tracheae served as guides for
this movement correction procedure.
Increased neural activity, indicated as an increase of the intracellular cal-
cium concentration on odorant stimulation, was leading to spatially restricted
spots of increased fluorescence in the antennal lobe. In the center of each

 activity spot, the average deltaF/F was recorded in an area the size of a small to
medium-sized glomerulus (60 mm 3 60 mm). Time traces of deltaF/F were aver-
aged over three successive frames for each activity spot. In these smoothed
time traces, the maximum deltaF/F after stimulus onset was determined.
The average of the maximum value and the value before and after the
maximum was calculated and was defined as the response of the animal to
the odorant stimulation at the given activity spot.
Analysis of Activity Patterns in the Antennal Lobe
For each animal, an individual schematic of activity spots (Figure 1C) was es-
tablished by analyzing the activation patterns evoked by diagnostic odorants,
leading to 23 spots that could consistently be identified. Responses in these 23
putative glomeruli were calculated for all stimulations in a given animal, and the
average responses evoked by the solvent stimulations were subtracted. In this
way, the median net response evoked by an odorant in each glomerulus could
be calculated across different animals (Figure 1D). The median sample size
was n = 15 moths per odorant; n = 66 animals were tested in total.
Behavioral Experiments in the Wind Tunnel
To investigate the behavioral significance of odorants, we performed two-
choice tests in a wind tunnel (Figure 2A; 2.5 m 3 0.9 3 0.9 m, 25�C, 70%
RH, 0.3 lux, wind speed: 40 cm/s). Before the experiment, individual moths
were transferred in cylindrical mesh cages (13 cm 3 14 cm) from their rearing
chamber to an acclimatization chamber (25�C, 70% RH, 0.3 lux), where they
stayed for at least 1 hr. At the upwind end of the wind tunnel, two upright acrylic
glass poles (40 cm high) were placed with a distance of 40 cm between them.
A round filter paper (diameter: 35 mm) was fixed at the top of each pole, with
6 mL of diluted odorant (1:102) or solvent alone pipetted to the center of each
filter. To control for the effect of a visual cue alone, both filter papers were pro-
vided with 6 mL of solvent. An individual female was put on a platform
(40 cm high) at the downwind end of the tunnel where it started to fan its wings
for 1–2 min before taking off. Moths were allowed to fly in the wind tunnel for
3 min, and their behavior close to the two filter papers was filmed (Sony Han-
dycam DCR-SR35E, night shot mode). We analyzed the duration and type of
contacts (Figure 2) displayed at the targets. Moths were tested only once
(n = 20 moths/odorant, n = 1660 moths in total). Filter papers were renewed
for each trial, and the positions of odorant and solvent were swapped after
every second moth.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical tests were performed with PAST (Paleontological Statistics, http://
folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/), Instat (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, US)
and XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, NY, US) at a significance level of a = 0.05.
