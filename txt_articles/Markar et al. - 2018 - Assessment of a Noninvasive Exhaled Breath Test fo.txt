IMPORTANCE Early esophagogastric cancer (OGC) stage presents with nonspecific
symptoms.
OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of a breath test for the
diagnosis of OGC in a multicenter validation study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patient recruitment for this diagnostic validation study
was conducted at 3 London hospital sites, with breath samples returned to a central
laboratory for selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) analysis. Based on a 1:1
cancer:control ratio, and maintaining a sensitivity and specificity of 80%, the sample size
required was 325 patients. All patients with cancer were on a curative treatment pathway,
and patients were recruited consecutively. Among the 335 patients included; 172 were in the
control group and 163 had OGC.
INTERVENTIONS Breath samples were collected using secure 500-mL steel breath bags and
analyzed by SIFT-MS. Quality assurance measures included sampling room air, training all
researchers in breath sampling, regular instrument calibration, and unambiguous volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) identification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of cancer was identified based on a previously
generated 5-VOCs model and compared with histopathology-proven diagnosis.
RESULTS Patients in the OGC group were older (median [IQR] age 68 [60-75] vs 55 [41-69]
years) and had a greater proportion of men (134 [82.2%]) vs women (81 [47.4%]) compared
with the control group. Of the 163 patients with OGC, 123 (69%) had tumor stage T3/4, and
106 (65%) had nodal metastasis on clinical staging. The predictive probabilities generated by
this 5-VOCs diagnostic model were used to generate a receiver operator characteristic curve,
with good diagnostic accuracy, area under the curve of 0.85. This translated to a sensitivity of
80% and specificity of 81% for the diagnosis of OGC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study shows the potential of breath analysis in
noninvasive diagnosis of OGC in the clinical setting. The next step is to establish the
diagnostic accuracy of the test among the intended population in primary care where the test
will be applied.

n the United Kingdom, upper gastrointestinal symptoms
account for at least 3% of consultations in primary care.1
The national esophagogastric cancer (OGC) audit re-
ported 7044 cases of OGC diagnosed in 2016. Many patients
presentwithadvanced-stagediseaseandonly38%ofcasescan
be treated with a curative intent.2 Current UK referral guide-
lines for suspected OGC focus on alarm symptoms such as dys-
phagia and odynophagia, despite these symptoms having poor
sensitivity and specificity for OGC and often only occur in ad-
vanced disease translating into a poor outcome and overall
survival.3 There is a wide range in the rate of oesophagogas-
tro duodenoscopy (OGD) among general practice popula-
tions in England and OGC patients belonging to practices with
the lowest rates of OGD referral are at greatest risk of poor over-
all survival owing to advanced tumor stage at diagnosis.4 Fur-
thermore, OGD is an expensive invasive investigation, with
poor uptake in specific ethic minority populations conse-
quently affecting survival.5 This high prevalence of upper gas-
trointestinal symptoms coupled with the low incidence of OGC
and the nonspecific nature of symptoms in early disease high-
light the need for a triage test to direct patients to have OGD.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the hu-
man body have been of interest to researchers for several
decades,6withassociationspreviouslysuggestedbetweenspe-
cific VOCs and breath and lung, bladder, and breast cancers.7-9
We analyzed exhaled breath samples using selected ion flow-
tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) from 210 patients, 81 with
OGC and 129 control patients. A diagnostic model of 13 VOCs
was able to diagnose OGC with a sensitivity of 89% and speci-
ficity of 94%.10 Several phase 1 biomarker studies linking non-
invasively measured VOCs to the presence of cancer similar to
our own have been published,7-9,11-13 with very few attempts
to externally validate these findings in a further prospective
cohort of patients from several centers.
The objective of this multicenter validation study was to
establish the diagnostic accuracy of a previously identified set
ofbreathVOCsdysregulatedwiththepresenceofOGCinamul-
ticenter setting.
Methods
Multivariable logistic regression model (stepwise regression)
(eMethods 1 in the Supplement) was used to create a 5-VOCs
model which were butyric acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid,
butanal, and decanal from our previously published data set.10
The predictive probabilities generated by this 5-VOC diagnos-
tic model were then used to generate an receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, which showed a good diagnostic
accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.90 (SD, 0.02).
Based on 50% of patients in the study population having
cancer (1 patient with a benign abnormality was recruited to 1
patient with cancer) and maintaining a sensitivity and speci-
ficity of 80% for the diagnostic model derived from our pre-
vious research, the sample size estimated for the multicenter
external validation study was 325 patients; 162 patients with
esophageal or gastric cancer and 163 patients with benign con-
ditions or a normal upper gastrointestinal tract.
Breathsamplesweretakenfrom3hospitals(StMary’
sHos-
pital Imperial College London, University College London Hos-
pital, and The Royal Marsden Hospital) and transported to St
Mary’
s VOC laboratory for SIFT-MS analysis. The National
Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority (NRES Com-
mitteeLondon–CamdenandIslington)approvedthestudy,and
written informed consent was obtained.
Thefullprotocolforthisstudywaspreviouslypublished.14
The study was reported according to STARD 2015 (Standards
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) guidelines
(eMethods2intheSupplement).15Thetrialwasregisteredwith
the National Health Service, Health Research Authority
Patients18yearsorolderwithuppergastrointestinalsymp-
toms attending for endoscopy or surgery were eligible. In the
cancer cohort only patients with histologically confirmed non-
metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) were
included. All patients in the cancer cohort were sampled when
they were neoadjuvant naive.
Patients who had a documented active infection, were un-
able to provide informed consent, or unable to provide a
500-mL breath sample were excluded. Patients with Barrett
esophagus were excluded from the control group (this is a pre-
malignant condition worthy of independent investigation).
Breath Sampling Methodology
After informed consent was obtained from all patients, we fol-
lowed the sampling protocol used in our previous clinical
studies,10 which was informed by our investigations on the in-
fluenceofbreathmaneuversandhospitalenvironmentonVOC
measurements.16,17 Patients fasted for a minimum of 4 hours
prior to their breath sample collection. Patients rested in the
same area for at least 20 minutes prior to exhaled breath col-
lection and all samples were obtained immediately prior to en-
doscopy or surgery. Patients were asked to perform a single
deepnasalinhalationfollowedbycompleteexhalationviatheir
mouth into secure 500-mL steel breath bag (GastroCHECK) via
a 1-mL Luer lok syringe (Terumo Europe, Leuven, Belgium).
Patients in the cancer and control groups were recruited con-
secutively. The research team were aware of clinical diagno-
sis when breath sampling the patients, however the clinical
team performing the OGD or surgery were blind to the results
of the breath analysis.
For each VOC measurement, the syringe plunger was re-
moved from the 1-mL Luer lok syringe and the steel breath bag
was directly connected via the syringe barrel to the sample in-
let arm of the SIFT-MS instrument. For the multi-ion moni-
toring mode, selective VOCs from breath were analyzed for a

 total of 60 seconds and measured concentrations were aver-
aged over this time for each VOC.
SIFT-MS permits online, real-time VOC quantification.18,19
It has been used in the study of VOCs in breath and urine from
patients with conditions including cystic fibrosis and bladder
cancer.20,21 The SIFT-MS instrument allows real-time detec-
tion and quantification of VOCs in biological samples such as
exhaled breath without sample preparation.22 We have pre-
viously confirmed the reproducibility of VOCs measure-
ments using SIFT-MS.23 A panel of 30 VOCs including the 5
VOCs forming our diagnostic model were analyzed for each
breath sample, as previously described.10
Clinical Data
A detailed medical proforma was completed by the consent-
ing clinician or research fellow using information provided by
the patient as well as clinical investigations. These data in-
cluded patient demographics, tumor characteristics, comor-
bidities, medications, and lifestyle measures. Diagnostic en-
doscopy and/or operative findings were recorded for each
patient.
Histopathologic examination of tissues obtained via en-
doscopyorfromsurgicallyresectedspecimenswascarriedout.
The reference test was considered positive on OGC histopatho-
logic diagnosis.
SIFT-MS instrument was calibrated daily to 6% water in
human exhaled breath. All breath samples were tested using
SIFT-MS to ensure that percentage water from the exhaled
breath sample in the bag was between 5% and 7%. If this was
not the case the sample was discarded because it was likely
to be unreliable and representative of bag malfunction. All
samples were analyzed within 4 hours of collection. Our meth-
odological studies demonstrated the stability of trace VOCs up
to 48 hours from the time of patient sampling when using the
GastroCHECK steel breath bag (eMethods 3 in the Supple-
ment). Weekly samples were taken from the ambient room air
at the participating hospitals where patients were being breath
sampled and also from the laboratory air from where samples
were analyzed. This was to ensure that there was no contami-
nation from the ambient room air causing anomalous results,
which could represent an important confounding factor
(eMethods 4 in the Supplement). Breath sampling methodol-
ogy was standardized. We performed human factors analy-
sis, which demonstrated several potential sources of error in
breath sampling that can affect the results of the analysis.
Therefore, all clinicians and researchers participating in this
study underwent a thorough credentialing process involving
observation of consent, performing breath sampling, and stor-
age of samples prior to participating in the study (eMethods 5
in the Supplement). Threshold of detection of SIFT-MS analy-
sis was defined as 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv), based
on previously performed statistical modeling (eMethods 6 in
the Supplement).
To confirm the identified VOCs obtained in the exhaled
breath using SIFT-MS; we conducted cross-platform valida-
tion with Gas chromatography mass spectrometry ([GC-MS]
considered the gold standard for compound identification ow-
ing to the use of chromatographic separation). Exhaled breath
was collected using the same method from 20 patients. The
VOCcontentfromeachGastroCHECKbagwastransferredusing
an air-sampling pocket pump (SKC 210-1002 series) at 50 mL/
min onto inert coated stainless steel Tenax/Carbograph-5TD
sorbent tubes (Markes International Ltd, Llantrisant) prior to
GC-MS analysis (eMethods 7 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of predicted cancer risk and actual OGD findings
orhistologyfromendoscopicbiopsies(referencestandardtest)
was then made, and the overall diagnostic accuracy (sensitiv-
ity, specificity, and ROC analysis) for this noninvasive diag-
nostic investigation was determined. A similar ROC analysis
was performed based on predicted cancer risk from clinical
parameters defined by National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) criteria.3 Potential confounding factors
across the study groups were evaluated by employing the
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and χ2 test for dis-
crete variables. Linear regression models were used to assess
any influence of patient demographic factors, or medica-
tions, on VOC concentrations measured. P < .05 was used to
assign statistical significance. All statistical analysis was per-
formed using the statistical software SPSS (version 22, IBM).
Results
Only 1 invited patient declined to participate in the study with
a patient acceptability rate of 99.7% to undertake and com-
plete the test. No adverse events were observed during breath
sampling.
Patient Demographics and Tumor Factors
After necessary exclusions owing to sample quality, defined
as inadequate percentage of water (n = 20), 335 patients in
total were included; 172 patients in the control group and
163 patients with esophageal or gastric cancer. In the control
group, 89 (51.7%) patients had a normal upper gastrointesti-
nal tract on endoscopy or only the presence of a hiatal her-
nia. The most common diagnoses among the remaining par-
ticipants in the control group were esophagitis, gastritis, or
duodenitis with or without erosions in 59 (34.3%) patients,
followed by the presence of benign gastric polyps in 12
(7.0%) patients and achalasia or esophageal stricture in 11
(6.4%) patients.
In the cancer group there were significant increases in pa-
tient age, proportion of male and white patients, ex-smokers,
ASA grade 3, and hypertensive patients, with a reduced pro-
portion of patients with liver impairment (Table 1). There were
also significant increases in the use of statin, β-blocker, and
ACE-inhibitor medications in the cancer group (Table 1). Dys-
phagia, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding were in-
creased, and abdominal pain reduced, as presenting symp-
toms in the cancer group (eMethods 8 in the Supplement).
Furthermore, the breakdown of the cancer-specific factors in-
cluding stage and tumor location is provided in Table 2 with
72 (44.2%) of tumors being gastric in origin, 123 (69.3%) being
T3 or T4, and 106 (65%) being nodal positive.

 Cross-Platform GC-MS Validation
In conjunction with SIFT-MS analysis, TD-GC-MS analysis was
applied to breath from the same cohort of patients (n = 20) to
cross-validate the identity of measured VOCs. eMethods 9 in
the Supplement summarizes the VOC identification by GC-MS
via mass spectrum (MS) matching of detected compounds to
the commercial NIST library, as well as their calculated reten-
tion indices (RI) to those of authentic chemical standards un-
dergone separation on the ZB-624 column. Overall, the pres-
ence of 30 VOCs was confirmed except for pentanol owing to
itslimitedlevelofsignal-to-noiseratio(SNR<5)amongtheana-
lyzed samples.
SIFT-MS Analysis and VOC-Based OGC Diagnosis
The concentration of butyric acid, hexanoic acid, butanal, and
decanalshowedsignificantdifferencesbetweenthecancerand
control groups (eMethods 10 in the Supplement). Five VOCs
were then taken forward to form a risk-prediction model for
thediagnosisofesophagogastriccancer,andincludedinamul-
tivariable logistic regression analysis with cancer diagnosis as
the dependent variable (eMethods 10 in the Supplement). To
ensure these factors were not associated with a confounding
demographic variable or presenting symptom that differed be-
tween the comparison groups, linear regression models were
performed for each of the 5 VOCs (eMethods 10 in the Supple-
ment). There were no significant differences in the concen-
tration of these 5 VOCs between patients with esophageal or
gastric cancer (eMethods 10 in the Supplement).
The predictive probabilities generated by this 5-VOC di-
agnostic model were then used to generate an ROC curve,
which showed a good diagnostic accuracy with an area under
the curve of 0.85 (SD, 0.02) (Figure). This translated to a sen-
sitivity of 80% and specificity of 81% for the diagnosis of
esophagogastric cancer. This compared with the diagnostic ac-
curacy generated by a clinical parameters test based on NICE
guidelines for endoscopy referral,3 which had an area under
the curve of 0.73 (SD, 0.03), sensitivity of 59%, and specific-
ity of 81% (eMethods 11 in the Supplement).

 Discussion
This multicenter study demonstrated a sensitivity of 80% and
specificity of 81% of a single breath test in the diagnosis of
esophagogastric cancer, thus validating the 5-VOC breath
model. All patients with cancer included in the study were re-
ceiving a curative treatment pathway, highlighting the poten-
tial value of the test in detecting operable disease and the po-
tential impact on survival. The sensitivity of 80% compares
favorablytotheexistingtechnologiessuchasfecaloccultblood
test(sensitivityrangingfrom30%-70%)forcolorectalcancer,24
and more specifically to upper gastrointestinal disease, the cy-
tosponge (sensitivity 73%) for Barrett esophagus.25 An impor-
tant finding with both these technologies was an increase in
sensitivity associated with multiple episodes of testing,
which could be an important area for further research of
breath testing.
At present the NICE guidance for endoscopy referral is
based on age threshold and symptom criteria. Patients aged
over 55 years with dyspepsia, or those of any age with alarm-
type symptoms are considered eligible for direct referral for
endoscopy and assessment of the upper gastrointestinal tract.3
Despite these guidelines a huge degree of variability remains
in referral patterns for endoscopy.4 The breath test for esopha-
gogastric cancer aims to provide clinicians with an objective
assessment of need for endoscopic referral. Given the asso-
ciation of all 5 VOCs with esophagogastric cancer, this may in
the future allow for calculation of stratified risk for indi-
vidual patients, which would require an independent large-
scale study to fully validate. The consensus of key stakehold-
ers in a decision workshop was to locate breath testing in
primary care to triage patients with nonspecific symptoms to
have endoscopy based on risk of OGC (eMethods 12 in
Supplement2).Thisviewhasbeenendorsedbyourrecentfind-
ing that the diagnostic model for OGC is different from that for
colorectal cancer,26 providing the concept for a single breath
test for multiple gastrointestinal cancers. If a clinician is pre-
sented with a patient with gastrointestinal symptoms that do
not prompt referral based on NICE criteria, he/she would not
need to watch and wait to see if symptoms worsen but could
offer the exhaled breath test immediately. The clinician would
orderabreathtestinmuchthesamewayasroutinebloodtests.
A nurse can perform the test and send breath samples to a re-
gional laboratory for analysis. A positive result would war-
rant immediate referral for endoscopy. A negative test would
permit the clinician to reassure the patient and offer retesting
if symptoms persist. Because endoscopy is an expensive
investigation,1 with a low diagnostic yield of 2% to 5%,2 a tri-
age breath test prior to endoscopy could substantially reduce
the number of negative endoscopies and increase the cancer
yield making the diagnostic pathway more effective with im-
proved patient experience. Avoiding unnecessary investiga-
tions would also free up resources in the NHS. Concerns re-
garding clinical application of breath sampling and transport
have led to the development of thermal desorption tubes,
which allow breath samples to be stored for up to 1.5 months
and transported between sites.27,28 These tubes can be used
multiple times after cleaning and potentially for multiple dis-
eases using the same analytical platform, which may serve to
further lower the cost of a breath test.
The mechanism of production of these VOCs in the can-
cer state may involve changes at a genetic and cellular level
causing metabolic alterations in enzymatic pathways. Alde-
hydes have generated much research interest given their link
as a possible carcinogen and also their elevation in other types
of cancers.28 Genetic dysregulation of aldehyde metabolism
is present in patients with esophageal cancer.29,30 Lipid per-
oxidation flux may provide a link between inflammation, al-
dehydes, and cancer.12,31 Gastric microbiome associated with
cancer may also be a contributing factor to the production of
VOCs, yet to be defined.32,33
Limitations
There are limitations associated with this study that must be
considered in the interpretation of the findings. Although

agnostic test currently available. Furthermore, most patients
presented in the current study have T3 esophagogastric can-
cer, in line with disease patterns in the UK. Therefore the di-
agnostic accuracy of the test to identify early stage (T1) can-
cer remains undetermined by the current study. It must be
acknowledged that given a current sensitivity of 80% there is
still potential for further refinement of exhaled breath test-
ing and thereby improvements in cancer detection rates; a suc-
cessful evolution observed in other triage investigations such
as stool DNA testing for colorectal cancer.36,37 Further inves-
tigations are also needed to examine the sensitivity of breath
analysis on multiple testing samples in patients who initially
have a negative result.
