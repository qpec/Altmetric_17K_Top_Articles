In Brief
The role that cell-to-cell infection plays
during HIV-1 spread within lymphoid
tissues has been poorly defined. Law
et al. find that HIV-infected T cells can
form durable cell-cell contacts with other
T cells in vivo, leading to clusters of
infection that frequently co-transmit
multiple viruses per cell.

SUMMARY
HIV-1 infection is enhanced by adhesive structures
that form between infected and uninfected T cells
called virological synapses (VSs). This mode of trans-
mission results in the frequent co-transmission of
multiple copies of HIV-1 across the VS, which can
reduce sensitivity to antiretroviral drugs. Studying
HIV-1 infection of humanized mice, we measured
the frequency of co-transmission and the spatiotem-
poral organization of infected cells as indicators of
cell-to-cell transmission in vivo. When inoculating
mice with cells co-infected with two viral genotypes,
we observed high levels of co-transmission to target
cells. Additionally, micro-anatomical clustering of
viral genotypes within lymphoid tissue indicates
that viral spread is driven by local processes and
not a diffuse viral cloud. Intravital splenic imaging re-
veals that anchored HIV-infected cells induce arrest
of interacting, uninfected CD4+ T cells to form Env-
dependent cell-cell conjugates. These findings sug-
gest that HIV-1 spread between immune cells can
be anatomically localized into infectious clusters.
INTRODUCTION
HIV-1 can spread efficiently when an infected T cell comes in
direct contact with an uninfected target T cell to form a virolog-
ical synapse (VS) (H€
ubner et al., 2009; Jolly et al., 2004; Rudnicka
et al., 2009). VSs are Env-dependent cell-cell adhesions that pro-
mote infection by dynamically recruiting viral proteins to the VS
and increasing transfer of HIV-1 to the target cell (H€
ubner
et al., 2009; Sherer et al., 2003). Cell-to-cell infection is critical
for efficient viral spread in vitro (Dimitrov et al., 1993; Sourisseau
et al., 2007); however, the extent of VS-mediated spread that oc-
curs in vivo is still unclear (Alvarez et al., 2014; Piguet and Satten-
tau, 2004). Recent studies in humanized mice and non-human
primate models indicate that cell-associated virus is important
for systemic spread (Murooka et al., 2012) and transmission
across mucosal barriers (Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2013; Wahl et al.,
2012). A key feature of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission in vitro is
the transfer of many viruses from donor to target cell, which
can result in a higher number of proviruses successfully infecting
the target cell (Del Portillo et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2013; Sigal
et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2013). As a result of this high MOI, this
mode of viral spread is reported to be less sensitive to certain
classes of antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) (Sigal et al., 2011; Titanji
et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2013). Cell-to-cell infection is also more
resistant to neutralizing antibodies in a manner that depends
upon the targeted Env epitopes (Abela et al., 2012; Durham
et al., 2012; Malbec et al., 2013). As lymphoid tissues are
the dominant sites of viral replication (Embretson et al., 1993;
Pantaleo et al., 1991, 1993), it is important to study cell-cell
transmission directly in these sites. Cell-cell transmission may
be especially relevant in lymphoid tissues of treated patients
where suboptimal ART concentrations are reported (Fletcher
et al., 2014; Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2016). It is critical to study
cell-to-cell infection and how multicopy infection operates in vivo
to better understand how HIV-1 persists during antiretroviral
therapy and evades neutralizing responses.
We have observed previously that co-transmission of multiple
genotypes of HIV-1 from a single multiply infected donor cell oc-
curs frequently during cell-to-cell infection in vitro (Del Portillo
et al., 2011). Titration of cells carrying two distinct viruses re-
vealed that the viruses were co-transmitted at the lowest cell
inocula only when they were co-introduced from doubly infected
cells. This mode of co-transmission may promote HIV-1 genetic
diversity by complementation of new mutations and facilitation
of rapid recombination among co-infecting genotypes (Del Por-
tillo et al., 2011; Levy et al., 2004). Modeling studies support the
hypothesis that cell-to-cell transmission promotes multicopy
infection without invoking high viral titers or high infection fre-
quencies (Komarova et al., 2012; Wodarz and Levy, 2011). In pa-
tients, infected cells that harbor several copies of HIV-1 can be
readily measured from spleen, blood, or other lymphoid tissue
(Gratton et al., 2000; Jung et al., 2002; Josefsson et al., 2011,
2013).
The ability of cell-to-cell transmission to promote multicopy
infection in vivo has not been tested experimentally. In this study,
we examined the genetic and anatomical patterns of HIV-1 infec-
tion following acute infection with cell-associated or cell-free vi-
rus. We found that multicopy infection is propagated through

replication.
RESULTS
Co-transmission of HIV-1 Variants Is Observed during
Cell-to-Cell Infection of Primary T Cells In Vitro
Cell-to-cell infection of HIV-1 in vitro results in target cells that
carry multiple viral integrants, and these are generated at levels
higher than predicted by random Poisson statistics (Del Portillo
et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2013). To study the efficiency of co-
transmission in vivo, we developed a viral clone carrying a
CCR5-tropic transmitted/founder (T/F) primary isolate envelope
from RHPA.c (Li et al., 2005), which infects humanized mice
more efficiently than laboratory isolate NL4-3, enabling us to
detect initial rounds of viral infection (Figures S1B and S1C).
We first examined this T/F Env-carrying virus during cell-free
and cell-to-cell infection of primary T cells in vitro. Infected donor
cells were generated either by co-infection of mCherry-express-
ing (red) and superfolder GFP (sfGFP)-expressing (green) viruses
together (doubly infected) or by separate infections with single-
color virus (red or green, singly infected) (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A,
and S1D). Donor cells were mixed with autologous CD4+ T cells
at varying donor-to-target ratios and patterns of multicopy infec-
tion were assessed by measuring the frequency of co-infected
cells (Figures 1C–1E). Donor cells were labeled with eFluor670
cell proliferation dye label to distinguish them from target cells.
Doubly infected donor cells mediated high levels of multicopy
infection (>3%) in target cells. The percentage of infected cells
that were doubly infected did not diminish even at low donor:tar-
get ratios (Figure 1F). Singly infected donor cells mediated high
levels of multicopy infection only at high donor:target ratios,
which decreased as total infection frequency decreased in a
pattern similar to a Poisson distribution (Figure 1F).
We examined the relationship between target cell infection fre-
quency and multicopy infection frequency with mathematical
models. From ordinary differential equations that describe the
experiments, expressions were derived for the percentage of
co-fluorescent target cells as a function of the total percentage
of infected cells (for details, see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). Experiments with singly infected donor cells were
described by model 1, which assumes that co-transmission of
both colors from donor to target cells does not occur (because
each donor cell contains only one color). The predicted relation-
ship is identical to the Poisson distribution if all target cells are
assumed to be equally susceptible. We observed an overall shift
deviating left from the Poisson curve (Figures 1F and 1G), which
was not observed in previous studies with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1
infection (Del Portillo et al., 2011). A plausible explanation for
this difference is that a proportion of target cells are not permis-
sive for T/F HIV-1 infection due to the low frequency of CCR5+
target cells or non-permissive T cell activation states. The pre-
dicted curve shifts if it is assumed that only a fraction f of the
target cells is susceptible to infection. The best fit to data was
obtained when the percentage of susceptible cells was esti-
mated to be f = 2.76% (Figure 1F).
Experiments with doubly infected donor cells were better
described by a model that takes into account co-transmission
of both colors (model 2 in the Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures). This model assumes that a doubly infected donor cell
transfers viruses of both colors to a target cell with a probability
q (the co-transmission probability). The best fit was obtained
for a co-transmission probability of q = 0.14 (Figure 1F).
Using an F test for nested models (see the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures), we determined that the co-transmission
model 2 described those data significantly better than model 1
(p = 1.7 3 10�8), indicating that co-transmission is a process
that needs to be invoked to explain the experimental data arising
from doubly infected inocula.
We performed a similar set of experiments using cell-free red
and green virus where we measured multicopy infection after
performing a serial titration of mixed virus. Cell-free virus medi-
ated limited multicopy infection as compared to infection by
doubly infected donor cells at all titrations tested (Figures 1E
and 1G). The pattern of multicopy infection was similar to
that observed with singly infected cell-associated virus, in which
both datasets were well described by the random infection
model 1 where f = 2.44% (Figure 1G). We interpret these studies
as showing that two viruses are frequently co-transmitted when
introduced from doubly infected cells and that multicopy infec-
tion occurs with random chance when testing cell-free virus.
Acute Human T Cell Infection by Cell-Associated and
Cell-free Virus Detected in Blood and Tissue of
Humanized Mice
To study co-transmission patterns in vivo, where human T cells
interact within three-dimensional (3D) lymphoid structures, we
established an acute transmission model in humanized mice.
NOD-SCID IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice engrafted with human periph-
eral blood leukocytes (hu-PBLs) provide a rich source of acti-
vated T cells permissive for HIV-1 infection (Shultz et al., 2007).
Mice were infected through intravenous (i.v.) routes with equiva-
lent tissue culture infectious doses of cell-associated or cell-free
virus. By using i.v. administration, we bypassed filtering effects
by mucosal tissue barriers. Target cells were distinguished
from donor cells through the absence of eFluor670 cell prolifer-
ation dye label within human CD45+CD3+CD8� cells. Infection
kinetics between hu-PBL mice inoculated with cell-associated
or cell-free virus were similar, as measured by plasma viremia
(Figure 2A) and target cell infection (Figure 2B) in the peripheral
blood. Both modes of transmission elicited peak infection at
8 days post-infection (dpi, �4% of target cells), which correlated
with the onset of a dramatic loss of CD4+ T cells and high plasma
viremia to 106–107 copies (Figures 2A–2C). At 3 dpi, well before
peak viremia in the blood, we observed robust infection in target
cells within lung and spleen tissue that was blocked by reverse
transcriptase inhibitor AZT, indicative of de novo replication
(Figure 2D). Infection at this early time point was largely repre-
sentative of the first round of replication. Infected p24 antigen-
positive cells were detected in the lung and spleen amidst
densely engrafted human lymphocytes (Figure 2E and S2A–
S2C). Thus, we established efficient conditions in the hu-PBL

 model to assess the initial round(s) of infection mediated by
cell-associated and cell-free viral inocula.
Co-transmission of HIV-1 Variants in Humanized Mice
Inoculated with Multiply Infected Cells
We challenged humanized mice with the same dual virus infec-
tion strategy as performed in vitro (Figure 1). Inocula of red and
green T/F HIV-1 were introduced by retro-orbital venous injec-
tion (Figure 3A). Both cell-associated and cell-free virus were
inoculated at varying doses to obtain a broad range of infection
in the lung and spleen. At 3 days after the inoculation of doubly
infected donor cells, we observed efficient multicopy infection
(>3%) of target cells across all infection densities (x axis) in
both the lung and spleen (Figures 3B and 3D). Following inocula-
tion with singly infected donor cells, mice exhibited high multi-
copy frequencies at high infection densities (>0.5%), but not at
low infection densities (<0.5%). In these conditions, multlipy
infected target cells must arise from virus that is derived from

 two different donor cells. Doubly infected donor cells mediated
significantly more multicopy infection despite no difference in
overall infection efficiency (Figures S3A and S3B).
We also examined CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cell (hu-
HSC) reconstituted mice, which carry a greater representation of
human immune cells, including naive and activated T cells,
B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and NK cells (Shultz
et al., 2007). In this model a similar trend of co-transmission in
the spleen (Figure 3E) was observed as in the hu-PBL model.
At low infection densities, multicopy infection was maintained
in the spleen of mice inoculated with doubly infected donor cells,
but not singly infected donor cells. In contrast to the hu-PBL

 model, hu-HSC mice showed limited multicopy infection in the
lung, which may reflect the lower recruitment of immune cells
to the hu-HSC lung (Figure S3C).
To quantify the role of co-transmission in vivo, we applied the
same computational analysis described for the in vitro study and
determined the best-fit parameters for both singly and doubly in-
fected groups (Figures 1F, 3D, and 3E). Experiments with singly
infected donor cells were best described with the simplest
random infection model without co-transmission, i.e., model 1
with estimates of f = 3%–6% (Figures 3D and 3E). Similar
to the in vitro scenario, we found that the experiments with
doubly infected donor cells were described significantly better
with model 2, which assumes the occurrence of co-transmis-
sion, than with model 1 (based on the F test for nested models,
p = 1.4 3 10�4 for hu-HSC spleen and p = 1.1 3 10�3 for hu-
PBL lung). The estimated co-transmission probabilities were
q = 0.06 for hu-HSC spleen and q = 0.13 for hu-PBL lung.
For hu-PBL spleen, the data were more complex and dis-
played a negative correlation between the percentage of doubly
infected target cells and the total percentage of infected cells,
which could not be accounted for by the basic version of model 2.
To account for the observed negative correlation, a variation of
model 2 was constructed (see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures), which included the additional assumption that the
probability of co-transmission can be negatively impacted by
donor cell input density. We found that this model fit the hu-
PBL spleen data well, significantly better than either model 2 or
model 1 (F test, p = 1.5 3 10�4 and p = 8.8 3 10�9, respectively).
While the probability of co-transmission varies with donor cell
density in this model, the estimated variation lied in the range
of q = 0.03–0.25, which falls within an order of magnitude of
the other estimates we predicted for this parameter. Note that
while the assumption of density-dependent co-transmission
can lead to a good fit to the data, this remains only a hypothesis.
Alternative mechanisms might lead to equally good descriptions
of the data. At minimum, the computational analysis for the in vivo
data indicate that co-transmission needs to be invoked to accu-
rately describe the trends observed.
We also performed a series of experiments with cell-free virus
in which red and green viral stocks were administered into
contralateral eyes similar to mice infected with singly infected
donor cells. Cell-free inocula mediated higher multicopy infec-
tion in the spleen compared to singly infected, cell-associated
inocula (Figure 3F; Figure S3B) to levels not observed in in vitro
experiments (Figure 1F). The presence of other cell types in vivo
may provide viral concentrating mechanisms that facilitate
co-infection, such as trans-infection by DCs or macrophages
(Cavrois et al., 2008; Sewald et al., 2015). At low infection fre-
quencies, cell-free inocula mediated less multicopy infection
than that mediated by doubly infected, cell-associated inocula
in both the lung and spleen (Figures 3D and 3F). Computational
modeling of these data revealed patterns of multicopy infection
were well described by the random infection model 1, where
f = 2.1% for the hu-PBL lung and f = 5.8% for the hu-PBL spleen.
Interestingly, these f values were similar to the estimates ob-
tained with cell-associated virus.
Spatial Compartmentalization of HIV-1 Variants in
Splenic Tissue
If HIV-1 spread occurs from cell to cell, we might expect to see
evidence for local propagation of viruses by examining the clus-
tering of infected cells. To determine whether the high efficiency
of multicopy infection is promoted by viral replication in segre-
gated clusters, or whether the process is more diffuse, we gener-
ated 3D images of splenic tissue from hu-PBL mice inoculated
with doubly infected cells or singly infected cells. From this multi-
photon (MP) imaging, we defined the spatial coordinates for red,
green, and co-fluorescent cells in each image (Figure 4A). We
verified that MP imaging detected red and green cells with a
frequency comparable to flow cytometry of cells from the same
tissue (Figures S4A and S4B).
To measure the frequency of clustering, a computational
approach was used that compared the spatial distribution of red
andgreeninfected cellsagainstarandomized-colordatasetusing
the fixed coordinates of infected cells in each 3D image. This cell-
clustering analysis measured the prevalence of same-colored
cells in the proximity of each other within a given spatial radius.
This was done separately for green cell and for red cell popula-
tions. A p value for the prevalence of clustering of similar color
as a function of the spatial scale was calculated (Figures 4B and
S4C–S4E; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Evi-
dence for clustering was found when the probability of obtaining
a similar level of clustered cells by random chance was equal to
or less than 0.05. When red and green infected cells were in close
proximityrelativetoinfectedcellsoflikecolor,thisgreatlyreduced
the cell-clustering scores. In mice inoculated with doubly infected
donor cells, we observed a modest level of clustering of infected
cells with the same viral genotype (Figure 4C). Co-infected donor
cells mayreducethe prevalenceof infected cell clustersharboring
the same color genotype. In mice inoculated with singly infected
donor cells, we observed a higher frequency of clustering, indi-
cating that compartmentalization of infected cell populations is
dependent upon the segregation of viral genotypes within the
inoculum. This further supports a model for local viral replication
of infected cells that occurs within lymphoid organs.
Infected Cells Display Altered Motility and Elongated
Morphology in the Spleen of Humanized Mice
To assess infected cell movement and to see how spatial
clustering may be maintained over time, we performed MP
intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) of the spleen after HIV-1 inocula-
tion. The hu-PBL model provides a system to monitor the move-
ment and cell-cell contacts between human T cells. In hu-PBL
mice inoculated with singly infected donor cells, we observed

 restricted migration in some red and green infected cells over
time, while uninfected donor cells migrated between micro-clus-
ters of infected cells as measured by tracks of cells (Figures 4D
and 4E; Movie S1). Infected cells exhibited a 40% reduction in
mean migratory velocity as compared to uninfected cells (Fig-
ure 4F), consistent with previous reports observed in popliteal
lymph nodes of humanized mice (Murooka et al., 2012).
In addition to reduced motility, infected cells frequently dis-
played greatly enlarged and elongated morphologies that
stretched over distances greater than 100 mm (Figure 4G; Movie
S2). We observed frequent formation of elongated tethers be-
tween multi-lobed structures, which may be the result of syncytia
formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed infected cells display
uropods that are relatively immobile over time, with leading
edge(s) of the same cell extending and retracting projections
that probe the regions surrounding an anchor point (Movie S2).
These cells that were infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 resembled
the multi-nucleated syncytia reported in lymph nodes of human-
ized mice infected with lab-adapted isolates of HIV-1 (Murooka
et al., 2012; Symeonides et al., 2015). Here we found that the
restricted movement of cells contributes to the spatially com-
partmentalized viral replication within the spleen of humanized
mice.
Formation of Stable T Cell Contacts and Migratory
Arrest of Target CD4+ T Cells Induced by Infected

VSs promote efficient cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission via long-
lived cell-cell interfaces between infected and uninfected CD4+
T cells (Chen et al., 2007; H€
ubner et al., 2007; Sattentau,
2010). Previous studies have surmised that infected cell tethers
with unseen structures were indicative of cell-cell interactions
involving putative uninfected target cells. We therefore examined
the ability of HIV-infected cells to influence the migration of
target cells in vivo.
To visualize the movement of target CD4+ T cells as they
interact with infected cells in vivo, we generated hu-PBL mice
in which �25% of all CD4+ T cells were genetically marked with
a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector (Figure 5A). In time-lapse re-
cordings, GFP+CD4+ T cells were evenly distributed throughout
the spleen and highly motile (3D velocity of 4–5 mm min�1) (Fig-
ure 5B). Following infection with mCherry-expressing HIV-1,
while the majority of target cells maintained their pattern of migra-
tion when in the vicinity of infected cells, target CD4+GFP+ T cells
were observed to form long-lived cell-cell contacts (>10 min),
often in clusters focused at anchor sites at the uropod of infected
cells (Figure 5C; Movie S3). Uninfected target CD4+ T cell motility
was measured overthe infected cells, and a decrease in meanve-
locity and a concomitant increase in arrest coefficient were
evident in comparison to target cells away from infected T cell
clusters (Figures 5B, 5D, and 5E). However, the motility of unin-
fected target CD4+ T cells and frequency of pausing of these cells
were unchanged in the vicinity of infected cells that express HIV-1
with a non-functional Env (DEnv) (Figures 5G and 5H). In these
time-lapse 3D images, DEnv-infected cells did not display
enlarged and elongated morphologies, and evidence for long-
lived cell-cell contacts (>10 min) between infected and target
T cells was not readily observed (Figure S5A; Movie S4). We
thus provide direct evidence that Env is required for infected cells
to influence the migration, slow the motility, and induce pausing
of uninfected CD4 T cells in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Multicopy transmission of HIV-1 can promote the generation of
genetic diversity by allowing mutant viruses to be co-inherited
with non-mutant viruses. In cases where the mutant sequence
confers decreased fitness, co-transmission with a non-mutant
strain may allow that mutant sequence to persist through genetic
complementation. Using a two-color infection strategy, we find
that co-transmission is active during acute transmission with
cell-associated forms of HIV-1. Infected cells form micro-clus-
ters of cells with the same genotype that are apparent when
separate red and green donor cells are in the source inoculum.
Approximately 6%–10% of all infected target CD4+ T cells are
multiply infected with different viral genotypes independent of
the input inoculum. In our experiments, only infections with two
different genotypes were detected as multicopy; however, a
more accurate estimate should include multicopy infections
with the same genotype, which would result in an even higher
fraction of multiply infected cells.
Recent studies on infected individuals have emphasized that
most infected cells carry a single copy of HIV-1; however, on
average, they observed multicopy infection in �5%–7% of
CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood or lymph nodes (Josefs-
son et al., 2011, 2013). Studies from the Wain-Hobson group
conducted on human splenic tissue reported that infected cells
carry multiple proviruses, on average around three to four

 proviruses per infected cell in chronically infected patients, with
substantial genetic variation despite a low overall infected cell
frequency (Gratton et al., 2000; Jung et al., 2002). A possible
explanation for the variation in the frequency of multiply infected
cells observed in patient studies is that multicopy infected cells
die more frequently than singly infected cells. Such a survivor
bias could influence the frequency of cells carrying single copies,
particularly if cell-cell transmission also is associated with
enhanced cell death (Doitsh et al., 2014; Galloway et al., 2015;
Mun
˜ oz-Arias et al., 2015). Cell-free viral inocula can result in
co-infection in vivo when introduced at high titers. This may
reflect the contribution of other cells that can concentrate cell-
free virus, such as CD169/Siglec-1-expressing macrophages
(Sewald et al., 2015) or DCs (Chen et al., 2005). However, we
note that the patterns observed using cell-free virus can be
well described in our modeling studies by model 1, where multi-
ple infections reflect a Poisson-like distribution.
Whereas infected cells can move and migrate and may
contribute to viral spread, those that are elongated displayed
an anchored phenotype. The intravital imaging presented here
also supports a model for local viral replication of infected cells
that can occur within lymphoid organs through VS-mediated
transmission. Early studies also have observed micro-compart-
mentalized splenic tissue from HIV-1-infected patients (Gratton
et al., 2000) and lymphoid and cervical mucosa tissues from
acutely simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys
(Gratton et al., 2000; Rudnicka et al., 2009). Even though hu-
PBL mice did not generate follicular structures that were orga-
nized by immune cell type, we still observed compartmentalized
viral replication within engrafted T cells. The reduced motility of
infected cells in the spleen of humanized mice may contribute
to the compartmentalization of viral replication. Infected cell
motility may be altered through viral protein Nef, as it has been
shown to have an inhibitory effect on the motility of mouse
CD4+ T cells in vivo, possibly by the disruption of host cell actin
dynamics (Stolp et al., 2012). In addition, through examination of
uninfected target CD4+ T cell interaction, we directly observed
the influence of the infected cell on the motility of uninfected
T cells migrating in its vicinity. The combination of arrest of target
cells and slowed migration of infected cells were sufficient to
observe clustering of infected cells within lymphoid tissue during
acute infection. While some infected cells can migrate from or-
gan to organ (Murooka et al., 2012), within a given tissue viral
spread can be followed among cells that have restricted motility.
Thus, infected cells may form both short-lived contacts to
mediate systemic dissemination and long-lived synaptic con-
tacts that mediate local viral replication.
Also contributing to the limited dispersion of infected cells is
the formation of syncytia by infected T cells in lymphoid tissue
(Murooka et al., 2012; Murooka and Mempel, 2012; Orenstein,
2000; Vasiliver-Shamis et al., 2008). We observed large multi-
lobed infected cell morphology and elongated phenotypes dur-
ing acute infection with an HIV-1 molecular clone expressing a
primary isolate R5-tropic T/F Env, which is not classically
thought of as a syncytium-inducing strain. Recently, it has
been observed that small syncytia form transient interactions
with uninfected target cells and are sufficient to transfer virus
in 3D extracellular matrices (Symeonides et al., 2015). Further
studies will be needed to determine the role of syncytia formation
in contributing to mixing of viral genotypes.
Although HIV may use cells to transport infection from organ to
organ or even from person to person, this study supports that
in vivo cell-to-cell transmission efficiently propagates infections
locally within tissues. The altered motility of infected cells and
their ability to form long-lived contacts with target CD4+ T cells
reveal the influence of HIV on uninfected CD4+ T cell migration.
The evidence presented here indicates that cell-to-cell trans-
mission occurs within lymphoid tissues. Given that cell-cell
transmission provides a means of evading antiviral therapies
and antibody-mediated responses, this study emphasizes
that therapeutic and preventive approaches should carefully
consider the unique aspects of this mode of infection.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Viral Constructs
NL-sfGI and NL-CI encode sfGFP or mCherry, respectively, in place of nef, and
nef expression is rescued with insertion of an internal ribosome entry site
(IRES). Viruses express either envelope from X4-tropic pNL4-3 or the R5-tropic
B-clade primary envelope from pRHPA4259 clone 7 (SVPB14) (Li et al., 2005),
and they were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (ARP), from
B.H. Hahn and J.F. Salazar-Gonzalez. Infectious HIV-1 virus was produced
by transfecting NL-sfGI and NL-CI using Polyjet transfection reagent (Signa-
gen), per the manufacturer’s instructions, and was quantified by p24 ELISA.
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for quantification.
Cells and Tissue Culture
For infection of primary CD4+ T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coat (New York Blood Center) by ficoll
gradient centrifugation. CD4+ T cells were isolated by magnetic bead separa-
tion (Miltenyi), were activated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; 2 mg/ml, Sigma)
and IL-2 (50 IU/ml, Roche) for 3 days, and co-cultured with irradiated feeder
PBMCs. Stimulated CD4+ T cells were spinoculated at 1,200 3 g for 90 min
with virus stocks NL-sfGI or NL-CI viral stocks. Cells were harvested 24 hr
post-infection for all experiments.
Infection Assays
For cell-to-cell infections, infected cells were used at donor cells in an in vitro
infection assay using activated autologous CD4+ T cells as targets cells. Target
cells were dye labeled with cell proliferation dye eFluor 450 or eFluor 670
(eBioscience). The ratio of donors to targets was titrated from 3:1 to 1:27, with
a constant 4 3 105 cells in 400 ml in a 5-ml round-bottom tube. After 3 hr, co-cul-
tures were diluted by transferring to a six-well tissue culture plate. For cell-free
infection, five serial 2-fold starting from 5 ng of p24 HIV-1 viral stocks was mixed
with 4 3 105 target T cells in 400 ml in a 5-ml round-bottom tube for 3 hr. After 3 hr,
co-cultures were diluted by transferring to a six-well tissue culture plate. After
incubating cultures for 37 hr, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
analyzed on a LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Mice
NOD-NSG Il2rgNULL (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, NSG) mice were pur-
chased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice were bred and maintained at
the Center for Comparative Medicine and Surgery (CCMS) at Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai according to guidelines established by the Institu-
tional Animal Committee. All experiments were performed with authorization
from the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. For hu-
PBL models, mice 4–6 weeks old were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of 10 million PBMCs. For hu-HSC models, neonatal mice 0–2 days old were
irradiated and injected with 2.5–10 3 105 cord blood-derived CD34+ cells.
Engraftment for hu-PBL and hu-HSC mice was assessed at 2 and 12 weeks,
respectively.

 Infection of Humanized Mice
At 24 hr post-infection, infection of donor cells was quantified by flow cytom-
etry. Infected donor cells (2.5 3 104, 5 3 104, or 15 3 104) or cell-free virus
(5-30 ng) were injected into each retro-orbital sinus. For doubly infected
mice, cells infected with both NL-sfGI and NL-CI viruses were injected retro-
orbitally. For singly infected mice, each virus was injected into contralateral
eyes. Mice were anesthetized by isofluorane inhalation and a single 50- to
150-ml i.v. injection per eye. To block first-round infection, AZT (Zidovudine,
ViiV Healthcare) was added to drinking water 24 hr prior to infection.
Mathematical Modeling
For co-infection experiments, we used statistical and mathematical modeling
approaches in order to interpret the observed correlations between the per-
centage of double-color cells and the percentage of infected cells. The data
were described using a set of ordinary differential equations. See the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for details.
Plasma Viral Load
Viral copy number in plasma from humanized mice was measured by the
RT-PCR method as previously described (Mohri and Markowitz, 2008). See
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Two-Photon Microscopy
Two-photon imaging was performed using an Olympus Fluoview FV1200MPE
microscope with a 253/0.8 numerical aperture (NA) water emersion objective
lens. For MP excitation and second harmonic generation, a MaiTai Ti:sapphire
laser (Newport/Spectra-Physics) was tuned to 795 and 890 nm for optimized
excitation of mCherry-expressing HIV-1. Emission filters were 420–460 nm
for second harmonic generation (SHG), 495–540 nm for GFP, and 575–
630 nm for mCherry. Six to eight 80-mm z stacks were acquired for each mouse
tissue with 2-mm z spacing between each optical section (512 3 512 pixels).
For ex vivo imaging, the spleens from humanized mice were surgically isolated
and transferred to a 25 3 25 3 1-mm imaging chamber (Grace Bio-Labs) con-
taining RPMI 1640 medium. For IVM of the spleen, hu-PBL mice were anesthe-
tized by i.p. infection of ketamine/xylazine solution and hair was removed from
dorsal side of the mouse. A 2-mm cut was made through the skin and perito-
neum to reveal the spleen. Spleen was immobilized to coverglass using an im-
mobilized optical window under applied vacuum suction (Thornton et al.,
2012). Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane in high oxygen for the course
of imaging. For four-dimensional (4D) recordings of cell migration, stacks of
30 optical sections (512 3 512 pixels) with 2-mm z spacing were acquired every
60 s to provide imaging volumes of 60 mm in depth.
Target Cell Visualization Studies
CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs and transduced with pHR-SIN-CSGW
vector expressing GFP using the same protocol for HIV constructs. Five days
after PHA stimulation, CD4+ T cells and negative fraction were injected into
mice to generate hu-PBL CD4+GFP mice. After 14 days post-engraftment,
mice wereinfectedwithNL-CIvirus or NL-CIDEnvandimagedbyMP-IVM3dpi.
Image Analysis
The 3D reconstructions were generated using Imaris 7 (Bitplane). For static im-
ages of splenic tissue, surface function was used to define cell coordinates
and revised manually. For 4D intravital imaging, cell velocity and displacement
parameters were determined using Imaris Track module. Two-dimensional
(2D) mean velocities were quantified by ImageJ software.
Two-Colored Clustering Analysis
For color-specific clustering analysis, we created a measure of prevalence of
same-colored cells in the proximity of each other. This was done separately for
green cells and for red cells. To assess statistical significance of clustering
behavior, we tested our datasets against a large number of artificial datasets,
where the locations of the cells were the same as in the experimental dataset
but the color assignment was random. Statistically significant clustering was
defined when the probability of obtaining a similar level of clustered cells
was equal to or less than 0.05. See the Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures for details.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V5 and data were
initially interrogated for normal distribution. For groupwise comparisons, a
one-way ANOVA with Bonferonni post hoc test was performed. For pairwise
comparisons, a Student’s t test was performed. For best-fit model compari-
sons, an F test for nested models was performed. See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for details.
