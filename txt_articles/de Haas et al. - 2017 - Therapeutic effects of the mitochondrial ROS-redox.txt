Leigh Disease is a progressive neurometabolic disorder for which a clinical effective treatment is 
currently still lacking. Here, we report on the therapeutic efficacy of KH176, a new chemical entity 
derivative of Trolox, in Ndufs4−/− mice, a mammalian model for Leigh Disease. Using in vivo brain 
diffusion tensor imaging, we show a loss of brain microstructural coherence in Ndufs4−/− mice in the 
cerebral cortex, external capsule and cerebral peduncle. These findings are in line with the white matter 
diffusivity changes described in mitochondrial disease patients. Long-term KH176 treatment retained 
brain microstructural coherence in the external capsule in Ndufs4−/− mice and normalized the increased 
lipid peroxidation in this area and the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, KH176 treatment was able to 
significantly improve rotarod and gait performance and reduced the degeneration of retinal ganglion 
cells in Ndufs4−/− mice. These in vivo findings show that further development of KH176 as a potential 
treatment for mitochondrial disorders is worthwhile to pursue. Clinical trial studies to explore the 
potency, safety and efficacy of KH176 are ongoing.
Mitochondrial diseases are heterogeneous multisystem disorders with a prevalence of 1 in 5,000 live births1, 2. 
Frequently these inborn errors of energy metabolism are caused by nuclear DNA (nDNA) or mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) mutations affecting the phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system3–6. Complex I or NADH:ubiquinone 
oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.3) is the first and largest OXPHOS enzyme complex consisting of 37 nDNA and 7 
mtDNA encoded protein subunits7–9. It is the most common origin for mitochondrial abnormalities10, 11 and both 
nDNA and mtDNA mutations can give rise to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, altered redox 
status, and abnormal mitochondrial architecture12–14.
Leigh Disease (LD) is one of the many phenotypic appearances with which OXPHOS diseases can pres-
ent15. The incidence of LD is approximately 1 in 77,000 live births and symptoms typically begin early in life16, 17. 
Neuro-imaging in LD patients reveal bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and dentate nuclei18. 
The prognosis for individuals with LD is generally poor and most patients decease at an early age19, 20. There is an 
unmet medical need to develop clinical effective treatments for LD and other mitochondrial disorders. Several 
potential new treatment strategies are under pre-clinical development21–24. Promising results of pharmacolog-
ical or genetic interventions in mice have been described, acting on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial 
morphology, rapamycin mTOR signaling or oxidative stress25–33. We observed that oxidation of the ROS sen-
sors hydroethidine and 5- (and -6)-chloromethyl-2′

was significantly increased in genetically characterized primary skin fibroblasts derived from LD patients with 
isolated complex I deficiency34, 35. The α
-tocopherol derivative Trolox normalized these increased levels of 
CM-H2DCF oxidation in patient’s fibroblasts36. Phenotypic effects of Trolox and four newly developed Trolox 
variants (KH001–KH004) in LD patient cells were evaluated by using a machine learning strategy37. One of the 
Trolox variants (KH003) effectively scavenged ROS and increased the maximal activity of complex I, complex 
IV, and citrate synthase, suggesting that this variant might be a promising candidate for the development of 
therapeutic strategies in mitochondrial disorders. Encouraged by these findings a lead-optimization program 
was started to improve the drug-likeness properties of the candidate37, 38. Since ROS increase and redox signaling 
perturbation are common consequences of OXPHOS deficiencies, the 226 new chemical entities generated were 
evaluated in parallel for their potency and efficacy in scavenging cellular ROS and protecting patient-derived 
cells against Redox perturbation13, 39–42. Ultimately, KH176 was selected as the lead compound for further studies, 
based on its potency, efficacy in ROS-redox assays but also importantly based on its physicochemical properties 
such as oral bioavailability, cell and blood-brain barrier permeability, water solubility and chemical stability43. The 
effect of the compounds on OXPHOS enzymes activity was not included in the lead optimization program. It is 
worth mentioning that while KH176 is more potent when compared to the hit compound KH003 in the ROS and 
redox assay, it didn’t increase the activity of complex I activity in vitro (unpublished data) as opposed to KH00338.
This study examines the therapeutic effect of KH176 in a mammalian model of LD, the NADH dehydro-
genase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4 (Ndufs4) knockout (Ndufs4−
/−) mouse model44. Additionally, for 
the first time, brain microstructural coherence has been evaluated in this mouse model. Primary muscle and 
skin fibroblasts from Ndufs4−
/− mice display increased ROS levels and aberrant mitochondrial morphology45. 
Furthermore, immortalized Ndufs4−
/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed reduced oxygen consumption, ele-
vated NAD+/NADH ratio and lactate production46. These findings indicate a role of increased ROS formation 
and altered redox balance in the disease pathogenesis in this animal model. Ndufs4−
/− mice show a progressive 
neurodegenerative phenotype characterized by marked bilateral lesions in the vestibular nuclei, lethargy, ataxia, 
weight loss, epilepsy and ultimately death at a median age of postnatal day (PD) 4544, 47, 48. In Ndufs4−
/− mice, 
protein succination as a result of Krebs cycle inhibition is increased in the brainstem, specifically in the vestibular 
nuclei49. This is the most affected region and it has been shown that Ndufs4−
/− mice typically die of respiratory 
failure attributed to vestibular nucleus pathology50. Recently, increased oxidative stress has been determined in 
Ndufs4−
/− mice retinas in the period of PD20-PD3051. Complex I deficiency triggers OXPHOS dysfunction and 
oxidative stress which cause cell death of the most sensitive cells, bipolar and amacrine cells, in the retina at an 
early age. This early cell death triggers the inflammatory response at PD30, which coincides with the loss of vision 
and will be followed by the loss of retinal ganglion cells at PD4247, 52. It has recently been shown that chronic 
hypoxia markedly improved survival, body weight, body temperature, behavior, neuropathology, and disease 
biomarkers in Ndufs4−
/− mice53, 54. The systemic phenotype after selective inactivation of Ndufs4 in neurons and 
glia cells (NesKO mice) is essentially identical to that of Ndufs4−
/− mice, indicating the origin of this progressive 
neurodegenerative phenotype47.
In this paper, we report beneficial effects of the ROS-redox modulator small molecule KH176 in the ubiqui-
tous OXPHOS complex I-deficient Ndufs4−
/− mouse model based on the loss of brain microstructural coherence, 
increased lipid peroxidation as well as on the progressive neurodegenerative phenotype.
Results
KH176 maintains microstructural coherence in the brain of Ndufs4−/− mice. 
To investigate brain 
microstructural organization in the Ndufs4−
/− mice, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed with an ultra-
high field MR system. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is often employed as a sensitive measure of microstructural 
coherence, being relatively high in white matter and lower in gray matter, which can be assigned to the presence 
of densely packed parallel oriented fiber tracts in white matter55.
For calculation of the FA, six different brain regions of interest were defined (Fig. 1A). The FA values of the dif-
ferent white and gray matter brain regions in control mice were similar to those reported by others55–57. However, 
compared to controls, the FA values of Ndufs4−
/− mice were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex, exter-
nal capsule and cerebral peduncle, indicating a loss of microstructural coherence in these areas (Fig. 1B). KH176 
treatment in Ndufs4−
/− mice resulted in statistically significantly higher FA values in the external capsule and a 
similar trend was found in the cerebral peduncle (Fig. 1C). This indicated that KH176 partially corrected FA val-
ues in Ndufs4−
/− mice brain, and thereby maintained microstructural coherence in defined areas.
Increased lipid peroxidation normalized by KH176. 
ROS are highly reactive molecules contain-
ing oxygen with unpaired electrons, which can lead to lipid peroxidation. The lipid peroxidation product 
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) was used as an indicator for ROS, by immunohistochemical 4HNE staining as 
described previously by others58. 4HNE staining showed an overall increase in Ndufs4−
/− mice brain compared to 
control (Fig. 2). This increase was statistically significant in the cerebral cortex and external capsule, which were 
the same brain areas with decreased FA values measured at PD > 42 (Fig. 2G). After KH176 treatment, lipid per-
oxidation was normalized (Fig. 2H). These results indicate a relation between FA and lipid peroxidation, which 
was confirmed previously in a study with bipolar patients59.
Therapeutic effect of KH176 on brain histopathology in Ndufs4−/− mice. 
An amino cupric silver 
stain allowed us to investigate the degree of neurodegeneration in the brain of Ndufs4−
/− mice. A number of 
specific brain areas of both vehicle and KH176-treated Ndufs4−
/− mice were positively stained (Supplementary 
Fig. S1). Spongiform lesions were evidently recognized within the interpeduncular nucleus and vestibular 
nuclei as centrally unstained areas (viii and xiii). Regarding incidence, distribution, morphologic character-
istics and grade of the changes, largely comparable changes were observed in the vehicle and KH176-treated

Ndufs4−
/− mice. No histopathologic abnormalities were found in control mice. KH176 treatment was not able to 
reduce or prevent the severe brain pathology, including the vestibular nuclei lesions. Furthermore, KH176 treat-
ment had no effect on disease onset or disease severity measured by phenotypic scoring or life span. Quintana 
et al. previously reported that inactivation of Ndufs4 in the vestibular nuclei also induces breathing abnormal-
ities and increased mortality, besides neurodegeneration50. Viral restoration of Ndufs4 attenuated respiratory 
abnormalities and ameliorated the fatal phenotype of Ndufs4−
/− mice. Vestibular pathology was still present in 
KH176-treated Ndufs4−
/− mice, which explains the lack of extending life span in our study.
The activities of the separate respiratory chain complexes were measured in whole brain homogenates of 
Ndufs4−
/− mice (KH176 or vehicle treated) and control mice (PD > 42). As expected, complex I activity was 
almost absent in brain tissue of Ndufs4−
/− mice, and complex III activity, like in patients, was slightly lowered. As 
the compound was specifically designed to target the two major cell biological consequences of complex I defi-
ciencies, being elevated ROS and perturbation in redox signaling, as expected no treatment effects of KH176 were 
noted on OXPHOS complex enzyme activity (Fig. 3A)38.
KH176 improves motor performance in Ndufs4−/− mice. 
Rotarod performance, which measures 
motor coordination and motor learning, was significantly impaired in the Ndufs4−
/− vehicle mice compared 
to control on PD35 and PD42 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, KH176 treatment in the Ndufs4−
/− mice improved motor 
performance significantly on PD21 and PD42 (Fig. 3B).
In addition, the effect of KH176 on mitochondrial morphology and histochemistry of soleus muscle tissue 
was examined (Supplementary Fig. S2). Electron microscopy showed large mitochondria, some with abnormal 
cristae in both Ndufs4−
/− mice groups. KH176 had no positive or negative effects in the soleus muscle, based on 
mitochondrial morphology and histochemistry.
KH176 reduced degeneration of ganglion cells in Ndufs4−/− mice. 
Ndufs4−
/− mice present loss 
of vision at PD30, which coincides with increase of the retinal stress marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein)52. Long-term treatment (PD14–PD45) with 10 mg/kg/day resulted in retinal KH176 concentrations ranging 
from 486–523 ng/ml. No significant differences were noted in thickness of the different retina layers (Fig. 3C). 
Interestingly, the number of ganglion cells was statistically significantly reduced in Ndufs4−
/− mice compared to 
control, and KH176 treatment statistically significantly reduced the degeneration of ganglion cells, although it 
was not completely halted (Fig. 3D and E).

Therapeutic effect of KH176 on gait performance in Ndufs4−/− mice. 
We evaluated the effects of 
KH176 intervention on gait abnormalities in Ndufs4−
/− mice. Since walking speed differs during a whole run, the 
maximum variation of run speed was calculated (Fig. 4A). Ndufs4−
/− mice are known to have increased walking

speed variability at PD40, indicating a more hampered and uncoordinated gait60. KH176 treatment was able to 
prevent this, resulting in a more fluent and coordinated gait (Fig. 4A). Run speed was significantly decreased in 
Ndufs4−
/− mice compared to control at all time points (Fig. 4B). KH176 treatment tended to increase run speed 
in Ndufs4−
/− mice at PD40, however, not significantly. At PD40 the Ndufs4−
/− mice showed a marked decrease 
in step sequence, indicating a more disorganized gait, which was prevented by KH176 treatment (Fig. 4C). Mean 
maximum intensity of the left and right hind paws on the glass plate was significantly lower in the Ndufs4−
/− mice 
compared to control mice at PD40, which was not found in the KH176-treated mice (Fig. 4D). Relative duration 
of simultaneous contact with the glass plate was measured for different paw combinations. Diagonal support was 
significantly decreased in both Ndufs4−
/− groups compared to control at PD35 and PD40 (Fig. 4E). In contrast, 
lateral support was statistically significantly increased in the Ndufs4−
/− vehicle group compared to control at

PD40, which was prevented by KH176 treatment (Fig. 4F). Altogether, these results show the ability of KH176 to 
improve abnormal gait in Ndufs4−
/− mice.
Discussion
In this study, we assessed for the first time DTI in Ndufs4−
/− mice, a mammalian model for mitochondrial com-
plex I deficiency. The observed reduced FA in the cerebral cortex, external capsule and cerebral peduncle in 
Ndufs4−
/− brain, is in line with white matter diffusivity changes previously described in patients with mitochon-
drial disorders. Widespread reductions in FA (including the external capsule and cerebral peduncles) were found 
in three different clinical studies; in a group of pediatric patients, identified as having complex I or complex I/III 
deficits, among patients with m.3243A > G mutation and patients with OPA1 autosomal dominant optic atrophy 
and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy61–63. Not only FA was affected in the cerebral cortex and external cap-
sule, we also found a significant increase in lipid peroxidation in these brain areas. KH176 treatment was able to 
maintain microstructural coherence in the external capsule and to correct lipid peroxidation in both brain areas. 
Previously a relation has been noted between DTI measurements and peripheral measures of lipid peroxidation, 
suggesting that lipid peroxidation could be associated with the underlying pathophysiologic processes involving 
in white matter abnormalities59.
KH176 could not rescue the activity of isolated complex I. However, in isolated enzymatic assay the lack of 
activity of Ndufs4−
/− complex 1 is mainly reflecting the lack of stability during the detergent-based isolation. In 
intact mitochondria of Ndufs4−
/− mice the activity of complex I is only moderately affected. We could therefore

not fully rule out a potential effect of KH176 on complex I activity which could explain its physiological beneficial 
effect.
Previous preclinical studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of other small molecule compounds 
in Ndufs4−
/− mice. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-
(N,N-dimethylamino) acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34) showed clinical effects based on neurological scoring, 
exploratory and motor activity, and rotarod performance, and similar to our study, no effect on life span was 
observed26. In contrast, rapamycin treatment resulted in a significant increase in life span, attenuated hindlimb 
clasping and maintained rotarod performance25. However, rapamycin dramatically reduced maximum body 
weight to 8–9 gram at PD35 (versus 12 gram at PD35 for vehicle Ndufs4−
/− and 20 grams at PD40 for control 
mice) and no evidence for gain in quality of life was presented after PD5025, 30. KH176 was not able to prevent 
the development of the bilateral vestibular nuclei lesions, which contribute to lethality and explain the lack of 
extending life span up to the humane endpoint. However, the compound significantly reduced ganglion cell 
degeneration and improved different clinical disease symptoms, without any negative effects on developmental 
body weight. Furthermore, KH176 was able to improve rotarod performance, a measure of motor coordination 
and motor learning. Ndufs4−
/− mice treated with KH176 showed a significantly more fluent and coordinated gait 
in contrast to the hampering and uncoordinated abnormal gait in vehicle treated Ndufs4−
/− mice. We hypoth-
esizes that the observed clinical effects of KH176 on rotarod and gait performance may be associated with the 
beneficial effects on ROS and brain microstructural coherence of white matter fiber tracts in the external capsule 
and cerebral peduncles. The external capsule consists of corticostriatal fibers moving to the basal ganglia, which 
plays a central role in reward, cognitive, and motor functions64. Furthermore, corticospinal and corticocerebellar 
fibers cross through the cerebral peduncles, involved in refining motor movements, motor learning and converts 
proprioceptive information into balance and posture maintenance.
In this study, KH176 was administrated twice daily via intraperitoneal injections resulting in two peak con-
centrations per day. For future studies the compound administration needs to be optimized aiming at an effective 
steady-state plasma concentration with less fluctuations. Since the Ndufs4−
/− mouse is a severe disease model with 
limited time to rescue its fatal phenotype, it would be interesting to test the efficacy of KH176 in other species 
representing a less pronounced disease course.
In conclusion, these in vivo findings show that further development of KH176 as a potential treatment for 
mitochondrial disorders is worthwhile to pursue. Clinical trial studies to explore the potency, safety and efficacy 
of KH176 are ongoing (www.clinicaltrial.gov, NCT02909400).
Material and Methods
Animals. 
Initial breeding pairs of heterozygous Ndufs4+/− mice (mixed 129/Sv:C57BL6J background)44 were 
kindly provided by the Palmiter laboratory at the University of Washington and sustained in our breeding facility. 
Ndufs4+/− mice were intercrossed to produce Ndufs4−
/− mice. Pups received toe tattoos for identification and tail 
clips were taken for genotyping at PD8. After genotyping Ndufs4+/− and Ndufs4−
/− mice were randomly assigned 
to the KH176 or vehicle group and drug administration started at PD14. All mice were group housed under con-
trolled conditions (temperature 20–22 °C and humidity 50–70%) with free access to standard food (Ssniff GmbH, 
Soest, 76. Germany. V1534-300 R/M-H) and water and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. In our studies both 
female and male mice were used and equally divided. All mice were weaned at PD25. Ndufs4−
/− mice were always 
housed with a minimum of one control littermate for warmth and provided with food on the bottom of the cage. 
Mice were weighed daily and clinical symptoms were observed. Based on ethical considerations and regulations it 
should be stated that no permission was obtained to pass the so-called humane endpoint, indicated by the severity 
of clinical symptoms observed in combination with a body weight loss of >20%. All animal experiments were in 
accordance with the Dutch laws (Wet op de Dierproeven), ARRIVE guidelines and European Community guide-
lines for animal care and approved by the Committee for Animal Care and Experimental Use of the University 
of Nijmegen.
KH176. 
Out of hundreds newly engineered chemical entities, KH176 (or ((S)-6-hydroxy-
2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-N-((R)-piperidin-3-yl)chroman-2-carboxamide hydrochloride; Patent WO2014011047 A1) 
was selected as the lead molecule based on an optimal balance between properties such as potency, stability, water 
solubility, oral bioavailability, blood-brain barrier permeability and metabolism. KH176 was dissolved in saline 
and administered with a maximal dose volume of 10 ml/kg bodyweight. Mice were twice daily i.p. injected, with 
KH176 (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle, using 0.3 ml insulin syringes (30G ×
 8 mm needle) starting at PD14 until the 
end of the study. This dosing scheme was based on a pharmacokinetic and dose-selection study (Supplementary 
Fig. S3).
In vivo imaging. 
MRI measurements were performed on an 11.7T BioSpec Avance III small animal MR 
system (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with actively shielded gradients of 600 mT/m and oper-
ated by Paravision 5.1 software. We used a circular polarized volume resonator for signal transmission and an 
actively decoupled mouse brain quadrature surface coil for signal reception (Bruker BioSpin). The levels of 
anaesthesia and mouse physiological parameters were monitored following an established protocol65. Briefly, 
during the MR experiments, low-dose isoflurane was used (control mice 3.5% for induction and ~1.5% for 
maintenance, Ndufs4−
/− mice 2.0% for induction and 0.5% for maintenance), slightly adjusted throughout the 
experiment to maintain a fast and stable breathing frequency (control and Ndufs4−
/− mice >75 bpm). The mice 
were placed in a stereotactic device in order to immobilize the head. Body temperature was measured with a 
rectal thermometer and maintained at 37 °C for control and 35–36 °C for Ndufs4−
/− mice by a heated air flow 
device. After standard adjustments and shimming, diffusion of water was imaged as described previously55, 66. 
In short, twenty axial slices covering the whole brain were acquired with a four-shot SE-EPI protocol. B0 shift

artifacts were implemented. Encoding b-factors of 0 s/mm2 (b0 images; 5×
) and 1039 s/mm2 were used and

first realigned with SPM mouse toolbox, to compensate for small movement artifacts; thereafter, the datasets 
were spatially normalized to a study-specific template through linear affine and non-linear diffeomorphic trans-
formation using ANTs. Following these pre-processing steps, the diffusion tensor was estimated for every voxel 
using the PATCH algorithm67. Region of interest (ROIs) were drawn by bilaterally (left and right hemisphere) 
for the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, external capsule and cerebral peduncle. For the corpus 
callosum, only one ROI was drawn. The selection of ROIs was partly based on the ROIs previously described56 
and the anatomical mouse brain atlas (Franklin & Paxinos). No differences in FA values were observed between 
the left and right hemisphere.
Histology and electron microscopy. 
Brains were dissected and post fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Using 
MultiBrain® technology, twenty brains were embedded together into a single gelatin block and freeze-sectioned 
at 35 µm in the coronal plane through the area of interest. Areas of interest were based on the Franklin&Paxinos 
Mouse Brain Atlas. Amino Cupric Silver stain was performed, on every 12th section spaced at 420 µm intervals, 
by the Neuro Science Associations services by standard methods. The 4HNE stain was performed in our lab by 
using the anti-4-Hydroxynonenal antibody (ab46545, dilution 1:100). Quantification of positive 4HNE staining 
was performed using Image J software.
Mouse eyes were enucleated, embedded in OCT (Optical Cutting Temperature compound, Tissue-Tek, Sakura 
Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen. Cryosections of 7 µm were dried for 1 h at room temperature, fixed in 2% 
PFA, washed in PBS, permeabilized for 20 min in 0.01% Tween in PBS and blocked for 30 min (0.1% ovalbumin 
and 0.5% fish gelatine in PBS). Anti-NeuN (Millipore, Billerica, MA) mouse monoclonal antibody was used as 
primary antibody (dilution 1:50 in blocking solution). Retinas were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary 
antibody. Subsequently, sections were washed in PBS (3 ×
 10 minutes), incubated for 45 min at room temperature 
with the corresponding Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) and DAPI (1:8000), washed in PBS 
(3 ×
 10 minutes), and mounted using Prolong Gold antifade kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Pictures were 
taken with Axio Imager (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) microscope. Ganglion cell counting was performed using 
Image J software68 by measuring two parameters: i) the length of the layer by drawing a line following the ganglion 
cell layer (GCL) from one side of the picture until the other one and ii) the amount of DAPI and NeuN-positive 
cells in the GCL. Results were expressed in ganglion cells per inch ± SEM.
Soleus muscle for electron microscopy was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 M sodium caco-
dylate pH 7.4, post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in palade buffer pH 7.4 with 1% potassium ferrocyanide 
(K4Fe(CN)6.3H20) and after dehydration in ethanol and propylene oxide, embedded in Epon. Semi-thin, 0.5 µm 
thick transverse sections were stained with 1% Toluidine blue. Ultra-thin sections were stained with uranyl ace-
tate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1400. Soleus muscle for histochemistry was snap frozen, PAS, Sudan 
Black, Gomori trichrome, NADH, SDH, COX and ATPase staining was performed following standard methods, 
described previously.
Behavioral assessments. 
Ndufs4−
/− mice (KH176 or vehicle treated) and control mice were scored on 
disease progression, rotarod performance, body weight, and life span (n = 12–15). Phenotypic scoring started at 
PD30 and consisted of three measurements, which were performed daily for the quantification of disease severity, 
including the Ledge test (direct measure of coordination), hind limb clasping (marker for disease progression), 
and kyphosis (characteristic dorsal curvature of the spine, caused by loss of muscle tone). Each measure was 
recorded on a scale of 0–3, with 0 representing an absence of disease phenotype and 3 representing severely 
affected. Three scores are combined in a total of 0–9 indicated as phenotypic score. The rotarod paradigm was 
designed to give a quantitative readout of motor capabilities in rodents. The rotarod (Hugo Sachs Elektronik/
Harvard Instruments, Germany) accelerated from 4 to 40 RPM over the course of 5 minutes. The test consisted of 
a training period, during which the animals were exposed to the rotating rod, set at a constant 4 RPM. After the 
training period, the animals were tested a total of three times on the accelerating rotarod, with a 2 minute resting 
period in between each trial. The average time to fall from the rod (sec) was used as the readout parameter. Gait 
analysis was performed by using the CatWalk (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands), which is an automated 
system to objectively assess neurological function in rodents. At PD21, mice were habituated to the CatWalk with 
their cage mates for 10 min during four consecutive days. Weekly testing was performed individually in the dark, 
starting at PD30. A session was successful after completing four compliant runs, which met the criteria set at a 
maximum run duration of 15 seconds. Run speed and maximum variation of run speed were calculated. Six dif-
ferent normal step sequence patterns can be recognized in rodents, depending on the sequential placement of the 
four paws. Step sequence represents the number of patterns that fall within the normal step sequence patterns and 
is used as an indicator of inter-limb coordination. Mean maximum intensity for each paw was calculated at PD40. 
Relative duration of simultaneous contact with the glass plate was measured for different paw combinations.
LC-MSMS. 
The LC-MSMS system consisted of an HPLC (Accela®, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA), 
a quaternary ultra high pressure pump, a vacuum degasser and an autosampler, coupled to a (TSQ Vantage®, 
Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Chromatographic conditions: 
Liquid Chromatographic (LC) separation was performed using a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 analytical column 
(Rapid Resolution HD 1.8  μ
m; 50 ×
 2.1 mm, Agilent, USA) coupled with a UHPLC Guard Zorbax Eclipse Plus

C18 pre-column (1.8 µm; 5 ×
 2.1 mm, Agilent). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid 
(HCOOH) in water) and solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid (HCOOH) in acetonitrile). Chromatography was 
performed at an oven temperature of 40 °C. The sample injection volume was 10 µL and the analysis run time 
was 5 minutes. The samples were stored at a tray temperature of 15 °C. Mass Spectrometric Conditions: the 
compound-dependent parameters were optimized for the target compound to achieve the highest instrument 
response. MS parameters using positive ion mode were optimized to achieve good sensitivity for the compound 
in one single analytical run. The operating conditions were optimized by direct infusion of a 1 µM mixture of 
all analytics. Heated electrospray ionization (HESI) was operated at a spray voltage of + 3.0 kV, a capillary tem-
perature of 200 °C and a vaporizer temperature of 390 °C. Nitrogen was used as sheath and auxiliary gas with 
a gas pressure of 40 and 35 AU (Arbitrary Units), respectively. Argon was used as collision gas at a pressure of 
1.5 mTorr. During the LC–HESI–MS/MS analysis, a time-segment program was developed to switch the divert 
valve of the mobile phase to waste or detection mode to prevent ion suppression and contamination of the ion 
source. The analytics were monitored in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode.
Respiratory complex assays. 
The activities of the individual respiratory chain complexes, citrate syn-
thase (CS) and total protein in the brain tissue homogenates were measured spectrophotometrically, as described 
before69, 70. Measurements were only accepted if each of the duplicate values was within a 10% range of their 
average.
Statistical analysis. 
All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. Kruskal-Wallis or mul-
tivariate ANOVA tests followed by bonferroni post-hoc testing for multiple comparisons were used (*p < 0.05, 
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
