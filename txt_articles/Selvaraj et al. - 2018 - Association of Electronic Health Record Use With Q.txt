Background-—Adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has increased significantly across the nation. Whether EHR use
has translated into improved quality of care and outcomes in heart failure (HF) is not well studied.
Methods and Results-—We examined participants from the Get With The Guidelines—HF registry who were admitted with HF in
2008 (N=21 222), using various degrees of EHR implementation (no EHR, partial EHR, and full EHR). We performed multivariable
logistic regression to determine the relation between EHR status and several in-hospital quality metrics and outcomes. In a
substudy of Medicare participants (N=8421), we assessed the relation between EHR status and rates of 30-day mortality,
readmission, and a composite outcome. In the cohort, the mean age was 71�15 years, 49% were women, and 64% were white.
The mean ejection fraction was 39�17%. Participants were admitted to hospitals with no EHR (N=1484), partial EHR (N=13 473),
and full EHR (N=6265). There was no association between EHR status and several quality metrics (aside from b blocker at
discharge) or in-hospital outcomes on multivariable adjusted logistic regression (P>0.05 for all comparisons). In the Medicare
cohort, there was no association between EHR status and 30-day mortality, readmission, or the combined outcome.
Conclusions-—In a large registry of hospitalized patients with HF, there was no association between degrees of EHR
implementation and several quality metrics and 30-day postdischarge death or readmission. Our results suggest that EHR may not
be sufficient to improve HF quality or related outcomes. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008158. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.

Key Words: electronic health records • heart failure • quality • readmission
A
doption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has
increased significantly across the nation. This has been,
in part, driven by the implementation of the Health Informa-
tion Technology for Economic Clinical Health Act, adopted in
2009 and enacted in 2011 to promote the meaningful use of
health information technology systems. Under the Health
Information Technology for Economic Clinical Health Act,
healthcare providers were offered financial incentives to
adopt EHR systems by 2015. The Health Information Tech-
nology for Economic Clinical Health Act recognizes numerous
theoretical benefits of EHR use, including improvement of
care
coordination,
reduction
of
healthcare
disparities,
decreased medication errors, and efficient and rapid analysis
of quality measures. Heart failure (HF) is the most common
admission diagnosis among Medicare recipients, and read-
mission rates unfortunately remain high.1 The approach to
reduce HF disease burden has been multifaceted, and use of
the EHR may improve the HF morbidity and mortality through
improved quality of care. Whether these theoretic benefits
translate into actual improvements in patient care is of vital
interest from clinical, economic, and policy perspectives.
Few data are available describing whether EHR use might
improve the quality of care delivered and ultimately reduce
readmissions in HF.2 A prior study of patients with HF
suggested that EHR adoption did not improve quality metrics,
readmission,
or
mortality.3

 characteristics (important for adjustment in analyses) were
lacking, minimal process measures were collected, and the
study used older available data. In IMPROVE-HF (Registry to
Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in
the Outpatient Setting) study, EHR use among outpatient
cardiology/multispecialty practices demonstrated modest
differences in only a few metrics of quality improvement.2
EHR use, in some studies, has increased “alert fatigue” and
hindered workflow and provider interaction, which might
temper any potential benefits.4 In addition, implemented
algorithms may not be adequate to achieve quality improve-
ment goals. Therefore, the benefit of EHR implementation is
not a foregone conclusion.
Therefore, we analyzed data from Get With The Guidelines
—HF (GWTG-HF), a national registry of hospitalized patients
with HF with comprehensive data on quality metrics. We
sought to determine whether implementation of EHR was
associated with improved quality of care and reduced
mortality during hospital admission as well as lower 30-day
risk of readmission or mortality in patients with HF.
Methods
Study Population and Design
Details about the method of GWTG-HF have been previously
reported.5 In brief, GWTG-HF is an ongoing in-hospital quality
improvement program that aims to promote adherence to
guideline-directed care for patients admitted with HF. Hospi-
tals enroll in GWTG-HF on a voluntary basis and submit
detailed clinical information for each consecutive patient
admitted with the primary diagnosis of HF using an Internet-
based Patient Management Tool (Quintiles, Cambridge, MA),
in which patient data are deidentified. The centers participat-
ing in GWTG-HF are required to obtain institutional review
board approval for the GWTG-HF protocol and are granted a
waiver for informed consent under the common rule. The
aggregate deidentified data are analyzed at the Duke Clinical
Research Institute (Durham, NC), which serves as the data
analysis center. Institutional review board approval was
obtained for the analysis. Study data are confidential and
cannot be shared, according to the terms of the contracts
signed between participating hospitals and the American
Heart Association, as well as terms governing the use of
Medicare claims data. Therefore, the data, analytic methods,
and study materials will not be made available to other
researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or
replicating the procedure.
We linked data on the use of EHRs from the American
Hospital Association Health Information Technology annual
survey6 to the GWTG-HF database. Survey respondents report
the degree of adoption for each of 24 individual electronic
functionalities. Hospitals were considered to have full EHR
implementation if they met the criteria for at least a basic EHR
on the basis of 8 key functionalities, as defined in prior
studies.6,7
We first analyzed patients admitted to the hospital in 2008
and excluded those patients admitted to hospitals with limited
participation in GWTG-HF (identified by >25% missing medical
history or sex), missing EHR status (N=4039), or nontradi-
tional discharge (discharge to hospice, discharge status
missing, left against medical advice, undocumented discharge
status, or transfer out; N=1201), leaving 21 222 patients for
analysis. To obtain longitudinal data for subgroup analysis on
readmission rates and all-cause mortality, GWTG-HF registry
was merged with claims from Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services from February 1, 2008, through February 1,
2009, and follow-up was attempted through a 30-day period.
A total of 8421 patients were successfully merged with
Medicare Part A inpatient claims by admission and discharge
dates, hospital, date of birth, and sex (as has been performed
previously in GWTG analyses).8
Clinical Characteristics and Outcome Variables
Detailed patient-level information on demographics, insur-
ance, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, length of stay,
admission laboratory testing, ejection fraction, discharge
treatment and counseling, discharge destination, and in-
hospital mortality was collected. Hospital-level characteristics
included number of beds, teaching hospital status, and rural
versus urban location. Numerous quality checks for data
abstraction have been previously described.7
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Few data are available describing whether electronic health
record (EHR) use might improve the quality of care delivered
and ultimately reduce readmissions in patients with heart
failure.
• Using high-quality registry data from Get With The Guide-
lines—Heart Failure, we found that EHR use was not
associated
with
improved
quality
of care,
in-hospital
outcomes, or postdischarge events.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Although the EHR offers numerous theoretical benefits, our
study questions assumptions about EHR implementation
and improved quality of care among patients with heart
failure.
• Our work should encourage increasing attention to EHR
optimization in the current era of EHR technology.

 The primary outcome of the study was a defect-free
composite quality score. The defect-free care variable is a
measure that required individuals receive all of the process
measures for which they were eligible.9 These process
measures
included
the
following:
angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker at discharge,
bblocker at discharge, aldosterone antagonist therapy at
discharge, anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation at
discharge, smoking cessation counseling, and deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis.9
Secondary end points included the individual quality
metrics, hospital length of stay, discharge location (home
versus other), and in-hospital mortality. On longitudinal
analysis, we also analyzed the postdischarge outcomes in
the subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries measured at 30 days,
including all-cause hospitalization or all-cause mortality, all-
cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. If a patient has
multiple hospitalizations logged in the registry, only the first
hospitalization was considered for analysis. All-cause mortal-
ity was based on death dates in Medicare denominator files,
and readmission was based on Medicare inpatient claims
using diagnostic-related group codes.8
Statistical Analysis
Cross-sectional analysis
Patient- and hospital-level characteristics as well as perfor-
mance measures were displayed by EHR use (none, partial, or
full implementation). Data were compared between groups
using ANOVA for normally distributed continuous variables (or
nonparametric equivalent when appropriate). v2 Tests (or
Fisher’s exact test when appropriate) were used to compare
categorical variables between groups. Trend tests were used
for comparisons. Continuous data with a normal distribution
were displayed as mean�SD. Skewed data were presented as
median and 25th to 75th percentile.
To examine the association of EHR with hospital-level
defect-free composite score and patient-level care measures,
we performed unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic
regression models with generalized estimating equations with
the following rationale: Patients from a given hospital have
shared commonalities (eg, same geographic area and treating
physicians) compared with patients from a different hospital.
Therefore, such a clustering of patients within specific
hospitals necessitates the use of hierarchical models or
mixed-effects models to provide unbiased and reliable esti-
mates
of
the
parameters
of
interest.
The
generalized
estimating equations technique takes such a clustering of
patients within hospitals into account to provide unbiased
parameter estimates and robust variance estimations for
statistical inference. For these analyses, the referent arm was
no EHR use. Covariates for multivariable analysis included
age, sex, race, medical history (anemia, ischemic history,
cardiovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease or asthma, peripheral vascular disease,
renal insufficiency, and cigarette smoking in past year), vital
signs on admission (systolic blood pressure, heart rate,
sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and left ventricular ejection
fraction), and hospital characteristics (region, teaching hos-
pital status, number of beds, rural versus urban, and heart
transplant center status).10
Survival analysis
To determine associations between EHR implementation and
30-day postdischarge outcomes (all-cause readmission or
mortality, all-cause readmission, and mortality), we performed
univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards anal-
yses and used robust variance estimation to account for
hospital clustering. The proportional hazard assumption was
checked and confirmed, and the referent group included
patients admitted to hospitals with no EHR. Patients who died
before experiencing a hospitalization were censored for
analyses using all-cause readmission as the single outcome.
For readmission outcomes, the method of Fine and Gray was
used to account for the competing risk of mortality. Kaplan-
Meier curves were constructed for 30-day readmission and
mortality.11
In all multivariable models, multiple imputation with 25
imputations was used to impute non–hospital-level missing
covariates. Our multiple imputation method assumed that
missing data are missing at random. Therefore, we used the
multiple imputation by chained equations algorithm, which is
flexible and can be used in many settings, especially in the
absence of a clear monotone pattern of missing data.12,13
Because of the missing at random assumption, we have
multiply imputed missing patient-level covariates and out-
comes (there were no missing hospital-level characteristics).
A 2-sided P≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
Duke Clinical Research Institute performed all analyses using
SAS software, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 white. More than half the patients were insured by Medicare.
Comorbidities were common, including hypertension (77%),
hyperlipidemia (43%), diabetes mellitus (43%), and atrial
fibrillation or flutter (32%). Long-term medication use reflected
standard therapies used in the comorbidities detailed in
Table 1. Blood pressure was mildly elevated (141�31/
77�19 mm Hg), and the mean body mass index was
29.2�7.7 kg/m2. The median (25th–75th percentile) B-type
natriuretic peptide level was 778 (343–1647) pg/mL, and
most patients had a reduced ejection fraction (39�17%).
Patients were admitted to mostly teaching hospitals (76%).
Table 2 shows unadjusted rates of implementation of
several quality metrics as well as in-hospital outcomes by EHR
status. Increasing EHR implementation was associated with
improved patient outcomes (higher rates of discharge home
and less frequent length of stay >4 days). However, increas-
ing EHR implementation was also associated with worse rates
of several achievement measures (smoking cessation coun-
seling, aldosterone antagonist, anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation, and evidence-based b blockers).
Association of EHR With Quality Metrics and In-
Hospital Outcomes
Table 3 shows the association of EHR status with predefined
quality metrics and in-hospital outcomes on unadjusted and
multivariable-adjusted analysis. The referent arm for compar-
ison was admission to hospital with no EHR. There was no
association between EHR status and any quality metric or in-
hospital outcome on unadjusted logistic regression (P>0.05
for all comparisons). Adjustment for several potential con-
founders yielded similar results, aside from an association
between b blocker at discharge when comparing partial EHR
with no EHR (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–
5.98), although the association was not significant when
comparing full EHR with no EHR (odds ratio, 1.87; 95%
confidence interval, 0.78–4.48).
The Figure displays Kaplan-Meier curves by EHR status for
30-day outcomes (mortality, readmission, and a combined
outcome) among Medicare participants. There was no differ-
ence in the 3 EHR groups with respect to each outcome
(P>0.05 for all comparisons by log-rank test). Table 4 shows
the hazard ratios comparing full and partial EHR status
(compared with no EHR). All models were adjusted for the
same covariates used in previous logistic regression. There
was no association between EHR status and 30-day event
rates (P>0.05 for all comparisons).
Discussion
In a large national registry of >20 000 participants admitted
with HF, we found that there was no association between EHR
status and patient-level quality metrics or in-hospital out-
comes. In a subgroup of Medicare patients with available
longitudinal data, we similarly found no association between
EHR status and 30-day event rates, including death, readmis-
sion, or a combined outcome. Our study is one of the largest
of EHR use in HF and provides insight into the use of EHR to
improve patient care. Given the millions of patients with HF
and its large toll on both patient quality of life and economic
burden, our results suggest that the EHR may not be sufficient
to improve HF-related outcomes.
EHR is a tool in increasingly complex hospital infrastruc-
tures, and recent studies have shown that providers spend a

 substantial amount of daily workflow interacting with a more
contemporary form of the EHR than studied herein.14 There-
fore, we do not contend, on the basis of our results, that EHR
should not be adopted. Rather, our findings underscore the
need for improved use of EHR or refinement of its clinical
decision support and algorithm construction. For example, we
now have several effective therapies in the treatment of HF
(particularly HF with reduced ejection fraction), although
implementation into clinical practice is still not uniform among
patients eligible for therapy. As such, EHRs, through clinical
decision support systems, hold substantial promise to increase
delivery of these therapies.15 However, our study showed
improvement in only one metric (b blocker at discharge)
associated with EHR use, but not in other quality metrics, in-
hospital events, or postdischarge outcomes. Because adoption
of EHR is an extremely costly endeavor and expected to grow,
such analysis of the magnitude of its utility on quality
improvement is crucial and provides ongoing feedback on
public policy implementation.
Other studies of EHR use in the HF population have
reported conflicting outcomes. In an analysis of outpatients
with HF and reduced ejection fraction, there was only a
modest
association
between
EHR
and
several
quality
measures.2 Although important, this analysis did not include
in-hospital outcomes or postdischarge events. Our results are
concordant
with
analyses
involving
general
medical
patients16,17 as well as patients with stroke.7 Why the EHR
may not improve quality of care or outcomes in HF is possibly
multifactorial. EHR, in itself, can have unintended effects
on
medication
error
risks,18
mortality,19
and
provider
satisfaction.20 Therefore, although there may be benefits of
EHR, including streamlining many facets of patient care or
consolidation of patient-level data, more attention must be
paid to these unintended adverse effects. Although there are
some notable studies showing improvement in quality metrics
with EHR use in a more general population, they are older and
likely studied less sophisticated EHR systems.21,22 In addition,
secular trends in attention to quality metrics may marginalize
the effects of the EHR system. For example, the implemen-
tation of a performance-improvement system increased the
use of recommended HF therapies among outpatient cardi-
ology practices. However, practices that used EHR did not
achieve greater quality improvements than practices that
were paper based.23
EHR adoption has increased substantially since the passing
of the Health Information Technology for Economic Clinical
Health Act in 2009. Adoption is near universal in GWTG-HF
participating hospitals in the present day. Therefore, our
analysis was limited to data from 2008, which allowed us to
study the effects of the various degrees of EHR adoption and
several quality metrics and outcomes. Our study questions
assumptions about EHR implementation and improved quality
of care and should draw increasing attention to EHR
optimization in the current era of EHR technology.
Our results should be interpreted in the context of a few
limitations. First, our study is limited to hospitals participat-
ing in GWTG-HF, a voluntary quality improvement program
across the United States dedicated to improving outcomes
for patients admitted with HF, as well as those hospitals
participating in the American Hospital Association annual
survey. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to
nonparticipating
hospitals.

means of improving quality of care for patients with HF
(clinician education, admission of patients with HF to
specialized services, or comprehensive review of patient
medications by pharmacists). Also, this study did not
evaluate gains or losses in patient health status and
satisfaction nor gains or losses in clinician productivity,
satisfaction, and turnover associated with EHR use. Finally,
we did not have information on the specific EHR systems

 being used as well as information on order entry, clinical
decision support, and other components.
Conclusions
In a large study of patients admitted with HF across the
United States, EHR use was not associated with improved
quality of care on the basis of several predefined metrics, in-
hospital outcomes, or postdischarge events. Our results
suggest the EHR may not be sufficient to improve HF-related
outcomes. Further research is necessary to define optimal
implementation of EHR technology in hospital practice.
