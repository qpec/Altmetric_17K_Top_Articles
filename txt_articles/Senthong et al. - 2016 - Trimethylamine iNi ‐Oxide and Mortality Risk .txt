Background-—Production of the proatherogenic metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), from dietary nutrients by intestinal
microbiota enhances atherosclerosis development in animal models and is associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
in humans. The utility of studying plasma levels of TMAO to risk stratify in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) has not
been reported.
Methods and Results-—We examined the relationship between fasting plasma TMAO and all-cause mortality (5-year), stratified by
subtypes of PAD and presence of coronary artery disease in 935 patients with PAD who underwent elective angiography for cardiac
evaluation at a tertiary care hospital. Median plasma TMAO was 4.8 lmol/L (interquartile range, 2.9–8.0 lmol/L). Elevated TMAO
levels were associated with 2.7-fold increased mortality risk (fourth versus first quartiles, hazard ratio 2.86, 95% CI 1.82–3.97,
P<0.001). Following adjustments for traditional risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and history of coronary artery disease, the
highest TMAO quartile remained predictive of 5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.06, 95% CI 1.36–3.11, P<0.001). Similar
prognostic value for elevated TMAO was seen for subjects with carotid artery, non–carotid artery, or lower extremity PAD. TMAO
provided incremental prognostic value for all-cause mortality (net reclassification index, 40.22%; P<0.001) and improvement in
area under receiver operator characteristic curve (65.7% versus 69.4%; P=0.013).
Conclusions-—TMAO, a pro-atherogenic metabolite formed by gut microbes, predicts long-term adverse event risk and incremental
prognostic value in patients with PAD. These findings point to the potential for TMAO to help improve selection of high-risk PAD
patients with or without significant coronary artery disease, who likely need more aggressive and specific dietary and
pharmacologic therapy. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e004237 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.004237)

ncreasing data support a role of gut microbiota and dietary
ingestion of phosphatidylcholine (PC or lecithin) in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.1,2 PC is the major dietary
source of choline, which often is found in the Western diet,
such as red meat, eggs, and meat products. Production of
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by gut microbiota metabolism
of dietary PC has been associated with the development of
atherosclerosis in animals and in humans.1–3 Increased levels
of plasma TMAO are associated with an enhanced number of
diseased major coronary vessels,1 as well as increased risk of
major adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing elective
coronary angiography.3,4
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common manifestation
of systemic atherosclerosis and is associated with significantly
increased cardiovascular death and mortality.5,6 It affects over
27 million people across Europe and North America.7 An
estimated 8.5 million Americans aged ≥40 years carry the
diagnosis of PAD.8 Despite its association with high preva-
lence and extremely poor prognosis, PAD remains undiag-
nosed and rarely receives attention in the scientific literature
compared to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and
other atherosclerotic conditions.7,9 To date, predictors of
mortality and underlying pathophysiology in patients with PAD
are not well defined, which may be a contributing factor to why
the mortality risk and ischemic amputations in PAD patients
remained high.10 Therefore, there is a need to find new
prognostic markers that may provide insight into underlying
pathophysiology, improve long-term clinical risk prediction

therapeutic development in PAD. The primary objective of this
study was to determine the clinical prognostic value of plasma
TMAO levels in a contemporary cohort of patients with
established but stable PAD.
Methods
Study Design and Study Population
This is a single-center prospective cohort study approved by
the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all
participants gave written informed consent. We enrolled
sequential consenting patients who underwent elective,
nonurgent coronary angiographic evaluation at the Cleveland
Clinic between 2001 and 2007, as previously described. All
patients were seen by a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic before
the left heart catheterization. Enrolled subjects were directly
asked by research personal about past history of non-CAD
cardiovascular disease and/or history of or repair of aortic
dissection/aneurysm. We carefully reviewed the electronic
medical record (including angiographic data) for validation of
diagnosis subtypes of PAD. A confirmed diagnosis of PAD was
based primarily on the type of PAD, based on reporting
evidence of stenosis at the corresponding vasculature
(Table 1).11–13 All-cause mortality was prospectively tracked
over 5 years for all participants with medical chart review and
confirmed by follow-up contact and the Social Security Death
Index. In this analysis, we included those with a documented
history of PAD.
Diagnosis Validation of PAD Subtypes

 artery stenosis (RAS), mesenteric artery stenosis (MAS), and
lower extremity peripheral artery disease (LEAD).6,12 However,
The European Society of Cardiology uses the term PAD to
include several vascular sites, including extracranial carotid
artery stenosis (CAS) and vertebral artery diseases, upper
extremity artery stenosis, MAS, RAS, and LEAD, but diseases
of the aorta are not covered.13 In our cohort, the term PAD is
used to indicate the majority of noncoronary arterial territo-
ries including CAS, upper extremity artery stenosis, MAS,
RAS, and LEAD, while diseases of the aorta were not included.
In this analysis, we defined non-CAS if the primary diagnosis
was not CAS (which included LEAD, RAS, upper extremity
artery stenosis, and MAS).
Laboratory Testing
After informed consent was obtained from all patients, fasting
blood samples were collected using EDTA tubes at the time of
cardiac catheterization, immediately prior to heparin injection.
Samples were maintained on ice or at 4°C, immediately
processed within 3 hours of collection, and frozen at �80°C
until analysis. Creatinine clearance was estimated using the
Cockcroft-Gault equation. Myeloperoxidase was determined
by the CardioMPO assay (Cleveland Heart Labs, Cleveland,
OH). TMAO, choline, and betaine levels in plasma were
determined using stable isotope dilution high-performance
liquid chromatography with online electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometry on Shimadzu LCMS-8050 CL
Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp, Kyoto,
Japan) using d9-(trimethyl)-labeled internal standards as
described previously.1,14
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data are presented as mean (�SD) or median
(interquartile range) and compared with Student t test and
ANOVA or nonparametric alternatives (Kruskal–Wallis test)
when appropriate. Categorical variables are presented as
number (%) and compared between groups with v2 tests.
We divided plasma TMAO levels into quartiles. Kaplan–Meier
analysis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used
for the time-to-event analysis to determine hazard ratios
(HR) and 95% CI for 5-year all-cause mortality stratified
according to TMAO as a continuous variable (log-trans-
formed per SD increase), as well as according to quartiles.
Adjustments were made for individual traditional cardiovas-
cular
risk
factors
(age,
sex,
systolic
blood
pressure,
diabetes mellitus, low-density and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and smoking status)
and for log-transformed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP), log-transformed estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR), log-transformed myeloperoxidase, apolipoprotein A-1
and apolipoprotein B, history of CAD, and statin use, to
predict all-cause mortality. Category-free net reclassification
improvement, Integrated Discrimination Improvement, and
area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were
calculated to quantify improvement in model performance
according to mortality risk estimated using Cox models
adjusted for the abovementioned traditional risk factors
with
versus
without
TMAO,
as
previously
described.15
Subgroups were stratified according to diagnosis subtypes
of PAD (LEAD, CAS, and non-CAS) as well as other baseline
clinical and laboratory subgroups that might be affecting
mortality risks. All analyses were performed used R 2.15.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A
P value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistically
significant.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
In our study cohort, a total of 935 subjects had reported a
history of PAD. Of these, confirmed diagnosis data were not
available for 14 patients, and 100 patients with a diagnosis of
aortic aneurysm were excluded. Therefore, 821 consecutive
patients were included in this study. Baseline characteristics
of the 821 participants are shown in Table 2. In our study
cohort, the median TMAO level was 4.8 lmol/L (interquartile
range 2.9–8.0 lmol/L), which was similar between patients
with CAS and non-CAS (Figure 1). Subjects with elevated
plasma TMAO levels were more likely to be older, with
diabetes, with elevated hsCRP, as well as with lower eGFR. In
contrast, prior history of CAD, smoking status, myeloperox-
idase levels, apolipoprotein B levels, and medication use, were
similar across TMAO levels.
Of the 821 subjects included, 371 had diagnosis of CAS
confirmed by duplex ultrasonography (83%), magnetic reso-
nance
angiography
(2.7%),
catheter-based
radiocontrast
angiography (4.0%), prior endovascular intervention (3.8%),
and open carotid endarterectomy (6.5%); 421 patients had
LEAD confirmed by the following: ankle–brachial index <0.9
(65.5%), duplex ultrasonography (7.0%), computed tomogra-
phy angiography (1.5%), magnetic resonance angiography
(0.5%),
catheter-based

(8.8%),
and

surgical procedure (9.0%); 15 patients had RAS confirmed
by magnetic resonance angiography (20%), catheter-based
radiocontrast angiography (53%), and prior endovascular
intervention (27%); 13 patients had upper extremity artery
stenosis confirmed by catheter-based radiocontrast angiog-
raphy (38.5%), and prior endovascular intervention (61.5%),
and 1 patient had MAS confirmed by prior endovascular
intervention (Figure 2).

 TMAO Levels and Mortality Risks
Over the 5-year follow-up, 222 (27%) deaths occurred in our
cohort. Nineteen patients (19/821=2%) were not reached at
5-year follow-up. As illustrated in the Kaplan–Meier analyses
shown in Figure 3, a graded increase in risk for all-cause
mortality was observed with increasing plasma levels of
TMAO. Elevated plasma TMAO levels were associated with a
2.7-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality (unadjusted
HR=2.69, 95% CI 1.82–3.97, P<0.001) (Table 3). Following
adjustments for traditional risk factors, history of CAD, statin
use, and inflammatory marker including log-transformed
myeloperoxidase, log-transformed hsCRP and apolipoprotein
A-1 and apolipoprotein B,, elevated plasma TMAO levels
remained a significant predictor of the risk of 5-year all-cause
mortality (adjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.21–2.92, P=0.002), as
well as after adjusting for traditional risk factor, log-
transformed hsCRP, and log-transformed eGFR (adjusted
HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03–2.45, P=0.038) (Table 3). A similar
graded increase in risk was observed when levels of TMAO
were analyzed as a continuous variable in increments of 1 SD
(unadjusted HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35–1.74, P<0.001) and
remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factor,
log-transformed hsCRP and log-transformed eGFR (adjusted
HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03–1.53, P=0.016). The inclusion of TMAO
as a covariate resulted in a significant improvement in risk
estimation over traditional risk factors (net reclassification
improvement, 40.22%, [P<0.001]; Integrated Discrimination
Improvement, 10.0%, [P<0.001]; and differences in area
under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 65.69
versus 69.42, P=0.013). Interestingly, mortality risks were
similar between PAD diagnosis subgroups (between CAS,
non-CAS, and LEAD), as well as other clinical and laboratory
subgroups

Discussion
To our knowledge, this represents the first report of elevated
plasma TMAO levels as a significant prognostic marker in
patients with a PAD. Our major finding is that elevated plasma

TMAO and Mortality Risk in PAD

 TMAO is a significant predictor of 5-year all-cause mortality
risk among stable patients with a PAD. Moreover, mortality
risks were not significantly different among all different
subtypes of diagnosis of PAD, presence or absence of CAD, as
well as other clinical and laboratory subgroups.
The role of gut microbiota is increasingly being accepted as
an environmental factor that affects global metabolism of
their host and contributes to associated pathological condi-
tions, such as obesity, insulin resistance, chronic kidney
disease, and cardiovascular disease.1–3,16,17 Our recent
studies in animals and in humans suggested a role for gut
microbiota
in
the
pathogenesis
of
atherosclerosis.1,2
Trimethylamine-containing nutrients (eg, PC, choline, and
L-carnitine) are metabolized by the gut microbiota to trimethy-
lamine (TMA) and converted to TMAO.1 PC is a major dietary
source of choline in omnivores, which often is found in the
Western diet, such as red meat, eggs, and meat products.
Direct ingestion of PC was shown to result in a rise in choline,
betaine, and TMAO levels.1,3 Moreover, previous studies have
report that elevated plasma TMAO levels predicted future risk
of major adverse cardiovascular events and have a direct
mechanistic link to development of cardiovascular disease.1–4
Extending these observations, in the present prospective
study focused exclusively on patients with adjudicated
diagnosis of PAD, an upper quartile for TMAO levels
(compared with the lowest quartile) had a significant, 1.6-
fold increased risk for future all-cause mortality, independent
of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation mark-
ers, and eGFR.
Additional studies demonstrated that the mechanism
through which dietary PC or choline enhances atherosclerosis
in mouse models requires the presence of intact gut
microbiota and formation of TMAO.1,2 Furthermore, in a study
examining plasma carnitine, choline, or betaine levels in
sequential subjects undergoing elective coronary angiogra-
phy, each was associated with future risk of major adverse
cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors.

 However, their prognostic values were restricted only to those
with concomitant increased levels of TMAO, consistent with
this gut microbe metabolite being the proximate and mech-
anistically linked metabolite in the pathway.4 In several recent
studies genetically repressing hepatic flavin monooxygenase
3 expression, the host enzyme primarily responsible for
converting gut microbe–generated TMA into TMAO, choline
diet–enhanced atherosclerosis was inhibited, further impli-
cating
the
TMAO
pathway
in

develop-
ment.18,19 These and other studies have also implicated
FMO3 as an important regulator of body cholesterol and bile
acid metabolism, suggesting mechanistic links between the
gut microbe–TMAO pathway and atherosclerosis pathogene-
sis.18–20 Interestingly, TMAO can promote atherosclerosis by
inhibiting reverse cholesterol transport and enhanced macro-
phage foam cell formation in both the artery wall and
peritoneal cavity, as well as promoting aortic root atheroscle-
rotic plaque development.1,2 Recently, exciting new human
data reported by Randrianarisoa et al have found that
increased fasting serum TMAO levels were associated with
increased carotid intima–media thickness, which is a marker
of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, after the lifestyle interven-
tion, carotid intima–media thickness decreased significantly
(P=0.0056) specifically in subjects in the largest decrease
(>20%) of TMAO levels.21 Thus, gut microbial generation of
TMAO from dietary nutrients such as PC may represent an
attractive target for intervention in subjects with PAD.
Patients with PAD show a 2- to 6-fold increased risk of
death from cardiovascular causes and mortality relative to
those
without
PAD.6,8
Data
from
the
Reduction
of
Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry have
shown that PAD is strongly associated with concomitant CAD
and atherosclerosis in multiple vascular beds, and indicated
that these patients have poorer prognosis than patients with
just 1 territory affected.22 It is also recognized that the
majority of patients with PAD die from CAD.5 There are a
number of proven therapies to reduce mortality among
patients with PAD including antiplatelet agents, lipid-lowering
therapy with the statins, and aggressive cardiovascular risk
factor modification.6 Unfortunately, lifesaving medications are
underprescribed among patients with PAD, particularly in
comparison with patients with CAD,23 and also the true
atherosclerosis burden and mortality risk of PAD are under-
estimated.9,10 In contrast, the overall rate of use of cardio-
protective medication for secondary prevention in our study
cohort was relatively high; at baseline 70% were on statins,
76% on aspirin, 69% on b-blockers, and 60% on angiogensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blockers.
Yet, despite patients having received optimal cardioprotective
medication, the 5-year all-cause mortality rate in our study
cohort remained high, with 27% deaths. These higher event
rates may be driven by a large proportion of patients with CAD
(90%). Interestingly, these data are consistent with findings
from the REACH registry, which has a large percentage of
patients with PAD combined with CAD and is associated with
high mortality rates.22 Therefore, accurate risk prediction and
identification for underlying pathophysiology in patients with
PAD is critically meaningful. Our findings suggest a link
between plasma TMAO, a metabolite formed by gut micro-
biota metabolism of the choline group of PC, and prognosis
risk prediction. They may be a new prognostic marker for risk
stratification and suggest avenues for therapeutic develop-
ment to reduce future all-cause mortality in patients with PAD.
Our findings may be important to understand a potential
pathophysiological contribution of intestinal microbiota in the
development of atherosclerosis and adverse prognosis in
patients with PAD, including the majority of noncoronary
territories. Since occult atherosclerotic plaque burden in
extracoronary territories is a common issue hindering PAD
diagnosis, and given the mechanistic links between TMAO and

TMAO and Mortality Risk in PAD

 atherosclerosis development and progression, the present
studies suggest that plasma TMAO level measurements could
be used to identify patients in whom more detailed PAD
surveillance efforts are needed given the heightened adverse
prognosis risk associated with higher TMAO levels. An
improvement in understanding of the pathophysiology linking
gut microbes, TMAO, and PAD development may serve to help
improve selection of high-risk PAD patients who need more
aggressive and specific dietary and pharmacologic therapy.
Study Limitations
This was a single, tertiary care center study that recruited
patients at the point of cardiac evaluation for coronary
angiography; therefore, there was a higher proportion of
patients with CAD. Our population consisted of a heteroge-
neous subgroup of patients with PAD, yet we believe that the
confirmed diagnoses were carefully captured individually.
Also, we lacked complete information regarding New York
Heart Association functional class, claudication symptom, and
disease severity, but we addressed this issue by enrolling
patients in stable condition, confirmed by careful review of the
electronic medical record individually. We also acknowledge
that many factors may have influenced TMAO levels, including
increased age, diabetes, elevated hsCRP, or low eGFR. All of
these factors can contribute to increased mortality in this
population, and we do not have an external validation cohort
to confirm our findings. Despite these limitations, our findings
are the first report to point to novel insights that provide a
mechanistic link between gut microbiota–associated metabo-
lism involved in TMAO formation and PAD, and substantially
improved risk stratification for adverse prognosis in patients
with PAD.
Conclusions
Elevated plasma TMAO levels, a pro-atherogenic metabolite
formed by gut microbiota metabolism of the choline group of
PC, portend stronger incident risk of major adverse cardio-
vascular events and all-cause death in patients with PAD,
independent of traditional risk factors.
