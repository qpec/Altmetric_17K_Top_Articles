IMPORTANCE Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to reveal tumor and
germline mutations of clinical relevance, but the diagnostic yield for pediatric patients with
solid tumors is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the diagnostic yield of combined tumor and germline WES for
children with solid tumors.
DESIGN Unselected children with newly diagnosed and previously untreated central nervous
system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors were prospectively enrolled in the BASIC3 study at a
large academic children’
s hospital during a 23-month period from August 2012 through June
2014. Blood and tumor samples underwent WES in a certified clinical laboratory with genetic
results categorized on the basis of perceived clinical relevance and entered in the electronic
health record.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical categorization of somatic mutations; frequencies of
deleterious germline mutations related to patient phenotype and incidental
medically-actionable mutations.
RESULTS Of the first 150 participants (80 boys and 70 girls, mean age, 7.4 years), tumor
samples adequate for WES were available from 121 patients (81%). Somatic mutations of
established clinical utility (category I) were reported in 4 (3%) of 121 patients, with mutations
of potential utility (category II) detected in an additional 29 (24%) of 121 patients. CTNNB1
was the gene most frequently mutated, with recurrent mutations in KIT, TSC2, and MAPK
pathway genes (BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS) also identified. Mutations in consensus cancer genes
(category III) were found in an additional 24 (20%) of 121 tumors. Fewer than half of somatic
mutations identified were in genes known to be recurrently mutated in the tumor type
tested. Diagnostic germline findings related to patient phenotype were discovered in 15
(10%) of 150 cases: 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic dominant mutations in adult and
pediatric cancer susceptibility genes (including 2 each in TP53, VHL, and BRCA1), 1 recessive
liver disorder with hepatocellular carcinoma (TJP2), and 1 renal diagnosis (CLCN5). Incidental
findings were reported in 8 (5%) of 150 patients. Most patients harbored germline uncertain
variants in cancer genes (98%), pharmacogenetic variants (89%), and recessive carrier
mutations (85%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tumor and germline WES revealed mutations in a broad
spectrum of genes previously implicated in both adult and pediatric cancers. Combined
reporting of tumor and germline WES identified diagnostic and/or potentially actionable
findings in nearly 40% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors.

G
enome-scale sequencing methods such as whole-
exome sequencing (WES) have provided significant in-
sight into the pathogenesis of cancer as well as a wide
spectrum of human diseases.1 Recent studies have begun to
establish the yield of WES for the diagnosis of Mendelian dis-
orders and the discovery of incidental (non–phenotype-
related) medically actionable findings.2-4 However, experi-
ence with the use of these tests in the care of patients with
cancer remains limited.
Sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples can re-
vealmultipletypesofresultswithimplicationsforclinicalprac-
tice. The identification of somatic (tumor-specific) muta-
tions has the potential to offer diagnostic and prognostic
information and inform selection of therapies, particularly for
patientswithrelapsedorrefractorytumors.5Detectionofgerm-
line mutations in cancer susceptibility genes may prompt fur-
ther genetic testing and guide cancer surveillance strategies
for both the patient and family members.6 Germline muta-
tions may also explain noncancer phenotypes, predict drug re-
sponses, or provide reproductive counseling information for
parents (Figure 1).7-11
The BASIC3 (Baylor College of Medicine Advancing Se-
quencing in Childhood Cancer Care) study is a Clinical Se-
quencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium project
funded by the National Genome Human Research Institute
(NHGRI) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) focusing on pro-
spective implementation of clinical WES in the pediatric on-
cology clinic.12 To characterize the diagnostic yield of com-
bined tumor and germline WES for children with newly
diagnosed solid tumors, we report here the results for 150 con-
secutive BASIC3 study patients sequenced in a laboratory cer-
tified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA).
Methods
Study Subjects and Data Collection
The BASIC3 study was approved by the institutional review
board of Baylor College of Medicine. Study enrollment was
offered to all patients having diagnostic tumor surgery or
biopsy at Texas Children’
s Hospital for newly diagnosed and
previously untreated central nervous system (CNS) and
non-CNS solid tumors who had at least 1 English- or
Spanish-speaking parent and planned ongoing oncology
care at Texas Children’
s Cancer Center.7 Written informed
consent was obtained for all study participants. Patients
with benign non-CNS tumors not requiring ongoing oncol-
ogy care were excluded.
At study entry, the study medical geneticist or genetic
counselor reviewed the age, cancer diagnosis, medical rec-
ord (including family history), and parental surveys and
determined whether clinical genetic testing would be con-
sidered as part of routine care, and if so, which specific
test(s) would be used. The Texas Children’
s Hospital elec-
tronic health record was reviewed for all patients as of April
1, 2015, for any germline genetic or molecular tumor testing
ordered.
Study Samples
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from all study pa-
tients and requested from parents. Fresh tumor from pretreat-
ment diagnostic specimens, if available, was snap frozen for
the study by the consultant pathologist. A confirmatory pa-
thology review was conducted for each tumor sample. Study
genetic counselors completed a clinical WES requisition form
for each patient including tumor diagnosis, other medical
diagnoses, and family history.
Whole-Exome Sequencing
Whole-exome sequencing was performed in the CAP- and
CLIA-certified Whole Genome Laboratory at Baylor College
of Medicine following a previously described protocol,2,3
including library construction, exome capture by VCRome,
version 2.113 (Roche NimbleGen), and paired-end sequenc-
ing on an Illumina HiSeq instrument (Illumina Inc). Tumor
and germline library pairs were sequenced on a single lane
of a HiSeq 2000/2500, with a mean coverage of 272× and a
target base coverage of 20× at 97.3%. Germline-only
samples were run 3 per lane.
Variant Calling and Annotation
Data analysis for germline samples was performed as previ-
ously described.2,3 Tumor exomes were similarly analyzed
using the Mercury v.3 pipeline,14 including variant calling and
annotation (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). A somatic variant list
was generated for each patient by subtracting the germline .vcf
from the tumor .vcf and applying somatic filters (eTable 1 in
Supplement2)tothemergedfilewithatumorvariantratiocut-
off of 0.05 or greater. Somatic mutations were annotated with
information from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
(COSMIC)database.15,16AFamCan(FamilialCancer)variantlist
was also populated with germline variants in a list of cancer
predisposition syndrome genes (eTable 2 in Supplement 2) to
allow detection of biallelic mutations (second hits) in the tu-
mor or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in autosomal dominant
cancer genes. An increase in variant allele fraction of 0.20 in
the tumor was considered evidence of LOH.17
Key Points
Question: What is the feasibility and diagnostic yield of clinical
tumor and germline whole-exome sequencing (WES) in an
unselected cohort of children with newly diagnosed solid tumors
of both the central nervous system and elsewhere?
Findings: Somatic mutations of established or potential clinical
utility were identified in 27% of patients, and pathogenic or likely
pathogenic germline mutations in adult and pediatric cancer
susceptibility genes were identified in more than 8% of patients.
Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES identified
diagnostic and/or potentially actionable findings in nearly 40%
of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors.
Meaning: This study highlights the diversity of tumor and
germline results detectable by clinical WES, including many genes
not previously associated with the specific pediatric tumor
diagnosed in the patient.

Data Interpretation, Variant Confirmation,
and Clinical Reporting
Germline variants remaining after filtering were classified and
interpreted in the context of patient phenotype(s) to generate
a germline WES report, as previously described.2,3 For the
present study, these reports included variants confirmed by
Sangersequencingin4categories(Figure1):pathogenicorlikely
pathogenic mutations in disease genes related to cancer sus-
ceptibilityorotherpatientphenotype;variantsofuncertainsig-
nificance (VUS) in phenotype-associated disease genes; inci-
dentalmedicallyactionablemutations(includingthemitochon-
drial genome); and a limited panel of pharmacogenetic variant
alleles.3 Parents were given the option to have their child’
s re-
port include carrier status results for any recessive disorder for
which genetic testing is currently available. Parental blood
samples,ifavailable,underwentSangersequencingforspecific
germline mutations identified in the patient sample. Germline
WES reports did not include disease-associated mutations that
were not considered actionable in the absence of a phenotype.
Somatic and FamCan variants were imported into an in-
house-developed variant review program and subjected to ad-
ditional filters (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 and eTable 1 in
Supplement 2) followed by inspection of read alignments on
the Integrative Genomics Viewer.18 An algorithm for variant
ranking based on perceived clinical utility was used to assign
somatic mutations to 1 of 4 categories (Figure 1 and eTables 3
to 5 in Supplement 2): established clinical utility (I); potential
clinical utility (II); mutations in consensus cancer genes (III);
and all other mutations (IV). For a more detailed description
of the algorithm see eMethods in Supplement 1. Category I to
III somatic mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing
and reported with accompanying interpretative text.
Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact test was used to compare the frequencies of
category I and II somatic mutations in CNS vs non-CNS
tumors and to compare the frequencies of cancer susceptibil-
ity variants between study participants and a cohort of 2000
consecutive germline exomes reported from the Baylor
College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory.3
Results
Patient Characteristics and Samples
Study enrollment began in August 2012. Two hundred eli-
gible patients were identified and offered study enrollment
following a previously reported informed consent process,7
of whom 150 (75%) agreed to participate in the study (eFig-
ure 2 in Supplement 1). Patient clinical characteristics and
demographics are summarized in eTable 6 in Supplement 2.
Enrolled patients were diagnosed with a diverse representa-
tion of pediatric CNS (n = 56, 37%) and non-CNS (n = 94,
63%) solid tumors (Table 1). Blood samples were collected
from all participants, and adequate tumor samples for WES
were obtained from 121 (81%) of the 150 participants,
including 40 (71%) of 56 with CNS tumors and 81 (86%) of
94 with non-CNS tumors (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). The
last WES results described here were reported in September
2014 (n = 150 germline reports and n = 121 tumor reports).

Tumor WES
Aggregating the results from 121 tumor WES reports revealed
validated somatic mutations that were designated as having
established clinical utility (category I) in 4 patients (3%) and
potential utility (category II) in an additional 29 patients (24%)
(Figure 2A and eTables 7 and 8 in Supplement 2). The fraction
of patients with CNS tumors who had category I and II muta-
tions (7 of 40, 17%) was numerically but not statistically lower
than that for non-CNS tumors (26 of 81, 32%) (Figure 2A,
P = .13). The 37 recurrent category I and II mutations de-
tected included CTNNB1 (in 10 of 121 participants, 8.3%), BRAF
(5of121,4.1%),KIT,KRAS,NRAS,andTSC2(2of121each,1.7%)
(Figure 2B and eTable 7 in Supplement 2). Only 4 (11%) of these
37 mutations were previously detected by routine clinical mo-
lecular testing: an ALK hotspot mutation in a neuroblastoma
and BRAF V600E mutations in 3 gliomas. An equal number
were identified in genes that are now becoming routinely
tested in the patient’
s tumor type (CTNNB1 in 3 medulloblas-
tomas and H3F3A in a glioblastoma) although not at the time
ofdiagnosis.19Atotalof25of37categoryIorIImutations(68%)
were either oncogene alterations previously reported in the
COSMIC database or inactivating mutations in tumor suppres-
sor genes (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).15
The tumor reports of an additional 24 of 121 patients (20%)
includedatleast1somaticmutationinaconsensuscancergene
(category III), most frequently TP53 (7 of 121, 6%), BCOR,
DDX3X, and MED12 (3 of 121 each, 2.5%), while 64 (53%) of 121
patients had no category I to III mutations reported (Figure 2;
eTables 7 and 8 in Supplement 2). Only 22 (59%) of 37 cat-
egory I and II mutations and 18 (33%) of 54 (33%) category III
mutations were in genes known to be mutated at greater than
2% frequency in the tumor type tested; for example, BRAF,
JAK3, KRAS, MET, and TSC2 mutations are all rare events in
neuroblastoma.15,20,21 A total of 1111 mutations in category IV
genes were also identified by WES, but not further validated,
in 112 (93%) of 121 patients.
Germline WES
Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations underlying the pa-
tient’
s phenotype were identified in 15 (10%) of 150 patients
(Table 2 and eTable 9 in Supplement 2). For 8 (62%) of 13 pa-
tientswithdominantcancersusceptibilitymutations,thegene
in which the mutation was reported was known to be associ-
ated with childhood cancer risk (VHL × 2, TP53 × 2, DICER1,
MSH2, WT1, and KRAS). However, in 3 of these 8 cases, the
clinical team caring for the child had not considered genetic
testing because (1) the positive family history suggestive of
Lynch syndrome was not elicited by the team caring for the
child with glioblastoma multiforme and MSH2 mutation;
(2) the clinical features had not previously resulted in a
Noonan syndrome diagnosis in the child with KRAS muta-
tion; and (3) 1 child with unilateral Wilms tumor and no con-
genital anomalies or developmental delay was mosaic for WT1
mutation. In addition, the remaining 5 patients with domi-
nant mutations had tumor diagnoses not previously associ-
atedwiththemutatedgene(BRCA1 × 2,BRCA2,SMARCA4,and
CHEK2). There was also a single autosomal recessive diagno-
sis (TJP2 deficiency) in a patient with severe liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This case (in addition to an-
other concurrent finding at another institution) was the first
report of an association of TJP2 deficiency and HCC.22 Fi-
nally, 1 patient with previously unexplained proteinuria was
found to carry an X-linked CLCN5 mutation. Parental samples
were available for testing in 13 of these 15 diagnostic cases.
Sanger validation revealed the diagnostic mutation to be in-
herited from a parent in 11 (85%); the only exceptions were the
mosaic WT1 mutation and de novo KRAS mutation.
An additional 10 participants (6%) were found to have a
single pathogenic mutation in a gene associated with an au-
tosomal recessive cancer syndrome (eTable 10 in Supplement
2),includingseveralgenesintheFanconianemiapathway,with
no further evidence of the disorder noted by the oncologist or
found in the medical record. Of this group, only 1 participant,
with Wilms tumor and a single DIS3L2 mutation, had the tu-
mor type most commonly associated with the recessive
condition, Perlman syndrome.23

Finally, we performed comparisons of some of the
recurring mutations found in the BASIC3 cohort with 2000
clinical exomes reported3 by our same testing laboratory in
a primarily pediatric noncancer clinical population. There
was only a modest increased rate of BRCA1/2 mutations in
the BASIC3 cohort (3 of 150, 2% vs 14 of 2000, 0.7%;
P = .10). Summing across all the 14 Fanconi genes, we found
no evidence that putative loss-of-function mutations were
enriched in the BASIC3 cohort (P > .99). However, 1 recur-
rent FANCL frameshift mutation was found in 0.5% of the
2000 exome data set vs 3 of 150 among the BASIC3 partici-
pants (P = .19); thus, evaluation of the significance of this
finding requires a larger data set.
Twelve patients had clinical germline gene testing out-
side of WES (the majority being TP53 comprehensive analy-
sis)withnoadditionalsequence-basedmutationsreported.The
WES report does not include deletions, and a large deletion of
the SMARCB1 gene was reported in a single patient with an
atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the CNS. In addition, WES
revealed the germline nature of a TP53 mutation previously
reported from a tumor mutation panel.
Medically actionable incidental findings reported in-
cluded those genes recommended by the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)24 and additional find-
ings (including mitochondrial DNA), as recently described.2,3
Eight (5%) of 150 patients had incidental findings, including 5
ingenesontheACMGlist(eTable11inSupplement2).Twofind-
ings were specifically reported as being actionable for an on-
cology patient: an immunodeficiency allele and a mitochon-
drial DNA allele associated with aminoglycoside toxic effects.
The remaining patient was diagnosed incidentally with the
MELAS mitochondrial disorder (mitochondrial encephalomy-
opathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes).
The germline exome report includes 3 additional catego-
ries. The laboratory reports VUS in genes related to the pa-
tient’
s phenotype, which included the cancer susceptibility
genes listed in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. One hundred forty-
four (96%) of 150 patients had at least 1 (median of 3) VUS on
their report, which is consistent with previous reports of 2 VUS
per study participants using a much smaller gene panel.25 In
addition, the WES reports include the common variants rec-
ommended by the US Food and Drug Administration for dos-
ing in VKORC1/ CYP2C9 (altered warfarin metabolism) and
CYP2C19 (altered Plavix metabolism), with 133 (89%) of 150 pa-
tients having at least 1 pharmacogenetic variant reported (me-
dian of 1). Finally, parents are provided the option of report-
ing of carrier status (pathogenic mutations only) for the very
large number of autosomal recessive disorders currently avail-
able for single gene testing. Of the 137 probands whose par-
ents requested reporting (91%), 115 (84%) had at least 1 reces-
sive carrier finding (median of 2).

Discussion
Here we report that clinical tumor WES in children with
newly diagnosed solid tumors revealed somatic mutations
of established or potential clinical utility (category I and II)
in approximately one-quarter of patients and mutations in
cancer genes not classified as targetable (category III) in a
similar number (Figure 2A and eTable 8 in Supplement 2).
The vast majority of these mutations had not been detected
by targeted molecular testing as part of routine clinical care.
Consistent with this current practice, tumor WES revealed
somatic mutations of established clinical utility (category I)
in only a small minority of patients, with far more tumors
harboring mutations of potential clinical utility (category II).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the
diagnostic yield of WES in the wide spectrum of childhood
solid tumors routinely seen in a large children’
s hospital.
Further studies in larger cohorts of patients will be required
to evaluate the yield of such testing for specific tumor
types.
Our tumor WES data highlight several points regarding
the use of genomic tests for children with solid tumors.
First, despite being less frequently mutated than most adult
cancers, pediatric solid tumors harbor potentially attractive
targets for therapy, prominently including mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and MTOR/PI3K
pathway mutations (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). As
expected, given that children with cancer are typically ini-
tially treated on clinical trials or following established treat-
ment regimens, the mutations detected did not alter the
management of the newly diagnosed cancer in this cohort.
Further studies will be required to assess their potential
relevance in the context of refractory and relapsed
cancers.
Second, although pediatric solid tumors share
common genetic alterations with adult epithelial cancers,
mutations in developmental pathways such as Wnt/
Wingless signaling (eg, CTNNB1, the most frequently
mutated gene in this unselected cohort) are particularly
prominent in pediatric solid tumors. Accordingly, both pedi-
atric cancer-specific mutation panels and novel therapeutic
strategies for targeting these key pediatric cancer pathways
are needed.
Third, 56% (51/91) of mutations were found in genes not
known to be recurrently mutated in that specific tumor type,

demonstratingthepotentialvalueoftestingstrategiesandclini-
cal trials based on molecular alterations rather than tumor
histology.26
Fourth, to maximize the yield of such strategies, ge-
nomic testing to detect alterations outside of known hot-
spots is necessary, such as the inactivating TSC2 mutations ob-
served in this cohort. The clinical relevance of noncanonical
mutations in oncogenes, such as the detected missense ki-
nase domain mutations in JAK2 and FGFR1, is currently un-
clear and will require further study.
Fifth, many potentially actionable mutations were found
in a small fraction of patients (eg, mutation of FGFR1 in <1%),
indicating that effective pediatric precision oncology ap-
proaches will require access to a large number of targeted
agents.
The clinical categorization of mutations in tumor WES
reports was based on expert opinion, using knowledge of
mutations, genes, and availability of molecularly targeted
agents. For example, the reported category III mutations
include variants with diagnostic or prognostic utility (eg,
DDX3X mutations in Wnt subtype medulloblastoma)27,28
and others that may be predictive of drug response, such as
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and poly-ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.29 The development of stan-
dardized definitions for clinical categorization of somatic
mutations will be critical to allow comparative analyses
between different genomic testing platforms and patient
populations.
We determined the yield of germline WES and whether
those findings would have been revealed by a genetic evalu-
ation. The gene most frequently considered for testing by
the BASIC3 genetics study team was TP53 (n = 23), although
only 2 TP53 germline mutations were identified in this
cohort. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in the dis-
tribution of cancer susceptibility mutations, with most
genes mutated only in a single case. Overall, 5 of the 15
genetic diagnoses in this cohort had specifically been con-
sidered for testing by the teams caring for the patient. For
many of the remaining diagnoses, the mutations occurred
in genes not previously associated with the child’
s cancer
diagnosis. This may partially relate to recently described
disease genes with limited data, eg SMARCA4, which was
first described in 2010 in rhabdoid tumors30 and identified
in a child with neuroblastoma in this study. Consistent with
the somatic mutation analysis, our data suggest that a pedi-
atric hereditary cancer gene panel would also need to be
broadly constituted to be an effective test platform. In addi-
tion, cancer risk may be influenced by gene-by-gene interac-
tions, as may be the case for the Wilms tumor found in the
patient with heterozygous CHEK2, FANCC, and DIS3L2
mutations. In addition, the transmission of cancer suscepti-
bility mutations in these families suggests that the popula-
tion genetics of childhood cancer susceptibility may be dis-
tinct from that of other disease populations; for example,
85% of patients in our study inherited the cancer suscepti-
bility mutation from a parent, with only 1 de novo and 1
mosaic mutation detected in contrast to a 70% de novo rate
observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.3
This high rate of inheritance has also resulted in rapid tar-
geted testing of at-risk siblings, with cancer screening
initiated for those found to carry the identified disease
mutation.
A number of children carried pathogenic mutations in
adult-onset cancer genes, in particular 3 (2%) of 150 partici-
pants with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Polymorphisms in
BARD1, which encodes a BRCA1-interacting protein, have
been associated with neuroblastoma risk,31 but 1 study
reported no increase in childhood cancer diagnosis in breast

cancer kindreds with BRCA1/2 mutations.32 The 3 different
tumor types, the absence of LOH, and no statistically signifi-
cant increase in BRCA1/2 mutations compared with a nonpe-
diatric cancer cohort would suggest that this may be an inci-
dental finding. The discovery here of both germline (n = 3)
and somatic (n = 2) BRCA1/2 mutations by WES, as well as the
clarification that a TP53 mutation initially identified on a
tumor mutation panel was germline, demonstrates the value
of sequencing matched normal samples as part of tumor
genomic testing.33 The integration of paired tumor and nor-
mal sequencing analyses can also be useful for interpretation
of germline data, including evaluation of tumor LOH in cases
with germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, such
as our patient with a likely pathogenic TP53 mutation.
Conclusions
Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES results in an
unselected cohort of 150 children with newly diagnosed solid
tumors revealed potentially actionable findings in nearly 40%
of patients across a spectrum of genes previously implicated
in both pediatric and adult cancers. The further integration of
methodstodetectcopynumberabnormalitiesandfusiongenes
will increase the diagnostic yield of these tests, particularly for
tumor types that are known to harbor few mutations detect-
ablebyWES.Strategiestoeffectivelyandresponsiblyusethese
diverse results are required to incorporate WES and other ge-
nomic tests into childhood cancer care and clinical trials.
