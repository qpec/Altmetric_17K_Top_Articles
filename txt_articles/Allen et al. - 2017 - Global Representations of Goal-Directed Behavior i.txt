SUMMARY
The successful planning and execution of adaptive
behaviors in mammals may require long-range coor-
dination of neural networks throughout cerebral
cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that
could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains un-
clear. Here, we develop and apply methods for
cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing deci-
sion-making behavior and identify a global cortical
representation of task engagement encoded in the
activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial
neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cor-
tex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell
types was found to reflect this representation with
type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition
tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal
cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon;
local inhibition of this region blocked both the cor-
tex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the
voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-
specific processes in cortex for globally representing
goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical
node that gates the global broadcast of task-related
information.
INTRODUCTION
Adaptive, goal-directed behaviors are crucial for animals to sur-
vive in changing environments. These behaviors require animals
to integrate immediate stimuli, internal state, and past experi-
ence in order to rapidly and flexibly select specific actions to-
ward a particular goal. It is thought that the production of such
coordinated behaviors may require the organization of neuronal
activity within disparate sensory, motor, and state-regulation
systems in the brain, implemented in distinct interconnected
neural circuits (Swanson, 2000). In mammals, the neocortex is
commonly associated with the production of learned, adaptive
forms of goal-directed behaviors, and its evolutionary expansion
correlates with, and appears to underlie, some of the advanced
cognitive abilities of human beings and other primates (Harris
and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013; Huang and Zeng, 2013). However, the
extent to which, and mechanisms by which, neural activity is co-
ordinated across cortex to produce a single unified behavioral
output remain incompletely understood.
Recent experimental data and theories suggest an important
role for dynamic, reciprocal interactions in coordinating activity
across different cortical areas to produce voluntary behavior
and cognition (Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Engel et al., 2001;
Gilbert and Li, 2013; Miller and Cohen, 2001). Extensive theoret-
ical and experimental analysis has described how these recur-
rent interactions may produce complex spatial and temporal
patterns of activity, both spontaneously and in response to spe-
cific inputs (Douglas and Martin, 2007; Yuste, 2015). Simple
sensorimotor tasks can involve extensive cortical activation
and changes in spike synchrony and coherence (Engel et al.,
2001; Roelfsema et al., 1997). During goal-directed behavior, in-
teractions between different cortical areas are thought, in part, to
allow ‘‘top-down,’’ task-related information—such as expecta-
tions, decisions, rules, goals, or outcomes that derive from expe-
rience—to play a role in modulating local computations to guide
behavior. In particular, feedback projections from multimodal
association areas carrying this information have been proposed
to actively control the flow of information in cortex in a flexible
manner (Buschman and Miller, 2007; Miller and Cohen, 2001).
Although indirect evidence from both rodents and nonhuman
primates hints at the existence of widespread task-related sig-
nals, the majority of studies surveying different cortical regions
during goal-directed behavior have focused primarily on identi-
fying region-specific patterns of activity that could explain local
computations (Goard et al., 2016; Herna
´ ndez et al., 2010; Led-
berg et al., 2007; Poort et al., 2015; Siegel et al., 2015). These
pioneering studies typically investigated areas believed a priori

 to be involved in a behavior, leaving unresolved the question
of whether activity is coordinated throughout the whole cortex
or just in specific pathways. Furthermore, these important
studies are primarily correlative, leaving it unclear which parts
of the cortex, if any, are responsible for orchestrating cortical
activity. Finally, these studies necessarily left unaddressed
distinctions between cell types, although recent studies re-
porting task-related activity in inhibitory interneurons in single
cortical areas have suggested distinct roles for different types
of interneurons in representing behavioral state information
(Peron et al., 2015; Pinto and Dan, 2015). Thus, despite its po-
tential importance for the performance of goal-directed
behavior, the cellular and circuit implementation of global
task-related signals, as well as the role of individual cortical
regions in gating this widespread activity, remain largely
unexplored.
To explore biological mechanisms underlying the coordination
of cortical activity during behavior, we set up an experimental
paradigm designed to address several key questions: (1) Does
goal-directed behavior produce a globally distributed cortical
state representing task information such as decisions or expec-
tations, or is this representation restricted to specific regions of
cortex necessary for a behavior? (2) Is this state similarly repre-
sented in different cell types, or do some cell types favor local
computations while others represent the behavioral state? (3)
Can single cortical regions act as hubs that are necessary for
the generation of this state?
To answer these questions, we sought to bridge the gap
between single-cell coding and global brain dynamics by
broadly surveying neocortical activity during behavior. In awake,
behaving mice performing an olfactory go/no-go decision-mak-
ing task, we used tiled two-photon imaging to investigate local
single-cell coding across the cortex and developed a technique
for whole-cortex wide-field Ca2+ imaging to comprehensively
and synchronously record network-scale activity with cell-type
specificity. We further combined wide-field imaging with phar-
macological and optogenetic manipulations of behavior to
examine the role of single cortical regions in the production of
widespread task-related activity. Our findings reveal that appar-
ently local patterns of activity in cortex are in fact globally coor-
dinated; that this representation is shared across many areas,
but with distinct patterns in specific cell types; and that a single
cortical region is necessary both for the behavior and for these
globally coordinated dynamics.
RESULTS
Distributed Cellular Representation of Goal-Directed
Task Engagement
In order to broadly survey cortical activity during a simple goal-
directed behavior, we performed tiled two-photon Ca2+ imaging
of mice performing an olfactory go/no-go decision-making task
(Komiyama et al., 2010) (Figure 1A). Performance of this task is
known to depend upon both motor and premotor regions that
individually exhibit complex activity patterns during behavior
but is not thought to rely upon any sensory cortical areas in
dorsal cortex. Water-restricted mice were trained to make a
behavioral decision discriminating between two odors: to lick
in response to one odor (ethyl acetate) for a water reward
(hit) and withhold licking to another other odor (2-pentanone)
(correct reject [CR]) to avoid an aversive air puff to the rostrum
(Figures 1B and 1C). Mice were imaged after reaching criterion
performance of >70% correct (92% ± 9% correct trials per ses-
sion with 86% ± 2% correct rejections across 79 sessions,
mean ± SEM).
We combined a large chronic craniotomy with transgenic Ca2+
sensor expression to survey activity in different parts of cortex
during behavior. We expressed GCaMP6f, a fast and sensitive
fluorescent Ca2+ sensor (Chen et al., 2013b), in VGluT1+ excit-
atory neurons throughout neocortex using a triple-transgenic
strategy (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). We then exposed dorsal
neocortex, spanning motor, somatosensory, parietal, and visual
cortex through a 7 mm window for two-photon Ca2+ imaging
(Figures 1D–1D00). This preparation included access to both the
anatomically described somatomotor and medial sensory net-
works (Zingg et al., 2014). Neurons across cortex were imaged
over many behavioral sessions, and a wide-field calibration
image recorded each day was used to register the location of
each field of view within the same reference frame. Thus, over
multiple sessions, we could record thousands of superficial layer

 2/3 (L2/3) cortical neurons from a single animal across millime-
ters of cortex, with all recordings time-aligned relative to the
task (maximum projection from representative fields of view
shown in Figure 1D00; example individual cellular traces from
two fields of view shown in Figure S1A).
Surprisingly, individual L2/3 neurons in the majority of fields of
view across cortex (31% of total recorded neurons across 70 of
79 sessions, n = 4 mice) often exhibited activity on hit trials that
peaked, on average, during a specific point during the trial (Fig-
ure 1E; example data set of average trace for all task-responsive
cells from one mouse, in which color code indicates field-of-view
locations according to Figure 1D0). The average activity of cells
within every region spanned the duration of the task, but with
some neurons responding only during the cue and others only af-
ter the reward period (Figure 1E). Moreover, the activity of each
cell often qualitatively appeared reliable on average across mul-
tiple trials (Figure 1F; example trials for single cells from various
locations across the window specified by color code in Fig-
ure 1D00; further example traces on single go and no-go trials in
Figure S1B).
To characterize the heterogeneity in cellular response types,
we applied hierarchical clustering to each cell’s average activity
pattern. The cells separated into five groups, which accurately
represented our qualitatively observed distinctions in neural ac-
tivity (Figure 1G; STAR Methods); averaging the activity traces
from cells in each cluster revealed that the clusters collectively
tiled the duration of the task from odor cue until the end of the
trial (Figure 1H). Cells from four of five clusters were consistently
activated only on hit trials, whereas a few cells in the remaining
cluster (dark blue) were activated on both hit and CR trials (Fig-
ures 1G and 1H). These signals did not solely reflect the motor or
sensory aspects of the licking action itself, because the majority
of cells peaked in activity during the cue or reward periods (Fig-
ures 1G and 1H), despite the licking behavior peaking later and
continuing for several seconds afterward (Figure 1C). Mapping
the locations of cells assigned to each cluster across co-regis-
tered windows from each mouse revealed that cells from
these clusters were distributed throughout cortex without any
apparent spatial ordering (Figure 1I). This widespread distribu-
tion revealed that cells throughout cortex, including in primary
sensory cortices such as somatosensory cortex, were entrained
to all phases of a remarkably globally coordinated brain state
during goal-directed behavior.
Widespread Single-Trial Encoding of Behavioral Choice
throughout Neocortex
Although the mean activity across trials in Figure 1 is useful in
describing the patterns of activity throughout cortex, we sought
to examine how reliably single cells were activated during the
task by quantifying how each cell encoded behavioral choice
on a single-trial basis. We therefore analyzed the ability of single
neurons to discriminate trial types (hit versus CR) on a trial-by-
trial basis using ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis.
We found that an ideal observer could discriminate between trial
types significantly above chance levels in roughly half (n = 399)
of task-modulated neurons, again surprisingly distributed fully
throughout the observable cortex with no apparent pattern
(p < 0.05, permutation test) (Figure 2A). Neurons that could accu-
rately discriminate trial types above chance level performed well,
with more than half getting >85% of individual trials correct (Fig-
ure 2B). Thus, individual neurons throughout cortex exhibit
reliable activity that can accurately signal task engagement
following odor discrimination on single trials.
In order to identify signals reflecting internal states, we next
sought to further discriminate between activity related to senso-
rimotor feedback from the licking behavior and activity related to
the animal’s engagement in the task, which could indicate inter-
nal signals such as the decision to lick and expectation of
reward. Because well-trained animals tend to lick immediately
upon olfactory detection of the go cue, it was not possible to
discriminate specific task epochs with licking-induced versus
internal state-induced neuronal activity. Rather, in order to
distinguish between task-responsive versus licking-responsive
neurons, we determined how well neural activity could be pre-
dicted by task events versus directly measured licking behavior.
Specifically, we built a generalized linear model (GLM) that
sought to predict neural activity from parameters separately rep-
resenting each 100 ms time window in the task from cue onward
(fixed across trials) versus the onset, offset, and duration of indi-
vidual lick bouts (variable across trials) (Pinto and Dan, 2015). To
fit the model, a per-trial parameter matrix was constructed that
had consistent indicator variables for task time points and indi-
cator variables that represented trial-by-trial variation in the
licking behavior (Figure 2C). Correlation between observed and
predicted time series on held-out data was used to evaluate
model fit (Figure 2D).
We then predicted each cell’s activity using the full model, or
using either the task or licking parameters individually, to deter-
mine if that neuron’s activity was more related to the voluntary
licking behavior (‘‘licking correlated’’) or to the task events
(‘‘task correlated’’) (Figure 2E). Although the task and licking
parameter sets differed in number, potential issues due to over-
fitting of a larger number of parameters were addressed by first
fitting on training data and then predicting activity on a separate
test data set. We found that more cells were significantly more
predictive using the full set of parameters than using either just
the lick or task parameters (407 cells using full parameters, 154
using lick parameters, 280 using task parameters), indicating
that many neurons jointly encoded task- and licking-related infor-
mation. Both licking- and task-correlated neurons were distrib-
uted throughout cortex without apparent spatial clustering (Fig-
ure 2E). However, among those neurons that were significantly
predictive for each parameter set, the average model perfor-
mance was comparable between predictions using the full pa-
rameters versus just task parameters (R = 0.48 versus R = 0.50,
p > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), whereas licking was signifi-
cantly less predictive than either (R = 0.43, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test) (Figure 2F). Under the assumptions of the GLM,
cortical neurons therefore encode less information regarding
the action itself, in terms of both predictive accuracy per cell
and total number of active cells, than regarding task events.
Fewer than half (68 of 154) of the licking-correlated cells were
licking specific, whereas the majority (194 of 280) of task-corre-
lated cells were task specific, as defined by cells that were signif-
icantly predictive using only one parameter set but not the other;
86 neurons were significant with both parameters (Figure 2G).

 Licking-specific, task-specific, or mixed-selectivity neurons
were intermingled throughout cortex (Figure 2H). Thus, accord-
ing to the GLM, activity of single cells is typically more related
to general task engagement state than to the specific timing of
behavioral output and associated sensorimotor feedback.
This finding does not exclude the possibility that denser sam-
pling of neural activity could reveal finer grained differences in

the fraction of cells encoding different
parts of the task (Goard et al., 2016)
but does show that cells throughout cor-
tex similarly encode task engagement
following behavioral choice and that this
encoding is not primarily a product of
sensorimotor feedback. Many cells are
reliably active at specific times during
the task, particularly between the cue
and reward period, and are not specif-
ically
correlated
with
the
behavioral
output. This distributed activity is consistent with a model in
which cellular activity patterns in cortex reflect dynamic, global
brain states produced during goal-directed behavior. However,
these observations were pieced together from many local obser-
vations sampling relatively small numbers of single cells asyn-
chronously in different fields of view, only from the area acces-
sible under a 7 mm window, and only from excitatory neurons.

 Cell-Type-Specific Cortex-wide Imaging of Neural
Activity
In order to more comprehensively and synchronously survey
cortical activity in different cell types, we developed a tech-
nique for truly synchronous wide-field activity recording from
genetically specified neurons across the entire intact cortex of
behaving animals. This approach used the combination of optics
sensitive enough to record faint fluorescence signals at high
speed while spanning large areas, a surgical preparation
enabling chronic wide-field transcranial imaging, and genetic
tools for expressing Ca2+ indicators in specific subsets of neu-
rons throughout the cortex.
We began by constructing a wide-field fluorescence macro-
scope with highly efficient light collection and an exceptionally
large 12 mm diameter field of view (Ratzlaff and Grinvald,
1991) (Figure 3A), as with concurrent approaches using wide-
field imaging to examine spontaneous and sensory-evoked
pan-cortical activity (Ma et al., 2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016;
Xiao et al., 2017). Distinct from these previous studies, we
achieved cell-type specificity by combining Gad2-Cre and
VGluT1-Cre transgenic mouse lines that express Cre recombi-
nase in the vast majority of inhibitory GABAergic or excitatory
glutamatergic (respectively) cortical neurons with high-express-
ing transgenic GCaMP6f Cre-reporter mice (Madisen et al.,
2015) (Figures 3B and 3C). We next exposed and made trans-
parent the intact, un-thinned skull by treatment with a clear
acrylic cap, and focused the macroscope below superficial
blood vessels (Guo et al., 2014) (Figure 3D). Because the macro-
scope does not perform optical sectioning, the transcranial fluo-
rescence signal reflects fluorescence integrated vertically over
the cortical volume, allowing collection of signals from across
the cortex despite its curvature. To assign spatial localization
of neural signals and register activity across different mice, we
aligned each activity time series to a common reference derived
from the Allen Brain Atlas (Oh et al., 2014) (Figure 3E).
We encountered a major challenge, in that even control Thy1-
GFP mice (with fluorescence not expected to be responsive to
neuronal Ca2+ levels) exhibited time-varying fluorescence sig-
nals, likely because of intrinsic autofluorescence, blood flow,
and changes in blood oxygenation levels (Pisauro et al., 2013).
We therefore developed a fluorescence normalization scheme
on the basis of wavelength multiplexing to mitigate the influence
of this artifactual signal, taking advantage of the fact that GCaMP
fluorescence is effectively Ca2+ independent at 410 nm but Ca2+
dependent at 488 nm (Lerner et al., 2015) (Figures 3F and S2A).
This approach allowed us to nearly simultaneously record one
fluorescence video representing the neural activity plus artifacts
and one video representing just the artifacts. The purely Ca2+-in-
dependent signal could be subtracted from the combined signal
to yield just Ca2+-dependent changes in fluorescence. Control
experiments in Thy1-GFP mice revealed a noise floor of <1%
DF/F after normalization (Figure S2E; for further methodological
detail, see Figures S2A–S2G).
To validate that wide-field imaging could reproduce expected
cortical activity patterns, we tested auditory stimuli (15 kHz tone,
0.5 s), visual stimuli (flashing green light-emitting diode [LED],
0.5 s, to right eye), or touch stimuli (10 Hz vibrating piezoelectric
actuator applied to left whiskers), to elicit responses in the
respective sensory cortices. All three modalities produced activ-
ity primarily in the expected sensory cortical areas, comparably
in both Gad2+ and VGluT1+, but not in GFP control mice, and
specifically in the contralateral cortex for visual and touch stimuli
(red arrowheads in Figures 3G–3I; quantification in Figure 3J).
Activity was also observed to a lesser extent in regions that
receive projections from primary sensory areas, in line with pre-
vious observations using voltage-sensitive dyes (Ferezou et al.,
2007; Mohajerani et al., 2013). Furthermore, and also as ex-
pected, signals from excitatory and inhibitory neurons tracked
each other during these passive responses to sensory stimuli
(Figures 3G–3J).
Because wide-field microscopy cannot isolate signals from
single cells, we next used two-photon microscopy to investigate
the likely source of the wide-field whole-cortex activity dy-
namics. Using mice performing the olfactory go/no-go task, we
registered videos recorded with the wide-field macroscope
through a 7 mm cranial window with the calibration image
used for registering fields of view acquired through two-photon
imaging. By extracting the wide-field signal corresponding to
each field of view acquired through two-photon imaging, we
could directly compare the local fluorescence traces from each
region recorded by the two imaging modalities (Figures 3K and
3L). In addition to the L2/3 data sets described in Figure 1, we re-
corded from layer 1 (L1) neuropil in several locations across the
cortex (for n = 3 VGluT1+ mice, n = 21 L1 regions, n = 62 L2/3)
(Figures 3K and 3L). We found that the summed full-frame L1
fluorescence was significantly more correlated with the corre-
sponding wide-field signal than was full-frame L2/3 fluorescence
(Figure 3M; average R = 0.45 versus R = 0.12, p < 0.01, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test).
These data suggest that the widespread signals observed
through wide-field imaging in excitatory neurons reflect primarily
superficial neuropil activity, comprising axonal inputs and local
dendritic dynamics. This L1 contribution to the wide-field signal
is expected given that both blue excitation and green emission
light will attenuate rapidly by scattering in mature brain tissue
(Aravanis et al., 2007), and because the whole-cortex expression
approach labels axons and dendrites in addition to somata. In
VGluT1+ L1 excitatory neuropil, the bulk Ca2+ signal likely repre-
sents both axonal and dendritic fluorescence. The axonal contri-
bution to this signal includes recurrent cortico-cortical feedback
connections that have been proposed to modulate activity in
other cortical regions during goal-directed behavior (Cauller,
1995; Miller and Cohen, 2001) and that have previously been
shown to encode different forms of task-related information dur-
ing multiple behaviors (Makino and Komiyama, 2015; Petreanu
et al., 2012). In addition, this signal likely includes a large contri-
bution from local L5 pyramidal cell dendrites, which can exhibit
Ca2+ transients in response to synaptic input, back-propagating
action potentials, or dendritic spiking (Stuart and Spruston,
2015). By contrast, inhibitory neurons in cortex are thought to
be primarily local interneurons, meaning that Gad2+ wide-field
signals most likely represent local activity (Kepecs and Fishell,
2014). Measuring both these signals in superficial neuropil
throughout cortex using wide-field microscopy is therefore
important to test theories of the widespread broadcast of task-
related information during goal-directed behavior.

 Inhibitory and Excitatory Neural Dynamics Reflect Task

Next, to identify the globally broadcast task-related signals
that could serve to coordinate cortical activity for a specific
behavioral goal, we examined the pan-cortical activity patterns
of inhibitory and excitatory neuropil using our transcranial
imaging approach in mice performing the olfactory go/no-go
task. Mice were imaged after passing a behavioral criterion
of >70% trials correct per session (87% ± 7% correct across
9 Gad2+ and 90% ± 9% correct across 12 VGluT1+, with
86% ± 1% and 87% ± 2% correct CR trials, respectively,

mean ± SEM). Because the mice ex-
hibited highly reliable behavior during
the task (Figure 1C), we first analyzed
the trial-averaged dynamics of activity
across cortex in Gad2+ and VGluT1+
mice.
Both Gad2+ and VGluT1+ mice exhibited widespread synchro-
nous cortical activation averaged across trials upon cue presen-
tation during the task (Figures 4A and 4B), though with intriguing
differences. In both cases, in hit trials, activity increased dramat-
ically on average upon cue presentation and corresponding
onset of anticipatory licking and stayed active until reward deliv-
ery, when the activity abruptly diminished despite the animal
continuing to lick for several seconds (Figures 4B and 4C). Inhib-
itory Gad2+ neuropil throughout neocortex was similarly active
in both trial types during the cue period, whereas excitatory
neuropil in the frontal motor and somatosensory cortex was
898
Neuron 94, 891–907, May 17, 2017
 preferentially activated compared with posterior visual and
retrosplenial cortex during the cue period (Figures 4B and 4C).
The olfactory bulb also demonstrated interesting dynamics (Fig-
ure S3F), although because of the many differences between
excitatory mitral/tufted cells and inhibitory granule cells of the
olfactory bulb, and excitatory principal cells and inhibitory inter-
neurons of the neocortex, a direct comparison with cortex is diffi-
cult. In all cortical areas and in both cell types, activity began to
increase during the cue phase.
Surprisingly, between the cue and reward periods in both trial
conditions, inhibitory neuropil continued to remain highly active,
whereas the excitatory (VGluT1+) activity robustly decreased af-
ter the cue period (compare magenta and green traces across
Figure 4B and summary statistics between the cue and reward
periods in Figures 4D and 4E). These widespread patterns of ac-
tivity were consistent across trials (example in Figures S3D and
3DE); ROC analysis showed that an ideal observer could distin-
guish between trial types (hit versus CR) >75% of the time on
average by examining the activity on single trials in the majority
of cortical regions, in both Gad2+ and VGluT1+ mice (Figure 4F).
Alignment to the onset of licking revealed that in both types of
mice, activity throughout cortex began ramping up several hun-
dred milliseconds before the first recorded lick (Figure 4G), while
control Thy1-GFP mice exhibited no mean activity changes
throughout cortex during this task or on single trials (trial-aver-
aged representative video in Figure S3A; single trials for repre-
sentative mouse in Figure S3B; average traces across n = 3
mice in Figure S3C).
We confirmed this surprising finding of separable excitatory-
and inhibitory-neuropil activity dynamics during behavior by us-
ing new methods for labeling both cell types within the very same
animal for a simultaneous two-color imaging approach (Figures
S5A–S5C). To increase the flexibility of wide-field imaging for
incorporating advances in activity sensors, and to remove the
need to breed additional triple-transgenic animals, we imple-
mented a viral technique for brain-wide expression of GCaMP
in specific cell types in adult animals. In Gad2-Cre mice, we
used intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.B, a capsid variant
engineered to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (Deverman
et al., 2016), to simultaneously express jRCaMP1b in primarily
excitatory cells under control of the CaMKIIa promoter, and
Cre-dependent GCaMP6f in inhibitory cells under control of
the ubiquitous EF1a promoter (Figures S4B–S4D).
The jRCaMP1b and GCaMP6f expressing cells were largely
non-overlapping, although a small amount of co-labeling was
observed (10% ± 1%, across n = 3 mice in three fields of view
per mouse, mean ± SEM), consistent with previous reports using
the CaMKIIa promoter in AAV9 (Cook-Snyder et al., 2015) (Fig-
ures S4D and S4E). Using a large cortical window to access
the cortex, we confirmed the earlier finding shown here, although
with lower signal-to-noise, particularly in the RCaMP signal. We
found that activity dynamics in the two cell types were instanta-
neously correlated throughout cortex but that in a number of re-
gions including visual, somatosensory, and posterior parietal,
but not motor cortex, inhibitory neural activity persisted longer
than excitatory activity in accordance with Figure 4 (Figures
S4F–S4H, orange arrows in Figure S4G and black arrows in
Figure S4H).
The abrupt shutoff of neuropil activity upon reward delivery
despite a continuation of the licking behavior corroborated the
earlier finding (see Figures 2E–2H) that these neural signals are
not merely a byproduct of sensorimotor feedback during licking
behavior. Nor are these signals simply a product of ongoing
motor output (Figures 4B–4D), of reward receipt itself (Figures
S5A, S5C, and S5D), or of unanticipated stimuli (Figures 3G–
3J). Instead, these signals appear to represent the behavioral
decision with anticipation of subsequent reward.
To further test that this widespread activation during hit trials
was the consequence of an internal state related to the rewarded
nature of the task, and not simply a consequence of the motor
output (licking), we imaged a subset of the cohort during a
different task, before training on the olfactory discrimination
task. Here, mice (n = 2 Gad2+, n = 3 VGluT1+) were presented
with a lick port, but no cues (olfactory, visual, or otherwise)
were presented to indicate when water would be dispensed.
Instead, mice could lick freely but were rewarded only within a
certain time window (leading to reward on about 50% of the
lick bouts). As seen in Figure 4H, mice licked at the same rate
on rewarded and non-rewarded bouts, but only the rewarded
case yielded full widespread neural activation, particularly in
inhibitory neuropil. (In contrast, only a small increase in activity
restricted to frontal cortex was attributable to reward delivery
itself; quantified during the go/no-go task in both inhibitory and
excitatory neurons; Figures S5A and S5C.) In particular, when
summing across all regions, just 38% of the VGluT1+ response
and 31% of the Gad2+ response could be explained by licking
alone in the absence of reward (where percentage response
is the ratio of the integral under the curve from time 0–0.3 s
in the absence of reward to the integral of the curve in the pres-
ence of reward). This difference revealed that the conjunction of
licking behavior in the setting of immediate or anticipated
reward, but not licking in itself, produced the observed globally
distributed neuropil activity dynamics.
Cell-Type-Specific Interneuron Activity Dynamics
Although this initial level of discrimination between excitatory
and inhibitory neuropil was informative, Gad2-expressing inter-
neurons can be subdivided further into even more specific,
molecularly defined classes that may play distinct roles in repre-
senting task-related information (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Pinto
and Dan, 2015). Therefore, we next characterized the responses
of two different interneuron populations during the same goal-
directed task: perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing
(PV+) and dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST+)
cell types, which respectively account for approximately 40%
and 30% of all GABAergic interneurons in neocortex (Rudy
et al., 2011). These two types of interneurons exhibit highly
distinct and specific patterns of morphology, connectivity, and
neuromodulator receptor expression and are thought to play
distinct roles in circuit function (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014).
We produced additional recombinant AAV using the blood-
brain barrier-crossing capsid variant AAV-PHP.B, carrying a
Cre-dependent GCaMP6f gene driven by the strong CAG pro-
moter to provide high enough expression for transcranial imag-
ing (Deverman et al., 2016) (Figure 5A). Intravenously injected
AAV-PHP.B into SST-Cre or PV-Cre mice produced expression

 of GCaMP in each cell type across the entire cortex (Figure 5B),
at a level sufficient for intact-skull wide-field imaging. Immuno-
staining for GFP and either parvalbumin or somatostatin re-
vealed high-efficiency labeling (83% ± 3.5% for PV and 76% ±
1.5% for SST) of the correct cell type, with little leak expression
(97% ± 2% for PV and 99% ± 1% for SST coexpress PV or SST
out of all GCaMP+, n = 3 fields of view per mouse across
n = 3 mice, mean ± SEM) (Figures 5C and 5D).
Mice (n = 6 PV+, n = 4 SST+) were imaged while performing the
olfactory go/no-go decision-making task. Mice of the two geno-
types exhibited the same average licking response to the odor
cue (Figure 5E). The spatial pattern of activation in both cell types
was qualitatively similar to that observed in Gad2+ mice (Fig-
ure 5F), with both types of cells exhibiting task-related activation
throughout dorsal cortex. However, we found that the PV+ and
SST+ interneurons displayed a striking temporal offset in their
activity dynamics (Figures 5F and 5G). Whereas the activity of
PV+ neuropil peaked during the cue period and then began to
decay (similar to the VGluT1+ neurons; Figures 5F and 5G),
SST+ neuropil activity peaked after a relative delay and then sus-
tained a plateau level of activity before decay. PV+ neuropil ex-
hibited widespread transient activity immediately following cue
onset on CR trials, whereas SST+ neuropil became active during
the cue several hundred milliseconds later (Figures 5F and 5G).
To quantify this difference in activity dynamics, we compared
the correlation of PV+ and SST+ traces to the VGluT1+ and
Gad2+ traces (Figure 5H). Using the Pearson linear correlation co-
efficient, the PV+ and SST+ average traces (across mice) were
positively correlated with each other across all brain regions, as
both types of neurons increase their activity in relation to the
cue (p < 5 3 10�5, two-tailed test from bootstrap confidence in-
terval; STAR Methods). Because of this shared correlation, we
used the linear partial correlation coefficient to then compare
PV+ with Gad2+ and VGluT1+, while taking into account and
controlling for the correlation shared with SST+ (and vice versa).
Whereas Gad2+ activity was positively correlated across all
regions with that of both PV+ and SST+ as expected, VGluT1+
was positively partially correlated with PV+ but negatively partially
correlated with SST+ (p < 5 3 10�5, two-tailed test from bootstrap
confidence interval). Transcranial wide-field imaging thus re-
vealed the surprising result that a single behaviorally induced
global brain state can involve separable global dynamics of
different molecularly defined cell types in the same cortical area.
Premotor Cortex Activity Is Necessary and Sufficient for
Widespread Cortical Activation
Because goal-directed licking during the go/no-go task corre-
lated with recruitment both of single cells throughout cortex
and of widespread activity in inhibitory and excitatory neuropil,
we next sought to test the causal relationship between the initi-
ation of licking behavior and globally coordinated cortical activ-
ity. Using VGAT-ChR2 transgenic mice, we first performed a
coarse survey to find cortical regions necessary for performance
of the go/no-go task (Goard et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2014). In well-
trained mice, we systematically bilaterally inhibited five different
cortical regions by optogenetically activating GABAergic inter-
neurons within an �2 mm diameter disk during the cue through
reward period of the task, on a randomly selected set of trials
within a session (Figures 6A and 6B). We found that among the
regions probed, only inhibiting the frontal cortical region pre-
vented licking for water on go trials (Figure 6C; p < 0.001, paired
t test, n = 5 mice, 100 total trials per region). On trials without illu-
mination, all mice performed normally, and the inhibition had no
effect on performance on no-go trials in any area tested.
The frontal region of inhibition contains the anterior-lateral pre-
motor cortex (ALM), which has been previously implicated in initi-
ating voluntary lick behavior: electrical stimulation of ALM pro-
duces lick motions, and inhibition of ALM with muscimol, an
agonist of GABAA receptors, or optogenetic activation of inhibi-
tory interneurons specifically inhibits voluntary licking without
affecting other behaviors (Guo et al., 2014; Komiyama et al.,
2010). ALM has been shown to exhibit more complex representa-
tions such as short-term memory during motor planning (Goard
et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015). Furthermore, in addition to its output
to tongue motor nuclei in the brainstem, ALM projects broadly to
other parts of the cortical somatomotor system (Zingg et al.,
2014), and is thus positioned as a potential hub for broadcasting
task-related information to other parts of cortex. Despite these
behavioral and anatomical results, the effects of ALM inhibition
on global cortical activity during behavior remain unknown.
Therefore, to test the relationship between goal-directed
behavior and brain-wide activity, we used ALM pharmacological
inhibition to specifically prevent the mouse from engaging in
voluntary licking while still being able to sense the stimulus and
otherwise behave normally. This experimental design (Figure 6A)
enabled comparison of whole-cortex activity during ALM inhibi-
tion with several control conditions. First, clear-skull prepared
mice (n = 5) were trained to a near perfect level of performance;
next, mice were imaged while performing the olfactory go/no-go
task on four consecutive days, after one of (1) no injection, (2)
bilateral injection of muscimol into ALM, (3) control bilateral
injection of saline into ALM, or (4) a control bilateral injection of
muscimol into barrel cortex. Because of the limited number of
VGluT1+ triple transgenic mice, we used Thy1-GCaMP6f mice,
which express GCaMP6f in a large subset of (primarily) excit-
atory cortical neurons (Dana et al., 2014).
In concordance with our optogenetic results, silencing ALM
with muscimol successfully inhibited voluntary licking; behavior
was otherwise normal, and mice recovered the ability to lick by
the subsequent day. In contrast, silencing barrel cortex with
muscimol had no impact on behavioral performance (Figure 6B).
In comparison with the baseline day (Figure 6C, top row),
injecting muscimol into ALM effectively blocked widespread
cortical activation in response to the cue (Figure 6C, second
row). The region corresponding to the injection site was
completely silent (yellow arrows) as expected, while the rest of

 the cortex exhibited significantly decreased activation (quanti-
fied in Figure 6D for motor, somatosensory, and parietal cortices;
p < 0.05 for somatosensory and parietal, p < 0.01 for motor, one-
sided paired t test with intact condition, Benjamini-Hochberg
correction). In contrast, after similar silencing of barrel cortex
(Figure 6D, fourth row, yellow arrows), other cortical regions
maintained
largely
indistinguishable
levels
of
activation.
Together these data supported the hypothesis that ALM-medi-
ated initiation of goal-directed licking behavior is necessary for
the elicitation of cortex-wide activity in superficial neuropil.
Although this silencing experiment revealed the necessity of
ALM for producing widespread task-related signals in cortex,
we sought to determine whether ALM activation alone in naive
mice was sufficient to produce this activity even in the absence
of a task. To this end, we simultaneously optogenetically acti-
vated excitatory neurons in ALM of naive mice while imaging
the rest of cortex (Figures S6A and S6B). We used a red-shifted
excitatory opsin (Klapoetke et al., 2014) driven by the CaMKIIa
promoter and carried by AAV injected bilaterally into ALM to acti-
vate excitatory neurons in clear-skull prepared Thy1-GCaMP6f
mice (Figures S6A and S6B). Bilateral optogenetic stimulation
using 594 nm illumination at 10 Hz reliably produced licking
behavior, whereas control mice injected with AAV containing
CaMKIIa::mCherry showed neither licking response nor cortical
activation upon stimulation (Figures S6C and S6D). Simulta-
neous wide-field recording showed that optogenetic stimulation
produced activity spanning the majority of cortex, with statisti-
cally significant activation in motor, somatosensory, and parietal
cortices (Figures S6E, S6F, and S6I). By contrast, CaMKIIa::
mCherry injected mice showed no consistent activation in any
area (Figures S6G, S6H, and S6J). Activity in ALM excitatory neu-
rons is therefore sufficient both to produce licking behavior and
cause widespread cortical activity.
DISCUSSION
Here we find that goal-directed behavior produces broadly
distributed task-related activity throughout the neocortex, re-
flected both in widespread single cell and in neuropil activity.
Different molecularly defined cell types contribute specific activ-
ity patterns to this global state. We further demonstrate that a
single premotor cortical region responsible for the production
of goal-directed licking behavior is necessary for these global
cortical dynamics in response to task cues. Together, these ob-
servations provide a new kind of experimental support for the
concept that widely broadcast task-related information could
serve to coordinate cortical activity for a single, unitary behav-
ioral goal.
A variety of previous indirect lines of evidence are consistent
with this concept of widespread representations of task informa-
tion. Human fMRI studies show that a distinct ‘‘task-positive’’
cortical network is active during a variety of cognitive tasks
(Fox et al., 2005), and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies
have revealed large-scale patterns of coherence during perfor-
mance of go/no-go tasks (Shibata et al., 1997). Different regions
of cortex, including prefrontal cortex and primary sensory areas,
exhibit dynamically modulated synchrony as a function of atten-
tion, anticipation, or expectation during behavior (Bressler et al.,
1993; Gilbert and Li, 2013; Ledberg et al., 2007; Miller and
Buschman, 2013). Many local neurophysiological studies during
behavior have revealed task-dependent patterns of neural activ-
ity in cortex that do not correlate with specific sensory or motor
variables but that seem to represent internal state variables such
as task engagement, attention, or expectations (Kobak et al.,
2016; Poort et al., 2015). Indeed, a few studies comparing the ac-
tivity of single cells or local field potentials in different cortical re-
gions in non-human primates and mice performing perceptual
decision-making tasks have shown that task-relevant variables,
including behavioral decisions, are encoded in more than one
location, albeit in cortical regions expected a priori to be involved
in the behavior (Goard et al., 2016; Herna
´ ndez et al., 2010; Led-
berg et al., 2007; Siegel et al., 2015). These results hint that
cortical activity could similarly reflect global task-related states
at the single-cell level. Yet little work prior to this study has sys-
tematically explored the neuronal or circuit basis of these sig-
nals, despite their potential importance in cortical function.
We discovered that activity throughout the cortex in single
cells, cell types, and superficial neuropil, signal distinct aspects
of task-related information. The activity in all cell types was tied
to task events and partially decoupled from the animal’s
behavior, suggesting that it represented task information rather
than simply sensorimotor feedback from ongoing behavior. Sin-
gle cells tended to encode task timing more reliably than trial-by-
trial variation in motor action (Figures 2E and 2F) and were pri-
marily active during the period from cue to reward (Figures 1G
and 1H). These cells were distributed in a salt-and-pepper
manner throughout the observable part of the cortex (Figures
1I, 2A, 2E, and 2H), distinct from highly specific regional coding
of sensory information (Ohki et al., 2005). Similarly, the wide-field
activity in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons was limited to
spanning the duration of the task from the cue to the reward,
despite the licking behavior continuing beyond the reward deliv-
ery for several seconds (Figures 4B and 4C), and unrewarded
spontaneous behavior did not produce equivalent widespread
activation (Figure 4H).
Resolving these wide-field signals by cell type revealed distin-
guishable underlying neural dynamical processes. The L1 signal
of VGluT1+ mice is composed of both axonal and dendritic
signals. For the axonal contribution, the transmission of ‘‘top-
down’’ internal state signals through long-range excitatory feed-
back axon projections would be ideally suited to globally coordi-
nate cortical activity to specific ends by biasing the inputs to
local neuronal populations (Cauller, 1995; Makino and Ko-
miyama, 2015; Petreanu et al., 2012). The dendritic component
of VGluT1+ neuropil signal likely reflects the integration of these
and other inputs in the dendrites of local L5 pyramidal neurons
(Stuart and Spruston, 2015). Further investigation of L5 somatic
activity will be required to determine whether and how these
widespread inputs are transformed into local spiking output of
L5 pyramidal neurons, in addition to the widespread somatic
activity we observed in L2/3 through two-photon Ca2+ imaging
(Figure 1). By contrast, because cortical GABAergic neurons
are primarily local interneurons (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014), the
widespread signals we observed from inhibitory Gad2+ neurons
(including PV+ and SST+) most likely reflect local interneuron
activity.

 To perform these measurements in these specific interneuron
cell types, we implemented a new viral-genetic approach for
expressing fluorescent Ca2+ sensors throughout the brain. This
approach revealed differences in the timing of activity between
PV+ and SST+ inhibitory interneurons, with perisomatic-targeting
PV+ neuron activity preceding dendrite-targeting SST+ activity.
These different types of interneurons have been described in
many recent studies as playing distinct roles in cortical compu-
tation (Kvitsiani et al., 2013). PV+ neurons are thought to receive
dense, nonspecific local input from nearby principal neurons
(Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013; Pfeffer et al., 2013), explaining
their tight correlation with the VGluT1+ activity (Figure 5G),
whereas SST+ neurons are known to locally inhibit PV+ neurons
in visual cortex (Pfeffer et al., 2013), exhibit specific forms of
experience-dependent
plasticity
(Makino
and
Komiyama,
2015), and have been shown to play a key role in integrating input
from L1 excitatory feedback projections in visual cortex (Zhang
et al., 2014). The offset between PV+ and SST+ neuron activity
may represent a form of temporal gating, where first local excit-
atory populations are recruited by long-range excitatory projec-
tions, causing a fast compensatory response in PV+ neurons
before slower SST+-neuron mediated dendritic inhibition blocks
further L1 inputs.
A variety of mechanisms—direct cortico-cortical connections,
indirect cortico-thalamic-cortical connections, or common in-
puts from neuromodulators or other broadly projecting sys-
tems—could contribute to the observed widespread correlated
activity between disparate regions of cortex. At the level of
spatial resolution of our optogenetic inhibition, frontal cortex,
including ALM, was the only area necessary for the performance
of the task (Figure 6) and was necessary on an individual trial-by-
trial basis. Our further result that pharmacological inhibition of
the same area was necessary for both the voluntary licking
behavior and cortex-wide neuropil response (Figure 6), however,
implicates ALM as a potential hub or source of such global coor-
dination. By contrast, although many other cortical regions also
exhibited task-related activity, optogenetic inhibition in those re-
gions had no effect on behavior. In particular, somatosensory
cortex exhibited high levels of task-related activity yet muscimol
inhibition in that region had no effect on behavior or on global
cortical activation. Task-related activity observed in a particular
region during behavior thus may represent broadly distributed
signals informing local populations about the overall behavioral
state in order to coordinate activity, beyond the more typical
interpretation of task-related activity representing specific local
roles of that region of the brain. Consistent with this concept, it
was recently shown in nonhuman primates that an extensively
studied cortical area carrying task-related signals during a
motion discrimination task may be actually unnecessary for
task performance (Katz et al., 2016).
These widespread coordinated patterns of activity in single
cells may be a general feature of nervous system function,
because comprehensive recording of activity from the majority
of neurons (in animals in which this is possible, such as larval
zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans) reveal global dynamical
patterns that appear to encode behavioral states (Ahrens et al.,
2013; Kato et al., 2015). New large field-of-view two-photon mi-
croscopes allow for single-cell measurements of activity within
multiple cortical regions simultaneously, but so far this approach
can only sample activity throughout the whole cortex at low
frame rates (�1 Hz) and non-synchronously (Sofroniew et al.,
2014; Stirman et al., 2016). Two-area correlations in cortex
have recently been reported using dual-area two-photon micro-
scopes during goal-directed behavior; for example, Chen et al.
(2016) reported that goal-directed behavior increased local
coordination of activity within somatosensory cortex (between
primary and secondary).
Future studies will also further advance our specific, mecha-
nistic understanding of the means by which the widespread
task-related information we observe can coordinate activity
throughout cortex. One approach may be to compare pan-
cortical activity across a variety of behaviors, involving different
sensory modalities, actions, and expectations, ideally within
the same animal, in order to determine how cortical activity is
flexibly remapped for different goals. Understanding these
mechanisms may be important clinically, as disrupted or
abnormal communication between cortical regions has been
widely proposed to play a crucial role in psychiatric disorders
such as schizophrenia (Spellman and Gordon, 2015). Iden-
tification of failures in cortical communication using the method-
ologies developed for this study during disease-related states
(Rajasethupathy et al., 2016) may in the long run point to future
minimally invasive interventions to treat these disorders in
human beings.

METHOD DETAILS
Animal behavior
A microcontroller-based real-time behavioral system (Bpod, built using an Arduino Due) was used to control delivery of stimuli, water
reward, and air puff punishment. Licks were detected with a custom lickometer built using a capacitive touch sensor (Sparkfun) and a
microcontroller (Arduino). For olfactory stimuli, an olfactometer was constructed using pure odorants (ethyl acetate and 2-penta-
none, Sigma) diluted to 4% v/v in paraffin oil (Sigma). After waiting at least a week after surgery, mice were water restricted to
1 mL/day while maintaining > 80% pre-deprivation weight. After several days of handling and habituation to head fixation, mice
were trained to lick for free reward (�2–3 ml). Once mice could reliably lick for water, they were started on a shaping protocol that
automatically provided water reward (2–3 ml) 500 ms after the offset of either odor (delivered for 1 s). Once mice began reliably licking
during the odor cue (1–2 days), they were imaged during training. During training, odors were delivered for 1 s, followed by 500 ms of
no stimulus, then a 1 s response window. Licking within the response window on GO trials was rewarded with a water droplet. Licking
during the No-Go trials was punished with an airpuff to the face. Airpuffs (100 ms, 10 psi) were delivered via a solenoid valve
(NResearch) attached to a P1000 pipette. Mice typically began withholding licks during No-Go trials within 80 trials.
Two-photon imaging
A 7 mm window (Menzel-Gl€
aser) was implanted over a craniotomy, compressing the brain lightly, and a custom headbar was affixed.
Mice were allowed to recover for at least 1 week before being water restricted and trained on the task. Mice stably performing the
olfactory discrimination task (> 70% trials/session correct) were imaged using a two-photon microscope (Bruker Ultima) with an
Olympus 25X/1.05NA objective. Clear ultrasound gel was used as an immersion medium (Aquasonic, Parker Laboratories). Before
each two-photon imaging session, an Olympus 2X/0.14NA objective and a pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS camera were used to capture an
epi-illuminated one-photon widefield calibration image of the entire window, with the translation stage holding the mouse centered at
its origin.
Widefield imaging
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, the scalp was removed, skull cleaned and dried, and custom head-plate was cemented to
contacts over the cerebellum and in front of the olfactory bulb. The skull was then covered in a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (Apollo
2000, Cyberbond), clear dental acrylic (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental), and clear nail polish (Electron Microscopy Services) (Guo et al.,
2014). Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously at end of surgery. Mice were given > = 1 wk recovery before exper-
iments. Imaging was performed on a custom-built fluorescence macroscope designed for high light collection efficiency and large
field of view. The macroscope consisted of back-to-back 50 mm f/1.2 camera lenses (Nikon), separated by a FF495-Di03-50.8-D
dichroic mirror (Semrock), mounted in a 60 mm cube (Thorlabs). An F-mounted ORCA Flash 4.0 (Hamamatsu) was used to record
images, with a FF01-520/35-50.8-D emission filter (Semrock). Alternating 410nm and 488nm illumination for non-calcium dependent
artifact removal was controlled using a microcontroller (Arduino) slaved to the frame output trigger of the camera.
Local inactivation experiments
For optogenetic inhibition experiments, VGAT-ChR2 mice were prepared using the same preparation as for widefield imaging, and
then trained on the olfactory Go/No-Go task until near perfect performance. The 473 nm laser illumination was controlled by a mi-
crocontroller (Arduino) and coupled into a fiber optic splitter. Continuous wave laser illumination was used, with 20 mW at output
of each fiber tip (Goard et al., 2016). Fibers were positioned over the brain using micromanipulator translation stages, with coordi-
nates calibrated to bregma for each mouse. For pharmacological inhibition experiments, 250 nL of 1 mg/ml muscimol hydrobromide
(Sigma) in saline was bilaterally injected into ALM (2.4 mm anterior, 2.0 mm lateral to bregma), or somatosensory cortex (–1 mm pos-
terior, 3.2 mm lateral to bregma) of well-trained Thy1-GCaMP6f mice. This injection volume and concentration of muscimol were cho-
sen based on previous studies inactivating small parts of cortex (Pinto and Dan, 2015). Following surgery, mice were allowed at least
an hour for recovery before imaging. The skull was covered with silicone elastomer between imaging sessions.
Widefield Imaging (detailed description)
Imaging was performed on a custom-built fluorescence macroscope designed for high light collection efficiency and large field of
view. Images were collected after focusing �500 um below the surface of the most dorsal point on the skull, in order to focus

 past surface blood vessels. The macroscope consisted of back-to-back 50 mm f/1.2 camera lenses (Nikon), separated by a FF495-
Di03-50.8-D dichroic mirror (Semrock), mounted in a 60 mm cube (Thorlabs). An F-mounted ORCA Flash 4.0 (Hamamatsu) was used
to record images, with FF01-520/35-50.8-D emission filter (Semrock). To increase sensitivity and decrease data quantity, pixels were
binned 4x4. Illumination light was provided by a pair of high power, temperature-stabilized 405 nm and 470 nm LEDs (Cairn
Research). The 405 nm and 470 nm LEDs were then filtered with a FB410-10 and FL488-3 filter respectively, and joined by a
DMLP425L longpass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs) and coupled into the 60 mm cube with a third 50 mm f/1.2 camera lens (Nikon). Parts
list and diagram available on request. For simultaneous RCaMP/GCaMP imaging, a Dual View Lambda (Photometrics) image splitter
containing a FF555-Di03-25x36 dichroic and FF01-520/15-25 (GCaMP) and FF02-617/73-25 (RCaMP) emission filters (Semrock)
was inserted immediately before the camera sensor. A FF410/504/582/669-Di01-50-D dichroic was used between the lenses
of the macroscope, and a 560 nm LED (Cairn Research), filtered by a FF01-560/14-25 (Semrock) was added into the existing illumi-
nation path using a FF520-Di02-50.8 longpass dichroic.
Stimulus Delivery
A microcontroller-based real time behavioral system (Bpod, built using an Arduino Due) was used to control stimulus delivery through
a DAQ card (National Instruments). For auditory stimuli, the NIDAQ output a 15 kHz sine wave analog signal to an electrostatic
speaker calibrated to output at 70 db (EC1, TDT). For visual stimuli, the Bpod output through an Arduino to flash a green LED
(TinkerKit, Arduino), which was shielded from the macroscope using black tape. For tactile stimuli, the NIDAQ output a 10 Hz
sine wave through a linear amplifier (EPA-008-1, Piezo Systems) to a 4-layer piezoelectric bending actuator (T434-A4-302, Piezo
Systems) which was placed against the mouse’s whiskers.
Widefield Image Registration
A 2D top-projection atlas was generated from the annotated Allen Brain Atlas volume, version CCFv2, in MATLAB (MathWorks).
Videos were registered to this atlas using an affine transformation computed from four control points that were selected manually:
the anterior tip of the olfactory bulb, the center of the suture at the base of retrosplenial cortex, and the left and right base of the
olfactory bulb. This registration process was verified to be accurate and reproducible based on the visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli
data that each aligned with the corresponding cortical region.
Olfactory Behavioral Setup
Licks were detected with a custom lickometer built using a capacitive touch sensor (Sparkfun) and a microcontroller (Arduino). The
input to the touch sensor was soldered to a lick port (Popper animal feeding needle). Water was delivered by a gravity-assisted sy-
ringe attached to the lickometer, and controlled by a quiet solenoid valve (Lee Valve). Pure odorants (ethyl acetate and 2-pentanone,
Sigma) were diluted to 4% v/v in paraffin oil (Sigma) and pressurized with air (1 L/min). Two 3-way valves (NResearch), with the nor-
mally open port connected to a blank vial and the normally closed port connected to an odor vial, controlled odor delivery. Odor de-
livery was controlled by actuating solenoid valves to switched airflow away from a blank valve and to the odor valve. Odors were
delivered through a Teflon tube placed �1 cm from the mouse’s nose. All valve openings were controlled with Bpod, which also re-
corded the time of licks, and synchronized odor timing with the camera.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Mice were euthanized with beuthanasia, then transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
(Electron Microscopy Sciences). After overnight fixation in 4% PFA, 100 um sagittal sections were cut on a vibratome (Leica). For
the immunostaining in Figure 3, sections were blocked for 2 hr in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) + 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS
(PBST), and then stained overnight at 4�C in 5% NDS + 0.3% PBST with a primary antibody, either parvalbumin (Abcam
ab11427, 1:1000) or somatostatin (Santa Cruz sc-7819, 1:500) and GFP (Aves GFP-1020, 1:1000). After three washes in 0.3%
PBST, sections were stained with secondary anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:500) and anti-chicken Alexa488 (1:500) antibodies (Jackson Immu-
noresearch) for at least 3 hr. After three more washes, the sections were then stained with 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for
15 min and mounted with Vectashield (Vectorlabs). Widefield images of sagittal sections were taken using the same custom macro-
scope used for in vivo imaging, and confocal images were taken on either a Leica TCS SP5 (Figure 1) or a Zeiss LSM 780 (Figure 3)
microscope.
AAV-PHP.B Production and Intravenous Administration
AAV-PHP.B was produced using PEI-mediated triple transfection of HEK293 cells, following the protocol described in Deverman
et al., 2016. After transfection, media containing virus was harvested once at 72 hr and once again at 120 hr, when the cells were
harvested as well. Cells were lysed using multiple freeze/thaw rounds, and free virus was precipitated from the media using PEG
then added to the cell lysate. Extra-viral DNA was digested using Salt Active Nuclease, and the virus was purified using an iodixanol
step gradient and concentrated. AAV was titerd using standard qPCR methods. 50–100 ml of virus (corresponding to 1E12 vg) was
injected retro-orbitally using a 0.5 mL insulin syringe, and at least four weeks were allowed for expression before imaging.

 Optogenetic Inactivation Experiments
VGAT-Chr2 mice were prepared using the same preparation as for widefield imaging, and then trained on the Olfactory Go/No-Go
task until near perfect performance (minimum 70% correct, although all mice ended up performing above 90%). Coupling a 473 nm
laser to a 2x2 fiber splitter (Thorlabs FCMH2-FCL), each output fiber was held with a fiber clamp (Thorlabs FCM), and positioned
independently using micromanipulator translation stages, with coordinates calibrated to bregma for each mouse. The laser was
controlled by a microcontroller (Arduino), stimulating during the cue through reward period of a random subset of trials as the
mice performed the task for 100 trials per inhibited region. Continuous laser illumination was used, with 20 mW at output of each fiber
tip. Data was acquired across multiple sessions across multiple days.
Muscimol Inactivation Experiments
Muscimol hydrobromide (Sigma) was dissolved in saline to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A small �500 um craniotomy was drilled over
ALM (2.4 mm anterior, 2.0 mm lateral to bregma, or somatosensory cortex (–1 mm posterior, 3.2 mm lateral to bregma) of trained
Thy1-GCaMP6f mice. 250 nL of muscimol or saline were injected using a pulled glass pipette backfilled with oil at a rate of
100 nl/min. The injected substance was allowed to diffuse for 2-3 min, and then the pipette was withdrawn. This injection volume
and concentration of muscimol were chosen based on previous studies inactivating small parts of cortex (Pinto and Dan, 2015).
Following surgery, mice were allowed at least an hour for recovery before imaging. The skull was covered with silicone elastomer
between imaging sessions.
Optogenetic Activation
We injected Thy1-GCaMP6f mice bilaterally with 400 nL of CaMKIIa::Chrimson-p2A-mCherry or CaMKIIa::mCherry packaged in
AAV8 (both �1E13 vg/ml, Stanford Gene Vector & Virus Core). Mice were simultaneously prepared with a headbar and clear skull
cap for imaging. After waiting one week for expression, in these naive untrained mice, we used our macroscope to image neural ac-
tivity while bilaterally stimulating ALM using a fiber-coupled 594 nm laser triggered by an Arduino, at 10 Hz with 10 ms pulses. Fibers
were positioned over ALM. Power at the tip of each fiber ranged between 2–7 mW depending on the level of viral expression and the
quality of the clear skull preparation, calibrated so as to achieve a licking response. Tongue movements were recorded using a mono-
chrome Manta G-032 B camera (Allied Vision Tech). At least 10 stimulation trials were recorded for each mouse, each 4 s in duration,
and separated by a variable intertrial interval of at least 10 s. Timing of stimulation, Manta recording, and macroscope recording were
synchronized using a DAQ card (National Instruments).
Two-photon Imaging
An approximately seven millimeter craniotomy was made centered on the midline of the mouse’s skull, stretching from �4 mm ante-
rior to bregma to just anterior to the lambda suture. The brain was rinsed with sterile saline to removed blood, and a 7 mm window
(Menzel-Gl€
aser) was implanted over the craniotomy, compressing the brain lightly. The interface between the skull and window was
filled with VetBond (3M), and then the window was sealed in place with a layer of Metabond (Parkell). Mice were allowed to recover for
at least 1 week before being water restricted and trained on the task. Mice stably performing the olfactory discrimination task (> 70%
trials/session correct) were imaged using a two-photon microscope (Bruker Ultima) with an Olympus 25X/1.05NA objective. Clear
ultrasound gel was used as an immersion medium (Aquasonic, Parker Laboratories). Before each two-photon imaging session,
an Olympus 2X/0.14NA objective and a pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS camera were used to capture an epi-illuminated one-photon widefield
calibration image of the entire window, with the translation stage holding the mouse centered at its origin. For each behavioral trial,
at least 180 single-plane images (256 3 256 pixels) were acquired at 30 Hz, synchronized at the start of each trial using a TTL
output from the Bpod behavior controller, while frame acquisition times were recorded with Bpod. Each session consisted of at least
30 trials, with equal numbers of Go and No-Go trials.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis
The target number of subjects used in each subject was determined based on numbers in previous published studies. Mean ± s.e.m.
was used to report statistics. The statistical test used and the definition N for each analysis is listed in the Results text and figure
legends; non-parametric tests were used wherever appropriate. Significance was defined as a = 0.05. Multiple comparisons were
corrected for by Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg correction. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample size,
or to randomize. Animals were excluded prior to the collection of experimental data based on surgery quality. Statistical tests
were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks). Variances were checked for similarity between each group.
Widefield analysis
Analysis was performed using custom MATLAB (MathWorks) code. Videos were registered to a 2D top-projection atlas generated
from the annotated Allen Brain Atlas volume, version CCFv2, in MATLAB (MathWorks), using an affine transformation computed from
four manually selected control points. Each video was DF/F normalized, using the median for each pixel over the entire time series
as F. The 410 nm channel was then temporally smoothed using a moving average (width = 400 ms). The smoothed 410 nm DF/F
Neuron 94, 891–907.e1–e6, May 17, 2017
e4
 signal for each pixel was regressed onto the 488nm DF/F signal for the corresponding pixel, and the regression coefficients were
used to scale the 410 nm channel to the 488 nm channel. This scaled 410 nm DF/F signal was then subtracted from the 488 nm
DF/F signal to produce a normalized signal for each pixel. For quantification, activity traces were extracted from points centered
in six cortical regions (auditory, visual, somatosensory, parietal, motor, retrosplenial) on the left hemisphere of the brain.
Two-photon analysis
Two-photon tiff stacks were denoised using the PureDenoise ImageJ plug-in (global noise estimation, 3 cycle spins) and then regis-
tered to the average image using the TurboReg ImageJ plug-in using rigid body transformations. Cellular region of interests (ROIs)
were semi-automatically selected, based on Rajasethupathy et al. (2015), and manually verified. Contaminating neuropil signal was
estimated from an annulus surrounding each soma mask and removed. The contaminating signal from the surrounding neuropil was
removed using the function F(t) = Fsoma(t)-0.7*Fneuropil(t) (Chen et al., 2013b), where Fsoma(t) is the somatic DF/F0 and Fneuropil(t) is the
DF/F0 from an annulus 4 pixels wide surrounding each soma mask, and including only pixels with a fluorescence standard deviation
at least less than two times the standard deviation of the somatic trace (Peters et al., 2014). DF(t)/F0 = (F(t)-F0)/ F0 was computed as
using the running 20th percentile average over a 10 s timewindow for F0. The resulting Ca2+ traces were then processed using a Mar-
kov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm to produce a de-noised, event-based activity trace (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016). The full
frame fluorescence was computed by summing all of the pixels in each frame on each time point, and then computing DF/F0 the
same way. Imaged fields of view were registered across mice. Peaks in cellular two-photon traces had a median signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), across cells and multiple fields of view, of 13, ranging from 4 to 24, with a median DF/F0 noise of 0.03. Noise was calculated as
the standard deviation of the raw DF/F0 signal minus the de-noised DF/F0 signal. Signal magnitude was computed as the mean value
of all peaks that were greater than three standard deviations above the noise. SNR was then computed as signal magnitude divided
by noise. Cells that were determined to be task-selective were used for subsequent analysis. Task-selective cells were defined as
cells that fired significantly more during the task than during the baseline period, with significance determined by comparison to a
bootstrapped null distribution of cell activity shuffled in time.
The location of each two-photon field of view relative to the calibration image was calculated using a fixed, calibrated linear
mapping between translation stage XY coordinates and sCMOS camera pixel coordinates. Calibration images (and thus field of
view locations) were then registered across sessions using manual keypoints.
Clustering Analysis
To analyze the different response types of neurons, we applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering with complete linkage to the first
3 principal component loadings across cells (comprising > 95% of the variance), computed by performing PCA on average timeseries
of individual cells on Hit trials. Manual inspection of running the algorithm with different numbers of clusters revealed that five clusters
best fit our qualitative assessment of response categories.
ROC Analysis
This analysis sought to distinguish between Go and No-Go trials based on the activity of each cell or cortical region in each trial (Chen
et al., 2013a). Classification was based on a comparison of the Ca2+ transient from each cell or cortical region during the 2 s following
odor onset to the mean trace during that time window for that cell or cortical region on either Hit or Correct Reject trials. Each trial was
assigned a ‘discrimination variable’ (DV) equal to the dot product between the activity trace on that trial and the difference between
the mean activity trace on all other trials of that type except for that trial, and the mean activity trace on all trials of the other type. Trial
type was assigned based on whether the DV was greater than a criterion value. An ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve was
computed by systematically varying this criterion value, and computing the probability that either Hit (x axis) or Correct Reject (y axis)
trial exceeded that criterion value. The area under this curve was then computed to find the fraction of trials on which an ideal
observer could discriminate trial type using the DV. To find the chance performance for each neuron, the trial labels were shuffled
1000 times and the percent correctly discriminated was computed. Only cells whose performance was greater than the mean of
95th percentile of this shuffled distribution were plotted in Figure 2A.
Model-based Analysis
We created a GLM to predict each cell’s denoised DF/F trace from a collection of input variables representing progression of the task
and licking in a given trial. For every trial, we parameterized the task progression and licking behavior with a matrix of indicator vari-
ables. Indicator variables representing the task were constructed such that a single variable was provided for the occurrence of every
time frame from odor onset to the end of the reward period (with an 100ms time window), and had a value of 1 200ms preceding its
respective time frame and 0 otherwise. Indicator variables representing licking modeled lick onset, lick bout, and lick offset, such that
a single variable represented a single time frame in which licking onset, lick bout, or lick offset occurred. These variables were
1 300ms preceding the occurrence of the corresponding lick frame and 0 otherwise. Licking was modeled only if it occurred 2 s after
a previous bout. While variables representing the task progression were constant for every trial, variables representing the licking
behavior varied across trial. We trained a GLM for each cell by concatenating parameterized input matrices for a subset of trials

 and fitting the corresponding vector of parameters using ridge regression to concatenated DF/F traces for the corresponding trials.
We then evaluated our model by predicting traces of held out test trials, retaining only those models whose predictions were deemed
significant by bootstrapping.
Sources and mitigation of non Ca2+-dependent signals (related to Figure 3)
There are a number of potential artifact sources in widefield calcium imaging, including movement, bleaching, and autofluorescence.
We minimized movement artifacts by using a stainless steel headbar that had contact points both above the cerebellum and anterior
to the olfactory bulb to ensure that the entire skull was rigidly fixed. Although brain movement within a fixed skull is often problematic
for cellular resolution imaging, in our two-photon cellular resolution datasets brain motion was generally on the order of tens of
microns. Because the spatial resolution of widefield imaging is more mesoscopic (on the order of hundreds of microns), motion
should therefore not be a primary source of artifacts. Bleaching was also not apparent at the power densities used.
However, as we did observe artifactual signal in Thy1-GFP control mice (which should have no calcium dependent signal), we
determined that the most prominent artifacts were likely due to autofluorescence and hemodynamic absorption (Vanni and Murphy,
2014). In order to distinguish between calcium-dependent signal and non-calcium-dependent artifacts, we used illumination multi-
plexing. Previous work has shown that when excited with 410 nm light as opposed to 488 nm light, the fluorescence emission of
GCaMP is essentially calcium-independent (Lerner et al., 2015; Zalocusky et al., 2016). Further, the ratio of absorption of oxygenated
versus deoxygenated hemoglobin is nearly identical at those wavelengths (1.535 versus 1.52) (Robles et al., 2010), and both wave-
lengths fall within the flavoprotein autofluorescence excitation spectrum, which fluoresces linearly with the concentration of flavopro-
tein (Husson et al., 2007). By using 410 nm and 488 nm light, we could maintain a fully epifluorescent, dichroic-based illumination
system, in contrast to reflectance based hemodynamic measurement techniques that use off-axis illumination that requires a
more ad hoc optical system (Wekselblatt et al., 2016). Additionally, with this approach, we directly measure the effect on emitted
fluorescence of these as well as other, potentially undiagnosed, noise sources.
We recorded complementary, interleaved 15 Hz videos by alternating illumination every other camera frame. After demultiplexing,
we used the calcium-independent signal to mitigate non-GCaMP related artifacts in the calcium-dependent signal. There is prece-
dent in the literature for both linear (Frostig et al., 1990; Kim et al., 2016; Spors and Grinvald, 2002; Wekselblatt et al., 2016) and divi-
sive (Akemann et al., 2012; Kramer and Pearlstein, 1979) approaches to removing background signal in optically recorded non-single
cell resolution neural data. Both are effective because, approximated by a first order Taylor expansion, they are equivalent. In partic-
ular, Fcorrected = Fc = F/ Rm = [F0 (1+DF)] / [Rm0 (1 + D Rm)] z[F0 / Rm0](1 + DF) (1 - D Rm), and thus DFc = [Rm0 / F0] Fc - 1zDF - D Rm,
where F is the calcium-dependent signal; F0 is the baseline signal; DF = [F - F0]/F0 ; Fc is the corrected signal; and Rm is the multi-
plicative calcium-independent signal (Wekselblatt et al., 2016) and Fc0 = F0/Rm0. Further, because there are also additive noise terms,
specified as Ra, including background and autofluorescence, we ultimately wanted to compute DFc zDF - aDRm – bD Ra where
a and b are (unknown) scaling factors that represent the different relative signal strengths in the single measured calcium-indepen-
dent recording channel. To approximate these factors, before subtraction, we low-pass filtered DR to remove high frequency noise
that is uncorrelated with the calcium-dependent signal, and then scaled DR to minimize the sum of squared difference with DF, thus
removing the overall calcium-independent component of DF. We empirically tested both additive and divisive approaches using
spontaneous data from Thy1-GFP mice, which should exhibit no calcium-dependent signal. We found that both approaches offered
similar performance for mitigating background artifacts, although subtraction performed better and more consistently. We hypoth-
esize that this results from the fact that the background is a mixture of both additive and multiplicative factors, as well as the higher
susceptibility of a divisive approach to magnifying additive noise that is also present in the calcium-independent signal.
