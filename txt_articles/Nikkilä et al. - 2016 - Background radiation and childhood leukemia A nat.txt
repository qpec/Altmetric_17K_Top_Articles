High doses of ionizing radiation are an established cause of childhood leukemia. However, substantial uncertainty remains
about the effect of low doses of radiation, including background radiation and potential differences between genetic sub-
groups of leukemia have rarely been explored. We investigated the effect of the background gamma radiation on childhood
leukemia using a nationwide register-based case-control study. For each of the 1,093 cases, three age- and gender matched
controls were selected (N 5 3,279). Conditional logistic regression analyses were adjusted for confounding by Down syndrome,
birth weight (large for gestational age), and maternal smoking. Complete residential histories and previously collected survey
data of the background gamma radiation in Finland were used to assess the exposure of the study subjects to indoor and out-
door gamma radiation. Overall, background gamma radiation showed a non-significant association with the OR of childhood
leukemia (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05 for 10 nSv/h increase in average equivalent dose rate to red bone marrow). In subgroup
analyses, age group 2–<7 years displayed a larger effect (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01, 1.60 for 1 mSv increase in equivalent cumu-
lative dose to red bone marrow). Suggestive difference in OR by genetic subtype was found. Our results provide further sup-
port to the notion that low doses of ionizing radiation increase the risk for childhood leukemia, particularly at age 2–<7
years. Our findings suggest a larger effect of radiation on leukemia with high hyperpdiploidy than other subgroups, but this
result requires further confirmation.
Childhood leukemia is a heterogeneous disease consisting of
distinct clinical subtypes and characterized by specific chro-
mosomal translocations or mutations.1 Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), which encompasses around 85% of all child-
hood leukemias, has two major genetic subtypes both com-
prising �25–30% of the cases: high hyperdiploid (HeH) and
TEL-AML1 (TA) fusion precursor B-ALL.1
The etiology and environmental risk factors for childhood
leukemia remain largely unknown. The few established risk
factors include high doses of ionizing radiation, Down syn-
drome, and large birth weight for ALL.2–5
Based on studies of atomic bomb survivors and other pop-
ulations, radiation is known to cause leukemia.2 In general,
children have a larger risk per dose unit than adults.2 While
the leukemogenic effect of moderate-to-high-dose radiation is
well established, low doses of background radiation have also
been suggested to increase leukemia risk though the shape of
the dose-response remains uncertain implying a small incre-
mental risk from the natural background gamma radiation.6,7
We set out to investigate the relationship between back-
ground gamma radiation and risk of childhood leukemia
based on a nationwide register-based case-control study. We
hypothesized that low-dose radiation from background gam-
ma radiation will pose a risk of childhood leukemia in accor-
dance with the linear no-threshold model.8 We also evaluated
potential differences in risk (effect modification) by age group
and the genetic subtypes of ALL. We estimated lifetime
cumulative doses and average dose rates to the red bone mar-
row (RBM) from background radiation using information on
indoor and outdoor survey data and housing types during
the lifespans of the children. Different subtypes of leukemia
in terms of cell type, genetic aberrations and age at diagnosis
were separately analyzed.

 (M9800–M9948 in ICD-O-3) in Finland in 1990–2011, iden-
tified from the Finnish Cancer Registry (N 5 1100). Each
case was matched by gender and year of birth to three con-
trols at the Population Register Center. Each control was
assigned a reference date identical to the diagnosis date of
the respective case, so that the controls were of similar age as
their case at the date up to which exposure was analyzed
(end of the exposure period). A 2-year minimum latency
period was assumed in the main analysis based on previous
knowledge resulting in zero exposure for subjects younger
than 2 years at the reference date.
Data collection
The data obtained from the Finnish Cancer Register con-
tained the diagnosis (ICD-O-3 code), month and year of the
diagnosis and date of birth. The diagnosis was classified into
three categories: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), and others. Seven cases without a
valid personal identification number or prohibiting the use of
their information at the population register were excluded
(3 1 4 5 7) (Fig. 1), leaving 1093 cases for the analysis. For
the matched cases and controls, Population Register Center
provided complete residential histories from birth to the ref-
erence date, including moving dates, municipalities of resi-
dence, as well as coordinates and building identification
codes for each residence. Of the study subjects, 51.9% (52.1%
of cases and 51.9% of controls) had lived in only one dwell-
ing and 10.1% of study subjects (9.5% of cases and 10.3% of
controls) in 4 or more dwellings (Supporting Information
Fig. S1). Building codes were missing for 3.6% (4.4% for
cases and 3.3% for controls) of the buildings and in such
cases; the typical building type of the municipality was
assigned (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
Data on diagnosis of Down syndrome were obtained from
Register of Congenital Malformations by the National Insti-
tute of Health and Welfare. Data on gestational weeks and
birth weights were obtained from the Medical Birth Register
for all but 184 (18.6%) cases and 511 (15.6%) controls. Large
for gestational age (LGA) was defined as birth weight exceed-
ing the 90th percentile given the gestational weeks.9 Maternal
smoking data was obtained from the Medical Birth Register
and data was missing for 200 cases (18.3%) and 563 controls
(17.2%). The implications of these missing data can be visual-
ized in Figure 1.
Genetic data for cases were obtained from the university
hospitals in charge of treatment of all childhood leukemias in
Finland (Helsinki, Tampere, Turku, Oulu, and Kuopio). The
genetic aberrations were classified as TEL-AML1, high hyper-
diploid (HeH), other abnormalities and normal (no detected
abnormalities). Data were missing or unavailable for 146
(13.3%) patients, mostly due to limited availability of genetic
tests during the early study period. The relatively low propor-
tion of TEL-AML1 cases in our material (9.2%) resulted from
the fact that testing for this genetic subtype began in Finland
after year 1998. The proportion of TEL-AML1 cases remains
relatively stable (14.1%) from the year 1998 onwards.
The data on dose rates of natural background gamma
radiation outdoors was obtained from STUK—Radiation and
Nuclear Safety Authority, encoded in a map of 8 km 3 8 km
squares based on a nationwide mobile survey carried out in
1978–198010 (Fig. 2). We also obtained dose rates calculated
for each of the 355 Finnish municipalities from STUK. The
nationwide average dose rate outdoors was 51 nSv/h. For the
residencies abroad (n 5 63, 0.8% of all residencies), we used
world’s average natural background radiation value reported
by UNSCEAR (55.3 nSv h21 effective dose rate).8 The doses
of gamma radiation indoors are based on measurements in
346 randomly chosen dwellings. The national average dose
rate in houses was 41 nSv h21 and in flats 70 nSv h21.10 The
difference is mainly due to the concrete used as the building
material in blocks of flats increasing gamma radiation levels.
The indoor rates correlate with local outdoor gamma radia-
tion levels. These correlations were utilized for converting
local outdoor dose rates to indoor dose rates.
The data on Chernobyl fallout was collected by a nation-
wide mobile survey in 1986–1987.11 A square map of the
Chernobyl fallout representing the Cs-137 activity in October
1, 1986 was transformed into dose rates (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S3). Doses were calculated with a function of
dose rate consisting of three individual parts. The first ranged
2 weeks from the initial fallout and, like the second part, was
fitted strictly on measured data. Correction for radioactive
decay of all relevant short-lived radionuclides was also
applied. The third part continued from 18 months after the
accident based on exponential decay representing the effec-
tive decay and washout of the fallout nuclides, mainly Cs-
137. Results from fixed radiation monitoring stations were
utilized.

What’s new?
While exposure to moderate and high levels of ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for childhood leukemia, whether
low-level exposure also contributes to this risk remains uncertain. In this investigation of more than 1,000 Finnish patients
with complete residential histories, no significant association was observed between background radiation and overall risk of
childhood leukemia. Subgroup analyses, however, revealed a significant elevation in risk for individuals age 2–<7 years, the
age group with the highest incidence of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in Finland. Of genetic subtypes of ALL, risk
appeared to be highest for high hyperdiploidy.

 received indoors, separate shielding factors for houses and
blocks of flats were used. The shielding factor for blocks of
flats (0.04) is markedly higher than that for houses (0.37).10
Cosmic radiation was not included in our analysis, because
Finland is a fairly flat country with little variation in dose
rate. Thus, it would have introduced no variation between
cases and controls. The altitudes of the residencies of study
subjects were analyzed to confirm the assumption.
To account for the markedly different dose rates and
shielding effect by dwelling type, we classified each residential
building as a house (single family and terraced houses) or a
block of flats. The Population Register Center provided the
information for 95% (94% for cases and 95% for controls) of
the dwellings, and the classification was based on available
documentation on the type of the dwelling or on the number
of floors and dwellings in the building, and the presence of
an elevator. We obtained data on the types of dwellings of
children from Statistics Finland to model the residencies,
which could not be classified. With these data, we could
define average dwelling type coefficient for children of differ-
ent ages during different calendar years and therefore better
approximate the conversion from outdoor absorbed dose
rates to the indoor dose rates.
The percentage of time spent indoors (occupancy) was
modeled according to a Finnish study providing age group

 specific estimates.12 For foreign residencies, we used occupan-
cy estimates by UNSCEAR (0.8).8
Data analysis
We used a coefficient of 0.7 Sv/Gy to convert absorbed dose
rates from environmental measurements (from natural back-
ground radiation and Chernobyl fallout) to effective dose
rates.8 We then applied the occupancy coefficient and coeffi-
cient of dwelling type to obtain effective dose rates for each
residency by area and age.10 Cumulative effective doses for
each residential period were calculated as time integrals of
dose rates, and summed to obtain lifetime cumulative effec-
tive doses. The average effective dose rates for each person
was calculated by dividing cumulative dose by total residen-
tial history up to a date 2 years prior to diagnosis or refer-
ence date.
We calculated equivalent RBM doses from effective doses
in the same manner as Kendall et al. based on the results
published by Saito et al and Petoussi et al.13–15 We assumed
a linear relationship with age by converting adult effective
dose rates to children of different ages instead of assuming a
cubic root function in relation to the weight of the growing
child.
Statistical methods
Odds ratios and their confidence intervals were calculated
using conditional logistic regression. We used 5% as the level
of significance and all p values are two-sided. Crude ORs
were used if adjustment did not alter the OR more than 0.05

Effect modification i.e., difference between subgroups was

Results
In a nationwide register-based study, we identified a total of
1,093 leukemia cases diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 in
Finland. The majority of the cases were acute lymphoblastic
leukemias (81.1%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia
(13.0%) (Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was 4.52
years (IQR 2.72, 8.23 years) and for study subjects with non-
zero radiation exposure, 5.23 years (IQR 3.44, 9.05) (Support-
ing Information Fig. S4). Of the specific genetic alterations,
high hyperdiploidy (HeH) and TEL-AML1 (TA) fusion gene
were the most common abnormalities.
The median equivalent dose rate to red bone marrow
(from natural background radiation and Chernobyl fallout
combined) was 67.2 nSv h21 for cases and 66.4 nSv h21 for
controls. The average equivalent dose rate to red bone mar-
row (Fig. 3) showed peaks at 67 and 94 nSv h21, due to the
large number of houses and flats in the Helsinki metropolitan
area (19.4% of the dwellings). The distribution of cumulative
equivalent dose to RBM (Fig. 3) followed a log-normal distri-
bution, with the smoother shape due to contribution from
several past dwellings. The median cumulative equivalent
dose to RBM for the cases was 1.96 mSv and for the controls
1.90 mSv. The median dose received only from Chernobyl
fallout was 0.1 mSv for both the cases and the controls and
the corresponding average dose rate was 2.0 nSv h21. The
distributions of the dose rates from the Chernobyl fallout
and natural background gamma both followed a log-normal
distribution. The median altitude for the cases’ residences
was 82 m (IQR 23 m, 108 m) and for the controls 74 m
(IQR 21 m, 104 m).
A very high leukemia OR was observed for children with
Down syndrome (OR 60.0, 95% CI 14.5, 248) and an
increased OR was also related to LGA (OR 1.44, 95% CI
1.14, 1.81). For maternal smoking during pregnancy, a non-
significantly elevated OR was found (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.94,
1.42).
The overall OR for leukemia was 1.01 (95% CI 0.97, 1.05)
for each 10 nSv h21 increase in the equivalent dose rate to
RBM, and for a 1 mSv increase in cumulative equivalent
dose to RBM, the OR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.89, 1.06) (Table 2).
When divided into exposure quartiles, the main OR increase
was between the lowest quarter (reference) and the two inter-
mediate fourths (Fig. 4).
There was no statistically significant difference between the
major cell types of leukemia in OR related to background
radiation, though a higher point estimate was seen for ALL
than AML. However, OR related to background radiation var-
ied
significantly
by
age
at
reference
date
(interaction
p 5 0.005). In the analysis by age group, a significantly elevat-
ed OR (OR 1.05 per 10 nSv h21, 95% CI 1.00, 1.10 for dose
rate and OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01, 1.60 per 1 mSv for cumulative
dose) was found for ages 2–<7 years, the time of the peak in
incidence of ALL and largest numbers of cases. The dose-
response for the younger age group is shown in Figure 4.
For the major genetic subtypes of ALL, cases with a HeH
genotype showed a significant increase in OR with dose rate
from background radiation (OR 1.11 per 10 nSv h21, 95% CI
1.02, 1.21), though not with cumulative dose (OR 1.30, 95%
CI 0.94, 1.80 per mSv). Yet, the risk estimates did not vary

 significantly between the genetic abnormalities (interaction
p 5 0.10).
In exploratory analyses by age and genetic aberration,
cases aged 2–<7 years with HeH genetic subtype showed the
most elevated ORs (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.10, 3.65 for 1 mSv
increase in cumulative equivalent dose to RBM).
A total of 26 (2.8%) of the cases and 36 (1.3%) controls
with non-zero radiation exposure had lived abroad and the
uncertainty in their exposure assessment could affect the
results. However, excluding these subjects did not yield dif-
ferent results compared with the primary analysis (OR 1.01
per 10 nSv h21, 95% CI 0.97, 1.06 for all cases) nor did
adjustment for residence abroad in the regression model.
Similarly, exclusion of subjects with missing data on birth
weight (184 cases and 511 controls) did not alter the results
for background radiation (OR 1.02 per 10 nSv h21, 95% CI
0.97, 1.06 for all cases). In addition, we approximated expo-
sure in utero by assuming a 9-month exposure for each case
and control in the residence at birth (Supporting Information
Table S1). The effect of the 2-year minimum latency period
was also approximated and Supporting Information Table S2
displays the results ignoring any latency. Neither these
approaches yielded materially different results.
The potential effect of CT-imaging was evaluated in vari-
ous hypothetical bias scenarios: cases receiving 20% larger
dose from CT than controls (OR 1.03 per 10 nSv h21, 95%
CI 0.99, 1.07), all subjects in the highest (OR 1.01 per 10
nSv h21, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05) or the lowest (OR 1.01 per 10
nSv h21, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05) quartile of background radiation
receiving 20% larger doses, cases in the highest (OR 1.02 per
10 nSv h21, 95% CI 0.98, 1.06) or the lowest (OR 1.02 per
10 nSv h21, 95% CI 0.98, 1.06) quartile of background radia-
tion receiving 20% larger dose.
Discussion
We estimated the contribution of background gamma radia-
tion on risk for childhood leukemia based on a nationwide
register-based case-control study in Finland. Overall, a small,
non-significant excess risk was found for dose rate, while the
point estimate for cumulative dose was below unity. Howev-

 consistent with earlier studies of background radiation. Fur-
thermore, a significant effect was observed for the age group
2–<7 years at diagnosis. In addition, we observed suggestive
differences in OR by genetic subtype, but heterogeneity
between these groups was not significant. Likewise, no signifi-
cant heterogeneity was observed between different cell types
(ALL, AML, others).
Our risk estimates were more stable for dose rate than
cumulative dose, partly reflecting the exposure distribution
(most subjects with dose rates 40–100 nSv h21 and cumula-
tive doses 0–10 mSv). Furthermore, the dose rate does not
accumulate with age, though some regression towards the
mean with age is expected due to increasing moves and num-
ber of residences. Therefore, in the analyses of dose rate,
cases at all ages contribute with equal weight, while for
cumulative doses, cases diagnosed at older ages show the
highest exposures and hence have more influence on the
effect at highest doses, which drive the linear risk estimates.
The anticipated effect size is small, as in the Life Span
Study of atomic bomb survivors; the excess relative risk esti-
mate for leukemia for children exposed at ages 0–9 years is
of the order of 10 per Sv, corresponding to RR 1.01 per
mSv.18 Our results are largely in this range, though the confi-
dence intervals are generally wide enough to cover ORs rang-
ing from no effect to risks that are an order of magnitude
higher. Our results are also compatible with other studies of
background radiation and childhood leukemia.6,7 The risk
estimate was 1.12 per mSv (95% CI 1.03, 1.22) in the British
study and 1.04 (1.00, 1.08) in the Swiss study. The highest
ORs we found for the age group 2–<7 years, as well as the
high hyperdiploids are well above the anticipated level, and
may partly reflect chance variation.
We evaluated the risk related to background gamma radi-
ation in relation to specific ALL subtypes, with the rationale
that they represent different disease entities with potentially
differing pathogenetic processes and contrasting roles for
varying etiologic agents. There is little evidence to demon-
strate differences in etiology between leukemia subtypes.2,19,20
Our study has several strengths. Our material includes a
comprehensive and representative roster of all childhood leu-
kemia cases diagnosed in Finland and the controls were iden-
tified
from
the
population
registry
with
complete
enumeration of all residents of Finland, thus avoiding any
selection bias. Unlike previous studies on the subject, we
were able to construct complete residential histories for all
subjects including both place of residence and type of dwell-
ing, with register-based data eliminating recall bias. For expo-
sure assessment, we compiled dose rates from both natural
sources and the transient increase due to the Chernobyl fall-
out. For converting outdoor to indoor dose rates, we used
experimental conversion factors by type of dwelling, taking
into account the effect of building materials, while also fac-
toring in occupancy of Finnish children and varying body
composition by age during childhood. Our results also
showed the effects of known risk factors for childhood leuke-
mia, reaffirming the validity of the data and minimizing con-
founding. Furthermore, this is the first study in exploring the
role of background radiation in relation to various genetic
subtypes of leukemia.
Some shortcomings may limit our ability to precisely cap-
ture the effect of background radiation on leukemia risk.
Long-term individual-level dose monitoring would provide
the ideal exposure estimates, but it is not feasible. Recon-
structing exposure from surveys providing estimates by geo-
graphic area induces inevitably some misclassification. Some
variation can be expected to occur even between similar
dwelling types within an 8 km 3 8 km square used as a geo-
graphical unit in our analysis, and with children with con-
trasting occupancy. Such misclassification can be expected to
be nondifferential, i.e., affect the cases and controls similarly,
and hence attenuate the observed effect from the true one.
This very likely also applies to radiation exposure from other
sources, notably medical diagnostic radiation. The mean

 annual effective dose from medical radiation in Finland is 0.45
mSv (2012), but for children it is markedly lower due to strict
imaging guidelines especially with CT scans, which have the
largest contribution to the annual dose from medical expo-
sure.8,21 Also, CT usage on Finland is less frequent than many
other industrialised countries and only 1.7% of CT scans in
Finland were performed on children.22 Hence, medical radia-
tion exposure is relatively small compared to annual doses
observed in our study (0.59 mSv to RBM). In addition, CT-
imaging would cause confounding only if it is associated with
natural background gamma radiation exposure.
We evaluated the potential impact of CT examinations
through quantitative bias analyses. We obtained estimates of
effective dose from the literature23 and computed average
annual doses using data on the use of diagnostic imaging
obtained from Finnish radiation and nuclear safety authori-
ty.22 The average effective dose per CT examination in Fin-
land was 2.75 mSv, corresponding to an annual average
effective dose of 0.02 mSv per child, which is minimal com-
pared to background radiation. We also evaluated various
hypothetical bias scenarios: cases receiving 20% larger dose
from CT than controls, all subjects in the highest or the low-
est quartile of background radiation receiving 20% larger
doses, cases in the highest or the lowest quartile of back-
ground radiation receiving 20% larger dose. Overall, these
analyses revealed no material confounding indicating the
robustness of our estimates in relation to CT examinations.
The statistical power was relatively low, given the small
expected effect size. The minimum sample size for studies of
natural background radiation has been calculated as 7,800
cases with five times as many controls to reach a statistical
power of 80%.24 These power calculations do not, however,
take into account the precision and validity of the exposure
assessment, which is also an important determinant of the
amount of information that a study can contribute. For our
study, improvement in these aspects is the most important
addition to the evidence, compared with earlier publications.
Conclusions
Overall, we found no significant increase in OR of childhood
leukemia with dose or dose rate from background radiation.
However, in subgroup analyses, we observed a significantly
increased OR in relation to both dose rate and cumulative
dose in the agegroup 2–<7 years. In addition, leukemia with
high hyperdiploidy showed a significant association with
background gamma radiation, unlike other genetic subtypes,
but this requires further confirmation.
