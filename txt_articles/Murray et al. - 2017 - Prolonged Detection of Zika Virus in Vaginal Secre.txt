Infection with Zika virus is an emerging public health crisis. 
We observed prolonged detection of virus RNA in vaginal 
mucosal swab specimens and whole blood for a US traveler 
with acute Zika virus infection who had visited Honduras. 
These findings advance understanding of Zika virus infec-
tion and provide data for additional testing strategies.
Z
ika virus is a rapidly emerging mosquitoborne virus 
(1). In May 2015, Brazil reported autochthonous trans-
mission of Zika virus (2). Over the course of 1 year, Zika 
virus spread to >50 countries and territories throughout the 
Americas (3). With the now confirmed link of Zika virus in-
fection during pregnancy leading to fetal microcephaly (4) 
and reported cases transmitted by sexual contact (5), it is vi-
tal to understand the natural history of infection. We report 
an acute case of Zika virus infection in a traveler returning 
from Honduras to the United States and results from serial 
specimens collected for >11 weeks. These new data might 
serve as a potential guide for public health policy.
The Study
This study was reviewed and approved by the Baylor Col-
lege of Medicine Institutional Review Board (H-30533). A 
previously healthy, nonpregnant, 26 year-old non-Hispanic 
white woman returned to the United States from Tegucigal-
pa, Honduras, during mid-May 2016. Five days after her re-
turn (day 0), signs and symptoms consistent with Zika virus 
infection developed, beginning with rash and subsequent 
fever, headache, and conjunctivitis (Table). Fever and rash 
continued through day 5 and day 6, respectively. By day 15, 
desquamation was noted on the palms of both hands and 
soles of both feet. By day 17, all symptoms had resolved.
Serial specimens were longitudinally collected for >11 
weeks. The first specimens were collected on day 0, two 
hours after onset of rash and 2 h before development of 
fever. All remaining specimens were collected at 3, 8, 14, 
21, 28, 35, 42, 53, 64, and 81 days after onset of illness. 
Specimens included serum, whole blood (EDTA anticoag-
ulated), urine, saliva, and vaginal mucosa swabs. The pa-
tient was not menstruating when vaginal swab specimens 
were collected.
RNA was extracted from serum, whole blood, and 
urine samples by using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin 
Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Oral and vaginal mucosal swab 
specimens were collected by using the BBL CultureSwab 
Collection and Transport System (Becton Dickinson, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Specimens were incubated in 
250 µL of AL/carrier RNA lysis buffer for 10 min at room 
temperature; 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline was add-
ed before RNA extraction. 
Eluted RNA from all samples was tested in a quanti-
tative reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) 
that included a TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix 
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) and a 
TaqMan ZIKV 1107 assay (6) with appropriate positive 
and negative controls. We detected Zika virus RNA in se-
rum up to day 8 after onset of illness and in body fluids up 
to day 14; whole blood samples remained positive up to 
day 81 (Figure). Results of qRT-PCR of saliva were nega-
tive after day 8, and results for urine and vaginal swab 
specimens did not become negative until after day 14. We 
tested a day 0 serum sample for dengue virus and chi-
kungunya virus RNA by using TaqMan assays (7,8); all 
results were negative.
Virus isolations were performed for Vero cells in 
complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium contain-
ing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were 
infected with day 0 serum samples (or mock-infected with 
cell culture medium) and observed for cytopathic effects. 
Cell culture supernatants were sampled 13 days after cell 
culture infection, and RNA was extracted and tested for 
Zika virus RNA. Supernatant was collected on day 14, and 
viral titer was 8.5 × 105 PFU/mL by plaque assay. Attempts 
to isolate virus from the day 64 erythrocyte fraction showed 
no evidence of cytopathic effects, and first and second pas-
sages were negative by qRT-PCR. Because the day 81 
whole blood specimen was still positive by qRT-PCR, we 
used ficoll to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells

and erythrocytes and found that erythrocytes were the only 
fraction positive for Zika virus RNA. The partial sequence 
of the virus we isolated was submitted to GenBank under 
accession no. KX928077.
On day 8, plasma was evaluated by using an ELISA (9) 
to assess IgM and IgG binding to Zika virus envelope pro-
tein (Zika Virus Envelope Recombinant Protein, #R01635; 
Meridian Life Sciences, Memphis, TN, USA); positive re-
sults were obtained. Plasma-neutralizing antibodies against 
Zika virus were detected (50% focus reduction neutraliza-
tion test titer 1:1,438), but neutralization of dengue virus 
serotypes 1–4 was not detected. These findings indicated a 
robust Zika virus–specific humoral response.
Conclusions
Given recent concerns regarding the ongoing epidemic of 
Zika virus disease, there is an urgent need to document the 
natural history of infection and assess transmission risk 
through nonvector routes. We had the unique opportunity 
to prospectively monitor the clinical and virologic course 
of Zika virus infection in a patient starting on day 0.
We detected viral shedding in vaginal secretions up 
to day 14. Only 1 human study reported Zika virus RNA 
in cervical mucous up to day 11 after onset of signs and 
symptoms (10). These findings are supported by recent re-
sults for 2 animal models. Zika virus (Asian lineage strain) 
RNA was detected in vaginal swab specimens obtained on 
days 1 and 7 postinfection of nonpregnant female rhesus 
macaques (11). Zika virus replication was also detected in 
vaginal mucosa of mice (12).
We could not determine whether positive results by 
qRT-PCR indicated replicating virus. With the recent find-
ing of possible female-to-male virus transmission (5), in-
fectious virus might be present in the vaginal canal and 
could serve as a risk for sexual or intrapartum transmission.
We detected viral RNA in serum up to 8 days and in 
whole blood up to 81 days after onset of illness. Diagno-
sis of infection currently relies mostly on PCR detection 
of Zika virus in serum. With concerns for Zika virus infec-
tion during pregnancy, screening of whole blood might be 
more sensitive in identifying infected patients, particularly 
if an asymptomatic patient has traveled from an area where 
exposure is a concern, had high-risk sexual contact, or is 
convalescing and PCR for a serum sample would probably 
yield a negative result.
Our observation is further supported by another recent 
study that found whole blood samples positive for Zika vi-
rus by PCR up to 2 months postinfection (13). In our study, 
we confirmed that a positive result was attributed to the 
erythrocyte component of whole blood, similar to what 
has been found in studies of West Nile virus (14,15). One 
study found that West Nile virus adheres to erythrocytes 
and could infect Vero cells (14). Although we did not ob-
serve infectious virus associated with erythrocyte positivity 
for Zika virus at day 64, this finding is still of concern and 
requires further investigation. Because the last whole blood 
sample collected on day 81 was positive for Zika virus 
RNA, follow-up testing will continue to define the longev-
ity of viremia in whole blood.
In conclusion, this case study advances understanding 
of the natural history of Zika virus. It provides new find-
ings, including detection of Zika virus RNA in vaginal

Rash spread to the legs and upper arms, 
continuing to appear flat, mottled, and became 
pruritic. Fatigue persisted, along with headache 
with light sensitivity, myalgias (particularly in the 
back and shoulders), and nausea with anorexia. 
The patient reported that her eyes were painful to 
open, but upon examination, the eyes appeared 
normal with no redness or swelling.

The rash continued to progress to the entire body, 
but with decreasing pruritus and increasing 
papular appearance. Conjunctivitis and cervical 
adenopathy were noted on physician 
examination, and the patient reported increased 
myalgias and dysphagia, with development of 
painful vesicles throughout the oral mucosa.

secretions up to day 14 and in erythrocytes up to day 81, 
the longest reported duration of detection in this sample 
type. A desquamating rash developed on the hands and 
feet of the patient, which we presume was related to her 
infection. To our knowledge, this finding has not been pre-
viously described.
Additional studies involving larger cohorts of acutely 
ill Zika virus–infected patients tested over a longer period 
would solidify our understanding of the natural history 
of infection, duration of viral detection, and clinical out-
comes. These studies will enable further development of 
evidence-based policies regarding diagnosis and clinical 
management of Zika virus–infected patients.
