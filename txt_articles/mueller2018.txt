ABSTRACT 
During volcanic eruptions and their aftermath, communities may be concerned about the 
impacts of inhaling volcanic ash. Access to effective respiratory protection (RP) is therefore 
important for many people in volcanic areas all over the world. However, evidence to support 
the use of effective RP during such crises is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to build 
the first evidence base on the effectiveness of common materials used to protect communities 
from ash inhalation in volcanic crises. 
 
Key Words: respirator, facemask, PM2.5, ash, volcano, filtration efficiency 
 
We obtained 17 forms of RP, covering various types of cloth through to disposable masks 
(typically used in occupational settings), which communities are known to wear during volcanic 
crises. The RP materials were characterised and subjected to filtration efficiency (FE) tests, which 
were performed with three challenge dusts: ashes from Sakurajima (Japan) and Soufrière Hills 
(Montserrat) volcanoes and aluminium oxide (Aloxite), chosen as a low-toxicity surrogate dust 
of similar particle size distribution. FE tests were conducted at two concentrations (1.5 mg/m3 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 2 
 
and 2.5 mg/m3) and two flow rates (equivalent to 40 and 80 l/min through 15.9 cm2 sections of 
each RP type). Each material was held in a sample holder and PM2.5 dust concentrations were 
measured both outside the mask material and inside the sample holder to determine FE. A 
limited number of tests were undertaken to assess the effect on FE of wetting a bandana and a 
surgical mask, as well as folding a bandana to provide multiple filter layers.   
Overall, four RP materials performed very well against volcanic ash, with median FEs in excess 
of 98% (N95-equiv., N99-equiv., PM2.5 surgical (Japan), and Basic flat-fold (Indonesia)). The two 
standard surgical masks tested had median FEs of 89-91%. All other materials had median FEs 
ranging from 23-76% with no cloth materials achieving >44%. Folding a bandana resulted in 
better FE (40%; 3x folded) than single-layered material (29%). Wetting the bandana and surgical 
mask material did not improve FE overall.  
This first evidence base on the FE of common materials used to protect communities in volcanic 
crises from ash inhalation has been extended in a companion study (Steinle et al. submitted) on 
the total inward leakage of the best-performing masks when worn by human volunteers. This 
will provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of these RP types. 
INTRODUCTION 
Explosive volcanic eruptions generate volcanic ash through high-energy fragmentation of 
magma. The ash can be distributed in the atmosphere over hundreds to thousands of 
kilometres, depending on the size of the eruption, and may stay in the environment for years 
(Blong, 1984). Ash may also be re-suspended, e.g., through wind, road traffic, or cleaning-up 
activities, which has long-term implications for those populations residing and working in 
affected areas. According to estimations by Small and Naumann (2001), 9% of the world’s 
population live within 100 km of a historically active volcano.

Short-term respiratory health issues observed after volcanic eruptions include exacerbation of 
existing asthma and bronchitis, as well as symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, chest 
tightness, and wheezing (Baxter et al., 1983; Horwell and Baxter, 2006). Regarding long-term 
respiratory effects, development of silicosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
are of most concern, but have not yet been confirmed in volcanic settings (Horwell and Baxter, 
2006). 
Volcanic ash can vary substantially in its physicochemical characteristics and, therefore, its 
potential to be a respiratory health hazard (Damby et al., 2013; Damby et al., 2017; Hillman et 
al., 2012; Horwell et al., 2013; Le Blond et al., 2010). Every eruption generates ash of variable 
particle size distributions (PSD) and composition (Horwell, 2007; Horwell et al., 2007); thus, 
providing accurate, rapid, and timely information on the potential respiratory hazard is a 
challenge for governmental and humanitarian agencies. The International Volcanic Health 
Hazard Network (IVHHN) (www.ivhhn.org) has developed rapid protocols for assessment of 
health-pertinent ash characteristics (Damby et al., 2013; Horwell et al., 2013; Le Blond et al., 
2010), but detailed analysis is rarely possible in the timeframe of an eruption.  
With some eruptions producing ash with substantial quantities of fine-grained material 
(Horwell, 2007), and sometimes with concerning quantities of crystalline silica (Baxter et al., 
1999; Horwell et al., 2014; Horwell et al., 2010), agencies generally take a precautionary 
approach and advise that individuals should protect themselves from ash inhalation (e.g., see 
summary at: http://www.ivhhn.org/resources/global-ash-advice.html; IVHHN, 2017). Advice for 
communities affected by volcanic ash includes avoiding unnecessary exposure and staying 
indoors during ashfall or when ash remains in the environment for prolonged periods. It may 
not always be possible for people to remain indoors for extended periods of time and so they 
may choose, or be advised by governmental or humanitarian agencies, to protect themselves by

wearing a facemask or by improvising a fabric mask from cloth, to filter out ash. Despite its 
importance, evidence to support the efficacy of respiratory protection (RP) for use during 
volcanic crises is lacking (Horwell et al., 2017).  
The effectiveness of RP is dependent on several factors: i) the design, to prevent penetration of 
a specific hazardous substance; ii) reduction of exposure to the level required to protect the 
wearer’s health; and iii) appropriateness for the individual wearer, task, and environment (HSE, 
2013; van der Sande et al., 2008). These factors form the basis for any ‘fit testing’ in a workplace 
setting, where industry certified masks with a known filtration efficiency (FE), i.e., the 
percentage of particles filtered by the RP material, are used, and any leakage due to gaps 
between face and mask into the RP (faceseal leakage) is quantified. Such assessment of 
suitability appears to be completely absent in the community setting for volcanic eruptions. 
Agencies often distribute masks (usually surgical ones) by the million, mostly from existing 
stockpiles for viral pandemics and usually without any information on FE and how to achieve 
best fit (Horwell et al., 2017). The assessment of fit is discussed in Steinle et al. (submitted). The 
ethical implications of agencies recommending and distributing masks in the absence of 
evidence of their efficacy, and without accompanying factual information, are considered 
separately (McDonald and Horwell, 2017).  
In many countries, for occupational settings, use of effective RP is supported by legal 
enforcement, with RP being required to meet national or international standards (e.g., EN 
149:2001, EN 140:1998 in the EU (European Committee for Standardization, 1998, 2001) or 42 
CFR 84 in the US (NIOSH, 1996)). Light-weight, disposable masks/respirators have an additional 
code, such as, in the UK, FFP1 (low efficiency), FFP2 (medium efficiency), or FFP3 (high efficiency) 
(FFP = Filtering Face Piece), with the US N95 standard being roughly equivalent to FFP2, and N99 
being equivalent to FFP3. Such standards are not in place for fashion masks, nuisance-dust

masks, or any type of cloth material used in non-occupational settings (Table 1). Surgical masks 
are designed specifically to stop airborne droplets passing from the respiratory system, including 
from a healthcare worker to a patient, or vice-versa (Lipp, 2003). As such, they are not designed 
for preventing inward penetration of particles and do not conform to the same standards. 
Few published studies have assessed the effectiveness of materials used to protect people from 
inhalation of airborne particulates in non-occupational settings. Methods for testing the FE of 
RP material for non-occupational purposes vary and do not necessarily require human 
volunteers, as the material itself is being tested, rather than the fit of the device to the wearer. 
Some papers report the penetration instead of FE, i.e., the percentage of particles passing 
through the RP material (NB. penetration is the complementary percentage of FE).  
Grinshpun et al. (2009) used a mannequin head to test the penetration of NaCl particles through 
the filter material of an N95 respirator and a surgical mask. The overall penetration for the N95 
filter component was <1% and for the surgical mask, 5-10%. Shakya et al. (2017), using a similar 
methodology, but with polystyrene latex spheres and diesel particles as challenge particles, 
reported surgical masks to have better FE (>78%) than cloth masks (<65%), whilst Bowen (2010), 
also using a mannequin head and saline particles, found FEs of 6% (pre-shaped dust mask), 11% 
(bandana), 33% (surgical mask), and 90% for the N95 mask. Rengasamy et al. (2010) challenged 
different household fabrics, commonly used during pandemic respiratory infections, and 
compared them to N95 respirator material, following the NIOSH particulate respirator test 
protocol (NIOSH, 2007). The household fabrics performed poorly against the NaCl challenge (40–
90% penetration) in comparison to the certified N95 material (0.12% penetration).  
Jung et al. (2014) compared the FE of 44 masks and handkerchiefs commonly used by the general 
public to protect against particulate air pollution from yellow sand in Asia using the Korean Food 
and Drug Safety Administration (KFDA) and NIOSH protocols (NIOSH, 1996) against NaCl and

paraffin oil. Average penetration per mask type ranged from 1% for quarantine masks to 98% 
for handkerchiefs. In a recent study, Cherrie et al. (Accepted) adopted another methodological 
approach using diesel emissions. In this study, samples of popular, commercially-available RP 
materials from China (cloth masks with exchangeable filters) and a selection of unrated and 
standard-tested non-woven masks (including the FFP2 mask used in the current study) were 
fitted on custom-made sample holders in a small exposure chamber (same set-up as this study). 
The median penetration for the FFP2 mask was ~1%.  
There is a general trend that the FE of materials used in commercial facemasks is better than 
that measured for surgical masks, which, in turn, is better than for a range of everyday cloth 
items. As discussed, the challenge particles used in FE studies have previously been NaCl, diesel 
emissions, paraffin oil, or standard polystyrene latex spheres, each with different PSDs 
depending on the purpose of the masks. None of these studies considered volcanic ash particles, 
which tend to be coarser (with a median diameter of several micrometres; Horwell, 2007) than 
urban particulates or pathogens, nor the wide variety of RP typically used in volcanic crises 
around the world. There is evidence that the particle size of the challenge aerosol/dust, as well 
as the mask material and flow rate, impact substantially on the FE. Wake and Brown (1988) 
showed in their experiments that FE varied from 1-55%, depending on particle size of the 
challenge aerosol. Results of previous studies, especially those which used ultrafine, 
homogenous aerosols, can therefore not be directly translated and applied to volcanic ash 
exposures.  
Horwell et al. (2017) gathered information with a rapid questionnaire survey over several days 
immediately after ashfall from Kelud volcano on the city of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This 
questionnaire asked members of the public what type of RP they wore, where they obtained it, 
why they were wearing it, as well as who, if anyone, advised them to wear it and how effective 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

they thought it was. Typical RP used by the public during volcanic crises, such as that given out 
by agencies, bought, and improvised (such as shawls and veils), were obtained from locations in 
Indonesia (I), Japan (J), and Mexico (M), where local communities have recently been affected 
by ashfall. Additionally, disposable, industry-certified masks, t-shirts, and handkerchiefs (the 
latter two observed to be used by individuals in Yogyakarta by Horwell et al. (2017)) were 
sourced online from the UK. 
The information from this survey helped inform the selection of RP materials for which we tested 
the FE in this study. The aim of this study was to build the first evidence base on the effectiveness 
of common materials used to protect communities in volcanic crises from ash inhalation. In a 
companion paper (Part II; Steinle et al., Submitted), we combine these data with results from a 
simulation study assessing Total Inward Leakage (TIL) (a function of both leakage pathways –
through the filter material and through the face seal) of the best-performing masks to provide a 
complete assessment of the effectiveness of these RP types. Overall, this work forms part of a 
larger study focussed on addressing the urgent need to provide evidence-based advice to allow 
humanitarian agencies to distribute or recommend RP based on known effectiveness, comfort, 
and behavioural and cultural considerations (HIVE - A new evidence base for respiratory Health 
Interventions in Volcanic Eruption Crises, http://community.dur.ac.uk/hive.consortium).  
METHODOLOGY 
Respiratory protection selected for testing 
Seventeen RP materials were selected for testing. Some materials were tested under varying 
configurations, for example, a bandana material was tested as a single, double, and triple layer 
of the material, as information gathered by Horwell et al. (2017) showed that people modify 
their RP by adding additional layers (though not necessarily of the same RP material). A limited 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

number of tests were also conducted using the bandana material and a surgical mask after they 
had been soaked in water for a period of 30 seconds and wrung out. This was carried out to test 
a common conception that wetting cloth improves protection from particle inhalation, advice 
given by many health/civil protection agencies around the world (see summary at: 
http://www.ivhhn.org/resources/global-ash-advice.html; IVHHN, 2017), implying that wetting 
cloth (and mask) material is more effective at filtering ash (than not wetting). It is noted, 
however, that an agency in Yogyakarta inform their community that wetted protection lasts less 
long due to the material getting more dirty (Horwell et al., 2017).  
Table 1 provides information and images for each of the RP types, including their style, number 
of layers, and thickness of each layer (measured using a Mitutoyo digital caliper 150mm; Sakado, 
Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 213-8533, Japan). Each RP type was imaged by light microscopy 
(where materials were translucent) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S2600-N at 
20 kV), where opaque. Varying magnifications were used to suit the material types (between 30 
and 100x).  
Challenge particles 
We used two volcanic ash samples collected, pristine, from ash deposited on the ground from 
Soufrière Hills volcano, Montserrat, and Sakurajima volcano, Japan (supplied through CJH). The 
first is quite a fine-grained ash, the second being a coarser ash, as was confirmed by laser-
diffraction particle size analysis (Malvern Mastersizer 3000;  Supplementary Material Figure). 
These differences allowed us to test for changes in FE with particle size, as observed by Wake 
and Brown (1988). In addition, we sourced and assessed the FE of a low-toxicity surrogate: 
aluminium oxide dust (Aloxite, supplied by Washington Mills). Aloxite was selected as the 
challenge particle in the subsequent human volunteer simulation studies for ethical purposes; 
therefore, it was useful to quantify and interpret any FE differences between the ash and Aloxite

(Steinle et al., Submitted). It was chosen as a dust with a similar modal particle size distribution 
to volcanic ash, as opposed to most previously-tested challenge particles, such as NaCl 
(Grinshpun et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2014; Rengasamy et al., 2010) and diesel particulate (Cherrie 
et al., Accepted; Shakya et al., 2017), which generally have a mode of < 1 µm diameter.  
 
Experimental set-up 
Each RP type, and its variation where appropriate, was tested to determine the FE of the 
material by drawing air, loaded with particles, through a known area of the material. A circular 
section was cut out from each RP material and fitted into a sample holder (radius 2.25 cm; area 
= 15.9 cm2). Tests were conducted at two constant flowrates equivalent to 40 l/min and 80 l/min 
through the RP material, scaled proportionately from the area of the mask/material to the area 
of the cut-out section (i.e., 15.9 cm2), to represent breathing during a range of physical activity 
from moderate to high levels (Panis et al 2010). FE is assumed to decrease with increasing 
flowrate (Wake and Brown, 1988). 
Figure 1 illustrates the sampling setup. Sample holders were placed inside a purpose-built 
exposure chamber (0.5 m [L] x 0.25 m [W] x 0.12 m [H]). The particle-air suspension was 
generated using a Venturi nozzle, and a rotating table was loaded with the dust. Each material 
was tested in triplicate per flowrate and at two PM2.5 concentrations (1.5 and 2.5 mg/m3). These 
concentrations were selected, as they could be generated using the available particle-
suspension generation equipment in a consistent, repeatable manner. They would both be 
representative of exposures to high concentrations of volcanic ash, generated during the actual 
ashfall, resuspension from human activity (e.g., vehicles, occupational hazards, or clean-up 
activities), and/or wind (Moore et al., 2002; Searl et al., 2002). The particle concentration within

the exposure chamber (challenge concentration, CChal) was monitored using a factory-calibrated 
(using Arizona Road Dust, which is similar to volcanic ash in its composition and, therefore, light 
scattering properties) TSI SidePak (SP) AM510 aerosol monitor (TSI, Minnesota, USA) fitted with 
a PM2.5 impactor. This was set to run at 1.7 l/min, according to the manufacturer’s guidance, 
logging the average concentration every 10 seconds. SPs with the same setup were attached to 
the sample holders measuring the concentration downstream of the RP material to sample and 
log the penetration concentration (CPen). Although volcanic ash does not usually contain a high 
fraction of PM2.5 (Horwell, 2007), we chose this fraction because this is the size range of most 
health concern (World Health Organization, 2013) and therefore the fraction that RP should 
preferentially filter. We assumed that any coarser particles will also not penetrate the material 
if PM2.5 is effectively filtered (Fisk et al., 2002). A pump was attached to the sample holders in 
order to reach the desired overall flow rate (MCS 10 Air sampling pump, SKC, Dorset, UK). The 
chamber was set up to allow simultaneous testing of two RP samples. Each test lasted 
approximately 12 minutes.

in the test chamber connected to SP2 and SP3 measuring CPen. SP1 measures CChal inside 
the chamber. The fan draws the air through the chamber. The baffle helps to distribute 
the aerosol as it enters the chamber.  
Side-by-side measurements using the SPs were conducted after each experiment to determine 
any variations in the SP instrument readings and allow correction factors to be applied to the 
collected data for each test run, as necessary, before calculation of the FEs. Briefly, this involved 
calibrating SP2/3 (measuring penetration) to SP1 (measuring the challenge concentration) by 
multiplying SP2/3 by the ratio of mean SP1 to mean SP2/3 concentrations from the side-by-side 
measurements (Equation 1).

Statistical Methods 
The FE of each RP type was based on the CChal within the experimental chamber and CPen using 
the following formula (Bowen, 2010) (Equation 2):

Forty-two measurements (0.001% overall) across eight RP materials had large negative1 (10-
second average) FEs, which were substituted with a value of -100% for analysis purposes. 
Normal data assumptions were not satisfied for the distribution of FEs for each RP type, nor 
after the log-transformation of values, as determined through Shapiro-Wilk tests (p < 0.001). 
Non-parametric (i.e., Kruskal-Wallis) tests were performed to test filtration differences across 
RP materials exposed to different dust types at two concentrations and flow rates, and also to 
assess the effectiveness of using a wetted versus dry RP material. The wetted materials were

All of the masks designed for occupational use (N95-, N99-equiv. respirators, surgical masks, more 
basic healthcare masks, and the hard-cup mask), plus the basic flat-fold mask (obtained in Indonesia 
but originally from Japan), were composed of non-woven, fused fabric (often polypropylene, 
according to the packaging).  
The cloth masks and items were all woven (mostly plaid weave except the T-shirt, which had a denser, 
herringbone weave) and made of common clothing fabrics, e.g., cotton, nylon, etc. The different RP 
types also varied in the number of layers, their thickness, and in the features which could be adapted 
to improve fit (e.g., nose clips, ear loops, extendable chin/cheek flaps) (Table 1).  
Table 2 and Figure 2 show the results of the FE experiments for the 17 materials (with different 
configurations) tested. Using two flow rates and concentration levels, three dust types, and three 
repeats for most RP types (with exception of the wetted materials, where only a flow rate of 40 l/min 
was used), a total of 719 unique tests were performed with 45,521 data points collected.

Figure 2: Mean filtration efficiency (%) of each RP for individual dusts, including both flow rates (40 
l/min and 80 l/min) and particle concentrations (1.5 and 2.5 mg/m3) (the wetted masks were only 
tested at 40 l/min). Vertical bars are standard errors. RP types to the left of the vertical line are multi-
layered and those to the right are single-layered, unless folded. * (J) = Japan; (I) = Indonesia; (M) = 
Mexico. 
The median FE of individual RP types, overall for volcanic ash data combined, ranged from 23.4% 
(Interquartile Range [IQR]: 10.2% to 33.3%) for the Veil (I) to 99.8% (IQR: 99.5% to 99.9%) for the N95-
equiv. Four of the 22 RP materials and configurations tested had both mean and median FE values 
above 90% (Table 2 and Figure 2): the N95-equiv., N99-equiv., PM2.5 surgical (J), and Basic flat-fold (I). 
These four RP types consistently achieved the highest FEs across the three different dust types (Figure 
2 and Supplementary Material Tables 1-3).  
A non-parametric comparison of the differences between the median FE overall for the two volcanic 
ashes and Aloxite (Sakurajima = 50.9%; Soufrière Hills = 61.9%; Aloxite = 72.0%) was significant (p < 
0.001). Significant differences between the two ashes were also found within most RPs (p < 0.001), 
except for the PM2.5 surgical (J) (p = 0.215) and the surgical (M) (p = 0.072), with FEs typically lower for 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 20 
 
the Sakurajima ash. Further, the median FE of each RP varied between the volcanic ash and Aloxite (p 
< 0.001), demonstrating higher values with the latter, except for the hard cup (M) (p = 0.073). The 
effect over time of FE for volcanic ash was small, but significant, adding an average absolute FE of 
0.06% every 10 seconds (p < 0.001). 
Within each dust type, the 10 RP materials with the best FE were consistently commercial mask 
materials (rather than cloth materials). Only two commercial mask materials (Basic non-pleated #2 
[M] and Basic non-pleated #3 [M]) did not achieve results within the highest 10 median FEs for any of 
the dusts used (see Supplementary Material Tables 1-3).  
For 19 of the 22 RP types tested with volcanic ash, the two particle concentrations (1.5 and 2.5 mg/m3) 
produced absolute differences of <5% in median FE values (with differences of <10% in the other three 
RP types). Most (19/22; 86%) of the FEs were higher at the greater concentration level, though 
differences in FE between the two concentrations were not significant (p > 0.05) for nine of the RP 
types3. A larger proportion (9/194; 47%) of RP types demonstrated differences of >5% in median FE 
values between the two flow rates, ranging from -26% to 12% at 80 l/min compared to 40 l/min. The 
majority (16/19; 84%) of RPs performed better at the lower flow rate, and nearly all RPs demonstrated 
differential FE (p < 0.001), except for the PM2.5 surgical (J) (p = 0.420) and the surgical (M) (p = 0.486). 
Significant differences in the distribution of FEs were identified for each of the three RP types (both 
volcanic ashes combined at a flow rate of 40 l/min) where a wet and dry version were tested. The 
median values for the dry version were significantly higher for the Surgical (M) and Bandana folded 
(x3) (p < 0.001), but lower for the Bandana folded (x2) (p < 0.001) (Table 2). Pooling together the wet 
and dry RP data, the latter group was found to have statistically increased median FEs (p < 0.001)

to 64.8%) overall across the volcanic ash types.  
One of the RP types (Bandana [I]) was challenged using one, two, and three-layers of material. There 
were statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases in the median FE offered by each additional layer 
against the volcanic ashes; the three-layer material achieved a median value of 40.3%, an additional 
median FE of 11.0% and 9.3% higher than that offered by one or two-layers, respectively (p < 0.001).  
The mean FE for the Bandana (I) (one-layer) was very low for the Sakurajima dust, relative to that from 
the other dust types, as shown in Figure 2.       
DISCUSSION 
This study evaluated the filtration performance of 17 materials (plus different configurations) used to 
provide RP during volcanic crises, sourced from communities affected by volcanic eruptions around 
the world. Two volcanic ash types and a surrogate dust (Aloxite) were used as the challenge particles 
in a small exposure chamber. Only four of the 17 materials provided mean and median FEs in excess 
of 90%, these being the two disposable, industry-certified masks (N95-equiv., N99-equiv.), the surgical 
mask from Japan designed to filter PM2.5 particles (PM2.5 surgical [J]), the basic mask distributed by the 
Red Cross (PMI Yogya) in Indonesia (Basic flat-fold [I]).  
The two materials providing the greatest median FE (in excess of 99%) were the disposable, industry-
certified N95-equiv. and N99-equiv. masks, designed for use in dusty, occupational settings. Such 
masks are rarely distributed in volcanic settings, although they have been in Iceland and Alaska, where 
they, rather than surgical masks, are stockpiled for pandemic outbreaks (Horwell et al., 2017; based 
on media images and personal communication with agencies by CJH). In most countries, however, 
their use is uncommon due to cost, as well as other logistical considerations (e.g., some styles take up 
much more space when stockpiling than surgical masks). In addition, despite these materials clearly 
being highly effective at filtering particles, the TIL, when worn, could be poorer than expected from 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 22 
 
the FE data, if worn incorrectly (as investigated in our accompanying study; Steinle et al., Submitted). 
In dusty industries, workers will be fit tested to ensure that masks fit to the shape of the individual’s 
face and are worn correctly. Workers cannot have facial hair and will be trained to ensure that, for 
example,  glasses do not impact the seal of the mask on the face (Bolsover, 1992). By contrast, in 
community settings, little-to-no training is provided, if such masks are distributed, so fit to face 
becomes very important. 
Our study has shown that standard surgical mask materials can be effective at filtering the PM2.5 
particles found in two types of ash and Aloxite, with median FEs of around 90%, despite the masks not 
being designed to prevent particle penetration. These results complement those of Shakya et al. 
(2017), where surgical masks achieved 78-94% FE when challenged with polystyrene latex standard 
particles. However, our results contrast with other studies: Bowen (2010) reported a FE of 33% for a 
surgical mask challenged with NaCl over 30 minutes, whilst Jung et al. (2014) reported a ‘medical’ 
mask to have a penetration of 45% (i.e., FE = 55%) when challenged with NaCl (a finer challenge 
aerosol). These FEs, which are lower than those achieved in the current study, may be explained by 
the variety of filter materials used in manufacturing different surgical masks and/or the use of a finer 
particle and different experimental set-up/study design. 
The high FE results for the surgical mask materials tested in this study do not allow us to draw 
conclusions on the overall protectiveness of the masks though, given that they are not designed to 
make a seal around the face and likely have a relatively large particle ingress around the edges. As 
shown in Steinle et al. (submitted), improving the fit of a surgical mask with an additional cloth layer 
improves overall protectiveness by decreasing face seal leakage. In Japan, surgical masks are 
commonly worn by the public, primarily out of politeness, to prevent the spread of communicable 
respiratory diseases, such as colds and flu, but also for other reasons related to a wider culture of ‘risk’ 
(Burgess and Horii, 2012) and to fashion. There are many different types of surgical-style masks 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 23 
 
available commercially, including those specifically sold to prevent inhalation of PM2.5. In this study, 
the PM2.5 surgical (J) mask performed extremely well (99.5% median FE).  
A mask which performed very well was a simple ‘Basic flat-fold’ mask distributed by the thousand in 
Indonesia by the Red Cross (PMI Yogya) (Horwell et al., 2017) and originally donated to them by the 
Red Cross Japan, where these masks are commonly available. However, that mask does not have any 
adaptations or features to enhance fit (no nose clip, elasticated straps, additional flaps, etc.) which, as 
shown in Steinle et al. (submitted), results in a relatively high TIL, likely attributable to particle ingress 
around the edges.  
In Mexico, a more basic, non-pleated, rectangular healthcare mask is commonly distributed by civil 
protection and aid agencies. We tested three of these (Basic non-pleated #1-3). The most basic type 
(#3) performed very poorly (36% median FE) with types #1 and #2 achieving 62% and 55% median FEs, 
respectively, which are both substantially less efficient than the standard surgical mask from Mexico 
(89% median FE).  
Many agencies around the world recommend use of cloth in lieu of a light-weight, disposable mask 
(see Global Ash Advice database at: IVHHN, 2017). The cloth materials are often a convenient way to 
protect from volcanic ash as they are very accessible. Scooter and fashion masks are also already worn 
by people trying to protect themselves from air pollution (Horwell et al., 2017). This study has shown 
that all types of cloth material (bandanas, T-shirts, veils, shawls, and handkerchiefs) performed poorly 
in the FE tests, with none achieving >44% median FE overall. This is concerning, since they are popular 
and convenient. The scooter and fashion masks, commonly used in Indonesia, performed considerably 
better (~75% median FE). Given these findings, agencies responsible for such advice should now 
consider the ethical question of whether ‘something is better than nothing’. Without additional 
information to clearly explain that such cloth materials will offer substantially reduced protection 
when worn (in comparison to well-fitted, industry-certified masks), agencies risk introducing a false 
sense of security. This may lead to individuals receiving higher exposures than had they chosen not to 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 24 
 
use any form of protection (which might have encouraged them to reduce exposure by seeking shelter 
indoors). If agencies decide that something is better than nothing, then modifications are worthwhile, 
as borne out by the data: increasing the number of layers of cloth (i.e., by folding a bandana) did 
significantly improve FE (but only up to 40% median FE). Therefore, future advice could suggest such 
adaptations, as long as the information also emphasised the need to securely fit the cloth to the face 
in a way which does not impede breathing.   
In addition, many agencies recommend that cloth, or masks, are wetted (e.g., see summary at: 
http://www.ivhhn.org/resources/global-ash-advice.html; IVHHN, 2017). The assumption is that 
wetted materials somehow improve FE. We have found no scientific evidence in the literature to 
support this assertion. In this study, the wetted double-layered bandana material performed better 
than the dry version; however, the wetted version performed less well than the triple-layered 
bandana. The wetted surgical mask performed worse than dry surgical masks. Here, again, agencies 
might consider whether to continue advising to wet RP given the lack of consistent evidence as to the 
efficacy of this intervention. In addition, wet masks will tend to dry over time, so any potential 
advantages of the intervention will be temporary, but this may not be apparent to the user, again 
giving a potentially false sense of security. It should be noted that, during the tests with wetted mask 
materials, it is possible that FE could have been slightly underestimated in relation to the dry 
materials. Light-scattering particulate monitors, such as the SP, may be affected by high humidity 
(>50% RH) as small hygroscopic particles will grow in size from water adsorption. However, the dusts 
used in this study were relatively large and had low hygroscopicity, and we consider this mechanism 
is unlikely to have resulted in a substantial overestimation of the particle concentrations (Titos et al., 
2014). 
 
In this study, we tested the FE of the RP materials only for a short period of time, with FE increasing 
very modestly during the test run. Incremental increases in filtration may be assumed as particles 
accumulate in the RP material, eventually possibly clogging the filter. It is, to our knowledge, unknown 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 25 
 
how well the RP materials would perform if they were used over prolonged durations during volcanic 
crises. Similarly, it is unclear what the impact might be of any attempts to clean the RP materials, 
although some limited work has been conducted on extending the life of N95 masks in healthcare 
settings through cleaning (NIOSH, 2014; Viscusi et al., 2009); this needs to be the subject of future 
research.  
 
Whilst there were small differences in FE between the two challenge concentrations, the higher flow 
rate resulted in lower FEs for most of the RPs. This finding suggests higher ash exposures for those 
who have a higher respiratory rate, including those who are physically active, e.g., ash clean-up 
workers. 
 
We currently have little understanding of why the efficiency of the different types of RP can be 
impacted by differences in dust source and PSD or the concentrations found in different particle 
exposures. This type of difference was particularly prevalent for the less-effective forms of protection. 
As shown in the data, the two volcanic ash samples and the Aloxite achieved similar (though 
statistically different) FEs for the four best RP types tested, despite containing different quantities of 
respirable (sub-4 µm) material. Cherrie et al. (Accepted) used the same experimental setup as in this 
study, but tested facemasks available in Beijing against diesel exhaust particulate, which is typically < 
1 µm diameter, with a substantial nanometre-sized fraction. For the N95-equiv. masks tested in that 
study (made by the same manufacturer with one mask being the same as that used here), FEs of 
around 99% were achieved, indicating that such masks are equally effective at filtering particles in a 
very wide range of size distributions.  
However, for the other poorer performing RP types, the FE varied widely with the challenge dust, with 
better performances generally observed against Aloxite. In this study, we used ash samples from two 
different volcanoes and found FEs to vary by ash type for most RPs, with generally higher FEs achieved 
for the Soufrière Hills ash, which contained more sub-2.5 µm material than the Sakurajima ash sample. 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

The electrostatic charge on the particle or some other property of the dust may be an important 
determinant of the observed differences. Further research needs to be conducted to understand the 
cause of these findings. For volcanic eruptions, every explosion will produce different quantities of 
respirable and sub-2.5 µm material. For example, Horwell (2007) showed that ash samples from the 
Soufrière Hills volcano generated between 6 and 12 vol.% sub-4 µm particles in the bulk ash, 
depending on whether the ash was generated in an explosion or dome collapse event. Hillman et al. 
(2012) showed that modern day Sakurajima ash contains between 1 and 10 vol.% sub-4 µm material 
in the bulk ash (and up to 18 vol.% in ancient ash erupted when the volcano was in a more explosive 
phase). The fact that there is a difference in performance of RPs dependent on ash type indicates that 
we must assume that some types of RP, and especially those which are not certified for occupational 
use in dusty industries, will perform worse than the values obtained in this study, during exposures in 
future eruptions. This provides a strong motivation for agencies to recommend the most efficient 
types of masks, as these displayed the smallest differences with different dusts.   
In Part II of our study (Steinle et al., Submitted), we select the best performing masks identified here 
(N95-equiv., PM2.5 surgical [J], Basic flat-fold [I], and Surgical [M]) for testing for TIL on human 
volunteers. Aloxite was tested in the current study because it had been chosen as a low-toxicity 
surrogate dust for the simulation study, due to its similar PSD to volcanic ash (although it is much 
coarser than the usual challenge aerosols used in FE experiments). For the best performing masks in 
this study, there was little difference between the performance of those RP against Aloxite and 
volcanic ash with the exception of Surgical (M). The potential over-estimation of efficiency for Surgical 
(M) is considered further, within the TIL study.   
CONCLUSIONS 
In the first study of its kind to use volcanic ash, we have determined the FE of a wide range of products 
used as RP around the world during volcanic events. This evidence base indicates that materials used 
in industry-certified masks, and others, specifically designed to filter PM2.5 particles, will provide better 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 27 
 
filtration efficiencies than fashion/scooter masks or ad hoc cloth materials (e.g., bandanas, scarves) 
used for protection when ash is in the air. Pleated, standard, surgical masks also had good filtration 
efficiencies, but other types of masks (non-pleated, single layer) for use in healthcare settings 
performed very poorly against volcanic ash. Cloth materials provided limited filtration, although this 
was slightly improved by layering the cloth. Wetting a bandana or a surgical mask did not consistently 
provide increased filtration, which does not lend support to such advice from agencies. Whilst it is 
encouraging to know that some materials will effectively filter volcanic ash from the air, this 
performance may be less important if the mask does not adequately seal to the face, thereby letting 
ingress of particles around the mask edges. The best performing masks in this study have, therefore, 
been tested for their TIL on human volunteers (which takes fit and facial seal into account), the results 
of which are described in Steinle et al. (Submitted), to give an overall assessment of protection.
