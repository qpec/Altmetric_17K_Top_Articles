Abstract
Background—Identifying current major dietary sources of sodium can enhance strategies to 
reduce excess sodium intake, which occurs among 90% of US school-aged children.
Objective—To describe major food sources, places obtained, and eating occasions contributing 
to sodium intake among US school-aged children.
Design—Cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey.
Participants/setting—A nationally representative sample of 2,142 US children aged 6 to 18 
years who completed a 24-hour dietary recall.
Main outcome measures—Population proportions of sodium intake from major food 
categories, places, and eating occasions.
Statistical analyses performed—Statistical analyses accounted for the complex survey 
design and sampling. Wald F tests and t tests were used to examine differences between 
subgroups.

 Results—Average daily sodium intake was highest among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years 
(3,565±120 mg), lowest among girls (2,919±74 mg). Little variation was seen in average intakes 
or the top five sodium contributors by sociodemographic characteristics or weight status. Ten food 
categories contributed to almost half (48%) of US school-aged children’s sodium intake, and 
included pizza, Mexican-mixed dishes, sandwiches, breads, cold cuts, soups, savory snacks, 
cheese, plain milk, and poultry. More than 80 food categories contributed to the other half of 
children’s sodium intake. Foods obtained from stores contributed 58% of sodium intake, fast-food/
pizza restaurants contributed 16%, and school cafeterias contributed 10%. Thirty-nine percent of 
sodium intake was consumed at dinner, 31% at lunch, 16% from snacks, and 14% at breakfast.
Conclusions—With the exception of plain milk, which naturally contains sodium, the top 10 
food categories contributing to US schoolchildren’s sodium intake during 2011–2012 comprised 
foods in which sodium is added during processing or preparation. Sodium is consumed throughout 
the day from multiple foods and locations, highlighting the importance of sodium reduction across 
the US food supply.

About 90% of US children aged 6 to 18 years consume excess dietary sodium1 and one in 
nine children ages 8 to 17 years have blood pressure above the normal range for their age, 
sex, and height,2 which increases their risk of high blood pressure as adults.3,4 Reducing 
sodium intake can reduce blood pressure in children and adults.5,6 It is especially important 
to reduce sodium intake among children because taste preferences formed in childhood can 
influence food preferences as adults.7 The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
recommend Americans consume <2,300 mg sodium per day and suggest that specific 
subgroups further limit sodium intake.8 The Institute of Medicine’s Tolerable Upper Intake 
Level for sodium is 1,900 mg/day for children aged 4 to 8 years, 2,200 mg/day for children 
aged 9 to 13 years, and 2,300 mg/day for those aged 14 years and older.9 A variety of 
governmental and nongovernmental organizations encourage Americans to select nutrient-
dense foods and to limit intakes of solid fats, added sugars, and sodium.8,10–12 Sodium 
reduction strategies such as industry efforts to reduce sodium in food products, as well as 
strategies implemented during the 2014–2015 school year as part of the Healthy Hunger 
Free Kids Act13 to gradually reduce sodium in school foods, complement a total diet 
approach for adherence to the Dietary Guidelines.8 Current data help establish a baseline for 
monitoring the influence of sodium reduction strategies.
Previously, data were unavailable for Asian Americans, a growing segment of the US 
population.14 Sources of sodium intake may differ between Asian Americans and other race/ 
ethnic groups. In the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), non-Hispanic Asian participants were oversampled to allow separate estimates 
for this group.15 As in previous years,1 identifying major food categories, places obtained, 
and eating occasions (meals or snacks) contributing to sodium intake can help develop more 
effective strategies for sodium reduction and provide the most current data about specific 
race/ethnic groups, now including Asian-American children. Most of the sodium Americans

 eat is not naturally inherent in the food, or added by the consumer at the table, but from 
sodium added during commercial processing or preparation.16
Determining the food types, places, and times contributing most to sodium intake can help 
determine whether a targeted approach would be effective. In addition, examining the 
amount of sodium consumed per calorie (sodium density) can help researchers and policy 
makers understand whether differences in sodium intake between population race/ethnic 
groups, or other subgroups, or across places or eating occasions are due to differences in 
consumption of energy, a sodium-dense diet, or both.
The current analyses are also important given several recent changes made to the US 
Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) in 
2011–2012, which is used to code dietary intake data in this analysis,17 and improvements to 
the categorization of foods. The addition of new codes for commercial and restaurant foods, 
enhanced and fortified foods, and changes in coding and categorization to reflect the current 
marketplace allow for an up-to-date representation of top food sources contributing to 
sodium intake. This analysis describes sodium intake, sodium density (milligrams of sodium 
per 1,000 kcal), and the food categories, places obtained, and eating occasions contributing 
to sodium intake among US children aged 6 to 18 years during 2011–2012, before the 
implementation of the sodium targets for school foods authorized under the Healthy Hunger 
Free Kids Act.13
METHODS
For these analyses we used data from the 2011–2012 NHANES, a nationally representative, 
ongoing survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. The National Center for Health 
Statistics Research Ethics Review Board reviewed and approved all NHANES protocol and 
content, and written consent was obtained from all participants. Parental consent was 
obtained for all children younger than age 18 years, and child assent was also obtained for 
children aged 7 to 17 years. To select participants, a complex, multistage probability 
sampling design was used with oversampling of selected populations, including, for the first 
time in 2011–2012, non-Hispanic Asians.15 Of the 2,336 children aged 6 to 18 years 
selected for participation, 2,142 completed an initial, in-person, 24-hour dietary recall as 
part of What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake portion of NHANES.18
During the 24-hour dietary recall, information collected includes food descriptions, 
additions, amounts consumed, and any foods or beverages eaten in combination, for all 
foods and beverages consumed during the previous 24-hour period. Information is self-
reported by the participant (aged 12 to 18 years) or the participant assisted by a proxy (aged 
6 to 11 years), the person responsible for preparing the participant’s meals. Each food is 
assigned a food code from the FNDDS and the corresponding nutrient intake for each food 
and beverage is estimated from the reported amount consumed. Each FNDDS food code is 
placed in one of 152 independent WWEIA food categories by grouping similar foods and 
beverages together on the basis of use and nutrient content.19 Thirty-two food categories that 
were similar were consolidated into fewer groups (eg, whole, low-fat, reduced-fat, and

 nonfat plain milk combined into one category for plain milk), resulting in 131 categories for 
the present analysis (available in the Figure [available online at www.andjrnl.org]).
The top 10 food categories that contribute the most to population sodium consumption were 
identified and ranked based on their percent contribution to the total sodium intake among 
US children aged 6 to 18 years (calculated as the sum of the sodium from foods consumed 
from a category, divided by the sum of sodium consumed from all foods from all children 
aged 6 to 18 years, and multiplied by 100), excluding salt added at the table.20 In addition, 
the top 10 food categories contributing the most to sodium intake among US children aged 6 
to 18 years were examined by age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and weight 
status, and the population proportion of total sodium intake was examined by place obtained 
(ie, store, fast-food/pizza restaurant, restaurant with a waiter/waitress, school cafeteria, and 
other) and by eating occasion (ie, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack) overall and by age 
group. The code for “store” included, but was not limited to grocery stores, supermarkets, 
warehouse stores, farmers markets, and convenience-type stores. Restaurants were 
distinguished by service from a waiter or waitress (eg, coffee shops or food courts without a 
waiter/waitress are considered fast-food restaurants).
Additional calculations determined the population proportion of sodium consumed at lunch 
from each place obtained (proportion of sodium obtained from each source at lunch, divided 
by proportion from all sources at lunch, multiplied by 100).20 Average sodium intake 
(milligrams per day) and average sodium density were examined overall and by 
sociodemographic characteristics and weight status, by eating occasion, and by place 
obtained. Estimates of average sodium intake excluded sodium from salt added at the table 
due to the difficulty in quantifying the amount of salt added at the table. Average sodium 
density was defined as milligrams of sodium per 1,000 kcal consumed. Wald F tests were 
used to examine overall differences between subgroups. Univariate t tests were used to 
examine differences between all subgroups; for example, children aged 6 to 10 years were 
compared with children aged 11 to 13 years, and 14 to 18 years, and children aged 11 to 13 
years were compared with children aged 14 to 18 years. The Bonferroni correction was 
applied to adjust for multiple comparisons and only significant differences are reported in 
the results (P<0.05). Analyses were conducted using sample weights for the initial, in-person 
24-hour dietary recall and SUDAAN version 11 statistical software21 was used to account 
for the complex survey design.
RESULTS
Mean daily sodium intake for children aged 6 to 18 years was 3,256 mg, excluding salt 
added at the table, and 89% of children had daily sodium intakes >2,300 mg on the day of 
assessment. No differences in mean sodium intake were observed by race or ethnic group 
(including non-Hispanic Asians), household income, or child weight status (Table 1). 
Average sodium intake was highest among high school–aged children (aged 14 to 18 years) 
and significantly higher than intakes among elementary school–aged children (aged 6 to 10 
years) (P<0.001). Girls had significantly lower daily sodium intake than boys (Table 1). 
Mean sodium density was 1,607 mg sodium/1,000 kcal overall and differed by age group 
(P=0.005) and obesity status (P=0.04), but not by sex, race/ ethnicity, or household income

 (Table 1). Middle school– aged children consumed, on average, significantly more sodium 
per calorie (ie, a more sodium-dense diet), compared with elementary school–aged children 
(P=0.03). Although high school–aged children also appeared to have a more sodium-dense 
diet than elementary school–aged children, the difference was not statistically significant 
(P=0.12), adjusting for multiple testing. Average energy consumption differed by age, sex, 
and race/ethnicity, and was significantly higher among children aged 14 to 18 years vs 11 to 
13 years, boys vs girls, and Hispanics vs non-Hispanic Asians (P<0.05).
The top 10 food categories contributing to sodium intake among US children and 
adolescents were pizza; Mexican mixed dishes (eg, burritos and tacos); single code 
sandwiches (eg, fast-food/restaurant burgers, chicken, egg, and frankfurter sandwiches); 
yeast bread, rolls, and buns; cold cuts and cured meats; soups; savory snacks (eg, potato 
chips and popcorn); cheese; plain milk; and chicken, whole pieces, turkey, duck, or other 
poultry (Table 2). These 10 food categories contributed 48% of the sodium consumed by US 
children aged 6 to 18 years, and the top five food categories contributing to sodium intake 
were among the top 10 food category contributors in each sociodemographic and weight 
status group examined (Table 2 and Table 3 [available online at www.adjrnl.org]). The 
remaining 52% of sodium intake came from 82 of the other 121 food categories.
Despite similarities in contributions of the top food categories, the ranking for contribution 
to sodium intake differed for some food categories across population subgroups. For 
example, among middle school–aged children and non-Hispanic Asian children, soups were 
the second highest contributor, but fifth or higher in all other age and race or ethnic groups. 
Among non-Hispanic Asian children, rice (ie, white, brown, yellow, or wild rice with added 
salt and with or without fat added during cooking) was the third contributor, but it did not 
fall among the top 10 contributors for any other population subgroup examined (Table 2).
Across the year, including weekends, weekdays, and holidays, 58% of sodium intake was 
from foods from stores, 16% from foods obtained from fast-food/pizza restaurants, 7% from 
restaurants with a waiter/waitress, 10% from the school cafeteria, and 10% from other 
sources, such as gifts or food from vending machines (Table 4). Among all ages, the highest 
proportion of sodium intake came from foods obtained at the store. Among high school and 
middle school–aged children, this was followed by foods obtained from fast-food/pizza 
restaurants, and among elementary school–aged children, by school cafeteria foods. High 
school–aged children had the lowest proportion of sodium intake from school cafeterias. 
Among high school–aged children, sodium intake per calorie was highest among foods 
obtained from sit-down restaurants, followed by foods obtained from the school cafeteria 
(Table 4).
By eating occasion, 39% of sodium intake occurred at dinner, 31% at lunch, 16% from 
snacks, and 14% at breakfast for US children aged 6 to 18 years (Table 5 [available online at 
www.andjrnl.org]). On average, across the year, weekends, weekdays, and holidays, 45% of 
the sodium consumed at lunch came from foods obtained at the store, 26% from school 
cafeteria foods, and 14% from fast-food/pizza restaurants. Among US children aged 6 to 10 
years, 33% of sodium consumed at lunch came from school cafeteria foods and 7% from 
fast-food/pizza restaurants. In contrast, among children aged 14 to 18 years, 19% of sodium

 consumed at lunch came from school cafeteria foods and 19% from fast-food/pizza 
restaurant foods (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Average daily sodium intake among US school-aged children during 2011–2012 exceeded 
recommendations, regardless of demographic or body mass index subgroup, and was 
primarily related to consumption of a sodium-dense diet. On average school-aged children 
consumed 1.6 to 1.7 mg/kcal, much higher than the 1.0 mg/kcal proposed from food 
patterning analyses to achieve recommendations.22 Average sodium intake among US high 
school–aged children was about 400 to 500 mg higher than younger school-aged children 
and comparable to US adults (about 3,600 mg).23 Nearly half of sodium consumed was 
contributed by 10 types of foods, with the top contributors being pizza, followed by Mexican 
mixed dishes, but with variation in the ranking of the top 10 food contributors by race or 
ethnic group. Contributions from food sources to total sodium intake changed from 2009–
2010, with less food obtained from stores (58% during 2011–2012 vs 65% during 2009–
2010; t test P=0.002) and more from fast-food/pizza restaurants (20.3% during 2011–2012 
vs 15.5% during 2009–2010; t test P=0.086) or restaurants with wait staff (9.2% during 
2011–2012 vs 5.2% during 2009–2010; t test P=0.012).1 The increased consumption of 
restaurant foods may also explain the more sodium-dense diets consumed by older children 
as the intake of different types of foods and the amounts of sodium in the same type of food 
may vary by location.24 Because food preferences are shaped by early food experiences, 
sodium reduction strategies in young populations may have important implications for future 
sodium intake.7
For the first time, separate estimates were included for non-Hispanic Asian children.15 They 
consumed, on average, the most sodium per calorie of any race/ethnic group examined; 
however, they also consumed fewer calories on average and their overall sodium intake did 
not differ. A potential explanation for this difference is the higher consumption of lower 
calorie, sodium-dense foods like soup, which was the second highest contributor to sodium 
intake among this group, compared with the fifth or lower contributor among other race/
ethnic groups. Our data support a previous study, which suggests that there are no 
differences in sodium intake between Korean Americans and non-Hispanic whites or non-
Hispanic blacks.25 However, other studies indicate children in some Asian subgroups may 
consume more sodium, on average, than non-Hispanic whites and that the diets of Asian 
Americans may be composed of both traditional Asian foods and components of a Western 
diet.26,27 Recent data also suggest Asian subgroups may differ in their hypertension 
risks.28,29 South Asians in the United States are reported to have higher rates of 
hypertension, and individuals of Japanese descent more frequently carry salt-sensitive genes 
associated with hypertension.29,30 As the fastest growing race/ethnic group in the United 
States,14 monitoring foods contributing to sodium intake in this group will help determine 
whether different or additional foods, beyond those consumed by the general population, 
need to be targeted for reformulation.
Differences from 2009–2010 in the top food categories and places contributing to sodium 
intake among US school-aged children1 could be explained by changes in consumption of

 foods or major changes in food codes and categorization. Household food-away-from-home 
expenditures have increased over the past 3 decades, whereas time spent in food preparation 
at home has decreased, which may explain some of the decline in sodium intake from foods 
obtained from stores.31,32 Children’s energy intake from fast-food restaurants specializing in 
burgers, pizza, or chicken has been decreasing in comparison to energy intake from Mexican 
cuisine, and sales data show that Mexican restaurants are among the fastest growing segment 
of fast-casual restaurants and growing substantially more than other fast-food competitors, 
potentially explaining the high contribution of these foods to sodium intake.33,34 However, 
the high contribution of Mexican mixed dishes to children’s sodium intake also could be 
related to a greater proportion of these foods captured with new food codes. Between 
FNDDS 2009–2010 and 2011–2012, more than 1,100 new food codes were added to 
different food categories, allowing for easier coding and analysis of their contribution to 
intake; for example, Mexican mixed dishes that were previously separated into components 
such as beans, rice, and cheese.
Several potential limitations exist in our analysis. First, dietary recall data may be subject to 
reporting error (where misreporting of intake may be particularly prevalent among children 
and adolescents).35 The gold standard for assessing total sodium intake is 24-hour urine 
sodium excretion, which is not available for children in NHANES, but also does not inform 
us about the contribution of specific foods or food groups to total sodium intake. Studies 
among adults comparing total sodium intake assessed from 24-hour sodium excretion and 
dietary recall methods used in NHANES have been mixed.36,37 Second, for some, but not all 
foods, a single food code in WWEIA was used to estimate the sodium content of a specific 
food across a variety of venues, which may not capture reformulation of sodium content in 
specific foods by setting. For example, pizza has separate codes and corresponding sodium 
values for “school” (467 mg sodium/ 100 g) and “fast-food restaurant” (742 mg/100 g), but 
most other foods are not coded separately for school, stores, or fast-food restaurants, and 
therefore, may not reflect reformulation of foods (eg, in schools). In addition, rice with salt 
added in cooking was used for coding all rice intakes, although not all consumers or venues 
necessarily add salt during cooking. In previous studies, rice has not been shown to be a 
major contributor to sodium intake in Asian diets.38,39 Third, NHANES does not specify 
whether or not children were attending school on the recall day, which presents a challenge 
for interpreting data about foods and beverages from school cafeterias. In previous cycles, it 
was possible to identify leading sources of sodium among a subset of children who were 
likely consumers of school meals, but because this question was no longer included and 
school terms and holidays vary, this was not possible with the current data.1 Fourth, 
estimates of total sodium intake exclude salt added at the table, which is estimated to 
account for about 6% of sodium intake among adults.16,40
The data in this report underscore the importance of national sodium reduction efforts, 
including targets for school meals13 and competitive foods (ie, foods and beverages sold 
outside of the school meal programs) that were implemented during school year 2014–
2015.41 In addition, sodium reduction efforts are underway in multiple sectors. The Kids 
Live-Well program requires participating restaurants to offer healthful meal items for 
children, including a focus on increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole 
grains, and decreasing consumption of added sugars and sodium.42 Several companies have

 been making gradual reductions in the sodium content of their foods43 and recently, the 
Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance with proposed voluntary sodium 
reduction targets for the food industry.44 The current analysis emphasizes the ubiquity of 
sodium in the US food supply, highlighting the influence the food industry can have on 
lowering the sodium density of US diets by participating in the sodium reduction initiatives 
proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and other bodies.
Despite some controversy regarding population sodium reduction efforts in the United 
States,45,46 groups such as the American Heart Association, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans reviewed the science and continue to support strategies to encourage a 
healthy diet, including lower sodium intake, among children and adolescents.8,10,47,48 
Reducing the sodium content of commonly consumed commercially processed, store, 
school, and restaurant foods could result in substantial reductions in excess sodium intake 
among US children now and into their adult years. Sodium reduction is an important 
strategy to reduce high blood pressure and help prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading 
cause of death in the United States.49
CONCLUSIONS
Average sodium intake among US school-aged children during 2011–2012 remained high, 
was related to consumption of sodium-dense foods, and was not attributable to one type of 
food, source of food, or eating occasion. The results support the need to reduce sodium 
content across the US food supply rather than in a single type of food or venue. These data 
provide baseline information on sources of sodium intake among US school-aged children 
before implementation of key national sodium reduction strategies. In NHANES and 
national school-based surveys, such as the School Nutrition Dietary Assessment50 and the 
forthcoming School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,51 up-to-date nutrient data based on 
current laboratory and/or label analysis will aid in understanding reformulations by location 
(eg, foods obtained from school cafeterias vs restaurants) and for accurate evaluation of the 
influence of national strategies for sodium reduction among US school-aged children. Along 
with up-to-date nutrient databases, examining the validity of 24-hour dietary recalls to assess 
sodium intake among children could improve monitoring and support sodium reduction 
efforts.

 PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS
What Is the Current Knowledge on this Topic?
Sodium intake in children and adolescents exceeds recommendations and comes from a 
variety of sources. What children eat at an early age can determine later dietary intake.
How Does this Research Add to Knowledge on this Topic?
This is the most current data on dietary sources of sodium among US children and 
adolescents and reports on new data for non-Hispanic Asian children. Sodium intake 
remains high and is related to consumption of sodium dense foods from multiple sources 
and occasions.
How Might this Knowledge Influence Current Dietetics Practice?
Knowledge of the major sources of sodium among children can help registered dietitian 
nutritionists counsel parents and caregivers about effective sodium reduction strategies, 
such as checking Nutrition Facts labels and choosing lower sodium foods.

aThe proportion (%) of sodium consumed is defined as the sum of the amount of sodium consumed from each specific food category for all participants divided by the sum of sodium consumed from all 
food categories for all participants multiplied by 100. All estimates use 24-hour dietary recall, take into account the complex sampling design, and use dietary Day 1 sample weights to account for 
nonresponse and weekend/weekday recalls.
bRank based on population proportions of sodium consumed for the overall US population aged 6 to 18 years. Columns for other groups are ordered by this ranking.

food categories for all participants multiplied by 100. All estimates use 24-hour dietary recall, take into account the complex sampling design, and use dietary Day 1 sample weights to account for 
nonresponse and weekend/weekday recalls.
bRank based on population proportions of sodium consumed for the overall US population aged 6 to 18 years. Columns for other groups are ordered by this ranking.
cAdditional information regarding food categorization is available at the What We Eat in America website (http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=23429). Food categories contributing ≥3% to 
overall sodium consumption within specific sociodemographic groups but not listed among the top-10 contributors were as follows: children with family income ≤130% of the poverty level, pasta mixed 
dishes, excludes macaroni and cheese (3.4%), all ready-to-eat cereal (3.1%); family income >130% to 185% of the poverty level, pasta mixed dishes, excludes macaroni and cheese (4.4%), chicken patties, 
nuggets, and tenders (3.1%); family income >185% of the poverty level, meat mixed dishes (3.5%), tomato-based condiments (3.2%); normal weight children, meat mixed dishes (3.3%); overweight/obese 
children, tomato-based condiments (3.0%).
dNormal was defined as body mass index for age and sex between the fifth and 85th percentiles. Overweight/obese was defined as a body mass index for age and sex ≥85th percentile, based on specific 
reference values from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts.
eBurritos and tacos/nachos/other Mexican mixed dishes.
fSandwiches as identified by a single What We Eat in America food code, burgers/frankfurter sandwiches/chicken or turkey sandwiches/egg/breakfast sandwiches/other sandwiches.
gExcludes bagels and English muffins.

bEating occasions were defined by the participant. Responses were categorized as follows: breakfast was defined as “breakfast,” “desayuno,” or “almuerzo”; lunch was defined as “brunch,” “lunch,” or 
“comida”; dinner was defined as “dinner,” “supper,” or “cena”; snack as “snack,” “drink,” “extended consumption (items that were consumed over a long period of time), “merienda,” “entre comidas,” 
“botana,” “bocadillo,” “tentempie,” or “bebida.”
cPlace obtained was analyzed from responses to the questions, “Where did you get this (most of the ingredients for this) [food name]?” Sources other than those shown were combined under “other” and 
included “from someone else/gift”, and 19 other sources, including “missing,” “do not know,” and “other/specify.”
dData are statistically unreliable, relative standard error ≥30%.
