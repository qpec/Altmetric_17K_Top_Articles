Purpose:
To investigate whether multivariate pattern recognition 
analysis of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion maps can 
be used for classification and single-subject prediction of 
patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and subjects with subjective cognitive 
decline (SCD) after using the W score method to remove 
confounding effects of sex and age.
Materials and 
Methods:
Pseudocontinuous 3.0-T ASL images were acquired in 100 
patients with probable AD; 60 patients with MCI, of whom 
12 remained stable, 12 were converted to a diagnosis of 
AD, and 36 had no follow-up; 100 subjects with SCD; 
and 26 healthy control subjects. The AD, MCI, and SCD 
groups were divided into a sex- and age-matched train-
ing set (n = 130) and an independent prediction set (n = 
130). Standardized perfusion scores adjusted for age and 
sex (W scores) were computed per voxel for each par-
ticipant. Training of a support vector machine classifier 
was performed with diagnostic status and perfusion maps. 
Discrimination maps were extracted and used for single-
subject classification in the prediction set. Prediction per-
formance was assessed with receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) analysis to generate an area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity distribution.
Results:
Single-subject diagnosis in the prediction set by using the 
discrimination maps yielded excellent performance for 
AD versus SCD (AUC, 0.96; P , .01), good performance 
for AD versus MCI (AUC, 0.89; P , .01), and poor perfor-
mance for MCI versus SCD (AUC, 0.63; P = .06). Appli-
cation of the AD versus SCD discrimination map for pre-
diction of MCI subgroups resulted in good performance 
for patients with MCI diagnosis converted to AD versus 
subjects with SCD (AUC, 0.84; P , .01) and fair perfor-
mance for patients with MCI diagnosis converted to AD 
versus those with stable MCI (AUC, 0.71; P . .05).
Conclusion:
With automated methods, age- and sex-adjusted ASL per-
fusion maps can be used to classify and predict diagnosis 
of AD, conversion of MCI to AD, stable MCI, and SCD 
with good to excellent accuracy and AUC values.

the ability to process large amounts of 
dependent voxel data that more accu-
rately resemble global brain functioning 
(21). Specifically, in the setting of SVM, 
the W score method is a statistical tool 
to reduce the effect of confounders in 
a binary test (22,23). Since automated 
image-based classifiers have not been 
used diagnostically in the setting of ASL, 
developing such a tool for single-subject 
classification is clinically relevant and in-
strumental for screening purposes.
In the current study, we investi-
gated whether multivariate pattern rec-
ognition analysis of ASL perfusion maps 
can be used for classification and single-
subject prediction in patients with AD 
and MCI and subjects with subjective 
cognitive decline (SCD) after using the 
W score method to remove confound-
ing effects of sex and age.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MR 
imaging is a noninvasive, rapid, and in-
creasingly widely available method for 
quantifying cerebral blood flow; ASL 
represents a potential alternative mo-
dality for measuring brain perfusion as 
compared with positron emission to-
mography (PET) (12–14) that may facil-
itate routine clinical application in the 
work-up of dementia. AD-associated 
perfusion changes measured with ASL 
are strongly correlated with glucose 
metabolism alterations as measured 
with PET (9,15,16). This constellation 
of findings suggests that ASL is a prom-
ising alternative functional biomarker 
for the early diagnosis of AD.
In addition to the perfusion-relat-
ed diagnostic parameters mentioned 
herein, the application of multivariate 
pattern recognition software to struc-
tural MR imaging data has yielded high 
diagnostic accuracy in AD (17). Com-
pared with visual assessment of hip-
pocampal volumes (18,19), automatic 
classification has resulted in high accu-
racy in the prediction of MCI conver-
sion to AD (20), which suggests that 
automatic classification includes more 
features of neurodegenerative patho-
logic processes (18).
Support vector machines (SVMs) 
represent binary machine learning mul-
tivariate methods that can be trained to 
classify individual images in a leave-one-
out cross-validation framework (17). 
Advantages of this multivariate method 
over a univariate method include in-
creased statistical power and single-
subject examination applicability, with

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Automated machine learning 
methods can be trained to distin-
guish between subjects with sub-
jective cognitive decline, patients 
with mild cognitive impairment, 
and patients with Alzheimer 
disease (AD) on the basis of ar-
terial spin labeling (ASL) images, 
with high classification training 
accuracy (range, 83.8%–89.0%; 
P , .01).
 
n Classifiers based on these train-
ings can be used to predict the 
diagnosis of single subjects with 
high diagnostic accuracy (area 
under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve range, 0.89–
0.96; P , .001).
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Automated classification of three-
dimensional pseudocontinuous 
ASL images used to detect 
patients with AD with high accu-
racy (.82%) may support image-
based diagnosis, especially in 
centers without experienced 
(neuro)radiologists.
 
n Automated classification of three-
dimensional pseudocontinuous 
ASL images may be used for AD 
screening purposes without com-
promising diagnostic accuracy.
A
lzheimer disease (AD) is the 
most common type of dementia 
(1) and the fifth leading cause of 
death in people aged 65 years and old-
er (2). Structural magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging provides high accuracy 
when diagnosing AD in patients versus 
control subjects, especially in advanced 
stages of the disease (3,4). However, 
the early diagnostic accuracy for iden-
tifying AD and the prognostic value for 
patients with an early AD diagnosis by 
using structural MR imaging remain 
problematic (5).
In the dynamic 2010 biomarker 
model from Jack et al, functional AD-
related brain changes occur before 
structural changes (6). Whole-brain hy-
poperfusion as measured with dedicated 
MR imaging has been demonstrated in 
patients with AD compared with con-
trol subjects (7,8), most prominently 
in the parietal lobe structures, such as 
the posterior cingulate cortex, precu-
neus, and inferior parietal lobule (7–9). 
Patients with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) show similar but less pronounced 
hypoperfusion patterns compared with 
patients with AD (10), with quantitative 
cerebral blood flow values intermediate 
between patients with AD and control 
subjects (11). Hypoperfusion has also 
been reported in the occipital and tem-
poral lobes in patients with MCI com-
pared with control subjects (11).

Collij et al
Participants within a diagnostic 
group were randomly assigned to either 
the training set or the prediction set 
(each set, n = 130; 50 patients with AD, 
30 patients with MCI, and 50 subjects 
with SCD), with balanced distribution of 
 
age and sex (Fig 1; Tables 1, 2).
Twenty-four of the 60 patients with 
MCI received a follow-up diagnosis 1–4 
years (mean 6 standard deviation, 1.96 
years 6 0.75) after the initial diagno-
sis: 12 had remained stable, and 12 had 
their diagnosis converted to AD. Be-
cause of the small number of patients, 
it was not possible to make separate 
training sets and prediction sets. Both 
MCI diagnosis was based on the crite-
ria defined by Petersen and colleagues 
(26); subsequent to 2012, MCI diagno-
sis was based on the National Institute 
on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association cri-
teria (25). Participants were consid-
ered subjects with SCD if they did not 
meet AD or MCI criteria. Healthy con-
trol subjects had normal clinical out-
comes and no complaints of cognitive 
decline (25). These criteria resulted 
in the inclusion of 100 patients with 
probable AD, 60 patients with MCI, 
100 subjects with SCD, and 26 healthy 
control subjects. Level of education 
was rated on a seven-point scale (27).

Participants
The local institutional review board 
approved this study. All subjects pro-
vided written informed consent. This 
study retrospectively included 311 par-
ticipants from the Alzheimer Center 
of the VU University Medical Center 
dementia cohort who underwent ASL 
MR imaging between October 2010 
and November 2012 (24). Exclusion 
criteria were space-occupying pro-
cesses (n = 7), posttraumatic devia-
tions (n = 6), large-vessel hemorrhages 
or infarcts (n = 4), indications for ep-
ilepsy (n = 4) or psychiatric disorders 
(n = 5), atypical clinical representation 
of AD (n = 3) (P.S., with 27 years of 
experience), or failed brain extraction 
or ASL acquisition (n = 22). Clinical 
diagnosis was established by means of 
consensus of a multidisciplinary team 
on the basis of a standard dementia 
screening that included medical his-
tory review, physical and neurological 
examinations, 
screening 
laboratory 
tests, neuropsychological testing, and 
brain MR imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid 
was obtained when possible. Patients 
with AD met the National Institute on 
Aging–Alzheimer’s Association criteria 
for probable AD (25). Prior to 2012,

Data Acquisition
Imaging data were collected with a 
3.0-T whole-body MR system (Signa 
HDxt; GE Medical Systems, Milwau-
kee, Wis) by using an eight-channel 
head coil. Structural imaging involved 
the use of a sagittal three-dimensional 
T1-weighted sequence (inversion-re-
covery fast spoiled gradient-echo; rep-
etition time [msec]/echo time [msec], 
7.8/3.0; inversion time, 450 msec; flip 
angle, 12°; and voxel size, 1 3 0.9 3 
0.9 mm). Pseudocontinuous ASL per-
fusion images (three-dimensional fast 
spin-echo acquisition with background 
suppression; labeling time, 1.5 seconds; 
postlabel delay, 2.0 seconds; repetition 
time, 4.8 seconds; echo time, 9 msec; 
spiral readout of eight arms 3 512 sam-
ples; 36 3 5.0-mm axial sections; 3.2 
3 3.2-mm in-plane resolution; recon-
structed pixel size of 1.7 3 1.7 mm; 
and acquisition time, 4 minutes) were 
computed by using a single-compart-
ment model (28) after subtraction of 
labeled images from control images. An 
approximately 
intermediate-weighted 
image was obtained to scale the perfu-
sion image for each participant by using 
a saturation-recovery acquisition with 
identical parameters.
Preprocessing of MR Imaging Data
T1-weighted and pseudocontinuous ASL 
images were corrected for gradient 
nonlinearities in three directions. Fur-
ther analyses were performed with 
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imag-
ing of the Brain Software Library, or 
FSL, software (University of Oxford, 
Oxford, United Kingdom) (29). Prepro-
cessing of T1-weighted images included 
removal of nonbrain tissue, normaliza-
tion to Montreal Neurological Institute 
(MNI) space, and tissue segmentation 
with partial volume estimation. ASL 
images were linearly registered to the 
gray matter density maps and mapped 
to MNI standard space, followed by 
Gaussian smoothing with 6-mm full-
width half-maximum and resampling 
at 3-mm isotropic resolution (A.M.W., 
with 15 years of experience).
W Score Maps
Because women show a higher cerebral 
blood flow than men (7) and it grad-
ually decreases with age (30), these 
confounders were removed prior to 
binary classification by using the W 
score method (22,23) with the script 
github.com/amwink/bias/blob/master/
scripts/bash/compute_w.sh. It computes 
voxelwise effects of each confounder 
on brain perfusion in a general linear 
model analysis of the reference ASL im-
ages (Fig 2a). The voxelwise intercept 
(b0), sex- and age-related regression 
coefficients (b1 and b2, respectively), 
and residuals (´) are used to compute 
a 
confounder-corrected, 
normalized 
statistic as follows: [(measured perfu-
sion) 2 (predicted perfusion)]/standard 
deviation of residuals. The measured

AD, patients with MCI, and subjects 
with SCD. We assessed the diagnos-
tic value of the classifier by compar-
ing the W score maps of both patient 
groups to those of the subjects with 
SCD. The classifier sensitivity to 
disease progression was assessed by 
differentiating between the W score 
maps of patients with AD and those 
with MCI. Finally, an exploratory 
classification training was performed 
with the use of the W score maps of 
patients with MCI diagnosis convert-
ed to AD and patients with stable MCI 
to investigate whether the classifier 
showed prognostic value.
for neurological images. A linear SVM 
produces a multidimensional hyper-
plane that optimally separates data 
in labeled groups (supervised learn-
ing). For two-dimensional vectors, 
this would be a straight line (31), 
but in our case, the hyperplane has 
the dimensionality of the number 
of included voxels. Discrimination 
maps, representing the normal vec-
tor to this hyperplane (21), store the 
relative weight of each voxel to the 
classification.
The SVM was trained in a leave-
one-out cross-validation framework 
to discriminate between patients with 
perfusion is the preprocessed ASL in-
tensity, and the predicted perfusion is 
the sum of voxelwise effects weighted by 
the individual’s age and sex parameters, 
respectively (Fig 2b). Like Z scores, neg-
ative W scores indicate lower perfusion, 
and positive scores indicate higher per-
fusion than expected from the reference, 
given the individual’s age and sex.
SVM: Multivariate Pattern Recognition in 
the Training Set

aging toolbox (21), implemented in 
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, Mass), 
provides multivariate pattern analyses

measures between groups were as-
sessed by using one-way analysis of var-
iance, with post hoc Bonferroni correc-
tion for multiple comparisons. A x2 test 
was conducted to assess the frequency 
distributions of the sex of the partici-
pants (L.E.C.).
Results
Participant Characteristics
No significant sex (P = .74) or age (P = 
.68) differences were observed between 
the six training and prediction sets. 
Within diagnostic groups, no signifi-
cant differences in MMSE score were 
observed between the training and pre-
diction sets (P . .99, Tables 1, 2).
No significant patient sex (P . .99) 
or age (P = .96) differences were found 
between the MCI subgroups and the 12 
matched subjects with SCD. Subjects 
with SCD had a higher MMSE score 
than patients in both MCI subgroups 
(P , .01), while the MCI subgroups 
did not differ in MMSE score (P = .47, 
Table 3).
Training of the Classifiers
An overview of training results is shown 
in Table 4. For AD versus SCD, train-
ing accuracy by using the whole-brain 
classifier (32). Discrimination maps 
were used to predict the labels for 
the prediction set perfusion maps. 
Discrimination maps display the dis-
criminative power of voxels in the pre-
defined ROIs but should not be inter-
preted as statistical tests. Instead, they 
provide a spatial representation of the 
decision boundary normal vector— 
that is, the weight of each voxel in 
discriminating between groups. Pos-
itive values (red and yellow) indicate 
voxels with a predictive value for the 
more severe condition, and negative 
values (dark blue and light blue) indi-
cate voxels with a predictive value for 
the less severe condition. Single-sub-
ject perfusion maps were multiplied 
by the discrimination map, adjusted 
by the training bias. The individual 
integral product scores were used to 
define the class, which could be pre-
dicted with a simple threshold by using 
 
ROC analysis (L.E.C., F.H., and 
A.M.W.).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses of the prediction 
outcomes were performed in SPSS 
(version 20; SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Spec-
ificity, sensitivity, and AUC of the pre-
dictions were computed by means of 
ROC analysis. Differences in continuous 
Classification accuracy reflects the 
predictive power of the algorithm and 
is therefore of direct diagnostic rele-
vance. Thus, classifier performance 
was assessed by computing the accu-
racy, sensitivity, specificity, and re-
ceiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve, from which the area under the 
ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. Per-
mutation testing was used to derive a 
P value of the accuracy (100 permuta-
tions) (21).
Training accuracies were first com-
puted on the basis of the whole brain. 
Subsequently, masks of Alzheimer-
specific regions of interest (ROIs) 
were used to maximize training accu-
racies. ROIs were based on the litera-
ture (1,7,8,10,11,16) and thresholded 
group mean perfusion maps. They 
included the parietal lobe, hippocam-
pus, occipital lobe, and combinations 
thereof. Masks were created by us-
ing the MNI structural and Harvard-
Oxford subcortical structural atlases 
(29) (L.E.C., F.H., and A.M.W., with 
1, 1, and 15 years of experience, 
respectively).

Predictions: Assessment of 
Generalizability
Results are summarized in Table 5. 
 
The use of discrimination weights in 
patients with AD versus subjects with 
SCD enabled correct prediction in 
90.0% of individuals (94.0% sensitivity 
and 86.0% specificity). The ROC curve 
demonstrated excellent performance 
(AUC, 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 
0.92, 1; P , .001). The use of discrim-
ination weights in patients with AD 
versus patients with MCI enabled cor-
rect prediction in 82.0% of individuals 
(84.0% sensitivity and 80.0% specific-
ity). The ROC curve demonstrated good 
performance (AUC, 0.89; 95% confi-
dence interval: 0.81, 0.97; P , .001). 
The use of discrimination weights in 
patients with MCI versus subjects with 
SCD enabled correct prediction in only 
60.0% of individuals (60.0% sensitivity 
and 60.0% specificity). The ROC curve 
demonstrated poor performance (AUC, 
0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 
0.76; P = .06; Fig 4).
Exploratory Analyses: Classifying MCI 
Subgroups
For patients with MCI diagnosis converted 
to AD versus subjects with SCD, whole-
brain training produced an accuracy of 
83.8% (66.7% sensitivity and 100% spec-
ificity), with an AUC of 0.90 (P = .01). A 
further improvement to 87.5% (75.0% 
sensitivity; 100% specificity; AUC, 0.92; 
P = .01) was obtained when training 
was restricted to the posterior cingulate 
cortex and hippocampus ROI. For those 
with MCI diagnosis converted to AD ver-
sus those with stable MCI, whole-brain 
training produced an accuracy of 70.8% 
the parietal and occipital lobe ROI im-
proved the accuracy to 83.8% (83.3% 
sensitivity; 84.0% specificity; AUC, 
0.88; P = .01). Finally, MCI versus SCD 
whole-brain analysis produced an accu-
racy of 57.5% (40.0% sensitivity and 
68.0% specificity) with an AUC of 0.49 
(P = .42), which was not improved in 
ROI-based analysis. The resulting dis-
crimination maps from the trainings 
with the highest accuracies are shown 
in Figure 3.
ASL W score map was 87.0% (84.0% 
sensitivity and 90.0% specificity), with 
an AUC of 0.94 (P = .01). A further 
improvement to 89.0% (84.0% sensi-
tivity; 94.0% specificity; AUC, 0.93; P 
= .01) was obtained when training was 
restricted to the parietal lobe and hip-
pocampus ROI. AD versus MCI whole-
brain analysis resulted in a training ac-
curacy of 78.8% (84.0% sensitivity and 
70.0% specificity), with an AUC of 0.84 
(P = .01). Restricting the analysis to

was 0.89, and accuracy was 82.0%. (c) For MCI versus SCD, AUC was 0.63, and accuracy was 60.0%.
Because of the small cohort, no 
matching data were available to create 
an independent prediction set based 
on MCI diagnosis converted to AD or 
stable MCI. However, use of the AD 
versus SCD training discrimination 
weights for those with MCI diagnosis 
converted to AD versus subjects with 
SCD resulted in correct prediction in 
79.0% of individuals (with 83.0% sensi-
tivity and 75.0% specificity). The ROC 
curve demonstrated good performance 
(AUC, 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 
0.68, 1; P , .01). The use of the same 
discrimination weights in MCI diagno-
sis converted to AD versus stable MCI 
resulted in correct prediction in 71.0% 
of individuals (with 67.0% sensitivity 
and 75.0% specificity). The ROC curve 
demonstrated fair performance (AUC, 
0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.49, 
0.93; P = .08; Table 5; Fig 6).
Discussion
In this current study, automated classi-
fication of perfusion maps enabled us to 
distinguish patients with various stages 
of AD with high accuracy. Additionally, 
the discrimination weights can be used 
for single-subject diagnostic prediction 
in an independent data set, with good to 
excellent accuracy and AUC values. Our 
training and prediction accuracies were 
similar when compared with traditional 
assessment strategies used by radiolo-
gists (18,19) and in previous studies in 
which pattern recognition software was 
applied to whole-brain structural MR 
imaging data (17,18,20,33). Moreover, 
the classifier presented in this article 
performed with good sensitivity and 
specificity. This suggests that perfusion 
differences are relevant to the diagno-
sis of AD.
In concordance with previous ASL 
studies (7–11,16), the highest accu-
racies for SVM training were observed 
by using AD-specific ROIs instead 
of whole-brain ROIs. For AD versus 
SCD, the combined parietal lobe and 
hippocampus ROI yielded the highest 
accuracy. However, we did not find in-
creased accuracies by using only the 
precuneus or posterior cingulate cor-
tex as an ROI, indicating that although

these areas show the most pronounced 
hypoperfusion (7–9,16), important in-
formation for optimal differentiation is 
lost when not taking the entire parietal 
lobe into account. A possible explana-
tion is the involvement of the default 
mode network, which has been shown 
to be less active in patients with AD 
and includes several parietal areas (4).
We achieved maximal training ac-
curacy for AD versus MCI when apply-
ing both the parietal and occipital lobe 
ROI. Although the use of the parietal 
lobe is in line with previous ASL results 
(10,11), application of the occipital lobe 
is contradictive, as occipital hypoperfu-
sion has been observed in patients with 
MCI compared with control subjects 
but not compared with patients with 
AD (11,13). The fact that most of our 
AD sample consisted of patients with 
early-onset AD, who present with a 
more pronounced overall and occip-
ital hypoperfusion and hypometabo-
lism compared with patients with late-
onset AD (34,35), could explain this 
discrepancy.
Automated classification of patients 
with MCI versus subjects with SCD did 
not yield high accuracy, which was un-
expected on the basis of previous work 
(8–10). The lack of homogeneity within 
the MCI group probably led to this 
low accuracy, as it prohibited the SVM 
from finding a pattern. Indeed, train-
ing with the MCI subgroups improved 
classification, with accuracies slightly 
higher compared with previous studies 
in which structural MR imaging was used 
(20,33). This observation demonstrates 
the issue of heterogeneity between pa-
tients for classifiers (33). However, this 
problem can be avoided by using large 
training data sets. Since training with 
the MCI subgroups consisted of small

samples (n = 12), replication of our re-
sults with a larger sample is necessary 
to support the prognostic value of the 
automated method for MCI converters.
With SVM classification training, 
a leave-one-out cross-validation frame-
work is used; thus, the same data are 
reused for learning and classification, 
which probably produces biased re-
sults. Unlike most preceding studies 
in this field, in our study, we used in-
dependent data sets for training and 
prediction to assess generalizability. 
In addition, our study extends previ-
ous results with structural MR imaging 
by using larger sample sizes, reducing 
problems of disease heterogeneity, and 
achieving increased classification ac-
curacy. However, the amount of data 
necessary for true clinical application of 
SVM in daily practice is notably higher 
(33). Thus, a large, multicenter study is 
of great clinical interest.
Our results are limited by the fact 
that a relatively high proportion of our 
AD sample consists of patients with 
early-onset AD. Further research in-
volving the use of samples with older 
 
subjects will allow us to study the ap-
plicability for patients with late-onset 
AD. Second, we used subjects with 
SCD instead of healthy control subjects 
for our classification. However, subjects 
with SCD are encountered in memory 
clinics and hospitals and are therefore a 
good representation of the operational 
environment with this method.
Our results support the way auto-
mated classification can facilitate and 
possibly improve diagnosis, specifically 
in centers without experienced (neuro)
radiologists. In addition, automated 
classification may be applicable for 
screening purposes, considering the 
high prevalence of AD (1).
In 
conclusion, 
with 
automated 
methods, age- and sex-adjusted ASL 
perfusion maps can be used to classify 
and predict diagnosis of AD, conversion 
of MCI diagnosis to AD, stable MCI, 
and SCD with good to excellent accu-
racy and AUC values.
