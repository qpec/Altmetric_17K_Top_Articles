frican Americans have the highest prevalence of hyper-
tension across any racial/ethnic group in the United 
States, with prevalence rates of 40.8% and 41.5% for African 
American men and women, respectively.1 Evidence shows that 
hypertension is associated with a disproportionate number of 
premature disabilities and deaths from myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and end-stage renal disease in African Americans than 
in other racial/ethnic groups in the United States and explains 
much of the racial disparity in mortality rates.2,3 Accordingly, 
there is a need to identify modifiable risk factors in African 
Americans amenable to behavioral intervention to mitigate 
their risk for the development of hypertension.
The protective effects of physical activity in the preven-
tion of hypertension have been demonstrated across many 
populations.4 As such, hypertension guidelines recommend 
the adoption of physical activity as a preventive lifestyle 
behavior.5,6 However, there is little published research on the 
association between physical activity and incident hyperten-
sion among African Americans. In a prior systematic review, 
only 3 studies were identified that examined the association 
between physical activity and incident hypertension among 
African Americans.7 In all 3 studies, no statistically significant 
associations were observed.8–10 These previous studies, how-
ever, were limited by the use of blood pressure (BP) thresholds 
for hypertension that differ from current guidelines, exclusion 
of young adults, and lack of consideration of the domain (eg, 
occupational versus leisure) or intensity (eg, all activity versus 
moderate–vigorous activity) of physical activity.

Abstract—There is limited empirical evidence to support the protective effects of physical activity in the prevention of 
hypertension among African Americans. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of physical activity 
with incident hypertension among African Americans. We studied 1311 participants without hypertension at baseline 
enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based study of African Americans residing in Jackson, Mississippi. 
Overall physical activity, moderate–vigorous physical activity, and domain-specific physical activity (work, active living, 
household, and sport/exercise) were assessed by self-report during the baseline examination (2000–2004). Incident 
hypertension, assessed at examination 2 (2005–2008) and examination 3 (2009–2013), was defined as the first visit 
with systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or self-reported antihypertensive medication use. Over a median 
follow-up of 8.0 years, there were 650 (49.6%) incident hypertension cases. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios 
(95% confidence interval) for incident hypertension comparing participants with intermediate and ideal versus poor levels 
of moderate–vigorous physical activity were 0.84 (0.67–1.05) and 0.76 (0.58–0.99), respectively (P trend=0.038). A 
graded, dose–response association was also present for sport/exercise-related physical activity (Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 versus 
Quartile 1: 0.92 [0.68–1.25], 0.87 [0.67–1.13], 0.75 [0.58–0.97], respectively; P trend=0.032). There were no statistically 
significant associations observed for overall physical activity, or work, active living, and household-related physical 
activities. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that regular moderate–vigorous physical activity or sport/
exercise-related physical activity may reduce the risk of developing hypertension in African Americans.  (Hypertension.

The purpose of this study was to examine the associa-
tion of physical activity with incident hypertension among 
participants enrolled in the JHS (Jackson Heart Study), an 
exclusively African American population-based cohort. As 
evidence suggests that the protective effects of physical activ-
ity against the development of hypertension exist only for 
physical activity accrued during leisure time and if levels are 
adequate to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (eg, moderate–
vigorous in intensity),10,11 (1) overall, (2) moderate–vigorous, 
and (3) domain-specific physical activity were all examined 
to characterize the physical activity-incident hypertension 
association.
Methods
Study Population
The JHS is a population-based study designed to evaluate risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease among African Americans. Details of 
the study design, recruitment, and data collection have been previ-
ously described.12–14 Briefly, 5301 African American adults aged 
≥21 years who resided in the Jackson, Mississippi, tricounty region 
were enrolled between 2000 and 2004. The baseline examination 
(visit 1) included an in-home interview and a clinical examination. 
Information on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, 
and medical history were collected during the in-home interview. The 
clinical examination included blood collection and anthropometric 
and BP measurements.
The current analysis was restricted to 2051 participants with sys-
tolic BP (SBP) <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) <90 mm Hg 
and who were not taking antihypertensive medication at baseline. 
Participants who did not attend examination 2 in 2005 to 2008 and 
examination 3 in 2009 to 2012 were excluded (n=275) as were par-
ticipants with missing information on BP or antihypertensive medica-
tion use at both visits (n=106). We further excluded participants with 
missing physical activity data (n=85) or who did not report work-re-
lated physical activity (eg, unemployed or retired; n=274) during the 
baseline visit. After these exclusions, the current analyses included 
1311 participants (Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement). 
The JHS was approved by institutional review boards of participating 
institutions. All participants provided informed consent.
Assessment of Physical Activity
Physical activity at the baseline examination was assessed using the 
JHS Physical Activity Survey, a 30-item questionnaire that assesses 
physical activity in 4 domains: active living habits, work, home life, 
and sport/exercise activities.15 Scores for each domain range from 0 
to 4, with lower scores representing lower physical activity. A total 
physical activity score is calculated by summing scores from the 4 
domains (ranges 0–16).
To quantify the number of minutes/week spent in moderate or vig-
orous physical activity (MVPA), the Sport/Exercise items that queried 
the frequency and duration of participation in the 3 most sport/exer-
cise activities performed in the past year were converted to minutes/
week as previously described.16 Consistent with the American Heart 
Association’s Life’s Simple 7 metric, participants were stratified as 
having poor (0 minutes of MVPA/week), intermediate (>0 and <150 
minutes of moderate physical activity/week and >0 and <75 minutes 
of vigorous physical activity/week), or ideal (≥150 minutes of moder-
ate physical activity/week or ≥75 minutes of vigorous physical activ-
ity/week) levels of MVPA.17 A detailed summary of methodology for 
deriving the physical activity variables are reported in Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
BP Measurement
At each visit, participants rested for 5 minutes in an upright posi-
tion with their back and arms supported, feet flat on the floor, and 
legs uncrossed prior to having their BP measured. Trained staff 
conducted 2 BP measurements in the right arm using a random-
zero sphygmomanometer (Hawksley and Sons Ltd, Lancing, UK) 
at visits 1 and 2 and a semiautomatic oscillometric device (Omron 
HEM-907XL; Omron Healthcare Inc, Lake Forest, IL) at visit 3. 
The random-zero BP measurements were calibrated to the semiau-
tomated device using robust regression (see Methods in the online-
only Data Supplement for details). One minute elapsed between 
measurements. An appropriate cuff size, determined from arm cir-
cumference measurement, was used. The 2 BP measurements were 
averaged for analysis.
Incident hypertension was defined as the first follow-up study visit 
(visits 2 or 3) with SBP ≥140 mm Hg, DBP ≥90 mm Hg, or self-re-
ported antihypertensive medication use.
Covariates
Sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, education, income, mari-
tal status, and employment status), cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index 
[BMI]), lifestyle behaviors (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, 
and diet), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and parental history 
of hypertension were included as covariates. A detailed summary of 
methodology for the measurement and calculation of these variables 
are reported in Methods in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analyses
Participants were stratified by level of MVPA (poor, intermediate, 
or ideal) and, separately, into quartiles according to the total physi-
cal activity index. Interval-censored Cox regression18 was used to 
calculate hazard ratios for incident hypertension associated with 
higher MVPA categories (intermediate and ideal) versus the lowest 
MVPA category (poor) and, separately, higher total physical activ-
ity index quartiles (quartiles 2, 3, and 4) versus the lowest quar-
tile (quartile 1). Models were adjusted for age and sex (model 1). 
Subsequent models included adjustment for having less than a high 
school education, annual family income <$50 000, being married, 
and fulltime employment (model 2), and further adjustment for 
heavy alcohol drinking, current smoking, healthy diet score, diabe-
tes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and parental history of hypertension 
(model 3). Models were additionally adjusted for SBP and DBP 
(model 4) and BMI (model 5). P trend tests were conducted by 
including the MVPA categories and total physical activity index 
quartiles as ordinal variables in regression models. The above anal-
yses were then repeated in a fully adjusted model (model 5) test-
ing for effect modification across age group (<60 and ≥60 years), 
sex (male and female), and BP level (normotension [SBP <120 and 
DBP <80 mm Hg] versus prehypertension [SBP 120–139 mm Hg or 
DBP 80–89 mm Hg]) by including multiplicative interaction terms 
in the regression model.
All of the above analyses were repeated examining each individual 
activity domain (active living, work, home life, and sport/exercise in-
dex) modeled as quartiles. In sensitivity analyses, we calculated the 
percentage of participants developing each component of incident 
hypertension, separately (SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg and, 
alternatively, antihypertensive medication use), and the hazard ratios 
for these outcomes. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Among the 1311 participants included in the current analysis, 
514 (39.2%), 487 (37.1%), and 310 (23.7%) participants had 
poor, intermediate, and ideal levels of MVPA, respectively. 
Participants with higher levels of MVPA, on average, were 
younger, were more likely to be male, were less likely to have 
diabetes mellitus, had less than a high school education, had an

annual family income <$50 000, were smokers, had a higher 
healthy diet score, and had lower BMI and SBP (Table 1). 
Participant characteristics stratified by total physical activity 
index score quartiles are shown in Table S1.
MVPA or Total Physical Activity Index and Incident 
Hypertension
The median time between visit 1 and visit 2 was 4.8 years 
and between visit 1 and visit 3 was 8.0 years. During follow-
up, there were 650 cases (49.6%) of incident hypertension, 
414 cases at examination 2, and 236 cases at examination 
3. A description of how incident hypertension cases were 
defined (BP level, antihypertensive medication use, or both) 
is described in Results in the online-only Data Supplement.
In models adjusted for age, sex, and sociodemographic 
factors, higher levels of MVPA and higher quartiles of the 
total physical activity index were associated with a lower risk 
for incident hypertension (models 1 and 2, Table 2). The asso-
ciation between MVPA and incident hypertension, but not the 
total physical activity index, remained statistically significant 
after further multivariable adjustment, including BMI (models 
3–5, Table 2). The associations between MVPA and the total 
physical activity index with incident hypertension did not vary 
by age, sex, or BP level (all interaction P values >0.05; data 
not shown). The pattern of results were similar when incident 
hypertension was defined by BP level only and, separately, 
initiation of antihypertensive medication only (Table S2), 
although the relatively smaller number of outcomes may have 
limited statistical power to detect statistical significance.
Individual Activity Domains and Incident 
Hypertension
In models adjusted for age and sex, higher quartiles of the 
active living and, separately, the sport/exercise index were 
associated with a lower risk for incident hypertension (model 
1, Table 3). The association between the sport/exercise index 
and incident hypertension, but not the active living index, 
remained statistically significant after further multivariable 
adjustment (models 2–5, Table 3). The association of the 
sport/exercise index with incident hypertension did not vary 
by age, sex, or BP level (all interaction P values >0.05; data 
not shown). Higher quartiles of the work index were associ-
ated with an increased risk for hypertension after adjustment 
for age, sex, and sociodemographics (models 1 and 2) but not 
after further multivariable adjustment. There were no associa-
tions between the home/life index and incident hypertension 
in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. The pattern of results was 
similar when incident hypertension was defined by BP level

Discussion
In this population-based sample of African Americans, higher 
levels of MVPA were associated with a lower risk of incident 
hypertension. Graded dose–response associations were also 
observed for the sport/exercise index, a measure of voluntary 
and purposeful participation in sport/exercise activities. In a 
fully adjusted model, there were no significant associations 
observed for the overall total physical activity index or the 
individual indexes for active living, home life, and work, with 
incident hypertension.
In the current study, ≈50% of JHS participants developed 
hypertension over a median follow-up of 8 years. A similar 
percentage of African Americans developed hypertension 
over 8 to 10 years in other population-based studies.19,20 These 
findings highlight the high burden of hypertension among 
African Americans and the need to identify modifiable risk 
factors to lower this risk. Aerobic exercise training reduces 
BP, with meta-analyses reporting reductions in SBP and DBP 
of 3.5 and 2.5 mm Hg, respectively, pooling all race/ethnici-
ties.21 Although protective effects of aerobic exercise–based 
physical activity in the prevention of hypertension have been 
well documented in white populations,8–10 scare data exist for 
African Americans.
Some hypertension treatment guidelines recommend 
different initial drug classes in African American and white 
populations.22 Whether race-specific guidelines for hyperten-
sion prevention are also warranted is unclear. Findings from 
the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey) and the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) and an initial report from the findings from the 
CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young 
Adults) showed no association of leisure or nonleisure physi-
cal activity with incident hypertension in subsample analyses 
of African American participants.8–10 More recent analyses of 
the CARDIA study reported that more leisure-time physical 
activity was associated with a lower risk of incident hyperten-
sion in African American men, but not in women.11 Current 
public health guidelines recommend MVPA 3 to 4 days/week 
for at least 40 minutes/session to reduce the risk of hyper-
tension.23 The results of the current study provide evidence, 
which reinforce these recommendations that regular physical 
activity, particularly sport- and exercise-related physical activ-
ity, is important for the prevention of hypertension among 
African American men and women.
The lack of an association between physical activity and 
incident hypertension reported in previous studies has been 
attributed to inaccuracies of the instruments used to assess 
physical activity, use of questionnaires not validated in 
African Americans, and the lack of range in physical activ-
ity levels.8–10 The JHS study used a physical activity question-
naire that (1) queries the frequency and duration of physical 
activity participation, (2) has been validated for use in African 
Americans, and (3) had good distribution across the analytic 
sample.15,24 These strengths overcome the limitations of prior 
studies to help address an important evidence gap regarding 
the role of physical activity in the prevention of hypertension 
among African Americans.

A meta-analysis by Huai et al25 examined the association 
between different domains of physical activity and incidence 
of hypertension and reported an inverse association between 
leisure-time physical activity, but not occupational physical 
activity, with incident hypertension among 136 846 persons 
of whom ≈5% were black. In the current study, higher lev-
els of MVPA and the sport/exercise index were associated 
with a lower risk of incident hypertension, whereas no asso-
ciation was observed for work, active living, or household-
related physical activities after adjustment for confounders. 
Generally, occupational or household activities are often not 
done in bouts long enough to elicit beneficial cardiorespira-
tory or metabolic adaptations (eg, ≥10 minutes) and typi-
cally consist of nondynamic movements that do not increase 
cardiac output or whole-body metabolism. Thus, the lack 
of an association between the work and home life indexes 
and incident hypertension in the current study may, in part, 
be attributed to the nature and intensity of occupational and 
household activities. Although active lifestyle activities (eg, 
walking or biking to work/school or for errands) are of the 
dynamic type and may occur in bouts long enough to elicit 
health benefit because the JHS Physical Activity Survey did

not assess the intensity of walking/biking during lifestyle 
activities, it is unclear whether the null findings for the active 
living index can be attributed to such activities being pre-
dominately light in intensity. Although the more common, 
everyday physical activities (occupational, household, and 
lifestyle) were not associated with incident hypertension, 
the health benefits of such activities have been previously 
demonstrated and they should not be ruled out as impor-
tant lifestyle behaviors.26–28 Future studies are still needed 
to determine the type and optimal dose of physical activ-
ity (frequency, duration, and intensity) to reduce the risk of 
hypertension in African Americans.
Our finding that the total physical activity index was not 
associated with incident hypertension highlights the impor-
tance of assessing specific domains of physical activity. The 
distinction between leisure and nonleisure physical activ-
ity may be particularly important among African Americans 
because previous studies have shown that African Americans 
engage in high amounts of occupational physical activity, 
but little leisure-time MVPA.29,30 Thus, composite scores or 
assessment of general physical activity levels without con-
sideration of occupational versus leisure-time domains may 
obscure associations in this population.
The mechanisms by which physical activity may prevent 
the development of hypertension are unclear. One mechanism 
by which physical activity is associated with a lower rate of 
developing hypertension is BMI reduction. We observed only 
minimal changes in the associations of MVPA and the sport/
exercise index with incident hypertension after adjustment for 
BMI, suggestive that BMI does not mediate these associa-
tions. Similar findings have been reported in predominantly 
white populations.31,32 Other suggested mechanisms include 
improved endothelial function, sodium handling, or baroreflex 
sensitivity, as well as decreased sympathetic or renin–angio-
tensin system activity.33
Several limitations should be noted when interpreting find-
ings from the current study. First, physical activity was assessed 
by self-report. Second, minutes of MVPA/week were only able 
to be derived from items of the sport/exercise domain. Thus, 
MVPA may be underestimated because it does not account for 
occupational, household, or lifestyle-related physical activity. 
Third, the JHS was conducted in a single metropolitan area 
in the Southeastern United States, possibly limiting its gener-
alizability to other African American populations. Finally, as 
in all observational studies, there may be residual confound-
ing from unmeasured factors. Notwithstanding these limita-
tions, the JHS is one of the largest population-based studies 
conducted among African Americans. This landmark study 
provided a unique opportunity to characterize physical activ-
ity levels in 4 separate domains and evaluate their association 
with incident hypertension to elucidate the type of physical 
activity that mitigates risk for the development of hyperten-
sion in African Americans.
Perspectives
In a population-based sample of African Americans, higher 
levels of MVPA and participation in higher levels of sport 
and exercise were associated with a lower risk of incident 
hypertension. In contrast, total physical activity, as well as 
occupational, household, and lifestyle physical activities, were 
not associated with incident hypertension after adjustment for 
potential confounders. The results of the current study pro-
vide evidence that increasing sport or exercise-related physi-
cal activity may reduce the incidence of hypertension among 
African Americans.

What Is New?
• This is one of the first studies to examine whether different domains 
(eg, occupational versus leisure) or intensity (eg, all activity versus 
 
moderate–vigorous activity) of physical activity are differentially associated 
with incident hypertension among African Americans.
What Is Relevant?
• In a population-based sample of African Americans, higher levels of 
moderate–vigorous and sport/exercise-related physical activity were 
associated with a lower risk of incident hypertension. There were no 
significant associations observed for overall physical activity, or work, 
active living, and household-related physical activities.
Summary
Regular physical activity, particularly sport or exercise-related 
physical activity, may reduce the incidence of hypertension among 
African Americans.
