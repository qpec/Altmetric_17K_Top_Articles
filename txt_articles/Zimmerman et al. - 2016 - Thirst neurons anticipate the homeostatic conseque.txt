Abstract
Thirst motivates animals to drink in order to maintain fluid balance. Traditionally, thirst has been 
viewed as a homeostatic response to changes in the blood volume or tonicity1–3. However, most 
drinking behavior is regulated too rapidly to be controlled by blood composition directly and 
instead appears to anticipate homeostatic imbalances before they arise4–11. How this is achieved 
remains unknown. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the subfornical organ (SFO) in the 
anticipatory regulation of thirst. We show by monitoring deep-brain calcium dynamics that thirst-
promoting SFO neurons respond to inputs from the oral cavity during eating and drinking, which 
they then integrate with information about the composition of the blood. This integration allows 
SFO neurons to predict how ongoing food and water consumption will alter fluid balance in the 
future and then adjust behavior preemptively. Complementary optogenetic manipulations show 
that this anticipatory modulation is necessary for drinking in multiple contexts. These findings 
provide a neural mechanism to explain longstanding behavioral observations, including the 
prevalence of drinking during meals10,11, the rapid satiation of thirst7–9, and the fact that oral 
cooling is thirst-quenching12–14.
Deviations of blood volume or osmolarity from their set points are detected by specialized 
neurons within the circumventricular organs (CVOs) of the brain1–3. Activation of these

 neurons generates thirst, which motivates animals to find and consume water and thereby 
restore fluid balance.
Nevertheless, many aspects of drinking behavior cannot be explained by this textbook 
homeostatic model15 because their regulation precedes rather than responds to changes in 
the blood4–11. For example, drinking quenches thirst tens of minutes before ingested water 
reaches the circulation and alters the composition of the blood, implying that thirst is sated 
before homeostasis is restored. Yet somehow animals calibrate their water consumption to 
precisely match their physiologic need7–9. Conversely, most drinking occurs during meals, 
as a result of prandial thirst that develops long before the ingested food has been absorbed 
and altered the blood tonicity10,11. These observations imply that much normal drinking 
behavior is anticipatory in nature, meaning that the brain predicts impending changes in 
fluid balance and adjusts behavior preemptively. How this is achieved remains unknown.
The CVOs are the brain regions most strongly associated with fluid balance1–3. fMRI studies 
failed to detect rapid modulation of these structures during drinking16,17, leading to the 
belief that the integratory circuits for thirst reside in higher brain centers3,18 and that the 
CVOs function only as passive sensors of blood composition1–3. However, this conclusion is 
complicated by the fact that the CVOs contain a diversity of intermingled neural cell 
types19,20, which cannot be discriminated by functional imaging. Importantly, current 
models for the thirst circuitry have never been tested by recording the dynamics of identified 
neurons in awake, behaving animals.
To investigate thirst circuits in vivo, we focused on the subfornical organ (SFO), a CVO that 
is strongly implicated in the control of drinking behavior21. Optogenetic activation of SFO 
excitatory neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase 1 (Nos1) promotes voracious drinking in 
water-sated mice19,22. We replicated this (Extended Data Fig. 1) and then targeted 
GCaMP6s to SFONos1 neurons for calcium imaging. We first confirmed in slice that 
GCaMP6s faithfully reported SFONos1 neuron activity induced by current injection or 
application of angiotensin (Extended Data Fig. 2). We then installed fiber optics above the 
SFO for recordings of population activity by fiber photometry23 in awake, behaving mice 
(Fig. 1a).
To define the regulation of SFONos1 neurons in vivo, we recorded GCaMP fluorescence 
responses to a series of systemic challenges24. Peripheral injection of angiotensin (Extended 
Data Fig. 3) or hypertonic saline (Fig. 1b) rapidly and dose-dependently activated SFONos1 
neurons. The response to hypertonic saline was mediated by an osmosensory (rather than 
sodium-sensory) mechanism, because injection of equiosmotic mannitol25 induced a similar 
response (Fig. 1d). Challenge with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which induces 
hypovolemia26, or isoproterenol, which induces hypotension24, resulted in slower and more 
sustained activation of SFONos1 neurons (Fig. 1e,g). The responses to PEG and isoproterenol 
were abolished by pretreatment with angiotensin blockers (Fig. 1f,h), whereas the response 
to osmotic challenge was unaffected (Fig. 1c). Thus SFONos1 neurons sense the osmolarity, 
volume, and pressure of the blood via a combination of angiotensin-dependent and -
independent mechanisms (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 3).

 Consistent with this homeostatic regulation, overnight water restriction strongly activated 
SFONos1 neurons (Fig. 2a). When water was made available, mice drank avidly and, 
surprisingly, SFONos1 neurons were inhibited within 1 min (Fig. 2b–d). This inhibition was 
time-locked to the act of drinking, with activity beginning to decline the moment of the first 
lick (Fig. 2g) and stabilizing whenever drinking was paused. Drinking continued until the 
precise moment at which SFONos1 neuron activity returned to baseline, at which point 
drinking terminated. These responses were much too fast to be mediated by changes in the 
blood, which we confirmed directly by measuring plasma volume and osmolarity along a 
time-course of rehydration (Fig. 2e,f). Thus, contrary to current models, thirst is not 
quenched by the reverse of the process that generates it1–3. Instead, drinking resets thirst-
promoting SFO neurons in a way that anticipates the future restoration of homeostasis. 
Importantly, this anticipatory feedback provides a mechanism to explain how animals can 
match ongoing water consumption to the level of physiologic need, a longstanding 
observation that has lacked a clear neural basis7–9.
To investigate whether this rapid inhibition of SFONos1 neurons is sufficient to explain thirst 
satiation, we used optogenetic silencing to replay this inhibition in thirsty animals. Of note, 
prior studies found that SFO ablation does not completely block drinking1, but interpretation 
of these lesion experiments is complicated by the fact that the SFO contains intermingled 
thirst-driving and -suppressing cell types19,20. We targeted the inhibitory opsin eArch3.0 to 
SFONos1 neurons (Fig. 2h) and confirmed that this can silence SFONos1 neurons in vitro 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). We then water restricted mice overnight and measured subsequent 
drinking behavior. Strikingly, silencing SFONos1 neurons abolished drinking in dehydrated 
animals (Fig. 2i–j and Extended Data Fig. 4). This effect was rapidly reversible, as mice 
engaged in voracious drinking soon after silencing was terminated (latency 113 ± 17 sec). It 
was also specific to drinking, as silencing did not inhibit food intake after fasting (Extended 
Data Fig. 7). Thus SFONos1 neurons are necessary for water consumption, and, importantly, 
their rapid inhibition during drinking is sufficient to explain thirst satiation.
We sought to clarify the mechanism of rapid feedback to SFONos1 neurons during drinking. 
SFONos1 neuron activity was unaffected by allowing mice to see but not consume water 
(Fig. 3e,f) or by presenting sensory cues that had been paired with water access via 
Pavlovian conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 5). Thus SFONos1 neurons are not inhibited by 
the expectation of water availability alone, in contrast to ARCAgRP neurons that control 
hunger22,27,28. Similarly, the act of licking per se was insufficient, since SFONos1 neuron 
activity was not reduced in mice that performed several hundred “air licks” following 
presentation of an empty water bottle (Fig. 3g,h). This indicates that a signal tightly linked to 
the act of water ingestion itself, such as the sensation of liquid in the oral cavity, inhibits 
SFONos1 neurons.
To investigate this further, we tested whether drinking would inhibit SFONos1 neurons if the 
ingested liquid could not restore homeostasis. Mice were salt challenged and then provided 
access to water or hypertonic saline. Water consumption rapidly inhibited SFONos1 neurons 
(Fig. 3a–c and Extended Data Fig. 5), and this inhibition preceded any change in plasma 
osmolarity (Fig. 3d). Strikingly, consumption of hypertonic saline also rapidly inhibited 
SFONos1 neurons, with kinetics initially indistinguishable from water consumption (Fig.

 3i,j). However, this initial decline was reversed after approximately one minute. This 
indicates that the rapid anticipatory response to drinking has at least two components: an 
immediate signal that tracks fluid ingestion and a delayed signal that reports on fluid 
tonicity, possibly generated by an esophageal or gastric osmosensor.
To further probe the oropharyngeal signals that regulate SFONos1 neurons, we investigated 
the role of water temperature. Humans experience cold drinks as more thirst-quenching14, 
and a similar preference is observed in rodents12,13. To test whether SFONos1 neurons 
contribute to this effect, we presented thirsty mice with access to water of different 
temperatures. We found that, regardless of temperature, mice consumed enough water to 
reduce the activity of their SFONos1 neurons to baseline (Fig. 3k). However, the reduction in 
SFONos1 neuron activity per lick was strongly temperature-dependent, with cold water 
inducing the largest decrease per lick and warm water the smallest (Fig. 3l). This suggests 
that the temperature dependence of thirst-quenching may be encoded in SFONos1 neuron 
activity. To test this directly, we measured the isolated effect of oral cooling on these 
neurons. We found that applying cold, but not room temperature, metal to the oral cavity of 
awake, thirsty mice was sufficient to rapidly inhibit SFONos1 neurons (Fig. 3m,n). Thus, 
temperature-dependent modulation of SFONos1 neurons may explain the enigmatic 
connection between oral cooling and thirst, including why thirsty rodents will avidly lick 
cold metal29 and humans report that sucking on ice chips rapidly relieves thirst14.
Eating is a potent stimulus for thirst, and many animals drink primarily during meals. 
However, the neural basis for prandial thirst is unknown, partly because feeding stimulates 
drinking before any change in the blood occurs10,11. To investigate the role of SFONos1 
neurons, we fasted mice overnight and then provided access to food but not water. 
Remarkably, food consumption rapidly activated SFONos1 neurons, beginning at the onset of 
feeding and plateauing within 15 minutes (Fig. 4a). When water was presented, mice drank 
avidly and SFONos1 neurons were quickly inhibited. A similar activity pattern was observed 
when hungry mice were given simultaneous access to food and water (Fig. 4c). Activation of 
SFONos1 neurons during eating was not caused by changes in blood composition, because 
activation was complete before plasma osmolarity increased (Fig. 4b) and was unaffected by 
angiotensin blockers (Extended Data Fig. 6). Importantly, silencing SFONos1 neurons during 
these same protocols greatly reduced meal-associated water consumption (Fig. 4d,e) but not 
food intake (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that SFONos1 neurons are specifically 
necessary for prandial drinking. Thus modulation of SFONos1 neurons during feeding 
provides a mechanism to explain the coordination of eating and drinking, a widespread 
phenomenon that has lacked a clear neural substrate.
To better understand the circuit mechanisms underlying the regulation of drinking by 
SFONos1 neurons, we investigated the inputs and outputs of these cells. Projection mapping 
revealed that SFONos1 neurons densely innervate several hypothalamic nuclei associated 
with fluid balance30 (Extended Data Fig. 8). Optogenetic stimulation of projections to the 
median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), but not the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), was 
sufficient to drive voracious drinking (Fig. 5a–c). Intriguingly, examination of the 
monosynaptic inputs to SFONos1 neurons by retrograde rabies tracing revealed a partially 
overlapping set of structures (Fig. 5d–f and Extended Data Fig. 8). Elucidation of the cell-

 type-specific connectivity between these structures will be an important area for future 
investigation.
Ingestive behavior is regulated by a combination of anticipatory and homeostatic cues4–6. 
Interoceptive neurons within the CVOs have been recognized for decades as critical sites for 
the homeostatic regulation of drinking1–3,21,24,26. By contrast, the neural substrates for the 
anticipatory regulation of drinking have remained obscure, despite abundant evidence that 
such mechanisms are critical for the control of behavior4–11. Here we have demonstrated 
that the anticipatory signals for thirst unexpectedly converge on the same homeostatic 
neurons that monitor the composition of the blood (Extended Data Fig. 9). This convergence 
provides a straightforward mechanism for the brain to compare the needs of the body with 
the anticipated effects of ongoing food and water consumption and then adjust behavior 
preemptively. This in turn explains longstanding behavioral observations, including the 
speed of thirst satiation (Fig. 2), the fact that oral cooling is thirst-quenching (Fig. 3), and 
the widespread coordination of eating and drinking (Fig. 4). These findings reveal that the 
CVOs, long viewed as merely passive sensors of the blood, receive a second class of 
anticipatory signals that enable their dynamic regulation of behaviour.

 Stereotaxic surgery
For SFO injections, 100–200 nL of virus was injected at one site (−0.50 mm anteroposterior 
(AP); 0 mm mediolateral (ML); −2.75 mm dorsoventral (DV) relative to bregma). For ARC 
injections, 1 µL of virus total was injected at two sites (−1.85 mm AP; −0.3 mm ML; −5.7 
and −5.8 mm DV). Mice were allowed 2–4 weeks for viral expression and recovery from 
surgery before behavioral testing.
For soma photostimulation experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing ChETATC, mCherry, 
or GFP were stereotaxically injected into the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice and wild type 
mice. In the same surgery, a fiberoptic cannula was implanted unilaterally above the SFO 
(−2.25 mm DV).
For terminal photostimulation experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing hChR2/H134R or 
GFP were injected into the SFO of wild type mice. In the same surgery, a fiberoptic cannula 
was implanted unilaterally above the MnPO (+0.45 mm AP; +0 mm ML; −3.7 mm DV) or 
PVH (−0.75 mm AP; +0.2 mm ML; −3.9 mm DV).
For photoinhibition experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing eArch3.0 or mCherry were 
injected into the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice. In the same surgery, a fiberoptic cannula was 
implanted unilaterally above the SFO (−2.25 mm DV).
For photometry experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing GCaMP6s or GFP were 
injected into the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice and into the ARC of Agrp-IRES-Cre. In the 
same surgery, a fiberoptic cannula was implanted unilaterally above the SFO (−2.95 mm 
DV) or ARC (−5.7 mm DV).
For projection-mapping experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing synaptophysin-
GCaMP6s were injected into the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice. After four weeks, mice were 
sacrificed and processed for histology.
For rabies tracing experiments, recombinant AAVs expressing TVA and G were injected into 
the SFO of Nos1-IRES-Cre mice. After two weeks, recombinant EnvA-pseudotyped G-
deficient rabies virus expressing GFP was injected into the SFO. After one additional week, 
mice were sacrificed and processed for histology.
For retrobeads tracing experiments, red RetroBeads IX (LumaFluor) were injected into the 
SFO of wild type mice. After one week, mice were sacrificed and processed for histology.
Slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging
Acute forebrain slices were prepared from 8- to 15-week-old Nos1-IRES-Cre mice 
expressing ChETATC, eArch3.0, or GCaMP6s for 2–4 weeks. Fluorescent cells in the SFO 
were identified for whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Slices were sectioned in ice-cold 
oxygenated (95% O2 / 5% CO2) cutting saline containing (in mM) 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 
NaH2PO4, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 210 sucrose, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2. Slices were then transferred 
to oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 25 
NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 15 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and incubated at 34°C for 
30 min. Slices were then stored at room temperature until used. During experiments, slices

 were placed in a recording chamber and superfused with oxygenated ACSF. Glass pipettes 
for recording (3–8 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary (O.D. 1.5 mm, I.D. 
0.86 mm, Sutter Instrument) and filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 125 K 
gluconate, 10 KCl, 4 NaCl, 4 Mg3ATP2, 0.3 Na3ATP, 5 Na2-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES. 
Whole-cell recordings were made at 28°C using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular 
Devices). Data acquisition (filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz) and pulse generation 
were performed using a Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices) and pClamp software (version 
10.5, http://www.moleculardevices.com).
For channelrhodopsin validation, cells were photostimulated under current clamp mode 
using an LED light source (Lambda HPX, Sutter Instruments) pulsing light at 5–40 Hz 
through a 470 nm excitation filter set (U-N41 017, E.X. 470 nm, B.S. 495 nm, E.M. 5, 
Olympus).
For archaerhodopsin validation, cells were activated using currents ranging from 0 pA to 45 
pA (ΔI = 5 pA) for 3 sec in duration injected under current clamp mode. During current 
injection, cells were photosilenced using an LED light source (Lambda HPX, Sutter 
Instruments) sending constant light through a 500 nm excitation filter set (49003, E.X. 500 
nm, B.S. 515 nm, E.M. 5, Chroma Technology).
For calcium imaging validation, cells were activated using currents (30 pA) ranging from 
100 msec to 1 sec (Δt = 100 msec) in duration injected under current clamp mode. Calcium 
imaging was performed simultaneously using a digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA-
ER) mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus, BX51). Micro-manager software (version 
1.4, https://www.micro-manager.org) was used as microscope control interface. After 
loading, cells were imaged (10 msec exposure time; 10 Hz) using an LED light source 
(Lambda HPX, Sutter Instruments) sending constant light through a 470 nm excitation filter 
set (U-N41 017, E.X. 470 nm, B.S. 495 nm, E.M. 5, Olympus). We have previously 
validated the use of GCaMP6s to image calcium signals in ARCAgRP neurons27.
To visualize the responsiveness of SFONos1 neurons to angiotensin II (AngII), 1 µM AngII 
was bath-applied using a slow perfusion system (2 mL/min) during imaging. Data analysis 
followed the basic logic described previously2. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected 
using the polygon selection tool in ImageJ with cell nucleus included. The plot z-axis profile 
function in ImageJ was then used to measure the mean value of each ROI versus frame 
number. Neuropil fluorescence was selected and estimated using the same protocol. Only 
regions located near the cell with no detectable fluorescent neural processes were used. The 
true fluorescence signal of each cell was estimated with function27: Fcell_true(t) = 
Fcell_measured(t) − r × Fneuropil(t), where r = 0.7.
Photostimulation in vivo
All experiments were performed in behavioral chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Habitest 
Modular System) and video recorded using cameras installed above each cage. Experiments 
were performed during the light cycle to control for circadian factors and performed in a 
well-lit environment illuminated with white light. Water consumption was monitored with

 an optical lickometer (Colbourn Instruments). Mice were acclimated to the behavioral 
chamber for at least 15 min prior to the beginning of each testing session.
To test whether acute photostimulation could induce drinking, mice were provided constant 
access to water and monitored for 30 min (pre-stim), then photostimulated for 30 min (stim, 
10 ms pulses at 20 Hz for 1 sec every 4 sec, 20–25 mW) using a DPSS 473 nm laser 
(Shanghai Laser and Optics Century), then monitored for another 30 min (post-stim).
For saline drinking experiments, the same paradigm was used except that mice were 
provided access to 150 mM NaCl in water.
For delayed-access experiments, the same paradigm was used except that stimulation lasted 
60 min instead of 30 min. Water access was removed after 30 min pre-stim period and water 
re-access was provided 30 min later.
For water restriction experiments, mice were water-restricted for 24 h in their home cages, 
acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided access to water for 30 min. 
To compare photostimulation to water restriction, all sessions were aligned to the first lick in 
the stim or water access period.
For food consumption experiments, mice were fed ad libitum in their home cages, 
acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided a single pellet of chow 
without simultaneous access to water for 30 min. After 30 min, chow was removed and the 
amount consumed measured.
Photoinhibition in vivo
All experiments were performed in behavioral chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Habitest 
Modular System) and video recorded using cameras installed above each cage. Experiments 
were performed during the light cycle to control for circadian factors and performed in a 
well-lit environment illuminated with white light. Water consumption was monitored with 
an optical lickometer (Colbourn Instruments). Mice were acclimated to the behavioral 
chamber for at least 15 min prior to the beginning of each testing session.
To test whether acute silencing could inhibit drinking, mice were water-restricted for 24 h in 
their home cages, acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided access to 
water for 15 min with or without optical silencing (10–15 mW) using a DPSS 532 nm laser 
(Shanghai Laser and Optics Century), then monitored for another 15 min without optical 
silencing. Trials with and without photoinhibition (“−laser” and “+laser”) were interleaved.
To test whether acute optical silencing could inhibit prandial drinking in fasted mice, mice 
were fasted for 24 h in their home cages, acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, 
then provided a single pellet of chow under one of two experimental conditions: (1) no water 
access and no laser for 45 min, chow removal, then water access ± laser for 30 min, (2) no 
water access ± laser for 2 h. In experimental condition 2, chow was removed and the amount 
consumed measured every 15 min.

 Fiber photometry
Construction of the rig for performing fiber photometry has been previously described27. 
The signal was output to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research System, SR810) with time 
constant 30 msec to allow filtering of noise at higher frequency. Signal was then digitized 
with LabJack U6-Pro and recorded using software provided by LabJack (http://labjack.com/
support/software) with 250 Hz sampling rate.
All experiments were performed in behavioral chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Habitest 
Modular System) and video recorded using cameras installed above each cage. Experiments 
were performed during the light cycle to control for circadian factors and performed in a 
well-lit environment illuminated with white light. Mice were acclimated to the behavioral 
chamber for at least 15 min with access to 24°C water prior to the beginning of each testing 
session. Photometry data were subjected to minimal processing consisting of only within-
trial fluorescence normalization.
For pharmacological experiments, mice were acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 
min, then given an injection and monitored for 45 min. Angiotensin-II (20 µg/mouse, 200 
µg/mouse), losartan (100 mg/kg), captopril (50 mg/kg), and PEG (40%) were administered 
subcutaneously, and NaCl (1 M, 2 M, 3 M), mannitol (2 M), and isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) 
were administered intraperitoneally. All subcutaneous injections were given in a total 
volume of 400 µL with PBS as vehicle, and all intraperitoneal injections were given in a 
total volume of 150 µL with PBS as vehicle. To block angiotensin signaling, losartan was 
administered 30 min prior to angiotensin-II, and losartan + captopril (described as 
“angiotensin blockers” and “INH”) were administered simultaneously to PEG/NaCl/
isoproterenol/chow access. Losartan is a selective angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) 
antagonist, and captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Mice were 
not provided access to water unless otherwise noted.
For water restriction experiment in Fig. 2a, mice were placed in the behavioral chamber and 
calcium signals recorded for 10 min on day one (“baseline”). Mice were then returned to 
their home cages and water-restricted for 24 h. After 24 h of water restriction, mice were 
placed in the behavioral chamber and calcium signals again recorded for 10 min on day two 
(“restriction”). Mice were then returned to their home cages and immediately provided 
access to water. After 1 h of water re-access, mice were placed in the behavioral chamber 
and calcium signals again recorded for 10 min (“re-access”). Photometry settings, including 
laser power and time constant, were the same for every mouse and every recording session. 
The reported fluorescence was calculated as the median fluorescence of minutes 5–10 of 
each recording.
For other water restriction experiments, mice were water-restricted for 48 h in their home 
cages, acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided access to water for 45 
min. For all experiments, the opening of a guillotine port cued water access.
For salt-loading experiments, mice were acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, 
then given an intraperitoneal injection of 150 µL 3 M NaCl. After 45 min, mice were 
provided access for 45 min to a bottle that was either empty, contained 12°C, 24°C, or 36°C

 water, or contained 24°C 300 mM NaCl in water. Quantification of PSTHs in Fig. 3f,h refers 
to ΔF/F at 15 sec.
For oral cooling experiments, mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 150 µL 3 M 
NaCl. After 10–15 min, a piece of dry metal (ice-cold, “oral cooling”; room temperature, 
“sham”) was placed in the oral cavity, held for 30 sec, then removed. This process was 
repeated after >60 sec wait with metal of the other temperature. The temperature order was 
counter-balanced across trials.
For sucrose drinking experiments, mice were provided access to food and water ad libitum 
before testing. Mice were acclimated to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided ad 
libitum access to 150 mM sucrose for >2 h.
For fasting-refeeding experiments, mice were fasted for 24 h in their home cages, acclimated 
to the behavioral chamber for 15 min, then provided a single pellet of chow either with or 
without simultaneous access to water for 45 min. After 45 min, chow was removed and the 
amount consumed measured, and mice were immediately provided access to water for 45 
min.
For Pavlovian conditioning experiments, mice were acclimated to the behavioral chamber 
for 15 min, then given an intraperitoneal injection of 150 µL 3 M NaCl. After 45 min, an 
auditory cue was played (2.9 kHz, 300 msec; Colbourn Instruments), and three seconds later 
mice the water port was opened and mice were provided access to water for 45 min.
Data analysis
All data were analyzed with custom MATLAB code. Throughout the paper, a drinking bout 
is defined as any set of ten or more licks in which no inter-lick interval is greater than one 
second.
For photometry data, all responses were normalized to baseline using the function: ΔF/F = 
(F – F0)/F0, where F0 is the median fluorescence of the baseline period. The baseline period 
for full experiments was 15 min before time zero, and the baseline period for peristimulus 
time histograms around drinking bouts was 60 sec before the first lick or 60 sec after the last 
lick in a bout (15 sec for cue and empty bottle plots). Time zero was defined as the moment 
the mouse was returned to the behavioral chamber following injection, the moment of water 
access, or the moment of chow access. The time constant, τ, was estimated as before27. In 
bar graphs quantifying ΔF/F, the median fluorescence of a 1 sec window around the 
indicated time is reported, and 1 min before time zero is reported as baseline.
For rabies tracing experiments, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 
formalin. Brains were post-fixed overnight in formalin and placed in 20% sucrose for 24 h. 
Free-floating sections (40 µm) were prepared with a cryostat and half of sections were 
immediately mounted and imaged by direct fluorescence with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal 
microscope. Quantification was performed using the cell counter tool in ImageJ.

 Plasma osmolality
For water restriction experiments, wild type mice were water-restricted for 24 h, then 
provided access to water at t = 0. For salt-loading experiments, wild type mice were given an 
intraperitoneal injection of 150 µL 3 M NaCl at t = 0, then provided access to water at t = 45 
min. For fasting-refeeding experiments, wild type mice were fasted for 24 h, then provided a 
single pellet of chow without simultaneous access to water at t = 0. At t = 45 min, chow was 
removed, and mice were immediately provided access to water. At a single time-point per 
session (hydrated, 0 min, 5 min, 45 min for water restriction experiments; 0 min, 5 min, 45 
min, 50 min, 90 min for salt-loading experiments; fed, 0 min, 15 min, 45 min, 50 min for 
fasting-refeeding experiments), 125 µL of blood was collected from the tail vein using 
EDTA-coated capillary tubes (RAM Scientific). Plasma was isolated by centrifugation, and 
osmolality was measured using a freezing point osmometer (Fiske Associates). Mice were 
allowed one week for recovery between sessions.
Plasma protein
Wild type mice were water-restricted for 24 h, then provided access to water at t = 0. At a 
single time-point per session (hydrated, 0 min, 5 min, 45 min), 125 µL of blood was 
collected from the tail vein using EDTA-coated capillary tubes (RAM Scientific). Plasma 
was isolated by centrifugation, and plasma protein concentration was measured using a BCA 
protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mice were allowed one week for recovery 
between sessions. Plasma protein concentration is inversely proportional to plasma volume.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by formalin. Brains were post-fixed 
overnight in formalin and placed in 20% sucrose for 24 h. Free-floating sections (40 µm) 
were prepared with a cryostat, blocked (3% BSA, 2% NGS, and 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 2 
h), then incubated with primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP, Abcam, ab13970, 1:1000; rat 
anti-RFP, ChromoTek, 5f8, 1:2000; rabbit anti-cFos, Santa Cruz Biotech, sc52, 1:1000) 
overnight at 4°C (two nights for cFos staining). Sections were then washed, incubated with 
secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken, Life Technologies, a11039, 1:1000; 
Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rat, Life Technologies, a11077, 1:1000; Alexa Fluor 568 goat 
anti-rabbit, Life Technologies, a11011, 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature, mounted, and 
imaged with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Sections stained for cFos underwent 
unmasking before blocking (1% H2O2 + 1% NaOH in PBS for 10 min; 0.3% glycine in PBS 
for 10 min; 0.03% SDS in PBS for 10 min).

a, SFONos1 neurons monitor the composition of the blood by sensing plasma osmolarity and, 
via angiotensin, plasma volume and pressure. SFONos1 neurons predict the future state of the 
blood by integrating temperature-dependent inputs from the mouth and osmolarity-
