 Progression of Metabolic Syndrome Severity During the Menopausal
Transition

Background-—After menopause, women exhibit a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and higher risk of
cardiovascular disease. However, the timing of changes in MetS severity over the menopausal transition and whether these
changes differ by racial/ethnic group remain unclear.
Methods and Results-—We assessed data from 1470 women from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort who
experienced transition in menopausal status over 10 years (visits 1–4). We used linear mixed models to evaluate changes by
menopausal status (premenopause, perimenopause, and postmenopause) in a MetS severity Z-score and in the individual MetS
components. While there were gradual increases in MetS severity over time across menopause stages, black women in particular
exhibited more rapid progression in MetS severity during the premenopausal and perimenopausal periods than during the
postmenopausal period. In the postmenopausal period (compared with prior periods), white women exhibited unfavorable
decreases in high-density lipoprotein, while black women exhibited favorable alterations in the rate of change for waist
circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and glucose, contributing to the slowed progression of MetS severity. These
changes were all observed after adjusting for hormone replacement treatment.
Conclusions-—During menopausal transition, women exhibited rapid increases in MetS severity during the premenopausal and
perimenopausal periods, with black women having significant reductions in this increase in severity during the postmenopausal
period. These data suggest that the higher prevalence of MetS in postmenopausal women may be caused more by changes during
the menopausal transition than by postmenopause. These findings may thus have implications regarding the timing of
cardiovascular risk relative to menopause. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003609 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003609)

T
he transition through menopause has been implicated in
a significant increase in risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD) to a point where postmenopausal women have rates of
CVD equal to or greater than those seen in men.1,2 Many have
hypothesized that this higher CVD risk is related to an
increase in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) during the
menopausal transition, beyond what is seen from aging
alone.3 Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that
compared
with
premenopausal
women,
postmenopausal
women have significantly more visceral obesity4 and MetS.5
However,
it
remains
unclear
whether
these
processes
progress more rapidly during the transition through meno-
pause or during the postmenopausal period.3
Longitudinal studies that followed premenopausal women
and compared changes in visceral adiposity between those
who did and did not progress through menopause noted
significant advances in visceral adiposity6,7 and the preva-
lence of MetS among those who became postmenopausal
during the study period. However, close examination of the
data reveals that those who remained premenopausal at
follow-up had advances in these measures of similar or
greater degree than those who completed menopause.1,6,7 In
some cases, the rate of change of components of MetS or
insulin sensitivity appeared to be slower after menopausal
transition—even among women who did not take hormone
replacement.1,7 Janssen et al reported that among 1644
women followed through the menopausal transition, the

 yearly change in triglyceride levels slowed significantly after
the final menstrual period, while systolic blood pressure
decreased
after
menopause.1
Conversely,
high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels unfavorably decreased
after menopause, while the rate of change in waist circum-
ference did not differ. Finally, among these women, blacks
were less likely than whites to develop MetS over the
menopausal transition (odds ratio 0.74), though this failed to
reach statistical significance.1 Thus, the overall change in
MetS during the menopausal transition, its timing, and any
racial/ethnic difference in these changes remain unclear.
We recently developed a MetS severity score8,9 that is
linked to long-term risk of CVD10 and diabetes.11 We noted
that the rate of increase in MetS severity was significantly
higher among middle-aged women than among middle-aged
men.12 The goal of the current project was to assess
participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) study for changes in the rate of progression of MetS
severity during the menopausal transition, including whether
these rates varied by race/ethnicity. We hypothesized that
given the potential for women to have greater visceral fat after
menopause (because of insufficient estrogen levels), MetS
would worsen more rapidly after menopause compared with
before or during perimenopausal years. Such data could
clarify the timing of change in a key CVD risk factor among
postmenopausal women.
Methods
ARIC is a large community-based epidemiological cohort
study that started in 1987–1989 across 4 field centers in the
United States. Further details regarding study design and
objectives are published elsewhere.13 A total of 5943 white
women and 2464 black women were enrolled. The institu-
tional review boards of the following participating institutions
approved the study: University of Mississippi Medical Center,
Jackson State University, Tougaloo College, University of
North Carolina, University of Minnesota, Johns Hopkins
University, and University of Florida. All participants provided
written informed consent.
Menopausal status among women who reported having
had menstrual periods (ie, those without primary amenorrhea)
was categorized following the technique of Nabulsi for this
cohort.14 At each visit, women were asked, “Have you had any
menstrual periods during the past 2 years?” and “Have you
reached menopause?” They were also asked questions related
to the surgical removal of ovaries and uterus. Women who had
a menstrual period within the previous 2 years but denied
current menopause were classified as “premenopausal.”
Women who had a menstrual period within the previous
2 years and answered “yes” or “uncertain” to the question
regarding
current
menopause
were
classified
as
“perimenopausal.” Women who had not had a menstrual
period within the previous 2 years and did not have surgical
removal of ovaries or uterus were classified as natural
“postmenopausal.” Our analysis data set included only those
women 60 years and younger at baseline with fasting
laboratory values, baseline menopause information, and no
history of coronary heart disease or diabetes at baseline (see
Figure S1). Because we were interested specifically in
changes in MetS severity during the menopausal transition,
we restricted our primary analysis to women who progressed
in their menopausal stage over the course of the 4 visits,
either
from
premenopausal
to
perimenopausal,
pre-
menopausal to postmenopausal, or perimenopausal to post-
menopausal. As an overall comparison of the rate of change in
MetS severity, we also assessed for MetS changes in women
who were postmenopausal at baseline. The minimum entry
age for ARIC (45 years) precluded our ability to assess women
who remained premenopausal through all 4 visits.
Women were asked regarding use of current hormonal
replacement therapy (regardless of route of administration) at
each visit; these data were categorized as estrogen, estrogen
plus progesterone, or none in assessing the relationship
between current hormone replacement therapy as related to
the change in MetS severity. We did not find significant
differences in the change in MetS over time between estrogen
and estrogen plus progesterone and thus grouped these
together in the final analysis to maximize power.
MetS severity Z scores were calculated for participants at
all 4 visits by using sex- and race-based formulas. As
described elsewhere,8,9 these scores were derived by using
a confirmatory factor analysis approach for the 5 traditional
MetS components (waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose) to
determine the weighted contribution of each of these
components to a latent MetS “factor” on a sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific basis. Confirmatory factor analysis was
performed among adults aged 20 to 64 years from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
with categorization into 6 subgroups based on sex and the
following self-identified race/ethnicities: non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. For each of these 6
population subgroups, loading coefficients for the 5 MetS
components were determined toward a single MetS factor.
These loading coefficients were used to generate equations to
calculate a standardized MetS severity score for each
subgroup (http://mets.health-outcomes-policy.ufl.edu/calcu-
lator/). The resulting MetS severity scores are Z scores
(normally distributed and ranging from theoretical negative
infinity to theoretical positive infinity with mean=0 and SD=1)
of relative MetS severity on a sex- and race/ethnicity-specific
basis. These scores are highly correlated to other surrogate
markers of MetS risk, including high-sensitivity C-reactive

 protein,8 uric acid,8 the Homeostasis Model of Insulin
Resistance,8 and adiponectin,15 and were recently shown to
correlate with long-term CVD10,15 and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM)11,15 risk in the Princeton Lipid Research
Cohort Study. These scores were also examined descriptively
over time in ARIC.12
All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS
Version 9.4, and statistical significance was set to a=0.05.
Descriptive statistics were calculated at baseline and across
the 4 visits of the study. The primary outcome was MetS
severity as measured by the Z-score described earlier. The
traditional MetS components (waist circumference, HDL,
triglycerides, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure) that
compose the Z-score were also examined individually. Linear
mixed models were used to model MetS Z-score over time (as
a function of years postbaseline) among women who
progressed in their menopausal stage at some level during
ARIC, including a random intercept and random slope to
effectively account for the correlation among observations
from each participant. Our focus on only women who had ≥1
menopausal transition during the study naturally limited our
analysis to primarily women who remained in the study.
Nonetheless, missing MetS scores at follow-up visits was
possible, and the mixed-model approach allows for this
missingness assuming a random missing mechanism. A linear
spline approach with 2 knots was used among the fixed effect
of years postbaseline, which allowed for a linear slope during
premenopause as well as increments to this slope during the
perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages individually. To
summarize, the following model was fit, showing only the fixed
effects of primary interest:
MetS zij ¼ a þ b1ðyearsijÞ þ b2ðperi yearsijÞ
þ b3ðpost yearsijÞ þ . . .
Here, for a given participant i, years begins at 0 for her
initial visit (j=1), and for each additional visit (j=2,3,4), the
number of years relative to the first visit allows for estimation
of a “baseline” increase in MetS severity that would represent
the increase during the premenopausal stage (b1). For those
visits where participant I reports to be perimenopausal or
postmenopausal, the number of years in that stage (starting
at 0 for the first visit with that report) enters into the
equation given to allow for estimation of the parameters b2
and b3. Thus, b1+b2 represents the estimated slope during
perimenopause, and b1+b3 represents the slope during
postmenopause. The interaction with race was explored to
assess whether the magnitude of these increases in severity
over time differed between black and white women in all 3
stages. In the context of the given model, separate param-
eters were fit to estimate slopes for the 3 stages separately
by race, which were then statistically tested between the 2
races. Finally, to account for possible confounding, age,
education, baseline income, and use of hormone replacement
therapy at each visit were included in the models that
represent the central analysis and in any comparisons
reassessed. Model-estimated means were then produced
over a 9-year follow-up period including model-estimated
changes between each of the 3 menopausal stages every
3 years to visualize the observed changes in slopes. Similar
models were fit for each of the 5 MetS components (by using
the natural log transformation for triglycerides to achieve
normality). Inference about the fixed effects was based on the
Kenward–Roger estimate of the denominator degrees of
freedom. For triglycerides, these log-transformed values were
then backtransformed for the sake of data presentation.
Results
During the 4 visits of ARIC (median of 9 years of follow-up),
1470 women exhibited a transition in menopausal status and
were included in the central analysis. Of these 1470 women,
59 women (4%) dropped out after visit 2 and 121 (8%)
dropped out after visit 3. Table 1 displays their characteristics
by race. Black participants had higher baseline waist circum-
ference, systolic blood pressure, and glucose but lower
triglycerides and were more likely to have hypertension. White
participants were more likely to be taking hormonal replace-
ment therapy. An additional 2674 women who were post-
menopausal and without diabetes at baseline and 270 women
who remained premenopausal throughout the study were
used as separate comparator groups (Table S1).
Table 2 shows model estimates of MetS severity Z-scores
by menopausal status and race. In models adjusted only for
age, women overall, and black women in particular, exhibited
a more rapid rate of increase in MetS severity during the
premenopausal and perimenopausal periods compared with
during the postmenopausal period (all P<0.05). The rate of
increase in MetS severity during the premenopausal period
was more rapid among black than among white women
(P<0.001).

period relative to earlier periods. For white women, there was
a decrease in the rate of MetS progression from the
perimenopausal period to the postmenopausal period (from
0.076 to 0.062), but this failed to reach statistical significance

and perimenopausal periods (P<0.001 and P=0.036, respec-
tively). As a comparison, women who were postmenopausal at
study entry (mean age 54 years) exhibited a rate of change in
MetS severity Z-scores of 0.057 (0.052, 0.062) per year for
white women and 0.061 (0.053, 0.069) per year for black
women (Tables S1 and S2), while women who remained
premenopausal throughout the study (mean age 45 years)
had a rate of change of 0.057 (0.039, 0.074) for white women
and 0.115 (0.080, 0.150) for black women (Table S3). Use of
estrogen replacement therapy was not associated with slope
in MetS severity during any of the menopausal stages. A
sensitivity analysis that excluded women who had menopause
because of surgical removal of ovaries resulted in similar
results.

 postmenopausal period compared with during the peri-
menopausal period. These rates of change differed by race
over the menopausal transition, with black women exhibiting
more favorable rates of change during the postmenopausal
period than white women with respect to waist circumference
(P<0.001), triglycerides (P<0.01), HDL (P<0.05), and fasting
glucose (P<0.05).
Discussion
We found that both overall and particularly among black women
in ARIC, the rate of increase in MetS severity was rapid during
the menopausal transition and decreased afterward. This most
closely paralleled a rapid rise in triglyceride levels, as had been
noted in previous studies of women during menopause.1,16
While there has been appreciation of higher prevalence of ATP-
III MetS in postmenopausal versus premenopausal women,1,3,5
our study is unique in using an integrated assessment of MetS
severity to demonstrate that this higher prevalence of MetS
appear to be because of rapid progression of MetS severity in
the years leading up to menopause (the late premenopausal
and perimenopausal periods) and less because of progression
after menopause. These rates (yearly increases in MetS Z-score
of 0.069–0.113/y during the premenopausal and peri-
menopausal period) appeared higher than those among men
in ARIC (who exhibited increases of on average 0.03/y12),
similar to women who were premenopausal throughout the
study (increases of 0.057–0.115/y) and slightly higher than
women who were postmenopausal at baseline (increases of
0.057–0.061/y). Given long-term links between MetS severity
and future diabetes type 211 and CVD,10 these data may have
implications for relationships between worsening MetS and
increased CVD risk after menopause.2
We were especially struck by the difference in progression
of MetS severity between black and white women. We had
previously documented that current criteria for diagnosing
MetS did not identify apparent risk among blacks. There is
particularly among black men a low rate of MetS diagnosis
compared with whites men despite worsened insulin resis-
tance and higher rates of chronic disease associated with
MetS.17–20 It is for this reason that we formulated the MetS
severity score to be sex and race/ethnicity specific, by using
confirmatory factor analysis to account for how MetS was
manifest in each sex and racial/ethnic group.8,9 It is possible
that the relative race/ethnicity-specific nature of this score is
the reason that we noted a difference between black and
white women when other analyses of MetS during menopause
had failed to do so.1 It is also possible that the higher MetS
severity scores in black women compared with those in white
women reflect that these scores had yielded a theoretical
maximum, contributing to the lower rate of change in
menopause. Nevertheless, in our analysis, black women
exhibited more rapid increases in fasting glucose in the years
leading up to menopause at a time when these levels were
already higher than in white women, suggesting that these
changes may indeed represent biological differences in
diabetes risk by race/ethnicity over the menopausal transi-
tion. The reason for these racial differences is unclear but did
not appear to be because of socioeconomic status, education,
or hormone replacement therapy, which were included in the
models.
The proportion of participants taking estrogen replacement
therapy after menopause were high in this study, with higher
use among white (13.8%) versus black (6.6%) women, raising
potential that this discrepancy in hormone replacement could
account for the racial differences in MetS progression among
postmenopausal women in the study. Oral (but not transder-
mal or vaginal) administration of estrogen suppresses fat
oxidation,

note differences in the rate of change in MetS severity by
current estrogen use—although we lacked data regarding
dose and adherence to estrogen use, which may have further
influenced any effect. Overall, however, hormone replacement
did not appear to explain the racial differences in MetS
severity.
The mechanisms behind the slower rate progression of
MetS severity after menopause are unclear but could be related
to changes in estrogen levels and related action of adipocytes
and hepatic function.3,25,26 Tepper et al demonstrated that
while there is an overall decline in estradiol levels between
6 years before and 1 year after the final menstrual period
(when estradiol levels stabilize), the pattern of this decline is
variable. In 60% of white and 25% of black women, there is an
initial rise in estradiol to 50% above baseline.27 While we lacked
estradiol levels among the women in ARIC, the duration of
these fluctuations in estradiol before stabilization coincides
temporally with the time frame of more rapid MetS changes
during the menopausal transition. As mentioned previously,
oral estradiol decreases fatty acid oxidation.23 Nevertheless, it
remains
unclear
why
endogenous
increases
and
then
decreases in estradiol would be involved in a rise in
triglycerides and/or other MetS components.
Many of the changes in MetS during the menopausal
transition have previously been attributed to the effect of
decreasing levels of estradiol on the transition between
gynecoid and android body habitus. Women exhibit a
tendency
toward
visceral
fat
accumulation
during
the
menopausal transition, though it is difficult to separate the
influence of menopause from the natural tendency toward
fat accumulation with age.6,28 Certainly, mice that are
deficient in estradiol (because of a genetic deletion of the
gene for aromatase) exhibit an increase in visceral fat and
resultant insulin resistance compared with their wild-type
counterparts.29 Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that
the rate of change in waist circumference was not signif-
icantly different during the stages of the menopausal
transition among white women, while black women in the
sample exhibited a slower rate of change in waist circum-
ference after menopause. These findings are consistent with
data from prior clinical studies.1,30 Sowers et al noted an
increase in waist circumference the year after the final
menstrual
period
followed
by
a
stabilization
(or
even
decrease) in waist circumference.30 Janssen et al noted
steady increases in waist circumference over a period
including 6 years before and 6 years after menopause.1
Thus, the effect of decreased estrogen on visceral fat mass
may be less significant than the overall tendency toward
weight gain by age.

MetS Severity During Menopausal Transition
Gurka et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
 This study had several limitations. We relied on a
composite
assessment
of
menopause,
in
which
peri-
menopausal women were classified on the basis of having
had a menstrual period in the 2 years before study visit but
answered “yes” or “uncertain” regarding whether they had
undergone menopause, while postmenopause was classified
only among women who had not had a menstrual period for
2 years. Because menopause is most commonly catego-
rized after 1 year without menses, the “perimenopausal”
group
included
some
women
who
had
experienced
menopause (as it is usually characterized) up to 1 year
earlier. Nevertheless, we did not believe that this classifi-
cation detracted significantly from our assessment because
this study focused on changes observed during the years
surrounding the menopausal transition. Indeed, the hetero-
geneous nature of women in the perimenopausal group
could have been expected to bias the study toward a
higher degree of variability and less likely to identify the
changes that we observed. In addition, our findings of a
slower
rate
of
progression
of
MetS
postmenopause
remained true, even ignoring the perimenopausal classifi-
cation and only comparing directly to the premenopausal
group. Owing to the age of women at study entry and
length of follow-up, we lacked a group of women who were
not
in
the
age
range
for
being
near
the
timing
of
menopause, though the women in the study who remained
premenopausal had similar rates to the perimenopausal
women. While the mixed models we used allowed for
missing data, it is possible that dropout was nonignorable,
as women who remained in the study may have been
healthier
than
those
who
dropped
out.
However,
the
relatively low rates of dropout given the nature of the
primary
sample
most
likely
does
not
bias
the
slope
comparisons between whites and blacks. This study had
significant strengths in following a large cohort longitudi-
nally and assessing novel markers of MetS severity.
In conclusion, we found that the progression of MetS is
rapid during the course of the menopausal transition but
slows afterward among black women. This appears to be
unrelated to hormone replacement and may have bearing
on the higher prevalence of MetS among postmenopausal
women
and
related
cardiovascular
and
diabetes
risk.
Further research is needed to determine whether interven-
tions
during
the
menopausal
transition
such
as
diet,
exercise, and insulin-sensitizing medication could slow this
rate of progression of MetS severity and lower risk of
future disease.
