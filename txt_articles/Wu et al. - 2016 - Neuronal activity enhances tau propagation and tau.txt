Tau protein can transfer between neurons transneuronally and trans-synaptically, which is 
thought to explain the progressive spread of tauopathy observed in the brain of patients with 
Alzheimer’s Disease. Here we show that physiological tau released from donor cells can 
transfer to recipient cells via the medium, suggesting that at least one mechanism by which 
tau can transfer is via the extracellular space. Neuronal activity has been shown to regulate 
tau secretion, but its effect on tau pathology is unknown. Using optogenetic and 
chemogenetic approaches, we found that increased neuronal activity stimulates the release of

 tau in vitro, and enhances tau pathology in vivo. These data have implications for disease 
pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies.
Misfolded, hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule stabilizing protein tau accumulate 
as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the earliest stages of the disease, 
tau is found in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons located in the transentorhinal 
cortex (EC)1. Tau pathology spreads medially and worsens in the EC; it then accumulates 
within limbic areas, followed by neocortical areas in a pattern that suggests spread along 
neuroanatomical connections1. Various mouse models have been created to replicate the 
progressive spread of pathology including those using regional promoters2–4, inoculation 
models5–9 and viral models10,11 and it is now well established that tau has the capability to 
transfer between cells both in vivo and in vitro8,12. Two hypotheses have been proposed to 
explain the propagation of tau pathology. First, intracellular tau could transfer directly 
between cells through physical connections such as tunneling nanotubes, as shown in vitro 
for misfolded proteins such as prion13. Alternatively, tau could be released into the 
extracellular space, either as free tau or within vesicles such as exosomes14–16 or 
ectosomes17. Data showing that tau is present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
interstitial fluid (ISF) of tau transgenic mouse lines18–20 and the CSF and ISF of AD brain21 
together with data showing tau is released into the medium of cultured neurons22 support the 
second hypothesis. Although there is strong evidence that tau is released from cells, the 
competence of extracellular tau generated in vitro, by neurons, to contribute to cell to cell 
propagation has not been tested. Using physiologically relevant culture systems, including 
human iPSCs, we have shown that tau released from donor cells into the medium can be 
internalized by recipient cells where it can stimulate the generation of more aberrant tau. 
Furthermore, using a tripartite microfluidic system, we have shown that the aberrant tau 
generated in recipients can be passed to subsequent recipient cells indicating true 
propagation.
The mechanism by which tau can be released from neurons is unknown, however its release 
can be stimulated by enhanced neuronal activity both in vitro22 and in vivo23. As cells 
within the AD13 brain could be hyperexcitable24–28, the impact of enhanced neuronal 
activity on tauopathy is of significant interest. Using sophisticated optogenetic and 
chemogenetic manipulations we have demonstrated that increasing neuronal activity can not 
only enhance release and transfer of tau in vitro, but also exacerbate tau pathology in vivo.
Results
Endogenously generated tau transfers from cell to cell
To examine whether physiologically relevant, human tau (hTau) can transfer between 
neurons, we cultured neurons derived from a transgenic mouse line expressing hTau P301L 
(line rTg4510, “donor”)29 with neurons from a MAPT−/−:GFP (tau knockout-GFP line (KO, 
“recipient”)30 (Fig. 1a). After 2 weeks, hTau accumulated in the cytosol and neurites of 
recipient cells grown on plates (Fig. 1b, cell C) and in microfluidic chambers (MFs, Fig. 1c, 
arrows). To determine whether highly aggregated forms of tau have a greater propensity for 
neuron-to-neuron transfer, we compared the effects of two types of seeds on tau transfer; 
clone 9 seeds that have been shown to induce the formation of robust aggregates of tau, or

 clone 1 seeds that do not induce the formation of aggregates of tau8. In this experiment, the 
tau that is expressed in donor cells was fluorescently tagged (repeat domain RD P301S YFP) 
so that it could be directly visualized within the recipients. Lysate containing clone 1 seeds 
did not readily induce any obvious aggregates in donor cells even after extensive culturing 
(20 days in vitro). In contrast, when lysate containing clone 9 seeds was added, YFP-tagged 
endogenous tau began forming perinuclear aggregates in cells after 5 days in vitro (DIV). 
The number of cells forming tau aggregates increased dramatically after 20 DIV, 
demonstrating that template induced tau aggregation is time-dependent (Fig. 2a). To assess 
whether induced tau aggregates were transferred to recipients, seeded donor cells were co-
cultured with mCherry-expressing recipient neurons. YFP-tau from clone 9 seeded cells, but 
not clone 1 seeded cells readily accumulated in the cytoplasm of recipient cells (Fig. 2b, cell 
A, B; Fig. 2c). Controls included neurons expressing YFP but no tau, co-cultured with 
neurons expressing mCherry. In the absence of tau, no transfer of YFP or mCherry was seen 
(data not shown).
To test whether aggregate formation can be induced in downstream cells, we turned to a bi- 
and tripartite microfluidic chamber device (Figs. 3a,d). The chambers allow axons from one 
compartment to grow through microchannels into an adjacent compartment while isolating 
cell bodies and dendrites within one compartment. Importantly, the fluidically isolated 
microenvironment in each chamber allows for the delivery of agents such as seeds to one 
cell population without crossing over into the next compartment9,31. RD YFP neurons were 
grown in each chamber. Unseeded tau expressing cells did not form visible aggregates (Fig. 
3b); however, adding clone 9 seeded lysate to cells in the first compartment (population 1) 
induced endogenous YFP-tagged tau to form aggregates (Fig. 3c). Endogenous tau in 
neurons grown in the second compartment (population 2) formed aggregates after 12–15 
DIV in response to aggregated tau being formed and transferred from population 1 (Fig. 3c). 
To confirm true cell-to-cell tau propagation, we utilized tripartite MFs and added seed-
containing lysate only to neurons in the first compartment (population 1). We then examined 
whether tau aggregates could propagate not only to the second compartment (population 2), 
but also to the third compartment (population 3) (Fig. 3d). After 15–18 DIV, tau aggregates 
were found in some population 3 neurons (Fig. 3e). The misfolded conformation of these 
aggregates was confirmed by staining with X-34, a fluorescent congo red derivative that 
binds to neurofibrillary tangles (Fig. 3f)32.
Tau transfers to recipients via the extracellular medium
We next examined whether tau transfer from donor neurons to recipient neurons requires 
cell-to-cell contact, or if tau released into the extracellular fluid is sufficient. Lysate and 
conditioned medium (CM) from primary neurons overexpressing tau, or neurons infected 
with tau virus was collected, tau was immunoprecipitated using a human tau specific 
antibody and analyzed by western blot analysis. Tau was detected in the media of both cell 
models (Fig. 4a). Actin was present in lysates but absent in media fraction demonstrating 
that the media was not contaminated with cell debris. Next, we incubated wild-type (wt) 
recipient neurons with CM from hTau-expressing donor cells for the following incubation 
periods: 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day or 6 days. Recipient neurons accumulated tau 
within hours and had a significant amount of tau accumulation by 6 days (Fig. 4b).

 Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the internalized tau initially accumulated in 
discrete puncta in the cytosol and dendrites of recipient neurons after 2 days (Fig. 4c) but it 
later appeared more diffusely distributed in cell bodies and neurites (Fig. 4c). To confirm 
that tau was released into the medium from cells expressing it at physiological levels, we 
examined induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that were differentiated into cortical neurons 
by dual SMAD inhibition followed by an extended period of in vitro corticogenesis (Figs. 
4d,e)33. In vitro corticogenesis using this method has been shown to take up to 90 days, 
producing all classes of glutamatergic projection neurons that make mature, functional 
synapses that are capable of firing repetitive action potentials34. Immunoblotting of whole 
cell lysates at time points throughout differentiation (Fig. 4d) showed a single band that was 
immunoreactive for tau at all time points from day 20 onwards. Comparison with a 
recombinant tau ladder confirmed this was the 0N3R tau isoform, consistent with previous 
reports that iPSC-neurons mainly express fetal tau isoform and not the adult isoform ratio of 
equivalent 3R:4R35. Cortical progenitor rosettes positive for the early forebrain marker Pax6 
and the proliferation marker Ki67 were observed at day 20 of differentiation (Fig. 4e). At 
this time point, tau was observed in a subset of cells but it did not colocalize with Ki67, 
suggesting that tau expression is restricted to post-mitotic neurons. By day 100 of 
differentiation, the majority of cultured cells showed stereotypic neuronal morphology such 
as high levels of tau expression and extended neurites. To assess whether tau could be 
internalized, we transferred CM from iPSCs to mouse primary wt neurons. After six days, 
human tau was observed in the neurites of the recipient cells with a similar distribution 
pattern to the tau generated by the transgenic mouse neurons (Fig. 4f). This result is 
consistent with a recent finding showing tau from mouse and human brain extracts, and the 
ISF from the rTg4510 line are internalized by recipients20.
Neuronal activity stimulates tau release and spread
Increased neuronal activity has been shown to stimulate tau release in wild type and human 
tau-overexpressing transgenic mouse models in vitro22 and in vivo23, however, it is not 
known if stimulation leads to release of tau from human neurons with physiological levels of 
tau. To examine this, we measured the amount of tau released into media from human iPSC 
neurons, as well as murine tau expressing neurons (wild type) and neurons overexpressing 
mutant human tau (rTg4510 line), before, and after treatment with picrotoxin, a non-
competitive channel blocker for the GABA receptor chloride channels36 (Fig. 5a). In all 
three systems, stimulation with picrotoxin increased tau in the media by 150% – 210% 
compared to tau levels in the media prior to the addition of picrotoxin, or compared to media 
from neurons treated with buffer alone, without causing cell death (Fig. 5b). To examine 
whether increasing neuronal activity leads to enhanced tau release, we used an optogenetic 
approach in one of our culture models to directly stimulate neuronal action potentials37. 
Cells expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) can be depolarized by exposure to blue light at 
473 nm wavelength. Primary neurons from a wt mouse were transfected with fluorescently 
tagged hTau and ChR2 expressing viral vectors (Figs. 5c,d). Media was removed and 
analyzed for human tau levels before, and after light stimulation. Whole cell recording was 
performed simultaneously to confirm activation (Figs. 5e,f). After neurons were stimulated 
for 30 min (0.1 mW mm−2, 2 s intervals), tau in the media increased approximately 250% 
(Fig. 5g), similar to the amount of tau released from neurons following picrotoxin treatment

 (Fig. 5a). Optogenetic stimulation did not result in cell death as shown by patch clamp 
recording of individual cells (Figs. 5e,f) and more globally, by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
assessment (Fig. 5h). To test whether stimulating neuronal activity can enhance cell-to-cell 
transfer of tau in addition to tau release, we added picrotoxin to co-cultures of neurons that 
made hTau aggregates (RD YFP with C9 seeded lysate) or mCherry (Fig. 6), and quantified 
the percent of mCherry cells containing YFP tau aggregates. After two weeks of co-
culturing, neurons were fixed and examined using confocal microscopy (Fig. 6a). 
Quantification of IF images demonstrated that stimulating neuronal activity increased the 
percentage of cells that had taken up tau from approximately 20% of mCherry cells to 45% 
of mCherry cells (Fig. 6b).
Enhanced neuronal activity accelerates tauopathy in vivo
Tau has been shown to accumulate in the ISF following administration of picrotoxin in 
vivo23, however it is not known if enhancing neuronal activity accelerates tauopathy. To 
address this important question, we used two approaches to increase neuronal activity in two 
different tau mouse models. Using an optogenetic approach, ChR2 was expressed in neurons 
under the CamKII promoter37 for 10 days and optical fibers were implanted in both left and 
right hippocampi of the rTg4510 line, but only the left hippocampus was stimulated with 
blue light (470 nm). Tau pathology in the left (stimulated) hemisphere was compared to the 
right (non stimulated) hemisphere (Fig. 7a). In vivo recordings confirmed that blue light 
induced an increase in hippocampal activity (Fig. 7b). Neuronal firing in response to blue 
light ON was instantaneous with minimal time lag (<10 ms) and the firing rate 
approximately doubled during stimulation. When the blue light was OFF, the firing rate 
returned to normal. The EEG and spike firing pattern did not show any epileptic-like 
phenotype and seizures were not observed (data not shown). Recording from the right 
hemisphere showed that ChR2-controlled firing did not lead to firing in the non-stimulated 
hemisphere (data not shown). After 20 days of stimulation, mice were sacrificed within 75 
mins of the last stimulation, and the brain tissue was processed for immunolabeling of the 
activity-induced immediate early gene, c-Fos, which was readily observed in the stimulated 
hippocampus (Fig. 7c). When immunolabeled with anti-tau antibodies, we observed that the 
stimulated hippocampus had accumulated more human tau (labeled with TauY9 and CP27 
antibodies) in the cell bodies. This was particularly evident in the posterior and anterior 
planes, especially in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, (Figs. 7d,e, insets) which was consistent 
with the placement of the optical fiber. Enhanced tau pathology was accompanied by 
hippocampal cell layer atrophy (Fig. 7e) that was more evident in brain tissues stained using 
Nissl (Fig. 7f,h). Optogenetic stimulation using the same parameters did not result in 
detectible atrophy in mice without tauopathy (a MAPT−/− line (Figs. 7g,h) suggesting the 
stimulation itself was not causing the atrophy. To ensure that enhanced tauopathy was not 
due to enhanced expression of the transgene, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on both 
stimulated and non-stimulated hippocampal tissue from mice stimulated for 20 d. While 
there was variable human tau expression between mice, we did not detect differences in tau 
expression between hemispheres of rTg4510 mice (Supplementary Fig. 1).
To confirm our results using a different stimulation approach, in a different mouse line, we 
used the Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD)38

 chemogenetic approach to transiently stimulate neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of the 
EC-Tau mouse line2. The clozapine-n-oxide (CNO)-responsive DREADD (CaMKIIa-
hM3D(Gq)-mCherry) was expressed in the left EC and a receptor that was unresponsive to 
CNO (CaMKIIa-ChR-mCherry) was expressed in the right EC as a control. The DREADD 
was expressed in the MEC for at least 10 days before stimulation, and viral expression 
remained stable for at least 6 weeks (Fig. 8a). CNO administration enhanced neuronal 
activity in the MEC approximately 20 min post injection without causing seizures, as shown 
by in vivo electrophysiology (data not shown), and enhanced c-Fos labeling in the stimulated 
EC compared to the non-stimulated EC (Fig. 8b). After 6 weeks of CNO administration, we 
observed increased accumulation of somatodendritic tau (antibody MC1) in neurons in the 
stimulated EC as compared to the non-stimulated EC of the same mouse (Fig. 8c, outlined, 
arrows, insets, low laser power images). Stimulation for 2 weeks also showed enhanced 
tauopathy, but to a lesser degree (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Images taken using higher laser 
power demonstrated that the increase in somatodendritic tau was most evident in the EC 
region where DREADD virus was expressed whereas tau pathology in other regions (for 
example the granule cells of the dentate gyrus) did not show any obvious enhancement (Fig. 
8c). A similar enhancement of tau pathology was observed using a second human specific 
tau antibody, CP27 (Supplementary Fig. 3b, arrows). Non-specific staining was not observed 
when the secondary antibody was used in the absence of the primary antibody (data not 
shown).
Discussion
Using a variety of in vitro cell models, we have shown that 1) neuron-derived full-length tau 
can transfer to recipients and that aggregated tau induced by seeding transfers efficiently, 2) 
that neuron-derived tau can not only be internalized by recipient neurons, but it can undergo 
transcellular propagation to distant cells, and 3) that neuron-derived tau (including tau from 
human iPSCs) can transfer to recipients via the extracellular space. Several studies have 
shown internalization of exogenously-added tau8,9,12,39,40 into recipient cells, while more 
recent studies show that endogenously generated tau can also be internalized, including tau 
that was released into the extracellular space either in conditioned medium from mutant tau 
expressing SH-SY5Y cells41 or the ISF from rTg4510 mice23. In our study we found that 
non-mutant tau from wt mice and from non-mutant human iPSCs can also be released and 
internalized. Tau in these cells does not form overt, morphologically distinct aggregates even 
when cultured for long periods of time (over 20 days, data not shown), suggesting that the 
majority of tau released from these neurons is likely to be soluble which is consistent with a 
study that showed that soluble tau is released into the medium of cells22, the ISF of 
transgenic and wt mice18,23, and the ISF of an anti-aggregating mouse model42. Whether the 
soluble tau from wt neurons or iPSCs is monomeric or oligomeric is unknown. Exogenously 
added monomeric tau can be internalized41 but in our experience9, it does not accumulate to 
any degree. It is possible, especially for neurons from the rTg4510 line, that small, early 
stage misfolded tau oligomers have formed in the cultures that are not readily discernable by 
morphology, nor by dyes such as X-34 that recognize more aggregated beta-sheet structures 
and that these oligomers are released into the media and taken up by recipient neurons. What 
is clear from our seeding experiments however is that higher order aggregated forms of tau

 can accumulate in recipients more readily. A recent study23 has examined the uptake of tau 
from brain extract and has shown that a low abundance, higher molecular weight, 
phosphorylated form of tau is internalized and propagates. The same study showed that both 
high and low molecular weight tau is present in the ISF from rTg4510 mice, and while tau in 
the ISF was shown to be internalized by recipients, it is not known if it was the same type of 
tau that was internalized from the lysate. In our experience, tau released from cells making 
aggregates promotes propagation much more robustly than tau from neurons making soluble 
tau. Taking advantage of this, we have now shown that tau aggregates generated within one 
population of neurons can induce tau misfolding (X-34 positive aggregates) in a fluidically 
isolated, second- and third population of neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers.
The fact that tau can be transferred between cells via the media suggests that structures such 
as tunneling nanotubes are not required, at least not for in vitro transfer (in vivo transfer 
mechanisms are not known). We do not yet know whether tau in the media is vesicle bound 
or free. Exogenously added free (recombinant) tau12,39,43 including oligomers9 has been 
shown to be internalized by bulk endocytosis, and uptake can be mediated by binding to 
heparan sulfate proteoglycans43. Exogenously added tau in cell or brain extract can also be 
internalized by recipient cells8,44,45, but it is not known whether it is free or vesicle-bound in 
these preparations. A small proportion of tau released from cells (for example, into the ISF 
of wt tau overexpressing rodents17) has been identified in vesicles (ectosomes and to a lesser 
extent exosomes). Tau has only been found in ectosomes, and not exosomes when it is 
expressed at physiological levels17. Importantly, using wt neurons and iPSCs we have shown 
that tau release and internalization can occur without overexpressing tau. How internalized 
tau accesses endogenous tau to enable templating is currently unknown but the creation of 
more physiologically relevant models of tau release, internalization and propagation such as 
those described here will allow us to address these questions better. Taken together, our data 
show that endogenously produced tau aggregates are released and can induce subsequent 
misfolding and seed formation in downstream neurons, resulting in cell-to-cell propagation 
that could explain the widespread distribution of tau pathology in AD.
One of the observations from transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) is that elevated amyloid beta (Aβ) is somehow associated with hyperexcitability at the 
cellular level24–28. The observation that cellular hyperexcitability can stimulate the release 
of tau in vitro22 and in vivo23 suggests that in humans, Aβ-induced hyperexcitability within 
regions of the brain that are vulnerable to early tauopathy, such as the hippocampal 
formation, could lead to enhanced release of pathogenic tau and accelerated propagation of 
tauopathy through circuits. In support of this, we have shown that optogenetically stimulated 
tau mice undergo robust worsening of pathology (accumulation of cell body tau) in the 
stimulated hippocampus. Of note, the worsened pathology appears to be neurotoxic as it 
correlated with exacerbated hippocampal cell layer atrophy. The EC-tau mouse model, when 
stimulated chemogenetically, demonstrated worsening tauopathy in the stimulated entorhinal 
cortex. Additional pathology in cell populations that are synaptically connected with the EC 
such as the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was not obvious. However, in the EC-tau line, 
the accumulation of tau in the granule cell layer is a slow process, which takes more than 18 
months to become apparent2. In our experiments, the EC was stimulated for a maximum of 6 
weeks, starting at an age when pathology was mild. More time may be needed to effectively

 induce tau propagation into the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, or the mice may need to 
be at a more advanced stage when first stimulated for it to become apparent within the 
relatively short timeframe. In general, these data have several implications. Firstly, they may 
have relevance for AD where therapeutic approaches to dampen down excitability46–48 may 
retard the spread of tau pathology, which, if performed during the earliest Braak stages, 
could prevent the onset of cognitive decline. Second, these results may explain the 
observation of tauopathy associated with epileptic seizures, although the link between brain 
injury and tauopathy obscures the relationship49. Lastly, there may be negative implications 
for stimulation therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), or transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS) that are currently in clinical trials for AD patients.
Methods
Transgenic mice
Protocols and procedures were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal 
Experiments of Columbia University and according to Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Mouse models used in this study 
included: rTg4510 (CAMKII:hTau-P301L, embryonic day 15–16 for culture, 2–4 months for 
in vivo studies, parental lines were a gift of K. Hsiao22, MAPT−/− GFP (Tau-KO-GFP) 
(embryonic day 15–16, parental line was a gift of K. Tucker)30, Tau-KO (Jackson Labs), and 
EC-Tau (neuropsin-tTA, hTau-P301L line r4510, 12–14 months, parental lines were a gift of 
M. Mayford and K. Hsiao)2. Both male and female mice were used for each in vivo 
experiment. Strains of mice were C129/FVB F1 (rTg4510), C57blk6 (hTau, tau KO).
Neuronal culture
Primary neuronal cultures were prepared and maintained as previously described9. For co-
cultures, hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from male and female rTg4510 and 
Tau-KO-GFP mouse lines, plated into separate reservoirs of the MFs or together at 1:1 ratio 
on coverslips. For co-cultures of transduced neurons, male and female wild type rat primary 
neurons were plated in MFs and then transduced at 3–5 DIV with either mCherry (1:1000) 
or tau-GFP (hTau-P301L-GFP or GFP alone, 2 × 109 particles), or RD P301S YFP (1:10) 
vectors. Amounts of tau protein generated in cultured neurons was as follows: P301L GFP 
transduced neurons: 9.28 ± 0.675 ug mg (tau per total protein) (n = 3 cultures); rTg4510 
neurons: 7.84 ± 1.97 ug mg (tau per total protein) (n = 12 cultures); WT neurons: 2.81 
± 1.14 ug mg (tau total protein) (n = 12 cultures); iPSC neurons: 6.05 ± 1.07 ug mg (tau per 
total protein) (n = 12 cultures). For seeding experiment, 2.5 μg of clone 1, or clone 9 lysates 
prepared as previously described were added to neurons that were transduced with RD 
P301S YFP at DIV 6–8, and cultured for an additional 9–10 days.
Neural Induction
iPSC were differentiated into cortical neurons. Briefly, iPSC were converted to neural 
epithelium using the dual SMAD inhibitors dorsomorphin and SB431452, followed by an 
extended period of in vitro neurogenesis to generate cortical glutamatergic neurons. Neurons 
were maintained in 1:1 mixture of N-2 medium and B-27 medium33. Medium was changed

 every 48 h. Neuron-conditioned media were prepared by collecting media after 48 h, 
centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and stored at −80 °C.
Immunoprecipitation
Neurons were transduced with either tau-GFP or GFP (75,000 neurons/well, tau-P301L-
GFP, 2 × 109 particles, GFP, 2 × 109 particles). Media from wild-type (wt), GFP expressing, 
or tau expressing cells was collected every 3–4 days from mature neurons (tau or tau-GFP, 
14–21 DIV) and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. At the 
end of collection, cells were harvested in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase 
inhibitors (1 μg ml−1, Sigma). For immunoprecipitation of tau, magnetic anti-mouse protein 
A dynabeads (Life Technologies) were incubated with human tau-specific antibody (CP27, 
mouse) at a 2:1 ratio O/N, washed 3 times with 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with either 
conditioned media or cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were isolated using a magnetic stir 
bar and resuspended in loading buffer for western blot analysis.
Immunoblot
Immunoprecipitated samples were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot as previously 
described with the exception that membranes were probed with rabbit anti-tau (1:2000, 
Dako) and anti-actin (1:5000) antibodies. For human iPSC western blot, cells were harvested 
in buffer containing protease and phosphastase inhibitors (Roche). Equal amounts of protein 
were dephosphorylated using lambda protein phosphatase (NEB) prior to separation on 4–
12% NuPage gels (Invitrogen). Recombinant tau ladder (Sigma) was used to identify 
specific tau isoforms. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked 
with 3% milk in PBS before incubation with anti-tau antibody (total tau, DAKO) O/N at 
4 °C. Membranes were incubated with IRDye 800 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Rockland 
Inc) and proteins were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared imaging system (LiCor 
Biosciences). For western blot analysis of human iPSC neurons, cells were lysed in 10 mM 
Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 
0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, plus protease and phosphastase inhibitors (Roche) for 1h at 
4 °C. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE BisTris gels (NuPAGE Novex, 4–12%, 
Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were 
blocked in phosphate buffered saline containing 3% milk (PBS-M) for 1hr at RT. 
Membranes were incubated in primary antibody (DAKO polyclonal antibody to total tau, 
dilution 1:10,000) in PBS-M overnight at 4 °C. Blots were developed with IRDye 800 
conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Rockland Inc) or IRDye 680 conjugated goat anti-mouse 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and visualized using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging 
System (Li-Cor Biosciences). For analysis of tau isoforms, samples were dephosphorylated 
prior to electrophoresis using lambda protein phosphatase and separated by SDS-PAGE 
alongside a recombinant tau ladder (Sigma).
Tau ELISA
Mature tau-KO-GFP neurons were exposed to tau-conditioned media for 6 h, 12 h, 1 and 6 
days, washed 3× with warmed PBS, trypsinized for 2 min, collected and homogenized in 
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors at 4 °C. Protein concentration 
was determined by BCA Assay (Pierce) and normalized with 1 × PBS. Sandwich ELISA

 was performed as previously described using tau monoclonal antibodies DA31 and DA9-
HRP50.
Viral vectors
Tau RD-P301S YFP (aa 244–372 of the 441 full length tau, mutations P301S “PS”), YFP, 
mCherry viruses were prepared by transient co-transfection of HEK293T cells with 
indicated vectors using calcium phosphate method. Media containing virus was collected at 
48 h post transfection and purified using Lenti-X-Concentrator according to manufacturer’s 
protocol (Clontech). Wild type and P301L 4R2N tau constructs were cloned into an eGFP-
AAV1 vector (chicken beta-actin promoter), and all sequences were verified. AAV was 
subsequently produced and the genomic titer of each virus was determined by quantitative 
PCR.
RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from 5–10mg hippocampal tissue from three, 7 month old mice 
(rTg4510 line, male and female) that were optogenetically stimulated for 20 days as describe 
before, plus three 2–3 month old animals, stimulated for five days, using a standard trizol 
procedure. SuperScript® III RT enzyme and SuperMix (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA) 
containing 2.5 μM oligo(dT)20, 2.5 ng μl−1, random hexamers, 10 nM MgCl2 and dNTPs, 
was used for first strand cDNA synthesis in a 20 μL reaction volume. Gene expression was 
assessed using TaqMan® probes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for the human 
tau transgene (Hs00902194_m1), mouse NeuN (Rbfox3) (Mm01248771_m1) and the mouse 
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (Hprt) (Mm03024075). PCRs were 
performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the FAM and VIC 
fluorophores, using an iQ5 detector system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All samples were run 
in triplicate 20 μL duplexed PCR reactions using 1 μL each of FAM and VIC labeled 
TaqMan® probes, 10 μL of TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA), and 8 μL of diluted cDNA (1:40), using amplification conditions as 
follows: 50 °C for 2 mins, followed by 95 °C for 10 mins and 40 cycles of denaturation at 
95 °C (15 s), and priming, extension and data capture 60 °C (60 s). A standard curve was 
generated for each gene using dilutions of cDNA pooled from each sample. Relative 
expression changes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), 
defined as the ΔCT of the sample normalized to the housekeeping gene Hprt, minus the ΔCT 
of the normalized reference sample from the standard curve.
In vitro stimulation and cell viability assessment
To induce activity, neurons at 12–14 DIV were treated with picrotoxin (100 μM) for 30 min 
without changing the medium. For optogenetic stimulation, neurons were transduced with 
tau (tau-P301L-GFP, 2 × 109 particles) and ChR2 (AAV9.CaMKIIa.hChR2(H134R)-
mCherry.WPRE.hGH; Penn Vector Core, 3.98 × 1011 particles) at 3–5 DIV. After 9–12 DIV, 
control wild type or transduced neuronal cultures were placed on an upright microscope 
(Olympus) and stimulated with blue light (470 nm) at 0.1 mW mm−2 (40 mA) for 30 min at 
2 sec intervals. The emission power was measured using a power meter (ThorLabs) that is 
placed directly below, and at the same distance from the objective lens as the cultures. The 
chamber temperature was maintained at 32 °C ± 2 °C. Media was collected before and after

 stimulation, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and analyzed by Sandwich ELISA using tau 
monoclonal antibodies DA31 and DA9-HRP50 in duplicates. Cell death was quantified by 
measuring LDH release in the same neuronal populations prior to, and after treatments, 
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Each experiment was performed three 
times in triplicates (n = 6).
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings
Mature neuronal cultures (DIV 12–14) were placed on the recording chamber (Warner 
Instruments) of an upright microscope equipped with a 10 × and a 40 × oil-immersion 
objectives (Olympus). Control and transduced neurons were identified by DIC optics and 
fluorescences, respectively. Cells were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) 
containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 2.4 CaCl2, 3.6 KCl, 1.2 
MgCl2-6H20, and 1.0 NaH2PO4-6H20 at < 0.5 ml min−1 flow rate. The chamber temperature 
was maintained at 32 °C ± 2 °C. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made with pulled 
borosilicate glass pipettes (G150F-4, Warner Instruments, tip resistance 2–4 MΩ) filled with 
intracellular solution containing (in mM): 115 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 2 
ATP-Mg, 2 ATP-Na2, 0.3 GTP-Na, (pH=7.25, ~300 mOsm). Whole cell current clamp 
recording were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and 
digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1332 (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired using 
Clampex 8.2 software (Molecular Devices) for subsequent analysis. Blue light (470 nm) or 
control red light (545 ± 30 nm) were delivered by an LED controller (Thorlabs, 40 mA) and 
triggered with a Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I. Labs). Synaptic inputs were blocked 
with picrotoxin (50 μM) and NBQX (20 μM) (Sigma Aldrich). The input resistance and the 
baseline resting membrane potential were monitored throughout the recording. Current-
voltage relationships were measured by injecting step current from −300 to + 150 pA with 
+ 50 pA increments. Data were analyzed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices).
Surgery
Surgical procedures were performed following NIH guidelines in accordance with IACUC 
protocols. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg ml−1, 15 mg ml−1, 
respectively). AAV5 CamKII.hM3Dq-mCherry (1.7 × 1012 particles) and AAV9/
CamKIIa.hChR2-mCherry (2 × 1012 particles) virus was injected into the MEC (0.2–0.3 mm 
in front of the transverse sinus (AP), 3.0–3.1 mm (ML), and 1.5 mm below the dura (DV), 
line rTg4510) of the left, or right hemisphere of the mice respectively. For in vivo 
optogenetic experiments, AAV9/CamKIIa.hChR2-mCherry (2 × 1012 particles) virus was 
injected into the hippocampus (1.5 mm (DV), 1.8 mm (ML), 1.8 mm (AP)) of both the left 
and right hemispheres of the mice (line rTg4510). A 20 mm cannula was implanted slightly 
above the injection site (~1.2 mm) in both brain hemispheres. For one mouse, a microdrive 
was implanted in the left hemisphere (~1.2 mm depth) to record neuronal activity. Dental 
cement was used to secure the cannulae and microdrive.
In vivo chemogenetic stimulation and electrophysiology
Ten days following viral DREADD transduction, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) was given to 
mice systemically via intraperitoneal injections at 5 mg kg−1, two times per day (6 – 7 hrs in 
between injections), five days per week for either two or six weeks. Total stimulation was

 either 20 or 60 times. IP injections were alternated between left and right sides of the mouse 
to minimize scarring. CNO (C-929) was generously provided by the National Institutes of 
Mental Health Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program. Both male and female mice 
were used.
In vivo optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiology
Ten days following ChR2 viral transduction, the left hemisphere of mice was optically 
stimulated with four pulses of LED light (470 nm) (Thorlabs) at 30 Hz frequency, three 
times with one -minute interval. Mice were stimulated three times per day, five times per 
week for four weeks (60 stimulations total). The right hemisphere was not stimulated to 
provide a within-animal control. To record neuronal activity, the mouse implanted with 
electrodes was plugged into the electrophysiology setup (Axona) during stimulation and 
neuronal activity was recorded. Individual neurons from the recording data were separated 
using the spike sorting software Tint (Axona). Neurons were identified based on spike- 
firing rate, amplitude, waveform and their refractory periods. sigTOOL (a Matlab-based 
signal analysis tool) was used to visualize changes in neuronal firing during optical 
stimulation. Both male and female mice were used.
Immunofluorescence, Nissl and DAB staining
Mouse brains were collected as described previously. Free-floating sections in either coronal 
or horizontal plane (35 μm) were used for immunofluorescence. Human iPSC neurons were 
grown in 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi) and primary neurons were grown as previously 
described. Neurons and free-floating tissues were immunolabeled and mounted as 
previously described with the following antibodies: mouse anti-tau (CP27, 1:1000, MC1, 
1:2000, (gifts of P. Davies)), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, abcam), total Tau (DAKO, 1:5000), 3R 
tau (RD3, Millipore, 1:1000), Pax6 (Covance, 1:300), Ki67 (BD Biosciences, 1:500). 
Fluorescent-conjugated secondary antisera mixtures containing Alexa 488 IgG, Alexa 594 
IgG, or Alexa 657 IgG (Invitrogen) were used. Antigen retrieval was performed on tissues 
by heating in sodium citrate for 5 min at 95 °C. Tissues were treated with sudan black (0.1% 
in PBS) for 10 – 15 min to eliminate autofluorescence from lipofuscin. For Nissl staining, 
sections were stained with 0.1% cresyl violet in 70% EtOH for 10 min at RT, rinsed with 
distilled H20, washed three times with PBS and mounted with Prolong anti-fade medium 
(Invitrogen). DAB staining on tissues was performed as previously described2. Briefly, 
tissues were treated with 5% H2O2 in PBS for 10 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase 
activity, blocked in PBS containing 5% horse serum and 0.3% Triton, and incubated at 4 °C 
overnight as previously described2 with the following antibodies: c-Fos (1:200, Santa Cruz, 
G3115), AT8 (S202/205, 1:1000, ThermoFisher, MN1020), MC1 (conformationally 
abnormal human tau, 1:1000). After three washes with PBS-T, tissues were developed using 
Super Picture HRP (Invitrogen) for 15 mins at room temperature on a rotator and detection 
of the chromagen with DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) was done according to the manufacturer’s 
manual. In the case of c-Fos staining, mice were sacrificed 75 minutes after their last CNO 
injection. ABC kit (Vectastain, Vector Labs) was used to develop the tissues according to the 
manufacturers manual. The sections were mounted, and visualized by light microscopy.

 Confocal and light microscopy
Immunolabeled neurons and tissues were examined with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal 
microscope at 10× dry and 63× oil immersion objectives as previously described. Sequential 
tile scans were performed to capture wide field images of microfluidics (at 1024 × 1024 
resolution) and tissues (512 × 512). Sequential scans were performed to capture images of 
cells grown on coverslips (1024 × 1024). All images from the same experiment were taken 
at the same laser intensity and detector gain. 3D co-localization analysis was performed 
using Volocity 4.0 Restoration software (Volocity, Improvision). All DAB sections were 
examined with a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 inverted microscope at 10×. Sequential tile scans 
were performed to capture wide field images of the whole section at 10×. 
Immunofluorescent images of co-culture experiments were captured at 20× magnification, 
10 images per coverslip at either 512 × 512 resolution or 1024 × 1024 resolution, 
randomized and quantified by a technician who did not know the identity of the samples (n = 
2 coverslips, 10 images per coverslip).
Statistical analyses and sample sizes
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (Graph Pad Software, La 
Jolla, CA, USA) and Stata 12.1 (College Station, TX). No statistical methods were used to 
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those previously reported22. 
Normality of the data and homogeneity of group variances were assessed using the Shapiro-
Wilk W test and Levine’s test respectively. When assumptions were not met or sample sizes 
were insufficient to test assumptions, non-parametric tests were employed. Adjustments 
were made for multiple testing under each hypothesis, via Bonferroni correction. Statistical 
significance was determined if adjusted p < 0.05. Data are represented in dot plot graphs 
with mean ± s.e.m. To investigate tau uptake into recipient neurons via the extracellular 
media we measured tau levels in neurons from MAPT −/− (knock out) mice at baseline (no 
incubation, n = 4 coverslips), 1 – 6 hours after the conditioned media was added (n = 6 
independent coverslips), and 1 – 6 days after addition of conditioned media (n = 4 
independent coverslips). A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to test for differences in 
the levels of tau, comparing tau levels at baseline levels with levels at 6 hours or less, and tau 
at baseline with levels at 1 – 6 days. To examine whether tau release is enhanced following 
neural activity in vitro, primary neurons were stimulated with picrotoxin. Levels of mouse 
tau in wt neurons (mTau) (n = 9 separate coverslips), mouse tau plus human tau in rTg4510 
neurons (mTau+ hTau) (n = 9 separate coverslips) and human tau in iPSC cultures (hTau) (n 
= 6 separate coverslips) was assessed. For each model, additional and independent cultures 
(mTau n = 9; mtau + hTau n = 9; hTau n = 6) were utilized as the non-stimulated control 
group. Experiments were performed over two days, with 50% of the independent samples 
assessed on each experimental day. Samples were analyzed as a single group (regardless of 
experimental day), using individual Student t-tests (with Satterthwaite’s approximation for 
unequal group variance) to determine differences between control and picrotoxin treatment 
in the three models. In vitro optogenetic stimulation was performed using four separate 
cultures for each of three experimental conditions: control, non-stimulated ChR and 
simulated ChR. Differences in tau release across conditions was tested using a Kruskal-
Wallis omnibus test, followed by Dunn’s post hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction. To test 
the hypothesis that transfer of tau is enhanced by stimulating neuronal activity, the percent

 of recipient neurons with human tau from the donor was calculated (the number of cells 
expressing mCherry that were YFP positive/total mCherry positive cells × 100%). For each 
condition (stimulated and non-stimulated), neurons were plated on n = 5 independent 
coverslips. To obtain an accurate representation of neurons across each coverslip, multiple 
images were used for cell counting. The percent of total neurons with tau transferred from 
the donor were compared between stimulated and non-stimulated conditions using a 
Student’s t-test. Gene expression (Supplementary Figure 1) was compared between the 
optogenetically stimulated side of the hippocampus (S, n = 6 animals) and the non-
stimulated sides (NS, n = 6 animals), using a paired sample t-test. To test the hypothesis that 
atrophy due to stimulation would be significantly different in the tau mice (n = 4), as 
compared to tau-KO mice (n = 4), left and right cell body layers in the hippocampus were 
measured in Nissl-stained sections using ImageJ. Nissl signal above threshold levels were 
compared between the regions of interest on each side of the brain slice. The threshold value 
was kept the same between slices, within an animal. The value for the left, stimulated 
hippocampus was divided by the right, non-stimulated hippocampus to obtain a ratio of left 
divided by right signal in each slice. Ratios of all slices from each animal were averaged. A 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compare the ratio of left/right staining across 
mouse groups. The Wilcoxon-rank test statistic would be expected to approximate to the 
normal distribution with this sample size. In figures, calculated probabilities are symbolized 
by asterisks as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.0; *** P < 0.001. Optogenetic stimulation and 
immunoflorescent image analysis was performed by a blinded observer. Other blinded 
authors analyzed DAB and immunofluorescent stains of brain tissues (non-stimulated 
hemisphere versus stimulated hemisphere). Statistical analysis was not performed blinded to 
the experimental conditions. For optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments, mice of the 
appropriate age were selected from several different litters and randomly assigned as control 
or experimental. No other randomization in experimental conditions or stimulus 
presentations was performed.

Tau from mouse primary neurons and human iPSCs can transfer via the extracellular 
medium (a) Lysate from rTg4510 primary neurons and P301L-GFP transduced neurons, and 
conditioned media from the same cells, labeled with TauC (full-length blots shown in 
Supplementary Figure 4). Actin shows equal amounts of protein loaded. (Full-length blots 
shown in Supplementary Figure 4.) (b) ELISA using tau-specific antibodies showing uptake 
of tau from media by tau-KO cells. Compared to controls (n = 4 cultures), tau was 
significantly higher in neurons after 1–6 hours of incubation with tau-conditioned media (n 
= 6, z = −2.558, adjusted P = 0.021) (left), and also after 1–6 days of incubation (n = 4, z = 
−2.309, adjusted P = 0.042). (c) Neurons (wild-type), incubated with rTg4510 conditioned 
media for 2 and 6 days (d), labeled with anti-tau antibody (green) and anti-MAP2 (red). 
Insets show tau in cell bodies and neurites. (d) Total tau in human iPSC neuron lysates. 
Recombinant tau ladder (R) separates in the following order of decreasing molecular weight: 
2N4R, 2N3R, 1N4R, 1N3R, 0N4R, 0N3R. The single tau band corresponds to the 0N3R 
isoform. (e) iPSC cultures immunolabeled with the early forebrain marker Pax6 and tau, 
which was only expressed in post-mitotic neurons. By day 100 of differentiation, the

Tau release is enhanced by stimulating neuronal activity. (a) Sandwich ELISA showed that 
tau is released into the media from cultured cells (mTau, n = 9 cultures per treatment group; 
hTau + mTau, n = 9 cultures per treatment group; hTau, human and iPSC neurons, n = 6 
cultures per treatment group), when treated with picrotoxin for 30 min. Raw data was 
normalized to baseline levels for each cell population, and plotted as the percent change. A 
significant difference was observed between treated and untreated groups for each model: 
mTau t(9.167) = −4.75, Bonferroni adjusted P =0.003; hTau + mTau t(16) = −7.25, adjusted 
P < 0.0001; hTau t(10) = −2.95, adjusted P = 0.044. (b) No significant difference was 
observed between treated and untreated groups in LDH release. Group n’s were as above. P 
values from adjusted t-tests = 0.73, 0.061, and 0.233. (c) Transduced neurons co-express 
both tau (green) and ChR2 (red). (d) Tau and ChR2-expressing neuron was patch-recorded 
and (e) exhibited ~5 mV depolarization of membrane potential (RMP) with light stimulation 
at 30 Hz. (f) Light at 470 nm, but not 570 nm caused a 12mV depolarization in ChR2-cells.

condition) (Kruskal-Wallis χ2(2) = 7.42, P = 0.024) with significantly higher tau in

Increased neuronal activity induced optogenetically exacerbates tau pathology in the 
hippocampus. (a) In vivo optogenetic stimulation: Cartoon shows the experimental setup. 
Tau expressing mice (rTg4510) were injected with ChR2 expressing vector and implanted 
with optical fibers in both hemispheres; in some mice a recording electrode was also inserted 
in one or both hemispheres. (b) Extracellular recordings show that pulses of blue light (blue 
bars) increased the firing activity consistently. The same neurons could be recorded 
longitudinally demonstrating that chronic, repetitive stimulation did not impact cell viability.
