Summary
Awake fibreoptic intubation is often considered the technique of choice when a difficult airway is antici-
pated. However, videolaryngoscopes are being used more commonly. We searched the current literature
and performed a meta-analysis to compare the use of videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy for
awake tracheal intubation. Our primary outcome was the time needed to intubate the patient’s trachea.
Secondary outcomes included: failed intubation; the rate of successful intubation at the first attempt;
patient-reported satisfaction with the technique; and any complications resulting from intubation. Eight
studies examining 429 patients were included in this review. The intubation time was shorter when video-
laryngoscopy was used instead of fibreoptic bronchoscopy (seven trials, 408 participants, mean difference
(95%CI) �45.7 (�66.0 to �25.4) s, p < 0.0001, low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference
between the two techniques in the failure rate (six studies, 355 participants, risk ratio (95%CI) 1.01 (0.24–
4.35), p = 0.99, low-quality evidence) or the first-attempt success rate (six studies, 391 participants, risk
ratio (95%CI) 1.01 (0.95–1.06), p = 0.8, moderate quality evidence). The level of patient satisfaction was
similar between both groups. No difference was found in two reported adverse events: hoarseness/sore
throat (three studies, 167 participants, risk ratio (95%CI) 1.07 (0.62–1.85), p = 0.81, low-quality evidence),
and low oxygen saturation (five studies, 337 participants, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.49 (0.22–1.12), p = 0.09,
low-quality evidence). In summary, videolaryngoscopy for awake tracheal intubation is associated with a
shorter intubation time. It also seems to have a success rate and safety profile comparable to fibreoptic
bronchoscopy.

Introduction
Awake fibreoptic intubation is widely advocated for the
management of the known or anticipated difficult airway
[1]. However, fibreoptic intubation can be a challenging
technique to learn, and continuous practice is needed to
maintain the skill [2]. Additionally, there are risks associ-
ated with this procedure, including nasal bleeding, over-
sedation, airway hyper-reactivity and complete airway
obstruction [3–5]. The technique also requires adequate
equipment and patient preparation and usually takes a

 considerable amount of time to be performed. All these
factors have led to the underuse of fibreoptic intubation
by many anaesthetists.
In a recent prospective study, awake fibreoptic intuba-
tion was performed in 1.71% of patients presenting for
surgery under general anaesthesia [6]. The success rate
reported was 99%, and the overall complication rate was
11%. In addition, this study demonstrated a significant
negative correlation between the number of previous
awake fibreoptic intubations performed by the anaes-
thetist and the incidence of complications. This underlines
how continued training in awake fibreoptic intubation is
essential to maintaining the safety of this technique.
Videolaryngoscopes, on the other hand, are increas-
ing in popularity and are slowly becoming the preferred
tool for the management of the difficult airway. They seem
to be easier to use and quicker to learn. Heidegger et al.
described that anaesthetists need around 25 intubations
to be competent with fibreoptic intubation [3], whereas
only one to six intubations are needed to reach the same
level of competence with videolaryngoscopy [7, 8].
There are some potential advantages of videolaryngo-
scopes over fibreoptic bronchoscopes. First, they provide a
wider view of the airway, which results in a better view of
nearby structures [9]. Second, there is no limitation on the
tracheal tube diameter which may be used, in contrast to
fibreoptic bronchoscopes, when smaller size tracheal tubes
cannot be used. Finally, it is easier to change the size of the
tracheal tube if required while maintaining the airway view.
This differs from the fibreoptic technique, which requires
the removal of the fibrescope from the patient’s airway in
order to make this change.
However, the use of videolaryngoscopes for awake
intubation is a relatively new technique. It is unclear
whether they truly provide advantages over fibreoptic
intubation. With the aim of summarising the available lit-
erature, we conducted this systematic review and meta-
analysis to compare videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic
bronchoscopy for awake intubation.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted
in
accordance
with
the
PRISMA
guidelines
[10].
All
authors agreed on the study protocol before commenc-
ing the review.
We carried out a search until June 2017 in the
following
electronic
databases:
the
Cochrane
Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; and
Embase. The details of our search strategy can be found in
the Supporting Information (Appendix S1). The reference
lists of all eligible papers were hand-searched for addi-
tional potential studies. We did not restrict our search by
language of publication. We dealt with incomplete data by
contacting the principal authors, when possible, to ask for
missing or unclear information.
Two reviewers (MA and EC or ER) independently
screened the articles by title and abstract according to
the predetermined inclusion criteria and excluded any
irrelevant or duplicate studies. Two authors then exam-
ined the full texts of all potential trials to further assess
their eligibility for inclusion in this review. Any disagree-
ment between the authors was resolved by discussion or
by consulting a fourth author (SW) to make a final deci-
sion if consensus was not achieved.
We included only randomised controlled trials com-
paring videolaryngoscopy with fibreoptic bronchoscopy
in
patients
requiring
awake
tracheal
intubation.
We
excluded case reports, observational studies and cross-
over trials. Mannikin studies were not considered in this
review, and we only accepted trials if they reported intu-
bation time as one of their outcomes. Studies were
included if they compared the use of videolaryngoscopes
of any model with the use of fibreoptic flexible broncho-
scopes. Participants were patients of any age and sex
who needed awake tracheal intubation either via the
nasal or oral route, regardless of the indication and the
surgical procedure.
Our primary outcome was the time needed to intu-
bate the trachea. Our secondary outcomes were: failed
intubation; the rate of successful intubation at the first
attempts; patient-reported satisfaction; and any complica-
tions or adverse events resulting from intubation.
The potential risk of bias in each included study was
assessed independently by two authors (MA and EC or
ER). We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool [11] to
evaluate the quality of each study design, considering the
following possible sources of bias: random sequence
generation; allocation concealment; blinding of partici-
pants, personnel and outcome assessors; incomplete out-
come data; and selective outcome reporting. We also
assessed the risk of bias that can result from the level of
experience of the anaesthetist with the device used for
tracheal intubation, as we felt this could be an important
confounding factor.
We used Review Manager (RevMan 5.3; Copenhagen:
The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collabora-
tion, 2014) for data analysis. For dichotomous outcomes
(e.g. failure rate, first-attempt success), we calculated risk
ratios (RR) with 95%CI, and for continuous outcomes (e.g.
intubation time), we used the mean difference (MD).

 When the continuous outcome was reported in some
studies as median, range and interquartile range, we esti-
mated means and standard deviations using the formula
described by Hozo [12].
Risk ratios were calculated with the Mantel–Haenszel
method using the random-effects model as we expected
clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the
studies. We evaluated the heterogeneity by using the I2
statistic, with I2 levels of 25%, 50% and 75% implying low,
moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively.
We carried out sub-group analyses for the route of intuba-
tion and the design of videolaryngoscope to investigate
the causes of significant heterogeneity. In addition, we
undertook a post-hoc sensitivity analysis by omitting cer-
tain studies from the data synthesis to further explore the
robustness of our results.
Visual inspection of funnel plots is often used to
assess for publication bias, as evidence of this can be
indicated by the presence of asymmetry in the scatter
plot. However, publication bias is only one reason for
funnel plot asymmetry, and other factors can contribute
to this asymmetry [13]. When funnel plot asymmetry
exists, this should further be determined using statistically
relevant analyses [14]. We intended to investigate publi-
cation bias using the funnel plot technique, with Egger’s
regression when appropriate.
Finally, we applied the Grades of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) sys-
tem [15] using GRADEpro software (https://gradepro.org)
to rate the quality of evidence for each of our primary
and secondary outcomes, taking into account risk of bias,
inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness [16].
Results
In our initial electronic search, we identified 239 potential
articles. No additional studies were detected through
manual
scrutiny
of
reference
lists
of
studies.
After
removal of duplicates, we screened 165 articles by title
and abstract for eligibility. From these studies, we only
included nine trials for full-text evaluation. We excluded
one additional article due to irrelevant methodology
(Fig. 1) [17].
Eight studies were eventually included in our review
[18–25]. We excluded one study from the meta-analysis
due to incomplete data reporting [23]. Table 1 presents
the characteristics of included studies, and Table S1 sum-
marises the baseline characteristics of participants.
A total number of 429 participants were included in
the eight studies. All participants were adult patients with
ASA physical status 1–3. None of the studies investigated
patients who required emergency intubations. Two stud-
ies included only obese patients scheduled for bariatric
surgery [18, 23]. All intubations were performed in oper-
ating theatres by anaesthetists with variable expertise in
both videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic techniques.
Five
different
types
of
videolaryngoscopes
were
used: GlideScope™ in four studies [18, 21, 23, 25]; Bul-
lard™ laryngoscope [19]; McGrath series 5™ [24]; C-MAC
D-blade™ [20] and Pentax AWS™ [22] (each in one study).
Two types of fibreoptic bronchoscopes were used; the
Karl Storz fibrescope in two studies [20, 21] and the
Olympus fibrescope in four studies [18, 19, 22, 25]. Two
studies did not specify the type of fibreoptic broncho-
scope used [23, 24]. In most of the included studies, intu-
bations were performed via the oral route. Only in two
studies was the nasal route used for intubation [20, 21].
According to our assessment, the majority of the
studies had a low risk of selection, attrition and selective
reporting biases. Blinding of participants, personnel and
outcome assessors was not possible due to the nature of
the intervention. Most of the studies reported in detail
the number of previous intubations performed with each
device, so we rated these studies as being at low risk of
bias. The anaesthetists studied by Cohn et al. [19] had
performed at least 10 previous intubations with video-
laryngoscopy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy; we felt that
this number would favour the videolaryngoscopy group.
A summary of the risk of bias for each included study is
shown in Figure 2. Publication bias was not assessed
because the number of included studies was insufficient
to explore a funnel plot or use more advanced regres-
sion-based assessments appropriately.
All studies reported intubation times. However, one
study reported only the adjusted difference in mean time
for intubation between the two groups with no further
details [23], and for this reason, we could not include this
study in the meta-analysis. Our analysis of the remaining
seven studies showed that videolaryngoscopy resulted in
a shorter intubation time compared with fibreoptic bron-
choscopy
(Fig. 3).
However,
we
detected
a
marked
degree of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 94%).
This significant heterogeneity did not improve when we
performed sub-group analyses by the type of videolaryn-
goscope used or the route of tracheal intubation. We
were able only to combine the trials that used the
GlideScope, as each of the remaining studies investi-
gated a different videolaryngoscope design. To further
explore potential causes of this high heterogeneity, we
performed a sensitivity analysis by omitting two studies
from our pooled data synthesis [22, 25]. The results of

Six studies [18–20, 22, 24, 25], with a total number of
355 patients, provided details about the number of failed
intubations. All the studies defined failed intubation as the
inability to intubate the trachea using the initially allocated
technique. Analysis of data from these studies (Fig. 4)
demonstrated no significant difference in the number of
failed intubations between the groups. Similarly, analysis
of the six studies (391 participants) that reported on the
number of successful intubations on the first attempt [18,
20, 21, 24, 25] showed no difference between the groups
(Fig. 5).
Patient satisfaction was described in five studies.
Abdellatif et al. [18] reported that 58% of participants
rated their experience as excellent in the videolaryn-
goscopy group, compared with 59% in the fibreoptic
group (p = 0.92). Likewise, Wahba et al. [25] found that
72% and 64% of patients described the procedure as
excellent in the videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic bron-
choscopy groups, respectively (p > 0.05). In the study by
Mendonca et al. [22], the median visual analogue scale
(VAS) for patient comfort was 79 [range 59–100] in the

 videolaryngoscopy group compared with 86 [range 69–
100] in the fibreoptic bronchoscopy group (p = 0.0616).
Rosenstock et al. [24] reported an equal level of patient
discomfort during the procedure in both groups, with a
median [range] VAS of 2 [0–10] for the videolaryn-
goscopy group and 2 [0–6] for the fibreoptic bron-
choscopy group (p = 0.55). Moore et al. [23] stated that
no difference was found between the groups, but no fur-
ther information was available. It was not possible to
combine the data of patient satisfaction by meta-analysis
due to the variability in the scoring methods used to
examine this outcome.
Three studies reported on hoarseness and/or sore
throat (Fig. 6) [18, 21, 25]. Two studies described an equal
incidence of minor nasopharyngeal bleeding in the video-
laryngoscopy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy groups [20,
24]. Peripheral oxygen saturation of less than 90% was
described in five studies [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] with no signifi-
cant difference in incidence between the two groups. The
pooled RR was 0.45, 95%CI 0.22–1.12 (Fig. 7).
Due to study limitations, inconsistency and the small
number of participants, we found the quality of evidence
in relation to our main outcomes to be of low quality.
See Table S2 in the Supporting Information for more
details.
Discussion
This systematic review was designed to investigate the
efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared with
fibreoptic bronchoscopy for awake tracheal intubation.
The intubation time was our primary outcome inves-
tigated; the pooled data analysis demonstrated that the
use of videolaryngoscopy is probably associated with a
shorter intubation time compared with fibreoptic bron-
choscopy. However, a high degree of heterogeneity was
detected between the studies. Sub-group analysis by the
type of videolaryngoscope or the route of intubation did
not explain this heterogeneity. We found no significant
difference between the two techniques with regard to
our
secondary
outcomes
of
failed
intubation,
first-
attempt success rate, patient satisfaction or complica-
tions related to intubation.
Several possible factors may explain the high level of
heterogeneity
detected.
First,
although
all
studies
recruited participants with known or predicted difficult
airway, the criteria used to assess this varied considerably
in different studies. For example, Cohn et al. and Wahba
et al. included patients with cervical spine disease and
traumatic cervical spine injury, respectively (which indi-
cates a requirement to maintain neutral cervical spine
position during intubation) [19, 25]. This is in contrast to
the more robust criterion (simplified airway risk index)
used by Abdellatif et al., Moore et al. and Rosenstock
et al. [18, 23, 24], which takes into consideration multiple
factors such as mouth opening, neck movement, weight,
thyromental distance and a previous history of difficulty
in intubation. Second, our review included patients of dif-
ferent
populations
in
different
clinical
settings,
from
obese patients for bariatric surgery to patients with
oropharyngeal cancer requiring maxillofacial procedures.
However, this diversity of types of patient potentially con-
tributes to the generalisability of the results. Finally, the

about each risk of bias item for each included study.
Green, red and yellow circles indicate low, high and

 definition of intubation time was different between stud-
ies and various points of time were used to assess this
outcome.
In our sensitivity analysis, we omitted the study by
Wahba et al. as they did not include patients
with
apparent airway difficulty in their research [25]. Although
cervical spine immobility can make intubation more chal-
lenging, it has been shown that videolaryngoscopes are
associated with less cervical spine movement [26–28].
These participants may have had relatively easier airways

 and this may have accounted for the shorter intubation
times found in this study. We also removed the trial by
Mendonca et al. due to different methodology [22]. The
authors described a ‘spray as you go’ technique for
providing topical anaesthesia to the airway. This may
explain why intubation times noted in this trial were
significantly longer than those in the remaining studies.
Furthermore, their sample size was not calculated to
detect a difference in intubation time, as their primary
outcome was the total procedure time (sedation time
and
intubation
time).
The
degree
of
inconsistency
improved
following
this
sensitivity
analysis
and
the
results demonstrated an effect estimate comparable to
our primary analysis. However, as this was a post-hoc
analysis, we did not consider these findings in our
assessment of the quality of evidence.
A major limitation of our study is that we carried out
a meta-analysis on an outcome with high heterogeneity
(intubation time). We believe that this heterogeneity may
have resulted from the different methodologies and clini-
cal factors within the studies, but we acknowledged this
limitation, and we downgraded the quality of the evi-
dence accordingly. Another limiting factor is the variation
in the types of videolaryngoscope used in different stud-
ies and our inability to perform sufficient sub-group anal-
ysis. The GlideScope was the only scope used in more
than one trial; the remaining studies used different mod-
els of videolaryngoscope. This probably contributed to
the substantial heterogeneity between the studies, but
similarly, added to the generalisability of our results, as
various institutions and practitioners will choose to use
different types of videolaryngoscope in their routine prac-
tice.
Intubation times, particularly when they are short,
may not be of clinical importance. However, if intubation
time is prolonged due to patient factors or the anaes-
thetist’s level of experience, a further increase in time can
be critical, especially in anxious patients with respiratory
compromise and who are at increased risk of loss of air-
way patency. Furthermore, intubation time may also pro-

although this is debatable. Finally, we can argue that
decreasing intubation time in awake, albeit sedated,
patients may be associated with less patient discomfort,
as it shortens the duration of a potentially stressful
procedure.
Patient satisfaction is an important outcome because
awake intubation can be uncomfortable and requires an
adequate level of sedation and topical anaesthesia to be
tolerated. However, patient satisfaction can be difficult to
define and is often influenced by cultural, social and cog-
nitive factors [29]. Examples of attributes of care that

 have been shown to improve patient satisfaction include
shared decision making, effective communication, infor-
mation and respect [30, 31]. Although a significant differ-
ence in patient satisfaction was not found between the
videolaryngoscopy
and
the
fibreoptic
bronchoscopy
groups, these results should be interpreted with caution
for two possible reasons. First, these studies were not
powered to detect a difference in patient satisfaction
between the two groups. Second, the awake intubation
described in these trials involved the use of various seda-
tive agents to facilitate the procedure; this can affect the
ability of patients to recall the procedure and to measure
this outcome reliably.
Our assessment demonstrated a low risk of bias in
most domains among the majority of the included stud-
ies. However, the blinding of intubators and outcome
assessors was not possible, and this could be an area of
concern regarding our results. Another factor was the
experience of the anaesthetist who performed the intuba-
tion. As most of the trials clearly quantified the previous
experience of the intubators with each device, we believe
this potential source of bias did not affect the quality of
evidence from this review.
Most studies in our review did not include patients
with limited mouth opening due to the potential difficulty
in inserting the videolaryngoscope blade into the airway
in these patients [32, 33]. This makes applying the results
of our review to this group of patients more difficult,
although fibreoptic bronchoscopy might be more appro-
priate in this setting. In addition, all intubations were per-
formed
in
elective
patients,
and
this
precludes
the
generalisability of the results to emergency intubations
when anaesthetists and patients can be under psycholog-
ical and time pressures.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
to provide data on the use of videolaryngoscopy for
awake tracheal intubation. We did not find previous simi-
lar reports that we can compare for agreement and dis-
agreement with our results. It highlights the value of
videolaryngoscopy as an alternative to awake fibreoptic
intubation in carefully selected patients. Videolaryngo-
scopes appear to be safe for awake intubation, and can
achieve overall and first-attempt success rates compara-
ble to fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Furthermore, there is
lower quality evidence that the use of videolaryngo-
scopes can result in faster tracheal intubations. Future
research should focus on evaluating awake videolaryn-
goscopy
in
non-elective
environments
and
explore
patient
satisfaction
with
awake
videolaryngoscopy
in
more detail.
