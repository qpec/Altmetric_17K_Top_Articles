Successful pathogens use complex signaling mechanisms to monitor
their environment and reprogram global gene expression during
specific stages of infection. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a major
human pathogen that causes significant disease burden worldwide.
A secreted cysteine protease known as streptococcal pyrogenic exo-
toxin B (SpeB) is a key virulence factor that is produced abundantly
during infection and is critical for GAS pathogenesis. Although iden-
tified nearly a century ago, the molecular basis for growth phase
control of speB gene expression remains unknown. We have discov-
ered that GAS uses a previously unknown peptide-mediated inter-
cellular signaling system to control SpeB production, alter global
gene expression, and enhance virulence. GAS produces an eight-
amino acid leaderless peptide [SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP)] during
high cell density and uses the secreted peptide for cell-to-cell signal-
ing to induce population-wide speB expression. The SIP signaling
pathway includes peptide secretion, reimportation into the cytosol,
and interaction with the intracellular global gene regulator Regula-
tor of Protease B (RopB), resulting in SIP-dependent modulation of
DNA binding and regulatory activity of RopB. Notably, SIP signaling
causes differential expression of ∼14% of GAS core genes. Several
genes that encode toxins and other virulence genes that enhance
pathogen dissemination and infection are significantly up-regulated.
Using three mouse infection models, we show that the SIP signaling
pathway is active during infection and contributes significantly to
GAS pathogenesis at multiple host anatomic sites. Together, our
results delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in a previously
undescribed virulence regulatory pathway of an important human
pathogen and suggest new therapeutic strategies.

patiotemporal regulation of virulence factor production is a
fundamental trait required to be a successful pathogen. Bac-
terial pathogens sense their environment at infection sites and re-
spond by modulating expression of genes involved in pathogen–host
interactions (1–6). In addition to host-derived signals, bacteria
monitor their population density using secreted small molecules and
modulate gene expression during high cell density by a process
called quorum sensing (2, 7, 8). Quorum sensing includes pro-
duction and secretion of signaling molecules, signal detection, and
altered gene regulation (7–9). Typically, gram-positive bacteria use
either linear or modified oligopeptides as quorum-sensing mole-
cules to monitor their population density (7–9). Quorum sensing
controls several bacterial properties, including virulence (7, 8).
However, a direct link between quorum signaling and bacterial
virulence is limited to the agr signaling pathway in Staphylococcus
aureus and other related gram-positive pathogens (10).
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an exclusive human path-
ogen that causes a spectrum of diseases, including mild pharyngitis
(“strep throat”) and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis (“flesh-
eating disease”) (11, 12). GAS produces many bacterial surface-
bound or secreted virulence factors, including superantigens, cyto-
lytic toxins, and proteases (11, 12). Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin
B (SpeB) is a potent secreted cysteine protease that functions as a
major GAS virulence factor (13–20). SpeB is produced abundantly
in infected humans and during experimental animal infection (13–
19). The protease degrades various host proteins to contribute to
tissue damage and cleaves bacterial cell-surface proteins to promote
disease dissemination (14–19, 21, 22). Consistent with its docu-
mented significance in infection, interference strategies targeting
SpeB or its proteolytic activity confer protection against GAS in-
fection (23–26).
SpeB production in vitro is greatly up-regulated late in growth at
high bacterial cell density (18, 27). Since the discovery of SpeB
nearly a century ago, regulation of its biogenesis has been the focus
of extensive investigation (18, 21, 22, 27–38). Several regulatory
circuits converge on transcriptional and posttranscriptional control
of SpeB production (18, 21, 22, 27–36). However, the exact mo-
lecular mechanism underlying cell density-dependent up-regulation
of SpeB has remained elusive. The Regulator of Protease B
(RopB), a global gene regulator, directly controls speB expression
Significance
Regulation of virulence factor production is critical for bacterial
pathogenesis. The human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS)
produces a potent secreted protease, streptococcal pyrogenic
exotoxin B (SpeB), that is crucial for pathogenesis. Although it is
known that GAS produces SpeB at high population density, the
molecular mechanism whereby GAS coordinates temporal SpeB
production is unknown. Here, we identify a GAS-encoded short
leaderless intercellular peptide signal [SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP)],
and define the mechanism by which SIP induces population-wide
SpeB production and contributes to GAS virulence. Furthermore,
discovery of SIP provides a framework for the identification of SIP-
like leaderless peptide signals in other microorganisms. Thus, our
data reveal a paradigm of bacterial signaling and identify pre-
viously unknown molecules that may serve as therapeutic targets.

 during the stationary growth phase (18, 22, 27, 35). Although RopB
is indispensable for growth phase-dependent transcription of speB,
RopB alone is not sufficient to activate speB expression; additional
unknown cell density-specific regulatory factors are required (27,
35). Consistent with this, recent findings suggest that transcriptional
regulation of speB is controlled by a RopB-dependent quorum-
sensing signaling pathway (18, 35). Several lines of evidence sup-
port this model, which includes cell density-dependent regulation of
speB, structural homology of RopB with the Rgg-Rap-NprR-PlcR-
PrgX (RRNPP) family of quorum-sensing transcription regulators,
and antagonistic effects of cell density-specific secreted proteina-
ceous factors on speB expression (18, 35, 39). However, due to the
lack of precise delineation of all necessary genetic and biochemical
regulatory signals, quorum-sensing regulation of speB expression
remains only a formal possibility.
We here report that GAS uses a short peptide-mediated in-
tercellular communication mechanism to modulate virulence gene
expression in a cell density-dependent fashion. The short peptide
lacks a secretion signal sequence. Our results support a model in
which the leaderless peptide is produced by GAS at high cell den-
sity, secreted extracellularly, imported into the cytosol, and sub-
sequently interacts with RopB. Peptide binding to RopB promotes
high-affinity RopB–DNA interactions and RopB polymerization,
resulting in activation of RopB-dependent speB expression. Im-
portantly, we show that this peptide signaling pathway is active
during infection and contributes significantly to GAS virulence in
multiple mouse models of infection.
Results
The ropB-speB Intergenic Region Encodes a Factor That Up-Regulates
speB Expression. The structural homologs of RopB have their
cognate regulatory peptides encoded in their immediate genomic
vicinity (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Thus, we analyzed the 940-bp
ropB-speB intergenic region for ability to alter speB expression
(Fig. 1A). To identify the region that may encode an activation
factor, we constructed three trans-complementation plasmids
that contain different fragments of the intergenic region (Fig. 1 B
and C). Typically, gene expression is higher from a multicopy
plasmid than the chromosome (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Thus, we
hypothesized that higher expression levels of a gene encoding the
putative activation factor will decouple growth phase-dependent
speB expression. To test this hypothesis, we introduced each of
the three plasmids into wild-type (WT) GAS and characterized
the resulting strains for early onset of speB expression by qRT-
PCR. Relative to the WT strain, each of the three intergenic
fragments caused an 8- to 14-fold increase in speB transcript
level in the late exponential phase of growth. These results
suggest that the activation factor for speB expression is likely
encoded within the shortest of the three fragments, that is, the
257-bp fragment located between −775 and −519 bp upstream of
the SpeB translation start site (Fig. 1 A and B).
Analysis of the 940-bp intergenic region identified three hy-
pothetical ORFs (orf), termed orf-1, orf-2, and orf-3 (Fig. 1A).
Given that the intergenic region contains cis-acting regulatory
elements required for speB expression (27), genetic alterations
within the promoter in the form of nucleotide deletions or in-
sertions might disrupt the regulatory elements and spacing be-
tween the regulatory elements in the promoter. Thus, to preserve
the overall architecture of the promoter, we constructed isogenic
mutant strains that replace the start codon (ATG) of each orf
with a stop codon (TAG) in the chromosome. None of the
resulting three mutant strains grew differently than the WT
strain (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Translational disruption of orf-1
(i.e., orf-1* mutant) abolished speB expression, SpeB protein
levels, and SpeB protease activity (Fig. 1 D–F and SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). The transcript level of speB made by the orf-1* mutant
strain was comparable to that of the ΔropB mutant, suggesting
that orf-1 is a crucial factor in speB transcriptional regulation
(Fig. 1 D–F). In contrast, the orf-2* and orf-3* mutant strains had
WT-like speB transcript levels, suggesting that the putative
polypeptides encoded by orf-2 and orf-3 are dispensable for speB
expression (Fig. 1 D–F). Provision of orf-1 alone in trans (pDC–
orf-1) was sufficient to rescue the defective phenotype of the orf-1*
mutant. Phenotype restoration in the orf-1* mutant by the trans-
complementation plasmid was reversed by translational disruption
of orf-1 in trans (pDC–orf-1*) (Fig. 1 D and F and SI Appendix, Figs.
S2 and S3). To exclude the possibility that defective speB expression
in the orf-1* mutant is due to altered ropB expression, we measured
the transcript levels of ropB in the WT, orf-1* mutant, and trans-
complemented strains. The transcript levels of ropB during different
phases of growth in the orf-1* mutant were comparable to those of
WT and trans-complemented strains, suggesting that the nonsense
substitution in the start codon of orf-1 does not affect the expression
of divergently transcribed ropB (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Together,
these results suggest that the observed phenotype of the orf-1*
mutant strain is caused by genetic inactivation of orf-1, not by
promoter alterations (Fig. 1 D–F and SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4).
Importantly, trans-complementation plasmid pDC–orf-1 failed to
restore speB expression in the ΔropB mutant strain (Fig. 1D), in-
dicating that the regulatory activity of the orf-1 gene product re-
quires RopB. Collectively, these data indicate that orf-1 encodes the
activation factor for RopB-dependent speB expression. For the
purpose of clarity, due to its ability to induce speB expression, we
will refer to the putative eight-amino acid polypeptide corre-
sponding to the orf-1 gene product as SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP).
A GAS-Encoded Short Peptide Signal Activates RopB-Dependent speB
Expression. To determine if orf-1 is transcribed, we performed
Northern blot analysis using a probe complementary to orf-1.
Consistent with the polycistronic nature of speB transcripts (34,
40), several bands ranging in size between 300 and 1,500 bases
corresponding to the orf-1 transcript were detected (Fig. 2A).
Importantly, the orf-1 transcript was detected only in WT GAS
grown to the stationary phase, indicating that orf-1 is expressed
at high cell density (Fig. 2A). To investigate if the predicted short
peptide encoded by orf-1 acts as an intercellular signal and ac-
tivates speB expression, we conducted two synthetic peptide
addition experiments. First, synthetic peptides containing dif-
ferent fragments of SIP were tested for their ability to restore
speB expression to an orf-1* mutant (Fig. 2B). When the orf-1*
mutant strain was grown to stationary phase and supplemented
with synthetic peptides of varying length, only the full-length SIP
(SIP-1) caused robust induction of speB expression (>630 fold)
and restored WT-like speB transcript levels, secreted SpeB lev-
els, and SpeB protease activity (Fig. 2 B–D). Synthetic peptide
SIP-5 containing the N-terminal seven amino acids had weaker
activity (>30 fold), whereas all other tested synthetic peptides
failed to activate speB transcription (Fig. 2 B–D). Second, we
also tested the ability of SIP to cause early induction of speB
expression by WT GAS. Consistent with our observations de-
rived from the orf-1* mutant strain, peptide SIP-1 decoupled
growth phase dependency of speB expression and induced early
onset of speB expression by the WT strain (>130 fold) in the late
exponential growth phase (Fig. 2E).
To determine if the observed speB induction is specific for the
primary amino acid sequence of SIP, we conducted analogous
experiments with a scrambled (SCRA) peptide of identical
length and amino acid composition of SIP (Fig. 2B). Importantly,
SCRA peptide did not activate speB expression in either the orf-1*
mutant or WT strain. These results are consistent with the in-
terpretation that induction is specific for SIP (Fig. 2 B–E). As
expected, addition of SIP-1 to the isogenic ΔropB mutant strain
did not induce speB transcript production (Fig. 2B), even when
SIP was added at 300-fold excess (Fig. 2B). Together, these data
indicate that amino acid sequences corresponding to SIP-1 are

The ropB-speB intergenic region has the genetic element encoding the activation peptide signal for RopB-dependent speB expression. (A) Organi-
zation of the ropB and speB gene region in GAS. The ropB and speB genes are divergently transcribed. The angled arrows above the line indicate two
transcription start sites for speB, designated P1 and P2. The angled arrow below the line indicates the transcription start site for ropB (PropB). The intergenic
region with three predicted ORFs, designated orf-1 (orange), orf-2 (green), and orf-3 (blue), is shown as horizontal arrows. (B) Characterization of the se-
quences in the ropB-speB intergenic region for their role in speB expression. High-copy-number plasmids containing different fragments of the intergenic
region were introduced individually into WT GAS, and the resulting strains were characterized for premature induction of speB expression. Cells were grown
to the late exponential growth phase (A600 ∼ 1.0), and speB transcript levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. Numbers at either end of the constructs indicate the
nucleotide positions relative to the first nucleotide of the speB start codon. Fold changes in speB transcript levels in the trans-complemented strains relative to
reference GAS growth are shown. WT GAS (WT: empty vector) grown to late exponential growth was used as the reference. (C) Nucleotide sequence
characteristics of the ropB-speB intergenic region. The numbers above the nucleotides indicate positions relative to the first nucleotide of the speB start
codon. Nucleotides corresponding to transcription start sites P1 and P2 are highlighted in orange. Nucleotide sequences of orf-1, orf-2, orf-3, and speB are
italicized and colored in red. An inferred ribosomal-binding site (RBS) located upstream of orf-1 is boxed and labeled. (D) Analysis of speB transcript levels in

 the high cell density-specific activation peptide signal for RopB-
dependent speB expression.
Molecular Mechanism of GAS Intercellular Signaling. Most of the
characterized peptide signals in gram-positive bacteria are gen-
erated by proteolytic processing of a precursor propeptide form
into mature active peptide by membrane-bound enhanced ex-
pression of pheromone (Eep) protease (41–44). However, SIP is
unique in that it is made as a mature leaderless peptide (Fig. 3A).
The extracellular mature peptides are subsequently reinternal-
ized into the bacterial cytosol by oligopeptide permeases (Opp)
(41, 45, 46). Consistent with this process, inactivation of opp or
dipeptide permease (dpp) in GAS caused down-regulation of
speB expression (47, 48). To test the hypothesis that SIP bio-
synthesis involves similar molecular mechanisms, we constructed
isogenic single-mutant strains of eep (Δeep), opp (ΔoppDF), or dpp
(ΔdppA) and the double mutant, ΔoppDF/ΔdppA. When tested for
speB expression, all four mutant strains had WT-like speB transcript
levels and protease activity (Fig. 3 B and C), indicating that the eep,
opp, and dpp genes are not involved in SIP signaling.
To address the lack of influence of Opp and Dpp permeases
on SIP signaling, we considered two possibilities: (i) SIP is not
secreted, and thus does not require active import by peptide
permeases, or (ii) SIP is secreted and internalized by a yet-to-be-
identified mechanism. The results from secretome swap assays
and synthetic peptide addition experiments suggest that SIP is
secreted and internalized into the cytosol (35) (Fig. 2). To test
the hypothesis that the regulatory factor in the secretome is
encoded by the sip gene, we performed secretome swap assays
using conditioned medium obtained from the WT or orf-1*
mutant strain. Consistent with our hypothesis, compared with the
WT secretome, inactivation of SIP in the orf-1* mutant resulted

Synthetic peptides containing the amino acid sequences of SIP activate speB expression. (A) The orf1 gene, encoding SIP, is expressed during the
stationary phase of GAS growth. Total RNA extracted from WT GAS grown to either the late exponential (LE; A600 ∼ 1.0) or stationary (STAT) phase of growth
and orf-1* mutant grown to the STAT phase of growth were analyzed by Northern blot. (B, Inset) Amino acid sequences of the synthetic peptides (SIP-1–SIP-7)
used in the experiment. (B) SCRA peptide of an identical length and amino acid composition as SIP-1 but differing in the order of sequence was used as a
negative control. The orf-1* mutant strain was grown in chemically defined medium (CDM) to the early STAT phase (A600 ∼ 1.7) and supplemented with either
100 nM indicated synthetic peptide or the carrier for the synthetic peptides (DMSO). After 60 min of incubation, transcript levels of speB were assessed by
qRT-PCR. The orf-1* mutant strain supplemented with DMSO was used as a reference, and fold changes in speB transcript levels relative to the reference are
shown. (C) Western immunoblot analysis of secreted SpeB in filtered growth media from the indicated samples. Cell growth and synthetic peptide sup-

induce SpeB protease activity in the orf-1* mutant. (E) Addition of SIP-1 and SIP-5 decouples the growth phase dependency of speB expression in WT GAS. The
WT GAS was grown in CDM to the mid-exponential growth phase (A600 ∼ 0.6), and cells were incubated with 100 nm of each synthetic peptide for 60 min.
Transcript levels of speB were assessed by qRT-PCR, and the fold change in speB expression relative to DMSO-supplemented growth is shown.

concentration of 1 μM, whereas varying concentrations of FITC–SIP-1 were used. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with sterile
PBS, suspended in PBS, and lysed. Fluorescence measurements were obtained with clarified cell lysates using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 nm and
520 nm, respectively. The unsupplemented orf-1* mutant strain was used as a reference, and changes in relative fluorescence units (RFU) relative to the reference
are shown. (F) Confocal microscopy images of the orf-1* mutant strain either unsupplemented or supplemented with the indicated synthetic peptide. Synthetic

 into the bacterial cytoplasm using synthetic SIP peptide containing
fluorescein modification at its amino terminus (FITC–SIP-1) (Fig.
3E). Peptide addition experiments with FITC–SIP-1 demonstrated
that the modified FITC–SIP-1 is functional and retained the ability
to induce speB expression in the orf-1* mutant strain similar to
unmodified SIP-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). To determine if FITC–
SIP-1 is reimported into the bacterial cytoplasm, we incubated the
orf-1* mutant with FITC–SIP-1 and assessed the cytosolic presence
of FITC–SIP-1 by measuring the relative fluorescence in the clari-
fied cell lysates. An FITC–SIP-1 concentration-dependent increase
in fluorescence was observed in the cell lysates from FITC–SIP-1–
treated samples compared with SIP-1–treated or untreated GAS
(Fig. 3E). Next, we investigated the cytosolic presence of FITC–SIP-
1 in the orf-1* mutant strain by confocal microscopy. The fluores-
cence signal was present in the cytoplasm of GAS cells incubated
with FITC–SIP-1, whereas no fluorescent signal was detected in the
unsupplemented or unmodified SIP-1–supplemented GAS growth
(Fig. 3F). These results are consistent with the interpretation that
exogenously added FITC–SIP-1 is transported into the bacterial
cytoplasm. To test the presence of additional import mechanisms,
we constructed a triple-mutant strain (ΔoppDF/ΔdppA/orf-1*) in
which the orf-1* mutation was introduced into the isogenic double-
mutant strain, ΔoppDF/ΔdppA. Expression of speB in this triple-
mutant strain is dependent entirely on exogenously provided
synthetic SIP peptide. Thus, we measured speB transcript levels
in the triple-mutant strain grown in the presence or absence of
exogenously added SIP. As observed in the orf-1* mutant strain,
addition of SIP restored WT levels of speB expression and SpeB
protease activity in the triple mutant (Fig. 3 B and C). Together,
these data indicate that secreted SIP is reimported into the
bacterial cytosol, and that GAS uses specialized export and im-
port mechanisms for SIP signaling that are distinct from other
characterized bacterial peptide signaling pathways.
To obtain information about the molecular mechanism of gene
regulation by SIP, we used a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to
test the hypothesis that SIP directly interacts with RopB. RopB
bound directly to SIP with a Kd of ∼2.6 nM, indicating a very high-
affinity interaction between the two partners (Fig. 4A). This strong
interaction was disrupted only by the addition of unlabeled SIP,
indicating that the RopB–SIP interaction is sequence specific (Fig.
4B). To understand the downstream mechanistic consequences of
RopB–SIP interaction, we first assessed the effect of SIP binding on
RopB–DNA interactions using an oligoduplex containing the pu-
tative RopB-binding site located upstream of the P1 promoter (27)
(Fig. 4 C and D). Although apo-RopB had the ability to mediate
sequence-specific DNA interactions (Kd of ∼352 nM) (Fig. 4E), SIP
binding caused a ninefold increase in the affinity of the SIP-
bound form of RopB for DNA (Kd of ∼38 nM) (Fig. 4F).
These results suggest that SIP binding promotes high-affinity
RopB–DNA interactions.
To further study RopB–DNA interactions, we analyzed the
DNA-binding properties of RopB by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA). RopB bound to promoter sequences containing
RopB-binding sites that are located upstream of the P1 promoter,
whereas it failed to bind sequences upstream of the P2 promoter
that lack the RopB-binding site, indicating that these interactions
are sequence specific (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). However, no SIP-
induced differences in RopB–DNA interactions were observed, as
both apo- and SIP-bound RopB had similar DNA-binding prop-
erties (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Given that apo-RopB binds DNA with
relatively high affinity (Fig. 3E), it is likely that the sensitivity of
EMSA is not sufficient to distinguish the differences in DNA-
binding affinities of apo- and SIP-bound RopB. We also observed
that RopB at higher concentrations formed multiple supershifted
RopB–DNA complexes, suggesting that RopB multimerizes on the
promoter sequences (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 B and C). Finally, to rule
out the possibility that the defective speB expression in the orf-1*
mutant is not due to impaired RopB binding to speB promoter
sequences, we carried out EMSA studies using speB promoter se-
quences from the WT or orf-1* mutant strain. We observed no
significant differences in RopB interactions with the WT and orf-1*
promoters (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These data add further support to
our conclusion that translation disruption of orf-1 is the underlying
cause for the defective speB expression in the orf-1* mutant strain.
Purified apo-RopB typically eluted as a homodimer during
size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4G). However, we observed
that the addition of SIP caused a shift from RopB dimer to a
higher order oligomer much larger than a dodecamer (Fig. 4G).
Mass spectrometry analysis of the oligomer fractionated by size
exclusion chromatography confirmed that the oligomeric RopB
contains bound SIP, indicating that SIP binding induces RopB
oligomerization (Fig. 4 G and H). These results were further
confirmed by Blu-native PAGE analysis of RopB in the presence
or absence of SIP. Although apo-RopB had the tendency to
oligomerize, the higher order oligomeric form of RopB was
stabilized only by SIP binding (Fig. 4I and SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
To probe the structural components of RopB involved in SIP-
dependent oligomerization, we conducted similar experiments
using the C-terminal domain (residues 56–280) of RopB (RopB-

 CTD) (35). Interestingly, SIP failed to induce RopB-CTD olig-
omerization (SI Appendix, Fig. S9), suggesting that an intact
DNA-binding domain (residues 1–55) is required for SIP-
dependent RopB oligomerization. To investigate if RopB binds
DNA in both dimeric and oligomeric forms, we conducted
EMSA with purified RopB dimer coincubated with SIP and
DNA, or preformed RopB-SIP oligomer fractionated by size
exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4G). Consistent with previous
results, RopB dimer formed higher order RopB-SIP–DNA
complex, whereas preformed RopB-SIP oligomer failed to bind
DNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). These results indicate that the
preformed RopB-SIP oligomer is not compatible for DNA
binding and that SIP-induced high-affinity RopB–DNA interac-
tions precede RopB multimerization. Together, the data suggest
that SIP directly interacts with RopB and modulates gene reg-
ulation by inducing a two-pronged allostery in RopB, namely,
high-affinity RopB–DNA interactions and RopB polymerization.
Global Gene Regulatory Influence of SIP Signaling Pathway. To test
the hypothesis that SIP controls a global quorum-sensing reg-
ulon, we constructed an isogenic Δorf-1 mutant strain with an in-
frame deletion of the entire SIP coding region. Deletion of orf-1
abolished speB expression, and addition of synthetic SIP peptide
restored WT-like speB transcription and SpeB protease activity
in the Δorf-1 mutant, indicating the nonpolar nature of the Δorf-
1 mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). We next used RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) analysis to compare the global transcript profiles of
the WT and Δorf-1 mutant strains grown to stationary phase.
Compared with the WT strain, 271 genes (14% of the GAS core
chromosome, P < 0.05, and twofold differences) were differen-
tially regulated in the Δorf-1 mutant strain, of which 228 genes
were up-regulated and 43 genes were down-regulated (SI Ap-
pendix, Tables S1 and S2). As expected, the level of speB tran-
script was drastically down-regulated in the Δorf-1 mutant strain
(>2,000-fold reduction) relative to the WT strain (SI Appendix,
Fig. S12). Additional genes that were significantly down-regulated
in the Δorf-1 mutant include genes that encode known virulence
factors, such as SagP, NdoS, Sdn, and HlyIII (SI Appendix, Table
S1). Conversely, the up-regulated genes in the Δorf-1 mutant strain
belong to the following categories: (i) de novo protein synthesis (rps,
rpl, and rpm operons that encode ribosomal subunits), (ii) DNA
synthesis (pyr, pur, guaAB, nrd, carAB, and rexAB operons), (iii) cell
wall synthesis and cell division (murB, murN, pgdA, smc, and
divIVA), (iv) group A carbohydrate antigen synthesis (rgpBCDEFG
operon), (v) transporters involved in nutrient acquisition (dpp, opp,
and pot operons), (vi) proteases (pcp, pepB, pepN, pepO, pepXP,
cppA, and clpX), and (vii) cell surface protein (grab) (SI Appendix,
Table S2).
To further understand the effect of SIP on global gene regu-
lation, we also performed RNA-seq analysis of WT and orf-1*
mutant strains grown to stationary phase. Compared with the
WT strain, 72 genes (4% of the GAS core chromosome, P <
0.05, and twofold differences) were differentially expressed in
the orf-1* mutant strain, of which 31 genes were up-regulated
and 41 genes were down-regulated (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and
S4). As observed in the Δorf-1 mutant strain, the level of speB,
spi, and orf-3 (SpyM3_1743) transcripts was drastically down-
regulated in the orf-1* mutant strain (>1,300-fold reduction)
relative to the WT strain (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). However, the
SIP regulon identified in the orf-1* mutant strain is relatively
smaller compared with that of the Δorf-1 mutant strain. To un-
derstand the differences in the global gene regulatory influence
of SIP between orf-1* and Δorf-1 mutant strains, we compared
the RNA-seq reads from the orf-1* and Δorf-1 mutant strains
within the ropB-speB gene loci (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). In-
terestingly, the level of ropB transcript was significantly up-
regulated in the Δorf-1 mutant strain relative to the WT strain
(greater than threefold increase) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and
Table S2), whereas no significant difference in the ropB tran-
script level was observed in the orf-1* mutant strain. Thus, it is
possible that transcription activation of speB, spi, and orf-3
(SpyM3_1743) by RopB is SIP-dependent; however, RopB has
additional SIP-independent regulatory roles that may con-
tribute to the larger regulon observed in the Δorf-1 mutant strain.
Together, the global transcriptome data demonstrate that the SIP
signaling pathway directly or indirectly up-regulates the expression
of several secreted virulence factors, including SpeB.

 WT and orf-1* mutant strains in a mouse model of bacteremia
(17, 49, 50). Consistent with its key role in SpeB production, the
virulence of the orf-1* mutant strain was significantly attenuated
relative to the WT strain and comparable to that of the ΔropB
and ΔspeB mutant strains that lack SpeB production (Fig. 5A).
Next, we tested if SIP signaling is also critical for GAS virulence
in invasive disease using a mouse model of necrotizing myositis
(17, 49, 50). The orf-1* mutant strain was significantly less vir-
ulent than the WT and trans-complemented strains (Fig. 5B).
Inasmuch as SpeB contributes to host tissue damage and disease
dissemination (14–18, 22, 51), we also investigated lesion char-
acter by visual and microscopic examination. Consistent with the
virulence phenotype, the orf-1*, ΔropB, and ΔspeB mutant
strains caused smaller muscle lesions with less severe tissue de-
struction relative to WT and trans-complemented strains (Fig.
5C). Finally, we tested if the RopB-SIP signaling pathway con-
tributes to GAS virulence in a mouse model of skin and soft
tissue infection (17, 49, 50). Compared with WT and trans-
complemented strains, the orf-1*, ΔropB, and ΔspeB mutant
strains caused significantly smaller and more confined lesions
(Fig. 5D) with less tissue damage and ulceration (Fig. 5E). To-
gether, these virulence data demonstrate that the RopB-SIP
signaling pathway significantly contributes to GAS pathogene-
sis at multiple anatomic sites.
RopB-SIP Signaling Pathway Is Active During Mouse Infection. We
next investigated if the RopB-SIP–mediated quorum-sensing
pathway controls speB expression in vivo during the course of
infection. Mice were inoculated s.c. with each of the indicated
strains, and speB transcript levels in the infected lesions were
measured by qRT-PCR. Compared with the WT strain grown to
the late exponential phase in laboratory medium, the WT strain
isolated from infected lesions had a 3,000-fold higher level of
speB transcript (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the in vitro observa-
tions, lesions from mice infected with ΔropB and orf-1* mutants
had drastically decreased speB expression in vivo and speB
transcript levels were comparable to those of the WT strain in
the late exponential growth phase (Fig. 6A). Importantly, trans-
complementation of the orf-1* mutant strain with pDC–orf-1
fully restored WT-like speB transcript levels, indicating that SIP-
mediated speB regulation occurs in vivo (Fig. 6A). Finally, we
assessed the ability of synthetic peptide SIP to activate speB
expression in vivo and promote bacterial virulence using the s.c.
mouse model of infection. Coinjection with SIP restored a WT-
like virulence phenotype to the orf-1* mutant strain, resulting in
larger ulcerated lesions relative to orf-1* mutant coinjected with
the SCRA peptide (Fig. 6 B–D). These data indicate that syn-
thetic peptides containing the SIP amino acid sequences have
biological activity in vivo, and are sufficient to restore GAS
pathogenesis in the orf-1* mutant strain. Collectively, our data
demonstrate that SIP signaling is active during host infection
and, moreover, show that SIP-mediated up-regulation of viru-
lence gene expression contributes significantly to GAS virulence.
Discussion
In the aggregate, we here show that GAS uses complex in-
tercellular communication machinery to monitor its population
density and determine whether to initiate a virulent lifestyle that
involves host tissue damage and disease dissemination. The re-
sults presented herein show that an intercellular peptide signal,
SIP, and the intracellular global gene regulator RopB form a
signal/receptor pair that contributes significantly to GAS path-
ogenesis by modulating virulence gene expression. Importantly,
the nucleotide sequence encoding the inferred eight amino acids
of SIP is absolutely conserved, and the promoter sequences
upstream of the SIP-coding region are highly conserved among
11 different GAS serotypes (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Thus, the
SIP signaling pathway likely represents a virulence regulatory
mechanism conserved among many GAS M-protein serotypes.
All previously characterized bacterial peptide signals are
produced as propeptides that have a cleavable amino-terminal
secretion signal sequence and protease cleavage sites, resulting
in a mature peptide (8) (Fig. 3A). The secretion signal sequence
targets the propeptide to the secretion machinery at the cell
membrane, where the propeptide undergoes proteolytic cleav-
age. The released mature peptide is exported, and subsequently
reimported into the cytosol by Opp permeases (39). In contrast,
SIP lacks the distinctive sequence motifs of bacterial peptide

communication and GAS virulence regulation. (Left) At low cell density, the se-
cretion signal sequence of Vfr binds to RopB and negatively influences RopB-
dependent transcription activation from the P1 promoter, possibly by disrupting
RopB–DNA interactions. (Right) At high cell density, SIP is produced, secreted, and
reimported into the cytosol. The high-affinity RopB–DNA interactions and RopB
polymerization aided by SIP binding lead to up-regulation of sip expression, which
results in robust induction of SIP production by a positive-feedback mechanism. In
addition to up-regulation of virulence genes, the SIP signaling circuit down-
regulates the expression of categories of genes involved in GAS growth and
host cell attachment. Finally, the SIP-dependent up-regulation of speB leads to
abundant secretion of mature SpeB (SpeBM), which facilitates host tissue damage
and disease dissemination by cleavage of various host and GAS proteins.

 signals. GAS produces SIP in a mature form that is devoid of a
secretion signal sequence and protease cleavage site (Fig. 3A).
Nevertheless, SIP is secreted and reimported by an Opp permease-
independent import mechanism. These differences indicate that SIP
biosynthesis is an important exception to the established paradigm
of bacterial peptide signaling. Thus, SIP belongs to a previously
undescribed new class of leaderless bacterial peptide signals. Such
lack of conformity likely hobbled previous extensive efforts to
identify SIP (18, 21, 22, 27, 30–33, 35, 36). Given that RRNPP
family proteins are widespread among low guanine + cytosine gram-
positive bacteria and bacteriophages (42, 52), and the cognate
peptide signals for the vast majority of these regulators have not yet
been identified, we speculate that leaderless peptides analogous to
SIP will participate in other microbial signaling pathways. Thus, our
delineation of SIP signaling may accelerate discovery of similar
peptide signals in other microorganisms.
Typically, the internalized cognate peptides bind to the respective
regulators and trigger regulator-specific conformational changes that
modulate gene regulation (39). The characterized activation peptide-
induced allostery among RRNPP family regulators includes disrup-
tion of tetramerization in PrgX from Enterococcus faecalis, induction
of tetramerization in NprR from Bacillus cereus, and unmasking of
the N-terminal DNA-binding domain that aids promoter binding by
PlcR from B. cereus (39, 53–55). Our results indicate that SIP con-
trols RopB regulatory activity by facilitating high-affinity RopB–
DNA interactions and RopB polymerization (Fig. 4). The se-
quences upstream of the P1 promoter have two putative RopB-
binding sites, site 1 and site 2, and these two sites are separated by
a 121-bp-long spacer region. The two sites are highly similar (Fig.
4C), and RopB binds to each site with comparable affinity. Thus, it is
plausible that SIP promotes RopB interactions with the two high-
affinity operator sequences. Using these interactions as nucleation
events, RopB polymerizes on the spacer between the two sites,
resulting in RopB-dependent transcription activation from the
P1 promoter. However, additional investigations will be required to
test the proposed model and elucidate the mechanism by which
RopB polymerization contributes to its regulatory activity.
Based on earlier work (18) and results presented here, we propose
the following model (Fig. 6E). During low cell density, the inhibition
peptide signal derived from the secretion signal sequence of Vfr in-
teracts with RopB and negatively influences speB expression, possibly
by inhibiting RopB–DNA interactions (Fig. 6E). Conversely, during
high cell density, expression of vfr is down-regulated, which results in
low-level SIP production. The initial SIP production acts as a positive
feedback loop, resulting in robust induction of SIP. The SIP-bound
RopB binds to operator sequences, polymerizes on the promoter, and
mediates transcription activation of target genes.
To summarize, the data we present here provide detailed mo-
lecular and mechanistic understanding of a key virulence regula-
tory pathway of an abundant human pathogen responsible for
greater than 700 million human infections annually worldwide (56,
57). Moreover, the work identified previously unknown molecular
targets that may be exploited to develop new therapeutics.
