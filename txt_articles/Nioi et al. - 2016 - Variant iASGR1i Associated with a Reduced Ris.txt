BACKGROUND
Several sequence variants are known to have effects on serum levels of non–high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that alter the risk of coronary artery disease.
METHODS
We sequenced the genomes of 2636 Icelanders and found variants that we then 
imputed into the genomes of approximately 398,000 Icelanders. We tested for as-
sociation between these imputed variants and non-HDL cholesterol levels in 
119,146 samples. We then performed replication testing in two populations of 
European descent. We assessed the effects of an implicated loss-of-function vari-
ant on the risk of coronary artery disease in 42,524 case patients and 249,414 
controls from five European ancestry populations. An augmented set of genomes 
was screened for additional loss-of-function variants in a target gene. We evalu-
ated the effect of an implicated variant on protein stability.
RESULTS
We found a rare noncoding 12-base-pair (bp) deletion (del12) in intron 4 of ASGR1, 
which encodes a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a lectin that plays a 
role in the homeostasis of circulating glycoproteins. The del12 mutation activates 
a cryptic splice site, leading to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon 
that renders a truncated protein prone to degradation. Heterozygous carriers of the 
mutation (1 in 120 persons in our study population) had a lower level of non-HDL 
cholesterol than noncarriers, a difference of 15.3 mg per deciliter (0.40 mmol per 
liter) (P 
= 
1.0×10−16), and a lower risk of coronary artery disease (by 34%; 95% con-
fidence interval, 21 to 45; P 
= 
4.0×10−6). In a larger set of sequenced samples from 
Icelanders, we found another loss-of-function ASGR1 variant (p.W158X, carried by 
1 in 1850 persons) that was also associated with lower levels of non-HDL choles-
terol (P 
= 
1.8×10−3).
CONCLUSIONS
ASGR1 haploinsufficiency was associated with reduced levels of non-HDL cholesterol 
and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. (Funded by the National Institutes 
of Health and others.)

pidemiologic and genetic studies 
have shown a causal link between levels of 
non–high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) 
cholesterol and of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol and the risk of coronary artery dis-
ease and myocardial infarction.1-3 Non-HDL cho-
lesterol has been shown to be a better predictor 
of cardiovascular risk than LDL cholesterol, since 
it encompasses all cholesterol-containing proath-
erogenic lipoproteins, including LDL cholesterol, 
very-low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density 
lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a), and chylomicron.4 
Non-HDL cholesterol levels are calculated by sub-
tracting HDL cholesterol levels from total choles-
terol levels.
Through the discovery of sequence variants 
that affect both cholesterol and the risk of coro-
nary artery disease, genetic studies have provided 
targets for the development of drugs to treat 
dyslipidemia and thereby prevent coronary artery 
disease.5-10 In our search for new variants that 
affect non-HDL cholesterol levels, we applied a 
method11 of interrogating whole genomes in sam-
ples obtained from a large number of Icelanders. 
We then tested for association between implicat-
ed variants and the risk of coronary artery disease.
Methods
Study Participants
Details regarding the population sample sets 
from Iceland, Denmark, and the Netherlands 
that were used to measure the various lipid traits 
(non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, and triglycerides), alkaline phospha-
tase, and vitamin B12 are provided in the Meth-
ods section and Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org. Details regarding the 10 case–
control sample sets are provided in the Methods 
section and Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Data Generation and Analysis
We used Illumina microarrays to genotype the 
Icelandic samples, as described previously.11 We 
sequenced the genomes of 2636 Icelanders using 
the standard TruSeq methods (Illumina) to a 
mean depth of at least 10× (median, 20×), an 
analysis that has also been described previously11 
and is described in the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix. We generated sequence 
data from 738 Icelanders using the TruSeq 
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–free method 
(Illumina; mean depth, 30×) to improve coverage 
of the GC-rich sequence of intron 4 in ASGR1, 
which encodes a subunit of the asialoglycopro-
tein receptor.
To obtain a reliable imputation of a variant 
with a noncoding 12-base-pair (bp) deletion 
(del12) that is not easily called from the whole-
genome sequence data, we genotyped samples 
obtained from 3799 Icelanders and used those 
genotypes as a training set for imputation of 
del12 in the rest of the Icelandic population. The 
imputation information for del12 was 0.99. (De-
tails regarding genotype imputation are provid-
ed in the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix.) For a second loss-of-function variant, 
p.W158X, we performed Sanger sequencing on 
samples obtained from 345 participants that 
included 79 carriers and 270 noncarriers of the 
p.W158X variant and used the genotypes to im-
prove the imputation of the variant in the Ice-
landic data set. The imputation information for 
p.W158X was 1.00. (Details are provided in the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Statistical Analysis
We tested associations between imputed geno-
types and levels of serum lipids, alkaline phos-
phatase, and vitamin B12 in the Icelandic data set 
using generalized linear regression, assuming 
an additive genetic model, as described previ-
ously11,12 and as outlined in the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
For the Icelandic data set, we used logistic 
regression to test for association between the 
del12 variant and coronary artery disease and 
myocardial infarction, treating disease status as 
the outcome and the number of copies of del12 
in individual carriers as the explanatory variable. 
We used NEMO software13 and assumed a mul-
tiplicative risk model when testing for an asso-
ciation between del12 and coronary artery dis-
ease in the non-Icelandic samples. We combined 
the results for the Icelandic and the non-Icelan-
dic sample sets using a Mantel–Haenszel fixed-
effects model.
To estimate the effect of the del12 variant on 
myocardial infarction-free survival, we generated 
Kaplan–Meier curves for the time until the first

Variant ASGR1 Associated with Reduced Coronary Risk
myocardial infarction in heterozygous carriers 
and noncarriers. Details regarding this analysis 
are provided in the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. We corrected for familial 
relatedness in the Icelandic data sets using the 
method of genomic control14 by dividing the cor-
responding chi-square statistic by 1.36 for non-
HDL cholesterol, 1.57 for HDL cholesterol, 1.40 
for triglycerides, 1.53 for alkaline phosphatase, 
1.30 for vitamin B12, 1.71 for coronary artery 
disease, and 1.48 for myocardial infarction.
Results
Association of Sequence Variants with  
Non-HDL Cholesterol
We obtained 25.3 million sequence variants by 
sequencing the genomes of 2636 Icelanders and 
then imputed those variants into the genomes 
of approximately 398,000 living and deceased 
Icelanders. Among the samples with imputed 
genotypes, 119,146 had information on serum 
non-HDL cholesterol levels (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Some analyses that 
we carried out on these data have been reported 
previously.15,16 We identified a set of seven corre-
lated noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) on chromosome 17p13.1 (pairwise r2>0.70) 
that have association with non-HDL cholesterol 
levels. The seven variants span 80 kb, including 
ASGR1 and ASGR2, which encode subunits of 
the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The strongest 
association was seen with the minor allele of 
rs186021206 located 7.3 kb downstream from 
ASGR1 (minor allele frequency, 0.43%). This allele 
is associated with a lowering of non-HDL choles-
terol by 12.9 mg per deciliter (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 8.7 to 17.1 [0.33 mmol per liter; 
95% CI, 0.22 to 0.44]; P 
= 
1.4×10−9) (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Although this seven-SNP region was well 
covered by reads obtained on whole-genome se-
quencing, we obtained low coverage of intron 4 
of ASGR1, which is enriched in guanosine (G) 
and cytosine (C) residues and therefore difficult 
to sequence. We thus sequenced the whole ge-
nomes of 738 participants with a PCR-free meth-
od that is better suited to obtaining the sequence 
of GC-rich tracts and observed a del12 within 
intron 4 (NCBI reference sequence, NM_001671.4; 
c.284-36_283+33delCTGGGGCTGGGG).
After direct genotyping of del12 in 3799 Ice-
landers and imputation in 398,000 Icelanders, 
we observed that del12 (minor allele frequency, 
0.41%; corresponding to a frequency of 1 in 120 
heterozygous carriers) was highly correlated with 
rs186021206 (r2 
= 
0.86) and the other six strongly 
associated SNPs (Tables S3 and S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Furthermore, del12 was more 
strongly associated with lower non-HDL choles-
terol levels than were any of the seven SNPs, with 
a level that was lower among heterozygous carri-
ers of del12 than among noncarriers by 13.6 mg 
per deciliter (95% CI, 9.4 to 17.7 [0.35 mmol per 
liter; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.46]; P 
= 
2.5×10−10) (Table 1, 
and Tables S3 and S4 and Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The del12 variant was also 
associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels, with 
an effect size similar to that observed between 
del12 and non-HDL cholesterol levels.
We replicated a previously reported association 
between a common variant upstream of ASGR1 
(rs314253; minor allele frequency, 35.1%) and 
lowering of LDL cholesterol levels17; however, 
this association was independent of the del12 
signal (r2<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). After adjustment for the presence of 
del12, neither rs186021206 nor any of the other 
six SNPs remained significantly associated with 
the non-HDL cholesterol level (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
An analysis of an extended Icelandic data set 
with 5817 additional genome sequences, which 
provided increased sequence coverage, indicated 
that of all the variants within a 1-Mb region 
centered on ASGR1, del12 showed the strongest 
association with non-HDL levels (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The del12 variant was 
also associated with increased HDL cholesterol 
levels and decreased triglyceride levels, although 
the association was weaker than that with re-
duced non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
levels (Table 1).
We also tested for associations between del12 
and lipid levels in samples from the Nether-
lands18 and Denmark19,20 (Table 1, and Tables S1 
and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) and ob-
served associations between del12 and non-HDL 
cholesterol with effect sizes similar to those 
seen in the sample from Iceland (P 
= 
0.24 for 
heterogeneity). After combining all the data sets 
(including the Icelandic discovery data), we

Variant ASGR1 Associated with Reduced Coronary Risk
found that del12 was associated with lowering 
of non-HDL cholesterol by 15.3 mg per deciliter 
(95% CI, 11.7 to 18.9 [0.40 mmol per liter; 95% 
CI, 0.30 to 0.49]; P 
= 
1.0×10−16).
Effect of del12 on ASGR1 mRNA Splicing
We examined the effect of del12 on the splicing 
of exons 4 and 5 of ASGR1 on PCR assays 
(Fig. 1A) and observed two PCR products gener-
ated from messenger RNA (mRNA) in blood 
samples obtained from del12 carriers, whereas 
only the larger product was detected in noncar-
riers (Fig. 1B). The sequence of the smaller prod-
uct had a 22-bp deletion at the end of exon 4 
(Fig. 1C), which was probably the result of a 
pseudo donor splice site in exon 4 (Fig. 1D). 
Direct digital counting of sequencing reads pro-
vided an approximate estimate of the fraction of 
ASGR1 mRNA transcripts in the blood cells of 
the 13 del12 carriers that were incorrectly 
spliced. This analysis showed that the variant 
mRNA transcripts represented about one third 
of ASGR1 transcripts (Fig. 1E), a fraction that 
was significantly different from that in non-
carriers (P 
= 
1.8×10−6 by the Wilcoxon–Mann–
Whitney test). The 22-bp deletion is predicted to 
cause a frameshift mutation in ASGR1 and 
thereby introduce a premature stop codon at 
amino acid 89 in the 291-amino-acid full-
length protein (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
A process called nonsense-mediated decay is 
responsible for eliminating aberrant mRNA 
transcripts with premature stop codons, such 
as the one generated by del12.21 However, since 
one third of the ASGR1 transcripts in heterozy-
gous carriers had the 22-bp frameshift deletion, 
these transcripts are not fully eliminated by this 
process. If translated, the variant ASGR1 tran-
script would be predicted to generate a trun-
cated protein (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). To determine whether such a trun-
cated protein is produced in cells, we transiently 
overexpressed ASGR1 complementary DNA har-
boring the 22-bp deletion and wild-type ASGR1 
in HeLa cells. Using Western-blot analysis, we 
detected only wild-type ASGR1 protein (Fig. 1F), 
even though both types of the mRNA transcript 
were highly expressed (data not shown). How-
ever, when the transfected cells were treated 
with a proteasome inhibitor, which blocks the 
degradation of truncated and misfolded pro-
teins,22,23 we detected the truncated protein 
(Fig. 1F, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). This finding showed that the truncat-
ed ASGR1 protein was synthesized and then 
degraded.
Alkaline Phosphatase, Vitamin B12, and del12
ASGR1 is the major subunit of the hepatic 
asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) known to 
recognize and mediate the endocytosis and degra-
dation of a variety of desialylated glycopro-
teins.24-27 We wondered whether the serum levels 
of any sialylated glycoproteins were altered in 
del12 carriers, so we tested the association of 
del12 with serum levels of various substances 
that are routinely measured at hospitals and 
clinical laboratories in Iceland. Apart from the 
associations with blood lipids, we observed a 
highly significant association of del12 with levels 
of circulating alkaline phosphatase and vitamin 
B12. The alkaline phosphatase levels were higher 
among carriers of del12 than among noncarri-
ers, with a difference of 43.6 U per liter (95% CI, 
37.3 to 49.8; P 
= 
3.6×10−63), representing levels that 
were 50.1% higher in carriers than in noncarriers. 
The vitamin B12 levels were also higher among 
carriers, with a difference of 66.1 pmol per liter 
(95% CI, 45.8 to 85.6; P 
= 
3.1×10−12), representing 
levels that were 16.6% higher (Table 1, and Table 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Regional 
plots, which were based on the significance 
levels for the association of markers centered on 
ASGR1 with levels of alkaline phosphatase and 
vitamin B12, mirrored the plot of the association 
with non-HDL cholesterol (Fig. S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). However, the effects of the 
associations were in opposite directions: carriers 
of del12 had lower non-HDL cholesterol levels 
but higher levels of alkaline phosphatase and 
vitamin B12 than noncarriers. In Denmark, we 
replicated these associations with carriers of del12 
who had higher levels of alkaline phosphatase 
and vitamin B12 than noncarriers (P 
= 
3.1×10−6 
and P 
= 
0.005, respectively) (Table 1, and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Moreover, the 
common variant at the ASGR1 locus (rs314253) 
that was previously reported to be associated 
with decreased levels of LDL cholesterol was also 
reported to be associated with increased levels 
of alkaline phosphatase,28 two associations that 
we verified for this variant (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

In both the Icelandic and the Danish data 
sets, non-HDL cholesterol levels were correlated 
with alkaline phosphatase levels but not with 
vitamin B12 levels. Furthermore, there was a 
stronger association of del12 with non-HDL cho-
lesterol levels after adjustment for alkaline phos-
phatase levels but not after adjustment for vita-
min B12 levels (Table S6 in the Supplementary

Variant ASGR1 Associated with Reduced Coronary Risk
independent of both alkaline phosphatase and 
vitamin B12 levels. The increase in levels of alka-
line phosphatase associated with del12 is unlike-
ly to reflect the presence of liver disease since 
we observed no association between del12 and 
serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase, bili-
rubin, alanine aminotransferase, or other mea-
sures of liver function that commonly accompany 
changes in alkaline phosphatase levels during 
the course of liver disease (Table S7 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Coronary Risk and del12
Given the effect of del12 on non-HDL choles-
terol levels, we assessed the effect of the variant 
on the risk of coronary artery disease in 33,090 
case patients and 236,254 controls from Iceland 
and 9434 case patients and 13,160 controls from 
the United States (Emory University, Duke Uni-
versity, and University of Pennsylvania), the United 
Kingdom (Leicester Myocardial Infarction Study 
and British Heart Foundation Family Heart 
Study), New Zealand, and Denmark. The risk of 
coronary artery disease was lower among carri-
ers of the del12 variant than among noncarriers 
in both the Icelandic set (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 
0.51 to 0.80; P 
= 
5.8×10−5) and the non-Icelandic 
sets (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95; 
P 
= 
0.02), for a combined odds ratio of 0.66 (95% 
CI, 0.55 to 0.79; P 
= 
4.0×10−6) (Fig. 2A). There was 
no evidence of heterogeneity across the eight 
study populations (P 
= 
0.96). Among Icelanders, 
the risk of myocardial infarction was lower 
among carriers of the del12 variant than among 
noncarriers (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.64 to 
0.80; P 
= 
8.5×10−5) (Fig. 2B). In agreement with 
the protective effect against coronary artery dis-
ease, Icelandic del12 carriers had a life span that 
was 1.5 years longer than that of noncarriers 
(95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8; P 
= 
0.02). We did not observe 
an association (inverse or otherwise) of del12 
with other known risk factors for coronary ar-
tery disease, such as hypertension, smoking sta-
tus, obesity, or type 2 diabetes (Table S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Several studies have shown a strong positive 
correlation between the effects of lipid-associated 
sequence variants on non-HDL cholesterol levels 
and the risk of coronary artery disease.7-10,29 How-
ever, in our data, several published variants devi-
ated from the overall trend (Fig. 3, and Table S9 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The del12 muta-
tion in ASGR1 is another example of a variant for 
which the effect on coronary artery disease is 
Figure 1 (facing page). Splicing Error and Frameshift  
in ASGR1 Created by del12.
Panel A shows an overview of the structure of the ASGR1 
messenger RNA (mRNA) with highlighting of exons 4 
and 5. A rare noncoding 12-base-pair (bp) deletion (del12) 
lies within intron 4, which sits between exons 4 and 5. 
Also shown are the positions of the primers that were 
used to amplify the complementary DNA (cDNA) on 
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. CDS denotes 
coding sequence, and UTR untranslated region. Panel B 
shows the PCR products produced by amplifying cDNA 
generated from RNA isolated from the blood of hetero-
zygous carriers (plus signs) and noncarriers (minus signs) 
of the del12 variant. Labels indicate the size of the expect-
ed PCR product (239 bp) and the size of the truncated 
band (217 bp) observed only in del12 heterozygous 
carriers. Panel C shows the differences between the full-
length (239-bp) and truncated (217-bp) cDNA fragments 
on Sanger sequencing. The truncated fragment in carri-
ers of the del12 variant lacks 22 bp at the end of exon 4, 
which results in a frameshift and an introduction of a 
stop codon. Panel D shows the splicing defect observed 
in del12 carriers. The sequence around the boundary 
between exon 4 (in uppercase letters) and intron 4 (in 
lowercase letters) is shown, along with the 5′ splice site 
in noncarriers and the cryptic 5′ splice site activated in 
del12 carriers. Panel E shows the quantification of the 
cDNA fragments with the 22-bp deletion in heterozygous 
del12 carriers and noncarriers, which was done by direct 
digital counting of sequencing reads using the Illumina 
TruSeq method. The estimate of the fraction of incor-
rectly spliced isoforms out of the total ASGR1 transcripts 
was based on the ratio of read coverage over the 22-bp 
fragment at the end of exon 4 and the median coverage 
over exon 5. There was a significant difference between 
noncarriers and carriers in the estimated fraction of in-
correctly spliced isoforms (P = 1.8×10−6 by the Wilcoxon–
Mann–Whitney test). The horizontal lines indicate the 
median fraction, and the top and bottom of the boxes 
indicate the first and third quartiles. The top of the I bar 
indicates the smaller of the maximum fraction or the 
75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, 
and the bottom of the I bar indicates the larger of the 
minimum fraction or the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times 
the interquartile range. Panel F shows Western blot 
analysis of HeLa cells that transiently overexpress wild-
type ASGR1 cDNA or mutated ASGR1 cDNA lacking the 
22-bp fragment at the end of exon 4 (22bp_del). In the 
last lane, HeLa cells transfected with the 22bp_del cDNA 
were treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 for 
4.5 hours. The ASGR1 antibody that was used recognizes 
amino acids 1 to 41 of the ASGR1 protein. The blot in 
the center panel had a longer exposure time to detect the 
truncated ASGR1 protein after treatment with MG-132 
than did those in the top and bottom panels.

stronger than that predicted by its effect on non-
HDL cholesterol.
The associations of del12 with both the risk 
of coronary artery disease and the risk of myo-
cardial infarction became stronger after adjust-
ment for the association between del12 and alka-
line phosphatase levels and was unchanged after 
adjustment for the association with vitamin B12 
levels (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Thus, it is implausible that the unexplained 
atheroprotective effects of del12 (i.e., those not 
associated with lowering of non-HDL levels) are 
mediated through modulating levels of alkaline 
phosphatase or vitamin B12.
Second Loss-of-Function Variant in ASGR1
In addition to samples obtained from 2636 Ice-
landers that we had previously sequenced, we 
screened an extended data set that included vari-
ants of the genomes of 5817 Icelanders and ob-
served another rare loss-of-function variant, a 
4-bp insertion (minor allele frequency, 0.027%; 
NM_001671.4; c.469_472dupAACT) that intro-
duces a stop codon at position 158 (NP_001662.1; 
p.W158X) in the ASGR1 protein (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). We directly genotyped 
predicted carriers and noncarriers by means of 
Sanger sequencing and used those genotypes 
to improve the imputation of p.W158X. The 
Figure 2. Association of del12 in ASGR1 with a Reduced Risk of Coronary Artery Disease and Myocardial Infarction.
Panel A shows odds ratios for coronary artery disease associated with the del12 variant in ASGR1 among a total of 42,524 participants 
with coronary artery disease and 249,414 controls in Iceland, Denmark, the United States (Emory University, Duke University, and the 
University of Pennsylvania [UPenn]), the United Kingdom (UK-I and UK-II), and New Zealand. For each sample set, the size of the square 
for the odds ratio is proportional to the number of participants who were evaluated. The del12 variant was associated with a significantly 
lower risk of coronary artery disease in both the Icelandic set (P = 5.8×10−5) and the non-Icelandic sets (P = 0.02), for a combined odds 
ratio of 0.66 (P = 4.0×10−6). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across the eight study populations (P = 0.96). MAF denotes minor 
 
allele frequency. Panel B shows Kaplan–Meier curves for survival free of a first myocardial infarction among heterozygous carriers and 
noncarriers of the del12 variant, stratified according to sex. The hatch marks indicate censoring of data.

Variant ASGR1 Associated with Reduced Coronary Risk
p.W158X variant was associated with a lower 
non-HDL cholesterol level in carriers than in 
noncarriers (−24.9 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 
−40.6 to −9.3; P 
= 
1.8×10−3) and a higher level of 
alkaline phosphatase (by 45.3%; 95% CI, 20.4 to 
68.2; P 
= 
7.9×10−6) (Table S11 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The direction and size of the 
effects of p.W158X on non-HDL cholesterol and 
alkaline phosphatase are similar to those of 
del12. For coronary artery disease in Iceland, the 
odds ratio for p.W158X was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.26 
to 1.40; P 
= 
0.24). None of the 79 Icelandic car-
riers of p.W158X also carried del12. We did not 
observe p.W158X in large population databases 
such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium, the 
Exome Variant Server, or Genomes of the Nether-
lands.
Discussion
In our study, we found an associations between 
ASGR1 variants and non-HDL cholesterol levels 
and the risk of coronary artery disease and myo-
cardial infarction. Although it has been long 
established that ASGPR (in which ASGR1 is the 
major subunit) mediates endocytosis and degra-
dation of desialylated glycoproteins, the endog-
enous ligands and the physiologic function of 
the receptor have been difficult to establish.30 
Mice lacking Asgr1 thrive normally and do not 
accumulate desialylated glycoproteins in the cir-
culation, although they are unable to clear exog-
enously added asialoglycoproteins.31 Through 
analysis of loss-of-function variants in ASGR1, 
we have established a role for human ASGR1 in 
the control of non-HDL cholesterol levels and in 
regulation of the endogenous levels of at least 
some asialoglycoproteins.
We found that the two loss-of-function vari-
ants identified in ASGR1, del12 and p.W158X, are 
associated with decreased non-HDL cholesterol 
levels and increased levels of alkaline phospha-
tase and vitamin B12. The previously described 
common variant close to ASGR1 is also associ-
ated with increased levels of alkaline phospha-
tase and low levels of LDL cholesterol.17,28 We 
propose that the loss-of-function ASGR1 variants 
probably exert these “opposite” effects (i.e., in-
creased alkaline phosphatase and vitamin B12 
levels and decreased non-HDL cholesterol levels) 
through different mechanisms. Both alkaline 
phosphatase and haptocorrin, a vitamin B12 trans-
porter, are asialylated glycoproteins that are 
known to bind ASGPR and thus be cleared from 
the circulation.31-34 The likely explanation for the 
increased levels of alkaline phosphatase among 
carriers of loss-of-function ASGR1 variants is 
that clearance of desialylated molecules from the 
circulation is compromised.
The mechanism by which the variants bring 
about a reduction in non-HDL cholesterol levels 
is probably a different one. Some insight into 
this mechanism may be provided by analyses of 
mice that express a hypomorphic form of neur-
aminidase 1 (Neu1), a sialidase that cleaves the 
sialic acid residues and thereby generates sub-
strates for ASGPR. In the hypomorphic mouse, 
the LDL receptor is sialylated. Since this form of 
the receptor is more stable than that in wild-type 
mice, more particles of LDL cholesterol would be 
Figure 3. Relationship between the Effect of Sequence Variants on Non-HDL 
Cholesterol and on the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.
Shown are estimated odds ratios of the minor allele of sequence variants 
for coronary artery disease in Iceland among 33,090 case patients and 
236,254 controls as a function of the estimated effect of the minor allele 
on non-HDL cholesterol levels among 119,146 participants for whom data 
were available. In addition to the effect of del12 in ASGR1, the effects of 
variants that have an association with non-HDL cholesterol levels (as de-
rived from Do et al.29) are shown for comparison (Table S9 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). For the sequence variants with the largest effects, the 
affected gene is shown. Two genes — LPA and APOE — are each plotted 
at two points in the graph because there was more than one independent 
signal at those loci. The del12 variant in ASGR1 (in blue) is shown to have  
a stronger effect on coronary artery disease than predicted by its effect on 
non-HDL cholesterol levels. The error bars represent 95% confidence inter-
vals. The red line indicates the best linear-regression fit through the origin.

expected to collect on the surface of the hepato-
cyte, which would result in increased uptake of 
LDL cholesterol.35 Thus, reduced expression of 
Neu1 decreases the recycling of the LDL recep-
tor, which leads to enhanced uptake of LDL 
cholesterol by the liver. Both ASGPR and the 
LDL receptor are located in clathrin-coated pits 
(which often fold inward to form endosomes) on 
the surface of hepatocytes. Perhaps ASGPR inter-
acts with the asialylated form of the LDL recep-
tor, which leads to recycling of the receptor by 
hepatocytes through endocytosis. If this is the 
case, a paucity of functional ASGPR would be 
predicted to diminish the rate at which asialylated 
LDL receptors are removed from the cell surface.
In our study, we found that the ASGR1 del12 
variant, like variants in ANGPTL4 and LPA, has a 
larger effect on the risk of coronary artery dis-
ease than is predicted by its effect on levels of 
non-HDL cholesterol, which suggests that the 
atheroprotective effects of del12 go beyond the 
lowering of serum cholesterol levels. This addi-
tional atheroprotective effect would not appear 
to be mediated through an increase in levels of 
alkaline phosphatase or vitamin B12. Sialylation 
of chemokines or their receptors can influence 
the recruitment of inflammatory cells to athero-
sclerotic plaques,36-38 a finding that may be rele-
vant to the atheroprotective effect of del12.
In conclusion, we have identified rare loss-of-
function variants in ASGR1 that are associated 
with lowering of non-HDL cholesterol levels and 
a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. These 
variants disrupt ASGR1 function and represent a 
link between the sialylation pathway and athero-
sclerotic diseases.
