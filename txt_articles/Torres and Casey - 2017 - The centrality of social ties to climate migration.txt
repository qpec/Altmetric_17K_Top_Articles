The centrality of social ties to climate
migration and mental health
Jacqueline M. Torres1* and Joan A. Casey2
Abstract
Climate change-related hazards and disasters, known to adversely impact physical and mental health outcomes,
are also expected to result in human migration above current levels. Environmentally-motivated migration and
displacement may lead to the disruption of existing social ties, with potentially adverse consequences for mobile
populations as well as their family members who remain in places of origin. We propose that the disruption
of social ties is a key mechanism by which climate-related migration may negatively impact mental health, in
particular. Existing social ties may provide social and material resources that buffer mental health stressors related
to both prolonged and acute climate events. Preparation for such events may also strengthen these same ties and
protect mental health. Communities may leverage social ties, first to mitigate climate change, and second, to adapt
and rebuild post-disaster in communities of origin. Additionally, social ties can inform migration decisions and
destinations. For example, scholars have found that the drought-motivated adaptive migration of West African
Fulbe herders only occurred because of the long-term development of social networks between migrants and
non-migrants through trade and seasonal grazing. On the other hand, social ties do not always benefit mental
health. Some migrants, including those from poor regions or communities with no formal safety net, may face
considerable burden to provide financial and emotional resources to family members who remain in countries of
origin. In destination communities, migrants often face significant social marginalization. Therefore, policies and
programs that aim to maintain ongoing social ties among migrants and their family and community members may
be critically important in efforts to enhance population resilience and adaptation to climate change and to improve
mental health outcomes. Several online platforms, like Refugee Start Force, serve to integrate refugees by
connecting migrants directly to people and services in destination communities. These efforts may increasingly
draw upon novel technologies to support and maintain social networks in the context of population mobility due
to climatic and other factors.

Background
Humans have long migrated due to changing climates,
but have never before faced such rapid, global, anthropo-
genic change [1]. 2016 was the hottest year on record
and recent reports find accelerating sea-level rise [2]. If
high greenhouse gas emissions continue, oceans could
rise by as much as 6 ft by the end of the twenty-first
century [3]. Acute weather events, along with related
protracted environmental and economic changes may
contribute directly and indirectly to the dislocation of
populations [4]. From 2008 to 2015, climate and weather-
related disasters displaced an average of 22.5 million
people annually [5]. However, because migration and
climatic hazards are multi-causal, scholars have been
hesitant to attribute any single migratory flow to climate
change directly.
Nevertheless,
even
with
successful
adaptation–or
activities that reduce impacts from climatic changes, such
as crop substitution or new reservoir construction–climate
change is expected to result in some migration above
current levels [6]. Migration can also represent a positive
adaptation to climate change [7] when remaining in
place is no longer tenable; communities that face

 environmental hazards and lack the social or eco-
nomic resources to move may become “trapped” in
place [7].
Social ties are also a central driver of migration deci-
sions, given that information about the costs and benefits
of movement is transmitted in large part through pre-
existing social networks (i.e., multiple, connected social ties)
[8]. Social ties have also been linked to population health,
through protective mechanisms of resource sharing (i.e., so-
cial capital) and emotional support, as well as through
stress-inducing mechanisms of social and financial burden
[9]. In general, populations in motion may face stressors re-
lated to the disruption of their social networks, for example,
through separation from family and community members
due to migration or displacement. Mobile populations may
also face substantial social isolation and marginalization in
destination contexts. On the other hand, they may work to
maintain pre-existing social networks at a distance, by
sending remittances or making phone calls to family and
community members who remain in places of origin or
who have also migrated [10]. These social ties may serve as
a source of substantial resilience–or capacity to cope with
adverse events while maintaining function, identity, and
capacity to adapt, learn, and thrive–if they are characterized
by high levels of trust and support (i.e., social cohesion).
Social ties may have additional benefit when they provide
resources for coping both emotionally and economically in
the aftermath of climatic events.
Scholars and policy makers have identified numer-
ous health consequences of climate change, including
the spread of infectious disease, injury and death due
to acute natural disasters, heat-related illness, as well
as adverse mental health outcomes [11]. Discussion of
the health consequences of climate migration has
been more limited, but has included altered distribu-
tion of infectious diseases [12], increased violence
[13], and reduced access to healthcare [5].
Nevertheless, public health requires a richer under-
standing of the role of the social environment on health
before, during, and after climate migration. In this com-
mentary, we propose a framework that considers social
ties as both drivers and modifiers of climate migration
and the health outcomes of migrants (Fig. 1). We focus
our commentary on mental health, given the strong
empirical support for the link between social ties and
mental health outcomes and the relative absence of
literature discussing mental health in the context of
climate change [14]. Mental health, defined by the World
Health Organization as an overall state of wellbeing that
includes the ability to cope with daily stressors and make

 contributions to one’s family and community, is a
critical component of population wellbeing and prod-
uctivity [15].
Throughout the commentary we provide examples of
research on each component of our conceptual frame-
work (Fig. 1). We draw on a broad body of evidence, in-
cluding examples that are not directly related to climate
change, but that may provide an indication of what
might occur in the aftermath of acute and protracted
climatic events. This includes evidence of health and
mobility outcomes after earthquakes, or in the context
of labor or conflict-related migration flows. While we
incorporate examples from across the globe, we note
that vulnerability to climate change and climate migra-
tion is heterogeneous both across and within country
contexts. Low and middle-income countries are dispro-
portionately impacted by climate change, although they
have received relatively little economic benefit from the
activities that have fueled global warming [16]. Low-
income, rural populations are also at greater risk for the
loss of livelihoods due to climate change, while their
low-income urban counterparts face risk due to the fra-
gility of housing and infrastructure in poor urban neigh-
borhoods across the globe. We elaborate below on
specific population groups that may be more vulnerable
to adverse mental health outcomes as the result of cli-
mate migration and disrupted social networks. Finally,
we discuss the practical implications of the research on
climate change, social ties, migration, and mental health.
In particular, we highlight the potential for leveraging
novel technology in order to help maintain social ties in
the context of climate migration.
The link between climate change and social ties
Climate change is expected to impact social relation-
ships between family and community members (Fig. 1,
path 1 → 2). In large part, these effects are expected to
be negative. Reduced natural resources may lead to
increased competition among community members for
food, water, and livelihoods [17]. Acute climatic events
may result in the loss of family dwellings and commu-
nity meeting places, leading to reduced opportunity for
social interaction, and increased social strain [14]. On
the other hand, there is a strong call to acknowledge the
role of individual and community resilience and adapta-
tion in the face of climate change [18]. In particular,
climatic events might have the capacity to strengthen
family and community ties, provided there are oppor-
tunities to rebuild. Adaptation efforts prior to the onset
of acute disasters or the most damaging effects of
protracted climate changes may also provide opportun-
ities for strengthening social ties. For example, Mathbor
[19] describes that the Cyclone Preparedness Program
in
Bangladesh
provides
ongoing
opportunities
for
interaction and trust-building among local volunteers,
while also contributing to community preparedness
for frequent cyclones. Evidence from other settings
suggests that supportive community social ties (i.e.,
community social cohesion) serve as a source of re-
silience in the context of protracted and acute disas-
ters.
Social
ties
can
facilitate
the
exchange
of
resources (e.g., food, shelter) and information (e.g.,
early warnings regarding environmental risks), and in-
crease the likelihood of disaster preparedness [20, 21].
The importance of climate for migration
Although migration patterns are complex and multi-
causal, environmental conditions have always been an
important driver of individual and population-level mo-
bility [22] (Fig. 1, path 1 → 3). Nevertheless, rapid an-
thropogenic change in climate patterns and an increase
in climatic events are likely to contribute to population
mobility above current levels. In a recent example, Syria
experienced the most severe drought in recorded history
from 2006 through 2007, the result of both cyclical and
long-term declines in precipitation and groundwater.
The drought contributed to the collapse of small and
mid-scale agriculture and the migration of 1.5 million
Syrians from rural areas to urban peripheries [23]. While
no certainty exists regarding the direct, causal effects
of climate change on migration, in this and other
examples non-cyclical climatic change is a contribut-
ing factor, and climate-related resettlement has com-
menced globally [24].
Climate-related population mobility may take many
forms. Circular migration, defined as fluid movement
between countries, may entail short- or long-term moves
and is often linked to labor demands in places of destin-
ation [25]. Temporary or permanent movement of indi-
viduals or entire families may occur as the result of
either protracted or acute climatic events. In the most
extreme form, planned permanent resettlement may
lead to the relocation of entire communities, as with
low-lying coastal or island populations [26]. These
migration patterns are not mutually exclusive: in the
aftermath of the same climatic event, some members
of a community may temporarily move while others
may permanently resettle elsewhere if the economic
and social benefits of staying in their new location
outweigh the perceived benefits of returning home
[27]. Population mobility may also occur within countries
or internationally, although climate-related migration has
been linked primarily to internal (i.e., within-country)
migration [28].
Finally, environmental factors may intersect with other
micro- (e.g., family) and macro-level (e.g., national pol-
icy) circumstances to influence population mobility [29].
We discuss the intersection between environmental and
Torres and Casey BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:600

 social factors below. However, we note that political,
economic, and demographic factors may also critically
influence population vulnerability to climate change, and
environmental migration patterns. In charting the after-
math of the recent historic drought in Syria, Kelley and
authors [23] describe that the collapse of much of the
country’s agricultural production. Mass rural-to-urban
internal migration also occurred in the context of the
Syrian government’s restrictive economic policies that
exacerbated food shortages, as well an influx of Iraqi ref-
ugees that may have strained resources. The intersection
of climate change with these factors contributed to the
Syrian civil conflict, which has in turn triggered mass
population
displacement.
In
another
example
from
Pakistan, two consecutive years of flooding (2010–2011)
combined with deforestation and a nascent national dis-
aster response system, resulted in mass displacement of
150,000 people to relief camps [30].
The importance of social ties for climate-related
migration
Scholars have long emphasized the influence of social
ties on population mobility patterns (Fig. 1, path 2 → 3).
Individuals with prior migration experience serve as a
source of information about the migration passage and
expected outcomes (e.g., the availability of jobs) [8]. The
desire to reunify with family or community members
may also motivate migration. However, there is increas-
ing recognition of the intersection of social and environ-
mental migration drivers (Fig. 1, path 1,2 → 3). For
example, in West Africa, Bassett and Turner found that
drought-motivated adaptive migration of Fulbe herders
from the Sudano-Sahelian to the Sudano-Guinean region
only occurred because of the long-term development of
social networks between migrants and non-migrants
through trade and seasonal grazing [31]. In another ex-
ample, a study of the effect of rainfall patterns on
Mexican migration to the U.S. found that Mexican resi-
dents were more likely to migrate after years of drought
only if they lived in regions with historically high levels
of U.S. migration [32]. Individuals from these regions
likely had strong ties to migrant family or community
members, which facilitated the process of migration and
lowered the economic barriers to doing so. For individ-
uals living in regions with lower levels of prior U.S.
migration–and likely fewer social ties to individuals with
migration experience–drought actually predicted lower
out-migration, given that drought likely reduced the
economic resources necessary for migration.
Social ties can influence population mobility beyond
migration
for
labor
or
family
reunification.
In
an
example of environmentally-motivated migration, by the
early 1930s, over 60,000 people from Oklahoma had
resettled in California as part of the Dust Bowl migration
[33]. These early migrants guided new arrivals to find
housing, employment, and to integrate with the host
population. Similarly, during acute weather events, indi-
viduals may decide whether and where to move based
on information gathered from people in their social net-
works [34].
The relationship between social ties and environmen-
tal migration is not always direct and positive. It may be
complicated by specific characteristics of social relation-
ships and the ability of these ties to provide assistance.
Findings from research predicting environmentally moti-
vated internal migration within Bangladesh suggest that
having family and community members with previous
migration experience was associated with increased like-
lihood of making temporary rather than permanent
moves [35]. However, when respondents reported receiv-
ing financial assistance from family members living in
destination communities they were more likely to settle
permanently rather than engage in temporary, circular
migration patterns.
Migration and disrupted social ties
The very same social ties that shape population mobility
may be disrupted in the process of migration or dis-
placement (Fig. 1, path 3 → 4). Family and community
members may face temporary or long-term separation if
some move while others remain in places of origin [36].
In other cases, the process of fleeing acute disasters and
conflict may disperse family and community members.
Once separated, refugees and other displaced persons
may face substantial administrative barriers to reunifying
even with immediate family members in other countries.
For example, documents that serve as evidence of bio-
logical family connection and dependency (e.g., birth
certificates) may be lost or destroyed in acute disaster
settings [37]. Even if immediate family members can mi-
grate together or to reunite after separation, extended or
non-biological family and community members may be
geographically dispersed as the result of administrative
assignment
to
different
destination
countries
and
communities, as with refugee resettlement “lottery”
programs.
Migrants may maintain a connection to extended fam-
ily and community members by communicating through
letters, telephone and, increasingly, mobile applications
that allow for affordable video-conferencing and text
messaging [10]. These ongoing social connections may
be paired with continued economic connection; mi-
grants remitted $601 billion dollars in 2015 [38]. While
these remittances play a critical role in providing for the
basic needs of those who remain in places of origin, they
also can have important symbolic and emotional value
for connecting those who send and receive them [39].
Finally, migrants and displaced persons may in some
Torres and Casey BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:600 
Page 4 of 10
 cases make return visits to places of origin, although the
option to return may be limited by ongoing conflict in
places of origin or political barriers to mobility (e.g., for
undocumented migrants). On the other hand, places of
origin may no longer be safe to return to, or may no lon-
ger exist, as with low-lying island and delta regions that
are expected to be submerged by rising sea levels over
the course of the twenty-first century [26, 40].
In addition to facing the potential disruption of
extended family and community networks, migrants and
displaced persons face challenges to developing novel
social ties in destination communities. Migrants and dis-
placed
persons
often
face
societal
stigma
and
marginalization
as
well
as
social
isolation.
Social
marginalization may compound the lack of legal protec-
tions currently afforded to those displaced by climatic
factors. Indeed, those displaced by climate change are
not formally protected under international refugee law
[41] and may face limited options for political and social
integration into destination societies.
Migration, disrupted social ties, and adverse
mental health
Regardless of the stimulus for migration, recent litera-
ture finds some evidence of poorer mental health and
wellbeing among migrants and displaced populations
relative to populations of non-movers in countries and
communities of origin [42–44]. For example, a cross-
national study found that Mexican migrants to the U.S.
had higher levels of depression compared to their coun-
terparts who never left Mexico [45]. Migration may con-
tribute to adverse mental health outcomes through a
number of potential mechanisms, including exposing
populations in motion to traumatic circumstances along
the migration passage and discriminatory attitudes and
treatment in places of destination. Scholars have also
noted that there may be unique, adverse mental health
consequences of losing access to the natural landscape
[46].
Albrecht
and
authors
have
captured
this
phenomenon with the term “solastalgia” or a sense of
distress and melancholy related to the environmental de-
struction of one’s home [47].
Migration may also adversely impact mental health by
disrupting social and community connections (Fig. 1,
path 4 → 5). Separation from one’s close family mem-
bers due to a disaster or conflict may be an acute stres-
sor with both short and long-term impacts on mental
health outcomes. Disrupted social ties may contribute to
adverse mental health outcomes through mechanisms of
social isolation and reduced social and material (e.g.,
informational, financial) support [48]. Separation from
members of one’s origin family or community may also
lead to a reduced sense of belonging within a familial,
regional, or ethnic network, which may contribute to
poorer mental health [49]. Migration-related separation
may compound the impact of adverse experiences
related to climate change, including the trauma of acute
weather events, food and water insecurity, the loss of
one’s land or home, and reduced social cohesion as the
result of increased competition for basic resources such
as food and water [14, 50].
Nevertheless, the impact of migration on mental
health may vary. A study of Tongan migrants to New
Zealand, with rigorous attention to migration selection
based on mental health (i.e., the possibility that individuals
who move have systematically different pre-migration men-
tal health than non-movers), found evidence of significantly
improved mental health among migrants relative to those
who remained in Tonga [51]. Although, in this case, all
migrants moved with their immediate family members and
many explicitly cited an improved “social life” as their
motivation for migration. The mental health impacts of
population mobility may, therefore, depend on how disrup-
tive moves are to existing social ties, in addition to other
factors such as whether moves are temporary or perman-
ent, and the potentially traumatic exposures endured prior
to or during migration or displacement.
Social cohesion represents a key component in sup-
porting psychological outcomes of populations affected
by disasters and displacement. Using data collected both
before and after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Hikichi
and
colleagues
found
that
higher
levels
of
pre-
earthquake social cohesion were protective of post-
disaster adverse mental health outcomes [52]. Likewise,
individuals who were both displaced from their homes
after Hurricane Katrina and lived in counties with low
social cohesion, measured as an aggregate of individual
perceptions of community trust and support, had signifi-
cantly higher odds of past-month depression compared
to those who experienced only displacement or low
social cohesion [53]. Even in the absence of climate-
related migration or resettlement, these examples under-
score the benefit of strengthening social ties.
Migration, disrupted social ties, and the mental
health of those who remain
There may be adverse mental health consequences of
population mobility for those who do not move (Figure
1, path 4 → 5). In some cases, entire households may
migrate or be displaced. In other cases, some members
migrate temporarily or permanently to seek out alterna-
tive livelihoods while some family members remain
behind. Evidence is mixed on the effect of family mem-
ber migration or displacement on the health of those
who remain. On the one hand, the out-migration of
family members has been linked to increased depression
and other mental health disorders for those who
remain behind. For example, the Three Gorges Dam
Torres and Casey BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:600 
Page 5 of 10
 in China, built to provide renewable energy, forced
over a million people to relocate and degraded the
surrounding environment. Researchers found evidence
of a significant increase in depression in those who
remained behind during the Three Gorges Dam project
[54]. The results of the same analysis suggested that the ef-
fects of relocation on depression for those who remained
may have been partially mediated by changes in personal
resources, including household income and perceived social
support. On the other hand, researchers have also reported
no change in depression or even lower levels of depression
as the result of family member out-migration in other
contexts [55].
The adverse mental health consequences of migration-
related separation for those who remain in places of
origin may be compounded by other climate-related
vulnerabilities. These may include the loss of livelihoods,
lack of access to food and clean water, and civil conflict.
Environmental changes may degrade familiar landscapes,
cultural heritage sites, and alter patterns of socialization,
with negative implications for mental wellbeing even
among those who do not migrate [47, 56].
In the context of climate change, migration-related
economic
opportunities
may
become
of
increasing
importance to those who remain in places of origin as
livelihoods, food, and water supplies are threatened.
Remittances sent back to communities of origin may
support climate adaptation [57]. For example, migrants
and “hometown” organizations can support water and
irrigation projects in places of origin that may help indi-
viduals cope with the effects of climate change. Some of
these development projects, such as renewable energy ef-
forts, may have co-benefits for climate change mitigation.
Implications for practice and research
There are important practical implications that emerge from
an understanding of the centrality of social ties for popula-
tion mobility and population mental health. International
aid organizations are already involved in re-connecting fam-
ily members who have been separated by large-scale popula-
tion mobility or natural disasters. Historically, the Restoring
Family Links program through the International Committee
of the Red Cross has transmitted letters between refugees,
displaced persons, and their family members [58].
Mobile technologies have become increasingly critical
for refugees and migrants seeking to reunite with family
members in these acute disaster contexts [58, 59]. For
example, Google People Finder was used to locate
missing individuals in the aftermath of the 2011 earth-
quake in Japan. The United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) has developed RapidFTR (or Rapid Family
Tracing
and
Reunification),
an
open-source
mobile
phone application to help reunite children with their care-
givers in disaster settings (https://github.com/rapidftr/
RapidFTR/wiki). Another online platform, the Refugee
United Project, allows individuals to register in and search
through a database to trace missing family members.
Other technological advances, like unmanned aerial vehi-
cles that provide post-disaster communications networks
[60], may also support maintenance of social ties.
Collaboration
between
international
organizations,
national governments, and the private sector will further
serve to incorporate rapidly developing technological
advances into efforts to re-connect mobile populations
[58] as well as providing long-term resources for main-
taining everyday social and economic ties, given the
potentially protracted nature of many migratory flows.
For example, the World Bank has partnered with
national authorities to understand the potential for
leveraging mobile technologies to decrease the excess
cost of sending remittances, e.g., via smartphone applica-
tions that allow migrants to compare international
money transfer fees across multiple financial agencies
[61]. Again, remittances represent an important eco-
nomic connection between migrants and their family
and community members who remain in places of ori-
gin, but also have important symbolic value for family
members seeking to maintain social connection in the
aftermath of migration [39]. These collaborative efforts
should also include evaluation, as there is little empirical
evidence of the effectiveness of technology-driven strat-
egies for maintaining and/or strengthening social ties
disrupted due to migration or displacement.
Climate change may result in other large infrastructure
adaptation projects like sea walls and dams that displace
entire communities. Investments in enhancing commu-
nity social cohesion would benefit population mental
health both before and after individuals move. Evidence
from Three Gorges Dam suggests that even anticipating
the large-scale displacement of one’s community is
associated with significantly increased depression [62].
While other cases of planned resettlement have thus far
been rare, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has awarded its first grant aimed at reset-
tling an island-dwelling community in Louisiana. One of
the guiding principles for carrying out this voluntary
resettlement is that “activities must include building and
bridging social networks as part of the process and out-
come,” which if followed should benefit the mental
health of relocated individuals [63]. This case provides a
critical opportunity to track the impact of planned
climate-related resettlement on social ties and mental
health, and to evaluate policies aimed at maintaining
social networks throughout the resettlement process.
Even among those who have been temporarily displaced
by acute climate events, efforts may aim to maintain and
strengthen community social ties. For example, mental
health interventions targeting those who survived the
Torres and Casey BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:600 
Page 6 of 10
 2004 tsunami in India included individual therapy, but
also engaged community members in re-building and
activities that provided survivors with a sense of purpose
(e.g., caring for children) and generated social cohesion
[64]. Ongoing efforts must implement and evaluate pro-
grams that strengthen social cohesion in the face of lost
livelihoods and population mobility.
For those who are permanently displaced, public and
private-sector efforts may support social integration
within destination communities. Some qualitative evi-
dence suggests that mobile technologies may be critical
for facilitating social connection between newly arrived
refugees and those in the host societies [65]. Several
online platforms serve to integrate refugees into destin-
ation communities. With the slogan “connecting people,
creating networks,” Refugee Start Force (https://refu-
geestartforce.eu/) uses their online platform and groups
on networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to con-
nect refugees with professional opportunities in the
Netherlands. Airbnb, the popular online lodging rental
site, has created a response tool that when activated in the
aftermath of disasters allows hosts to open their homes to
displaced persons free of charge (https://www.airbnb.com/
welcome). In Germany, Help To (http://helpto.de/en)
offers a range of services to refugees including offers of
and requests for legal advice, donations, and transporta-
tion. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there is currently no
empirical evidence of the effectiveness of these programs.
Moreover, these novel efforts should not supplant public
policy efforts to integrate migrants and refugees, as there
is evidence of the causal effect of naturalization on
increased social integration, particularly for the most
marginalized migrants [66].
Strengthened social ties between migrants and those
living in destination or settlement communities might
have additional important co-benefits for population
health. For example, social isolation is a key risk factor
for heat-related health problems. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing
heat-related illness include buddy systems and formal
check-ins with vulnerable persons; efforts that draw in
part upon existing social ties among family and neighbors
[67]. Such network-building to address climate change
might also create greater community social cohesion, and
consequently, improve population mental health.
Special considerations for vulnerable populations
Certain populations are expected to face a dispropor-
tionate share of adverse health outcomes resulting from
climate
change
and
increased
population
mobility.
Climate change itself may also compound population
vulnerability over time as feedback loops erode eco-
nomic, social, and political conditions [68]. Indigenous
communities face particular threats related to food
insecurity and loss of native lands, although local know-
ledge may aid adaptation [69, 70]. Older adults in gen-
eral face greater health risks in the context of climate
change and older migrants may also experience high
levels of social isolation in reception communities and
reduced social support in places of origin if family
members migrate [71]. Children also face considerable
vulnerability in the context of climate migration, including
potential separation from primary caregivers and the
disruption of educational trajectories, which may, in turn,
have lasting, adverse mental health consequences [72].
For those living in poverty, efforts to facilitate continued
social and economic ties among mobile populations are
critical. Remittances sent from migrants to origin commu-
nities provide resources to those not covered by formal,
social safety net programs [73]. On the other hand, the ob-
ligation to remit may represent a substantial financial bur-
den for migrants, many of who are laboring in low-wage
sectors. While there is some evidence linking remittance
sending to improved mental health among remittance-
senders [74], others have reported the opposite effect [75].
Adverse mental health effects of remittance sending
appear particularly strong among women, who may bear a
larger burden of maintaining family networks and provid-
ing emotional and financial resources to family members
who have remained behind [49].
Conclusion
Although estimates remain uncertain, climate change is
expected to result in human migration above current levels.
This increased population mobility is a potentially import-
ant mechanism linking climate change and population
mental health. One pathway by which environmentally-
motivated migration may negatively impact mental health
is through the disruption of existing family and community
ties. The disruption of these social ties may adversely im-
pact migrants or displaced persons, potentially compound-
ing the effects of other adversities, including traumatic
experiences before and during the migration passage.
Disrupted social ties resulting from out-migration may
also impact those who remain in communities of origin,
including populations already facing the loss of livelihood,
natural landscapes, and cultural heritage sites as the result
of climate change. Reconnecting and strengthening social
ties in both origin and destination communities may in-
crease resilience and buffer some of the adverse mental
health impacts of acute and protracted climate events.
Relevant strategies may increasingly involve leveraging
novel technologies. Nevertheless, there is a need for rigor-
ous evaluation of the effectiveness of these technologies
for improving social cohesion and/or mental health for
mobile populations and their family members. In addition,
strategies to promote social connectedness should factor
in the potential for social and economic strain among

 migrants and displaced persons. In particular, the obliga-
tion to remit to family and friends who remain may repre-
sent a substantial financial burden for migrants.
The costs and effort related to supporting migrants and
displaced persons should reflect global responsibility for
the consequences of climate change. Indeed, environmen-
tal
injustice
led
to
anthropogenic
climate
change.
Greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change have
simultaneously propelled the economic growth of wealthy
countries and individuals [57]. Now, developing countries
and the poor will experience the greatest impacts, includ-
ing increased risk for displacement, disrupted social ties,
and adverse mental health consequences. It is a matter of
social justice to invest in the mental health of these popu-
lations in motion. This includes implementing strategies
that support and strengthen existing social ties as well as
efforts that enhance social integration within destination
communities for migrants who may be permanently
displaced from places of origin.
