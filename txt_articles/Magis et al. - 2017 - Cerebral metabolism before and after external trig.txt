Abstract
Background and aim: A recent sham-controlled trial showed that external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) is
effective in episodic migraine (MO) prevention. However, its mechanism of action remains unknown. We performed 18-
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to evaluate brain metabolic changes before and after
eTNS in episodic migraineurs.
Methods: Twenty-eight individuals were recruited: 14 with MO and 20 healthy volunteers (HVs). HVs underwent a
single FDG-PET, whereas patients were scanned at baseline, directly after a first prolonged session of eTNS (Cefaly�) and
after three months of treatment (uncontrolled study).
Results: The frequency of migraine attacks significantly decreased in compliant patients (N ¼ 10). Baseline FDG-PET
revealed a significant hypometabolism in fronto-temporal areas, especially in the orbitofrontal (OFC) and rostral anterior
cingulate cortices (rACC) in MO patients. This hypometabolism was reduced after three months of eTNS treatment.
Conclusion: Our study shows that metabolic activity of OFC and rACC, which are pivotal areas in central pain and
behaviour control, is decreased in migraine. This hypometabolism is reduced after three months of eTNS. eTNS might
thus exert its beneficial effects via slow neuromodulation of central pain-controlling areas, a mechanism also previously
reported in chronic migraine and cluster headache after percutaneous occipital nerve stimulation. However, this finding
needs to be confirmed by further studies using a sham condition.

Introduction
Migraine is a widespread, disabling neurological dis-
order characterised by recurrent attacks of moderate
to severe head pain associated with either digestive
signs and/or sensoriphobia (1). Drugs currently pre-
scribed for migraine prevention are not disease specific
and can have many intolerable side effects, causing a
high rate of discontinuation (2). Non-pharmacological
approaches are thus being developed as an alternative
to medications, and recently various non-invasive neu-
rostimulation therapies have joined the antimigraine
armamentarium (see Magis (3) for review). Among
them, external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS)
was found effective in episodic migraine (MO) preven-
tion.
In
the
randomised,
sham-controlled
trial
PREMICE, which included 67 patients with MO,
eTNS with the Cefaly� device in daily 20-minute ses-
sions for three months significantly decreased monthly
migraine days (–29.7%, þ4.9% in the sham group), and
the 50% responder rate was greater in the verum
(38.1%) than in the sham group (12.1%) (4). The
beneficial effect of eTNS in low-frequency migraine pre-
vention was also suggested by a small, open study
in 24 drug-naive migraineurs (5). A prospective registry

 involving 2313 patients showed that eTNS is a well--
tolerated and safe therapy with mild adverse events
reported by only 4.3% of the patients (6).
The precise mechanisms of action of eTNS in
migraine are currently unknown and all proposed the-
ories are speculative. The purpose of the present study
was to identify eTNS-induced short- and middle-term
modifications within the central nervous system using
18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET). There are few publications on functional
imaging in cranial nerve stimulation. Willoch et al. (7)
have investigated brain changes after invasive stimula-
tion of the trigeminal ganglion in patients with trigemi-
nopathic pain using H2
15O PET. After stimulations
lasting 30 to 50 minutes, but not after 60-second stimu-
lations, they observed a significant cerebral blood flow
increase in rostral parts of the anterior cingulate cortex
(rACC), and neighbouring orbitofrontal (OFC) and
medial frontal cortices, thus suggesting a potential
involvement of these brain areas in electrostimulation-
induced analgesia. In a previous clinical trial, we used
FDG-PET to study the central effects of percutaneous
occipital nerve stimulation (pONS) in 10 patients with
refractory chronic cluster headache (8). We found that
long-term pONS modulated the metabolism in the so-
called ‘salience neuromatrix’ (including the ACC) with
a significant hypermetabolism in the perigenual ACC in
patients improved by at least 50%. Using H2
15O PET,
Matharu et al. analysed the influence of pONS in patients
with chronic migraine and found cerebral blood flow
changes in the dorsal rostral pons, ACC, cuneus and
pulvinar (9). Finally, Kovacs et al. performed 3 Tesla
magnetic resonance imaging (3T-functional (f)MRI) in
a single healthy volunteer (HV) during pONS and
found activation in the hypothalamus, thalamus, OFC,
prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal grey (10).
These studies thus support an involvement of the
ACC and medial frontal regions in the neuromodula-
tion of cephalic pain. Whether it is causal or collateral
is not fully understood. In this study we hypothesised
that eTNS would induce similar changes within the cen-
tral nervous system.
Methods
Population
Twenty-eight individuals participated in the study: 14
patients with episodic migraine without aura (MO,
International Classification of Headache Disorders,
third edition beta (ICHD3 beta) criteria (1)) having
between four and 14 days of migraine/month (three
males, 11 females, mean age: 39 � 14 years) and
20 HVs of similar sex and age distribution (five males,
15 females, mean age: 36 � 11 years). Patients were
recruited by headache-specialised neurologists (DM
and JS) and came from the outpatient clinic of the
University Department of Neurology, CHR Lie
` ge,
Belgium. HVs were recruited through an announcement
on the university and hospital websites. They were inter-
viewed face to face before the recordings and filled in the
extended French version of the ID-Migraine question-
naire (11) to rule out any current or past history of
recurrent headaches. They were excluded if they had a
family history of headaches, chronic pain, psychiatric or
current systemic disorders and if they were taking medi-
cations regularly. MO patients had no other headache
disorder, no psychiatric or somatic disorder, nor regular
drug treatment except for the contraceptive pill. They
were not allowed to have prophylactic treatment since at
least two months before inclusion or to use opioid
derivatives as acute therapy, but were allowed to take
painkillers
and/or
triptans
for
migraine
attacks.
Moreover, none of the participants underwent PET
imaging and/or used eTNS before.
We conducted the study in accordance with the
Declaration
of
Helsinki,
version
2013.
Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants
and the local Ethics Committee approved the study.
Procedure
18-FDG-PET. The PET acquisitions were made in the
Nuclear Medicine Department of the CHU Sart-
Tilman, Lie
` ge, Belgium using a Gemini TF PET/com-
puted tomography (CT) scanner (Philips�, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands). Resting cerebral metabolism was
studied 30 minutes after intravenous injection of 150
MBq FDG. Blood glucose level was measured and
was
lower
than
150 mg/dl
in
all
individuals.
Participants were injected and scanned in a dark
room with minimal environmental noise. Images were
reconstructed using an iterative list mode time-of-flight
algorithm. Corrections for attenuation, dead-time,
random and scatter events were applied.
HVs had only one PET scan (PET1), whereas MO
underwent three PET scans: at baseline (before any
stimulation, PET1), immediately after a session of
eTNS (PET2), and after three months of daily eTNS
therapy (PET3, see Figure 1 flowchart). PET2 could not
be performed the same day as PET1 for technical and
safety reasons. Just before PET2 acquisition, MO
patients received in the Nuclear Medicine Department
a first prolonged eTNS session that lasted one hour and
started immediately after the 18-FDG isotope injection,
during the incubation period of 18-FDG, using a
pre-programmed Cefaly� device placed by the same
investigator (VDP) in order to ensure an adequate
stimulation. The PET2 acquisition was performed
immediately after the end of the first eTNS session.

Cephalalgia 37(9)
 The one-hour duration of this session was set after a
discussion with the nuclear medicine specialist. We
hypothesised that this duration would be potent enough
to induce brain metabolic changes detectable by the
FDG-PET scan technique. Finally, PET3 was conducted
at the end of the 12-week eTNS prophylactic therapy.
External trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS)
eTNS was delivered using the portable Cefaly� device
(Cefaly
Technology�,
Gra
ˆ ce-Hollogne,
Belgium).
Patients were stimulated for the first time in the hos-
pital before PET2 (see above) and thus trained to use
the device properly. Subsequently, they received a
Cefaly� device and were asked to apply eTNS at
home daily for 20 minutes for three months as prevent-
ive treatment (its use as acute therapy was not recom-
mended). Neurostimulation was administered with a
30 mm � 94 mm self-adhesive electrode placed on the
forehead and covering the supratrochlear and supra-
orbital nerves bilaterally (first trigeminal division).
The Cefaly� device provided to patients had a single
stimulation program (contrary to the commercially
available Cefaly� device, which has three programs
with different stimulation parameters). It generated
biphasic rectangular impulses with an electrical mean
equal to zero and the following characteristics: pulse
width 250 ms, frequency 60 Hz, and maximal intensity
16 mA. Built-in electronic software allowed recording
time of use per patient and hence verifying compliance
at the end of the study.
Eligible patients were asked to fill in headache dia-
ries for four successive months: one month of baseline
and three months with eTNS treatment. They recorded
headache occurrence, intensity (on a three-point scale:
1-mild to 3-severe), presence of nausea/vomiting, pho-
nophobia and/or photophobia and intake of acute
migraine drugs (analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans).
Data analysis
Clinical data provided by the migraine diaries were
analysed using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon paired
test or Friedman analysis of variance (ANOVA),
Statistica� version 8.0, StatSoft, France).
PET acquisitions were analysed using Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre
for
Neuroimaging,
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
implemented in MATLAB 7.4.0 (MathWorks Inc,
Sherborn, MA, USA). Images were spatially normal
ised into a standard stereotactic space using an MNI
PET template (Montreal Neurological Institute) and
smoothed using an 8 mm full-width-half-maximum
(FWHM)
isotropic
kernel.
We
performed
global
normalisation
by
applying
proportional
scaling.
Significance level of resulting SPM maps was set at a
p < 0.001 uncorrected, with an extended threshold of 20
voxels or a p < 0.05 using a family-wise error (FWE)
correction for multiple comparisons at a cluster level.
The FDG-PET analyses were performed by two inves
tigators blinded to diagnosis (KD and AT).
The first analysis identified brain regions that were
significantly hypo- or hypermetabolic in MO (n ¼ 11) at
baseline compared to HVs (n ¼ 20) using a two-sample
t-test. Three MO patients had been removed from this
analysis because they had a migraine attack the day of
PET acquisition, while the remaining 11 patients were
pain free for at least 48 hours. Age and gender were
entered as confounding covariates in the design matrix.
We subsequently repeated the analysis by excluding
two patients who had a history of acute medication-
overuse headache (MOH) up to six months before
PET1. Thus, the latter analysis was performed in
patients who were interictal and free from acute medi-
cation overuse.
We then performed t-tests to compare brain metab-
olism in MO before and after three months of treat-
ment, as compared to HVs. For this analysis, we

 included only patients who used eTNS at least one-
third of the recommended time (i.e. 10 patients). We
chose the 30% compliance threshold on an empirical
basis, having experienced from clinical practice and
previous trials (4,6) that patients may report a thera-
peutic benefit with non-daily use of the device. As
before, we excluded from the analysis three patients
who were in an ictal phase the day of the PET, which
left seven analysed MO patients.
Additionally, we performed a parametric analysis to
model the neuromodulatory effect of eTNS. The con-
trast modelling the effect of each variable within
the design matrix was set according to the expected
modulation of brain metabolism (i.e. PET1 patients:
–2; PET2 patients: –1; PET3 patients: þ1; PET1 con-
trols: þ2).
Finally, in a separate analysis without HVs, we com-
pared metabolism between PET1 and PET2, PET1 and
PET3, PET2 and PET3. In order to have reasonable
power, we included all 10 compliant MO patients in
this analysis and controlled for attack-related modifica-
tions by adding the factor ‘attack’ as a covariate in the
design matrix.
The WFU PickAtlas 2.5.2 (Wake Forest University,
NC, USA) was used as an anatomical reference.
Results
Clinical outcome
The clinical characteristics and outcomes of MO
patients are summarised in Table 1. There were no ser-
ious adverse events, neither during eTNS therapy, nor
during PET acquisitions. One patient dropped out
because she could not tolerate the paraesthesia due to
the stimulation. One patient did not return the device

Patient 1 used the device more than 30% of the time but sent the device back long after the end of the trial. Thus, her
compliance during the three months could not be assessed as she continued to use eTNS daily and the number of
recorded sessions was >150.
Patients in grey had a migraine attack during PET1. Patient 14 had an attack during PET2 only, and all patients were pain
free during PET3.

 and the diaries. The analysis of the number and dur-
ation of eTNS at the end of the study showed that 10
patients (71%) had performed at least 30% of the 90
recommended sessions. On ‘per protocol’ analysis these
patients had a significant decrease of monthly attack
frequency
during
treatment
(Friedman
ANOVA,
n ¼ 10; p ¼ 0.02), as well as between baseline and the
third
month
of
treatment
(4.2 � 1.1
to
2.6 � 1.2;
n ¼ 10; p ¼ 0.03). Five out of these 10 patients (50%)
had at least a 50% reduction of monthly migraine
attacks
and
were
considered
as
responders.
The
number of migraine days failed, however, to be signifi-
cantly lowered by eTNS (7.3 � 3.6 at baseline to
5.4 � 4.4 after three months, n ¼ 10; p ¼ 0.28), although
five out of 10 patients had at least a 50% reduction of
monthly
migraine
days.
There
was
a
significant
decrease of mean headache intensity during the first
and second month of eTNS therapy (Wilcoxon test,
n ¼ 10; p ¼ 0.05 and 0.01) and a trend for such a
decrease
over
the
three-month
treatment
period
(Friedman ANOVA, n ¼ 10; p ¼ 0.07). There was no
significant decrease of acute medication intake (9.4 to
7.2, n ¼ 9; p ¼ 0.27).
FDG-PET results
Baseline analysis (PET1) revealed that in MO patients
(N ¼ 11) fronto-temporal regions were hypometabolic
compared to HVs (threshold: p < 0.001 uncorrected,
20 voxels), especially the OFC and rACC (Table 2),
while motor areas were hypermetabolic. Only the
OFC hypometabolism remained significant after cor-
rection for multiple comparisons (pFWEcluster < 0.001,
Figure 2). Removing the data of the two patients with
a history of MOH between three and six months before
the first PET scan did not change the results.
In compliant patients who were headache free the day
of the scan (n ¼ 7), three months of eTNS therapy was
associated with reduced fronto-temporal hypometabo-
lism when compared to HVs (Figure 3). Furthermore,
the parametric analysis indicated a gradual normalisa-
tion of OFC/rACC metabolism (Figure 3).
Additional analyses assessing differences within the
migraine group across the three PET scans revealed
that a single one-hour session of eTNS (PET2 vs
PET1)
was
not
sufficient
to
significantly
change
brain glucose uptake at this threshold. By contrast,
metabolism in fronto-temporal regions significantly
increased after eTNS treatment, i.e. between PET3
and PET1, especially in the OFC (pFWEcluster ¼ 0.001)
(Figure 4).
There was no significant correlation between acute
medication intake and OFC metabolism at baseline. A
direct comparison of brain metabolism between respon-
ders (n ¼ 5) and non-responders (n ¼ 5) to eTNS
therapy failed to show a significant difference, probably
because of the small sample size.
Finally, we found no metabolic changes in subcor-
tical regions, nor in the brainstem or cerebellum.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the short- and long-
term effects of eTNS with the Cefaly� device on brain
metabolism using FDG-PET. To our knowledge, this is
the first study on the central effects of non-invasive cra-
nial nerve stimulation in headache. We found that glu-
cose metabolism was decreased in specific brain regions
of migraine patients at baseline and increased after a
three-month eTNS treatment. These changes were asso-
ciated with an overall clinical improvement after eTNS,
i.e. a decrease of migraine attack frequency and intensity.
At baseline before eTNS we found a pronounced
resting hypometabolism of the OFC and rACC (i.e. a
decrease of glucose uptake) in our sample of MO
patients. The rACC is known to belong to the endogen-
ous opioid pain control circuit (12), whereas the OFC is
involved in cognitive aspects of pain modulation.
Previous imaging studies in migraine have identified a
similar OFC hypometabolism, but mainly in chronic
migraine patients with MOH. Using FDG-PET in 16
MOH patients (13), we have described an OFC hypo-
metabolism that was even more pronounced three

 weeks after drug withdrawal, especially in patients
over-consuming combination analgesics. Such a dys-
function of a brain area involved in compulsive behav-
iour has also been reported after withdrawal in
substance abusers and alcoholics. In a recent MRI
study, Riederer et al. (14) showed with voxel-based
morphometry that persistent decrease of grey matter
OFC correlated with poor response to drug with-
drawal. Our patients’ sample comprised four patients
with a past history of MOH, two of them between three
and six months before the study, two others several
years before. Since it was shown in an fMRI study of
MOH patients that pain-induced hypoactivation of the
lateral pain system normalises completely six months
after drug withdrawal (15), we decided to reanalyse
PET1 data excluding those two patients with a recent
history of MOH. This did not change the finding of a
significant
hypometabolism
in
rACC
and
OFC
compared to controls, suggesting that it is not due to
the inclusion of patients with a history of MOH, but
genuinely associated with MO. This is further sup-
ported by the fact that the OFC hypometabolism was
not correlated with the amount of acute medication
intake.
Cerebral metabolism and function are known to
change significantly during a migraine attack (16)
including during premonitory symptoms and in pre-
frontal cortices (17). We have therefore excluded from
the analyses patients who had an attack during the day
of the PET acquisition. Though unlikely, patients who
had premonitory symptoms 24 hours before the head-
ache may have been included. They would not have
biased the results towards a frontal hypometabolism,
as in the H2
15O PET study by Maniyar et al. (17) the
premonitory phase was associated with increased activ-
ity in the OFC rather than hypoactivity. We found no

 metabolic changes in thalamus or brainstem. This could
be partly related to the methodology, as the templates
we used for PET acquisition and analysis were mainly
designed to study the cerebral cortex.
One may wonder why this frontal hypometabolism
has not been emphasised in MO before. A possible
explanation could be that most previous studies have
used H2
15O PET or other functional neuroimaging
techniques like fMRI or MR spectroscopy during sen-
sory
activation
or
nitroglycerin-triggered
attacks.
Interictal resting FDG-PET studies are scarce in MO.
FDG-PET reflects brain glucose metabolism and is sup-
posed to detect longer-lasting neurono-glial changes. It
was used, however, by Kim et al. (18) in another study
of episodic migraineurs. These authors report several
areas of hypometabolism including prefrontal cortices.
Although they do not report specifically such hypome-
tabolism in the OFC, they do so for the perigenual
ACC and the temporal cortex as found in our study.
They report a negative correlation with disease dur-
ation and with lifetime headache frequency. Besides
age, headache frequency, intake of acute medications,
quality of life impact or cultural imprints in pain per-
ception, a possible reason for some of the differences
between the study by Kim et al. (18) and our study
could be that our patients had a higher attack

compared to their patients, who had at the most five
attacks/month (60 per year).
Interestingly, a similar OFC hypometabolism using
FDG-PET was found in cluster headache and inter-
preted as reflecting impairment of top-down anti-
nociceptive pathways (19). Moreover, in an event-
related fMRI study repetitive trigemino-nociceptive
stimulation decreased activity of rACC and the pre-
frontal cortex over time in migraine patients, as
opposed to HVs, in whom it increased, suggesting an
alteration of the pain inhibitory circuitry in migraine
(20). Systematic reviews of morphological brain ima-
ging studies in patients with various migraine types
highlight grey matter loss in the frontal lobe propor-
tional to attack frequency or/and disease duration (21),
in the posterior insular-opercular regions, the pre-
frontal cortex, and the ACC (22). Brain connectivity
assessed by fMRI in MO patients is overall impaired
in regions involved in pain and cognitive processing
including the OFC (see Schwedt et al. (23) for a review).
As a second result, our study shows that the above-
described
baseline
resting
state
OFC/rACC
hypometabolism is attenuated after three months of
eTNS treatment in MO patients using the Cefaly�
device at least 30% of the recommended time. This
was paralleled by a significant decrease in attack fre-
quency. The change in OFC/rACC metabolism could
be due to the eTNS itself, to clinical improvement or to
intrinsic variability of the method. The latter is unli-
kely, since several studies, for instance the one by
Maquet et al. (24) have found good overall test-retest
stability and low intra-subject variability in glucose
metabolism assessed with FDG-PET (see review in
Schaefer et al. (25)). The fact that we found no meta-
bolic differences between eTNS responders and non-
responders does at first sight not favour a proper
effect of the neurostimulation. However, this must be
taken with caution, as our sample size was probably too
small to detect significant changes. In our previous
study of MOH patients, contrary to the present finding,
OFC hypometabolism worsened after drug withdrawal,
despite clear improvement of the headache (13). Since
mean acute medication intake did not change between
baseline and the third month of eTNS therapy, one can
rule out a role of medication use in the present study.

Cephalalgia 37(9)
 The change in OFC/rACC metabolism and the pro-
gressive reduction of migraine attack frequency with
eTNS might suggest that the treatment exerts a slow
central neuromodulatory effect – like other peripheral
nerve stimulations (26). For logistical and technical rea-
sons, the PET recordings could not be performed
during an eTNS session, unlike in some other studies
of pONS (9) or deep brain stimulation (27). As men-
tioned in the introduction, functional neuroimaging
studies in chronic cluster headache (8) and chronic
migraine patients (9) have shown that pONS is able
to increase to increase metabolism in central areas
belonging to descending pain control networks, includ-
ing the ACC, but leaves unchanged disease-specific
structures like, respectively, the hypothalamus (8) or
the dorsal pons (9). By the same token, long electrosti-
mulation of the trigeminal ganglion in patients with
trigeminal neuropathic pain increased regional blood
flow in the ACC, OFC and medial frontal cortices,
which was correlated with pain relief (7). Finally,
opioid and placebo analgesia are also associated with
increased activity of the OFC and rACC, suggesting a
common underlying mechanism (12). We cannot rule
out a placebo effect or a positive expectation phenom-
enon influencing OFC/rACC metabolism, but, with the
above-mentioned methodological reservation, this is
unlikely given the lack of difference between treatment
responders and non-responders. Moreover, our previ-
ous randomised, controlled trial (RCT) has demon-
strated that eTNS with Cefaly� is superior to sham
stimulation in MO prevention (4).
Our study has several shortcomings. Because of the
small number of evaluable patients, the results must be
taken with caution. As discussed, the study design does
not allow assessing a direct causal effect of eTNS on
brain metabolism since a sham condition is missing. We
found sham stimulation for three months would be
unethical knowing that there is evidence for eTNS
efficacy from an RCT (4). The compliance rate with
eTNS therapy was rather low. For preventive drug
treatments,
adherence
varies
from
48%
to
94%
between studies (28). Neurostimulation is more time-
consuming (20 minutes daily in our study), which pro-
vokes
lower
compliance.
In
the
PREMICE
trial
patients had a compliance rate of 62% (4), while par-
ticipants renting the eTNS Cefaly� device via the inter-
net used it on average 58% of the recommended time
(6). In this study we considered patients who performed
at least 30% of the sessions as ‘compliant’; this thresh-
old was chosen on an empirical basis and experience
from clinical practice showing that patients may benefit
from eTNS with non-daily use of the device. However,
the minimal time of use to obtain a clinical improve-
ment in migraine is unknown, and may vary between
patients. Although the headache diaries allowed moni-
toring global intake of acute medications for each
patient, they did not allow us to determine the precise
proportion of drugs taken within each of the pharma-
cological classes, analgesics, NSAIDs, triptans, nor its
possible change after eTNS. It is unlikely, however, that
such a change would have influenced brain metabolism.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that OFC and rACC are hypometa-
bolic in MO patients at rest. After a three-month treat-
ment with eTNS, this hypometabolism was reduced and
the changes were associated with a significant decrease
of migraine attack frequency. It is known that neuro-
stimulation can modulate OFC and rACC activity
(7,8). Like cluster (19) and MOH (13), MO seems to
be associated with dysfunction of medial frontal cortex
areas involved in affective and cognitive dimensions of
pain control. Because our study was underpowered and
had no sham arm, we are unable to formally attribute
the metabolic changes to the non-invasive neurostimu-
lation treatment. Nonetheless, the observed effect is
likely similar to that found with invasive neurostimula-
tion of pericranial nerves, such as pONS (8,9). Further
trials are needed to confirm these findings.
Key findings
. Orbitofrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices are significantly hypometabolic in episodic migraineurs
at rest compared to healthy controls.
. Episodic migraine, like chronic migraine with medication overuse, seems to be associated with a dysfunction
of medial frontal areas involved in affective and cognitive dimensions of pain control.
. A three-month preventive treatment with external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) is associated with
normalisation of this hypometabolism and significantly reduces migraine attack frequency.
. Assuming that the 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) changes are causally
related to eTNS, the effect on the medial prefrontal cortex seems similar to that reported after invasive
pericranial nerve stimulation therapies.
