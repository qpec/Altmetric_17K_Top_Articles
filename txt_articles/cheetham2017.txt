IMPORTANCE Controversy exists regarding the safety of testosterone replacement therapy
(TRT) following recent reports of an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between TRT and cardiovascular outcomes in men
with androgen deficiency.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted within an
integrated health care delivery system. Men at least 40 years old with evidence of androgen
deficiency either by a coded diagnosis and/or a morning serum total testosterone level of less
than 300 ng/dL were included. The eligibility window was January 1, 1999, to December 31,
2010, with follow-up through December 31, 2012.
EXPOSURES Any prescribed TRT given by injection, orally, or topically.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular
end points that included acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary revascularization,
unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association
between TRT and cardiovascular outcomes. An inverse probability of treatment weight,
propensity score methodology, was used to balance baseline characteristics.
RESULTS The cohorts consisted of 8808 men (19.8%) ever dispensed testosterone
(ever-TRT) (mean age, 58.4 years; 1.4% with prior cardiovascular events) and 35 527 men
(80.2%) never dispensed testosterone (never-TRT) (mean age, 59.8 years; 2.0% with prior
cardiovascular events). Median follow was 3.2 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.7-6.6 years)
in the never-TRT group vs 4.2 (IQR, 2.1-7.8) years in the ever-TRT group. The rates of the
composite cardiovascular end point were 23.9 vs 16.9 per 1000 person-years in the
never-TRT and ever-TRT groups, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the
composite cardiovascular end point in the ever-TRT group was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.73.
Similar results were seen when the outcome was restricted to combined stroke events
(stroke and TIA) (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84) and combined cardiac events (AMI, SCD,
unstable angina, revascularization procedures) (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60-0.72).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among men with androgen deficiency, dispensed
testosterone prescriptions were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes over
a median follow-up of 3.4 years.

S
tarting at age 30 years, testosterone levels decline by an
average of 3.1 to 3.5 ng/dL per year (to convert testoste-
rone to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347).1,2 Hy-
pogonadal testosterone levels are seen in 19% of men in their
60s, 28% of men in their 70s, and 49% of men in their 80s
(using a value of <325 ng/dL to define hypogonadal level).1 In
general, these declines are not associated with symptomol-
ogy, although in some men, symptoms of androgen defi-
ciency are pronounced. Symptoms of androgen deficiency
include loss of sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, breast en-
largementortenderness,hotflashes,reducedenergy(ie,weak-
ness, fatigue, malaise), irritability, and depressed mood. How-
ever,manymenwiththesesymptomsdonothavedocumented
low testosterone levels.3 The Endocrine Society therefore de-
fines androgen deficiency as consistently low serum testos-
teronelevels(morninglevelsmeasuredon>1occasion)incom-
bination with 1 or more androgen deficiency symptom.3
Androgen deficiency can be treated with exogenously ad-
ministered testosterone, resulting in improvement in symp-
toms of fatigue, muscle strength, body mass index, and
mood.3,4 Recently concern has been raised about testoste-
rone replacement therapy (TRT) owing to reports of adverse
cardiovascular (CV) events.5-7 However, not all studies have
found an association between TRT and an increased risk of
death or CV outcomes.8,9 In addition, there is a body of evi-
dencethatsuggestslowserumtestosteronelevelsinoldermen
are associated with increased CV risk and that TRT may have
CV benefits.10-12
Patient selection may have played a role in the findings
from studies showing an increased CV risk with TRT; Vigen
et al6 selected patients with low serum testosterone but a
high CV burden, and Finkle et al7 included patients based on
receipt of a new testosterone prescription without regard to
an androgen deficiency indication or low testosterone levels.
To address this issue, we studied TRT in men likely to have
androgen deficiency based on diagnoses or documented low
serum testosterone levels and assessed the association
between TRT and CV outcomes.
Methods
Design
This was a retrospective cohort study in men 40 years or older
with documentation of androgen deficiency at Kaiser Perma-
nente California. The primary comparison was between pa-
tients dispensed a new testosterone prescription and similar
individuals not dispensed TRT.
Setting
The study was conducted at 2 Kaiser Permanente (KP) regions
in California, KP Northern California and KP Southern Califor-
nia. Combined, these 2 KP regions have a current membership
of more than 7.8 million individuals. The demographic profile
of the KP membership is diverse and closely resembles the un-
derlying population of Northern and Southern California.13
Most medical care is provided through KP facilities, which
includes 35 hospitals (14 KP Southern California and 21 KP
Northern California hospitals) and approximately 445 outpa-
tient clinics (200 KP Southern California and 245 KP North-
ern California clinics). Beginning in 2006, all aspects of care
and patient interactions with the health care delivery system
are captured in an electronic medical record (EMR). The data
generated through the EMR are available for research pur-
poses and include information on membership and benefits,
demographic characteristics, dispensed prescriptions, coded
diagnoses and procedures, and laboratory test results. Data
prior to 2006 are contained in a comprehensive research data
warehouse that exists in each region. In addition, covered care
delivered in non-KP settings is captured by a claims reimburse-
ment system (ie, emergency department care). The study was
approved by the institutional review board at KP Southern and
KP Northern California; the institutional review boards waived
the requirement for written informed consent.
Patients
To be included in the study, men had to have evidence of an-
drogen deficiency either by a coded diagnosis in their medical
record or by serum testosterone laboratory testing. The follow-
ing criteria were used to define hypogonadism: (1) Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi-
fication (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes commonly used within KP
to specify androgen deficiency (257.2, 257.8, and 257.9) and/or
(2) serum total testosterone levels of less than 300 ng/dL.
Malepatientsmeetingtheandrogen-deficiencycriteriabe-
tween January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2010, were eligible
for inclusion in the study cohort; the cohort was then fol-
lowed through December 31, 2012. Within this time window,
the date of cohort entry was the first date indicating andro-
gen deficiency, either the first diagnosis date or the date of the
first low testosterone level. Patients were then classified into
ever-TRT or never-TRT groups based on their receipt of a dis-
pensedtestosteroneprescriptionfollowingtheindexdate.The
analysiswasrestrictedtoincidentTRTbyexcludingthosegiven
testosterone prescription(s) prior to their index date. Eligible
men also needed to have 12 months of continuous member-
ship with drug benefit prior to cohort entry and to be 40 years
or older at index. Patients were excluded if they had testicu-
lar or prostate cancer, pituitary gland disorders, androgen in-
sensitivity syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome. Patients were
followeduntiltheyreachedastudyendpoint,disenrolledfrom

Key Points
Question What are the cardiovascular risks of testosterone
replacement therapy (TRT) in men with androgen deficiency?
Findings When use in androgen-deficient men with documented
low morning testosterone levels, TRT was not associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. During long-term
follow-up the risk of cardiovascular outcomes was lower in
testosterone-treated men.
Meaning These findings support the use of TRT in
androgen-deficient men.

Testosterone Exposure
Two sources were used to capture testosterone usage by eli-
giblemen.First,dispensedtestosteroneprescriptionswerecol-
lected from the KP electronic pharmacy records, and second,
data were collected for injectable testosterone (cypionate and
enanthate) administered in the medical office and docu-
mented in the EMR. The comprehensive research data ware-
house has electronic pharmacy records going back to 1996 for
both KP regions.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite that included the fol-
lowing 4 CV events: (1) acute myocardial infarction or a coro-
nary revascularization procedure, (2) unstable angina, (3) com-
bined stroke (ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
[TIA]), and (4) sudden cardiac death. Outcomes were identi-
fied from inpatient hospitalizations, using ICD-9-CM diagno-
sis codes and procedures based on Current Procedure Termi-
nology codes. The diagnosis codes for acute myocardial
infarction, unstable angina, and stroke needed to be in the pri-
mary position (principal diagnosis code) for it to be consid-
ered an outcome. For TIA, an inpatient or emergency depart-
mentICD-9-CMcodewasdeemedacceptable.Thecriteriaused
to identify CV outcomes have been validated in KP and simi-
lar systems and are associated with high positive predictive
values.14-20 Identification of sudden cardiac death was based
on a previously published algorithm21 and using KP internal
death information along with state death certificate data. De-
tails of the definitions, codes, and criteria used to identify each
outcome are included in the eTable in the Supplement.
Baseline Conditions and Comorbidities
To control for baseline comorbidities in the analysis, general
demographic information (age, race, median household in-
come from US census block data), diagnosed CV risk factors
(congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipid-
emia, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), other
conditions of interest (obstructive sleep apnea, depression,
erectile dysfunction), a comorbidity score (Elixhauser
score),22,23 and baseline laboratory testing results (testoste-
rone levels, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin) were cap-
tured. Race information from the research databases is
determinedusingacombinationofpatientself-reportandclini-
cal and administrative databases. This information was col-
lected because TRT and CV outcomes can vary by race.
Statistical Analysis
For the primary analysis, the population of androgen-
deficient patients was restricted to those with a morning tes-
tosterone level, defined as a blood test prior to 11:00 AM. Base-
line characteristics for the eligible androgen-deficient men are
summarized using descriptive statistics. A comparison be-
tween the ever-TRT and never-TRT groups was made by con-
ducting t tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for cat-
egorical variables.
AmultivariableCoxproportionalhazardsregressionanaly-
sis was conducted to investigate the association between TRT
and CV outcomes. In all of the multivariable models, TRT was
treated as a time-varying variable to account for time delays
from the index date to initiation of TRT. A propensity score
methodology (inverse probability of treatment weight [IPTW])
was used to balance baseline characteristics between the ever-
TRT and never-TRT groups. The IPTW procedure generates the
estimated conditional probability of receiving TRT (the expo-
sure of interest).24-26 Table 1 contains all of the measured char-
acteristics used to create the IPTW model. Missing data (ie,
laboratory test results) were included in the IPTW procedure
so that men without a baseline PSA test results in the ever-
TRT cohort would be weighted similar to those of men with-
outabaselinePAStestinthenever-TRTcohort.AftertheIPTW,
event rates from each group were calculated for all of the out-
comes. For the final Cox model, clinically important vari-
ables,suchasage,indexyear,baselinetestosteronevalues,and
CV comorbidity (congestive heart failure, diabetes, hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, prior CV events), were included. The ap-
proach, combining outcome regression after weighting by the
propensity score, is called “doubly robust” estimation.27 The
value of this approach is that the effect estimator is still ro-
bust to misspecification of the IPTW model or main regres-
sion model. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for predictors of CV out-
comes from the final proportional hazards regression model
are reported.
Separate analyses were conducted for each cardiac out-
comes (acute myocardial infarction, revascularization, un-
stable angina, and sudden cardiac death), stroke outcomes
(stroke plus TIA), and all-cause mortality. Stratified analyses
focused on men younger than 65 years and 65 years or older
and on men with and without baseline CV disease comorbid-
ity (defined as those with diagnosed congestive heart failure,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and prior CV
events). Sensitivity analyses restricted follow-up to 90 days,
180 days, and 365 days of time and also restricting the analy-
sis to those with a baseline testosterone level less than
300 ng/dL. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided P <.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 129 544 men were identified as having androgen de-
ficiency either by diagnosis or having a low testosterone level.
Of these individuals, 44 335 met the age and eligibility require-
ments for inclusion in the primary analysis; the final popula-
tion consisted of 8808 men (19.8%) ever dispensed TRT and
35 527 (80.2%) never dispensed TRT. For this population 97.1%
(43 049 of 44 335) entered the cohort based on a serum tes-
tosteroneleveloflessthan300ng/dL,and2.9%(1286of44 335)
were entered into the cohort based on a diagnosis of andro-
gen deficiency. Patients who entered the cohort based on a se-
rum testosterone level could have a subsequent diagnosis of
androgen deficiency. The Figure provides breakdown of pa-
tient disposition by inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The largest proportion of men (39.6% [17 570 of 44 335])
was 40 to 55 years old, and 29.2% (12 964 of 44 335) were older

than 65 years (Table 1). Rates of treatment for androgen-
deficient men steadily increased over time from 15.6% from
1999 to 2000 to 23.6% from 2009 to 2010. Stratified by age
categories,thetreatmentratewassimilarformen40to55years
old and 56 to 65 years old but was lower in category of those
older than 65 years. Overall, 51.6% of the prescriptions were
for injectable products, 34.7% for testosterone gel, and 13.6%
for testosterone patches. For the treated patients, 76% (6694
of 8808) received 2 or more testosterone prescriptions, and in
these patients the mean (SD) duration of TRT was 925 (819)
days. A higher percentage of whites and those with a median
household income greater than $80 000 received a testoste-
roneprescription.Ingeneral,priortoIPTWadjustment,CVrisk
factors were higher in the ever-TRT group at baseline. Excep-
tions to this were diabetes (23.3% in the never-TRT vs 22.0%
in the ever-TRT groups) and CV events at baseline (2.0% in the
never-TRT vs 1.4% in the ever-TRT groups). Although statis-
tically significant, the absolute differences between groups
prior to IPTW were not large. After IPTW adjustment, the bal-
ance in baseline characteristics between the ever-TRT and
never-TRT groups was improved (Table 1).
In patients receiving TRT, the serum testosterone levels in-
creased from a median of 212 ng/dL (IQR, 160-253 ng/dL) at
baseline to 318 ng/dL (IQR, 237-435 ng/dL) during follow-up.
Following IPTW adjustment, a higher percentage of compos-
ite CV events were seen in the never-TRT vs the ever-TRT
groups, 10.2% (3650 events) vs 8.2% (711 events), respec-
tively,duringamedianof3.4yearsfollow-up(IQR,1.7-6.5years;
mean, 4.4 years). The rate of composite CV events was 23.9 per
1000person-yearsinthenever-TRTgroupvs16.9per1000per-
son-years in the ever-TRT group.
TheproportionalityassumptionsweremetfortheCoxpro-
portional hazards model. The adjusted HR for the composite
CV outcome in the ever-TRT group was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-
0.73) (Table 2). We further explored whether a different pro-
pensity score model approach, without doubly robust estima-
tion, produced consistent results. When applying only IPTW
weighting, but not adding covariates to the multivariable Cox
model, the HR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.73), which is consis-
tent with the main results. The HRs for the cardiac (acute myo-
cardial infarction, revascularization procedures, sudden car-
diac death, and unstable angina combined) and combined
stroke (stroke and TIA) outcomes were similar to those of the
primary analysis (Table 3). For the combined stroke outcome
the HR was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62-0.84) and for the cardiac out-

Discussion
In this study of androgen-deficient men, TRT was associated
with a decreased risk of CV events. These results were consis-
tent in analyses stratified by age, the presence or absence of
baseline CV risk factors, and in a sensitivity analysis in which
follow-up was restricted to the first 90, 180, or 365 days. While
these findings differ from those of recently published observa-
tional studies of TRT, they are consistent with other evidence
of CV risk and the benefits of TRT in androgen-deficient men.
Low serum testosterone levels in aging men have been as-
sociated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.28-30
Other studies have reported an inverse relationship between
serum testosterone and carotid intima thickness.31-33 Testos-

These data lend support to the findings that TRT is associated
with lower rates of adverse CV outcomes in androgen-
deficient men.

TRT in men with low testosterone levels.8,9 Shores et al8

Sharma et al9 studied the relationship between normalization
of testosterone levels following TRT and all-cause mortality
and CV events in men with low testosterone levels at base-
line. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on receipt of
TRT and whether serum testosterone level normalized in the
TRT cohorts (ie, no treatment, TRT with normalization of
serum testosterone, and TRT without normalization of serum
testosterone).9 Compared with no treatment or TRT without
normalization of serum testosterone, patients receiving TRT
with normalization of serum testosterone had a lower risk of
all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke (ad-

receiving TRT who normalized their serum testosterone com-
pared with no treatment).9
The results of this study are counter to 2 other observa-
tional studies that found a higher risk of adverse CV out-
comesinpatientsreceivingTRT.6,7Vigenetal6selectedapopu-
lation of men with low testosterone levels who had undergone
coronary angiography and found that the risk of adverse CV
outcomes was elevated (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.58). Ques-
tions have been raised about the analysis and study findings
given the fact that the unadjusted rates of adverse CV out-
comes were twice as high in the untreated cohort (21.2%) vs
the treated cohort (10.1%).10 The patients studied by Vigen
et al6 also had a high CV disease burden based on study
eligibility criteria; at baseline 92.5% had hypertension, 88.0%
had hyperlipidemia, 55.4% had diabetes, 54.4% were obese,
and 23.7% had a prior myocardial infarction. Using a large
health care claims database, Finkle et al7 conducted a self-
controlled case series analysis (in which individuals served
as their own controls) to study nonfatal acute myocardial in-
farction in the 90 days following a testosterone prescription
relative to the rate prior to the prescription. The postprescrip-
tion vs preprescription rate ratio for nonfatal acute myocar-
dial infarction was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.03-1.81).7 Serum testoste-
rone levels were not available, and the analysis was not
restricted to those with a diagnosis of androgen deficiency;
therefore, these results may not be generalizable to patients
with an indication for TRT. Moreover, if having a nonfatal MI
influences the likelihood of receiving a testosterone prescrip-
tion, the results from this type of analysis may be biased.
It has been reported that 25% to 40% of men receiving tes-
tosterone prescriptions do not have baseline testosterone lev-
els measured.38,39 The lack of baseline testosterone testing in
patients receiving TRT is a concern. In the primary analysis,
men with a baseline serum testosterone level greater than
400 ng/dL had a higher adjusted HR for the composite CV out-
come (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.06-2.54) compared with those with
lower baseline testosterone. While the data from this study are
preliminary and only a small percentage of patients had a base-
line testosterone level greater than 400 ng/dL (0.4% in the
never-TRT vs 0.8% in the ever-TRT cohorts), these findings
suggest caution when using TRT in men with normal testos-
terone levels.
Limitations
There are several potential limitations that need to be consid-
ered when evaluating the results of this study. First, the cri-
terion for identifying androgen-deficient males (≥1 morning
testosterone level or a diagnosis) does not meet the strict
criteria set forth by the Endocrine Society.3 Therefore some
individuals in this study could be misclassified as being
androgen-deficient. Obtaining 2 or more testosterone levels
prior to initiating TRT does not seem to be common in clinical
practice. Layton et al39 reported that 40% of patients treated
withtestosteronehadnobaselinetestosteronelevels,50%had
a single test, and only 10% had multiple tests prior to treat-
ment initiation. In the current study, 6% of patients had mul-
tiple testosterone tests done before initiating treatment.
Second, owing to the observational design of the study,
unmeasured confounding may have had an influence on the
results; unmeasured confounders could possibly influence cli-
nicians to selectively use testosterone in healthier patients.
Among measured confounders, however, the patients who re-
ceived testosterone had a higher disease burden (Elixhauser
Index) and higher percentages of common CV comorbidities.
Moreover, the time frame for this study was prior to reports
about CV risk, limiting the risk of confounding by indication.
Third, not all of the possible CV risk factors, such as diet, ex-
ercise, and family history, are easily retrievable from the EMR
and were therefore not included in the analysis. This, how-
ever, is true for both the ever-TRT and never-TRT cohorts, and
any bias would likely be nondifferential. Fourth, a competing
risks analysis was not conducted. Although the androgen-
deficient cohort had high rates of CV comorbidities, they were
relatively young, and other causes of death were not consid-
ered substantial. In addition, separate analyses were con-
ducted for cardiac and stroke outcomes that necessitated gen-
eration of distinct subcohorts to accommodate the change in
censoring events and the findings remained consistent. Fifth,
ascertainment bias could exist if patients dispensed TRT were
followed more closely that those without TRT. While this is a
possibility, men in both the ever-TRT and never-TRT groups
had higher rates of CV comorbidities than the general popu-
lation and therefore were seen frequently in the clinic by their
primary care and physician specialists. Sixth, dose and dura-
tion of testosterone use were not designed into the analysis,
primarily because studies finding an increased CV risk postu-
lated that this was an acute effect of testosterone.7 Given the
underlying mechanisms associated with CV risk, additional
studies should be conducted to determine the impact of tes-
tosterone dose and duration. Seventh, some untreated pa-
tients may have been misclassified owing to use of outside
pharmacies to obtain their TRT. To minimize this, the analy-
sis was restricted to those patients with a drug-benefit that
provides member incentives to obtain their prescriptions
at a KP pharmacy.
Conclusions
Among men with androgen deficiency, dispensed testosterone
prescriptions were associated with a lower risk of CV outcomes
over a median 3.4 years of follow-up.
