People want to live long, healthy lives. Previous surveys suggest very limited interest in
much longer lifespans, but we show that stipulating good health changes responses to
favor longer lives by an order of magnitude. Advances in aging research hold out hope
for greatly slowed aging with associated good health. Understanding the public’s desires
correctly is important to avoid misallocation of resources for research.
Keywords: survey research, life extension, public policy, public opinion, lifespan
Recent advances in aging research and regenerative medicine may soon translate into dramatically
increased human lifespans. But does the American public want to live longer? Popular press argues
the answer is no, e.g., a recent survey on desired lifespan reported in the New York Times found
60% of respondents voted for the shortest option, an 80 year lifespan, while fewer than 1% opted
for an unlimited lifespan (Duncan, 2012). Here, we show that negative attitudes to longer lives are
a consequence of erroneously equating extended life with an extended period of frailty. When we
stipulated continued health to the original survey question, responses dramatically favored longer
life: only 20% wish to die at age 85, while 42% want an unlimited lifespan. Since funding for aging
research depends on its perceived value, better science communication is needed to align public
policy with public interests.
We surveyed 1000 individuals (through “Ask Your Target Market,” http://aytm.com/) about how
long they wished to live (to age 85, 120, 150, or indefinitely), under 3 scenarios: (1) sustained
mental and physical youthfulness, (2) mental youthfulness only, (3) physical youthfulness only.
While responses to the two partial youthfulness conditions recapitulated the results of previous
surveys (Cicirelli, 2011; Kogan et al., 2011; Partridge et al., 2011; Duncan, 2012; Pew Research
Center, 2013), i.e., most responders (65.3%) wished to live to age 85 only—under scenario (1)
the pattern of responses was completely different. When guaranteed mental and physical health,
797 of 1000 people wanted to live to 120 or longer, and 53.1% of the 797 desired unlimited life
spans. Furthermore, 70.1% of the people who responded 85 to scenario (2) or (3) changed their
answer to 120 or longer in scenario (1). Full survey response data are publicly available from: http://
healthextension.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AYTM-Results.csv.
The fraction of people who changed their answer from 85 to 120 or longer was significantly
higher among people with some interest in science (445/622 vs. 13/31, p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact
test), and this was the main predictor of changing the answer to favor longer life. Less significant
correlations were found with other surveyed variables such as age, health status, and self-esteem.
Similar results were recently reported for Canadians (Dragojlovic, 2013): 59% of 1231 respondents
wished to live to 120 (the maximum age included in that survey), and science orientation was the
strongest predictor of support for life extension.

Public Desires Extended Healthy Lifespan
We also reproduced our primary finding—that most people
wish to live far longer than the average human lifespan so
long as they stay healthy—using Google Surveys (McDonald
et al., 2012). In this replication cohort of 1500 respondents,
we found that 74.4% wished to live to 120 or longer if health
was guaranteed, but only 57.4% wished to live that long if it
wasn’t. Full survey data and results are publicly available in
an interactive browsable format from: https://www.google.com/
insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=rkiemlpdkjgfe.
A recent survey by the Pew foundation (Pew Research Center,
2013) found a basic result similar to other prior work: 56%
of people would not want medical treatments to slow aging
vs. 38% who would. Interestingly, this survey also asked what
respondents thought other people would do, finding that 68%
thought most others would choose such treatments (vs. 27%
who did not). Future work to explore this discrepancy should
investigate whether most people perceive a difference in likely
future health of others vs. themselves in the context of longer
lives. The Pew survey also found that more people thought radical
slowing of aging would be bad for society (51%) than good (41%).
Future work should test whether this too would reverse under
stipulation of youthful health.
Results from The Human Memome Project (HMP)—a project
to survey longevity predictors, socio-cultural information and
attitudes to longevity—show that attitudes to long life are not
just positive in North America, but that globally, citizens show
positive attitudes to long life (Calimport and Bentley, 2013).
175/394 participants from crowdsourcing and citizen science
communities definitely wanting to live as long as possible
and 97/394 participants probably wanting to live as long as
possible. 189/394 participants stated that they definitely valued
their lifespan and that of others highlighting the value of
lifespan for citizens. The HMP data for those that opted in
to the open science dataset are available on ResearchGate
at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256460492_HMP_
Open_Science_Dataset_04092013.
The public wants to live long, and live healthy. Human
supercentenarians give some of the best evidence for the
possibility of increased healthspan and healthy aging, or
compression of morbidity (Fries, 1980). For example, looking
at all age-related diseases in aggregate, Andersen et al. (2012)
found that supercentenarians suffered from these only for the
last ∼5% of their lives, while controls were sick for ∼18%.
Making healthy aging a reality for the rest of the population
will be scientifically challenging. Nevertheless, it is becoming
increasingly more necessary: chronic age-related diseases account
for 75% of Medicare spending, and these numbers are projected
to rise as baby boomers age [10]. The NIA currently receives less
than 1% of the NIH’s overall annual budget, or less than 0.05%
of annual Medicare spending; this is a misallocation of resources
(Stipp, 2012). There is a growing demand for more awareness
and more funding for basic aging research, and new initiatives
such as the Healthspan Campaign (http://healthspancampaign.
org/) and the trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group (http://sigs.
nih.gov/geroscience/) are helping lead the way forward. Investing
in scientific research and development that targets aging, the
process underlying multiple chronic diseases, can offer uniquely
high potential returns.
