Abstract
Because there are currently no biological treatments for deafness, we sought to advance gene 
therapy approaches to treat genetic deafness. We reasoned that gene delivery systems that target 
auditory and vestibular sensory cells with high efficiency would be required to restore complex 
auditory and balance function. We focused on Usher Syndrome, a devastating genetic disorder that

 causes blindness, balance disorders and profound deafness, and used a knock-in mouse model, 
Ush1c c.216G>A, which carries a cryptic splice site mutation found in French-Acadian patients 
with Usher Syndrome type IC (USH1C). Following delivery of wild-type Ush1c into the inner ears 
of neonatal Ush1c c.216G>A mice, we find recovery of gene and protein expression, restoration of 
sensory cell function, rescue of complex auditory function and recovery of hearing and balance 
behavior to near wild-type levels. The data represent unprecedented recovery of inner ear function 
and suggest that biological therapies to treat deafness may be suitable for translation to humans 
with genetic inner ear disorders.
Introduction
Hearing loss affects ~250 million people worldwide, with an estimated half of those cases 
being due to inherited genetic mutations. Recent success using gene therapy in the inner ears 
of animal models provides proof-of-principal that the approach may be used to restore 
function for genetic deafness in humans. However, progress thus far has been limited and 
has failed to restore the exquisite sensitivity of the healthy mammalian inner ear. A 
significant short coming has been the lack of efficient vectors that target large numbers of 
sensory hair cells in the inner ear. For example, AAV2/8 vectors that encoded wild-type 
whirlin lead to rescue of inner hair cell (IHC) morphology but not outer hair cells (OHCs) or 
hearing function1. IHCs comprise about 25% of total auditory hair cells. The other 75% are 
OHCs, which are required to enhance the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the inner 
ear. In another study, AAV2/1 vectors injected in Tmc1 mutant mice, targeted 80–90% of 
IHCs and revealed moderate auditory rescue with minimal ABR thresholds of ~80 dB (8 
kHz)2. Using a similar viral capsid and promoter that drove expression in just IHCs, yielded 
partial recovery of auditory function (thresholds ~60 dB at 8 kHz) in mice that lacked the 
IHC gene Vglut33. While these studies have demonstrated exogenous gene delivery into 
auditory IHCs, gene delivery to OHCs has remained a challenge. Because many genes that 
cause deafness are expressed in both IHCs and OHCs, gene delivery methods that target 
both cell types are needed to restore complex auditory function. Among the genes expressed 
in both cell types are those that encode Usher Syndrome proteins.
Usher syndrome (USH) is a rare genetic condition that affects 16,000 to 20,000 people in the 
United States and is responsible for 3 to 6% of early childhood deafness4,5,6. Of three 
subtypes, Usher type I (USH1) is the most severe form. USH1 patients suffer profound 
sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular areflexia and progressive blindness. Unless fitted with 
a cochlear implant, USH1 patients do not recover auditory function or develop the ability to 
generate speech. Six genes are associated with USH1: MYO7A (myosin 7a)7,8,9,10, USH1C 
(harmonin)11,12, CDH23 (cadherin 23)13,14, PCDH15 (protocadherin 15)15,16,17, SANS 
(sans)18 and CIB2 (calcium and integrin binding protein 2)19. USH1 proteins are involved in 
morphogenesis of sensory hair bundles and are localized to the apex of hair cells in 
mechanosenosory hair bundles. Harmonin resides at the core of an USH1 interactome where 
it binds to other USH1 proteins. The USH1C gene includes 28 exons, which code for 10 
alternative splice forms11,12, grouped in three different subclasses (a, b and c) depending on 
the domain composition of the protein. In hair cells, harmonin is expressed during early 
postnatal stages but expression declines around postnatal day 30 (P30). The harmonin-b

 splice form is found at the tips of stereocilia near the tip-link insertion point in mouse hair 
cells20,21,22 where it plays a structural role and is likely required for sensory transduction in 
both auditory and vestibular hair cells 20,23. Harmonin-a is localized at the synapse where it 
associates with Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels and limits channel availability through an ubiquitin-
dependent pathway24,25.
Of several mouse models for Usher syndrome characterized over the past decade, only one, 
Ush1c c.216G>A, reproduces both auditory and retinal deficits that typify human Usher I 
Syndrome. The Ush1c c.216G>A mutation affects expression of all conventional harmonin 
isoforms due to a point mutation similar to one found in a cohort of French-Acadian USH1C 
patients26. The mutation introduces a cryptic splice site at the end of exon three in the Ush1c 
gene and results in translation of a severely truncated protein27. Homozygous Ush1c c.
216G>A mice (c.216AA) suffer from severe hearing loss at one month of age 28, while 
heterozygous c.216GA mice do not present any abnormal phenotype. Cochlear histology in 
c.216AA mice reveals disorganized hair bundles and loss of both inner and outer hair cells in 
middle and basal turns at P3028.
To identify a therapeutic window for treatment, we studied the function and maintenance of 
hair cells in newborn c.216AA mice. Our data show that a large majority of c.216AA hair 
cells survive and remain mechanosensitive during the first postnatal week. Since reduced 
expression of full-length harmonin is the most likely cause of deafness in USH1C c.216G>A 
patients27, we investigated whether early re-introduction of full-length harmonin in c.216AA 
hair cells would preserve hair cell and auditory function in homozygous c.216AA mice. We 
found that a synthetic adeno associated viral vectors (Anc80L65)29 encoding harmonin-a or 
-b successfully transduced larger numbers IHCs and OHCs and drove harmonin expression 
and correct protein localization. Early postnatal round window membrane injection of 
harmonin vectors successfully restored auditory and vestibular function to near wild-type 
levels in otherwise deaf and dizzy c.216AA mice. Our results demonstrate that early re-
introduction of wild-type harmonin with vectors that efficiently target inner and outer hair 
cells can improve auditory sensitivity by over a thousand-fold, relative to first generation 
inner ear gene therapy approaches.
Results
Hair cell survival in Ush1c mice
Homozygous c.216AA mice are deaf and show circling and head tossing behaviors 
characteristic of vestibular dysfunction28. At 1 month of age, there is pronounced inner and 
outer hair cell degeneration at the base of the cochlea and degeneration and hair cell death in 
the middle turn, while the apical portion of the organ is better preserved28. To assess hair 
cell survival at earlier stages, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis 
along the organ of Corti at P8 and P18. Outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) 
of heterozygous c.216GA mice were preserved and their bundles were properly oriented 
(Fig. 1a–c, g, i and Supplementary Fig. 1a–c, k). However, disorganized hair bundles were 
evident along the entire length of the organ of Corti in homozygous c.216AA mice at both 
ages analyzed (Fig. 1d–f, h, j–l and Supplementary Fig. 1d–j, l). At P8, IHC bundles were 
mildly disorganized at the base, mid and apical regions (Fig. 1d–f, j). While many OHCs of

 c.216AA mice possessed well-preserved hair bundles (Fig. 1h, k), fragmented and 
disorganized hair bundles were evident sporadically along the organ (Fig. 1d–f, l). 
Disruption was more pronounced at P18, although the majority of hair cells were still 
present as previously reported30 (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f).
To assess hair cell function at early stages, we analyzed uptake of FM1-43, a compound that 
permeates functional mechanosensitive channels31,32,33, in inner ear organs at P4. Uniform 
FM1-43 uptake was observed in hair cells of c.216GA mice (Fig. 2a), but uptake varied 
among OHCs of c.216AA mice, suggesting that some, but not all, cells retained functional 
channels (Fig. 2b). FM1-43 uptake decreased in IHCs of c.216AA mice during the first 
postnatal week (not shown). In utricle hair cells of c.216AA mice, uptake was restricted to 
the extra-striola region at P6, suggesting that hair cells of the striola region lacked 
mechanosensitive channels open at rest (Fig. 2c, d).
Sensory transduction in Ush1c hair cells
Next, we assessed mechanotransduction currents in IHCs, OHCs and vestibular hair cells 
(VHCs) of c.216GA and c.216AA mice during the first postnatal week. 
Mechanotransduction currents were recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration in 
response to mechanical displacements of hair bundles by a stiff glass probes. In c.216AA 
mice, recordings were obtained from the middle and apical turns of the cochlea from P3 to 
P6. OHCs retained mechanosensitivity, although the amplitudes of the responses were 
reduced by ~63% to 170 ± 80 pA (n=24; p<0.001, Fig. 2e–g). Severely disorganized bundles 
had smaller currents than better preserved hair bundles (120 ± 65 pA, n=9 and 201 ± 74 pA, 
n=15, respectively). Despite the reduction in current amplitude, c.216AA OHC sensitivity to 
mechanical displacements was similar to that of heterozygous c.216GA hair cells (Fig. 2f, 
Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Similarly, while hair bundles from IHCs of c.216AA mice appeared only mildly disrupted 
under the DIC microscope, transduction currents were significantly reduced at P6 (Fig. 2e–
g). Maximum transduction currents in heterozygous c.216GA IHCs (P6-P7) averaged 587 
± 96 pA (n=21) but were reduced by 46% to 316 ± 127 pA (n=19; p<0.001) in c.216AA 
IHCs. c.216AA IHCs showed a significant (p<0.01) reduction in sensitivity (Supplementary 
Fig. 2g). Adaptation, or the decline in transduction current in the presence of constant 
bundle deflection, was also present, but the rate and extent of adaptation was reduced in c.
216AA hair cells relatively c.216GA cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c–e, h–j). These results 
demonstrate that mechanosensitivity is mildly compromised in inner and outer hair cells of 
c.216AA mice and, importantly, that both cell types survive throughout the first postnatal 
week, a prerequisite for gene therapy and restoration of cellular function.
Vestibular hair cells of c.216AA mice also showed a reduction in mechanotransduction 
currents. In the extra-striola region, currents were significantly (p<0.001) reduced to 109 
± 30 pA (n=9, P5-P7) versus 231 ± 53 pA (n=8, P6-P7) for c.216GA currents (Fig. 2e, f, h). 
Very small or no currents were evoked from hair cells of the striola region (6 ± 13 pA, n=6, 
P5-P7), in agreement with the absence of FM1-43 uptake in that region (Fig. 2c,d). In 
conclusion, while utricle hair bundles appeared grossly well-preserved, transduction currents 
were significantly reduced in the extra-striola and absent in the striola.

 Exogenous harmonin rescues sensory transduction in Ush1c hair cells
To assess whether AAV vectors can drive expression of exogenous harmonin splice forms, 
we exposed P1 utricles and organs of Corti from neonatal c.216AA, c.216GA and wild-type 
(C57BL/6J) mice to AAV2/1 vectors encoding EGFP fused to the N-terminus of harmonin-
b1 (EGFP::harmonin-b1) or tdTomato fused to the N-terminus of harmonin-a1 
(tdTomato::harmonin-a1). Hair cells of wild-type, c.216GA and c.216AA mice were 
successfully transduced in vitro (Fig. 3a–c, e). EGFP::harmonin-b1 signal was evident at the 
tips of the stereocilia in VHCs (Fig. 3a), IHCs and OHCs (Fig. 3b, c). EGFP signal was also 
detected at P60 in OHCs and IHCs in the basal portion of the cochlea of mice injected at P1 
(Fig. 3d). TdTomato::harmonin-a1 was detected at the base of auditory hair cells (Fig. 3e). 
Co-staining with a ribbon synapse marker CTBP2 frequently revealed colocalization in P7 
IHCs (Fig. 3e) but not in P7 utricles (data not shown). Localization of our exogenous fusion 
constructs was consistent with previous work that localized harmonin-b to the distal end of 
stereocilia, near the tip-link insertions20,21,22, and harmonin-a to the synapse24,25.
Next, we assessed function in c.216AA hair cells exposed to AAV vectors driving harmonin 
expression.
To enhance the likelihood of functional rescue, we packaged untagged harmonin-a1 or 
harmonin-b1 coding sequences driven by a CMV promoter into AAV2/Anc80L6534. We 
performed RWM injections at P1 of AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and separately a 
mixture of AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 + AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and 
assessed mechanotransduction responses 2 weeks after treatment. Although mature OHCs 
(>P10) do not survive ex-vivo recording experiments, robust electrophysiological recordings 
were obtained from IHCs at the equivalent of P14-P16 (Fig. 4). While IHCs from uninjected 
mice displayed severely reduced transduction currents at P16 (79 ± 43 pA, n=8), significant 
recovery (***P<0.001) was observed in mice injected at P1 with harmonin-b1 or a 
combination of harmonin b1 and a1, with respective average maximal transduction currents 
of 388 ± 66 pA (n=15) and 352 ± 28 pA (n=7; Fig. 4c). Transduction current amplitudes in 
IHCs after treatment with harmonin-b1 or the combination of harmonin b1 and a1 were not 
significantly different from those of control c.216GA mice. These results suggest that 
delivery of exogenous harmonin-b1 via RWM injection at early stages can restore 
mechanotransduction in IHCs.
Rescue of auditory brainstem responses in Ush1c mice
To investigate rescue of auditory and balance function in Ush1c mice, we performed P0-P1 
RWM injections of AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 and/or AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and later assessed auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), 
distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), acoustic startle reflexes, open field and 
rotarod behavior. Mice were assessed at six weeks, a stage at which c.216AA mice show 
profound hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Some of the mice were further tested at 3 
and 6 months. None of the 12 mice injected with AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 
recovered auditory function at 6 weeks (Fig. 5a–c), suggesting exogenous expression of 
harmonin-a1 was insufficient for auditory rescue. However, 19 of 25 mice injected with 
AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 recovered significant auditory function (ABR

 thresholds < 80 dB) at 6 weeks. The reason for lack of rescue in six of 25 mice was not 
clear, but may have been due to failed injections, clogged injection pipettes or injections that 
missed the targeted perilymphatic space. At low frequencies (5.6 to 16 kHz), the lowest 
ABR thresholds in AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 injected ears were 25–30 dB, 
remarkably similar to thresholds of wild-type mice (Fig. 5a–b). Partial rescue was observed 
at 22.6 kHz and little to none at 32 kHz. Rescue of DPOAE thresholds was also evident (Fig. 
5c) at low frequencies, consistent with rescue of OHC function. Eight of the mice that 
possessed auditory thresholds <45 dB for stimuli 8–11.3 kHz were tested at later stages to 
assess the longevity of the rescue. From 6 weeks to 3 months, ~10 dB ABR threshold shifts 
were observed in the low frequency range and ~30 dB in the high frequency range (Fig. 5d). 
A similar shift was also observed in the DPOAEs thresholds (Fig. 5e). After this time point, 
ABR and DPOAE thresholds remained stable up to 6 months (Fig. 5d–e), the latest time 
point tested.
To assess whether both harmonin-a1 and harmonin-b1 are required for more complete 
auditory rescue, particularly at the high frequency end, we co-injected two vectors, each 
driving expression of one splice form of harmonin. To confirm that both were targeted to the 
hair cells, AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.tdTomato::harmonin-a1 and AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.EGFP::harmonin-b1 were co-injected at P0-P1 (0.5μl + 0.5 μl). 65% of the 
hair cells expressed both harmonin-a1 and harmonin-b1, as evident from cells positive for 
both fluorescent tags (Supplementary Fig. 3). Fluorescently labeled harmonin-a1 was 
occasionally observed in the stereocilia of mice exposed to AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.tdTomato::harmonin-a1, perhaps due to over expression. ABR and DPOAE 
thresholds in mice co-injected with unlabeled harmonin-a1 and harmonin-b1 vectors (Fig. 5) 
were similar to those of mice injected with harmonin-b1 alone, suggesting that harmonin-a1 
may be dispensable for auditory function. Notably, harmonin-b1 alone was sufficient for 
significant restoration of auditory thresholds at low frequencies (Fig. 5).
To further characterize the rescue, ABR waveforms from mice with thresholds ≤45 dB were 
analyzed and compared between eight control c.216GA mice and five c.216AA mice 
injected with AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1. The analysis of waveform at 8, 11.3 and 
16 kHz revealed normal wave 1 amplitudes, relative (non-significant differences, P>0.2, 
Student t-test) and longer peak 1 latencies (P>0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting a 
possible lag in neurotransmission at the synapse.
In many animals, auditory rescue was also observed in the contralateral ear, with ABR 
thresholds as low as 20 dB at 11.3 kHz (harmonin-b1: average 59.7 ± 5.3 dB, n=15/25; 
harmonin-a1+-b1: average 76.2 ± 10.3 dB, n=4/6). Diffusion of AAV vectors to the 
contralateral ear has been previously observed35 and likely occurs via the cochlear aqueduct.
To determine whether injections at a later developmental stage might lead to partial auditory 
rescue, we performed RWM injections of AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 (0.8 μl) at 
P10-P12 and assessed auditory thresholds at 6 weeks. None of these mice had detectable 
DPOAEs, and their ABR thresholds did not differ from the uninjected c.216AA control mice 
(n=10; data not shown).

 To address the concern that truncated harmonin, a consequence of the c.216G>A mutation, 
may disrupt function by competing with full-length harmonin for endogenous binding 
partners28,30, we generated Anc80L65.CMV.trunc-harm vectors that over-expressed the 
truncated protein and injected them via RWM into the inner ears of c.216GA mice. ABR and 
DPOAES measurements at 4, 6 and 12 weeks revealed no difference in thresholds between 
injected and uninjected c.216GA mice over the entire frequency range (Fig. 5b–c). These 
data, which also serve as a control for the injection technique and the vector, suggest that 
exogenous truncated harmonin does not compete with endogenous full-length harmonin.
Rescue of auditory and vestibular behavior in Ush1c mice
To assess whether the ABR/DPOAE recovery yielded behaviorally relevant recovery of 
auditory function, we measured acoustic startle responses in subsets of mice injected with 
AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1, AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1, or both vectors. 
Startle response to white noise showed partial rescue in 6 week old mice injected with 
AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and in mice co-injected with both vectors (Fig. 6a). 
Mice that received harmonin-a1 alone were similar to uninjected c.216AA mice and did not 
recover startle responses.
Since the perilymphatic space is continuous between the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth, 
AAV vectors injected via RWM may transduce vestibular sensory organs. To assess 
vestibular behavior, we tested performance of subsets of mice on a rotarod over five trials. 
While poor rotarod performance was observed in c.216AA and c.216AA mice injected with 
AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 (latency to fall <22 sec on average), c.216AA mice 
injected with AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and those co-injected with harmonin-a1 
and -b1 vectors maintained balance function on the rotarod for 60–120 seconds, consistent 
with control c.216GA mice (Fig. 6b). We also observed mice in a 42 cm wide open-field 
chamber for 5 min. Recovery in open-field behavior was evident in harmonin-b1 and dual 
harmonin-a1 and b1 injected c.216AA mice. Representative open-field exploration traces are 
plotted in Fig. 6c. c.216GA mice explored the border of the field and displayed minimal full-
body rotations, whereas c.216AA mice displayed more activity throughout the entire 
chamber with increased full-body rotations quantified as rotations/min (Fig. 6d–e). 
Surprisingly, while no ABR rescue was observed in mice injected with AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1, open field data demonstrated recovery of normal behavior to 
the level of the control mice.
Hair bundle morphology in rescued Ush1c mice
We assessed hair bundle morphology with SEM in 6-week old mice that displayed rescue of 
auditory function. c.216AA mice displayed severe hair cells loss at the basal and middle 
regions of the organ (Fig. 7e–f). In the basal region, OHCs were mostly absent in the first 
row and present sporadically in the second and third rows. In the middle region of the organ, 
the first row of OHCs was also largely absent. Milder phenotypes were observed in the 
apical end. High magnification SEM also revealed severely disorganized hair bundles along 
the entire length of the organ of c.216AA mice. Notably, in 6-week old c.216AA mice, no 
hair bundles were observed that retained the typical staircase structure with all three rows of 
stereocilia (Fig. 7h). Instead hair bundles were disorganized, with retracted stereocilia along

 the first row, abnormal second row and fairly preserved tallest row. In contrast, reduced hair 
cell loss and normal hair bundle morphologies were observed in c.216AA mice that showed 
recovery of function after treatment with harmonin-b1 (Fig. 7i–l, n–p). Hair cells counts 
were estimated from the presence or absence of hair bundles in representative fields of view. 
The data revealed pronounced preservation of hair cell numbers in injected mice from the 
base to the apex of the organ, from 40 to 79% in the base, 68 to 95% in the middle and 93 to 
99% in the apex (n=1824 cells from n=4 c.216AA mice and n=792 from n=2 rescued c.
216AA ears) (Fig. 7m). Although abnormal hair bundles were still evident in harmonin-b1 
injected mice, most hair bundles possessed three rows of stereocilia and had morphology 
almost indistinguishable from that of their heterozygous controls (Fig. 7i, n, p).
Harmonin expression correlates with hair cell survival and ABR thresholds
To confirm expression of AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 and explore the relationship 
between viral expression level and ABR thresholds, we quantified DNA and RNA isolated 
from individual injected and contralateral cochleas. Expression was assessed in six-week old 
c.216GA and AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 injected and non-injected c.216AA mice. 
Mouse Ush1c RNA expressed from the AAV1/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 vector 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a) and AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 DNA (Supplementary 
Fig. 5b) were detected in all of the injected cochleas and, to a lesser extent, in the 
contralateral cochleas of injected animals. There was variability between animals in ABR 
thresholds and amount of DNA and RNA expressed (Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, we 
found a strong correlation between AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 DNA levels, the 
amount of mRNA encoding the correctly spliced form of harmonin and ABR threshold 
levels, which suggests that the variability in ABR data may be a direct result of AAV 
expression. Absent or poor AAV expression levels likely resulted from failed RWM 
injections. To confirm that harmonin was expressed in rescued ears, we performed harmonin 
immunostaining in rescued cochleas as well as cochleas harvested from wild type, c.216AA 
and c.216AA mice with failed rescued. Specific harmonin labeling was observed at 
stereocilia tips in wild type and rescued ears but was absent in uninjected c.216AA ears and 
injected but not rescued c.216AA ears (Supplementary Fig. 5d).
To assess long-term hair cell survival in mice that had successful recovery of ABR 
thresholds, we prepared tissue and counted the number of IHCs and OHCs at 6 months of 
age from 5 mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). While the number of IHCs did not vary in the two 
cohorts, 50% or more OHCs remained in the three mice that showed long term ABR rescue. 
OHC survival was observed along the entire organ with the exception of the basal turn 
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Discussion
While previous work has shown that homozygous knock-in c.216AA mice have significant 
hair cell degeneration at P18 and P3027,28, in early postnatal c.216AA mice, we found 
altered hair bundle morphology, yet functionally viable hair cells, revealing a potential 
therapeutic window. During the first postnatal week, auditory and vestibular epithelia 
retained mechanosensitive hair cells, including some with relatively normal morphology

 (Fig. 1). Transduction currents were diminished in amplitude but many auditory hair cells 
retained characteristics within the normal range for adaptation and sensitivity 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). In the vestibular system, c.216AA hair cells in the extra-striola 
region had reduced current amplitudes, whereas cells in the striola region did not take up 
FM1-43 and did not respond to bundle displacements (Fig. 2). Therefore, with the exception 
of the striola region, our results suggest that the transduction apparatus can be correctly 
assembled and targeted in mutant mice but that the number of functional complexes appears 
to be reduced during the neonatal period. Since a small percentage of correct splicing still 
occurs in c.216AA mice30, we hypothesize that even low expression levels of wild-type 
harmonin may be sufficient for partial development and short-term maintenance of the 
transduction apparatus in homozygous c.216AA mice during early postnatal stages, allowing 
for an expanded therapeutic window. In contrast, previous work has shown that full 
knockouts of Ush1c have transduction currents that were nearly absent by P723 which we 
predict would limit the window for intervention.
We showed that AAV2/1 vectors successfully targeted hair cells and that harmonin fusion 
constructs were correctly localized (Fig. 3). EGFP::harmonin-b1 was targeted to the tips of 
stereocilia when transfected with AAV vectors in wild-type or mutant auditory or vestibular 
tissues, consistent with prior localization studies23. The harmonin-a1 variant is localized 
near the ribbon synapse where it interacts with CaV1.3 channels to alter exocytosis24,25. 
While expression of tdTomato::harmonin-a1 packaged in AAV2/1 was observed at the base 
of the IHCs and was absent from stereocilia, higher expression levels obtained with AAV2/
Anc80L65 led to diffuse localization throughout the cell and in the stereociliary bundle. 
TdTomato::harmonin-a1 was also observed throughout the utricle, excluded from stereocilia 
and showed little colocalization with ribbon synapse markers at P7. While this may be a 
consequence of the tagged fluorescent marker, it is also possible that harmonin-a1 plays a 
different role in the utricle or that localization differs in more mature epithelia.
We studied whether expression of multiple harmonin isoforms are needed for full functional 
rescue in auditory and vestibular organs. Since harmonin-b plays an important role in the 
stereocilia and harmonin-a has been shown to alter exocytosis, we suspected that both splice 
forms would be necessary to rescue inner ear function. However, co-injection of harmonin-
b1 and harmonin-a1 did not enhance recovery. Thus, harmonin-b1 alone was sufficient to 
restore partial function. ABR responses in rescued mice showed normal wave 1 amplitudes 
and longer peak 1 latencies relative to normal hearing controls (Supplementary Fig. 4), the 
latter perhaps due to an incomplete functional recovery at the synapse.
Auditory rescue was prominent at low but not high frequencies (Fig. 5), while hair bundles 
with normal morphology were observed along the entire organ at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 7). 
The absence of rescue at high frequencies is unlikely to have been caused by damage from 
the injection as high-frequency hearing loss was not observed in any injected c.216GA mice 
(Fig. 5b–c). Poor transduction efficiency at the base26 is also an unlikely explanation given 
AAV targeting along the entire length of the cochlea29. It is possible that other harmonin 
isoforms, such as harmonin-c, may be necessary for rescue of function in the basal high 
frequency end of the cochlea. Alternatively, since cochlear development begins at the basal

 end, by P0 these hair cells may have matured beyond the point of repair. If so, embryonic 
intervention36,37 may be more effective.
In behavioral assays, harmonin-a1 mediated partial vestibular rescue (indicated by reduced 
circling behavior), whereas harmonin-b1 enabled more complete functional recovery in both 
vestibular tests (reduced circling and enhanced rotarod performance; Fig. 6). The absence of 
transduction and FM1-43 uptake in the striola regions argues that hair cells of the striola 
region and perhaps type I cell function depend on proper harmonin expression (Fig. 2). 
Further studies are needed to clarify the role of harmonin in the vestibular system. 
Additional assays of vestibular function, such as vestibular evoked potentials, may provide a 
physiological measure of the extent of rescue.
A previous study30 restored function in early postnatal Ush1c mice using intra-peritoneal 
injection of antisense oligonucleotides targeting c.216AA. Another report corrected Ush1c 
gene expression in mice with the same antisense oligonucleotide delivered to the amniotic 
cavity38. An advantage of the antisense approach is that all splice forms may be expressed, 
however repeated injections may be needed to maintain long-term rescue. AAV vectors, on 
the other hand, can provide long-term transgene expression in post-mitotic tissue even in the 
absence of genome integration39,40. Our results obtained at 12 and 24 weeks suggest that 
this may indeed be the case in inner ear hair cells. Both strategies have now provided 
compelling evidence that gene therapy can be further developed to treat Usher Syndrome 
type 1C for patients who have the 216G>A splice site mutation and possibly other USH1C 
mutations.
In summary, our data provide further support for development of viral-mediated gene 
transfer in the inner ear to treat disorders that affect sensory hair cells. Here, using a vector 
with high transduction efficiency in both IHCs and OHCs, we show the most complete 
rescue of auditory function for any inner ear gene therapy application to date with over a 
thousand-fold improvement in sound pressure level sensitivity (thresholds ~25 dB at 8 kHz), 
relative to prior studies2,3. Furthermore, we show the most complete gene therapy recovery 
of vestibular function in a genetic model of combined auditory and vestibular dysfunction. 
Translation of these successes to the clinic will likely necessitate optimization of the 
delivery vectors, promoters and coding sequences, validation of the viral targeting and 
efficacy in larger animal models in vivo, and perhaps in human tissue in vitro, as well as a 
better understanding of the therapeutic window in humans. Lastly, while conventional AAV 
vectors have a good safety profile, next generation AAVs, such as Anc80L65, have not yet 
been evaluated in humans and thus will require careful scrutiny before wide-spread 
application.
Online Methods

Ush1c c.216G>A knock-in mice were obtained from Louisiana State University Health 
Science Center. The imported strain while on a C57BL6 background were previously bred 
out of the Cdh23 (Ahl) mutation causing age related hearing loss41,42. All procedures used 
for this work met the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were

 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Boston Children’s 
Hospital (Protocols# 12-02-2146, #14-03-2659R and #15-01-2878R). Mice were genotyped 
using toe clip (before P8) or ear punch (after P8) and PCR was performed as described 
previously26. For all studies, both male and female mice were used in approximately equal 
proportions. No randomization paradigm was otherwise applied.
Tissue preparation
Utricle and organ of Corti from Ush1c c.216G>A heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice 
were harvested from postnatal day 0 to 8 (P0 to P8) for electrophysiological studies. 
Postnatal mouse pups were killed by rapid decapitation. The temporal bones were excised 
and bathed in MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4). 
The organ of Corti was dissected away without the use of enzyme as described previously43. 
Utricles were removed after 10 min protease treatment (Protease XXIV, Sigma) at 0.1 
mg/ml. The excised organs were mounted on round glass coverslips. A pair of thin glass 
fibers previously glued to the coverslip was placed on the edge of the tissue to stabilize it in 
a flat position. Tissues were either used acutely or kept in culture in presence of 1% Fetal 
Bovine Serum. Cultures were maintained for 7 to 10 days and the media was replaced every 
2 to 3 days for experiments that involved viral vectors infection in vitro.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM was performed at P7, P18 and ~P42 (6 weeks) along the organ of Corti of control and 
mutant mice. P18 SEM was performed in collaboration with Dr. Edwin Rubel at the 
University of Washington. Inner ears were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium 
phosphate at 4°C overnight. The next day specimens were rinsed three times in 0.1M sodium 
phosphate buffer (PB) and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M PB for 30 min in an 
ice bath. Specimens were then rinsed in 0.1M PB and dehydrated through a graded ethanol 
series: 35%, 70%, 95%, and 100% (x2). Samples were critical point dried, mounted on SEM 
stubs, and sputter coated with Au/Pd. SEM was performed using a JEOL JSM-840A 
scanning electron microscope. A similar preparation was performed for P8 and 6 weeks 
stages by Dr. Géléoc and Dr. Indzhykulian. Organ of Corti explants were fixed in 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) supplemented 
with 2mM CaCl2 for 1h at room temperature. Specimens were dehydrated in a graded series 
of acetone, critical-point dried from liquid CO2, sputter-coated with 4–5nm of platinum 
(Q150T, Quorum Technologies, United Kingdom), and observed with a field emission 
scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan).
Electrophysiological recording
Recordings were performed in standard artificial perilymph solution containing (in mM): 
144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH2PO4, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.9 MgCl2, 5.6 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES-
NaOH, adjusted to pH 7.4 and 320mOsmol/kg. Vitamins (1:50) and amino acids (1:100) 
were added from concentrates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Hair cells were viewed from the 
apical surface using an upright Axioskop FS microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) 
equipped with a 63X water immersion objective with differential interference contrast 
optics. Recording pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (Garner 
Glass, Claremont, CA) and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 KCl, 5

 EGTA-KOH, 10 HEPES, 2.5 K2ATP, 3.5 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Currents were recorded 
under whole-cell voltage-clamp at a holding potential of −64mV at room temperature. Data 
were acquired using an Axopatch Multiclamp 700A or Axopatch 200A (Molecular devices, 
Palo Alto, CA) filtered at 10 kHz with a low pass Bessel filter, digitized at ≥20 kHz with a 
12-bit acquisition board (Digidata 1322) and pClamp 8.2 and 10.5 (Molecular Devices, Palo 
Alto, CA). Data were analyzed offline with OriginLab software and are presented as means 
± standard deviations unless otherwise noted.
Mechanical stimulation
OHCs and IHCs: Mechanical stimuli were transmitted via a stiff glass probe mounted on a 
one-dimensional PICMA chip piezo actuator (Physik Instruments, Waldbronn, Gernamy) 
driven by a 400 mA ENV400 Amplifier (Piezosystem Jena Germany)44. The tip of the probe 
was fired polished (Fire polisher, H602, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) to 
fit stereociliary bundle44. Deflections were evoked by applying voltage steps filtered with an 
8-pole Bessel filter (Khron-Hite, Brockton, MA) at 50 kHz to eliminate residual pipette 
resonance. Hair bundle deflections were monitored using a C2400 CCD camera 
(Hamamatsu, Japan). Voltage steps were used to calibrate the motion of the stimulus probe 
around ± 2μm of its rest position. Video images of the probe were recorded to confirm 
absence of off-axis motion and calibrate the probe motion (spatial resolution of ~ 4 nm). The 
10–90% rise-time of the probe was ~20 μsec. VHCs: Mechanical stimuli were transmitted 
via a stiff glass probe mounted on a piezoelectric bimorph element. Coupling was performed 
by gentle suction of the kinocilium into the stimulus pipette. Deflections were evoked by 
applying voltage steps to the piezoelectrical device which consisted of two bimorphs 
mounted in series and directly coupled to the stimulus probe. Voltage steps were controlled 
by pClamp 8.0 software and filtered with a 8 pole Bessel filter at 1 kHz (Khron-Hite, 
Brockton, MA). Hair bundle deflections were monitored using a C2400 CCD camera 
(Hamamatsu, Japan). The motion of the stimulus probe was calibrated around (± 2 μm) its 
rest position prior to the experiments.
Viral vector generation
Harmonin-a1 and harmonin-b1 plasmid were prepared in our laboratory from EGFP tagged 
labeled constructs graciously provided by Lily Zheng and James Bartles45 (Department of 
Cell and Molecular Biology, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of medicine, 
Chicago, IL). Harmonin-a1 was originally obtained from mouse kidney and harmonin-b1 
from isolated mouse cochlea sensory epithelium. We further modified the harmonin-a1 
construct to replace the EGFP tag with tdTomato at its N terminal end. Fluorescently labeled 
and unlabeled constructs were packaged into AAV vectors. Viral vectors were generated by 
the viral core facility at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Gene Transfer Vector Core at the 
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The following vectors were generated: 
AAV2/1.CMV.tdTomato::harmonin-a1 4.3×10^13gc/ml (BCH); 
AAV2/1.CMV.EGFP::harmonin-b1 2.7×10^14 gc/ml (BCH); 
AAV2/1.CMV.EGFP::harmonin-a1: 2.8×10^12 gc/ml (MEEI); AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1: 1.9×10^12 gc/ml (MEEI); AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-
b1: 1.7×10^12 gc/ml (MEEI); AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.tdTomato::harmonin-a1: 4.1×10^12 
gc/ml (MEEI); AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.EGFP::Harmonin-b1: 3.0×10^12 gc/ml (MEEI);

 Cloning of the truncated harmonin was performed from total RNA isolated from cochleas of 
c.216AA mice (RNAqueous micro kit, Ambion) and reverse transcribed with QuantiTect 
Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The cDNA of trunc-harmonin was amplified by PCR 
with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and primers:
Trunc-harmonin.F GAGGTACCATGGACCGGAAGGTGGCCCGAG
Trunc-harmomin.RV CAGGATCCGGACAATTTCATCCCCTAC
The 387 bp PCR product was cloned into a shuttle vector with AAV2 inverted terminal 
repeats (ITRs) where the transgene cassette was driven by a CMV promoter. Custom vector 
was packaged into the Anc80L65 capsid: AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.trunc-harm.WPRE: 
9.0×10^12 gc/ml (MEEI).
FM1-43 imaging
FM1-43 (Invitrogen) was diluted in extracellular recording solution (5μM) and applied to 
tissues for 10 seconds and then washed 3 times in extracellular recording solution to remove 
excess ye and prevent uptake via endocytosis. After 5 minutes the intracellular FM1-43 was 
imaged using an epifluorescence light source, differential interference contrast optics, and an 
FM1-43 filter set (Chroma Technologies) on a Zeiss Axioscope FS plus with water 
immersion 20x, 40x, and 63x objectives. Images were captured at 16-bit with a CCD camera 
and Argus-20 image processor (Hamamatsu) using background fluorescence subtraction. 
The same gain and contrast settings were maintained for the acquisition of all images and 
analyzed offline with Adobe Photoshop or Image-J software.
Confocal imaging
To prepare the tissue for confocal imaging from postnatal mice P0-P8, fixation was 
performed for 15 min with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA). Permeabilization with 0.01% triton 
and counterstaining with Alexa Fluor phalloidin (Invitrogen, 1/200) was used to labeled 
actin filaments. Images were obtained on a LSM700 Zeiss confocal microscope. In older 
mice (4 to 8 weeks), temporal bones were removed after euthanasia and placed in 4% PFA 
for 1 hour, followed by decalcification for 24 to 36 hours with 120mM EDTA. The sensory 
epithelium was then dissected out and treated as above for immunostaining. Mouse anti-
CTBP2 (BD bioscience #612044, 1/200) or anti-harmonin (Novus Biologicals, LLC 
#NBP1-89189, 1/100) were applied for 48 hours and incubated with secondary antibody 
(1/200) and Alexa Fluor Phallodin to label F-actin (1/200) 3–12h at 4°C. Images were 
acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710 laser confocal microscope (IDDRC Imaging Core grant P30 
HD18655) and processed with Zeiss LSM image viewer 4.2.
RT-PCR
cDNA was prepared from 6 auditory organs of P2-P3 wild-type, heterozygous and 
homozygous Ush1c c.216G>A mice using QuantiTect Revese Transcription Kit (Qiagen). 
cDNA encoding full length (450bp) or truncated harmonin (−35bp) was amplified using the 
following primers: Forward primer mUsh1c_Ex2F: 5′ 
CTCATTGAAAATGACGCAGAGAAGG 3′, Reverse mUsh1c_Ex5R: 5′ 
TCTCACTTTGATGGACACGGTCTT 3′. These primers are specific for mouse Ush1c

 sequences and will amplify both endogenous and AAV2-derived Ush1c as the target 
sequence is outside the region of the human knocked in portion of the Ush1c c.216A allele. 
DNA and RNA levels were also assessed from mouse tissue collected at six weeks post-
treatment. DNA and RNA were isolated from the cochlea using TRIzol reagent (Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was reverse 
transcribed using GoScript reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). 
Radiolabeled PCR was carried out using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, 
WI). For viral DNA amplification, primers specific for mouse Ush1c: mUsh1c_Ex3F (5′-
GAACCCAACCGCCTGCCG) and mUsh1c_Ex4WTR (5′-
TGCAGACGGTCCAAGCGT-3′) were used. These primers only amplify the viral Ush1c 
DNA because the homozygous Ush1c.216AA mice have the human USH1C c.216A gene 
knocked-in at exons 3 and 4, replacing the mouse sequence (32). For cDNA amplification of 
full-length (450bp) and aberrantly spliced/truncated harmonin (415bp), the same primers as 
above were used (mUsh1c_Ex2F and mUsh1c_Ex5R). Gapdh primers were: mGapdh_Ex3F 
(5′-GTGAGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATG-3′) and mGapdh_Ex4R (5′-
GCCAAAGTTGTCATGGATGAC-3′). Products were separated on a 6% nondenaturing 
polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a Typhoon 9400 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare).
Round window membrane (RWM) injection
RWM injections were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committees at Boston Children’s Hospital animal protocol #15-01-2878R. 0.8 μl-1ul of 
AAV vectors were injected in neonatal mice P0-P1 and P10-P12. P0-P1 mice were first 
anesthetized using hypothermia exposure while P10-P12 mice were anesthetized with 
isoflurane. Upon anesthesia, post-auricular incision was made to expose the otic bulla and 
visualize the cochlea. Injections were done through the RWM with a glass micropipette 
controlled by a micromanipulator6. The volume of the injected materials was controlled at 
an approximately 0.02 μl/min for 10 min. Standard post-operative care was applied. Sample 
size for in vivo studies were determined on a continuing basis to optimize the sample size 
and decrease the variance.
Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion products (DPOAEs)
ABRs and DPOAEs were recorded from mice anesthetized with xylazine (5–10mg/kg i.p.) 
and ketamine (60 – 100mg/kg i.p.). Subcutaneous needle electrodes were inserted into the 
skin a) dorsally between the two ears (reference electrode); b) behind the left pinna 
(recording electrode); and c) dorsally at the rump of the animal (ground electrode). The 
meatus at the base of the pinna was trimmed away to expose the ear canal. For ABR 
recordings the ear canal and hearing apparatus (EPL Acoustic system, MEEI, Boston) were 
presented with 5-millisec tone pips. The responses were amplified (10,000 times), filtered 
(0.1–3 kHz), and averaged with an analog-to-digital board in a PC based data-acquisition 
system (EPL, Cochlear function test suite, MEEI, Boston). Sound level was raised in 5 to 10 
dB steps from 0 to 110 dB sound pressure level (decibels SPL). At each level, 512 to 1024 
responses were averaged (with stimulus polarity alternated) after “artifact rejection”. 
Threshold was determined by visual inspection. Data were analyzed and plotted using 
Origin-2015 (OriginLab Corporation, MA). Thresholds averages ± standard deviations are 
presented unless otherwise stated. For DPOAEs, f1 and f2 primary tones (f2/f1 = 1.2) were

 presented with f2 varied between 5.6 and 45.2 kHz in half-octave steps and L1–L2 = 10 dB 
SPL. At each f2, L2 was varied between 10 and 80 dB in 10dB increments. DPOAE 
threshold was defined from the average spectra as the L2-level eliciting a DPOAE of 
magnitude 5 dB above the noise floor. The mean noise floor level was under 0 dB across all 
frequencies. Stimuli were generated with 24-bit digital I–O cards (National Instruments 
PXI-4461) in a PXI-1042Q chassis, amplified by an SA-1 speaker driver (Tucker–Davis 
Technologies, Inc.), and delivered from two electrostatic drivers (CUI CDMG15008-03A) in 
our custom acoustic system. An electret microphone (Knowles FG-23329-P07) at the end of 
a small probe tube was used to monitor ear-canal sound pressure. The majority of these 
experiments were not performed under blind conditions.
Acoustic startle responses
The acoustic startle responses (ASR) were measured using the Startle Monitor (Kinder 
Scientific). Mice were placed in a small-sized, nonrestrictive, cubical Plexiglas recording 
chamber (27 cm × 10 cm × 12.5 cm) fixed on a piezo/plexiglass sensing assembly and 
allowed to acclimate for 5 min with a 60 dB background white noise. Each session consisted 
of 35 trials, during which a single noise pulse ranging in 10 dB intensities from 60–120 dB 
was delivered with an inter-trial interval averaging 30s (25–35 s range). Pulses were 
arranged in a pseudorandom order, on a constant 60 dB back ground noise to limit external 
noise interference. The Startle Monitor system reduced the response to each pulse into 
measurements of first N, max N, and max time of the response (ms), for calculations of peak 
startle response (ASR amplitude) and time from stimulus to peak startle response (ASR 
latency). ASR were all conducted blind.
Vestibular assessment
Vestibular function was assessed using open field and rotarod balance test. The open field 
test was conducted using a circular frame measuring 42cm in diameter, placed inside a 
sound chamber with overhead LED lighting, set to 30lux at the center, inside a dimmed 
room. Mice were placed one at a time inside the circular open field, and allowed to explore 
for 5min. Behavior was recorded and tracked using Ethovision XT, enabling measures of 
distance traveled and velocity. Open field assessments were all conducted blind. The rotarod 
performance involved placement of mice on a rod in an enclosed housing that began rotating 
at 4 rpm and accelerated at a rate of 0.1 rpm s−1. The mice were placed on the rods on day 
one for 5 min to get familiarized with the equipment. The next day, the animals were placed 
on the rods for a total of 5 trials. A 5 min resting period was imposed between trials. The 
length of time the animals were able to remain on the device before dropping onto the 
instrumented floor of the housing was displayed on a timer and recorded after each test run.
Statistical analyses
Test and control vectors were evaluated in at least three mice per group at each time point to 
ensure reproducibility. Sample sizes are noted in figure legends. All animals with successful 
RWM injection were included in the study analysis. Those animals with unsuccessful 
injection were excluded from the mean but included in the legend for full disclosure. 
Injection success was determined according to ABR recovery with thresholds < 80 dB SPL. 
Statistical analyses were performed with Origin 2016 (OriginLab Corporation). Data are

 presented as means ± standard deviations (S.D) or standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) as 
noted in the text and figure legend. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student t-test 
was used to determine significant differences between the means. In the box plot graphs, the 
ends of whisker is defined by maximum and minimum values. Central rectangle spans from 
first quartile to third quartile. The segment in the rectangle indicates median and the square

 Figure 1. Scanning electron microscopy of the organ of Corti in Ush1c c.216G>A mice at P8
(a–f) Basal, middle and apical regions of the organ of Corti were imaged in P8 c.216GA (n = 
3 mice) and c.216AA (n = 4 mice) mice. OHC and IHC hair bundles were preserved in 
heterozygous mice but some hair bundles appeared disorganized along the organ of Corti in 
homozygous 216AA mice. (g–l) High magnification images revealed fragmented and 
disorganized bundles with disruptions in the staircase array in many but not all OHC (g–h) 
and IHCs (i–j). Examples of OHC hair bundles imaged in the middle region of the organ at 
P8 illustrate a preserved (k) and a disorganized hair bundle (l) present in the same 
preparation. Stars indicate preserved hair bundles; arrowhead, disorganized hair bundles; and 
arrows, wavy IHC bundles. Scale bars low mag.: 5 μm (a–f); high mag.: 2 μm (g), 3 μm (h), 
2 μm (i–j) and 1 μm (k,l).

 Figure 2. Mechanotransduction in hair cells of Ush1c c.216G>A neonatal mice
(a–d) The permeable styryl dye FM1-43 was used to assess the presence of open 
transduction channels in hair cells of c.216GA and c.216AA mice. In the organ of Corti, FM 
uptake was reduced in sensory hair cells of c.216AA mice at P4 (a–b, mid base). Note that 
IHC FM1-43 fluorescence appears dimmer as IHCs are in a different focal plane. Left: DIC, 
Right: FM1-43; Scale bar 10μm. In the utricle, FM1-43 uptake was restricted to the extra-
striola region in c.216AA mutants at P6 (c; scale bar 50μm) while utricular hair cells 
retained gross normal bundle morphology as assessed by DIC (d; scale bar 10μm). The 
white lines on panel c and d delineate the striola (no uptake) and extra-striola regions 
(uptake). Experiment was repeated three times. (e–h) Mechanotransduction was assessed in 
OHCs, IHCs and VHCs in neonatal c.216GA and c.216AA mice (number of mice recorded 
from respectively are: n= 7, 6 for OHCs, n= 2, 4 for IHCs and n= 2, 6 for VHCs, number of 
cells are indicated above the bar graph; Holding potential: −60mV). Representative 
transduction currents (e), their associated current/displacement plots fitted with a second 
order Boltzmann function (f) and average peak transduction current are plotted (g–h). In the 
cochlea, recordings were obtained in the middle and mid-apical turn of the organ at P3-P6. 
In the utricle transduction currents were recorded from VHCs of the extra-striola (E.S.) and 
striola (S.) region between P5 and P7 (e–f). While hair bundles appeared well preserved 
under DIC, smaller average transduction currents were evoked in c.216AA mutants (h).

 Figure 3. Expression and localization of fluorescently labeled harmonin in tissues exposed to 
adeno-associated viral vectors in vitro and in vivo
(a–c) Acutely dissected P0-P1 inner ear tissue were exposed to AAV2/1 vectors for 24h, kept 
in culture for 7 to 8 days before being fixed, counterstained (Alexa Fluor phalloidin, 
Invitrogen) and imaged with a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. A large number of sensory 
hair cells were infected in wild-type utricle and expression of harmonin-b1 fused to EGFP 
was evident in most hair cells with specific localization at the apex of the sensory hair 
bundle (a, scale bar: 10 μm- upper panels; 5μm- lower panels). Similarly expression of 
EGFP::harmonin-b1 was evident at the tip of the stereocilia in OHCs and IHCs of c.216AA 
and wild-type mice (b, scale bar: 10 μm; c, scale bar: 3μm). When 1 μl 
AAV2/1.CMV.EGFP::harmonin-b1 vectors were injected at P1, EGFP signal was detected in 
some IHCs and OHCs at P60 in the left injected ear (d, scale bar: 30 μm). Exogenous 
tdTomato::harmonin-a1 was detected in the cell body of IHCs and OHCs in P7 organotypic 
cultures exposed to AAV2/1.CMV.tdTomato::harmonin-a1 for 24 h at P0 (e, scale bar: 5μm). 
Some harmonin-a1 puncta were colocalized with CTBP2 (blue; mouse anti-CTBP2 1/200, 
BD bioscience) in particular at the base of the sensory cells presumably near the ribbon 
synapse (arrowheads). No expression was observed in the stereociliary bundle.

 Figure 4. Recovery of mechanotransduction in hair cells of mice injected with Anc80L65 
harmonin vectors
(a–c) Mechanotransduction currents were recorded in IHCs of c.216AA uninjected control 
mice (n=8 cells, one mouse) and c.216AA mice injected at P1 with AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 (0.8 μl, 1.9×10^12 gc/ml, n=15 cells, one mouse) or a 
combined injection of the AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 (1.7×10^12 gc/ml) and 
AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1 (0.5 μl + 0.5 μl, n=7 cells, one mouse). Tissue was 
extracted at P5-P6, before the cochlea became ossified, and was maintained in culture for 10 
days. (9 to 10 DIV). While small mechanotransduction currents could be induced by hair 
bundle stimulations of c.216AA mice, larger currents were evoked in c.216AA mice injected 
with vectors driving harmonin-b1 or dual harmonin-a1 and -b1 expression (a). 
Corresponding I/X curve for each dataset and double Boltzmann fitting function. Respective 
maximal mechanotransduction current Imax= 102.1 pA (c.216AA); 424.3 pA (c.216AA + 
harmonin-b1) and 341.1 pA (c.216AA + harmonin-a1&-b1) (b). Average responses (Mean ± 
S.D.) show significant recovery of transduction (***P < 0.001) for harmonin-b1 and 
harmonin-a1 +-b1 injected relative to uninjected mice. Average transduction currents were 
not significantly different in harmonin-b1 injected mice and c.216GA control mice (N.S. 
P>0.5). Recovery of mechanotransduction was also not significantly improved when 
harmonin-a and harmonin-b were combined. (c), one-way ANOVA.

(a) Representative ABR responses for 16 kHz tones in 6 weeks old c.216AA control mice 
and c.216AA mice injected at P1 via RWM injection of vectors encoding harmonin-a1(0.8 
μl, 1.7×10^12 gc/ml), harmonin-b1 (0.8 μl, 1.9×10^12 gc/ml) or a combination of the two 
(0.5 μl + 0.5 μl). Recovered ABR thresholds near 30 dB were measured in mice injected 
with harmonin-b1 alone or harmonin-a1 and b1 together. (b) Mean ABR responses obtained 
for: c.216 AA (n=13); c.216GA (n=12); c.216GA + trunc-harmonin (n=4); c.216AA +

obtained at 6 weeks and 3 months in eight mice that showed initial ABR thresholds under or 
equal to 45 dB SPL. Seven of the eight mice were kept for 6 months (one taken for 
histology) and had ABRs and DPOAEs assessed (dotted line). Mean ± S.E. While ABRs and 
DPOAEs thresholds shifts were evident over the first three month, hearing rescue was still 
prominent at 6 months of age in the lower frequency range.

 Figure 6. Startle response, rotarod performance and open field behavior recovery in mice 
injected at P1 with AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-a1 and AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-
b1
(a) Startle response to white noise stimuli was recorded in 6 weeks old control c.216GA, c.
216AA mice and injected mice. Partial but significant startle rescue was evident in mice 
injected with harmonin-b1 but not harmonin-a1 (data overlap with control c.216AA mice). 
Averages ± S.E. are shown for all mice tested. Statistical analysis: 216AA relative to 216AA 
+ Harm a1&b1: p=0.008 at 100db; p= 0.005 at 110dB; 216AA relative to 216AA + Harm

 Figure 7. Scanning electron microscopy of the organ of Corti in mice injected with AAV2/
Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1
Basal, Middle and Apical regions of the organ of Corti were imaged at six weeks in c.
216GA (a–d), c.216AA (e–h) and c.216AA (i–l, n–p) mice injected at P1 (RMW injection 
0.8 μl AAV2/Anc80L65.CMV.harmonin-b1). OHC and IHC hair bundles were preserved in 
c.216GA mice but appeared disorganized along the organ of Corti in c.216AA mice. 
Noticeable hair cell loss (asterisk) and hair bundle disorganization was observed in c.216AA 
mice with more pronounced degeneration in the basal end of the organ. Hair bundles of c.
216AA mice lacked normal stereocilia rows. The shorter rows appeared to be retracted while 
the tallest rows were maintained in c.216AA mice (arrow). While hair cell loss and bundle 
disorganization were still evident in rescued c.216AA mice, hair cell survival was noticeably 
higher in the basal and middle regions of the Organ. Hair cell counts are summarized in the 
bar graph. A total of 1824 cells were counted in c.216AA mice (4 ears) and 792 in rescued c.
216AA mice (2 ears). Mean ± S.E. High magnification imaging reveals rescue of the 
staircase array in injected c.216AA mice (arrow) in many but not all cells (arrowhead). Scale 
bar low magnification: 5 μm; high magnification: 1 μm.
