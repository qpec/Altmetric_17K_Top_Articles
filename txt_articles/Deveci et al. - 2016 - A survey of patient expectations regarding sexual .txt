Abstract
Introduction—Clinical experience suggests that some radical prostatectomy (RP) patients have 
unrealistic expectations with regard to their long-term sexual function. This study was undertaken 
to assess the understanding of patients who had previously undergone RP with regard to their 
postoperative sexual function.
Methods—Patients presenting within 3 months of their RP (open and robotic) were questioned 
regarding the sexual function information that they had received pre-operatively. Patients were 
questioned about erectile function, postoperative ejaculatory status, orgasm and postoperative 
penile morphology changes. Statistical analyses were performed to assess for differences between 
patients who underwent open versus robotic RP.
Results—336 consecutive patients (from 9 surgeons) with a mean age of 64±11 years had the 
survey instrument administered (216 underwent open and 120 underwent robotic RP). No 
significant differences existed in patient age or comorbidity profiles between the two groups. Only 
38% of men had an accurate recollection of their nerve sparing status. The mean (SD) elapsed 
time post-RP at the time of postoperative assessment was 3 (2) months. Robotic RP patients 
expected shorter EF recovery time (6 vs 12 months, p=0.02), a higher likelihood of recovery back 
to baseline erectile function (75 vs. 50%, p=0.01), and lower potential need for ICI (4 vs. 20%, 
p=0.01). Almost half of all patients were unaware that they were rendered anejaculatory by their 
surgery. None of the robotic RP patients and only 10% of open RP patients recalled being 
informed of the potential for penile length loss (p<0.01) and none were aware of the association 
between RP and Peyronie’s disease.
Conclusions—Patients who have undergone RP have largely unrealistic expectations with 
regard to their postoperative sexual function.

 resulted in over 90% of patients having clinically localized cancer at the time of diagnosis. 
There are multiple management options for patients with organ-confined disease, including 
active surveillance, as well as the potentially curative options of radical prostatectomy (RP), 
radiation therapy, cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasonography1,2.
Despite refinements in each of these techniques, sexual dysfunction remains common after 
treatment including erectile dysfunction (ED), changes in orgasm and penile morphology. 
The incidence of these problems varies depending upon the definition used as well as the 
timing and method of patient assessment after definitive treatment. Robotic-assisted 
laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) was employed in 63% of all RPs performed in the 
United States in 2007 and 80% in 2008, and 86% in 20092. According to another study 
published in 2012 investigating current trends in radical prostatectomies in the United 
States; only 8% of patients were treated with robotic radical prostatectomy in 2004 while 
67% underwent that procedure in 20101. This rise in popularity is largely attributed to 
marketing rather than the existence of any evidence proving that the robotic approach to RP 
has improved oncologic or functional outcomes over other surgical approaches.
Sexual dysfunction after radical prostatectomy (RP) is an important quality of life problem. 
It is our clinical experience that patients who undergo RP often have unrealistic expectations 
regarding their long-term sexual function. ED has been found to have the a significant 
negative impact on quality of life in RP patients although no analysis of the impact of 
orgasm changes, climacturia or penile morphological changes has been conducted.
The majority of patients do not achieve penetration hardness erectile rigidity with PDE5i in 
the first 6 months after RP and thus most are faced with a decision regarding intracavernosal 
injection therapy (ICI). Several reports in the literature have highlighted that up to 70% of 
men have documented penile length loss4–7. Furthermore, a significant proportion of men 
develop Peyronie’s disease following RP7–8.
Previous studies have shown that the perceptions of urologists and the expectations of the 
patients do not necessarily concur. A study from France demonstrated that by 2 months after 
RP, 73% of French patients were frustrated by their ED9. Furthermore, Schroeck et al 
showed that the regret level after RP was high and that it appeared to be higher after robotic 
RP10. The authors suggested that this was related to the heightened expectations of patients 
utilizing this approach.
Our study was undertaken in an effort to assess the understanding of patients who underwent 
RP with regard to their postoperative sexual function.
METHODS
Study Population
Patients presenting within three months of open or robotic RP to the sexual medicine clinic 
at our center were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their sexual function 
expectations. Prostate cancer, demographic and comorbidity data was obtained from the 
patients’ medical records (Table 1). Specific attention was paid to the type of RP patients

 had undergone, specifically whether it was an open or robot-assisted approach. Patients were 
excluded if they had neoadjuvant therapies (androgen deprivation, radiation) or had PSA 
elevation by the time they were seen postoperatively.
Expectations Assessment
The patients were administered a proprietary questionnaire to assess their understanding of 
alterations in and recovery of various aspects of their sexual function after RP (Appendix 1). 
The questionnaire included questions on erectile function (expected time to full recovery of 
erections, requirement for postoperative intracavernosal injections; Table 2), postoperative 
ejaculatory status andorgasm (presence, intensity, pain, and climacturia; Table 3), and 
postoperative Peyronie’s disease, and penile length changes (Table 4).
Statistics
Patients were separated by type of RP, open versus robot–assisted. Mann-Whitney U test 
was used to assess for differences between open and robotic RP patients.
RESULTS
Study Population
Information on patient demographics is displayed in Table 1. The study population included 
336 consecutive patients, of whom 216 had open and 120 had robotic RP. The surgeries were 
performed by 9 different surgeons (4 open surgeons, 3 robot surgeons, and 2 surgeons who 
offered both procedures). The mean elapsed time post-RP at the time of sexual medicine 
clinic presentation was 3±2 months. Self-referred patients accounted for 22% of the study 
population. The mean patient age was 64±11 years, with no significant difference between 
the open and robotic groups. The percentage of patients with a partner was not significantly 
different between the open (86%) and robotic (82%) groups nor was the mean (SD) partner 
age at 62 (13) years for the open group and 61 (17) for the robotic group. There was no 
significant difference in comorbidity status between the two groups or in pathologic stage. 
Preoperatively, 88% and 91% of open and robotic patients respectively reported erections 
sufficient for sexual intercourse (p=0.13).
Expectations
Only 38% of patients had an accurate recollection of their nerve sparing status. Results of 
the sexual function knowledge assessment are listed in the Tables 2, 3 and 4. Patient 
knowledge regarding post-RP sexual function was poor with significant differences between 
the open and the robotic RP groups. Robotic RP patients expected shorter EF recovery time 
(6 vs 12 months, p=0.02), a higher likelihood of recovery back to baseline erectile function 
(75 vs 50%, p=0.01), and lower potential need for ICI (4 vs 20%, p=0.01).
With regards to expectations regarding ejaculation and orgasm, only 70% of open and 60% 
of robotic RP patients were aware that they were rendered anejaculatory by their surgery 
(p=0.065). Few, if any, patients in either group were aware of the potential for change in 
nature of orgasm (p=0.09), orgasmic pain (0.2), or climacturia (p=0.15). None of the robotic 
RP patients and only 10% of open RP patients recalled being informed of the potential for

 penile length loss (p<0.01). No patients were aware of the recently-described association 
between RP and Peyronie’s disease.
DISCUSSION
Patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy have unrealistic expectations with regard 
to postoperative sexual function. In particular, a significant proportion of patients are 
unaware of the inability to ejaculate, and almost none understand that there are documented 
orgasm changes or the association between RP and Peyronie’s disease8. Patients undergoing 
robotic RP are less likely to be aware of the potential need for ICI therapy after surgery or 
the link between RP and penile length changes, and are more likely to think their erectile 
function will recover within the first 12 months postoperatively.
Shroeck et al applied a multivariate logistic regression model to a group of 400 patients 
treated with either open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between 2000–2007. The 
response rate for the survey was 61% with 84% of patients satisfied with their treatment and 
19% of these patients regretting their choice of treatment based on previously validated five-
level Likert items. Independent predictors of patient satisfaction included lower income 
(odds ratio [OR], 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03–0.23), shorter follow-up (OR, 
0.63; 95% CI, 0.41–0.98), having undergone open versus robotic-assisted laparoscopic RP 
(OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 1.90–10.4)], urinary domain scores (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.60–4.54), and 
hormone domain scores (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.30–3.12). The authors hypothesized that 
robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy was associated with a higher rate of regret and 
dissatisfaction mainly because of higher expectations associated with a newer, more 
“innovative”, procedure10.
Another study published by Hu et al found that minimally-invasive radical prostatectomy, 
whether robot-assisted or purely laparoscopic, was associated with an increased risk of 
genitourinary complications (4.7% vs 2.1%; p = 0.001) and diagnoses of incontinence (15.9 
vs 12.2 per 100 person-years; p = 0.02) and ED (26.8 vs 19.2 per 100 person-years; p = 
0.009) despite shorter length of hospital stay, and lower rates of short-term complications 
and strictures11.
In a survey of 349 patients who had chosen different treatment modalities for prostate 
cancer, Clark et al found that 24% felt that they were poorly informed and 16% regretted 
their decision12. A study by Davison et al found that men who played active or collaborative 
roles in deciding whether to undergo RP had lower scores of decision regret when compared 
to those who took on passive roles13.
In the field of vascular surgery, a study by Lloyd et al evaluated the level of understanding 
and recall of 71 patients awaiting carotid endarterectomy (CEA). One month after initial 
consultation patients had unrealistic expectations of the potential benefits of CEA. Many 
patients believed that the procedure would alleviate other problems such as dizziness, 
weakness, shortness of breath, poor memory, and difficulty walking, despite never being 
counseled that this was the case14.

 Crawford et al reported a disparity in physician and patient recall of discussions surrounding 
treatment options and outcomes following a diagnosis of prostate cancer. One hundred 
percent of physicians surveyed claimed to always discuss treatment-related side-effects 
whereas only 16% of patients recalled being provided with such information. Additionally, 
100% of physicians felt they had addressed patient concerns about ED, the possibility of 
decreased libido with therapy, and the impact of therapy on quality of life, whereas only 
26%, 28%, and 30% of patients surveyed felt that these issues had been adequately 
addressed15. While this paper was published more than a decade ago, there is little reason to 
expect that these figures would be any different now. Indeed, the Crawford findings agree 
supported by our own data.
Mirkin et al, found in their study searching direct-to-consumer internet marketing of robotic 
radical prostatectomy that many internet sites claimed benefits that were unsupported by 
evidence and 42 percent of the sites failed to mention risks16.
The strengths of this study are that it included a significant number of men enrolled 
consecutively and used a standardized, albeit non-validated, instrument for all patients. The 
limitations include the absence of an instrument to define expectations, our inability to 
differentiate between what patients were told and what patients remember and the inability 
to define if some patients did their own research before or after they had seen their surgeon 
prior to their RP.
These data ate illuminating and should give us reason to think about our approach to the 
education of the patient prior to RP. Irrespective of whether we as clinicians routinely have a 
sexual dysfunction discussion or not, patients are not remembering or appreciating the 
information the way that it is intended and undertake the operation with poor expectations 
regarding multiple domains of sexual health. The concerns are further amplified for patients 
undergoing robot assisted RP, our data being confirmatory of the Schroeck data. Further 
analysis of these data is warranted and ongoing analysis is aimed at defining inter-surgeon 
variability in the delivery of realistic expectations to patients undergoing RP.
CONCLUSIONS
Disclosure does not equate to understanding. The lack of knowledge is likely multi-factorial 
in nature. Surgeons should be encouraged to be thorough in counseling patients prior to RP 
and to document that such discussion is held. Indeed, we go one step further and encourage 
all clinicians to utilize written instructions to transmit sexual health information to patients, 
lest they receive the orally transmitted information in a state of anxiety where failure to 
process the information may be highly likely.
