abstract
CONTEXT: The effectiveness of tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (hereafter, 
“tonsillectomy”) for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB) compared with 
watchful waiting with supportive care is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To compare sleep, cognitive or behavioral, and health outcomes of tonsillectomy 
versus watchful waiting with supportive care in children with OSDB.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently screened studies against predetermined 
criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted key data. Investigators 
independently assessed study risk of bias and the strength of the evidence of the body of 
literature. Investigators synthesized data qualitatively and meta-analyzed apnea–hypopnea 
index (AHI) scores.
RESULTS: We included 11 studies. Relative to watchful waiting, most studies reported better 
sleep-related outcomes in children who had a tonsillectomy. In 5 studies including children 
with polysomnography-confirmed OSDB, AHI scores improved more in children receiving 
tonsillectomy versus surgery. A meta-analysis of 3 studies showed a 4.8-point improvement 
in the AHI in children who underwent tonsillectomy compared with no surgery. Sleep-
related quality of life and negative behaviors (eg, anxiety and emotional lability) also 
improved more among children who had a tonsillectomy. Changes in executive function 
were not significantly different. The length of follow-up in studies was generally <12 
months.
LIMITATIONS: Few studies fully categorized populations in terms of severity of OSDB; outcome 
measures were heterogeneous; and the durability of outcomes beyond 12 months is not 
known.
CONCLUSIONS: Tonsillectomy can produce short-term improvement in sleep outcomes compared 
with no surgery in children with OSDB. Understanding of longer-term outcomes or effects in 
subpopulations is lacking.

CHINNADURAI et al 
Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy 
(“tonsillectomy”) are commonly 
performed in the United States 
and represent >15% of all surgical 
procedures in children under the age 
of 15 years. 
1, 
 
2 Currently, the most 
common indication for tonsillectomy 
is obstructive sleep-disordered 
breathing (OSDB) (ie, breathing 
difficulties during sleep, including 
simple snoring, obstructive sleep 
apnea [OSA], and upper airway 
resistance syndrome). OSDB results 
from obstruction or dynamic collapse 
of upper airway soft tissue during 
sleep, which can manifest as snoring, 
hypopnea, apnea, and restless sleep. 
Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the 
most common contributor to OSDB in 
children.
OSDB can result in significant quality 
of life and health consequences. It 
has been associated with a 5-point 
decrease in IQ, hypersomnolence, 
emotional lability, decreased 
attention, small stature, enuresis, 
cardiopulmonary morbidity, and 
missed school. 
3 Evidence of the 
relationship is reinforced by the 
effectiveness of OSDB treatment 
in improving behavior, attention, 
quality of life, neurocognitive 
functioning, enuresis, parasomnias, 
and restless sleep and reversing of 
associated cardiovascular sequelae. 
4, 
 
5 
Moreover, OSDB occurs at especially 
high rates in subsets of children 
with developmental disorders and 
craniofacial syndromes, including 
Down syndrome.
As in adults, the gold standard 
diagnostic test for OSA in children 
is polysomnography (PSG), 
which physiologically tests sleep 
architecture and efficiency. 
Treatment involves alleviating the 
inciting upper airway soft tissue 
obstruction or collapse. One method 
of primary treatment is continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP). 
CPAP compliance is highly variable 
in children. 
6 
 
 
–10 Other approaches 
include weight loss in overweight 
children, oral appliances, and allergy 
or antiinflammatory medications. 
However, because the most common 
culprit in children is tonsillar 
hypertrophy-related oropharyngeal 
obstruction, tonsillectomy is often 
used to establish an adequate airway.
In this systematic review, we 
examined the published evidence 
regarding the effectiveness 
of tonsillectomy compared 
with watchful waiting (which 
includes supportive treatment 
with medications, such as nasal 
steroids) for children with OSDB. 
This review is a component of an 
Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality-commissioned 
comparative effectiveness review of 
tonsillectomy in children conducted 
by the Vanderbilt Evidence Based 
Practice Center. The full comparative 
effectiveness review and review

METHODS
Search Strategy and Study Selection
We searched the Medline database 
via PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library from January 1980 
to June 2016 using a combination 
of controlled vocabulary and key 
terms related to tonsillectomy 
and OSDB (eg, tonsillectomy, 
adenotonsillectomy, and OSA). We 
also hand-searched the reference 
lists of included articles and recent 
reviews addressing tonsillectomy 
in children to identify potentially 
relevant articles.
We developed inclusion criteria in 
consultation with an expert panel 
of clinicians and researchers ( 
Table 
1). We included comparative study 
designs (eg, randomized controlled 
trials [RCTs] and prospective or 
retrospective cohort studies).
Data Extraction and Analysis
One investigator extracted data 
regarding: study design; descriptions 
of study populations, intervention, 
and comparison groups; and 
baseline and outcome data using 
a standardized form. A second 
investigator independently verified 
the accuracy of the extraction 
and revised as needed. Principal 
outcomes of interest included the 
apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), sleep-
related quality of life (eg, Obstructive 
Sleep Apnea-18 [OSA-18] and the 
Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire [PSQ]), 
cognitive, or behavioral measures. 
We synthesized studies qualitatively 
and report descriptive statistics in 
 
Table 2. Because only 3 studies were 
sufficiently homogenous to permit 
pooling, we used a fixed-effects

model to meta-analyze AHI data 
reported in these studies.
Assessment of Study Risk of Bias 
and Strength of Evidence
Two investigators independently 
evaluated the methodologic quality 
of studies using prespecified 
questions 
11 appropriate to each 
study design to assess the risk of 
bias of RCTs and observational 
studies. Senior reviewers resolved 
discrepancies in the risk-of-bias 
assessment. We did not include 
studies with a high risk of bias in our 
descriptive analyses; however, we 
did include them in the meta-analysis 
after we determined that their 
inclusion did not systematically affect 
the meta-analysis results.
Assessment of the strength of the 
evidence reflects the confidence 
that we have in the stability of 
treatment effects in the face of 
future research. 
12 The degree of 
confidence that the observed effect of 
an intervention is unlikely to change 
(ie, the strength of the evidence) 
is presented as insufficient, low, 
moderate, or high. Assessments are 
based on consideration of 5 domains: 
study limitations, consistency in 
direction of the effect, directness 
in measuring intended outcomes, 
precision of effect, and reporting 
bias. We determined the strength 
of evidence separately for major 
intervention–outcome pairs using a 
prespecified approach described in 
detail in the full review.

RESULTS
Our searches (conducted for the 
broader systematic review 
13) 
identified 9608 citations, of which 11 
(reported in multiple publications) 
met inclusion criteria and compared 
tonsillectomy with watchful waiting 
( 
Fig 1).

Table 1 outlines study 
design, risk of bias, and key outcomes 
reported. As noted, we did not 
include high-risk-of-bias studies in 
our qualitative analysis below, but 
we did include 1 such study 
27 in a 
meta-analysis.
OSDB-Related Outcomes
Five studies (reported in multiple 
publications) evaluated the change in 
AHI among children with PSG-proven 
OSDB ( 
Table 2).

CHINNADURAI et al 
Two studies were RCTs, including 
the multiple publication Childhood 
Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT).15 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
23 
All studies reported improvement 
in children after tonsillectomy 
compared with watchful waiting 
(excluding CPAP); differences in 
AHI between groups at follow-up 
were statistically significant in 3 
studies. 
16 
 
 
 
– 
23, 
 
25, 
 
29, 
 
32 The watchful 
waiting groups also improved 
from baseline in 3 studies, but the 
improvements were greater in the 
tonsillectomy groups.15 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
23, 
 
25, 
29 This 
benefit was consistent across age 
ranges (1–18 years), although data 
were most frequently available on 
children ages 4 to 12 years. The 
benefits seemed durable, with 
follow-up ranging from 6 months 
to 4 years. Where reported, the 
respiratory disturbance index 
and oxygen saturation improved 
significantly after tonsillectomy. 
15, 
 
17
Two retrospective cohort studies also 
reported results for children with 
obesity or other conditions. 
25, 
 
32 
One reported significantly greater 
improvement in AHI in healthy 
children with mild OSA undergoing 
tonsillectomy compared with those 
not undergoing tonsillectomy. 
32 In 
subgroup analyses of obese children 
and those with comorbidities, such 
as Down syndrome, there was no 
significant benefit between groups in 
surgical and nonsurgical populations. 
In another study examining a mostly 
overweight/obese population with 
PSG-proven OSDB, AHI decreased 
significantly in children who received 
tonsillectomy compared with those 
who did not, but this single study 
provides inadequate evidence 
to draw conclusions about the 
effects of obesity on tonsillectomy 
effectiveness. 
25
Three studies reported AHI outcomes 
that could be combined in a fixed 
effects meta-analysis (the CHAT 
RCT 
16 
 
 
 
 
– 
23, 
 
29 and 1 prospective25 and 
1 retrospective 
27 cohort study). We 
estimated an effect size of –4.81 
(95% credible interval: –6.5 to –3.1), 
indicating a reduction (improvement) 
in AHI of 4.81 points in children 
receiving tonsillectomy compared 
with those not undergoing surgery. 
This change is statistically significant 
and may be most clinically evident in 
children with mild or moderate OSDB 
(ie, AHI scores of 1–10).
Sleep-Related Quality of Life
Four studies (reported in multiple 
publications) 
15 
 
 
 
– 
21, 
 
23, 
 
25, 
31 assessed 
sleep quality outcomes by using 
several different caregiver-reported 
quality measures, which limited 
our ability to compare effectiveness 
directly across studies. However, 
outcomes were consistently better 
in children receiving tonsillectomy 
( 
Table 2). One RCT and 1 
retrospective cohort used the Clinical 
Assessment Score-15 (CAS-15), 
 
15, 
 
25 
with both reporting significantly 
greater improvement in sleep quality 
in scores in the tonsillectomy group 
compared with watchful waiting. 
In the 1 study reporting baseline 
data, scores in the watchful waiting 
group improved from baseline to the 
6-month follow-up (P = not reported 
[NR]). 
15 The CHAT RCT used the 
Modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(M-ESS) and OSA-18 as a measure of 
quality of life. Although control group 
scores improved moderately (P = 
NR), children that had a tonsillectomy 
had significantly greater 
improvements in sleep quality than 
the nonsurgical group as measured 
on both scales.16 
 
 
 
–21, 
 
23 This RCT also 
used the PSQ Sleep-related Breathing 
Disorder scale (PSQ-SRBD), which 
showed significant improvements 
in sleep quality after tonsillectomy 
versus watchful waiting (P ≤ .01), 
and small improvements in the 
control group from baseline (P = NR). 
In a nonrandomized trial (moderate 
risk of bias), children with mild OSA 
(determined by PSG) were self- or 
caregiver-allocated to tonsillectomy 
or observation. 
31 At a 4-month 
follow-up, quality of life assessed 
using OSA-18 was significantly 
improved in children who had 
surgery (P = .001), but not in the 
control group. Differences between 
groups, however, were not significant 
at the 8-month follow-up visit.
Finally, overall quality of life as 
measured by the Pediatric Quality of 
Life Inventory (PedsQL) improved 
significantly after tonsillectomy, 
compared with the untreated group 
in 1 RCT. 
16 
 
 
– 
21, 
 
23, 
 
28 Scores improved 
slightly in the control group from 
baseline (P = NR). The effects of 
tonsillectomy on sleep quality in 
children suffering from OSDB were 
positive across a number of outcomes 
and outcome domains. Impaired 
quality of life was the chief complaint 
of many parents seeking medical 
attention for a child with OSDB . 
Results were consistently positive for 
tonsillectomy relative to observation 
in short time frames, with limited 
data available in the longer term.
Behavioral Outcomes
The CHAT RCT 
16, 
 
17, 
 
19 
 
– 
23 and 1 
prospective 
28 and 1 retrospective 
cohort study 
25 addressed behavioral 
outcomes (Table 2). All studies 
had a moderate risk of bias and 
used different scales to assess 
outcomes, again limiting our 
ability to compare effectiveness 
directly across studies. Two studies 
used the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBC) to measure internalizing 
(emotionally reactive, anxious/
depressed, somatic complaints, 
and withdrawn behavior) and 
externalizing (attention problems 
and aggressive behavior) behaviors. 
Scores on the CBC improved from 
baseline in both groups in 1 cohort 
study, with no significant group 
differences. 
28 In the second study, 
scores were significantly better in 
the tonsillectomy group compared 
with the no tonsillectomy group at 
follow-up, but baseline measures 
were not reported. 
25
CHAT investigators also used the 
Conners’ rating scale to assess 
behavioral issues, including

baseline data, baseline scores on 
behavioral measures were not 
indicative of clinical concern. 
Although children’s behaviors 
improved in these studies, the clinical 
significance and magnitude of the 
improvement is not clear.
Executive Function
One RCT and 1 prospective cohort 
study used the Developmental 
Neuropsychological Assessment 
(NEPSY) to evaluate attention and 
the Behavior Rating Inventory of 
Executive Function (BRIEF) to 
assess behavioral regulation and 
metacognition (

Use and Other Outcomes
Two cohort studies with moderate 
risk of bias assessed health care 
use, defined as clinician contacts 
or antibiotic prescriptions, and 
cognitive outcomes ( 
Table 2). 
A single moderate risk of bias cohort 
study reported a 33% reduction in 
gross health care use, including a 
60% reduction in hospital admissions 
in the year after tonsillectomy in 
children with PSG-proven OSDB. 
Admissions in the untreated group 
increased (P = NR).

One cohort study using the Weschler 
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 
reported a significant improvement 
in performance IQ at 4-years 
posttonsillectomy in children who 
underwent tonsillectomy, but both 
the tonsillectomy and no surgery 
groups had declines or no change in

Strength of the Evidence
Our confidence in these conclusions 
of greater improvement in AHI 
and negative behaviors with 
tonsillectomy versus watchful 
waiting is low (low strength of 
evidence). We also found consistently 
greater improvement in sleep-related 
quality of life with tonsillectomy 
versus watchful waiting and have 
greater confidence in this conclusion 
(moderate strength of evidence). We 
could not make conclusions about 
effects on executive function or IQ 
(insufficient strength of evidence). 
 
Table 3 outlines the strength of 
evidence findings.
DISCUSSION
Relative to watchful waiting, most 
studies reported better OSDB 
and sleep-related outcomes in 
tonsillectomized children. The 5 
studies that included children whose 
OSDB was confirmed with PSG found 
that AHI scores improved more in 
children receiving a tonsillectomy 
than in those who did not undergo 
surgery (significant group differences 
in 3 studies).

17, 
 
25, 
 
27, 
28 Meta-
analysis of 3 studies reporting 
outcomes that could be combined 
showed a 4.8-point improvement 
in AHI in children who underwent 
tonsillectomy compared with no 
surgery. 
17, 
 
25, 
 
27 Sleep-related quality 
of life and negative behaviors (eg, 
anxiety and emotional lability) also 
improved more among children 
who had a tonsillectomy. 
15, 
17, 
 
25 
Changes in executive function were 
not significantly different between 
groups. 
17, 
 
28
The literature precludes firmer 
conclusions because relatively 
few studies have been published 
comparing tonsillectomy with a 
nonsurgical intervention for OSDB. 
Most studies provided little to no 
clinical outcome data, focusing 
instead on intermediate outcomes 
like the AHI. Patient populations 
were generally poorly characterized, 
and little information was available 
about the use of other treatments 
before surgery. Most of the evidence 
addressed short-term effects (<12 
months).
Limitations
We included studies published 
in English only because we 
identified few non-English studies 
of relevance in a preliminary scan 
of non-English literature. We also 
did not include studies addressing 
adenoidectomy alone or studies 
comparing tonsillectomy with 
adenoidectomy because the choice 
of procedure is likely driven by 
the indication for surgery; thus,

comparing these approaches 
would not be appropriate. Given 
the heterogeneity in anesthetic 
regimens, surgical techniques, 
postoperative analgesia and 
medications, and patient 
populations themselves, we were 
limited in our ability to stratify 
findings or identify potential 
subgroups that may respond 
more favorably to tonsillectomy 
or to supportive care. Long-term 
effects are limited in the literature 
base, particularly regarding 
outcomes that include growth 
and development, sleep quality 
outcomes, and behavioral outcomes 
for children with OSDB. Exploration 
of the demographics of patient 
populations more likely to be 
refractory to initial management 
strategies is also limited. A 
particular problem in the literature 
is a lack of full characterization of 
the patient population, particularly 
about clinically documented 
severity of sleep-disordered 
breathing. Understanding of 
“obstructive sleep-disordered 
breathing” and definitions of “cure” 
or resolution of symptoms varied 
from study to study, as did degree 
of hypertrophy. This heterogeneity 
makes the generalizability of the 
findings difficult to assess. The 
baseline severity of OSDB varied 
across studies.
Future Research Needs
Despite substantial research, the 
literature is largely silent on the 
natural history of OSDB that would 
provide a basis for the need for 
tonsillectomy in the long term. Many 
young patients may outgrow the need 
for intervention, but more data are 
needed to describe the potential to 
outgrow these indications to parents 
and to describe population factors 
that may predict resolution. 
20, 
 
33, 
 
34 
Long-term data are needed to enable 
caregivers to weigh the benefits 
of surgery versus the reality of 
managing their child’s condition as 
they wait for it to resolve, although 
obtaining longer-term data is difficult.
Future studies should take more care 
to characterize patient populations 
completely, including severity of 
OSDB, such that the applicability of 
findings can be specifically evaluated 
and potential candidates for surgery 
or watchful waiting identified. Clear 
characterization of comorbidities 
in studies is key for understanding 
the effects on subpopulations. As we 
learn more about the deleterious 
effects of sleep apnea and detection 
rates increase, more refined and 
specific treatment algorithms will be 
in demand. Future research should 
also address the current gaps in data 
surrounding treatment of special 
populations, including young children 
and children with comorbidities, such 
as obesity, craniofacial difference, 
and neuromuscular disease.
Measures commonly used to 
assess objective improvements in 
obstructed breathing, such as the 
AHI, are not patient-centered and 
may not reflect subjective reports 
of improvements or worsening of 
outcomes experienced by patients. 
Future research exploring the 
alignment of the AHI with patient-
reported outcomes, such as quality of 
life, would help to gauge the effects 
of tonsillectomy more precisely. 
Additionally, standardized measures 
of sleep outcomes are lacking. Finally, 
relatively little data exist regarding 
predictable factors contributing to 
the potential recurrence of symptoms 
after tonsillectomy for primary 
management. A better understanding 
of these factors would allow for more 
specific patient selection.
CONCLUSIONS
A tonsillectomy can improve 
sleep outcomes compared with 
no surgery in children with 
OSDB; however, modification of 
these benefits by comorbid and 
demographic characteristics are 
poorly characterized. Relative to no 
intervention, most studies reported 
better short-term sleep-related 
outcomes in children with OSDB 
who had a tonsillectomy. Additional 
research to define more precisely the 
population of children most likely to 
benefit from tonsillectomy compared 
with supportive care and to refine 
outcome measures to incorporate 
patient-focused assessment are key 
future research needs.
