Previous research finds connections between women in government, promotion of women’s issues, and government spending. However, the connection between
female politicians and population health warrants more significant attention. This study takes advantage of differences among Canadian provinces to evaluate the
effect of women in government on age-standardized all-cause mortality rates, to assess the potential mediating role of government spending, and to determine the
role played by political partisanship. Time-series cross-sectional data are retrieved from the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System II Tables for
1976–2009 (10 provinces and 34 years = 340 cases). Cumulative women in government is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians as a
percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Political partisanship is measured as the cumulative seats held by female politicians in left-wing, centre, and right-wing
parties as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960. Government spending is measured as the average of standard scores of four provincial expenditures: medical
care, preventive care, other social services, and post-secondary education. Health is measured as total, male and female age-standardized mortality rates per 1000
population (all causes of death). Estimation techniques include the Prais-Winsten regressions with panel-corrected SEs, a first-order autocorrelation correction model,
and fixed-unit effects, adjusted for alternative factors. We find that as the cumulative average percentage of women in government has historically risen, total, male,
and female mortality rates tend to be lower, net of alternative explanations. Government spending partially mediates the effect of women in government on mortality
rates. Moreover, increases in female politicians from left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties are all significantly associated with decreases in mortality rates. Women
in government can bring about desirable changes in population health. Our work encourages more debate and research about quotas and other measures designed to
level the political playing field for women.
1. Introduction
Over the last two decades, the percentage of women elected to na-
tional government among OECD countries increased by more than two-
thirds (67.2%). Whereas in 1997, only 16.9% of all national parlia-
mentarians were women, this number rose to 28.2% in 2016 (Inter-
Parliamentary Union, 2016). Over the same period, the number of
countries achieving the critical mass of 30 percent women in govern-
ment climbed from five to fourteen (Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2016).
These upward trends have generated scholarly interest about whether
women in government have a systematic and predictable influence on
population health. In this study, we contribute to this growing body of
work by testing the relationship between women in government, gov-
ernment spending, political partisanship, and age-standardized mor-
tality rates using time-series cross-sectional data among Canadian
provinces from 1976 to 2009. Our paper is organized in the following
manner. The next three sub-sections summarizes our theoretical loca-
tion, reviews the extant literature, and states our research questions.
Section 2 details our Methods, including our design, data sources and
variables, and data analysis. We then present our descriptive, bivariate,
and multivariate results in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss our results
and offer a concluding remark.
1.1. Theoretical location
1.1.1. Why should women in government matter to population health?
To understand how women in government might influence popu-
lation health, we seek theoretical guidance from political sociology. Our
theoretical location conceptualizes women in government as collective
political actors, who are more committed to advancing women’s in-
terests, to achieving a more equal distribution of societal resources, and
to triggering government spending in health-promoting ways.
First, women in government can be viewed as collective political
actors with some measure of power and authority in formal politics. As
such, they engage in various activities and actions that can have a
significant influence on decisions, policies, and outcomes associated
with a given conflict. According to the politics of presence theory, there
is a causal link between the number of women elected (i.e., descriptive
representation) and the advancement of women’s interests (i.e., sub-
stantive representation) (Phillips, 1995). If elected, women are more

T
 likely to speak, advocate, symbolize, and act on behalf of women and
children compared to their male counterparts. It follows that female
politicians are better equipped to represent the interests of female vo-
ters because they, at least to some extent, share the same experiences.
In addition to advancing women’s interests, Brady (2009) argues that
women in government are committed to a more equal distribution of
valuable societal resources (e.g., income, education, and wealth).
Compared to their male counterparts, female politicians are more likely
to hold leftist attitudes (e.g., civil rights, social equality, and egalitar-
ianism) and substantively advance women’s issues (e.g., pay equity,
violence against women, health care, family policy, and divisions in
paid and unpaid work) (Dodson, 1991; Wängnerud, 2009).
The political sociology literature also offers a potential mechanism
through which women in government might influence population
health: government spending. Existing studies find connections be-
tween female politicians and spending preferences tied to health-pro-
moting issues such as healthcare, family benefits, social services, and
education (Bratton & Ray, 2002). Using cross-sectional time-series data
among twelve OECD countries, Bolzendahl and Brooks (2007) find that
a single standard unit change in the level of women’s political re-
presentation results in approximately a 1% increase in welfare state
spending. Recent epidemiological research confirms the importance of
government spending to population health (Beckfield & Bambra, 2016;
Ng & Muntaner, 2015). When countries devote a more significant share
of their economies to social welfare expenditures, population health
and health inequalities tend to improve and narrow, respectively
(Beckfield & Bambra, 2016; Dahl & van der Wel, 2013; Ng & Muntaner,
2015). Government spending shapes and influences population health
through various public policies and programs that meet basic needs,
manage common risks, and redistribute health-promoting resources.
The theoretical and empirical connections between women in govern-
ment, promotion of women’s interests, and government spending have
been established. The connection between women in government and
population health remains in its infancy. Lastly, if women in govern-
ment matters population health, the political sociology literature sug-
gests that the partisan makeup of elected female representatives might
matter as well. Partisan political theory contends that a primary de-
terminant of variation in policy choices and policy outputs in con-
stitutional democracies is the party ideology of government (Alesina,
1995; Castles, 1982; Garrett, 1998; Garrett & Lange, 1989; Hibbs, 1992;
Huber & Stephens, 2001). The ideological stance of political parties
ranges more or less along a left-right ideological scale (Castles & Mair,
1984; Cross, 2011). The political ideology of left-wing political parties
is often associated with being social democratic, egalitarian, collecti-
vist, and interventionist. Left-wing political parties tend to support a
broad safety net of social welfare programs, including universal child
care, education, and Medicare (Castles & Mair, 1984; Cross, 2011). In
contrast, right-wing parties tend to favour private enterprise, big
business, and free markets as well as competitiveness, restructuring,
deficit reduction, and privatization. Right-wing parties are commonly
associated with fiscal conservatism, which includes the explicit goal of
reducing government spending. As for centre political parties, their
ideological preferences reflect a moderate or centrist position that falls
between the left and right of the political spectrum (Blais, 2005). Given
these ideological differences, it remains unknown whether female po-
liticians from left-wing, centre, and right-wing parties exert differential
effects on population health.
1.2. Previous research
A small but growing body of research finds connections between
women in government and population health. This work has taken
place within three relevant contexts. First, among OECD countries, two
critical studies were conducted by Lynch et al. (2001) and Muntaner
et al. (2002). The former used the 1990–91 wave of the World Values
Survey
to
investigate
cross-sectional
associations
between
the
proportion of women elected to national government and life ex-
pectancy, mortality rates, and low birth weight among 16 wealthy
countries. Correlation results indicate that having more females in
government is associated with lower rates of female (r = − 0.63) and
male infant mortality (r = − 0.73) (Lynch et al., 2001). Using the same
data and methods, Muntaner et al. (2002) measured women in gov-
ernment, as the percentage of elected seats in national governments
occupied by women, and find that rates of low birth weight and infant
deaths from all causes were significantly lower in countries with more
women in government. The second context of research has been con-
ducted among low- and middle-income countries. Swiss, Fallon, and
Burgos (2012) used pooled time-series analyses to examine the whether
increases in women legislators are predictive of improvements in child
health among 102 developing countries from 1980 to 2005. Compared
to countries with no women in government, countries meeting a 20-
percent threshold of women in government had higher rates of measles
immunizations (10 percentage points), DPT immunizations (12 per-
centage points), infant survival (0.7 percentage points) and child sur-
vival (1 percentage point). More recently, Quamruzzaman and Lange
(2016) conducted a multilevel analysis of the impact of female political
representation in national parliaments on child health. Using cross-
sectional data for 51 low- and middle-income countries and long-
itudinal data for 20 countries, they find that female representation is
negatively related to infant mortality and positively related to measles
vaccination status. Moreover, Quamruzzaman and Lange (2016) finds
that state spending accounts for some of the mediation effects between
female representation and child health.
Third, existing studies also have tested the effects of women in
government within the U.S. Kawachi, Kennedy, Gupta, and Prothrow-
Stith (1999) used a cross-sectional ecological design to investigate the
effect of women’s representation in elected office, measured at the
state-level as representatives, senators, and governors, on female and
male mortality rates and mean days of activity limitations reported by
women during the previous month. Correlation results indicate that
higher political participation by women is associated with lower female
mortality rates (r = − 0.51), as well as lower activity limitations (r =
− 0.47). More recently, Homan (2017) used administrative data with
fixed-effects and random-effects models to investigate the relationship
between political gender inequality in state legislatures and state infant
mortality rates in the United States from 1990 to 2012. Homan (2017)
finds that higher percentages of women in state legislatures are asso-
ciated with reduced infant mortality rates, both between states and
within states over time. On one hand, these studies draw much needed
attention to the beneficial effects of women’s political representation on
population health. On the other, this body of research is limited in
several ways. First, existing studies suffer from the small “N-problem,”
which arises when the number of macro-level units of analysis is in-
herently limited (Lynch et al., 2001; Muntaner et al., 2002). Second,
half of the reviewed studies above do not control for unobserved het-
erogeneity (i.e., omitted variable bias) due to their reliance on corre-
lational methods (Lynch et al., 2001; Muntaner et al., 2002). Third,
only one study to date has considered the potential mediating role of
government spending (Quamruzzaman & Lange, 2016). It remains un-
known whether government spending either accounts for all or some of
the health effects of women in government on population health.
Fourth, previous studies have not assessed the influence of partisan
effects, or whether women in government from different political par-
ties are predictive of varying levels of population health. Given that left-
wing, centre, and right-wing political parties have divergent policy
preferences (Schmidt, 1996, 2002), the effect of partisan politics and
women in government warrants greater attention. Lastly, the links be-
tween women in government and population health have not been
tested in Canada. Canada and its provinces offer a promising context to
advance the women in government-population health hypothesis. Ca-
nadian provinces are sub-national jurisdictions with sufficient political
autonomy to generate different social, economic, and health outcomes.

 The number of women in government, government expenditures, and
mortality rates all vary across provinces and over time (Dunn, 2016; Ng
& Muntaner, 2015).
1.3. Research questions
In this time-series cross-sectional study, we contribute to the extant
literature by specifically addressing the above limitations. Our research
questions are three-fold. First, does the cumulative strength of women in
government influence the age-standardized all-cause mortality rates among
Canadian provinces from 1976 to 2009? Second, does government spending
mediate the effect of women in government on mortality rates? Third, do
women in government from left-wing, centre, and right-wing political parties
have differential effects on mortality rates?
2. Methods
2.1. Design
This study pools time-series cross-sectional data of ten Canadian
provinces from 1976 to 2009, including Newfoundland, Prince Edward
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.
2.2. Data sources and variables
Data are retrieved from Provincial Election Offices and Statistics
Canada’s Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System
(CANSIM) II Tables. Our dependent variables are total, male, and female
age-standardized mortality rates per 1000 population (all causes of death).
These variables are age-standardized to the 1991 Canadian Census.
Cumulative women in government is measured as the cumulative seats
held by female politicians as a percentage of provincial seats since 1960
(Huber, Ragin, Stephens, Brady, & Beckfield, 2004). This measure cal-
culates women in government as a proportion of seats held by all
government parties in each year and then sums these percentages since
1960. Cumulative left women in government is measured as the cumula-
tive seats held by female politicians in left-wing political parties (e.g.,
Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, New Democratic, Parti Qué-
bécois) as a percentage of provincial seats held since 1960. The vari-
ables cumulative centre women in government and cumulative right women
in government are measured the same as cumulative left women in
government, but for centre (e.g., Liberal) and right-wing political parties
(e.g., Action Démocratique du Québec, Progressive Conservative, Sas-
katchewan Party, Social Credit), respectively. Data on women in gov-
ernment includes a maximum of 340 province-years as cases. Govern-
ment spending is measured as the average of standard scores (z-scores) of
four provincial expenditures: medical care, preventive care, other social
services, and post-secondary education (Statistics Canada, 2009). Re-
cent work shows that these four expenditures are significant predictors
of lower mortality rates among Canadian provinces between 1989 and
2009 (Ng & Muntaner, 2015) This variable is available for a total of 210
cases.
In all models, we control for several demographic, labour market,
and economic variables. Dependency ratio is measured as the number of
“dependents” for every 100 “workers”: youth (ages 0–17) + seniors
(age 65 or older) per 100 workers (aged 18–64). Controlling for this
variable is important because a higher proportion of non-working de-
pendents such as children and seniors may affect the demand for gov-
ernment spending in the form of welfare services and social transfers
(Landon,
McMillan,
Muralidharan,
&
Parsons,
2006;
Pampel
&
Williamson, 1988). Immigrant population is the percentage of im-
migrants. This variable controls for the ‘healthy immigrant effect’ and
the uneven distribution of immigrants across provinces (Ng, Wilkins,
Gendron, & Berthelot, 2005; Statistics Canada, 2006). Women in labour
force refer to the percentage of women in the labour force for each
province and is included as a control variable because of its potential
role between government spending and population health (Raphael &
Bryant, 2004). Welfare states with high levels of government spending
tend to institute social service policies as a means of creating employ-
ment and facilitating the integration of women in the labour force. Such
policies can have the effect of improving population health outcomes
(Navarro & Shi, 2001; Navarro et al., 2006). Unemployment rate is the
percentage of the total labour force unemployed for each province and
is included as a measure of the current state of the economy. Among
Canadian provinces, the association between unemployment and health
has produced contradictory evidence, which may be due to modelling
assumptions about age. Whereas Laporte and Ferguson (2003) find that
higher unemployment rates are associated with higher age-standar-
dized mortality rates, other research has demonstrated a strong pro-
cyclical pattern in the mortality rates of middle-aged Canadians
(Ariizumi & Schirle, 2012). Low income refers to the percentage of all
persons with low income after tax, set at 50% of adjusted median
household income. Adjusting for low income is essential given its causal

 association with poor living conditions, food insecurity, inadequate
housing, and other basic prerequisites of population health (Auger &
Alix, 2009). Real GDP per capita is the gross domestic product in real per
capita terms and deflated using the 2002 consumer price index. The
market value of all goods and services produced in a given province is
likely to be a principal determinant of government spending and po-
pulation health (Elola, Daponte, & Navarro, 1995). This variable re-
flects the magnitude of a province’s tax base and controls for the overall
level of economic development of a province for a given year. Table 1
presents descriptive statistics for the variables used in this analysis. A
full description of variable definitions and data sources is available in
Table S1.
2.3. Data analysis
Our statistical methods are four-fold. First, we use scatterplots with
fitted values to display bivariate correlations between women in gov-
ernment, government spending, and total mortality rates. Second, we
model the effect of women in government and partisan women in
government on total, male, and female mortality rates without con-
trolling for government spending. Our regression models use Prais-
Winsten estimates with panel-corrected standard errors (PW-PCSE), a
first-order autocorrelation correction (AR1), and fixed-unit effects
(Beck & Katz, 1995). PW-PCSE is well-suited to handle the ‘temporal
dominant’ nature of the data set (i.e., 34 years > 10 years), and corrects
for
two
potential
violations:
panel
heteroscedasticity
and
con-
temporaneous correlation of errors (Reed & Ye, 2011). AR1 addresses
the possibility of serial correlation of errors. Fixed-unit effects (dum-
mies for N – 1 units) control for potential non-spherical errors in the
cross-sectional dimension (i.e., unobserved heterogeneity or omitted
variable bias). Fixed-time effects (dummies for N – 1 years) are ex-
cluded because they tend to aborob much of the trend in the dependent
variable, leaving little to no variance for the explanatory variables
(Plümper, Troeger, & Manow, 2005). Of note, our dependent variables
are measured in levels and changes are determined by long-term
changes in the independent variables (women in government). Mea-
suring dependent variables in levels, opposed to short-term differences
from year-to-year, is an appropriate approach to understanding the
long-term effects of political variables (Huber & Stephens, 2001). All
models control for dependency ratio, urban population, immigrant
population, female labour force participation, unemployment, low in-
come, and GDP per capita. Third, we conduct a mediation analysis by
regressing total, male, and female mortality rates on government
spending and women in government in the same model. Fourth, we
repeat steps 2 and 3 with left, centre, and right women in government
as independent variables.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive trends and bivariate associations
Trends in women in government and mortality rates represent sig-
nificant changes among Canadian provinces. Between 1976 and 2009,
the percentage of women in provincial government increased six-fold
from 4.2% to 25.9% while age-standardized all-cause mortality rates
declined by 37.5% (8.85 to 5.53 deaths per 1000 population) (Elections
Canada, 2018; Statistics Canada, 2018a). Trends in government
spending have witnessed changes as well - total provincial expenditures
in real per capita terms increased from $5910 in 1989 to $8651 in 2009
(Statistics Canada, 2018b). Figs. 1 and 2 show strong negative and
positive relationships between women in government and total mor-
tality rates (r = − 0.90) and women in government and government
spending (r = 0.64). As the average percentage of women in govern-
ment has historically risen, total mortality rates have declined, and
government spending has increased.
3.2. Regression models
In Table 2, models 1–3 show that women in government have a
significant negative effect on total, male, and female mortality rates, net
of alternative factors. For a standard deviation increase in the cumu-
lative average of women in government (1.92%), total, male, and fe-
male mortality rates are expected to decline by about 0.69–0.71 stan-
dard deviations. Interestingly, women in government have a more
substantial negative effect on male mortality rates than female rates
(1.00 vs 0.44 deaths per 1000 population). When government spending
is added in models 4–6, the effect of women in government remains
significant (standardized coefficients decrease from 0.76 to 0.54), and
government spending has a significant negative effect. These results
suggest that government spending partially mediates the inverse re-
lationship between women in government and mortality rates. The
standardized effects of left, centre, and right women in government on
total, male, and female mortality rates are presented in Figs. 3–5. Each
figure displays three sets of bars – one set for total, male, and female
mortality outcomes. The first bar within each set displays the effect of
left, centre, or right women in government (see bars shaded in black).
The second and third bars in each set are the effects of left, centre, or
right women in government and government spending in the same
model (see bars shaded in gray). Two findings are worth noting. First,

 women in government from all three political affiliations have a sig-
nificant negative effect on total, male, and female mortality rates. For
example, for a standard deviation increase in the cumulative average of
left, centre, or right women in government, total mortality rates are
expected to decline by 0.36, 0.40, and 0.21 standard deviations, re-
spectively.
Second, after government spending is added to the models, the
standardized effects of left, centre, and right women in government are
reduced and remain significantly negative for seven of the nine mor-
tality outcomes. The two exceptions include the effect of left and right
women in government on female mortality rates, which are both en-
tirely mediated through government spending (see Figs. 3 and 5). Full
regression results are presented in Tables S2 (left women in govern-
ment), S3 (centre women in government), and S4 (right women in
government).
4. Discussion
This study contributes to the growing field of political epidemiology
by investigating the links between women in government, government
spending, political partisanship, and mortality rates among Canadian
provinces (Kickbusch, 2015; Navarro et al., 2006). Theoretically, our
approach demonstrates the value of applying insights from political
sociology to population health. In doing so, we conceptualize women in
government as leftist collective political actors and confirm their role a
macrosocial determinant of population health. This is akin to moving
backwards in the casual process and generating a fuller understanding
of the effects of politics on health. Empirically, we find that women in
government are predictive of mortality rates. As the cumulative average
percentage of women in government has historically risen, total, male,
and female mortality rates tend to be lower, net of alternative ex-
planations. In concrete terms, a standard deviation increase in women
in government would reduce total, male, and female mortality rates,
respectively, by 0.68, 1.00, and 0.44 deaths per 1000 population. Be-
sides finding that women in government matter, our results show that
government spending partially mediates the effect of women in gov-
ernment on mortality rates. Because women in government and gov-
ernment spending are both significant predictors of mortality rates, this
suggests at least two possible mechanisms. First, women in government
reduce mortality rates by triggering specific types of government
spending, including medical care, preventive care, post-secondary
education, and social services. This mechanism reflects the politics of

 presence theory, or the idea that women in government are more in-
clined to legislate certain issues based on their experiences either as
women in the labour force or as mothers (Phillips, 1995). Previous
political sociology research shows that women in government are more
likely to advance public policies meant to support government spending
in general, and women, children, and social welfare in particular (Anzia
& Berry, 2011; Bolzendahl & Brooks, 2007; Bratton & Ray, 2002;
Volden, Wiseman, & Wittmer, 2016). Our study extends the implica-
tions of women in government to include improvements in population
health (i.e., reductions in mortality rates). Future work could consider
how women in government might improve population health by en-
acting public policies (e.g., offering universal, government-subsidized
daycare) or improving the quality of existing programs (e.g., extending
the number of weeks for parental leave) that are not captured by gov-
ernment spending data.
Second, women in government influence population health in non-
government spending ways. After controlling for government spending,
the effect of women of government remains significantly negative for
total, male, and female mortality rates, and their standardized coeffi-
cients are reduced by 36%, 31%, and 45%, respectively. Since women
in government appear to have an additional effect on mortality rates net
of government spending, future work could assess whether these ‘ad-
ditional effects’ also operate as relevant mechanisms. For example, re-
search on gender politics finds that women in government govern dif-
ferently than men. The former tends to interrupt less, pay closer
attention to other people’s nonverbal cues, and use a more democratic,

 collaborative, and bipartisan governing style compared to male politi-
cians (Eagly & Johnson, 1990; Kathlene, 1994). Other work suggests
that women in government might also govern differently by attitudes,
opinions, and behaviours; changing internal working procedures, or
encouraging more trust in government (Wängnerud, 2009). If women in
government are more likely to build coalitions, reach consensus more
quickly, and adopt more accommodative strategies than men, it would
be interesting to see if such governing and legislative differences have a
differential effect on population health.
Regarding political partisanship, this is the first study to find a ro-
bust negative relationship between left-wing, centre, and right-wing
women in government and mortality rates. The ideological differences
among social democratic, centrist, and fiscal conservative political
parties appear less salient to mortality rates than increasing the actual
number of women elected to government. While partisanship may
matter to the ideological positions of political parties, we find no evi-
dence that the partisan makeup of women in government has adverse
effects on population health. With this said, we do find differences in
the extent to which left, centre, and right women in government reduce
mortality rates. Left and centre women in government have a larger
effect on mortality rates than right women in government. For a stan-
dard deviation increase in the cumulative average of left and centre
women in government, total mortality rates would decline by 0.35 and
0.39 deaths per 1,000, respectively. A similar increase in the cumula-
tive average of right women in government would result in only 0.21
fewer deaths per 1000. After adding government spending to the par-
tisan political models, we find broad evidence that left, centre, and
right women in government combines with government spending to
reduce mortality rates. We do find two exceptions; however, the effects
of left and right women in government are fully mediated through
government spending. These results lend support to the first mechanism
identified above - left and right women in government matter to female
mortality by triggering government spending. Further work is required
to confirm or refute the nonpartisan and fully mediated effects pre-
sented here.
4.1. Limitations and strengths
Regarding limitations, our ecological study uses aggregate data to
model cross-sectional associations between women in government,
government spending, and population health. Given the exploratory
nature of our findings, more work using different designs and methods,
such as natural experiments, instrumental variables, and propensity
score matching, are needed to increase the generalizability of our re-
sults (Sedgwick, 2014). Moreover, to bolster the search for causal ex-
planations, we strongly encourage the use of qualitative methods to
examine underlying mechanisms that might explain how, why, and
under what circumstances women in government make substantive
contributions to government spending and population health (Pawson,
Greenhalgh, Harvey, & Walshe, 2005). Another drawback involves the
implicit assumption of uniform lags concerning time-invariant vari-
ables. When estimating the effect of women in government on mortality
rates, lags may seriously differ from unit (province) to unit (province)
(Plümper et al., 2005). In our study, we opted not to lag our in-
dependent variables because the institutional settings and environ-
ments between provinces are more alike than different (Tsebelis, 2002).
Lastly, the available time frame to test government spending as a
mediator is shorter than desired. However, 1989 is the earliest year for
which reliable data on provincial expenditures are available from
Statistics Canada (2009). Despite the shorter than preferred time frame,
the analyses still found significant government spending effects on
mortality rates. Several study strengths are worth noting. First, our
study overcomes the small “N-problem” by constructing a time-series
cross-sectional dataset that pools cross-sectional units (ten Canadian
provinces) with time series data (thirty-four years). Second, our esti-
mation techniques control for and reduce unobserved heterogeneity
and omitted variable bias through the use of fixed effects models (i.e.,
including dummies for N - 1 units). Third, as revealed through our
mediation analyses, we find new evidence to support the idea that
women in government combines with government spending to reduce
mortality rates. Lastly, our study is the first to evaluate the links be-
tween political partisanship, women in government, government
spending, and mortality rates within a Canadian context.
5. Conclusions
More women are becoming elected officials in political office;
however, they remain underrepresented at all levels of government.
The average number of seats held by women remains below 30% in
national parliaments among OECD countries (Inter-Parliamentary
Union, 2016). Healthy democracies are dependent on the active and
equitable representation of women in government. Democracies fail to
thrive and flourish if half of its population remains politically unheard,
overlooked, and disempowered. We contend that electing more women
in government not only promotes gender equality and strengthens de-
mocratic institutions but also makes real and substantive contributions
to government spending and population health. A wide range of stra-
tegies have been proposed and implemented to help increase the
number of women in government, including for example, funding
public awareness campaigns that highlight the benefits of electing more
females; developing mentoring programs that match established female
politicians with aspiring female candidates; and supporting non-par-
tisan women’s organizations and legislative caucuses that aim to help
elect female candidates into office. Another strategy is the use of
electoral gender quotas, which set numerical targets or specify the
number or percentage of women to be included on candidate lists or
allocated to seats in a legislature. To date, gender quotas have shown to
be one of the most useful tools for ‘fast-tracking’ women into multiple
levels of government (Dahlerup, Hilal, Kalandadze, & Kandawasvika-
Nhundu, 2013). Given that women in government can bring about
desirable changes in population health, we encourage more debate and
research about quotas and other measures designed to level the political
playing field for women.
