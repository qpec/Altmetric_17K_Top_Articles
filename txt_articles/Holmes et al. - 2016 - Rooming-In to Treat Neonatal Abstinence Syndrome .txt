Between 2000 and 2009, opioid 
use during pregnancy tripled in the 
United States, and rates of neonatal 
abstinence syndrome (NAS) doubled 
between 2009 and 2012 to 0.58% of 
live births.1–3 Newborns with NAS 
occupy 4% of US NICU beds.4 NAS 
incidence varies regionally and is 
highly prevalent in northern New 
England, with a 2012 rate of 1.9% 
of neonates at our tertiary center.5 
By 2014, 6% of newborns at our 
institution had confirmed exposure to 
opioids in utero.
Newborns with moderate to severe 
NAS are typically treated with oral 
opioids, and then weaned over 
days to weeks.2 Pharmacologically 
treated NAS is prolonged and costly, 
with lengths of stay (LOS) of 2 to 
12 weeks and estimated charges 
of $90

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incidence and associated costs of neonatal 
abstinence syndrome (NAS) have recently risen sharply; newborns with 
NAS occupy 4% of NICU beds. We implemented a coordinated program for 
NAS including standardized protocols for scoring, medications and weaning, 
and a calm rooming-in environment, to improve family-centered care and to 
decrease both length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs.
METHODS: In early 2013, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team began 
consecutive plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. We trained nurses in modified 
Finnegan scoring, ensured scoring only after on-demand feeds during skin-
to-skin care, and standardized physician score interpretation. We provided 
prenatal family education, increased family involvement in symptom 
monitoring and nonpharmacologic treatment, and treated otherwise 
healthy infants on the inpatient pediatric unit instead of in the NICU. We 
measured outcomes using statistical process control methods.
RESULTS: At baseline, 46% of inborn infants at-risk for NAS were treated with 
morphine; by 2015, this decreased to 27%. Adjunctive use of phenobarbital 
decreased from 13% to 2% in the same period. Average LOS for morphine-
treated newborns decreased from 16.9 to 12.3 days, average hospital 
costs per treated infant decreased from $19 
737 to $8755, and costs per 
at-risk infant dropped from $11 
000 to $5300. Cumulative morphine dose 
decreased from 13.7 to 6.6 mg per treated newborn. There were no adverse 
events, and 30-day readmission rates remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: A coordinated, standardized NAS program safely reduced 
pharmacologic therapy, LOS, and hospital costs. Rooming-in with family and 
decreased use of NICU beds were central to achieved outcomes.

to decrease resource utilization 
include rooming-in; low-stimuli

with NAS are typically cared for in 
NICUs, where daily cost of care is

16
At project outset at our hospital, 
there was not a coordinated, 
standardized system that determined 
when, where, and how newborns 
with NAS would be cared for, and 
expectations for family participation 
in care were variable. The aim of 
this project was to improve the 
care of opioid-exposed newborns 
by involving families, standardizing 
assessment and treatment, and 
transitioning to rooming-in for the 
full hospital stay. Specifically, we 
sought to decrease the proportion of 
opioid-exposed infants treated with 
medications and to decrease LOS and 
costs.
METHODS
Ethical Concerns
The Dartmouth Committee for 
the Protection of Human Subjects 
determined the project exempt from 
review as quality improvement. 
There was involvement and oversight 
from the Children’s Hospital at 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock (CHaD) Section 
of Neonatology, Director of Nursing, 
and the Chief Officer of Quality and 
Safety.
Setting
CHaD is a Children’s Hospital 
Association member, 63-bed/16-
basinette children’s hospital within 
a 396-bed rural academic tertiary 
care center. CHaD provides inpatient, 
critical care, and pediatric specialty 
services to most of New Hampshire 
and a portion of Vermont, with 
∼1400 inborn infants, 450 neonatal 
critical care admissions, and 2500 
pediatric inpatient admissions 
annually.
Before 2013, opioid-exposed 
newborns roomed-in on a mother-
infant unit, with a minimum 
observation period of 96 hours after 
exposure to long-acting opioids. 
Newborns needing increased 
observation or pharmacologic 
intervention with oral morphine 
transferred to the NICU; 
morphine was supplemented with 
phenobarbital or clonidine in severe 
cases. After stabilization, patients 
sometimes transferred to inpatient 
pediatrics, where families could 
resume rooming-in and provide 
newborn care. This system was based 
on provider and staff competencies 
and preferences, not on family 
wishes, and often resulted in multiple 
transitions for families and multiple 
handovers between teams across 
different units. The open-bay NICU 
layout was not ideal for opioid-
exposed infants or families. A sentinel 
case that drove improvement was an 
infant who transferred units 7 times 
during 1 hospitalization.
Planning the Intervention
In early 2013, because NAS 
incidence was rising, we formed a 
multidisciplinary team of subject-
matter experts and front-line 
clinicians, including physicians, 
nurse practitioners, nurses, medical 
and undergraduate students, social 
workers, laboratory personnel, a 
parent representative, and a hospital 
administrator. The team divided into 
several small workgroups to plan 
and implement early PDSA cycles; in 
late 2013, key project components 
transitioned to an operations team 
for implementation of care model 
changes. Motivators for change are 
summarized in Fig 1.
Phase 1: Small-Scale Clinical Processes
PDSA cycle 1 focused on 
standardization of modified Finnegan 
scoring on all 3 units (mother-infant, 
NICU, pediatrics), within the Vermont 
Oxford Network NAS improvement 
collaborative.17 A training tool used 
videos of infants with NAS, and the 
project team conducted spot checks 
of interrater reliability between 2 
independent, blinded raters.18 In the 
second PDSA cycle, we conducted 
qualitative interviews with families 
of newborns hospitalized with NAS, 
which yielded information that 
shaped further PDSA cycles 
(Table 1).19
Families informed us that some 
infants were being awakened from 
sleep for scoring, given points for 
crying when hungry, and removed 
from family members’ arms to be 
assessed. PDSA cycle 3 changed the 
timing of NAS scoring to every 2 to 4 
hours just after each feeding, during 
skin-to-skin holding, while the infant 
and family were already awake 
(“infant-centered scoring”). Because 
families desired more education 
about NAS and direct involvement 
in care, 
19 PDSA cycle 4 involved 
prenatal preparation sessions at 
2 local perinatal substance abuse 
treatment centers and updated 
education materials on NAS for 
obstetric clinic appointments. In 
PDSA cycle 5, we incorporated 
parent symptom recording into care 
processes.
The physicians led PDSA cycle 6, 
wherein they changed modified 
Finnegan score interpretation. Like 
many other centers, we had initiated 
or increased morphine treatment 
of 3 consecutive scores of ≥8 or 2 
consecutive scores of ≥12. Outcomes 
of this approach have never been 
rigorously evaluated, and clinical 
practices vary widely.20–22 Although 
we continued to use scores as guides, 
we no longer strictly initiated, 
increased, or weaned morphine 
based on scores alone. We placed 
more emphasis on overall infant

condition and prioritized concern for 
feeding difficulty, poor weight gain, 
inability to sleep, and inconsolability 
above items with fewer detrimental 
effects (ie, tremors, increased tone, 
sneezing, yawning) (Table 2). The 
physician group delayed initiating 
pharmacotherapy in the first 24 
to 36 hours when exposure to 
long-acting opioids together with 
tobacco or selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors exacerbated 
early withdrawal symptoms; these 
exposures co-occur frequently.23
Phase 2: Hospital Operations Processes
By fall 2013, small-scale changes 
were progressing but not yielding 
significant results, and the team 
advocated for full rooming-in with 
all observation and treatment on the

mother-infant and pediatric units for 
patients without other conditions 
requiring critical care. Administrative 
changes were needed for this phase. 
We began with a pilot group of 10 
opioid-dependent women treated in 
the Dartmouth-Hitchcock perinatal 
addiction treatment program. 
Prenatal education prepared families 
for the hospital stay and included 
instruction on ideal environmental 
measures, expected LOS, and the 
expectation of a consistent family 
caregiver. Contemporaneously, we 
conducted staff education on how 
to best work and communicate with 
families struggling through addiction 
and recovery.
Analysis of the pilot yielded 
additional recommendations: 
expansion for all infants, and 
implementation of a volunteer 
program to support families. 
Both were accomplished by early 
July 2014. The volunteers cared 
for patients when parents were 
unavailable. In the final PDSA cycles, 
we admitted newborns transferred 
from other hospitals to our pediatric 
unit and changed morphine dosing 
from every 4 to every 3 hours to be 
more aligned with both morphine 
half-life and newborn sleep and 
feeding cycles.
Planning the Study of the 
Intervention
We included all birth hospitalizations 
between March 2012 and February 
2015 with reported or laboratory 
confirmed maternal opioid use. A 
research nurse (J.D.J.) tracked and 
reported data quarterly, and another 
team member (E.C.A.) manually 
reviewed charts to verify abstracted 
data.
Description of Measures
Outcomes of interest included 
concordance of paired scores by 
independent observers, average daily 
score, percentage treated with oral 
morphine, percentage treated with 
an adjunctive medication, cumulative 
morphine dose, LOS, and costs for 
all opioid-exposed infants and for 
those treated pharmacologically. For 
balancing measures we examined 
adverse events (death or unplanned 
ICU transfer), 30-day readmissions, 
and discharge in parental care, and 
we contacted primary care providers 
of 2014 newborns with higher NAS 
scores who were discharged without 
pharmacologic treatment to examine 
any unintended consequences.
Methods of Evaluation and Analysis 
of Results
We excluded infants who were either 
not “otherwise well newborns” 
because of gestational age <35 weeks 
or another reason for NICU admission 
or who completed treatment at 
another facility. The 3 years of the 
intervention were divided as baseline 
year (March 1, 2012–February 28, 
2013), intervention year 1 (March 
1, 2013–February 28, 2014), and 
intervention year 2 (March 1, 2014–
February 28, 2015) because the first 
clinical changes began in March 2013.
We used κ correlations for interrater 
reliability measures. We calculated 
mean daily, modified Finnegan 
scores for each newborn, with day 1 
beginning at the first 7:00 AM of life. 
To test for change in scoring across 
years, we used a mixed effects linear 
regression model, including year, day 
of life, and treatment as fixed effects. 
Random effects were used to account 
for variation within infant, and 
first-order autoregressive variance 
covariance structure to account 
for time. We tested for changes in 
infant median, maximum, or first 
score across years using analysis of 
variance.
We compared static categorical 
variables by Fisher exact test and 
static continuous variables by 
independent t test. We used analysis 
of means for categorical variables 
over time, and statistical process 
control (XmR) charts for continuous 
variables over time. We recalculated 
XmR means and control limits when 
interventions led to all subsequent 
data points being on 1 side of the 
center line (24). We calculated 
hospital costs by multiplying 
hospital charges by annualized 
cost-to-charge ratios.
RESULTS
From March 2012 to February 2015, 
207 newborns were observed and/or 
treated for NAS. Of these, 163 (79%) 
met inclusion criteria, including 54 
in the preintervention year, 61 in 
intervention year 1 and 48 in year 2. 
Sixty-nine newborns (42%) received 
pharmacologic treatment including 
28 (17%) infants born at outside 
hospitals and transferred for NAS 
therapy. The average birth weight 
was 2979 g (range 1775–4200 g), 
and average estimated gestational 
age was 39 weeks (range 35–42 
weeks). Half of mothers (75) were in 
opioid maintenance programs, with a 
quarter of these (16) on maintenance 
methadone and three-quarters (59) 
on buprenorphine.
From September to December 2013, 
each unit conducted 10 paired, 
blinded, modified Finnegan scores.

>90% for all units in all months. 
Mean daily score did not change over 
time. Adjusting for day of life and 
treatment, score coefficients relative 
to baseline were not significant for 
year 1 (0.23, P = .35) or year 2 (0.12, 
P = .66). There was no significant 
difference in median score, maximum 
score, or first score by year (P = 
.53, 0.29, 0.48, respectively). The 
proportion of newborns requiring 
treatment with morphine declined 
over time from 46% to 27%, 
as did the percent of newborns 
requiring adjunctive treatment with 
phenobarbital or clonidine (Fig 2).
The cumulative morphine exposure 
per treated infant decreased from 
13.7 mg during the preintervention 
year to 6.6 mg by project completion 
(Fig 3A). The average length of stay 
for pharmacologically treated NAS 
decreased from 16.9 to 12.3 days (Fig 
3B). LOS for newborns not requiring 
pharmacologic treatment remained 
stable (4.2–4.4 days, P = .33). Mean 
hospital costs for newborns requiring 
pharmacologic treatment declined 
from $19 
737 to $8755 (Fig 3C), 
and costs for all opioid-exposed 
newborns also decreased, from 
$11 
000 during the study’s baseline 
year to $5300 during the second 
intervention year (P < .01).
There were no adverse events. 
Thirty-day all-cause readmission 
remained stable. Two newborns 
were readmitted during the baseline 
year, with 3 and 4 newborns 
readmitted during the first and 
second years of intervention (4%, 
5%, and 7% respectively, P = .46). No 
newborns were readmitted for NAS 
treatment; however, 1 newborn in 
the baseline year and 1 in the second 
intervention year were admitted 
for failure to thrive, possibly due to 
NAS. One infant readmitted during 
the first intervention year suffered 
a skull fracture after a fall. All other 
readmissions were for infection 
concern or hyperbilirubinemia, 
issues likely unrelated to NAS. The 
number of newborns discharged in 
parental custody remained stable: 
93% in the baseline year and 90% 
in the second intervention year 
(P = .73). Primary care providers 
of 10 high-risk newborns in the 
intervention phase (higher NAS 
scores but no pharmacologic 
treatment or treatment with LOS 
under 12 days) reported no growth 
or feeding concerns at 1 to 4 months.
DISCUSSION
We describe a successful quality 
improvement (QI) effort to 
standardize scoring, rooming-in, and 
environmental and pharmacological 
management of NAS. We decreased 
the proportion of opioid-exposed 
newborns treated pharmacologically, 
use of adjunctive agents, LOS for 
treated infants, and costs for all 
opioid-exposed infants, including 
the subset treated for NAS. While 
achieving these outcomes, we 
engaged families in the improvement 
process, we increased family 
preparation and involvement, and we 
trained our clinical teams to better 
serve those struggling with addiction.

The decreased LOS and costs 
began contemporaneously with 
the rooming-in pilot and change in 
physician score interpretation then 
dropped further and sustained after 
full rooming-in. The control limits 
became narrower, demonstrating 
decreased variability (Fig 3B). 
Development and sustenance of the 
volunteer program was critical for 
successful rooming-in. Team training 
on working with families struggling 
with addiction, including content 
on trauma-informed care, and 
case-based training in small groups 
(academic detailing) were important 
for success. Process changes are 
likely sustainable because a small, 
stable pediatric hospitalist team 
attends in both newborn nursery 
and inpatient pediatrics, and our 
neonatologists prefer that care of 
opioid-exposed infants occur in a 
noncritical care setting. The infant 
volunteer program is permanent, 
maintained via nursing leadership, 
and oversubscribed with new 
volunteers.
Our study had numerous strengths, 
including data integrity verified by 
chart review. We conducted ongoing 
measurement through 11 PDSA 
cycles. We included infants inborn 
at a tertiary care center and those 
transferred from regional hospitals. 
We benefitted from a highly engaged 
multidisciplinary team over 3 years 
and strong support from neonatology 
and hospital leadership. Despite the 
elimination of a NICU stay, we had 
no adverse events. Our geographic 
location as the only tertiary care 
center in an 80-mile radius permitted 
reliance on readmission data as a 
sound balancing measure, and we 
verified no increase in outpatient 
morbidity by tracking patients 
through primary care review. 
Systemic cost-of-care analysis is 
another strength. Although other 
studies have described cost data, 
no previous NAS QI project has 
demonstrated cost improvements 
(our changes more than halved 
hospital costs).
We based many of our interventions 
on data gleaned from family 
interviews.19 Our approach to 
physician score interpretation was 
innovative and focused on increased 
attention to NAS symptoms most 
detrimental to infants and most 
concerning for parents while limiting 
the weight of items less likely to 
effect outcomes (Table 2). We began 
the change in score interpretation in 
the fall of intervention year 1, after 
nurse score training transiently led 
to a higher proportion of infants 
being treated (Figs 2 and 3B). The 
physician group identified NAS 
symptoms in the first 36 hours 
as likely due to tobacco and/
or antidepressants and avoided 
initiating a potentially long course 
of opioid treatment until NAS was 
the clear diagnosis. There is a higher 
likelihood of pharmacologic therapy 
for NAS in infants exposed to tobacco 
and antidepressants.23
Most previous NAS QI reports 
have not aimed to reduce the 
proportion of pharmacologically 
treated infants. We achieved a 41% 
relative reduction in the proportion 
of opioid-exposed infants treated 
with medications. Other studies 
that measured proportion of at-risk 
newborns treated pharmacologically 
had similar results with rooming-in; 
55% and 75% relative risk 
reductions compared with standard 
NICU care.9, 
11
Our study corroborates the findings 
of previous studies demonstrating 
reduction in NAS LOS with 
rooming-in.9–11 Most studies of NAS 
LOS are in drug comparison trials in 
which LOS is used to demonstrate 
superiority of one agent over 
another. However, this body of 
literature demonstrates tremendous 
variability; infants treated with morp-
hine may be treated as long as 37 
days or as short as 12 days.9, 
23–25 This 
variation supports the theory that the 
environment of care is likely 
more important than the medication 
used for treatment. Two recent 
multicenter Ohio collaborative 
reports and a single-center study in 
NICUs showed a decreased LOS to 
between 18 and 23 days with use 
of a standardized weaning 
protocol.8, 
26, 
27 Recent US national data 
show average LOS for a pharma-
cologically treated infant is 23 days.3
Limitations include that the project 
occurred in a children’s hospital 
within a hospital. Generalizability 
might be limited to children’s 
hospitals where labor and delivery 
services are colocated. In addition, 
the same 6 pediatricians serve 
as attending physicians in both 
newborn nursery and inpatient 
pediatrics. Group consensus and 
rapid change were relatively easy to 
achieve and might be more difficult 
in larger groups or when separate 
services attend in the 2 settings. Our 
service area is predominantly rural 
and ethnically homogeneous. More 
mothers in our region are maintained 
on buprenorphine as opposed 
to methadone; rates of newborn 
treatment of NAS are similar between 
these groups, but length of treatment 
can be shorter when mothers 
take prescribed buprenorphine.28 
NICUs with individual rooms for 
rooming-in could achieve similarly 
reduced LOS, but comparable cost 
reductions would be unlikely. 
New Hampshire and Vermont do 
not impose mandatory foster care 
placement for opioid-exposed 
newborns, and illicit drug use during 
pregnancy is not criminalized in our 
region, explaining our high rates of

newborns discharged with parents. 
Social acceptability of a rooming-in 
program might meet with opposition 
where legal or child protection 
systems are more punitive.29, 
30
There are some financial downsides 
to this intervention, including 
reduction in hospital revenue in 
fee-for-service environments. NICUs 
frequently drive children’s hospital 
revenue, so reducing admission and 
LOS could financially penalize some 
health systems, although this may 
change under new payment models.31 
The cost savings herein were realized 
by 3 reductions: percent treated 
with morphine, reduced LOS, and 
reduced NICU utilization. This project 
was viable in New Hampshire as 
Medicaid reimbursements provide 
less revenue than actual cost of care. 
Notably, otherwise well newborns 
with NAS do not require critical 
care; they thrive with comforting 
environmental measures. In terms 
of providing high-value care to 
populations, this is a preferable 
approach to quality improvement 
and cost reduction. Cost savings 
from this project benefit the region’s 
population and accrue to Medicaid 
and taxpayers who might otherwise 
be funding unnecessary care.
CONCLUSIONS
We reduced the rate of 
pharmacotherapy for NAS to 27% 
and LOS for treated infants to 12 
days. We reduced system costs by 
more than half by caring for infants 
with prenatal opioid exposure and 
NAS in a rooming-in model, safely 
eliminating the use of critical care 
beds for this condition.
