Summary
Background Brain and cognitive development during the fi
 rst 1000 days from conception are aff
 ected by multiple 
biomedical and socioenvironmental determinants including nutrition, health, nurturing, and stimulation. An 
improved understanding of the long-term infl
 uence of these factors is needed to prioritise public health investments 
to optimise human development.
Methods We did a follow-up study of the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT), 
a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial of maternal supplementation with multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron 
and folic acid (IFA) in Indonesia. Of 27 356 live infants from birth to 3 months of age in 2001–04, we re-enrolled 
19 274 (70%) children at age 9–12 years, and randomly selected 2879 from the 18 230 who were attending school at a 
known location. Of these, 574 children were oversampled from mothers who were anaemic or malnourished at 
SUMMIT enrolment. We assessed the eff
 ects of MMN and associations of biomedical (ie, maternal and child 
anthropometry and haemoglobin and preterm birth) and socioenvironmental determinants (ie, parental education, 
socioeconomic status, home environment, and maternal depression) on general intellectual ability, declarative 
memory, procedural memory, executive function, academic achievement, fi
 ne motor dexterity, and socioemotional 
health. The SUMMIT trial was registered, number ISRCTN34151616.
Findings Children of mothers given MMN had a mean score of 0·11 SD (95% CI 0·01–0·20, p=0·0319) higher in 
procedural memory than those given IFA, equivalent to the increase in scores with half a year of schooling. Children 
of anaemic mothers in the MMN group scored 0·18 SD (0·06–0·31, p=0·0047) higher in general intellectual ability, 
similar to the increase with 1 year of schooling. Overall, 18 of 21 tests showed a positive coeffi
  cient of MMN versus 
IFA (p=0·0431) with eff
 ect sizes from 0·00–0·18 SD. In multiple regression models, socioenvironmental determinants 
had coeffi
  cients of 0·00–0·43 SD and 22 of 35 tests were signifi
 cant at the 95% CI level, whereas biomedical 
coeffi
  cients were 0·00–0·10 SD and eight of 56 tests were signifi
 cant, indicating larger and more consistent impact of 
socioenvironmental factors (p<0·0001).
Interpretation Maternal MMN had long-term benefi
 ts for child cognitive development at 9–12 years of age, thereby 
supporting its role in early childhood development, and policy change toward MMN. The stronger association of 
socioenvironmental determinants with improved cognition suggests present reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and 
child health programmes focused on biomedical determinants might not suffi
  ciently enhance child cognition, and 
that programmes addressing socioenvironmental determinants are essential to achieve thriving populations.

Introduction
Determinants that infl
 uence brain and cognitive 
development during the fi
 rst 1000 days from conception 
to 2 years of age can have long-term eff
 ects on brain 
architecture and cognitive ability.1 Studies in high-
income countries have shown the long-term cognitive 
consequences of early life experiences, such as 
intrauterine growth restriction,2 preterm birth,3 adverse 
events,4 and early educational experiences.5 Children in 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
have a greater burden of risk factors for poor cognitive 
and behavioural development than those in high-
income countries.6 However, few studies in LMICs 
have assessed the association between early life 
experiences and later cognitive, motor, and socio-
emotional ability. Identifi
 cation of the biomedical and 
socioenvironmental determinants that most strongly 
predict cognitive, motor, and socioemotional function 
is needed for strategic design and integration of child 
development programmes with existing reproductive,

maternal, neonatal, and child health (RMNCH) 
programmes.
Maternal micronutrient defi
 ciency during pregnancy is 
one important and preventable risk factor for poor child 
development and is prevalent among women of child-
bearing 
age 
in 
LMICs.7 
Present 
global 
policy8 
recommends iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation 
during pregnancy. However, supplementation with 
additional micronutrients might also be needed, 
particularly for fetal brain development, which occurs 
rapidly during gestation.9 Animal models have shown 
that micronutrients in addition to IFA, such as iodine, 
zinc, and vitamin B6, are necessary for neurodevelopment 
during this period.10 In human beings, associations have 
been found between child development and indicators of 
maternal undernutrition, including anthropometric 
measures and micronutrient defi
 ciencies.11 However, few 
randomised controlled trials of maternal multiple 
micronutrient (MMN) supplementation in LMICs have 
assessed long-term cognitive outcomes.
The Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients 
Intervention Trial (SUMMIT)12 was a double-blind, 
cluster-randomised trial of maternal supplementation 
with MMN or IFA in Lombok, Indonesia from 2001–04, 
which enrolled 31 290 pregnant women who had 
28 426 live births. Infant mortality at 3 months was 
reduced by 18%, fetal loss and neonatal deaths by 11%, 
and an association with a reduction in the proportion of 
low birth weight by 14% was noted in the group receiving 
MMN compared with those who received IFA, with 
greater and signifi
 cant eff
 ects in mothers who were 
anaemic at enrolment (38%, 29%, and 33% reductions, 
respectively).13 In 487 children assessed at age 3·5 years, 
positive eff
 ects of MMN were recorded for cognitive 
ability in children of mothers who had been anaemic or 
undernourished at enrolment.13 The aim of the present 
study was to follow-up SUMMIT children to assess the 
biomedical and socioenvironmental determinants of 
children’s cognition at age 9–12 years.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The long-term eff
 ects of maternal nutrition and the interplay of 
early life biomedical and socioenvironmental determinants on 
child cognition are unclear. A better understanding is needed to 
prioritise public health investments to optimise human 
development. Of the 20 follow-up studies of randomised trials 
comparing maternal supplementation with three or more 
micronutrients to iron and folic acid (IFA), only four assessed 
child motor and cognitive development, and with equivocal 
results. These studies did not typically use a wide range of tests 
for multiple cognitive domains in school age children, nor detail 
the relative contributions of other biomedical and 
socioenvironmental determinants. Such evidence is important 
to inform policy makers of which types of interventions are 
likely to most eff
 ectively support children to achieve their 
developmental potential. We therefore examined citations in 
four systematic reviews of risk factors for poor child 
development in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs). We identifi
 ed 56 studies that enrolled pregnant 
women or infants younger than 2 years in LMICs and later 
assessed cognitive, motor, or socioemotional ability at age 
5 years or older. Only fi
 ve of these analysed biomedical and 
socioenvironmental determinants, and few included two crucial 
socioenvironmental determinants, maternal depression and 
stimulation from the home environment. Additionally, 
four studies assessed only general intellectual ability, while one 
reported on general intellectual ability, numeracy, knowledge, 
and achievement but did not probe specifi
 c cognitive domains. 
One study in Bangladesh included 2853 younger children aged 
5 years, while the other four included less than 350 children 
with limited power to discern eff
 ects. As such, detailed analyses 
and quantifi
 cation of long term eff
 ects of MMN and other early 
life socioenvironmental and biomedical determinants on 
multiple defi
 ned domains in older children has not been 
previously reported.
Added value of this study
Our study is the fi
 rst, to our knowledge, to assess the long term 
eff
 ect of maternal MMN versus IFA on multiple cognitive, 
motor, and socioemotional domains in school-age children, 
and the fi
 rst, to our knowledge, to assess procedural memory. 
It is the only long-term longitudinal study in a LMIC with a 
sample of more than 2000 children to assess the relative 
association of biomedical and socioenvironmental 
determinants, including home environment and maternal 
depression, with multiple domains of child abilities. We report 
signifi
 cant eff
 ects of maternal MMN on procedural memory, on 
general intellectual ability in children of anaemic women, and 
positive shifts overall on cognitive, fi
 ne motor, and 
socioemotional ability. 
Implications of all the available evidence
The benefi
 cial eff
 ects of maternal MMN supplementation on 
birth weight, small for gestational age, and stillbirths in recent 
meta-analyses, and on mortality in SUMMIT, especially in 
anaemic women, tend to support policy change from IFA to 
MMN for maternal supplementation. Our fi
 ndings suggest that 
to achieve thriving populations in multiple domains of children’s 
abilities, current biomedical-centered programmes and 
interventions are not suffi
  cient, and that additional interventions 
addressing socioenvironmental determinants are required.

IFA or MMN. Pregnant women were enrolled at prenatal 
care clinics held by midwives. Women who provided 
written informed consent received a monthly supply of 
MMN or IFA capsules to be taken daily throughout the 
duration of pregnancy and until 3 months post partum. 
SUMMIT research assistants collected data for bio-
medical and socioenvironmental determinants within 
72 h of enrolment. These data included mid-upper arm 
circumference (MUAC) and haemoglobin concentration, 
which were used to classify mothers as undernourished 
or anaemic for selection of the follow-up sample. 
Research assistants collected data for health outcomes 
and community facilitators promoted use of government 
health services and assessed supplement consumption. 
The IFA capsule contained 30 mg iron as ferrous 
fumarate and 400 μg folic acid. The MMN capsule, in 
accordance 
with 
the 
UN 
International 
Multiple 
Micronutrient Preparation (UNIMMAP),14 contained the 
same amounts of IFA, plus 800·0 μg retinol (retinyl 
acetate), 200·0 IU vitamin D (ergocalciferol), 10·0 mg 
vitamin E (alpha tocopherol acetate), 70·0 mg ascorbic 
acid, 1·4 mg vitamin B1 (thiamine mononitrate), 1·4 mg 
vitamin B2 (ribofl
 avin), 18·0 mg niacin (niacinanide), 
1·9 mg vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), 1·6 μg vitamin B12 
(cyanocobalamin), 15·0 mg zinc (zinc gluconate), 2·0 mg 
copper, 65·0 μg selenium and 150·0 μg iodine. The study

Participants
In this follow-up study, the participant sample was the 
31 290 pregnant women enrolled in 2001–04 comprising 
the main cohort for the primary trial outcomes (fi
 gure 1).12 
After exclusions from 31 290 participants (287 [1%] 
dropped out, 397 [1%] moved, six died [<1%], 1064 [3%] 
were lost to follow-up, 597 [2%] had abortions, and 
513 [2%] had stillbirths), 27 356 infants were confi
 rmed 
from 2001–04 to be alive between birth and 12 weeks post 
partum, including 1128 who had been confi
 rmed live 
then lost to follow-up before the 12 week visit, with 
26 228 reported alive at 3 months. The proportion lost to 
follow-up at 3 months post partum was not diff
 erent 
between the IFA and MMN groups. From 2012–14, we 
re-enrolled 19 274 (70%) of the 27 356 infants at 9–12 years 
of age. The follow-up sample included 688 children who 
had been confi
 rmed live between birth and 12 weeks, but 
had been lost to follow-up before the 12 week visit.

0·3 standard deviations for a normally distributed 
outcome (power 90%, α=0·05). Second, we over-sampled 
574 children of mothers who were undernourished 
(MUAC <23·5 cm) and anaemic (haemoglobin <110 g/L) 
at enrolment, to detect the same eff
 ect size in these 
subgroups because MMN positively aff
 ected cognition at 
preschool age in these groups.13 We then added the 
487 children previously randomly selected and tested for 
cognitive development at preschool age,13 and 640 children 
of previously randomly selected mothers whose cognitive 
function had been assessed.15 Finally, we randomly 
selected 282 additional companion children from the re-
enrolment cohort to accompany any child to the testing 
site when only one child was selected at a school. Selection 
of children was done by an automated algorithm prepared 
in SAS (version 9.3). In brief, the algorithm fi
 rst compiled 
the list of all re-enrolled children at a school and selected 
those previously assessed as preschoolers and whose 
mothers had been assessed for cognitive performance. 
The 
algorithm 
then 
randomly 
selected 
children 
proportional to the number of re-enrollees at the school, 
and with proportional oversampling of children whose 
mothers had been either anaemic or undernourished at 
SUMMIT enrolment. Each list was alphabetically sorted 
and parsed to blocks of eight, as this comprised a testing 
batch, and two additional randomly selected re-enrolees 
were added to each block to account for potential absences 
on the day of testing. One list was used for each test 
session per school. We included in the fi
 nal representative 
sample all children except those specifi
 cally selected for 
the maternal anaemia and undernutrition subgroups. We 
obtained cognitive data from 2879 children: 2305 in the 
representative sample, 305 additional children of anaemic 
mothers, and 269 additional children of undernourished 
mothers 
(appendix). 
The 
sample 
sizes 
provided 
90% power to detect a diff
 erence of SD 0·16 in the 
representative sample and SD 0·22 in the children of 
undernourished and anaemic mothers for normally 
distributed outcomes. All SUMMIT scientists and 
personnel, government staff
 , and participants in the 
original study, and all participants and all data collectors 
in the follow-up study were unaware of the allocation of 
MMN and IFA. 
Procedures
We assessed nurturing and stimulation from the 
environment using a locally adapted version of the Home 
Observation for the Measurement of the Environment 
(HOME) Inventory,16 and maternal depression with the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies depression test.17 The 
properties of these tests after adaptation are in the appendix.
Seven teams of eight people administered the cognition 
and motor tests at local schools where temporary facilities 
were set up consisting of eight stations. At two stations 
medical information was collected (eg, anthropometry 
and blood pressure). At six stations, one data collector 
administered 2–3 cognitive tests. Targeted children were 
called from their classrooms in the morning. The average 
duration of testing at each station was 15 min. A separate 
team of assessors visited the homes of participants to 
administer the HOME inventory and assess maternal 
depression and child socioemotional development. 
These visits were completed for 2728 (95%) of the 
2879 children in the full cognitive sample.
All assessors had 3 year or 4 year post-secondary degrees. 
They were trained and required to be certifi
 ed by passing 
written and practical certifi
 cation exams for three positions: 
administration of tests at schools, implementation of 
home visits, and reviewing of forms and audio recordings. 
All verbal tests and interviews were audio recorded and 
reviewed for quality control as described in the appendix.
Outcomes
We selected a set of tests specifi
 cally designed to assess 
brain functions likely to be sensitive to nutritional 
infl
 uences, and important for school success and daily life. 
These tests were adapted to the local setting in Lombok by 
a panel consisting of international and local research 
scientists, local psychologists, and local teachers. In an 
iterative process, the panel’s decisions were informed by 
formative interviews and focus groups with parents of 
school-age children, and a series of 12 pilot tests of 
216 children aged 8–12 years (table 1; appendix). Adapted 
tests were evaluated for inter-rater agreement, test-retest 
reliability, internal reliability, and convergent validity 
(appendix). The inter-rater agreement ranged from 88% to 
100%, test-retest reliability from r=0·30 to r=0·90, and 
internal reliability from Cronbach’s alpha=0·65–0·87
. 
The fi
 rst objective was to follow up school-age children 
(9–12 years) whose mothers had participated in SUMMIT, 
and assess the long-term eff
 ect of maternal MMN 
supplementation on child motor, cognitive, and socio-
emotional development. The second was to assess, in the 
same 
context, 
the 
eff
 ect 
of 
biomedical 
and 
socioenvironmental determinants on these outcomes. 
Statistical analyses
All analyses were prespecifi
 ed and done with SAS 
(version 9.4). We examined whether children whose 
mothers received MMN or IFA were similar on key baseline 
characteristics for continuous variables by mixed eff
 ects 
linear regression models with a random eff
 ect of midwife 
on the intercept and for categorical variables by generalised 
linear models with midwife as a repeated measure.
All cognitive, motor, and socioemotional scores for 
which a lower score indicated better performance 
(eg picture naming speed) were reversed, thereby 
facilitating interpretation with positive coeffi
  cients 
indicating better performance in the MMN group 
(table 1). We log-transformed the following scores to 
reduce skewness from more than 1 to less than 1: speeded 
picture naming, visual search, visual search dual task, 
and Stroop test. For each continuous score, we calculated 
z scores by child sex and by 6 month age bands, because

e221
both age and sex were strongly associated with most test 
scores. We excluded extreme outliers of more than 5 SD 
from the mean (0·05% of scores).
We calculated the average z score for each child in each 
of the seven domains listed in table 1: general intellectual 
ability (information, picture naming speed, and block 
design scores); declarative memory (list memory recall 
trial 1, recall trial 2, and recognition trial); procedural 
memory (serial reaction time score); executive function 
(visual search, visual search dual task, digit span forward 
and backward, Stroop numbers, and Dimensional 
Change Card Sort scores); academic achievement 
Test
Description
General intellectual ability
Verbal ability: general 
knowledge
Information test
Children were required to verbally answer general knowledge questions, such as “How many days are in a week?” The score was the number 
of questions answered correctly.
Verbal ability: semantic 
memory and lexical 
retrieval
Speeded picture 
naming test
Children were instructed to point to and say out loud the name of each picture on a page as quickly and accurately as possible. The score was 
calculated as the time to complete the page divided by the number of pictures correctly named.
Non-verbal ability: 
spatial pattern copying
Block design test
Children were asked to copy increasingly complex patterns with coloured blocks. The score takes into account both accuracy and speed.
Declarative memory
Declarative memory
Adapted Rey auditory 
verbal learning test
Children were given three learning trials in which they were asked to remember a list of 11 unrelated words presented orally. This test was 
followed by an interference trial requiring the immediate recall of a second 11 word list, and then a request to recall the fi
 rst list (recall trial 
1). After a delay of mean 7 min, participants were again asked to recall the initial list (recall trial 2), and then given a recognition test.
Procedural memory
Procedural memory
Serial reaction time task
Children did the task with a video game pad controller and a laptop. Children were required to press the button on the game pad that 
corresponded to the position on the screen in which a smiley face appeared. A random block (of 60 items) was followed by four blocks that 
presented a standard ten-item sequence, followed by a fi
 nal random block. The procedural learning score was the diff
 erence between the 
mean standardised reaction time on the fi
 nal random block and the fourth sequence block.18,19
Executive function
Visual attention
Adapted visual search 
task
Based on the Sky Search subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh), a local illustrator drew a series of pairs of 
pictures, some of which were the same and some of which were diff
 erent. Children were asked to underline all pairs that were the same as 
fast as possible. The score was the time per correct target on the visual search task minus the time per correct target on a motor control task.
Sustained attention
Adapted visual search 
dual task
Based on the Sky Search Dual Task subtest from the TEACh, children were asked to complete a parallel version of the visual search task 
described above, which diff
 ers only in the location of the targets. As they did the visual search task, they were asked to simultaneously and 
silently count the number of tones presented in each item of a tone counting task. The score takes into account performance on both tasks.
Auditory attention and 
working memory
Digit span forward and 
backward
The digit span forward and backward scores were calculated as the total number of sequences of digits, correctly repeated (digit span 
forward) or repeated in reverse order (digit span backward), before an error was committed on two consecutive trials of the same length.
Cognitive control
Stroop numbers
Children were presented with four conditions, each consisting of 20 items. The fi
 rst and last were baseline conditions, consisting of zeros 
(000), where children were required to name the quantity of zeros in each item (three, four, fi
 ve, or six). The second was a congruent 
condition where the quantity corresponded to the printed number (eg, 333). The third was an incongruent condition where the quantity 
and the printed number did not correspond (eg, 222). Again, the task was to name the quantity, not the printed number. The total time to 
correctly name all of the items in each condition was recorded. The interference score was calculated as the time to complete the 
incongruent condition minus the time to complete the congruent condition.
Cognitive fl
 exibility
NIH Toolbox 
Dimensional Change 
Card Sort Test
We used the ePrime version. Children were shown pictures on a tablet screen, which diff
 ered on two characteristics: shape (a truck or a ball) 
and colour (blue or yellow). In each trial, children were instructed to match the picture at the top of the screen to the picture on the right or 
the left according to the verbal computerised instructions (shape or colour). We calculated the score according to the standard National 
Institute of Health Toolbox method.
Educational attainment
Literacy
Literacy test
Children were given a letter discrimination task, a word discrimination task, and a sentence discrimination task. They were instructed to 
mark real letters, real words, and sentences that were answered “yes” (Do birds have wings?) but not those answered “no” (Do cars have 
feet?) The score was the sum of the hits (correctly marked) minus false alarms (incorrectly marked) with additional points given for faster 
performance on the sentence task.
Arithmetic
Arithmetic test
Children were verbally asked arithmetic questions and required to answer without doing written calculations. We developed a set of items 
from elementary school arithmetic text books. The score was the total number correct.
Fine motor
Motor dexterity
Purdue pegboard test
We recorded the number of pegs children were able to place in a board in 30 s, fi
 rst with the right hand, then with the left hand, and then 
with both hands simultaneously. The pegboard average score was the average of these three trials. In the assembly trial, the child was 
required to assemble a peg, a washer, and a collar, and another washer in each hole on the board. The pegboard assembly score was the 
number of pieces correctly assembled.
Socioemotional

Adapted Child Behavior 
Checklist
We developed a 50 question interview representing seven subscales of the checklist: depression, social problems, thought problems, 
attention problems, delinquent behaviour, aggressive behaviour, and other problems. The total score was the sum of the item scores.

(literacy and arithmetic scores); motor ability (pegboard 
average and assembly score); and socioemotional ability 
(adapted child behaviour checklist score). All domain 
scores were normally distributed.
The eff
 ect of MMN on each domain score was identifi
 ed 
by mixed eff
 ects models with a fi
 xed eff
 ect of supplement 
group and a random eff
 ect of midwife. If one assessor 
administered all tests in any domain, we also included a 
random eff
 ect of assessor. Each model was estimated fi
 rst 
with the supplement group as the only fi
 xed eff
 ect 
(model 1), second, with fi
 xed eff
 ects of the supplement 
group and six baseline covariates from SUMMIT (model 2), 
and third, model 2 plus six covariates that were outcomes 
of SUMMIT (model 3). The six baseline covariates were 
maternal and paternal education, maternal MUAC, 
haemoglobin, and height, and wealth index. The outcome 
covariates from SUMMIT were preterm birth (<37 weeks 
gestation), small for gestational age calculated based on 
Oken and colleagues,20 and four variables collected at the 
follow-up at 9–12 years of age: postnatal growth, which was 
calculated as the residual of small for gestational age 
predicting height-for-age z score (HAZ) at 9–12 years (with 
HAZ calculated based on WHO norms21), child 
haemoglobin, HOME inventory score, and maternal 
depression score. As described above, child age and sex 
were already accommodated in the calculation of z scores. 
The appendix shows the percent of data absent for each 
covariate, which ranged from 0% to 17%. Baseline maternal 
haemoglobin during SUMMIT had been intentionally 
collected in a subgroup of representative women, thus 
37% of selected children did not have this covariate. To 
avoid dropping participants from adjusted analyses due to 
missing covariates, we used multiple imputation as 
described in the appendix.22 We also estimated model 3 
using complete case analysis, for comparison.
We estimated each model fi
 rst for the randomly selected 
representative sample of all children (n=2305), second, for 
children of undernourished mothers (n=1076), and third, 
for children of anaemic mothers (n=1009), both subgroups 
including those in the representative sample as well as 
those over-sampled for these characteristics. We used 
Fisher’s exact test to assess whether the proportion of 
positive coeffi
  cients due to MMN was diff
 erent from 
chance, and to assess whether the proportion of signifi
 cant 
coeffi
  cients was diff
 erent between the biomedical and 
socioenvironmental groups of determinants.
Role of the funding source

Results
In the full cognitive follow-up sample (n=2879), children 
whose mothers had received IFA or MMN did not diff
 er 
signifi
 cantly in any characteristic (table 2). Likewise, in 
the randomly selected overall representative sample 
(n=2305), no signifi
 cant diff
 erences were found between 
groups. The characteristics of the representative sample 
were similar to the characteristics of the 31 290 participants 
in the main cohort (table 2).
Of the 2631 children from whom data was obtained on 
the serial reaction time task, 198 (8%) did not pass the 
practice items, therefore the test items were not 
administered. An additional 374 children (14%) scored less 
than 80% accuracy on the test items, and were also 
excluded from analysis of this task in accordance with 
previous studies.18,19 The proportion of children excluded 
did not diff
 er between IFA (21%) and MMN (22%; p=0·49).
The estimates of the intention-to-treat eff
 ect of the 
intervention on each domain score adjusted for cluster 
randomisation and assessor (model 1) are shown in 
table 3. In the representative sample, children in the 
MMN group scored signifi
 cantly higher than children in 
the IFA group in procedural memory (B=0·11 [95% CI 
0·01–0·20], p=0·0319). In children of anaemic mothers, 
the MMN group scored signifi
 cantly higher in general 
intellectual ability (B=0·18 [95% CI 0·06–0·31] where B 
is the unstandardised estimate of the regression 
coeffi
  cient, representing the change in z score of the 
outcome associated with a one-unit change in the 
independent variable, p=0·0047). In children of 
undernourished mothers, no signifi
 cant eff
 ects of MMN 
were noted for any domain score. Overall, 18 of 
21 estimates were positive, indicating the MMN group 
scored consistently higher than the IFA group; this was 
signifi
 cantly greater than chance (p=0·0431). 
When adjusting for baseline covariates (model 2; 
appendix), the same pattern was found in all three 
samples of children as in the model 1 intention-to-treat 
analysis, that is, signifi
 cant eff
 ects of maternal MMN 
supplementation 
on 
procedural 
memory 
in 
the 
representative sample (B=0·10, 95% CI 0·00–0·20, 
p=0·0464) and on general intellectual ability in children 
of anaemic mothers (B=0·18, 95% CI 0·06–0·29, 
p=0·0034). When adjusting for additional covariates 
collected after enrolment (model 3), the same pattern 
was found. The estimates adjusting for all covariates 
(model 3) are shown in fi
 gure 2 and in the appendix.
The regression coeffi
  cients for all variables in model 3 
are shown in table 4 for the representative sample 
of children. The socioenvironmental determinants 
(socioeconomic status, maternal and paternal education, 
HOME score, and maternal depression) showed stronger 
and more consistent associations with school-age 
cognitive, motor, and socioemotional scores, as compared 
with the biomedical determinants. For the socio-
environmental determinants, coeffi
  cients ranged from 
0·00–0·43, and 22 (63%) of 35 coeffi
  cients were 
signifi
 cant. For the biomedical determinants, coeffi
  cients 
ranged from 0·00–0·10 and eight (14%) of 56 coeffi
  cients 
were signifi
 cant, the diff
 erence in these proportions was 
signifi
 cant (p<0·0001).

Children whose mothers received MMN supplements 
during pregnancy and post partum scored higher in 
procedural memory, maternal MUAC during pregnancy 
was signifi
 cantly positively associated with executive 
function, and maternal height was positively associated 
with declarative memory and fi
 ne motor dexterity 
(table 4). Maternal haemoglobin during pregnancy, 
preterm birth, and small for gestational age were not 
signifi
 cantly associated with any score. Child haemoglobin 
at cognitive testing was signifi
 cantly associated with fi
 ne 
motor dexterity (table 4). Post natal growth in height 
(the standardised residual of small for gestation age 
predicting HAZ at follow-up) was signifi
 cantly associated 
with three scores: general intellectual ability, academic 
achievement, and fi
 ne motor dexterity (table 4). By 
contrast, each of the socioenvironmental determinants 
was associated with three to fi
 ve outcome scores (table 4). 
Children in low socioeconomic status households scored 
lower in general intellectual ability, declarative memory,

paternal education were signifi
 cantly associated with 
general intellectual ability, executive function, and 
academic achievement, while maternal education was 
also associated with declarative memory and fi
 ne motor 
dexterity (table 4). HOME inventory score was signifi
 cantly 
associated with general intellectual ability, declarative 
memory, executive function, academic achievement, and 
fi
 ne motor dexterity (table 4). Maternal depression was 
strongly associated with child socioemotional develop-
ment, and was the only signifi
 cant predictor of this score. 
Maternal depression was also associated with general 
intellectual ability, declarative memory, and executive 
function.
In the fully adjusted models (model 3) with complete 
case analysis, rather than multiple imputation, the 
coeffi
  cients for all independent variables were similar to 
the coeffi
  cients with multiple imputation. The median 
diff
 erence between each pair of coeffi
  cients in 
the imputed versus non-imputed models was 0·03 
(IQR 0·02–0·05).
Figure 3 shows the coeffi
  cient size of each risk factor 
on each cognitive, motor, and socioemotional score, 
with all continuous variables dichotomised so that 
eff
 ect sizes can be compared across risk factors. The 
results were similar to the results of the models with 
continuous variables, with the socioenvironmental risk 
factors 
showing 
stronger 
and 
more 
consistent 
associations with the domain scores than the biomedical 
factors.
Discussion
We examined three groups of children: a randomly 
selected representative sample, and samples from 
undernourished 
and 
anaemic 
mothers. 
In 
the 
representative sample, children in the MMN group 
scored mean 0·11 SD higher than the IFA group in 
procedural memory. Children of anaemic mothers in the 
MMN group scored 0·18 SD higher in general intellectual 
ability. Although these were the only two signifi
 cant eff
 ects 
of MMN, overall, 18 of 21 estimates (seven cognitive, 
motor, and socioemotional scores for three groups of 
children) were positive, indicating that the MMN group 
scored consistently higher than the IFA group. These 
non-signifi
 cant positive eff
 ect sizes, ranging from 0·00 to 
0·13 SD, were smaller than the study was powered 
to detect (0·16 SD in the representative sample 
and 0·22 SD in the children of undernourished and 
anaemic mothers). However, the proportion of positive 
coeffi
  cients, indicating higher scores in the MMN group, 
was signifi
 cantly greater than chance.

In our sample, from school year grade 2 through to 
grade 5, cognitive scores increased on average by 
0·21 SD per academic year. Thus, the eff
 ect size of 
0·11 SD on procedural memory was equivalent to the 
increase in scores with about half a year of school, while 
the eff
 ect size of 0·18 SD on general intellectual ability in 
children of anaemic mothers was equivalent to the 
increase in scores with almost a full year of school. 
Therefore, while these eff
 ect sizes are small based on 
Cohen’s classifi
 cation,23 they represent a substantial and 
meaningful develop 
men 
tal advance for children whose 
mothers received MMN, suggesting that provision of 
MMN during pregnancy is an eff
 ective way to pursue the 
UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 4·2 to “ensure that 
all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood 
development so that they are ready for primary education.” 
In multiple regression models, socioenvironmental 
determin 
ants (eg, HOME score and maternal depression) 
showed stronger and more consistent signifi
 c 
ant 
associations with school-age cognitive, motor, and socio-
emotional 
scores, 
as 
compared 
with 
biomedical 
determinants (eg, maternal nutritional status and 
preterm birth). Socioenvironmental coeffi
  cients ranged 
from 0·00–0·43 SD, equivalent to the increase in scores 
with up to two years of school, while biomedical 
coeffi
  cients ranged from 0·00–0·10 SD, equivalent to up 
to a half a year of school. This fi
 nding suggests that 
present RMNCH programmes that are focused on 
biomedical determinants might not suffi
  ciently enhance 
child cognition, and that programmes addressing 
socioenvironmental determinants are essential to achieve 
thriving populations.

This longitudinal study is the fi
 rst, to our knowledge, 
from pregnancy through to school age in a LMIC that 
assessed a large number of children on a comprehensive 
battery of cognitive, motor, and socioemotional tests and 
that examined stimulation from the home environment 
and maternal depression together with other socio-
environmental 
and 
biomedical 
factors 
measured 
perinatally. Strengths of the study were the double-blind, 
randomised design, the large number of children followed 
up, the assessment of multiple specifi
 c cognitive abilities, 
the high quality implementation of cognitive assessments, 
and adaptation and evaluation of assessments in the local 
context. One weakness was that only children attending 
school were selected for cognitive assessment. However, 
18 230 (95%) of the 19 274 children in the full follow-up 
sample were attending school at the time of re-enrolment. 
Another challenge was that cognitive assessments were 
done in schools during regular school hours instead of in 
specialised testing rooms, which was not an optimum 
testing environment. However, any noise introduced due 
to this factor would tend to mask diff
 erences between 
MMN and IFA, and yet eff
 ects were indeed detected. A 
third challenge was heterogeneity between assessors. 
Despite high inter-rater agreement, signifi
 cant associations 
were found between the assessor who administered the 
test and its score, with the exception of the computerised 
tests (dimensional change card sort and serial reaction 
time). We mitigated this by controlling for assessor in the 
analyses of the eff
 ect of MMN. 
At least 16 randomised trials have compared maternal 
supplementation with UNIMMAP to IFA,14 showing 
positive eff
 ects of MMN on birth weight and small for 
gestational age,24–26 and still births,27 with the most recent 
meta-analyses including two additional large-scale trials 
allaying earlier concerns of adverse eff
 ects. However, 
eff
 ects on long-term cognitive ability remain equivocal or 
unknown. In our study, the specifi
 c positive eff
 ects, 
together with those mentioned above,27 would support 
policy change from IFA to MMN. The fi
 nding that 
children of anaemic mothers showed positive eff
 ects of 
MMN on general intellectual ability is consistent with 
greater eff
 ects on preschool cognition13 and infant 
mortality that have been found in this group.12 This 
suggests that mothers who are anaemic during 
pregnancy have greater potential to benefi
 t from 
supplementation with MMN than those who are not 
anaemic, perhaps because anaemia might be associated 
with diet and other factors causing MMN defi
 ciency. 
In four previous follow-up studies of MMN versus IFA 
assessing developmental outcomes, and in 56 previous 
longitudinal studies in LMICs assessing cognition at 
school age, no study examined procedural memory. Our 
positive fi
 ndings suggest that this cognitive ability should 
be included in future studies. The procedural memory 
system underlies learning of new, and processing of 
established, perceptual, motor, and cognitive skills. 
Procedural memory might subserve a wide range of 
skilled activities that children and adults do automatically 
and are important for academic performance and daily 
life, such as driving, typing, arithmetic, reading, 
speaking, and understanding language, and learning 
sequences, rules, and categories.28,29 The basal ganglia, 
including the caudate nucleus and the putamen (the 
dorsal striatum), together with connected areas of the 
frontal cortex are critical brain structures in procedural 
memory.28,30 Dopamine has an important role in this

system, perhaps in skill consoli 
dation.31 The observed 
eff
 ect of MMN on procedural memory might be due to 
altered dopamine metabolism, because animal models of 
maternal defi
 ciency in specifi
 c micronutrients, including 
iron and vitamin B6, have shown altered dopamine 
metabolism and impaired dopamine-related behaviours 
in the off
 spring.32,33 
Meta-analyses of micronutrient interventions in 
school-age children34 and nutrition interventions in 
infants younger than 2 years in LMICs,35 have found 
pooled eff
 ects of about 0·1 SD. This result is consistent 
with the eff
 ect sizes that we reported of 0·11 SD on 
procedural memory in the representative sample and 
0·18 SD on general intellectual ability in children of 
anaemic mothers. However, these eff
 ects are smaller 
than the eff
 ects of MMN that we noted for preschool 
cognition in children of undernourished and anaemic 
mothers, which were about 0·3–0·4 SD.13 These fi
 ndings 
are consistent with previous reports of diminishing 
eff
 ects of early childhood education programmes 
throughout 
childhood 
and 
adolescence,36 
and 
underscores the need for early and ongoing intervention 
to promote sustainable gains and mitigate loss of 
investments in early childhood development. In this 
context, the persistent and discernible eff
 ects of maternal 
MMN supplementation are remarkable.10 Ongoing 
intervention is in line with the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals 4 and 5 to ensure inclusive and 
equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
learning opportunities for all and to achieve gender 
equality and empower all women and girls.
The signifi
 cant long-term eff
 ect of maternal MMN 
supplementation and the signifi
 cant association with 
other early life biomedical risk factors, suggest that to 
achieve thriving populations, coverage of existing 
RMNCH interventions to reduce these biomedical 
risks needs to be improved. However, even with 
improved coverage, additional interventions addressing 
socioenvironmental risk factors are essential. The larger 
and more consistent eff
 ects of socioenvironmental 
determinants on all domain scores suggests that 
correction of all maternal and child biomedical conditions 
would not fully optimise cognitive development 
without additionally addressing socio 
environmental 
determinants. 
Interventions 
designed 
to 
enhance 
psychosocial nurturing and stimulation have generally 
resulted in larger eff
 ects on child development than those 
found in nutrition interventions, with meta-analyses of 
studies in LMICs reporting pooled eff
 ect sizes of SD 0·42 
in children younger than 2 years,35 and SD 0·31 in 
children aged 3–5 years.37 Our fi
 ndings indicate that 
investments focused on implementing interventions at 
scale to address socioenvironmental determinants are 
needed, including those to reduce maternal depression 
and improve educational levels of both girls and boys. 
This advancement would have a substantial trans-
formational impact on the next generation.
