Abstract
Purpose: On the basis of preclinical data suggesting that the
class I selective HDAC inhibitor entinostat exerts a synergistic
antitumor effect in combination with high-dose IL2 in a renal cell
carcinoma model by downregulating Foxp3 expression and func-
tion of regulatory T cells (Treg), we conducted a phase I/II clinical
study with entinostat and high-dose IL2 in patients with meta-
static clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Experimental Design: Clear cell histology, no prior treatments,
and being sufficiently fit to receive high-dose IL2 were the main
eligibility criteria. The phase I portion consisted of two dose levels
of entinostat (3 and 5 mg, orally every 14 days) and a fixed
standard dose of IL2 (600,000 U/kg i.v.). Each cycle was 85 days.
The primary endpoint was objective response rate and toxicity.
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and over-
all survival.
Results: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. At a median fol-
low-up of 21.9 months, the objective response rate was 37% [95%
confidence interval (CI), 22%–53%], the median progression-free
survival was 13.8 months (95% CI, 6.0–18.8), and the median
overall survival was 65.3 months (95% CI, 52.6.-65.3). The most
common grade 3/4 toxicities were hypophosphatemia (16%),
lymphopenia (15%), and hypocalcemia (7%), and all were
transient. Decreased Tregs were observed following treatment
with entinostat, and lower numbers were associated with
response (P ¼ 0.03).
Conclusions: This trial suggests a promising clinical activity for

Introduction
Thetreatmentofmetastaticclearcellrenalcellcarcinoma(ccRCC)
is rapidly evolving (1, 2). The use of cytokine therapies such as
IL2 and IFNa has been progressively replaced by vascular growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKI) such as sunitinib
and pazopanib, in the first-line setting. More recently, the approval
of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab has introduced
the use of this novel class of immunotherapy in previously
treated RCC patients (3). However, there remains a critical need
for improving the current standard treatments for RCC.
High-dose IL2 was approved for the treatment of RCC based on
the response rate and duration of responses. A total of 255
patients treated in 7 clinical trials at 21 institutions showed an
objective response rate (ORR) of 15% (4). The recent SELECT trial
(120 patients) has reported a 25% ORR by WHO criteria, a
median duration of response of 20 months, and a median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.2 months (5). This falls in
a similar range with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy
in RCC, and until durability of checkpoint inhibitor therapy can
be determined, supports a continued role for high dose IL2 (3).
Increasing the magnitude of benefit of IL2 therapy remains an
important clinical goal.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a class of drugs
targeting different enzymes that regulate the chromatin structure
and the acetylation of lysine residues on the histone tails (6).
Different classes of HDAC have been identified, but drug devel-
opment in oncology has focused on class I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8)
and class II (HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10). Four HDAC inhibitors,
one selective class I (romidepsin) and three class I/II (vorinostat,
panobinostat, and belinostat) inhibitors, have been approved for
the treatment of cutaneous/peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and
multiple myeloma. Our group has recently reported the activity

 of vorinostat in combination with bevacizumab in previously
treated ccRCC patients (7). Entinostat is a class 1 selective oral
HDAC inhibitor with antitumor activity in several preclinical
models (8). This agent is currently in clinical development for
breast cancer and other solid tumors in combination therapies
(9–12). Its long 140-hour half-life allows continuous exposure
with either once-weekly or biweekly oral dosing.
There is increasing evidence that epigenetic modulation may
have immunostimulatory activity in addition to a direct antitu-
mor effect. Our group reported that the combination of high-dose
IL2 and entinostat had a synergistic antitumor effect in an immu-
nocompetent murine model of RCC (13). The biological effect
induced by low-dose entinostat was associated with reduction of
Foxp3 expression in Tregs and impairment of their immunosup-
pressive function without affecting T effector cells (14). Thus,
based on reported clinical evidence that lower Treg numbers in the
peripheral blood are associated with better outcomes in patients
receiving high-dose IL2 (15, 16), we generated the hypothesis that
the inhibitory effect of the selective class I HDAC inhibitor
entinostat on Tregs may increase the response rate and PFS in
patients receiving high-dose IL2 (Fig. 1A; refs. 17, 18).

Translational Relevance
On the basis of preclinical data suggesting an immuno-
modulatory activity of the selective class I HDAC inhibitor
entinostat and antitumor activity when combined with IL2 in
an animal model of renal cell cancer, we conducted this
clinical trial. Our results suggest that rationally designed
combination strategies aimed to increase the efficacy of
high-dose IL2 therapy are clinically relevant, in a selected
patient population of ccRCC. This proof of principle also
provides the rationale for exploration of epigenetic modula-
tors and immunotherapies as rational combination strategies.

 diagnosis of RCC, clear cell, or predominantly clear cell that was
metastatic and progressive. The patients were required to be
sufficiently fit to receive high-dose IL2. Main exclusion criteria
included any prior systemic therapy for metastatic ccRCC, ongo-
ing immunosuppressive therapy, and the presence of untreated
brain metastases. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT01038778. All patients provided written informed
consent.
Endpoints
The primary objective of the phase I portion of this study was to
evaluate the safety and establish the recommended phase II dose
of entinostat in combination with high-dose IL2. The primary
objective of the phase II portion was to evaluate the efficacy of this
regimen. The primary endpoint was ORR. Secondary endpoints
included PFS and overall survival (OS), and parameters measur-
ing immune response.
Treatment schema
Patients were admitted to hospital units with appropriate
capabilities for the administration of high-dose IL2. One cycle
of treatment (85 days) consisted of 2 courses of high-dose IL2
600,000 U/kg administered intravenously every 8 hours on day 1
to 5 and day 15 to 19 (�7 days; maximum 28 doses; ref. 4), and
entinostat orally (1–2 hours prior to IL2 infusion) given once
every 2 weeks starting on day 14, administered before IL2 infusion
on day 1, 15, and then continuously (Fig. 1B). Entinostat was
provided by CTEP through a CRADA with Syndax Pharmaceu-
ticals, Inc. Tumor response assessments were performed on week
11 (�7 days) and every 12 weeks thereafter. In the event of clinical
benefit (stable disease or tumor shrinkage), patients received a
second cycle of therapy. Entinostat treatment continued every 2
weeks (�7 days dependent on adjustments necessary for IL2
dosing) until documented disease progression or 8 weeks follow-
ing documented complete response. Patients who tolerated the
combination regimen with evidence of tumor shrinkage received
up to 3 cycles of high dose IL2. Cycle 2 started on or within 2 weeks
following day 85 (or last day of cycle dependent on dosing
adjustment) as in cycle 1, while cycle 3 started within 2 weeks
after completion of cycle 2. Tumor response assessment was
performed uniformly across all patients at all institution before
cycle 2 (�day 85). Patients with stable disease by RECIST V.1.1
criteria, but without evidence of tumor shrinkage after two cycles,
received only entinostat until disease progression was documen-
ted. To assess the effect of entinostat versus the combination on
proposed correlative pharmacodynamic parameters, initial treat-
ment was with entinostat monotherapy, followed by combina-
tion with high-dose IL2. The phase I starting dose level of
entinostat was 3 mg orally every 2 weeks. The first dose level had
a minimum of 3 patients treated unless the first 2 patients
experienced dose-limiting toxicity(s) (DLT) before the third
patient was enrolled. DLTs were defined as extended grade 4
toxicity (duration of one week or more) during the first 45 days of
treatment in view of the prolonged side effects induced by single-
agent high-dose IL2. Patients were allowed to remain on the
therapy provided that they were tolerating the treatment and
were progression free. No dose deescalation for IL2 was allowed.
Correlative studies
Relationships between entinostat and IL2 exposure and phar-
macodynamic effects were characterized. Four aliquots of 8 mL of
peripheral blood were collected for mononuclear cell fraction.
Fresh samples were shipped overnight to Roswell Park Cancer
Institute, where they were processed and analyzed by the FACS
Core facility. For activated antigen-presenting cells (APC), we
used the following antibodies (BD): CD86 BB515, CD14 PE, Lin
Dump FL3 PC5, HLADr PECy7, CD11c APC, CD45 APCH7,
CD80 BV421,and CD123 BV510. For Tregs, we usedthe following
antibodies (BD Biosciences): FOXP3 PE, CD4 PcP, CD3PC7,
CD127 APC, CD45 APCH7, and CD25 BV421. Expression of
surface makers and intracellular protein was assessed with FAC-
SAria or LSRII flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using Winlets
software. Pre and post-treatment biopsy of accessible tumors was
offered to all participating patients but was not mandatory.
Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of tumor biopsies were stained
for FOXP3 (clone 236A/E7, Abcam; catalog #ab20034) and CD8
staining (clone C8/144B, Dako; catalog# M7103). [18F]fluoro-2-
deoxy-D-glucose(FDG)-PET/CT scan was performed at screening
and approximately 30 days into therapy, providing nearly simul-
taneous acquisition of metabolic and anatomic data. FDG PET/CT
studies were conducted in 22 patients who were enrolled at
Roswell Park and Johns Hopkins but only 11 patients completed
the second scan.
Statistical analysis
The reported analyses are based on a September 2, 2016,
database lock. The combination treatment would have been
considered unsuccessful if the response rate was 20% or less, and
it would have been considered active enough to pursue further if
the response rate was 40% or greater. To test this hypothesis, the
fixed sample size for a single-stage study with a type I error of 10%
and a type II error of 10%, based on an exact binomial test, was 36.
If11ormoreofthepatientsexperienceda response, thehypothesis
that the response rate was �20% would be rejected with a target
error rate of 0.10. We also planned to determine whether initial
levels of specific T lymphocytes (Treg) in the peripheral blood and
tumor or changes in the level of specific T lymphocytes from
baseline mightpredictforresponsetothiscombinationtherapy.In
this study, Tregs were defined as CD4þCD25hi T cells. The hypoth-
esis was that low baseline levels of Tregs would be associated with
an increased probability of response and that Treg decreases from
baseline would be associated with an increased probability of
response. Responders and nonresponders were compared using
exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Responders were compared with
nonresponders for 5 outcomes: C1D-14, C1D-7, C1D1, C1D-14 –
C1D1 (i.e., change from C1D-14 to C1D1), C1D-7 – C1D1 (i.e.,
change from C1D-7 to C1D1). As this was an exploratory analysis,
no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.
Results
Patient characteristics
Between January 2009 and December 2015, we enrolled 47
patients with ccRCC. All patients had prior nephrectomy and had
either favorable or intermediate MSKCC risk factors (Table 1).
Treatment administration and overall safety
The phase I portion consisted of two dose levels of entinostat (3
and 5 mg) and a fixed standard dose of IL2 (600,000 U/kg every 8
hours) and was enrolled according to a 3 þ 3 design. Eleven
patients were treated during the phase I portion (3 patients at the 3
mg entinostat dose and 8 patients at the 5 mg entinostat dose).

 The 5 mg dose level allowed up to 6 evaluable patients to be
enrolled and 2 patients were not evaluable. Dose levels 1 and 2
were completed without DLTs during the first 45 days of treat-
ment. The most common expected grade 3/4 toxicities were
hypophosphatemia (attributable to entinostat) and thrombocy-
topenia (6 patients), as well as neutropenia and lymphopenia
(2 patients; attributable to both entinostat and IL2). Table 2
shows the adverse events occurring during the combined phase
I and phase II portion. Among all 47 patients, the most common
grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypopho-
sphatemia (16%), decreased lymphocytes (15%), and hypocal-
cemia (7%). No unexpected toxicities were noted. One patient
presented a rheumatoid arthritis flare. One death was reported
during treatment and was deemed unrelated to study drug. The
patient developed cardiac tamponade during the first cycle requir-
ing pericardiocentesis, which revealed the presence of adenocar-
cinoma cells from previously undiagnosed occult primary lung
cancer. The median number of IL2 doses administered was 7.5
(3–14), and 23 patients (49%) received �1 cycle of treatment.
Primary endpoints
Of the 47 enrolled patients, 43 were evaluable for response.
Two patients with no measurable but evaluable disease (positive
FGD-PET scan only) at baseline were excluded from objective
ORR analysis but were included in the PFS and OS analyses. Figure
2A shows the total proportion of ORR for the 41 completers of
both phase I and II. Confirmed overall response was achieved by
15 [37%; 90% confidence interval (CI), 24–51; P ¼ 0.010]
patients, including 12 partial responses (PR) and three complete
responses (CR). In the phase II portion, 32 patients with mea-
surable disease were included and 10 achieved an objective
response (OR; 31%; 90% CI, 18–47; P ¼ 0.090). Stable disease
for �6 months was achieved by 18 patients (44%). The waterfall
plot shows the depth of the clinical responses, while the spider
plot highlights the duration of the responses in addition to the
tumor burden reduction from baseline (Fig. 2B and C). Two
patients with PR achieved complete resolution of their target
lesions but had persistent subcentimeter nontarget lung nodules.
Of note, there were two additional patients with no measurable
disease but evaluable lesions who achieved resolution of FDG
uptake on PET scan. These patients were not counted as ORs.
Delayed response has been observed. For example, a patient who
had initial progressive disease and discontinued treatment after
two cycles has subsequently achieved stable disease and did not
require further therapies. After 3 years of follow up, the patient is
now presenting continuous, slow reduction in number and size of
the lung nodules in the absence of further treatments.
At the time of data cutoff, median follow-up was 21.9 months
(95% CI, 2.1–65.0). At the last follow-up, the 3-year PFS was 19%
(95% CI, 6–38), and the median PFS was 13.8 months (95% CI,
6–18.8; Fig. 3A). The 3-year OS was 84% (95% CI, 62–94), and
the median OS was 65.3 months (95% CI, 52.6–65.3; Fig. 3B).
When we subgrouped the patients between those who achieved
an OR and those who did not (not OR), the 3-year PFS was 45%
(95% CI, 13–73) in the responders (OR) and 0% (95% CI, 2–31)
in the nonresponders (not OR). Similarly, the median PFS
was 28.5 months (95% CI, 12.6–NR) in the responders (OR)
and 5.7 months (95% CI, 3–10.4) in the nonresponders (not OR;
P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 3C). Interestingly, there was no difference between
the patients who achieved an OR and those who did not in terms
of the median number of IL2 doses administered (7.8 vs. 7.0).
Correlative studies
In a small number of patients, we were able to perform FDG-
PET/CT scans at baseline and at approximately day 30. Following
treatment with entinostat and high-dose IL2, we observed a
greater decrease in FDG uptake in the target lesions in those
patients who achieved an OR as compared with those who did
not (Fig. 4A and B). In 3 patients with accessible tumors, we were
able to perform a biopsy before starting treatment and during the
first cycle at approximately day 15. The results suggest that there
was a significant increase of tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells in
patients with either prolonged stable disease (patient 1; >15
months) or PR (patient 3; Fig. 5A and B). The biopsies also
showed either stable or decreased Treg infiltration despite the
administration of high-dose IL2, which was expected to increase
Tregs, and increased IFN-gamma producing CD8 (Supplementary
Fig. 1, 2A and B).
We also performed flow cytometry analysis in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells collected at different time points. Complete
samples were available only from a portion of patients receiving
treatment across the participating institutions. Our analysis has
focused primarily on the "priming phase" with entinostat (cycle 1
day-14 through cycle 1 day 1) to assess the activity of entinostat
alone without the potentially masking effect of high-dose IL2.
Following the first dose of entinostat, we observed a statistically

Overall, our results, as compared with historical data with
single-agent high-dose IL2, suggest that the addition of
the selective class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat may increase
the clinical efficacy of this cytokine therapy by modulating
immunosuppressive cells.
The potential immunomodulatory activity of epigenetic drugs
has been postulated since the beginning of their development, in

 view also of the sporadic tumor responses observed in patients
with solid tumors, including melanoma, at doses that likely do
not achieve the required micromolar concentrations for a direct
antitumor effect. Our group was among the first to report the
potential immunomodulatory activity of HDAC inhibitors in a
preclinical model of renal cell carcinoma (13). Several preclinical
studies now support the hypothesis that HDAC inhibitors may
synergize with immunotherapies by modulating the immune
response (19–21). For example, HDAC inhibitors have been
reported to enhance the effect of vaccine strategies (22). However,
this class of agents has been described as a sort of "double-edge
sword" (23). On one hand, there have been clinical trials that
utilized pan-HDAC inhibitors as adjuvant therapy to reduce
GVHD in patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow
transplant by exploiting the "immunosuppressive" properties of
these agents (24). On the other hand, preclinical models have
shown that HDAC inhibitors have a proimmunomodulatory
activity. Intriguingly, there is preclinical evidence that HDAC
inhibitors may have opposing effects as shown, for example, in
modulating Treg function (14, 25). Several reasons for these
conflicting results may be considered. For example, the class of
HDACI (I vs. I/II), the dose, and the schedule may be responsible
for these "double-edge sword" opposing effects (17). More recent-
ly, selective HDAC inhibition focusing on HDAC3 and HDAC11
has been reported to have specific effects on immune response by
regulating Tregs and APCs, respectively (26, 27). Ex vivo experi-
ments performed on peripheral mononuclear cells have shown
the potential for detrimental effects of class I/II HDAC inhibition
on lymphocyte viability and function (28), confirming the chal-
lenge that the development of this class of agents presents. Further
studies will be needed to elucidate the complex epigenetic regu-
lation of the immune response and to optimally exploit the
clinical benefit of HDAC inhibitors in combination with
immunotherapies.
The clinical trial was designed on the basis of the results from
preclinical studies in which we observed a greater synergy between
entinostat and high-dose IL2 when we treated the mice with
the HDAC inhibitor first. We hypothesized that this "priming"
phase of the immune response with entinostat could suppress
Treg function and create a less immunosuppressive tumor

 microenvironment for high-dose IL2 to exert its antitumor effect.
Indeed, during the 2-week "lead in" phase with entinostat, we
observed a modulation of Tregs. Despite the relatively small
number of patients, we observed a statistically significant greater
decrease in Tregs in the patients who achieve an OR as compared
with patients who had progressive disease. This decrease in Tregs
during the priming phase may represent a pharmacodynamic
parameter with predictive potential that warrants prospective
validation in future clinical trials. This observation is clinically
relevant as, to date, we do not have a validated marker to predict

 response to high-dose IL2. The SELECT trial attempted to define a
predictive signature, but the results were not informative (5).
Unfortunately, the collection of peripheral blood immune cells
(i.e., Tregs) was not performed in that study. Additional cor-
relative studies on the profile of circulating immune cells and
chemokines/cytokines will likely shed some light on the poten-
tial predictive values of these markers.
The treatment algorithm for ccRCC includes both anti-VEGF
drugs and immunotherapies. Although the use of PD-1/PD-L1 is
revolutionizing the therapeutic options for the majority of solid
tumors including ccRCC, the only immune checkpoint inhibitor
approved to date for ccRCC is nivolumab in the second-line
setting; however, the results from two phase III clinical trials
involving combinations with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors may
lead to the approval of these drugs in the first-line setting. Overall,
high-dose IL2 remains an option for selected ccRCC patients who
are seeking a durable response and possible cure of their disease.
The acute toxicities and the logistics for the administration of this
regimen represent undeniable drawbacks, but the side effects are
limited in time and are not chronic, unlike those observed with
other therapies, including potentially the immune checkpoint
inhibitors. Overall, entinostat did not seem to increase the toxi-
cities expected from high-dose IL2.
As several reports regarding the clinical benefit of sequential use
of high-dose IL2 and immune checkpoint inhibitors are surfacing,
it is intriguing to speculate that these two immunotherapeutic
approaches may not necessarily have cross-resistance mechan-
isms. Our results also support the hypothesis that HDAC inhibi-
tors may have a role in combination with other immunotherapies,
including PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as suggested by preclinical data
generated in our laboratory (unpublished). Interestingly, HDAC
inhibition has been shown to increase PD-L1 expression in
preclinical models, including in combination with a demethylat-
ing agent (29, 30). Furthermore, there is both preclinical and
clinical evidence that entinostat may affect myeloid suppressive
derived cells (31, 32). Thus, over the next years, several clinical
trials will test novel combinations of immunotherapies for
ccRCC, including checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, adoptive T-cell
therapy, and T-cell agonists (33), and HDAC inhibitors may
provide an additional tool to modulate the immune response
more effectively.
Our study has some limitations, including the small sample
size, the long time for accrual, the short follow-up, and the non-
randomized design, which prevent drawing any more definitive
conclusions. The accrual was initially slow because of compet-
ing studies at the participating institutions, in particular with
the availability of immune checkpoint inhibitors, but it signif-
icantly picked up in the past 2 years, homogenously across the
four sites. Despite these limitations that could have affected
the outcome, the degree of clinical benefit observed with this
combination exceeded the prespecified benchmark, providing
rationale to design additional studies of epigenetic priming
with immunotherapy.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of
entinostat plus high-dose IL2 is tolerable with promising clinical
activity, including higher response rate and greater median PFS as
compared with historical data. These findings represent the first
evidence, to our knowledge, of improved benefit through immu-
notherapy combination with an epigenetic agent in the first-line
setting treatment for ccRCC and provide the rationale for a
prospective validation of this therapeutic strategy. On the basis
of these preliminary results, we are currently planning a multisite,
randomized phase II study of high-dose IL2 þ/1 entinostat in the
same patient population.
