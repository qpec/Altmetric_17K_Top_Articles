The ability to assign safety to stimuli in the environment is integral
to everyday functioning. A key brain region for this evaluation is
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). To investigate the
importance of vmPFC safety signaling, we used neuroimaging of
Pavlovian fear reversal, a paradigm that involves flexible updating
when the contingencies for a threatening (CS+) and safe (CS–)
stimulus reverse, in a prototypical disorder of inflexible behavior
influenced by anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Skin
conductance responses in OCD patients (n = 43) failed to differen-
tiate during reversal compared with healthy controls (n = 35),
although significant differentiation did occur during early condi-
tioning and amygdala BOLD signaling was unaffected in these
patients. Increased vmPFC activation (for CS+ > CS–) during early
conditioning predicted the degree of generalization in OCD patients
during reversal, whereas vmPFC safety signals were absent through-
out learning in these patients. Regions of the salience network (dorsal
anterior cingulate, insula, and thalamus) showed early learning
task-related hyperconnectivity with the vmPFC in OCD, consistent
with biased processing of the CS+. Our findings reveal an absence
of vmPFC safety signaling in OCD, undermining flexible threat
updating and explicit contingency knowledge. Although differential
threat learning can occur to some extent in the absence of vmPFC
safety signals, effective CS– signaling becomes crucial during con-
flicting threat and safety cues. These results promote further inves-
tigation of vmPFC safety signaling in other anxiety disorders, with
potential implications for the development of exposure-based
therapies, in which safety signaling is likely to play a key role.

C
urrent behavioral therapies in anxiety-related disorders are
based on Pavlovian fear extinction models. As fear extinction
relies on revaluation of threatening stimuli as safe, it is critical to
address how the brain processes the safety of stimuli in the envi-
ronment. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to
play a multifaceted role in integrating affective evaluative processes
while mediating flexible behavior and is implicated in fear learning
and anxiety-related disorders (1–7). Prefrontal inflexibility in Ob-
sessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) suggests rigidity in threat
estimation alongside a persistent urge to perform compulsive be-
haviors, yet only one study has examined the neural correlates of
fear learning and extinction in this disorder, implicating a mal-
adaptive vmPFC (8).
Human fear learning studies usually involve contrasting a threat-
ening (CS+) stimulus that is occasionally paired with a shock with a
stimulus that is never paired with a shock and thus safe (CS–). When
using the CS+ > CS– contrast, the vmPFC consistently exhibits
negative activation values in healthy controls, indicating stronger
activation to the CS– than to the CS+ in this region (1–3, 7, 9).
Fear reversal (Fig. 1A), in which a once-threatening stimulus
turns safe and a once-safe stimulus becomes threatening, provides
the ideal model for determining the interaction between threat
versus safety valuation and prefrontal flexibility, as it indicates
an especially important role for the vmPFC in the updating of
the safe stimulus to provide “relief relabeling,” providing a cog-
nitive categorization of safety to a previously threatening cue (7).
The standard behavioral therapy for OCD is exposure response
prevention (ERP), which involves repeatedly exposing the patient to
fear-evoking stimuli while the patient is prevented from performing
any compulsions that usually provide the patient with a temporary
feeling of relief (10). This type of therapy can be very challenging
for patients, with many of them unable to complete or engage in
ERP, which has led to the idea of modifying ERP to allow for
certain safety behaviors (11). Therefore, it remains a critical ques-
tion how the processing of safety could be altered in OCD.
Based on the significance of the role of the vmPFC to estimate
values to guide goal-directed behavior (12) and the interference
of maladaptive vmPFC functioning in a variety of tasks in OCD
(5, 8, 13–17), we postulated that impaired vmPFC valuation
would be central to the disorder. We sought to determine how
patients with OCD perform on a task that is dependent on accurate
and flexible value signaling by this prefrontal region.
We hypothesized that OCD patients would show inflexibility in
updating threat and safety expectancies associated with maladaptive
vmPFC safety signaling in a previously validated fear reversal par-
adigm (7). We compared fear reversal learning in 43 OCD patients
and 35 matched healthy controls by assessing threat expectancy with
skin conductance responses (SCRs) and its neural correlates with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (7). Our goals were to (i)
relate any differences in threat learning and reversal to group dif-
ferences on the whole brain level corrected for multiple comparisons,
Significance
Assigning safety to stimuli and situations forms an important
part of everyday functioning. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
(OCD) is a prototypical disorder of inflexible behavior influenced
by anxiety. Here we show, using neuroimaging of fear reversal
learning, which involves a previously threatening stimulus be-
coming safe while a previously safe stimulus becomes threat-
ening, that OCD patients fail to differentiate a safe from a
threatening stimulus only after such a reversal, as measured by
skin conductance responses. This OCD impairment in safety
signaling, a likely prominent component of successful exposure
therapy, is predicted and mediated by altered activity in a neural
salience network including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

 (ii) assess the importance of the vmPFC in accurate threat reversal
in OCD, and (iii) perform region of interest analyses (ROIs) for
key areas in fear learning (amygdala and striatum) to investigate
possible group differences. Learning was quantified as the differ-
ence between SCRs to the CS+ and CS– during acquisition and
reversal, which were divided into early (first half) and late (second
half) phases (Fig. 1B). The data analyses mainly used the contrast
between the CS+ and CS–, which refers to the original CS+ and CS–
during acquisition and the reversed CS+ and CS– during reversal.
Results
Skin Conductance Analyses Revealed Weaker Differential Learning in
OCD, Driven by Significant Reductions in Differentiation During Late
Acquisition and Late Reversal. To directly compare threat learning
in the OCD group with controls, a between-group repeated-
measures analysis with two factors (acquisition and reversal) and
two stages each (early and late) revealed a significant main effect
of group overall reflecting stronger differential learning in con-
trols (F1, 76 = 5.666, P = 0.02) but also a significant Group ×
Stage interaction (F1, 76 = 5.87, P = 0.018), driven by a stronger
differentiation deficit in OCD patients during late acquisition
(F1, 76 = 5.635, P = 0.02) and late reversal (F1, 76 = 5.129, P =
0.026), when the presence of safety signaling is required.
Direct Comparisons Between CS+ and CS– SCRs in Each Group Show
That OCD Patients Can Differentiate the CS+ Versus the CS– During
Acquisition but Fail to Differentiate During Reversal. To measure
contingency knowledge, we measured differential SCRs, where
significantly greater responding to the CS+ compared with the
CS– reflects intact contingency learning. OCD patients and
healthy controls both showed highly significant early (t42 = 5.808,
P = 0.0000007; t34 = 5.812, P = 0.000002) and late (t42 = 5.196, P =
0.000006; t34 = 6.630, P = 0.0000001) fear learning. However,
during early and late reversal, only healthy controls differenti-
ated the CS+ and CS– (t35 = 3.274, P = 0.002; t35 = 3.836, P =
0.001), whereas OCD patients failed to differentiate between
stimuli during both early and late stages of reversal (t42 = 1.562,
P = 0.126; t42 = 1.056, P = 0.297).
Our study only included OCD patients without comorbidities
and was balanced in terms of males versus females compared
with controls. Our study was not designed with the purpose of
looking at gender differences in conditioning, but it is interesting
to note that females had stronger differential conditioning than
males (see SI Materials and Methods for statistics), irrespective of
the group difference.
Whole-Brain Family Wise Error-Corrected CS+ > CS– fMRI Results. For
these same learning stages, we tested for whole-brain group
differences at P < 0.05 family wise error (FWE) corrected using a
CS+ > CS– contrast. This contrast therefore always depicts the
CS+ > CS– activation, which is the original CS+ > original CS–
during acquisition and the updated CS+ (previous CS–) > updated
CS– (original CS+) during reversal. Therefore, positive values
depict stronger signaling to the CS+ and negative values depict
stronger signaling to the CS–. As seen in Fig. 2A, our whole-brain
results showed that the vmPFC (–3, 26, –8) contrast was signifi-
cantly more positive in OCD patients compared with controls
during early acquisition at the whole-brain level (t76 = 7.35, P <
0.0001 FWE, 112 voxels). Differential CS+ > CS– activity plotted
for these same voxels for the following stages revealed that the
vmPFC flexibly tracked the CS– in controls with below baseline
activity for this contrast, whereas sustained positive contrast activity
in OCD indicated persistent increased CS+ signaling for both the
initial CS+ and the reversed CS+ (Fig. 2B).
These differential CS+ > CS– negative vmPFC values were sig-
nificantly different from zero in controls for early acquisition (t34 =
–3.674, P = 0.001), late acquisition (t34 = –2.901, P = 0.006), and
late reversal (t34 = –4.222, P = 0.00017), indicating stronger vmPFC
CS– signaling in controls during all stages apart from early reversal
(t34 = –0.126, P = 0.9). The vmPFC in OCD patients exhibited
positive vmPFC values that were significantly different from zero
during all stages: early acquisition (t42 = 2.381, P = 0.022), late
acquisition (t42 = 2.599, P = 0.013), early reversal (t42 = 2.075, P =
0.044), and late reversal (t42 = 3.365, P = 0.002), indicating biased
responding to the CS+ in this disorder.
Additionally, our whole-brain group analyses revealed signif-
icant differences during late reversal in both the left insula (–30,
23, 1; t76 = 6.55, P < 0.0001 FWE, 260 voxels) and the left globus
pallidus (–12, 2, 1; t76 = 6.04, P < 0.0001 FWE, 34 voxels), which
both exhibited increased CS+ > CS– activation in controls
compared with OCD patients (Fig. S1). These increased whole-
brain signals in both the globus pallidus and insula for CS+ >
CS– during late reversal in healthy controls further showed that

so that the old CS+ became the new CS– and vice versa with the same number
of trials. (B) Measured SCRs demonstrated that both OCD patients and controls

 effective safety updating by the vmPFC results in a whole-brain
detectable signature of accurate differential shock expectancy in
brain regions preparing responses to possible threat in healthy
controls but not in OCD patients (18).
Additional CS+ and CS– > Baseline fMRI Results. In addition to our
main analysis investigating predictive vmPFC signaling comparing
the CS+ versus the CS– to indicate relative bias of expectancies
about shock expectation, we also used a mask of the voxels of the
initial CS+ > CS– contrast to investigate vmPFC CS+ and CS–
responding separately versus baseline [average of intertrial inter-
vals (ITIs) when the cross was presented], as depicted in Fig. S2.
These results confirmed an absence of vmPFC CS– processing in
OCD (Early Acq, t42 = 0.710, P = 0.481; Late Acq, t42 = 0.174, P =
0.862; Early Rev, t42 = 1.261, P = 0.214; Late Rev, t42 = 0.588, P =
0.56) compared with mostly significant vmPFC CS+ processing
(Early Acq, t42 = 2.579, P = 0.013; Late Acq, t42 = 1.731, P = 0.091;
Early Rev, t42 = 2.366, P = 0.023; Late Rev, t42 = 2.673, P = 0.011).
In contrast, controls sustained highly significant vmPFC CS–
signaling (Early Acq, t34 = 3.545, P = 0.001; Late Acq, t34 = 4.105, P =
0.000239; Early Rev, t34 = 3.696, P = 0.001; Late Rev, t34 = 4.034, P =
0.000294) versus weak vmPFC CS+ signaling that was only
marginally significant during early acquisition (Early Acq, t34 =
2.055, P = 0.048; Late Acq, t34 = 1.73, P = 0.092; Early Rev, t34 =
1.144, P = 0.261; Late Rev, t34 = 1.251, P = 0.22).
Whole-Brain FWE New CS– > Original CS– Contrast. To additionally
examine updating of the safety response, we used the new CS–
(both reversal stages) > original CS– (both acquisition stages)
whole-brain contrast (Fig. 2C), which revealed a significantly
stronger vmPFC (–2, 26, –2) signal in healthy controls compared
with the absence of such a signal in OCD patients (t76 = 5.01, P =
0.023, FWE, 16 voxels), indicating that updated vmPFC safety
signaling is also lacking in OCD patients as expected.
vmPFC CS+ > CS– Contrast Predicts Reversal Deficit in OCD. As the
vmPFC was also the only region showing whole-brain differences
during early learning and is critical for safety signaling and re-
versal, we investigated the correlation between this difference in
OCD patients and their subsequent inability to update threat
estimation as reflected by their SCRs. This highly significant
correlation (r = 0.668, n = 43, P = 0.000001) as seen in Fig. 2D
showed that the OCD positive activation contrast during early
fear acquisition, when learning was still intact, predicted the level
of differentiation (or, inversely, generalization) between the re-
versed CS+ and CS–. Moreover, further examination of the
correlation of early vmPFC apparent hyperactivation with CS+
and CS– SCRs for each stage revealed a significant correlation
specifically with CS– SCRs during early learning (r = 0.330, n =
43, P = 0.031) and early reversal (r = 0.361, n = 43, P = 0.018),
indicating a particular role for vmPFC hyperactivation in mal-
adaptive safety responding in OCD. Furthermore, in controls,
early vmPFC hypoactivation for CS+ > CS– significantly corre-
lated with the strength of differentiation during early learning
(r = 0.462, n = 35, P = 0.005), further supporting the notion of the
important role of vmPFC safety signaling in differential threat
learning. It is important to note that the common convention of
using the terms “hyperactivation” and “hypoactivation” in task-
related fMRI is only reflective of activation in regards to the
contrast chosen. For the purposes of conventional description, we
also refer to this positive CS+ > CS– contrast in OCD patients
as hyperactivation.
Explicit Knowledge of the CS+ and CS– Following Reversal and
Ratings of Shock Aversion. We also measured subjects’ explicit
knowledge of the task contingencies postexperiment. Remarkably,
14/43 OCD patients reported getting shocks to both the new CS–
(old CS+) and the new CS+ (old CS–) following reversal, com-
pared with only 2/35 of controls, corresponding to a significant
difference across groups, χ2(df = 1, n = 78) = 8.527, P = 0.0035. In
a post hoc test, we found that early vmPFC activity (Fig. 2E) was
significantly higher (F1, 41 = 5.395, P = 0.025) in that subgroup of
OCD patients with incorrect contingency knowledge (n = 14) com-
pared with those OCD patients reporting the correct contingencies
(n = 29). Participants were also asked to rate how aversive they
perceived the shock to be on a scale from 1–4, and OCD patients
and controls showed remarkably similar ratings (mildly aversive at
averages of 2.4 and 2.5, respectively; NS, t76 = –0.788, P = 0.433).
Task-Related CS+ > CS– Functional Connectivity of the VmPFC. To
elucidate the role of early vmPFC hyperactivation for CS+ > CS–
signaling within its associated neuroanatomical circuitry, we used a
psychophysiological interaction (PPI) to test for whole-brain dif-
ferences between OCD patients and controls with a vmPFC ROI
for the CS+ > CS– contrast for all stages (Fig. 3). OCD patients
had significantly stronger task-related connectivity of the vmPFC
with areas of the salience network (19) comprising the dorsal
anterior cingulate (–6, 17, 31; t76 = 6.81, P < 0.0001, FWE,
393 voxels), left insula (–33, 20, 7; t76 = 7.47, P < 0.0001, FWE, 506
voxels), right insula (42, 23, 4; t76 = 9.04, P < 0.0001, FWE,
549 voxels), and right thalamus (12, 2, 4; t76 = 6.29, P < 0.0001,
FWE, 56 voxels) during early acquisition only, indicating that
OCD patients solely assigned salience to the CS+, whereas the
CS+ and CS– were likely of similar saliency in controls.
ROIs of the Amygdala and Caudate. Previous work has established
important roles for the amygdala-striatal network in aversive
learning in humans (2, 20, 21), including for this paradigm (7).
Hence we used ROIs (according to the original threat reversal

 findings in healthy controls) (7) for the left amygdala and left
caudate (striatum), two areas known to play important roles in
fear learning and reversal. We compared CS+ > CS– activation
between OCD patients and controls for each stage (Fig. S3). Left
amygdala (–24, –1, –17) differentiation (Fig. S3A) was comparable
in OCD patients and controls for all stages (F1, 76 < 0.4, P > 0.5),
consistent with intact learning of the CS+ to unconditioned stim-
ulus (US) association. The left caudate (–8, 2, 10) tracked differ-
entiation of the CS+ and CS– during acquisition similarly (Fig.
S3B) for both controls and OCD patients (F1, 76 < 2.6, P > 0.1), but
this difference was absent in OCD patients compared with controls
during early reversal (F1, 76 = 17.782, P < 0.0001) and late reversal
(F1, 76 = 26.372, P < 0.0001), reflecting flexible tracking of updated
CS+ versus CS– contingencies by the controls’ caudate compared
with an absence in updating in OCD patients (7, 22).
Discussion
These findings show a failure to learn about threat versus safety
values during reversal in OCD due to a lack of vmPFC safety
signaling, demonstrated by their nondifferential SCRs during
this stage. A recent meta-analysis highlighted the importance of
vmPFC safety signals, expressed as consistent deactivations for
the CS+ > CS– contrast in this region, resulting from stronger
signaling to the CS– (23), and emphasized how effective CS–
processing is an active process. The absence of such a safety
signal in the vmPFC during both reversal and acquisition in OCD
combined with the ability to differentiate the CS+ versus CS–
during basic conditioning suggests that OCD patients acquire
threat conditioning mainly by labeling the valence of the CS+,
rather than additionally assigning a “safe” label to the CS–. This
account is further supported by five findings: (i) During early
learning, vmPFC connectivity was enhanced within the salience
network, indicating that OCD patients relied on the salience of
the CS+ alone to acquire threat estimation during learning; (ii)
positive values for the vmPFC activation contrast for CS+ > CS–
during early fear learning was predictive of the generalization
deficit found during reversal; (iii) this positive vmPFC contrast
for CS+ > CS– in OCD during early learning was correlated with
CS– responding during early learning and early reversal; (iv) the
amount of vmPFC hypoactivation for CS+ > CS– in healthy
controls was positively correlated with the strength of CS+ versus
CS– differentiation during early learning; and (v) group com-
parisons of skin conductance revealed significantly stronger dif-
ferentiation in controls during late acquisition and late reversal,
which indicates that contrast learning about both the threat of
the CS+ and safety of the CS– supports stronger differentiation
between the two. Previously, it has been shown that the vmPFC
has roles in extinction learning (2) and retrieval (1, 3), as well as
in emotional regulation (24) and (re)valuation (6, 25), and is
implicated in impaired extinction learning in adults with OCD
(8). Results found in youth with OCD highlighted impaired in-
hibitory learning and contingency awareness during extinction
(26), whereas findings from a sample of lifelong OCD patients
showed impaired extinction recall (27), which are in line with
impaired learning about newly acquired safety. However, a critical
role in safety signaling (7, 28) has hitherto received insufficient
attention in anxiety-related disorders.
Hare et al. have postulated that the vmPFC originally evolved
to compute the immediate value of stimuli (12), which renders
this brain region central to many psychiatric disorders in which
valuation has gone awry. In the case of OCD, it is easy to con-
ceive the vmPFC to be excessively involved in internal valuation
of idiosyncratic goals that constitute the compulsions seen in
these patients. Even though OCD patients are generally not
considered delusional, the value of their compulsions and the
urge to keep performing them can severely disrupt their everyday
functioning and impedes achievements of long-term goals.
Although we cannot conclude from task-related fMRI that the
underlying neural deficit for these findings in OCD is vmPFC
hyperactivation, findings from other task-independent studies
using resting-state fMRI and positron emission tomography
(PET) measures indicate this to be likely (29, 30), emphasizing
that the vmPFC is a key node in an overactive thalamo-cortico-
striatal pathway. We hypothesize that this sustained vmPFC
hypermetabolism impedes safety learning in OCD.
Considering possible explanations for the apparently sustained
vmPFC hyperactivation in OCD for the CS+ > CS– contrast, this
structure is a central component of the default mode network
and is thus implicated in self-referential thinking, normally be-
coming deactivated during externally directed attention (31).
Such deactivation is well known to occur during early differential
threat conditioning (1, 2, 7, 8) as a consequence of stronger sig-
naling to the CS–. Furthermore, several studies have shown a failure
of OCD patients to deactivate the vmPFC during task-related ex-
ternally directed attention (13, 32), supporting the hypothesis that
OCD patients’ vmPFC is overrecruited by self-referential thoughts
and thus unavailable for effective valuation (13). Similarly, the
vmPFC also exhibited significantly enhanced activation in OCD
patients during initial learning of responding to a CS+ versus a CS–
in a shock avoidance paradigm compared with controls (33). Safety
signaling is one of the aspects of the vmPFC valuation system
compromised in OCD but might be of specific relevance, as ERP
therapy, the first line of behavioral treatment in OCD, depends on
Fig. 3.
OCD patients show increased early learning-related coupling of the
vmPFC with salience areas. (A) Areas involved in salience processing showed
increased coupling with the vmPFC during early conditioning in OCD pa-
tients. (B) First eigenvariates of these salience network regions depict sig-
nificant increased coupling with the vmPFC in OCD patients during early
acquisition dACC (–6, 17, 31; t76 = 6.81, P < 0.0001, FWE, 393 voxels), left
insula (–33, 20, 7; t76 = 7.47, P < 0.0001, FWE, 506 voxels), right insula (42, 23,
4; t76 = 9.04, P < 0.0001, FWE, 549 voxels), and right thalamus (12, 2, 4; t76 =
6.29, P < 0.0001, FWE, 56 voxels).

are instructed to refrain from performing their safety behavior (34).
To make this therapy successful, a safety memory has to become
established; otherwise, a stressful situation might trigger the return
of the urge to perform such irrational yet compulsive safety be-
havior. The urge to perform an experimentally trained habit has
been shown to be associated with hyperactivity in the caudate in
OCD patients (33), whereas the vmPFC is thought to influence the
caudate for goal selection (35, 36). Therefore, an aberrant vmPFC
valuation system as demonstrated across several tasks in OCD
(5, 17, 37) is of critical relevance to the maintenance of the disorder.
The differentiation failure during threat reversal in OCD patients
was also reflected in their nondiscriminative striatal responses
during this stage, likely due to the absence of the vmPFC safety
signal (7). Although anxiety is often considered central to OCD,
suggesting a putative role for the amygdala (38), OCD patients
and controls exhibited strikingly similar amygdala processing
during acquisition and reversal learning, indicating that gener-
alization was not due to amygdala impairment and that learning
of the CS+ to US association was intact in OCD. Moreover,
SCRs were overall lower in OCD, likely due to the absence of
the sharpening of the CS+ versus CS– contrast through safety
learning, ruling out generalized anxiety related to receiving
shocks, additionally confirmed by very similar shock aversion
ratings as controls. These results further query the precise re-
lationship of anxiety symptoms to obsessions and compulsions as
acknowledged by the new designation of OCD without the
Anxiety Disorders categorization in DSM5 and within its own
category of OCDs (39). Although fear generalization may play
an important role in generalized anxiety disorder (40), fear
generalization in OCD only manifested itself during reversal
when successful updating became contingent on an instructive
vmPFC safety signal. Not only did OCD patients fail to differ-
entiate between the threatening and updated safe stimulus dur-
ing reversal, a third of them believed that they were receiving
shocks to both faces, further underscoring the importance of
safety valuation. Only one study to date has investigated neural
correlates of fear learning and extinction in OCD (8), finding
enhanced retention of fear after extinction. Our threat reversal
paradigm highlights instead detrimental effects of the absence of
safety signaling by the vmPFC in OCD that normally enables
flexible responding to changing threats. In light of a recent study
revealing that many fMRI results could reflect false positives
(41), it is important to emphasize that our main findings were
based on whole-brain group comparisons FEW-corrected at a
significance level of P < 0.0001, indicative of convincing differ-
ences in vmPFC activation between OCD patients and controls.
Moreover, a PET study had already implied a prominent role for
the vmPFC in OCD, showing that deep brain stimulation of the
subthalamic nucleus resulted in a strong decrease in vmPFC
metabolism that correlated with an improvement in Yale Brown
Obsessive Compulsive (Y-BOCS) scores (30).
To summarize, our findings indicate that a maladaptive
vmPFC combined with increased connectivity with areas involved
in salience processing undermines accurate safety learning in OCD
patients, resulting in inflexible threat beliefs. Further research into
safety learning could help in the development of novel exposure-
based therapies.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Forty-three OCD patients and 35 matched controls were included
in our analyses. Data were collected for 46 OCD patients and 40 controls, of
which we had to exclude 4 due to excessive motion artifacts (2 controls and 2
OCD patients) and 4 due to absence of skin conductance measurements
(3 controls and 1 OCD patient). The majority of participants were right-
handed, but we also included five left-handed participants for each group.
Eligible participants reported no history of head trauma, neurological disease,
substance dependence, or contraindications for MRI. Participants provided in-
formed written consent before participation, and the Cambridge Central Re-
search Ethics Committee approved the study. Participants’ demographics are
presented in Table S1 and Fig. S4. Further details about the participants are
provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Threat Reversal Paradigm and Skin Conductance Measurements. In the acqui-
sition phase, face (face A) occurred 16 times without the shock (CS+) and 8
times with the shock (CS+ US), and the other face (face B) was never paired
with the shock (16 trials). In the reversal phase, these contingencies reversed,
so that now face B was paired with the US on 8 trials (CS+ US), 16 times
without the shock (CS+), and face A was now never paired with the US (new
CS–, 16 trials). Reversal immediately and continuously followed acquisition
as part of the same scanning run and was unsignaled. The order of the
different trial types was pseudorandomized (no consecutive shocks and no
more than two consecutive trials of any kind), and the designation of face A
and face B was counterbalanced. The analyses only included the trials
without a shock, meaning trials that were either a CS+, when a shock might
be expected, and CS–, when a shock would never occur. SCRs were defined
as the baseline to peak difference within a 7-s interval following the pre-
sentation of a CS. SCR data were normalized per participant by dividing all
responses to their peak amplitude. Specifics about the paradigm, task in-
structions, and SCR analyses can be found in SI Materials and Methods.
Neuroimaging. All fMRI data were acquired in a single session at the Wolfson
Brain Imaging Institute at Addenbrooke’s Hospital using a 3 Tesla Siemens
Magnetom Trio scanner. All neuroimaging acquisition, preprocessing, and
analyses details (data processed in SPM8) are presented in SI Materials
and Methods.
