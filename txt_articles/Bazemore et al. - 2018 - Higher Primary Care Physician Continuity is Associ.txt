Higher Primary Care Physician Continuity is Associated 
With Lower Costs and Hospitalizations
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Continuity of care is a defining characteristic of primary care associ-
ated with lower costs and improved health equity and care quality. However, we 
lack provider-level measures of primary care continuity amenable to value-based 
payment, including the Medicare Quality Payment Program (QPP). We created 
4 physician-level, claims-based continuity measures and tested their associations 
with health care expenditures and hospitalizations.
METHODS We used Medicare claims data for 1,448,952 beneficiaries obtaining 
care from a nationally representative sample of 6,551 primary care physicians 
to calculate continuity scores by 4 established methods. Patient-level continuity 
scores attributed to a single physician were averaged to create physician-level 
scores. We used beneficiary multilevel models, including beneficiary controls, phy-
sician characteristics, and practice rurality to estimate associations with total Medi-
care Part A & B expenditures (allowed charges, logged), and any hospitalization.
RESULTS Our continuity measures were highly correlated (correlation coefficients 
ranged from 0.86 to 0.99), with greater continuity associated with similar out-
comes for each. Adjusted expenditures for beneficiaries cared for by physicians 
in the highest Bice-Boxerman continuity score quintile were 14.1% lower than for 
those in the lowest quintile ($8,092 vs $6,958; β 
= 
–0.151; 95% CI, –0.186 to 
–0.116), and the odds of hospitalization were 16.1% lower between the highest 
and lowest continuity quintiles (OR 
= 
0.839; 95% CI, 0.787 to 0.893).
CONCLUSIONS All 4 continuity scores tested were significantly associated with 
lower total expenditures and hospitalization rates. Such indices are potentially 
useful as QPP measures, and may also serve as proxy resource-use measures, 
given the strength of association with lower costs and utilization.

INTRODUCTION
T
he Institute of Medicine labeled continuity of care a defining 
characteristic of primary care, one that Starfield and others dem-
onstrated as essential to primary care’s positive impact on health 
equity, cost reduction, and improved quality of care.1-4 Described as 
an implicit contract between physician and patient in which the physi-
cian assumes ongoing responsibility for the patient,5 continuity frames 
the personal nature of medical care, in contrast to the dehumanizing 
nature of disjointed care.6 Building on the idea that knowledge, trust, 
and respect have developed between the patient and provider over time, 
allowing for better interaction and communication,7 continuity at the 
patient level is associated with a host of benefits.8
Primary care has more measures than any other sector under the 
federal Quality Payment Program (QPP), yet most of these are disease 
specific or process measures that do not capture the core primary care 
functions. Despite a variety of definitions and calculations over the last 
40 years, little has been done to operationalize continuity as a quality 
measure linked to policy-relevant outcomes in the United States or other 
nations.9 Given current US attention to provider-level, vs practice-level,

measures in its value-based purchasing reforms, the 
objective of our study was to examine the relationship 
between physician-level continuity and health care 
expenditures and hospitalizations.
METHODS
Sample
We used US Medicare claims data for 1,448,952 
beneficiaries obtaining primary care in 2011 from a 
nationally representative sample of primary care physi-
cians (n = 6,551), including family physicians, general 
practitioners, and general internists (but not geriatri-
cians) to calculate patient-level primary care continu-
ity scores for 4 measures (Usual Provider Continuity 
[UPC] index,10 Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care 
[BB-COC],11 Modified Modified Continuity Index 
[MMCI],12 and the Herfindahl Index [HI]13). These 4 
measures were selected after a comprehensive review 
of relevant literature found them to be the most richly 
described and commonly used measures of continuity. 
They build on slightly different domains: (1) the den-
sity of visits with a provider (UPC), (2) the dispersion 
of visits among various providers (UPC, BB-COC, 
MMCI), and (3) the concentration of visits with a par-
ticular provider (HI). Consistent with prior approaches, 
we assigned each beneficiary to the single primary care 
physician who provided the most outpatient primary 
care visits to that beneficiary.14 We excluded hospital-
ists using methods previously described,15 beneficiaries 
aged less than 65 years with 1 or fewer primary care 
visits, and physicians with fewer than 30 beneficiaries.
Continuity Measures
For all patients with 2 or more visits, we calculated 4 
measures of continuity from utilization data. Patient-
level continuity scores were then averaged to produce 
physician-level scores using each of the 4 measures. 
Scores were weighted by number of visits, thereby 
increasing continuity scores for beneficiaries obtain-
ing more primary care.
Variables
We used 2 outcome measures: (1) the natural log of 
total spending based on allowed charges for Part A 
(inpatient, skilled nursing, hospice care) and Part B 
(outpatient doctor visits, laboratories, x-rays, preven-
tive services); and (2) whether or not the beneficiary 
was hospitalized in 2011. We constructed a modified 
Charlson score16 and count of the number of primary 
care visits for each patient. Using the zip code where 
the primary care physician provided most of their care, 
we created 2 measures: (1) rurality, using Rural Urban 
Commuting Area Codes categories (urban, large rural, 
small rural, isolated rural/frontier)17; and (2) region. 
Physician specialty information was determined from 
claims data. From the American Medical Association 
Masterfile, we determined country of medical school 
and graduation year.
Analysis
We first used descriptive statistics and simple bivari-
ate analyses to examine the association between the 4 
weighted continuity measures and patient, geographic, 
and physician characteristics. We then estimated ben-
eficiary multilevel models to assess association with 
expenditures (allowed charges) and hospitalizations 
that controlled for beneficiary (age, sex, race, Charlson 
score) and physician characteristics (graduation year, 
international training, sex, rurality). Given the overs-
ampling of physicians in smaller states, we weighted 
the data to obtain national estimates. In our examina-
tion of expenditures, we used a general linear model 
with a gamma distribution and log link. For hospital-
izations, we used a logistic model. We estimated sepa-
rate models for each of the 4 continuity measures.
All analyses were done using Stata version 14.2 
(StataCorp LLC).18 All tests of significance were 
2-sided. Significant results were defined at P <.01. The 
American Academy of Family Physicians Institutional 
Review Board approved this study.
RESULTS
We found a strong correlation across the 4 continuity 
measures; correlation coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 
0.99 (Supplemental Table 1, available at http://www.
annfammed.org/content/16/6/492/suppl/DC1/). All 
were approximately normally distributed, but with a 
negative (left) skew (Figure 1).  Physicians with more 
years since graduation, more Medicare patients, and 
those practicing in rural areas were more likely to pro-
vide continuous care. Primary care physicians practic-
ing in the West were less likely to provide continuous 
care (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 2 available at http://
www.annfammed.org/content/16/6/492/suppl/DC1/). 
Given the tight correlations, and the National 
Quality Forum endorsement of the BB-COC as a qual-
ity measure for care of children with complex needs, 
we selected the BB-COC to illustrate our findings. 
Parallel results for the other 3 continuity measures 
are presented in Supplemental Table 3 (Supplemen-
tal Table 3 available at http://www.annfammed.org/
content/16/6/492/suppl/DC1/).
Of the 1,448,952 beneficiaries obtaining some care 
from the 6,551 primary care physicians in our sample, 
1,178,369 (81.1%) obtained most of their care from 
them. Adjusted expenditures for beneficiaries cared for

by physicians in the highest BB-COC quintile ($6,958) 
were 14.1% lower than for those in the lowest quintile 
($8,092) (β = –0.151; 95% CI, –0.186 to –0.116). The 
odds of any hospitalization were 16.1% lower at the 
highest continuity quintile compared with the lowest 
quintile (OR = 0.839; 95% CI, 0.787 to 0.893) (Figure 
3). Analyses of alternative continuity measures yielded 
similar results (Supplemental Table 3, available at 
http://www.annfammed.org/content/16/6/492/suppl/
DC1/). The reduction in allowed charges from high-
est to lowest quintiles ranged from 12.4% (MMCI) to 
15.7% (UPC and HI). Similarly, the reduction in the 
odds of hospitalizations from the highest to lowest 
quintiles ranged from 15.7% (HI) to 17.1% (MMCI).
DISCUSSION
We found a strong association between higher levels 
of physician-level continuity, a core tenet of primary 
care, and lower total health care costs and hospitaliza-
tions. These findings support international findings19 
and previous analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with 
specific chronic diseases,20 but with a much larger and 
more generalizable sample. The value associated with 
a 14% reduction in costs is roughly $1,000/benefi-
ciary/year. Higher continuity, measured at the patient 
level using BB-COC, was recently shown to be signifi-
cantly associated with reduction in emergency care 
for elderly patients in England,21 and a recent sys-
tematic review found significant, positive association 
between continuity and reduced mortality.22 Continu-
ity is already endorsed by the National Quality Forum 
as a quality measure for children with complex care 
needs, and these findings suggest that continuity may 
be useful as a physician-level measure for quality and/
or resource use under the QPP. The BB-COC conti-
nuity index is provisionally approved as a Qualified 
Clinical Data Registry measure for QPP for partici-
pants in the PRIME Registry but it remains unclear 
what additional information the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services will require to accept it for 
wider use. High-value primary care measures, includ-
ing continuity and comprehensiveness, might simulta-
neously serve as metrics of both quality and resource 
use, given their now demonstrated relationship to 
substantial cost/utilization reductions.23
Primary care has the largest number of QPP 
measures but most of these are intermediate, disease-

focused, and process measures, which risk driving pri-
mary care focus away from its core functions and real 
value. When tied to strong extrinsic motivation, namely 
payment, these measures threaten a continued erosion 
of primary care’s commitment to care continuity. Per-
haps related, national health surveys suggest a decline

in people identifying a usual source of care.21,24 There 
is a strong, national effort to move Medicare providers 
into value-based payment, including the federal QPP, 
and the alignment of such payment with high-value pri-
mary care functions would logically be a priority.
Our research has limitations, and further work is 
needed to understand how continuity measurement 
might impact provider behavior. Whether these continu-
ity outcomes hold for populations other than Medicare 
beneficiaries cannot be inferred from our study, nor can 
we comment on whether and how associations would 
change over a study period longer than a single year. 
Several of the cited studies,3,4,5,19,20 however, do suggest 
that the associated benefits are not 
age dependent, and it is likely that 
continuity over a longer period 
would convey even greater protec-
tion from undesirable outcomes.
In summary, this study con-
tributes to the overwhelming 
evidence of the value of continu-
ity care5,7,8,11-13,21,22, 25,26 and offers 
1 or more quality measures that 
could be used and prioritized in 
the QPP or other value-based pay-
ment models. Continuity is 1 of a 
handful of core tenets of primary 
care that should be incorporated 
into official primary care measures 
as we shift from paying for ser-
vices to paying for value. Future 
studies should investigate the rela-
tive effects of provider vs team 
and practice continuity, continuity 
across settings (eg, inpatient to 
outpatient), and further refine cal-
culations of continuity to capture 
effects of longitudinal continuity. 
Research is also urgently needed 
to produce reliable measures of 
other core primary care tenets 
such as comprehensiveness and 
coordination.
