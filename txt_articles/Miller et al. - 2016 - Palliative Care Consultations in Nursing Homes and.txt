OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how receipt and timing of
nursing home (NH) palliative care consultations (primarily
by nurse practitioners with palliative care expertise) are
associated with end-of-life care transitions and acute care
use
DESIGN: Propensity score–matched retrospective cohort
study.
SETTING: Forty-six NHs in two states.
PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents who died from
2006 to 2010 stratified according to days between initial
consultation
and
death
(≤7,
8–30,
31–60,
61–180).
Propensity
score
matching
identified
three
controls
(n = 1,174) according to strata for each consultation recip-
ient (n = 477).
MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were hospitalizations in
the last 7, 30, and 60 days of life; emergency department
(ED) visits in the last 30 and 60 days; and any potentially
burdensome care transition, defined as hospitalization or
hospice admission within 3 days of death or two or more
hospitalizations or ED visits within 30 days. Weighted
multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to eval-
uate outcomes.
RESULTS: Residents with consultations had lower rates of
hospitalization than controls, with rates lowest when initial
consultations were furthest from death. For instance, in resi-
dents with initial consultations 8 to 30 days before death,
the adjusted hospitalization rate in the last 7 days of life
was 11.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.8–12.4%), vs
22.0% (95% CI = 20.6–23.4%) in controls, although in
those with initial consultations 61 to 180 days before death,
rates were 6.9% (95% CI = 5.5–8.4%), vs 22.9% (95%
CI = 20.5–25.4%). Potentially burdensome transition rates
were lower when consultations were 61 to 180 days before
death (16.2%, 95% CI = 13.7–18.6%), vs 28.2% (95%
CI = 25.8–30.6%) for controls.
CONCLUSION: Palliative
care
consultations
improve
end-of-life NH care by reducing acute care use and poten-
tially burdensome care transitions. J Am Geriatr Soc

P
alliative care optimizes the quality of life of persons
with serious illness by anticipating, preventing, and
alleviating suffering across the care continuum.1 The Insti-
tute of Medicine recommends that persons with advanced
serious illness should have access to specialty palliative
care across care settings.2 Still, for the half million older
adults dying in U.S. nursing homes (NHs) each year, and
those living in NHs with advanced illness, access to pallia-
tive care is often lacking.3–6 Hospice is a major source of
palliative care in NHs, but half of individuals in NH hos-
pice have enrollments of 22 days or less, and long hospice
stays for this population are costly and trigger regulatory
scrutiny.7–9 An alternative model is needed to expand the
availability of palliative care expertise in NHs beyond that
currently available through Medicare hospice.3,5,6,10 To
expand access, some NHs now offer palliative care consul-
tations by external providers with palliative care expertise
(specialty palliative care consultations) to residents, but
there is a lack of empirical evidence of the value of this
approach.
Palliative care consultations differ from Medicare hos-
pice in that they do not require active choice by residents
and families or forfeiture of Medicare Part A benefits

 (hospital and skilled nursing facility care). Also, a physi-
cian-certified terminal prognosis of 6 months or less is not
required. Similar to NH hospice, palliative care consulta-
tions are often initiated at the request of NH staff or fam-
ily
members3,11
and
must
be
ordered
by
attending
physicians. Staff and family requests often result from a
recognized need such as symptom management or assis-
tance with difficult treatment decisions. They also arise
when hospice is not feasible because Medicare skilled nurs-
ing facility (SNF) care is being received or life expectancy
is greater than 6 months. Unlike hospice, there is no
designated Medicare payment stream for palliative care
consultations; they are billed as NH visits under Medicare
Part B.
Palliative care consultations are consistently associated
with lower intensity of treatments and costs in hospitals
and with better quality of life and less aggressive care in
outpatient settings.12–16 In addition, earlier hospice or pal-
liative care enrollment is associated with greater reductions
in acute care use and better quality of care.13,15,17–19
No study has examined how specialty palliative care
consultations affect healthcare use of NH residents and
whether earlier receipt may be more effective. Therefore,
this study examined how consultations in NHs are associ-
ated with use of acute care service and burdensome transi-
tions14 near the end of life. Although it was not a main
outcome, Medicare expenditures near the end of life were
also examined to understand how observed benefits are
associated with Medicare costs.
METHODS
Study Data and Population
Given that there were no Medicare Part B payment codes
to identify palliative care consultations in the time period
studied, two palliative care provider organizations were
collaborated with to identify NH consultation recipients.
Both are long-standing providers of NH consultations and
are subsidiaries of hospices located in hospice certificate-
of-need states (North Carolina, Rhode Island); during the
study years, they were the exclusive providers of palliative
care consultations in the two counties in North Carolina
and the six in Rhode Island where study NHs were
located. After obtaining a data use agreement from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and
Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
waiver approvals, the two organizations shared NH con-
sultation data from 2005 to 2010. Data shared included
consultation recipient date of birth, Medicare (or insur-
ance) identification number, sex, dates of initial palliative
care consultations, and NH identifying information. The
Brown University institutional review board approved this
study.
Provider data were linked to Medicare enrollment and
Part A claims data and NH resident assessment Minimum
Data Set (MDS) data. The MDS is mandated for all Medi-
care- and Medicaid-certified NHs and includes comprehen-
sive demographic and clinical data. The enrollment file
contains data on Medicare eligibility, Medicare Advantage
enrollment, and date of death. Part A claims data provide
information
on
hospital,
SNF,
emergency
department
(ED), home health care, and hospice use. Information on
NH characteristics was taken from the Online Survey, Cer-
tification, and Reporting (OSCAR) database.
Nursing home residents who died in 2006 to 2010
with initial palliative care consultations within 180 days of
death who were Medicare eligible and not enrolled in
Medicare Advantage in the last year of life were identified.
(Claims data are not available for Medicare Advantage
enrollees; n = 653.) For each resident, a baseline MDS
dated before the initial palliative care consultation but by
no more than 180 days was identified. Two residents with
a hospice discharge on the date of first consultation, 10
with consultations on the date of death, and 133 with no
MDS data in the required time window were excluded.
The resulting palliative care consultation sample consisted
of 508 residents (77.8%) from 46 of the 53 NHs (86.8%).
Although examination of consultation after 2010 would
have been desirable, the MDS changed in October 2010,
and the new MDS is not comparable with the earlier ver-
sion and is missing important information, in particular,
variables indicating preference (do-not-resuscitate (DNR)
and do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders).
To control for potential differences and preferences of
NH residents with and without palliative care consulta-
tions, propensity score–matched controls were chosen.
Decedents eligible to serve as controls came from the same
NHs and time frames and were also Medicare-eligible with
no Medicare Advantage in the last year of life. They also
had to have had MDS assessments in time periods compa-
rable with consultation decedents’ baseline assessments. To
enable examination of the timing of palliative care and
congruent with previous similar research,13,15,16,18,19 the
treatment sample was first stratified into four treatment
groups according to days between the initial consultation
and death (≤7, 8–30, 31–60, 61–180). Variables for
propensity score model inclusion were identified through
previous related research.7,18,20–23 Using propensity score
matching with replacement, three matched controls each
were identified for 477 of the 508 consultation decedents
(93.9%), for a total 1,174 propensity-matched controls.
(See also On-line Supporting Information for additional
information on propensity score matching.)
Variables of Interest
Independent Variable—Palliative Care Consultation
and Its Timing
The treatment of interest was initial exposure to any spe-
cialty palliative care consultation in the last 6 months of
life; to examine timing (as discussed above), treatment
groups were created using days between the initial consul-
tation and death (≤7, 8–30, 31–60, 61–180). At both study
sites, a palliative care consultation visit primarily consists
of care from nurse practitioners under the supervision of
certified palliative care physicians. These nurse practition-
ers specialize in palliative care (do not provide primary
care) and have extensive palliative care training. At initial
visits at both sites, nurse practitioners typically review
diagnoses and prognoses and address symptom control
needs. To ensure treatment consistent with preferences,
they also review advance directives, if available, and

 discuss goals of care. Family meetings are a critical compo-
nent of many consultations. Although interdisciplinary pal-
liative
care
team
members
may
visit
residents
when
needed, such visits are not routine or integral to the care
model. Similar to other studies,12,15–17,24,25 hospice enroll-
ment (after initial consultation) was considered to be
within the treatment pathway.
Study Outcomes
Using Medicare claims, hospitalizations in the last 7, 30,
or 60 days of life and ED visits (without subsequent hos-
pitalizations) in the last 30 or 60 days of life were identi-
fied. The occurrence of any potentially burdensome end-
of-life care transition, was also identified because higher
rates of such transitions have been shown to be associ-
ated with markers of poor-quality NH care.14 A poten-
tially
burdensome
care
transition
was
defined
as
hospitalization or hospice admission within 3 days of
death or two or more hospitalizations or ED visits (with-
out subsequent hospitalizations) in the last 30 days of
life.
Although not a main outcome, total Medicare Part A
expenditures in postconsultation time periods (last 7, 30,
60 days of life) were examined. Expenditures were stan-
dardized to 2007 dollars.
Covariates for Propensity Score Matching and
Multivariate Models
Resident-level sociodemographic variables included age,
sex, marital status (married vs other), and race (nonwhite
vs white). According to the baseline MDS, preference vari-
ables included the presence or absence of DNR and DNH
orders. Other baseline variables were diagnoses of cancer
or dementia, functional and cognitive impairment, and
whether a NH stay was short or long (≥90 days). The
activity of daily living (ADL) scale was used to indicate
functional impairment (range 0–28, higher values indicat-
ing greater impairment). The Cognitive Performance Scale
(CPS) was used to determine cognitive impairment (range
0–6: intact to mild impairment (0–2), moderate to moder-
ately severe (3–4), severe to very severe (5–6)). A MDS
variable denoting unstable, deteriorating, or declining cog-
nitive or functional status was also included, as were vari-
ables to reflect number of days between baseline MDS and
death (categorized). Finally, previous acute care use was
controlled for—whether a resident had one hospitalization
or two or more hospitalizations in the 90 days before the
baseline MDS.
Using aggregated MDS data, continuous variables
reflecting a NH’s percentage of nonwhite residents and its
case mix severity (based on Medicare Resource Utilization
Groups)
were
created.
NH-level
variables
from
the
OSCAR database included chain affiliation, profit status,
and NH employment of any nurse practitioner or physi-
cian assistant (all yes/no), as well as proportion of resi-
dents with Medicaid or Medicare as primary payer. A
continuous variable was used to represent the distance
between NHs and the nearest hospital. Last, indicator
variables were included for state and year of resident’s
death.
Analyses
A logistic multivariate regression model of the likelihood
of a decedent having a palliative care consultation was
estimated for each treatment group and its potential con-
trols. K–nearest neighbor with caliper propensity score
matching with replacement was then used to choose the
three closest controls whose logit propensity score fell
within one-fifth of a standard deviation of the mean logit
propensity score for each consultation recipient. This
resulted in 477 consultation decedents and 1,174 controls.
There were 101 consultation decedents and 263 controls
in the 7 days or fewer group, 162 and 410 in the 8 to
30 days group, 84 and 212 in the 31 to 60 days group,
and 130 and 289 in the 61 to 180 days group. Covariate
balance was achieved by examining standardized differ-
ences.26,27
(See
Online
Supporting
Information
and
Tables S2–S5 for a full description of the propensity score
matching and model statistics.)
To evaluate the outcomes, any remaining potential
confounding28 was controlled for by using weighted multi-
variate logistic regression with the same variables used for
matching. The weights were normalized weights generated
using the propensity score matching process, and the Wald
chi-square test was used to assess fit of the weighted mod-
els. To evaluate Medicare expenditures given the skewed
nature of such data, generalized linear modeling with
gamma distribution and a log link function in Stata (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX) was used.
RESULTS
In the 46 study NHs, 10% of the 6,458 residents who died
between 2006 and 2010 had initial palliative care consulta-
tions in the last 180 days of life. Decedents who had consul-
tations were very different from unmatched decedents
without consultations (Tables 1 and 2), although no statisti-
cally significant differences remained after propensity score
matching, and mean standardized differences between resi-
dents with and without consultations after matching ranged
from 3.4 to 5.6, compared with 16.9 to 24.7 before match-
ing (On-line Supporting Information, Tables S2–S5).
Overall, 39% of the (weighted) study population was
male, and 5% was nonwhite. At baseline, 14% had severe
cognitive impairment, and the average ADL score was 19
(with 28 representing total impairment). Also at baseline,
69% of the study population had DNR and 8% had DNH
orders. Last, 55% were in North Carolina NHs and 46%
in Rhode Island NHs (data not shown).
In all treatment groups and for all outcomes, residents
with consultations had markedly lower adjusted rates of
end-of-life
hospitalizations
than
matched
controls
(Table 3). Furthermore, earlier admission to consultation
programs was associated with lower hospitalization rates
(Table 3). Residents with the earliest consultation expo-
sure (61–180 days) had adjusted hospitalization rates of
6.9% (95% CI = 5.5–8.4%) in the last 7 days of life and
15.4% (95% CI = 12.6–18.2%) in the last 30 days, com-
pared with adjusted rates of 13.1% (95% CI = 10.4–
15.7%) in the last 7 days of life and 22.6% (95%
CI = 18.6–26.6%) in the last 30 days for decedents with
consultations 31 to 60 days before death (Table 3).

JAGS
 The likelihood of having an ED visit in the last 30
and 60 days of life was lower for residents with palliative
care consultations in the 31- to 60- and 61- to 180-day
consultation groups, although the difference was statisti-
cally significant only for NH residents in the 31- to 60-day
consultation group (Table 3). Residents with initial consul-
tations 61 to 180 days before death had almost half the
adjusted rate of potentially burdensome transitions as did
matched controls, and this difference was statistically sig-
nificant (Table 3).
The adjusted mean total Medicare expenditures after
palliative care consultation start dates were similar for
those
with
and
without
palliative
care
consultations
(Table 4), although expenditures in the last 7 days of life
were significantly lower for residents with initial consulta-
tions in the last 30 and 61 to 180 days of life than for
controls.
For
residents
with
consultations
and
their
matched controls, Medicare hospice expenditures in the
last 7 and 30 days of life were greater the further the ini-
tial consultations were from death (Online Supporting
Information, Table S6).
DISCUSSION
This study provides the first empirical evidence of the
value of palliative care consultations provided in NHs. It
shows a robust association between NH resident receipt
of consultations and lower rates of end-of-life acute care
use and potentially burdensome care transitions. Rates
were also generally lower with earlier consultations and
lowest when initial consultations were 61 to 180 days
before death. Residents with consultations had adjusted
end-of-life hospitalization rates 4 to 16 absolute percent-
age points lower than those of matched controls, and
when initial consultations began 61 to 180 days before
death, the rate of potentially burdensome transitions was
12 absolute percentage points lower for residents with
consultations than for controls. Evaluation of Medicare
expenditures
also
showed
that
no
additional
cost
appeared to be associated with NH palliative care con-
sultations. Thus, this research suggests that specialty pal-
liative care consultations add value to NH care for
residents with advanced illness.

SPECIALTY PALLIATIVE CARE IN NURSING HOMES
2283
 Study findings are in agreement with those of previous
studies
of
palliative
care
consultations
in
other
set-
tings12,15,24 and with studies showing that earlier timing of
hospice or palliative care has greater effects on end-of-life
outcomes.13,15,16,18,19 They are also in agreement with
results of a study from a single NH in which receipt of
palliative care consultations was associated with lower ED
use.29
Specialty palliative care consultations are likely to
facilitate reductions in acute care use and potentially bur-
densome care transitions through two primary mecha-
nisms. First, it is likely that they provide (earlier) palliative
care exposure and symptom management for those who
do not desire or do not qualify for Medicare hospice, such
as residents receiving Medicare Part A SNF care. Second,
they facilitate and begin (earlier) conversations about prog-
noses and person-centered care preferences.24 Such conver-
sations
often
do
not
occur
in
NHs.30
Alternatively,
consultation referral could be a signal of a desire to change
goals of care to focus on quality of life or reflect recogni-
tion by clinicians that current care is nonbeneficial.
Nursing home residents with hospice have lower end-
of-life acute care use than those without;18,20 nonetheless,
they incur greater Medicare expenditures in their last year
of life, primarily because of long hospice stays.7,9 This
study provides evidence of an approach that could poten-
tially lead to timelier hospice enrollment by improving
specialty palliative care access to persons in NHs with
advanced serious illness, although this approach is not
financially feasible for most palliative care provider organi-
zations (often subsidiaries of hospices) because Medicare
Part B visit payments reportedly do not adequately cover
the personnel and administrative costs associated with spe-
cialty
palliative
care
consultations.3,6,10
Hospital-based
palliative care programs receive the same Medicare Part B
payment but nearly always offset the uncovered costs
through savings resulting from reductions in the intensity
of care.
Study findings support further consideration and study
of the benefits and costs of an enhanced Medicare Part B
visit payment for specialty palliative care consultations in
NHs. As in the current study NHs, nurse practitioners or
physician assistants with palliative care expertise could pri-
marily provide specialty palliative care consultations under
the supervision of a physician with palliative care training
and certification.31 This consultation policy would ensure
that providers have an adequate level of palliative care
proficiency while also resulting in greater availability of
specialty palliative care expertise in NHs.5,6 Although the
shortage of palliative care physician specialists is a con-
cern,32 there is a cadre of hospice providers capable of
providing these specialty consultations, and they may be
motivated to do so if higher payment for specialty pallia-
tive care visits were available.

 Although Medicare savings were not observed with
consultations (except in the last 7 days of life), accountable
care organizations may find cost savings when fee-for-ser-
vice incentives are eliminated for Medicare SNF care. Thus,
similar to the myriad of studies showing hospital cost sav-
ings when patients receive palliative care consultations,15–
17,24,25 providers accountable for care across settings may
experience savings. With the advent of NH readmission
penalties and as CMS begins its bundled care initiative and
tests an acute care hospital and (90-day) postacute care epi-
sode bundled payment, NHs, much like hospitals, may find
it financially beneficial to consider providing specialty pal-
liative care consultations to seriously ill residents.
A major strength of this study is the use of rigorous
methods. Propensity score matching and analysis were
according to strata representing time between initial con-
sultation and death. Matching corrected substantially for
imbalance between residents with and without consulta-
tions, and any residual confounding was controlled for in
multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, in addition to the
observational nature of this study, it is not possible to
comment on the decision-making regarding consultation
referral and factors associated with referral other than
those represented in the secondary data sources. Also, this
research had a retrospective cohort design, and important
concerns about bias with the use of a retrospective study
design have been noted.33 Propensity score matching and

Adjusted rates based on multivariate models controlling for the following
variables, unless otherwise noted: For residents: at baseline, age, marital

four-category dementia/cancer diagnoses, activity of daily living impair-
ment, cognitive impairment, stability of cognition and functioning, days
between baseline assessment and death, hospitalizations in the 90 days
before baseline assessment, and year of death. For nursing homes: percent
nonwhite, resident case mix, chain affiliation, profit status, employment of
any nurse practitioner or physician assistant, proportion of residents with
Medicare or Medicaid as primary payer, distance between nursing home
and nearest hospital, location of nursing home (Rhode Island or North
Carolina).
aModels did not include race, percentage nonwhite, and hospitalizations in
90 days before baseline assessment.
bDNR order was removed from the model because it predicted the out-
come perfectly.
cP-value does not perfectly coincide with the 95% confidence interval (CI)
because the CI was generated from the predicted probabilities, whereas
the P-value was taken from the palliative consultation estimate of the mul-
tivariate model.
dCognitive impairment was removed from the model because it predicted
the outcome perfectly.
eThe four-category dementia/cancer variable was removed from the model
because it predicted the outcome perfectly. Dichotomous measures of
dementia and cancer were added.
fTo achieve model fit, this model did not include race, percentage non-
white, profit status, or presence of a DNR order. It also replaced the four-
category dementia/cancer variable with a dichotomous measure of demen-
tia and cancer; collapsed categories of time from baseline assessment to
death, year of death, and cognitive status; and added a quadratic term for
distance from nursing home to the nearest hospital.

SPECIALTY PALLIATIVE CARE IN NURSING HOMES

 examination of outcomes only in the last 60 days of life
were used in an attempt to minimize this bias. In addition,
findings are not necessarily nationally generalizable given
that they focus on NHs in only two states. Still, mean and
median rates of hospital death and hospitalization in the
last 6 months of life in North Carolina and Rhode Island
are similar to national rates.34 Furthermore, although
research across additional states is desirable, the lack of
dedicated palliative care payment or Common Procedural
Terminology codes make widespread study challenging.
This study focused on evaluating the receipt of any pallia-
tive care consultation, and data were not available on the
“dose” of palliative care (number of visits). Nevertheless,
as discussed in Methods, at both study sites, initial consul-
tation visits are similar and include goals-of-care discus-
sions.
Finally,
given
data
limitations,
the
value
of
consultations beginning more than 6 months before death
was not evaluated and thus cannot be commented on.
In conclusion, specialty palliative care consultations,
especially those done earlier in the disease trajectory, appear
to offer a value-added approach to decreasing potentially
burdensome end-of-life transitions and acute care use for
NH residents. Findings suggest that Medicare and provider
policy supporting concurrent specialty palliative care con-
sultations in NHs may lead to reductions in costly and often
unsettling and discretionary hospital use—use that is likely
to undermine residents’ quality of life. Further study of this
model using practical clinical trials is recommended.
