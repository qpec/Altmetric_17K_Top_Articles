OBJECTIVES: Pregnant women routinely receive information in support of or opposing 
infant immunization. We aimed to describe immunization information sources of future 
mothers’ and determine if receiving immunization information is associated with infant 
immunization timeliness.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a child cohort born 2009–2010 in New Zealand. Pregnant 
women (N = 6822) at a median gestation of 39 weeks described sources of information 
encouraging or discouraging infant immunization. Immunizations received by cohort 
infants were determined through linkage with the National Immunization Register  
(n = 6682 of 6853 [98%]). Independent associations of immunization information received 
with immunization timeliness were described by using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Immunization information sources were described by 6182 of 6822 (91%) women. 
Of these, 2416 (39%) received information encouraging immunization, 846 (14%) received 
discouraging information, and 565 (9%) received both encouraging and discouraging 
information. Compared with infants of women who received no immunization information 
(71% immunized on-time), infants of women who received discouraging information only 
(57% immunized on time, OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.38–0.64) or encouraging and discouraging 
information (61% immunized on time, OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.42–0.63) were at decreased odds 
of receiving all immunizations on time. Receipt of encouraging information only was not 
associated with infant immunization timeliness (73% immunized on time, OR = 1.00,  
95% CI 0.87–1.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Receipt, during pregnancy, of information against immunization was associated 
with delayed infant immunization regardless of receipt of information supporting 
immunization. In contrast, receipt of encouraging information is not associated with infant 
immunization timeliness.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Future parents receive 
information about immunization from multiple sources. Some 
of this information encourages immunization, whereas some 
discourages immunization. It is unknown whether antenatal 
receipt of information about immunization is associated with the 
timeliness of infant immunization.
What this study adds: During pregnancy, health professionals 
are the main source of encouraging information about infant 
immunization, with family and friends being the main source of 
discouraging information. Receiving discouraging information 
increases the odds of delayed infant immunization. Encouraging 
information is not associated with immunization timeliness.

 Timely immunization is necessary 
for national immunization programs 
to provide full-population health 
benefit. Timeliness is particularly 
important for the primary infant 
immunization series. Delayed 
receipt of any of these vaccine 
doses increases the risk of hospital 
admission during infancy with 
vaccine-preventable disease.1, 
 
2
Most future parents make 
their decisions regarding the 
immunization of their infant before 
that child’s birth.3 
– 
5 Parental 
immunization decision-making 
is influenced by information they 
received, which comes from many 
sources, including family and friends, 
health care providers, and the 
media.6 The information received 
can either encourage or discourage 
infant immunization. The effect of 
this differing information on infant 
immunization timeliness is unknown. 
In particular, it is unknown whether 
receiving encouraging information 
increases or receiving discouraging 
information decreases the likelihood 
of timely immunization.
Our objectives were to describe 
the sources of encouraging and 
discouraging information about 
immunization that are received 
by pregnant women and to 
determine if receipt of such 
information is associated with the 
timeliness of infant immunization. 
We hypothesized that receipt of 
encouraging information would 
be associated with more timely 
immunization and that receipt of 
discouraging information would 
be associated with less timely 
immunization.
Methods
study design and setting
We completed this project within 
New Zealand’s (NZ) child cohort 
study, Growing Up in New Zealand 
(www. 
growingup. 
co. 
nz). This 
prospective cohort was established 
by recruiting pregnant women 
with an estimated delivery date 
between April 25, 2009, and March 
25, 2010, who were residents in a 
geographically defined region of New 
Zealand chosen for its population 
diversity.7 There were no exclusion 
criteria. Eleven percent of all children 
born in NZ during the recruitment 
period were enrolled. The enrolled 
cohort is generalizable to all births 
in NZ from 2007 to 2010.8 The 
Growing Up in New Zealand cohort 
was designed to have adequate 
explanatory power to undertake 
complex longitudinal analyses, 
both across the whole cohort and 
within ethnic and socioeconomic 
subgroups.7 Ethical approval was 
from the NZ Ministry of Health Ethics 
Committee. All enrolled women 
provided written, informed consent. 
They were informed at enrollment 
that their enrolled children would 
be followed in the study at least until 
they were 18 years old.
study Population and sample
Growing Up in New Zealand recruited 
6822 women and their 6853 
children.7 For the present analysis, 
we limited the sample to the 6182 
(91%) women who were enrolled 
antenatally and their 6205 (91%) 
children. For the 168 multiple births 
in the cohort, we only included the 
first-born child in these analyses. 
For all but 3 sets of twins or 
triplets, immunization coverage and 
timeliness were identical between 
twin or triplet siblings.
data collection
Each participant completed a 
computer-assisted, face-to-face 
enrollment interview. This interview 
was completed at a median gestation 
of 39 (interquartile range of 38–40) 
weeks, with 345 (6%) of the women 
interviewed before 37 weeks 
gestation.7
Each woman was asked if she 
had decided yet if she would have 
her child immunized (published 
previously).9 We then asked if 
she had received any information 
encouraging her or discouraging 
her to immunize her child during 
infancy (Fig 1). For both encouraging 
and discouraging information, each 
woman identified all sources of 
the immunization information. We 
provided response options that 
included general information sources 
and those specific to pregnancy. The 
response options offered were as 
follows: family, friends, the family 
doctor, midwife, obstetrician, 
dietician or nutritionist, alternative 
health care practitioner, antenatal 
class, the Internet, radio, television, 
printed media, or other sources 
(Fig 1). In NZ, pregnant women 
choose between one of several 
types of pregnancy health care 
providers, including a family doctor 
(general practitioner), midwife, 
or obstetrician; the majority of 
women have a midwife as their main 
pregnancy health care provider.10 
Antenatal class attendance is 
encouraged but not mandatory.
Each infant’s immunization 
information was obtained from the 
National Immunization Register 
(NIR).11 We established linkage by 
using the National Health Index 
number, which is a unique identifier 
assigned to every person having 
contact with health care services 
in NZ. Consent for NIR linkage 
was obtained for 6682 (98%) of 
the enrolled infants, with linkage 
established (ie, an infant’s National 
Health Index number identified in the 
NIR) for 6674 (97%).
Measurements
When the children in the cohort 
were infants, the NZ immunization 
schedule included 6-week, 3-month, 
and 5-month doses of the following 2 
vaccines: 1 with diphtheria-tetanus-
acellular pertussis, Haemophilus 
influenzae type B, hepatitis B, 
and poliovirus antigens; and the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.12

We used the following 3 measures 
of immunization timeliness: (1) all 
immunizations received on time as 
the primary outcome, (2) the first 
set of immunizations (2 vaccines) 
was received on time, and (3) no 
immunizations were received on 
time. Timely receipt of the first set of 
immunizations was included as 1 of 
the measures of timeliness because 
of its strong association with delay in 
subsequent immunizations.16
Maternal socioeconomic status 
and education were described by 
using measures from Statistics NZ’s 
2006 national census and 2008 
General Social Survey.17, 
 
18 Area-
level socioeconomic deprivation 
was measured by using the 2006 
NZ Index of Deprivation grouped as 
quintiles.19 The 2006 NZ Index of 
Deprivation, which is derived from 
2006 census data on 9 socioeconomic 
characteristics, is a well-validated, 
small-area measure of socioeconomic 
deprivation in NZ.19
For analysis purposes, the 
immunization information sources 
were combined into the following 
3 groups: family and friends, health 
care, and media.
data analysis
We described the proportion of 
women receiving encouraging  
and/or discouraging information about 
immunization from all sources. We 
described associations of maternal 
and household demographics, which 
are known to be associated with 
immunization timeliness, 
14 with 
receipt of only encouraging, both 
encouraging and discouraging, or 
only discouraging information. We 
grouped all health care providers into 
1 category because in NZ, child health 
care is sought from a wide variety 
of care providers, and families seek 
care from alternative health care 
providers as an adjunct rather than 
an alternative to conventional health 
care.20 By using multivariable logistic 
regression, we examined associations 
with immunization timeliness of 
receiving only encouraging, both 
encouraging and discouraging, or 
only discouraging information. 
These analyses were reported by 
using adjusted odds ratios (OR), 
95% confidence intervals (CIs), 
and by using SAS version 9.2 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). A 2-sided P value 
of <.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Results
Receipt of immunization information 
during Pregnancy
Receipt of encouraging or 
discouraging information was 
reported by 6158 (99%) of the 
women interviewed, with 1846 
(30%) receiving only encouraging 
information, 565 (10%) receiving 
both encouraging and discouraging 
information, 280 (4%) receiving 
only discouraging information, and 
3467 (56%) recalled receiving no 
information about immunization  
(Fig 2).
Pregnant Women’s sources of infant 
immunization information
Two or more encouraging 
information sources were identified 
by 1158 of the 2411 (48%) 
women who received encouraging 
information and ≥2 discouraging 
information sources were identified 
by 336 of the 845 (40%) women who 
received discouraging information.
Of the 6158 women interviewed, 
immunization information was 
received from family and friends by 
872 (14%), health care providers by 
2174 (35%), media by 835 (14%), 
and other sources by 119 (2%)  
(Fig 3). Most who identified health 
care providers as an information 
source (90%) received only 
encouraging information. In contrast, 
39% of those identifying family 
and friends as an information 
source received only encouraging 
information, and 53% of those 
identifying media sources received 
only encouraging information (Fig 3).
Immunization information received 
was encouraging only for a larger 
proportion of those who received 
this from family (68%) compared

 with friends (42%) (Table 1). 
Whereas almost all immunization 
information from the family 
doctor (98%), midwife (94%), or 
obstetrician (97%) was encouraging 
only, this was not the case for 
the smaller numbers of pregnant 
women who received immunization 
information from a dietician or 
nutritionist (40% encouraging only) 
or alternative health care provider 
(18% encouraging only) (Table 1). 
Maternal ethnicity, parity, education, 
household deprivation, and whether 
a woman was decided about 
immunizing her expected child were 
each independently associated with 
the type of immunization information 
received (Table 2).
Maternal Receipt of immunization 
information and infant immunization 
timeliness
In comparison with the infants 
of women who received no 
immunization information while 
pregnant, the infants of women who 
received discouraging information 
only were at decreased odds  
of having all immunizations  
(OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.38–0.64) or 
their 6-week dose (OR = 0.39, 95% 
CI 0.29–0.53) on time and at increased 
odds of all of their immunizations 
being delayed (OR = 2.61, 95% 
CI 1.87–3.59) (Figs 4– 
6). The 
following associations of the receipt 
of discouraging information with 
all 3 measures of immunization 
timeliness were of similar magnitude 
if encouraging information had also 
been received: the odds of receiving 
all immunizations (OR = 0.51, 95%  
CI 0.42–0.63) or 6-week 
immunizations (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 
0.35–0.58) on time; and the odds 
of all immunizations being delayed 
(OR = 2.70, 95% CI 2.08–3.50) 
(Figs 4– 
6). Receipt of discouraging 
information from any of the 3 specific 
sources (family and friends, health 
care, or media), either alone or with 
encouraging information, was also 
associated with decreased odds of 
receiving all infant immunizations 
(Fig 4) or the 6-week immunizations 
(Fig 5) on time and increased odds 
of all immunizations being delayed 
(Fig 6). In comparison with the 
infants of women who received no 
immunization information, receipt 
of encouraging information from any 
source was not associated with any 
of the infant immunization timeliness 
measures. This was also the case for 
encouraging information received 
from family and friends, health care 
or media sources (Figs 4– 
6).

 information, and 4% received 
only discouraging information. 
Recall of receipt of discouraging 
information was associated 
with an increased likelihood of 
delayed infant immunization, 
as was both encouraging and 
discouraging information. There 
was no association between recall of 
receiving encouraging information 
and immunization timeliness. 
Health care providers were the most 
common source of immunization 
information (35%), and 90% of 
women received only encouraging 
information from health care sources. 
Sixty-three percent of the women 
in our study cited midwives as a 
source of immunization information, 
reflecting NZ’s predominantly 
midwife-led model of maternity 
care, where ∼80% of women select 
a midwife as their pregnancy health 
care provider.10
This is the largest study to 
date in which researchers have 
examined maternal receipt of infant 
immunization information during 
pregnancy. The results are consistent 
with those of smaller studies. A US 
study found that 124 of 200 (62%) 
of expectant first-time mothers 
sought immunization information 
during the previous month of their 
pregnancy, with 73 (37%) of them 
receiving this information from their 
obstetrician or midwife.6 Unlike 
our study, this study had multiple 
exclusion criteria, including women 
who were younger than 18 years old, 
had multiple births, less than a high 
school education, poor English skills, 
no computer or mobile access, or 
had already decided not to immunize 
their infants. A Japanese study found 
that during an antenatal clinic visit, 
only 14 of 70 (20%) pregnant women 
discussed infant immunization with a 
health care professional.21
Health care professionals 
(particularly doctors, midwives, and 
nurses) are a common and trusted 
source of infant immunization 
information.6, 
 
21 
– 
26 However, we 
found no association between the 
receipt of encouraging information 
from health care sources and 
immunization timeliness, which is 
consistent with a 2013 Cochrane 
review that concluded that antenatal 
face-to-face immunization education 
interventions had little or no effect  
on immunization status.27 More 
recently, researchers found that 
timely infant immunization was 
more likely if the mother received 
one-on-one antenatal immunization 
education.28, 
29 It will be important 
to determine if specifically 
immunization-focused education is 
sufficient to overcome the effect of any 
discouraging information received.
The relationship we observed 
between the receipt of discouraging 
information and delayed infant 
immunization is consistent with a 
previous NZ study, demonstrating 
that fewer children received 
timely immunizations in primary 
care practices where caregivers 
reported receiving information 
that discouraged immunization.30 
However, this was a retrospective 
study, and therefore, it could not 
determine if caregivers received 
information before or after the 
children’s immunization. It is

 concerning that 18% of women 
who recalled receiving discouraging 
information identified health 
care providers as a source of this 
information because health care 
providers have a professional 
responsibility to promote 
immunization.
A novel finding from our study is 
that delayed infant immunizations 
are associated with the mother 
receiving both encouraging and 
discouraging immunization 
information during pregnancy. 
The ambiguity created by 
receiving both encouraging and 
discouraging information may be 
a key factor leading to parental 
vaccine hesitancy.31 Health care 
providers are likely to remain the 
main source of information that 
encourages infant immunization 
once the child is born. We suggest it 
may be necessary to identify those 
parents who have already received 
information that discourages them 
from immunizing their infants and 
develop immunization promotion 
strategies specific to this group.
Although we cannot prevent the 
exposure of pregnant women 
to information discouraging 
immunization, we can improve 
the delivery and investigate the 
effectiveness of interventions 
encouraging infant immunization. 
For information provided about 
immunization to be effective, it 
is important to determine the 
informational needs of the target 
population because these may vary 
between countries and by maternal 
demographics, such as parity or 
ethnicity. In the United States, 
for example, white and Hispanic 
parents were more likely than 
African-American parents to trust 
family and friends for vaccine-safety 
information.25

 Recent results from the Growing Up 
in New Zealand study indicate that 
first-time expectant mothers are 
more likely to be undecided about 
immunization than women who 
already had children.9 We observed 
that although women expecting 
their first child were more likely to 
receive information about infant 
immunization, approximately half 
(1301 of 2571; 51%) had not. There 
is a clear need to provide expectant 
first-time mothers with appropriate 
information during pregnancy to 
enable them to make informed 
decisions about their infants’ 
immunization.
This study has several strengths. 
It was completed within a large 
and nationally generalizable 
cohort7 by using an immunization 
registry to describe immunization 
timeliness.32 Our study context 
was broad, with immunization 
being only 1 of a wide range of 
research domains considered.7 
Hence, there is less likelihood 
that participants would over- or 
underreport their immunization 
information sources than would 
be the case in an immunization-
focused study. We only included 
women recruited antenatally, and 
only 345 (6%) were interviewed 
preterm. Thus, we believe we 
captured the majority of time 
during which pregnant women 
could have received immunization 
information. It is possible that 
women received some of the 
information they described before 
their pregnancy. However, because 
women in NZ identify a specific 
health care provider for their 
pregnancy, and our questions about 
immunization information asked 
women to identify these pregnancy-
specific sources, we were able to 
create a pregnancy focus for our 
data collection.
The broad study scope limited our 
ability to investigate information 
sources in detail. We were not 
able to gather information on the

 specific sources used (eg, Web sites 
and social media), investigate the 
content of the encouraging versus 
discouraging messages, or quantify 
the exposure to different information 
types. Our observational study 
cannot establish whether exposure 
to discouraging information caused 
a delay in the receipt of infant 
immunizations. It is possible that 
women who had negative views 
about immunization actively sought 
discouraging information. People 
are more likely to remember 
information that is in line with their 
own opinions about an issue, and 
hence, this may have biased our 
estimates of what proportion of 
women received encouraging  
or discouraging information.33 
Because of the specifics of the NZ 
health care system, particularly 
with regard to antenatal care, the 
results of our study may not be 
generalizable to other health care 
contexts.
conclusions
During pregnancy, women who 
recalled receiving information 
discouraging immunization had 
an increased likelihood of delayed 
infant immunization regardless of 
whether they reported receiving 
encouraging information about 
immunization. In contrast, the 
receipt of encouraging information 
was not associated with infant 
immunization timeliness. 
Researchers in future studies 
should explore the content of the 
discouraging information and 
help develop counterarguments to 
offset what appears to be impactful 
information. Researchers in future 
studies might also investigate the 
quality of the information that 
encourages parents to immunize 
their future children and how best 
to promote the key child health 
messages that will enable timely 
infant immunization.
