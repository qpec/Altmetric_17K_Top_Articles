An accurate urine test for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), affecting 9.6 million patients worldwide, is critically needed for
surveillance and treatment management. Past attempts failed to reliably detect the mycobacterial glycan antigen
lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a marker of active TB, in HIV-negative, pulmonary TB–infected patients’ urine (85% of
9.6 million patients). We apply a copper complex dye within a hydrogel nanocage that captures LAM with very
high affinity, displacing interfering urine proteins. The technology was applied to study pretreatment urine from 48
Peruvian patients, all negative for HIV, with microbiologically confirmed active pulmonary TB. LAM was quantitatively
measured in the urine witha sensitivity of >95%and a specificity of >80%(n = 101) ina concentration range of 14 to2000
picograms per milliliter, as compared to non-TB, healthy and diseased, age-matched controls (evaluated by receiver
operating characteristic analysis; area under the curve, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.9005 to 0.9957). Urinary LAM
was elevated in patients with a higher mycobacterial burden (n = 42), a higher proportion of weight loss (n = 37),
orcough (n = 50). The technology canbe configured in avarietyofformats to detecta panel of previouslyundetectable
very-low-abundance TB urinary analytes. Eight of nine patients who were smear-negative and culture-positive for TB
tested positive for urinary LAM. This technology has broad implications for pulmonary TB screening, transmission
control, and treatment management for HIV-negative patients.
INTRODUCTION
An accurate screening test for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is
urgently needed for patients who are not coinfected with HIV (1, 2).
Worldwide, TB is one of the most prevalent bacterial infections
(9.6millioncasesand1.5milliondeathsin2014),withthehighestmortality
in developing countries (1). Ideally, such a test would use a noninvasive
body fluid such as urine to facilitate utilization in a low-resource setting
(1, 2). This objective, at first, appears straightforward because the outer
surface glycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a TB antigen shed into the
urine during active TB, has been identified and well characterized (3, 4).
Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lateral flow tests
have been developed to measure LAM, their sensitivity is limited (4).
These tests can detect urinary LAM in patients with pulmonary TB
whoarecoinfectedwithHIV(5,6)butnotinthosewhoareHIV-negative
(5, 6). Quantitative gas chromatography–mass spectrometry has been
used to identify D-arabinose as a proxy for LAM in TB patients ir-
respective of HIV status, but the sensitivity is limited to 10 to 40 ng/ml
(7). Unfortunately, the failure to detect LAM in the urine of HIV-negative
patients limits the applicability of these assays, because most of the TB
patientsareHIV-negative(85%ofthe9.6millionpatientsworldwide)(1).
The poor sensitivity of existing LAM assays in HIV-negative/
TB-positivepatientshasbeenexplainedbythreemainhypotheses.Thefirst
hypothesis is that LAM is shed into the urine of active pulmonary TB
patients only in the context of glomerular dysfunction caused by HIV
infection including HIV-related nephropathy (HIVAN) (8, 9). However,
in HIVAN, urinary LAM is not associated with heavy proteinuria, suggest-
ing that this is not an important mechanism (9). The second hypothesis is
that LAM is shed into the urine of patients with active TB only when there
is extrapulmonary renal tract involvement, such that the antigen can enter
the urine directly from infected tissue (10). The third hypothesis is that the
concentration of LAM in patients with active pulmonary TB is below the
concentration detection limits of existing assays and may be masked by
formation of immune complexes, excess non-LAM proteins, or otherinhibitors
present in the urine (7). Here, we apply a new class of analytical nanocage
technology to definitively address these hypotheses and solve this dilemma.
The ideal urine test would measure a variety of pathogen and host
analytes (2) to achieve the highest specificity and accuracy at all phases
of TB. Therefore, we explored whether the nanocage technology could
be extended to other characterized analytes associated with TB and the
host response andto otherimmunoassay formatsusefulin low-resource
settings. We introduce here new high-affinity chemical dye baits that
bind the following well-characterized TB antigens and inflammatory
markers: (i) LAM, (ii) early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT6) (11),
(iii)culturefiltrateprotein10(CFP10)(11),and(iv)inflammatorycytokines
nonspecifically associated with an active infection including interleukin-2
(IL-2), interferon-g (IFN-g), and tumor necrosis factor–a (TNFa) (12).
For ESAT6, we examined the versatility of the cage nanotechnology as a
new class of sandwich immunoassay using the chemical bait as one side
of the sandwich.
RESULTS
A recognized barrier to glycosciences and to the use of glycans as diag-
nostic biomarkers is the scarcity and suboptimal quality of available
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against complex carbohydrates
such as LAM (13). To address this problem, we introduce here a new

 class of chemical affinity bait, a copper complex reactive dye, Reactive
Blue 221 {RB221; cuprate(4-),[2-[[[[3-[[4-chloro-6-[ethyl[4-[[2-
(sulfooxy)ethyl]sulfonyl]phenyl]amino]-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]-2-
hydroxy-5-sulfophenyl]azo]phenylmethyl]azo]-4-sulfobenzoato(6-)]-,
tetrahydrogen} (Fig. 1). RB221 binds and sequesters carbohydrate gly-
can LAM antigen with extremely high affinity (fig. S1) that is at least 100
times greater than any known lectin (fig. S2 and table S1). RB221 is im-
mobilized in open-mesh hydrogel nanoparticle cages. When introduced
into urine, the nanocages harvest LAM with high efficiency within
minutes while simultaneously dissociating interfering substances in so-
lution (fig. S3). Our affinity capture nanotechnology increases the sen-
sitivity of LAM detection in urine by 100- to 1000-fold depending on
the available volume of urine (Fig. 1, A and B) (14–18).
We applied this technology to study the concentration of LAM in
the pretreatment urine of 48 HIV-negative patients with micro-
biologically confirmed active pulmonary TB from a Peruvian hospital
(Tables 1 and 2). All patients were confirmed to have normal kidney
function by in-hospital assessment including creatinine measurement
and urinalysis. To determine whether urinary LAM concentrations re-
flect body disease burden, we compared the urine LAM concentrations
with sputum TB organism counts, cough frequency, appetite, and
change in body weight (19) in this cohort (Table 2) of well-characterized
hospitalized patients using the widely accepted simplified nutritional
appetite questionnaire (SNAQ) scoring system (20). Controls included
age-matched healthy volunteers and diseased non-TB control patients
who were hospitalized and ill with a variety of severe systemic, pulmonary,
neurologic, and genitourinary tract diseases (table S2).
Copper complex dyes: High-yield LAM sequestration
from urine
The carbohydrate structure of LAM(Fig. 1) (3)poses unsolvedchallenges
in terms of identifying adequate probes for affinity isolation in urine in
the presence of a vast excess of interfering urinary proteins and other
biomolecules(7,21,22).Forthisstudy,37differentdyechemistries(tableS1)
were screened to identify a molecular bait that would sequester LAM
from urine with high affinity, deplete the supernatant, dissociate
LAM-binding proteins, and permit a high-yield quantitative recovery
(Fig. 1, C and D, and fig. S1). The dye chemistry panel was selected
by inference from dyes known to be useful for tissue histology mucin
staining or fluorescent staining of microorganisms. Western blot analysis
was conducted to screen dyes for their affinity to LAM. Two mAbs were
tested and yielded highly specific bands for LAM with no detectable
background in urine matrix (fig. S4). The specificity of the mAb clone
CS-35wasverified by antigencompetition (fig. S5)(23). Dyescontaining
copper moieties for histologic staining are known to preferentially interact
with glycans. Here, nanocages that were covalently functionalized with
copper-containing dyes (Alcian blue pyridine variant and RB221)
provedtobesuperiortootheraffinityprobes,suchasfluorescentbrightener
28 (FB28), fast blue B, and safranin O (Fig. 1C and figs. S1, S2, and S6).
Figure 1D documents the full depletion of LAM (100 ng/ml) spiked in
human urine using the RB221 nanocages (Fig. 1D, lane S). Binding was
independent of the pH of solution in the range 5 to 7 (fig. S7). The mo-
lecularweightofthebandbyWesternblotanalysisandcarbohydratestain-
ing is the expected full size of LAM (~38,000) with no lower–molecular
weight bands. After nanocage capture and elution, no differences were
detected in the quantity, shape, or intensity of the LAM band captured
in urine matrix as compared to LAM captured in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (Fig. 1D). Because PBS did not contain interfering sub-
stances, this verifies that the LAM was sequestered away from potential
interfering urinary molecules including proteins, lipids, glycans, and
cellular debris that could interfere with sequestration. On the basis of
the intensity of the band compared to standards, the complete depletion
of the supernatant at equilibrium, the yield and efficiency of capture and
elution is greater than 95%. In human urine, on the basis of the bound
versus free LAM at equilibrium, the capture affinity considerably ex-
ceeds Kd (dissociation constant) = 10−9 M (fig. S1).

 fig. S8), documenting the involvement of the copper moiety in the
binding function. To further characterize the copper complex dye
RB221 binding to the glycan, we used sodium m-periodate (NaIO4)
oxidative degradation. As demonstrated by solid-phase immunoassay
(fig. S9), NaIO4 at low concentrations and low pH extracted LAM
from the RB221 cages, verifyingthat intactLAMdiolbonds are required
for RB221 binding (fig. S9).
Nanocage-based measurement of LAM in the pretreatment
urine of patients with active pulmonary TB
Quantitation of LAM in human urine was performed after nanocage
capture and elution using an immunomacroarray assay (24). The con-
centration of LAM in the reference calibrator was qualified by the
anthrone colorimetric method in the linear portion of the assay
(0.16 mg/ml; fig. S10). The concentration factor was 100-fold (Fig. 1).
The immunomacroarray assay limits of detection and quantifications
for 1 ml of input urine were 14 and 15 pg/ml, respectively [background
estimate,547.32arbitraryunits(AU);SD,22.6AU;lowerlimitofdetection
(LLD) = background + 2 * SD; and lower limit of quantification (LLQ) =
background + 10 × SD; the polynomial equation y = 8 × 10−9x2 − 3 ×
10−6x + 0.0126 (R2 = 0.9985) was used to estimate LAM concentration
(Fig. 2B)]. Unknowns were tested in an array with built-in negative
controls and standards (Fig. 2). All samples and controls were iden-
tically processed through the nanocages.
Verification of the assay format
A test set of 23 TB-positive patients and a verification set were analyzed
(total n = 48 independent infected patient samples; Tables 1 and 2). The
mean and SD of urinary LAM concentration in the test and verification
sets were 700 ± 500 pg/ml and 410 ± 400 pg/ml, respectively. The two
sets were statistically indistinguishable (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P =
0.07, n = 72). The patients were called positive if the LAM signal was
2 SD higher than the full process negative controls run simultaneously.
LAM could not be measured in any of the TB-infected patient’s pre-
treatment urine without the nanocage concentration step.
Urinary LAM: HIV-negative active TB-positive pretreatment
patients discriminated from healthy and diseased controls
A total of 101 subjects qualified for the study (n = 48 microbiologically
confirmed TB-positive patients, n = 14 diseased TB-negative patients,
and n = 39 healthy volunteers). Informed consent was collected at the
time of urine donation. The median age of the microbiologically con-
firmed TB patient was 29 years (interquartile range, 24 to 36), and 72%
were males. The most commonly reported symptoms were cough
(76%) and fever (64%). Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data
are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Completed urine dipstick analysis was
recorded (table S3). The full data results obtained with the immunomac-
roarray analysis described above are shown in Fig. 2D. For the true-
positive patients (n = 48), only 2 had undetectable LAM concentrations
according to the criteria stated above. The controls included age-
matched healthy subjects and diseased non-TB patients who were ill
with a variety of severe systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract diseases.
The diseases included pneumonia, lung cancer, pyelonephritis, genito-
urinary infection, sepsis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, colon cancer with
gastroenteritis, and liver failure (table S2).

 Thedifference in LAMconcentration betweenthe casesandcontrols
was highly significant [P < 1 × 10−15, n = 101, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test; difference in location estimate, −247.318; 95% confidence interval
(CI), −351.3 to 200.8; Fig. 3]. As shown in Fig. 3B, a significantly higher
concentration of LAM was measured in the urine of patients who had
a higher score for sputum organism content (auramine score, P < 0.043,
n = 42, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; difference in location estimate,
−205.3; 95% CI, −452.0 to 5.1).
Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis, andthe areaunderthecurve wascalculated
tobe0.95(95%CI,0.9005to0.9957;fig.S11)asanoverallROCperformance
[n = 48 cases, n = 53 controls; significance level, 0.05; power, 1 (25)]. At a
threshold of 14 pg/ml, this ROC analysis yielded a sensitivity of 0.96 and a
specificity of 0.81 for true-positive pulmonary TB patients in the present
study set (positive predictive value, 0.82; negative predicted value, 0.95;
power, 0.96) (Fig. 3C). By these criteria, the single false-positive urine in
the diseasedcontrolswas patient #234, whose urinalysis had +++ leukocyte
esterase, +++ protein, +++ blood, and + bilirubin (table S3). These urinal-
ysis values would meet the exclusion criteria for clinical urine diagnostic
testing. Notably, eight of the nine culture-positive but smear-negative pa-
tients were positive for urinary LAM.
Correlation of urinary LAM with
clinical measures of disease burden
and severity
Simple and multiple linear regression of
covariates in Table 3 revealed that cough
and appetite scoring compared to LAM
urine concentrations were not individual-
ly significant by simple linear regression.
However, when taken together, these two
clinical measures were of significance and
predictive of LAM urine concentrations
(Table 3). Participants who reported a
cough were likely to have an increased se-
cretion of 269 pg/ml (10 to 528 pg/ml) of
LAM (P = 0.042, n = 50). For appetite
data, for each unit increase in SNAQ
score (Table 4) (20), an increase of 54.1
pg/ml (4.76 to 103 pg/ml) of LAM was ob-
served (P = 0.032, n = 37).
Exploration of LAM as an ordinal var-
iable revealed that the highest producers
of LAM were those who had experienced
the greatest change (loss) in body mass as
aproportionoftheirbaselinemass(Fig.3D).
When patients were grouped into low-level
LAM producers (115 pg/ml), mid-level
LAM producers (115 to 320 pg/ml), and
high-level LAM producers (320 pg/ml),
high-level LAM producers lost, on aver-
age, 17% of their body mass as compared
to patients in the low- and mid-level LAM-
producinggroupwholost8and9%oftheir
body masses, respectively. Ordinal regres-
sion revealed a significant correlation of
percent weight loss and LAM categoriza-
tion (P = 0.038, n = 37; Table 5). This in-
dicates that loss of weight in patients with
high urinary LAM was consistent with a
cachexia-like state characteristic of patients
with advanced TB infection (19). These
data are in keeping with the conclusion
that the concentration of urinary LAM is a
reflection of total mycobacterial body bur-
den [auramine score (26)] and disease se-
verity [cough and weight loss (19, 20)] in
patients with active pulmonary TB who
are HIV-negative.

 Extending the technology to other TB antigen markers and
host-associated cytokines
Beyond LAM, additional low-abundance mycobacterial antigens that
promise to offer important future diagnostic utility if they can be de-
tected with adequate sensitivity in the complex matrix of urine have
been characterized. We searched for bait chemistries that exhibited a
high affinity for additional TB antigens (Fig. 4) such as ESAT6 and
CFP10, which are secreted by replicating bacteria in addition to LAM
shedding (11) during infection. We also explored bait chemistries for
host immune response factors that, although not specific for TB diag-
nosis, may be involved in the cytokine cascade of TB infection [IL-2,
TNFa, and IFN-g (27)]. Results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that nanocages
completely captured the target analytes, depleted the supernatant, and
increased the effective concentration in the Western blot analysis. There
was no cross-reactivity of the antibodies with the negative control
human urine in the absence of target analytes. The analysis of urine
samples from four untreated TB patients from the Peruvian cohort
revealed that ESAT6 is detectable by Western blot analysis only when
nanocages are used as a preprocessing step (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Materials and Methods). The four patients analyzed were characterized
by microscopic observation broth-drug culture and susceptibility
(MODS) TB culture (four of four are positive) and sputum smear (three
of four are positive) (28). These data document that the nanocage tech-
nology is not limited to the LAM antigen and can be extended to other
TB-related antigens to expand the detection panel and increase the
accuracy of TB diagnosis.
Nanocages can be magnetized
Magnetization permits the creation of a urine collection device that
achieves rapid separation of the particles from the urine in a self-
contained vessel. To meet this goal, we incorporated a magnetic label
(Fe3O4 functionalized with oleic acid; diameter, 100 nm) into the hy-
drogels (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Materials and Methods). As shown
in Fig. 5B, magnetic separation is as efficient as centrifugation, if not
superior, in separating the particles from urine and enabling the detec-
tion of ESAT6 and CFP10 at concentrations otherwise undetectable by
Western blot analysis.
Obviating the need for elution: Nanocages partially dissolve
to display the captured analyte
The effective pore size of the particles is a function of hydrogel polymer
cross-links. Rendering the cross-links degradable provides a means to in-
duce the nanocages to open and display the captured sequestered analyte
(TB antigen) cargo. Partially degradable nanocages were created by
incorporating a cleavable cross-linker (N,N′-(1,2-dihydroxyethylene)
bisacrylamide) under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 6, A to C, and Supplemen-

containing the antigen of interest, and the solution-phase antigen was
captured within the particles. The degradable cross-links were then cleaved,
causing an effective increase in pore size and exposing the captured antigens
in the internal volume. Antibodies were used to probe the exposed captured
antigen directly within the cages for LAM (fig. S12) and ESAT6 (Fig. 6D).

Partially degradable nanocages: Lateral flow immunoassay
Degradable cages were successfully integrated in a lateral flow im-
munoassay (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Materials and Methods).
A stripe of anti-ESAT6 antibody was printed on a glass fiber filter
membrane. Nanocages were incubated with ESAT6-containing hu-
man urine, oxidized with NaIO4, and deposited on the glass fiber
membrane. Cages migrated with a laminar flow and homogeneous
front and were retained by the printed antibody, as shown in Fig. 6I.
This class of cages permits nonelution immune-based detection of
captured analytes directly sequestered and highly concentrated
inside the cages (Fig. 6). The workflow is greatly simplified because
the need for elution is obviated.
DISCUSSION
Shedding of urinary LAM in patients with active TB does not
require HIV coinfection
This study indicates that it is possible to detect urinary LAM during
active pulmonary TB, that detection does not require physiologic or im-
munologic consequences of HIV infection (8, 9), and that detection is
not limited to patients with TB colonization of the kidney (10). Instead,
as others have suspected (7, 29), the LAM antigen concentration in
HIV-negative patients is below the level of sensitivity of previous immu-
noassays, and the urinary LAM may be obscured by interfering LAM-
binding substances in the urine protein matrix (7). The high-affinity
copper dye bait for LAM introduced in this study effectively sequesters
LAM away from any potential urine-binding protein and concentrates
the LAM by a large factor, depending on the input volume of the urine
and the output total volume of the nanocages. At the same time, un-
wanted abundant urinary proteins are excluded. By comparison to pub-
lished studies of LAM in the urine of HIV-positive, TB-coinfected
patients (5, 6), these data indicate that the concentration of LAM in
the urine in active pulmonary TB, HIV-negative patients is 10- to 20-
fold lower. This is in keeping with a greater than 10-fold lower total
body burden of the TB pathogen in HIV-negative/TB-positive patients
as assessed by polymerase chain reaction (30). HIV infection is known
to increase the total body burden of the coinfecting pathogen (30),
resulting in a higher number of organisms shedding their antigens into
the urine.
Urinary LAM shedding correlates with TB infection burden
and severity
Concentrations of LAM in the pretreatment urine of infected patients
were higher in patients with an increased body burden of infection as
measured by TB organism count in the sputum and degree of patient
weight loss. This is consistent with a cachexia-like state in patients
with advanced TB infection (19). All of the patients in this study set
were confirmed to have pulmonary TB by culture and were proven
HIV-negative, and all had normal kidney function. Although sub-
clinical TB infection of the kidneys and bladder may exist in some pa-
tients (9), it seems improbable that all patients in the cohort would
have such a urinary tract infection. The molecular size of the LAM

 carbohydrate antigen is small enough to passively penetrate the normal
glomerular filtration cutoff (31) to enter the urine. Thus, it is unlikely
that a kidney infection is required for general urinary LAM shedding.
Alternatively, our control patients who were TB-negative but harbored
pyelonephritis and other genitourinary infections were negative in our
LAM immunoassay.
The present study was performed using pretreatment urine. It will be
important to compare urinary LAM in patients before and after therapy
to evaluate potential therapy-induced reduction or elevation in LAM
antigen shedding. The concentration factor afforded by the nanocage
technology readily measured urinary LAM in >96% of the urine of
true-positive patients (2 SD above background), compared to healthy
negatives and diseased controls. As shown in Fig. 3, the Denkinger et al.
(2) requirements of 95% sensitivity and >80% specificity for a useful
screening tool were achieved in this study set. Nevertheless, this must
be extended to a larger cohort of patients for further validation using
one or more of the rapid formats described in Fig. 6.
Note that eight of the nine patients who were TB smear-negative and
culture-positive were positive for urinary LAM. Sputum smear micros-
copy foracid-fast bacilli has a sensitivity of 50 to 60%; this sensitivity can
be even lower in resource-constrained settings because of the require-
ment of a trained microscopist (26). Thirteen to 17% of newly
transmitted TB cases are attributed to patients who are smear-negative
but ultimately culture-positive (32). These data support the conclusion
that testing methods with adequate sensitivity, superseding the draw-
backs of smear microscopy, can now be used to routinely measure

 LAM in the urine of patients with active pulmonary TB. This has broad
implications for pulmonary TB screening, transmission control, and
treatment management.
Chemical affinity baits and nanocage chemistry offers many
options for TB antigen testing
Enhanced sensitivity for low-abundance analytes is attained by affinity
separation andconcentration of the diagnostic analytesfroma large vol-
ume of input sample. On the basis of a urine volume of 40 ml (one urine
collection cup), in future applications, the concentration factor would
be 1000, because all of the analyte in the urine sample is concentrated
into 40 ml. We screened a large series of previously uncharacterized dyes
to achieve the highest affinity for binding TB antigens (Figs. 1 and 4 and
table S1). The specificity of the nanocage-enhanced assay is derived not
from the high-affinity bait but from the downstream analyte detection
system (14–18). Specifically, the copper dye chemistry used in the assay
was selected on the basis of its unusually high affinity for LAM that far
surpasses other dyes, including the FB28 dye commonly used to stain
bacterial surface glycans (33), and greatly exceeds known affinities of
lectins (34). In the case of LAM, the specificity of the assay is provided
by a mAb that recognizes an epitope on the branched carbohydrate
LAM moiety (23).
Extension of the technology to measure other TB analytes
The following are the limitations of this study: (i) the relatively small
patient and diseased control sample size, (ii) the small volume of pre-
treatment urine analyzed (1 ml) (although we demonstrated lack of
cross-reactivity for Neisseria meningitidisandStreptococcus pneumoniae,
it would be valuable to verify specificity against polysaccharides from
other pathogenic bacteria; if a larger volume of urine is analyzed, then
aproportionally higher analyticalsensitivity can be reached), and (iii) the
extra step required to elute the LAM antigen cargo from the nanocage.
Dissolvable cages can overcome the need to elute the captured antigens.
The utility of the technology can be expanded to detect other major
diagnostic analytes of interest for TB screening: ESAT6 and CFP10, as
well as IL-2, IFN-g, and TNFa. Host cytokines IL-2, IFN-g, and TNFa
are elevated during infection and have been suggested as markers of
active infection, although not specific for TB (12). All of these markers
have been difficult or impossible to measure in urine because of their
low concentration. Using the nanocage technology, we have verified
the presence of ESAT6 in the urine of a pilot set of four HIV-negative/
TB-positive patients. In the past, it has been impossible to longitu-
dinally trackpatients with latent TBwho are switchingto activedisease.
It is conceivable that measuring a panel of host and pathogen analytes
in the urine will reveal a signature of the switch from latent to active
disease. In the past, noninvasive, low-cost, quantitative urine tests were
not sensitive enough to detect active TB in HIV-negative patients and
gauge the severity of the disease, particularly in low-resource settings.
These questions can now be addressed with the analytical methods
introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goal of the study was to develop a noninvasive urinary test for active
pulmonary TB that achieved high sensitivity and specificity. An analyte-
harvesting technology was created to capture and concentrate the TB-
associated antigen LAM. The first phase of this study was a clinical
testing phase. The technology was used to quantitatively measure uri-
nary LAM of TB patients and correlate LAM concentrations with TB
disease severity. Sensitivity and specificity comparing true positives (n =
48) with healthy (n = 39) and diseased (n = 14) controls were assessed
with ROC curves and Wilcoxon tests. The second phase of this study
documented the versatility of the technology for additional TB-related
analytes ESAT6 and CFP10 and relevant host cytokines. Sandwich and
lateral flow immunoassay feasibility for testing clinical specimens was
documented for ESAT6.
Patient study cohorts
Urine samples were collected from hospitalized patients in Peru. Diag-
nosis of active pulmonary TB was verified microbiologically by aura-
mine staining for acid-fast bacilli in sputum and MODS assay (28).
The relative intensity of auramine staining for acid-fast organisms
was scored from 0 to 3, with 3 being the highest (26). Specimens were
collected under informed consent; the study received institutional re-
view board approval at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia
(Lima, Peru) and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
(Baltimore, MD). Clinical and demographic data included age, sex, pre-
vious TB diagnosis, weight, appetite, self-reported symptoms (including
cough, hemoptysis, fever, and fatigue), and average number of coughs in
the previous 24 hours. Appetite was assessed using the SNAQ (20),
which has been validated to assess appetite and weight loss in ambulatory
patients in a range of settings (20). Urine samples were immediately cen-
trifuged at 3000 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 10 min, and the super-
natants were storedin liquid nitrogen or −80°Cuntiluse. Urine specimens
were collected from 14 hospitalized diseased controls and 39 healthy vol-
unteers (Table 1). Negative diseased controls were collected from the same
geographical area. Patient urine samples were qualified before the analysis
by urinary dipsticktesting (MultistixGP,Siemens) forhematuria, protein-
uria, cystitis, and specific gravity analysis for each case. Urinary nitrites
were scored in the urine because they can be a product of oxidation of
nitrates in the TB-infected tissue microenvironment (35). Here, nitrites
were not a parameter for excluding patients.
Nanocage production
Hydrogel cages were produced by precipitation polymerization (14);
high-affinity dye molecules were covalently bound to the hydrogel cages
asreportedbyTamburroetal.(14).RB221(OrganicDyesandPigments),
trypanblue(Sigma-Aldrich),remazolbrilliantblueR(RBB;Sigma-Aldrich),
disperseyellow3(DY3;Fluka),FB28(Sigma-Aldrich),andpigmentred177
(PR177;InternationalLaboratory USA) were verifiedby thin-layerchroma-
tography.Comonomers listed in Table 6 were dissolved in Milli-Q water
andfiltered(0.45mm, Millipore). The solution waspurged withnitrogen
at room temperature at medium stirring for 1 hour and then heated to
50°C (for 1:NBaAl) or 70°C (for 2:NBiAc, 3:NBiDAc, and 4:NBiNh).
Potassium persulfate was added to initiate the polymerization under ni-
trogen for 6 hours. The resulting cages were washed five times (54,400 rcf
for 50 min at 25°C) and then resuspended in Milli-Q water.
RB221 (Table 7) was coupled to the cages as follows: 0.3 g of RB221
powder was mixed to a solution obtained by adding 0.66 g of Na2CO3 to
50 ml of deionized (DI) water and stirring at a medium rate until it is
completely dissolved. The solution was filtered (0.45-mm pore size).
Fifty milliliters of 1:NBaAl cage suspension obtained as described
above was added and allowed to incubate overnight at room tempera-
ture. RB221 coupled cages were washed five times (54,400 rcf for 50 min
at 25°C) and resuspended in 50 ml of DI water.
FB28 (Table 7) was coupled to the cages as follows: The pH of 100-ml
4:NBiNh cages was adjusted to 3 by adding 1 M HCl. The nanocage

RBB, DY3, and PR177 were covalently incorporated in the cages as de-
scribedinSupplementaryMaterialsandMethodsandbyTamburroetal.
(14). Incorporation of the dye into the internal volume of the cage was
verified by differential capture yield in cages where pore size was
modulated by selective chemical degradation of the cross-links (fig. S12
and Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Nanocage enrichment and detection of TB antigens
Immunomacroarray analysis was conducted as follows. Purified LAM
from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv was obtained from
BEI Resources (catalog #NR-14848). Anti-LAM antibody was obtained
from BEI Resources (NR-13811 LAM mAb clone CS-35). One milliliter
of human urine was incubated with 100 ml of nanocage suspension
(5 mg/ml, dry weight). Cages were separated from urine by centrifuga-
tion, washed with DI water, mixed with 10 ml of Novex 2× Tris-Glycine
SDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% (v/v)
2-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at 100°C for 2 min. The cage suspen-
sion was centrifuged (16,100 rcf for 10 min at 25°C), and the supernatant
was saved and subjected to detergent removal (HiPPR Detergent Re-
moval Resin Column Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
vendor’s instruction and using 100 ml of bead suspension. Aliquots (4 ml)
of the resulting purified elution were manually spotted on polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes previously activated with methanol and rinsed
with DI water. Membranes were allowed to dry at room temperature
and then stained using anti-LAM CS-35, horseradish peroxidase–labeled
anti-mouse antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence system (Super-
Signal West Dura, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between TB-positive and TB-negative patients
and low and high microorganism burden were assessed by two-sided
Wilcoxon rank sum test with an a level of 0.05. Regression analysis
was performed with STATA 13. The relationship between covariates
and outcome was explored using linear, logistic, and ordinal regression.
Forward and backward stepwise regression was used to optimize co-
variate selection. The covariates of interest were indicators of socio-
economic status, clinical symptoms (such as cough, fever, and weight
loss), and indicators of appetite. Assessment of appetite was performed
using the SNAQ (20). Survey questions included how the appetite of
patients had been leading up to their hospital admission, how much
food they liked to consume in a meal, how they felt their food tasted,
and how many times a day they were eating. Ratings were completed on
a five-point scale, and a higher score equals higher eating frequency.
Patients were asked about their normal weight during the initial study
survey and weighed upon admission to the hospital. Percent weight
change is used as a covariate. Primary outcome was detection of
LAM in patient urine. LAM was considered as a linear, binary (urinary
LAM cut point, 115 pg/ml), and ordinal outcome (urinary LAM <
115 pg/ml, 115 pg/ml < urinary LAM < 320 pg/ml, and urinary
LAM > 320 pg/ml). Statistical significance of regression coefficients
was assessed by two-sided t tests and z test with an a level of 0.05. Sta-
tistical difference in the hydrodynamic diameter between partially de-
graded and intact nanocages was assessed by two-sided t tests with an a
level of 0.05. Densitometry analysis of Western blot and immunomac-
roarray signals was conducted using ImageJ software. Box plot, ROC
analysis, and power calculations (25) were conducted using R statistical
software (www.r-project.org/).
