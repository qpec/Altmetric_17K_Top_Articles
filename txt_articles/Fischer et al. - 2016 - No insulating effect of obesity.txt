doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00093.2016.—The development of obesity may
be aggravated if obesity itself insulates against heat loss and thus
diminishes the amount of food burnt for body temperature control.
This would be particularly important under normal laboratory condi-
tions where mice experience a chronic cold stress (at �20°C). We
used Scholander plots (energy expenditure plotted against ambient
temperature) to examine the insulation (thermal conductance) of mice,
defined as the inverse of the slope of the Scholander curve at
subthermoneutral temperatures. We verified the method by demon-
strating that shaved mice possessed only half the insulation of non-
shaved mice. We examined a series of obesity models [mice fed
high-fat diets and kept at different temperatures, classical diet-induced
obese mice, ob/ob mice, and obesity-prone (C57BL/6) vs. obesity-
resistant (129S) mice]. We found that neither acclimation temperature
nor any kind or degree of obesity affected the thermal insulation of the
mice when analyzed at the whole mouse level or as energy expendi-
ture per lean weight. Calculation per body weight erroneously implied
increased insulation in obese mice. We conclude that, in contrast to
what would be expected, obesity of any kind does not increase thermal
insulation in mice, and therefore, it does not in itself aggravate the
development of obesity. It may be discussed as to what degree of
effect excess adipose tissue has on insulation in humans and espe-
cially whether significant metabolic effects are associated with insu-
lation in humans.
obesity; insulation; ob/ob
DESPITE THE PRESENT INTEREST IN METABOLISM in connection with
the global obesity epidemic, there is little knowledge concern-
ing the extent to which obesity as such affects metabolism.
There is widespread interest in issues such as the release of
adipokines from adipose tissue depots, but many basic
issues, such as the ability of adipose tissue to affect metab-
olism physically, have been little examined. One of these
issues is the question of the ability of adipose tissue to
function as a thermal insulation barrier, decreasing the heat
loss from the organism and in this way decreasing the
amount of energy needed to keep the organism warm,
thereby increasing the amount of excess energy prone to
storage in the form of (additional) fat.
Whether an insulating effect of obesity exists is of signifi-
cance both for humans and for animal models of obesity.
However, with regard to experimental animals, the issue of
insulation is of further interest. This is because most metabolic
experiments are conducted with mice kept under conditions
(standard laboratory conditions of �21°C) that are principally
cold for the mouse (10, 19, 27, 37, 38, 42, 44) and thus where
a high proportion of total metabolism (nearly half) is devoted
to counteracting the resulting heat loss. This is a condition very
different from that which is relevant for the metabolic physi-
ology of most humans (living in a thermoneutral environment).
Thus, under the current experimental conditions for mice, an
insulating effect of increasing obesity would successively di-
minish the heat loss and thus enhance, in a self-amplifying
way, the further development of obesity. Additionally, the
adaptation to living at a relatively cold temperature may in
itself promote additional insulation (via fur), affecting meta-
bolic rate.
Despite these possible profound influences of alterations
in thermal insulation, data on the effects of obesity on
insulation are scarce and only found for a few specific
rodent models in studies concerned mainly with other issues
(1, 5, 17, 21, 28). We have failed to find studies either in
mice or in human that systematically empirically quantitate
the effect of a series of different obesities on insulation.
Therefore, in this study, we examine the possible influence
of obesities on metabolism as mediated via alterations in
insulation.
METHODS
Animals
Study 1 (effect of fur). Male C57BL/6NCrl mice were purchased at
12 wk of age from Nova (Sweden) and kept at 21°C with free
access to chow diet (�10% calories from fat; Lactamin R70) and
water on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. One day before the start of the
experiment, one group of mice was anesthetized using 4% isofluo-
rane anesthesia and shaved using a commercial electrical shaver
(T-Edjer II). The control group was anesthetized as well, and a
running shaver was placed next to them while the mice were kept
in anesthesia. After this, the mice were immediately returned to
their home cages and placed in metabolic chambers and allowed
to adapt to the chambers overnight at 30°C with ad libitum access
to chow diet and water. Measurements and calorimetry were
performed as described below.
Study 2 (diet and acclimation temperature). Male C57BL/6NCrl
mice were purchased at 12 wk of age from Nova (Sweden). The
mice were housed in single cages at room temperatures of 30, 21,
or 4°C (4°C after a 1-wk acclimation period at 18°C) on a 12:12-h
light-dark cycle. The mice were supplied with a cardboard house
and wood-wool nesting material. Thus, the experienced tempera-
ture in the nest was most likely higher than the room temperature.
The mice had free access to water and were fed ad libitum with
either chow diet (�10% calories from fat; Lactamin R70) or
high-fat diet (45% of calories from fat; Research Diets D12451).
After 6 mo of acclimation to the respective diet and temperature,

 the mice were placed in metabolic chambers and analyzed as
described below.
Study 3 (DIO mice). Sixteen-week-old male diet-induced obese
(DIO)-control and DIO mice (C57BL/6NTac mice) were purchased
from Taconic and housed at room temperature (21°C) and fed either
a control low-fat diet (�10% of calories from fat; NIH31) or high-fat
diet (60% of calories from fat; Research Diets D12492). Feeding of
the respective diets had started at 6 wk of age. The mice were housed
in single cages with ad libitum access to food and drinking water on
a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. The experiments were performed after 6–7
mo of diet feeding.
Study 4 (ob/ob mice). Fifteen-week-old male C57BL/6 Lepob/JRj
mice and lean littermates (Janvier Laboratories, Saint-Berthevin,
France) were used in this study. The mice were fed a chow diet and
housed at an environmental temperature of 21°C. Note that the mice
and the raw data analyzed here are the same as in Fischer et al. (21).
The mice had been implanted with metal-containing telemetric tran-
sponders (E-Mitter G2; Respironics) 2 wk before the experiment.
Thus, no MRI analysis of body composition could be performed. The
mice were analyzed as described below.
Study 5 (strain dependence). Male 129S and C57BL/6 mice from
the animal breeding facility at Stockholm University were housed
at room temperature (21°C) and fed either a chow diet (Lactamin
R70) or high-fat diet (Research Diets D12451) for 1 mo starting at
12 wk of age. The mice were housed in single cages with ad
libitum access to food and drinking water and a 12:12-h light-dark
cycle. Metabolic experiments were performed as described below
before the start of the feeding period and after 1 mo of feeding the
respective diet.
Measurements
Body composition and body weight of the mice were measured 2
days before (studies 3 and 5) or the day after indirect calorimetry was
performed (studies 1 and 2). The body composition was measured by
an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique using the
EchoMRI-100 (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX). The resulting
lean body mass does not include bone, fur, etc., and thus is not
equivalent to fat-free dry mass. Examination of the performance of the
instrument concerning determination of a lipid mass of 10 g (as
relevant for the present study) yielded an accuracy value of �0.5%
and a precision of 0.3% (mean deviation from the mean for 6
repetitive measurements).
Indirect Calorimetry
To measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in
an indirect calorimetry system (INCA; Somedic, Hörby, Sweden), the
mice, in their home cages but without house and nesting material,
were transferred to a sealed chamber (5.6 liters) with a temperature
controller to maintain a stable, adjustable temperature. After calibra-
tion of the oxygen sensors, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production were measured every second minute. In studies 1 and 2,
the mice were allowed to adapt to the chambers overnight at 30°C.
Afterward, the temperature in the chambers was raised to 33°C and
gradually decreased every second hour via 30, 27, 20, and 15°C to
5–8°C. In studies 3 and 5, the mice were allowed to adapt for 1 h at
30°C, and afterward the temperature was gradually decreased every
1.5 h from 30°C via 25, 20, 15, and 10°C to 5–8°C. In study 4, the
mice were allowed to adapt overnight at 21°C. After this, the tem-
perature was increased to 33°C and then gradually decreased every
second hour via 30, 27, 24, and 20°C to 16°C. During the experi-
ments, the mice had free access to water and food. Routinely, the
actual chamber temperatures were measured individually for each
chamber and set temperature, and the measured temperatures were
those used for plotting the curves.
Calculations and Statistics
The energy expenditure in watts (W) was calculated using a
modified Weir equation (57a):

The average energy expenditure during the last hour at each
temperature was used for the analysis (see RESULTS). During this hour,
the mice may display different levels of physical activity, and the
energy expenditure of this activity would necessarily be included in
the average energy expenditure. However, as observed elsewhere and
discussed in general (22, 42, 50), and as demonstrated by Virtue et al.
(55) specifically for physical activity, at subthermoneutral tempera-
tures such extra energy for physical activity does not necessarily add
to the total energy expenditure, as the heat production for thermoreg-
ulation would be correspondingly diminished. Therefore, we have
used total energy expenditure data for the calculations. However,
analysis of the data using only the lowest energy expenditure values
(5 consecutive 2-min periods; resting metabolic rates) yielded final
results qualitatively similar to those obtained here with total values
(i.e., no insulating effect of obesity) (not shown).
The energy expenditure at each temperature was plotted vs. the
environmental temperature (“Scholander Plots”; see Ref. 48). The slopes
of the Scholander plots at and below 27°C, representing the thermal
conductance (W/°C), were calculated using the best linear fit. The
insulation was calculated as the inverse (°C/W) of the slope of
the Scholander curves. The basal metabolic rate was defined here as the
energy expenditure at 30°C. Analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel and GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance was examined using
Student’s t-test and ANOVA as indicated; P � 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. All means shown are average values � SE.
RESULTS
To quantify the general effects of body composition on the
insulation of mice, we used several widely used mouse models for
obesity. We calculated the insulation of the mice from Scholander
plots, as described below and in METHODS. In addition to analyzing
the effect of obesity in these models [long-term HFD feeding,
classical diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and genetically obese
ob/ob mice], we also analyzed the interaction of housing temper-
ature and of mouse strain on the insulation.
Experimental Setup
To determine the insulation of mice, Scholander experi-
ments were performed as exemplified in Fig. 1. As seen in
Fig. 1A, a wild-type mouse [fed a chow diet and housed at
21°C (standard laboratory conditions)] was gradually exposed
to colder temperatures, starting at 33°C and going down to
�7°C. Each drop in chamber temperature resulted in a strong
initial increase in the metabolic rate, probably as a result of
increased stress and activity due to the sudden increased cold
stress. This increase peaked after �15 min, and after 30–60
min the metabolism stabilized at a new, higher level. These
stable levels were markedly increased from 30 (thermoneutral-
ity) to 7°C, representing the increased need for heat production
to compensate for the increased heat loss. For analysis, the
average energy expenditure during the last hour at each tem-
perature was used. As seen in Fig. 1B, the pattern was highly

 reproducible, as indicated by the low SE (n � 7). The meta-
bolic rate from experiments such as this was used for deter-
mining insulation, as described below.
Fur Has a Significant Insulating Capacity
To validate the method for quantification of insulation, we
examined the effects of shaving the mice, i.e., removing an
important part of their insulation. As seen in Fig. 2A, no effect of
shaving on the metabolic rate was visible at 33°C, but with
decreasing temperatures the difference between control mice and
shaved mice became more pronounced, with shaved mice display-
ing markedly elevated metabolic rates. Already at 27°C, shaved
mice displayed distinctly higher metabolism than control mice
(Fig. 2A), implying a change in their thermoneutral zone. When
cold stress was further increased, both groups further increased
their metabolism. However, at the lowest temperature, the differ-
ence between shaved mice and control mice became smaller,
presumably because of an inability of the shaved mice to further
increase their metabolism, as they would have reached their
maximum thermogenic capacity (they were preacclimated only to
21°C; Fig. 2A) (39). The energy expenditure values obtained in
the last hour at each temperature were plotted against the actual
chamber temperature (Scholander plots; Fig. 2B). The slope of the
Scholander curve at subthermoneutral temperatures is a reflection
of the insulation of the animal, as a higher insulation will result in
a reduced need to produce heat, thereby decreasing the slope of
the curve. Thus, the inverse slope of the Scholander curve repre-
sents the insulation of the animal. The calculated insulation of the
shaved mice (Fig. 2C) was �40% lower than the insulation of
control mice. Thus, using this experimental approach, we were
clearly able to detect differences in insulation.

evaluate its significance for heat loss, mice were exposed to

 different conditions (diet and temperature) for 6 mo. The food
intake was markedly different between the mice living at
different temperatures (Table 1), confirming the large effect of
ambient temperature on metabolism. Using this approach, mice
with very different degrees of obesity (�4-fold difference in
lipid mass) were obtained (Table 1). The mice were analyzed
as in Figs. 1 and 2, and the resulting Scholander plots are
shown in Fig. 3, A–C, based on total energy expenditure per
mouse. As seen in Fig. 3, A–C, HFD-fed mice consistently
displayed slightly higher levels of energy expenditure per
mouse than did lean mice (see below). Surprisingly, there was
no effect of either diet or housing temperature on the insulation
of the mice, as is visible in the slopes of the Scholander plots
in Fig. 3, A–C, and as is calculated in Fig. 3D. Plotting
insulation vs. either lean (Fig. 3E) or lipid mass (Fig. 3F)
revealed no effect of obesity. Thus, we were unable to detect
insulating effects of adiposity despite profound differences in
the degree of lipid mass in the different groups. Also, in
contrast to expectations (but see Refs. 23 and 39), cold accli-
mation in itself did not increase the insulation of the animals
(see DISCUSSION).

 Normalization of Energy Expenditure to Lean Mass Does
Not Fffect the Outcome
The calculation of insulation based on the total energy
expenditure levels per mouse revealed no effect of obesity on
insulation but a small effect on total metabolic rates. However,
the entire mouse is not metabolically active, as the lipids
themselves (triglycerides), as well as bone and fur, etc., are
metabolically inert (i.e., the corresponding metabolic activity is
localized to the lean mass around them). Therefore, we also
calculated the insulation based on energy expenditure per lean
mass (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, the normalization to
lean mass virtually eliminated the slight differences in energy
expenditure levels between lean and obese mice (cf. Fig. 3).
This difference was thus mainly due to the increase in lean
mass associated with the expansion of the adipose tissue.
However, the slopes of the Scholander curves remained the
same in lean and obese mice. Calculation of insulation (Fig.
4D) revealed no effects of housing temperature or diet on
insulation, even when calculated based on energy expenditure
normalized to lean mass. Correspondingly, correlation analysis
clearly showed no correlation between insulation and lean
mass or lipid mass (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, even when energy
expenditure was normalized to lean mass to account for dif-
ferences in metabolically active tissue, no insulating effect of
obesity was seen.
The Misleading Effect of Normalization to Body Weight
Normalization to body weight is often used to “correct”
for differences in body size. As pointed out in many articles
(9, 10, 24, 42, 53), in obesity research this approach must
necessarily lead to misleading conclusions, as the increase
in body weight in obesity is due largely to an increase in the
amount of metabolically inert lipids (Table 1). To examine
whether such a traditional normalization approach would
affect the apparent outcome of the insulation measurement,
we performed the same data analysis as described in Figs. 3
and 4, using energy expenditure values normalized to body
weight. In contrast to the previous ways of analyzing,
normalization to body weight had a qualitative effect on the
interpretation of the influence of obesity on the (apparent)
insulation of the mice. As shown in Fig. 5, A–C, normal-
ization to body weight necessarily yielded energy expendi-
ture levels in the HFD-fed mice that were much lower than
in the chow-fed mice, irrespective of acute ambient temper-
ature. Because this apparent hypometabolism in the HFD-
fed mice was proportional throughout the temperature
range, it necessarily resulted in a change in the slope of the
curves, yielding lower slopes in HFD-fed mice. Thus, strik-
ingly, normalization to body weight resulted in a misleading
impression of significantly higher insulation in HFD-fed
mice than in chow-fed mice (Fig. 5D). Even so, notably,
there was no effect of acclimation temperature on insulation.
Correlation analysis resulted here in an apparently signifi-
cant correlation between insulation and lean mass (Fig. 5E)
and lipid mass (Fig. 5F). Thus, division of energy expendi-
ture by body weight (as is commonly done) may mislead-
ingly give an impression of higher insulation in obese
mice.

 Standard Diet-Induced Obese Mice Are Not Better Insulated
than Lean Mice
To verify our finding of obesity not affecting insulation in
mice, we performed the same experiments using commercially
available diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (see Table 2 for
characteristics of the mice used). DIO mice and mice fed the
corresponding low-fat diet were analyzed using either whole
mouse energy expenditure or energy expenditure normalized to
lean mass or to body weight (Fig. 6). Similarly to the obese
mice analyzed in Fig. 3, DIO mice showed slightly but con-
stantly elevated metabolic rates at all environmental tempera-
tures (Fig. 6A), principally in accord with the findings of
Abreu-Vieira et al. (1). However, again, the slope of the
Scholander curves and the resulting calculated insulation (Fig.
6B) were similar in DIO and lean mice. No positive correlation
between insulation and lean mass (Fig. 6C) or lipid mass (Fig.
6D) was found.
Normalization to lean mass did not affect the slope or the
calculated insulation (Fig. 6, E and F), and there was no
significant correlation between insulation and either lean or
lipid mass (Fig. 6, G and H). Normalization to body weight
again misleadingly reduced the slope of the Scholander curves
in the DIO mice (Fig. 6I), thereby implying an increase in the
apparent insulation of the animals (Fig. 6J) but, even so, only
with a nonsignificant trend toward positive correlation between
insulation and lipid mass (and no correlation with lean mass;
Fig. 6, K and L). Thus, the results seen in the mice used in Figs.
3–5 were principally reproduced in this experiment, and again
no effect of obesity on insulation was found.
Genetic Obesity Does Not Lead to Increased Insulation
To further confirm the lack of effect of obesity on insula-
tion, we performed Scholander experiments on genetically
obese (leptin-deficient) ob/ob mice and their lean litter-
mates. These mice are characterized by developing massive
obesity (Table 3). Similarly to the case in DIO mice (Figs.
3 and 6), and as pointed out earlier (21, 31), the total
metabolic rates of ob/ob mice were higher than in the
wild-type mice during the entire Scholander experiment
(Fig. 7A). However, the slopes of the Scholander curves
were similar. Thus, calculation of insulation revealed no
effect of genetic obesity on insulation (Fig. 7B). Normaliza-
tion of the energy expenditure to body weight again led to the
misleading impression of increased insulation in obese mice

 (Fig. 7C). Thus, irrespective of the cause of obesity (diet/
genetics), the resulting obesity does not influence insulation.
No Evidence for Strain Dependence of the Absence
of Insulating Effect of Obesity
Whereas mice of the C57BL/6 strain are generally described
as obesity prone, mice on the 129S background are character-
ized by being resistant to diet-induced obesity. To examine
whether a defect in insulation in 129S mice, leading to in-
creased metabolism, could be responsible for their lean phe-
notype, we measured the insulation of BL/6 and 129S mice.
The mice were analyzed before and after a 4-wk period of
high-fat diet (HFD) feeding starting at 12 wk of age. As shown
in Table 4, the BL/6 mice on HFD gained much more weight
than the 129S mice. However, even in the 129S, feeding a HFD
led to a doubling in lipid weight. As shown in Fig. 8, A and B,
the 129S mice displayed elevated metabolic rates, expressed
here per lean mass, compared with C57BL/6 at all temper-
atures, but the slope of the Scholander plots was similar in
BL/6 and 129S mice. HFD feeding reduced the difference in
energy expenditure levels between BL/6 and 129S, whereas
the slopes were again similar (Fig. 8C). Thus, the calculated
insulation was not significantly different between BL/6 and
129S mice, and HFD feeding again did not affect insulation
(Fig. 8D). Correlation analysis revealed no significant pos-
itive correlation between insulation and lipid mass in either
129S mice (Fig. 8E) or BL/6 mice (Fig. 8F). Thus, the
resistance to obesity in the 129S strain cannot be ascribed to
a lower insulation.

 DISCUSSION
In the present investigation, we analyzed the effects of
obesity and of housing temperature on insulation in mice.
Despite the obvious significance of insulation for analysis of
metabolic data, we are unaware of earlier publications system-
atically quantifying the insulating role of obesities in labora-
tory mice. Although an insulating effect of fur as such was
easily demonstrated, we found that neither any type of obesity
nor any acclimation temperature had any impact on the insu-
lation.
Estimation of Insulation Based on Scholander Plots
We have used Scholander plots here to quantitate insulation.
For these plots, the extra heat production needed to counteract
heat loss at different cold ambient temperatures is plotted
against these ambient temperatures. This is in principle similar
to the determination of insulation (or thermal conductance) in
physical structures and presumes that the insulator is passive, a
prerequisite that may not be correct in animals. However, the
resulting Scholander plots will normally still be linear; i.e., the
insulation part of the animal behaves as if it was a single
physical structure. Because the outcome is linear, the slope of
the curve (principally the insulation) can be determined with-
out knowledge of the “true” body temperature, given that the
energy expenditure is measured at different ambient tempera-
tures and that the resulting data are proportional to the change
in ambient temperature. This means that the mouse defends a
“functionally defined” body temperature that may or may not
coincide with a measured body temperature. For the Scholan-
der analysis, it is thus essential to use the “functionally de-
fined” body temperature. This is what we have done here by
determining the insulation directly from the slope of the
Scholander curves.
Fur is Responsible for Half the Insulation of Mice
We found that fur removal almost halved the insulation of
the mice despite mouse fur being very short. This not only
demonstrated the significance of fur for protection against heat
loss in mice but also validated the method used here and
indicated that alterations in insulation in the order of less than
20% can be detected by this method.
Although no direct quantification of the significance of fur
for mouse insulation was reported earlier, there are several
indications that fur is quantitatively important. These indica-
tions derive mainly from measurements of a higher rate of
oxygen consumption at a single ambient temperature in shaved
mice (26, 33). From such single ambient temperature oxygen
consumption studies (26), theoretical Scholander curves may
be constructed (42). Such curves come out close to the curves
experimentally obtained here. Also, in genetically nude mice,
higher rates of oxygen consumption were observed (15, 26, 29,
41, 51), but the outcome is more difficult to evaluate in the
genetically nude mice, as other factors may be associated with
the nude phenotype. Also food intake is higher at “normal”
laboratory temperatures in shaved mice and in genetically nude
mice (40).
The result of the shaving experiment also demonstrates that
the mouse has no further means to physiologically increase
insulation after the fur is removed; i.e., full physiological
insulation is already achieved (through vasoconstriction, etc.).
Although it may be said that insulation is not only physical
(e.g., through the fur) in the mouse but also physiological (1),

 this component is apparently already fully utilized and cannot
be further recruited when the animal is challenged.
Our data also underline the tenet that alteration (reduction)
of the insulation capacity of the fur is in itself sufficient to
cause profound metabolic alterations (42). As seen in Fig. 2,
furless mice examined at “standard” laboratory temperatures
(18–20°C) have a need for extra (i.e., above basal metabolic
rate) heat production (to compensate for the extra heat loss)
that is nearly twofold higher than that of normal mice. This
thus constitutes a need for a higher rate of thermogenesis and
will in itself lead to activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT)
and, with time, to recruitment of BAT and browning of white
fat. The extra energy consumed for heat production will thus
protect
against
diet-induced
obesity.
Therefore,
several
“browning agents” (agents that recruit BAT and that “brown”
white adipose tissue, with implied anti-obesity effects) may
work by decreasing the insulation of the mice, e.g., through
alterations of the amount or quality of the fur, similar to the
shaving used here. These mice will be subject to an increased
heat loss at any ambient temperature below thermoneutrality;
i.e., the mice will experience the ambient temperature as colder
than that at which they are formally housed. Indeed, several
“browning agents” (including genetic modifications) result in
mice without fur or with visibly altered fur, and several others
may, in other ways, decrease insulation (reviewed in Ref. 42)
and thus induce “browning”. Sometimes this explanation for
published browning effects is recognized (25, 26, 57), but often
it is not.
The Obesity Resistance of 129S is Not Explainable
By Increased Heat Loss
The 129S mouse strain, as well as, e.g., the A/J mouse, is
generally considered to be resistant to diet-induced obesity (4,
6). The metabolic background for this is not understood. It
could be reasoned that the resistance is due to low insulation so
that at any subthermoneutral temperature the 129S mice would
experience more cold than the C57BL/6 mice. This would also
explain the higher degree of BAT recruitment (20) and brown-
ing of the white fat (56) seen in these mice. However, we did
not observe any difference in insulation between the strains, so
a difference in heat loss cannot explain the leaner phenotype.
There was a higher metabolic rate in the 129S mice at all
ambient temperatures, particularly temperatures closer to ther-
moneutrality (Fig. 8A), but the background for this is unknown.
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene expression is higher in
white adipose cell cultures from the 129S strain (35, 45) and
129S present with more mitochondria and more UCP1 in both
brown and white adipose tissues (20, 49), but the genetic basis
for this is not known. Furthermore, higher UCP1 mRNA levels
or even higher UCP1 protein levels are not in themselves
determinative for acute thermogenesis since UCP1 has to be
activated to be thermogenic (43).

 Acclimation Temperature Does Not Affect Insulation
Surprisingly, cold acclimation of the mice did not affect
their thermal insulation. This finding is in contrast to a general
anticipation of the effects of acclimation to cold and to impli-
cations from several earlier studies (see below). However,
Meyer at al. (39) also reported unchanged thermal conductance
(insulation) when mice acclimated to temperatures similar to
those used here were examined under subthermoneutral con-
ditions.
With regard to insulation, cold could potentially recruit
several mechanisms. One would be to increase the thickness of
fur. Indeed, several studies have shown effects of cold accli-
mation on hair coat development and hair thickness in mice
housed at �3°C (7) or that of the offspring of mice that had
been housed at �3°C for multiple generations (8). Similarly,
rats housed at 17°C from birth developed a greater coat mass
than rats reared in the warm (54). In the above-mentioned
studies, either the animals were exposed to cold shortly after
birth or the parental generations had been living in the cold, but
Al-Hilli and Wright (2) showed that even mice exposed to cold
(8°C) at 23 days of age developed longer and thicker hair than
control animals. However, even if such changes in fur should
have occurred here in our experiments, we see no effects on
insulation.
Alternatively, cold acclimation could increase the thickness
of an insulating fat layer. Although much fat is found deeper in
the body of mice, mice display a layer of fat in the skin
presently referred to as dermal adipose tissue (3, 18, 34).
Indeed, the absence of this fat layer (caused by ablation of the
syndecan-1 gene) makes mice susceptible to cold, and the
thickness of this fat layer is doubled by acclimation to 23 vs.
30°C (32). There are thus clear indications, both through fur
growth and through more dermal fat, that mice would become
more insulated following cold acclimation. However, our data
and those of Meyer et al. (39) clearly demonstrate that no
increased insulation is actually observed.
Obesity Does Not Insulate Mice
Probably as an extrapolation of the idea that the blubber fat
layer found under the skin of seals and whales acts as thermal
insulation [and it may even be discussed if this is the case, as
the blubber may have energy storage as a primary purpose
(36)], it has generally been considered that fat depots in
humans and in experimental animals (mice) could play a role
in thermal insulation (but see Ref. 1). Following this reasoning,
the fat in obese persons has been discussed to possess an
insulating function, protecting the obese against heat loss and
in this way diminishing caloric combustion and therefore
adding to the development of obesity.
However, we were unable to observe any insulating effect of
obesity in several models of mouse obesity (Figs. 3, 4, and
6–8). Only if the energy expenditure data were analyzed by
dividing by body weight would an effect of obesity be apparent
(Figs. 5–7), but this is a misleading representation, as the
whole obese mouse does not lose less heat (Figs. 3 and 7).
Some insulating effect of the fat may nevertheless be con-
sistent with the data obtained here. This is because heat is lost
via and thus proportional to the surface of the mouse, and the
surface area of a mouse is principally a function of body
weight. Geometrically for a sphere, surface area is proportional
to body volume (�weight)0.67. The most obese mice used here
were �50 g vs. the leanest, �25 g, yielding proportionality
factors of 13.6 vs. 8.6. Because the mice are not spheres, the
values have to be adjusted with the empirical Meeh factors,
which have been established to be 8.3 for obese mice and 9.8
for normal mice (11). The heat loss factors should thus be 115
vs. 84, i.e., indicating some 36% greater surface area and heat
loss in the obese mice at a given subthermoneutral ambient
temperature. Because we see no increase in heat loss (increased
metabolism) per mouse between lean and obese mice, the
implication is that insulation has indeed been increased due to
obesity, rather surprisingly to an extent that exactly counteracts
the increase in surface area. Thus, at the whole mouse level,
there would be no effect on metabolism.
One reason that no effect of obesity on insulation is observed
may be the localization of the adipose depots. A major part of
the fat in the mouse body is not found in a layer that could be
discussed anatomically as having an insulating function.
Rather, many of the depots are found deep in the body (e.g.,
mesenteric), and even those found more peripherally (often
termed subcutaneous) are not distributed as a uniform layer
wrapped around the body but rather consist of several sepa-
rated depots (13, 16). Thus, much of the fat could anatomically
be considered in retrospect to be unable to perform any
insulating task. Only the dermal fat has a distribution appro-
priate for an insulating function, and indeed, loss of this
adipose tissue (through ablation of the syndecan-1 gene) is
reported, as noted above, to result in higher cold sensitivity of
the mice (32). However, the alterations in dermal fat thickness
caused by acclimation to different temperatures (32) do not
seem to alter insulation (Fig. 3), and the high cold sensitivity of
the syndecan-1-ablated mice could be secondary to further
structural skin or fur problems caused by the loss of the dermal
adipocytes or by other effects of the absence of syndecan-1.
Although not documented, it is clear from dissection of obese
mice that even the subdermal adipose tissue is increased in
obesity, and an influence on thermoregulation would be ex-
pected in these mice. Again, we were unable to observe such an
effect in any of the obesity models tested here.
All of the above experiments have been performed with
animals exposed to cold air. Because of the large difference
between the thermal conductivity of air and water (52), the data
here cannot be directly considered to also be relevant for
animals exposed to cold water.
Does Obesity Insulate Humans?
Full quantitative insulation studies such as those performed
here on mice have not been performed on humans. Because of
the human size and surface/volume ratio, and thus high thermic
inertia, such experiments are not easily performed. Nonethe-
less, the general connotation has been that obese persons are
better insulated than lean persons, and this would tend to
aggravate the obesity. Based on the mouse data presented here,
the question may be raised as to whether this is really the case.
Just as in mice, human obesity is may be associated with
central rather than peripheral lipid accumulation, and as in
mice, increased subcutaneous fat may not necessarily lead to
better insulation.
However, there are reports that obese women have a lower
abdominal skin temperature when exposed, lightly dressed, to

OBESITY DOES NOT INSULATE

 subthermoneutral temperatures (20–25°C) (12, 30, 46, 47).
The connotation that fat insulates in humans seems experimen-
tally to be based primarily on this type of observation. There
are some studies examining possible higher cold-induced heat
production in lean and obese persons, but the outcome is not
fully clear, e.g., because the effect is not of obesity but of not
being lean (46), values are normalized with a factor akin to
dividing by body weight (14), or the obese group was very
heterogeneous (58). Thus, despite the ability of humans to
carry much thicker layers of fat than mice can, it has not been
firmly established that obese persons empirically are more
insulated than normal persons.
However, as implied in the introduction, in any case, this
may not be an important issue in human metabolic research.
This is because of the different thermic environments of human
beings vs. experimental mice. In contrast to mice at 20°C that
constantly have to use energy to counteract heat loss to the
environment, humans normally live de facto under thermoneu-
tral conditions (housing plus clothing). Therefore, it is doubtful
that an insulating effect of obesity, even if it existed, would in
any discernable way affect the development or maintenance of
human obesity. At thermoneutrality, no extra food combustion
is required to counteract heat loss, and the degree of insulation
would thus not play any role for the metabolic balance equation
for normal life humans.
Thus, in contrast to common views, we demonstrate here
that at least in mice obesity is not associated with increased
insulation, and obesity thus does not in this way affect the
metabolism of mice. Whereas it may not be possible to extrap-
olate our findings directly to humans, it may also be understood
that, even in human metabolism, obesity would not reinforce
itself due to a possible insulation effect, as humans are not
living under cold stress.
