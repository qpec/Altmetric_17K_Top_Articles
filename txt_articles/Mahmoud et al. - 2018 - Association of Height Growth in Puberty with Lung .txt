AT A GLANCE COMMENTARY 
Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Low lung function at the physiological plateau in 
early adulthood is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in later life. 
Lung development during childhood and adolescence influences maximally attained lung 
function in early adulthood. Puberty is a crucial phase in this process, during which a 
series of programmed biological changes occur that may influence lung function. Height, 
a key developmental factor during puberty, is strongly correlated with lung function, but 
little is known about the influence of the characteristics of the pubertal height growth on 
subsequent lung function. 
What This Study Adds to the Field: This population based, birth cohort study with 
repeat measurements of anthropometry and lung function from childhood to early 
adulthood shows that later onset and higher velocity of pubertal growth are associated 
with higher maximally attained lung function at age 24 years in both sexes, with a greater 
magnitude in males than females. 
 1 
 
ABSTRACT 
Rationale: Puberty may influence lung function, but the precise role of pubertal height 
growth in lung development is unclear. 
Objectives: To examine associations of timing of puberty and peak velocity of pubertal 
height growth with lung function in adolescence and early-adulthood. 
Methods: Longitudinal analyses of repeat height measurements from age 5-20 years for a 
British birth cohort with 4,772 males and 4,849 females were conducted to characterise 
height growth trajectories, and derive pubertal age and peak height velocity using the 
validated SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) model. Association of these 
estimates with pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measures: FEV1; 
FVC; FEV1/FVC; FEF25-75 at age 15 and 24 years were investigated using multivariable 
regression models adjusted for lung function at age 8 years, height and age at time of 
outcome measurements, and potential confounders. 
Measurements and Main Results: Later pubertal age and greater peak velocity were 
associated with higher FEV1 and FVC at 24 years in both sexes. A 1-year advanced pubertal 
age was associated with a 263 ml higher FVC (95% confidence interval: 167, 360) for males 
(n=567), 100 ml (50, 150) for females (n=990). A 1-cm/year increase in peak velocity was 
associated with 145 ml (56, 234) and 50 ml (2, 99) increase in FVC for males and females 
respectively. No associations were found with FEV1/FVC. 
Conclusions: Later onset and greater peak velocity of height growth in puberty are 
associated with increased FEV1 and FVC in young adults but there was no evidence of 
dysanapsis of pubertal lung growth.

INTRODUCTION 
Pubertal growth is a pivotal phase in the life course whose characteristics can influence 
adulthood health outcomes including type 2 diabetes (1), cardiovascular mortality (2), 
ovarian (3) and testicular (4) cancers. Understanding the role of pubertal growth in 
subsequent health conditions may provide insight into heterogeneous pathophysiology of 
related diseases and explain growth-related differences in their associated risks (5-7). 
Timing of pubertal growth has shown a secular trend towards earlier ages over years (8), 
which is related to childhood life-style and social factors, e.g. diet, obesity, deprivation and 
psychological stress, as well as environmental exposures including endocrine disruptors 
found in several household products (9, 10).  
Previous studies investigating association of puberty with later health outcomes have  
largely relied on deriving pubertal age using recalled sexual development such as age at first 
menstrual bleeding (11-14), self-reported attainment of breast (15) and pubic hair (16) 
Tanner stages for females; and self-reported attainment of testis , pubic hair Tanner 
stages (17) and voice deepening (18) for males. Although these methods have some validity, 
their reliability may depend on characteristics of the study population including age at recall 
and socioeconomic factors such as educational attainment and social class (19). Moreover, 
methods of tracking pubertal growth using Tanner stages may not reveal precise pubertal 
timing since sexual characteristics are assessed at specific time points and the attained 
Tanner stage is reported, with no information on exact age at attainment. In addition, 
subjective assessments, particularly around the transition to a higher Tanner stage, may lead 
to misclassification problems. As a result, these methods may bias estimates of the effects of 
 4 
 
pubertal age. The velocity (speed) of pubertal growth is another parameter whose role in 
relevant health outcomes, e.g. adulthood lung function, remains incompletely understood. 
 Age at first menstrual bleeding has been associated with respiratory health conditions in 
women (14, 20), including low lung function, a major predictor of disability and mortality in 
adults (21). Impairments of lung function, either obstructive, defined as low ratio of forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC), or restrictive, defined 
as low FVC, are major causes of disability and death worldwide (22-24). There has been a 
growing interest in identifying childhood risk factors associated with impaired lung function 
in adulthood, particularly those related to pubertal development. For instance, earlier age at 
menarche has been associated with reduced FVC in women with no effect found on 
FEV1/FVC (14). These findings were confirmed by a Mendelian randomization study of 
46,944 adult women and 3,025 adolescent girls investigating the causal effect of age at 
menarche on lung function, using 122 genetic variants as instrumental variables (20). Of 
note, consistent findings were shown in men in whom the same genetic variants were used 
as instrumental variables for sexual development (20). This may suggest a role for pubertal 
age in general rather than for menarche specifically. 
Pubertal height growth has been used as an effective marker for pubertal development (25). 
Height is an objective measure that can be easily obtained, and of particular importance 
when respiratory health is considered because it is related to lung volumes (26). Through 
identification of the individual height growth trajectories, we can examine association of age 
as well as velocity of pubertal height growth with lung function in both males and females; 
and reveal gender growth-related differences in lung development. 
 5 
 
In this study we used a validated SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) 
model (27) to characterise individual height growth from age 5-20 years and investigate the 
associations of pubertal age and height velocity with lung function in adolescent and young 
adult males and females. 
METHODS 
Study design, setting and population 
We studied participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a 
population-based birth cohort. The study protocol was described previously (28), and a 
detailed description is reported in the online data supplement. Briefly, 46,944 pregnant 
women resident in Avon, UK with expected delivery dates between April 1, 1991 and 
December 31, 1992 were recruited, and their live-born children were followed 
prospectively. There was a total of 46,944 fetuses, resulting in 46,944 live births and 46,944 
children who were alive at 1 year of age. Participant flow is shown in Figure 1. The study was 
approved by the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and local research ethics committees. 
Height growth in puberty 
Longitudinal measurements of height were mainly obtained from direct measurement in 
annual research clinics from age 7 to 13 years and at 15, 17 and 24 years.  These were 
supplemented with maternal and self-reported measures throughout the duration of the 
study. Standing height was measured to the last complete millilitre by trained clinic staff. For 
characterising individual height growth trajectories, we considered measurements between 
the ages of 5 to 20 years for those participants who had at least one height measured after 9 
 6 
 
years old (� =  9,621, excluding quadruples, triples and one random child from each alive 
twin). 
Height growth curves by sex were fitted using the SuperImposition by Translation and 
Rotation (SITAR) model, a validated non-linear mixed effects model (27). The SITAR model 
explains most of the population heterogeneity in pubertal height growth through 
characterising variability in pubertal age, measured by age at peak height velocity (APV) and 
magnitude of peak height velocity (PV), see Figure 2. Additional detail on the SITAR model is 
provided in the online data supplement. Median, interquartile range (IQR), correlation of 
APV and PV, and standard deviations and correlations of the SITAR model’s random effect 
parameters were obtained to describe the height growth in puberty. 
Lung function 
We performed spirometry according to standards of the ATS/ERS criteria (29, 30) in 
research clinics at ages 8, 15 and 24 years. Lung function at 15 and 24 years were reported 
before and 15 minutes after receiving 400 µg of salbutamol administered by metered aerosol 
through a spacer (31, 32). The highest measurement of each lung function variable (FEV1, 
FVC, FEV1/FVC, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75)) amongst the 
best three technically acceptable flow-volume curves was used for analyses. Post-
bronchodilator (post-BD) lung function variables at age 15 and 24 years were used as the 
primary outcomes, which were summarized using the median and IQR. Missing lung function 
data were examined to assess whether they were plausibly missing at random, details are 
reported in the online data supplement. 
 7 
 
Statistical analysis 
The associations of APV and PV with lung function outcomes in adolescence and early 
adulthood were examined by using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for 
confounders, lung function at age 8 years, age and height at clinic visits for spirometry. We 
estimated differences in lung functions at age 15 and 24 years associated with 1-year 
increase in APV, and 1cm/year increase in PV, mutually adjusted for each other. We 
estimated odds of risk for asthma symptoms and wheezing at ages 16 and 23 years 
associated with 1-year increase in APV, and 1cm/year increase in PV by using logistic 
regression models adjusted for confounders. Detailed description of statistical analyses is 
reported in the online data supplement. 
Sex differences among characteristics of interest were examined using �� and Mann Whitney 
tests for categorical and continuous factors respectively. Associations of potential 
confounders with lung function outcomes were examined using multiple linear regression 
models. We identified the following variables as being associated with at least one of the lung 
function measures and adjusted for them in subsequent analyses: parity (≥ 1 sibling); 
maternal history of asthma or allergy; maternal smoking during pregnancy; birth weight; 
ever doctor-diagnosed asthma by age 14 years; exposure to tobacco smoke from birth to 8 
years of age; smoking status at 14 years. 
Several secondary analyses were performed to address the robustness of our findings: 
(1) pre-bronchodilator (pre-BD) measurements were used as lung function outcomes; 
(2) secondary sexual characteristics such as age at menarche for females and pubic hair 
development for males were used as measures of pubertal development; (3) post-BD lung 
 8 
 
function excluding the lowest and highest 1% of measurements were used to examine the 
sensitivity to extreme spirometry values; (4) we performed �-means cluster analysis to 
identify groups of subjects with similar pubertal growth in terms of APV and PV. The 
associations of clusters of identified pubertal patterns with lung function were then 
examined to assess pattern-specific differential risks; (5) a sensitivity analysis was 
performed to investigate the association between lung function at 8 years old and pubertal 
growth to assess potential reverse causation (i.e. that lung function in childhood was 
affecting puberty); (6) an analysis restricted to subjects with complete lung function data at 
ages 8, 15 and 24 years was performed to examine sensitivity to incomplete lung function 
cases. Details of the secondary analyses are provided in online data supplement. All analyses 
were adjusted for lung function at age 8 years, height and age at time of lung function 
measurements. The analyses were conducted using R software (33).  
RESULTS 
Characteristics of the study population 
Among 9,621 subjects with at least one observation of height measured after age 9 years (the 
study population), 4,849 (50.4%) were female. Table 1 reports characteristics of the study 
population by sex. A similar proportion of male and female subjects had an asthmatic or 
allergic mother (47.4% in males vs 46.5% in females), were exposed to maternal smoking 
during pregnancy (23.3% vs 22.3%), had at least one sibling (53.8% vs 54.5%), and low birth 
weight (4.3% vs 4.7%). More male subjects were born preterm (5.9% vs 4.7%, � = 0.01), 
reported positive doctor-diagnosed asthma ever by 14 years of age (36.4% vs 30.2%, � =
2 × 10��) compared with female subjects. Whereas female subjects were more exposed to 
 9 
 
maternal anxiety during pregnancy (32.6% vs 29.8%, � = 0.009), and had higher proportion 
of smokers by age 14 years (31% vs 18.6%, � = 2 × 10���) compared with male subjects. 
Male subjects had higher baseline FEV1 and FVC measurements at 8 years of age (� =
2 × 10���), were taller and attended earlier, in relation to their birth date, at the 15-year visit 
clinic (largest � = 7 × 10��), and taller and attended later, in relation to their birth date, at 
the 24-year visit clinic (largest � = 0.001) compared with female subjects. 
Longitudinal analysis of pubertal height growth 
A total of 33,367 and 33,783 measurements were included in the analysis for 4,772 males 
(median 8 measurements, IQR 4 to 9 and range 1 to 20), and 4,849 females (median 8, IQR 5 
to 9 and range 1 to 18) respectively. The SITAR model explained 96.2% and 96.6% of the 
height growth variation in males and females with residual standard deviation 13 and 12 
millimetre respectively (Table E2). The median (IQR) APV was 13.5 (13.0 to 13.9) for males 
and 11.7 (11.2 to 12.1) years for females and the median (IQR) PV was 9.9 (9.3 to 10.5) and 
8.0 (7.5 to 8.5) cm/year respectively (Figure 2 and Table E2). The correlations between APV 
and self-reported pubertal staging, i.e. age at menarche and age at advanced pubic hair 
Tanner stage (>2), were 0.71 and 0.26 for females and males respectively. In both sexes, 
growth curves were steeper for those with an early puberty and shallower for individuals 
who attained puberty later, correlation (APV, PV) = -0.70 and -0.62 for males and females 
respectively. The estimated subject-specific parameters confirmed these relationships 
(Table E3). There were positive correlations, 0.29 and 0.20 for males and females 
respectively, between velocity and size (magnitude of height). These suggest that children 
with relatively higher PV tend to remain on their height trajectory achieving above average 
adulthood height (Table E3).

Lung function outcomes 
Structures of missingness of lung function data at ages 8, 15 and 24 years are presented in 
Figure E1. Table E4 shows that parity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, exposure to 
smoke from birth to age 8 years, ever doctor-diagnosed asthma by age 14 years and smoking 
by age 23 years were related to chance of missing the next lung function data, but the current 
lung function measurements were not. This implies that data are likely to be missing at 
random and that our analyses, considering all variables related to missingness, should be 
unbiased. 
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of lung function outcomes at age 15 and 24 years in the 
study population and restricted to subjects with complete data on confounding and control 
variables by sex. At age 24 years, the median FVC was 5.50 litres (IQR: 5.00 to 6.06) and 3.89 
litres (IQR: 3.53 to 4.24) and the median FEV1 was 4.61 (IQR: 4.19 to 5.04) and 3.36 (IQR: 
3.06 to 3.66) for male and female subjects respectively. Male subjects had higher spirometry 
measurements (FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75) at both ages compared with female subjects. 
These measurements were similar when data was restricted to subjects with complete data 
on confounders and control variables. 
Associations of pubertal height growth with lung function 
At age 24 years, a 1-year increase in APV was associated with 263 ml (95% CI: 180 to 346, 
� = 1 × 10��) increase in FEV1 in males and 100 ml (95% CI: 59 to 141, � = 1 × 10��) in 
females. Similar findings were obtained for FVC (263 ml, 95% CI: 167 to 360, � = 1 × 10�� 
in males; 100 ml, 95% CI: 50 to 150, � = 8 × 10�� in females) and FEF25-75 in males (270 
ml/s, 95% CI: 114 to 425, � = 7 × 10��), see Figure 3 and Table E6. In contrast, at age 15 
 11 
 
years the APV in males was inversely associated with lung function measurements: FEV1 
(-100 ml, 95% CI: -150 to -50, � = 8 × 10��); FVC (-103 ml, 95% CI: -158 to -49, � =
2 × 10��); FEF25-75 (-168 ml/s, 95% CI: -250 to -86, � = 6 × 10��). There was no evidence of 
association between pubertal age and lung function at 15 years in females. 
At age 24 years, a 1cm/year increase in PV was associated with 161 ml (95% CI: 85 to 237, 
� = 4 × 10��) increase in FEV1 in males, 46 ml (95% CI: 6 to 86, � = 0.025) in females 
(Figure 4, Table E7). Similarly for FVC, a 1cm/year increase in PV was associated with 145 
ml (95% CI: 56 to 234, � = 0.001) increase in males and 50 ml (95% CI: 2 to 99, � = 0.043) 
in females. Evidence of association with FEF25-75 was only found in males (163 ml/s per 
1cm/year increase in PV, 95% CI: 17 to 308, � = 0.029). At age 15 years, lung function 
measurements, i.e. FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75, showed the same direction of association with PV as 
at age 24 years in males (largest � = 9 × 10��), with no or little evidence of association in 
females (lowest � = 0.034). For both genders, results show that the PV is more important 
than APV as a predictor for adolescence lung function, whereas for adulthood lung function 
the APV plays the dominant role, see Tables E6 and E7 and ‘Statistical analyses’ section in 
the online data supplement for more details. 
Results obtained from secondary analyses confirmed the findings of the study (Table 3, 
E8-E11 and Figures E5-E6 in the online data supplement). 
Associations of pubertal height growth with asthma symptoms and wheezing 
Advanced pubertal age and increased magnitude of peak height velocity were associated 
with 28% (95% CI: 13 to 41) and 21% (95% CI: 6 to 34) lower risk of asthma symptoms 
respectively in adolescence, and 21% (95% CI: 6 to 34) and 22% (95% CI: 7 to 34) lower risk 
 12 
 
of wheezing in early adulthood for females. Whereas for males, there was some evidence that 
higher peak velocity is associated with 19% (95% CI: 2 to 34) lower risk of asthma symptoms 
in adolescence, see Table 4. 
DISCUSSION 
Main findings 
This large, population-based birth cohort study shows that both pubertal age and peak 
height velocity, estimated from individual-level longitudinal height growth curves, are 
associated with lung function in early adult life, around the time of maximal lung function 
attainment. In both sexes, we found an association of later pubertal age and rapid pubertal 
growth on increased FVC with no evidence of an effect on large airway obstruction 
(FEV1/FVC) suggesting that the effect of pubertal growth is manifested by increase of both 
FEV1 and FVC with no evidence of dysanaptic growth occurring during pubertal 
development. In contrast in adolescent males, we showed that later pubertal age was 
associated with decreased lung function, which may indicate a lag between height growth 
and lung function maturation during puberty. Additionally, we showed that rapid pubertal 
growth was associated with increased FVC, FEV1 and FEF25-75 in males in adolescence and 
early adulthood, with less evidence of an effect in females.  
Findings in the context of the literature 
The findings of this study support previous evidence suggesting an increase in FVC of 123 ml 
(� = 0.01) in women associated with one year later age at menarche, but no association with 
FEV1/FVC (14). Our finding in adult males, showing a similar association with FVC, confirms 
 13 
 
the Mendelian randomisation findings suggesting effects of pubertal age in general rather 
than menarche specifically (20). 
The inverse association of APV with FVC at 15 years in males is intriguing and contrast with 
the relationships in females. Lung volume increases during childhood are generally linear up 
until puberty and related largely to height growth in both sexes (34). However, during the 
pubertal growth spurt, there is uncoupling of growth in chest wall dimensions with height 
increases, such that thoracic growth lags behind leg and height growth (35). Lung volumes 
continue to increase after height growth ceases but there is evidence that the pattern differs 
between males and females; the latter have a shorter duration of lung development and lung 
volume increases have completed by the occurrence of menarche (36). In contrast, lung 
volume increases in males continue throughout puberty and beyond the point at which final 
adult height is reached. We interpret the differential relationship seen at 15 years in this 
study in the context of most females having completed menarche by this age but a sizeable 
proportion of males being in mid-puberty. Coupled with the lag between height and thoracic 
development growth, we believe this observation is most likely explained by the timing of 
lung function measurement in relation to pubertal status. 
Although pubertal growth has clearly an important influence on lung function, the plateau 
phase of lung function development usually occurs in early to mid-twenties (21). The 
association of greater magnitude of PV with increased lung function at 15 and 24 years could 
possibly be explained by rapid pubertal growth influencing lung function directly as well as 
leaving a longer interval for post-pubertal lung development prior to achieving plateau 
values. It is conceivable that our findings reflect the inverse relationship between the 
 14 
 
pubertal age and magnitude of peak height velocity for both sexes. This confirms the clinical 
observation that pubertal timing and velocity are inversely correlated (37). 
Strengths and limitations 
This study offers insights into the roles of pubertal height growth in maximal lung function 
which can shape the respiratory health in late adulthood. Our study utilised repeated height 
measurements, covering span of childhood through early adulthood, to which we applied 
well validated mixed-effects model (SITAR) for characterising growth in puberty. As a result, 
pubertal age and peak height velocity were derived and explained more than 96% of 
variability in pubertal height growth among subjects. This approach avoided potential 
problems of most traditional methods used for investigating growth in puberty such as the 
Tanner stages, e.g. misclassifications of pubertal stages. Our findings highlight potential 
implications of the secular trend shifting to earlier attainment of puberty over years (8). We 
addressed the associations of height growth with different lung function parameters 
including FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75. We minimized potential reverse causation by adjusting 
results for lung function at age 8 years. Another strength is that the study accounts for a wide 
range of potential confounders with detailed information provided by the ALSPAC cohort. 
There are some limitations to our study design and findings. We had no information on 
hormone levels, the gold standard to measure puberty. Therefore, the influences of 
hormones could not be addressed. However, our secondary analyses showed consistency in 
results using other proxy measures, including timing of appearance of secondary sexual 
characteristics. We supplemented height measurements taken at the research visit clinics 
with some self-reported heights. The complex physiological changes that occur in puberty 
 15 
 
challenge the identification of precise mechanisms underlying our findings on pubertal age 
and peak height velocity suggesting a need for further research to investigate them. Our 
study population is liable to loss to follow up that related to socioeconomic factors. However, 
there is no evidence that its potential bias might affect the association of puberty with lung 
function. 
Conclusions 
Our study provides evidence for associations of later onset and steeper pubertal growth with 
greater maximally attained lung volumes by analysing longitudinal heights around the time 
of puberty using a validated approach for both males and females. We found that pubertal 
growth patterns associated with increased lung volumes were associated with reduced 
reporting of asthma-like symptoms in this population of young adults despite the absence of 
evidence of specific effects on airway obstruction. We have shown previously that low FEV1 
tracks through childhood and may be associated with COPD in adults (38, 39), but the 
long-term implications on adult lung disease of lung volume changes we observed during 
puberty without evidence of dysanaptic growth have yet to be fully determined. 
Our findings, together with evidence of a secular trends towards earlier puberty (8), may 
have population-level consequences on lifetime lung function and respiratory symptoms and 
raise a public health implication for targeting modifiable childhood factors, such as obesity 
and overweight, that may contribute to pubertal growth patterns.
