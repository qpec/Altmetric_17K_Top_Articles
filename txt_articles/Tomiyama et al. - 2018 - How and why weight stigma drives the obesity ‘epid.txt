Abstract
Background: In an era when obesity prevalence is high throughout much of the world, there is a correspondingly
pervasive and strong culture of weight stigma. For example, representative studies show that some forms of weight
discrimination are more prevalent even than discrimination based on race or ethnicity.
Discussion: In this Opinion article, we review compelling evidence that weight stigma is harmful to health, over
and above objective body mass index. Weight stigma is prospectively related to heightened mortality and other
chronic diseases and conditions. Most ironically, it actually begets heightened risk of obesity through multiple
obesogenic pathways. Weight stigma is particularly prevalent and detrimental in healthcare settings, with
documented high levels of ‘anti-fat’ bias in healthcare providers, patients with obesity receiving poorer care and
having worse outcomes, and medical students with obesity reporting high levels of alcohol and substance use to
cope with internalized weight stigma. In terms of solutions, the most effective and ethical approaches should be
aimed at changing the behaviors and attitudes of those who stigmatize, rather than towards the targets of weight
stigma. Medical training must address weight bias, training healthcare professionals about how it is perpetuated
and on its potentially harmful effects on their patients.
Conclusion: Weight stigma is likely to drive weight gain and poor health and thus should be eradicated. This effort
can begin by training compassionate and knowledgeable healthcare providers who will deliver better care and
ultimately lessen the negative effects of weight stigma.

Background
In a classic study performed in the late 1950s, 10- and
11-year-olds were shown six images of children and
asked to rank them in the order of which child they
‘liked best’. The six images included a ‘normal’ weight
child, an ‘obese’ child, a child in a wheelchair, one with
crutches and a leg brace, one with a missing hand, and
another with a facial disfigurement. Across six samples
of varying social, economic, and racial/ethnic back-
grounds from across the United States, the child with
obesity was ranked last [1].
In the decades since, body weight stigma has spread
and deepened globally [2, 3]. We define weight stigma as
the social rejection and devaluation that accrues to those
who do not comply with prevailing social norms of ad-
equate body weight and shape. This stigma is pervasive
[4–6]; for example, in the United States, people with
greater body mass index (BMI) report higher rates of
discrimination because of their weight compared to re-
ports of racial discrimination of ethnic minorities in
some domains [7]. Women are particularly stigmatized
due to their weight across multiple sectors, including
employment, education, media, and romantic relation-
ships, among others [8]. Importantly, weight stigma is
also pervasive in healthcare settings [9], and has been
observed among physicians, nurses, medical students,
and dietitians [4]. Herein, we first address the obeso-
genic and health-harming nature of weight stigma, and
then provide a discussion of weight stigma specifically in
healthcare settings. We conclude with potential strategies
to help eradicate weight stigma.

 Weight stigma triggers obesogenic processes
Common wisdom and certain medical ethicists [10, 11]
assert that stigmatizing higher-weight individuals and
applying social pressure to incite weight loss improves
population health. We argue the opposite. The latest sci-
ence indicates that weight stigma can trigger physiological
and behavioral changes linked to poor metabolic health
and increased weight gain [4, 5, 12–14]. In laboratory ex-
periments, when study participants are manipulated to ex-
perience weight stigma, their eating increases [15, 16],
their self-regulation decreases [15], and their cortisol (an
obesogenic hormone) levels are higher relative to controls,
particularly among those who are or perceive themselves
to be overweight. Additionally, survey data reveal that ex-
periences with weight stigma correlate with avoidance of
exercise [17]. The long-term consequences of weight
stigma for weight gain, as this experimental and survey
work suggests, have also been found in large longitudinal
studies of adults and children, wherein self-reported expe-
riences with weight stigma predict future weight gain and
risk of having an ‘obese’ BMI, independent of baseline
BMI [18–20].
The harmful effects of weight stigma may even extend
to all-cause mortality. Across both the nationally repre-
sentative Health and Retirement Study including 13,692
older adults and the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS)
study including 5079 adults, people who reported experi-
encing weight discrimination had a 60% increased risk of
dying, independent of BMI [21]. The underlying mecha-
nisms explaining this relationship, which controls for BMI,
may reflect the direct and indirect effects of chronic social
stress. Biological pathways include dysregulation in meta-
bolic health and inflammation, such as higher C-reactive
protein, among individuals who experience weight discrim-
ination [22]. In MIDUS and other studies, weight discrim-
ination also amplified the relationship between abdominal
obesity and HbA1c, and metabolic syndrome more gener-
ally [23, 24]. Longitudinal data from MIDUS also showed
that weight discrimination exacerbated the effects of
obesity on self-reported functional mobility, perhaps be-
cause weight discrimination undermines one’s self-concept
as a fully functioning, able person [25].
Weight stigma also has profound negative effects on
mental health; nationally representative data from the
United States show that individuals who perceive that
they have been discriminated against on the basis of
weight are roughly 2.5 times as likely to experience
mood or anxiety disorders as those that do not, account-
ing for standard risk factors for mental illness and ob-
jective BMI [26]. Furthermore, this detrimental effect of
weight stigma on mental health is not limited to the
United States; weight-related rejection has also been
shown to predict higher depression risk in other coun-
tries [27]. Importantly, the evidence indicates that the
association generally runs from discrimination to poor
mental health, rather than vice versa [27].
A rapidly growing set of studies now shows that these as-
sociations cannot simply be explained by higher-weight in-
dividuals’ poorer health or greater likelihood of perceiving
weight-related discrimination. In fact, the mere perception
of oneself as being overweight, across the BMI spectrum
(i.e., even among individuals at a ‘normal’ BMI), is pro-
spectively associated with biological markers of poorer
health, including unhealthy blood pressure, C-reactive pro-
tein, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and HbA1c
levels [28]. Emerging evidence indicates that this harmful
cycle may even be intergenerational, wherein children per-
ceived as overweight by their parents are at greater risk for
excess weight gain across childhood [29], independent of
the child’s actual weight. Collectively, these findings sug-
gest that stigma attached to being ‘overweight’ is a signifi-
cant yet unrecognized agent in the causal pathway from
weight status to health.
Weight stigma in healthcare
Healthcare is a setting in which weight stigma is particu-
larly pervasive, with significant consequences for the
health of higher-weight patients [30, 31]. A sample of
2284 physicians showed strong explicit and implicit
‘anti-fat’ bias [32]. High levels of bias are observed even
among clinicians specializing in obesity-related issues,
with the proportion endorsing explicit ‘anti-fat’ bias sen-
timents (e.g., ‘Fat people are worthless’) increasing in re-
cent years [33]. The nature of healthcare provider bias
encompasses endorsement of negative stereotypes of pa-
tients with obesity, including terms like ‘lazy’
, ‘weak-willed’
,
and ‘bad’
, feeling less respect for those patients, and being
more likely to report them as a ‘waste of time’ [30].
This stigma has direct and observable consequences
for the quality and nature of services provided to those
with obesity, leading to yet another potential pathway
through which weight stigma may contribute to higher
rates of poor health. In terms of quality of care and medical
decision-making, despite the fact that higher-weight pa-
tients are at elevated risk for endometrial and ovarian can-
cer, some physicians report a reluctance to perform pelvic
exams [34] and higher-weight patients (despite having
health insurance) delay having them [35]. Higher BMI male
patients report that physicians spend less time with them
compared to the time they spend with lower BMI patients
[36]. Additionally, physicians engage in less health educa-
tion with higher BMI patients [37].
In terms of quality of communication, higher-weight
patients are clearly receiving the message that they are
unwelcome or devalued in the clinical setting, frequently
reporting feeling ignored and mistreated in clinical settings,
and higher BMI adults are nearly three times as likely as
persons with ‘normal’ BMI to say that they have been

 denied appropriate medical care [38]. Further, obese pa-
tients feel that their clinicians would prefer not to treat
them [36]. As a result, patients with higher BMI report
avoiding seeking healthcare because of the discomfort of
being stigmatized [35, 39, 40]. Even when they do seek
medical care, weight loss attempts are less successful when
patients perceive that their primary care providers judge
them on the basis of their weight [41].
Medical professionals are also not immune to experien-
cing weight bias. Medical students with a higher BMI re-
port that clinical work can be particularly challenging, and
those with a higher BMI who internalize ‘anti-fat’ attitudes
also report more depressive symptoms and alcohol or
substance abuse [42].
Tackling weight stigma
Many common anti-obesity efforts are unintentionally
complicit in contributing to weight stigma. Standard
medical advice for weight loss focuses on taking individual
responsibility and exerting willpower (‘eat less, exercise
more’). In this context, a little shame is seen as motivation
to change diet and activity behaviors [10, 11]. Nevertheless,
this approach perpetuates stigmatization, as higher-weight
individuals already engage in self-blame [43] and feel
ashamed of their weight [44]. Stigma, therefore, maybe be
an unintended consequence of anti-obesity efforts, under-
mining their intended effect. Moreover, focusing solely on
obesity treatment runs the risk of missing other diagnoses,
as was recently illustrated by Rebecca Hiles, whose mul-
tiple physicians failed to diagnose her lung cancer and in-
stead repeatedly told her to lose weight in order to address
her shortness of breath [45].
Traditional approaches to combatting obesity and poor
metabolic health are clearly not working. Obesity rates
remain high globally in both adults [46, 47] and children
[48], and even in those countries where rates appear to
be plateauing, disparities continue to grow between
dominant and minority groups (e.g., racial/ethnic minor-
ities, lower socioeconomic status populations, and those
with the highest BMI) [49–51]. Moreover, given the link
between obesity, metabolic health, and stigma, the need
to eradicate weight stigma is urgent. Metabolic diseases
such as type II diabetes are at unprecedented levels in
adults and children [52]. Governments and clinicians
alike have struggled to find effective strategies to prevent
weight gain, support weight loss, and promote metabolic
health. The science of weight stigma crystallizes a key
point for future success – to tackle the obesity ‘epidemic’
we must tackle the parallel epidemic of weight stigma.
The most effective and ethical approaches will aim to
address the behaviors and attitudes of the individuals
and institutions that do the stigmatizing, rather than
those of the targets of mistreatment [53], thus avoiding
blaming the victim and removing the burden of change
from those experiencing mistreatment. Such a pervasive
problem requires a multi-pronged strategy both within
healthcare settings and at higher levels of government
and society. In healthcare settings, medical training must
address weight bias. Healthcare professionals and stu-
dents need to be educated about what weight bias is,
how it is perpetuated, the subtle ways it manifests, and
the effect that it has on their patients. Part of this train-
ing could include education regarding the research doc-
umenting the complex relationship between higher BMI
and health [54], the well-documented shortcomings of
BMI as an indicator of health [55, 56], and important
non-behavioral contributors to BMI such as genes [57]
and diseases that create obesity as a symptom (e.g., poly-
cystic ovary syndrome, lipedema, or hypothyroidism).
Compassionate and knowledgeable healthcare providers
will deliver better care, lessening the negative effects of
weight bias. However, healthcare providers could go be-
yond merely not having bias to creating weight-inclusive
[58], welcoming atmospheres. Such an approach focuses
on well-being rather than weight loss and emphasizes
healthy behaviors [13, 58]. Empathy, respect, and hu-
manity will foster better healthcare.
At a broader level, public health approaches to pro-
moting metabolic health must stop the blame and shame
implicit (and sometimes very explicit [59]) in their mes-
saging. Public health messages speak not just to the tar-
get of the message but also to society more generally.
Fat-shaming messages encourage discrimination by con-
doning it. Public health messages can encourage healthy
behaviors without once mentioning weight or size by
emphasizing that modifiable behaviors, such as an in-
crease in fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity,
better sleep patterns, and stress reduction, would im-
prove health for all [13, 60, 61], regardless of the number
on the scale.
Furthermore, there must be legal protection against
weight-based discrimination. In the United States, for
example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not identify
weight as a protected characteristic, and only in rare in-
stances can people with very high BMI seek legal protec-
tion under Americans with Disabilities Act legislation.
Drawing parallels from analyses of sexual orientation
discrimination laws [26], we know that policies protecting
higher-weight individuals will reduce the likelihood that
prejudicial beliefs against stigmatized people are translated
into damaging discriminatory treatment.
Influential people who fat shame, whether they are
healthcare providers, parents, educators, business leaders,
celebrities, or politicians, are the most damaging. They
must be made aware of and held responsible for their be-
havior. Social attitudes likely change fastest when those
with the most power serve as proper role models for a civil
society or face negative consequences of their demeaning
Tomiyama et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:123

 behavior [62, 63]. However, who will call out those that are
enacting prejudice? Healthcare providers may be ideal
candidates to do so. Higher status individuals incur fewer
social costs than lower status individuals when they
recognize and claim discrimination happening to others
[64]. Healthcare providers are conferred higher social sta-
tus due to the imprimatur of medicine, and can thus serve
as valuable allies for heavier individuals facing fat shaming.
Finally, public service messages are needed to educate
people about the stigma, discrimination, and challenges
facing higher-weight individuals; blatant discrimination
must be stopped, but so too must the implicit [33] and
daily [65, 66] cultural biases against them. Weight stigma
often happens in quiet and subtle ways that may be invis-
ible to those doing the stigmatizing, yet hurtful and de-
moralizing to those on the receiving end. For example, a
thinner patient may receive eye contact and a smile from
a physician who walks into the room, whereas that same
physician might avoid eye contact with a heavier patient;
the daily nature of this form of weight stigma likely accu-
mulates, ultimately harming health [67].
Conclusion
We have argued in this Opinion article that weight
stigma poses a threat to health. There is a clear need to
combat weight stigma, which is widespread worldwide
[3] and, as we reviewed above, throughout healthcare set-
tings. Doing so will help to improve the health and quality
of life of millions of people. Indeed, eradicating weight
stigma will likely improve the health of all individuals, re-
gardless of their size, since the insidious effects of weight
stigma reviewed herein are found independently of object-
ive BMI, with many individuals with ‘normal’ BMI also fall-
ing prey to the health-harming processes brought about by
weight stigmatization.
Enlightened societies should not treat its members
with prejudice and discrimination because of how they
look. Healthcare providers should treat obesity if patients
have actual markers of poor metabolic health rather than
simply due to their high BMI. Additionally, if patients re-
quest counseling regarding their metabolic health, health-
care providers can address actual behaviors, such as healthy
eating and physical activity, without ever mentioning, and
certainly without ever stigmatizing, a patient’s objective
BMI [13]. Indeed, this is the strategy of interventions such
as Health at Every Size® [68] and other non-dieting ap-
proaches (reviewed in [69]), which have been shown in
randomized controlled trials to improve multiple health
outcomes such as blood pressure and cholesterol. The pro-
vider–patient relationship is one that is inherently unequal,
with healthcare providers holding the power to profoundly
affect patient’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors [70]. To
advance as an equal society, healthcare providers should
lead the way for weight stigma eradication.
