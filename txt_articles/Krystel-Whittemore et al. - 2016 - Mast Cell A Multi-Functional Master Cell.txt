Mast cells are immune cells of the myeloid lineage and are present in connective tissues 
throughout the body. The activation and degranulation of mast cells significantly modu-
lates many aspects of physiological and pathological conditions in various settings. With 
respect to normal physiological functions, mast cells are known to regulate vasodilation, 
vascular homeostasis, innate and adaptive immune responses, angiogenesis, and 
venom detoxification. On the other hand, mast cells have also been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of many diseases, including allergy, asthma, anaphylaxis, gastrointes-
tinal disorders, many types of malignancies, and cardiovascular diseases. This review 
summarizes the current understanding of the role of mast cells in many pathophysiolog-
ical conditions.

iNTRODUCTiON
Mast cells are important cells of the immune system and are of the hematopoietic lineage. Mast cells 
are originated from pluripotent progenitor cells of the bone marrow, and mature under the influence 
of the c-kit ligand and stem cell factor in the presence of other distinct growth factors provided by 
the microenvironment of the tissue where they are destined to reside. Under normal conditions, 
mature mast cells do not circulate in the bloodstream. However, mast cell progenitors migrate into 
tissues and differentiate into mast cells under the influence of stem cell factor and various cytokines. 
Mast cells are present throughout the body and they play important roles in the maintenance of 
many physiological functions as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases. Accordingly, this review 
is focused on the role of mast cells in a wide range of physiological functions and pathogenesis of a 
variety of disease states.
Location of Mast Cells
Mast cells are found in mucosal and epithelial tissues throughout the body. In rodents, mast cells 
also reside in peritoneal and thoracic cavities. Mast cells are found in all vascularized tissues except 
for the central nervous system and the retina (1). Mast cells are located at the junction point of the 
host and external environment at places of entry of antigen (gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory 
epithelium) (1–4). Mast cells are located in areas below the epithelium in connective tissue surround-
ing blood cells, smooth muscle, mucous, and hair follicles.
The cytoplasm of the mast cell contains 50–200 large granules that store inflammatory mediators, 
including histamine, heparin, a variety of cytokines, chondroitin sulfate, and neutral proteases (1). In 
order for mast cells to migrate to their target locations, the co-ordinated effects of integrins, adhesion 
molecules, chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors are necessary (5). Mast cell progenitors are

found in high numbers in the small intestine. CXCR2 expressed 
on mast cell progenitors directs their migration to the small 
intestine. Binding of α4β7 integrins (expressed on mast cells) to 
adhesion molecule VCAM-1 on the endothelium initiates the 
transit of mast cell precursors out of the circulation (5).
The lungs do not have many mast cell progenitors in a normal 
physiological state. Upon antigen-induced inflammation of the 
respiratory endothelium, mast cell progenitors are recruited by 
engaging α4β7 integrins, VCAM-1, and CXCR2. Additionally, 
CCR-2 and CCL-2 are involved in the recruitment of mast cell 
progenitors to the respiratory endothelium. When mature mast 
cells are activated and degranulated, more mast cell progenitors 
are recruited to the site of inflammation (5).
There are two phenotypes of human mast cells: mucosal mast 
cells that produce only tryptase and connective tissue mast cells 
that produce chymase, tryptase, and carboxypeptidases (6, 7). 
Mast cell activation and mediator release have different effects 
in various tissues and organs. Most common sites in the body 
exposed to antigens are the mucosa of the respiratory tract 
(airborne), gastrointestinal tract (food borne), blood (wounds, 
absorption from respiratory tract/gastrointestinal tract), and 
connective tissues (8).
When the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to an antigen, its 
response is to increase fluid secretion, increase smooth muscle 
contraction, and increase peristalsis. Proteins derived from differ-
ent plants and animals can act as antigens and activate the immune 
system in vulnerable subjects (8). The antigen (peptide) perme-
ates through the epithelial layer of the mucosa of the gut and binds 
to IgE on mucosal mast cells. These peptides are presented to Th2 
cells, and if there is an IgE antibody against the peptide present, 
it will cause activation of the mast cell resulting in an immune 
response. This causes mast cells to degranulate and release a 
variety of inflammatory mediators. These mediators increase 
vascular permeability, causing edema in the gut epithelium and 
smooth muscle contraction, which lead to vomiting and diarrhea. 
This type of reaction can occur in response to peptides found in 
certain medications. Food allergens can also cause skin reactions. 
Uptake from the gastrointestinal tract can introduce antigens into 
the blood, which are transported throughout the body where they 
bind to IgE on mast cells in the connective tissue in the deep layers 
of the skin. This results in urticarial reaction and angioedema (8).
In the respiratory tract, the immune response to mast cell acti-
vation results in airway constriction, increased mucous produc-
tion, and cough (1). The most common introduction of antigens 
to the respiratory tract is via inhalation. Mucosal mast cells in 
the nasal epithelium are activated by antigens that diffuse across 
the mucosa after being inhaled. In the respiratory tract, mast cell 
degranulation increases vascular permeability and local edema, 
which can obstruct nasal airways and lead to congestion (9, 10). 
There is increased production of mucus and its accumulation can 
block off the sinuses and result in a bacterial infection. Mast cells 
also play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma. 
This is caused by an inflammatory response in the airways, which 
results from inhaled antigens that get into the lower respiratory 
tract and cause mast cell degranulation and local inflammation. 
These events lead to increased vascular permeability, fluid accu-
mulation, and edema, which can obstruct the airways. Bronchial 
constriction can occur due to smooth muscle contraction, which 
can lead to airway obstruction that is seen in asthma. Air is, there-
fore, trapped and total lung capacity is increased while forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) 
are decreased (8). In the blood vessels, increased vascular perme-
ability leads to edema and local inflammation, which results in 
antigen transport to the lymph nodes (11).
In the skin, antigens, via IgE, activate mast cells in the deep 
layers of connective tissue. Mast cells release histamine as well 
as other vasoactive molecules, which cause urticaria (hives). If 
the antigen activates mast cells in deeper tissue, this can lead to 
angioedema. If the response is prolonged, atopic dermatitis or 
eczema may occur. Eczema is seen clinically as a chronic itching 
skin rash with raised lesions and fluid discharge. Eczema is more 
commonly seen in childhood while allergic rhinitis and asthma 
are seen throughout life (8).
Mechanism of Activation
Mast cells are known for their main mechanism of action: IgE-
mediated allergic reactions through the FcϵRI receptor. IgE 
antibodies are produced by mature B cells in response to CD4+ 
Th2 cells. Naïve mature B cells produce IgM and IgD antibodies. 
Once they become activated by an antigen, B cells will prolifer-
ate. If these B cells interact with cytokines, such as IL-4 (which is 
modulated by CD4+ Th2 cells), the antibody class switches from 
IgM to IgE (12). IgE is mostly found bound to FcϵRI receptors 
on the mast cell, and very little IgE is found as a soluble antibody 
in circulation. When an antigen comes in contact with the mast 
cell, it crosslinks two or more FcϵRI molecules and activates 
the release of granules from the mast cell (13). IgE is found in 
the connective tissue under epithelial layers of the skin, in the 
respiratory tract, and also in the gastrointestinal tract (1). In 
addition to FcϵRI, mast cells also express Fc receptors for IgA 
and IgG, receptors for adenosine, C3a, chemokines, cytokines, 
and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), as well as 
toll-like receptors (TLRs), all of which are involved in mast cell 
activation and immune response.
The most common physiological pathway for mast cell activa-
tion is via antigen/IgE/FcϵRI cross linking (14). FcϵRI consists of 
an α-chain that binds to IgE, a β-chain, which spans the mem-
brane, and γ chains, which are a disulfide-linked homodimer. 
FcϵRI interacts with LYN tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates 
the tyrosine in its immunoreceptor tyrosine bases activation 
motifs (ITAMs) on the B and γ chains of the FcϵRI (15). Lyn 
activates Syk tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylates signaling 
proteins, such as LAT1 and LAT2 (linkers for activation of T 
cells) (16). Phosphorylated PLCγ hydrolyzes phosphatidylino-
sitol-4,5-bisphosphate to make inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) 
and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 and DAG are second messengers 
and IP3 causes calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic 
reticulum (17). Calcium release activates and causes NFκB to 
translocate to the nucleus of the cell, which results in transcrip-
tion of cytokines, such as IL-6, TNFα, and IL-13. Zeb2 is involved 
in regulation of degranulation upon stimulation via FcϵRI (18). 
Activation of FcϵRI activates Fyn (Src kinase). Fyn regulates mast 
cell degranulation, which is complementary to the Lyn signaling 
pathway. Fyn activates PI3K, which activates Akt and produces

PIP3 (15). This activates mTOR, which is involved in mast cell 
chemotaxis and cytokine production (14). There are also recep-
tors for IgG called FcγR. The y-chain homodimer is the same 
in FcγRI as in FcϵRI so the signal sent from FcγR can crosstalk 
with FcϵRI (14). Repeated and controlled exposure of mast cells 
to antigen can desensitize a patient’s sensitivity. Although the 
mechanisms are not clearly understood, the slow and persistent 
degranulation of mast cells is thought to be one of the mecha-
nisms. The desensitization protocol is used in patients who are 
allergic to certain drugs (e.g., penicillin) but need treatment for 
a life-threatening bacterial infection that can only be treated with 
this drug.
Mast cell desensitization can occur from exposure to increasing 
doses of antigen. This technique can be used if a patient is allergic 
to a necessary drug and prevention of anaphylactic reactions to 
food. By desensitizing the receptors, this can decrease the number 
of FcϵRI molecules available on the mast cell surface (19).
PHYSiOLOGiCAL ROLeS OF MAST CeLLS
Mast cells are involved in the regulation of variety of physiological 
functions, including vasodilation, angiogenesis, bacterial, and 
parasite elimination. In addition, mast cells regulate functions of 
many cell types, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, B 
cells, fibroblasts, eosinophils, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. 
Since, mast cells generate and release multi-potent molecules, 
such as histamine, proteases, prostanoids, leukotrienes, heparin, 
and many cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, they have 
the capacity to be involved in regulating the functions of many 
organs and tissues. One of the mostly studied functions of the 
mast cell is its role in vascular and bronchial homeostasis. Mast 
cells also play a significant role in the regulation of bone growth, 
remodeling, and mineral homeostasis.
Angiogenesis
Mast cells are involved with enhancing angiogenesis (20). 
Mast cells secrete pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, bFGF, 
TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8. In addition, mast cells release 
proteases and heparin which release pro-angiogenic factors that 
bind to heparin. Histamine, released by mast cells, induces per-
meability of the microvasculature that also induces angiogenesis. 
There is also evidence of mast cells enhancing angiogenesis in 
tumor growth (20).
Homeostasis
Mast cells contribute to homeostasis in the immune system. They 
serve as a first line of defense against antigens entering the body 
due to their location in the skin and mucosa (21). Mast cells are 
especially important in the homeostasis of the commensal bacte-
ria of the gut (22). The digestive system is constantly exposed to 
different antigens, such as bacteria (commensal and pathologic) 
and food antigens. The epithelial cells that line the digestive sys-
tem serve as a barrier to these antigens. Mast cells are important 
in the differentiation of follicular helper T cells via ATP signaling. 
As a result, mast cells play a role in IgA maturation and overall 
homeostasis of the gut bacteria (22).
innate and Adaptive immunity
Mast cells play an important role in innate and adaptive 
immunity. Mast cells recognize harmful antigens by binding to 
pathogens directly or associating with PAMPs on the mast cell 
surface (23). Most commonly the receptors on the mast cells are 
TLRs and receptors for complement. Once the antigen binds to 
the receptors on the mast cell, it causes the release of inflam-
matory mediators, which helps to eliminate the pathogen that 
activated it. The mechanism for how this happens depends on 
which PAMP is recognized. TLR2 is activated by Gram-positive 
bacteria, and to an extent by Gram-negative bacteria and myco-
bacteria, which cause the mast cell to release cytokines, such 
as IL-4. TLR4 binds LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, which 
causes proinflammatory cytokine release (TNFα, IL-1, IL-6) 
without degranulation (23, 24). On the other hand, the Gram-
positive bacterial product peptidoglycan stimulates mast cell 
degranulation as well as histamine release via TLR2 activation 
(25, 26). The elimination of bacteria is aided by mast cells by 
release of inflammatory mediators that increase vascular perme-
ability, increase fluid accumulation, and recruit immune cells, 
such as eosinophils, NK cells, and neutrophils. Additionally, 
mast cells directly produce antibacterial products, such as 
cathelidcidins, defensins, and psidins. Mast cells also contribute 
to antiviral responses by recruiting CD8+ T cells, which produce 
IFN-α and IFN-β (27, 28). One of the first identified functions 
of the mast cell was to produce an anti-parasitic environment 
when activated by IgE. Release of mediators from the mast cell 
increases vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction, 
which helps to expel the parasites from the gastrointestinal tract 
by inducing vomiting or diarrhea or from the respiratory tract 
by coughing (8).
Mast cells are also involved in adaptive immunity. Mast 
cells process and present antigens via MHCI and MHCII (29). 
Mast cells activate dendritic cells that also function as antigen-
presenting cells. When mast cells are stimulated through TLF-7, 
they release IL-1 and TNFα, which causes dendritic cells to move 
from their location in the skin and go to local lymph nodes and 
activate cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, mast cells release TNFα, 
which can activate cytotoxic T cells directly (30).
Activation and Mediator Release
Mast cells upon activation release preformed and newly 
synthesized mediators in a phasic fashion. A variety of endog-
enous and exogenous agents can stimulate mast cells to release 
mediators immediately. Activation of mast cells occurs when 
an antigen crosslinks IgE molecules that are bound to FcϵRI 
on the surface of the mast cell. FcϵRI receptor for IgE has an 
affinity 100 times greater for the Fc of IgE than of IgG. Because 
of this, IgE is found bound to the FcϵRI receptors on the mast 
cell even when there are no antigens present. As a result, this 
makes the response of the mast cell to an antigen very fast. 
FcϵRI signaling uses the Lyn-dependent phosphorylation 
of ITAMs on the B and y subunits of the FcϵRI (1). Protein 
kinase Syk is activated and autophosphorylated after being 
recruited to the ITAMs. Syk phosphorylates linker activation 
of T cells (LAT) and non-T cell activation linker (NTAL). LAT 
phosphorylates PLC, which produces IP3 and DAG, which

activates intracellular calcium influx and PKC activation. 
NTAL activates PI3K, which also helps with calcium release. 
This results in degranulation of the mast cells, lipid mediator 
production, and cytokine production (1).
There are two ways to crosslink IgE molecules on the mast cell 
surface. If an antigen has the same epitopes, they will crosslink 
IgE molecules of the same specificity. If an antigen has more than 
two epitopes, they will crosslink IgE molecules with different 
specificities (8).
Degranulation occurs a few seconds after crosslinking and 
results in release of the inflammatory mediators that are stored in 
the granules (31). Many of the mediators that are stored or newly 
synthesized by the mast cells attract leukocytes (eosinophils, 
basophils, Th2 lymphocytes, neutrophils) to the inflammatory 
site and amplify the inflammatory response (1). The inflamma-
tory mediators increase the permeability of the blood vessels so 
that the immune cells can move from the blood stream to the 
affected tissue. After degranulation, mast cells resynthesize the 
mediators and repopulate granules (8).
Mast cells express TLRs 1–7 and 9, NOD-like receptors 
(NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (1). If a TLR on the 
mast cell is activated, MyD88 and MAL/TIRAP are associated 
and promote NFκB translocation to the nucleus resulting in 
cytokine transcription (32). TLR4 can be activated by LPS from 
Gram-negative bacteria. This causes cytokine production without 
degranulation. When TLR2 is activated by peptidoglycan, this 
results in degranulation and cytokine production (33).
IgE-mediated activation by FcϵRI causes degranulation and 
synthesis of many immune mediators, such as eicosanoids and 
cytokines, as well as other products (Figure 1). When the mast cell 
is activated, it immediately releases prepackaged granules. Mast 
cell granules (MCG) can be compared to lysosomes in that there 
is a low pH and lysosomal enzymes, such as β-hexosaminidase 
and caspase-3 (34). Tryptase, chymase, cathepsin G, and car-
boxypeptidase are proteases stored in prepackaged granules that 
activate metalloproteases in the extracellular matrix. Activation 
of the metalloproteases breaks down extracellular matrix proteins 
and remodels the connective tissue matrix. Chymase cleaves 
fibronectin and collagen by activation of MMPs. β-tryptase has 
been shown to cleave IgE once the mast cell has been activated to 
down regulate the allergic response (35). Histamine and heparin 
are also stored in prepackaged granules and are involved with vas-
cular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. Histamine is 
the most important mediator released from the mast cell involved 
with an allergic response. Histamine is derived from the amino 
acid histidine and works through three different receptors (H1, 
H2, H3). Stimulation of H1 receptors by the binding of histamine 
induces the classic allergic reaction. H1 receptors are found on 
smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Activation of H1 recep-
tors on endothelial cells results in increased vascular permeability 
and activation of smooth muscle cells resulting in contraction, 
constriction of airways, and mucous secretion (8). TNFα, also 
stored in the MCG, activates macrophages, endothelium, and 
cytokines (36). TNF-α binds to endothelial cells and results in 
increased adhesion molecule expression. Leukocytes can bind 
to these adhesion molecules and then are brought to the site of 
inflammation (36, 37).
Other molecules are synthesized and released after the 
mast cells have been activated. IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF 
are involved with eosinophil production and activation. 
CCL3 is a chemotactic factor for macrophages and neutro-
phils (1). Eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and 
thromboxanes) are produced by catalytic conversion of 
arachidonic acid by the action of phospholipase A2 on mem-
brane phospholipids. Mast cells express COX1 and COX2, 
which converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and 
thromboxanes with the action of specific isomerases (38). 
Prostaglandins increase vascular permeability and attract 
neutrophils. Leukotrienes are involved with smooth muscle 
contraction, airway constriction, and mucous secretion (39). 
Eicosanoids act at the local area of mast cell degranulation. 
Platelet-activating factor is released after mast cell activa-
tion that acts as a chemotactic factor for leukocytes, and 
activates neutrophils, eosinophils, and platelets (40). All of 
the mediators released upon activation results in increased 
vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and 
airway constriction. These adaptations can remove parasites 
from the gastrointestinal tract. Due to the increased vascular 
permeability, increased fluid in the tissue can enhance elimi-
nation of parasites. IgE-mediated mast cell activation would 
result in physical expulsion of parasites. However, developed 
countries rarely have parasite infections. Persistent mast cell 
degranulation resulting from recurrent responses to innocu-
ous substances leads to allergies, asthma, and food allergies. 
Mast cell degranulation also occurs from grass, pollen, or 
shellfish-derived allergens. It is of interest that developing 
countries do not have a high prevalence of allergies or asthma 
potentially due to childhood exposure to a variety of envi-
ronmental PAMPs and subsequent desensitization (8).

role of mast cells in vascular inflammation during systemic 
hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion as well as the progression of 
atherosclerosis.
Microvascular inflammation in Systemic 
Hypoxia
Mast cells mediate microvascular inflammatory response to 
systemic hypoxia caused by a reduction in the level of inspired 
oxygen (41). During hypoxia, leukocytes interact with endothelial 
adhesion molecules, resulting in leukocyte rolling and adherence 
within systemic venules, and eventually leukocyte emigration 
into the tissue. This microvascular inflammatory response was 
also associated with increased vascular permeability to plasma 
proteins during systemic hypoxia (42).
Steiner et al. concluded that activation of mast cells contrib-
utes to development of a chemotactic gradient during systemic 
hypoxia and that this is a critical event in the subsequent devel-
opment of microvascular inflammation (41). This was based on 
several lines of evidence: 1) systemic hypoxia caused mast cell 
degranulation, as shown by an increase in ruthenium red uptake 
in mast cells, 2) the mast cell stabilizer cromolyn attenuated 
the increases in leukocyte adherence and vascular permeability 
during systemic hypoxia, and 3) the mast cell activator com-
pound 48/80 caused mast cell degranulation and microvascular 
inflammation.
The mechanism responsible for mast cell activation during 
systemic hypoxia is complex, and is partially dependent on 
increased generation of ROS. Administration of the antioxidant 
lipoic acid prevents hypoxia-induced mast cell degranulation 
(37). Mast cell activation also contributes to increased ROS 
generation during systemic hypoxia, as dihydrorhodamine-
dependent fluorescence in venular endothelium was attenuated 
by cromolyn. Although decreased oxygen levels in culture 
media have been shown to increase ROS generation in various 
cells in vitro (43), decreased tissue oxygen levels in systemic 
organs are not the major cause of mast cell degranulation 
in vivo. Dix et al. developed a system to control the tissue oxygen 
level with the cremaster (the skeletal muscle surrounding the 
testes) independent of oxygen levels within systemic arterial 
blood. A local reduction in tissue oxygen levels to that seen 
during systemic hypoxia did not cause mast cell degranulation 
or increased leukocyte adherence within cremaster venules (44). 
During systemic hypoxia, however, these events occurred in the 
cremaster even though the tissue oxygen levels were maintained 
at normal levels.
After demonstrating that a proinflammatory mediator was 
released into the circulation during systemic hypoxia that caused 
mast cell degranulation and microvascular inflammation, we 
began a series of studies to find the source of this mediator as 
well as its identity. Following a reduction in inspired oxygen, the 
first organ to become hypoxic is the lungs. Chao et al. found that 
hypoxia causes release of MCP1 from alveolar macrophages in 
the lungs, and that increased circulating levels of MCP1 result in 
mast cell degranulation and microvascular inflammation within 
systemic organs (45).
ischemia/Reperfusion
Ischemia/reperfusion injury occurs following a prolonged 
decreased blood flow to an organ, followed by the restoration 
of blood flow. Organ transplantation is the classic example of 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in which the organ receives no blood 
flow for a period of time until vessels are re-anastomosed in the 
recipient. Tissue oxygen levels decrease in the organ during the 
ischemic phase, but microvascular inflammation does not develop 
until the reperfusion phase (46). During the ischemic phase, 
vasodilators accumulate within the tissue resulting in higher than 
normal blood flow for a period of time when blood flow is restored 
to the organ. During the reperfusion phase, increased generation 
of ROS occurs resulting in mast cell activation. The mechanism 
responsible for mast cell degranulation during ischemia/reperfu-
sion differs from that triggered by allergens, which is mediated by 
the IgE receptor (FceRI) pathway (47).
During reperfusion, complement molecules C3a and C5a 
cause mast cell degranulation when activating G-protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCR) on the mast cell surface (48). Additionally, 
reactive oxygen species are generated when tissue is reperfused, 
which activates intracellular pathways causing mast cell degranu-
lation (49). Intracellular and extracellular pathways converge and 
result in phospholipase C-mediated production of IP3 and DAG, 
causing calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and 
activation of protein kinase C, leading to degranulation of the 
mast cell (50, 51).
Mast cells release mediators that increase both leukocyte adhe-
sion to the venular endothelium and vascular permeability during 
reperfusion (47). These effects are mediated by various substances 
released by mast cells, such as histamine, tryptase, and chymase 
(46). Yang et al. examined ischemia in rat liver (46). Rat livers 
were subjected to 1 h ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. 
Mast cell degranulation was monitored by toluidine blue staining 
and assessment of mast cell tryptase. Mast cell degranulation was 
highest at 2 h of reperfusion, while liver damage was greatest after 
6 h of reperfusion. Administration of either the mast cell stabilizer 
cromolyn or the mast cell activator compound 48/80 to decrease 
the number of MCG prior to ischemia/reperfusion decreased the 
severity of hepatic injury (46).
Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and 
ventricular fibrillation, can develop as a result of mast cell 
degranulation following ischemia/reperfusion. Activated car-
diac mast cells release renin, which converts angiotensinogen 
to angiotensin 1, which is then formed to angiotensin 2 by 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin 2 enhances 
the release of norepinephrine from nerve endings and can lead 
to arrhythmias (52). Mast cell stabilizers, such as cromolyn, 
inhibit this process and, therefore, can help to abolish arrhyth-
mias during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. It is possible to 
inhibit mast cells by either inhibiting degranulation or blocking 
the action of the components that are released during mast cell 
degranulation (53). Histamine antagonists, ACE inhibitors, 
and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers are all drugs that inhibit 
components produced by mast cells. Other drugs that block 
individual components released during mast cell degranulation 
are still being investigated (47). Possible targets for inhibition

include protein kinase C, which is an important enzyme in the 
degranulation pathway (54).
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process that involves innate 
and adaptive immunity (55). During atheroma formation, 
increased numbers of T cells and macrophages are recruited to 
the vessel wall (56). Innate immunity involved identification 
of PAMPs, which generate an inflammatory response via the 
NFκB pathway (57). Microbial products can contribute to plaque 
growth. For example, LPS in Gram-negative bacteria can act on 
endothelial cells and activate TLR expressed on plaques (58). 
Angiotensin II has been shown to induce cytokine expression in 
atheroma-related cells (59). Leukocytes are targeted to the site of 
atheroma from chemokines. Mast cells are recruited to the site of 
atheroma by eotaxin (60). Macrophages and T cells outnumber 
mast cells in the atheroma. However, mast cells are important in 
activation of plaques due to their proteases, which are released 
leading to plaque rupture and acute coronary syndromes (58). 
Mast cells are also able to degrade the extracellular matrix of cells 
in the atheroma and modify lipoproteins (61). When a plaque is 
physically disrupted, a thrombus can form. Rupture of the fibrous 
cap of the plaque allows tissue factor from within the intima to 
come in contact with coagulation factors. Mast cell proteases 
degrade collagen in the fibrous cap of the plaque, which can lead 
to plaque rupture (58).
Unstable angina and myocardial infarctions are caused by rup-
ture of atherosclerotic plaques (62). Mast cells play a large role in 
the pathogenesis of plaque rupture and accumulate in the rupture 
prone region or human atheromas. Activated mast cells release 
tryptase and chymase, which are proteases that are found at the 
rupture site. Plaque destabilization in coronary arteries can occur 
from inflammatory response caused by mast cells. It is known 
that systemic activation of mast cells occurs during atherogenesis 
and results in increased progression of plaques in apoE-deficient 
mice (62). Mast cell stabilization by cromolyn has been shown to 
prevent pathophysiological events, such as plaque rupture (62). 
Systemic mast cell activation leads to plaque progression during 
atherogenesis as seen with treatment with dinitrophenyl-albumin 
(DNP), which causes activation in antigen-sensitized mast cells. 
When mast cells were challenged with DNP in mice, there was 
an increase in hemorrhage in the plaque. These findings are not 
seen in mast cells pretreated with cromolyn. This is consistent 
with findings in humans by Laine et al. (63) who showed that in 
mice treated with DNP, there was increase in apoptosis of intimal 
cells. Macrophage apoptosis was most often seen in the center of 
the atheroma. This leads to increase size of the necrotic core and 
release of apoptotic microbodies, which increase instability of the 
plaque and increase thrombosis. Protease inhibitors prevented 
macrophage apoptosis induced by mast cells. Additionally, 
macrophage apoptosis was completely inhibited by a H1 receptor 
antagonist. Mice treated with DNP also had increased vascular 
permeability, capillary leakage, and increased leukocyte adhe-
sion in the atherosclerotic plaques. Mast cell stabilization with 
cromolyn prevented acute coronary syndromes (62).
Inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, neutrophils, NK cells, 
monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, play a key role in the 
development and progression of atherosclerosis (64). LDL and 
LPS activate these inflammatory cells. Inflammatory cells respond 
to tissue injury, which results in an inflammatory process. Mast 
cells are found in all vascularized tissues except for the central 
nervous system and the retina. Mast cells are located in the intima 
of carotid arteries and in the shoulder region of atherosclerotic 
plaques. Mice deficient in FceRIa have decreased lipid deposi-
tion in the aortic arch in ApoE−/− mice (65). Reduction in lipid 
deposition was caused by a decrease in FceRIa-mediated mast 
cell activation and a decrease in inflammatory mediator release. 
LDL–IgG complexes have been recognized in plaques in animal 
model and can activate mast cells resulting in the release of IL-8, 
TNFα, histamine, and tryptase. Mast cells have also been shown 
to activate TLR4 that leads to smooth muscle cell apoptosis in the 
plaque resulting in plaque destabilization (66).
ApoE−/− mice show tryptase overexpression resulting in an 
increase in the area of carotid plaques and increase in carotid 
artery stenosis (64). Mast cell tryptase plays a role in leukocyte 
recruitment. Additionally, it increases MCP-1 and IL-8 produc-
tion that attracts monocytes and neutrophils in ApoE−/− mice 
(67). Tryptase increases foam cell formation by inhibiting activa-
tion of LXR-α and inhibiting reverse cholesterol transport (68). 
Tryptase can break down fibronectin and collagen type IV, which 
can result in plaque rupture and thrombosis. Mast cell chymase 
can also cause smooth muscle cell apoptosis resulting in destabi-
lization of the plaque (64).
Mast cells are also found in the media and adventitia of the 
aorta and contribute to development of aneurisms. Risk factors 
for abdominal aortic aneurisms (AAA) are male gender, advanced 
age, history of smoking, and atherosclerosis. In AAA, there is 
inflammation in the media and adventitia of the aorta versus ath-
erosclerotic disease, which is mostly found in the intima. During 
development of AAA, there is an imbalance of the matrix buildup 
and breakdown, which leads to weakening of the wall of the aorta 
and dilation of the aorta. There are many important cells involved 
in the development of AAA, which are neutrophils, smooth 
muscle cells, and aortic mast cells (69). Mast cells are involved in 
degradation of the extracellular matrix (by activation of metal-
loproteases), apoptosis of smooth muscle cells, and activation of 
the renin angiotensin system. Experimentally induced AAA in 
animals can be done with intra-aortic elastase infusion, topical 
treatment of aorta with CaCl2, or angiotensin infusion (70). 
Sun et al. showed that mast cell deficient mice did not develop 
AAA (71). Furthermore, rats deficient in mast cells had a lower 
response to CaCl2-induced AAA (72). Histamine, a major 
mediator of mast cells, activates JNK pathways. Phosphorylated 
JNK is increased in human AAA and this pathway accelerates 
degradation of the extracellular matrix. Many studies have shown 
that subcutaneous injection of angiotensin II causes AAA in 
animals. Patients treated with ACE inhibitors were less likely to 
be admitted for ruptured AAA (73). ACE inhibitors prevent AAA 
in rats infused with elastase (74). Tissue repair in AAA depends 
on smooth muscle cells that make collagen. However, in human 
AAA, mast cells can cause smooth muscle cell death by apoptosis 
via TNFα release. Granzyme B, also released by mast cells, can 
induce smooth muscle cell apoptosis (75). Additionally, chymase 
released by mast cell inhibits collagen synthesis from smooth

muscle cells. Drug targeting of mast cell mediators of AAA could 
help in treatment by inhibiting the growth of small AAA before 
they require surgery (70).
Increased numbers of mast cells are seen during the progres-
sion of atherosclerosis (76). They are predominately seen in the 
intima and adventitia. Mast cells are recruited to the plaque 
via chemokine CCL-11, which is expressed in the plaque, and 
CCR-2 which is expressed on the mast cell surface. Mast cells 
in plaque are located near microvessels (77, 78). When mast 
cells degranulate, they release histamine and matrix degrading 
proteases, which can cause microvessel leakiness and rupture 
leading to intraplaque hemorrhage. Mast cell activation during 
atherosclerosis was shown to increase the size of the plaque in 
the brachiocephalic artery of apoE-deficient mice (62). This 
response was prevented by administration of cromolyn. Another 
study showed that mast cell deficiency inhibited development 
of atherosclerotic plaque in LDL receptor-deficient mice (79). 
Mast cells can be seen as effector cells to induce plaque formation 
and progression. Overexpression of mast cell tryptase in mice 
had a greater risk of intraplaque hemorrhage (67). Additionally, 
a patient cohort study found that serum chymase levels were 
higher in patients with coronary heart disease. Chymase can 
modify HDL, affect cholesterol efflux ability, and also enhance 
the production of Angiotensin II, which is a proatherogenic 
factor. Chymase also induces apoptosis of vascular smooth 
muscle cells and endothelial cells (80–82). Activation of 
mast cells promotes enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages. 
Heparin-bound LDL is phagocytosed by macrophages to form 
foam cells (83, 84).
Mast cell activation during plaque development leads to 
progression and increased leukocyte infiltration and lipid accu-
mulation. The resulting leakiness of microvessels in advanced 
unstable lesions can lead to hemorrhage of the plaque or rupture 
of the fibrous cap. This can then result in thrombosis and acute 
cardiovascular events. Mast cell activation in the plaque can be 
through IgE-dependent or IgE-independent pathways. IgE levels 
are high in patients with angina pectoris (85). However, another 
study showed that plasma IgE levels did not correlate with dis-
ease progression or mast cell numbers in Western populations 
(86). This suggests that mast cell activation in the progression of 
atherosclerotic plaques may be initiated by another mechanism, 
such as plaque lipids, which can activate mast cells in the vessel 
wall. Another mechanism of activation is through C5a activation 
via C5aR on mast cells. Activated complement is found within the 
plaque. Activation of mast cells with C5a resulted in an increase in 
vein graft atherosclerosis, which was inhibited by cromolyn (87). 
Activation of mast cells can be accomplished via neuropeptides, 
such as substance P, as mast cells are in close proximity to nerve 
fibers. Use of mast cell stabilizers for halting plaque progression 
would be a reasonable treatment option (87).
Mast cells are increased in coronary arteries during spasm 
and in the rupture prone shoulders of coronary atheromas (63). 
Risk factors, such as oxidized LDL, reactive oxygen species, 
complement 5a, substance P, endothelin-1, and thrombin can 
activate mast cells (87–92). Mast cells synthesize and secrete 
histamine, proteases, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, heparin, 
and a variety of cytokines, many of which are implicated in 
CVD (36, 93–100). Furthermore, mast cells enhance endothe-
lial inflammatory responses through upregulation of innate 
immune mechanisms (101, 102). The clinical significance of 
mast cells in CVD is evident from their increased presence in 
the adventitia of coronary arteries of patients with atheroscle-
rosis (98, 103–107). An increase in the number of mast cells 
is also found to be associated with thrombus formation (108). 
Endothelial cells can endocytose MCG in vitro (107, 109) 
and in vivo (98). MCGs are also involved in the induction of 
human microvascular endothelial cell proliferation (110), LDL 
uptake by macrophages, and foam cell formation (111, 112). 
Although these findings suggest an important role for mast cells 
in CVD, the mechanism by which mast cell products promote 
atherogenesis and CVD is not well understood. Others and we 
have shown that mast cell deficiency attenuates progression 
of atherosclerosis in ApoE−/− (113) or LDLr−/− (79, 114) 
mice. Our data also show that mast cell deficiency significantly 
reduces serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, IL-6, and IL-10, the 
expression of COX2 in the aortic tissue, the systemic produc-
tion of PGI2, and infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes 
into the plaque in ApoE−/− mice (113).
Histamine is a major secretory product of the mast cell and 
is recognized for its role in the regulation of vasodilation and 
bronchoconstriction (115, 116). Histamine also regulates func-
tions of monocytes and macrophages (117, 118), eosinophils 
(117, 118), T cells (119), neutrophils, and endothelial cells (120, 
121). Depending on the cell types, histamine acts through a 
family of four distinct GPCR termed H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R 
(122). GPCR undergoes desensitization after phosphorylation 
by GPCR kinase (GRK) after stimulation by the agonist. GRKs 
are a group of seven mammalian serine and threonine protein 
kinases (123). GRK2 is one of the members of this group that 
is known to desensitize H1R and limits its signaling (124, 125). 
Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells highly express H1R 
and this receptor facilitates histamine-mediated inflammatory 
and hypersensitivity responses (121, 126). The clinical signifi-
cance of mast cell-derived histamine in CVD is evident from the 
finding that coronary arteries of patients with ischemic heart 
disease contain more mast cells and histamine than normal ves-
sels (103), and patients with variant angina have elevated levels of 
histamine in their coronary circulation (127). Our studies show 
that histamine acting through H1R stimulates the expression 
of TLR2, TLR4, IL6, COX2, PGI2s, and PGE2s genes leading to 
enhanced production of IL-6, PGE2, and PGI2 by HCAEC (121, 
128). Reports have suggested that histamine induces smooth 
muscle cell migration and proliferation (129, 130), and regulates 
intimal thickening model (131). In regard to H1R and athero-
sclerosis, increased H1R mRNA expression has been reported 
in smooth muscle cells of intima/media in the atheroma (132). 
Histamine also increases endothelial cell responses to TLR2 and 
TLR4 ligands by increasing the expression of these two innate 
immune receptors (121, 128, 133). We have also shown that LPS 
induces the expression of functionally active H1R in HCAEC, 
and enhances sensitivity to histamine (134). These findings 
suggest that histamine and bacterial agents act in a bidirectional 
manner amplifying inflammatory responses via upregulation of 
H1R and TLR2/TLR4 (Figure 2).

products. (A) Histamine secreted by the mast cell stimulates H1R on endothelial cells. (B) H1R-mediated endothelial cell activation leads to increased expression of 
TLR2 and TLR4, and become hyperresponsive to the TLR ligands leading to enhanced inflammatory response. (C) Increased TLR2 and TLR4 signaling increases 
H1R expression. Finally, collective actions of newly expressed TLR2/TLR4 and H1R lead to increased COX2 expression and other proinflammatory changes in the 
endothelium resulting in persistent vascular inflammation.

Histamine induces the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, and anti-atherogenic eicosanoids 
(PGI2 and PGE2) (121, 128, 133–135). Therefore, it is unclear 
whether H1R signaling of histamine is proatherogenic or car-
dioprotective. Some studies show that H1 antihistamines reduce 
atherogenesis in apoE-deficient mice (136, 137). Raveendran 
et al. examined apoE−/− mice treated with low or high cetirizine 
or fexofenadine doses and assessment of atherosclerotic plaques 
via histological section of the aorta (135). Increased atheroma 
formation and lesion area were noted in mice with low doses of 
cetirizine or fexofenadine. This was not associated with increased 
macrophage, mast cell, or T lymphocyte count. Reduction in the 
number of mast cells may be due to increased degranulation. 
However, high doses of cetirizine and fexofenadine did not 
increase atherosclerosis compared to the control. Ingestion of 
H1 antihistamines did not alter H1R expression in the plaque 
area as determined by immunofluorescence. At high doses, the 
antihistamines may bind to other receptors, such as H4R, which 
may result in the different response seen than binding H1R. 
Therefore, antihistamines continue to show a mixed picture 
with respect to atherosclerosis (135). It should be noted that the 
vasodilatory effects of histamine may promote lipid accumula-
tion in the vessel wall.
CONCLUSiON
In summary, mast cells play a key role in regulation of normal 
physiological processes as well as in many pathophysiological 
settings. Considerable progress has been made in our under-
standing of these immune cells in recent years. Additional 
efforts to define the complex interactions of mast cells will 
potentially lead to novel clinical approaches for many patho-
logical conditions.
