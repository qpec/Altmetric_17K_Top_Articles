A BSTRACT
Objective Given recent concerns regarding general 
practitioner (GP) workforce capacity, we aimed to  describe 
GPs’ career intentions, especially those which might 
impact on GP workforce availability over the next 5 years.
Design Census survey, conducted between April and 
June 2016 using postal and online responses , of all GPs 
on the National Health Service performers list and eligible 
to practise in primary care. Two reminders were used as 
necessary.
Setting South West England (population 3.5  million), a 
region with low overall socioeconomic deprivation.
Participants  Eligible GPs were 2248 out of 3370 (67 % 
response rate).
Main outcome measures Reported likelihood  of 
permanently leaving or reducing hours spent in  direct 
patient care or of taking a career break within the next 5 
years and present morale weighted for non-response.
Results Responders included 217 7 GPs engaged in 
patient care. Of these, 863 (37% weighted, 95%  CI 35 
% to 39 %) reported a high likelihood of quitting direct 
patient care within the next 5 years. Overall, 1535 
(70% weighted, 95%  CI 68 % to 72 %) respondents 
reported a career intention that would negatively impact 
GP workforce capacity over the next 5 years, through 
permanently leaving or reducing hours spent in direct 
patient care, or through taking a career break. GP age 
was an important predictor of career intentions; sharp 
increases in the proportion of GPs intending to quit patient 
care were evident from 52 years. Only 305 (14% weighted, 
95%  CI 13 % to 16 %) reported high morale, while 1195 
( 54 % weighted, 95%  CI 52 % to 56 %) reported low 
morale. Low morale was particularly common among GP 
partners. Current morale strongly predicted GPs’ career 
intentions; those with very low morale were particularly 
likely to report intentions to quit patient care or to take a 
career break.
Conclusions A substantial majority of GPs in South West 
England report low morale. Many are considering career 
intentions which, if implemented, would adversely impact 
GP workforce capacity within a short time period.

INTRODUCTION
UK healthcare has traditionally had a strong 
primary care base in which general practi-
tioners (GPs) have a central role in providing 
care across many settings, including within 
general practices, in out-of-hours care and in 
walk-in centres. Ninety per cent of UK National 
Health Service (NHS) patient contact takes 
place within primary care—1.3 million 
consultations every working day, 340 million 
consultations per year and with a projected 
primary care workload of 430 million consul-
tations per year by 2018.1 2 Around 74% of 
primary care contacts take place with a GP. 
General practice has been described as ‘the 
jewel in the crown’ of the NHS.3 GPs are 
trained and have particular abilities in the 
diagnosis and management of patients with 
complex multimorbidity.
UK general practice is, however, facing 
major problems regarding maintaining the

Research
Strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Census survey of all general practitioners (GPs) in 
South West England, providing a cross-sectional 
overview of quit and career break intentions.
 
► High response rate, reflecting both rigorous planning 
and implementation of the survey, and interest 
among GPs in the subject matter of workforce 
challenges.
 
► The potential for non-response bias was reduced 
by weighting estimates to account for differential 
response rates by age, gender and practice role.
 
► The survey was cross-sectional, rather than 
longitudinal in design; previous work demonstrates 
that intention to quit is a strong predictor of actually 
leaving.
 
► The research was undertaken within a rapidly 
changing GP workforce policy and practice 
environment.

GP workforce, with imminent GP shortages and a concom-
itant potential risk to patient care. A near quadrupling of 
unfilled GP posts was observed between 2010 and 2013 
(from 2.1% to 7.9%), associated with an overall reduction 
in the number of GPs in England from 62 per 100 000 
in 2009 to 59.5 in 2013.4 An estimated 12% of 2947 GP 
training places were unfilled in England in 2013/2014. 
These issues are compounded by an ageing GP workforce 
(30% of the 43 000 current GPs are over 50 years old4). 
Workforce issues are especially pertinent in inner city 
settings where recruitment and retention difficulties are 
further exacerbated by issues relating to the sociodemo-
graphic mix of the population and to increased demands 
for care.
Research commissioned by the British Medical Associa-
tion (BMA) has highlighted the continuing recruitment 
and retention challenges. In a 2014 study of 431 doctors 
from the 2006 cohort of medical graduates, those 
in general practice reported the lowest morale, with 
higher than expected workload being identified as a key 
problem.5 Of male doctors, 90% plan to work full time 
compared with just 40% of female doctors.4 Younger 
GPs currently appear to be more reluctant to take on 
the financial risks and responsibilities of becoming a 
partner in a practice, leading to existing partners expe-
riencing an increased workload.6 Recent surveys and 
reports have suggested that many GPs are considering 
permanently leaving direct patient care.1 4 7 Published 
evidence suggests that nearly half of GPs leaving general 
practice between 2009 and 2014 were under 50 years 
old.8
There is thus an urgent need to find ways of retaining 
the GP workforce. If unaddressed, ‘meltdown’ in NHS 
care may follow within the foreseeable future.1 The situ-
ation has been described as a ‘crisis’,9 10 and there has 
been a call for policies and strategies to help retain GPs 
in direct patient care.4 11 The future of NHS care over 
the next 5 years12 is likely to involve new models of care, 
with innovations involving increasing professional skill 
mix and new approaches to managing the service12 13 and 
in establishing federations of previously independent 
practices.12 It is vital that the GP workforce is sustained 
through this period of change.
Our research targets the critically important area of 
retention of experienced GPs in direct patient care, 
especially focussing on those GPs who may be consid-
ering retirement, and those GPs who have taken a 
career break (most often on account of family reasons). 
Following piloting of our questionnaire in 2015,14 this 
paper reports the findings of a recent census survey 
in which we aimed to describe GPs’ career intentions, 
especially those which might impact on GP workforce 
availability over the next 5 years. The survey consti-
tutes one part of a comprehensive programme of work, 
seeking to identify implementable policies and strategies 
to support the retention of experienced GPs in direct 
patient care and to support the return of GPs following 
a career break.
METHODS
Study sample
The sampling frame was the Medical Performers List of 
all GPs registered to practise in South West England, an 
area with a population of 3.5 million patients. National 
Performers List provides reassurance for the public that 
GPs, dentists and opticians practising in the NHS are suit-
ably qualified, have up-to-date training, regulatory checks 
and appropriate English language skills.15 There were no 
exclusion criteria. The survey was administered between 
April and June 2016.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was based on that used within earlier 
work,14 modified to increase the number of questions 
from 11 to 24, including rewording of four questions to 
reflect alignment of wording with other questionnaires 
of broadly similar intent and by providing clear defini-
tions for key concepts in the questionnaire including a 
career break, taking steps towards changing work–life 
balance and defining a clinical session. The questionnaire 
(see online supplementary material) comprised items 
that asked GPs about their career intentions, reporting 
on the likelihood that they would permanently leave 
direct patient care within the next 2 years or within the 
next 5 years. GPs were also asked to report the likelihood 
that they would take a career break within the next 5 years 
or that they would reduce their weekly average hours 
spent in direct patient care during this time period. GPs 
rated the likelihood of these events from ‘very likely’ to 
‘very unlikely’ using a four-point scale. The questionnaire 
also included a question about current level of morale 
and captured general demographic data: gender, age, 
ethnicity, region and year of graduation and current GP 
employment status (eg, partner, salaried), number and 
pattern of sessions worked in a typical week and involve-
ment in delivering out-of-hours care.
Data collection
GPs were sent study materials through the post either to 
their practice or home address, and also by email, where 
available. The questionnaire was available for completion 
by post and online. The survey was supported by a compre-
hensive strategy of publicising the research through 
routine newsletters and circulars of relevant organisa-
tions and networks, including local medical committees, 
clinical research networks, Health Education England 
South West, the Royal College of General Practitioners, 
University of Exeter Medical School and the South West 
Academic Health Science Network.
If a GP returned multiple online or postal surveys, 
only the first response received by the research team 
was analysed. Postal response data were double entered 
and discrepancy checking was undertaken. Response 
data were stored securely and without participant name 
or address.

Patient involvement
Although the study participants were GPs rather than 
patients, patient representatives contributed to the 
design of the survey. The planned work was presented to 
the wider project’s Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) 
group,16 by way of sharing the process and to check the 
integrity of the work, and the group provided supportive 
feedback. The survey results were presented at a project 
management group meeting, which included PPI repre-
sentatives who directly contributed to interpreting and 
contextualising the results.
Statistical analysis
Differential response rates between different groups of 
GPs would potentially introduce bias into crude survey 
findings. To counter this, we employed non-response 
weights. Inverse probability weights were calculated 
based on three factors: age (<40, 40–49, 50–54, 55–59 and 
60 years and over), gender (male and female) and role 
(partner, salaried and locum/other). By employing these 
weights, we estimated what responses we would have 
received with a 100% response rate under the assumption 
that non-responders would have responded similarly to 
GPs of the same age, gender and role. Logistic regression 
was used to investigate the association between responses 
to questions regarding future career intentions (perma-
nently leaving direct patient care within the next 2 and 
5 years, taking a career break within the next 5 years and 
reducing average hours spent in direct patient care within 
the next 5 years). Each of the four sets of responses was 
dichotomised into ‘very likely’ and ‘likely’ versus other 
responses. Initially, unadjusted associations were exam-
ined for effects attributable to the explanatory factors 
of gender, age, country of qualification, ethnicity, role/
position and rating of current morale. Subsequently, 
regression models adjusting simultaneously for all 
explanatory factors were used to examine adjusted asso-
ciations. Similar models were used with reported morale 
as the outcome (but not including morale as an explana-
tory factor). Regression analyses were restricted to those 
respondents with complete data on gender, age, country 
of qualification, ethnicity, role/position and rating of 
current morale.
Supplementary analysis
Interactions were explored between various factors in the 
models. While some of these were found to be statistically 
significant, the magnitude of the interaction terms was 
generally small and did not alter the interpretation of the 
data, with one exception commented on in the results. 
For this reason, we have not reported the more complex 
interaction models here.
In addition, we considered the possibility that some 
groups of GPs, for example female GPs, may not report 
the intention to reduce hours spent in direct patient care 
because they already work fewer hours, on average, than 
other groups. We therefore performed two supplemen-
tary analyses, including either a binary variable indicating 
part-time working (defined as working less than eight 
sessions per week) or a continuous variable detailing the 
reported number of sessions worked per week.
All analyses were performed in Stata V.14.2.
RESULTS
Questionnaires were distributed by post to 3370 GPs, with 
1841 (55%) of these GPs also being sent the question-
naire by email, where we had a valid email address (see 
online supplementary table 1). Completed questionnaires 
were received from 2248/3370 GPs who were surveyed 
(response rate 67%). Of the 2248 GP respondents, 673 
(30%) used the online survey. Response rates were as high 
for both men and women (67% and 66% respectively). 
Participation was lower among GPs aged under 40 years 
(54%) when compared with the older GPs aged 50 and 
over (in excess of 68% in each age group) and was lower 
for salaried GPs (57%) when compared with GP partners 
(71%) and non-principal/locum GPs (64%).
The median age of respondents was 48 years (table 1; 
IQR 40 to 55, range 28 to 84 years). Eighty-five per cent of 
respondents reported having a practice with which they 
were primarily affiliated; 25% of respondents reported 
that they were involved in the delivery of out-of-hours 
primary medical care. The majority (62%) of respon-
dents were partners in their practices.
Career intentions
Of the 2248 responding GPs, 55 had already perma-
nently left direct patient care; 16 had selected ‘none of 
the above’ to reflect their working status in direct patient 
care—that is, that they were not currently working in 
direct patient care nor on a career break, but had not 
permanently quit—and were removed from further anal-
ysis. Differential response by age and role meant that GP 
groups reporting an intention to quit direct patient care 
were somewhat over-represented, introducing a small 
bias into the crude results which is accounted for in the 
weighted percentages.
Of the 2177 GP participants included in the anal-
ysis, 473 (weighted percentage 20.3%, 95% CI 18.7% to 
22.0%) reported a high likelihood of quitting direct 
patient care (‘likely’ or ‘very likely’) within the next 
2 years and 863 (weighted percentage 36.8%, 95% CI 
34.8% to 38.8%) within the next 5 years (table 2). There 
were 1252 (weighted percentage 56.7%, 95% CI 54.6% to 
58.8%) participants who reported being likely or very 
likely to reduce hours, and 770 (weighted percentage 
36.3%, 95% CI 34.3% to 38.4%) who reported the 
intention to take a career break within the next 5 years. 
Considered together, 1535 (weighted percentage 70.0%, 
95% CI 68.0% to 71.9%) participants reported that they 
were likely/very likely to pursue a career intention (one 
or more of the four presented) that would potentially 
adversely impact the workforce available in South West 
England within the next 5 years. The majority of partic-
ipants also had low morale, with a substantially greater

proportion of participants (1195; weighted percentage 
54.4%, 95% CI 52.3% to 56.5%) reporting ‘low’ or ‘very 
low’ levels of morale compared with only 305 (weighted 
percentage 14.2%, 95% CI 12.8% to 15.8%) reporting 
‘high’ or ‘very high’ morale.
Associations between GP characteristics and career 
intentions/morale
Figure 1 illustrates the reported intention to quit direct 
patient care of responding GPs broken down by gender 
and each year of GP age, aggregating likely and very likely 
responses together. Reported quit intentions are strongly 
related to age, remaining low (<20%) among younger 
GPs (45 years and under) for quitting direct patient care 
in both of the next 2 and 5 years. Both of these outcomes 
show a sharp rise from the age of 52 years, with the propor-
tion stating they were likely to quit in 5 years rising to 
almost 90% by the age of 56 years. The proportion antici-
pating taking a career break as ‘likely’ was highest for the 
youngest GPs, especially among younger women where 
nearly 9 out of 10 female GPs aged 30 years reported the 
intention to take a career break, presumably on account 
of anticipated maternity leave.
Of the 2177 respondents reporting that their current 
role involved direct patient care, 2119 (97%) provided 
complete information on gender, age, region of qualifica-
tion, ethnicity, role/position and rating of current morale 
and were included in the regression analyses. Tables 3 
and 4 show the results of the unadjusted and adjusted 
logistic regression analyses, respectively, for career inten-
tions. In unadjusted analyses, there is strong evidence 
(p<0.001 for all) that gender and role are associated 
with being likely to report the intention to leave patient 
care within both 2 and 5 years, with female GPs being 
less likely to quit patient care than male GPs (OR 0.55, 
95% CI 0.46 to 0.66 for leaving patient care in 5 years) 
and with locum GPs being the most likely to quit patient 
care and salaried GPs least likely. However, these associ-
ations are likely be confounded, for example by the fact 
younger doctors were more likely to be female compared 
with older doctors. Once adjustment is made for all other 
factors, the effects of these characteristics on intentions 
to quit are no longer significant. However, after adjust-
ment for other variables, women were still substantially 
less likely to report intending to reduce hours spent in 
direct patient care (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.71), and 
locum GPs remained more likely to report intending to 
take a career break when compared with GPs in other 
roles.
Age was a very strong predictor of reported intention 
to leave direct patient care, a finding which persisted 
after adjustment (for example 60–69 vs 40–49 year olds 
OR=194.4 95% CI 84.3 to 448.3 for leaving patient care in 
five years). Age was also a strong predictor of the inten-
tion to reduce hours in the adjusted model, with older 
GPs more likely to report this intention than younger 
GPs. Female GPs, GPs aged under 40 years and locum 
GPs were most likely to report the intention to take a 
career break after adjustment for other factors. A model 
including an interaction between age and gender showed 
that the effect of under 40 year olds being more likely to 
report intentions to take a career break was strongest in 
female GPs, consistent with the pattern shown in figure 1 
(results not shown).
Self-reported morale was a strong predictor of all four 
outcomes shown in tables 2 and 3. In the unadjusted 
analysis, a ‘U-shaped’ relationship is seen for all four 
quitting outcomes, with those with ‘very high’ morale 
more likely to report intentions to leave direct patient

care/reduce hours/take a career break than those with 
‘high’ or ‘neither low nor high’ morale (and in the case 
of leaving patient care in 2 years, more likely than any 
other morale category) but less likely to intend to leave/
reduce hours/take a career break than those with ‘very 
low’ morale. This U-shaped relationship largely disap-
pears however after adjustment, and it is those GPs with 
‘very low’ morale who are most likely to report intending 
to leave direct patient care, reduce hours in patient care 
or to take a career break. Moreover, the change in odds 
between ‘low’ and ‘very low’ morale is particularly strong. 
Table 5 shows the results of the logistic regression anal-
ysis modelling of factors associated with low or very low 
morale. Only age and practice role show any evidence 
of being associated with reported morale (p<0.001 for 
both). Those aged 50–54 years old are most likely to 
report low morale. In respect of role, GP partners are the 
most likely to report low morale, followed by salaried GPs 
and with locums and other GPs the least likely groups to 
report low morale.

Supplementary analyses exploring the contribution of 
current working patterns to any association with intentions 
to reduce hours spent in direct patient care did explain 
some of the difference between genders. However, even 
after adjustment for current working patterns, female 
GPs were still substantially less likely to report intentions 
to reduce hours spent in direct patient care than their 
male counterparts (not shown).
DISCUSSION
Main findings
A high proportion of GPs—around two in every five—
currently working within direct patient care in South 
West England reported an intention to permanently quit 
direct patient care within the next 5 years, this being one 
in five within the next 2 years. Further depletion of the GP 
workforce in this region of England through reduction of 
weekly average hours or through taking a career break 
within the next 5 years also emerged as an impending 
risk. Overall, 7 out of every 10 GPs in this region reported 
a career intention which, if implemented, would adversely 
impact the GP workforce capacity in South West England 
through GPs leaving direct patient care, reducing hours 
spent in direct patient care or by taking a career break 
within the next 5 years.
Older age is highly predictive of a GP’s intentions to 
permanently quit direct patient care and to reduce hours. 
The intention to quit was independent of the GP’s role 
(partner, salaried or locum) and gender. The gender 
differences observed among younger GPs in respect of 
intended career breaks is a particular issue where, as 
currently exists, 69% of the GP trainee workforce are 
female,17 and where a substantial proportion of younger 
women returning to clinical care do so on the basis of 
reduced hours1 and where doctors who wish to return to 
clinical practice may face significant bureaucratic obsta-
cles in doing so.18 The decision to reduce hours or to take 
a career break varied with employment status, with locum 
GPs being most likely to report intentions to reduce 
hours or to take a career break. In a situation where GPs 
who are not partners in a practice do in fact leave direct 
patient care, the system of care appears vulnerable, with 
added strain likely to be placed on GPs who are partners 
in their practice.
A key issue is whether the intention to leave is translated 
into reality, and few studies have explored this important

question. However, Hann et al19 explored this question 
among nearly 1200 UK GPs followed up over 5 years, and 
identified a strong relationship between a stated intention 
to leave patient care and actually doing so, reflected in a 
4.5-fold difference in odds of leaving between those with 
no stated intention to leave patient care when compared 
with those reporting a high intention to do so.
The majority of responding GPs in our study reported 
low morale, with less than 15% reporting high morale. 
GP morale was identified as an important predictor of 
future career intentions, particularly when morale was 
very low.
Strengths and limitations of the study
By ensuring alignment of wording with other surveys of 
similar intent allows the opportunity for comparing and 
contrasting of results. Recent high-quality surveys support 
our estimate of the proportion of GPs intending to leave 
general practice within the next 5 years.14 20–22 Unlike 
most other similar surveys which tend to survey samples of 
GPs,7 23 we undertook a census survey of all GPs currently 
eligible to provide patient care across a large area, 
providing a cross-sectional overview of the quit intentions 
of all GPs in South West England. The response rate was 
high (67%), reflecting both rigorous planning and imple-
mentation of the survey and interest among GPs in the 
subject matter of workforce challenges. Further, we have 
reduced the potential for non-response bias by weighting 
our estimates to account for differential response rates 
by age, gender and practice role. The overall programme 
of work, of which this survey is one element, includes the 
planned development of a predictive risk modelling tool 
to enumerate risk of future workforce undersupply at 
local levels, thus offering the potential of providing data 
that will be of value to healthcare planners and policy 
makers. In addition, our study relates to a key current 
area of national interest and concern.
The study has a number of limitations. The survey was 
conducted among GPs in a single region of England 
which may not be entirely typical of England as a whole, 
for example in respect of population mix and practice 
setting.24 The region is often informally regarded as 
having desirable living and working conditions.25 It seems 
likely that other regions of England, with more inner-city 
areas with higher levels of deprivation, are likely to face 
even greater challenges in respect of the GP workforce 
than in the findings we have presented here. A further 
limitation is that the research was undertaken within a 
rapidly changing GP workforce policy environment, for 
example, the implementation in 2015–2016 of a 10-point 
plan agreed between authoritative UK health, govern-
mental and professional bodies concerned about GP 
workforce issues.26 Finally, this survey was cross-sectional, 
rather than longitudinal in design, and so we are unable 
to report on the actual translation of GPs’ reported career 
intentions into actual career decisions, although previous 
work has demonstrated intention to quit to be a strong 
predictor of actually leaving.19
Implications for research
Our survey is part of a multimethod suite of work commis-
sioned by the NHS, seeking to inform evidence-based 
policies and strategies in a key area of national concern 
and which will involve stakeholder consultations with 
policy makers who have oversight of GP workforce plan-
ning.16 Future research should include assessment of 
the predictive validity of GPs’ reported career intentions 
by longitudinal follow-up of GPs, investigation of how 
reducing hours or better flexible working arrangements 
may influence GP retention and undertaking research 
exploring the potential for extended clinical roles among 
important allied healthcare professionals in the clinical 
workforce. Such groups might include nurses, physiother-
apists and pharmacists, and developing such extended 
roles for these professionals within the primary care team 
may offer a rapid and potentially effective contribution 
to the alleviation of current GP workforce pressures. 
Research into the determinants and impact of working 
reduced hours should also encompass other aspects of 
flexible working arrangements in general practice, and 
how such arrangements may improve job satisfaction 
and work–life balance and thereby potentially increase 
GP retention in the longer term. This work also provides 
insight into which groups of GPs might best be targeted 
with interventions aiming to improve workforce reten-
tion.
Implications for policy and practice
Concerns regarding the GP workforce are now recognised 
widely by authoritative bodies in the UK, leading to recent 
policy statements and initiatives26 and to the establish-
ment of a Primary Care Workforce Commission by Health 
Education England.4 Our research can inform this policy 
agenda by providing an estimate of the likely proportion 
of South West GPs intending to leave direct patient care 
within the next 5 years through permanently quitting 
patient care or by taking a career break. Our findings 
are likely to be of relevance in other areas of England 
that may face even greater challenges in respect of the 
GP workforce. Retaining the direct patient care capacity 
of established GPs represents an immediate challenge for 
healthcare planners. Recognising and addressing issues 
of low GP morale is an area of importance, and addressing 
the issue may improve how GPs feel about their work and 
potentially be associated with improvements in patients’ 
experience of the care received.27 In the face of problems 
recruiting to general practice28 and the wider workforce 
problems, the UK government recently announced an 
increase in the number of training places for GPs26 and 
an increase in the number of medical training places 
in the UK.29 But these medium-term to long-term solu-
tions do not address the immediate workforce crisis. In 
contrast, policy initiatives to support the retention of the 
existing GP workforce, the rapid development of and 
support for new models of care and the implementation 
of policies aimed at alleviating workload pressures for 
GPs are potential short-term to medium-term solutions

which need to be urgently considered. Developing and 
implementing relevant policies and strategies to achieve 
those ambitions will be important for the alleviation of 
the immediate pressures faced by the GP workforce and 
the populations of patients they serve.
CONCLUSIONS
Healthcare in England faces imminent challenges in 
respect of GP workforce capacity. This survey identifies 
the magnitude of the problem in South West England 
and highlights the important role of GP morale as one 
important factor contributing to that challenge. Acknowl-
edgement of the magnitude of the problems is urgently 
required, along with implementation and monitoring 
of relevant policy and strategy. Failure to do so will risk 
serious adverse effects on the capacity and ability of the 
NHS to provide effective primary care to the UK popula-
tion.
