 Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) is still not well understood. Structural brain differences
have been associated with BD, but results from neuroimaging studies have been inconsistent. To address this, we performed the
largest study to date of cortical gray matter thickness and surface area measures from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of
6503 individuals including 1837 unrelated adults with BD and 2582 unrelated healthy controls for group differences while also
examining the effects of commonly prescribed medications, age of illness onset, history of psychosis, mood state, age and sex
differences on cortical regions. In BD, cortical gray matter was thinner in frontal, temporal and parietal regions of both brain
hemispheres. BD had the strongest effects on left pars opercularis (Cohen’s d = − 0.293; P = 1.71 × 10 − 21), left fusiform gyrus
(d = − 0.288; P = 8.25 × 10 − 21) and left rostral middle frontal cortex (d = − 0.276; P = 2.99 × 10 − 19). Longer duration of illness (after
accounting for age at the time of scanning) was associated with reduced cortical thickness in frontal, medial parietal and occipital
regions. We found that several commonly prescribed medications, including lithium, antiepileptic and antipsychotic treatment
showed significant associations with cortical thickness and surface area, even after accounting for patients who received multiple
medications. We found evidence of reduced cortical surface area associated with a history of psychosis but no associations with
mood state at the time of scanning. Our analysis revealed previously undetected associations and provides an extensive analysis of
potential confounding variables in neuroimaging studies of BD.

INTRODUCTION
Bipolar disorder (BD) is among the most debilitating psychiatric
disorders and affects 1–3% of the adult population worldwide.1,2 BD
is known to be highly heritable with individual risk depending
partially on genetics.3,4 However, the underlying neurobiological
mechanism of the disorder remains unclear. The prognosis for
individuals with BD is mixed: currently approved medications are
ineffective for many patients.5–8 Treatment regimens for patients
with BD include several different medication types, including
lithium, antiepileptics, antipsychotics and antidepressants.2 Some of
the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with BD—
including lithium9–12 and antiepileptics13—have also been asso-
ciated with structural brain differences, but the scope of these
effects have not been systematically investigated. Many individuals
with BD are initially misdiagnosed14 and may receive inappropriate
treatments15–17 before presenting symptoms distinguishable from
those of related disorders, such as major depressive disorder.
Examinations of consistently detected, BD-specific structural
brain abnormalities will increase our neurobiological understand-
ing of the illness. Relative to matched controls, BD patients show
alterations in cortical thickness, surface area and the overall gray
matter volume18,19 measures that relate to functional impairments
in
cognition,
behavior
and
symptom
domains.20,21
Cortical
thickness and surface area are highly heritable22,23 and may be
affected by largely distinct sets of genes.24,25 By examining
regional
cortical
thickness
and
surface
area
differences
in
individuals with BD relative to healthy controls, we may identify
biologically meaningful markers of disease.
Brain abnormalities associated with BD are challenging to
identify, as BD is notoriously heterogeneous in symptom profile
and cycles.14 A retrospective literature-based meta-analysis of
cortical
thickness26
found
that
the
most
consistent
diffe-
rences between individuals with BD and healthy controls were
reduced

in
the
left
anterior
cingulate,27–32
left
paracingulate,27–30,32,33 left superior temporal gyrus27,28,32–35 and
prefrontal regions bilaterally.27–29,32–34,36,37 Reports of surface area
abnormalities associated with BD are mixed, and the largest study
to date (N = 346) failed to detect surface area differences between
BD cases versus controls.33 Overall, there remains considerable
uncertainty about the direction and anatomical profile of effects:
many studies report no effect in specific cortical regions or
significant effects in brain regions inconsistent with prior studies.
Therefore, our understanding of BD cortical changes could be
improved through a large-scale coordinated and harmonized
analysis of the vast amounts of existing data to map brain
differences in heterogeneous patient populations worldwide.
We formed the Bipolar Disorder Working Group within the
ENIGMA Consortium38,39 with the overarching goal of identifying
consistent brain alterations associated with BD and elucidating
and controlling for moderating factors that may affect the
pathophysiology of BD. This new effort builds upon our previous
effort looking at subcortical differences associated with BD40 and
examines structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
clinical data from 6503 individuals (2447 of which were BD
patients) with the aim of identifying differences in cortical regions
consistently associated with BD with unprecedented power. In this
large sample, we sought to examine effects of: (1) diagnosis, (2)
age and sex, (3) subtype diagnosis, (4) duration of illness, (5)
medication differences, (6) history of psychosis, and (7) mood
state in adults and adolescents/young adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
The ENIGMA BD Working Group includes 28 international groups with
brain MRI scans and clinical data from BD patients and healthy controls.
Overall, we analyzed data from 6503 people, including 2447 BD patients
and 4056 healthy controls (including 1837 unrelated adult patients with BD
compared with 2582 unrelated adult healthy controls). Each cohort’s
demographics are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Supplementary
Table S2 gives the instrument used to obtain diagnosis and medication
information and Supplementary Table S3 lists exclusion criteria for study
enrolment. All participating sites obtained approval from their local
institutional
review
boards
and
ethics
committees,
and
all
study
participants provided written informed consent.
Image processing and analysis
Structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans were acquired at each site and
analyzed locally using harmonized analysis and quality-control protocols

 from the ENIGMA consortium that have previously been applied in large-
scale studies of major depression.41 Image acquisition parameters and
software descriptions are given in Supplementary Table S4. Cortical
segmentations and parcellations for each cohort were created with the
freely
available
and
validated
segmentation
software,
FreeSurfer.42
Segmentations of 68 (34 left and 34 right) cortical gray matter regions
were created based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas43 (as well as the
hemispheric total surface area and average cortical thickness). Segmented
regions were visually inspected and statistically evaluated for outliers
following standardized ENIGMA protocols (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/proto
cols/imaging-protocols). Individual sites were provided with examples of
good/poor segmentation across the cortex. Diagnostic histogram plots
were generated for each site and outlier subjects were flagged for further
review (shared with DPH).
Statistical models of cortical differences
We examined group differences in cortical thickness and pial surface area
between patients and controls using mixed-effect models, accounting for
site as a random effect. Our focus was to examine differences in adults
(defined as ⩾ 25 years at the time of scanning) and separately cortical
differences in adolescents/young adults (defined as o25 years at the time
of scanning). In the analysis of adults, the outcome measures were from
each of the 70 cortical region of interests (ROIs; 68 regions and two whole-
hemisphere average thickness or total surface area measures). A binary
indicator of diagnosis (0 = controls, 1 = patients) was the predictor of
interest. All cortical thickness models were adjusted for age and sex; all
cortical surface area models were corrected for intracranial volume, age,
sex, age-by-sex, age-squared and age-squared-by-sex to account for any
higher-order effects on cortical surface area of age and sex as well as head
size, which do not appear to be detectable for cortical thickness
measures.44 Effect size estimates were calculated using the Cohen’s
d metric computed from the t-statistic of the diagnosis indicator variable
from the regression models. Similarly, for models testing interactions the
predictor of interest was the product of two variables (that is, sex-by-
diagnosis and age-by-diagnosis), with the main effect of each predictor
included in the model. The effect size was calculated using the same
procedure. In cases where the predictor of interest was a continuous
variable (for example, duration of illness), we calculated the Pearson’s r
effect size from the t-statistic of the predictor in the regression model.
Throughout the manuscript, we report uncorrected P-values, with a
significance threshold over all tests in the study determined by the false
discovery rate procedure at q = 0.05.45
We further examined patient-specific clinical characteristics, including
diagnosis subtype, medication, duration of illness, history of psychosis and
mood state at the time of scanning for effects on cortical thickness and
surface area. Patients with a subtype diagnosis of BD type 1 or type 2 were
compared with each other using the same statistical framework detailed
above. Information on the instrument used for subtype diagnosis is
available in Supplementary Table S2. Medications at the time of scanning
(not including past medication exposure) were grouped into five major
categories (lithium, antidepressants, antiepileptics, atypical and typical
antipsychotics) and were jointly examined for effects on cortical thickness
and surface area, within the same model. More specifically, we created a
series of binary indicator variables for each medication type where a given
subject was either 1—taking the medication—or 0—not taking the
medication. All medication variables were included as predictors in a
model (in addition to the confounding variables listed previously) with a
cortical thickness or surface area measure as the outcome of interest. From
this model, we were able to examine each medication predictor for its
effect on a given cortical trait after accounting for all other medications.
We also examined the effect of duration of illness, defined as the
difference between age at the time of scan and age at first diagnosis. To
minimize the likelihood of spurious correlations due to the high correlation
between duration of illness and age at scan, while still being able to
examine brain differences associated with illness duration, we performed a
hierarchical regression with two levels. First, we used a multiple linear
regression model with all potential confounding variables included and a
given cortical thickness or surface area trait as the outcome. Next, we used
a mixed-effect model with the residuals of the first model included as the
outcome of interest, duration of illness as the predictor of interest and site
as a random effect. We calculated effect-size estimates for each cortical
trait from the t-statistics in this second model. We examined patient-
specific differences in the cortex of BD patients with a lifetime history of
psychosis. Patients with a history of psychosis were coded as 1 and those
without were coded as 0. Mood state at the time of scanning, either
euthymic or depressed (other mood states such as manic, hypomanic and
mixed had insufficient numbers to perform a comparison), was examined
for differential effects on the cortices of BD patients. In the comparison,
euthymic patients were coded as 0 and depressed patients were coded as
1. Effect-size statistics were calculated as stated previously. Finally, we
examined potential sources of bias based on imaging acquisition and
analysis parameters, including field strength, voxel volume and FreeSurfer
version.
Field
strength
and
FreeSurfer
version
were
assessed
for
significance using a partial F-test where the full model included a factor
with the imaging parameters in addition to the full set of covariates
described above and the reduced model contained only the full set of
covariates. Voxel volume was assessed directly for effect on cortical
thickness and surface area and effect sizes were estimated based on the
Pearson’s r of the voxel volume predictor in a model including the full set
of covariates mentioned above.
RESULTS
Widespread cortical thinning associated with BD in adults
We found a significant and widespread pattern of reduced cortical
thickness associated with BD (1837 BD patients, 2582 controls;
Figure 1) with the largest effects in the left pars opercularis
(Cohen’s
d = − 0.293;
P = 1.71 × 10 − 21),
left
fusiform
gyrus
(d = − 0.288; P = 8.25 × 10 − 21) and left rostral middle frontal cortex
(d = − 0.276; P = 2.99 × 10 − 19). Large effects on average thickness
over the left and right hemispheres were also present (d = − 0.325;
P = 2.86 × 10 − 25; d = − 0.303; P = 3.35 × 10 − 22, respectively). Full
results for the analysis of cortical thickness are presented in
Table 1. We did not detect significant differences in cortical
surface area ROIs associated with BD in adults (Supplementary
Table S5). Further, we did not detect significant differences in
cortical thickness or surface area ROIs (Supplementary Tables S7
and S8) for the sex-by-diagnosis interaction. We found evidence of
an age-by-diagnosis interaction showing reduced surface area of
the left posterior cingulate cortex (d = − 0.100; P = 0.00112) with
increasing age. No other significant differences in cortical
thickness or surface area for the age-by-diagnosis interaction
were detected (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10).
No significant cortical thickness or surface area differences
between BD subtypes
We compared 1275 unrelated, adult patients diagnosed with BD
type 1 with 345 unrelated, adult patients diagnosed with BD type
2. We did not detect significant differences in cortical thickness or
surface area ROIs associated with subtype (Supplementary Tables
S11 and S12).
Significant association of duration of illness on cortical thickness
but not surface area
We
found
a
broad
pattern
of
reduced
cortical
thickness
significantly associated with longer illness duration with the
strongest effects in the left and right pericalcarine gyrus (Pearson’s
r = − 0.129; P = 1.35 × 10 − 6; r = − 0.123; P = 3.96 × 10 − 6), left rostral
anterior cingulate gyrus (r = − 0.091; P = 6.09 × 10 − 4) and right
cuneus (r = − 0.090; P = 7.44 × 10 − 4) and evidence of significantly
increased thickness in the right entorhinal gyrus (r = 0.089;
P = 9.19 × 10 − 4; Figure 2; Supplementary Table S13). Cortical
surface area ROIs in adult BD patients were not significantly
associated with illness duration (Supplementary Table S14).
Widespread effects on cortical thickness and surface area
associated with commonly prescribed medications in adults
diagnosed with BD
We examined cortical thickness and surface area differences
associated with five major medication families: lithium, antiepi-
leptics, antidepressants, and typical and atypical antipsychotics in

 adult patients with BD. We found significant evidence of increased
cortical thickness associated with taking lithium (n = 700; com-
pared with those not taking lithium n = 892), with the largest
effects in the left paracentral gyrus (d = 0.211; P = 7.96 × 10 − 5) and
the left and right superior parietal gyrus (d = 0.202; P = 1.60 × 10 − 4;
d = 0.188; P = 4.39 × 10 − 4) (Figure 3; Supplementary Table S15).
We also found evidence of increased surface area in the
left
paracentral
lobule
(d = 0.17;
P = 0.0015;
Supplementary
Table S16).
In the patient group, reduced cortical thickness was associated
with antiepileptic treatment (n = 576 compared with patients not
taking antiepileptics n = 932), with the largest effects in the left
and right lateral occipital gyrus (d = − 0.360; P = 5.35 × 10 − 11;
d = − 0.357;
P = 7.24 × 10 − 11)
and
right
paracentral
gyrus
(d = − 0.326; P = 2.57 × 10 − 9) (Figure 4; Supplementary Table S17).
Cortical surface area was not significantly
associated with
antiepileptic treatment for any ROI (Supplementary Table S18).
Increased cortical surface area was associated with typical
antipsychotic treatment (n = 78 compared with patients not taking
typical antipsychotics n = 1419) in the left middle temporal gyrus
(d = 0.439; P = 2.83 × 10 − 4), left inferior parietal gyrus (d = 0.366;
P = 0.00213) and right temporal pole (d = 0.382; P = 0.00147;
Supplementary Table S20). We did not detect any significant
associations between cortical thickness and typical antipsychotic
treatment (Supplementary Table S19).
We found significant evidence of reduced cortical surface area
associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment (n = 504 com-
pared with patients not taking atypical antipsychotics n = 994) in
the right rostral middle frontal gyrus (d = − 0.199; P = 4.00 × 10 − 4)
and right superior frontal gyrus (d = − 0.187; P = 8.61 × 10 − 4;
Supplementary Table S22). We did not detect significant associa-
tions between cortical thickness and atypical antipsychotic
treatment (see Supplementary Table S21).
We did not detect any significant association between in
cortical thickness (Supplementary Table S23) or surface area
(Supplementary Table S24) and antidepressant treatment.
Association of cortical surface area with history of psychosis and
mood state findings at the time of scanning
When comparing 768 adult BD patients with a history of psychosis
with 619 patients without a history of psychosis, we found
evidence of reduced surface area in the right frontal pole of BD
patients with a history of psychosis (d = − 0.167; P = 0.0023). We
did not detect differences in cortical thickness or surface area in
any other regions of interest (Supplementary Tables S25 and S26).
Further, we did not detect differences in cortical thickness or
surface area when comparing patients who were depressed at the
time of scanning (n = 210) with patients who were euthymic at the
time of scanning (n = 819) (Supplementary Tables S27 and S28).
Comparisons with other mood states such as hypomanic, manic
and mixed were not possible due to small sample sizes.
Association of cortical thickness and surface area with BD in
adolescents/young adults/young adults
We compared cortical thickness and surface area between 411
adolescent/young adult patients diagnosed with BD and 1035
healthy adolescents/young adults/young adults (mean age: 21.1
years ± 3.1 s.d.; age of onset: 20.3 ± 9.5 years; and age range: 8–
24.9 years). We found significantly reduced thickness in the right
supramarginal gyrus (d = − 0.195; P = 0.00102) and reduced surface
area in the left insula (d = − 0.184; P = 0.00196) (Supplementary
Tables S29 and S30) measures. We found a broad pattern of
significant interactions between age and diagnosis whereby older
BD patients had reduced cortical thickness beyond the effects of
age and diagnosis, with the strongest effect observed in the left
rostral middle frontal gyrus (d = − 0.264; P = 8.83 × 10 − 6). We
further found evidence of an interaction between sex and
diagnosis
in the
frontal
and
temporal
lobe
gyri
whereby
adolescent/young adult female BD patients showed less thinning
than could be explained by sex and diagnosis with the strongest
effect in the right pars triangularis (d = 0.264; P = 8.56 × 10 − 6). Fully
tabulated results for the age-by-diagnosis and sex-by-diagnosis

 Tables S34 and S32, respectively. We did not detect significant
differences in cortical surface area for the sex-by-diagnosis
interaction (Supplementary Table S33) or the age-by-diagnosis
interaction (Supplementary Table S35). When comparing 104
adolescent/young adult BD patients with a history of psychosis
with 143 patients without a history of psychosis, we found
evidence of reduced surface area in the left inferior temporal
gyrus (d = − 0.489; P = 0.000513) and right caudal anterior cingu-
late cortex (d = − 0.433; P = 0.00204) of BD patients with a history
of psychosis. We did not detect differences in cortical thickness
(Supplementary Tables S50 and S51). Further, we did not detect
differences in cortical thickness or surface area when comparing
patients who were depressed at the time of scanning (n = 53) with
patients who were euthymic at the time of scanning (n = 133)
(Supplementary Tables S52 and S53). Comparisons with other
mood states such as hypomanic, manic and mixed were not
possible due to small sample sizes. Further examinations of
diagnosis subtype, duration of illness and medication effects in
our adolescent/young adult sample are detailed in Supplementary
Note S1. We did not find evidence of bias in cortical thickness
and surface area estimates by field strength, FreeSurfer version
or
voxel
volume
in
adults
or
adolescents/young
adults
(Supplementary Note S2).
DISCUSSION
Here we present a highly powered study on structural brain
differences in the cortex of patients with BD using the largest
sample to date. Relative to healthy controls, adults with BD had
widespread bilateral patterns of reduced cortical thickness in
frontal, temporal and parietal regions. In adolescents/young
adults/young adults, we found reduced thickness and surface
area
in
the
supramarginal
gyrus
and
insula
(respectively)
associated with BD.
In addition, we found evidence of significant age-by-diagnosis
effects whereby older adolescent/young adult patients with BD
had additional cortical thinning beyond what could be explained
by the effects of age and diagnosis alone. This interaction may
capture the accelerated thinning associated with age-related brain
changes and the pathophysiology of BD. We also found evidence
of significant sex-by-diagnosis effects whereby adolescent/young
adult female BD patients have less thinning than would be
expected
based
on
sex
and
diagnosis
effects
alone.
The
dampened cortical thinning of adolescent/young adult female
patients with BD may reflect the sexual dimorphism in cortical
development in which females, in general, have a thicker
cortex than males.46 However, this interaction effect was not
detected in our comparisons of adults and therefore appears to
not be present at later stages in life. However, these findings
should be confirmed in independent samples and ideally in
longitudinal studies.
Interestingly, even in the current highly powered sample, only
one of the analyses of diagnosis showed evidence of effects on
cortical surface area (reduced surface area in the insula of
adolescents/young adults). When reanalyzing the surface area
differences without head size as a covariate (that is, with the
intracranial volume covariate removed), an additional region of
interest (right entorhinal gyrus) showed a significantly increased
surface area in adults with BD (Supplementary Tables S6 and S31).
In general, BD appears to be associated with reduced cortical
thickness but not surface area. Cortical thickness is thought to be a
localized measure of neuron numbers within a cortical layer while
surface area is a measure of cortical column layer numbers and
overall size of the cortex.18,19,47 It is therefore possible that the
neurobiological mechanisms associated with BD reduce neuron
numbers but do not affect overall size of the cortex or cortical
columnar organization.

Cortical abnormalities in BD
DP Hibar et al

Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 932 – 942
 We examined the effects of five major drug families (lithium,
antiepileptics, antidepressants, atypical and typical antipsychotics)
on cortical thickness and surface area in BD patients. Our statistical
model accounted for different drug combinations across indivi-
duals. In adults and adolescents/young adults, treatment with
lithium or antiepileptics showed significant evidence of effect on
cortical thickness (whereas lithium was positively associated with
cortical thickness, antipsychotics showed a negative relationship).
Prior studies of these medication types found a similar pattern of
effects on surface area and thickness throughout the brain.9–13
The increased cortical thickness associated with lithium treatment
is hypothesized to be driven by a neurotrophic effect of lithium on

 gray matter.11,48 Interestingly, the regions with the lowest
thickness associated with antiepileptic treatment were the primary
visual processing areas, in the occipital lobe. Treatment with
antiepileptics has previously been reported to be associated with
visual deficits.49 We found evidence of reduced cortical surface
area with atypical antipsychotics, which is in line with previous
prospective longitudinal studies in schizophrenia.50,51 Our finding
of
increased
cortical
surface
area
associated
with
typical
antipsychotics is difficult to interpret. The total number of patients
in our sample taking typical antipsychotics was quite small (about
5%). Further efforts are needed with larger sample sizes to
examine this effect more definitively. Our findings highlight the
importance of accounting and controlling for medications when
assessing brain differences in patients with BD.
We did not detect thickness or surface area differences between
adult patients diagnosed with BD type 1 versus type 2. This is
consistent with our prior work examining subcortical structural
alterations in BD, where we also did not find significant volumetric
differences between BD subtypes.40 Several previous studies have
identified differences in cortical thickness and surface area
associated with BD type 1 that do not appear to be apparent in
type 2.13,33 However, most large meta-analyses have failed to
detect a difference between disorders subtypes.52,53 Despite the
differences in clinical presentation of patients with BD type 1 and
type 2, analyses of brain structure and genetics indicate that there
are few detectable differences between the subtypes.13,33,53,54 It
appears then that the current measures of cortical and subcortical
structures are not sensitive to differences in subtype. It is possible
that
the
subtype
differences
are
more
focal
and
remain
undetected in this ROI-based analysis. Efforts that examine
vertexwise data can help examine these issues with a greater
resolution across the cortex. In addition, it should be noted that
the number of adult patients diagnosed with BD type 2 (n = 345)
was lower than those with BD type 1 (n = 1275). A larger (better
balanced) sample size in both groups would help determine the
differences more definitively.
We investigated the effect of mood state at the time of
scanning as well as patient history of psychosis for effects on the
cortex. In adult and adolescent/young adult patients with BD, we
did not find evidence of significant differences in cortical thickness
or surface area associated with a euthymic or depressed mood
state at the time of scanning. The total sample size for other
additional mood states (that is, manic, hypomanic, mixed) were
too small to allow for comparisons across groups. This suggests
that mood state at the time of scanning, at least for euthymic and
depressed patients, does not influence cortical thickness and
surface area measurements. However, different aspects of mood
such as length of time in a given mood state or number of
episodes are potential areas for further study though those
measures were either unavailable or unreliable in the majority of
site participating in this analysis. When we examined adult and
adolescent/young adult BD patients with at least one previous
episode of psychosis within or outside of an affective episode
compared with patients without a history of psychosis, we found
evidence of reduced cortical surface area associated with a history
of psychosis in the frontal pole of adults and the inferior temporal
gyrus and caudal anterior cingulate cortex in adolescents/young
adults with a history of psychosis. However, the periodic nature of
psychotic symptoms and the heterogeneity in collection across
sites in this study limit our interpretation. In addition, the overall
sizes of the effects on the cortex, while significant, are quite low.
Future work should characterize psychotic symptoms in a
prospectively designed and ideally large, cohort study.
Duration of illness has previously been suggested to have
effects on cortical thickness in BD.55,56 Our study is cross-sectional,
that is, we are not observing changes in thickness over time but
instead evaluating patients with varying durations of illness. We
did find significant evidence of reduced cortical thickness
associated with longer duration of illness in adults with BD in
the occipital cortex, left parietal and right frontal cortex. However,
our current cross-sectional model limits the interpretation of
effects that depend on the duration of illness. Large-scale,

 longitudinal studies of BD are needed to specifically examine how
illness duration and treatment over time affects the brain. Several
such efforts are underway,57–59 but greater resources are needed
in this area to increase power to identify robust effects.
Strengths of this study include a large sample size and
harmonized
analysis
of
the
cortex,
but
there
are
several
limitations: (1) samples come from heterogeneous sources—from
centers around the world. Although we explicitly model differ-
ences between sites (including imaging parameters, such as field
strength, FreeSurfer version and voxel volume), sources of
heterogeneity (such as treatment response, stage of illness,
ethnicity/race) in our estimates still remain. BD itself is quite
heterogeneous, and while we attempt to model sources of
heterogeneity both in the clinic and at the level of the patient, the
overall effect sizes observed in this study are quite small. This
suggests that the value of cortical thickness and surface area as a
biomarker will likely be strongest when examined in combination
with risk gene variants and additional biomarkers that reflect
variation in other aspects of the disorder; (2) we examined the
moderating effects of commonly prescribed medications, but our
cross-sectional data represent only a snapshot of the medication
history of a given subject. Although we believe that our
medication models do reveal distinct and biologically meaningful
patterns of effects on the cortex, we acknowledge that a large,
prospective and longitudinal study of BD is the best way to
disentangle these effects; (3) several moderating factors (for
example, alcohol dependence,60 smoking,61,62 substance abuse63)
may influence cortical structure but were not included in this
study as these data were not available in a large portion of the
data sets; (4) we examined subjects with a diagnosis of BD
excluding patients with head trauma or neurological disorders;
however, many sites enrolled patients with co-morbid psychiatric
disorders, including anxiety and personality disorders. It therefore
remains possible that the effects described here are affected by
comorbid diagnoses; and (5) these data are focused on the
structure of the cortex including thickness and surface area.
Patterns of effects (and lack of effects) may differ when examining
other brain imaging modalities (for example, white matter tracts64
and resting state networks65). Integrating multimodal information
on BD will likely improve our understanding of the disorder and
help the development of biomarkers. However, large-scale, mono-
modality analyses are necessary to first determine the effective-
ness of a given modality and its suitability for inclusion in future
multi-modal study designs.
In general, our findings are consistent with prior reports of a
thinner frontal and temporal cortex in BD.26 The brain regions
associated with the largest reductions in cortical thickness in adult
patients diagnosed with BD were located in the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), which has been an area of considerable
focus and study in the BD literature.66 Functional brain imaging
studies have shown increased activity in the VLPFC in remitted BD
during emotion regulation67 and increased activity in depressed
BD during a cognitive task (planning) compared with depressed
major depressive disorder.68 Functional and structural abnormal-
ities in the VLPFC of unaffected first-degree relatives have also
been observed.69,70 The findings in this study not only confirm the
most consistent effects from prior studies but also provide novel
evidence of effects showing that: (1) inferior parietal regions are
associated with significantly reduced thickness in adults with BD;
and (2) inferior temporal regions (including the fusiform gyrus and
middle temporal gyrus) are associated with reduced cortical
thickness in adults with BD. The inferior parietal lobe is involved in
sensorimotor integration of the mirror neuron system71 and
language tasks.72 Structural deficits in these brain regions may be
implicated in changes in emotion perception associated with BD,
which in turn are suggested to explain fluctuating or rapid
changes in mood.73,74 The inferior temporal lobe—comprised of
the middle and inferior temporal gyrus and the fusiform gyrus—
has a major role in the ventral stream of visual processing and
spatial awareness. Further, the inferior temporal lobe receives
dense neuronal projections from the amygdala and is hypothe-
sized to feed visual perceptions into the emotion processing
circuit.75 Our analysis of a family-based cohort enriched for BD
(UCLA-BP; n = 527) shows a similar pattern of effects in the frontal
and temporal lobes. However, regional differences in the occipital
lobe were not associated with BD in the UCLA-BP cohort. We
previously showed that limbic subcortical structures (including the
hippocampus and thalamus), which receive dense connections
with frontal and temporal lobe regions, showed evidence of
volumetric reductions in BD.40 A prior analysis of heritability in the
UCLA-BP cohort shows that frontal and temporal lobe differences
are
both
partially
heritable
and
attributable
to
BD
pathophysiology.76 It should be noted that decreased cortical
thickness in general is not specific to BD; it has been shown in
other related disorders such as schizophrenia33 and major
depression.41 Future efforts should examine the value of cortical
thickness and surface area as a pattern of effects across the cortex
for distinguishing major psychiatric disorders. While we demon-
strate a clear pattern of cortical thinning associated with BD,
future endeavors should examine the value of these measures for
improving the lives of patients including in studies of quality of
life, patient outcomes and early detection and intervention.
