Dear Sir, 
 
 
We are submitting our manuscript entitled “Germline mutations in DNA repair genes 
predispose asbestos-exposed patients to malignant pleural mesothelioma.” 
 
We studied the prevalence of germline mutations in 94 genes involved in cancer syndromes in 93 
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. To our knowledge this is the first study of this kind. 
A main asset of our study was the thorough quantification of asbestos exposure in the studied 
patients.  
We observed that 9.7% of the patients carried pathogenic truncating variants in DNA repair genes. 
Moreover, these patients were exposed to a smaller amount of asbestos as compared with all the 
other patients. This difference is statistically significant.  
Our study suggests that patients with a DNA repair defect are more susceptible to asbestos 
carcinogenesis because they cannot efficiently repair the DNA damage induced by asbestos.  
Our study has clinical relevance because these patients might respond to drugs that induce synthetic 
lethality. Moreover, patients’ relatives who carry the same variants should undergo surveillance for 
the constellation of cancers specific for the mutated genes.  
We wish to underline that mesothelioma is a rare cancer; thus, our 93-patient study panel  is 
noteworthy. 
 
We were wondering whether we could exclude the following scientists as reviewers, because they

 Abstract  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, aggressive cancer caused by asbestos exposure. 
An inherited predisposition has been suggested to explain multiple cases in the same family and the 
observation that not all individuals highly exposed to asbestos develop the tumor. Germline 
mutations in BAP1 are responsible for a rare cancer predisposition syndrome that includes 
predisposition to mesothelioma. We reasoned that other genes could be responsible for the inherited 
mesothelioma predisposition. We investigated the prevalence of germline variants in 94 cancer-
predisposing genes in 93 MPM patients with a quantified asbestos exposure. Ten pathogenic 
truncating variants (PTVs) were identified in PALB2, BRCA1, FANCI, ATM, SLX4, BRCA2, 
FANCC, FANCF, PMS1 and XPC. All these genes are involved in DNA repair pathways, mostly in 
homologous recombination repair. Patients carrying PTVs represented 9.7% of the panel and 
showed lower asbestos exposure than all the other patients (p=0.0017). This suggests that they do 
not efficiently repair the DNA damage induced by asbestos, leading to carcinogenesis.  
This study shows that germline variants in several genes could increase MPM susceptibility in the 
presence of asbestos exposure and may be relevant for specific treatment.

 1. Introduction  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive cancer caused by exposure to a 
single carcinogen, asbestos [1]. The frequency of MPM is dramatically higher in asbestos-polluted 
areas, as exemplified by the MPM epidemic in the northern Italy town of Casale Monferrato, caused 
by the presence of an asbestos cement factory (1907-1986). In this area, the average annual 
incidence in 2009–2013 was 51.2 among men and 20.2 (per 100,000, per year) among women, 
approximately 
10 
times 
higher 
than 
the 
corresponding 
Italian 
incidence 
rates 
(http://cpo.it/workspace/files/pleural-mesothelioma-incidence-574400b9b1625.pdf). 
Asbestos induces carcinogenesis by directly interfering with mitotic spindle formation and by 
inducing chronic inflammation [2–4]  with the production of cytokines and reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) by activated macrophages. ROS are also generated by the iron contained in asbestos fibers 
[5]. 
Similar to exposure to other carcinogens, not all individuals exposed to high level of asbestos 
develop cancer [6]. This observation and the reports of families with multiple cases suggest a 
possible role for an inherited predisposition, even though common asbestos exposure must be 
considered [7–10]. As for other tumors [11,12], low-risk susceptibility factors have been identified 
by Genome Wide Association studies (GWAs) on the germline genome of MPM patients [13,14].  
The occurrence of a dominant inherited predisposition, so called a high-risk predisposition, is a well 
known concept in cancer and has been clearly demonstrated for several cancer types [15–18]. The 
most studied high-risk factor for MPM is inherited mutations in BAP1, a tumor suppressor gene that 
encodes a deubiquitinase involved in the modulation of transcription and DNA repair [19]. So far, 
79 families in which individuals carry one of 65 germline loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in 
BAP1 have been identified worldwide [20–24]. The carriers are at high risk for a number of tumors, 
including mesothelioma, cutaneous and uveal melanoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, and basal cell 
carcinoma. Patients are also prone to develop peculiar cutaneous tumors, called melanocytic BAP1-
 mutated atypical intradermal tumors (MBAITs), that are considered to be a marker of BAP1 
syndrome [25]. 
Cancer is induced because of the loss of the tumor suppressor activity by a second somatic mutation 
[26]. 
Investigations on mesothelioma cases with germline BAP1 mutations suggest that these patients 
require asbestos exposure to develop mesothelioma and that these tumors most often have an 
epithelioid histotype and may be associated with a long survival [21,27]. 
We recently identified mesothelioma as being in the cancer spectrum of the CDKN2A syndrome, 
together with familial melanoma and pancreatic cancer [22]. Our study also showed that twelve 
families with familial mesothelioma did not carry germline mutations either in BAP1 or melanoma 
predisposition genes, suggesting that other genes could play a role [22]. 
Here, we decided to investigate the overall genetic predisposition conferred by 94 genes associated 
with cancer in 93 patients with MPM who lived in areas subjected in the past to high asbestos 
exposure. Asbestos exposure was quantitatively evaluated in all study participants.  
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Patients 
The study included 93 Italian patients with MPM. Diagnosis was made as described in Betti et al 
[22]. Seventy-seven patients were randomly selected from the previously reported case-control 
studies [28] and were classified as sporadic, whereas sixteen patients had a family history of 
mesothelioma. Six familial and five sporadic patients were studied for mutations in BAP1 and other 
genes involved in familial melanoma and were found to be mutation-negative [22]. 
All patients lived in Piedmont (northern Italy) and signed an informed consent. The study was 
approved by the local ethics committee.  
 Clinical details on gender, age at diagnosis, survival, histotype, asbestos exposure and family 
history for mesothelioma for all patients were collected from their oncologist and/or from the 
Malignant Mesothelioma Registry of the Piedmont Region (RMM) (Table I). Information on family 
history was limited to first- and second-degree relatives. Information on asbestos exposure at work, 
at home and in the general environment was collected by the RMM using a standardized 
questionnaire [29], which was administered by trained interviewers. Asbestos exposure was 
classified in the following categories: occupational, para-occupational, environmental and 
household, as previously described [21]. Moreover, exposure was assessed quantitatively by 
considering the whole exposure history of every study subject [30]. In brief, an exposure index was 
computed for each exposure circumstance by multiplying frequency, intensity and duration of 
exposure. The sum of the indices provided an estimate of life-long cumulative asbestos exposure.  
For familial cases, information on cancer in relatives was gathered from their attending clinician’s 
reports, clinical records and a section of the RMM questionnaire. 
2.2 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and variant validation 
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the QIAamp® DNA Blood Maxi Kit 
(QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on patient genomic DNA (gDNA) 
using the TruSight® Cancer sequencing panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) that targets 94 
genes involved in common and rare cancer syndromes. In addition, the set includes 284 SNPs found 
to be associated with cancer through GWAs. Detailed protocols for the library preparation and data 
analyses are described in the Supplementary Methods. 
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis in tumor samples was performed using Sanger sequencing 
and microsatellite analyses. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
(Supplementary Methods). 
 2.3 Statistical Analyses 
 Patients were divided in two groups, those carrying pathogenic truncating variants (PTVs) and all 
other patients.  
To evaluate the association between the two groups of patients and clinical characteristics, i.e., 
histological type (epithelioid versus others) and asbestos exposure (occupational versus 
environmental/para-occupational), a binary logistic regression was performed. The odds ratio (ORs) 
and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.  
A Student’s 2-tailed t-test after normalization using logarithmic transformation was used to 
compare the mean cumulative asbestos exposure between groups. 
The follow-up time was analyzed from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or the latest follow-
up date. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis stratified by group, 
and the OS difference was determined using the log-rank test. 
A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using 
STATA v12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). 
 
3. Results 
3.1 Patient clinical features 
Clinical features of the 93 MPM patients are reported in Table I. Asbestos exposure was evaluated 
as occupational, para-occupational, environmental and household in approximately 57%, 18%, 20% 
and 1% of patients, respectively. No information about asbestos exposure was available for three 
patients (3.2%). 
The mean follow-up time of the 93 MPM patients was 1.8 years (SD 2.2). Seventy-two patients 
died, 12 were alive and 9 patients were lost at follow up. At one year from diagnosis, 57% of the 
patients were alive, and at two years only 30% of the patients were still alive. 
3.2 Variant detection and characterization  
 On average, 70% of the mapped NGS reads were on target regions. Most samples had over 93% of 
reads with coverage above 20x, while the mean per-target depth of coverage across all samples was 
215x.  
We identified 772 variants, including 17 PTVs (12 indels and five nonsense variants) and 402 
missense and 353 synonymous variants. Seven of the PTVs should be considered variants of 
unknown significance (VUS) until a functional assay evaluates their effect (Table S2). 
Therefore, only ten PTVs were considered pathogenic and were subjected to further study (Table 
II). Eleven missense variants fulfilled the filter criteria described in Supplementary Methods (Table 
III). 
3.3 Pathogenic truncating variants 
Nine MPM patients (9.7%) harbored heterozygous PTVs in the following ten genes: PALB2, 
BRCA1, FANCI, ATM, SLX4, BRCA2, FANCC, FANCF, PMS1 and XPC (Table IV). 
One patient was a double heterozygote for two truncating mutations in different genes: a nonsense 
mutation in BRCA1 (c.3001G>T p.Glu1001*) and a frameshift mutation in FANCI 
(c.3846_3850delCACCT p.Ser1282fs*18).  
A nonsense mutation in PALB2 (c.691A>T p.Lys231*) was carried by another patient, whereas 
frameshift deletions were carried by seven patients, affecting BRCA2 (c.6591_6592delTG 
p.Glu2198Asnfs*4), ATM (c.8436delT p.Ser2812fs), SLX4 (c.2819delG p.Gly940fs), PMS1 
(c.1380delT p.Ser460fs), FANCC (c.1344delC p.Ala448fs), FANCF (c.604delC p.Leu202fs) and 
XPC (c.524_528delCAAGA p.Thr175fs). 
The nonsense mutation in BRCA1 is classified as pathogenic by ClinVar and ENIGMA. The 
frameshift mutation in BRCA2 is classified as pathogenic by ClinVar, ENIGMA and ARUP. The 
deleterious mutation in FANCI is reported in ExAC with an MAF (minor allele frequency) lower 
than 0.001%.  
The other eight PTVs were not reported in gene- or disease-specific databases (Table S3). 
 The MAF of each PTV in our dataset was higher than the MAF of all LOF variants in the 
corresponding gene in the ExAC and EVS databases (p<0.0001), except for BRCA2 (p=0.004) in 
EVS and PMS1 (p=0.017) in ExAC.  
All the variants were successfully validated with Sanger sequencing on DNA obtained from 
peripheral blood.  
The clinical data for the patients are reported in Table IV. Patients with SLX4 and XPC PTVs had 
familiarity for mesothelioma in first- or second-degree relatives, whereas the patient with BRCA1 
and FANCI PTVs had familiarity for breast cancer and the patient with PALB2 PTV for intestinal 
cancer. 
No truncating mutations were found in BAP1 and CDKN2A in our cohort. 
3.4 Functional studies on tumor samples 
Cancer-predisposing genes are most often tumor suppressor genes whose bi-allelic loss is due to an 
additional somatic variant in the tumor that complements the inherited LOF variant. 
To evaluate the expression of the protein in an FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) tumor 
sample, IHC was performed using specific antibodies. 
IHC using the anti-BRCA1 antibody on an FFPE tumor sample of MPM156AL showed a diffuse 
cytoplasmatic staining instead of the expected nuclear staining (data not shown). Since the inherited 
variant was a PTV, the results suggest that a second mutation leads to a variant non-functional 
protein. This patient also carried a PTV in FANCI that was found in tumor DNA, but the FFPE 
tumor specimen amount was not enough to perform IHC. 
The patient who carried a PTV in BRCA2 showed LOH for the D13S1701 microsatellite marker and 
a decreased amount of the D13S171 allele in the FFPE tumor sample (data not shown). This 
suggests that a somatic event causes loss of the gene and abolishes the protein. 
The patient who carried a PTV in SLX4 validated in tumor DNA showed cytoplasmatic positivity in 
the FFPE tumor sample instead of the expected nuclear staining, suggesting the presence of a 
second somatic variant that leads to the production of a non-functional protein. 
 The patient with a PTV in ATM showed a decreased amount of an allele for the only informative 
microsatellite marker (D11S1778) in the tumor DNA (data not shown), suggesting LOH. However, 
IHC with the anti-ATM antibody showed normal nuclear staining (data not shown), suggesting the 
presence of a wild type allele. Since we have not identified the PTV in the tumor tissue, overall, this 
result suggests that the mutated allele was lost in the tumor. This behavior was also reported for 
breast cancers harboring ATM PTVs [31], possibly because during cancer progression, allele 
deletion was more advantageous than the original PTV. 
No tumor specimen was available from the patients with PTVs in PALB2, XPC, FANCC, FANCF 
and PMS1. 
3.5 Missense variants 
Eleven missense variants were found in six different genes: FANCA, MLH1, MSH6, MUTYH, TSC2 
and HNF1A (Table III, Table V). 
Only one of these variants (MUTYH c.1145G>A p.Gly382Asp), carried by three patients, is 
considered pathogenic by ClinVar. One of these patients also carried a PTV in SLX4. 
Two variants were identified in MLH1. One patient carried the c.1136A>G p.Tyr379Cys variant, 
whereas two other patients carried a variant that affects two consecutive base pairs in cis leading to 
a Lys618Ala missense variant (c.1852_1853delAAinsGC) already reported as a VUS in genomic 
databases (Table S4). 
Three variants were found in FANCA (c.1874G>C p.Cys625Ser, c.3665C>T p.Pro1222Leu, 
c.1255T>G p.Phe419Val) in four patients. One of them also carried a TSC2 variant (c.1915C>T 
p.Arg639Trp). Another missense variant in TSC2 (c.2278A>C p.Thr760Pro) was carried by a 
different patient. 
LOF mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 are the cause of tuberous sclerosis syndrome (TS), a generally 
severe genodermatosis inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and characterized by mental 
retardation, seizures and angiofibromas of the skin. The c.1915C>T p.Arg639Trp variant is reported 
as pathogenic in the TS database-Leiden Open Variation Database. We cannot rule out that these 
 patients were affected by TS since information about this concurrent inherited disease was not 
thoroughly reported in the Registry and during the interview.  
It is intriguing that a patient with TS has been reported to develop a primary pericardial 
mesothelioma [32]. Moreover, TSC1 has been found to be somatically mutated in mesothelioma, 
and mice with TSC1 and TP53 mutations develop mesothelioma [33]. 
A variant (c.1226C>A p.Pro409His) in HNF1A was found in two patients. 
A variant (c.3727A>T p.Thr1243Ser) in MSH6 was found in another patient, and two missense 
variants (MUTYH c.1145G>A p.Gly382Asp, MLH1 p.Lys618Ala) were found in patients with 
familial MPM. Familiarity for other cancers was found in patients with FANCA, HNF1A and TSC2 
variants. 
Because the data are not unequivocal, all these missense variants should be considered VUS until 
their effect is evaluated by a functional assay.  
3.6 Other findings 
A group of variants that did not fulfill the selected filter criteria are nevertheless mentioned here 
because they have been reported as low-risk factors in the literature.  
MITF c.952G>A p.Glu318Lys (rs149617956), which is considered a low-risk factor for familial 
melanoma [34], was found in a single MPM patient who also carried also MUTYH c.1145G>A 
p.Gly382Asp. 
We also found a BAP1 missense variant (c.944A>C p.Glu315Ala) (rs149974450) in one patient. 
This variant is reported in ExAC and EVS with an MAF lower than 0.02%, but four out of six in 
silico prediction tools considered it as benign. A functional assay is needed to evaluate the effect of 
this VUS. 
3.7 Statistical analyses 
Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the differences between patients carrying PTVs and 
the other patients.  
 The mean of the quantitative asbestos exposure was 3.8 (SD 9.5) for the group with PTVs and 25.7 
(SD 148) for the other group. A statistically significant difference of the mean values of quantitative 
exposure between the two groups was detected (p=0.0017) (Table I). A statistically significant 
difference was also present when the quantitative exposure of the PTV group was compared to that 
of the 71 patients who did not carry either PTVs or missense variants (p=0.0037) (Table S5). 
No statistically significant association was found for histotype or the categories of asbestos 
exposure in the two groups. Considering the group without PTVs as a reference, the OR for patients 
with sarcomatoid and biphasic histologies compared with those who had epithelioid histology was 4 
(95% CI 0.5-33.6), and the OR among those with occupational exposure compared with those with 
environmental and para-occupational asbestos exposure was 1.2 (95% CI 0.3-4.7) (Table I). 
The mean age at diagnosis was 73.9 (SD 7.2) for the group with PTVs and 67.4 (SD 12.6) for the 
other group. No significant differences in age at diagnosis or survival were found between the two 
groups (p=0.13 and p=0.25, respectively) (Table I). 
 
4. Discussion 
Our study shows, for the first time, that a substantial proportion (9.7%) of MPM patients carry 
PTVs in DNA repair genes, and these patients show a statistically significant lower intensity of 
asbestos exposure. This suggests that although asbestos exposure is necessary to develop MPM, in 
these patients, even a low exposure to asbestos is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. 
Interestingly, eight of these mutated genes are involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
(BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, FANCI, FANCC, FANCF, SLX4), like BAP1, whereas two (XPC 
and PMS1) are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR), 
respectively. HRR is the mechanism used to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by 
asbestos fibers. On the other hand, asbestos may also cause DNA damage repaired by base excision 
repair (BER), NER or MMR.  
 It is thus possible to hypothesize that these patients, because of their defect in DNA repair, were 
less able to repair DNA damage induced by asbestos. 
Moreover, 13 patients (14%) carry rare missense variants considered damaging by in silico 
prediction tools and located in FANCA, TSC2, HNF1A, MLH1, MSH6, and MUTYH. 
Although a stringent approach cannot consider these mutations as pathogenic without functional 
analyses, it is intriguing to note that they are located in genes involved in the same DNA repair 
systems reported for the PTVs, i.e., HRR (FANCA) and MMR (MLH1, MSH6, MUTYH). 
Our approach of variant classification was very conservative, since we did not consider the possible 
pathogenic missense variants in the analysis. In this way, we may have underestimated the 
prevalence of mutation carriers. The NGS approach we used does not reveal large rearrangements, 
for which a whole genome NGS or CGH-based approach would be more appropriate [35,36]. Last 
and not least, mutations in genes that are not included in the TruSight Cancer panel have not been 
screened. Thus, it is possible that patients who did not carry variants in the 94 genes that were the 
object of our study harbor variants in genes that were not screened. 
Our data show, for the first time, that predisposition to MPM is very heterogeneous, similar to that 
reported for pancreatic cancer and other cancer types [17,18,37]. Also the proportion of patients 
carrying PTV is similar. 
Our study suggests that MPM must be added to the constellation of tumors resulting from mutations 
in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, SLX4, FANCC, FANCI, PALB2, FANCF, PMS1 and XPC. Most probably 
the type of carcinogen exposure is relevant for the cancer type that will be developed by variant 
carriers, as suggested for BAP1 [21]. 
The characterization of mutation carriers within these families is of particular clinical relevance 
because all carriers are at risk for a certain cancer spectrum and should be included in specific high-
risk surveillance and secondary prevention programs [38]. However, in order to completely 
characterize all genes conferring increased risk of MPM, a whole exome approach is needed. 
 Finally, the identification of inherited predisposition for mesothelioma may turn out to be relevant 
for treatment in the future. This was the case for ovarian cancers due to predisposing germline 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, where a different response to PARP inhibitors was identified [39,40]. 
Similarly, the identification of subsets of patients who carry predisposing mutations in the 
homologous recombination pathway may distinguish patients who can benefit from drugs that 
induce synthetic lethality [41,42].
