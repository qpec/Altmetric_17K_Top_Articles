Studies of neural pathways that contribute to loss and recovery of function following paralyzing spinal cord injury
require devices for modulating and recording electrophysiological activity in specific neurons. These devices must
be sufficiently flexible to match the low elastic modulus of neural tissue and to withstand repeated strains experienced
by the spinal cord during normal movement. We report flexible, stretchable probes consisting of thermally drawn
polymer fibers coated with micrometer-thick conductive meshes of silver nanowires. These hybrid probes maintain
low optical transmission losses in the visible range and impedance suitable for extracellular recording under strains
exceeding those occurring in mammalian spinal cords. Evaluation in freely moving mice confirms the ability of these
probes to record endogenous electrophysiological activity in the spinal cord. Simultaneous stimulation and recording
is demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin 2, where optical excitation evokes electromyographic
activity and hindlimb movement correlated to local field potentials measured in the spinal cord.
INTRODUCTION
Traumatic injuries to the spinal cord are frequently associated with
loss of organ function or loss of voluntary limb control. Our under-
standing of and ability to treat these symptoms is currently limited by
the tools available for monitoring and manipulating neural dynamics
within the spinal cord. Because of the relative ease of genetic manip-
ulation, rodent models have become indispensible discovery tools for
basic neuroscience. Optogenetic modulation of genetically identifiable
neuronal populations in rodent spinal cords may enable discovery of
the neural pathways crucial for recovery following injury. However,
the spinal cord’s viscoelastic modulus of 0.25 to 0.3 MPa (1) poses en-
gineering challenges to the design of optoelectrophysiological probes.
Furthermore, repeated spinal cord deformations during normal
movement demand resilience of the implantable devices to bending
and extension fatigue.
Inspired by preclinical (2) and early clinical (3, 4) studies indicating
the promise of spinal stimulation to facilitate rehabilitation following
paralyzing injury, recent work has focused on flexible and stretchable
probes for optical and electrical stimulation on the surface of rodent
spinal cords (5, 6). The ability to perform neural recording during
stimulation may similarly be essential to elucidate the electrophysio-
logical origins of functional recovery. Furthermore, devices suitable for
implantation deep within the spinal cord may permit interrogation of
specific interneurons, isolating their functional contributions to loss
and recovery of connections following injury. Here, we report flexible
and stretchable probes that combine optical stimulation with
electrophysiological recording that can be implanted into the mouse
spinal cord. We adopt a thermal drawing process to produce polymer
fibers, and then coat these devices with micrometer-thick meshes of
conductive silver nanowires (AgNWs). We characterize electrical im-
pedance and optical transmission of these probes during deformations
commonly occurring in rodent spinal cords, thereby illustrating the
resilience of the polymer fiber cores and concentric mesh electrodes
to strain. Electrophysiological recording of spontaneous, sensory-
evoked, and optically evoked neural activity in the spinal cords of mice
expressing channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) further illustrates the prom-
ise of these hybrid fiber probes for studies of spinal cord circuits.
Recording of endogenous activity in freely moving mice chronically
implanted with fiber probes in their spinal cords, combined with anal-
ysis of the surrounding tissue, suggests minimal disruption to local neu-
ral networks.
RESULTS
Design and fabrication of the nanowire-coated fiber probes
To fabricate probes suitable for electrophysiological recording and
optical neuromodulation in rodent spinal cords, we combined two tech-
niques. First, we used thermal drawing to produce a flexible optical fiber
that also served as a structural core for the probe (Fig. 1A). Being
versatile and scalable, thermal drawing can be applied to macroscale
templates (preforms) composed of multiple materials. It also allows
us to reduce final device dimensions by up to 200 times (fig. S1) while
producing hundreds of meters of fiber in a single draw (Fig. 1B) (7, 8). By
tuning the stress during the drawing process, a range of feature
dimensions can be achieved without compromising the cross-sectional
geometry defined within the preform (fig. S1).
On the basis of previous work applying multimaterial fibers to
optical neuromodulation (9, 10), polycarbonate (PC; refractive index
n = 1.58; glass transition temperature Tg = 145°C; Young’s modulus
E = 2.38 GPa) and cyclic olefin copolymer (COC; n = 1.52, Tg = 158°C,
E = 3.0 GPa) were selected as the respective core and cladding of the
optical fiber (11–13). To enable neural recording while minimizing
the device footprint, we deposited uniform 1-mm-thick conductive
layers of AgNWs (diameter d = 70 nm; length L = 40 mm) (Fig. 1, A
and C) over the COC cladding via dip coating from isopropanol
(IPA) solutions with different concentrations (Fig. 1, A, D to F). Because
the hydrophobicity of COC limited the adhesion and deposition

 of AgNWs from IPA (14), oxygen plasma treatment of the fibers was
essential to enhance the uniformity of AgNW mesh layers (14, 15). An
AgNW coating was chosen as the electrode material because of its high
conductivity and compatibility with facile solution-based processing
(16). It was hypothesized that the mesh formed by AgNWs would
be more resilient with respect to bending and stretching deformation
(17, 18) than a continuous metallic film of comparable thickness, because
the latter is anticipated to develop cracks under strains commonly ex-
perienced in spinal cords (19). The entire structure was then encapsulated
within a layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; n = ~1.41 to 1.47; thick-
ness, 5 mm) (20) to minimize direct contact of AgNW with tissue and pre-
vent surface oxidation and mechanical degradation (Fig. 1, A and D). The
final device diameter ranged from 105 to 135 mm and was constrained
by the dimensions of the structural fiber core (100 to 130 mm).
Optical and electrical properties of the nanowire-coated
fiber probes
To match the mechanical properties of neural tissues, flexible polymer-
based optical waveguides have been recently introduced to replace
conventional rigid silica fibers (21–27). Waveguides composed of
SU-8 and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fabricated via a lith-
ographic process have been used in the context of optogenetic neuro-
modulation (23), whereas PDMS and hydrogel-based devices have been
applied to fluorescence measurements and optical control of gene ex-
pression (20, 26, 27). In addition to their transparency across the visible
spectrum (fig. S2), the polymers PC and COC are compatible with the
thermal drawing process. Consequently, the geometry of the device can
be easily altered to fit the application (28). The difference between the
refractive indices of PC and PDMS is 0.18. Although this should, in
principle, be sufficient to sustain multimode transmission through the
fiber even in the absence of COC cladding (fig. S2), direct coating of
AgNWs onto the PC surface resulted in significant losses due to
scattering and evanescent coupling of light into the plasmon modes
of these nanomaterials (Fig. 2A) (29). Addition of the COC cladding
reduced the losses from 2.5 to 1.9 dB/cm (Fig. 2A). Because of their
flexibility, these probes were able to maintain transmission under ex-
treme deformations (Fig. 2B), including their use as sutures (Fig. 2C).
Electrophysiological recording during optogenetic neuromodula-
tion is commonly accomplished by integrating conductive electrodes
within the probes (23, 30–34). Conductive polymer composites exhibit
high flexibility and biocompatibility (35), but are limited by high im-
pedances on the order of megohms (9, 10, 36). Metallic electrodes
deposited on polymer substrates have low impedance but are subject
to cracking (19). Fractal and serpentine metallic electrodes defined via
contact printing address the flexibility challenge but offer limited spa-
tial resolution (5, 6, 37–39). AgNW meshes were previously used as
stretchable interconnects in flexible electronic applications (16), and
their composites have been recently applied to monitoring of cardiac
function (35). We found that to reproducibly achieve meshes with low
resistivity, the concentration of AgNWs in a dip-coating solution
needed to exceed 4 mg/ml. At concentrations >6 mg/ml, the resistivity
of the AgNW mesh was proportional to the concentration of the dip-
coating solution (Fig. 3A). To account for anticipated changes in mesh
morphology during deformation, we chose the lowest resistance mesh
(9.37 × 10−4 ohm∙cm) for our probes. PDMS was selected as a protec-
tive coating for the conductive layer because of its low modulus (tens
of kPa for 30:1 polymer to curing agent by weight) and low refractive
index, ensuring confinement of light to the PC/COC core (40).
Following dip coating with PDMS, the probe tips were cut orthogo-
nally to the fiber axis, exposing thin conductive AgNW ring electro-
des. Similar to solid metallic electrodes, the impedance of the probes at
1 kHz had a significant dependence on the contact area but less on the

 length. Mesh electrodes within 1- and 10-cm fiber probes exhibited
impedance values of similar orders of magnitude (|ZPC/COC, 1 cm| =
50 ± 26 kW, |ZPC/COC, 10 cm| = 58 ± 21 kW; mean ± SEM), which
indicated that, following evaluation in small rodents, this fabrica-
tion approach may, in principle, be scaled to applications in larger
animals (Fig. 3B).
In addition to bending, AgNW mesh concentric electrodes were
also resilient to stretching deformation. Using a fabrication process
identical to the one outlined for PC/COC fibers, we thermally drew
stretchable fibers composed of COC elastomer (COCE; n = 1.51;
melting temperature Tm = 84°C; E = 34 MPa). We chose COCE be-
cause of its low modulus and compatibility with a range of drawing
parameters. To establish stable processing conditions, we introduced
sacrificial PMMA cladding into the preform and then removed it with
acetone following drawing (Fig. 4). The resulting pillow-shaped COCE
fibers (cross-section width × height in the range from 125 mm ×
100 mm2 to 250 mm × 200 mm2) were similarly treated with oxygen
plasma, dip-coated with AgNWs, and encapsulated with PDMS. Con-
sistent with lower optical transmission of COCE as compared to PC
and COC, higher optical losses of 3.98 dB/cm were measured for
AgNW-coated COCE core fibers (fig. S3).
Because COCE is a rubbery material, these fibers could sustain up
to 230% strain, which was reduced to 200% following the coating with
AgNWs and PDMS (Fig. 4A). AgNW mesh electrodes coated onto 1-
and 10-cm COCE fibers exhibited somewhat greater difference in im-
pedance (|ZCOCE, 1 cm| = 34 ± 17 kW, |ZCOCE, 10 cm| = 162 ± 50 kW;
mean ± SEM; Fig. 4B), as compared to their PC/COC analogs. How-
ever, the absolute values of impedance were still well within the
range suitable for extracellular recordings even for 10-cm-long fibers.
We found that a single-layer AgNW mesh coating could only with-
stand strains of ~30% before losing conductivity due to the disruption
of the conductive network (fig. S4). In contrast, electrodes composed
of a three-layer AgNW mesh maintained low impedance at strains up
to ~100% (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with scanning electron micros-
copy images that do not reveal any structural differences between the
AgNW mesh–coated fibers subjected to 0, 10, and 20% strain (Fig.
4D). Repeated extension of the COCE/AgNW/PDMS fibers resulted
in negligible hysteresis of the electrode impedance, indicating
resilience of these devices to deformation (Fig. 4E). Because the spinal

the low-impedance AgNW mesh–coated fibers provide arbitrarily
scalable and stretchable alternatives to polymer composite and metal-
lic electrodes.
In vivo electrophysiological recording and optical
stimulation with nanowire-coated fibers
We evaluated the ability of the AgNW-coated fibers to record and op-
tically stimulate neural activity in the mouse spinal cord (Fig. 5, A and
B). Optoelectronic fibers with PC/COC and COCE optical cores were
implanted into the lumbar region (L1) of the spinal cord of WT and
Thy1-ChR2-YFP transgenic mice that broadly express light-sensitive
cation channel ChR2 (42). Acute experiments in anesthetized mice in-
dicated the ability of both PC/COC and COCE fiber probes with
AgNW electrodes to record spontaneous neural activity (Fig. 5, C to
F, and fig. S5). Single-neuron signals were isolated (Fig. 5, D and F)
and assessed by principal components analysis (fig. S5, A and C) and
interspike interval (ISI) histograms (fig. S5, B and D).
Electrophysiological activity was also recorded with AgNW elec-
trodes within PC/COC- and COCE-based fiber probes in tethered,
freely moving WT mice up to 1 week following the implantation sur-
gery (fig. S6). Recordings from freely moving mice contained a com-
bination of multiunit activity and movement artifacts and were
confounded by greater noise levels than those performed under anes-
thesia. However, the noise level remained stable over these week-long
studies. In addition to spontaneous activity, we recorded robust sen-
sory-evoked potentials from the dorsal columns that scaled with cur-
rent applied to the ipsilateral hind foot (Fig. 5, G and H, and fig. S7, A
and B).
In Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice, illuminating the lumbar region of the
spinal cord with laser light (125 to 168 mW/mm2) with a wavelength
l = 473 nm (activation peak of ChR2), coupled into fiber cores
through ferrules, consistently evoked neural activity that was correlated
with the 5-ms optical pulses at 10 Hz (latency, 10.6 ± 0.5 ms) (Fig. 5, I
and J). Stimulation at a higher frequency of 100 Hz similarly evoked
neural activity (fig. S8). However, in this case, the observed multineu-
ron potentials did not follow each laser pulse, consistent with ChR2
kinetics (43). Neural activity in the lumbar spinal cord induced by
optical pulses delivered through the fiber probes was sufficient to pro-
duce muscle contractions in the ipsilateral hindlimb (Fig. 5, K and M,
fig. S9, and video S1). The electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded
in a gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 5M) was correlated with the optically
evoked local field potentials recorded with the AgNW mesh–coated
COCE fibers in the lumbar spinal cord (Fig. 5L).
Immunohistochemical analysis of the spinal cord tissue surround-
ing the fiber probes indicated modest astrocytic presence, as indicated
by staining with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), for the devices positioned on the surfaces and within the
tissue 2 weeks after the implantation surgeries (fig. S10). Further-
more, the depth probes reaching into the gray matter did not appear
to interfere with the viability of the surrounding neuronal populations
(fig. S10, D and E).
DISCUSSION
By combining thermally drawn polymer fibers with solution-deposited
nanowires, we developed flexible andstretchable concentric probessuit-
able for optical and electrophysiological interrogation of spinal cord
circuits in the mouse model. Our devices maintained optical and elec-
trical properties under bending and stretching deformations, exceeding
those experienced by the mouse spinal cord during normal motion. The
mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics of the probes enabled
acute recordings of spontaneous neural activity, sensory-evoked po-
tentials, and the simultaneous recording of optically evoked spinal

 potentials and optical control of hindlimb muscles. These findings sug-
gest that the fiber platform may, in the future, permit monitoring and
controlling of neural activity to promote recovery following spinal cord
injury. Isolating single-neuron action potentials from the mouse spinal
cord during free behavior remains a goal because such recordings are
exceedingly difficult, having been rarely reported in rodents (44). Even
in acute studies, the flexibility of our probes may provide a solution to
the challenges associated with the recording of neural activity in the spi-
nal cord posed by the respiration and heartbeat, which often necessitate
a transection of nerves leading to the diaphragm (45).
Our conceptual experiments conducted with AgNW meshes as
electrodes within fiber probes do not reveal tissue erosion or cyto-
toxic effects in the vicinity of the implants (fig. S9). These nanoma-
terials were chosen as an affordable alternative to gold NWs. Going
forward, any metallic NWs can be similarly deposited onto polym-
er fiber surfaces, further enhancing long-term biocompatibility and
tunability of charge-carrying capacity (46). Additional chemical stabil-
ity can be achieved through covalent cross-linking of the mesh (47),
and the surface of the exposed NW ring can be passivated through
electrodeposition of gold or iridium oxide layers via established
protocols routinely applied to nickel-chromium (Ni/Cr) tetrodes (48).
AgNW mesh electrodes enabled straightforward integration of
electrophysiological recording capability into polymer optical fibers
without significant increase in overall device dimensions. In the future,

 the number of channels can be expanded by integrating multiple con-
centric NW rings separated by thin elastomer coatings and by
patterning the mesh electrode surfaces, for example, through the use
of photosensitive PDMS (49, 50). The high surface area of exposed
NWs, as compared to monolithic electrodes of similar cross section,
may permit maintaining impedance values in the range applicable for
extracellular recordings, even following patterning of the meshes. The
probes demonstrated here relied solely on scalable fiber drawing and
solution-based fabrication methods that do not pose constraints on
device dimensions or geometry. Acting as flexible and stretchable
optical canvases for electrophysiological probes, these fibers may, in
the future, be tailored to address fundamental questions in spinal cord
or visceral organ neurophysiology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fiber probe fabrication
PC/COC waveguide.
To fabricate a preform, we wrapped a PC cylinder (diameter, 9 mm;
McMaster-Carr) in COC sheets (thickness, 0.05 mm; TOPAS Ad-
vanced Polymers, 6015S) to the total preform diameter of 12.5 mm.
The entire structure was then consolidated at 190°C for 12 min in
vacuum. The fiber was drawn at 280°C, and the drawing speed was
varied from 1 to 7 m/min to achieve draw-down ratios in the range of
30 to 140.
COCE rubbery fiber.
To fabricate the preform, we first cast-molded pellets of COCE (TOPAS
Elastomer E-140) into rectangular strips (L = 100 mm, W = 6 mm, H =
6mm)at180°Cinvacuum.PMMA(thickness,12.7mm;McMaster-Carr)
plates were machined into 25.4 mm-wide strips, followed by machining
grooves in the center of each strip and filling those with molded COCE.
The preform was then consolidated under pressure (50 psi at 125°C) for
14 hours andcooled to room temperature while concomitantly reducing
the applied stress. The preform was drawn at 240°C, and the resulting
fiber dimensions were reduced 40 to 80 times.
The fiber probes were connected to zirconia ferrules (Thorlabs,
CF128) using optical epoxy (Thorlabs, F112). The ferrule ends of
the fibers were then polished with silicon-carbide sandpaper.
Electrode fabrication and connection
The surface of the fiber probe was treated with oxygen plasma, dipped
into IPA solution of AgNWs (10 mg/ml, Novarials NovaWire-Ag-A70-
IPA), and dried in the air for at least 3 hours. Copper wire (AWG-38)
was placed on the fiber surface, attached with a conductive silver paint
(SPI Supplies, 04998AB), and then dried in the air for 2 hours. The
AgNW-coated fibers were dipped into PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow
Corning; 30:1 polymer to curing agent by weight) and cured at 70°C
for 1 hour. The joint between the fiber probe and the copper wire
was sealed with epoxy (Devcon, 5 Minute Epoxy) to enforce the con-
nection. The copper electrode lead was then connected to a four-pin
connector (Digi-Key ED90528-ND) for electrophysiological data acqui-
sition. Before implantation, the fiber probes were coated with molten
poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight, 1000) to temporarily stiffen
them for implantation.
Fiber probe characterization
Optical loss coefficients (in dB/cm) were measured by connecting fiber
probes of different lengths to a fiber-coupled 473-nm blue laser (Laser-
glow Technologies) via ferrule-to-ferrule connection with zirconia
sleeves (Thorlabs, ADAF1) and by collecting the power output with a
calibrated silicon photodiode (Thorlabs, S121C and PM100D).
Tip impedances of AgNW electrodes were measured in saline so-
lution (0.9 wt %) with an LCR meter (Agilent 4284A) (10 mV) in a
frequency range of 0.1 to 1000 kHz. Tensile tests were performed using
a nano tensile tester (MTS Nano Instrument UTM390).
Structural and surface analysis with microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy images were collected using a Zeiss Ultra-
55 microscope (4 kV). TEM was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit
TWIN (120 kV). Optical images were obtained using Zeiss Axioskop 2
MAT microscope with ×10 magnification.
In vivo studies
All procedures involving vertebrate animals were approved by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Committee on Animal
Care. No additional ethical guidelines were considered. Fiber probes
were evaluated in male Thy1-ChR2-YFP transgenic (donated by G. Feng)
and WT (BL6/57, The Jackson Laboratory) mice housed at the MIT
central animal facility (12-hour light/dark cycle at 22°C with food and
water ad libitum).
Fiber implantation
The AgNW- and PDMS-coated PC/COC and COCE fiber probes
were acutely and chronically implanted into the lumbar region of
the spinal cord of Thy1-ChR2-YFP and WT mice. The mice were an-
esthetized using isoflurane (5% induction followed by 1.75 to 2.0% in
oxygen). Supplemental heat was provided during the surgery. The fur
was removed over the dorsum, and the skin was cleaned with alcohol
and povidone iodine. One midline incision was made over vertebral
segments T13, L1, and L2. The paraspinal muscles were removed to
expose the vertebrae. Lateral spinal clamps were used to hold L1 in a
stereotaxic frame (Kopf, model 980). The spinal cord was exposed be-
tween L1 and L2 by further dissection. The neural probe was placed
on the surface of the dorsal side of spinal cord and then lowered by
300 mm into the spinal cord. For chronic implantation, the three
segments were fused with dental cement (Metabond, Parkell). This
step was omitted during acute experiments. The probes were connected
to the neural recording headstage and the optical patch cord (details
below) and then lowered into the spinal cord using a stereotaxic ma-
nipulator. A low-impedance ground/reference wire (stainless steel) was
coiled and placed next to the vertebral column. For chronic implanta-
tion, gelfoam was deposited around the probe tips, and the probes were
secured with dental cement to the three fused vertebral segments. The
mice were dosed with slow-release buprenorphine analgesia and recov-
ered on a warm pad.
Optical stimulation
Laser pulses were applied through the COCE and PC/COC fiber cores
to the spinal cord. A blue laser (diode-pumped solid-state; 473 nm,
100 mW; Laserglow) was coupled to a fiber patch cord [diameter,
50 mm; numerical aperture (NA), 0.22; silica; Thorlabs] with a custom
two-mirror setup on an optical breadboard. The patch fiber was
coupled to a fiber probe using a ferrule-to-ferrule ceramic sleeve.
The laser was controlled by the neural recording setup (Tucker-Davis
Technologies, RZ5D) to produce pulse trains of 1-s duration with 5-ms
pulses applied at 10 or 100 Hz. Optical power of 2.5 mW was measured
at the probe tip, leading to a power density of 125 to 168 mW/mm2 at
the surface of the spinal cord.

 Electrophysiological recordings in the spinal cord
Spontaneous and stimulus-evoked potentials were recorded using
AgNW mesh electrodes within the PC/COC- and COCE-based probes.
The mesh electrodes were connected to a high-impedance headstage
(Tucker-Davis Technologies, ZIF-Clip 32) through a custom PCB
adapter board. The signals were sampled at 48 kHz (PZ2, Tucker Davis
Technologies) and filtered (0.3 to 10 kHz; third-order infinite impulse
response) in Matlab (MathWorks). Single-neuron action potentials
(spikes) were isolated by detecting threshold crossings at 2 SDs from
the noise level, projecting the spikes onto the first two principal compo-
nents, and then clustering with k-means. ISI histograms were calculated
from the sorted units.
Electromyography
EMG signals were recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle with two
polytetrafluoroethylene-coated stainless steel wires [A-M Systems; di-
ameter, 50 mm/115 mm (bare/coated)]. The 1-mm tips of the wires were
exposed using a scalpel to reduce impedance before insertion into the
muscle belly with a 25-gauge needle. The EMG signals were amplified
by the high-impedance headstage and sampled at 48 kHz. Single-ended
recordings relative to a low-impedance distant reference and ground
were collected from each electrode. These recordings were low pass–
filtered (25th-order finite impulse response; 5-kHz corner frequency)
and subtracted in Matlab to produce a differential recording.
Sensory-evoked potentials
Sensory-evoked potentials were recorded from the dorsal columns
of anesthetized WT mice using AgNW mesh electrodes on PC/
COC cores. Electrical stimuli were applied peripherally to the ipsi-
lateral hindlimb. Two stainless steel wires, identical to those de-
scribed in the EMG section above, were inserted subcutaneously
near the ankle. One wire was placed medial to the ankle, and one wire
was placed lateral. Biphasic current pulses (125 ms per phase, 1 to
8 mA) were delivered every 2 s. The resulting volley of activity was
recorded at the dorsal columns with the AgNW electrodes. The exper-
iment was repeated after flipping the polarity of the biphasic pulse as a
control. An adaptive filter was applied to remove power-line noise
without introducing impulse response artifacts near the stimulus. The
area under the first positive peak was integrated at each stimulus level
to create a recruitment curve. The curve was fit to a sigmoid using a
weighted least-squares regression on a positive range (Matlab).
Immunohistochemistry
Long-term tissue responsesto the fiber probesimplanted over and with-
in the spinal cords were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Two
weeks after implantation with PC/COC/AgNW/PDMS or COCE/
AgNW/PDMS probes, WT mice (n = 3 per device) were anesthetized
via intraperitoneal injection of Fatal-Plus solution (100 mg/kg in saline)
and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Spinal cords were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA
overnight, and then sliced into 50-mm coronal sections using a vibrating
blade microtome (Leica VT1000S). Sections were permeabilized and
blocked in 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 3% (v/v) donkey serum in
PBS for 30 min. This was followed by overnight incubation at 4°C in
a solution of primary antibodies (goat anti-GFAP, 1:1000; rabbit anti-
NeuN, 1:500; Fisher Scientific) and 3% donkey serum in PBS. Following
incubation, the sections were washed three times for 30 min each with
PBS. The slices were then incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa
Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat, 1:1000; Alexa Fluor 633 donkey anti-rabbit,
1:1000; Life Technologies) for 1 hour at room temperature. Following
three more washes with PBS, slices were mounted using PVA-DABCO
(Sigma-Aldrich) onto glass microscope slides. A laser-scanning con-
focal microscope (FluoView FV1000, Olympus) with 10× (air, NA =
0.16) objective was used for image acquisition.
