The oligometastasis hypothesis suggests a spectrum of metastatic virulence where some
metastases are limited in extent and curable with focal therapies. A subset of patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer achieves prolonged survival after resection of liver metastases
consistent with oligometastasis. Here we define three robust subtypes of de novo colorectal
liver metastasis through integrative molecular analysis. Patients with metastases exhibiting
MSI-independent immune activation experience the most favorable survival. Subtypes with
adverse outcomes demonstrate VEGFA amplification in concert with (i) stromal, mesench-
ymal, and angiogenic signatures, or (ii) exclusive NOTCH1 and PIK3C2B mutations with E2F/
MYC activation. Molecular subtypes complement clinical risk stratification to distinguish low-
risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients with 10-year overall survivals of 94%, 45%, and
19%, respectively. Our findings provide a framework for integrated classification and treat-
ment of metastasis and support the biological basis of curable oligometastatic colorectal
cancer. These concepts may be applicable to many patients with metastatic cancer.

etastases are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
and frequently are widely disseminated, which has led
to the prevailing view that metastases are always
widespread. The oligometastasis hypothesis suggests that meta-
static spread is a spectrum of virulence where some metastases are
limited both in number and organ involvement and potentially
curable with surgical resection or other loco-regional therapies1,2.
This paradigm is in stark contrast to the outcomes of patients
with solid tumors where widespread metastases are largely fatal
despite recent advances in systemic therapy. To date, the oligo-
metastasis concept has been challenged, in large part, due to the
lack of supporting molecular data to identify metastases asso-
ciated with restricted spread3,4.
Limited metastasis is relatively common. Data from clinical
trials and single institution analyses of lung, breast, colorectal,
prostate and renal cancers suggest that as many as 40–60% of
patients with metastasis present with or develop limited disease5–
8. Patients with limited liver metastases from colorectal cancer
(CRC) have been consistently demonstrated to achieve prolonged
survival after hepatic resection9,10 and provide an opportunity to
investigate the molecular basis for oligometastasis. While there
have been extensive investigations into the molecular subtypes of
primary human cancers, little is known regarding molecular
subtypes of metastasis and their relation to clinical outcomes.
Here, utilizing independent clinical cohorts of CRC patients who
underwent resection of liver metastases, we identified integrated
molecular patterns in liver metastases associated with long-term
survival. Our findings indicate a molecular basis for oligometas-
tasis that is predictive of clinical outcome and complementary to
established clinical risk factors associated with long-term survival
following hepatic resection. Our findings may have important
clinical implications in the selection of local therapy for those
patients with potentially curable oligometastatic disease from
those whose few metastases are a part of a large cascade of
widespread disease. These concepts may be applicable to many
histological types of cancer.
Results
Clinical characteristics and patient outcomes. One hundred
thirty-four
patients
with
comprehensive
clinical
annotations
underwent hepatic resection of limited CRC liver metastases
(CRCLM). The clinical characteristics of these patients are sum-
marized in Table 1. The median patient age was 61 years (range,
29–85). Patients were diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma of
the colon (72%) or rectum (28%) and presented with either syn-
chronous (47%) or metachronous (53%) liver metastasis. The initial
number of liver metastases was one in 61%, two in 22% and three
or more in 17% of patients. Liver metastases were limited to one
hepatic lobe in 91% of patients and two hepatic lobes in 9% of
patients. Our analysis focused on de novo liver metastases and
excluded patients with extrahepatic disease or a history of pre-
viously resected metastasis. Patients received uniform treatment
with 5-fluorouracil-based perioperative chemotherapy, curative
intent management of primary colorectal tumors, and partial
hepatectomy of all visible liver metastases (Table 1). Post-
operatively all patients were surveilled with serial axial CT ima-
ging and serum CEA levels.
At a median follow-up of 49 months, 32% of patients had no
evidence of metastatic recurrence. These patients had a 10-year
OS of 77% whereas patients with clinically evident, recurrent
metastases exhibited a 10-year OS of 13% (P < 0.0001, log-rank
test) (Fig. 1a). We calculated Clinical Risk Scores (CRS), a widely
utilized prognostic tool for CRC patients undergoing liver
metastasis resection9,11,12, using the following adverse clinical
and pathological features: (1) disease-free interval between
primary
tumor
diagnosis
and
development
of
metastasis
<12 months, (2) number of liver metastases >1, (3) largest liver
metastasis >5.0 cm, (4) lymph node-positive primary CRC, and
(5) CEA >200 ng mL−1. 34% of patients exhibited a low CRS (less
than two adverse features). As expected, OS was significantly
greater for patients with low versus high CRS (two or more
adverse features) (10-year: 62% vs. 22%, P = 0.0008, log-rank test)
(Fig. 1b). These outcomes were consistent with those previously
reported in the literature9. In this context, we investigated
whether the intrinsic molecular features of CRCLM enhance the
identification of patients with long-term survival after hepatic
resection of limited metastases.

 Consensus molecular subtypes of primary colorectal cancer.
Gene expression analysis is an established approach for molecular
subtyping of primary human cancers13,14. The International
Colorectal Cancer Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC) demonstrated
the existence of four biologically and clinically distinct consensus
molecular subtypes (CMS) of CRC based on gene expression
analysis of 3962 primary tumors15,16. However, it is unknown
whether CMS subtypes also exist in CRCLM. We first validated
the application of CMS classification to the analysis of RNA
Sequencing data from 558 primary CRC tumors in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA)17, which verified the expected frequencies
of CMS subtypes (Fig. 2a). We then applied the single-sample
CMS classifier to the analysis of two independent CRCLM
datasets derived from RNA Sequencing analysis of 93 patients in
our study (Cohorts UC and NS in Fig. 2a), which demonstrated
CMS2 and CMS4 patterns in 62 and 12% of liver metastases with
a notable absence of CMS1 (1%) and CMS3 (0%) patterns
(Fig. 2a). We examined whether this result was related to selec-
tion bias for patients with limited, resectable metastatic disease or
was generalizable to widely metastatic or unresectable CRCLM. In
five independent datasets comprising an additional 234 CRCLMs
derived from either hepatic resection (60% of samples) or biopsy
due to unresectable or widely metastatic disease (40% of samples),
we observed similar frequencies of CMS2 and CMS4 patterns in
60 and 7% (vs. 37 and 23% of primary CRC). CMS1 and
CMS3 subtypes comprised 2 and 1% of liver metastases (vs. 14
and 13% of primary CRC). In addition, 30% of CRCLM were
unclassifiable based on CMS subtypes (Fig. 2a). While CMS
classes were associated with distinct clinical outcomes in primary
CRCs, we observed no association between CMS subtypes and OS
in patients with resected liver metastases (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Integrated subtypes of colorectal liver metastasis.
Tran-
scriptomic analyses using consensus clustering of individual
mRNA or miRNA datasets were limited in the molecular sub-
typing of colorectal liver metastases (Supplementary Figs 3 and
4). Based on previous work which demonstrated coordinated
miRNA-mRNA transcriptional networks underlying metastatic
phenotypes, as well as primary CRC subtypes18–21, we performed
an integrated expression analysis to uncover novel intrinsic
subtypes of CRCLM. We utilized the similarity network fusion
(SNF) algorithm to incorporate parallel miRNA and mRNA
networks in 93 patient samples independently of clinical,
pathological, or survival data. SNF is a computational method for
integration of diverse types of data with superior performance in
the identification of cancer subtypes when compared to single
data and established integrative approaches22. We identified three
distinct molecular subtypes of CRCLM denoted SNF1 (subtype 1;
33%), SNF2 (subtype 2; 28%), and SNF3 (subtype 3; 39%)
(Fig. 2b). Despite the detection of subtypes solely based on
molecular features, we found the SNF subtypes exhibited het-
erogeneous clinical outcomes with 10-year OS of 37%, 64%, and
20%, respectively (P = 0.021, log-rank test) (Fig. 2c and Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). Using permutation analysis, we examined the
importance of the SNF cluster structure on its association with
OS. After 1000 randomized mRNA-miRNA permutations, we
found the SNF clustering algorithm was unlikely to generate our
empirical OS difference by chance (empirical P = 0.0007) (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7). Importantly, patients with subtype 2 metas-
tases experienced fewer metastatic recurrences or deaths after
hepatic resection as compared to subtype 1 or subtype 3 metas-
tases (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8), and metastatic recur-
rences of subtype 2 metastases were significantly more likely to be
limited in number, defined as 1–3 subsequent metastases, as
compared to subtype 1 or subtype 3 metastases (Fig. 2d).
Each subtype demonstrated distinct patterns of mRNA and
miRNA expressions (Fig. 2e). Subtype 2 and subtype 3 metastases
displayed similar patterns of primary CRC CMS subtypes
whereas, by contrast, subtype 1 metastases almost exclusively
exhibited the CMS2 pattern (Supplementary Fig. 9). However,
only 10, 5.6, and 16% of subtypes 1-specific, 2-specific, and
3-specific gene sets overlapped with the CMS classifier suggesting
that molecular subtyping provided unique classification of CRC
tumors. In addition, the type of perioperative chemotherapy had
no effect on the molecular patterns (Supplementary Fig. 10) or
overall survival of resected CRCLM. Given that independent
datasets of integrated molecular data do not exist for clinically
annotated CRCLM, we trained and validated an mRNA-based
classifier to identify subtype 2-specific transcriptional patterns in
patient samples. We found the molecular classifier accurately
identified subtype 2 patients with 100% sensitivity and 81%
specificity in our patient cohort (Supplementary Fig. 11A,B). In a
separate dataset of CRCLM patients with similar clinical and
pathological features treated with hepatic resection at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (n = 96), metastases
classified as subtype 2 were confirmed to demonstrate favorable

subtypes.
Ensemble of Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (EGSEA) provided
substantial insight into the biological features of the subtypes of
CRC liver metastases (Fig. 3a). EGSEA quantifies the enrichment
of biologically defined gene sets within a gene expression pro-
file23. We found subtype 3 metastases showed enrichment for
expression patterns associated with high stromal infiltration,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix
remodeling, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and KRAS
signaling (Fig. 3a). Subtype 2 metastases similarly exhibited
enrichment for EMT and KRAS pathways; however, these
metastases were distinguished by high immune infiltration,
enrichment of interferon alpha and gamma signatures, and acti-
vation of p53 pathways. In concert with these findings, subtype
2 significantly overexpressed innate and adaptive immune genes,
such as those which mediate T cell activation and crosstalk
between antigen presenting cells and T cells, as compared to
subtype 1 and subtype 3 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Data 6).
Subtype 1 metastases displayed both low stromal and low
immune infiltration signatures but were markedly enriched for
E2F/MYC
signaling,
including
TERT
(telomerase)
over-
expression, as well as abnormalities in DNA damage signaling
and cell cycle checkpoints.
Importantly, CRCLM subtypes were also discernible at the
histological level (Supplementary Fig. 12). Subtype 2 metastases
exhibited dense band-like peritumoral infiltration of CD3-positive
and CD8-positive lymphocytes extending intratumorally, and
trichrome staining demonstrated minimal fibrosis, whereas subtype
3 metastases were distinguished by marked intratumoral and
peritumoral
fibrosis
which
harbored
peritumorally
restricted
lymphocytic infiltrate. In contrast, subtype 1 metastases revealed
prominent nests of tumor cells with minimal CD3-positive or
CD8-positive cells or fibrosis. These findings demonstrated unique
properties of molecular subtypes associate with differential patient
outcomes after hepatic resection of limited CRCLM.

 Mutational and copy number landscapes. Fifty-nine liver
metastases and matched normal liver specimens underwent next-
generation genomic sequencing using OncoPlus, a clinically
validated hybrid capture genomic sequencing platform compris-
ing 1212 commonly altered cancer genes for mutational and copy
number analyses24. Mutation significance (MutSig) analysis
confirmed enrichment in CRC driver gene mutations of APC,
TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, SOX9, SMAD4, and FBXW7 in 83%, 73%,
37%, 20%, 14%, 14% and 12% of liver metastases, respectively
(Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 13, and Supplementary Data 7). In
addition, we observed frequent gene-level copy number varia-
tions, including amplifications of VEGFA (Fig. 3c), MYC, and
ERBB2 and deletion of MAP2K4, which were previously described
for primary CRC17. We also found mutational patterns reflected
the anatomic location of the primary tumor origin of liver
metastases. Eighty-three percent of liver metastases from right-
sided colon cancers exhibited activating somatic mutations in
KRAS, in contrast to 24% from left-sided cancers (P = 0.0005,
Fisher’s exact test). Also, PIK3CA mutations occurred in 50% of
metastases derived from right-sided primary tumors versus 8%
from left-sided primary tumors (P = 0.0038, Fisher’s exact test).
We extended these findings by characterizing the mutational
and copy number landscapes of CRCLM by molecular subtypes.
We identified unique somatic mutations in each subtype (Fig. 3d
and Supplementary Data 8). Subtype 3 demonstrated exclusive
somatic mutations in SMAD3, whereas NOTCH1 and PIK3C2B
mutations occurred only in subtype 1. By contrast, NRAS,
CDK12, and EBF1 mutations were unique to subtype 2 (Fig. 3d).
In addition, amplification of VEGFA was more prevalent in
subtypes 1 and 3 as compared to subtype 2 (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Data 8). Notably, we found no significant
differences in the frequency of KRAS or BRAF mutations across
subtypes. Taken together, these data support the notion that
subtypes of CRCLM harbor distinct genomic aberrations.
Furthermore, we found the median number of mutations per
sample was not statistically different across molecular subtypes.
Given that mismatch repair deficiency leading to microsatellite
instability (MSI) contributes to tumor hypermutation in association
with cytotoxic immune infiltration25, we investigated whether MSI
explained the immune subtype 2. We identified an MSI phenotype
in 3.4% of patients, which is consistent with the incidence of MSI in
metastatic colorectal cancer26. However, only one subtype 2
metastasis demonstrated an MSI-high phenotype, while two
metastases—one from subtype 1 and one from subtype 2, exhibited
an MSI-low phenotype. The subtype 2 MSI-high and MSI-low
metastases, but not subtype 1 MSI-low metastasis, showed
significant enrichment of cytotoxic cell signature expression
(Supplementary Fig. 14). Although mutational burden did not

 correspond to the subtype 2 immune subtype, increased mutational
burden associated with MSI in subtype 2, including hypermutation
(n = 1760 mutations) in the MSI-low metastasis related to POLE
mutation. In addition, recent data suggest that specific mutations
also predict cytotoxic immune responses27. In this regard, ARID2
mutations are associated with increased cytolytic activity in multiple
types of cancers. In our dataset, we also found a significant elevation
in cytotoxic immune responses in patients with somatic ARID2
mutations (Supplementary Fig. 14). As well, metastases with
subtype 2-specific mutations in CDK12, NRAS, or EBF1, in contrast
to metastases with subtype 1- or subtype 3-specific mutations in
NOTCH1, PIK3C2B, or SMAD3, showed significant enrichment for
cytotoxic immune responses (P = 0.034, Student’s t-test). Taken
together, these findings identify novel mutations associated with
immune responses and favorable clinical outcomes of CRCLM.
Integrated risk stratification. We investigated whether molecular
subtyping could improve clinical risk stratification after hepatic
resection of CRCLM by augmenting the prognostic effect of CRS.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated the
prognostic impact of SNF-based molecular subtypes was statis-
tically complementary to CRS (Supplementary Fig. 15). Integra-
tion of molecular subtypes and CRS yielded three prognostic risk
groups: (1) low-risk (22% of patients)—subtypes 1 and 2 with low
CRS; (2) intermediate-risk (29% of patients)—subtype 2 with
high CRS and subtype 3 with low CRS; (3) high-risk patients
(49% of patients)—subtypes 1 and 3 with high CRS (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 15). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard
analyses incorporating primary tumor anatomic site, type of
perioperative chemotherapy, treatment year, or mutational data,
including KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation, or MSI, did not
independently contribute to prognostication in our cohort. Ten-
year OS for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were
94%, 45%, and 19%, respectively, at median follow-up times of 76,
54, and 40 months (Fig. 4a). Notably, while patients with subtype
1 metastases generally demonstrated unfavorable clinical out-
comes, a subset of subtype 1 metastases with low CRS (23%)
achieved long-term survival, which correlated with a reduced
frequency of extrahepatic metastatic recurrence in these patients
in contrast to subtype 1 metastases with high CRS (33% vs. 81%).
While distant metastasis-free survival significantly differed across
risk groups (median value—low-risk: 59 mo. vs. intermediate-
risk: 35 mo. vs. high-risk: 13 mo; P = 0.0021, log-rank test)
(Supplementary Fig. 16A), 47% of low-risk, 68% of intermediate-
risk, and 86% of high-risk patients developed subsequent meta-
static recurrence after hepatic resection (Supplementary Fig. 16B).
Importantly, metastatic recurrences were limited in number in
100% of low-risk patients in contrast to 87% of intermediate-risk
and 34% of high-risk patients (Fig. 4B) (P < 0.0001, Chi-square

types of CRCLM significantly improve clinical risk stratification
for the identification of patients with favorable prognoses after
hepatic resection of limited de novo CRCLM.
Discussion
We performed a multilevel, genome-wide investigation into the
molecular basis of liver metastases from primary CRC. We vali-
dated the presence of primary CRC expression subtypes, muta-
tions, and gene-level copy number variations within CRCLM, but
found these molecular features to have limited prognostic utility
in metastatic outcomes. Our findings support the notion that the
biological features important for primary tumor growth differ
from those enabling successful metastatic dissemination. In
contrast, integrated transcriptional analysis of mRNA and
miRNA networks identified three distinct subtypes of CRCLM
which complement clinical risk stratification for prediction of
long-term survival following hepatic resection of limited liver
metastases. This predictive power is based on the identification of
intrinsic molecular subtypes of de novo CRCLM, which associate
with distinct genomic patterns, metastatic recurrences and clin-
ical outcomes. Based on these findings, we propose the first
classification of clinical metastasis for CRCLM based on SNF
subtypes and their associated molecular and clinical features:
Subtype 1 = Canonical; Subtype 2 = Immune; Subtype 3 = Stro-
mal (Fig. 4c).
The concept of limited, curable metastasis has not always been
accepted due, in part, to the paucity of molecular evidence to
identify this unique entity. Our analysis focused on de novo liver
metastases as the initial site of metastasis in patients with no prior
history of metastatic disease. In this subgroup of patients, cure
was achieved in ~30% of patients following hepatic resection,
which is consistent with published studies9. Previous work has
compared the molecular patterns of matched primary CRC and
liver metastases or consecutive metastases within an individual
patient28,29. In contrast, we characterized inter-metastatic het-
erogeneity across individual patients to identify intrinsic mole-
cular
determinants
correlated
with
clinical
outcomes.
Importantly, our findings uncover previously unrecognized
molecular subtypes of clinical metastasis and support the notion
that the molecular heterogeneity of colorectal liver metastases
contributes to differences in clinical outcomes for patients.
The molecular subtypes of CRCLM emerged from our analysis
(Fig. 4c). We identified a relatively indolent immune-enriched
subtype of CRCLM, denoted subtype 2, which developed clini-
cally evident metastases limited in number. We also determined
MSI-independent mutations in subtype 2 metastases which
associate with increased cytotoxic immune responses. Subtype 3,
a
stroma-enriched
subtype
of
CRCLM,
displayed
well-
characterized pro-metastatic pathways mediating EMT and
angiogenesis in association with poor clinical outcomes. A
canonical molecular subtype associated with E2F/MYC, DNA
damage-related and cell cycle signaling showed variable meta-
static recurrence patterns and clinical outcomes. Integrated risk
classification by subtype and clinical risk scores (CRS) revealed a
low-risk group, defined by subtype 1 or 2 molecular patterns in
association with low CRS, with a 10-year overall survival of ~95%
(Fig. 4a). This integrated low-risk group is most consistent with
an oligometastatic phenotype.
Based on our findings, it might be speculated that there are
intrinsic tumor and extrinsic host factors that determine meta-
static virulence and that our indolent immune-enriched subtype
represents a form of immunological equilibrium30,31. These
immunologic features are contrasted with subtypes 1 and 3,
which do not exhibit immune markers and, thus, have escaped
due, in part, to failed immuno-editing, as well as tumor intrinsic
features. As such, the lack of adaptive immune responses in
metastases with subtype 1 or 3 patterns may have important
consequences concerning the responsiveness of such metastases
to immune checkpoint therapies; however, the DNA repair
abnormalities in subtype 1 metastases may induce hypersensi-
tivity to DNA-damaging agents, including PARP inhibitors,
whereas enrichment for angiogenic signatures may predict sen-
sitivity to bevacizumab in subtype 3 metastases.
Our study sheds light on the identification of patients with
potentially curable metastatic disease that might benefit from one
or more focal treatments of limited metastases, such as those
patients with low or intermediate integrated risks, versus those
whose primary treatment modality should be systemic therapies
with or without regional therapies, including those patients with
high integrated risk classification. Further investigation is neces-
sary to comprehensively characterize the molecular features of
oligometastases and to what extent these concepts apply to
patients with widespread disease or histological types other than
colorectal cancer. While significant advances have been made in
the understanding of widespread, lethal metastatic dissemina-
tion32–36, our study is the first to investigate the molecular basis
of potentially curable colorectal liver metastases. These results
may provide a framework for future studies that pertain to the
molecular classification of patients with limited metastatic disease
from different primary sites and metastatic location, thereby
providing a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with
metastatic disease.
Methods
Patients. We analyzed samples from 134 adults with liver metastases from primary
CRC of which 121 metastases from independent patients successfully underwent
molecular analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). The characteristics of these patients are
described in Table 1, Supplementary Data 1, and the Supplementary Methods. We
utilized a retrospective clinical cohort study design to identify patients who
received uniform treatment for limited (defined as 1–5 lesions involving one or
both hepatic lobes), resectable de novo CRC liver metastasis (CRCLM) at two
collaborating institutions. We obtained appropriate approval from Institutional
Review Boards at each respective cancer center.
Analytic platforms. We performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling for 116 samples
using Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 Arrays. We performed whole genome RNA
sequencing for 95 samples using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sequencing.
In addition, we performed hybrid capture genomic sequencing of liver metastases
and matched normal liver specimens from 59 patients using the OncoPlus panel24.
All sequencing was conducted on Illumina HiSeq sequencers. We performed
microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis on 89 samples using the Promega MSI 1.2
clinical assay according to FDA approved guidelines. Clinical data were frozen on
April 30, 2016 and molecular data were frozen on June 26, 2016. Overall survival
(OS), defined as the interval between hepatic resection and death from any cause or
until censoring at the time the patient was last known to be alive, was chosen as the
optimal primary endpoint. The complete list of datasets is provided in Supple-
mentary Data 1.
Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis included Fisher’s exact tests for asso-
ciations of categorical variables when there were two categories or Chi-square tests
when there were three categories. Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazard
analyses were used to examine the associations of molecular features with clinical
outcomes. Multiple testing corrections were performed using the Benjamini-
Hochberg method. All reported P-values are two-sided. A complete description of
the methods is available in the Supplementary Information.
Data availability. RNA Sequencing data have been deposited at the European
Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), which is hosted by the EBI and the CRG, under
accession number EGAS00001002945.
