The incidence of noncommunicable diseases is on the rise and poses a major threat to global public
health. This is in parallel to a steady increase in worldwide intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)
among all age groups. As several studies demonstrated a controversial relationship between SSB
consumption and the metabolic syndrome (MetS), this mini-review focuses on links between its intake
and (1) MetS, (2) prediabetes/type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and (3) hypertension. A detailed search
for clinical and observational studies published during the past 10 years was conducted using key terms
that link SSBs to the MetS, T2DM, and hypertension. Here we excluded all meta-analyses and also
literature that solely focused on obesity. The analysis revealed that most epidemiological studies
strongly show that frequent SSB intake contributes to the onset of the MetS in the longer term. Some of
the findings also show that regular SSB intake can alter glucose handling and insulin sensitivity,
thereby contributing to the development of the MetS and T2DM. There is also evidence that frequent
SSB intake (and particularly fructose) is linked to hypertension and well-known cardiovascular disease
risk factors. However, some studies report on the lack of negative effects as a result of SSB consumption.
Because of this discrepancy, we propose that well-designed long-term clinical studies should further
enhance our understanding regarding the links between SSB consumption and the onset of car-
diometabolic diseases.

During 2011, the United Nations announced for the first time that noncommunicable diseases
pose a greater health risk than infectious diseases in both developed and developing countries
[1]. The World Health Organization estimates that noncommunicable diseases result in 38
million deaths annually, with cardiometabolic diseases accounting for ~19 million fatalities
[2]. The umbrella term cardiometabolic diseases describes both cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) and conditions such as the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). Furthermore, obesity, MetS, and T2DM are all risk factors for the onset of CVD, the
current leading cause of global mortality [3]. Beside such risk factors, sugar-sweetened
beverage (SSB) intake can also drive CVD onset by promoting hypertension, inflamma-
tion, and dyslipidemia [4].
The increased prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders is strongly linked to greater ur-
banization and the adoption of detrimental lifestyle choices that include sedentary behavior,
smoking, and poor dietary preferences. For example, excess sugar consumption has surfaced

 as one of the most prominent global dietary changes during the past few decades and is
considered a primary driver of cardiometabolic disease onset [5]. In support, a 5-year South
African Adult Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology cohort study showed an association
between higher consumption of added sugars and sucrose-sweetened beverages with in-
creased noncommunicable disease risk factors [6]. It was also recently established that 74% of
the 85,451 different edible products (mainly cereals, energy bars, and beverages) on the US
market contained added sugars [7]. Here SSBs emerge as a strong culprit with estimates
showing that it provides ~46% of added sugars [8]. Nevertheless, there is controversy re-
garding findings from various studies investigating the relationship between SSBs and the
onset of cardiometabolic diseases [9–13]. In light of this, the current mini-review explores the
links between SSB intake and the risks for cardiometabolic disease development, focusing on
three main aspects: MetS, T2DM, and hypertension.
1. Methods
For the present review, three searches for clinical (including all clinical trial phases, clinical
studies, controlled clinical trials, randomized controlled trials) and observational studies
were performed. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were not considered for this review
process. The term sugar is often being used to represent a range of different molecules, and for
the purposes of the current review article, it includes sucrose, glucose, fructose, high-fructose
corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners. The first search was performed on the link between
SSBs and the MetS where we used two keyword combinations: sugar-sweetened beverages and
metabolic syndrome and sugar-sweetened beverages and cardiometabolic risk. The search was
performed in PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and only human studies
(written in English) and published within the past decade were selected. This search yielded a
total of 12 results.
For the second search, we aimed to establish the link between SSBs and the risk for T2DM.
Using the same parameters mentioned previously, the search phrases included sugar-
sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes and sugar-sweetened beverages and prediabetes.
This search yielded a total of 16 results. The third search focused on SSBs and hypertension
using the same parameters described previously. Here search terms included sugar-
sweetened beverages and hypertension and sugar-sweetened beverages and blood pressure.
The search yielded a total of eight results.
The searches are the latest as of September 2017. The extra literature included in this
review was identified separately (not using our systematic review criteria) to demonstrate
additional aspects within this field. Although obesity forms a component of MetS, it will not be
reviewed in detail as it falls beyond the scope of the current mini-review. During such
searches, we observed that there was an overlap with some of the articles as would be
predicted because the MetS includes impaired glucose metabolism and increased blood
pressure.
2. Results
We have structured our results in the same way as the search criteria stipulated in the
Methods section of this article.
A. SSBs and the MetS/Cardiometabolic Risk
The literature revealed, at times, contradictory observations in terms of the relationship
between SSBs and the MetS. High SSB consumption is considered a risk factor for the onset of
the MetS [4], which refers to a cluster of complications that manifest concurrently and serves
as a prognostic tool for the future development of T2DM and CVD. Limited clinical and
observational trials assess the contribution of SSBs to the MetS. Here some studies do show a

 direct correlation [14], whereas in other cases, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to link
SSBs to all the comorbidities associated with the MetS [15, 16].
Despite such contradictory findings, most studies thus far completed support a link be-
tween SSB intake and the MetS. Here all but one of the studies showed that SSBs promote the
risk of developing some or all the components of the MetS [14–24]. In support, Dhingra et al.
[17] found that the odds of developing the MetS (the mean follow-up period was 4 years) is
significantly higher in individuals who consume one or more SSB servings daily [odds ra-
tio,1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20 to 1.74). The Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea
prospective study also found that the frequent intake of SSBs (.5 servings/wk), artificially
sweetened beverages, and natural and bottled fruit juices was associated with an increased
risk for the MetS and some of its components [25]. SSB effects are also related to ethnicity; for
example, African Americans (28 to 40 years old) who consumed relatively higher SSB
amounts (.2 per day), but not moderate dosages, displayed kidney damage as indicated by
increased levels of microalbuminuria [26].
De Ruyter et al. [27] conducted a small study to establish whether SSB consumption
induced weight gain. Here children (4 to 11 years old) of normal weight were assigned to either
experimental or control groups in a double-blinded manner and were expected to consume
250 mL SSB or 250 mL artificially sweetened beverage, respectively, on a daily basis. The
authors found that body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip
ratio, and body fat percentage increased significantly in the SSB group compared with the
artificially sweetened group after the 18-month intervention period. A substantial increase in
body weight and BMI was observed only in the group consuming glucose-sweetened bev-
erages, whereas sucrose- and fructose-sweetened drinks induced changes in the waist cir-
cumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Of note, others found a decrease in body weight and BMI in
fructose-consuming participants [28], whereas another study also did not support the link
between SSB consumption and weight gain [29]. This could possibly be explained by the
shorter intervention period (6 months), although the intervention itself was more intense (1 L
sucrose-sweetened beverage/d compared with 250 mL/d).
SSB consumption may also trigger effects that occur independently of body weight and
energy balance changes. For example, some reported increased low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels that were induced by the intake of fructose-sweetened beverages [30]. Here
metabolites such as triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, and uric acid levels also increased in a
dose-dependent manner with SSB intake. Bruun et al. [31] reported similar findings (i.e., the
daily intake of regular cola for 6 months enhanced circulating uric acid levels in overweight
and obese participants). Other cross-sectional studies in adolescents also showed that SSB
increased serum uric acid in association with hypertension [32] and pediatric insulin re-
sistance [33]. By contrast, some established that moderate SSB intake did not affect fasting or
postprandial cholesterol and triglyceride levels or hepatic insulin clearance [34]. The lack of
any effects might be attributed to the short duration of the study (only done over a 2-week
period), thus providing a likely explanation why no discernable effects were observed at this
relatively early time point.
In addition to ethnicity, sex is also a factor that may account for the different observations
discussed. In support, a recent prospective study by Kang and Kim [35] showed increased
MetS parameters were associated with frequent consumers of soft drinks (.4 servings/wk),
but only in females and not in men. Together, the bulk of epidemiological data strongly
indicates that frequent SSB intake is linked to the MetS, with potentially serious long-term
effects on overall health and well-being (Table 1).
B. SSBs and Prediabetes/T2DM
Epidemiological studies reported that regular SSB consumption, in some cases as little as two
SSB servings per week, is linked to a greater risk for the development of T2DM (36, 37). The
negative effects of SSB consumption may also further exacerbate the already impaired
glucose metabolism underlying T2DM [38]. As most studies used specific intervals of SSB

 consumption (lowest: ,1 SSB per month; highest: $1 SSB per day), Fagherazzi et al. [5]
designed a model to describe the continuous correlation between SSB consumption and T2DM
development. These findings revealed that the consumption of SSB (0 to 1000 mL/wk) is
directly related to a greater T2DM risk (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.66) [39]. Moreover,
the 14-year prospective Framingham study showed an association between increased insulin
resistance and a higher risk of developing prediabetes with regular SSB intake but not for

 diet-type beverages [40]. In addition, ethnicity, sex, and age may influence the interplay
between SSB intake and the onset of T2DM [41] (Table 2).
Daily SSB intake for 6 months also increased ectopic fat accumulation (liver, skeletal
muscle, visceral depots) [29], whereas another study reported that replacement of SSBs with
artificially sweetened beverages decreased intrahepatic fat over a 12-week period [45]. As
ectopic fat accumulation is linked to insulin resistance and T2DM, this may represent early
signs of longer-term damaging effects elicited by regular SSB intake. A 4-week observational
study in which healthy participants received SSB supplementation showed a metabolic
adaptation with a shift toward carbohydrates, increasing glycolytic and lipogenic gene ex-
pression that is likely the cause of altered glucose metabolism [46]. Similarly, a cross-sectional
observational study showed altered glucose homeostasis following consumption of SSB vs
consumption of dairy products [43]. A prediction-type study found that a 10% to 12% reduction
in SSB consumption would lower new cases of diabetes, coronary heart disease, and myo-
cardial infarctions [9]. Of note, this reduction is projected to have the most impact on African
Americans, especially those who fall within the lower-income bracket [9]. Despite some
contradictory studies, the collective data at present provide robust evidence that SSB intake
plays a central role in the onset of T2DM.
C. SSBs and Hypertension/Blood Pressure
Obesity, MetS, and T2DM are all risk factors for the onset of CVD, the leading cause of global
mortality [3]. Besides such risk factors, SSB intake can also drive the onset of CVD by
promoting hypertension, inflammation, and dyslipidemia [4]. For example, Kim et al. [47]
found that daily SSB consumption ($1 to ,3 servings) is linked to an increased risk for
developing hypertension (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.20) (refer to Table 3). Some studies
show that SSB intake specifically elevates systolic blood pressure [32, 48], whereas others
found that it raised diastolic blood pressure [53]. However, one such study [32] was criticized
as the published adult norms were directly applied to an adolescent cohort (54). A pooled

 analysis of three prospective cohorts (Nurses’ Health Studies I and II and the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-up Study; total N . 220,000) supports the notion that there is a higher
incidence of hypertension among those consuming $1 SSB serving/d compared with non-
consumers (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17) [50]. Interestingly, the association between
carbonated drinks and hypertension was also significantly stronger compared with non-
carbonated ones for all three cohorts, whereas the consumption of cola-containing SSBs also
indicated a robust link to hypertension compared with noncola ones (Nurses’ Health Study I;
Health Professionals Follow-up Study). Other prospective studies provide additional evidence for
an association between regular SSB intake and the development of hypertension [24], whereas
some demonstrated that blood pressure can be successfully lowered by decreasing SSB con-
sumption [49]. In support, some showed beneficial effects of artificial sweetener consumption
(erythritol) on reducing arterialstiffness and antihypertensive effects in the context of T2DM [55].
Although most studies detect a positive association between SSB consumption and hypertension,
the adjusted risk is not always significant [17, 24], and it is therefore essential that more robust
interventional studies be initiated to confirm such findings.
The International Study of Macro/Micro-Nutrients and Blood Pressure found that par-
ticipants consuming .1 SSB serving/d exhibited statistically significant increases in systolic
and diastolic blood pressures [48]. They also discovered that the mean energy intake was
lower in nonconsumers compared with those who consumed #1 SSB serving/d and even
significantly lower in those who consumed .1 SSB serving/d. These participants also
displayed a higher BMI vs nonconsumers (30.2 vs 28.4 kg/m2) [48]. In support, others found a
significantly higher risk for hypertension with increasing SSB intake (especially in females);
that is, hazard ratios for new-onset hypertension were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03; 1 to 4 SSB/
mo), 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.08; 2 to 6 SSB/wk), and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17; $1 SSB/d) vs
those who consumed #1 SSB/mo [50]. Furthermore, Sayon-Orea et al. [51] identified 1308

 new hypertension cases in their 6-year follow-up Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra Study
and established that increased SSB consumption was associated with 26% higher odds of
developing hypertension—this association was especially strong in women.
One study compared blood pressures in adolescents from 20 public schools in Brazil [52],
and after adjusting for confounding factors, they found higher systolic blood pressure and
diastolic blood pressure values for youngsters consuming SSBs. Others investigated the
effects of the monosaccharides glucose, fructose, and sucrose on blood pressure. Here they
showed that fructose and glucose triggered opposite effects, with fructose resulting in in-
creased blood pressure due to increased total peripheral resistance, unlike glucose [56]. The
impact of varying SSB doses within this context is best demonstrated by focusing on studies
aiming to lower consumption. For example, a reduction of 1 SSB serving/d resulted in a
decrease of 2 and 1.2 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively [49].
3. Discussion
Long-term epidemiological studies provide sufficient evidence to prove a positive association
between SSB and weight gain and the eventual risk for developing MetS [4]. However, it is
important to also consider studies (limited number) that report negative or neutral results
with SSB intake. Here the lack of standardization of measurements used to assess obesity can
make it difficult to interpret and compare the results of various published studies [57]. For
example, although some only measured weight gain, others determined BMI, waist-to-hip
ratio, and skinfold thickness (all markers of obesity).
SSBs are energy dense, and their consumption is associated with excessive caloric intake
and subsequent weight gain [58], and such changes can induce cardiometabolic perturbations.
For example, SSB drinkers—especially young African Americans—are more likely to con-
sume salty and sweet snacks [59]. In a study on the Australian population, SSBs contributed

 to the highest added sugar intake, causing more than half of the total population to exceed the
free sugar intake norms set by the World Health Organization [60]. Alarmingly, this effect
was predominantly observed in children and adolescents. Epidemiological studies are not
sufficient to establish causality between SSB consumption and the development of car-
diometabolic diseases. For this reason, there is a great need for clinical intervention studies to
support existing findings. Clinical studies may also help reveal plausible molecular mech-
anisms—a necessary step in establishing causality between SSB consumption and car-
diometabolic pathophysiology [61]. These findings may provide some insights into the
mechanisms at play and may help explain why some failed to detect changes in body weight.
Unfortunately, there are limited clinical findings available regarding SSB intake and the
onset of cardiometabolic diseases, and most of the available studies have some drawbacks as
reviewed before [62].
An assessment of the metabolic health of 5107 individuals from the Framingham Heart
Study Offspring and third-generation cohorts showed that, irrespective of weight, SSB
consumers were at a higher risk for the onset of metabolic abnormalities such as hyper-
tension, insulin resistance, high fasting glucose and triglycerides, and lower high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels [11]. Aerberli et al. [63] explained that higher glucose con-
sumption stimulates an intensified insulin response to promote the deposition of sub-
cutaneous fat, thereby increasing the BMI. By contrast, fructose (and sucrose to some extent)
possesses a lower glycemic load and does not trigger the release of insulin to the same degree
as glucose. Thus, the activity of lipoprotein lipase is reduced and the deposition of visceral fat
is favored, resulting in an increase in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (also con-
cluded by Stanhope et al. [30]). Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio are markers of

 abdominal obesity—a key feature of the MetS—indicating that SSB consumption can elicit
detrimental consequences even if it does not always reflect in overall body weight.
Some studies also provide insight into the effects on glucose handling; for example, some
found that SSB intake attenuated insulin sensitivity [43]. Moreover, participants consuming
glucose- or fructose-sweetened drinks display elevated fasting blood glucose levels [30, 63].
This is a noteworthy result considering that such beverage intake elicited no effects on fasting
insulin levels. Here glucose consumption resulted in a spike in insulin levels [30], whereas it
decreased in response to fructose intake. Indeed, individuals consuming either glucose- or
fructose-sweetened beverages for 10 weeks displayed a ~17% decrease in insulin sensitivity
with fructose consumption, explaining the rise in fasting blood glucose levels associated with
fructose intake [30]. Of note, the adverse effects of SSBs are mainly attributed to the fructose
component as it has been suggested to upregulate lipid production, leading to increases in
liver fat content [30, 64]. The lack of negative effects observed with diet-type beverages in
some of the studies may possibly result due to its effect on gut hormones (e.g., glucagon-like
peptide 1) that promote insulin secretion [65].
After careful examination of the available clinical studies, it is clear that SSB consumption
does trigger metabolic perturbations together with the development of obesity. Here some of
the findings show that frequent SSB consumption can alter hepatic insulin sensitivity and fat
accumulation, thereby contributing to the development of the MetS and T2DM. SSB intake is
also linked to dyslipidemia, higher uric acid levels, and inflammation (known CVD risk
factors) [4]. Although none of the clinical studies support a link between SSB consumption and
the onset of hypertension, there is some support for a link between SSB intake and in-
flammation. For example, some observed higher C-reactive protein levels of young men
consuming SSB for a 3-week period [28, 63].
SSB consumption has been widely studied in different ethnic groups as well as varying
age groups. The consumption of SSB is closely linked to socioeconomic class, with poorer
communities displaying relatively higher intakes compared with their more affluent
counterparts. For example, the Native American Indian population exhibits a relatively
high prevalence of obesity and T2DM, and here it was reported that a significant per-
centage of Navajo girls and boys consumed SSBs (86% and 93%, respectively) [66].
Together these studies show that SSB intake not only is detrimental to the adult
population but extends to adolescents as well and that its effects may vary depending on
ethnicity.
4. Conclusion
Recent data show that SSB consumption has increased globally, thus putting many at risk for
the onset of weight gain, T2DM, hypertension, CVD, and other chronic illnesses. The
mechanisms whereby such diseases progress are closely linked to insulin resistance, pan-
creatic b-cell dysfunction, visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. The current
mini-review evaluated recent literature (past decade) and shows that SSB consumption
worsens the risk for MetS, T2DM, and CVD onset. However, there are limitations; for ex-
ample, many do not take the sex and/or ethnicity of participants into account, although it is
evident that such factors may contribute to the complexity of the results. The short-term
nature of numerous studies is also a problem as long-term effects can therefore only be
projected or predicted. Together these data highlight the need for (1) well-designed basic and
clinical studies to obtain a clearer picture, (2) further research into the molecular mechanisms
underlying the development of such debilitating conditions, and (3) increased roll-out of
educational programs to inform the general public of the harmful effects of high SSB intake.
