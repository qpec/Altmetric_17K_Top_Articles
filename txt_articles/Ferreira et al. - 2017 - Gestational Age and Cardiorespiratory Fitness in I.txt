 Gestational Age and Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Individuals Born At
Term: A Life Course Study
Isabel Ferreira, PhD; Pei T. Gbatu, PhD; Colin A. Boreham, PhD
Background-—In contrast to the effects of preterm birth, the extent to which shorter gestational age affects the cardiorespiratory
fitness (CRF) levels of individuals who were born at term (ie, between 37 and 42 weeks) is largely unknown. The aim of this study
was to examine whether life-course CRF levels varied across different gestational ages within the at-term range.
Methods and Results-—The association between gestational age (in weeks) obtained from Child Health Services records and CRF,
estimated from field and laboratory tests and expressed by maximal oxygen uptake level through adolescence to young adulthood,
was examined in 791 participants in the Northern Ireland Young Hearts Study, all singletons born at term. Longitudinal data were
analyzed with generalized estimating equations, accounting for important potential confounders. Mean levels of CRF were 45.6,
43.7, and 33.0 mL/kg per minute when participants were aged 12, 15, and 22 years, respectively. After adjustment for
confounders, each week increase in gestational age was associated with 0.46 mL/kg per minute (95% confidence interval, 0.14–
0.79) in CRF. Compared with individuals born full term (39–40 weeks, n=533) or late term (41–42 weeks, n=148), those who were
born early term (37–38 weeks, n=110) had a higher incidence of poor CRF (risk ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.16).
The changes in CRF through adolescence to young adulthood were similar across groups, with those born early term consistently
displaying the lowest CRF.
Conclusions-—These findings suggest that early-term births within the at-term range are linked to poorer CRF through adolescence
to young adulthood, and may have important clinical and public health implications for policies about (avoidable) early-term
deliveries given their recent increasing trends. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e006467. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.006467.)
Key Words: cardiorespiratory fitness • gestational age • longitudinal cohort study
I
ncreases in preterm births1 and recent trends towards
shorter gestational lengths within the at-term period (ie,
37–42 weeks)2,3 have revived the interest in the associations
between gestational age and offspring health outcomes.
Indeed, it is becoming increasingly evident that shorter
gestation, even within the at-term period, may lead to adverse
health outcomes, such as neonatal and infant neurological,
cognitive, and respiratory morbidity4–11 and mortality.2,12–14
Altogether, these findings suggest that infants born at term
form a heterogeneous group among whom longer-term health
outcomes related to different gestational ages need to be
investigated further.
One such important health outcome is cardiorespiratory
fitness (CRF), a component of physical fitness that reflects the
ability of the respiratory, circulatory, and muscular systems to
supply oxygen to the exercising muscles during physical
activity. CRF is a major determinant of metabolic and cardio-
vascular health during youth and later in life.15–17 Although it
can be improved by postnatal experiences, particularly through
regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity,15 there
is evidence to suggest that gestational age may play a critical
role as well.18–29 However, most of the studies that have
investigated this were confined to CRF comparisons between
survivors of extremely or very preterm birth and term-born
controls,18–24,26–28 often involving small sample sizes and
insufficient control for confounding. In addition, all considered
the term-born comparator as a homogeneous group,18–29 and
CRF was often examined at 1 point in the individual’s life
only,18–26,29 mainly childhood or adolescence,18–20,22–24,26 but
rarely through28 and beyond27 these critical periods.

 In view of these considerations, we examined data from
participants in a longitudinal cohort study to ascertain the
extent to which CRF levels, through adolescence into young
adulthood, vary across different gestational lengths within the
at-term age range.
Methods
Study Design
The present study examines longitudinal data from partici-
pants in the Northern Ireland Young Hearts Project, a
prospective cohort study that was designed to investigate
the development of lifestyle and biological cardiovascular risk
factors through adolescence to young adulthood.30–34 The
study design and sampling procedures were described in
detail elsewhere.30 Briefly, a 2-stage cluster sampling proce-
dure, with allowance for an expected 20% nonresponse rate,
was used to select a 2% representative sample of boys and
girls aged 12 and 15 years, considering the geographical
spread and the different categories of school in Northern
Ireland. One thousand fifteen students (509 aged 12 years
and 506 aged 15 years) were enrolled into the study and were
examined at the first wave (YH1) in 1989 to 1990 (78%
response rate). The 12 year olds were reexamined with the
same methods and procedures 3 years later (YH2; n=461,
91%). Between 1997 and 1999, all participants, then aged 20
to 25 years, were invited for a third evaluation (YH3); 48% of
the original YH1 population, including 12 aged 12 years who
did not participate in YH2, agreed to participate (n=489).
Despite multiple efforts to relocate the participants, approx-
imately half did not return for YH3. The reasons given were as
follows: now living outside the region/too far to travel, busy
with work/family commitments, and no longer interested.33
The representativeness of the Northern Ireland Young Hearts
Project participants at the YH3 wave has been examined
before.35 Specifically, dropouts tended to have higher blood
pressure and adiposity levels and more often belonged to
families of lower socioeconomic status (SES), but did not
differ with regard to lifestyle risk factors (ie, physical activity,
alcohol consumption, total energy intake, and intake of foods
and nutrients) and CRF.35 The exact numbers of participants
were 509 at the age of 12 years, 967 at the age of 15 years,
and 489 at the age of 20 to 25 years (Figure 1A).
For each wave of the study, ethical approval was obtained
from the Medical Research Ethical Committee of the Queen’s

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In singletons born at term (ie, at 37–42 weeks of gestation),
each week increase in gestational age is associated with
significantly
higher
levels
of
cardiopulmonary
fitness
through adolescence into young adulthood.
• Compared with full- and late-term births (39–42 weeks of
gestation), early-term births (37–38 weeks of gestation)
have �57% higher risk of developing poor cardiopulmonary
fitness levels during these age periods.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Cardiovascular health risks associated with early-term births
are increasingly reported but remain poorly understood:
associations with poorer life course cardiorespiratory fitness
may explain, at least in part, these risks.
• The present findings may, therefore, have important public
health and clinical implications by helping to inform policies
to deter current trends towards avoidable deliveries at lower
gestational ages and thereby prevent poor cardiopulmonary
fitness levels and related cardiovascular sequelae in new
generations.

 University of Belfast, and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants, and their parents or guardians
during YH1 to YH2.
Sample Selection for the Present Study
At the start of the study (YH1), birth data from 935
participants were obtained from the Department of Health
and Social Services (Northern Ireland), where the paper
records collected since 1971 by the Child Health Services on
all births to mothers normally resident in Northern Ireland
were digitalized and managed. From these 935 participants,
we excluded those with missing data on gestational age,
mode of delivery, SES, breastfeeding duration, maternal age,
maternal body mass index (BMI; in kilograms per meter
squared), or maternal smoking habits (n=102). Participants
were further excluded if they had an implausible combination
of birth weight and gestational age (n=3), were born preterm
(ie, <37 weeks of gestation, n=34), or missed CRF (n=3) or
anthropometric (n=2) measurements at all ages. The present
study thus includes 791 (410 aged 12 years and 381 aged 15
years) of the original 1015 Northern Ireland Young Hearts
Project participants examined at YH1. These participants were
all singletons born at term who had complete data on
perinatal and maternal factors of interest and had at least 1
CRF and anthropometric assessment throughout the follow-up
period, contributing a total of 1508 observations across the 3
assessment waves. The exact numbers of these participants
contributing data at each age period are shown in Figure 1B.
Gestational Age
Gestational age, to the nearest completed week from the first
day of the last menstrual period, was retrieved from the Child
Health Services records and used to group the study
participants
into
3
categories,
according
to
current
definitions36: early term (ET; 37–38 weeks), full term (FT;
39–40 weeks), and late term (LT; 41–42 weeks).
Other Perinatal Variables and Maternal
Characteristics (Potential Confounders)
Maternal age (in years, calculated from birth date), mode of
delivery (vaginal normal, vaginal instrumental
[including
forceps and vacuum], and cesarean), occupation of the main
breadwinner in the children’s family (used as indicator of SES),
and birth weight (in grams) were also retrieved from the Child
Health Services records.32 The occupations were recorded in
6 categories, according to the standard occupational classi-
fication of the Office and Population Censuses and Survey
Statistics (ie, professionals, managerial and technical occu-
pations,
skilled
nonmanual
occupations,
skilled
manual
occupations, partly skilled occupations, and unskilled occu-
pations), and these were dichotomized as nonmanual (first 3)
and manual (last 3).37 Birth weights were standardized for sex
and gestational age by calculation of Z scores with the use of
the UK1990 growth references provided by the British Child
Growth
Foundation.38

duration
(never,
≤3 months, and >3 months) and maternal height, weight
(used to calculated maternal BMI), and smoking history
(never, sporadic, and regular) were obtained from the parental
questionnaire at the start of the study (YH1).34
Cardiorespiratory Fitness
When participants were aged 12 and 15 years (YH1 and YH2,
respectively), CRF was determined by the 20-m multistage
shuttle run test,31,32 a validated field test commonly used in
epidemiological studies in children and adolescents world-
wide.39,40 In brief, the test required subjects to run back and
forth between 2 lines set 20 m apart up to their volitional
limit. Running pace was determined by audio signals, emitted
from a prerecorded cassette tape, with the initial velocity
being 8.5 km/h and increasing by 0.5 km/h every minute. A
constant level of encouragement was given to the participants
throughout the test, which was terminated when the subject
failed to reach the end lines, concurrent with the audio
signals, on 2 consecutive occasions. Scoring was first done by
number of laps completed.32 These were converted to speed
(in km/h) attained at the last completed stage of the test,
following an algorithm that ensures comparability between
20-m multistage shuttle run test protocols,39,40 which was
then used to estimate maximal oxygen uptake level (VO2max;
in mL/kg per minute) according to the equations proposed by
Leger et al.41
In young adulthood (YH3), CRF was measured using the
physical work capacity at a heart rate (HR) of 170 beats per
minute (PWC170) cycle-ergometer test.33,42 In brief, subjects
were required to pedal at a steady pace (50–70 revolutions/
min) for the duration of the test, which lasted �15 minutes.
The workload was increased after each 3-minute period until
an HR of 170 beats per minute was achieved (assessed with a
Polar Vantage HR monitor). Oxygen uptake was monitored
throughout the test using an online respiratory gas analyzer
(Quinton metabolic cart), and VO2max was predicted by
extrapolation of VO2 at an HR of 170 beats per minute to the
age-adjusted estimated maximal HR.33,42
Participants’ levels of CRF were also categorized into poor
versus normal, according to established age- and sex-specific
criterion-reference standards for VO2max linked to poor
cardiometabolic health (specifically, <41.8 mL/kg per minute
[boys] and <34.6 mL/kg per minute [girls] during childhood/
adolescence16 and <33 mL/kg per minute [men] and <24
mL/kg per minute [women] during young adulthood).43

 Because VO2max is a physiological variable known to vary
with body mass, expressing it in ratio with body mass does
not account for the disproportionate increases in fat mass
(FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) with chronological age (and
between sexes), leading to an artificial decrease in VO2max
values during growth. Therefore, we have also estimated
VO2max (in mL/min) per FFM and using theoretical (ie, in mL/
min per kg0.67) and empirical (ie, based on the longitudinal
data of the present study population, in mL/min per kg0.79)
scaling factors for body mass derived from proportional
allometric models.44,45
Potential Mediators (Time-Varying Covariates)
Maturity stage
Children and adolescents’ maturity stage was assessed
visually, by an experienced physician attached to the project,
using Tanner stages for pubic hair development (set to stage
V in all participants during young adulthood).30–32,34 Accord-
ingly, participants were categorized as prepubescent (stage I),
pubescent (stages II–III), or post-pubescent (stages IV–V).
Anthropometry
Throughout the longitudinal period, body weight was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale, and
standing height was measured to the nearest mm using a
Harpenden portable stadiometer, while participants wore light
indoor clothing and no shoes.30,31,34 BMI was calculated from
these measures, and participants’ weight status (underweight,
normal, overweight, and obesity) was categorized according
to BMI reference Z scores (during childhood/adolescence)46
or according to the following cutoff values (young adulthood):
<18.5, 18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2. Skinfold
thicknesses (in mm) were measured with calipers at 4 body
sites (triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac). The sum of
these 4 skinfolds was used as a measure of total body
adiposity31,34 and to estimate percentage body fat,47 from
which we derived FM as weight9%body fat and FFM as
weight�FM (in kg).
Statistical Analyses
All data were analyzed with the use of the STATA version 14
software package. We used linear generalized estimating
equations (GEEs) with an exchangeable correlation structure
to analyze CRF (as a continuous variable) through adoles-
cence to adulthood in relation to gestational age. GEE
analyses
account
for
the
correlation
of
repeated
and
unequally numbered measures (ie, missing data) obtained
over time in the same individuals. Gestational age was
included in the GEE models as a continuous (in weeks) or
categorical (treated as dummy with ET as referent group)
variable. CRF was analyzed primarily in mL/min per kg but
also relative to other expressions of body mass to allow
appreciation of their impact (if any) and comparisons with
other studies. We have also fitted GEE models to estimate the
incidence risk ratio (RR; ie, the probability of having poor
levels
of
CRF)
associated
with
a
1-week
increase
in
gestational age or between FT or LT and ET groups. In these
models, the Poisson distribution was assumed with a log link
and robust error variance estimation.48 Tests for linear trends
of (poor) CRF across categories of gestational age were
conducted by using the mean values of gestational age for all
the individuals included in each category as a continuous
variable in the GEE models.
All analyses were first adjusted for participants’ age at the
time of the CRF assessment, sex, the product between
participants’ age and sex, birth weight Z scores, and cohort
(model 1), and further for other perinatal (SES, mode of
delivery, and breastfeeding duration) and maternal (age at
child’s birth, BMI, and smoking history) factors, as potential
confounders (model 2). Participant’s age at the time of the CRF
assessment was treated as a categorical variable to model the
nonlinear change of CRF over time. The product term between
participants’ age and sex was included in all models to
accommodate the lower values of CRF in females than males
across all ages as well as their different trajectories. Product
terms between gestational age (in weeks or categories) and
sex or cohort were also added to model 2 to examine whether
the association between gestational age and CRF differed
between the sexes or cohorts, but none were significant
(P>0.202 for all these interaction terms). Therefore, all
gestational age–CRF association estimates reported herein
combine the data from males and females and participants
from both the 12- and the 15-year-old cohorts. To examine
whether the associations between gestational age and CRF
were stable over the age periods covered by this study,
interaction terms between gestational age and participants’
age at follow-up were also added to the models. The results of
these analyses were used to illustrate the CRF trajectories
from late childhood to young adulthood between different
gestational age groups. Finally, to investigate the extent to
which any associations between gestational age and (poor)
CRF could be mediated by associations between gestational
age and growth, maturation, and/or adiposity gain over the
course of follow-up, we added height, maturity level, and the
sum of 4 skinfolds to model 2 described above (model 3).
Results
Perinatal and maternal characteristics of the participants
included in the present study are shown in Table 1. Most
participants were born FT (67.3%) or LT (18.7%), and 13.9%

 were born ET. Levels of CRF, body size, and adiposity during
late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood are shown
in Table 2. Overall, when expressed in mL/min per kg or mL/
min per kgFFM, CRF decreased slightly between childhood and
adolescence but more sharply between adolescence and
young adulthood. When expressed after allometric scaling,
CRF increased slightly between childhood and adolescence,
followed by a sharp decline thereafter. However, these
trajectories and the mean CRF values at each age period
differed by sex (Figure S1).
Gestational Age and CRF
Gestational age was significantly associated with CRF through
adolescence to young adulthood, such that for each week
increase in participants’ gestational age, their CRF was
0.46 mL/min per kg (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14–
0.79) higher (model 1, Table 3). After adjustments for other
perinatal and maternal factors, this association did not change:
0.46 mL/min per kg (95% CI, 0.14–0.78) (model 2, Table 3).
When examined according to categories of gestational age, and
after adjustments for all the potential confounders considered,
individuals who were born FT or LT had increasingly higher
levels of CFR than individuals who were born ET: 0.86 mL/min
per kg (95% CI, �0.11 to 1.83) and 1.59 mL/min per kg (95%
CI, 0.40–2.77), respectively (P=0.009 for linear trend, model 2,
Table 3). Further adjustments for growth, maturation, and
adiposity, as potential mediators, did not appreciably change
our findings (model 3). A similar pattern of associations was
observed when CRF was expressed in mL/min per kgFFM, mL/
min per kg0.67, or mL/min per kg0.79 (Table 3), illustrating the
lack of an association between gestational age and partici-
pants’ body weight or FFM throughout the follow-up (ß=�0.3
[95% CI, �0.9 to 0.4] kg and ß=�0.2 [95% CI, �0.5 to 0.3] kg,
respectively, per week increase in gestational age).
Gestational Age and Incidence of Poor CRF
After adjustments for all confounders, each week increase in
participants’ gestational age was associated with a 14%

 relative risk reduction of poor CRF (model 2, Table 4).
Notably, when comparing individuals according to categories
of gestational age, those who were born FT or LT had similar
lower risk estimates for poor CRF than those who were born
ET: RR, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.47–0.89) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.40–
0.90), respectively. Conversely, compared with individuals
born FT or LT (combined), individuals who were born ET had a
57% higher risk of poor CRF throughout adolescence to
adulthood (RR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.14–2.16]).
Gestational Age and (Poor) CRF Trajectories
There were no significant interactions between gestational
age (in weeks or categories) and participants’ age at the time
of CRF assessment (P>0.322 for all), indicating that the
changes in CRF over time were similar across the different
gestational ages, with those born ET displaying consistently
lower levels of CRF (Figure 2A, when expressed in mL/kg per
minute; Figure S2, when expressed in other units) or greater
incidence of poor CRF (in percentage, Figure 2B) through
adolescence to young adulthood.
Additional Analyses
To extract the public health impact of our estimates, we have
also calculated the attributable fractions, and respective 95%
CIs, among the participants exposed (AFe) and the overall
study population (AFp) (Figure 3), according to the method
recommended
by
Greenland
and
Drescher
for
cohort
studies49 and implemented in STATA with the command
punaf.50 Specifically, the AFe, indicating the fraction of poor
CRF risk in the exposed population (ET) that would be
eliminated if these people were to be shifted to the unexposed
group (ie, FT or LT, combined) was 36.3% (95% CI, 12.5%–
53.7%). The AFp, indicating how much of the poor CRF burden
in the overall study population could be eliminated if ET births

Discussion
Health risks associated with ET birth are increasingly reported
but remain poorly understood. The present study, showing
lower levels of CRF through adolescence into young adulthood
in individuals who were born ET versus FT or LT, adds
important information to this emerging field. Indeed, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has
examined variations in the levels of CRF across different
gestational lengths within the at-term range; it is also the first
to have characterized these across different critical age
periods in the life course.
Explanations for the protective and lifelong effects that
longer gestational age seems to have on CRF align with the
hypothesis that exposure of babies to the postnatal environ-
ment while still developmentally plastic may increase sus-
ceptibility
to

impairments.51
Earlier
births
may
interrupt normal development and lead to permanent changes
of tissues and organs, such as fewer alveoli, lower capillary
density, and a smaller vascular tree, which, in turn, may lead
to long-lasting impairments in maximal oxygen uptake and
transport, muscular power, and motor coordination. Albeit
confined to comparisons between individuals born extremely
or very preterm versus at term (while considering the latter as

 a homogeneous group), previous studies have suggested that
mild airway obstruction, gas trapping, and deficits in motor
coordination may explain, at least in part, the lower CRF levels
observed among those born prematurely.21–23 Differences in
the postnatal experiences of children born preterm have also
been advanced as a potential explanation. These may include
nutritional supplementation and
parental
restrictions
of
offspring participation in physical activity because of percep-
tions of frailty. Accordingly, some studies have shown that
individuals who were born (very) prematurely not only had a
lower CRF but also reported lower participation in physical
activities.20,26 However, no such differences were observed
when physical activity levels were measured objectively,
despite significant differences in CRF.24 We deem the
postnatal experience explanation less likely in the context
of CRF differences between individuals who were all born at
term. Possibly, genetic factors related to both gestational age
and CRF may explain a significant portion of the associations
observed in our study, although this needs to be further
investigated. The fact that the associations remained stable
across all ages, and that adjustments for growth, maturation,
and adiposity, as potential mediators, did not appreciably
change their strength, seems to lend some support to this
hypothesis.
The importance of our findings is supported by the strong
links between CRF and other cardiometabolic risk factors in
youth and later in life, pathways that are likely to explain the
beneficial effects of CRF on cardiovascular disease and
mortality.15 Indeed, each 1 metabolic equivalent task (ie,
3.5 mL/kg per minute) lower level in CRF during young
adulthood was associated with �13%, 8%, and 11% higher risk
of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic
syndrome in middle age, respectively.52 A recent prospective
study reported an 18% reduced risk of myocardial infarction
per 1-SD higher levels of CRF during adolescence.53 A meta-
analysis of prospective studies in mostly middle-aged healthy
men and women showed that a 1 metabolic equivalent task
higher level in CRF was associated with 15% and 13%
reductions in coronary heart disease/cardiovascular disease
events and all-cause mortality, respectively.54 By extrapola-
tion, the extent to which our findings, showing a 0.46 mL/kg
per minute difference per week increase in gestational age or
a 1.59 mL/kg per minute difference between individuals born
ET and LT (model 2, Table 3), translate to clinically relevant
outcomes later in life remains disputable. By examining the
associations between gestational age and the incidence of
poor CRF defined by cut point levels that should raise red
flags about the participants’ cardiometabolic health status,16
we estimated a 14% relative risk reduction per week increase
in gestational age within the at-term range and a 57% relative
risk increase between individuals who were born ET versus FT
or LT (combined). However, exposures with low prevalence
may have limited relevance for population health, even when
they are strongly associated with the outcome of interest.
Therefore, we have also translated our findings in terms of
their relevance to public health by calculating AFs. These were
36.3% among the individuals born ET and 6.9% for the whole
study population. Although statistically significant, the mean-
ing of these figures may be better understood when compared
with scenarios in which AFs are commonly estimated to
inform public health policies. For instance, in a recent
population-based study from the United Kingdom, the AFs
for having at least 3 hospital admissions between the ages of
9 months and 5 years and for limiting long-standing illness at
5 years were 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, in children born ET
versus FT.11 In addition, although only 13.9% of the population
included in our study were born ET (in 1974–1975 or 1977–
1978), more recent birth data from Northern Ireland put this

 figure at a higher level (�20% of all singletons born at term in
2014).55 The AFs reported in our study are, thus, likely
underestimates of the current impact of ET on poor CRF. Still,
apart from their magnitude, AFs only have translational value
when the exposure of interest is causally related to the
outcome and when the exposure is amenable to intervention.
Causality of the gestational age–CRF association cannot be
proved by means of randomized controlled trials and must,
thus, be inferred on the basis of observational data. We
confirmed essential criteria for an association to be deemed
causal, such as plausibility, temporality, dose-gradient, con-
sistency, and coherency. Still, it remains that genetic factors
can underlie both lower gestational age and poorer CRF and,
therefore, their association may not be not causal. Further-
more, not all births occurring ET can or should be prevented
(eg, if they are medically indicated or occur spontaneously).
However, recent trend analyses have attributed the increases
in ET births to increases in the rates of planned cesareans,
and these do form an important potential modifiable portion.3
Our study has several limitations that need to be
acknowledged. Gestational age was estimated according to
the last menstrual period day method (the standard in the
1970s), which may have introduced measurement errors.
However, there are no reasons to expect these should have
differed by the participants’ CRF levels and, thus, any error
introduced was likely nondifferential. In the same line,
accurate CRF estimation requires maximal exercise testing
with direct measures of oxygen uptake. Although no such
direct measures were obtained, the methods used in the
Northern Ireland Young Hearts Project have been validated,

mented in STATA with the command punaf) and could be also
approximated by the following equations: AFe=(RR�1)/RR and
AFp=[(RR�1)/RR]9Pe, commonly used in cohort studies, where
RR is the multivariable adjusted risk ratio of poor CRF for ET vs
FT�LT (ie, 1.57) and Pe is the proportion of individuals with poor
CRF who were born ET (or case fraction).

 also against each other,56 and are commonly used to
characterize CRF and related health outcomes in large
population-based cohort studies. Switching to a new assess-
ment method during young adulthood may have affected the
shape of the CRF trajectory in the whole study population,
most likely resulting in a less steep decline between
adolescence and young adulthood than one would have
observed had the 20-m multistage shuttle run test been used
at YH3. However, this does not affect the differences in CRF
between gestational age groups at each period.
The study experienced considerable attrition of partici-
pants between adolescence and young adulthood. However,
this raised little concern about the validity of the estimates
reported because analyses of predictors of dropout showed
that neither gestational age nor the baseline levels of CRF
differed between those who remained in the study up to
young
adulthood
and
those
who
dropped
out
earlier
(Table S1). Some of the covariates did differ (ie, SES, delivery
mode, and adiposity), such that the group attending and
providing data during young adulthood tended to have a
healthier profile. If anything, these led to an underestimation
of the estimates reported in our study. Indeed, sensitivity
analyses excluding the young adulthood data from the
analyses
resulted
in
somewhat
stronger
associations
(0.51 [0.21–0.81] mL/min per kg per week increase in
gestational age and RR of 1.69 [1.14–2.51] for incidence of
poor CRF in ET versus FT or LT [combined]). Data on the
indication for cesarean deliveries (or labor inductions) were
not available in the present study. It is, thus, possible that
significant obstetric reasons may have led to cesarean
deliveries (or labor inductions) before FT, and the poorer
CRF observed in the ET group could, to some extent, reflect
intrauterine compromise rather than prematurity itself.11
Indeed, cesarean deliveries occurred more often at shorter
gestational ages (Table 1), but exclusion of cesarean deliver-
ies (n=36) from the analyses did not materially affect our
estimates (0.44 [0.11–0.76] mL/kg per minute per week
increase in gestational age and RR of 1.53 [1.09–2.13] for
incidence of poor CRF between ET and FT or LT [combined]).
Although we have adjusted our association estimates for a
comprehensive set of potential confounders, some residual
confounding can still affect them. Indeed, both maternal BMI
and smoking history were obtained at the start of the study,
when participants were aged 12 to 15 years, and do not
directly reflect exposures to these maternal factors during or
before pregnancy. Finally, our study was conducted in a
cohort of white individuals, born in the 1970s in Northern
Ireland, a region characterized by a high prevalence and
incidence of cardiovascular disease in Europe. Caution may,
thus, be warranted when extrapolating our findings to other
regions/countries, ethnicities, and/or younger birth cohorts.
Investigation of how current rates of ET affect offspring’s CRF
in younger cohorts and how these associations may be
modified by recent improvement in breastfeeding rates (or
deterioration in other postnatal feeding practices) may
constitute an important future research agenda.
Conclusions
Among singletons who were born at term, increased gesta-
tional age is associated with higher levels of CRF through
adolescence to young adulthood. From a public health
perspective, these findings may have important implications
and could help shape policies to deter current trends towards
avoidable deliveries at lower gestational ages.
