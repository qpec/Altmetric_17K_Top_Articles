Purpose: To describe time trends and current patterns in sexual practices with opposite-sex
partners among men and women aged 16e24 years in Britain.
Methods: Complex survey analyses of cross-sectional probability survey data from three British
National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), conducted approximately decennially
1990e2012, involving interviews with 45,199 people in total.
Results: Birth cohort analysis showed a decline in the median age at first sexual experience and
first intercourse since the midtwentieth century and a narrowing of the interval between these
events. Comparison of data from Natsals 1, 2, and 3 showed increases in the prevalence of ever
experience of oral and anal sex among 16- to 24-year-olds, which were more marked among older
respondents in this age group between Natsals 1 and 2, and among younger respondents between
Natsals 2 and 3. Among the sexually active, vaginal and oral sex remained the most common
combination of practices reported in the past year. The proportion reporting a past-year repertoire
of vaginal, oral, and anal sex rose from approximately one in 10 in 1990e1991 to approximately
one in four men and one in five women in 2010e2012. In the latest survey, heterosexual experi-
ence of practices was positively associated with bisexual attraction among women.
Conclusions: Recent decades have seen an earlier age at initiation of partnered sexual experiences
and increased diversity in heterosexual practices among young people. Keeping pace with trends
in sexual practices is necessary to safeguard young people’s health and to support them in
increasing their sexual well-being.

A large body of empirical work has documented marked
changes in the sexual behavior of young people over recent de-
cades. Much of this research has focused on vaginal intercourse
between men and women, especially the timing and circum-
stances surrounding its first occurrence. In Britain, for instance,
studies have described a decline over time in median age at first

 intercourse, a narrowing of the gap between men and women in
terms of timing, and increasing use of condoms at first sex [1e3].
Less empirical attention has been paid to sexual practices
other than vaginal intercourse, despite evidence of upward
trends in oral and anal sex among young people in several
countries [4e9]. Recently, however, researchers in the United
States have used nationally representative data to gain a fuller
picture of patterns of emerging heterosexual behavior among
young people, and how they vary by sociodemographic charac-
teristics. For instance, analyses of data from wave IV respondents
to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health) reveal striking gender differences in the order in which
different practices are initiated, with women more likely than
men to initiate vaginal intercourse before other practices and less
likely to experience a second new behavior within the same year
[10]. Other analyses of this data have also shown the co-
occurrence of different practices within adolescents’ repertoires
of experience to vary by gender. While vaginal and oral-genital
contact was the most common combination of sexual practices
experienced by age 18 years for both men and women, the next
most common combination for men was oral, vaginal, and anal
sex, whereas for women it was vaginal intercourse only [11].
Despite the value of gaining a more comprehensive under-
standing of patterns of sexual behavior among young people, in
Britain, analyses of data from population surveys have rarely
examined aspects other than the prevalence of discrete sexual
practices. Little is known about the average age of first sexual
experience relative to first intercourse, nor the combinations of
practices that co-occur within repertoires of experience, nor how
such patterns are shifting over time.
Documenting changing patterns of emerging sexual behavior
is important for several reasons. First and foremost, description
of a range of sexual practices and the relationships between them
aligns with calls for research that conceptualizes the initiation of
sexual activity as a normative developmental process, rather
than the conventional framing as “problematic [10,12].” In
addition, basic description of behavioral trends also provides
important empirical context for examining associations between
patterns of emerging sexual behavior and aspects of sexual
health and well-being among young people. Such associations
have not yet, to our knowledge, been explored within British
studies, though research from other high-income countries
has found associations between certain patterns of initiation
(characterized by factors such as the relative timing, spacing, and
sequencing of different sexual activities) and measures of sexual
risk behavior and unintended outcomes, including sexually
transmitted infection diagnosis, concurrent partnerships, and,
among women, unprotected anal intercourse with their most
recent partner [13,14]. Beyond dimensions of sexual risk, how-
ever, little is known about whether or how patterns of emerging
behavior are associated with aspects of sexual experience that
foster sexual health and well-being. Research indicates reper-
toires of practice within a specific encounter can have implica-
tions for the quality of a sexual interaction; among women, for
instance, receiving manual and/or oral stimulation has been
associated with a greater likelihood of achieving orgasm [15,16].
Thus, documentation of a wider range of practices may also lay
the empirical foundation for examination of factors associated
with sexual pleasure, satisfaction and well-being among young
people. Gaining a more complete picture of sexual practices
among young people is important, too, for informing efforts to
improve sexual health. Population surveys in the United States
[17], for example, have shown oral and anal sex with an opposite-
sex partner is more commonly reported by women reporting
bisexual attraction than those reporting heterosexual attraction
only, which prompts the need for more nuanced targeting.
In this article, we report analyses of data from three British
National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal),
conducted approximately decennially between 1990 and 2010,
with the aim of examining heterosexual experience of practices
among young men and women aged 16e24 years. We restricted
the analysis to examine practices between men and women only
since the number reporting same-sex experience did not allow
for detailed analysis. We use data from Natsals 1e3 to examine
trends in young people’s heterosexual practices in recent de-
cades, including (1) relative timing of first sexual experience and
first intercourse; (2) changes in the prevalence of ever experi-
ence of different sexual practices; and (3) changes in the com-
binations of sexual practices engaged in by young people. In
addition, we use data from the most recent survey (Natsal-3), to
describe patterns of heterosexual behavior among young people,
including (4) recency with which different sexual practices
feature in their sexual repertoires; and (5) variation in experi-
ence of heterosexual practices by reported sexual identity and
sexual attraction.
Methods
Data and sample
Natsalsurveyswerecarriedoutin1990e1991(Natsal-1),1999e
2001 (Natsal-2), and 2010e2012 (Natsal-3). In all three surveys,
stratified random probability sampling was used to select house-
holds, from which one eligible individual, resident in Britain, was
selectedatrandomandinvitedtoparticipate.Similar measuresand
procedures were used for all three surveys. In Natsal-1, pen-and-
paper was used for both the face-to-face and self-completion in-
terviews, with a self-completion booklet for more sensitive ques-
tions. In Natsals 2 and 3, participants were interviewed using
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) with computer-
assisted self-interview (CASI) for the more sensitive questions.
Full details of the methodology are published elsewhere [18e20].
Natsal-3 was granted ethical approval by the Oxfordshire Research
Ethics Committee A (reference: 09/H0604/27).
In Natsal-1, 18,876 men and women aged 16e59 years were
interviewed (1,489 men and 1,888 women aged 16e24 years); the
respective figures for Natsal-2 were 11,161 men and women aged
16e44 years (1,231 men and 1,442 women aged 16e24 years) and
for Natsal-315,162 men and women aged 16e74 years (1,729 men
and 2,140 women aged 16e24 years). The overall response rate
was 66.8% for Natsal-1, 65.4% for Natsal-2, and 57.7% for Natsal-3
(64.8% among Natsal-3 participants aged 16e34 years).
Measures
Sexual practices with an opposite-sex partner. Variables relating
to first sexual experience and first intercourse with an opposite-
sex partner were derived from answers to questions asked in the
face-to-face (CAPI) section of the questionnaire. All participants
were given a show card asking: “How old were you when you
first had sexual intercourse with someone of the opposite sex, or
hasn’t this happened?” and “How old were you when you first
had any type of experience of a sexual kinddfor example kissing,
petting, or feeling one anotherdwith someone of the opposite

695
 sex (or hasn’t this happened either)?” and were asked to give
their age at these events, or to say that it had not happened.
Those reporting intercourse having occurred before age 13 years
were then asked “Has this happened with anyone else since you
turned 13?” Intercourse was not defined in the CAPI section of
the questionnaire.
Variables relating to other sexual practices were derived from
answers to questions asking about the most recent experience of
specific sexual acts with an opposite-sex partner, that is, vaginal
intercourse, giving oral sex to a partner, receiving oral sex from a
partner, anal intercourse, and genital contact not leading to inter-
course (vaginal, oral, or anal). These questions were asked in the
self-completion section of the survey (CASI) of participants who
reported any sexual experience (and those who declined to answer
the question about sexual experience). Response options were: in
the last 7 days; between 7 days and 4 weeks ago; between 4 weeks
and 6 months ago; between 6 months and 1 year ago; between
1 year and 5 years ago; longer than 5 years ago; never.
Sexual
attraction
and
identity. Variables
relating
to sexual
attraction and identity were derived from questions asked in the
CAPI section of the questionnaire, following the questions on first
intercourse and first sexual experience. For sexual attraction,
participants were handed a show card with the statement “I have
felt attracted.” and asked to give the letter corresponding to
their choice of response option from a list comprising: only to
females, never to males; more often to females, and at least once
to a male; about equally often to females and to males; more
often to males, and at least once to a female; only ever to males,
never to females; I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at
all (response options for men given as an example).
The question on sexual identity was asked face-to-face after
the CASI section of the questionnaire (only in Natsal-3), when
participants were handed a show card with the question ‘Which
of the options on this card best describes how you think of
yourself?’ and asked to give the letter corresponding to their
answer from response
options:
heterosexual/straight; gay/
lesbian; bisexual; other.
Statistical analysis
We performed all analyses using the survey commands in
Stata (v13.1), which account for the weighting, clustering, and
stratification of the data. We carried out survival analysis of data
from participants aged 16e74 years in the most recent survey
(Natsal-3) to describe trends in median age at first sexual expe-
rience, and in first intercourse, with an opposite-sex partner by
successive 5-year birth cohorts, plotting the lines representing
these trends on the same graph to show changes in the interval
between them. Using data from all three Natsals, we estimated
the proportion of young people reporting ever experience of each
sexual practice with an opposite-sex partner in each of 3-year
age groups (16e18, 19e21, and 22e24 years), and we present
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals to show changes
between surveys, using Natsal-2 as the baseline. To examine how
the repertoire of practices experienced in the past year has
changed over the three surveys, we used proportional Venn di-
agrams to show the proportions of young people aged 16e24
years reporting different combinations of practices (vaginal in-
tercourse, any type of oral sex, and/or anal sex) in the past year,
among those reporting at least one of these practices in the same
time period.
To describe current patterns of sexual practices we used data
from Natsal-3 to estimate the proportion of young men and
women who reported each practice in different time periods
(past year, past month, and past week), as a proportion of those
reporting ever experience of that practice. Finally, using data
from Natsal-3, we estimated the prevalence of ever experience of
specific practices with an opposite-sex partner by sexual
attraction and identity among 16- to 24-year-olds. Owing to
small numbers, we excluded individuals who reported no sexual
attraction (17 men and 30 women) and those who reported be-
ing attracted only to people of the same sex (15 men and 12
women). Ranges for missing data for the five sexual practices
examined are as follows: 2%e6% in Natsal-1, 2%e5% in Natsal-2,
and <3% in Natsal-3. Missing data for variables on sexual identity
and attraction in Natsal-3 were <.5%.
Results
Trends in the timing of first heterosexual experience and first
intercourse
Figure 1 shows trends in median age at first sexual experience
with an opposite-sex partner plotted alongside trends in median
age at first intercourse, by successive birth cohorts within
Natsal-3. For both men and women, median age at first hetero-
sexual experience has declined since the midtwentieth century,

 from 16 among participants in the earliest birth cohort (born
1935e1939) to 14 in the most recent birth cohort (born 1990e
1996). Median age at first intercourse has declined from 20 for
women and 19 for men, born in the late 1930s to 16 for both men
and women born in the early 1990s. Among both men and
women, the interval between median age at first sexual experi-
ence and first intercourse has narrowed over time, from 4 years
among women and 3 years among men born in the late 1930s to
2 years for those born in 1990e1996.

compares
the
prevalence
of
sexual
practices
among participants in different age ranges within the sample
aged 16e24 years between Natsals 1, 2,a and 3.
Unsurprisingly, the prevalence of ever experience of the
sexual practices increased with age in all three surveys. Looking
at the pattern in the latest survey (Natsal-3), for example, the
practice most commonly reported by the youngest participants
(aged 16e18 years) was genital contact not leading to intercourse
(76.4% men and 78.7% women). Three out of five of those aged
16e18 years had had vaginal intercourse, and over half reported
experience of each type of oral-genital contact. A slightly smaller
proportion of men than women in this age group reported
experience of anal intercourse (14.3% of men and 16.2% of
women). By age 22e24 years, approximately nine out of 10 re-
ported experience of vaginal intercourse (90.2% men and 89.3%
women), and over four out of five reported experience of oral-
penis contact (86.1% men and 84.1% women), oral-vulva con-
tact (84.6% men and 82.7% women), and genital contact (87.9%
men and 84.1% women). Over a third of those aged 22e24 years
reported experience of anal intercourse (39.4% men and 34.2%
women).
Between Natsals 1 and 2, reporting of sexual practices
increased for both men and women in all three age groups.
Changes seen between Natsals 2 and 3, however, were less
consistent, especially among young women. Comparing Natsal-3
with Natsal-2, we observe the most marked increases in the
youngest men and women (16e18 years), including increased
reporting of oral-penis contact (ORs: 1.45 men, 1.34 women) and
anal intercourse (ORs: 1.89 men, 2.52 women). Conversely, among
women in the two older age groups (19e21 and 22e24 years), we
observe significant decreases in reporting of all practices between
Natsals 2 and 3, with the exception of anal sex. Among men aged
19e21 years, the proportion reporting vaginal intercourse also
decreased between Natsals 2 and 3 (OR: .57). The most marked
change between Natsals 2 and 3 was the significant increase in
anal sex among both men and women across all age groups. Over
the time span of the three surveys, the proportion of women aged
22e24 years reporting having ever experienced anal sex more
than doubled, from 16.5% to 34.2%, and among men of the same
age showed an almost threefold increase, from 13.5% to 39.4%.

Figure 2 represents changes in the combinations of sexual
practices reported by those aged 16e24 years in each Natsal
survey, among those reporting experience of at least one of the
practices (vaginal intercourse, oral sex (oral-penis and/or oral-
vulva), and anal intercourse), in the past year. Across all three
surveys, vaginal intercourse and oral sex was the most common
combination of practices experienced in the past year, being
consistently reported by more than two thirds of men and
women, though the proportion declined between Natsals 2 and 3
from 72.8% to 68.0% among men (p ¼ .041) and 73.7%e68.5%
among women (p ¼ .007). However, the proportion of sexually

 active 16- to 24-year-olds who had experienced oral, vaginal, and
anal sex in the past year increased with each survey, from 10.5%
of men and 9.9% of women in Natsal-1, to 24.0% of men and 21.8%
of women (p < .0001 in both cases) in Natsal-3, making this the
second most common combination of practices among both men
and women in Natsals 2 and 3. Between Natsal-1 and Natsal-3,
there has been a concomitant decrease in the proportion who
have only experienced vaginal intercourse and no other practices
in the past year, from 13.9% to 6.0% among men and from 16.7% to
7.8% among women (p < .0001 in both cases). The proportion of
men and women reporting repertoires of only vaginal and anal
intercourse, or only oral sex and anal intercourse, in the past year
was negligible (<1%) across all three surveys.
Recency of sexual practices with an opposite-sex partner
Figure 3 presents data on the recency of the occurrence of
specific practices among 16- to 24-year-olds reporting ever
experience of each practice. Vaginal intercourse, oral sex, and
genital contact were all experienced within the last year by more
than nine out of 10 men and women with ever experience of each
practice and anal intercourse by three out of five (63.3% men and
59.5% women). More recent experience was somewhat lower in
frequency. In the case of vaginal intercourse, the proportion of
ever-experienced women reporting occurrence in the last month
fell to three quarters, and in the last week to just over half, and
the respective proportions among men were slightly lower.
Compared with vaginal intercourse, the equivalent prevalences
for oral sex and genital contact in the more recent time periods
were slightly lower. Recent experience of anal sex was appre-
ciably less common than other practices. Among participants
with ever experience, the prevalence of occurrence fell to 17% in
the past month and 6% in the past week.
Heterosexual experience by sexual attraction and sexual identity
Table 2 presents prevalence of ever experience of sexual
practices with an opposite-sex partner by self-reported sexual
attraction and sexual identity, among men and women aged 16e
24 years in Natsal-3. Among women, there was a clear associa-
tion between reported sexual attraction and heterosexual
experience of practices, with experience of each practice being

 more common among women who reported attraction to both
men and women than among those who reported attraction only
to men. Conversely, men who reported attraction only to women
were more likely to have experienced each of the sexual practices
with a woman than men who reported bisexual attraction
(though the corresponding numbers are small and of borderline
statistical significance).
With regards to sexual identity (as opposed to sexual attraction),
a larger discrepancy is seen between men who identify as hetero-
sexual and those who report a sexual identity other than hetero-
sexual, with much lower odds of experiencing practices with an
opposite-sex partner among the latter group (OR for vaginal inter-
course: .20; 95% confidence interval: .11e.36). Among women, there
were no significant associations between reported sexual identity
and heterosexual experience of sexual practices.
Discussion
These data from three decennial national probability surveys
of more than 45,000 people document marked changes in het-
erosexual practices among young men and women in Britain.
Birth cohort analyses of Natsal-3 data show a decline in median
age at first sexual experience and first intercourse over the past
half century and a narrowing of the interval between the two
events, both of which trends are more marked among women
than men. These trends likely reflect the relaxation of social at-
titudes regarding premarital sexual activity, in combination with
young people’s greater access to reliable contraception.
Comparison of data from Natsals 1, 2, and 3 reveals a
widening of the range of sexual practices engaged in by 16- to
24-year-olds. The increasing prevalence of oral and anal sex was
more noticeable among participants aged 19e24 years between
Natsals 1 and 2 and among those aged 16e18 years between
Natsals 2 and 3, such that trends in sexual practices which were
initially observed among those in their late teens and early 20s
appear to have filtered down the age range over time. Although
ever experience of anal intercourse remains less commonly re-
ported than the other practices measured, nevertheless, between
Natsals 1 and 3 its prevalence among 16- to 24-year-olds almost
tripled among men and more than doubled among women.
These changes have been accompanied by modest declines in the
prevalence of vaginal intercourse and genital contact.
Vaginal intercourse remains a mainstay of the heterosexual
repertoire across all three surveys, having been practiced by all
but a very small proportion (<2.5%) of young people who were
sexually active in the year before interview. For the most part,
then, we are seeing oral and anal sex joining, rather than
replacing,
vaginal
intercourse
in
heterosexual
repertoires.
Moreover, despite the increasing prevalence of anal intercourse,
the low prevalence of reporting recent experience may indicate it
is a less regular feature in young people’s sexual interactions.
Rising trends in oral and anal sex seen in our data have also
been documented in population surveys in other high-income
countries [21,22] and can be interpreted in the context of a
broader shift toward greater diversity in sexual behavior,
including increases in reported numbers of sexual partners, and,
among women, reporting of same-sex experience [1]. Factors
driving the increasing diversity in sexual practices in particular
are likely to be complex, such that single factor explanations
should be treated with caution. For instance, while young peo-
ple’s increased access to pornography is routinely cited in dis-
cussion about increases in anal sex [23], empirical evidence of a
causal relationship between exposure to explicit sexual media
and sexual behavior practices remains equivocal [24e26], and
young people’s own accounts of anal sex reveal a complex socio-
sexual landscape shaping practice, within which pornography is
only one feature [33]. In addition, while there is a sizeable body
of research examining predictors of specific sexual practices at
the individual level [6,27], research is also needed examining
factors operating at the macrolevel of sociocultural norms.
Strengths of this study include the use of nationally repre-
sentative data ensuring generalizability of the findings; a large,
boosted sample of young people enabling estimates of differ-
ences between groups and time periods to be made with confi-
dence; and the inclusion of a variable relating to first sexual
experience, rarely reported in behavioral research and usefully
augmenting data on first intercourse to provide a more nuanced
understanding of emerging sexual behavior.
Our study also has limitations. Despite the large sample size,
the number of participants reporting same-sex experience was
not sufficient to extend the analyses to practices between same-
sex partners. We also rely on self-reports of behavior, which are
likely to be influenced by prevailing social norms. As noted by
others [5], it is difficult to assess the extent to which observed
differences in the prevalence of sexual practices between time
periods reflect real changes in behavior, or result from reporting
biases attendant on shifts in social attitudes toward those prac-
tices. In addition, the scope of our analysis was limited by the fact
that the surveys measured age at first sexual experience and first
intercourse, but not that of other sexual practices, such that the
relative timing and sequence of their initiation cannot be
described. Furthermore, sexual identity and attraction were re-
ported at the time of interview and may be subject to change
over time. Finally, data collection for this study was completed
toward the end of 2012, and further changes in young people’s
sexual practices may have occurred in the intervening period.
Our findings present both possibilities and challenges for public
health policy and practice. The trend toward greater diversification
in sexual behavior seen in this and other studies is further evidence
of the fluidity of sexual behavior and of the human capacity for
change in behavior in response to new influences. This potential for
adaptation can be harnessed in efforts to improve sexual health and
well-being, should modification be needed to adapt to new threats.
At the same time, changing patterns of behavior raise new chal-
lenges for health promotion. Studies have shown, for example,
lower use of condoms and higher user-error rates during anal in-
tercourse between men and women [5,6,28], suggesting the need
for efforts to encourage and advise on correct use. In addition, the
higher prevalence of each sexual practice among women reporting
bisexual attraction compared with women reporting attraction
only to men suggests that efforts to promote sexual health and
well-being of this group needs to take account of the complexities
of interactions between identity, attraction, and behavior [29,30].
Beyond a narrowly framed biomedical “risk perspective [31],”
our findings also warrant attention to their relevance for sexual
well-being among young people, including the quality and dy-
namics of their sexual interactions. In particular, the increasing
diversity of repertoires of sexual practice must be considered in
the context of evidence regarding gender disparities in expec-
tations and experiences of these practices. Analysis of longitu-
dinal data from the U.S. Add Health study has shown that
repeated engagement in disliked sexual activities (mainly oral-
penis contact and anal intercourse) was four times more com-
mon among women than men [32]. Evidence from our own

 qualitative research in England, too, has revealed prominent
cultural discourses among teenagers that normalize painful, and
sometimes coercive, anal intercourse [33], with men tending to
talk more positively about the practice than women. Health care
providers and educators need to understand the impact of
gender dynamics on sexual practices in order to provide cultur-
ally sensitive and appropriate sex education emphasizing the
importance of communication about sexual desires and con-
cerns, and respecting and accepting a partner’s dislike of, and
possibly unwillingness to engage in, certain activities. Young
people may also need guidance on how to communicate their
preferences and dislikes [32]. As noted elsewhere [34], young
people’s sexual behavior is shaped by an ever-increasing number
of influences; thus, keeping pace with trends in sexual practices
is necessary to safeguard their health and to support them in
increasing their sexual well-being.
