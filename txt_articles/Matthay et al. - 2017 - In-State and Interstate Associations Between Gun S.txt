Background: Gun shows are an important source of firearms,
but no adequately powered studies have examined whether
they are associated with increases in firearm injuries.
Objective: To determine whether gun shows are associated
with short-term increases in local firearm injuries and whether
this association differs by the state in which the gun show is held.
Design: Quasi-experimental.
Setting: California.
Participants: Persons in California within driving distance of
gun shows.
Measurements: Gun shows in California and Nevada between
2005 and 2013 (n = 915 shows) and rates of firearm-related
deaths, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitaliza-
tions in California.
Results: Compared with the 2 weeks before, postshow firearm
injury rates remained stable in regions near California gun shows
but increased from 0.67 injuries (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.80 injuries) to
1.14 injuries (CI, 0.97 to 1.30 injuries) per 100 000 persons in
regions near Nevada shows. After adjustment for seasonality and
clustering, California shows were not associated with increases in
local firearm injuries (rate ratio [RR], 0.99 [CI, 0.97 to 1.02]) but
Nevada shows were associated with increased injuries in Califor-
nia (RR, 1.69 [CI, 1.16 to 2.45]). The pre–post difference was sig-
nificantly higher for Nevada shows than California shows (ratio of
RRs, 1.70 [CI, 1.17 to 2.47]). The Nevada association was driven
by significant increases in firearm injuries from interpersonal vi-
olence (RR, 2.23 [CI, 1.01 to 4.89]) but corresponded to a small
increase in absolute numbers. Nonfirearm injuries served as a
negative control and were not associated with California or Ne-
vada gun shows. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
Limitation: Firearm injuries were examined only in California,
and gun show occurrence was not randomized.
Conclusion: Gun shows in Nevada, but not California, were as-
sociated with local, short-term increases in firearm injuries in Cal-
ifornia. Differing associations for California versus Nevada gun
shows may be due to California'
s stricter firearm regulations.

F
irearms are a leading cause of morbidity and mor-
tality in the United States and accounted for more
than 36 000 deaths and nearly 85 000 injuries in 2015
(1). Ownership increases the risk for suicide, homicide,
and unintentional firearm death and injury in the home
(2–8). Greater availability and ownership of firearms
also contributes to the higher rate of firearm deaths
and injuries (hereafter called “firearm injuries”) in the
United States than in other high-income countries (9–
12). Gun shows account for 4% to 9% of annual firearm
sales (13–15) and 3% of gun owners'most recent gun
acquisitions (16). However, many of these transfers do
not involve a background check (16) and firearms from
gun shows are disproportionately implicated in crimes
(17, 18). Little is known about how gun shows contrib-
ute to firearm injuries in the United States.
More than 4000 gun shows are held annually in the
United States (19). These shows, which can attract thou-
sands of attendees and hundreds of sellers, generate a
temporary and diverse source of new and used fire-
arms, ammunition, and related equipment in a compet-
itive market where sales may be subject to less over-
sight (15, 20). Consequently, gun shows may increase
local firearm ownership and use and affect subsequent
rates of firearm injury. State regulations also differ
markedly, which may modify the association between
gun shows and firearm injuries. In particular, interstate
activity and the flow of firearms from less to more re-
strictive states have been documented previously (21),
and this pattern, which may limit the effectiveness of
regulations in states that have them, may also extend to
gun shows.
Using a quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences
design, we exploited the natural variation in the timing
and location of gun shows to investigate whether they
are associated with increased injury rates and whether
this association varies by the state in which the gun
show is held. California has some of the most restrictive
firearm laws in the country, including a comprehensive
set of statutes regulating gun shows (22, 23). In con-
trast, Nevada has some of the least restrictive laws in
the country and no explicit regulations on gun shows
(22). Thus, comparing pre–post differences in California
and cross-border differences between California and
Nevada gun shows may provide useful information on
these different policy environments.

 No formal evaluations have assessed the effects of
policies regulating gun shows. Observational evidence
from 5 states suggests that such activities as anony-
mous and undocumented sales are less frequent in Cal-
ifornia, where they are prohibited, than in states where
they are legal (24). Previous evidence has also linked
firearms purchased at gun shows to crimes (17, 18), but
to our knowledge, only 1 study has examined the asso-
ciation between gun shows and subsequent firearm in-
juries. Duggan and colleagues (25) examined weekly
violent firearm deaths in ZIP codes in the immediate
vicinity of gun shows in California and Texas. They
found no association and suggested that California'
s
gun show regulations have no effect on violent firearm
deaths. However, the study was criticized as having
low statistical power, incomplete identification of gun
shows, and an analytic approach ignoring California'
s
requirement that buyers wait 10 days between purchas-
ing and obtaining a firearm (26, 27).
We addressed these gaps while assessing whether
firearm injuries increase in nearby California areas im-
mediately after gun shows in California and Nevada.
We hypothesized that gun shows lead to increased
rates of firearm injury.
METHODS
Overall Approach
We
used
a
quasi-experimental,
difference-in-
differences design (28, 29). First, we compared firearm
injury rates for the 2 weeks immediately before and
after each gun show in California regions within conve-
nient traveling distance of the show. Then, we com-
pared this difference for the California populations ex-
posed to California versus Nevada gun shows. This
approach is advantageous because each region'
s char-
acteristics, other than the occurrence of a show, are
unlikely to change appreciably over so short a time.
Thus, each region serves as its own control, allowing us
to adjust for community-level characteristics that may
be associated with firearm injuries.
Firearm Injuries
We identified fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries in
California between 2005 and 2013 using death records
from the California Department of Public Health Vital
Records and emergency department and inpatient
hospitalization records from the Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development. External cause-of-
injury coding in California'
s hospital discharge records
is mandatory, subject to ongoing quality assurance
measures, and considered 100% complete (30). Emer-
gency department records from before 2005 are not
available.
Gun Show Data
We compiled dates and locations of gun shows in
California and Nevada between 2005 and 2013 using
published lists in the Big Show Journal. This source was
the most comprehensive; other magazines (Gun and
Knife Show Calendar and Gun List Magazine) and on-
line sources (we considered 11 major Web sites) did
not cover the entire study period or included fewer list-
ings (95% vs. 65% coverage). We used ABBYY Fine-
Reader 12 character recognition software to convert
scanned images of show listings to electronic alphanu-
meric data (31).
Database Construction
Regions considered local to gun shows were deter-
mined using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API (32)
by measuring the typical driving time between each ZIP
code centroid in California and each geocoded gun
show location. Little evidence exists on how far or how
long the effects of gun shows extend (27). Thus, we
selected reasonable time frames and travel distances to
balance capturing short-term effects with estimating
stable rates and to include regions likely to be affected
by gun shows while excluding regions so distant that
unrelated firearm injuries might obscure potential rela-
tionships. We tested the sensitivity of our results to cho-
sen time frames and travel times in several sensitivity
analyses. “Before” periods were the 14 days before
each show; “after” periods were the 14 days after the
10-day waiting period from the start of the show for
California or after the start of the show for Nevada,
which has no waiting period. ZIP code centroids within
a 60- or 120-minute drive were considered to be within
traveling distance of California and Nevada shows, re-
spectively. In California, most persons can access a gun
show within a 60-minute drive every few weeks, but we
hypothesized that some persons in California would be
willing to travel farther to Nevada'
s comparatively un-
regulated environment.
ZIP codes were occasionally local to several gun
shows at the same time. This was problematic when the
“before” period of a later gun show (show B) over-
lapped with the “after” period of an earlier show (show
A). Without consideration of this overlap, the ZIP code
would be misclassified as “unexposed” for examination

 of show B when it was “exposed” to show A. In these
cases, we excluded the overlapping ZIP code from
analyses of show B (hereafter “overlap exclusions”). Re-
stricting to ZIP codes far enough from the border to
eliminate the need for overlap exclusions did not alter
the findings (results available on request). Throughout,
rates are reported per 100 000 persons in regions
within traveling distance of shows.
Statistical Analysis
We did a difference-in-differences analysis (28, 29)
at the gun show–period level using multivariable Pois-
son mixed-effects regression. The main outcome mea-
sure was the rate of firearm injury. The full model spec-
ification was as follows:
log�Ytsk� � �0 � �1Xt � �2Xk � �3Xt � Xk � �4Xm � �cs
� �c � log�dtsk� � �tsk
where ytks was the count of firearm injuries at time t in
the region surrounding gun show s in state k; �0, the
intercept; Xt, the period (after vs. before); Xk, the state
of the show (Nevada vs. California); Xm, month indica-
tors to account for seasonality; �cs and �c, random-
effects intercepts to account for clustering by gun
shows nested within cities; log(dtsk), an offset for the
number of at-risk persons; and �tsk, the error term. Sta-
tistical testing of the dispersion parameter indicated
that a Poisson model was more appropriate than a neg-
ative binomial model. Under this specification, exp(�1)
estimates the rate ratio (RR) associated with gun shows
in California, exp(�1 + �3) estimates the RR associated
with gun shows in Nevada, and exp(�3) estimates the
difference-in-differences estimate—the ratio of RRs—
capturing the increase in firearm injury rates after
Nevada shows compared with that after California
shows.
P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Data were processed by using SAS, version
9.3 (SAS Institute), and R, version 3.2.1 (R Foundation),
and regression analysis was done using the lme4 pack-
age (33) in R, version 3.2.1. This study was approved by
the State of California and University of California,
Berkeley, Committees for the Protection of Human
Subjects.
Subgroup and Secondary Analyses
To examine variation by firearm injury type, we did
subgroup analyses for intentional interpersonal vio-
lence, intentional self-harm, unintentional injuries, and
injuries of undetermined intent (Appendix Table 1,
available at Annals.org). Because the exposure periods
and geographic regions defined for California and Ne-
vada shows were not identical (with vs. without a wait-
ing period; a 60- vs. a 120-minute drive), we also strat-
ified the analysis by state. In addition, we did analyses
restricted to specific gun shows and affected regions to
examine potential associations along known firearm
trafficking routes between Reno and San Francisco and
between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. We also tested
the association between California gun shows and Cal-
ifornia firearm injuries ignoring the 10-day waiting pe-
riod, because activities other than legal firearm pur-
chases (such as ammunition or parts purchases, illegal
purchases, and repairs) may affect firearm injuries and
do not have a waiting period. We tested the association
between gun shows and nonfirearm injuries as a nega-
tive control to assess whether common causes of fire-

 arm and nonfirearm injuries confounded our findings
(34).
Finally, differences in associations between Califor-
nia and Nevada gun shows may be due to differing
characteristics of regions exposed to California shows
versus those exposed to Nevada shows. To address this
potential source of variation, we restricted the entire
analysis to regions similar to those exposed to Nevada
gun shows. We tightly matched on ZIP code character-
istics that differed between regions exposed to Califor-
nia versus Nevada shows and may modify the associa-
tion between gun shows and firearm injuries (35, 36).
These were population density, percentage of veter-
ans, median income, median age, percentage of white
non-Hispanic persons, hunting licenses per capita, and
the overall rate of firearm injury between 2005 and
2013. We tested a range of matching approaches, all of
which produced similar matches. Further details on the
matching approach and characteristics of this restricted
analysis are in the Appendix (available at Annals.org).
Power Calculations
To confirm that our study had sufficient statistical
power, we did a power analysis using simulated data
that were generated to be similar to the observed data
(Appendix Figure 1, available at Annals.org) (37). We
applied the main analysis regression approach to each
simulated data set and recorded the proportion of sim-
ulations with a significant association. This analysis indi-
cated that our study had 87.8% power to detect in-
creases in firearm injuries as large as or larger than
those seen for Nevada shows and 84.2% power to de-
tect the difference between California and Nevada gun
shows.
Bias Analysis
To assess the potential role of residual confound-
ing due to unmeasured factors, we did a quantitative
bias analysis. We estimated the characteristics of an un-
measured confounder that would yield the observed
associations between gun shows and firearm injuries, if
the true effect were not statistically significant.
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development; the National Institutes of Health Office of
the Director; the University of California, Berkeley,
Committee on Research; and the Heising-Simons Foun-
dation. The funding sources had no role in study de-
sign, conduct, data collection, data analysis, prepara-
tion of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the
manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
We identified 640 gun shows in California and 275
in Nevada between 1 January 2005 and 31 December
2013 (Table 1). Shows were held on weekends, usually
at convention centers or county fairgrounds, and lasted
2 to 3 days. Some shows returned to the same locations
at regular intervals, whereas others were held at irreg-
ular times and locations. Overlap exclusions were more
common for Nevada shows than for California shows
because those in Nevada were more frequent and held
in fewer locations. Appendix Figure 2 (available at
Annals.org) is a map of gun show locations. Table 1
provides characteristics of California and Nevada gun
shows and total person-weeks of exposure to gun
shows.

 Table 2 presents the number and rate of local fire-
arm injuries before and after California and Nevada
gun shows. In the 2 weeks preceding California shows,
15 000 firearm injuries occurred in at-risk regions, but
before–after rates remained stable for California shows.
For Nevada shows, only 44 firearm injuries occurred
during the preshow period (Table 2). However, firearm
injury rates increased from 0.67 injuries (95% CI, 0.55 to
0.80 injuries) per 100 000 persons to 1.14 injuries (CI,
0.97 to 1.30 injuries) per 100 000 persons in California
regions exposed to Nevada shows.
After adjustment, California shows were not associ-
ated with increases in firearm injuries (RR, 0.99 [CI, 0.97
to 1.02]), but Nevada shows were associated with sig-
nificant cross-border increases in firearm injuries in Cal-
ifornia (RR, 1.69 [CI, 1.16 to 2.45]) (Table 3). The differ-
ence between states was significant: Gun shows in
Nevada were associated with a 70% greater increase in
firearm injuries than those in California (ratio of RRs,
1.70 [CI, 1.17 to 2.47]). This association corresponds to
a rate difference of 0.46 (CI, 0.36 to 0.57) per 100 000
persons, or a 0.3-SD increase relative to the biweekly
variability in rates across locations. In terms of cases,
the association corresponds to 30 additional injuries in
regions exposed to the 161 Nevada shows.
The association with Nevada shows was driven by
significant increases in firearm injuries from interper-
sonal violence (RR, 2.23 [CI, 1.01 to 4.89]). Results for
analyses stratified by gun show state (Table 4) or re-
stricted to regions similar to those exposed to Nevada
shows (Table 5) were consistent with those from the
main analysis. No significant relationships existed be-
tween gun shows and firearm injuries along known traf-
ficking routes or when excluding California'
s 10-day
waiting period (Appendix Table 2, available at Annals
.org).
In sensitivity analyses of geographic range and du-
ration of exposure (Appendix Table 3, available at
Annals.org), associations between California shows and
firearm injuries were consistently null. For Nevada gun
shows, changes in firearm injuries remained statistically
significant for shorter (1-week) and longer (3-week) pe-
riods but were not statistically significant for smaller
geographic ranges (60-minute drive), which yielded
very few cases, or larger geographic ranges (120- and
180-minute drives for California and Nevada guns
shows, respectively), which covered large portions of
California. Nevada shows were significantly associated
with increases in self-directed intentional firearm inju-
ries when longer periods were examined.
The Appendix provides bias and negative control
analyses. In brief, for the association between Nevada
gun shows and California firearm injuries to be spuri-
ous, another factor would have to match the precise
geographic and temporal pattern of the 275 Nevada
gun shows and also be strongly associated with firearm
injuries in California, corresponding to RRs of at least
1.5 or 2. This factor would also have to be up to 80%
more prevalent in the 2 weeks after Nevada gun shows
than in the 2 weeks before. Bias analysis results were
similar for the difference-in-differences estimate com-
paring Nevada with California. Associations between
both California and Nevada gun shows and nonfirearm
injuries were null, or were statistically significant be-
cause of the large number of nonfirearm unintentional
injuries (n = 6 065 633) but not meaningfully different
from the null.
DISCUSSION
We examined the association between California
and Nevada gun shows and short-term changes in
local firearm injuries in California. Using a quasi-
experimental, difference-in-differences design, we took
advantage of natural variation in the timing and loca-
tion of gun shows and differences between California
and Nevada firearm regulations to compare this asso-
ciation by state. Firearm injuries in California remained
stable after California gun shows but increased by a
small but significant amount after Nevada shows.
Several factors could explain our findings. First, al-
though we did not formally assess the effect or enforce-
ment of firearm policies in either state, the absence of
an increase in firearm injuries after California gun
shows may be evidence that California'
s strict regula-
tory environment, both gun show–related and other-
wise, mitigates potential risk from gun shows through
deterrence. Among other restrictions, California re-
quires that all private transfers be documented by a
licensed dealer and include a background check (22). It
also enforces restrictions on gun shows (23), including
a range of security- and enforcement-related planning
and reporting practices, that may deter the illegal fire-
arm activity historically seen at gun shows (15, 17, 18,
20). Specialized firearm enforcement agents from the
California Department of Justice also do surveillance at

 California gun shows. In contrast, Nevada does not re-
quire background checks or documentation for private
transfers and places no regulations on gun shows.
Thus, California'
s measures may prevent illegal activi-
ties that could lead to increases in interpersonal firearm
injuries.
A second possibility is that California'
s regulations
and 10-day waiting period motivate buyers to cross
into Nevada when seeking a faster, less-regulated
source of firearms. This mechanism, which suggests
displacement rather than deterrence, would imply that
even if California'
s regulations are mitigating risk from
gun shows within its borders, travel to less-restrictive
states may threaten the effectiveness of California'
s
laws. Indeed, interstate gun trafficking, including that
between Nevada and California, is well-documented
and fueled in part by gun shows (18–21, 38, 39).
A third possibility is that gun shows affect Califor-
nians near Nevada differently from Californians in the
rest of the state. However, analyses restricted to re-
gions similar to those along the California–Nevada bor-
der produced results consistent with the main analysis,
suggesting that the characteristics of border communi-
ties are not major drivers of the observed differences.
Gun show occurrence was not randomized. Thus, a
fourth possibility is that the observed association is due
to uncontrolled confounders. However, gun shows
were not associated with nonfirearm injuries, providing
evidence that the results are not due to confounding by
common causes of firearm and nonfirearm injuries (34).
Furthermore, the quantitative bias analysis indicated
that for the observed associations to be spurious, at
least 1 factor would have to match the geographic and
temporal pattern of the gun shows, be strongly associ-
ated with firearm injuries, be unevenly distributed be-
tween California and Nevada, and change markedly in
prevalence in the 2 weeks after gun shows compared
with the 2 weeks before. Identifying a factor that fits
these criteria is challenging, which strengthens confi-
dence in our results. Similar bias analyses have been
used to bolster evidence of the association between
firearm ownership and suicide (40).
Our null findings for California gun shows are con-
sistent with those of Duggan and colleagues (25). How-
ever, our study was the first to our knowledge to assess
interstate associations and suggests that travel across
state lines may be important. Our study avoided sev-
eral limitations highlighted in previous critiques of
Duggan and colleagues'study (26, 27) by being well-
powered statistically, analyzing data from the show-
period level rather than the ZIP code–week level, and
accounting for California'
s 10-day waiting period. Our
approach was also strengthened by inclusion of nonfa-
tal injuries and unintentional and intent-undetermined
firearm injuries, rather than only firearm suicides and
homicides. In addition, we examined geographic areas
defined by driving distances and incorporated overlap
exclusions for regions simultaneously exposed to 1
show and unexposed to another.
This study had limitations. First, all nonexperimen-
tal studies are subject to residual confounding. We
minimized the effect of potential confounders by com-
paring identical regions over brief periods, during
which factors other than gun shows are unlikely to vary;
we also did negative control and quantitative bias anal-
yses to assess the sensitivity of our results to an unob-
served confounder. Second, few firearm injuries oc-
curred in regions exposed to Nevada gun shows;
however, rates for this region were derived from
13 037 052 person-weeks of exposure (Table 1). Third,
cause-of-death and cause-of-injury classification on
death and discharge records is imperfect, although
studies suggest that the degree of misclassification is
not substantial enough to alter major trends and pat-
terns (41, 42). Fourth, we did not examine associations
with firearm injuries in Nevada populations. Future re-
search on the effects of gun shows in Nevada and other
states would be valuable. Fifth, data on nonfatal injuries
include most hospital visits for firearm injuries but do
not include military hospitals. Lastly, evidence suggests
that firearms purchased at gun shows and recovered
from crime scenes are rarely found in the immediate
region or period after shows (27). However, these pat-
terns do not preclude the possibility of a proximate ef-
fect, particularly because first use of a gun may predate
its recovery from a crime scene.
In conclusion, gun shows are an important source
of firearms and may offer an opportunity for regulatory
intervention. Results from this study suggest that Cali-
fornia gun shows are not associated with short-term in-
creases in firearm injuries but that Nevada shows are
associated with cross-border increases in firearm inju-
ries in California. Differences in regulations may explain
this pattern, but alternative explanations exist, and the
short-term increase in firearm injuries attributable to
gun shows is small relative to the number of firearm

APPENDIX: IN-STATE AND INTERSTATE
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GUN SHOWS
AND FIREARM DEATHS AND INJURIES:
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION,
METHODS, AND RESULTS
Firearm Injury Classification Codes
We identified fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries in
California between 2005 and 2013 using International
Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, exter-
nal cause-of-injury codes contained in death records
from the California Department of Public Health Vital
Records and in emergency department and inpatient
hospitalization records from the Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development. To examine varia-
tion by firearm injury type, we did subgroup analyses
for intentional interpersonal violence, intentional self-
harm, unintentional injuries, and injuries of undeter-
mined intent. International Classification of Diseases
codes used in this analysis are presented by subgroup
in Appendix Table 1.
Power Calculations
To confirm that our study had sufficient statistical
power, we did a power analysis using simulated data
that were generated to be similar to the observed data.
We used the observed number of firearm deaths and
injuries for the 2 weeks before each gun show (in re-
gions within convenient traveling distance of each
show) and simulated the number of firearm deaths and
injuries in the 2 weeks after each show. Appendix Fig-
ure 1 presents the observed and simulated distribu-
tions of firearm deaths and injuries for the 2 weeks after
gun shows. The distributions are very similar, suggest-
ing that the power analysis is based on simulated data
that accurately reflect the observed data.
We applied the main analysis regression approach
to each simulated data set and recorded the propor-
tion of simulations with a significant association. This
analysis indicated that our study had 87.8% power to
detect increases in firearm deaths and injuries as large
as or larger than those seen for Nevada shows and
84.2% power to detect the difference between Califor-
nia and Nevada gun shows.
Gun Show Locations
Appendix Figure 2 presents the locations of all gun
shows identified in California and Nevada between
2005 and 2013. Locations included in each analysis de-
pend on the analysis specification (geographic range
[driving distance] and duration of preexposure and
postexposure periods). In particular, some shows in
northeastern Nevada were not included in analyses re-
stricted to Nevada shows within a 120-minute drive of
California but were included in sensitivity analyses ex-
tending to longer driving distances.
Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses
Little evidence exists on how far or how long the
effects of gun shows extend (27). Thus, we selected
reasonable time frames and travel times to balance
capturing short-term effects with estimating stable rates
and to include regions likely to be affected by gun
shows while excluding regions so distant that unrelated
firearm injuries might obscure potential relationships.
We then tested the sensitivity of our results to chosen
time frames and travel times.
Appendix Table 3 presents the results of these sen-
sitivity analyses. Associations between California shows
and firearm deaths and injuries were consistently null.
For Nevada gun shows, changes in firearm injuries re-
mained statistically significant for shorter (1-week) and
longer (3-week) periods but were not statistically signif-
icant for smaller geographic ranges (60-minute drive),
which yielded very few cases, and larger geographic
ranges (120- and 180-minute drives for California and
Nevada guns shows, respectively), which covered large
portions of California. Nevada shows were significantly
associated with increases in self-directed intentional
firearm injuries when examining longer periods.
We restricted additional secondary analyses to
specific gun shows and affected regions to examine
potential associations along known firearm trafficking
routes between Reno and San Francisco and between
Las Vegas and Los Angeles. We also tested the associ-
ation between California gun shows and California fire-
arm injuries ignoring the 10-day waiting period, be-
cause activities other than legal firearm purchases, such
as ammunition or parts purchases, illegal purchases,
and repairs, may affect firearm injuries and do not have
a waiting period.

 Appendix Table 2 presents the results of these sec-
ondary analyses. No significant relationships existed
between gun shows and firearm injuries along known
trafficking routes or when California'
s 10-day waiting
period was excluded.
Sensitivity Analysis Restricted to Regions
Similar to Those Exposed to Nevada Gun Shows
One important consideration in interpreting the re-
sults of the main analysis is that characteristics of the
regions exposed to gun shows may modify the associ-
ation between shows and firearm deaths and injuries.
The observed differences in associations between Cal-
ifornia and Nevada gun shows and firearm deaths and
injuries may be due to differences in the characteristics
of the regions exposed to California gun shows versus
those exposed to Nevada gun shows. For example, re-
gions exposed to Nevada gun shows tend to be more
rural and have lower rates of firearm death and injury
(Table 2 and Appendix Table 4).
To address this potential source of variation, we
restricted the entire analysis to regions similar to those
exposed to Nevada gun shows. We identified these re-
gions by tightly matching on ZIP code characteristics
that differed between regions exposed to California
versus Nevada shows and may modify the association
between gun shows and firearm deaths and injuries.
These were population density, percentage of veter-
ans, median income, median age, percentage of white
non-Hispanic persons, hunting licenses per capita, and
the overall rate of firearm injury between 2005 and
2013. We used 1-to-many greedy Mahalanobis dis-
tance matching (a generalization of nearest-neighbor
matching based on Euclidean distance) with replace-
ment and a caliper of 0.01 SDs of the distance measure
(43). This means that several ZIP codes exposed to Cal-
ifornia shows could be matched to each ZIP code ex-
posed to a Nevada show. We discarded ZIP codes with
characteristics with values outside the range of those
observed for ZIP codes exposed to Nevada gun shows.
Other
matching
approaches,
such
as
optimal
or
nearest-neighbor matching based on the propensity
score, produced nearly identical matches. Although re-
stricting to the California region along the California–
Nevada border exposed to both California and Nevada
gun shows was not possible because the populations
were too sparse to estimate stable rates of firearm
deaths and injuries, this approach provides a close ap-
proximation by restricting locations to those very simi-
lar to this border region.
Of the 1769 ZIP codes in California, 490 remained
after restriction and 192 of those were matched more
than once because of replacement. Appendix Table 4
presents the distribution of the potentially modifying
characteristics before and after restriction and com-
pared with ZIP codes exposed to Nevada gun shows.
After restriction, the remaining ZIP codes were very
similar to those exposed to Nevada gun shows. Com-
pared with all California ZIP codes, the restricted set is
less densely populated; includes more veterans and
non-Hispanic whites; and has higher median income,
median age, and hunting licenses per capita.
Table 5 presents the results of the restricted analy-
sis. Results are nearly identical to those of the main
analysis, suggesting that modification by these factors
is not a driver of the observed differences in associa-
tions between California and Nevada gun shows and
firearm deaths and injuries.
Negative Control Analysis
We tested the association between gun shows and
nonfirearm injuries as a negative control to assess
whether common causes of firearm and nonfirearm in-
juries confounded our findings (34). Using the same
data sources and analytic approach as in the main anal-
ysis, we found that neither California nor Nevada gun
shows were meaningfully associated with short-term in-
creases in nonfirearm injuries (Appendix Table 5). Al-
though several of the tested associations were statisti-
cally significant, this finding was driven by the large
number
of
nonfirearm
unintentional
injuries
(n =
6 065 633), and the RRs were effectively null. These re-
sults provide further evidence that the results are not
due to confounding by common causes of firearm and
nonfirearm injuries.
Quantitative Bias Analysis for an Unobserved
Confounder
To assess the potential role of residual confound-
ing due to unmeasured factors, we did a quantitative
bias analysis for 2 of the measured associations: that
between gun shows in Nevada and firearm deaths and
injuries in California and that between state of gun
show and increases in firearm deaths and injuries after
shows.
Association Between Gun Shows in Nevada and
Firearm Deaths and Injuries in California
We estimated the characteristics of an unmeasured
confounder that would yield the observed association
between gun shows in Nevada and firearm deaths and
injuries in California, if the true effect were not statisti-
cally significant. To do this, we used the bias equation
presented by VanderWeele and Arah (44) for the RR
and applied it to the estimated RR of the association
between Nevada gun shows and firearm deaths and
injuries in California (exp[�1 + �3] in the main regres-
sion analysis).
We defined the following random variables: Let A
be a binary indicator representing exposure to Nevada

 tion in California, let X be the measured covariates con-
trolled in the main analysis, and let U be an unmea-
sured confounder. Following VanderWeele and Arah'
s
analysis, we made 3 assumptions: first, that the associ-
ation between U and Y does not vary between strata of
A; second, that the association between U and A does
not vary between strata of X; and third, that U is binary.
Under these conditions, the bias in the conditional
causal RR is defined as the ratio between the observed
RR and the true conditional causal RR and is computed
as:
d+a
RR(x) =
1 + (� − 1)P(U = 1�a = 1,x)
1 + (� − 1)P(U = 1�a = 0,x)
where � is the association between U and Y, defined as
� = E(Y|a,x,u = 1)/E(Y|a,x,u = 0). The association be-
tween U and A is defined as � = P(U = 1|a = 1,x)/P(U =
1|a = 0,x).
We estimated the corrected lower confidence
bound of the RR for the association between Nevada
gun shows and the rate of firearm deaths and injuries in
California (observed RR, 1.69 [CI, 1.16 to 2.45]) across a
range of bias scenarios. We tested values of � (the rel-
ative association of U with Y) ranging from 1 to 3, values
of � (the relative association of U with A) ranging from 1
to 3, and prevalence of U among the exposed (P(U =
1|a = 1,x)) ranging between 0.1 and 0.8. This analysis
tells us how prevalent U must be and how strong the
U–A and U–Y relationships would have to be for an un-
controlled confounder to explain the association ob-
served in our study.
Appendix Figure 3 presents the results of this anal-
ysis. Across all of the scenarios we considered, an un-
measured confounder would need to be associated
with both gun shows and firearm deaths and injuries
with RRs of at least 1.5 or 2 to yield the observed asso-
ciation, if the true effect were not statistically significant.
This analysis informs our interpretation of the re-
sults. For the association between Nevada gun shows
and firearm deaths and injuries in California to be spu-
rious, another factor would have to match the geo-
graphic and temporal pattern of the 275 Nevada gun
shows and be strongly associated with firearm deaths
and injuries in California. This factor would have to be
notably more prevalent after Nevada gun shows than
before, corresponding to RRs of at least 1.5 or 2 for a
confounder that is up to 80% more prevalent in the 2
weeks after Nevada gun shows than in the 2 weeks be-
fore. Identifying a factor that fits these criteria is chal-
lenging. Similar bias analyses have been used to
strengthen evidence of the association between fire-
arm ownership and suicide (40). One possibility is that
this factor is a marker or artifact of Nevada gun shows;
for example, if persons at higher risk for firearm deaths
and injuries come to California areas near Nevada
shows when Nevada shows are occurring, or happen-
ings at Nevada gun shows prompt persons in nearby
California to use their firearms in ways they otherwise
might not, then we might see the observed association.
There may be other explanations as well.
Association Between State of Gun Show and Increases
in Firearm Deaths and Injuries After Gun Shows
We also estimated the characteristics of an unmea-
sured confounder that would yield the observed asso-
ciation between the state in which the gun show was
held and increases in firearm deaths and injuries after
gun shows, if the true effect were not statistically signif-
icant. Again, we used the bias equation presented by
VanderWeele and Arah (44), but in this case, we ap-
plied it to the ratio of RRs for the association between
the state in which the gun show was held (Nevada
vs. California) and increases in firearm deaths and inju-
ries after gun shows (exp[�3] in the main regression
analysis).
For this application, we defined the following ran-
dom variables: Let A be a binary indicator representing
the state in which the gun show was held (Nevada vs.
California), Y be the change in rate of firearm deaths
and injuries per 100 000 population in the 2 weeks be-
fore gun shows compared with the 2 weeks after, X be
the measured covariates controlled in the main analy-
sis, and U be an unmeasured confounder. Following
VanderWeele and Arah'
s analysis, we made the same 3
assumptions as above, and the bias in the conditional
causal RR is defined as above.
We estimated the corrected lower confidence
bound for the ratio of RRs estimate of the association
between the state of the gun show and increases in
firearm deaths and injuries after shows (observed, 1.70
[CI, 1.17 to 2.47]) across a range of bias scenarios.
Again, we tested values of � (the relative association of
U with Y) ranging from 1 to 3, values of � (the relative
association of U with A) ranging from 1 to 3, and prev-
alence of U for Nevada gun shows (P(U = 1|a = 1,x))
ranging between 0.1 and 0.8. This analysis tells us how
prevalent U must be for Nevada gun shows and how
strong the U–A and U–Y relationships would have to be
for an uncontrolled confounder to explain the associa-
tion observed in our study.
Appendix Figure 4 presents the results of this anal-
ysis. Across all of the scenarios we considered, an un-
measured confounder would need to be associated
with both the state of the gun shows and increases in
firearm deaths and injuries after shows with RRs of at
least 1.5 or 2 to yield the observed association, if the
true effect were not statistically significant.
This analysis informs our interpretation of the re-
sults. For the association between state and increases
in firearm deaths and injuries after shows to be spuri-

 ous, another factor would have to match the geo-
graphic and temporal pattern of the 915 gun shows in
both states. This factor would also have to be strongly
associated with both the state of the gun show and
changes in firearm deaths and injuries immediately be-
fore and after the shows, corresponding to RRs of at
least 1.5 to 2 for a confounder that is up to 80% more
prevalent for Nevada shows than California shows.
Identifying a factor that fits these criteria is challenging.
Similar bias analyses have been used to strengthen ev-
idence of the association between firearm ownership
and suicide (40).

The unit of analysis is the gun show. The figure presents the distribution of the observed and simulated number of firearm deaths and injuries, per
gun show, ≤2 wk after each gun show, in regions within driving distance of each show, by state. For example, in both the observed and simulated
data, just fewer than 300 gun show regions had no firearm deaths or injuries ≤2 wk after the show.
