BACKGROUND
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an eosinophilic 
phenotype may benefit from treatment with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody 
directed against interleukin-5.
METHODS
We performed two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-
group trials comparing mepolizumab (100 mg in METREX, 100 or 300 mg in METREO) 
with placebo, given as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in patients 
with COPD who had a history of moderate or severe exacerbations while taking in-
haled glucocorticoid-based triple maintenance therapy. In METREX, unselected pa-
tients in the modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype 
were stratified according to blood eosinophil count (≥150 per cubic millimeter at 
screening or ≥300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year). In METREO, all 
patients had a blood eosinophil count of at least 150 per cubic millimeter at screening 
or at least 300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year. The primary end point 
was the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Safety was also assessed.
RESULTS
In METREX, the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the modified 
intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype (462 patients) was 1.40 
per year in the mepolizumab group versus 1.71 per year in the placebo group (rate ratio, 
0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.98; adjusted P 
= 
0.04); no significant be-
tween-group differences were found in the overall modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion (836 patients) (rate ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.12; adjusted P>0.99). In METREO, 
the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was 1.19 per year in the 
100-mg mepolizumab group, 1.27 per year in the 300-mg mepolizumab group, and 
1.49 per year in the placebo group. The rate ratios for exacerbations in the 100-mg and 
300-mg mepolizumab groups versus the placebo group were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; 
adjusted P 
= 
0.07) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.05; adjusted P 
= 
0.14), respectively. A 
greater effect of mepolizumab, as compared with placebo, on the annual rate of mod-
erate or severe exacerbations was found among patients with higher blood eosinophil 
counts at screening. The safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to that of placebo.
CONCLUSIONS
Mepolizumab at a dose of 100 mg was associated with a lower annual rate of moder-
ate or severe exacerbations than placebo among patients with COPD and an eosino-
philic phenotype. This finding suggests that eosinophilic airway inflammation 
contributes to COPD exacerbations. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline; METREX and

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
C
hronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) is a common disease charac-
terized by progressive airflow obstruction, 
chronic inflammation in the lungs, and the oc-
currence of persistent symptoms and acute exac-
erbations.1 Up to 40% of patients with COPD 
have an eosinophilic phenotype, defined as a 
peripheral-blood differential eosinophil count of 
2% or more, which equates to approximately 150 
to 200 eosinophils per cubic millimeter.2,3 Blood 
eosinophil counts of this level are associated 
with an increased risk of COPD exacerbations; 
the risk can be partially mitigated by long-term 
treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids.4,5 More-
over, these patients have a good response to treat-
ment of acute exacerbations with oral glucocorti-
coids.6,7 These findings are consistent with a 
pathogenic role for eosinophils in exacerbations of 
COPD and provide a strong rationale for therapies 
that specifically inhibit eosinophilic inflammation.
Current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruc-
tive Lung Disease (GOLD) treatment guidelines for 
COPD recommend maintenance use of triple in-
haled therapy that includes a combination of in-
haled glucocorticoids, long-acting β2-agonists, 
and long-acting muscarinic-receptor antagonists 
in patients with frequent exacerbations who do 
not have adequate outcomes with other treat-
ments.1 However, approximately 30 to 40% of 
patients are reported to continue to have moder-
ate or severe exacerbations despite receiving tri-
ple inhaled therapy.8,9
Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-
body, reduces eosinophil counts in blood and 
tissues by blocking interleukin-5, a key eosinophil 
cytokine, through binding to eosinophil surface 
receptors.10,11 In patients with severe eosinophilic 
asthma, mepolizumab treatment has been found 
to be associated with lower rates of exacerba-
tions and symptoms and with greater improve-
ments in health-related quality of life than pla-
cebo and the existing standard of care.12-14 In 
post hoc analyses of data from the Mepolizumab 
as Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Severe 
Asthma (MENSA) and Dose Ranging Efficacy 
and Safety with Mepolizumab in Severe Asthma 
(DREAM) trials, mepolizumab was also associ-
ated with lower exacerbation rates than placebo 
among patients who had severe eosinophilic 
asthma with clinical features of COPD.12,13,15
The objective of the Mepolizumab vs. Placebo 
as Add-on Treatment for Frequently Exacerbat-
ing COPD Patients (METREX) and Mepolizumab 
vs. Placebo as Add-on Treatment for Frequently 
Exacerbating COPD Patients Characterized by Eo-
sinophil Level (METREO) trials was to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous mepo 
liz-
umab, as compared with placebo, as an add-on 
to triple inhaled therapy in patients with COPD 
who had an eosinophilic phenotype and a his-
tory of moderate or severe exacerbations, as well 
as the phenotypes of patients who are likely to 
have a response to mepolizumab treatment.
Methods
Design of the Trials
METREX and METREO were phase 3, random-
ized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-
group trials; METREX was conducted in 16 coun-
tries (117 investigative sites), and METREO was 
conducted in 15 countries (168 investigative 
sites). Information regarding the authors’ contri-
butions (including those of authors who are em-
ployees of GlaxoSmithKline) to the trial design, 
data collection and analysis, and manuscript de-
velopment is provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org. All the authors had access to the 
data and vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidel-
ity of the trials to the protocols, which, along 
with the statistical analysis plans, are available 
at NEJM.org (Protocol 1 [METREX] and Protocol 2 
[METREO]). Editorial support was provided by 
medical writers; this support was funded by 
GlaxoSmithKline.
After screening, eligible patients in METREX 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
subcutaneous injections of mepolizumab (100 mg) 
or placebo; in METREO, eligible patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
subcutaneous injections of 100 mg of mepoliz-
umab, 300 mg of mepolizumab, or placebo. 
During the treatment period, injections were 
administered every 4 weeks for 52 weeks (final 
dose at week 48), in addition to triple inhaled 
therapy (administered in accordance with the 
standard of care); the treatment period was fol-
lowed by 8 weeks of follow-up (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For both trials, pa-
tients who prematurely discontinued the trial

regimen were not required to withdraw from 
the trial but were encouraged to attend all the 
trial visits as planned in order to complete the 
trial assessments.
Both trials were conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, the International Conference on Har-
monisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, 
and the applicable country-specific regulatory 
requirements. All the patients provided written 
informed consent.
Trial Population
In both trials, enrolled patients were 40 years of 
age or older and had a documented diagnosis of 
COPD for at least 1 year (based on the American 
Thoracic Society–European Respiratory Society 
2004 definition16); had a ratio of the forced ex-
piratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced 
vital capacity (FVC) of less than 0.70 before and 
after bronchodilator use and a FEV1 after bron-
chodilator use that was more than 20% and less 
than or equal to 80% of the predicted value; and 
had a documented history of two or more mod-
erate exacerbations (i.e., treated with systemic 
glucocorticoids, antibiotic agents, or both in asso-
ciation with a worsening of COPD) or one or more 
severe exacerbations (i.e., leading to hospitaliza-
tion) in the previous 12 months. For 12 months 
before screening, patients had to have been re-
ceiving background inhaled glucocorticoid–based 
therapy consisting of high-dose inhaled gluco-
corticoids (≥500 μg per day of fluticasone pro-
pionate or equivalent), a long-acting bronchodi-
lator (either a long-acting β2-agonist or a long-acting 
muscarinic-receptor antagonist), and a third 
class of regularly prescribed COPD medication 
(e.g., a long-acting β2-agonist, long-acting musca-
rinic-receptor antagonist, phosphodiesterase-4 
inhibitor, or methylxanthine). For a minimum of 
3 months immediately before screening, patients 
had to have been receiving triple inhaled therapy 
consisting of a high-dose inhaled glucocorti-
coid, long-acting β2-agonist, and long-acting 
muscarinic-receptor antagonist. Current or for-
mer smokers (≥10 pack-years) and nonsmokers 
were included. Patients with a current diagnosis 
of asthma and nonsmokers with a history of 
asthma were excluded.
At randomization in METREX, patients were 
stratified on the basis of blood eosinophil 
counts as having either an eosinophilic pheno-
type (eosinophil count, ≥150 per cubic millime-
ter at screening or ≥300 per cubic millimeter at 
any point in the previous year) or a noneosino-
philic phenotype (eosinophil count, <150 per 
cubic millimeter at screening and no evidence of 
≥300 per cubic millimeter in the previous year). 
In METREO, only patients who had an eosino-
philic phenotype were eligible for inclusion. 
Further details regarding the inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
End Points and Assessments
In both trials, the primary end point was the 
annual rate of exacerbations classified as moder-
ate (leading to systemic glucocorticoid treat-
ment, antibiotic treatment, or both) or severe 
(leading to hospitalization or resulting in death). 
The secondary end points were the time to the 
first moderate or severe exacerbation; the an-
nual rate of exacerbations leading to an emer-
gency department visit, hospitalization, or both; 
the mean change from baseline at week 52 in 
the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire total 
score (SGRQ, measured by the SGRQ-COPD ques-
tionnaire; scores range from 0 to 100 points, with 
higher scores indicating worse health status; 
minimal clinically important difference, 4-point 
decrease from baseline17-19) and in the COPD As-
sessment Test (CAT) score (scores range from 0 to 
40 units, with higher scores indicating greater 
effect of disease; minimal clinically important 
difference, 2-point decrease from baseline20,21). 
Other end points (all assessed at week 52) in-
cluded the change from screening in blood eo-
sinophil count; the change from baseline in FEV1, 
FVC, and SGRQ domain (symptoms, activity, and 
impact domains) scores; the proportion of pa-
tients with an SGRQ response (i.e., a ≥4-point de-
crease from baseline), and the proportion of pa-
tients with a CAT response (i.e., a ≥2-point 
decrease from baseline); and the physician-rated 
and patient-rated response.
The efficacy end points were assessed in a 
modified intention-to-treat population compris-
ing all patients who underwent randomization 
and received at least one dose of mepolizumab 
or placebo; the analysis was according to the 
randomly assigned trial groups. In METREX, the 
primary analysis populations were the modified

intention-to-treat population with an eosino-
philic phenotype (patients with blood eosinophil 
counts ≥150 per cubic millimeter at screening or 
≥300 per cubic millimeter within the previous 
year) and the overall modified intention-to-treat 
population (all patients, with no eosinophil cri-
teria applied). In METREO, the primary analysis 
population was the modified intention-to-treat 
population. Within each respective patient popu-
lation, comparisons were made between each 
mepolizumab dose and placebo.
A prespecified meta-analysis of the primary 
end point was performed in the combined popula-
tion (i.e., the modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion with an eosinophilic phenotype in METREX 
and the modified intention-to-treat population 
in METREO) according to blood eosinophil count 
category at screening (<150 [history of ≥300 in 
the previous year], ≥150 to <300, ≥300 to <500, 
and ≥500 per cubic millimeter) and according to 
blood eosinophil count threshold at screening 
(<150 [history of ≥300 in the previous year], 
≥150, ≥300, and ≥500 per cubic millimeter). The 
prespecified meta-analysis plan also included an 
assessment of the primary end point according 
to region (Europe, United States, and the rest of 
the world).
Three post hoc analyses were performed. 
First, the primary end point was assessed in 
patients with blood eosinophil counts of less 
than 150 per cubic millimeter, regardless of 
historical blood eosinophil count (in a combined 
population that included the METREX overall 
modified intention-to-treat population and the 
METREO modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion). Second, the primary end point was as-
sessed in patients with blood eosinophil counts 
of 300 per cubic millimeter or higher at screen-
ing or during the previous year (in the METREX 
modified intention-to-treat population with an 
eosinophilic phenotype and the METREO modi-
fied intention-to-treat population). Third, the 
effect of mepolizumab, as compared with pla-
cebo, on the annual rate of moderate or severe 
exacerbations treated with glucocorticoids (alone 
or in addition to antibiotics), as well as those 
treated with antibiotics alone, was assessed (in a 
combined population that included the METREX 
overall modified intention-to-treat population 
and the METREO modified intention-to-treat 
population).
The safety end points included adverse events 
and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was 
also assessed.
Statistical Analysis
For the assessment of the effect of mepolizumab 
in patients with an eosinophilic phenotype in 
METREX, we estimated that 400 patients (200 pa-
tients in each group) would be required to provide 
the trial with 90% power to detect a 35% lower 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the 
mepolizumab group (on the basis of an expected 
rate of 2.0 per year in the placebo group vs. 1.3 per 
year in the mepolizumab group) at a two-sided 
alpha level of 4%. An additional 400 patients 
(200 patients in each group) with noneosino-
philic COPD were also included in the trial, 
which provided the trial with 90% power to de-
tect a 30% between-group difference at a two-
sided alpha level of 1% in the overall modified 
intention-to-treat population. In METREO, an esti-
mated 660 patients (220 patients in each group) 
were expected to provide the trial with 90% 
power to detect a 35% between-group difference 
in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (on 
the basis of an expected rate of 2.0 per year in the 
placebo group vs. 1.3 per year in each mepoli-
zumab group) at a two-sided alpha level of 5%.
The multiplicity of comparisons within each 
trial was addressed with the use of prespecified 
multiple-testing procedures. For METREX, the 
alpha was split between the primary comparison 
in the modified intention-to-treat population 
with an eosinophilic phenotype (alpha, 4%) and 
the overall modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion (alpha, 1%). For METREO, a Hochberg test-
ing procedure was specified to control for the 
multiple comparisons of each mepolizumab dose 
versus placebo. For both trials, a prespecified or-
der of testing for the primary and secondary end 
points was applied (further details are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
In both trials, the annual rates of moderate 
or severe exacerbations and of exacerbations that 
led to emergency department visits or hospital-
ization were compared between each dose group 
and the placebo group with the use of a negative 
binomial model with covariates of smoking sta-
tus (current smoker vs. nonsmoker or former 
smoker), number of moderate or severe exacer-
bations in the previous year (≤2, 3, or ≥4, as an 
ordinal variable), baseline disease severity (as 
the percentage of the predicted FEV1 after bron-

chodilator use), and geographic region. In addi-
tion, the natural log of time was included as an 
offset variable. The time to the first moderate or 
severe exacerbation was analyzed with the use of 
a Cox proportional-hazards model including the 
same covariates as for the primary end point. 
Continuous end points were analyzed with a 
mixed-model repeated-measures analysis with 
adjustment for baseline value, smoking status, 
and geographic region and including terms for 
an interaction between trial visit and baseline 
value and for an interaction between trial visit 
and trial group.
In both trials, safety was assessed in all pa-
tients who underwent randomization and re-
ceived one or more doses of mepolizumab or 
placebo; the analysis was conducted according 
to the actual trial agent received for more than 
50% of the injections administered. In METREX, 
safety was also assessed in the safety population 
with an eosinophilic phenotype (same eosino-
phil criteria as the modified intention-to-treat 
population with an eosinophilic phenotype) and 
the safety population without an eosinophilic 
phenotype (same eosinophil criteria as the mod-
ified intention-to-treat population without an eo-
sinophilic phenotype; eosinophil count, <150 per 
cubic millimeter at screening and no evidence of 
≥300 per cubic millimeter in the previous year).
For both trials, data provided by patients who 
continued in the trial after discontinuation of 
the randomly assigned trial regimen were in-
cluded in the analyses of the efficacy end points 
to provide a treatment policy estimate (i.e., an 
estimate of the effect of mepolizumab both dur-
ing and after treatment) in the intention-to-treat 
population. The analysis of the primary end 
point used a negative binomial model that as-
sumes missing data to be missing at random; 
sensitivity analyses to assess departures from 
this assumption were performed. Missing data 
for patients who withdrew early from the trial 
were imputed for the period after withdrawal 
from the trial and up to expected trial comple-
tion with the use of a jump-to-reference ap-
proach,22 in which the rate of exacerbations 
among patients who received mepolizumab was 
shifted to that in the placebo group. In addition, 
we used an approach whereby the imputations of 
missing data were based on the data collected 
after discontinuation of the trial regimen in each 
trial group (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Further details regarding sample-size estima-
tion and multiple-testing procedures are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix. All analyses were 
performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute).
Results
Patient Population
In METREX, patients were recruited from April 
2014 through November 2015, with follow-up 
continuing until mid-January 2017. In total, 1161 
patients were enrolled, 837 of whom underwent 
randomization and 836 of whom received at least 
one dose of mepolizumab or placebo (1 patient 
who was randomly assigned to the placebo group 
did not receive any dose). The modified inten-
tion-to-treat population with an eosinophilic 
phenotype, modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion without an eosinophilic phenotype, and 
overall modified intention-to-treat population 
included 462, 374, and 836 patients, respectively. 
The percentage of patients who discontinued the 
trial regimen was higher in the placebo group 
than in the mepolizumab group in both the 
modified intention-to-treat population with an 
eosinophilic phenotype (19% vs. 13%) and the 
modified intention-to-treat population without an 
eosinophilic phenotype (22% vs. 19%) (Fig. 1).
In METREO, patients were recruited from April 
2014 through November 2015, with follow-up con-
tinuing until mid-January 2017. In total, 1071 pa-
tients were enrolled, 675 of whom underwent 
randomization and 674 of whom received at least 
one dose of mepolizumab or placebo (1 patient 
who was randomly assigned to the 300-mg mepo-
lizumab group did not receive any dose). The 
modified intention-to-treat population included 
674 patients. The percentage of patients who 
discontinued the trial regimen was higher in the 
placebo group than in either mepolizumab group 
in the modified intention-to-treat population (25% 
vs. 12% [100 mg] and 19% [300 mg]) (Fig. 2).
In both trials, the numbers of patients were 
balanced among the trial groups (Figs. 1 and 2). 
In both trials, 94% or more of patients had GOLD 
group D COPD (i.e., ≥2 exacerbations in total, or 
≥1 exacerbation leading to hospitalization, in 
the previous year, plus either a modified Medical 
Research Council Dyspnea Scale score of ≥2 
[scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores 
indicating more severe dyspnea] or a CAT score

Exacerbations
Primary End Point
The difference between the trial groups with 
regard to the primary end point was significant 
in METREX but not in METREO. In the modified 
intention-to-treat population with an eosino-
philic phenotype in METREX, the mean annual 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the 
mepolizumab group was 1.40 per year, as com-
pared with 1.71 per year in the placebo group 
(rate ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.68 to 0.98; adjusted P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 3A and Ta-
ble 2). The corresponding rates in the overall 
modified intention-to-treat population did not 
differ significantly (1.49 and 1.52 per year, re-
spectively) (Fig. 3B and Table 2). In METREO, 
the mean annual rate of moderate or severe ex-
acerbations was 1.19 per year in the 100-mg 
mepolizumab group and 1.27 per year in the 
300-mg mepolizumab group, as compared with 
1.49 per year in the placebo group (rate ratio 
[100 mg vs. placebo], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; 
adjusted P 
= 
0.07; rate ratio [300 mg vs. placebo], 
0.86; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.05; adjusted P 
= 
0.14) 
(Fig. 3C and Table 2). Because the results in 
METREO with regard to the primary end point 
were not significant, none of the results for sec-
ondary end points were significant, in accordance 
with the prespecified multiple-testing strategy.
Secondary End Points
In METREX, the time to the first moderate or 
severe exacerbation was significantly longer with 
mepolizumab than with placebo in the modified 
intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic 
phenotype (Kaplan–Meier median time to first 
moderate or severe exacerbation, 192 vs. 141 days; 
hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.94; adjusted 
P 
= 
0.04) but not in the overall modified inten-
tion-to-treat population (Fig. 4 and Table 2, and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). No 
significant differences between the mepolizum-
ab group and the placebo group in the annual rate 
of exacerbations leading to an emergency depart-
ment visit or hospitalization were found in either 
the intention-to-treat population with an eosino-
philic phenotype or the overall intention-to-treat 
population (Table 2).
In METREO, after adjustment for multiplicity, 
no significant benefit of mepolizumab as com-
pared with placebo was found with regard to any 
secondary end point (Table 2). The Kaplan–Meier 
median time to the first moderate or severe exac-
erbation in METREO was 267 days in the 100-mg 
mepolizumab group, 258 days in the 300-mg me-
polizumab group, and 166 days in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio [100 mg mepolizumab vs. 
placebo], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.04; adjusted 
P 
= 
0.14; hazard ratio [300 mg mepolizumab vs. 
placebo], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; adjusted 
P 
= 
0.14) (Fig. 4C and Table 2). The mean annual 
rate of exacerbations leading to an emergency 
department visit or hospitalization in the 100-
mg mepolizumab group, 0.17 per year, was not 
significantly lower than that in the placebo 
group, 0.28 per year; the rate in the 300-mg me-
polizumab group, 0.23 per year, was also not 
significantly lower than that in the placebo group 
(rate ratio [100 mg mepolizumab vs. placebo], 
0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.98; adjusted P 
= 
0.14; rate 
ratio [300 mg mepolizumab vs. placebo], 0.83; 
95% CI, 0.51 to 1.34; adjusted P 
= 
0.45) (Table 2).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
In the METREX modified intention-to-treat pop-
ulation with an eosinophilic phenotype and over-
all modified intention-to-treat population, chang-
es from baseline in measures of health-related 
quality of life (SGRQ total score and CAT scores) 
were similar between the trial groups at week 52, 
and there were no significant between-group dif-
ferences in METREO (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The proportion of pa-
tients with SGRQ and CAT score responses did 
not differ significantly between the mepolizumab 
and placebo groups in METREX or METREO 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Figure 1 (facing page). Enrollment, Randomization,  
and Follow-up in METREX.
The METREX overall modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation included patients who received at least one dose 
of mepolizumab or placebo; within this population, the 
METREX modified intention-to-treat population with 
an eosinophilic phenotype (mITT-Eos) included patients 
with an eosinophil count of at least 150 per cubic milli-
meter at screening or at least 300 per cubic millimeter 
within the previous year, and the modified intention-
to-treat population without an eosinophilic phenotype 
(mITT-nonEos) included all other patients.

Additional Analyses
A prespecified meta-analysis including data from 
the METREX modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion with an eosinophilic phenotype and the 
METREO modified intention-to-treat population 
showed lower annual rates of moderate or severe 
exacerbations in association with mepolizumab 
than with placebo; these differences were great-
er among patients with higher blood eosinophil 
count categories and thresholds at screening 
(Fig. 5, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). This analysis also showed higher annual 
exacerbation rates in association with higher 
blood eosinophil count categories at screening 
in the placebo group (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). A post hoc meta-analysis that 
included patients with blood eosinophil counts 
of 300 per cubic millimeter or higher at screen-
ing or during the previous 12 months showed 
that the mean annual rate of moderate or severe 
exacerbations was 23% lower in the 100-mg 
mepolizumab group than in the placebo group 
(rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.94) (Fig. S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the 
primary end point results. Missing data within 
these trials were limited, since patients were 
encouraged to provide data after discontinuation 
of the randomly assigned trial regimen (mepoliz-
umab or placebo). For the primary end point, 
the amount of missing data was 8% or less 
(METREX modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion with an eosinophilic phenotype: 3% of the 
scheduled years of follow-up missing in the 
mepolizumab group and 6% missing in the pla-
cebo group; METREO modified intention-to-treat 
population: 3% missing in the 100-mg mepolizu-
mab group, 5% missing in the 300-mg mepoliz-
umab group, and 8% missing in the placebo 
group). Missing-data sensitivity analyses showed 
little change in the differences in rates between 
mepolizumab and placebo that were seen with 
the primary analysis model, indicating a robust-
ness of the primary efficacy results to depar-
tures from the assumptions regarding missing

Safety
In both trials, all patients who received at least one 
dose of mepolizumab or placebo were included 
in the respective trial safety populations. The 
incidence of adverse events and serious adverse 
events was similar between the trial groups in 
METREX and METREO (Table 3). Deaths oc-
curred (either during the treatment period or after 
discontinuation of the trial regimen) in 4% of 
patients in METREX (16 of 417 patients in the 
mepolizumab group and 17 of 419 patients in the 
placebo group) and in 3% of patients in METREO 
(4 of 223 patients in the 100-mg mepolizumab 
group, 8 of 225 patients in the 300-mg mepoliz-
umab group, and 9 of 226 patients in the pla-
cebo group) (Table 3). In both trials, the most 
commonly reported adverse events that occurred 
during the treatment period were exacerbations 
or worsening of COPD, nasopharyngitis, headache, 
and pneumonia (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In METREX, systemic reactions and 
injection-site reactions occurred during the treat-
ment period in 2% and 3% of patients, respec-
tively, in the 100-mg mepolizumab group; in 
METREO, systemic reactions and injection-site re-

Mepolizumab for Eosinophilic COPD
cebo group. No neutralizing antidrug antibodies 
were found in any patient who received mepoliz-
umab in either trial. The safety profile of me-
polizumab was similar to that of placebo in 
METREO and in both the safety population with 
an eosinophilic phenotype and the safety popu-
lation without an eosinophilic phenotype in 
METREX.
Discussion
In METREX and METREO, we investigated the 
efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with COPD 
and an eosinophilic phenotype who had a his-
tory of frequent exacerbations despite receiving 
maximal guideline-recommended inhaled glu-
cocorticoid-based triple maintenance therapy. In 
METREX, mepolizumab was evaluated in pa-
tients who met our blood eosinophil criteria for 
eosinophilic COPD. In METREO, the effect of 
the higher, 300-mg dose of mepolizumab was 
assessed in patients with an eosinophilic pheno-
type. Overall, patients with an eosinophilic phe-
notype who were treated with 100 mg of mepo-
lizumab had an annual rate of moderate or 
severe exacerbations (the primary end point) that 
was consistently 18% to 20% lower than that 
among patients who received placebo. There was 
no evidence of greater effects of mepolizumab at 
higher doses. With regard to the secondary end 
points, the time to the first moderate or severe 
exacerbation was significantly longer in associa-
tion with mepolizumab than with placebo in 
METREX but not in METREO. There were no 
significant differences between mepolizumab 
and placebo with regard to the remaining sec-
ondary end points of exacerbations leading to an 
emergency department visit or hospitalization, 
SGRQ total score, and CAT score in any patient 
population in either trial. In a prespecified me-
ta-analysis involving patients from both trials, 
the effects of mepolizumab on the primary end 
point were greater among patients with higher 
blood eosinophil counts, similar to what has 
been found in severe eosinophilic asthma.12,23 
The incidence of adverse events in association 
with mepolizumab was similar to that with pla-
cebo. These findings suggest that eosinophilic 
airway inflammation contributes to COPD ex-
acerbations and that the use of mepolizumab 
directed by blood eosinophil counts might 
represent a precision-medicine approach to the 
management of COPD in selected patients who 
continue to have exacerbations despite inhaled 
glucocorticoid-based triple maintenance therapy.
These trials are important because we have 
identified a potential biomarker that may allow 
specific targeting of a subpopulation of patients 
with COPD in order to achieve a meaningful thera-
peutic effect. In METREX, we investigated the 
Figure 5. Moderate or Severe Exacerbations According to Blood Eosinophil Count Category at Screening.
Results shown are for the 100-mg mepolizumab group versus the placebo group and are from a meta-analysis of data from the METREX 
and METREO modified intention-to-treat populations. The eosinophil count category of less than 150 per cubic millimeter with no his-
torical count of 300 per cubic millimeter or higher is from the METREX modified intention-to-treat population without an eosinophilic 
phenotype. The category of less than 150 per cubic millimeter regardless of historical count included patients from the post hoc analysis 
of the METREX overall modified intention-to-treat population and the METREO modified intention-to-treat population who had evidence 
of an eosinophil count of 300 per cubic millimeter or higher in the previous year. The remaining analyses are from a prespecified meta-
analysis of data from the METREX modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype and the METREO modified 
 
intention-to-treat population.

Systemic or local site reactions were identified by means of an electronic case-report form that was designed for the collection of data on systemic reactions or local injection-site reac-
tions. There were no reports of anaphylaxis that were considered by the investigator to represent a systemic reaction meeting Sampson’s criteria for anaphylaxis. One patient in the 
METREO 300-mg mepolizumab group (modified intention-to-treat population) reported an anaphylactic reaction to diclofenac; the reaction resolved, and the patient continued the trial 
regimen.

Mepolizumab for Eosinophilic COPD
effects of mepolizumab treatment in patients with 
blood eosinophil counts of 150 per cubic millime-
ter or higher at screening or of 300 per cubic mil-
limeter or higher during the previous year, as 
well as in patients who did not meet those crite-
ria. The availability of these data, together with 
the findings from METREO, provide consider-
able power for the investigation of variables as-
sociated with treatment efficacy. Our prespecified 
meta-analysis of the primary end point according 
to blood eosinophil count category and thresh-
old at screening showed that the benefit of me-
polizumab versus placebo with regard to exacer-
bation rates was greater when blood eosinophil 
counts at screening were higher. In the placebo 
group, exacerbation rates were lowest among 
patients in the METREX modified intention-to-
treat population without an eosinophilic pheno-
type who had blood eosinophil counts of less than 
150 per cubic millimeter and had no evidence of 
historical counts of 300 per cubic millimeter or 
higher. This suggests that both naturally and 
medically induced reductions in eosinophil counts 
are associated with lower rates of exacerbations, 
particularly exacerbations that are treated with 
systemic glucocorticoids. The progressively great-
er exacerbation-related treatment responses as-
sociated with mepolizumab versus placebo, par-
ticularly at screening eosinophil counts of 300 
per cubic millimeter or higher, are similar to 
those in severe asthma and those found in a 
previous small study of benralizumab treatment 
in COPD.12,13,24 Beyond biologic therapy, the as-
sociation of blood eosinophil counts of more 
than 150 to 200 per cubic millimeter with exac-
erbation frequency and responses to glucocorti-
coids suggests that eosinophil counts may be 
used as a stratifying tool for patients with COPD 
with respect to prognosis and treatment ef-
fect.24-28 Although we have not fully character-
ized the performance characteristics of blood 
eosinophil counts as a biomarker for identifying 
patients with COPD who continue to have exac-
erbations despite already receiving maximal 
treatment, METREX and METREO provide data 
sets for the evaluation of the relationship be-
tween screening blood eosinophil counts, exac-
erbation type, and response to mepolizumab.
There were no significant improvements from 
baseline in association with mepolizumab with 
regard to lung-function end points in either tri-
al. This finding differs from those of a previous 
phase 2 trial of benralizumab, which showed a 
significantly greater improvement from baseline 
in prebronchodilator FEV1 (by approximately 
200 ml) with benralizumab than with placebo.24 
It is unknown whether the difference in outcomes 
between the current trial and the benralizumab 
trial is due to differences in the pharmacologic 
characteristics of the drugs or in the respective 
trial populations.
The rate of adverse events associated with 
mepolizumab was similar to that with placebo. 
The incidence of pneumonia in both trials was 
higher (9 to 11%) than in previous trials involv-
ing patients with COPD and a history of moder-
ate or severe exacerbations (2 to 7%),29 although 
no significant differences were observed between 
mepolizumab and placebo among patients with 
or without an eosinophilic phenotype. Inhaled 
glucocorticoids have been shown to increase the 
risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD29-31; 
therefore, the higher incidence of pneumonia may 
be due to the eligibility requirements in our tri-
als, which included a population of patients who 
had frequent exacerbations while receiving high-
dose inhaled glucocorticoids for 12 months or 
more before screening and for the duration of 
the trial.
The current trials were limited by several fac-
tors. There was the possibility of an unintended 
clinical-trial effect, as a result of increased ad-
herence to inhaled medications; such an effect is 
suggested by the strikingly different rates of mod-
erate or severe exacerbations in the year before the 
trial versus during the trial in the placebo group. 
A further limitation was that although patients 
with a current diagnosis of asthma and non-
smokers with a history of asthma were excluded, 
information on certain baseline demographic 
characteristics that might potentially be valuable 
for identifying patients who are likely to have a 
response to the treatment — such as sinus or skin 
symptoms, a diagnosis of asthma–COPD overlap, 
or allergic history — was not available, nor was a 
detailed characterization of other systemic coex-
isting conditions, such as cardiac or renal dis-
ease, which may have been useful in determin-
ing which patients would be more or less likely 
to have a response to treatment. Whether these 
characteristics provide predictive information that 
could complement a blood eosinophil–based clas-
sification requires further study. In addition, the 
specific trigger factors of each exacerbation were

not captured within these trials, and previous 
treatment with oral glucocorticoids could have 
reduced the eosinophil count at trial entry, limit-
ing the response to mepolizumab. Finally, be-
cause the number of events was small, we were 
unable to convincingly evaluate the effect of me-
polizumab on severe exacerbations or mortality.
In conclusion, among patients with COPD who 
were already receiving maximal inhaled glucocor-
ticoid–based triple inhaled maintenance therapy, 
mepolizumab resulted in lower rates of moder-
ate or severe exacerbations than placebo and in 
longer times to a first exacerbation, and the ex-
tent of these effects was related to blood eosino-
phil count. With the use of mepolizumab as a 
targeted treatment to reduce blood eosinophil 
counts, these trials show the importance of blood 
eosinophils in COPD exacerbations.
