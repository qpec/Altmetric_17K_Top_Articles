Many people identified as having common mental disorders in community surveys do not receive treatment. Modelling has suggested that clos-
ing this “treatment gap” should reduce the population prevalence of those disorders. To evaluate the effects of reducing the treatment gap
in industrialized countries, data from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed from four English-speaking countries: Australia, Canada, England and the
US. These data show that the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and symptoms has not decreased, despite substantial increases in the
provision of treatment, particularly antidepressants. Several hypotheses for this lack of improvement were considered. There was no support
for the hypothesis that reductions in prevalence due to treatment have been masked by increases in risk factors. However, there was little evi-
dence relevant to the hypothesis that improvements have been masked by increased reporting of symptoms because of greater public awareness
of common mental disorders or willingness to disclose. A more strongly supported hypothesis for the lack of improvement is that much of the
treatment provided does not meet the minimal standards of clinical practice guidelines and is not targeted optimally to those in greatest need.
Lack of attention to prevention of common mental disorders may also be a factor. Reducing the prevalence of common mental disorders
remains an unsolved challenge for health systems globally, which may require greater attention to the “quality gap” and “prevention gap”.
There is also a need for nations to monitor outcomes by using standardized measures of service provision and mental disorders over time.
Key words: Common mental disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, prevalence, antidepressants, psychological therapies, treatment gap,

(World Psychiatry 2017;16:90–99)
National surveys in a range of countries have found that
mental disorders are common and are a major source of dis-
ability1. However, many cases are untreated, even among peo-
ple with the most serious disorders. In industrialized countries,
36-50% of serious cases are untreated in the previous year,
whereas in developing countries the situation is even worse,
with 76-86% untreated. It has been proposed that treatment
services need to be expanded to reduce the prevalence and
impact of mental disorders2.
The “treatment gap” is of such concern that the 2001 World
Health Report made ten recommendations for addressing it,
including making mental health treatment more accessible in
primary care, making psychotropic drugs more available, and
increasing the training of mental health professionals3. Simula-
tion data suggested that extending the provision of evidence-
based treatment would reduce the population burden of men-
tal disorders4 and provide an economic return on investment5.
The aim of the present paper is to review evidence from
four industrialized English-speaking countries – Australia,
Canada, England (most of the UK population) and the US – on
whether increases in treatment provision have been associated
with a reduction in prevalence of common mental disorders.
These countries were chosen because they have the necessary
data, have mental health systems familiar to the authors, and
provide a suitable test of whether increasing services improves
population mental health.
The focus is on mood and anxiety disorders in adults, which
are the major source of disease burden from mental disorders.
Both diagnostic measures and symptom scale data were re-
viewed. While both lay diagnostic interviews and self-report
symptom scales are imperfect measures of these mental disor-
ders, consistency of findings across assessment methods sup-
ports conclusions about whether any changes have occurred.
Papers were identified by a search in PubMed for studies
published from 1990 to 2015 using the terms: (Australia OR
Canada OR “Great Britain” OR England OR “United Kingdom”
OR “United States”) AND (“stress, psychological” OR depres-
sion OR “depressive disorder” OR anxiety OR “anxiety disor-
der”) AND (epidemiology OR therapeutics) AND trends.
Papers were considered relevant if they covered time trends
in prevalence or treatment and were based on assessments at
more than one time point. Studies based on analyses of life-
time reports from different cohorts in the same survey were
not considered. Reports selected were supplemented by man-
ual search of references of the retrieved articles and the au-
thors’ knowledge of any grey literature from their respective
countries.
AUSTRALIA
Changes in treatment
In Australia there has been an overall substantial growth
in the resources allocated to mental health care, with total
90
World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
REAPPRAISAL
 government expenditure increasing by 178% in real terms
between 1992-1993 and 2010-20116. This change in expendi-
ture has been accompanied by a 35% increase in the per capita
mental health workforce employed by the states and territories.
Antidepressant use showed a 352% increase (in terms of
daily doses per 1,000 people per day) from 1990 to 2002, main-
ly associated with the introduction of selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors (SSRIs)7. This trend continued in the 2000s,
with a 95% increase from 2000 to 20118. By 2011, Australia had
the second highest consumption of antidepressants among 23
countries which are part of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD)9.
The availability of psychological therapies increased in 2001
and then further in 2006 with the introduction of new funding
arrangements. These programmes provided subsidies for evi-
dence-based psychological services, mainly delivered by psychol-
ogists, leading to a rapid uptake of psychological treatments. It
has been estimated that the 12-month treatment rate for mental
disorders increased from 37% in 2006-2007 to 46% in 2009-
201010. Australia has also seen rapid growth in the availability of
e-therapy since 200211.
Changes in prevalence
Australia had national mental health surveys in 1997 and
2007, both using the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI). Direct comparison of prevalences is difficult
because of differences in methodology. However, no reduction
in prevalence was observed, with 18% having an anxiety, affec-
tive or substance use disorder in 1997 compared to 20% in
20076.
Other relevant data come from national surveys that used
symptom scales. A comparison of surveys in 1995, 2003-2004
and 2011, using the 4NS scale, found no change12. Comparison
of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) data in the
1997 and 2007 national mental health surveys showed an
increase in anxiety symptoms, but no change in depressive
symptoms13. Another national health survey series showed no
change in the K10 data between 2001, 2004-2005 and 2007-
200814. There are also relevant time series data from a health
survey in the state of South Australia, which compared the
prevalence of major depression according to the Patient
Health Questionnaire in 1998, 2004 and 2008, and found a sig-
nificant increase from 7% to 10%15.
Conclusion on Australia
Australia has had increasing resources allocated to mental
health care, with an increased mental health workforce,
increased use of antidepressants and, more recently, increased
provision of psychological therapies, including e-therapy.
However, there is no evidence for any reduction in prevalence
of disorders or reduction in symptoms. If anything, trends are
in the opposite direction.
CANADA
Changes in treatment
In Canada, several national surveys have collected data on
self-reported current (past 2-day) antidepressant use. A meta-
regression analysis of survey data collected between 1994 and
2012 identified substantial increases, more than three-fold, in
the 1990s, but no change between 2002 and 201216. By 2011,
Canada ranked third among OECD countries (behind Australia
and Iceland) in antidepressant consumption9.
Another indicator of access to clinical care is the proportion
of people reporting that they have been professionally diag-
nosed with a mood or anxiety disorder. This was assessed in
three national surveys between 2003 and 2007, increasing both
in men and women in each year17. This trend has continued
up to 2014, with the percentage reporting that they had been
diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder increasing from
5.1% in 2003 to 7.5% in 201318.
Due to lack of detailed data, it is not possible to estimate the
frequency of participation in evidence-based psychotherapies
for common mental disorders in Canada. However, the propor-
tion of respondents with past-year major depression who re-
ported six or more visits to a health professional for mental
health reasons (a pattern that is at least consistent with receipt
of an evidence-based psychotherapy) increased from 27.6% to
39.5% between 2002 and 201219. When antidepressant use was
included in this definition, 52.2% of respondents received po-
tentially adequate treatment in 2012, up from 41.3% in 2002.
Changes in prevalence
A brief lay-administered interview for major depressive epi-
sodes has been consistently included in large, representative
national health surveys conducted in Canada over the past 20
years. Also, two national mental health surveys, in 2002 and
2012, used a Canadian adaptation of the CIDI. A recently re-
ported meta-regression analysis that examined estimates from
this data library (consisting of eleven national surveys) found no
change in prevalence between 1994 and 2012, the slope of the
meta-regression line over time being nearly exactly zero20.
While Canadian prevalence data are most readily available
for major depressive episodes, the same data sources have
often included the K6 scale (an abbreviated version of the K10)
for non-specific distress21. This scale may provide broader
coverage of common disorders in community populations.
There was no evidence of change over time either in the preva-
lence of elevated distress or in mean distress ratings17.
Conclusion on Canada
In Canada, there is evidence of increasing access to clinical
care and treatment with antidepressant medications. Despite
this change, there is no evidence that the prevalence of common
World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
91
 mental disorders, as reflected by the past-year occurrence of
major depressive episodes or by non-specific distress ratings,
has diminished over time.
ENGLAND
The UK has since 1948 provided universal health care free
at the point of need, funded through central taxation, which
provides an interesting opportunity to study the effects of
health care unencumbered by the barrier of cost.
In the British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (NPMS)
programme, adults living in private households were recruited
using population-based multi-phase probability sampling, and
evaluated by lay interviewers. While improvements were made in
successive surveys, the emphasis was on using identical instru-
ments wherever possible. In consequence, rates of mental disor-
ders, health service use and treatment delivery at different time
points over a 15 year period can be directly compared. Most data
are available for England, which includes the vast majority of
people living in the UK. As the 2007 survey covered only England,
current analyses are restricted to the English population in all
the surveys.
Changes in treatment
Data on trends in treatment over time have been collected by
the NPMS in 1993, 2000 and 2007, using standardized and essen-
tially unchanged methods22-26. The surveys asked respondents
directly about using treatments and consulting with profession-
als for a mental health problem over specific time periods.
There was little change in primary care physician contact
for a psychological problem over the period from 1993 to
200727. However, the receipt of antidepressants increased sig-
nificantly, nearly trebling between 1993 and 200028, following
which there was no further increase between 2000 and 200727.
Increasing hypnotic use29 and antidepressant prescribing30
has also been reported. There was limited evidence of an in-
crease in talking treatments between 1993 and 2007.
Changes in prevalence
Recent analyses of the NPMS found no clear secular trend
in the prevalence of common mental disorders in general or in
depressive episodes in particular between 1993 and 200731.
The prevalence of common mental disorders was 10.9% in
men and 18.1% in women in 1993, while it was 11.8% and
18.9%, respectively, in 2007.
Conclusion on England
England has had an increasing use of antidepressants, hyp-
notics and possibly talking treatments since 1993. However,
there is no evidence for any decrease in prevalence of disor-
ders or reduction of symptoms in adulthood. If anything,
trends are in the opposite direction.
UNITED STATES
Changes in treatment
A 2001 study by Zuvekas32 compared data from the 1987
National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) and its succes-
sor, the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) – two
representative general population surveys. The prevalence of
any mental health treatment use increased from 6.9% to 8.5%
(a 23.3% increase). The increase in use of psychiatric medica-
tions was much larger: from 3.4% to 5.6% (a 63.4% increase).
The total number of ambulatory visits increased by 29.2% in
this period, whereas the population only increased by 12.3%.
A 2005 study covered a more recent time period and
recorded a larger increase by comparing 1990-1992 data from
the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and 2001-2003 data
from the National Comorbidity Survey - Replication (NCS-
R)33. The increase in overall prevalence of treatment in adults
aged 18-54 was over 65% (from 12.2% in 1990-1992 to 20.1% in
2001-2003). The relative increase was similar when the sample
was limited to individuals who met the criteria for a DSM-IV
mental disorder based on a structured interview: from 20.3%
to 32.9%.
Other studies have examined trends in use of treatments for
specific conditions (such as depression34,35 and anxiety disor-
ders36) or specific types of treatments (such as antidepres-
sants37,38 and psychotherapy39).
Two studies based on 1987 data from NMES and 1997, 1998
and 2007 data from MEPS recorded a significant increase in
treatment for depression over the 1987 to 2007 period35,39. The
increase was more marked in the 1987-1997 period (220%
increase, from 0.73% to 2.33%) than the 1998-2007 period (22%
increase, from 2.37% to 2.88%).
Marked growth in antidepressant medication treatment
appears to have been the major driver of the increase in
depression treatment in the earlier period: 74.5% of those who
received treatment for depression in 1997 were treated with
antidepressants, compared to 37.3% in 1987. In contrast, the
use of psychotherapy for treatment of depression declined
from 71.1% to 60.2%36. Antidepressants remained the major
form of treatment in the later period, with 80.1% of individuals
treated for depression in 1998 and 81.9% in 2007 receiving
these treatments. The downward trend in the use of psycho-
therapy in treatment of depression also continued in the later
period, going from 53.6% of those treated for depression in
1998 to 43.1% in 200739.
Similar patterns of increased prevalence of treatment,
increased use of antidepressants and decreased use of psycho-
therapy were observed for anxiety disorders36.

World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
 Changes in prevalence
Few studies have examined trends in prevalence of com-
mon mental disorders in the US, mainly because assessments
and diagnostic criteria used in mental health surveys of gener-
al population have changed over the years, making compari-
sons difficult if not impossible. Yet, there is no evidence from
available studies that the prevalence of these disorders has
declined over the past two or three decades33,40.
Indeed, one study based on two large national surveys found
a more than two-fold increase in the prevalence of major depres-
sive episodes between 1991 and 200241. Another study based on
consecutive waves of National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) also found increases in depressive symptoms
over the 2005-2010 period42. Other studies based on 1991-1992
NCS and 2001-2003 NCS-R data found essentially similar preva-
lence estimates of major depression and other common mental
disorders in this period33,40. A more recent study did not find evi-
dence of any significant decrease in 12-month prevalence of
major depressive episodes or psychological distress in the years
since 200143.
Conclusion on the United States
Virtually all studies that have examined trends in use of
mental health treatments in the US have recorded an increas-
ing trend since early 1990s. The increase was sharpest between
early 1990s and early 2000s and more marked for antidepres-
sant medication treatment, especially SSRIs.
However, there is no evidence for any corresponding reduc-
tion in prevalence of mental disorders or psychological dis-
tress among US adults in this same period. Some evidence
even points to possible increases in prevalence of depression
and in disability due to mental health problems44.
HAS A REDUCTION IN PREVALENCE BEEN MASKED?
We now consider the possibility that treatment has really
had a population impact, but this effect is difficult to detect.
Two hypotheses are considered: masking by changes in risk
factors and masking by increased awareness or willingness to
report symptoms.
Masking by changes in risk factors
It is possible that there has been an increase in exposure to
risk factors that has masked any decrease in prevalence of
common mental disorders due to increased treatment.
Australia
Australia has been affected by a number of natural disasters
over the period, particularly drought, floods and fires, but these
have been regional and time limited and unlikely to have had
a national impact. There have been no major economic
changes that could plausibly drive prevalence up. The global
financial crisis, for example, has had a limited impact on Aus-
tralia. Comparison of exposure to specific traumatic events in
1997 and 2007 showed no change45.
Changes in physical health are also unlikely to have masked
changes in mental health. Physical health has overall improved,
with increased life expectancy, more years free of disability and
slightly improved self-rated health46. However, some health
problems, in particular obesity and diabetes, have increased.
Canada
During the past two decades, parts of Canada have been
affected by natural disasters such as ice storms, forest fires and
floods. However, these have been regional events. There were no
natural disasters affecting the national population. The global
financial crisis has had a relatively limited impact in Canada.
England
In common with many high-income economies, the UK
experienced a major recession beginning in 2007. Cuts in most
public services (but not in health care) began in 2010 and con-
tinue. Unemployment rates rose, but have declined since. The
most recent comparable data from the NPMS were collected
in 2007. Further data will be available in 2016 (following a peri-
od of slight economic growth).
No major disasters, conflicts or other changes have occurred
throughout England that could plausibly drive prevalence up
since the NPMS data collection began in 1993.
United States
The US population has experienced a number of major
social and economic stressors over the past two decades, rang-
ing from terrorist attacks to economic recession and hurri-
canes, impacting large portions of the population. Although
the short-term mental health impact of these events on spe-
cific population groups or specific outcomes has been stud-
ied47-49, their overall and long-term impact on the prevalence
of mental disorders and psychological distress is not clear.
A study covering the periods before and after the 2008 eco-
nomic downturn did not detect any clear effects on mental
health of the US population43. There is also little evidence that
the physical health of the US adults has declined over this
period, as evidenced by a decrease in all-cause mortality
across virtually all age groups50.
Masking by increased awareness or reporting of
symptoms
The measures used to monitor prevalence involve self-
report of symptoms or lay diagnostic interviews. If public
World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
93
 awareness of common mental disorders or willingness to dis-
close symptoms increased over time, this might lead to an
artefactual increase in reporting.
Australia
There is evidence that Australians have become more open
about mental health problems. Between 1995 and 2011, there
was an increase in the percentage of adults who reported hav-
ing had a problem similar to a depressed person described in a
vignette51. There was also an increase in the percentage who
reported knowing a family member or friend who had a simi-
lar problem.
Associated with this increase, Australian adults have shown
improvements in the ability to give psychiatric labels to
vignettes52 and a reduction in the belief that depression is due
to weakness of character53. While there is no evidence linking
these changes to prevalence rates, it is possible that the public
has become more willing to report symptoms.
Canada
While studies of mental health literacy2 and perceived stig-
ma54 have been conducted in Canada, repeated measure-
ments over time have not been made. Therefore, temporal
trends cannot be evaluated.
While there have been no changes in symptom-based mea-
sures of mental health, there has been a slight increase in the
proportion of Canadians reporting that their mental health is
merely fair or poor55. If this trend reflects an increasing will-
ingness to disclose mental health concerns, then the sensitivi-
ty of instruments such as structured diagnostic interviews or
the K6 scale may be increasing over time, which would lead to
larger prevalence estimates. Speculatively, such an effect could
offset gains that might otherwise result from better delivery of
treatment.
England
Response rates for the household NPMS were 79% in 1993,
69% in 2000, and 57% in 2007, which is in line with international
trends. The paper-and-pencil questionnaires used in 1993 were
replaced by computer assisted interviewing in subsequent sur-
veys; this is not thought to affect the results substantially56. Will-
ingness to report symptoms has not been specifically assessed in
the UK survey programme. The absence of significant change in
responses to identically worded questions on symptoms argues
against such a change.
The increased use of treatments by men between 1993 and
2000 might suggest some change in attitudes or self-perception,
but no further such change was seen between 2000 and 2007.
There has been an increased focus in other research on exam-
ining the effects of stigma, for example on the under-use of
treatments57, which has not yielded information on trends
over time.
United States
Little research has focused on any possible changes in
Americans’ willingness to disclose mental health problems.
One study, recording increased reports of “impending nervous
breakdown” among the US general population between 1957
and 1996, concluded that the change could be due either to an
increase in psychological problems, or a decrease in the stig-
ma associated with admitting that one is going to have a ner-
vous breakdown, or both58. Other studies indicate that younger
adults were more willing to disclose mental health problems and
to seek professional help in more recent years59. Yet, it remains
unclear whether people who participated in more recent surveys
were more likely than those who participated in earlier years to
identify their psychological distress as indicative of a mental
health problem.
A recent study found that middle-aged and older Americans
tend to rate themselves and cases presented in standard
vignettes as more depressed than their European counter-
parts60. When the self-ratings were adjusted for vignette rat-
ings, American participants were not more depressed than the
Europeans. While this finding highlights the importance of
expectations and norms in labeling one’s mental status, it is
not clear if the expectations and norms of American adults
regarding their mental health have changed over time.
WHY HAS PREVALENCE NOT DECREASED?
Given that prevalence has not shown the expected decrease,
we next discuss possible reasons. Two possibilities are exam-
ined: that the quality of treatment is too poor to affect preva-
lence or is too poorly targeted, and that too little has been
done to reduce incidence through prevention.
Is treatment of poor quality or poorly targeted?
Australia
In Australia, there is evidence that treatments provided are
often not consistent with clinical practice guidelines. It has
been estimated that 39% of cases of mood or anxiety disorders
sought professional help, 26% received an evidence-based
intervention, and 16% received minimally adequate treat-
ment61. There is also evidence that only 50% of people pre-
scribed antidepressants receive them for at least six months as
recommended in clinical guidelines62. Similarly, while the per-
ceived needs of service users were better met in 2007 than in
1997, most of the gains were in partially met rather than fully
met needs, suggesting that quality of services may still be
lacking63.
There have been specific questions raised about the use of
antidepressants. It has been noted that the age distribution
of antidepressant use aligns poorly with the age distribution of
94
World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
 mood and anxiety disorders, with antidepressants more likely
to be prescribed to older people, among whom prevalence is
lower64. There are also data showing that general practitioners,
who are the major prescribers, use antidepressants to treat
“chronic mild depression”, whereas the evidence indicates
that these drugs are more appropriate for severe disorders65.
The use of antidepressants for milder cases is also inconsistent
with clinical guidelines that recommend psychological thera-
pies as the first line of treatment61.
Canada
A survey conducted in the province of Alberta in 2005 and
2006 found that only 40.5% of those with major depression
were taking an antidepressant. The frequency was 28.5% in
those with anxiety disorders. Among those with major depres-
sion, only 14.3% reported receiving psychotherapy as a treat-
ment66.
In the Alberta survey, 67.2% of those who reported taking
antidepressants had no active mood or anxiety disorder diag-
nosis at the time of the survey. However, some of these
respondents may have had successful outcomes, such that
they no longer met diagnostic criteria at the time of the inter-
view. They may have been taking medications to safeguard a
remission rather than for acute treatment. In this particular
survey, 81% of those taking antidepressants reported doing so
for more than one year.
In the most recent national mental health survey (which
was conducted in 2012), 85% of respondents with past year
major depressive episodes reported a perceived need for men-
tal health care, 63% reported that they had actually seen a
health professional about their mental health and only 58% of
these reported that their health care needs were completely
met67. These results suggest that there is much progress to be
made in the timeliness and quality of treatment, factors that
affect the impact of treatment on population health.
England
Adherence to guidelines has not been a specific focus of the
UK survey programme, in part because surveys do not provide
an opportunity to evaluate practice at a sufficiently detailed
level. Furthermore, guidelines are updated periodically, mak-
ing checks on adherence over time more problematic. Thresh-
olds for diagnosis by primary care physicians have become
progressively lower22, but whether this is a good development
depends on how such cases are managed. Two studies show-
ing trends in primary care physician assessments away from
diagnosis of depression and of anxiety disorder towards diag-
nosing symptoms of depression and of anxiety could reflect
reduced quality of care, possibly related to increased demand
pressures on physicians68,69.
Note has been taken of the increasing use of antidepres-
sants by adults not currently depressed28, but this could indi-
cate either inappropriate over-diagnosis and over-prescribing
or it could be a positive indicator that antidepressant treatments
are not being withdrawn too quickly following remission.
United States
A large and growing body of evidence points to the poor
quality of mental health treatments as offered in usual care
settings in the US70-78. Many patients who start treatment for
common mental disorders drop out before they could experi-
ence the full benefit of treatment73. Indeed, prevalence of
“minimally adequate” treatment is often much lower than the
prevalence of treatment contacts overall. In one study, less
than 40% of the participants who reported having received any
mental health treatment for a serious mental illness were rated
as having received minimally adequate treatment75. This
means that the current prevalence estimates of mental health
treatments based on population surveys greatly exaggerate the
prevalence of effective treatments received.
While there is little data on trends in quality of mental
health treatments nationally, there is some evidence that the
mix and nature of treatments has changed over time34-36. For
example, over the 1987 to 2007 period, the proportion of
patients treated for depression who received any psychothera-
py or psychotherapy in conjunction with medication treat-
ment declined greatly35,39.
Furthermore, a large number of people who do not clearly
meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder routinely use
mental health treatments in the US. Between 1990 and 2003,
the increase in the prevalence of treatments in the past year
was slightly larger among adults who did not meet the criteria
for any 12-month mental disorder than those who met these
criteria (65% vs. 62%)33.
Other data indicate that, among adults treated with antide-
pressants, the proportion of those who met the criteria for a
12-month mental illness declined during the 1990s and later
years79,80. Of course, many of those who did not meet the cri-
teria for mental disorder in the past 12 months had met the
criteria before that time and were in remission or in partial
remission81. Treatment may be clinically justified in this group
to prevent relapse. Others may be suffering from subthreshold
symptoms or mild disorders, and treatments may reduce the
risk of future severe illness or chronicity40.
Is more emphasis needed on prevention?
Prevalence is a function of incidence and duration, with treat-
ment services primarily focused on reducing duration82. It is pos-
sible that reducing prevalence requires greater emphasis on
reduction of incidence through prevention approaches.
Australia
While difficult to quantify, the resources allocated to preven-
tion have been very small compared to those for treatment83.
World Psychiatry 16:1 - February 2017
95
 The 2014 National Review of Mental Health Programmes and
Services recommended greater emphasis on prevention, but this
remains to be implemented84.
Canada
Canada’s first national mental health strategy was published
in 2012 and referred prominently to mental health promotion
and prevention as key actions85. In particular, school-based
programmes were emphasized, drawing upon the observation
that common mental disorders often manifest for the first
time during childhood. However, implementation of preven-
tive interventions has not been documented either in terms of
its extent or effectiveness.
England
Evidence-based depression prevention programmes for adults
are not funded in the UK. Responsibility and a small budget for
what is termed mental health promotion has now been trans-
ferred from national to local government. Funding targeted on
the research priority of prevention of mental disorders has only
just begun in 2015, with non-health care settings being the pre-
ferred location for proposed studies.
Sure Start Centres to support disadvantaged young families
were established from 1997 onwards, but are now gradually
losing funding. It is too soon to be able to say what, if any,
long-term benefits might accrue for conditions like depression
that mainly begin to become common from puberty onwards.
United States
A 2009 report by the US Institute of Medicine called on the
nation to make prevention of mental and behavioural disor-
ders a priority86.
While various agencies across the country have imple-
mented programmes aimed at prevention of mental and
behavioural health problems, including school and college
programmes sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration87, these efforts remain dis-
jointed and do not amount to a national strategy.
CONCLUSIONS
Common mental disorders remain a major source of dis-
ability globally. According to the Global Burden of Disease
2013 study, major depression ranks second and anxiety disor-
ders rank ninth88 among all non-communicable diseases. This
disability burden did not change substantially over the period
1990-2013, with age-standardized years lived with disability
estimated to have increased by 4.7% (95% uncertainty: 2.7 to
6.7) for major depression and to have decreased by 0.2% (95%
uncertainty: 21.6 to 1.3) for anxiety disorders. Similarly, age-
standardized prevalence was estimated to have increased by
4.2% (95% uncertainty: 2.4 to 6.2) for major depression and to
have decreased by 0.5% (95% uncertainty: 21.7 to 0.8) for anx-
iety disorders88, consistent with a meta-analysis of prevalence
studies over the period89.
The four countries examined here provide a test of the
capacity of current treatment approaches to reduce prevalence
of common mental disorders. All four countries have had
increases in rates of treatment for these disorders since the
1990s. This has been consistently seen for use of antidepres-
sants, with large increases in all countries. For psychological
therapies, there has been more variability, with increases in
Australia and possibly England, decreases in the US and no
evidence available in Canada. Despite these changes, none of
the four countries had any evidence for a reduction in preva-
lence of disorders or symptoms over the period. If anything,
there were indications of changes in the opposite direction in
Australia, England and the US.
In pointing out that there have not been population mental
health gains, we are not suggesting that pharmacological and
psychological treatments for common mental disorders do not
work. There is abundant evidence from systematic reviews of
randomized controlled trials that they do. Rather, this review
indicates that there may have been problems of implementa-
tion or other factors that may have counteracted their impact.
Furthermore, this review is concerned with the situation in
high-income countries. We do not know what the impact of
increasing availability of treatment would be in low- and
middle-income countries.
Considering the various hypotheses to account for a lack of
improvement, we found no support for a masking of a
decrease in prevalence due to treatment by an increased expo-
sure to risk factors. We also examined the hypothesis that peo-
ple have become more aware of common mental disorders or
willing to report symptoms in surveys, but found little relevant
evidence. This is an area that requires further work, perhaps
using clinician-based measures or psychometric techniques for
assessing item and test bias.
We considered two possible explanations for a real lack of
improvement. Firstly, we examined whether treatment might
be of poor quality or might not be well targeted. In Australia,
Canada and the US, there was evidence that treatment was fre-
quently not of an adequate standard, as indicated by short
duration and continuing unmet need. England lacked relevant
data. There were also data from Australia, England and the US
that treatment is often received by people who do not meet
criteria for a diagnosis, although in some cases this may be
appropriate, for example to prevent relapse.
Secondly, we examined whether there has been too little
emphasis on reducing incidence through prevention. There is
evidence from randomized controlled trials that psychological
interventions can have preventive effects in both young people
and adults90,91, and that these can be cost-effective92. There is also
considerable potential for prevention through risk factor modifi-
cation, including parenting behaviours, school environments,
workplace conditions, diet and lifestyle behaviours93. Social

 determinants such as poverty and unemployment are also
important for mental health94. In all four countries, prevention is
receiving piecemeal efforts, with no country having a coordinat-
ed national approach, despite calls to do so in several of them.
Despite the remarkable consistency in trends across the four
countries, there are a number of limitations in the available data
that need to be considered. Survey methodologies, diagnostic cri-
teria and response rates have varied over time within countries,
limiting the comparisons that can be made. The data available
come from lay diagnostic interviews or self-report symptom
questionnaires rather than the gold standard of standardized
clinical instruments. There are also limited data available on
some issues, including whether there have been changes in
awareness of common mental disorders or willingness to report
symptoms in surveys in all four countries, use of psychological
therapies in Canada, and quality of treatment in England. Fur-
thermore, the timing of data points for changes in services does
not always match that for changes in prevalence (e.g., the largest
increases in use of psychological therapies in Australia have
occurred after the most recent national survey of prevalence).
Efforts to reduce the burden of disease due to common
mental disorders have emphasized the importance of reducing
the “treatment gap”. Modelling of the impact of reducing this
gap indicated that this approach would produce measurable
reductions in disease4. However, it now appears that this
modelling was optimistic. The present analysis suggests that,
in order to reduce the prevalence of common mental disor-
ders, we may also need to reduce a “quality gap”95. This gap
has two components: providing treatments that meet the min-
imal standards of clinical practice guidelines, and targeting
treatments optimally to those in greatest need. There may also
be a “prevention gap”, where resource allocation to reducing
incidence through prevention has lagged efforts to reduce
duration of disorders through treatment. However, if preven-
tion is to have an impact, it needs to also be rigorously evi-
dence based and implemented to a high standard, so that it
does not end up having its own quality gap.
In order to properly evaluate the future impact of closing
these gaps, nations need to use standardized measures of service
provision and mental disorders over time. There would be merit
in future work attempting to quantify changes in services and
prevalence of mental disorders across countries using meta-
analytic techniques, as have been applied in Canada16,20.
