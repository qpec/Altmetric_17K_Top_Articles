During adolescence, internal circadian rhythms and biological sleep drive change to result in later sleep and wake times. As a result of these changes, early 
middle school and high school start times curtail sleep, hamper a student’s preparedness to learn, negatively impact physical and mental health, and impair 
driving safety. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence shows that delaying school start times positively impacts student achievement, health, and safety. 
Public awareness of the hazards of early school start times and the benefits of later start times are largely unappreciated. As a result, the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine is calling on communities, school boards, and educational institutions to implement start times of 8:30 am or later for middle schools and 
high schools to ensure that every student arrives at school healthy, awake, alert, and ready to learn.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) is the 
leading professional society dedicated to the promotion of sleep 
health. As the leading voice in the sleep field, the AASM im-
proves sleep health and promotes high-quality, patient-centered 
care through advocacy, education, strategic research, and prac-
tice standards. The AASM has a combined membership of more 
than 10,000 accredited member sleep centers and individual 
members, including physicians, scientists, and other health care 
professionals, many of whom are involved in higher education. 
The AASM is dedicated to advancing sleep health policy to im-
prove the health and well-being of the general public.
POSITION
The AASM asserts that middle school and high school start 
times should be 8:30 am or later to support:
• An adequate opportunity for adolescents to obtain 
sufficient sleep on school nights
• Optimal alertness in the classroom environment to 
facilitate peak academic performance
• Reduced tardiness and school absences to foster 
improved opportunities for learning

• Adolescent mental health and psychological well-being
• Adolescent driving safety
DISCUSSION
As children progress into their teenage years, they experience 
delayed patterns of melatonin secretion and a slower build-
up of homeostatic sleep pressure during wakefulness.1 These 
changes reflect a delayed circadian rhythm that contributes to 
later sleep onset and later morning awakening, with teenagers 
typically struggling to fall asleep before 11:00 pm.2 The AASM 
recommends that teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 
8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote op-
timal health, and this recommendation has been endorsed by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, Sleep Research Society, 
and American Association of Sleep Technologists.3–6 Because 
sleep onset is not instantaneous, and it is normal to spend some 
time awake in bed during the sleep period, a teenager who 
goes to bed at 11:00 pm would need to sleep until 7:30 am or 
later in order to obtain sufficient sleep. Early middle school 
and high school start times work contrary to this change in 
adolescent circadian physiology and truncate students’ sleep

opportunity, resulting in chronic sleep loss.7 Presently, 68.4% 
of United States high school students sleep 7 hours or less on 
school nights, while only 23.2% sleep 8 hours, 6.0% sleep 9 
hours, and 2.4% sleep 10 hours or more.8
Short sleep in adolescents is associated with poor school per-
formance, obesity, metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular 
morbidity, increased depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, 
risk-taking behaviors, athletic injuries, and increased motor 
vehicle accident risk.9–17 Increased motor vehicle accident risk 
is particularly concerning because young, novice drivers have 
a higher crash risk when sleep deprived, and motor vehicle 
crashes account for 35% of all deaths and 73% of deaths from 
unintentional injury in teenagers.18–20
Importantly, a delay in school start time has beneficial im-
pacts on teenage students. Studies show that implementation 
of later school start times for adolescents is associated with 
longer total sleep time, reduced daytime sleepiness, increased 
engagement in classroom activities, and reduced first-hour 
tardiness and absences.7,21–23 Delayed school start times also 
are associated with reduced depressive symptoms and irrita-
bility.21,22 Reaction time improves, and crash rates decline by 
16.5%, following a school start time delay of 60 minutes.12,13 
Extension of sleep time also facilitates behavioral weight loss 
interventions in adolescents.24 
While an operational change in school start times does not 
automatically assure longer sleep durations, this change, cou-
pled with inclusion of relevant and targeted educational ma-
terials regarding the importance of sleep into middle school 
and high school curricula, will help motivate students, teach-
ers, and parents to prioritize sleep and implement healthy sleep 
practices. This includes a cool, dark, quiet sleep environment; 
adequate time for 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night; consistent 
bedtimes and wake times on weekdays and weekends; a reg-
ular bedtime routine to cue the body that sleep is imminent; 
and morning light exposure. Furthermore, the use of sleep-
disrupting electronic devices near bedtime or during the night 
should be avoided, because light emitted from electronic de-
vices, particularly blue wavelengths, can suppress the produc-
tion of melatonin and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.25 
These practices will benefit the student regardless of school 
start time.
The compelling rationale for delayed school start times 
must be conveyed to all stakeholders including students, fami-
lies, teachers, school administrators, school boards, athletic 
directors, coaches, and transportation workers. These efforts 
should focus on the importance of sleep for health, safety, per-
formance, and student well-being in order to maximize the 
desired effect of helping adolescents get the sleep they need. 
Middle school and high school administrators also need to 
understand the importance of preventing extracurricular ac-
tivities, including team practices and workouts, from being 
scheduled before 8:30 am.
Although adequate sleep duration is necessary, it alone is in-
sufficient to ensure optimal student performance. Good sleep 
quality, appropriate timing and regularity of sleep, and the ef-
fective treatment of sleep disorders also are essential. Parents 
of students who are experiencing extreme difficulty awaken-
ing to arrive at school on time, or who experience significant 
daytime sleepiness, should consider scheduling a consultation 
with the adolescent’s primary care provider or a sleep medicine 
specialist to evaluate for a sleep disorder, regardless of the stu-
dent’s school start time.
CONCLUSIONS
Every middle school and high school student deserves the op-
portunity to start school awake, alert, and ready to learn. The 
benefits of later school start times have gained attention in re-
cent years in the eyes of the public, school boards, educators, 
researchers, and physician organizations.26 However, there 
are substantial gaps between published scientific knowledge 
and public awareness of the untoward consequences of early 
start times and, conversely, the important benefits of later start 
times. Based on the available evidence, the AASM calls on 
primary academic institutions, school boards, parents, and 
policy makers to raise public awareness and improve educa-
tion in order to promote a national standard of middle school 
and high school start times of 8:30 am or later. The AASM also 
encourages a collaborative and participatory approach among 
all stakeholders to support school boards as they overcome a 
variety of real and perceived barriers to the implementation of 
delayed school start times.
