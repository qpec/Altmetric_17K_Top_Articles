The gut microbiota regulates T cell functions throughout the body. We
hypothesized that intestinal bacteria impact the pathogenesis of
multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder of the CNS and thus
analyzed the microbiomes of 71 MS patients not undergoing treatment
and 71 healthy controls. Although no major shifts in microbial
community structure were found, we identified specific bacterial taxa
that were significantly associated with MS. Akkermansia muciniphila
and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, both increased in MS patients, induced
proinflammatory responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and in monocolonized mice. In contrast, Parabacteroides distaso-
nis, which was reduced in MS patients, stimulated antiinflammatory
IL-10–expressing human CD4+CD25+ T cells and IL-10+FoxP3+ Tregs in
mice. Finally, microbiota transplants from MS patients into germ-free
mice resulted in more severe symptoms of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis and reduced proportions of IL-10+ Tregs compared
with mice “humanized” with microbiota from healthy controls. This
study identifies specific human gut bacteria that regulate adaptive
autoimmune responses, suggesting therapeutic targeting of the micro-
biota as a treatment for MS.
multiple sclerosis | microbiome | autoimmunity
A
major role of the human gut microbiota is to regulate both
innate and adaptive immune responses during health and
disease (1). Most studies of the human microbiome to date have
focused on analyzing microbial population structures. However,
it is equally important to investigate how variability in microbial
abundance and composition affects host functions (2, 3). Ex-
posing primary human immune cells to microbes or microbial
products in vitro allows functional investigation of immuno-
modulatory effects by the gut microbiota (4–6).
There is growing evidence of population differences in the gut
microbiota in multiple human autoimmune diseases (7, 8), including
multiple sclerosis (MS) (9–12). While these studies in MS were
performed with small sample sizes and did not stratify patient groups
by treatment with disease-modifying drugs, consistent patterns of
modest dysbiosis appear to be emerging. Furthermore, microbiota
have been shown to mediate the regulation of immune responses in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
model of MS (13, 14). MS-like symptoms in EAE can be exacer-
bated by Th1 and Th17 responses and modulated by Tregs (15, 16).
This led us to investigate structural and functional changes in
intestinal microbiota as a potential component of MS pathogenesis.
Specifically, we identified differences in microbial abundance be-
tween MS patients and controls and investigated how particular
MS-associated bacteria modulate T lymphocyte responses using
both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Our results indicate that
differences in specific gut bacteria are functionally associated with a
shift toward a proinflammatory T cell profile that may exacerbate or
perpetuate autoimmune responses, thus potentially identifying a
previously unknown environmental contributor to MS pathogenesis.
Results
The MS Microbiome Elicits Differential Treg Responses and Shows
Modest Dysbiosis at the Genus Level. To investigate whether MS-
associated bacteria affect immune functions in the host, we stimu-
lated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MS pa-
tients or healthy controls, using extracts from total bacteria isolated
from the stool samples of the same subjects who were PBMC do-
nors (thus, “self” bacterial extracts). We observed that PBMCs from
MS patients showed an impaired ability to differentiate or expand
CD25+FoxP3+ Treg populations (Fig. 1A). The total CD3+CD4+
Th lymphocyte population was not altered by bacterial extract
treatment, and the baseline proportion of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs (in
a population of CD3+CD4+ T cells) was not different between MS
patients and healthy controls. These results suggest a specific im-
munoregulatory role of microbiota on PBMCs from MS patients.
We subsequently analyzed the microbiome by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing of stool samples from 71 untreated relapsing–remitting
Significance
We have experimentally investigated the immunoregulatory
effects of human gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis (MS). We
have identified specific bacteria that are associated with MS
and demonstrated that these bacteria regulate T lymphocyte-
mediated adaptive immune responses and contribute to the
proinflammatory environment in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our
results expand the knowledge of the microbial regulation of
immunity and may provide a basis for the development of
microbiome-based therapeutics in autoimmune diseases.

 MS patients and 71 healthy controls (SI Appendix, Table S1). A
subset of 79 subjects was sampled on two consecutive days to account
for variability over time, and all subjects were used to compare the
variability within and between subject groups (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
Consistent with similar findings in other autoimmune diseases (7, 8),
we did not observe major global shifts in bacterial community
structure in terms of alpha or beta diversity (Fig. 1 B and C). How-
ever, significant differences at the level of individual microbial taxa
were observed between MS and control subjects (Figs. 1D and 2).
Our analysis revealed significant differences in the relative abun-
dance of 25 bacterial genera (19.38% of the total) (listed in SI Ap-
pendix, Table S2) and 247 operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
(16.89% of the total) (listed in SI Appendix, Table S3) (Fig. 2 A and B).
We then selected individual significantly different taxa for
functional studies to assess their potential contribution to auto-
immune inflammation in MS. The specific taxa were selected
based on the following criteria: (i) identifiable to species level or
genus level with high overlap between species; (ii) culturable, to be
able to study their functions in vitro and in vivo; (iii) type strains
available from the ATCC to ensure reproducibility; and (iv) pre-
viously associated with immunoregulatory effects.
Among the genera significantly increased in MS samples were
Acinetobacter and Akkermansia, while one of the most significantly
reduced genera in MS patients was Parabacteroides, with the ma-
jority of OTUs mapping to Parabacteroides distasonis (Fig. 2C and
SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Interestingly, P. distasonis was previously
reported to induce a Treg phenotype in gnotobiotic mouse models
(17, 18). All Acinetobacter species, including Acinetobacter bau-
mannii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Acinetobacter lwoffii, are
rare in the healthy human gut microbiome and share genome-wide
homology (19, 20), making them indistinguishable by 16S amplicon
sequencing. Thus, OTUs that mapped to the genus Acinetobacter
did not allow species-level discrimination. Based on a previous
report associating A. calcoaceticus with MS (21), we focused on this
organism as a candidate for functional studies of immune regula-
tion. Finally, all OTUs that mapped to the Akkermansia genus
belonged to the species Akkermansia muciniphila, which has been
studied mostly in the context of metabolism (22) but also contrib-
utes to inflammation during infection (12, 23).
MS-Associated Bacterial Species Reduce Tregs and Increase Th1
Lymphocyte Differentiation in Vitro. We hypothesized that bacte-
rial taxa altered in MS patients play functional roles in regulating
immune responses. To test this hypothesis, we established an
in vitro model system by exposing PBMCs from healthy donors
to a suspension of heat-killed and sonicated individual bacterial
cultures (“bacterial extracts”) under different stimulating con-
ditions (e.g., Treg, Th1, and so forth) and used flow cytometry to
evaluate T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation. We
observed that extracts from A. calcoaceticus reduced the pro-
portions of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs among PBMCs (Fig. 3 A and
B). These results suggest that intestinal A. calcoaceticus restrains
immunoregulatory T cell development, as is consistent with its
relative increase in the MS cohort. Furthermore, we observed
that A. calcoaceticus increased the proportion of effector CD4+

 lymphocytes that differentiated into IFNγ-producing Th1 cells
(Fig. 3 C and D), thereby potentially exacerbating inflammation.
Analysis of A. muciniphila, another bacterial species increased in the
MS microbiome, revealed an even more pronounced effect on stim-
ulating Th1 differentiation. Extracts from A. muciniphila significantly
increased healthy donor PBMC differentiation into Th1 lymphocytes
(Fig. 4 A–D). Furthermore, we discovered that the mere presence of
A. muciniphila in total stool bacteria was sufficient to increase Th1
lymphocyte differentiation in vitro. Specifically, exposing PBMCs to
total bacterial extracts isolated from unrelated subjects with detectable
levels of A. muciniphila increased the differentiation of IFNγ+ Th1
lymphocytes compared with bacterial extracts that did not have A.
muciniphila (Fig. 4 E and G). Similarly, subjects with detectable A.
muciniphila showed a significant increase in IFNγ+ Th1 differentiation
in response to extracts of their own bacteria (Fig. 4 F and H). In
summary, we have identified A. muciniphila and A. calcoaceticus as
examples of common and rare MS-associated bacterial species that
favor proinflammatory T lymphocyte responses in vitro.
We next explored whether individual taxa that are less abundant
in MS patients could promote immunoregulatory responses. Ex-
posing healthy donor PBMCs to extracts from P. distasonis signifi-
cantly increased the percentage of CD25+ T lymphocytes among the
CD3+CD4+ T cell population (Fig. 5 A and B). Furthermore, we
observed an enrichment of CD25+IL-10+ cells (Fig. 5 C and D),
including CD25+IL-10+FoxP3− Tr1 cells (but not CD25+FoxP3+
Tregs), which have been associated with strong immunoregulatory
properties (14, 24). Thus, our results demonstrate that P. distasonis is
sufficient to skew T lymphocytes toward a regulatory profile in vitro.
All immunoregulatory effects described here were at least partially
specific to selected bacterial extracts. To show that exposure to any
differentially abundant bacteria did not elicit similar effects, we an-
alyzed the immune effects of Eggerthella lenta, which is significantly
increased in MS patients, and found that it did not alter Th1 or Treg
differentiation (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). In addition, the
specificity of P. distasonis, A. calcoaceticus, and A. muciniphila func-
tions is emphasized by the fact that these bacteria did not alter the
differentiation of all lymphocyte populations indiscriminately; for
example, P. distasonis had no effect on Th1 cells, and A. muciniphila
had no effect on CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 C–E).
While regulation of immune functions by gut microbiota are
likely multifaceted and complex, we speculate that the observed
P. distasonis-associated reduction in immunoregulatory T cells
could act in concert with the described increases in A. calcoa-
ceticus and A. muciniphila and contribute to create an overall
proinflammatory environment in MS patients.
Colonization of Mice with Single Species of MS-Associated Bacteria
Recapitulates in Vitro T Lymphocyte Differentiation Profiles. To eluci-
date the role of individual MS-associated bacteria in vivo, we col-
onized antibiotic-treated or germ-free (GF) mice with a single
species: A. calcoaceticus, A. muciniphila, or P. distasonis. Following
colonization, we measured T lymphocyte differentiation in multiple
peripheral lymphoid tissues. We were unable to observe an effect of
A. muciniphila in monocolonized mice as described in our in vitro
experiments, and we hypothesize that this discrepancy is likely due
to differences in host (e.g., mice vs. human). However, we were able
to replicate our key findings with the other two species analyzed.
In antibiotic-treated mice A. calcoaceticus inhibited FoxP3+
Treg differentiation, while P. distasonis stimulated CD4+IL-10+

 lymphocyte differentiation (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Fur-
thermore, splenocytes from mice colonized with P. distasonis also
displayed induction of CD4+IL10+ lymphocytes in response to
their bacterial extracts, while this was not observed when sple-
nocytes from control SPF mice were exposed to their own bac-
terial extracts (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C).
Furthermore, monocolonization of GF mice with A. calcoaceticus
increased T lymphocyte differentiation into the IFNγ+ Th1 phenotype
in cervical lymph nodes (Fig. 6 A and B), while monocolonization with
P. distasonis led to significant increases in the CD4+IL-10+ T lym-
phocyte population in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens (Fig. 6C
and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Taken together, the in vivo mono-
colonization results form a consistent complement to our in vitro data.
Colonization of Mice with MS Donor Microbiota Inhibits Treg
Differentiation and Exacerbates Disease Severity in EAE. To in-
vestigate whether the proinflammatory environment established
by MS-associated bacteria is physiologically relevant, we randomly
selected three MS and control donor pairs (each composed of an
untreated relapsing–remitting MS patient and a household control)
to perform fecal microbiota transplants into groups of GF C57BL/6
mice (n = 6–8 mice per group). Six weeks after transplantation,
mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG35–55) to induce EAE. Remarkably, EAE disease scores were
significantly increased in mice colonized with microbiota from MS
patients compared with animals colonized with microbiota from
healthy controls or GF mice (Fig. 7A). This result was recapitulated
across all three donor pairs tested (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) and was
accompanied by a lack of IL-10+ Treg induction in mesenteric
lymph nodes from MS microbiota-colonized mice (Fig. 7 C–F and
SI Appendix, Fig. S7). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed
on spinal cord samples derived from GF mice humanized with MS
(n = 11) or control (n = 9) microbiota before and after EAE in-
duction. Analysis of transcripts with differential expression in the
two groups before and after EAE identified the up-regulation of
several genes identified as the “immune response gene” category.
Interestingly, when this dataset was used to infer the enrichment of
specific cell types in the CNS, we detected a noticeable enrichment
toward genes expressed by microglia in mice colonized with MS
microbiota compared with controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
The inability of fecal bacteria from MS patients to promote
Treg responses was observed both pre- and post-EAE induction,
consistent with the microbiota showing no major differences
in beta diversity at time points before and after the disease
(Fig. 7B).
Principal component analysis of beta diversity of the microbiota
in recipient animals showed a significant separation by donor
that was stabilized as early as 7 d after transplantation (Fig. 7B
and SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). This separation was recapitulated
by metrics of alpha diversity (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). Interestingly,
some of the changes in relative abundance of individual bac-
terial genera, including a decrease in Sutterella and an in-
crease in Ruminococcus, were also observed in mice colonized
with microbiota from MS-discordant twins (SI Appendix, Fig.
S9C) (25). Although human and mouse microbiota are not

 directly comparable, the biological pathways represented by
MS-associated taxa largely overlap in the two groups (SI Ap-
pendix, Tables S3 and S4).
Collectively, the MS microbial community in vivo enhances
EAE disease progression and fails to induce IL-10+ Tregs
relative to gut bacteria from healthy controls, suggesting a
functional role for the microbiota in autoimmunity that may be
independent of host factors.
Discussion
Here we present a comparative structural analysis of the gut
microbiome from patients with MS followed by functional studies of
MS-associated microbiota. Our results reinforce the concept of MS
pathogenesis as a multihit model that combines genetic pre-
disposition and environmental factors, one of which is the micro-
biota. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that gut microbiota
contribute to creating a sustained proinflammatory environment,
which, in combination with genetic and other environmental factors,
may crystallize the pathogenic autodestructive process of myelin.
In our admittedly simplistic experimental setup, we used crude
bacterial extracts without prior fractionation; thus the relevant
active components may consist of any bacterial products, either
secreted or intracellular. Known bacterial metabolites with im-
munoregulatory effects fall into multiple categories, including
polysaccharides (26), short-chain fatty acids (27), and aryl hy-
drocarbons (28). In addition, although we analyzed the effects of
bacterial extracts on peripheral immune cells, some bacterial
metabolites are able to cross the blood–CNS barrier and directly
regulate CNS inflammation via microglia (29, 30) or astrocytes
(28). Future research will likely be directed toward identifying
the therapeutic potential of such products in MS and other
complex diseases.
Although intestinal A. muciniphila has been extensively studied in
the context of diet and obesity (22, 31), its role in regulating immune
responses is less well understood. Here we provide in vitro evidence
that A. muciniphila promotes Th1 lymphocyte differentiation.
Consistent with our observations, A. muciniphila has been reported
to exacerbate inflammation during infection (23). In contrast, a
recent study reported that EAE-resistant male TNFR2−/− mice
harbor more A. muciniphila than do disease-susceptible TNFR2−/−
females (32). However, it remains to be addressed whether EAE
susceptibility in this genotype is driven by the gut microbiome or by
other factors that stem from gender and genetic differences. No-
tably, in a recently published study (12), as well as in companion the
MS-discordant twin study in this issue of PNAS (25), Akkermansia
was reported to be elevated in untreated MS patients.
The higher prevalence of Acinetobacter within MS subjects is
consistent with previous reports of increased serum antibody
responses (21, 33). Strikingly, A. calcoaceticus has also been
shown to encode peptides that mimic the amino acid sequences
of myelin basic protein (MBP) and MOG (21), both of which are
myelin components (34). This suggests that molecular mimicry
could potentially convert a normal immune response toward
Acinetobacter into autoimmunity against myelin. Recently, an-
other model of molecular mimicry-mediated CNS autoimmunity
was proposed when aquaporin four-specific T lymphocytes from

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
SEE COMMENTARY
 neuromyelitis optica patients were found to recognize a peptide
from Clostridium perfringens and induce a Th17 bias (6), and this
organism was found to be overabundant in neuromyelitis optica
patients compared with healthy controls (35).
A growing body of literature has associated both CD25+FoxP3+
Tregs and IL-10–expressing T lymphocytes with alterations in gut
microbiota. For example, monocolonization of GF mice with spe-
cific bacterial species is sufficient to drive CD25+FoxP3+ Treg
differentiation and alter disease phenotype (3). Of interest, P.
distasonis has also been shown to induce Treg differentiation in GF
mice (2). In addition, our findings suggest that in vivo exposure to
pure P. distasonis is associated with a subsequent immunoregulatory
response to this bacterium in vitro. This observation is supported by
the result that the immune cells of MS patients have impaired Treg
differentiation in response to autologous (self) bacteria. Thus, the
initial exposure to P. distasonis or other “beneficial” bacteria found
in healthy subjects may contribute to expanding regulatory T lym-
phocyte precursor populations, thus promoting antiinflammatory
responses upon subsequent exposure to the same bacteria.
While previous studies using GF mouse models have identi-
fied that the absence of gut bacteria ameliorates EAE (13, 14),
here we show that gut bacteria transplanted from MS patients
promotes more severe EAE symptoms than seen in mice that
were transplanted with fecal bacteria from household controls.
Similar results of microbiota being sufficient to transfer a human
donor phenotype to GF mice have been reported in the context
of obesity (36) and inflammatory bowel disease (37), and rheu-
matoid arthritis-associated bacteria were shown to exacerbate
the disease in a mouse model of colitis (7). However, our study
shows that the gut microbiota is able to transfer the phenotype in
a disease model unrelated to the digestive system and suggests a
potentially causal role for the gut microbiota in MS.
We consider GF mouse monocolonization as a valid experi-
mental model to study microbial functions in vivo. However, we
also recognize this approach has caveats, as monocolonization may
not represent bacterial functions within the entire microbial com-
munity of the gut, and it requires using a mouse host for bacteria
that presumably have a function in human disease. Therefore, it is
not surprising to find that in vivo studies using monocolonized mice
do not completely replicate in vitro results from human cells. We
interpret our in vitro and in vivo findings as the first step toward
future studies to identify pathways and metabolites that modulate
Th1 and IL-10+ regulatory T lymphocytes. Such studies will likely
open new avenues for the development of novel, microbiome-
based therapeutic approaches for autoimmunity.
