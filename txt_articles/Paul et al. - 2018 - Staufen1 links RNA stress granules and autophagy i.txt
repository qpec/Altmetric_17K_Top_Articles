Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of
polyglutamine tract in the ATXN2 protein. We identified Staufen1 (STAU1) as an interactor of
ATXN2, and showed elevation in cells from SCA2 patients, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) patients, and in SCA2 mouse models. We demonstrated recruitment of STAU1 to
mutant ATXN2 aggregates in brain tissue from patients with SCA2 human brain and in an
SCA2 mouse model, and association of STAU1 elevation with dysregulation of SCA2-related
transcript abundances. Targeting STAU1 in vitro by RNAi restored PCP2 transcript levels
and lowering mutant ATXN2 also normalized STAU1 levels. Reduction of Stau1 in vivo
improved motor behavior in an SCA2 mouse model, normalized the levels of several SCA2-
related proteins, and reduced aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2. These findings
suggest a function for STAU1 in aberrant RNA metabolism associated with ATXN2 mutation,
suggesting STAU1 is a possible novel therapeutic target for SCA2.

 S
pinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal
dominant cerebellar ataxia characterized by progressive
degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), and selective
loss of neurons within the brainstem and spinal cord1–4. The
mutation in SCA2 is expansion of a CAG repeat in exon-1 of the
ATXN2 gene encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) domain. PolyQ
expansions in ATXN2 result in toxic gain of function associated
with neuronal protein aggregates5,6. ATXN2 aggregates, degen-
eration of cerebellar PCs and altered RNA expressions are
pathological consequences of ATXN2 mutation in SCA2 patients
and animal models7–10.
ATXN2 is widely expressed in the mammalian nervous system,
and is involved in diverse cellular functions involving inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and EGF receptor signaling as
well as translation and embryonic development1,9,11–15. ATXN2
interacts with multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including
RNA splicing factor A2BP1/Fox1, polyA binding protein 1
(PABP1), DDX6, and Tar DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43)
demonstrating its unique role in RNA metabolism15–20. Fur-
thermore, ATXN2 is a constituent protein of stress granules (SGs)
and P-bodies, suggesting its function in sequestering mRNAs and
regulating protein translation during stress16,17,21–23.
The double-stranded RNA-binding proteins, Staufen1 (STAU1)
and Staufen2 (STAU2) are recruited to cytoplasmic inclusions in
brain oligodendrocytes and cultured cells and modulate SGs
dynamics24,25. STAU1 is a multifunctional protein involved in
regulating RNA metabolism, but also with mRNA transport in
neuronal dendrites, and other cells in vertebrates26–30. STAU1-
deficient mice exhibit defects in dendritic mRNA transport and
neuron morphology with reduced synapse formation31. STAU1
together with TDP-43 and FMRP is involved in ribonucleoprotein
particle transport in neuronal dendrites. Dysregulation of the
STAU1/TDP-43/FMRP complex sensitizes neurons to death32,33.
Furthermore, STAU1 regulates the translational efficiency via 5′
UTR and polysome association, and the stability of specific tran-
scripts through their 3′UTRs, a mechanism referred to as STAU1-
mediated RNA decay (SMD)34–36.
Mutant polyQ proteins have been associated with dysfunction
in the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) and the autophagic
system. Autophagy dysfunction is associated with many neuro-
degenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), Huntington disease (HD), and Autism spectrum disorders
(ASD)37–39. Stimulating autophagy is beneficial for HD, fronto-
temporal degeneration (FTD) with ALS, and ASD disease mod-
els38–40. However, the role of autophagy dysfunction in SCA2
pathology and its link to dysregulated mRNA levels is poorly
understood.
In this study, we show that STAU1 steady-state levels are
increased in cells from SCA2 and ALS patients as well as in SCA2
animal models. SGs are increased in SCA2-derived cells even under
physiologic conditions and STAU1 is recruited to mutant ATXN2
aggregates in SCA2 fibroblasts. We establish a function for STAU1
in regulating abundance of mRNA transcripts in a manner that
mimics the defects observed in SCA2 cellular and animal models.
Furthermore, reducing STAU1 levels restored expression of several
SCA2-related proteins in vitro and in vivo. We establish a novel role
for STAU1 in dysregulated RNA metabolism, and demonstrate that
lowering STAU1 expression can restore specific aspects of SCA2
pathology. STAU1 may represent a therapeutic target for certain
neurodegenerative diseases.
Results
ATXN2 and Staufen1 co-localization and interaction in SCA2.
An association of STAU1 and SGs in brain oligodendrocytes and
other cultured cells was previously described24,25. Because
ATXN2 is a component of SGs16,17, we investigated if ATXN2
and STAU1 co-localized under conditions of stress. The specifi-
city of anti-Staufen antibody was confirmed by multiple methods
(Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). Following exposure of HEK-293 cells
to arsenite (oxidative stress), we assessed ATXN2 and STAU1 co-
localization by immunofluorescence. Arsenite-induced stress
resulted in co-localization of ATXN2 and STAU1 in cytoplasmic
SGs positive for TIA-1, a marker for SGs41 (Fig. 1a).
SCA2 cells are under intracellular stress caused by expression of
toxic mutant ATXN2. As ATXN2 aggregates are evident in SCA2
brains5–8, we investigated the recruitment of STAU1 to ATXN2
aggregates in SCA2 fibroblasts (FBs) under normal and stress
conditions. Under physiological conditions (without added stress),
SCA2 FBs (ATXN2-Q22/42) demonstrated elevated numbers of
SG-like aggregates positive for both ATXN2 and STAU1 that were
rarely observed in normal FBs (ATXN2-Q22/22). By ImageJ, the
average area per aggregate was about 15% higher for SCA2 cells
over wild-type cells at 37 °C (Fig. 1b–d). Under conditions of
stress, increased numbers of ATXN2-STAU1 granules were seen
in normal and SCA2 FBs, but granule numbers were more
pronounced in SCA2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). We then
investigated Staufen1 in vivo. Double immunostaining for ATXN2
and STAU1 demonstrated that both co-localized to aggregates in
cerebellar PCs of ATXN2Q127 mouse (Fig. 1e) and individuals with
SCA2 (Fig. 1f), but not in unaffected controls. Our observation of
strong STAU1 expression in human PCs is consistent with STAU1
in cerebellar PCs reported by the Human Protein Atlas (http://
www.proteinatlas.org/).
Co-localization of ATXN2 and STAU1 in SG-like aggregates in
SCA2 cells predicts physical interaction between the two proteins.
To test this hypothesis, HEK-293 cell extracts (with or without
RNase A treatment) expressing Flag-tagged ATXN2-Q22 or
ATXN2-Q108 were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with
Flag monoclonal antibody (mAb) beads. Western blot analysis
showed expression of Flag-ATXN2 proteins as expected, as well
as RNA-dependent interaction of endogenous STAU1 with Flag-
ATXN2-Q22 or Flag-ATXN2-Q108 (Fig. 1g). Notably, an
increased level of STAU1 was seen in input cellular extracts
when Flag-ATXN2-Q108 was overexpressed but not Flag or Flag-
ATXN2-Q22. The ATXN2 immunoprecipitates also showed co-
IP of PABPC1 (RNA-dependent) and DDX6 (both RNA and
non-RNA-dependent),
both
of
which
are
known
ATXN2
interactors9,15–17. Taken together, these data support physical
interaction and co-localization of ATXN2 and STAU1 in SG-like
aggregates in SCA2 cells.
STAU1 levels are increased in neurodegenerative disease.
Because STAU1 interacts with ATXN2 and forms aggregates with
mutant ATXN2 in SCA2 cells, we measured steady-state levels of
STAU1 in SCA2- FBs and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalized
lymphoblastoid B cells (LBCs). We used SCA2 skin FBs with
CAG (35, 35, 35, 42, and 45) repeats and SCA2 LBCs with CAG
(40, 46, and 52) repeats in ATXN2. Expression of ATXN2 (CAG
repeats) in SCA2- FBs or LBCs was validated by reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2a, b). Whole-cell extracts were prepared with
Laemmli sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis (SDS–PAGE) sample buffer9,42, and analyzed by western
blotting to determine STAU1 levels. Compared to normal control
cells, SCA2- FBs and LBCs showed increased STAU1 levels with
DDX6 protein levels unchanged (Fig. 2a, b). As HD and SCA3 are
caused by CAG repeat expansions, HD and SCA3 FBs would be
expected to exhibit increased STAU1 levels. Surprisingly, no
significant alterations of STAU1 levels were observed in HD and
SCA3 FBs (Fig. 2a) or HEK-293 cell expressing mutant ATXN3

 (Flag-ATXN3-Q56) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Next, we expanded
our investigation to determine if Stau1 levels were abnormally
increased in the cerebella of SCA2 mice (ATXN2Q127 and BAC-
Q72) (refs. 8,9). Compared to wild-type mice, cerebellar extracts
from ATXN2Q127 and BAC-Q72 mice (24 weeks of age) had
increased abundances of Stau1, but Stau1 increases were not
observed in BAC-Q22 mice (Fig. 2c, d). The sensitivity of STAU1
to cellular stress prompted us to examine whether this pathway
was active in other neurodegenerative disease conditions. We
used ALS-patient FBs harboring the TDP-43G298S mutation and
observed increased STAU1 levels compared to control FBs
(Fig. 2e). Altogether, these findings establish that STAU1 levels
are significantly increased as a consequence of mutations in two
different genes leading to neurodegeneration.

 Next, we tested whether increased STAU1 was a direct
consequence of mutations in ATXN2 or TDP-43. Mutant TDP-
43 or aggregations of wild-type TDP-43 are associated with
ALS43,44. The exogenous expression of ATXN2-Q58 or -Q108
resulted increased STAU1 levels. DDX6 protein levels were
unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Likewise, expression of wild-
type or mutant TDP-43 caused increased STAU1 levels as well
(Supplementary Fig. 2e).
Increased STAU1 abundance is caused by altered protein
turnover. To identify the underlying mechanism of increased
STAU1 levels, we examined Staufen1 transcript levels in SCA2
and ALS cells, and pathological tissues from SCA2 mouse models.
Results of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses showed few differences in Staufen1
transcript levels with ATXN2 or TDP-43 mutations (Fig. 2f–h).
Given the role of misfolded polyglutamine-expanded proteins in
abnormal protein homeostasis, we hypothesized that mutant
ATXN2-induced STAU1 abundance might be due to increased
stability or impairment of proteasome and/or autophagy path-
ways. To determine STAU1 stability with ATXN2 mutation, we
performed cycloheximide (CHX)-chase experiments demon-
strating slower STAU1 degradation in SCA2 FBs compared to
normal cells (Fig. 3a, b).
In order to investigate STAU1 metabolism under physiologic
gene dosage we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing45 to introduce
an expanded CAG58 (Q58) repeat into one ATXN2 allele in
human HEK-293 cells. We designated these ATXN2-Q22/58
knock-in (KI) cells. ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells had elevated STAU1
abundance and ATXN2-STAU1 SGs. PCP2 proteins levels were
also reduced in the cellular model, recapitulating expression
changes in SCA2 mouse cerebella8,9 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. 3). In prior studies, we had established key transcriptomic
changes in SCA2 mouse models including reduced abundances in
cerebellar PCP2, CACNA1G, and ITPR1 mRNAs8,9. These
changes were replicated in ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells in the
presence of one mutant ATXN2 allele (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To test if STAU1 is degraded by the proteasome, we assayed
STAU1 levels in asynchronous HEK-293 and ATXN2-Q22/58 KI
cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Compared to
untreated cells, the levels of STAU1 were not significantly
changed in MG132 treated HEK-293 cells (DMSO vs. MG132
treated groups at each time point) (Fig. 3d, e). Likewise, no
significant changes in STAU1 levels were observed in ATXN2-
Q22/58 KI cells upon MG132 treatment (DMSO vs. MG132
treated groups at each time point) (Fig. 3d, e) suggesting that
STAU1 is not substrate of proteasome pathway. As expected, both
HEK-293 and ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells showed significantly
increased levels of Cyclin B1, a proteasome substrate, upon
proteasome inhibition.
As
STAU1
was
not
degraded
by
the
proteasome,
we
hypothesized that abnormal autophagy might explain elevated
STAU1 in disease models. Inefficient turnover of light chain 3
isoform II (LC3-II, the lipidated isoform of LC3-I) in conjunction
with accumulation of sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), correlates
with autophagy malfunction46. On western blots, ATXN2-Q22/58
KI cells and SCA2 FBs showed impaired autophagy, as indicated
by the increased levels of LC3-II and p62 (Fig. 3c, f).
Accumulation of LC3-II is evidence for efficient autophagosome
synthesis prior to degradation at the autolysosome, but also for
inefficient autophagosome-lysosome fusion (autolysosome pro-
duction). To test if LC3-II was increased in SCA2 cells due to
inefficient autophagosome-lysosome fusion, we assayed LC3-II in
the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Baf, autophagosome-lysosome
fusion inhibitor)47,48. Dose-wise Baf treatment resulted in
increased LC3-II and p62 levels in HEK-293 and ATXN2-Q22/
58 KI cells Fig. 3g). We also observed significant increases of
STAU1 in HEK-293 and ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells upon Baf
treatment (Fig. 3g, h) suggesting inefficient STAU1 clearance.
Thus, these data suggest that aberrant protein homeostasis in
SCA2 cells occurs through mutant ATXN2 and impaired
autophagy.
STAU1 and aberrant mRNA processing. Previously, we estab-
lished transcriptome and protein profiles characterized by pro-
gressive changes in the course of degeneration in SCA2 mouse
models8,9. Two proteins that are progressively reduced in SCA2
mouse models are Pcp2 and Calb1, both of which are highly
expressed in PCs. In SCA2 FBs and SCA2 LBCs, Pcp2 mRNAs are
significantly reduced in the presence of mutant ATXN2 (Fig. 4a,
b). As neither PCP2 or CALB1 protein are translated in FBs or
LBCs, we examined the effect on PCP2 and CALB1 in HEK-293
cells (Fig. 4c, d). When STAU1 was overexpressed, we observed
reduced PCP2 protein, as well as reduced PCP2 and CALB1
mRNA abundances. Endogenous ATXN2 mRNA levels were
measured to exclude selective cellular toxicity of STAU1 over-
expression, and were found to be invariant (Fig. 4d). Thus, these
data demonstrate that aberrant mRNA levels in vivo can be in
part recapitulated in a cell culture model.
We next analyzed STAU1 function in the regulation of PCP2
mRNA stability in cultured cells. MYC-tagged PCP2 cDNA
(including 5′ and 3′ UTRs, or excluding the 3′UTR) was
overexpressed in short-term hygromycin selected HEK-293 cells
expressing Flag-tagged STAU1. It is known that STAU1 can bind to
5′ or 3′ UTRs of specific mRNAs to regulate their expression34–36.
We tested the requirement for the 5′ or 3′ UTRs by cloning MYC-
tagged PCP2 mRNAs with these mRNA segments, and determined
protein levels by western blotting. Exogenous Flag-STAU1 led to
reduction of PCP2 only in the presence of the 3′UTR (Fig. 4e–h).
We further tested the importance of the 3′UTR by transient co-
expression of Flag-tagged STAU1 with Luciferase-PCP2-3′UTR in
HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4i). STAU1 regulates PCP2 expression via its 3′
UTR consistent with SMD.
We next proceeded to test direct interaction between STAU1
and the PCP2 3′UTR. Non-RNase A treated HEK-293 cell
extracts overexpressing Flag-tagged STAU1 were subjected to
protein–RNA IP with Flag mAb beads, and eluted protein–RNA
complexes were divided into two aliquots for western blot and
RT-PCR analyses. Flag-STAU1 showed co-IP of ATXN2 (Fig. 5a).
RT-PCR analyses from the second aliquot revealed that Flag-
STAU1 pulled down PCP2 but not control GAPDH mRNA
(Fig. 5a). CALB1 mRNA was also pulled down but was not
further studied for its direct interaction with STAU1.
To confirm direct binding between STAU1 and its targets,
northwestern blotting experiments were performed using bacte-
rially expressed recombinant His-tagged STAU1 protein and
in vitro transcribed DIG-labeled PCP2 probes. We generated
several probes: DIG- PCP2[(5′ + 3′)UTR)] (b), DIG-PCP2(3′
UTR) (c), and DIG-PCP2(5′UTR) (d) (Fig. 5), which allowed us
to identify those parts of the PCP2 RNA that interacted with
STAU1. STAU1 bound to PCP2[(5′ + 3′)UTR)] and PCP2(3′
UTR) RNAs but not to PCP2(5′UTR) RNA, thereby showing the
specificity of the interaction (Fig. 5e). Altogether, these results
demonstrate that STAU1 interacts with the PCP2 mRNA via its 3′
UTR.
To test whether the direct interaction occurs in SGs, we
performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a PCP2-
Cy3 probe. We showed that PCP2 mRNA co-localized with
STAU1 aggregates (Fig. 5f).

 Reduced Staufen1 levels ameliorate SCA2 phenotypes. The
increased abundance of STAU1 in neurodegenerative diseases
and its association with dysregulation of RNA processing in
SCA2 led us to predict that lowering STAU1 levels might be
beneficial.

(ATXN2-Q22/52) LBCs by RNAi demonstrated restoration of
PCP2 mRNA expression similar to that in normal LBCs treated

(Fig. 6a–c). Consistent with this, we also observed that dose-wise
depletion of STAU1 had no effect on ATXN2 protein levels in
control or ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Thus, reducing STAU1 levels rescued the effect of mutant
ATXN2 on aberrant PCP2 mRNA metabolism observed in
SCA2.

 To test whether depleting mutant ATXN2 in SCA2 cells had an
effect on STAU1 abundance, we depleted mutant ATXN2 dose-
wise in SCA2- LBCs (ATXN2-Q22/52) or FBs (ATXN2-Q22/42)
by
ATXN2
RNAi.
Reducing
ATXN2
levels
demonstrated
significant reduction of STAU1 and a significant increase of
PCP2 mRNA levels compared to control RNAi (Fig. 6d–i). In
parallel, depletion of ATXN2 by RNAi also resulted in normal-
ization of STAU1 levels in ATXN2-Q22/58 KI cells compared to
control RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Notably, reducing
ATXN2 levels did not affect Staufen1 protein and transcript
levels in control HEK-293 cells, and in cerebella from Atxn2
knock-out mice49 (8 weeks of age) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).

 To test targeting Stau1 in vivo, we used a well characterized
model
of
cerebellar
neurodegeneration
expressing
mutant
ATXN2Q127 in PCs8. ATXN2Q127 mice develop progressive
behavioral and proteomic deficits with an onset at 8 weeks. We
crossed these mice with a previously generated mouse line
deficient for one Stau1 allele8,31. This cross generated four
genotypes and all comparisons were made between littermates.
Reducing Stau1 dosage by 50% in wild-type animals did not affect
rotarod behavior. On the other hand, Stau1 reduction in
ATXN2Q127 mice lead to an improved performance on the
accelerating rotarod (Fig. 7a).
Significant and progressive decreases in key PC mRNAs and
even greater decreases in the respective encoded proteins (Calb1,
Pcp2, Rgs8, Pcp4, Homer3, and Fam107b) have been described
in SCA2 mice8,9,50. Stau1 haploinsufficiency in ATXN2Q127 mice
significantly increased levels of these six proteins toward
normalization (Fig. 7b, c). SCA2 cells with mutant ATXN2
form ATXN2-STAU1 aggregates (Fig. 1). We, therefore, tested
whether Stau1 reduction would reduce aggregates in vivo.
Whereas aggregates positive for Stau1 and ATXN2 are abundant
in PCs of ATXN2Q127 mice, Stau1 haploinsufficiency was
associated with virtual absence of aggregates (Fig. 7d). Thus,
Stau1
haploinsufficiency
partially
restored
behavioral,
proteomic, and morphological characteristics of SCA2 pathology
in vivo.
Discussion
Processes regulating RNA metabolism, including translation,
transport, storage, and degradation, have important roles in cel-
lular function both in health and diseases. SGs are critical for
normal RNA metabolism as they regulate translation during
cellular stress. RNA granules can regulate mRNA transport and
exert local expression control, and SGs are regulated by
autophagy.
Linkages between SGs and neurodegenerative disorders have
been well documented. Many protein components of RNA
granules are recruited to and modulate formation of SGs,
including ATXN2, TDP-43, fused in sarcoma (FUS), survival of
motor neuron (SMN) and fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP)51. Misregulation of these RBPs by mutation or other
means contributes to neuronal dysfunctions and is a primary
cause of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Gene silencing of
ATXN2 has shown promise in preclinical evaluations using
mouse models of SCA2 and ALS50,52. ATXN2 regulates RNA
metabolism through interacting with RBPs and is localized in

human PCP2 RNA probes with both UTRs (b), 3′ UTR only (c), and 5′UTR only (d). e Bacterial expressed His-STAU1, His-GFP, or control bacterial lysate
(vector alone) were run on SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) or western blotted with anti-His antibody (blot 1). Protein blots
were hybridized with DIG-labeled PCP2 RNA probes followed by anti-DIG antibody staining. STAU1 directly interacts with PCP2 RNAs: (5′ + 3′)UTRs (blot

 SGs9,15–20. It remained unclear, however, whether these interac-
tions and SG-localization were significant in SCA2 pathogenesis
in part because no protein binding or SG-localization differences
were ever observed between wild-type and mutant ATXN2.
Here, we show for the first time that STAU1 is a novel RNA-
dependent interactor for ATXN2 (Fig. 1). The strength of
protein–protein interaction did not differ for wild-type and
mutant ATXN2, and we found co-localization of STAU1 with
ATXN2 aggregates in individuals with SCA2 and in an SCA2
mouse model (Fig. 1). We showed increased STAU1 levels in
SCA2- FBs and LBCs, SCA2 mouse cerebellar extracts, and in
ALS cells expressing mutant TDP-43 (Fig. 2). We also modeled
SCA2 in cultured cells by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
editing to introduce a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2, and
found that these cells have increased steady-state STAU1 levels
and a molecular signature partially shared with SCA2 mouse
cerebella, including impaired autophagy read-out (increased
LC3-II levels) (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that STAU1
elevation is a common feature of some neurodegenerative
states.
Staufen was first described as a protein in the fly zygote that
was essential for polarized localization of specific mRNAs such as
oskar and bicoid53,54. Since flies with a complete absence of
Staufen were viable, but could not generate fertile offspring, genes

 in this class were designated “grandchildless” and given names of
European extinct noble lines (staufen, tudor, valois, vasa, etc.).
Subsequently, Staufen was identified in mammalian cells, loca-
lized to RNA granules under cellular stress, and implicated in a
number of RNA-related functions such as mRNA transport and
degradation.
Consistent with the established role for STAU1 in mRNA
transport from fly studies, we observed increases in SG numbers
in SCA2 FBs (Fig. 1). As steady-state STAU1 levels were con-
sistently increased in multiple SCA2 cell lines, we examined the
presence of STAU1-labeled RNA granules under normal vs.
stressed conditions. During stress, the number of RNA granules

 in SCA2 cells was greater than in normal control cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1e, f). The observation of differences requires precise
control of the timing of stress due to the dynamic nature of stress-
granule assembly55, which might explain why this was not
observed previously17.
Our data suggest that ATXN2 mutation results in abnormal
autophagy leading to increased STAU1 abundance. Autophagy
dysfunctions have also been seen in association with other
polyglutamine disease genes38,56,57. It is also possible that STAU1
is more directly involved in autophagic feedback regulation on
ATXN2. Additional work will be required to characterize the role
of ATXN2 in abnormal autophagy and the potential function of
STAU1 in signaling to the autophagosome.
One of the functions of STAU1 is targeting specific mRNAs for
degradation via SMD, a mechanism similar to nonsense-mediated
decay35,36. To verify this for SCA2 genes, we evaluated expression
of PC-specific transcripts that were significantly downregulated in
the cerebella of ATXN2Q127 and BAC-Q72 mice8,9,50. PCP2,
CALB1, RGS8, PCP4, Fam107b, and Homer3 are highly expressed
in mature Purkinje cells and have reduced expression in SCA2
mice, and their expression was improved in ATXN2Q127 mice
haploinsufficient for Stau1 (Fig. 7). We showed that one of these
mRNAs, PCP2, precipitated with STAU1 dependent on the pre-
sence of its 3′UTR (Fig. 5), consistent with SMD mediated by
STAU1 interaction with 3′UTRs35,36. STAU1 is known to interact
with target RNAs by recognizing double-stranded RNA structures
through
one
or
more
double-stranded
RNA-binding
domains58,59. Double-stranded RNAs can be formed by intra-
molecular folding of the 3′UTR upon itself or by heteromolecular
interaction, for
example with lincRNAs60.
With a recent
demonstration for directly differentiating iPSCs into human
PCs61, it may now be possible to define STAU1-dependent
mRNA networks in PCs, in addition to using the extant tran-
scriptome profiles in SCA2 mouse models8,9.
Although SMD-networks have been identified for several cell
types35,36,62,63, little is known regarding SMD in PCs. Increased
SMD in ATXN2Q127 or BAC-Q72 mice represented an attractive
explanation for a large number of downregulated mRNAs in
cerebellar transcriptomes at time points preceding any dendritic
or cellular loss8,9. Some of these RNAs (~ 15.6%) had also been
identified as STAU1 interactors by hiCLIP63 (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1), supporting the notion of
STAU1-mediated RNA processing in SCA2. The VENN diagram
compares two disparate datasets (HEK-293 cells vs. mouse cere-
bella). Despite this, 176 PC mRNAs are shared as potential direct
STAU1 targets. Included among these is Fam107b that is highly
reduce in SCA2 mice8,9,50 (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supple-
mentary Table 1). The demonstration of STAU1 interaction with
PCP2 mRNA in SCA2 SGs labeling positive for both (Fig. 5)
supports the hypothesis of STAU1-mediated dysregulation of
RNAs in neurodegeneration.
Our observations in SCA2 models of aberrant STAU1 abun-
dances or aggregates and reduced PCP2 mRNA point to STAU1
as a therapeutic target for SCA2. We used RNAi to reduce STAU1
expression in SCA2 cells and were able to restore PCP2 mRNA
abundance (Fig. 6). Likewise, reducing mutant ATXN2 in SCA2
cells leads to the same result placing ATXN2 likely upstream of
STAU1-mediated effects on PCP2 (Fig. 6). In addition, STAU1
elevation in cultured ALS cells (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2e),
supports that STAU1 could be a therapeutic target for multiple
neurodegenerative diseases.
The significance of STAU1 to neurodegeneration was further
emphasized by in vivo studies. We used genetic interaction to
reduce Stau1 gene dosage in ATXN2Q127 mice demonstrating
improved motor deficit function, restored expression of cerebellar
SCA2-related proteins8,9,50 (Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that the
levels of SCA2-related proteins were unchanged in wild-type
littermates that were haploinsufficient for Stau1, and that the
rotarod performance of these mice was normal. Thus, it is
noteworthy that significant transcriptomic changes caused by loss
of motor neuron autophagy were seen in SOD1 mice but not
normal control mice64. We also observed that reduced STAU1
levels decreased the burden of ATXN2exp aggregates (Fig. 7),
which provides mechanistic evidence that STAU1 elevation may
potentiate ATXN2exp-induced toxicity. Furthermore, interaction
between ATXN2 and STAU1 and STAU1-mediated RNA pro-
cessing (Figs. 1 and 4) support that notion. Our data suggest that
STAU1 as a sensor of cellular stress that once engaged, may
trigger a rapid response leading to reciprocal effects on autop-
hagy. In the absence of stress, changes of STAU1 levels appear to
have relatively minor effects at least within the parameters
measured in this study. Beyond ATXN2, strategies that reduce
STAU1 abundances could be pursued as a way to mitigate
ATXN2exp pathlogical aggregation and neurodegeneration.
Overall, our results demonstrate that ATXN2exp expression
and consequent elevation of STAU1 level in SCA2 are dually
deleterious
affecting
autophagy
function
via
inefficient
autophagosome-lysosome fusion and mRNA stability via SMD, as
summarized in Fig. 7e. Lowering STAU1 expression may be a
potent therapeutic approach for SCA2 that may be effective for
ALS as well.
Misregulated processing of mRNAs has been implicated in a
number of neurological diseases65. Targeting ribonucleoprotein
particle (RNP) assembly in human neurodegenerative diseases is
a relatively new approach. Protter and Parker (2016) divided
diseases in hypo- and hyper-assembly diseases with spinal mus-
cular atrophy (SMA) falling into the former and ALS into the
latter category65. SCA2 may be the first known polyQ disease that
—at least in part—can now be considered an RNA granule hyper-
assembly disease. A central role for STAU1 in the pathogenesis of
a neurodegenerative disease has hitherto not been described and
should be examined in other diseases. Our data suggest protein
dyshomeostasis as a common underlying feature of neurode-
generative diseases and that targeting STAU1 may have broad
therapeutic potential. STAU1 may offer unique targets for small
molecules and antisense oligonucleotides. Rather than targeting
STAU1 expression levels itself it may also be possible to target
interaction of STAU1 with specific RNA targets.
Methods
DNA constructs. Human cDNA sequences for STAU1 (NM_001037328) were
derived from the NCBI DNA database and used to design primers to PCR-amplify
the coding sequences from a cDNA library made from human embryonic kidney
293 (HEK-293) cells. All cDNAs including ATXN2 with expanded CAG repeats7
were subsequently cloned into the appropriate vectors; pcDNA3.1/Flag (Agilent
Technologies, USA) plasmids. For in vitro RNA-binding assay, human STAU1 and
GFP coding sequences were PCR amplified and cloned into pET-His plasmids. All
constructs were verified by sequencing.
siRNAs and reagents. The siRNAs used in this study were: All Star Negative Control
siRNA (Qiagen, Cat# 1027280), human siATXN2 [Hs_ATXN2_2 (Qiagen, Cat#
SI00308196)], human siSTAU1: 5′-CCUAUAACUACAACAUGAGdTdT-3′ and
mouse siStau1: 5′-CAACUGUACUACCUUUCCAdTdT-3′ (ref. 35). Staufen1 siRNA
oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, USA. The oligonucleotides were
deprotected and the complementary strands were annealed. Cycloheximide (Tocris
USA, Cat# 0970), Bafilomycin A1 (InvivoGen USA, Cat# tlrl-baf1) and (S)-MG132
(Cayman Chemical USA, Cat# 10012628) were used in this study.

 Cell culture and transfections. Four normal skin fibroblasts (ATXN2 with
CAG22) and five SCA2 patient-derived skin FBs (ATXN2 with CAG repeats; 35,
35, 35, 42, and 45), were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DMEM)
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Two normal (ATXN2 with CAG22)
and three SCA2 patient-derived (ATXN2 with CAG repeats; 40, 46, and 52)
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized LBCs were maintained in RPMI medium
containing 15% fetal bovine serum. All subjects gave written consent and all
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of
Utah. The following primary human fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Cell
Repositories (Camden, NJ, USA): ALS patient (TDP-43G298S mutation)
(ND32947), Huntington disease (HD) patient (ND33392) and SCA3 (Machado-
Joseph disease, MJD) patient (GM06153). TDP-43G298S, HD, SCA3, and HEK-293
cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
For overexpression of recombinant proteins, HEK-293 cells were seeded on
100 mm or 6-well dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were then transfected
with plasmid DNAs and harvested 48 h post-transfection and processed as two
aliquots for protein and RNA analyses. For siRNA experiments, cells were transfected
with siRNAs using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific),
and lymphoblastoid B cells (1 × 106) were electroporated with siRNAs using the Neon
transfection system (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
seeded on 6-well plates. Prior standardization experiments showed that maximum
silencing was achieved 4–5 days post-transfection/electroporation.
Generation of HEK-293-ATXN2-Q22/58 knock-in (KI) cells. CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated gene editing was carried out according to published protocols45. The
human ATXN2 locus was engineered to replace CAG22 with CAG58 repeats in
ATXN2 exon-1 in a BAC clone (RP11-798L5) containing ATXN2 (Empire
Genomics, USA). The modified CAG58 repeat with flanking locus-specific 0.6 Kb
left and right homologous arms (HAs) were cloned into a donor vector. The
sgRNA oligonucleotides targeting the ATXN2 locus were annealed and cloned into
the hSpCas9-2A-Puro (PX459) vector (Addgene, Cat# 62988). HEK-293 cells were
transfected with linearized donor vector and single guide RNA pgRNA-Cas9 vector
using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. The cells were cultured with 1.0 μg/
ml puromycin for ~ 7–10 days. The puromycin-resistant cells were plated and
cultured in a 96-well plate at 1 cell/well until most wells were ~ 80% confluent with
cells. The cells were then expanded and maintained for PCR screening to identify
knock-in positive cells.
Mice. ATXN2Q127 (Pcp2-ATXN2[Q127]) mice8 were maintained in a B6D2F1/J
background and BAC-SCA2 mice (BAC-Q22 and BAC-Q72) (ref. 9) in a C57BL/6J
and FVB/NJ mixed background, and SCA2 knock-out [Atxn2-/-] mouse49 in a
C57BL/6J and 129 × 1/SvJ mixed background were used. The Stau1tm1Apa(-/-)
(Stau1-/-) mouse31 was a generous gift from Prof. Michael A. Kiebler, Ludwig
Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, and maintained in a C57BL/6J
background. Genotyping of animals was accomplished according to published
protocols8,9,31,49. All mice were bred and maintained under standard conditions
consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines and conformed to an
approved University of Utah IACUC protocol.

Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence studies were performed to determine
the co-localization of ATXN2 and Staufen1. Briefly, SCA2 FBs and ATXN2-Q22/58
KI cells were plated on cover slides overnight and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/
PBS. For stress experiments, HEK-293 cells or SCA2 FBs were cultured on cover
slides for overnight and treated with 0.5 mM arsenite (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 and
30 min at 37 °C or by heat-shocked at 43.5 °C for 1 h. For fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) studies, a Cy3-conjugated PCP2 oligonucleotide probe was
used to detect STAU1-PCP2 RNA granules in SCA2 FBs according to publish
method66. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100, and processed for immunostaining using corresponding pri-
mary and fluorescent secondary antibodies. The nuclei were stained with DAPI
followed by mounting with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Cat# 0100-01).
Paraffin-embedded brain slices from SCA2 patient were provided by Prof. Arnulf
H. Koeppen, M.D., Albany Medical College, New York, USA. Non-SCA2 control
paraffin-embedded brain slices were provided by Dr. Sonnen, Pathologist, Uni-
versity of Utah. Human tissues were maintained and processed under standard
conditions consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines and conformed
to an approved University of Utah IRB protocol. Isolated cerebella were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and then deparaffinized using stan-
dard conditions. For cryoprotected cerebella, free-floating sections were used for
immunostaining. Sections were blocked/permeabilized with 5% donkey serum
0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and processed for immunostaining. Images were
acquired using confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti microscopy) in lab or
University of Utah cell imaging core lab, and analyzed by Nikon EZ-C1 or NIS-
Elements AR 4.5 software. The co-localization plugin in ImageJ was used to define
co-localized areas via intensity-based thresholding. The Analyze Particles tool was
then used to count the number of co-localized areas greater than four pixels
(baseline). The following antibody dilutions were used for cellular immunostain-
ings: mouse anti-Ataxin-2 antibody (Clone 22/Ataxin-2) [(1:750), BD Biosciences,
Cat# 611378], rabbit anti-Staufen antibody [(1:750), Novus biologicals, NBP1-

Preparation of protein lysates and western blot analyses. Cellular extracts were
prepared by a single-step lysis method9,42. The harvested cells were suspended in
SDS–PAGE sample buffer [Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Cat# 161-0737)] and
then boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of the extracts were used for western blot
analyses. Cerebellar protein extracts were prepared by homogenization of mouse
cerebella in extraction buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5%
Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M urea and protease inhibitors
(Sigma-Aldrich, P8340)] followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000
RPM. Only supernatants were used for western blotting. Protein extracts were
resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to Hybond P membranes (Amersham
Bioscience, USA). After blocking with 4% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, the
membranes were processed for immunostaining using corresponding primary and
secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by using the Immobilon Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (EMD Millipore, WBKLS0500) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Blot images were scanned and band intensities were
quantified by ImageJ software analyses after inversion of the images, and the
relative protein abundances were expressed as ratios to β-Actin. Detailed western
blots for main figures in text are presented in Supplementary Figs. 6–14.
Immunoprecipitations. To determine protein–protein or protein–RNA interac-
tions, we carried out protein–RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using
HEK-293 cells expressing Flag-ATXN2-Q22 and Flag-ATXN2-Q108 or Flag-
STAU1. The preparation of whole-cell extracts and IP methods followed previously
published methods9,42. First, cells were lysed with a cytoplasmic extraction buffer
[25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2
and protease inhibitors] and cytoplasmic extracts were separated by centrifugation
at 14,000 RPM for 20 min. Second, the resultant pellets were suspended in nuclear
lysis buffer or high salt lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5%
Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitors), and the
nuclear extracts were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 20 min. The
nuclear extracts were then combined with the cytoplasmic extracts and denoted
whole-cell extracts. Specifically, while combining cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts,
the NaCl concentration was adjusted to physiologic buffer conditions (~ 150 mM)
to preserve in vivo interactions. For identifying non-RNA mediated interactions,
whole-cell extracts were treated with 1.0 mg/ml RNase A (Amersham Bioscience,
USA) for 15 min at 37 °C before subjected to IP. Ninety percent of cell extracts
were subjected to Flag monoclonal antibody (mAb) IP (Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel,
Sigma-Aldrich, A2220-1ML) to immunoprecipitate ATXN2 or STAU1 interacting
protein–RNA complexes. The remaining 10% of whole-cell extracts were saved as

 the input control for western blotting and RT-PCR analyses. The IPs were washed
with a buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and the bound protein–protein or
protein–RNA complexes were eluted from the beads with Flag peptide competition
(100 μg/ml) (Flag Peptide, Sigma-Aldrich, F3290-4MG). Eluted fractions were
divided into two equal parts. One part was analyzed by SDS–PAGE followed by
western blotting to determine interactions between ATXN2 and STAU1. RNA was
isolated from the other fraction and subjected to RT-PCR analyses to identify
RNAs that bound to STAU1.
In vitro RNA-binding (Northwestern) assay. Northwestern blot assays were
performed following a published protocol with some modifications67. BL21 < DE3
> cells carrying His-STAU1, His-GFP and empty pET vectors, were grown to mid-
log phase. Whole-cell lysates from harvested cells were run on SDS–PAGE and
electro-blotted onto a Hybond P membrane. The transferred proteins were re-
natured as follows: the blot was first incubated with binding buffer (0.1 M HEPES,
pH 7.9, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl and 0.5 μM ZnSO4) with 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) and 6 M urea for 5 min at room temperature. The blots were then incu-
bated, for 5 min each, through five serial twofold dilutions of urea with binding
buffer/1 mM DTT with continuing incubation steps until the binding buffer was
1 mM DTT without urea. Blot pre-hybridizations were carried out with binding
buffer (1 mM DTT, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 μg/ml yeast tRNA) for
1 h at room temperature. The blots were then hybridized with DIG-labeled RNA
probes in binding buffer (1 mM DTT, 0.25% BSA and 1 μg/ml yeast tRNA)
overnight at 4 °C. After several washes with 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, the membranes
were incubated with anti-DIG-POD antibody in 4% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/
PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Following three additional washes with 0.1%
Tween 20/PBS, signals were detected by using the Immobilon Western Chemilu-
minescent HRP Substrate according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA expression analyses by quantitative RT-PCR. Mice were deeply anesthe-
tized with isoflurane. Mouse cerebella were removed and immediately submerged
in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were kept at −80 °C until the time of processing. Total
RNA was extracted from mouse cerebella and from harvested cells using the
RNaeasy mini-kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, USA). DNAse
I treated RNAs were used to synthesize cDNAs using the ProtoScript cDNA
synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in
QuantStudio 12 K (Life Technologies, USA) with the Power SYBR Green
PCRMaster Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) using University of Utah genomics
core lab. PCR reaction mixtures contained SYBR Green PCRMaster mix, synthe-
sized cDNA and 0.5 pmol primers, and PCR amplifications were carried out for 45
cycles: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s and extension at
72 °C for 40 s. The threshold cycle for each sample was chosen from the linear
range and converted to a starting quantity by interpolation from a standard curve
run on the same plate for each set of primers. All gene expression levels were
normalized to ACTB or GAPDH or Actb mRNA levels. Primer pairs designed for
qRT-PCR and RT-PCR are given as forward and reverse, respectively, and listed in
Supplementary Table 2.
Rotarod testing. Following genotyping mice were randomly assigned to cages
according to sex, ensuring that each possible genotype was represented in each
cage. During the five days of testing, mice were taken to a separate testing room
and allowed to habituate for 1 h. Testing began at the same time every day and was
completed by the same technician. The technician was blinded to the genotypes of
the mice in each cage. On day 1 mice were handled for 2 min per mouse. On day 2
mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod apparatus (Rotamex-5, Columbus
Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) initially rotating at 4 RPM for 2 min. The rate
of rotation was increased by 1 RPM per every 15 s to 10 RPM for 60 s. On days 3–5,
mice were tested on the accelerating rotarod from 0 RPM with acceleration
increasing by 1 RPM every 9 s until the maximum speed of 51 RPM was reached
(maximum time of 459 s). The time that a mouse fell (latency to fall) from the
rotating bar was recorded. Statistical comparisons of rotarod data were determined
using the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the independent
correlation option using Stata 12 (procedures xtset followed by xtgee).
Statistical analysis. Student’s t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used
to determine whether differences between groups were significant. The level of
significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 and ns = P >
0.05. Means ± SD are presented throughout, unless otherwise specified.
