In Brief
Vertebrate IgA molecules possess a
conserved N-linked glycosylated
C-terminal tail. Maurer et al. show that
sialic acid found in the complex
glycosylation of the C-terminal tail of
human IgA1 inhibits sialic-acid-binding
viruses and, therefore, may constitute an
additional line of innate immunity.

SUMMARY
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays an important role in
protecting our mucosal surfaces from viral infec-
tion, in maintaining a balance with the commensal
bacterial flora, and in extending maternal immunity
via breast feeding. Here, we report an additional
innate immune effector function of human IgA mol-
ecules in that we demonstrate that the C-terminal
tail unique to IgA molecules interferes with cell-sur-
face attachment of influenza A and other enveloped
viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. This anti-
viral activity is mediated by sialic acid found in the
complex N-linked glycans at position 459. Antiviral
activity was observed even in the absence of clas-
sical antibody binding via the antigen binding sites.
Our data, therefore, show that the C-terminal tail of
IgA subtypes provides an innate line of defense
against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor
and the role of neuraminidases present on these
virions.
INTRODUCTION
Vaccination against influenza A viruses relies on the induction of
strain-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and has to be
repeated annually. Rare heterosubtypic antibodies, i.e., anti-
bodies that are able to neutralize multiple strains and subtypes
of influenza virus, can be found in most individuals (Corti et al.,
2010; Kohler et al., 2014) but currently cannot specifically be
induced by immunization.
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) exists as monomeric molecules in
serum or as dimeric secretory IgA on mucosal surfaces.
Although roughly three quarters of the daily antibody production
(i.e., about 3 mg) are of the IgA isotype (Delacroix et al., 1982),
IgA deficiency is frequent (�1 in 300–600 individuals) and mostly
asymptomatic (Janzi et al., 2009). IgA-deficient mice exhibit an
enhanced susceptibility to influenza A virus infection and display
impaired T helper cell priming (Arulanandam et al., 2001). In
humans and great apes, two IgA subtypes are found: IgA1 that
is characterized by a 23-amino-acid (aa)-long and heavily O-gly-
cosylated hinge region, and a conserved C-terminal tail of
19 amino acids that interacts with the J chain and secretory
chain to mediate dimerization (Correa et al., 2013) and that con-
tains a N-linked glycosylation site. IgA2 more closely resembles
the IgA isotypes of other vertebrates (Rogers et al., 2008), and it
also possesses a C-terminal tail, but its shorter hinge region is
devoid of O-linked glycosylation.
All Ig isotypes contain complex N-linked glycosylation: while
about 10% of the N-linked glycans in IgG1 contain sialic acid
(Wuhrer et al., 2007) over 90% of the N-linked glycans are sialy-
lated in IgA1. Monomeric and secretory IgA1 glycosylation of
CH2 at position 263 is predominantly of the biantennary type
with a2–6-linked sialic acids, while CH3 glycans at position
459 are of the triantennary type, with a2–6 and a2–3 linkage in
their sialic acids (Mattu et al., 1998; Royle et al., 2003).
Recent reports also suggest that heterosubtypic IgA has a
more potent antiviral activity against influenza viruses than IgG
(He et al., 2015; Muramatsu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2013). Some
of these observations could be explained by immune-geography,
i.e., IgA’s preferred secretion into the pulmonary lumen and
increased avidity due to multimerization. Moreover, it has been
shown that both IgA and secretory component are important me-
diators of innate immunity against various bacterial pathogens:

 sialic acids on secretory IgA (sIgAs) inhibit attachment of S-
fimbriated Escherichia coli (Schroten et al., 1998), while N-linked
glycosylation of secretory component (alone or as part of sIgA)
has been shown to compete with Helicobacter pylori for recep-
tors (Bore
´ n et al., 1993) and was shown to bind to Escherichia
coli (de Oliveira et al., 2001; Wold et al., 1990), toxin A from Clos-
tridium difficile (Dallas and Rolfe, 1998), and Streptococcus
pneumonia (Hammerschmidt et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000).
To assess the impact of glycosylation and hinge length on the
activity of heterosubtypic antibodies to influenza A virus, mono-
clonal antibodies (mAbs) 1.12 (Wyrzucki et al., 2015) and 3.1
(Wyrzucki et al., 2014) were recombinantly expressed as human
IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, and IgA2 molecules, and their in vitro antiviral
activity was characterized.
RESULTS
Using isotypevariants ofinfluenzaA virus-specificheterosubtypic
mAbs 3.1 and 1.12, the impact of the antibody isotype on the
neutralizing activity in vitro was assessed. While all IgG
subtypes had comparable neutralizing activities, both IgA sub-
typemonomerswere10-to1,000-foldmorepotentthan IgG1,de-
pending on the mAb and isolate tested (Figures 1 and S1). Overall,
the isotype-dependent activity differences were less prominent in

human compared to avian isolates, and
the most prominent difference in neutrali-
zation was seen with mAb 3.1 against
reassortant
rg-A/Chicken/Vietnam/C58/
2004 (H5N3). This enhanced antiviral ac-
tivity could not be attributed to the longer
hinge of IgA1, as IgA2 with its shorter hinge was also more potent,
while IgG3, with the longest hinge, neutralized similarly to IgG1
(Figure 1). There were no differences in avidity for hemagglutinin
(HA) detected for the different isotype variants (Figure S2).
To identify the domain of the Ig molecule responsible for this
increased potency, chimeric molecules were prepared by
exchanging the CH1 the hinge, and the CH2/CH3 domains
from IgA1 and IgG1 with each other. The neutralizing activity of
these chimeric molecules revealed that, although the hinge
region has some impact on the antibody’s potency, the

phenotype
segregated
with
the
CH2-CH3 portion. To address the impact of the C-terminal tail
with its additional N-linked glycosylation site, variants of mAb
3.1 IgA1 were prepared in which the glycosylation sites in CH2
and CH3 (Kabat positions 263 and 459) were removed. While
the non-glycosylated N263D and N263D/N459D variants ex-
pressed well, the N459D did not express. Loss of both the
CH2 and CH3 glycosylation, but not of the glycosylation in
CH2 alone, abolished the improved neutralizing activity (Fig-
ure 2), indicating that the N-linked glycosylation at the N459D
position is essential. The requirement for the complexity of the
glycosylation was assessed by expression of mAb 3.1 IgA1 in
293S cells devoid of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI),
which traps N-linked glycosylation at Man5GlcNAc2 (Reeves

 et al., 2002). The resulting oligomannose-type glycoform of 3.1
IgA1 antibody only neutralized as potently as IgG1, indicating
that the increased neutralizing activity of the IgA1 isotype had
its origin in the complex N-linked glycosylation in the C-terminal
tail of CH3. As this glycan is reportedly sialylated (Mattu et al.,
1998), and since influenza A viruses use sialic acid as a receptor,
IgA1 and IgG1 of mAb 3.1 were treated either with a2–3-specific
neuramindase from Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (NA S) or with
2–3,6,8,9-specific neuraminidase A from Arthrobacter ureafa-
ciens (NA A). Both neuraminidase treatments resulted in reduced
neutralizing antibody titers compared to the untreated IgA1
molecule, indicating that removal of sialic acid—in particular,
that of a2–3-linked sialic acid—sufficed to reduce the potency
of the IgA1 molecules considerably. The neuraminidase treat-
ment also slightly reduced the neutralizing activity of the virtually
unsialylated mAb 3.1 IgG1 molecules, suggesting additional loss
of activity unrelated to the respective glycosidase activity.
To test whether C-terminal sialylation was interfering with
receptor binding, hemagglutination inhibition assays were per-
formed.
Although
stem-specific
heterosubtypic
antibodies
should not inhibit hemagglutination, IgA1 of both mAb 3.1 and
mAb 1.12 prevented hemagglutination by rg-A/Chicken/Viet-
nam/C58/2004 (H5N3) and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (Fig-
ure 2). By contrast, IgG1 or IgA1 molecules lacking complex
glycosylation, i.e., IgA1S and IgA1 N263D/N459D, failed to
inhibit hemagglutination (Figure 2D). Hence, receptor binding
of influenza A viruses is likely competed by the complex N-linked
glycans from the IgA tail. Interestingly, when antibody and virus
were incubated for a prolonged period of time, the differences
between IgG1 and IgA1 vanished, suggesting that the viral neur-
aminidase was capable of removing the antibody’s sialic acids
(Figure 2E).
To test whether this receptor-site blockage requires binding of
the Fab portion of the antibody, the ability of HIV-1-specific
mAbs b12 IgA1 and IgA2 to neutralize rg-A/Chicken/Vietnam/
C58/2004 (H5N3) and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was tested.
Surprisingly, HIV-1 gp120-specific b12 IgA1 was able to
neutralize the avian but not the human isolate, while b12 IgA2
was able to neutralize both viruses (Figure 3). This observation
is in line with lectin blots demonstrating a predominance of
a2–6-linked sialic acid in our IgA2 preparation (data not shown).
Since neither b12 IgG1 nor b12 IgA1 grown in 293S cells, nor b12
IgA2 samples depleted from antibodies using CaptureSelect
beads (IgA-CH1 (Hu)) displayed antiviral activity (Figure 3A),
the observed inhibition must originate from the complex sugars
of the IgA molecules and not from a contaminant. H5 head-spe-
cific mAb C65c6 did not display non-specific neutralization of
A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) and only displayed small isotype-
dependent changes in activity against rg-A/Chicken/Vietnam/
C58/2004 (H5N3) (Figure 3), indicating that this IgA-effect may
not apply to all antibodies to the same extent and that Fab bind-
ing to the receptor binding site overrides the nonspecific effect.
Lastly, to test whether this observation was specific to influenza
A viruses, the antiviral activity of influenza-specific mAbs 1.12
and 3.1, as well as of HIV-1 gp41-specific 2F5, was tested
against another virus using sialic acid as a receptor—namely,
Newcastle disease virus (NDV). As depicted in Figure 3, IgA1,
but not IgG1, could neutralize the virus’s infectivity (Figure 3).
To further investigate the potential interaction between the
IgA1 and hemagglutinin, we visualized mAb 3.1 bound to recom-
binant HA from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) by negative stain
electron microscopy (EM). The reference-free class averages
for HA bound to IgG1 and IgA1 isotypes are shown in Figures 3
and S3. In the majority of class averages in both cases, two HA

 trimers are crosslinked by the bivalent arms of the antibody. The
relative orientation of the two HA trimers to one another differs
between the two antibodies: in IgG1-linked dimers, they were
predominantly found in opposite orientations, while the IgA1-
crosslinked HA trimers were found to be tethered head to head
by additional density, which could correspond to CH3 (Figure 4).
The HA and Fab components of the complexes were easily iden-
tifiable in the class averages, thereby enabling us to dock models
of the X-ray structure of HA bound to Fab 3.1 (PDB: 4PY8).
DISCUSSION
The recombinant antibodies used for this study were mono-
meric antibodies, while in the respiratory track, IgA is primarily
found as dimeric secretory IgA. To rule out the possibility that
our 293T-cell-expressed IgA displayed atypical glycosylation,
we analyzed the glycosylation of human secretory IgA isolated
from the saliva of two individuals by high-pressure liquid chro-
matography (HPLC). It was found that dimeric IgA contained
14.8%–17.3% terminal sialylation, while monomeric IgA was
found to contain between 10.5% and 27.4% terminally sialy-
lated complex glycans. a2–3linked sialic acid made up for
1.4%–6.7% of all complex glycans and was primarily found in
multiantennary N-linked glycans (Table 1; Figure S4). The pres-
ence of a2–3-linked sialic acid is, therefore, not artificial to our
expression system but can also be found on IgA expressed by
B cells. However, recombinant 3.1 IgA1 contained more sialic
acid than IgA isolated from saliva (Table 1), which may have
exacerbated the observed inhibitory effect of recombinant
IgA1.
The lack of dimerization in our expression system is likely to be
attributed to the expression system. In contrast to Chinese ham-
ster ovary (CHO) cells, which tend to produce a higher proportion
of dimeric IgA (Chintalacharuvu and Morrison, 1999; Moldt et al.,
2014), HEK293F or T cells primarily express monomeric IgA
(Lorin and Mouquet, 2015). However, as CHO cells are of non-
human origin and have been described to produce under-sialy-
lated IgA1 and -2 (Yoo et al., 2010), expression in HE293 cells

was preferred for this study. In human
serum, IgA is also primarily found as
monomeric molecules (Kerr, 1990), indi-
cating that this oligomerization form is
biologically common. Moreover, lack of
dimerization actually enabled a direct
comparison of IgA with IgG1, as their stoi-
chiometries of binding are identical. Last, the available 3D
models for secretory IgA1 (Bonner et al., 2009a) and IgA2 (Bon-
ner et al., 2009b) suggest that at least two of the four C-terminal
tails are unobstructed by the lateral binding of the secretory
component, indicating that, also in higher order complexes,
the C-terminal sialic acids would be exposed.
Fab-mediated attachment of the IgA molecules to the
conserved stem-epitope in the HA molecule helped to stabilize
the low-affinity interaction of sialic acid with HA. However, it
was rather unexpected to find that, even with nonspecific
mAbs such as b12 or 2F5, this 2- to 4-mM Kd affinity interaction
(Sauter et al., 1989; Watowich et al., 1994) was able to neutralize
the virus. However, for unknown reasons, this was not observed
for all antibody/virus combinations. Human influenza A viruses
were less sensitive to inhibition by the C-terminal tail glycans
than avian isolates, suggesting that they have evolved to over-
come this line of defense. Whether this is mediated by the HA
protein itself or whether it is due to the sialidase activity of the
viral neuramindase remains to be determined. Interestingly, as
described earlier, the affinity of HA for sialic acid is very low
compared to other attachment/receptor protein interactions
that are typically in the nanomolar range; therefore, there seems
to be no apparent need for a receptor-destroying enzyme. This
notion is further supported by the observation that the neuramin-
idases of recent human H3N2 isolates actually often fail to
release viruses bound to erythrocytes, indicating that their siali-
dase activity cannot hydrolyze the receptor preferably bound by
the HA of the same virus (Gulati et al., 2005). Therefore, we think
not only that neuraminidase’s function is to release progeny virus
but also that it plays an important role in coping with sialic acids
abundantly present in mucosal secretions (Baos et al., 2012;
Phalipon et al., 2002). As a matter of fact, many sialylated pro-
teins have been reported to inhibit the influenza A virus (IAV),
including human mucin (Baos et al., 2012) and a2-macroglobulin
(Pritchett and Paulson, 1989). These inhibitors have been classi-
fied to be of the a or g type, depending on whether the viral neur-
aminidase was able to hydrolyze the sialic acid moieties or not
(‘‘Francis effect’’; reviewed in Matrosovich and Klenk, 2003).
Cell Reports 23, 90–99, April 3, 2018

 The observation that a prolonged incubation of mAb 3.1 IgA1
with rg-A/Chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N3) abolished the
inhibitory advantage of IgA1 indeed suggests that the viral neur-
aminidase was able to hydrolyze IgA1’s sialic acids (Figure 2E),
thus classifying it as an a-type inhibitory protein for this strain.
By contrast, heavily tissue-culture- and mouse-adapted A/Pu-
erto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) appears to have lost this ability.
We, therefore, believe that the glycans of IgA are part of a
larger innate defense wall (sugar chainmail) against pathogens
using sialic acid as a receptor. However, in contrast to the other
proteins, the ability of IgA to attach to virus via the antigen-bind-
ing fragment enables it to generate effective local accumulations
of sialic acid and can thereby compensate for the poor kinetics of
the sialic acid/HA interaction. The importance of IgA’s sialylation
is further supported by the observation that, although IgA defi-
ciency is largely asymptomatic in humans, children with this
defect are more prone to pseudocroup caused by another
sialic-acid binding virus, human parainfluenza 1 virus (Fukush-
ima et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2016). Moreover, the higher sensi-
tivity of avian viruses for this glycan-mediated inhibition could
provide an additional innate line of defense to protect humans
from acquiring zoonotic infections.
It would have been highly desirable to complement our in vitro
findings with in vivo data; however, passive immunization of mice
with human IgA1 is problematic, as it has been shown to rapidly

induce elevated tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-a) levels and xenotypic anti-
bodies in the recipient (Shi et al., 2011).
Mice also only contain one IgA subtype,
which is a homolog to human IgA2, and
the murine FcaR does not effectively
recognize human IgA1 (Balu et al., 2011).
The efficacy at which human IgA1 would
be able to interact with the murine poly-
Ig receptor for transcytosis into mucosal
lumen is also hardly defined. Although it
has been shown that CH2 glycosylation does not affect binding
to FcaR (Gomes et al., 2008; Mattu et al., 1998), IgA sialylation
has been shown to affect its ability to activate complement (Ni-
kolova et al., 1994). As murine cells have been shown to produce
an IgA glycosylation pattern that is very distinct from that of the
human (Yoo et al., 2010), large parts of this study would have to
be repeated to characterize the glycan-mediated inhibitory prop-
erties of murine or murine-expressed IgA. Alternatively, all ap-
proaches to graft the IgA tail on IgG1 ended up with recombinant
molecules that did not assemble properly. Also, as reported
earlier, removal of the C-terminal glycosylation site alone was
not tolerated and resulted in proteins that did not fold properly.
Taken together, although highly desirable, a considerable effort
is required to establish a small animal system capable of sepa-
rating the effect of the C-terminal glycosylation from other
factors. Moreover, since mice represent a rather artificial exper-
imental system for IAV infection, it is questionable whether these
considerable efforts would be justified and actually helped to
clarify the importance of the presented findings for human
infection.
It has been noted that different B cell lineages have different
glycosylation signatures and that these signatures have a sub-
stantial impact on the antibodies’ effector functions (Ackerman
et al., 2013). For instance, the presence or absence of fucosyla-
tion of the N263 glycan improves human IgG1’s ability to interact
94
Cell Reports 23, 90–99, April 3, 2018
 with FcgRIIIa on natural killer cells (Moldt et al., 2012).
Conversely, sialylation of the same glycan lowers its ability to
activate complement (Quast et al., 2015). Our findings further
strengthen the increasing recognition of the importance of Fc
glycosylation on antibody effector functions and suggest that
active vaccination aiming at generating heterosubtypic antibody
titers could gain effectiveness if the induced antibodies are of the
IgA isotype and if adjuvenation could be optimized to induce lin-
eages of highly sialylated IgA-producing B cells. Also, antibodies
for passive immunization could gain orders of magnitudes if the
advantages of both IgG1 and IgA1 could be combined.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Viruses and Cell Lines
Influenza A viruses used for this study were propagated in the amniotic cavity
of fertilized hen eggs, except A/FPV/Bratislava/1979 (H7N7) and rg-A/
Chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N3), which were propagated on Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cells (discussed later). rg-A/Chicken/Vietnam/C58/

Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), the neuraminidase from A/Duck/Germany/1215/1973
(H2N3), and a hemagglutinin from A/Chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1),
from which the polybasic cleavage site has been removed. GFP-expressing
Newcastle disease virus has been propagated as described in Park et al.
(2003).

Construction of pAbVec Isotype Variants
For the construction of the isotype variants, SalI and HindIII-flanked fragments
were synthesized corresponding to the spliced constant regions for IgA1
(GenBank:
NC_000014,
region
106173505..106175001),
IgA2
(GenBank:
AK126352), IgG2 (GenBank: NC_000014, region 106109540..106111126), IgG3
(GenBank: K01313), and IgG4 (GenBank: K01316) and were cloned into pAb-
Vec-IgG1-3.1 a SalI-HindIII cassette. For the corresponding 1.12, b12, C65c6,
and 2F5 constructs, the AgeIxSalI containing their V-region cassettes were
cloned into the isotype variants of the 3.1 containing pAbVec constructs. The
sequence of the original pAbVec-IgG1 can be accessed at GenBank: FJ475055.
Construction of IgA1/IgG1 Chimeric Antibodies
IgG/IgA-chimeric variants of mAbs 1.12 and 3.1 were constructed by fusion
PCR using primers listed above. In brief, forward and reverse primers were
used in a PCR with pAbVec-IgG1-1.12 and pAbVec-IgA1-3.1 as a template.
The resulting fragments were gel purified and fused through the second ampli-
fication using forward primer of first fragment and reverse primer of second
fragment and Pfu polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Primers used for amplification of the fragments were: GAAA-G-Fw-IgG1-

Different recombinant isotypes of mAb 3.1 as well as IgA from two adult male Caucasians purified from saliva were run on SDS-PAGE to separate
dimeric from monomeric forms. The corresponding gel bands were excised, and the N-linked glycans were released from the protein by PNGase
digestion and further subjected to digestion with specific glycosylases (EndoH, a2–3,6,8 neuraminidase, b1,4-galactosidase, a-L-fucosidase, b-N-
acetylglucosaminidase, a(1-2,3,6)-mannosidase). Differential analysis by HILIC-UPLC was then performed, and the percentages were determined
by the sum of the areas under the specific peaks over the area under all peaks.

 separated by a dash from the fragment and followed by the priming direction
and the further designations.
1 mg fusion PCR product and pAbVec-IgG1-1.12 plasmid were digested with
Sal l and Hind III, gel purified, quantified, and ligated into the digested back-
bone using T4 Ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 20 min
at room temperature (RT). The ligated product was then transformed into
50 mL chemically competent E. coli. After sequencing of the mini-preparations,
maxi-preparations of positive clones were performed using the PureYield
Plasmid Maxiprep System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). For the generation
of the mAb 3.1 variants, the variable region cassette of 1.12 was exchanged for
that of 3.1, using SalI and AgeI digestion in all chimeric plasmids.
PCR thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95�C; (20 s at 95�C;
1 min at 68�C; 30 s at 72�C) 3 30; 10 min at 72�C; N at 4�C. Fusion PCR ther-
mal cycling conditions were as follows: fragment assembly for chimeric IgG1/
IgA1: 5 min at 95�C; 2 min at 72�C (ramping rate [dT] 0.1�C/s); N at 4�C. Ampli-
fication was as follows: 2 min at 95�C; (20 s at 95�C; 1.5 min at 68�C; 30 s at
72�C) 3 30; 10 min at 72�C; N at 4�C.
Construction of Glycosylation Variants
N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences located at position 263 of CH2 or
459 of CH3 of the IgA1 Fc were removed from the pAbVec-IgA1-3.1 plasmid by
site-directed mutagenesis converting the asparagine of the consensus into
aspartic acid. To this end, primer pairs QC-N264D-Rv/QC-N264D-Fw and
QC-N459D-Rv,/QC-N459D-Fw and the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For all other specificities, the AgeI-SalI cassette,
containing the V region, was exchanged, as described earlier.
Recombinant Antibodies
For transfection, either 2.5 3 106 HEK293T or 2.5 3 106 HEK293S cells were
seeded into 15-cm tissue culture plates (TPP, Techno Plastic Products, Trasa-
dingen, Switzerland) in 15 mL D10 medium 1 day before transfection. Tissue
culture flasks were coated with poly-L-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) before seeding HEK293S cells. For the transfections, 21.5 mg of the
H- and L-chain-expressing plasmids were diluted in 450 mL of 1 M NaCl and
adjusted to a final volume of 1 mL with double-deionised water (ddH2O). In par-
allel, 180 mL of 1 mg/mL polyethylenimine (PEI; molecular weight [MW], 25,000;
Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) were diluted into 1 mL of ddH2O. Both
solutions were then mixed together, mixed immediately, and incubated at
RT for 20 min. 3 mL of the DNA/NaCl/PEI complex solution was then added
to each transfection plate. Cells were incubated at 37�C, 5% CO2, and 95%
humidity for 7 hr before transfection medium was exchanged with 30 mL
pre-warmed complete D10. After 6 days of incubation at 37�C/5% CO2, super-
natants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 3,700 relative centrif-
ugal force (rcf) for 15 min and were sterile filtered at 0.2 mm (TPP, Trasadingen,
Switzerland). The filter membrane was washed with the same volume of
Protein L (ProtL) binding buffer (23 mM NaH2PO4, 77 mM Na2HPO4 , 2H2O,
150 mM NaCl [pH 7.2]) and volume adjusted to 1 L with ddH2O.
Antibody Purification
All
antibodies
were
affinity

using

Beads
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Abs were eluted by 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7). The pH was
immediately adjusted to a pH of 7 by adding 1 M Tris (pH 8.5). The procedure
was repeated once to increase yields.
Size Exclusion Chromatography
To remove contaminating kappa dimers and free heavy chains, and to perform
a buffer exchange, antibodies were additionally purified by size exclusion
chromatography. To this end, a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 column (GE
Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) was equilibrated in PBS before the antibody
in elution buffer was loaded, and separation was run at 3 mL/min. Antibody
fractions were identified according to their in-line absorbance at 280 nm and
used for further analysis. The purity of all fractions was assessed by non-
reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by subsequent silver staining. Fractions
containing the correctly assembled antibodies were pooled. Since molecular
ultrafiltration leads to considerable loss of IgA, pooled antibody fractions
were transferred into 3.5-kDa MWCO dialysis tubes (Spectra/Por, Spectrum,
Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) and concentrated via reverse osmosis by
sprinkling the tubes with 1–3 g of polyethylene glycol 35000 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Buchs, Switzerland).
Silver Staining of PAGE Gels
Gels were fixed in 100 mL 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, and 50% ddH2O
for 25 min. After being washed with water for 25 min, gels were incubated in
50% ethanol for another 25 min. Gels were then incubated in 100 mL ddH2O
containing 16.7 mg Na2S2O3 for 1.5 min. Gels were washed three times with
ddH2O and incubated with 0.26 g (w/v) AgNO3 and 250 mL of 36% (w/v) form-
aldehyde for 10 min. After an additional washing step, gels were developed in a
solution containing 2 g (w/v) Na2CO3, 42 mL of a 10% (w/v) Na2S2O3 and 42 mL
of 36% (w/v) formaldehyde until the protein bands became visible. The reac-
tion was then stopped by the addition of a 5% (w/v) acetic acid solution.
IgA2 Depletion
10 mL CaptureSelect IgA-CH1 (Hu) Affinity Matrix (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) was washed two times with 1 mL PBS. The slurry was
centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. 30 mL of b12 IgA2 (9.32 mg)
was incubated with 10 mL prewashed CaptureSelect IgA-CH1 (Hu) Affinity
Matrix at RT on a rotor wheel for 1 hr. The mix was then centrifuged at
10,000 rcf for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to another 10 mL
prewashed beads. The process was repeated a total of four times. 21.9 mL
from the depleted b12 IgA2 solution was used for neutralization assays.
Lectin Blots
To determine the glycosylation pattern, 1 mg/mL reduced Ab was loaded on a
10% SDS-PAGE gel. After separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocel-
lulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) using a semi-dry blotting
system (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell, Hercules, CA, USA).
Membranes were then blocked with a casein containing western blocking
reagent (Roche, 11921673001, Mannheim, Germany) in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS; 50 mM Tris-Cl in ddH2O [pH 7.6]) overnight. Blots were washed twice
with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of
biotinylated Maackia Amurensis Lectin II (Vector Laboratories; binds a2-3 sialic
acid [SA]) in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 or a 1:1,000 dilution of biotinylated
Elderberry Bark Lectin (Vector Laboratories; binds a2-6 SA) in TBS +
0.1 mM CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2 + 0.1% western blot (WB) blocking reagent +
0.1% Tween 20. After washing six times with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min,
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:2,000 in TBS was added
and incubated for 30 min. Membranes were washed again six times with TBS +
0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min and rinsed once with TBS. Membranes were devel-
oped using chemiluminiscent enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate
and a LAS 4000 Mini chemiluminescent image analyzer (ImageQuant, GE
Healthcare, Amersham, UK).
Neuraminidase Treatment
Neuraminidase S (a2-3: New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and neur-
aminidase A (a2-3,6,8,9: New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were
used to desialylate IgA1. To this end, 2 mg IgA variants were combined with
H2O, to a total volume of 8 mL, and 1 mL 103 Glycobuffer 1 (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). 1 ml neuraminidase was added before the mixture
was incubated at 37�C for 1 hr.
Binding Assay: ELISA
The ELISA 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria) were
coated with 4 mg/mL recombinant HA from different influenza A viruses in
PBS at RT for 1 hr. Plates were then washed 3 times with TBS + 0.1% Tween
20 in an ELx405 Select CW plate washer (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT,
USA) and blocked with TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 5% milk at RT for another
hour. Ab variants (20 mg/mL) were diluted 3-fold in TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 and 0.1% milk, transferred to the plates, and incubated at RT for 1 hr. After
washing three times, goat a-human IgK HRP was used as a detection Ab at a
dilution of 1:5,000. The 384-well plates were incubated at RT for another hour
before they were washed 3 times. To develop the assay, TMB substrate
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added. After 2 to 4 min,
96
Cell Reports 23, 90–99, April 3, 2018
 2 M H2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) was used to stop the reaction.
The absorbance at 450 nm was then detected in an EnVision Multiplate Plate
Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, USA) was used to perform non-linear regression of logarithmized
data to the Hill Equation.
Influenza A Virus Neutralization Assay
Each well of a black 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria)
was seeded with MDCK cells in 50 mL D10 medium. Plates were incubated at
37�C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity overnight. The next day, 3-fold dilutions of
the Ab, starting at 40 mg/mL in infectious media, i.e., DMEM supplemented
with 0.2% BSA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), penicillin/strep-
tomycin (Pen/Strep), Glutamax, and 10 mM HEPES (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA)], were produced and transferred into a white 384-well
plate. Virus diluted to an MOI of 4 was added into the wells with the diluted
Ab, resulting in an initial mAb concentration of 20 mg/mL and a MOI of 2.
The plates were then incubated at 37�C (5% CO2) for 2 hr before the Ab/virus
mix was transferred to the corresponding wells of the plates containing the
MDCK cells that were washed once with PBS using an ELx405 Select CW plate
washer. Infection was then allowed to proceed at 37�C/5% CO2 for another
hour before the non-adsorbed virus and Abs were washed away with PBS.
Then, 50 mL infection media was added to each well, and plates were
incubated at 37�C (5% CO2) for 6 hr. After incubation, plates were fixed with
absolute methanol and stained with 2–4 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled mAb HB65 (ATCC HB-65) in PBS + 1% BSA at 4�C overnight.
Cells were washed three times with PBS the next day, and 40 mL PBS was
added before fluorescence at 505 nm was determined at 16 locations of
each well in an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA). The average values from all measurements in a well were then loaded
into Prism 6 software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and normal-
ized against the median values of the control wells, and a non-linear regression
of logarithmized data to the Hill Equation was performed.
Newcastle Disease Virus Neutralization Assay
Six thousand Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were seeded in 15 mL medium into
each well of a black 384-well plate on the day before the assay. The next
day, samples were diluted in a 3-fold dilution series starting from 40 mg/mL
in infectious media, which lacked the phenol red dye and only had 5% FBS
added. A recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing GFP with an MOI
4 was added, leading to a final virus concentration of an MOI of 2. After the
Ab/virus mix was transferred to cells, then the plates were incubated at
37�C (5% CO2) for 24 hr. The fluorescence at 505 nm was determined at 16
locations of each well in an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader. The average
value from all measurements in a well were then loaded into Prism 6 software
and normalized against the median values of the control well, and a non-linear
regression of logarithmized data to the Hill Equation was performed.
Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay
To determine the optimal virus-to-erythrocyte ratio, 50 mL 2-fold virus stock
dilutions were prepared in V-shaped 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Krems-
muenster, Austria). The same volume of a 1% chicken red blood cell (CRBC;
Bell Food Group, Basel, Switzerland) suspension was then added to each
well and incubated at RT for 30 to 60 min until CRBC pellets had formed in
the negative control.
After quantifying the optimal virus-to-red blood cell (RBC) concentration,
50 mL of serial 2-fold dilutions of mAbs were prepared, starting at a concentra-
tion of 200 mg/mL, and mixed with 50 mL of the optimal virus dilution. After
30-min incubation at 4�C, 50 mL of a 0.5% CRBC suspension were added to
all columns, resulting in a maximal mAb concentration of 25 mg/mL. Plates
were incubated at RT until CRBC pellets could be observed in the negative
control.
Negative Stain EM
Antibody/HA complexes were formed by incubating 50 mg recombinant HA
from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) with 150 mg of antibody in PBS at 4�C over-
night. High-molecular-weight complexes were then isolated by size exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Health-
care, Amersham, UK). Complexes were then added onto carbon-coated cop-
per mesh grids and stained with 1% uranyl formate for 30 s. Samples were
imaged on a Tecnai F12 microscope using the automated image acquisition
software Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005), and images were acquired on a Tietz
4k CMOS detector at a magnification of 52,0003 and a final pixel size of 2.05
Ǻ. Raw images were automatically uploaded into the Appion database (Lander
et al., 2009). Particles were individually picked from raw images using DoG
Picker (Voss et al., 2009), placed into a stack, and binned by 2. Reference-
free
two-dimensional
classification
was
done
using
multi-reference
alignment/multivariant-statistical analysis (MRA/MSA) (van Heel et al., 1996).
Class averages that did not correspond to HA were removed from subsequent
analyses. Raw particle picks from a clean stack were then subjected to two-
dimensional classification by iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC)
(Yang et al., 2012). UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) was used to dock
crystal structures and for figure generation.
Purification of IgA from Human Saliva
For the purification of human IgA, two male Caucasian volunteers aged
between 30 and 45 years collected between 30 and 35 mL of saliva by repet-
itive spitting into a 50-ml tube on ice. Saliva was then clarified by centrifugation
at 4,000 rpm and 4�C for 20 min. 20 mL of the clarified saliva was mixed with
20 mL of ProtL binding buffer. Saliva IgA was then affinity purified via 1 mL of
Protein L slurry and buffer exchanged as described earlier.
Enzymatic Release and Fluorescent Labeling of N-Linked Glycans
The secretory IgA samples isolated from saliva of two individuals were
fractionated by SDS-PAGE Novex NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4%–12% pre-cast gels
(Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). After being alternately washed with acetoni-
trile and water for five times, the excised gel bands were incubated with protein
N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; 500 U/mL; New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire,
UK) in a reaction buffer (50 mM NaHCO3 [pH 7.4]) at 37�C for 16 hr. The
released glycans were extracted from the gel matrix by washing three times
with water and then dried in a SpeedVac Concentrator Plus (Eppendorf,
Stevenage, UK). The glycan samples were resuspended in 30 mL water,
followed by incubation at 80�C for 1 hr in 80 mL labeling mixture containing
3% (w/v) 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA), 4.5% w/v sodium cyanoborohydride,
4% w/v sodium acetate trihydrate, and 2% w/v boric acid in methanol.
Removal of excess label from the 2-AA fluorescently labeled glycan samples
was performed using Speed Amide-2 cartridges (Applied Separations, Allen-
town, PA).
Exoglycosidase Sequencing of N-Linked Glycans
The 2-AA labeled glycans were sequentially digested using the following
exoglycosidases according to the manufacturers’ instructions: a2-3,6,8
neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (New England Biolabs, Hertford-
shire, UK), a2-3 neuraminidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (New
England BioLabs, Hertfordshire, UK), b1,4-galactosidase from Bacteroides
fragilis (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK), and a-L-fucosidase from
bovine kidney (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), b-N-acetylglucosaminidase from
Xanthomonas manihotis (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK), and
a(1–2,3,6)-mannosidase from Jack bean (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Endo-
glycosidase H (endoH) from Streptomyces picatus (New England BioLabs,
Hertfordshire, UK) was used for quantification of oligomannose structures.
Prior to chromatographic analysis, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) protein-
binding membrane plates (Millipore, Feltham, UK) were used for the removal
of enzymes.
Chromatographic Analysis of N-Linked Glycans
Analysis of the fluorescently labeled N-linked glycans was performed using
hydrophilic interaction chromatography-ultra-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HILIC-UPLC), with the 2-AA-labeled glucose homopolymer ladder
(Ludger, Abingdon, UK) being used as a calibration standard. The following
gradient was run on a 2.1 mm 3 10 mm (1.7-mm particle size) ACQUITY

 0% B; and t = 46.5: 22% A, 78% B (0.5 mL/min), where solvent A was 50 mM
ammonium formate (pH 4.4) and solvent B was acetonitrile. Fluorescence was
measured using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and a detection wave-
length of 428 nm. Data processing was performed using Empower 3 software.
The percentage of abundance of oligomannose- and that of complex-type
glycans were calculated by integration of the relevant peak areas before and
after EndoH digestion, following normalization.
