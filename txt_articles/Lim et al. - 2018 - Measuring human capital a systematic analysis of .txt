Summary
Background Human capital is recognised as the level of education and health in a population and is considered an 
important determinant of economic growth. The World Bank has called for measurement and annual reporting of 
human capital to track and motivate investments in health and education and enhance productivity. We aim to provide 
a new comprehensive measure of human capital across countries globally.
Methods We generated a period measure of expected human capital, defined for each birth cohort as the expected 
years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and 
functional health status using rates specific to each time period, age, and sex for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. We 
estimated educational attainment using 2522 censuses and household surveys; we based learning estimates on 
1894 tests among school-aged children; and we based functional health status on the prevalence of seven health 
conditions, which were taken from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016). 
Mortality rates specific to location, age, and sex were also taken from GBD 2016.
Findings In 2016, Finland had the highest level of expected human capital of 28·4 health, education, and learning-
adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years (95% uncertainty interval 27·5–29·2); Niger had the lowest 
expected human capital of less than 1·6 years (0·98–2·6). In 2016, 44 countries had already achieved more than 
20 years of expected human capital; 68 countries had expected human capital of less than 10 years. Of 195 countries, 
the ten most populous countries in 2016 for expected human capital were ranked: China at 44, India at 158, USA at 
27, Indonesia at 131, Brazil at 71, Pakistan at 164, Nigeria at 171, Bangladesh at 161, Russia at 49, and Mexico at 104. 
Assessment of change in expected human capital from 1990 to 2016 shows marked variation from less than 2 years of 
progress in 18 countries to more than 5 years of progress in 35 countries. Larger improvements in expected human 
capital appear to be associated with faster economic growth. The top quartile of countries in terms of absolute change 
in human capital from 1990 to 2016 had a median annualised growth in gross domestic product of 2·60% 
(IQR 1·85–3·69) compared with 1·45% (0·18–2·19) for countries in the bottom quartile.
Interpretation Countries vary widely in the rate of human capital formation. Monitoring the production of human 
capital can facilitate a mechanism to hold governments and donors accountable for investments in health and 
education.

Introduction
Human capital refers to the attributes of a population 
that, along with physical capital such as buildings, equip­
ment, and other tangible assets, contribute to economic 
productivity.1 Human capital is characterised as the 
aggregate levels of education, training, skills, and health 
in a population,2 affecting the rate at which technologies 
can be developed, adopted, and employed to increase 
productivity.3 The World Bank has brought new attention 
to this topic through its recently introduced Human 
Capital Project,4 which aims to “understand the link 
between investing in people and economic growth, and 
to accelerate financing for human capital invest 
ments.” 
A basic input needed for this aim to be fulfilled is 
an internationally comparable index of human capital, 
which currently does not exist. This study seeks to fill 
this global measurement gap.3
Although evidence supports human capital as a 
driver of growth, the World Bank has argued that invest­
ments in human capital are too low in low­income and 
middle­income countries.5 Much of the World Bank’s 
investments focus on physical rather than human 
capital.5 Only 1·5% of the World Bank International 
Development Association concessional grants are for 
health and 1·9% are for education.6 As countries graduate 
to borrowing from the non­concessional International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development framework, 
the shares for health increase to 4·2% and to 5·2% for 
education.6 A focus on building physical assets might 
also be driven by time horizons; such projects can yield

returns sooner than investing in children’s health and 
education, and the political process in many nations 
might reward short­run returns.6
Despite the inclusive scope of the theory of human 
capital, much of the initial research has focused on the 
average number of years of completed schooling,7 found 
to be associated with subsequent economic growth,8,9 
although the association is not consistent.3 Research that 
uses the distribution of education has found that it might 
explain more variation in economic growth than a simple 
average.10 In the past 5–10 years, analyses of around 
50 countries11–13 that further take into account the quality 
of education or learning, with the use of performance on 
international student assessments, find this measure 
is even more predictive of economic growth. Efforts 
to expand the measurement of human capital to also 
encompass functional health have been far fewer14,15 but 
suggest that health could also be important for under­
standing economic growth.3
Underinvestment in people might also be driven by a 
paucity of data; presently, regular and comparable reports 
on the rates of formation of human capital across all 
countries do not exist.5 Monitoring the expected forma­
tion of human capital in the next generation, as a 
measure of the effect of near­term investments in health 
and education, could facilitate a mechanism to hold 
countries and donors accountable to their populations 
for these investments.5
Building on past efforts, we have produced a measure 
of 
human 
capital 
that 
incorporates 
educational 
attainment, education quality or learning, functional 
health, and survival for 195 countries, by age and sex, 
from 1990 to 2016. For each country, we estimated the 
expected years of human capital, defined for each birth 
cohort as the expected years lived from 20 to 64 years of 
age and adjusted for educational attainment, learning, 
and functional health, if exposed to period­specific, age­
specific, and sex­specific rates of mortality, educational 
attainment, learning, and functional health status.
Methods
Overview
We did a systematic analysis of available data for 
195 countries from 1990 to 2016 to measure educational 
attainment, by sex and 5­year age groups (from 5 to 
64 years) for the in­school and working­age population, 
and learning, as measured by performance on stand­
ardised tests of mathematics, reading, and science by 
5­year age groups (from 5 to 19 years) for school­aged 
children. We constructed a measure of functional health 
status using the prevalence, by 5­year age groups, of 
seven health conditions for which evidence suggests a 
link to economic productivity using estimates from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) 2016.16 We also used mortality rates specific 
to location, age, sex, and year from GBD 2016.17
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous studies have examined the association between a 
range of dimensions of human capital and economic growth. 
These studies have shown that the average number of years of 
completed schooling is associated with subsequent economic 
growth and that incorporation of measures of the distribution 
of education might explain more of this variation. More recent 
analyses from the past 5–10 years that use performance on 
international student assessments as a measure of educational 
quality or learning find it to be a more predictive measure of 
economic growth than attainment alone. Far fewer efforts 
have been made to expand the measurement of human capital 
so that it also encompasses health; however, these studies 
suggest that an expanded measurement might also be 
important for understanding economic growth. Despite the 
accumulated evidence of the associations between the core 
dimensions of human capital—education and health—and 
economic growth, no comprehensive measure presently exists 
for all countries globally.
Added value of this study
This study provides a new measure of expected human capital 
for 195 countries, consisting of four components: educational 
attainment, learning, health, and survival, based on a 
systematic analysis of all available data. This measure, in units 
of health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived 
between age 20 and 64 years, is estimated each year from 1990 
to 2016 and can be updated annually. Compared with existing 
metrics of human capital, this more comprehensive measure 
provides a detailed characterisation of these differences across 
countries and over time, revealing marked variations in 
expected human capital for children born in different countries 
and differential progress in the improvement of expected 
human capital over the past 25 years. An inconsistent gender 
differential exists—for countries below approximately 10 years 
of expected human capital, this tends to be higher in males; for 
countries above this level, it is higher in females.
Implications of all the available evidence
Human capital is an important factor in economic development 
that requires improved metrics and regular monitoring. 
The systematic analysis of data on four components—
educational attainment, learning, health, and survival—
establishes the feasibility of an annual measurement of expected 
human capital, providing a means to monitor and assess 
investments in health and education. This more comprehensive 
measure of human capital has revealed variability across 
countries in building human capital that is independent of 
baseline levels of health and education, suggesting that building 
human capital is amenable to policy intervention.

Using these four dimensions—educational attainment, 
learning, functional health, and survival—we constructed 
an indicator of expected human capital that is sensitive to 
recent investments in health and education. Expected 
human capital is defined as the expected years lived 
from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational 
attainment, learning, and functional health, measured 
in units of health, education, and learning­adjusted 
expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. 
Expected human capital is calculated by exposing a 
hypothetical birth cohort to educational attainment, 
learning, functional health status, and mortality rates 
specific to time period, age, and sex. The measure is 
analogous to health­adjusted life expectancy. Expected 
human capital was calculated as follows:
where nLxt is the expected years lived in an age group x, 
for year t, in which age groups are defined as birth–6 days, 
7–27 days, 28 days–1 year, 1–4 years, and 5­year age 
groups thereafter; FHxt is the functional health status in 
an age group x, in year t, transformed to a 0–1 scale; l0 is 
the starting birth cohort; Eduxt is the years of education 
attained during an age group x, for year t; and Learnxt is 
the average standardised test score in an age group x, for 
year t, transformed to a 0–1 scale.
In other words, for a birth cohort born, for example, in 
the year 2000, we exposed the birth cohort to age and sex­
specific mortality rates for the year 2000 from birth to 
64 years. For each 5­year group from 20 to 64 years, we 
adjusted years lived by the cohort in each interval for age­
specific and sex­specific functional health status and 
calculated the number of adjusted years lived from 20 to 
64 years. From 5 to 24 years, we computed the expected 
number of learning­adjusted years of education by 
exposing the cohort to age­specific and sex­specific 
educational attainment rates adjusted for learning 
estimated for the year 2000. We summed and divided 
these estimates by the maximum possible learning­
adjusted years of education; we used 18 years, which is the 
commonly used maximum for educational attainment 
data.18 We used the subsequent ratio to adjust the health­
adjusted years lived from 20 to 64 years to produce the 
measure of expected human capital.
We did a sensitivity analysis (appendix) in which we 
took the mean instead of the product of learning­adjusted 
educational attainment and functional health when 
computing expected human capital.
Educational attainment
Estimates of average years of education were based on a 
compilation of 2522 censuses and household surveys. 
These data and the methods hereafter build on an 
approach used to produce a previously published dataset 
of international educational attainment.19 All data were 
top­coded to 18 years of education based on the practices 
of a common data provider.18 Each data source included 
information on the distribution of educational attainment 
by country, year, sex, and 5­year or 10­year age group. 
When years of schooling data were available only for 
multiyear bins—eg, the fraction of the population with 
between 6 and 9 years of completed education—we used 
a database of 1792 sources reporting single years of 
completed schooling to split these binned data into 
single­year distributions from 0 to 18 years on the basis 
of the average of the 12 closest distributions in terms of 
geographical proximity and year. From each of the 
subsequent data sources, we calculated the mean years of 
schooling by age and sex.
In the next step, we used age–cohort imputation to 
project observed cohorts through time, exploiting the 
relative constancy of education levels after 25 years 
of age. For any datapoint representing a cohort aged 
25 years or older, we extrapolated the data forward and 
backward so that it was represented in all year–age 
combinations for that cohort. For example, a datapoint 
reflecting a cohort aged 35–39 years in 2000 was projected 
forward for people aged 40–44 years in 2005, aged 
45–49 years in 2010, and so on. It was also projected 
backward for people aged 30–34 years in 1995 and people 
aged 25–29 years in 1990. After imputation, we fitted 
age–period models on all original input data and the 
imputed cohort data to estimate a complete single­year 
series of educational attainment from 1950 through to 
2016 by age, sex, and location. We separately calculated 
for each sex and GBD region the mean level of 
educational attainment of the country, age, sex, and year­
specific population (Educ,a,s,t), which was estimated as:
where Edumaxa is the maximum mean educational attain­
ment for each age group, defined as three for ages 
5–9 years, eight for ages 10–14 years, 13 for ages 
15–19 years, and 18 for all age groups 20–24 years and 
older; βs,r is a sex­specific and region­specific intercept; 
δs,r captures the linear secular trend for each sex and 
region; Is,r is a natural spline on age to capture the 
non­linear age pattern by sex and region, with knots 
at 15 and 25 years; and αc,s is a country­sex­specific 
random intercept.
Finally, we used Gaussian process regression (GPR) to 
smooth the residuals from the age–period model, 
accounting for uncertainty in each datapoint. GPR also 
synthesises both data and model uncertainty to estimate 
uncertainty intervals.

assessments of education progress. These data comprise 
1894 tests, covering 4345 location–subjects (mathematics, 
science, and reading) across 295 unique locations 
(132 countries and 163 subnational locations).
Our testing database contains a comprehensive record 
of learning scores for school­aged children aged 5–19 years. 
Four major programmes provide extensive data: the 
Programme for International Student Assess 
ment, which 
began in 2000 and now tests students in 73 countries on a 
3­year cycle;20 the Progress in International Reading 
Literacy Study (PIRLS), which covered 50 countries in the 
2016 iteration;21 the Trends in International Mathematics 
and Science Study (TIMSS), of which the latest round in 
2015 covered 57 countries;22 and several tests from the 
International Association for the Evaluation of Educational 
Achievement.23,24,25 In addition to these programmes, we 
also used regional testing programmes, including the 
Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring 
Educational Quality,26 the Latin American Laboratory 
for Assess 
ment of the Quality of Education,27 and 
the Programme d’Analyse des Systèmes Educatifs de 
la Confem;28 national standardised testing programmes, 
such as the US National Assessment of Education 
Progress,29 and the India National Achievement Survey;30 
and 
repre 
sentative 
studies 
measuring 
in 
telligence 
quotient (IQ) in school­aged children that largely included 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children,31 the Raven’s 
Standard Progressive Matrices,32 and the Peabody Picture 
Vocabu 
lary test.33 This database provides the most 
extensive geographical distribution and compilation of 
long­term temporal trends to date. Unlike several other 
studies,34–38 which used similar data, we kept scores in 
different school subjects (ie, mathematics, reading, and 
science) separate. We also maintained data on the year the 
tests were done to understand trends through time and 
included demographic information such as grade level 
(for implied age) and sex.
To generate comparable measures from these different 
tests, we rescaled subject­specific test scores to a common 
reference test scale using linear regression, building on 
previous approaches.39 We used TIMSS mathematics and 
science tests and PIRLS reading tests as the reference 
scale because they are large, international tests that cover 
most geographical regions and all three major testing 
subjects, and are already standardised to each other.40 We 
implemented the rescale using all available data matched 
by country and approximate year for the reference tests 
and alternative tests.
To estimate test scores for all countries, years, and 
ages (5­year age groups from 5 to 19 years), we used 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression41 using per 
capita mean years of education as a predictor (β=5·7, 
p=0 for boys; β=5·8, p=0 for girls), and with maths, 
science and reading test scores given equal weight 
to generate a combined learning measure ranging 
from 0 to 1000. This method draws strength across 
space, time, and age, incorporates both data and model 
uncertainty, and produces a full­time series of estimates 
for all geographies with the use of covariate relationships 
and spatial and temporal patterns in residuals.
Finally, we rescaled this measure to a 0–1 scale, with 
1 set to one SD above the mean score (a score of 600) on 
the original TIMSS exam,40 approximately the highest 
estimated average test score in any country.
Functional health status
For functional health status relevant to economic 
productivity, we used the prevalence of seven diseases 
and impairments identified in policy trials or observational 
studies to be related to learning or productivity (appendix). 
These include wasting, measured as the proportion of the 
population younger than 5 years below two SDs of the 
reference mean weight for height;42 stunting, measured 
as the proportion of the population younger than 5 years 
below two SDs of the reference height for age;42 anaemia, 
measured as the proportion of each age–sex group with a 
haemoglobin concentration defined by WHO as mild, 
moderate, or severe anaemia;43 cognitive impairment, 
measured as the proportion of the population with 
moderate, severe, or profound develop 
mental delay;44 
vision loss, defined as the proportion of the population 
with moderate or severe vision impairment or blindness;45 
hearing loss, defined by WHO as the proportion of the 
population with hearing loss greater than 40 dB in the 
better­hearing ear (30 dB in children);46 and infectious 
disease prevalence, with the use of three infectious 
disease aggregations from GBD 2016 classifi 
cation, which 
includes HIV
/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected 
tropical diseases, diarrhoea, and several other common 
infectious diseases.47
We combined these seven functional health status 
outcomes into a single measure using principal 
components analysis (PCA). In the first step, we used 
country­specific prevalence rates of anaemia, vision loss, 
hearing loss, intellectual disability, and years lived with 
disability per capita from infectious disease for 5­year 
age groups (20–64 years), from 1990 to 2016. Because 
stunting and wasting are measured only in children 
younger than 5 years, we used the time­period measure 
of prevalence in children for these two conditions. 
We rescaled each of the seven conditions such that 
0 represented the first percentile and 1 represented the 
99th percentile observed across all age, sex, and country 
groups. We then applied PCA on the age­standardised 
value of the rescaled health conditions for the ages 
20–64 years. Following standard practice, we selected the 
first n components of the PCA such that the sum of the 
variance explained by the components was greater 
than 80%.48 In this case, the first component explained 
more than 85% of the variance. We determined weights 
for each condition by taking the average loading across 
factors, weighted by the explained variance. We rescaled 
this vector of weights so that it was equal to one. We 
then calculated the health component score for each

observation specific to age, sex, country, and year by 
applying these PCA­generated weights to the seven 
component prevalence values.
Survival
We estimated expected years lived between ages 20 and 
64 years using sex­specific and age­specific mortality 
rates by country and year, produced for GBD 2016. 
This estimation procedure used a wide range of sources 
including, but not limited to, adjusted data from vital 
and sample registration systems and birth histories and 
sibling survival data collected in household surveys to 
populate abridged life tables and compute expected years 
lived by 5­year age groups. These methods are described 
in detail in a previous publication.17
Uncertainty analysis
We estimated uncertainty in the measure of expected 
human capital by computing 1000 estimates of expected 
human capital using 1000 draws from the posterior 
distribution of each of the four components (educational 
attainment, learning, functional health status, and 
survival). The posterior distribution of each of the four 
com 
ponents reflects both the variance of the input data 
and predictors used in the estimation model of each 
component.
Associations between expected human capital and 
gross domestic product
We examined the association between GDP per capita 
and expected human capital in two ways, using GDP per 
capita data from a recently published health financing 
dataset.49 First, we plotted the cross­sectional association 
between GDP per capita and expected human capital, by 
country, in 1990 and 2016, using GDP per capita in both 
log and level space. Second, for countries in each quartile 
of expected human capital in 1990 and 2016, we computed 
the median and IQR of GDP per capita in 1990 and 2016. 
For quartiles formed by the absolute change in expected 
human capital between 1990 and 2016, we also computed 
the median and IQR of the annualised rate of change in 
GDP per capita from 1990 to 2016.
Results
Levels and trends in expected human capital
After the effect of taking all four components of expected 
human capital into consideration for the 20 largest 
populations in the world (figure 1), Japan in 2016 had the 
highest expected human capital of 24·1 expected years 
lived (95% UI 23·2–25·0) from 20 to 64 years of age, 
adjusted for educational attainment, learning, and 
functional health. This value comes from Japan having 
43·9 expected years lived (95% UI 43·8–43·9) from 20 to 
64 years based on age­specific mortality rates in 2016, 
expected educational attainment of 12·4 years (12·0–12·8) 
out of a maximum possible of 18 years, a learning 
score of 0·95 (0·93–0·96), and a functional health 
score of 0·85 (0·84–0·85). On the low end in 2016 was 
Ethiopia, where expected human capital, despite sub­
stantial progress, was still less than 5 years: expected years 
lived from 20 to 64 years was 38·1 years (95% UI 
37·4–38·9), educational attainment was only 7·3 years 
(6·0–8·6), the learning score was only 0·62 (0·61–0·63), 
and the functional health score was 0·49 (0·46–0·52).

gress in producing human capital across these coun­
tries. Showing the most dramatic increase, Turkey in 2016 
had expected years lived from 20 to 64 years of 42·7 years 
(95% UI 42·4–43·1), expected years of schooling of 
14·4 years (13·4–15·2), a learning score of 0·79 (0·78–0·80), 
and a functional health score of 0·75 (0·71–0·77), yielding 
expected human capital of 20·3 years (18·6–21·8) in 2016, 
up from 8·4 years (7·9–8·9) in 1990.
In 1990, expected human capital varied widely 
(figures 2, 3): 16 countries had already achieved more 
than 20 years of expected human capital, with Finland 
(24·8 years; 95% UI 24·0–25·6), Iceland (24·1 years; 
23·5–24·7), Denmark (23·5 years; 22·9–24·3), Canada 
(23·1 years; 22·7–23·5), and the Netherlands (22·9 years; 
22·4–23·4) being the top five performing countries. 
Conversely, 61 countries had expected human capital 
of less than 5 years, including many countries in 
sub­Saharan Africa and much of south Asia. All countries 
in Latin America were below 18·5 years of expected 
human capital. Within western Europe, expected human

capital ranged considerably in 1990, from the highest 
level of 24·8 years (24·0–25·6) in Finland to 14·8 years 
(14·4–15·3) in Portugal.
Despite 25 years of progress in many dimensions of 
human capital, in 2016 these levels were not universally 
high (figures 2, 3). The top five countries were unchanged 
from 1990 except for the replacement of Canada with 
Taiwan (province of China). In 2016, all countries in 
western Europe, and many in central and eastern 
Europe, had more than 20 years of expec 
ted human cap­
ital, as did South Korea, Japan, China, Singapore, 
Taiwan (province of China), Turkey, Brunei, Australia, 
New Zealand, USA, and Canada. Despite improve­
ments, 24 countries in 2016 continued to have expected 
human capital below 5 years, with the five lowest­ranked 
countries being Niger (1·6 years; 95% UI 0·98–2·6), 
South Sudan (2·0 years; 1·2–3·0), Chad (2·7 years; 
1·7–3·2), Burkina Faso (2·8 years; 1·8–4·2), and Mali 
(2·8 years; 2·0–3·8).
The change in expected human capital between 1990 
and 2016 ranged from less than 2 years of progress in 
18 countries to more than 5 years of progress in 
35 countries (figure 4). For example, the USA, which was 
ranked sixth in terms of expected human capital in 1990, 
dropped to rank 27 in 2016 because of minimal progress, 
particularly on educational attainment. In east and 
southeast Asia, which have generally seen rapid economic 
growth, many countries had notable improvements. 
South Korea increased from rank 18 in 1990 to rank 6 in 
2016; Singapore increased from rank 43 to 13; China 
increased from rank 69 to 44; Thailand increased from 
rank 103 to 72; and Vietnam increased from rank 116 to 85.

Differential progress, however, was seen in many other 
regions. Within Latin America, Brazil had much faster 
improvements in expected human capital than other 
countries in the region (improving from rank 91 to 71). 
The most rapid absolute improvements were seen in 
several countries in the Middle East (led by Turkey, Saudi 
Arabia, and Kuwait), although some countries in the 
region, such as Yemen and Iraq, experienced much slower 
progress.
Countries had improved expected human capital from 
1990 to 2016, and showed changes in each of the 
four components of expected human capital relative 
to 1990 levels (figure 4). Although there is a clearer associa­
tion between improvements in educational attain 
ment 
and years lived between 20 and 64 years and their respective 
levels in 1990, these highly differential rates of progress 
suggest that changes are driven by a combination of policy 
factors and not just baseline levels. Several countries in 
north Africa and the Middle East with substantial 
improvements in expected human capital had a combina­
tion of notable increases in educational attainment, 
learning, and functional health status and to a lesser 
degree reductions in mortality. A similar picture can be 
seen for Latin America but at a lower overall magnitude, 
with improvements driven particularly by increases in 
educational attainment. In sub­Saharan Africa and to a 
lesser degree south Asia, improvements in expected 
human capital are due to improvements in educational 
attainment and expected years lived in the 20–64 year 
age range.
Men and women had notable differences in expected 
human capital in 2016 (figure 5). Across the board, 
expected years lived between 20 and 64 years were greater 
in women than men. Similarly, functional health status

was higher among women than men, with the exception 
of high­income countries. Conversely, learning was higher 
among men at lower and middle levels of learning—in 
regions such as sub­Saharan Africa, north Africa and the 
Middle East, south Asia, and Latin America—but this 
difference is minimal or non­existent at higher levels and 
among high­income countries. A clear regional pattern is 
present for educational attainment, with higher levels for 
males throughout sub­Saharan Africa and below 9 years of 
education. In terms of the overall measure of expected 
human capital, this measure translates into a clear separa­
tion at a threshold of 10 years of expected human capital: 
below this threshold, expected human capital tends to be 
higher in men whereas above this threshold, expected 
human capital tends to be higher in women.
Associations between expected human capital and gross 
domestic product
We examined the correlation between both levels and 
change in expected human capital and corresponding 
levels and change in gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita, at the country level (figure 6, 7). Higher levels of 
expected human capital were associated with higher levels 
of GDP per capita in both 1990 (figure 6A, 6C, 7A) and 
2016 (figure 6B, 6D, 7B). Larger improvements in expected 
human capital from 1990 to 2016 were also associated with 
greater GDP growth over the same time period. The top 
quartile of countries in terms of change in expected human 
capital from 1990 to 2016 had a median annualised GDP 
growth of 2·60% (IQR 1·85–3·69) compared with a 
median annualised GDP growth of 1·45% (0·18–2·19) 
among the bottom quartile of countries (figure 7C) in 
terms of change in expected human capital. Although not 
a formal causal analysis, these differences suggest that 
both levels of human capital are associated with economic 
performance and improvements in the production of 
human capital are associated with faster economic growth.
Discussion
Our study quantifies levels of human capital in 
195 countries from 1990 to 2016, generating a ranking of 
countries and highlighting huge variations in the pro­
duction of, and progress in building, human capital across 
countries. 
Human 
capital—educational 
attain 
ment, 
learning, functional health, and survival—in 2016 was 
highest in Finland, Iceland, Denmark, the Netherlands, 
and Taiwan (province of China), and lowest in Mali, 
Burkina Faso, Chad, South Sudan, and Niger. Over the 
past 25 years, progress has been slow in selected countries 
that started at a high baseline, such as the USA, but 
perhaps most importantly progress has also been slow in 
countries with historically low human capital, such as the 
bottom five countries in 2016. At the macro level, countries 
that have improved the production of human capital tend 
to have been more successful in fostering economic 
growth.
In an article5 by World Bank President Jim Y Kim, he 
states, “with the right measurements, an index ranking 
the human capital in countries will be hard to ignore, 
and it can help galvanize much more—and more 
effective—investments in people”. As part of the Human 
Capital Project, the World Bank intends to support 
annual reporting on human capital to keep policy 
attention focused on investments in health and education 
that accelerate human capital formation and bring 
new emphasis to the importance of human capital for 
economic growth. This study fills this measurement 
gap by presenting the first ranking of countries by levels 
of human capital with the use of a comprehensive 
metric. Although health and education were prominent 
components of the Millennium Development Goals and 
remain a focus of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
the emphasis on human capital signals a shift toward 
greater consideration of the productive value of health 
and education, in addition to humanitarian objectives.
By providing an annual measurement of human 
capital, these rankings can also be used by credit rating 
agencies in making loan decisions. Agencies that provide 
independent assessments of risks for national bonds 
already take into account some measures related to

human capital, such as life expectancy.50 The markets 
might incorporate better measures of human capital 
into borrowing schemes, recognising the challenge of 
economic growth in settings with low human capital. 
A virtuous cycle might ensue, in which financial markets 
reflect future human capital trajectories and create more 
timely incentives for ministries of finance and other 
development actors to invest in people today.
Despite wide variations in past rates of human capital 
accumulation, countries have many available strategies to 
accelerate progress. To improve average education levels, 
policy options include reducing or eliminating school 
fees, shown to increase enrolment and attendance rates in 
many countries,51–53 and carefully targeting infrastructure 
investments in alignment with needs—eg, building 
schools in areas with limited access or building latrines, 
especially for girls. Policies that can improve learning and 
educational quality include ongoing teacher trainings 
that incorporate regular follow­up visits and support,53,54 
improving diagnostics to inform teaching tailored to 
students’ levels,55,56 and grouping students by ability.57 
To improve survival and the aspects of functional health 
status studied here, many effective interventions exist 
for the major infectious diseases: insecticide­treated 
mosquito nets and artemisinin combination therapy for 
protection from malaria,58 antiretroviral therapy for 
HIV
/AIDS,59 directly observed treatment of tuber 
culosis,60 
rotavirus vaccine to prevent diarrhoea,61 and pneumococcal 
vaccine and antibiotics for lower respiratory disease,62 
among many other cost­effective interventions.63 For 
vision and hearing, effective inter 
ventions include vitamin 
A supplementation to combat childhood blindness,64 
corrective lenses, hearing aids, and more advanced tech­
nologies, such as cochlear implants. To address chronic 
malnutrition, available interventions include zinc supple­
mentation and public provision of comple 
mentary food 
for children, and for iron­deficiency anaemia, ante­
natal micronutrient supplementation and staple food 
fortification.65 Given the wide range of evidence­based 
policy options with proven effectiveness, the rate of 
human capital accumulation could accelerate dramatically; 
however, getting the priority for health and education in 
national budget discussions correct, might be the main 
challenge.27
Examination of countries with the most rapid im­
provements in human capital revealed specific policy 
reforms that probably contributed to observable growth 
in human capital. Starting in 1995, Brazil implemented a 
series of education reforms, which included ensuring 
equal funding across all localities, expanding student 
testing, and ensuring educational opportunities for poor 
families, leading to impressive increases in educational 
attainment. Improving learning is the current national 
priority, with the aim of achieving Organisation for 
Economic Co­operation and Development­level test 
scores by 2021.66 The education system in Singapore, 
which has the highest student test scores in the world, 
has emphasised quality over the past 20 years, starting 
with the Thinking Schools, Learning Nation framework 
in 1997
. This encompassed many initiatives to improve 
learning, including tailoring teaching to students’ level of 
ability.67 Poland’s student performance on international 
tests dramatically improved after the country imple­
mented educational reforms in 1999, incorporating 
additional hours of language training and delayed 
tracking into vocational training.68 Thailand was one of

the first middle­income countries to achieve universal 
health coverage, facilitated by the creation of a new public 
insurance scheme in 2001 and a shift toward greater 
service provision through primary care centres.69 Turkey 
initiated the Health Transformation Program in 2003, 
which entailed separating the purchasing and provision 
of health services, mandating insurance coverage, and 
reforming provider payment, leading to expanded access 
and improved patient satisfaction and health outcomes.70
Changes in the nature of the world economy, including 
the increased importance of digital technology, sometimes 
referred to as the fourth industrial revolution,71 might 
make human capital even more important for future 
economic growth. The potentially rising role of highly 
skilled and healthy workers in the future puts a premium 
on investing in people now to accelerate human capital 
formation. This investment requires long­term planning 
to make major changes in the proportion of children who 
are healthy and spend up to 18 years attending high­
quality educational institutions. Health investments can 
have a double effect on human capital: improved 
functional health can directly increase the productivity of 
workers at each age and can also facilitate children 
attending school and effectively learning. A review72 
of studies examining the association between early 
childhood stunting and cognitive development found that 
an increase of one SD in height­for­age of children 
younger than 2 years old is associated with an increase of 
0·22 SD in cognition at ages 5–11 years. A meta­analysis73 
of 14 randomised clinical trials of iron supplementation 
suggested an association between haemoglobin concen­
tration and intelligence, with anaemic premenopausal 
women experiencing a 2·5­point (95% CI 1·24–3·76) 
improvement in IQ following iron supplementation.
The estimates of educational attainment presented 
in this study are highly correlated with other widely 
used sources, particularly the well known Barro and 
Lee estimates;74 however, the present dataset offers 
several important advantages over this source and 
other available sources. First, the data underlying 
these estimates are based on a systematic synthesis of 
censuses and household surveys, whereas most other 
estimates rely heavily on enrolment data, which are 
subject to a range of inaccuracies; for example, enrol 
ment 
rates can be well over 100% due to students repeating 
levels and older learners returning to school. Second, 
the number of unique data sources informing these 
estimates is greater than that used in past studies.75 Barro 
and Lee, for example, used 621 unique sources versus the 
2522 under 
lying our estimates.74 Third, in the estimation 
methods, no other study to our knowledge has attempted 
to parse binned education data—ie, by completed level—
into individual years of completed schooling, thereby 
generating more precise estimates of average years of 
schooling. Finally, because of the data sources and 
modelling approach used, we were able to generate annual 
estimates for 5­year age groups—a level of detail that is 
not available from most other sources, which more often 
report estimates in 5­year increments or for more 
aggregated age groups. One limitation of this analysis to 
note, however, is that we have not produced estimates of 
the distribution of educational attainment in countries, 
only mean levels. The human capital value of educational 
attainment might not be a linear function of years of 
education.
The learning estimates presented here would be 
substantially strengthened through the expansion of inter­
national student assessments. Although these results 
represent the best estimates given all available data, 
56 countries have not participated in any internationally 
similar tests, necessitating substantial reliance on adjusted 
national tests and covariates to generate a comparable 
estimate of learning for all countries. Given the importance 
of educational quality for economic growth, expanding 
participation in inter 
national student tests is a priority for 
new data collection. Estimates of learning could also be 
improved with an expansion into quality measures for 
both tertiary education and on­the­job skills training.
For health, we have used a simple PCA to reduce the 
complexity of information on several learning­related and 
productivity­related outcomes, but these PCA weights 
might not capture the potential for different health 
outcomes to have differential effects on economic pro­
ductivity. We have, for example, included some outcomes 
that are related to cognitive performance, such as stunting, 
wasting, anaemia, and infectious dis 
eases, but other 
health outcomes could also be important for productivity, 
such as mental health and substance abuse. For stunting 
and wasting, however, we were only able to incorporate 
period measures of these indicators and not cohort 
measures because of a paucity of historical data on the 
prevalence of these conditions. Future work should 
explore more health outcomes in greater detail and 
explore their intercon 
nections to economic output.
Formal examination of the association between eco­
nomic growth and expanded measures of human capital 
that incorporate broader dimensions, such as the measure 
presented in this study, is another area of future work. In 
this study, we examined associations between levels and 
trends in our measure of human capital and levels and 
trends in GDP. Although these simple analyses suggest a 
correlation, we do not make claims of causality because 
they are not causal analyses. Future work in this area will 
need to address the potential problem of reverse causality. 
In other words, do improvements in human capital lead to 
faster economic growth or does faster economic growth 
allow countries to better invest in human capital?
Our study focused on national levels of human capital, 
but geospatial analyses have shown disparities in average 
years of schooling.76 In future work, we believe it will be a 
useful planning tool to measure human capital at this 
high spatial resolution. Within a geographical location, 
measurement of mean levels of human capital might not 
be enough; measurement of the full distribution will allow

testing of hypotheses about the comparative importance 
of secondary and tertiary education access and quality. 
Such granular information could be used to target 
communities that are the worst off and to assess efforts to 
reduce inequalities as part of the Sustainable Development 
Goals framework.
The World Bank argues that countries are not investing 
enough in health and education to benefit from the 
potential of their own human capital. We provide the first 
comprehensive assessment of expected human capital for 
195 countries from 1990 to 2016. Countries have varied 
substantially in the pace of improving human capital, 
holding out the promise that wider implemen 
tation of 
targeted policies and funding focused on improving 
health and education can accelerate human and economic 
development.
