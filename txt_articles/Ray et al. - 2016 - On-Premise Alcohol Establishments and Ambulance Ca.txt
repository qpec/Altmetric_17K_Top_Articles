Abstract: Alcohol contributes to intentional and unintentional injury.
We explored on-premise licensed alcohol establishments (LAEs) and
emergency medical service (EMS) ambulance calls.
We completed a retrospective population-based study in the Region
of Peel, Ontario, 2005 to 2014, where alcohol sales are tightly regulated
and healthcare is universally available. We included participants age �
19 years. Longitude–latitude coordinates of all 696 LAEs and all
267,477 EMS ambulance calls were ascertained, and then assigned
to 1 of 1568 dissemination areas (DA) in Peel. Relative risks (RRs)
described the association between density of on-premise LAEs (by DA
deciles) and the rate of EMS calls, adjusted for material deprivation, and
density of beer/liquor stores in each DA.
There was a curvilinear relation between LAE density and EMS
calls for trauma, rising from 45.3 per 1000 in DAs with no LAEs to
381.0 per 1000 in decile-10 (adjusted RR 7.83, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 6.15–9.97). This relation was more pronounced for alcohol-
focused LAEs, and highest among younger males. Calls for assault
(RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.26–5.65) and intoxication (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.41–
11.38) were more likely on the last day of the month and the day
thereafter, compared to 1 week prior. At 02:00 hours, when LAEs must
stop selling alcohol, there was a considerable rise in assault-related calls
in DAs with LAE but not in DAs without LAEs.
On-premise LAEs contribute to EMS calls for trauma and assault,
especially among young males, around last call, and when monthly pay
cheques are cashed.

BACKGROUND
A
lcohol is a readily accessible and commonly consumed
psychoactive substance1 that contributes worldwide to
organ-specific disease, intentional and unintentional injury,
and death.2 Alcohol impairs judgment and places a person at
elevated risk of being both a victim and perpetrator of inten-
tional injury.3,4 Many persons who overuse alcohol use the
emergency department,5 and a large proportion of injury in the
emergency department is attributable to hazardous alcohol use
or recent alcohol ingestion.6 Additionally, emergency medical
service (EMS) responders, including ambulance paramedics
and firefighters, commonly deal with alcohol-related injury,
both within the home and licensed alcohol establishments
(LAEs). EMS superusers—those with at least 15 annual
EMS encounters—are exponentially correlated with alcohol
use and tend to be younger, male, and current tobacco users.7
Data show a strong association between alcohol intoxication
and the risk of assault: those who are transported by EMS
ambulance for alcohol intoxication are 9 times more likely to be
transported for subsequent assault.8 Alcohol-related violence is
most likely to occur between 22:00 and 02:00 hours,9 while
others have observed a pronounced monthly cycle in alcohol-
related hospital admissions10 and ambulance system calls11
related to some government transfer (welfare) programs.
The density of LAEs within communities—whether on-
premise (e.g., bars and restaurants) or off-premise (e.g., liquor
and beer stores)—is associated with intentional and uninten-
tional injury.3,12,13 Citing the limitations of many prior studies
on this topic, recommendations were recently published about
ways to improve the data on alcohol sales outlets and adverse
health outcomes.14 The list includes conducting analyses in
areas under special license systems; stratifying outlets by
categories (e.g., bars vs restaurants); incorporating highly loca-
lized clustering of outlets; and analyzing the shape of the
relation between alcohol availability and outcomes, such as
whether it is discrete or continuous, and linear versus curvi-
linear, to aid identification of target availability levels.14
Additionally, prior studies of on-premise alcohol outlets have
not adjusted for the density of off-premise stores. Such adjust-
ment is important because both on- and off-premise establish-
ments are more likely to be found in densely populated areas
and both can adversely influence health outcomes.

 Herein, we determined the risk of EMS ambulance calls in
association with the density of on-premise LAEs in the Region
of Peel, Ontario, Canada, where all on-premise and off-premise
outlets are licensed by the province of Ontario, and all EMS
ambulance calls are under a single provider within a universal
public healthcare system. In Ontario, the legal drinking age is
strictly enforced at 19 years and older. We specifically eval-
uated EMS ambulance calls for intentional and intentional
injury (henceforth, called ‘‘trauma’’), including those due to
assault, and categorized them by the type of alcohol LAE, the
time of the EMS call, and the additive effect of tobacco sales at
the same location as the LAE.15 We used deciles of on-premise
LAE density, which offers better discrimination of target
availability thresholds, thus addressing an important gap in
the literature.14
Study Design
We performed a retrospective population-based study
of all EMS ambulance calls in the Region of Peel, Ontario,
from January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2014. The Region of
Peel contains about 1.4 million residents, https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Peel. We used the 1617
dissemination areas (DA) in the Region of Peel as the geo-
graphic units for analysis. A DA is a standardized small,
relatively stable geographic unit comprising a population of
400 to 700 persons, as determined by the Statistics Canada 2011
Census. We excluded 49 DAs with fewer than 100 residents per
km2, to eliminate 1 major international airport and unpopulated
areas with few or no LAEs or EMS ambulance calls, leaving
1568 DAs for analysis. Permission to complete the study was
granted by the research ethics boards of St. Michael’s Hospital
and the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Exposure, Outcome Variables, and Covariates
The main exposure variable was the density of all on-
premise LAEs, such as restaurants, bars, pubs, social clubs, and
hotels. The list of on-premise LAEs, from 2005 to 2014, was
provided by the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, as all
are regulated under the provincial Liquor License Act, http://
www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900719. The sale of alcohol at
all LAEs must cease by 02:00 hours. Using address and postal
code, the longitude and latitude coordinates of each LAE were
determined. Each LAE was assigned to a given DA, using
geocoding for Bing Maps, https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2013/
12/17/how-to-fine-tune-location-coordinates-with-the-custom-
geocoding-refinement-tool/.
The
density
of
LAEs
was
expressed as the number of LAEs per 1000 residents age
� 19 years per DA, and DAs were further assigned to deciles
from the lowest density (decile 1 [D1]) to the highest (decile 10
[D10]). In most models, unless otherwise qualified below, each
decile was compared to the reference group of DAs that had no
LAEs (called ‘‘none’’).
The main study outcome was the rate of EMS ambulance
calls per 1000 residents age � 19 years, separated by ‘‘trauma’’
and ‘‘medical’’ conditions, according to the EMS Problem
field completed by each paramedic team on the Ambulance
Call Report (ACR), http://www.ambulance-transition.com/pdf_
documents/amb_call_report_completion_manual_v2.2_0603.pdf.
EMS ambulance calls were obtained from the Peel EMS ACR
database, housed at the Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital
Medicine. We excluded any EMS calls for patients age < 19
years, calls in which the pick-up address or location was not
known, calls designated to transfer a patient between facilities,
and calls in which no patient was found when EMS attended the
scene, the patient was transported by another ambulance, or
the call was cancelled before patient contact. Among trauma-
related EMS ambulance calls, we further evaluated those
classified on the ACR as an ‘‘assault,’’ namely, due to a
physical assault, gunshot, or stabbing.
As a covariate, to describe DA-level poverty, we used
the Material Deprivation Index quintile (Q),16 http://www.
torontohealthprofiles.ca/onmarg.php. The 2 other covariates
were the density of off-premise alcohol outlets, namely, Beer
Stores and Liquor Control Board of Ontario stores. Both
comprise the majority of off-premise beer, wine, and spirit
retail sales, and all are regulated under the Province of
Ontario.3,16 In Ontario, alcohol cannot be sold in grocery or
convenience stores.
We also obtained all licensed tobacco vendors from the
Ontario Tobacco Inspection System database, which contains
records on vendor compliance with tobacco sales requirement
for all tobacco sales, including vending machines.17 Each
vendor’s address and postal code was used to assign it longitude
and latitude coordinates.
Data Analysis
An unadjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) expressed the relation between density of on-
premise LAEs (by DA deciles) and the rate of EMS calls,
derived using negative binomial regression. The latter method is
used for modeling over-dispersed count outcome variables,
which was the case herein. The natural log of the number of
residents age � 19 years in each DA was used as the offset
variable. DAs without any LAEs served as the referent.
Adjusted RRs (aRR) were then calculated by adding material
deprivation index quintile and density of off-premise outlets to
all models.
We first explored the rate of EMS ambulance calls for
trauma- and for medical-related conditions, in relation to the
density of on-premise LAEs. We then examined the risk of
trauma-related EMS ambulance calls in relation to the density
of ‘‘alcohol-focused LAEs’’—bars, taverns, nightclubs, and
billiard/pool halls, which are expected to reflect greater alcohol
consumption18,19—as well as in relation to the remaining LAEs,
which are largely centered on food consumption and accom-
modation (Supplemental file S1, http://links.lww.com/MD/
A961). Any mixed bar–restaurant was classified as a restaurant.
In the analysis of alcohol-focused LAEs and trauma-related
EMS calls, we further explored the relation among males and
females, by 10-year age groups.
We then restricted our dataset to all DAs with �1 LAE
(i.e., D1–D10) and stratified by whether the EMS ambulance
Pick-up Code was to a ‘‘bar or restaurant’’ versus ‘‘other.’’
Therein, we measured the aRR for the call being trauma-related
or medical-related, as well as assault-related or not, with D1
serving as the referent in model. For each LAE in D1 to D10, we
determined if there was a licensed tobacco vendor at the same
spatial coordinates and calculated the aRR of medical-, trauma-,
and assault-related EMS ambulance calls to LAEs with a
tobacco vendor license versus LAEs without a tobacco vendor
(the referent).
Many individuals in Ontario are paid near to the last day of
the month, including those who receive social and disability
assistance, http://www.durham.ca/departments/social/income_
support/OWPaymentSchedule2014.pdf, in which about 82%
to 85% is through direct deposit. Accordingly, for each
LAE, we counted the number medical-, trauma-, assault-,

 and intoxication-related EMS calls on the last day of the month
and the day thereafter (since LAEs serve until 02:00). We then
compared those call-specific counts to the number of EMS
ambulance calls at the same LAE, but 7 days earlier (i.e., on the
6th and 7th last days of the same month). Unadjusted RRs were
generated using negative binomial regression with a repeated
statement to account for the clustering of counts within each
LAE.
Finally, we evaluated whether the rate of assault-related
EMS ambulance calls differed by time of day. We plotted the
proportion (95% CI) of assaults on a 24-h time clock, as a
function of all EMS calls in that 24-h period. Plots were made
for DAs with �1 LAE (i.e., D1–D10) and DAs without any
LAEs. We repeated the above, but plotted the proportion of
assaults as a function of all assault-related EMS ambulance calls
in that 24-h period. For the time of day analyses, the timing of
the EMS ambulance call was not recorded for 255 out of 3788
assault-related calls.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The study sample comprised 1568 DAs, containing
937,670 residents age � 19 years (Table 1). There were
1332 (85%) DAs with no LAEs and 236 (15%) DAs with
�1 LAE. For all 267,477 EMS ambulance calls, the respective
mean ages of males and females were 57 and 58 years, but the
respective ages were younger for trauma (51 and 57 years),
intoxication (47 and 44 years), and especially, assault (36 and
37 years) (Table 1).
There was a curvilinear relation between LAE density and
EMS ambulance calls, especially for trauma, rising from 45.3
per 1000 in DAs with no LAEs to 381.0 per 1000 in D10, a
corresponding unadjusted RR of 8.41 (95% CI 6.60–10.72) and
an aRR of 7.83 (95% CI 6.15–9.97) (Figure 1). Medical-related

 EMS ambulance calls followed the same pattern as for trauma,
with higher absolute counts, but less pronounced RRs.
At D9 and D10 of LAE density, the absolute counts and
aRR for trauma-related EMS ambulance calls were more pro-
nounced for LAEs focused on selling alcohol than for other
types of establishments (Figure 2). Upon restricting to alcohol-
focused LAEs, the curvilinear association with trauma-related
EMS ambulance calls was especially pronounced among
younger males (Figure 3A) and females (Figure 3B). The rate
of trauma-related EMS calls for males was much higher than for
females. For example, among those age 19 to 29 years, the rate
in D10 was 1120 per 1000 males, more than double the rate
among females (480 per 1000).
Upon restricting to EMS ambulance calls to a bar or
restaurant within D1 to D10, the aRR was more pronounced
for trauma-related than medical-related calls; albeit, medical-
related calls were more common (Figure 4A). A similar pattern
was seen for assault-related EMS ambulance calls (Figure 4B).
Of all 696 LAEs within D1 to D10, 247 (35%) had a licensed
tobacco vendor at the same spatial coordinates. The co-presence
of a licensed tobacco vendor was associated with a 3.5 times
higher risk of medical-related calls, and about a 7 to 8 times
higher risk of trauma- and assault-related calls (Figure 5).
Intoxication-related EMS ambulance calls to an LAE were
4 times more likely on the last day of the month and the day
thereafter, compared to 1 week prior; and the risk of assault was
2.7 times higher (Figure 6). A weaker association was observed
for medical-related EMS ambulance calls, and none for trauma.
Changing the time window to the last day of the month and the
next 2 days thereafter, compared to the same 3 days in the week
prior did not alter the findings (data not shown). The proportion
of assault-related EMS ambulance calls increased gradually
between 06:00 and 24:00 hours, but the proportion of EMS calls
due to assault did not differ significantly different between DAs
with (blue solid lines) and without (red dashed lines) on-premise
LAEs (Figures 7A and B). However, by 02:00, the time at which
the sale of all alcohol must stop, there was a considerable rise in
assault-related calls in DAs with LAEs, but not in DAs
without LAEs.
DISCUSSION
In a setting with mandatory licensing of all LAEs and
universal access to health care, including EMS services, we
observed a 7.8 times higher risk of ambulance calls for trauma in
areas with the highest density of on-premise LAEs, even after
adjusting for retail off-premise outlets and a measure of area

 poverty. The RR for trauma was especially pronounced among
young males in areas with a higher density of alcohol-focused
LAEs, and for LAEs with a tobacco vendor at the same location.
Calls for a victim of assault at a bar or restaurant were more
pronounced—dramatically peaking at 02:00 hours—when the
selling of alcohol must cease, and nearly tripled at the end of the
month—when monthly pay cheques are usually deposited.
Strengths and Limitations
An advantage of our study was the availability of a
complete dataset of EMS ambulance calls within a universal
public healthcare system, as well as all alcohol sales under a
government-regulated system. Accordingly, we were able to
respond to some of the recent recommendations about research
on LAEs and adverse health outcomes.14 First, our study was
solely conducted in an area under a single license system.
Second, we stratified by the type of LAE. While we categorized
a mixed bar–restaurant as a ‘‘restaurant,’’ doing so would
attenuate the observed contrast seen between alcohol-focused
LAEs and those less focused on alcohol. Third, we used highly
specific geographic units—DAs—and we evaluated how the
clustering of LAEs within DA deciles was related to EMS
ambulance calls. The shape of the relation between LAE density
and ambulance calls was curvilinear, with the highest risk
largely confined to D9 and D10. We also adjusted for the
density of beer and liquor retail outlets—both of which are
also fully government regulated—to partly account for off-
premise availability of alcohol.
Some of our findings may have been influenced by
unmeasured ecological factors, such as the flow of vehicular
and pedestrian traffic to and from a DA or LAE. For example,
while individuals may gather inside and near LAEs located
within busy DAs, they often do not live in those DAs. However,
in our analysis of EMS ambulance calls by time of day,
comparisons were between the same set of DAs, such that
ecological factors would largely remain stable. In our analysis
of EMS ambulance calls by time of month, each LAE served as
its own control 7 days earlier (i.e., the same day of the week),
thereby limiting confounding by spatial or temporal factors. In
the latter analysis, the highest RR was for intoxication
(Figure 7), strongly suggesting a temporary escalation in heavy
alcohol use at the end of the month. In the same analysis, the RR
was not significant for trauma-related EMS calls, which may be
explained by the fact that trauma victims are more likely to be
older and women, whereas intoxication and assault were more
prevalent in younger men (Table 1). Another explanation is that
alcohol consumption in older adults tends to occur at home
rather than at an LAE.20 Yet, our dataset does not contain details
about individual behavior or long-term alcohol use, something
better evaluated using direct interviews and police reports,21 nor
did we include patients under age 19 years or those who refused
ambulance transport or left the scene before EMS arrival.
Other Studies
The relation between alcohol availability—both on- and
off-premise—and its negative health consequences is well

 understood.2,22 We showed that increasing deciles of LAE
density was associated with a higher rate of all forms of
EMS ambulance calls. This is in alignment with a systematic
review of 44 studies on alcohol outlets density and 15 studies on
the hours and days of operation of alcohol outlets, which
showed that both are significantly associated with alcohol
consumption, harmful drinking patterns, and injury.23 In a
World Health Organization cross-sectional study of 5410 con-
secutive patients admitted to a hospital emergency department
in 12 countries, 1 in 5 injury cases had alcohol involvement, 1 in
3 of latter cases were injured within 30 min of their last drink,
and the injury was most often intentional, perpetrated by a
stranger.24
The time of day in which alcohol-influenced injury arises
appears to be near last call. In Ontario in 1996, legislation
extended last call from 01:00 to 02:00, and there was a sub-
stantial rise in the risk of trauma cases unrelated to motor
vehicle collisions.25 In our study, the peak in assaults was at
02:00, especially in DAs with �1 LAE, which is the time when
an establishment must cease selling alcohol. In Norway, each
1-h extension of closing hours of on-premise alcohol outlets was
associated with a 16% (95% CI 9–24) increase in police-
reported assaults.26 Conversely, in Greater Newcastle, Austra-
lia, moving pub closing time from 05:00 to 03:30 resulted in

 time may be the gathering of intoxicated patrons outside of
LAEs. If proximate bars cater to different sorts of patrons, then
this too may enhance the potential for confrontation outside of
those establishments.28 Later closing hours enables some
patrons to consume more alcohol, and it has been shown that
hotels with later closing hours experience more assaults than
those with standard business hours29; additional research is
needed on the effects of later or staggered bar closing times.19
More than one-third of LAEs in our study had a tobacco
vendor licensee at the location. It has been observed that
residential areas with high levels of deprivation tend to have
a greater density of outlets that sell alcohol and tobacco.30

 However, we adjusted for Material Deprivation Index and found
between a 3.5 to 7.7 times higher risk of EMS ambulance calls
for medical, trauma, or assault in the co-presence of tobacco
sales (Figure 5), something not been previously documented.
There are biological and epidemiological reasons for why
people co-misuse alcohol and nicotine.31,32 Bar patrons and
smokers are more likely to be assaulted, since such individuals
tend to take more risks.19 Hence, it is conceivable that the
selling of tobacco serves as another marker of the so-called
‘‘bad bar,’’19 in addition to our list of alcohol-focused LAEs
(Figure 2 and Supplemental file S1, http://links.lww.com/MD/
A961).
Policy Implications
While there are no randomized clinical trials to show that
controlling the availability of alcohol leads to a reduction in
intentional and unintentional injury, observational data are
supportive of this notion.2,24,33 For example, the community
of Buckhead, Atlanta petitioned its mayor and city council to
enforce restrictions on the retail sales of alcohol, including the
closure of many LAEs, while no such changes occurred in
nearby Midtown or Downtown, Atlanta.34 With a 3.2% relative
reduction in LAE density in Buckhead, there was an associated
2-fold greater reduction in violent crime compared to the
control neighborhoods. Accordingly, though not causally pro-
ven, 2 means to achieving a reduction in EMS calls for injury
and intoxication include limiting their hours of operation and
their geographic density. Specifically, in areas with numerous
LAEs, zoning by-laws might limit the issuing of further
licenses. Using information such as presented in our study,
1 might focus on DAs with a high density of LAEs (e.g., those in
D10), and apply such restrictions therein. Another approach
might consider a risk-based liquor licensing framework, in

 which ‘‘bad bars’’19—especially those with prior violations or
offences related to the serving of alcohol—are subject to a cost-
recovery element that includes higher fees for venues with
higher risk.35 Some of these fees can help offset the higher
costs for EMS calls.
Our data on timing of the month and EMS calls for assault
or intoxication reinforce the observation that alcohol consump-
tion is a function of not only its price, but also the availability of
the funds to purchase alcohol.11,36 The risk of intoxication
quadrupled at the end of the month, and the risk of assault
nearly tripled. As confidently stated by others, and based on
data from 112 studies, ‘‘[p]ublic policies that raise prices of
alcohol are an effective means to reduce drinking.’’36 It remains
to be determined whether distributing payments over more than
1 time point in a month10,11 can reduce alcohol purchasing and
alcohol-related harm. The latter could be tested within a cluster-
based randomized clinical trial.
EMS personnel typically deal with serious injuries and
medical conditions arising outside of hospital, some of which
are related to alcohol consumption.37 As shown herein, 2.3% of
EMS ambulance calls were for intoxication. One proposed
strategy to better deal with the latter is the use of a checklist
by EMS personnel, to triage intact individuals directly to a
detoxification center. In a retrospective review of 718 EMS
encounters, nearly 20% of intoxicated individuals were safely
diverted to a detoxification center using this approach, with
their checklist having a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI 97–100).38
A large proportion of EMS ambulance calls in our study
were from trauma (19.4%), and specifically, assault (1.4%), and
all victims were transported to an emergency department for
further care. In such cases, when alcohol plays a role, there
emerges an opportunity for a brief intervention to reduce future
harm from alcohol consumption. For example, in 1 clinical trial,
Crawford et al39 randomized patients received to receive an
information leaflet versus the information leaflet plus an
appointment with an alcohol health worker. At 12 months,
the respective amount of alcohol consumed was 57.2 versus
70.8 units/wk.
CONCLUSION
On-premise LAEs, especially those focused on the sale of
alcohol, dramatically contribute to EMS ambulance calls for
trauma and assault, especially among young males. Influential
factors include the sale of tobacco products at the same location
as the LAE, the 02:00 mandatory serving time limit of LAEs,
and end-of month issuing of pay cheques.
