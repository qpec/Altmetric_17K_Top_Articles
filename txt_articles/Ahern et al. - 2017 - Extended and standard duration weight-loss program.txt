Summary
Background Evidence exist that primary care referral to an open-group behavioural programme is an effective strategy 
for management of obesity, but little evidence on optimal intervention duration is available. We aimed to establish 
whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-management programme would achieve greater weight loss and 
improvements in a range of health outcomes and be more cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals.
Methods In this non-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants who were aged 
18 years or older and had body-mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m² or higher from 23 primary care practices in England. 
Participants were randomly assigned (2:5:5) to brief advice and self-help materials, a weight-management programme 
(Weight Watchers) for 12 weeks, or the same weight-management programme for 52 weeks. We followed-up 
participants over 2 years. The primary outcome was weight at 1 year of follow-up, analysed with mixed-effects models 
according to intention-to-treat principles and adjusted for centre and baseline weight. In a hierarchical closed-testing 
procedure, we compared combined behavioural programme arms with brief intervention, then compared the 12-week 
programme and 52-week programme. We did a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis using person-level data and 
modelled outcomes over a 25-year time horizon using microsimulation. This study is registered with Current 
Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232.
Findings Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, we enrolled 1269 participants. 1267 eligible participants were 
randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n=211), the 12-week programme (n=528), and the 52-week programme 
(n=528). Two participants in the 12-week programme had been found to be ineligible shortly after randomisation and 
were excluded from the analysis. 823 (65%) of 1267 participants completed an assessment at 1 year and 856 (68%) 
participants at 2 years. All eligible participants were included in the analyses. At 1 year, mean weight changes in the 
groups were –3·26 kg (brief intervention), –4·75 kg (12-week programme), and –6·76 kg (52-week programme). 
Participants in the behavioural programme lost more weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted difference 
–2·71 kg, 95% CI –3·86 to –1·55; p<0·0001). The 52-week programme was more effective than the 12-week 
programme (–2·14 kg, –3·05 to –1·22; p<0·0001). Differences between groups were still significant at 2 years. 
No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Over 2 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER; compared with brief intervention) was £159 per kg lost for the 52-week programme and £91 per kg for the 
12-week programme. Modelled over 25 years after baseline, the ICER for the 12-week programme was dominant 
compared with the brief intervention. The ICER for the 52-week programme was cost-effective compared with the 
brief intervention (£2394 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and the 12-week programme (£3804 per QALY).
Interpretation For adults with overweight or obesity, referral to this open-group behavioural weight-loss programme 
for at least 12 weeks is more effective than brief advice and self-help materials. A 52-week programme produces 
greater weight loss and other clinical benefits than a 12-week programme and, although it costs more, modelling 
suggests that the 52-week programme is cost-effective in the longer term.

Introduction
The burden of disease attributable to excess bodyweight 
places considerable strain on health-care resources 
across the world.1,2 Behavioural weight-management 
programmes are the first-line method to aid weight loss 
in people who are overweight or obese, and although 
there is good evidence that some programmes can be 
effective, other programmes have not been shown to be 
effective.3 This variation in effectiveness might be due to 
differences in content and format of interventions,

including how long support is provided. In the UK, the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence public 
health guidance4 recommends that behavioural weight-
management programmes should last a minimum of 
12 weeks, which is the standard length of the most 
commonly commissioned interventions.5 However, there 
is conflicting evidence about whether longer treatment 
(>12 weeks) duration would be more effective.6,7
Open-group, behavioural weight-loss programmes are 
among the most commonly commissioned programmes in 
the UK and evidence suggests that these programmes are 
both clinically effective and cost-effective.3,8 We aimed to 
establish whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-
management programme would result in significantly 
greater weight loss and improvements in a range of 
secondary health outcomes in participants and be more 
cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals.
Methods
Study design
This study was a multi-centre, non-blinded, multi- 
arm randomised controlled trial with imbalanced 
randomisation. The full protocol has been described 
elsewhere.9 Briefly, participants were recruited from 
23 primary care practices in England between 
Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014. Recruitment and follow-
up was done in three research centres: Medical 
Research Council (MRC) Human Nutrition Research 
(Cambridge; coordinating centre), the University of 
Liverpool, and the University of Oxford. Research 
teams at Cambridge and Liverpool recruited local 
practices and research staff did study visits at the 
research centre. The research team at Oxford recruited 
practices across southern and eastern England and 
practice staff (usually a research nurse) did study visits 
at the practice.
Ethical approval was received from NRES Committee 
East of England Cambridge East and local approvals 
from NRES Committee North West Liverpool Central 
and NRES Committee South Central Oxford. This trial 
was registered with Current Controlled Trials, number 
ISRCTN82857232.
Participants
Eligible participants (those aged 18 years or older and 
had a body-mass index [BMI] of 28 kg/m² or higher) 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A systematic review and meta-analysis was done in 
November, 2012, to synthesise data from 37 trials of 
behavioural weight-management programmes delivered in a 
context that could be replicated in routine clinical practice. 
Three studies investigated primary care referral to a commercial 
open-group programme compared with a control group and 
pooled results showed a mean difference of 2·22 kg in favour of 
the intervention group, but no consistent effects on markers of 
cardiovascular risk. The quality of the evidence was assessed as 
moderate. These interventions lasted 12, 52, and 104 weeks 
with no studies comparing effectiveness with different 
durations of treatment. Indirect comparisons across all 
37 studies found no effect of duration of intervention on 
weight loss at 12 months. However, findings from a previous 
systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparisons 
between interventions of different lengths, mostly from 
controlled research studies, showed that interventions 
providing extended care led to 3·2 kg less weight regain than 
control interventions over a mean follow-up period of 
17·6 months after initial weight loss. We did an updated search 
of PubMed and Scopus with search terms for “overweight” and 
“obesity”, “diet” and “exercise”, and “weight-loss interventions”, 
for papers published up until Jan 12, 2017, and found no new 
direct comparisons of treatment duration.
Added value of this study
We found that referral to a commercial, open-group 
behavioural programme for 12 weeks or 52 weeks resulted in 
more weight loss than a brief self-help intervention. This 
finding extends previous findings by showing that referral for 
52 weeks achieves greater weight loss than standard 12-week 
referrals currently used in the UK National Health Service over 
2 years. Contrary to common criticisms that these interventions 
could exacerbate health inequalities, there was no evidence that 
the outcome of treatment is affected by socioeconomic factors 
such as sex, education, and income. We also show, for the first 
time to our knowledge, that this extended referral achieves 
improvements in fasting glucose concentration and glycated 
haemoglobin equivalent to more intensive health 
professional-led interventions. Using microsimulation 
modelling, we show for the first time that, over a 25-year 
period, the 12-week programme is cost-saving compared with 
a brief intervention, and that the 52-week programme is cost-
effective compared with the 12-week programme.
Implications of all the available evidence
Referral to a commercial open-group behavioural weight-loss 
programme for 12 weeks is an effective weight-loss 
intervention and could be cost-saving for adults in the general 
population in the long term. Extending the referral length from 
12 weeks (UK standard) to 52 weeks could increase the clinical 
effectiveness of these programmes, by achieving increased 
weight loss and reductions in risk factors for diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease compared with the 12-week programme. 
Although the 52-week programme is more expensive in the 
short term, the programme is likely to be cost-effective in the 
longer term because of greater reductions in disease incidence.

were identified through practice records. Exclusion 
criteria were planned (within 2 years) or current 
pregnancy; previous or planned bariatric surgery; 
current participation in a structured, monitored weight-
loss programme; participation in other research that 
could confound outcome measures; eating disorders; 
and non-English speaking or special communication 
needs. Practices could exclude additional patients who 
they felt were inappropriate to invite, but were asked to 
report reasons for exclusion. Additional reasons for 
exclusion included terminal illness or palliative care, 
dementia, a severe mental health problem or learning 
difficulty, carer for a terminally ill relative, or recently 
bereaved. Patients were invited by letter and asked to 
contact the local study coordinator for telephone 
screening if they were interested in participating. 
Eligible and willing participants were given an 
appointment, during which a member of the research 
team weighed them and measured their height to 
confirm eligibility before randomisation. If more than 
one household member was eligible and interested in 
participating, the first to enrol was taken as the 
participant. All participants gave written informed 
consent.
Randomisation and masking
Participant details were entered into the trial database, 
which randomly assigned participants with a valid BMI 
to have one of three interventions (brief intervention 
[given a booklet of self-help weight-management 
strategies], referral to the commercial, open-group, 
behavioural 
weight-loss 
programme 
[behavioural 
programme] for 12 weeks, or referral to the same 
programme for 52 weeks) in a 2:5:5 ratio stratified by 
centre and gender, with a block size of 12. The 
randomisation sequence was generated by the trial 
statistician at the time of protocol development using 
Stata (version 12.1) and programmed into the database 
by the data manager (DC). The sequence was unknown 
to research staff and participants. The database revealed 
the group allocation after participants were enrolled and 
entered into the database. Participants and research staff 
were not blinded to the intervention allocation after 
randomisation because of the nature of the intervention 
and the trial design.
Procedures
Participants assigned to the behavioural programme 
were asked to attend a local Weight Watchers meeting 
once a week for the duration of their intervention 
(12 weeks or 52 weeks). At the baseline visit, participants 
were given a list of local meeting times and locations, a 
voucher booklet for 12 visits (the expiry date was set for 
14 weeks from baseline), and a unique code to access 
digital tools for the duration of their intervention. 
Meeting vouchers were identical to those used in 
the National Health Service (NHS) referral schemes 
operating 
throughout 
the 
country 
and 
allowed 
participants to attend meetings without charge. At the 
meeting, participants were asked to give the voucher to 
the group leader, but were asked not to mention their 
participation in the trial to the group leader or other 
members. 
Participants 
assigned 
to 
the 
52-week 
programme were given three additional books of 
vouchers when they returned for their 3-month visit 
(expiry date set for 54 weeks from baseline).
Participants allocated to the brief intervention were 
given a 32-page printed booklet by the British Heart 
Foundation of self-help weight-management strategies10 
and research staff read a scripted introduction that drew 
attention to each section of the booklet.
All participants attended measurement appointments 
at baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months. Height was 
measured to the nearest 0·1 cm using a stadiometer. 
Weight and fat mass were measured to the nearest 0·1 kg 
using a 4-point segmental body composition analyser 
(Tanita, 
Amsterdam, 
The 
Netherlands). 
Waist 
circumference was measured to the nearest 0·1 cm with a 
tape measure, halfway between the lowest rib and the 
iliac crest. Blood pressure was measured three times in a 
seated resting state with an automated blood pressure 
monitor, 
and 
the 
mean 
calculated. 
Biochemical 
measurements were optional. Willing participants were 
asked to give a fasting blood sample at the baseline visit 
and 12 months for analysis of glucose concentration, 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipid profile. All 
samples were analysed in Cambridge using standardised 
methods (appendix p 2).
At each visit, participants self-reported their use 
of 
weight-loss 
methods, 
including 
the 
allocated 
intervention, and completed the EuroQol 5-dimension 
3-level (EQ5D-3L) questionnaire11,12 as a measure of quality 
of life. Data on health-care resource use was also self-
reported. Participants who were unable or unwilling to 
attend a 12-month visit (primary outcome measurement) 
were asked to provide a self-measured weight by phone or 
email. Self-reported weights are not included in the 
primary outcome analysis, but are included in a sensitivity 
analysis (appendix p 3).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in bodyweight at 
12 months. The secondary clinical outcomes were 
bodyweight at 3 months and 24 months; proportion of 
participants losing 5% or more of baseline bodyweight 
or 10% or more of baseline bodyweight at 3, 12, and 
24 months; waist circumference, fat mass, and blood 
pressure at 3, 12 and 24 months; fasting blood glucose 
concentration, HbA1c, triglycerides and HDL, LDL, and 
total cholesterol at 12 months; and self-reported quality 
of life (EQ5D-3L) and health resource use at 3, 12, and 
24 months. We did not anticipate that adverse events 
related to the interventions would occur and so did not 
formally record these.

Statistical analysis
We calculated the sample size based on data from our 
previous trials13,14 with an expected difference of 2·3 kg 
between the brief intervention and combined behavioural 
programme groups, 1·3 kg difference between 12-week 
and 52-week programmes, and an assumed SD of 6 kg. 
The hierarchical closed-testing procedure was used to 
compare the behavioural programme groups with the 
brief intervention groups using a one-sided test and then, 
only if significant at the 5% level, we did a two-sided test for 
a difference between 12-week and 52-week programmes 
to preserve a type I error rate of 5% without the need for a 
multiplicity correction. With a sample of 1200 participants 
(200 participants in the brief intervention group, 
500 participants in the 12-week programme, and 500 
participants in the 52-week programme), we had 99·95% 
power to detect a difference of 2·3 kg between the brief 
intervention group and the behavioural programme 
groups, and 92·87% power to detect a difference of 1·3 kg 
between 12-week and 52-week programmes. The overall 
power of the study was 92·82%.
Analyses were prespecified in the published protocol.9 
The primary analyses assessed differences between the 
intervention groups in mean weight change from baseline 
to 12 months. Because of levels of attrition commonly 
encountered in weight-loss trials, four analysis approaches 
were taken to account for the effect of missing data: a 
missing at random (MAR) analysis using a variance 
components model; a completers only analysis; baseline 
observation carried forward (BOCF); and last observation 
carried forward (LOCF). For the MAR analysis, we 
calculated mean weight loss and SE via a multiple 
imputation model using multivariate normal regression; 
we imputed 20 datasets for weight separately for each 
treatment group, with baseline weight, weight at 
3 months, weight at 12 months, and weight at 24 months 
regressed on centre. A model for multivariate normal data 
with baseline weight, weight at 3 months, weight at 
12 months, and weight at 24 months as the outcome was 
fitted using measured weights at each timepoint via 
generalised least squares, with intervention group, 
visit, intervention group-by-visit interaction, and centre 
included as fixed effects. For the participants who 
completed the study only, BOCF and LOCF analyses, 
fixed-effect models for continuous normal data were fitted 
to the 12-month weight data. The fixed effects were 
intervention 
group, 
centre, 
and 
baseline 
weight. 
We analysed secondary outcomes with the same 
regression-based models. Results reported in this Article 
used the MAR assumption. Results obtained using other 
assumptions are in the appendix (p 4). We did sensitivity 
analyses to examine whether findings were sensitive to 
timing of the 12-month assessment or inclusion of self-
reported weights. All analyses were done in Stata 
(version 13.1).
A review4 highlighted the absence of evidence of this 
type of programme on socioeconomic inequalities, so we 
also did a post-hoc analysis of potential interactions 
between intervention effects and gender, educational 
qualification, and income. We calculated coefficient 
estimates for each fixed effect.
To 
establish 
within-trial 
cost-effectiveness 
over 
24 months, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) as incremental cost per additional kg of weight 
loss (see appendix for details p 5). If the participant 
attended at least one session, the NHS would be charged a 
flat rate of £48·50 (12-week programme) or £190 (52-week 
programme). If they did not attend, there was no charge. 
We estimated non-intervention NHS costs from health-
resource use questionnaires, which were completed by 
participants at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months and were 
framed within a 3-month recall period.15 We used area 
under the curve methods to ascertain the full NHS costs 
incurred over the 24 months’ follow-up period.16 We did a 
secondary analysis to examine the ICER over a 1-year time 
horizon to enable comparison with similar studies with 
shorter follow-up.
We used the microsimulation model developed for the 
Foresight: Tackling Obesities project17,18 to estimate the 
effect of the three interventions on disease incidence, 
health-care costs, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and 
ICERs for 25 years following baseline (appendix p 14). 
We used mean change in BMI for each intervention at 
1 year and 2 years for this analysis, and assumed that 
between 2 years and 5 years all participants returned to 
their baseline weight in a linear manner (ie, regained all 
weight lost) and followed national trends based on data 
derived from repeated cross-sectional samples in the 
Health Survey for England.19
The number of meetings attended by the participants 
in the behavioural programme groups between baseline 
and 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months, and 21 months 
and 24 months, was self-reported. The proportion of 
participants who self-reported use of other weight-loss 
interventions was also calculated.
Data management was overseen by the coordinating 
centre’s data manager. The dataset linking treatment 
group to participant outcomes was only released to the 
investigators after completion of data collection for the 
primary outcome.
Role of the funding source

Results
Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, 1954 participants 
were screened and 1269 were eligible and were randomly 
allocated an intervention (figure 1). After the baseline 
appointment and before the interventions were started, 
two participants were excluded because their general

practitioner reported illnesses that would have excluded 
them. These participants were removed and the 
remaining 1267 participants were included in the primary 
analyses. Data on participants who died during the trial 
are included up until the event. The number 
of participants completing each assessment was 1004 
(79%) of 1267 participants at 3 months, 823 (65%) of 
1267 participants at 12 months, and 856 (68%) of 
1267 participants at 24 months. Using Pearson’s χ² test, 
there was a borderline significant association between the 
percentage of participants attending the 12-month 
appointment and intervention group (p=0·0475); no such 
association for participants completing the 24-month 
assessment was found (p=0·21). Examination of the effect 
of individual characteristics on attendance by intervention 
group showed no evidence of bias in attendance during 
the study (table 1). Analyses of biochemical risk factors 
are based on 837 (66%) of 1267 participants who provided 
a blood sample at baseline.
Participants had a mean BMI of 34·5 kg/m² (SD 5·2) 
and had a mean age of 53·2 years (13·8). 859 (68%) of 
1267 participants were female, 1136 (90%) were white, 
171 (13%) had diabetes, 631 (50%) had hypertension.
The weight trajectories of the three intervention groups 
at each timepoint using all measured weights are in 
figure 2. Mean weight change at 3 months was –2·04 kg 
(SE 0·30) after brief intervention, –4·84 kg (0·21) in the 
12-week programme, and –4·62 kg (0·18) in the 52-week 
programme. Participants in the behavioural programme 
groups (12 weeks and 52 weeks combined) lost more 
weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted 
difference –2·67 kg, 95% CI –3·28 to –2·07; p<0·0001] and 
there was no significant difference between the 12-week 
and 52-week programmes (0·22 kg, –0·26 to 0·69; 
p=0·371). The primary outcome of mean weight change at 
12 months was –3·26 kg (SE 0·68) in brief intervention, 
–4·75 kg (0·35) in the 12-week programme, and –6·76 kg

in the combined behavioural programme groups lost 
significantly more weight at 12 months than those who 
had a brief intervention (–2·71 kg, –3·86 to –1·55; 
p<0·0001) and participants in the 52-week programme lost 
significantly more weight than those in the 12-week

the 52-week programme lost significantly more weight 
than those who went on the 12-week programme (–1·32 kg, 
–2·46 to –0·18; p=0·0231; table 2).
Participants 
randomly 
assigned 
the 
12-week 
programme lost significantly more weight than the brief 
intervention group at 3 months (adjusted difference 
–2·79 kg, 95% CI –3·44 to –2·13; p<0·0001) and 
12 months (–1·61 kg, –2·84 to –0·38; p=0·0105), but 
there was no significant difference in weight loss between 
these groups at 24 months (–0·74 kg, –2·45 to 0·77; 
p=0·338).
Sensitivity analyses examining weight change with 
alternative assumptions about missing data gave similar 
results (appendix p 4). Research centre was not a 
predictor of weight change in any of the models. The 
intervention effect did not significantly differ by 
participant gender (p=0·48), educational attainment 
(p=0·79), or household income (p=0·64).
At 12-month follow-up, 57% of participants in the 
52-week programme had lost 5% or more of weight, 
compared with 42% in the 12-week programme and 25% 
in the brief intervention (table 3). Participants in the 
behavioural programme were significantly more likely 
than the brief intervention group to lose 5% or more 
bodyweight. Participants in the 52-week programme 
were significantly more likely than those in the 12-week 
programme to lose 5% or more weight (table 3).
At 12 months and 24 months, participants in the 
52-week programme had greater reductions in waist 
circumference and fat mass than participants in the 
12-week programme or brief intervention group (table 4). 
At 12 months, participants in the 52-week programme 
had greater reductions in HbA1c than those in the 12-week 
programme (adjusted difference –1·31 mmol/mol, 
95% CI –2·47 to –0·15; p=0·0268) and brief intervention 
(–2·65 mmol/mol, –4·28 to –1·01; p=0·0015) and greater 
reductions in fasting plasma glucose concentration than 
those in the 12-week programme (–0·29 mmol/L, 
–0·58 to 0·00; p=0·0497) and brief intervention 
(–0·46 mmol/L, –0·88 to –0·03; p=0·0342). There were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
12-week 
programme and brief intervention for either HbA1c or 
fasting glucose concentration. Changes over time in 
blood pressure, quality of life, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, 
and total cholesterol were small and no significant 
differences 
between 
groups 
were 
recorded. 
No 
participants reported adverse events related to the 
intervention.
At 3 months, 950 participants reported intervention 
use at 3 months. Seven (5%) of 132 participants in the 
brief intervention group had attended a commercial 
weight-management 
programme, 
compared 
with 
259 (68%) of 382 participants in the 12-week programme 
and 300 (69%) of 436 participants in the 52-week 
programme (table 5). Only ten (1%) of 950 participants in 
all groups attended an NHS-led programme and 
three (<1%) used weight-loss medication. For participants 
referred to the behavioural programmes, the mean 
number of sessions attended was 8·4 (SD 4·2) in the 
12-week programme and 28·2 (SD 14·8) in the 52-week 
programme. Full details of the economic evaluation are 
in the appendix (p 5). Briefly, intervention costs, 
including general practitioner referral time, are estimated 
at £18·50 (brief intervention), £60 (12-week programme), 
and £195 (52-week programme). There were no 
significant differences between groups in health-care 
resource use per participant over the 24-month follow-up 
period. The estimated incremental NHS cost per 
additional kg weight lost (expressed as £ per kg) was 
£91 per kg for the 12-week programme and £159 per kg 
for the 52-week programme. Analysis using a 1-year time 
horizon for consistency with other studies, reduced the 
ICER to £26 per kg for the 12-week programme and 
£75 per kg for the 52-week programme.
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (appendix 
p 11) is based on weight loss at 2 years and includes all 
NHS costs incurred during that time. If decision makers 
are willing to pay at least £60 per kg, then the 12-week 
programme would be the preferred strategy. If decision 
makers are willing to pay £200 per kg, then the 52-week 
programme is preferable. If costs are restricted to 
intervention-only 
costs, 
the 
52-week 
programme 
becomes the preferred strategy at £100 per kg.
Microsimulation modelling estimated that over 
25 years after the baseline year, the 12-week programme 
was dominant in health economic terms (cost-saving and 
resulted in greater health benefits) compared with the 
brief intervention. The 52-week programme was cost-
effective relative to the brief intervention (ICER 
£2493 per QALY) and the 12-week programme 
(£3804 per QALY).
By comparison with the brief intervention, the 12-week 
programme resulted in 623 fewer incident cases of disease, 
643 additional QALYs, and a cost-saving of approximately 
£268 000 per 100 000 individuals. By comparison with the 
12-week programme, the 52-week programme resulted in

1786 fewer incident cases of disease and generated 1282 
additional QALYs, at a cost of approximately £4·9 million 
per 100 000 individuals (for further details see appendix p 17).
Discussion
Adults in primary care who were overweight or obese and 
who were referred to an open-group behavioural weight-
management programme lost more weight at 12-month 
follow-up than those who were given brief advice and self-
help materials. People who were referred to this 
behavioural programme for 52 weeks lost more weight 
than those who were referred for 12 weeks. 57% of 
participants referred to the 52-week programme lost 
more than 5% weight, compared with 42% referred to the 
12-week programme and 25% of those in the brief 
intervention group. 5% weight loss is often used as a cut-
off for clinically significant weight loss, although even 
smaller weight losses are associated with improvements 
in markers of cardiovascular disease risk.20 All groups 
regained some of the weight lost and at 24 months the 
difference in weight loss between the 12-week programme 
and the brief intervention was no longer significant, 
whereas the weight loss in the 52-week programme was 
significantly higher than both other groups. Participants 
in the 52-week programme also had larger reductions 
in waist circumference, fat mass, fasting glucose 
concentration, and HbA1c than participants in the 12-week 
programme and the brief intervention. When the impact 
of the 12-week programme was modelled over 25 years, it 
was cost-saving compared with the brief intervention. 
Although the 52-week programme was more expensive in 
the within-trial analysis, when the impact was modelled 
over 25 years, the 52-week programme resulted in the 
greatest gain in QALYs and the greatest reduction in 
disease incidence. By standards set by the National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the 52-week 
programme is cost-effective compared with the brief 
intervention 
and 
the 
12-week 
programme. 
This 
assessment of cost-effectiveness does not include 
potential further savings in social care and indirect 
health-care costs. It also uses a flat-rate cost for all 
participants who took up an intervention, whereas, in 
some payment models, full costs might not be incurred if 
people did not complete the course, thus potentially 
overestimating intervention costs.
A strength of this trial is the large patient group that is 
broadly generalisable to the UK population. In our 
previous trial,13 participants with a BMI of 27–35 kg/m² 
were identified during routine consultations and 
recruited to the trial. This trial was more inclusive (BMI 
28–68 kg/m²) and participants were recruited by letter 
based on their weight records. In the 2011 trial, the mean 
BMI was 31·4 kg/m² whereas in the present study 
participants had a mean BMI of 34·5 kg/m², which is 
more comparable to the population typically referred to 
open-group behavioural programmes in NHS referral 
schemes.21 Invitation of all eligible patients by mail 
resulted in a higher proportion of men recruited than

socioeconomic groups.23 Most participants were white, 
with the proportion enrolled reflecting the ethnic 
composition of the UK.22 Intervention effects did not 
vary by gender or socioeconomic status. This finding 
is striking given often repeated views that these 
interventions are not appropriate for men and concerns 
that individual behavioural interventions exacerbate 
socioeconomic inequalities in health.24,25 Taken together, 
the findings suggest that the intervention effects reported 
here might be generalisable to the UK adult population. 
Although uptake of the programmes by more deprived 
populations is somewhat lower than in less deprived 
areas,23 more targeted schemes, as have been implemented 
elsewhere,14 might reduce health inequalities.
Loss to follow-up at 1 year in our study was slightly 
below average for weight-loss trials,26 and there was little 
attrition between 1 and 2 years. Three different intention-
to-treat analyses were done that each make different 
assumptions about missing data, as well as two sensitivity 
analyses. The consistency of effects shows the robustness 
of our findings. The pragmatic nature of the trial meant 
that participants in all groups were free to use other 
weight-loss methods during the trial. This reflects how 
these interventions are routinely delivered and allows 
direct translation of these findings to clinical practice. 
Only very few participants in each group used other NHS 
interventions or weight-loss medications, and only a small 
proportion of participants who were assigned to the brief 
intervention group went on to use a commercial weight-
loss programme. A strength of this trial is the 2-year 
follow-up of participants, which gives important 
information on weight trajectories after participation in 
the programme ends. The modelled cost-effectiveness 
over 25 years is based on assumptions about weight 
trajectories beyond 2 years; however, we have been 
conservative in these assumptions, assuming all weight 
lost is regained within 5 years. The within-trial ICERs are 
strongly affected by non-significant differences between 
groups in health-care costs (highest in the 52-week 
programme and lowest in the 12-week programme). 
However, sensitivity analyses (appendix p 9) provide 
information with which to assess the strength of these 
findings. Fasting status when blood was taken was self-
reported and could be susceptible to reporting bias or 
recall bias. Reliance on participants confirming that the 
blood sample was taken in a fasting state is a universal 
concern in any free-living study and findings related to 
glucose were congruent with findings for HbA1c, which is 
not affected by fasting status. Attendance at sessions was 
self-reported and could be susceptible to reporting, or 
recall bias, or both. However, any bias in the attendance 
data does not affect the prespecified outcomes, which 
were done on an intention-to-treat basis.
The weight losses seen in this study are consistent with 
previous trials13,14,27 of referrals to 12-week and 52-week 
commercial, open-group behavioural weight-management 
programmes, suggesting that our findings are robust. 
Estimates of the mean incremental cost per additional kg 
of bodyweight lost for either duration of treatment are in 
the range of other behavioural programmes (appendix p 12). 
The reductions in fasting glucose concentration and HbA1c 
were not seen in our previous trial13 of the 52-week 
programme, perhaps because the lower baseline BMI and 
stricter inclusion criteria in that study meant that 
participants had lower baseline values than in this study. 
Almost half of participants in the present trial had elevated 
fasting glucose concentration, HbA1c, or both at baseline. 
Reductions seen in participants in the 52-week programme 
group at 12 months (–0·5 mmol/L fasting glucose and 
–2·8 mmol/mol HbA1c [–0·24% HbA1c]) are larger than 
those seen at the same timepoint in the intensive lifestyle 
intervention arm of the Diabetes Prevention Programme 
(DPP; approximately –0·4 mmol/L fasting glucose and 
–1 mmol/mol HbA1c
28), in which participants were similar 
to those in the present study in baseline BMI, HbA1c, and 
fasting glucose concentration, and had similar weight loss 
at 12 months, but achieved at a fraction of the cost.29

associated risk factors observed over 15 years of follow-up, 
DPP achieved a 27% reduction in the cumulative incidence 
of diabetes in the lifestyle intervention relative to the 
control group.30 However, the impact of these more scalable 
interventions on diabetes incidence will depend on 
whether longer term weight trajectories are similar.
The weight-loss programme we assessed is widely 
available and participants in the brief intervention group 
were neither encouraged nor discouraged from attending 
other weight-loss programmes. Only one in 20 chose to do 
so, compared with 14 in 20 of those referred to these 
programmes. In the 12-week group, 19% of participants 
were still attending the programme 12 months later at their 
own cost, compared with 9% of those in the brief 
intervention. This finding suggests a legacy effect of the 
initial referral. However, this proportion of participants is 
lower than that of the 52-week group (42% of participants 
were still attending at 12 months). Because the median 
household income was about £30 000, many people would 
probably have been able to afford the programme 
(approximately £5 per week) suggesting that the act of 
referral itself might have been the source of motivation to 
attend, although it is impossible to exclude the possibility 
that lower attendance in other groups was related to the 
cost. The importance of the referral is supported by 
qualitative data that found the general practioner referral is 
perceived as an implicit recommendation of the programme 
and the allocation of NHS resources to enable their 
attendance increases motivation to attend.31 These findings 
are supported by another trial32 in people who were obese 
attending a general practitioner consultation unrelated to 
their weight, in which 77% who agreed to participate in the 
trial and were offered a referral to a weight-management 
programme accepted it and 40% attended the programme.
The absolute weight loss in participants who had 
the brief intervention also warrants consideration. 
Participants given 5 min of non-tailored advice and a self-
help booklet lost more than 3 kg at 12 months and more 
than 2 kg at 24 months. Weight change in this group is 
higher than the average weight loss observed in a meta-
analysis3 for interventions led by generalist primary care 
teams, and higher than the average weight loss seen in a 
systematic review33 of self-help interventions. Given the 
small cost of this intervention (self-help booklet and three 
short appointments that could be given by a nurse or 
health-care assistant), observational data support the 
implementation of this intervention as a minimal 
standard in primary care. However, this finding highlights 
the importance of including a control group when 
evaluating the effects of weight-loss interventions. 
Findings from a review34 have shown that control groups 
given minimal interventions will generally lose weight 
over the course of a trial. The absolute weight loss of 
control groups was considerably heterogeneous in this 
review,34 which might reflect differences in study 
populations and trial design. Our trial illustrates this 
disparity between trials, showing 3·3 kg weight loss in 
the brief intervention control group, when an almost 
identical brief intervention resulted in less than 1 kg 
weight loss when used as a control group in a different 
population and context.35
This trial shows that referral to this commercial open-
group behavioural weight-loss programme increases 
weight loss relative to a brief intervention in primary 
care. Increasing the duration of the programme from 
12 weeks to 52 weeks increases weight loss and 
improvements in other markers of diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk, most notably HBA1c and fasting 
glucose concentration. Economic evaluation of this trial 
found that although the 52-week programme requires 
greater initial investment, the programme is likely to 
be cost-effective in the long-term and health-care 
providers should consider a move towards extended 
referral schemes.
