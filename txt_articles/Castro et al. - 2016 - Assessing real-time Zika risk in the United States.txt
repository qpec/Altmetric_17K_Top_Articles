 Abstract 
27 
Background: Confirmed local transmission of Zika Virus (ZIKV) in Texas and Florida have 
28 
heightened the need for early and accurate indicators of self-sustaining transmission in high risk 
29 
areas across the southern United States. Given ZIKV’s low reporting rates and the geographic 
30 
variability in suitable conditions, a cluster of reported cases may reflect diverse scenarios, ranging 
31 
from independent introductions to a self-sustaining local epidemic. 
32 
Methods: We present a quantitative framework for real-time ZIKV risk assessment that captures 
33 
uncertainty in case reporting, importations, and vector-human transmission dynamics. 
34 
Results: We assessed county-level risk throughout Texas, as of summer 2016, and found that 
35 
importation risk was concentrated in large metropolitan regions, while sustained ZIKV 
36 
transmission risk is concentrated in the southeastern counties including the Houston metropolitan 
37 
region and the Texas-Mexico border (where the sole autochthonous cases have occurred in 2016). 
38 
We found that counties most likely to detect cases are not necessarily the most likely to 
39 
experience epidemics, and used our framework to identify triggers to signal the start of an 
40 
epidemic based on a policymakers propensity for risk. 
41 
Conclusions: This framework can inform the strategic timing and spatial allocation of public 
42 
health resources to combat ZIKV throughout the US, and highlights the need to develop methods 
43 
to obtain reliable estimates of key epidemiological parameters.

 Background 
53 
In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus (ZIKV) a 
54 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1]. Though the Public Health Emergency has 
55 
been lifted, ZIKV still poses a great threat for reemergence in susceptible regions in seasons to 
56 
come [2].  In the US, the 268 reported mosquito-borne autochthonous (local) ZIKV cases 
57 
occurred in Southern Florida and Texas, with the potential range of a primary ZIKV vector, 
58 
Aedes aegypti, including over 30 states [3–5]. Of the 2,487 identified imported ZIKV cases in the 
59 
US through the end of August, 137 had occurred in Texas. Given historic small, autochthonous 
60 
outbreaks (ranging from 4 - 25 confirmed cases) of another arbovirus vectored by Ae. Aegypti—
61 
dengue (DENV) [5–7], Texas was known to be at risk for autochthonous arbovirus transmission, 
62 
and the recent outbreaks have highlighted the need for increased surveillance and optimized 
63 
resource allocation in the states and the rest of the vulnerable regions of the Southern United 
64 
States. 
65 
As additional ZIKV waves are possible in summer 2017, public health professionals will 
66 
continue to face considerable uncertainty in gauging the severity, geographic range of local 
67 
outbreaks, and appropriate timing of interventions, given the large fraction of undetected ZIKV 
68 
cases (asymptomatic) and economic tradeoffs of disease prevention and response [8–11]. 
69 
Depending on the ZIKV symptomatic fraction, reliability and rapidity of diagnostics, importation 
70 
rate, and transmission rate, the detection of five autochthonous cases in a Texas county, for 
71 
example, may indicate a small chain of cases from a single importation, a self-limiting outbreak, 
72 
or a large, hidden epidemic underway (Fig 1). These diverging possibilities have precedents. In 
73 
French Polynesia, a handful of ZIKV cases were reported by October 2013; two months later an 
74 
estimated 14,000-29,000 individuals had been infected [8,9]. By contrast, Anguilla had 17 
75 
confirmed cases from late 2015 into 2016 without a subsequent epidemic, despite large ZIKV 
76 
epidemics in surrounding countries [12]. To address the uncertainty, the CDC issued guidelines

84 
in both. By the 100th day, the outbreak (A) has died out with 21 total infections while the epidemic (B) continues to 
85 
grow with already 67 total infections. Each scenario is a single stochastic realization of the model with R0=1.1, 
86

88 
Previous risk assessments of ZIKV have provided static a priori assessments based on 
89 
historical incidence and vector suitability, but they do not provide dynamic risk assessments as 
90 
cases accumulate in a region. Here, we present a framework to support real-time risk assessment, 
91 
and demonstrate its application in Texas. Our framework accounts for the uncertainty regarding 
92 
ZIKV epidemiology, including importation rates, reporting rates, local vector populations, and 
93 
socioeconomic conditions, and can be readily updated as our understanding of ZIKV evolves. To 
94 
estimate current and future epidemic risk from real-time ZIKV case reports, the model 
95 
incorporates a previously published method for estimating local ZIKV transmission risk and a 
96 
new model for estimating local importation risk. Across Texas’ 254 counties, we find that the 
97 
estimated risk of a locally sustained ZIKV outbreak rises precipitously as autochthonous cases 
98 
accumulate, and that counties at the southern tip of the Texas-Mexico border and in the Houston 
99 
Metropolitan Area are at the highest risk for ZIKV transmission. This statewide variation in risk 
100 
stems primarily from mosquito suitability and socio-environmental constraints on ZIKV 
101 
transmission rather than heterogeneity in importation rates.

 Methods 
105 
Our risk-assessment framework is divided into three sections: (1) county-level 
106 
epidemiological estimates of ZIKV importation and relative transmission rates, (2) county-
107 
specific ZIKV outbreak simulations, and (3) ZIKV risk analysis (Fig S1). To demonstrate this 
108 
approach, we estimate county-level ZIKV risks throughout the state of Texas for August 2016, 
109 
given that, by May 2016, Texas experienced dozens of ZIKV importations without subsequent 
110 
vector-borne transmission. 
111 
  
112 
Estimating Importation Rates 
113 
Our analysis assumes that any ZIKV outbreaks in Texas originate with infected travelers 
114 
returning from active ZIKV regions. To estimate the ZIKV importation rate for specific counties, 
115 
we (1) estimated the Texas statewide importation rate (expected number of imported cases per 
116 
day) for August 2016, (2) estimated the probability (import risk) that the next Texas import will 
117 
arrive in each county, and (3) took the product of the state importation rate and each county 
118 
importation probability. 
119 
1. During the first quarter of 2016, 27 ZIKV travel-associated cases were reported in Texas [5], 
120 
yielding a baseline first quarter estimate of 0.3 imported cases/day throughout Texas. In 2014 
121 
and 2015, arbovirus introductions into Texas increased threefold over this same time period, 
122 
perhaps driven by seasonal increases in arbovirus activity in endemic regions and the 
123 
approximately 40% increase from quarter 1 to quarter 3 in international travelers to the US 
124 
[14].  Taking this as a baseline (lower bound) scenario, we projected a corresponding 
125 
increase in ZIKV importations to 0.9 cases/day (statewide) for the third quarter. 
126 
2. To build a predictive model for import risk, we fit a probabilistic model (maximum entropy) 
127 
[15] of importation risk to 183 DENV, 38 CHIKV, and 31 ZIKV Texas county-level reported 
128 
importations from 2002 to 2016 and 10 informative socioeconomic, environmental, and 
129 
travel variables (Supplement §1.1). Given the geographic and biological overlap between

 ZIKV, DENV and Chikungunya (CHIKV), we used historical DENV and CHIKV 
131 
importation data to supplement ZIKV importations in the importation risk model, while 
132 
recognizing that future ZIKV importations may be fueled by large epidemic waves in 
133 
neighboring regions and summer travel, and thus far exceed recent DENV and CHIKV 
134 
importations [16]. Currently, DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV importation patterns differ most 
135 
noticeably along the Texas-Mexico border. Endemic DENV transmission and sporadic 
136 
CHIKV outbreaks in Mexico historically have spilled over into neighboring Texas counties. 
137 
In contrast, ZIKV is not yet as widespread in Mexico as it is in Central and South America, 
138 
with less than 10 reported ZIKV importations along the border to date (October 2016).  We 
139 
included DENV and CHIKV importation data in the model fitting so as to consider potential 
140 
future importation pressure from Mexico, as ZIKV continues its increasing trend since March 
141 
2016 [17]. To find informative predictors for ZIKV importation risk, we analyzed 72 socio-
142 
economic, environmental, and travel variables, and removed near duplicate variables and 
143 
those that contributed least to model performance, based on out-of-sample cross validation of 
144 
training and testing sets of data [18,19], reducing the original set of 72 variables to 10 (Tables 
145 
S3-S4).  We validated our importation model by comparing the predicted distribution of 
146 
cases across the state given a total number of imported cases (September 2016) as a linear 
147 
predictor of the empirical distribution of cases across counties.   
148

County Transmission Rates (R0) 
150 
The risk of ZIKV emergence following an imported case will depend on the likelihood of 
151 
mosquito-borne transmission. For emerging diseases like ZIKV, the public health and research 
152 
communities initially face considerable uncertainty in the drivers and rates of transmission, given 
153 
the lack of field and experimental studies and epidemiological data, and often derive insights 
154 
through analogy to similar diseases. For our case study, we estimated county-level ZIKV 
155 
transmission potential by Ae. aegypti using a recently published model [20], that derives some of

 its key parameters from DENV data. The utility of our framework depends on the validity of such 
157 
estimates and will increase as our knowledge of ZIKV improves.  However, we expect our results 
158 
to be robust to most sources of uncertainty regarding ZIKV and DENV epidemiology, as they 
159 
may influence the absolute but not relative county-level risks.  
160 
We estimated the ZIKV reproduction number (R0), the average number of secondary 
161 
infections caused by a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible population, for each 
162 
Texas county following the method described in Perkins et al [20]. The method calculates R0 
163 
using a temperature-dependent formulation of the Ross-Macdonald model, where mosquito 
164 
mortality rate (μ) and extrinsic incubation period of ZIKV (n) are temperature dependent 
165 
functions; the human-mosquito transmission probability (b = 0.4), number of days of human 
166 
infectiousness (c/r = 3.5), and the mosquito biting rate (a = 0.67) are held constant at previously 
167 
calculated values [20–25]; and the economic-modulated mosquito-human contact scaling factor 
168 
(m) is a function of county mosquito abundance and GDP data fit to historic ZIKV 
169 
seroprevalence data [20]. To account for uncertainty in the temperature-dependent functions (the 
170 
extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and mosquito mortality rate) and in the relationship between 
171 
economic index and the mosquito-to-human contact rate, Perkins et al. generated functional 
172 
distributions via 1000 Monte Carlo samples from the underlying parameter distributions. We 
173 
assume DENV estimates for these temperature-dependent functions, since we lack such data for 
174 
ZIKV and these Flaviviruses are likely to exhibit similar relationships between temperature and 
175 
EIP in Ae. Aegypti [25]. We used the resulting distributions to estimate R0 for each county, based 
176 
on county estimates for the average August temperature, mosquito abundance from Kraemer et al 
177 
[24], and GDP [25]. Our R0 estimates were similar to those reported by Perkins et al. [20] with 
178 
95% confidence intervals spanning from 0 to 3.1 (Fig S3). Given this uncertainty, and that our 
179 
primary aim is to demonstrate the risk assessment framework rather than provide accurate 
180 
estimates of R0 for Texas, we use these estimates to estimate relative county-level transmission 
181 
risks (by scaling the county R0 estimates from 0 to 1). In each simulation, we assume that a

 county’s R0 is the product of its relative risk and a chosen maximum R0. For our case study, we 
183 
assume a maximum county-level R0 of 1.5 This is consistent with historical arbovirus activity in 
184 
Texas (which has never sustained a large arbovirus epidemic) and demonstrates the particular 
185 
utility of the approach in distinguishing outbreaks from epidemics around the epidemic threshold 
186 
of R0 = 1.  
187 
 
188 
ZIKV Outbreak Simulation Model 
189 
Assuming mosquito-borne transmission as the main driver of epidemic dynamics, to 
190 
transmit ZIKV, a mosquito must bite an infected human, the mosquito must get infected with the 
191 
virus, and then the infected mosquito must bite a susceptible human. Rather than explicitly model 
192 
the full transmission cycle, we aggregated the two-part cycle of ZIKV transmission (mosquito-to-
193 
human and human-to-mosquito) into a single exposure period where the individual has been 
194 
infected by ZIKV, but not yet infectious, and do not explicitly model mosquitos. For the purposes 
195 
of this study, we need only ensure that the model produces a realistic human-to-human generation 
196 
time of ZIKV transmission, and the simpler model is more flexible to disease transmission 
197 
pathways. We fit the generation time of the ZIKV model to early ZIKV Epidemiological 
198 
estimates, with further fitting details described in Supplemental §2.4. 
199 
The resultant model thus follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) 
200 
transmission process stemming from a single ZIKV infection using a Markov branching process 
201 
model (Fig S4).  The temporal evolution of the compartments is governed by daily probabilities 
202 
of infected individuals transitioning between disease states. New cases arise from importations or 
203 
autochthonous transmission  (Table S5). We treat days as discrete time steps, and the next disease 
204 
state progression depends solely on the current state and the transition probabilities. We assume 
205 
that infectious cases cause a Poisson distributed number of secondary cases per day (via human to 
206 
mosquito to human transmission), but this assumption can be relaxed as more information 
207 
regarding the distribution of secondary cases becomes available. We also assume infectious

 individuals are introduced daily according to a Poisson distributed number of cases around the 
209 
importation rate. Furthermore, Infectious cases are categorized into reported and unreported cases 
210 
according to a reporting rate. We assume that reporting rates approximately correspond to the 
211 
percentage (~20%) of symptomatic ZIKV infections [10] and occur at the same rate for imported 
212 
and locally acquired cases. Additionally, we make the simplifying assumption that reported cases 
213 
transmit ZIKV at the same rate as unreported cases. We track imported and autochthonous cases 
214 
separately, and conduct risk analyses based on reported autochthonous cases only, under the 
215 
assumption that public health officials will have immediate and reliable travel histories for all 
216 
reported cases [13]. 
217 
  
218 
Simulations 
219 
For each county risk scenario, defined by an importation rate, transmission rate, and 
220 
reporting rate, we ran 10,000 stochastic simulations. Each simulation began with one imported 
221 
infectious case and terminated either when there were no individuals in either the Exposed or 
222 
Infectious classes or the cumulative number of autochthonous infections reached 2,000. Thus the 
223 
total outbreak time may differ across simulations. We held R0 constant throughout each 
224 
simulation, as we sought to model early outbreak dynamics over short periods (relative to the 
225 
seasonality of transmission) following introduction. We classified simulations as either epidemics 
226 
or self-limiting outbreaks; epidemics were simulations that fulfilled two criteria: reached 2,000 
227 
cumulative autochthonous infections and had a maximum daily prevalence (defined as the 
228 
number of current infectious cases) exceeding 50 autochthonous cases (Fig S6). The second 
229 
criterion distinguishes simulations resulting in large self-sustaining outbreaks (that achieve 
230 
substantial peaks) from those that accumulate infections through a series of small, independent 
231 
clusters (that fail to reach the daily prevalence threshold). The latter occurs occasionally under 
232 
low R0s and high importation rates scenarios.

 To verify that our simulations do not aggregate cases from clear temporally separate 
234 
clusters, we calculated the distribution of times between sequential cases (Fig S7). In our 
235 
simulated epidemics, almost all sequentially occurring cases occur within 14 days of each other, 
236 
consistent with the CDC’s threshold for identifying local transmission events (based on the 
237 
estimated maximum duration of the ZIKV incubation period) [13]. 
238 
  
239 
Outbreak Analysis 
240 
Our stochastic framework allows us to provide multiple forms of real-time county-level 
241 
risk assessments as reported cases accumulate. For each county, we found the probability that an 
242 
outbreak will progress into an epidemic, as defined above, as a function of the number of reported 
243 
autochthonous cases. We call this epidemic risk. To solve for epidemic risk in a county following 
244 
the xth reported autochthonous case, we first find all simulations that experience at least x 
245 
reported autochthonous cases, and then calculate the proportion of those that are ultimately 
246 
classified as epidemics. For example, consider a county in which 1,000 of 10,000 simulated 
247 
outbreaks reach at least two reported autochthonous cases and only 50 of the 1,000 simulations 
248 
ultimately fulfill the two epidemic criteria; the probability of detecting two cases in the county 
249 
would be 10% and the estimated epidemic risk following two reported cases in that county would 
250 
be 5%. This simple epidemic classification scheme rarely misclassifies a string of small outbreaks 
251 
as an epidemic, with the probability of such an error increasing with the importation rate. For 
252 
example, epidemics should not occur when R0=0.9. If the importation rate is high, overlapping 
253 
series of moderate outbreaks occasionally meet the two epidemic criteria. Under the highest 
254 
importation rate we considered (0.3 cases/day), only 1% of outbreaks were misclassified. 
255 
This method can be applied to evaluate universal triggers (like the recommended two-
256 
case trigger) or derive robust triggers based on risk tolerance of public health agencies. For 
257 
example, if a policymaker would like to initiate interventions as soon as the risk of an epidemic 
258 
reaches 30%, we would simulate local ZIKV transmission and solve for the number of reported

 cases at which the probability of an epidemic first exceeds 30%. Generally, the recommended 
260 
triggers decrease (fewer reported cases) as the policymaker threshold for action decreases, (e.g. 
261 
10% versus 30% threshold) and as the local transmission potential increases (e.g. R0 = 1.5 versus 
262 
R0 = 1.2).

Results 
265 
ZIKV importation risk within Texas is predicted by variables reflecting urbanization, 
266 
mobility patterns, and socioeconomic status (Table S3), and is concentrated in metropolitan 
267 
counties of Texas (Fig 2A). In comparing the predictions of this model to out-of-sample data 
268 
from April to September 2016, the model underestimated the statewide total number of 
269 
importations (81 vs 151), but robustly predicted the relative importation rates between counties  
270 
(β=0.97, R2=0.74, p < 0.001). The two highest risk counties--Harris, which includes Houston, and 
271 
Travis, which includes Austin, have an estimated 27% and 10% chance of receiving the next 
272 
imported Texas case respectively and contain international airports.

 rather than absolute transmission risks. For purposes of demonstration, we assumed a plausible 
287 
maximum county-level R0 of 1.5, which closely followed our median estimates, and scaled the  
288 
transmission risk for each county accordingly. The following risk analyses can be readily refined 
289 
as we gain more precise and localized estimates of ZIKA transmission potential.

296 
policy-maker plans to trigger a public health response as soon as a second case is reported (vertical line). Under a 10% 
297 
reporting rate, this trigger would correspond to a 49% probability of an ensuing epidemic. Under a 20% reporting rate, 
298 
the probability would be 25%.

300 
Wide ranges of outbreaks are possible under a single set of epidemiological conditions 
301 
(Fig 3A). The relationship between what policymakers can observe (cumulative reported cases) 
302 
and what they wish to know (current underlying disease prevalence) can be obscured by such 
303 
uncertainty, and will depend critically on reporting rates (Fig 3B). Under a scenario estimated for 
304 
Cameron County which experienced the only autochthonous ZIKV transmission in Texas and 
305 
with a 20% reporting rate, ten linked and reported autochthonous cases correspond to 6 currently 
306 
circulating cases with a 95% CI of 1-16 from inherent, early-stage outbreak stochasticity. From 
307 
this wide range of outbreak trajectories, we can characterize time-varying epidemic risk as cases 
308 
accumulate in a given county. We track the probability of epidemic expansion following each 
309 
additional reported case in high and low reporting rate scenarios (Fig 3C). 
310 
These curves can support both real-time risk assessment as cases accumulate and the 
311 
identification of surveillance triggers indicating when risk exceeds a specified threshold. For 
312 
example, suppose a policymaker wanted to initiate an intervention upon two reported cases, this

314 
25% if the reporting rate is doubled.. Alternatively suppose a policy maker wishes to initiate an 
315 
intervention when the chance of an epidemic exceeds 50%. In the low reporting rate scenario, 
316 
they should act immediately following the third autochthonous reported case, but could wait until 
317 
the eleventh case with the high reporting rate.

324 
White counties indicate that fewer than 1% of the 10,000 simulated outbreaks reached two reported cases. All three 
325 
maps assume a 20% reporting rate and a baseline importation scenario for August 2016 (81 cases statewide per 90 
326 
days) projected from historical arbovirus data. (Figure S5 provides corresponding estimates under a worse case 
327 
elevated importation scenario). 
328 
  
329 
To evaluate a universal intervention trigger of two reported autochthonous cases, we 
330 
estimate both the probability of two reported cases in each county and the level of epidemic risk 
331 
at the moment the trigger event occurs (second case reported). Assuming a baseline importation 
332 
rate extrapolated from importation levels in March 2016 to August 2016, county R0 scaled from a 
333 
maximum of 1.5, and a 20% reporting rate, only a minority of counties are likely to experience a 
334 
trigger event (Fig 4A). While 247 of the 254 counties (97%) have non-zero probabilities of 
335 
experiencing two reported autochthonous cases, only 86 counties have at least a 10% chance of 
336 
such an event (assuming they experience at least one importation), with the remaining 168 
337 
counties having a median probability of 0.0038 (range 0.0005 to 0.087). Assuming that a second 
338 
autochthonous case has indeed been reported, we find that the underlying epidemic risk varies 
339 
widely among the 247 counties, with most counties having near zero epidemic probabilities and a

 few counties far exceeding a 50% chance of epidemic expansion. For example, two reported 
341 
autochthonous cases in Harris County, correspond to a 99% chance of ongoing transmission that 
342 
would proceed to epidemic proportions without intervention, with the rest of the Houston 
343 
metropolitan also at relatively high risk ranging from 0 (Galveston) to 90% (Waller) (Fig 4B).  
 
344 
Given that a universal trigger may signal disparate levels of ZIKV risk, policy makers might seek 
345 
to adapt their triggers to local conditions. Suppose a policymaker wishes to design triggers that 
346 
indicate a 50% chance of an emerging epidemic (Fig 4C). Under the baseline importation and 
347 
reporting rates, an estimated 31 of the 254 counties in Texas are expected to reach a 50% 
348 
epidemic probability, with triggers ranging from one (Harris County) to 21 (Jefferson County) 
349 
reported autochthonous cases, with a median of two cases. Counties who detect cases simply due 
350 
to high importation rates do not have triggers, and the magnitude of a trigger helps quantify a 
351 
county’s absolute risk for an epidemic as a function of the reported autochthonous cases.

353 
Discussion 
354 
Our framework provides a data-driven approach to estimating ZIKA emergence risks 
355 
from potentially sparse and biased surveillance data [26,27]. By mapping observed cases to 
356 
current and future risks, in the face of considerable uncertainty, the approach can also be used to 
357 
design public health action plans and evaluate the utility of local versus regional triggers. We 
358 
demonstrate its application across the 254 ecologically and demographically diverse counties of 
359 
Texas, one of the two states that has sustained autochthonous ZIKV outbreaks [6,7]. The 
360 
approach requires local estimates of ZIKV importation and transmission rates. For the Texas 
361 
analysis, we developed a novel model for estimating county-level ZIKV importation risk and 
362 
applied published methods to estimate relative county-level transmission risks (Fig 2). We expect 
363 
that most Texas counties are not at risk for a sustained ZIKV epidemic (Fig 4), and find that 
364 
many of the highest risk counties lie in the southeastern region surrounding the Houston 
365 
metropolitan area and the lower Rio Grande valley. However, R0 estimates are uncertain, leaving

 the possibility that the R0 could be as high as other high risk regions that sustained epidemics 
367 
[20,28,29]. Our analysis is consistent with historic DENV and CHIKV outbreaks and correctly 
368 
identifies Cameron county, the only Texas county to have reported local transmission, as a 
369 
potential ZIKV hot-spot, especially when November estimates are used [30] (Fig S9). 
370 
Surveillance triggers--guidelines specifying situations that warrant intervention--are a key 
371 
component of many public health response plans. Given the urgency and uncertainty surrounding 
372 
ZIKV, universal recommendations can be both pragmatic and judicious. To assist Texas 
373 
policymakers in interpreting the two-case trigger for intervention guidelines issued by the CDC 
374 
[13], we used our framework to integrate importation and transmission risks and assess the 
375 
likelihood and implication of a two-case event for each of Texas’ 254 counties, under a scenario 
376 
projected from recent ZIKV data to August 2016. Across counties, there is enormous variation in 
377 
both the chance of a trigger and the magnitude of the public health threat if and when two cases 
378 
are reported. Given this variation, rather than implement a universal trigger, which may 
379 
correspond to different threats in different locations, one could design local surveillance triggers 
380 
that correspond to a universal risk threshold. Our modeling framework can readily identify 
381 
triggers (numbers of reported cases) for indicating any specified epidemic event (e.g., prevalence 
382 
reaching a threshold or imminent epidemic expansion) with any specified risk tolerance (e.g., 
383 
10% or 50% chance of that the event has occurred), given local epidemiological conditions. We 
384 
found close agreement between the recommended two-case trigger and our epidemic derived 
385 
triggers based on a 50% probability of expansion.  Of the 30 counties with derived triggers, the 
386 
median trigger was 2, ranging from one to 21 reported autochthonous cases. These findings apply 
387 
only to the early, pre-epidemic phase of ZIKV in Texas, when importations occur primarily via 
388 
travel from affected regions outside the contiguous US. . 
389 
These analyses highlight critical gaps in our understanding of ZIKV biology and 
390 
epidemiology. The relative transmission risks among Texas counties appear fairly robust to these 
391 
uncertainties, allowing us to identify high risk regions, including Cameron County in the Lower

 Rio Grande Valley. Public health agencies might therefore prioritize such counties for 
393 
surveillance and interventions resources. Given the minimal incursions of DENV and CHIKV 
394 
into Texas over that past eleven years since the first DENV outbreak in Cameron County, and the 
395 
high number of importations into putative hotspot counties without autochthonous transmission, 
396 
we suspect that, if anything, we may be underestimating the socioeconomic and behavioral 
397 
impediments to ZIKV transmission in the contiguous US. Our analysis also reveals the significant 
398 
impact of the reporting rate on the timeliness and precision of detection. If only a small fraction 
399 
of cases are reported, the first few reported cases may correspond to an isolated introduction or a 
400 
growing epidemic. In contrast, if most cases are reported, policymakers can wait longer for cases 
401 
to accumulate to trigger interventions and have more confidence in their epidemiological 
402 
assessments. ZIKV reporting rates are expected to remain low, because an estimated 80% of 
403 
infections are asymptomatic, and DENV reporting rates have historically matched its 
404 
asymptomatic proportion [10,31]. Obtaining a realistic estimate of the ZIKV reporting rate is 
405 
arguably as important as increasing the rate itself, with respect to reliable situational awareness 
406 
and forecasting. An estimated 8-22% of ZIKV infections were reported during the 2013-2014 
407 
outbreak in French Polynesia [29]; however estimates ranging from 1 to 10% have been reported 
408 
during the ongoing epidemic in Columbia [2,28]. While these provide a baseline estimate for the 
409 
US, there are many factors that could increase (or decrease) the reporting rate, such as ZIKV 
410 
awareness among both the public and health-care practitioners, or active surveillance of regions 
411 
with recent ZIKV cases. Our analysis assumes that all counties have the same case detection 
412 
probabilities. However, only 40 of the 254 Texas counties maintain active mosquito surveillance 
413 
and control programs, potentially leading to differences in case detection rates and surveillance 
414 
efficacy throughout the state [32]. Thus, rapid estimation of the reporting rate using both 
415 
traditional epidemiological data and new viral sequenced based methods [33] should be a high 
416 
priority as they become available.

 Conclusions 
419 
Our framework can support the development of response plans, by forcing policymakers 
420 
to be explicit about risk tolerance, that is, the certainty needed before sounding an alarm, and 
421 
quantifying the consequences of premature or delayed interventions. For example, should ZIKV-
422 
related pregnancy advisories be issued when there is only 5% chance of an impending epidemic? 
423 
10% chance? 80%? A policymaker has to weigh the costs of false positives--resulting in 
424 
unnecessary fear and/or intervention--and false negatives--resulting in suboptimal disease control 
425 
and prevention--complicated by the difficulty inherent in distinguishing a false positive from a 
426 
successful intervention. The more risk averse the policymaker (with respect to false negatives), 
427 
the earlier the trigger should be, which can be exacerbated by low reporting rates, high 
428 
importation rate, and inherent ZIKV transmission potential. In ZIKV prone regions with low 
429 
reporting rates, even risk tolerant policymakers should act quickly upon seeing initial cases; in 
430 
lower risk regions, longer waiting periods may be prudent.
