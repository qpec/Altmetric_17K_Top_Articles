Abstract
Aim: To quantify the occurrence of alcohol content, including alcohol branding, in the popular pri-
metime television UK Reality TV show ‘Geordie Shore’ Series 11.
Methods: A 1-min interval coding content analysis of alcohol content in the entire DVD Series 11
of ‘Geordie Shore’ (10 episodes). Occurrence of alcohol use, implied use, other alcohol reference/
paraphernalia or branding was recorded.
Results: All categories of alcohol were present in all episodes. ‘Any alcohol’ content occurred in
78%, ‘actual alcohol use’ in 30%, ‘inferred alcohol use’ in 72%, and all ‘other’ alcohol references
occurred in 59% of all coding intervals (ACIs), respectively. Brand appearances occurred in 23% of
ACIs. The most frequently observed alcohol brand was Smirnoff which appeared in 43% of all
brand appearances. Episodes categorized as suitable for viewing by adolescents below the legal
drinking age of 18 years comprised of 61% of all brand appearances.
Conclusions: Alcohol content, including branding, is highly prevalent in the UK Reality TV show
‘Geordie Shore’ Series 11. Two-thirds of all alcohol branding occurred in episodes age-rated by
the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) as suitable for viewers aged 15 years. The organiza-
tions OfCom, Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and the Portman Group should implement
more effective policies to reduce adolescent exposure to on-screen drinking. The drinks industry
should consider demanding the withdrawal of their brands from the show.
Short Summary: Alcohol content, including branding, is highly prevalent in the MTV reality TV
show ‘Geordie Shore’ Series 11. Current alcohol regulation is failing to protect young viewers
from exposure to such content.
INTRODUCTION
It is well-established that alcohol content occurs commonly in con-
temporary media such as film (Hanewinkel et al., 2007; Dal Cin
et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2011), TV (Blair et al., 2005; Lyons et al.,
2013), music videos (DuRant et al., 1997; Cranwell et al., 2015,
2016a) and computer games (Cranwell et al., 2016b). Further, there
is an established link between exposure to alcohol content in media,
including paid for advertising, and the uptake of drinking in adoles-
cents (Hanewinkel et al., 2007, 2012, 2014; Ross et al., 2014;
Cranwell et al., 2016b). Alcohol advertising on television shows
predicts an increased likelihood of binge and hazardous drinking in
young people aged 15–20 years (Tanski et al., 2015), while a system-
atic review of prospective cohort studies found baseline non-drinkers
were significantly more likely to start drinking after being exposed to
alcohol advertisements (Smith and Foxcroft, 2009).
In the United Kingdom (UK) the Advertising Standards Authority
(ASA) regulate advertising in Broadcast media such as television (TV).
The ASA proactively check the media for breaches of their alcohol
advertising Codes. As stated in the ASA Code 19: ‘Advertisements for
alcoholic drinks should not be targeted at people under 18 years of age

 and should not imply, condone or encourage immoderate, irrespon-
sible or anti-social drinking.’ (ASA, 2015). The Portman Group, an
organization representing the UK’s leading alcohol producers, also
advocates regulating the promotion of alcohol and responsible market-
ing of alcohol products in the UK, for example, by not associating
alcoholic drinks with drunkenness or binge drinking or branded alco-
holic drinks having appeal to those under the UK legal drinking age of
18 years (Portman Group, 2015). Ofcom, the communications regula-
tor in the UK, works under the provisions of the Communications Act
2003 and the Broadcasting Act 1996 to manage standards in pro-
grammes, sponsorship, product placement, fairness and privacy
(Ofcom, 2016a) to ensure that television programme consumers are
protected from harmful or offensive material (including both content
and product placement) (Ofcom, 2016b).
Reality television chronicles un-scripted situations involving peo-
ple in their daily lives or fabricated scenarios. Programmes often fea-
ture otherwise unknown casts and tend to focus on drama and
personal conflict. ‘Geordie Shore’ (GS) is a UK primetime ‘hyper-
reality’ TV series (similar to Made in Chelsea (MIC) and The Only
Way is Essex (TOWIE)). It is based on the popular American reality
show Jersey Shore (BBC, 2011). ‘Geordie’ is the regional dialect of
people from the city Newcastle Upon Tyne in the UK, where the pro-
gramme is primarily filmed. It chronicles the casts’ lives while living
together in the GS house, typically dramatizing events and relation-
ships (Wood, 2017). It is broadcast by the general entertainment
channel media channel MTV in the UK and Ireland (MTV, 2017). In
2015, MTV UK reached an average 8.4 million UK viewers in the
time period GS (Series 11) was originally aired (BARB (Broadcaster’s
Audience Research Board), 2016).
MTV has been voted one of the Top 100 Best Global Brands for
the last nine years (Syncforce, 2016) and was rated the number six
top media brand by young people in the UK in 2014 (Statista, 2016).
The channel focuses on younger generations, with a core audience of
12–34 year olds (Chozick, 2013). This audience reach of MTV
affords significant marketing opportunities to companies seeking to
promote their products to a young audience, but aside from a 2005
analysis of alcohol content in a Reality TV programme ‘The
Osbourne’s’, which recorded an average of 9.1 depictions of alcohol
per episode (Blair et al., 2005), little is known about alcohol content
in more contemporary programmes. In order to expand and add to
the limited existing research on alcohol promotion in contemporary
media this study has quantified the occurrence of alcohol content,
including alcohol branding, in the popular primetime UK Reality TV
show ‘Geordie Shore’ Series 11 (GS11), broadcast in 2015.
METHODS
Procedure
We purchased GS11, which at the time of data collection was the
most recent series (broadcast between 20 October and 22 December
2015) on DVD. The series consists of 10 episodes, making it the
longest series to date. Each episode was watched and coded for the
presence or absence of alcohol content using established semi-
quantitative interval media coding methods (Lyons et al., 2011;
Cranwell et al., 2015) (see Online Supplementary Material for the
detailed coding protocol). The British Board of Film Classification
(BBFC), which age-classifies films, videos and DVDs, rated six of the
episodes as suitable for viewing by those aged 15 years or over, and
4 episodes suitable for those aged 18 years or over.
Audio–visual content of each episode using 1-min intervals was
coded in the following categories: actual use, implied use without
actual use, paraphernalia without actual or implied use, and brand
appearance (real or fictitious), and any alcohol content (any of the
above). The different types of alcohol and branding occurring in
each coding interval were also recorded.
For each 1-min interval where actual alcohol use was present,
four other categories were also coded:
(a) Social context: alone, with other alcohol users, in the presence
of a child or with other non-alcohol users.
(b) Drunkenness: drinking but not obviously drunk, or obviously
drunk.
(c) Age: apparently under the age of 18, or apparently over the age
of 18.
(d) Gender: male, female, mixed drinking scene or drinker unidenti-
fied/unknown (e.g. non-human/silhouette).
Authors EL carried out the coding and JC checked samples of
the coding at several points during data collection. Any discrepan-
cies were discussed and resolved. Repeated appearances in the same
category during any single 1-min interval were coded as a single
event, and appearances in different categories as separate events,
with the exception of brands, for which different brands were
counted as separate events. Where different categories of appearance
of alcohol occurred simultaneously (e.g. actual and implied use of
alcohol) the episode was coded under the higher of the categories as
ranked above. Any partial intervals at the end of a video were
counted as a full 1-min interval.
Data analysis
Data were recorded and descriptive statistics generated using
Microsoft Excel 2010. Data were analysed using Stata MP 13.1 for
Windows (StataCorp LP, Texas, US). Where required t-tests were
performed and P values < 0.05 were deemed statistically significant.
RESULTS
The series included a total run time of 425 min and 54 s (each episode
ranged from 42 min and 13 s to 42 min and 50 s). There were 430 1-
min coding intervals in total, comprising 43 intervals per episode. Using
the BBFC film rating categories episodes 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10 were age-
rated certificate 15 years and episodes 4, 5, 6 and 7 were age-rated cer-
tificate 18 years. Alcohol content in all four content subcategories was
present in at least one 1-min interval in each of the ten episodes.
Any alcohol content was present in 336 intervals (78% of all
intervals), and between 28 and 39 intervals per episode. Any alcohol
appeared on average every 1.3 intervals, ranging from every 1.1
intervals in episode 5 to every 1.5 intervals in episode 7. The num-
ber of intervals containing any alcohol content by coded category
and alcoholic branding can be seen in Fig. 1. None of the episodes
coded included any alcohol-related disclaimers or warnings shown
at the beginning of the episode.
Actual alcohol use
Actual alcohol use occurred in 128 (30%) intervals (Fig. 1) and
between 9 (in episode 9) and 17 intervals (in episode 5) per episode.
In 50% of episodes of actual alcohol use we were unable to identify
the type of drink consumed, but in 17% the drink was beer or cider

 (17%), spirits (9%), wine or champagne and cocktails (both 9%). In
6% of episodes more than one type of drink was consumed (Fig. 2).
No alcohol consumption occurred in the presence of a child.
Alcohol was consumed alone in 15% of episodes; with other, non-
alcohol users in 4%; and with other alcohol users in 81%. Alcohol
consumers were drinking and obviously drunk in 35% of intervals.
All alcohol drinkers appeared to be over the age of 18 years. Male
and female drinking in the same 1-min interval occurred in 45% of
intervals with alcohol consumption; either together in the same scene
or separately within the interval. Male-only drinking accounted for
27% and female-only drinking for 29% of actual use intervals.
Inferred alcohol use
Inferred alcohol use occurred in 309 intervals (72% of all intervals)
(Fig. 1), and ranged from 26 (episode 7) to 35 intervals (episode 4)
per episode. Drunken behaviour and a verbal reference to alcohol
occurred in 11 intervals (4% of inferred). These results are shown in
Fig. 3. Of the 309 intervals containing inferred alcohol use, 201
involved a person holding an alcoholic drink, 128 include a verbal
reference to alcohol and 211 include drunken behaviour.
‘Other’ alcohol reference
Other alcohol references occurred in 252 intervals (59% of total)
intervals (Fig. 1), and in between 19 (episode 7) and 30 intervals
(episode 4) per episode. Other alcohol references comprised bar or
club signs in 242 intervals, and usually occurred in conjunction with
other alcohol appearances present in the scene (Fig. 4).
Alcohol branding
In total, 35 alcohol brands appeared at least once within the series.
The number of different brands ranged from 3 (episode 6) to 23
(episode 7) per episode. The 23 brands present in episode 7
appeared a total of 25 times. The average number of brands per epi-
sode was 7.7. Of these brands, 10 were coded as beer/cider, one as
wine/champagne and 24 as spirits (Table 1). The brands coded as
spirits are divided into subcategories: vodka, rum, gin, whiskey,
tequila and fruit liqueurs.
The mean number of alcoholic brand appearances per episode
was 31, and ranged from 12 (episode 8) to 52 (episodes 3 and 5).
Brand appearances occurred a total of 311 times, in 98 1-min inter-
vals (23% of total). Of the 35 brands that appeared, Smirnoff was
observed the most frequently (133 appearances, 43% of all brand
appearances, Fig. 5). Five brands appeared three times each;
Gordons, Havana Club, Baileys, Jack Daniels and Amstel. Three
brands appeared twice each; Kahlua, Campari and Malibu. All
other 14 brands appeared only once across the series.
The episodes with the highest intensity of a specific brand
appearance are episodes 3 and 5, in which Smirnoff appeared 30
and 32 times, respectively. These appearances were in bar/club
scenes where a Smirnoff bottle was situated on a table, featured as a
wall decoration, or was held in someone’s hand. No brand was

 present in every episode, but Smirnoff appeared in all except episode
9 and Corona in all except episode 6. Alcohol branding was most
frequently seen in bar/club scenes, but branding also appeared in the
villa and boat used by the cast.
Brand appearances in relation to BBFC age rating
Episodes categorized as suitable for viewing by adolescents ≥15
years of age included 61% of all brand appearances. When compar-
ing BBFC ratings of episodes (15 or 18) there was no statistical sig-
nificance of the number of brand appearances present per episode
(P = 0.92, CI = −21.9 to 23.9, mean difference = 1). The mean num-
ber of brand appearances in episodes age-rated 15 years was 31.5 per
episode and in episodes age-rated 18 years was 30.5 per episode.
When comparing BBFC ratings of episodes (aged suitable for 15
or 18 years or over), there was no statistical significance in the num-
ber of different alcoholic brands present per episode (P = 0.19, 95%
CI: −13.3 to 3.1, mean difference = −5.1). The mean number of
brands present in episodes rated 15 years or over was 5.7 per epi-
sode and in episodes rated 18 years or over was 10.8 per episode.
See Table 2 for alcohol brands categorized by alcohol type.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study demonstrate that the occurrence of alco-
hol content (verbal and imagery) and alcohol brand appearances is
highly prevalent in ‘Geordie Shore: The Complete Eleventh Series’
(GS11). Any form of alcohol content (verbal or imagery) and actual
alcohol use occurred in 78 and 30% of all coding intervals (ACIs),
respectively. Alcoholic branding occurred in 23% of ACIs and, on
average, once every 1.4 min. Further, more than half of all coded
intervals contained inferred alcohol use and other reference to alco-
hol. The study also found that alcohol content and alcohol brand
appearances occurred in all episodes of the series deemed suitable
for viewing by young people below the age of 18 years. The legal
drinking age in the UK is 18 years. This is an important finding
because the drinks industry should be adhering to its own self-
regulatory codes of practice which aim to prevent exposure of their
products to an underage audience. However, the regulation of alco-
hol advertising in the UK has already been criticized for systematic-
ally failing by producers and agencies exploiting the ambiguities in
the codes (Hastings et al., 2010). Similarly, our previous research
found alcohol, including branding, to be the prevalent in contem-
porary music videos (which many UK adolescents are exposed to)
with violations of both ASA, Portman Group and the drinks indus-
try codes of conduct breached and drinking to excess was positively
promoted through behavioural and verbal messages (Cranwell et al.,
2016a, 2017). Our findings are consistent with these.
Our findings are also consistent with earlier studies reporting
high levels of alcohol content in television programmes (Russell and
Russell, 2009; Lyons et al., 2013), but is the first for over a decade
to investigate the increasingly popular reality TV format. The young
target audience, the wide reach of the MTV entertainment channel,
and the popularity of GS11, means it is inevitable that adolescent
viewers have been exposed to branded and unbranded alcohol
imagery and on-screen drinking to excess, with related drunk and
disorderly behaviour and sexual encounters. From a theoretical

 perspective adolescent exposure to this may influence and encourage
young people to emulate this behaviour (Bryant and Oliver, 2009).
The overwhelming prevalence of Smirnoff, Corona and Grey
Goose brand appearances, suggests an association with the brands
and MTVs GS11 series. The Smirnoff brand is known to have a
connection to MTV; in 2010 Smirnoff teamed up with MTV to
showcase ‘The Smirnoff Nightlife Exchange Project’ (MTV, 2010),
in 2012, pictureDRIFT worked with MTV to create a promotional
video for MTVs summer sponsorship with Smirnoff Ice (Drift,
2013) and at the 2016 MTV Europe Music Awards, Smirnoff was a
regional sponsor (BellaNaija, 2016). Smirnoff has multiple sponsor-
ship deals, including 26 music festivals annually and Formula One
racing (Interbrand, 2017) to help gain global audiences and engage
consumers. Smirnoff itself accounted for 43% of all brand appear-
ances in this study, comprising a significant amount of screen time.
Most alcoholic drink manufacturers adopt voluntary codes of prac-
tice regarding advertising of their products. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the
leading global brewer, produces and sells over 200 beer brands globally
(AB InBev, 2015). It owns two brands that appeared in this study;
Corona and Budweiser. They have a voluntary marketing code that
states ‘we are dedicated to promoting smart consumption and reducing
the harmful use of alcohol’ (AB InBev, 2016) The code does not apply
to television programmes that use their products without express per-
mission to do so, which may have occurred in GS11. Drinks distributer
Diageo is the global leader in alcohol beverages (Diageo, 2017). It owns
five alcohol brands recorded in the data: Smirnoff, Captain Morgan,
Baileys, Tanqueray and Cîroc. Diageo state that marketing will only be
placed ‘where 71.6% or more of the audience are expected to be older
than the legal purchasing age’ (Diageo, 2016). Clearly this is not guar-
anteed in GS11. Heineken UK and Bacardi Limited, the owners of Grey
Goose, make similar claims in their corporate responsibility policies
(Grey Goose, 2015; Heineken, 2015).
AB InBev, Carlsberg UK, Heineken UK and Diageo Great
Britain all have products appearing in GS11 but are all signatories
of the Portman Group. It is unclear whether the drinks manufac-
turers have paid for brand advertising in GS11, in which case sev-
eral codes of practice have been clearly violated, or if this is a form
of de facto advertising where brands are unofficially advertised with-
out the alcohol producer’s knowledge, in which case it is surprising
that the companies have not objected and demanded withdrawal of
their products.
In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that compared
to other media as previously mention (e.g. music videos (45%),
video games (44%) and television (40%)), there is a very high level
of alcohol content and brand-specific alcohol imagery in the reality
TV show Geordie Shore (78%), Series 11. Therefore, enforcing new
policy measures to help protect adolescents from alcohol imagery in
the media is essential. Given that 60% of GS11 episodes were
awarded by the BBFC and age rating of 15 years, it appears that the
existing age classification policy is not protecting young people from
alcohol imagery and its potentially harmful effects. The BBFC
should award reality television programmes, which include excessive

 alcohol content and which promote excessive drinking and/or brand
placement, an age rating of 18+ years. The alcohol industry clearly
needs to do more and should demand removal of their brands in
shows that promote irresponsible drinking, if it is not paid for prod-
uct placement. If paid for then this is a clear indication that the
ASA, Portman Group, and industry codes of practice/advertising are
clearly not protecting young people in the UK from exposure to on-
screen irresponsible drinking. Moreover, they are not helping to pre-
vent alcohol misuse and certainly not working towards fostering a
balanced understanding of alcohol-related issues.
