Clinical Relevancy Statement
Although a large percentage of patients are at nutrition risk upon 
hospital admission, their nutrition needs are not always addressed 
in the hospital setting. The clinical implications of our findings are 
(1) demonstrating that validated malnutrition risk screening and 
immediate oral nutrition supplement use can improve outcomes in 
at-risk hospitalized patients (lowered readmission rates and 
shorter length of stay) and (2) highlighting how a real-world prag-
matic quality improvement program can provide a scalable model 
for evidence-based improvements in nutrition care.
Introduction
Although hospital malnutrition has been a chief cause of con-
cern for more than 40 years, malnutrition continues to go unrec-
ognized and undertreated in hospitals in the United States and 
globally.1–3 Findings over the past decade show that 30%–50% 
of patients are malnourished on admission to the hospital.4,5 
Many patients experience deteriorating nutrition status during 
their hospital stay, including those who were adequately 
 
nourished on admission,6 as well as those who entered the hos-
pital malnourished.7 Poor nutrition status is associated with 
poor functional and clinical outcomes for patients and with 
increased costs to healthcare systems.8,9 To improve health

Abstract
Background: Although screening patients for malnutrition risk on hospital admission is standard of care, nutrition shortfalls are 
undertreated. Nutrition interventions can improve outcomes. We tested effects of a nutrition-focused quality improvement program (QIP) 
on hospital readmission and length of stay (LOS). Materials and Methods: QIP included malnutrition risk screening at admission, prompt 
initiation of oral nutrition supplements (ONS) for at-risk patients, and nutrition support. A 2-group, pre-post design of malnourished adults 
with any diagnosis was conducted at 4 hospitals: QIP-basic (QIPb) and QIP-enhanced (QIPe). Comparator patients had a malnutrition 
diagnosis and ONS orders. For QIPb, nurses screened all patients on admission using an electronic medical record (EMR)–cued 
Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST); ONS was provided to patients with MST scores ≥2 within 24–48 hours. QIPe had ONS within 24 
hours, postdischarge nutrition instructions, telephone calls, and ONS coupons. Primary outcome was 30-day unplanned readmission. 
We used baseline (January 1–December 31, 2013) and validation cohorts (October 13, 2013–April 2, 2014) for comparison. Results: 
Patients (n = 1269) were enrolled in QIPb (n = 769) and QIPe (n = 500). Analysis included baseline (n = 4611) and validation (n = 1319) 
comparator patients. Compared with a 20% baseline readmission rate, post-QIP relative reductions were 19.5% for all QIP, 18% for 
QIPb, and 22% for QIPe, respectively. Compared with a 22.1% validation readmission rate, relative reductions were 27.1%, 25.8%, and 
29.4%, respectively. Similar reductions were noted for LOS. Conclusions: Thirty-day readmissions and LOS were significantly lowered 
for malnourished inpatients by use of an EMR-cued MST, prompt provision of ONS, patient/caregiver education, and sustained nutrition 
support. (JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2017;41:384-391)

outcomes and reduce cost burdens to healthcare systems, it is 
important to take a systematic and comprehensive approach to 
increasing awareness of malnutrition and improving manage-
ment of nutrition in hospitals and beyond.
Expert recommendations for effective nutrition care strat-
egies are to (1) build an institutional culture where all stake-
holders value nutrition; (2) have clear definitions of clinicians’ 
roles for delivering nutrition care; (3) use routine screening 
of all patients for malnutrition risk; (4) start nutrition inter-
ventions promptly when risk is identified; (5) develop and 
apply individualized, in-hospital nutrition care plans; (6) con-
tinue to monitor each patient’s nutrition status; and (7) create 
postdischarge nutrition education and care plans.7
Furthermore, hospitals are now penalized financially for 
excessive readmission rates in accord with the Readmission 
Reduction Program of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS).10 Malnutrition is often treated by giving oral 
nutrition supplements (ONS). ONS provide calories, protein, 
and micronutrients that help stem weight loss and enhance 
recovery of lost lean body mass.11–13 Although ONS use has 
been shown to reduce readmission rates and cut healthcare 
costs,9 nutrition intervention is often overlooked as a potential 
readmission reduction strategy.
In Advocate Health Care (AHC) hospitals, we tested a real-
world nutrition care program that could be scaled up for broad 
use by other healthcare systems.14 We developed a nutrition-
focused quality improvement program (QIP) that included (1) 
malnutrition risk screening conducted by nursing staff at 
admission by way of an electronic medical record (EMR)–cued 
Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST; see Supplementary Figure 
S1 for full tool),15 (2) follow-up consultation by a dietitian, (3) 
prompt provision of ONS, and (4) patient and caregiver nutri-
tion education on in-hospital and postdischarge nutrition care.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This multisite, 2-group, pre-post QIP was approved by the AHC 
institutional review board (IRB). Two hospitals implemented the 
QIP-basic program (QIPb), while 2 hospitals implemented a 
QIP-enhanced program (QIPe). Study participants were enrolled 
between October 13, 2014, and April 2, 2015.
Participants
Eligible participants were hospitalized patients with any diagno-
sis, 18 years of age or older, at risk for malnutrition (MST score 
≥2) at admission, and able to consume foods and beverages 
orally. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, intubation, tube 
feeding or parenteral nutrition (PN), advanced cancer with brain 
metastases, neurological or psychiatric disorders, and other con-
ditions that could interfere with ONS consumption. All patients 
provided consent through an IRB-approved process.
Setting
As a 12-hospital system, AHC is the largest provider in Illinois. 
Four hospitals were selected for the study. Hospitals were 
grouped and categorized as QIPb and QIPe; each group 
included 1 teaching and 1 community hospital. Selection of 
QIPb and QIPe hospitals was based on similar demographic 
and clinical characteristics of patients and hospitals, including 
annual admissions, average patient age, length of stay (LOS), 
race, and historic all-cause 30-day readmission rates.
Interventions
The MST was selected to screen for malnutrition risk because 
it is a validated, easy-to-use tool with favorable psychometric 
properties.15–17 MST incorporates criteria of the Participative 
Global Assessment, recently shown to be the single best pre-
dictor of LOS and readmission rates.18 An AHC system-wide 
EMR upgrade integrated the MST for nutrition screening. 
Bedside and informatics nurses helped develop the EMR for-
mat of the MST. MST replaced an internally developed, non-
validated nutrition assessment tool used previously. The EMR 
upgrade was also designed to trigger appropriate follow-up 
dietitian consultations and selection of standard or disease-
specific ONS for all at-risk patients.
Clinical staff (including nurses, dietitians, and physicians) 
at the QIP hospitals received education and training. An edu-
cational video (with a pre-post learning test) was developed 
to inform nurses about use of the EMR-cued MST, ONS for 
nutrition care in at-risk patients, and nutrition care documenta-
tion. Implementation of the QIP included a 2-week run-in 
period for troubleshooting start-up issues; no patient data col-
lected during this period were included in the analysis. To sup-
port engagement and compliance, staff nutrition education 
activities (emails, brochures, meetings, flyers) were used dur-
ing the QIP interval. Dietitians rechecked MST scores for 
patients identified on admission to have malnutrition risk; 
excessive false-positive MST scores were considered a flag for 
additional nurse training on screening. Only patients with a 
dietitian-confirmed MST ≥2 were eligible for study inclusion.
QIPb vs QIPe Procedures
QIPb and QIPe procedures are compared in Table 1. All 
patients at QIP hospitals were screened with the EMR-cued 
MST by the admitting nurse. QIPb patients with MST scores 
≥2 were seen by a dietitian within 24 and 48 hours of the initial 
malnutrition risk screening. For those with dietitian-confirmed 
scores ≥2, the QIP program was introduced, and consent to 
participate was documented in the EMR. ONS was ordered 
manually by the dietitian, and first delivery occurred up to 48 
hours postscreening. The treatment protocol provided 2 bottles 
of ONS daily, delivered with meals. Dietitians educated 
patients on the importance of ONS consumption. At the time of 
 386 
Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 41(3)
discharge, QIPb patients were provided discharge instructions 
as clinically indicated at the discretion of the dietitian.
Patients at QIPe hospitals with MST ≥2 got nurse-ordered 
ONS that started within 24 hours of malnutrition risk screen-
ing. The EMR-cued ONS formula type according to the 
patient’s overall dietary orders (ie, standard, diabetes-specific, 
or renal-specific ONS) and a dietitian consultation was elic-
ited. The dietitian rescreened the patients and introduced 
patients with confirmed MST ≥2 to the QIP, requested partici-
pation, and documented consent. Participating patients were 
educated on the importance of ONS compliance. At the time of 
discharge, QIPe patients were provided with instructions for 
postdischarge ONS use, nutrition literature, and discount cou-
pons for ONS. A month’s worth of high-value, $2.50–$3.00 
multipack discount coupons (depending on the ONS product 
used) were distributed outside of the research setting to delib-
erately replicate current practice. Four telephone calls were 
made 48–72 hours postdischarge to confirm ONS use and at 
weeks 2, 3, and 4 postdischarge. The first phone call was done 
primarily by a transition call center nurse, and remaining calls 
were completed using an automated phone system. A personal 
follow-up call from the clinical team was optional.
Outcome Measures
QIP group readmissions. The primary outcome measure was 
unplanned 30-day readmission (all-cause) to any AHC system 
hospital. The final follow-up contact was on May 2, 2015.
Readmission rates for baseline and validation cohorts. Adminis-
trative records of a retrospective cohort admitted at AHC hospi-
tals using a similar EMR during 2013 were used to estimate the 
baseline readmission rate for patients with malnutrition-related 
diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion codes 263.0–263.9) and ONS orders—the baseline cohort. 
This cohort was derived prior to QIP implementation and used to 
set study parameters. A total of 4611 patients were found to be 
eligible, and these patients had an aggregated readmission rate of 
21.2%. Since the MST was not available pre-QIP implementa-
tion, the investigators established the pre-QIP readmission rate at 
20%, which was confirmed comparable to a prior report.19 We 
aimed to detect a 20% relative reduction in the readmission rate, 
which was consistent with the CMS goal.10
To validate this readmission estimate and identify possible 
confounding issues, data were extracted post hoc for a second 
QIP comparator cohort—patients who were admitted to the 4 
hospitals a year prior to QIP (October 13, 2013–April 2, 2014) 
but otherwise met QIP inclusion criteria (validation cohort, n 
= 1319). This cohort was derived after QIP initiation and 
matched hospitals and timeframes. Their 30-day readmission 
rate was 22.1%, thereby affirming the conservative use of 
20% as the baseline readmission rate estimate. For compari-
sons, pre-post QIP readmission differences were referenced to 
the baseline cohort and the validation cohort rates—20% and 
22.1%, respectively.
LOS for baseline and validation cohorts. The secondary out-
come was hospital LOS, calculated by subtracting admission 
day from discharge day. Average LOS for the baseline cohort 
was 6.3 ± 6 days; investigators conservatively set the pre-QIP 
LOS at 6 ± 6 days. The average LOS for the validation cohort 
was 7.2 ± 8 days. Pre-post QIP LOS differences are therefore 
calculated by referencing the LOS of 6 and 7.2 days, respec-
tively, for baseline and validation cohorts.
Sample Size
Initial sample size was calculated to detect a 20% reduction, or 
absolute decrease of 4% from the baseline readmission rate of 
20%, for 30-day readmissions. With 95% confidence interval 
and power of 80%, the sample size was calculated via PASS 11 
(NCCS, LLC, Kaysville, UT) and determined to be 3000 (1500 
patients in each group) for a 2-tailed χ2 test. A preplanned interim 
power analysis was performed on the data from 6 months post-
QIP initiation using both the baseline and validation cohort read-
mission rates. At interim analysis, 1269 patients were enrolled 
(769 QIPb and 500 QIPe patients). When using the 20% baseline 
readmission rate to compare the results of the 2 groups indepen-
dently, power levels of 40% for QIPb and 50% for QIPe groups 
were estimated. However, a power of 80% was detected for both 
groups when using the 22.1% validation cohort readmission 
rate. Therefore, the study was stopped, and data were analyzed.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics are reported for all continuous and cate-
gorical variables. Pre-post group differences for readmission 
rates and LOS were performed using the χ2 and Student t test, 
respectively. Similar tests were performed to compare other 
continuous and categorical variables, and z tests were per-
formed for aggregate baseline readmission and LOS results. 
Spearman correlation was performed to assess the relationships 
between educational/reinforcing activities and MST errors, as 
well as MST errors and readmission rates over time for QIP 
patients. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, an 
IBM Company, Chicago, IL) and a z test calculator. A 2-tailed P 
level of .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographics
Of the 2808 MST-screened patients, nearly half were at risk of 
malnutrition and included in the analysis (n = 1269, 45.2%; 
Figure 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics of pre-QIP 
patients derived from the validation cohort and QIP partici-
pants are presented in Table 2. Patients were mostly white 
(70.4%), older adults with a mean age of 66.6 ± 17.2 years and 
admitted for a primary medical diagnosis (77.3%).
Readmission Rates
Compared with the baseline cohort, the absolute reduction of 
30-day readmission rate post-QIP in all QIP hospitals was 3.9% 
(20%–16.1%), which corresponds to a significant relative risk 
reduction (RRR) of 19.5% (P = .001). The readmission rate was 
16.4% in the QIPb hospitals and 15.6% in the QIPe hospitals, 
showing absolute reductions of 3.6% (18% RRR, P = .01) and 
4.4% (22% RRR, P = .01), respectively. Compared with the 
validation cohort readmission rate of 22.1%, RRRs were 27.1%, 
25.8%, and 29.4% for all QIP, QIPb, and QIPe hospitals, respec-
tively (P < .01; Table 3).
LOS
The post-QIP average LOS was 5.4 ± 4.7 days for all QIP hos-
pitals, 5.4 ± 4.8 days for the QIPb hospitals, and 5.3 ± 4.5 days 
for the QIPe hospitals. Using the baseline cohort LOS of 6.0 ± 
6 days, an overall 10.0% RRR was reported for all QIP hospi-
tals and the QIPb hospitals and 11.7% RRR for the QIPe hos-
pitals (P < .05). When using the validation cohort LOS of 7.2 ± 
8 days, there was an absolute reduction of 1.8 ± 3.4 days (ie, a 
25% RRR) (P < .001) for all QIP hospitals and for the QIPb 
hospitals (1.8 ± 3.3 days). A total LOS of 5.3 ± 4.5 days was 
reported in the QIPe hospitals, showing an absolute reduction 
of 1.9 ± 3.6 days (26% RRR, P < .01; Table 3).
QIP Program Findings
Information regarding postdischarge consumption of ONS was 
collected for a subset of QIPe patients (n = 206). In total, 141 
(68%) patients confirmed consuming their recommended 
ONS, while the average amount of ONS that patients reported 
drinking was 1.03 bottles per day.
The relationship between educational activities and MST 
errors (accounting for false positives) throughout the course 
of QIP deployment is displayed in Figure 2. A negative cor-
relation (ρ = −.943, P = .005; Figure 2) was observed, thus 
supporting the importance of education on reducing the rate of 
MST errors. Figure 3 outlines the relationship between MST 
errors and readmission rates throughout the same timeframe. 
Results suggested a positive but nonsignificant correlation of 
MST errors and readmission rates over time (ρ = .026, P > .05; 
Figure 3).
Discussion
The clinical implications of our findings were 2-fold: (1) we 
demonstrated that malnutrition risk screening and ONS use can 
improve outcomes in at-risk hospitalized patients (lowered 
readmission rates and shorter LOS), and (2) we highlighted 
how a real-world QIP study can provide a scalable model for 
evidence-based improvements in nutrition care.
Lowered Readmission Rates
The significant relative reductions in readmission rates we 
observed post-QIP are consistent with results of other studies 
assessing the impact of malnutrition screening and ONS

supplementation on 30-day unplanned readmissions.9,20–22 In 
addition, Bally et al11 confirmed that while nutrition interven-
tions have little effect on many clinical outcomes (eg, func-
tional outcomes, hospital-acquired infections), reduction of 
unplanned readmissions is consistently observed. Our find-
ings therefore suggest that improved nutrition status can 
reduce illness recurrence in malnourished patients after hospi-
tal discharge.
Initiatives aimed at decreasing readmission rates do not 
typically emphasize the importance of early malnutrition risk 
screening for all hospitalized patients using an EMR-cued 
validated tool, followed by appropriate nutrition interventions 
coordinated by a trained dietitian.23,24 This failure to recognize 
malnutrition as a contributing factor to adverse outcomes is 
also evidenced by the lack of acknowledgment of multidisci-
plinary team approaches in ensuring appropriate nutrition

intervention for malnourished patients.25 Even regulatory bod-
ies such as CMS do not clearly identify malnutrition as a 
major contributing cause for readmission.10 Our findings sup-
port the need for similar nutrition interventions in acute 
settings.
Reduced LOS
The significant reductions in LOS observed in our patient pop-
ulation are supported by previous studies suggesting that ONS 
consumption by malnourished patients can also reduce 
LOS.9,26–28 However, our findings are inconsistent with those 
reported by other researchers, including Gariballa et al29 and 
Bally et al,11 who concluded that nutrition supplementation and 
support (including counseling and oral and enteral feeding) 
have little and nonsignificant effects on LOS. It is important to 
note that in the previous studies, interventions were specific to 
feeding and nutrition counseling, while in our QIP, we intro-
duced multiple innovative interventions that enabled us to 
observe improvements in LOS. While malnutrition is known to 
prolong LOS among inpatients,28,30,31 our results suggest that 
with optimal nutrition-related interventions, LOS can be short-
ened significantly.
Study Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, this observational, real-
world QIP inherits the limitations of nonrandomized, con-
trolled study designs. The QIP does not allow assessment of 
causality and has risk of bias. Although we took several steps 
to produce comparable groups, population differences in 
demographic and clinical characteristics were observed. Also, 
given the lack of MST before QIP deployment, our historic 
comparison groups were defined differently than the QIP group 
with regard to nutrition status and discharge disposition. 
Second, it is possible that we did not fully capture readmission 
data as we could not account for readmissions outside our sys-
tem hospitals. However, in hospitals with a fully implemented 
EMR, as in our QIP hospitals, the adjusted odds ratio of under-
estimation of 30-day readmission rate is only 0.97.32
Third, similar to other hospitals aiming to meet U.S. govern-
ment requirements and avoid financial penalties, other efforts to 
decrease readmission rates and LOS may have been launched 
during the QIP period, potentially affecting the observed 
improvements. However, no efforts were focused on patients at 
risk for malnutrition. Also, the readmission rate and LOS of non-
QIP patients admitted at the QIP hospitals during the life of the 
study remained generally constant (Supplementary Figure S2).
Fourth, we had limited data on ONS consumption and com-
pliance after discharge. Although measuring consumption was 
beyond the scope of this current project, it is important to note 
that capturing reliable electronic data on ONS consumption is 
difficult or even impossible in a real-world QIP, especially 
because the ONS products are generally not issued from phar-
macy services (which require strict processes of documenta-
tion). However, as noted by Philipson et al,9 even an order 
placed for ONS was associated with positive outcomes. Thus, 
by improving the ONS ordering process, we believe that simi-
lar outcomes will be achieved. ONS compliance in hospital-
ized patients has been estimated at 67%,33 and the data 
generated from the subset of QIPe patients suggest this is a 
reasonable estimate for our patient population, too. Despite 
uncertain ONS compliance, we did observe clinical benefits.
Although we do not report actual costs or cost-savings asso-
ciated with the 2 QIP approaches, our results are likely to be 
reflected in cost savings as a result of reduced readmission 
rates and shorter lengths of stay. Finally, program sustainabil-
ity was variable throughout the QIP period. These challenges 
were reflected in the number of MST errors (false positives) 
occurring throughout the QIP period and the significant differ-
ences in readmission rates during QIP deployment. We believe 
that MST errors and readmission rate increased during the 
second quarter of QIP and were mostly due to staff turnover, 
leadership changes, and other operational challenges. This

underscores the importance of having administrative support 
to help create a culture of accountability and to make malnutri-
tion risk screening a system-wide key performance metric.
While the limitations and challenges of our study are worth 
considering, this was a real-world QIP study implemented in an 
integrated hospital system, which included both community and 
teaching hospitals. It is, to our knowledge, the first QIP of its 
kind to look at nutrition interventions as a mechanism to reduce 
readmissions and LOS. Our program was innovative in that it 
used a validated EMR-cued MST screening, enabled EMR-
based ONS selection and ordering, included nutrition education 
and follow-up telephone calls during the 30-day postdischarge 
period for all QIPe patients (regardless of their discharge dispo-
sition), and, most important, addressed all 7 principles recom-
mended to address adult hospital malnutrition.7 We believe that 
the positive benefits associated with our nutrition-focused QIP 
resulted from the comprehensive, multistep strategy we fol-
lowed, rather than from any single intervention introduced. 
Logically, adequate nutrition care depends on identifying 
patients at risk, addressing their nutrition shortfalls, and ensuring 
that both patients and their caregivers are educated about the 
importance of continuing to be attentive to nutrition needs.
Conclusions
The results of our study highlight the importance of nutrition as a 
way to hasten patient recovery, as evidenced by shorter lengths of 
stay in the hospital. Attention to nutrition also helped prevent 
hospital readmissions, thus indicating that nutrition can help hos-
pitals reach the CMS goal of reducing readmissions by 20%.10 
Nearly half of our patients admitted to hospital were at risk for 
malnutrition, and use of nutrition-focused QIP interventions low-
ered readmission rates by about 20%. Our results show that nutri-
tion care can improve patient health outcomes, and it can also 
improve health system quality indicators. Together, such results 
provide a rationale for expanding our nutrition-focused QIP to all 
our hospitals, as well as to other hospital systems.
