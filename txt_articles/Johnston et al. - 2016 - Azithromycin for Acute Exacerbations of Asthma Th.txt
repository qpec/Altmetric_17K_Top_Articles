IMPORTANCE Guidelines recommend against antibiotic use to treat asthma attacks. A study
with telithromycin reported benefit, but adverse reactions limit its use.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether azithromycin added to standard care for asthma attacks in
adults results in clinical benefit.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Azithromycin Against Placebo in Exacerbations of
Asthma (AZALEA) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a United
Kingdom–based multicenter study in adults requesting emergency care for acute asthma
exacerbations, ran from September 2011 to April 2014. Adults with a history of asthma for
more than 6 months were recruited within 48 hours of presentation to medical care with an
acute deterioration in asthma control requiring a course of oral and/or systemic
corticosteroids.
INTERVENTIONS Azithromycin 500 mg daily or matched placebo for 3 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was diary card symptom score 10
days after randomization, with a hypothesized treatment effect size of −0.3. Secondary
outcomes were diary card symptom score, quality-of-life questionnaires, and lung function
changes, all between exacerbation and day 10, and time to a 50% reduction in symptom
score.
RESULTS Of 4582 patients screened at 31 centers, 199 of a planned 380 were randomized
within 48 hours of presentation. The major reason for nonrecruitment was receipt of
antibiotics (2044 [44.6%] screened patients). Median time from presentation to drug
administration was 22 hours (interquartile range, 14-28 hours). Exacerbation characteristics
were well balanced across treatment arms and centers. The primary outcome asthma
symptom scores were mean (SD), 4.14 (1.38) at exacerbation and 2.09 (1.71) at 10 days for the
azithromycin group and 4.18 (1.48) and 2.20 (1.51) for the placebo group, respectively. Using
multilevel modeling, there was no significant difference in symptom scores between
azithromycin and placebo at day 10 (difference, −0.166; 95% CI, −0.670 to 0.337), nor on any
day between exacerbation and day 10. No significant between-group differences were
observed in quality-of-life questionnaires or lung function between exacerbation and day 10,
or in time to 50% reduction in symptom score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized population, azithromycin treatment
resulted in no statistically or clinically significant benefit. For each patient randomized, more
than 10 were excluded because they had already received antibiotics.

A
sthmamorbidity,mortality,andmajorhealthcarecosts
result from acute attacks (exacerbations).1 The major-
ity of patients with asthma report an exacerbation in
the past year, with more than one-third of children and more
than one-fourth of adults requiring consequent urgent medi-
cal care.2
Respiratory viral infections are a frequent cause of asthma
exacerbations in children3,4 and adults.5-7 Atypical bacterial
(Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) in-
fection and/or reactivation is also associated, with serologic
positivity rates of 40% to 60% in some studies,8-12 indicating
that viral and atypical bacterial infections may interact in in-
creasing asthma exacerbation risk.
People with asthma have increased susceptibility to strep-
tococcal infections,13-15 increased carriage of bacterial patho-
gens identified by culture16 and molecular techniques,17 and
impaired interferon and type 1 T helper cell responses to bac-
terial polysaccharides.18,19 Viral infection impairs antibacte-
rial innate immune responses20 and increases bacterial ad-
herence to bronchial epithelium.21 Thus, bacterial infections
are more common and more severe in patients with asthma,
viruses increase susceptibility to bacterial infection, and acute
wheezing episodes in children younger than 3 years were as-
sociated with both bacterial and viral infection.22
Patients with asthma exacerbations treated with telithro-
mycin had greater reductions in asthma symptoms, improve-
ment in lung function, and faster recovery compared with
placebo.12 However, toxic effects to the liver limit telithromy-
cintreatmenttolife-threateninginfections,andguidelinesrec-
ommend that antibiotics should not be administered rou-
tinely in patients with asthma exacerbations.23,24
The Azithromycin Against Placebo in Exacerbations of
Asthma (AZALEA) study investigated the effectiveness of
azithromycin treatment when added to standard care for adult
patients with asthma exacerbations, closely following the
telithromycin study design, with the aim of providing confir-
mation or otherwise of those results.
Macrolide antibiotics might benefit asthma exacerba-
tions through antimicrobial activity and/or anti-inflamma-
toryproperties25;andazithromycin,butnottelithromycin,has
been shown to have antiviral properties,26 augmenting pro-
duction of interferons that are deficient in patients with
asthma.19,27AmechanisticandexploratoryaimofAZALEAwas
to determine whether treatment benefited patients with these
infections.
Methods
Study Design
This United Kingdom–based multicenter, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled study randomized eligible patients to azithro-
mycin 500 mg daily or placebo for 3 days on day 1 (visit 1), with
posttherapyassessmentsatvisitsondays5(visit2)and10(visit
3) and for serum sampling at 6 weeks (visit 4) (see trial proto-
col in Supplement 2).
Themaininclusioncriteriawerethatparticipantsbeadults
aged 18 to 55 years with any smoking history, aged 56 to 65
years with a less than 20 pack-year smoking history, or older
than 65 years with a less than 5 pack-year smoking history,
with a documented history of asthma for more than 6
months, and recruitment within 48 hours of presentation to
medical care with an acute deterioration in asthma control
(increased wheeze, dyspnea, and/or cough) necessitating a
course of oral and/or systemic corticosteroids (based on
clinical judgement by attending physicians) and a peak
expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 sec-
ond (FEV1) less than 80% predicted or patient’
s best at pre-
sentation, at recruitment, or in the time elapsed between
presentation and recruitment.
The main exclusion criteria were use of oral and/or sys-
temic antibiotics within 28 days of enrollment, need for in-
tensive care, substantial lung disease other than asthma, long-
term use of more than 20 mg oral corticosteroid daily, known
QT-interval prolongation, history of bradyarrhythmias and/or
tachyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure, and pa-
tients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
The primary outcome was diary card summary symptom
score,withsymptomsincludingwheezing,breathlessness,and
coughing assessed at 10 days after randomization (as in the
telithromycinstudy).12Secondaryoutcomesincludedtheacute
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), the mini AQLQ,
FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, forced mid-
expiratory flow (FEF25%-75%), forced expiratory flow at 50%
expiration (FEF50%), PEF, and time to 50% reduction in symp-
tom score. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed
over the time course of the exacerbation to 10 days, and sub-
group analyses were planned in relation to initial standard
and/or atypical bacteriologic and virologic status.
Spontaneous or induced sputum samples were obtained
where possible at exacerbation and sent for quantitative bac-
teria culture. A nasal mucus sample and nasal and throat swab
samples were obtained where possible at exacerbation, and
these and spontaneous or induced sputum samples were ana-
lyzedbymeansofviralandatypicalbacterialpolymerasechain
reactions (PCRs) and acute and convalescent serum samples
were sent for atypical bacterial serologic analysis.
The trial received approval from the National Research
Ethics Committee, Bloomsbury, London, England, and all pa-
tients gave written informed consent. Additional methods are
available in the eMethods in Supplement 1.
Key Points
Question Does addition of azithromycin to standard care improve
outcomes in adults requesting acute medical care for asthma
attacks?
Findings This randomized clinical trial found no statistically or
clinically significant benefit in symptoms, lung function, or speed
of recovery. For every 1 patient randomized, more than 10 had to
be excluded because they had already received antibiotics.
Meaning Widespread use of antibiotics despite guideline
recommendations limited interpretation of the results of this
study.

Statistical Analyses
The sample size calculations hypothesized a treatment mean
(SD) effect size of −0.3 (0.783) based on the primary outcome
of the telithromycin study12 and used a significance level of
1% with 80% power, assuming a dropout rate of 15%.12 We pro-
posedtorecruit190patientstoeacharm.Torunthetrialwithin
theprojectfunding1-yeartimeline,weplanned10centers,each
recruiting roughly 38 patients.
All patients who returned at least 1 diary card and re-
ceivedstudydrugwereincludedintheintention-to-treatanaly-
ses. Because the timing of greatest magnitude of any treat-
ment effect was not known, multilevel modeling was used to
calculate the estimated differences in primary and secondary
outcomes between treatment groups for each day from ran-
domization to day 10. A Cox model was used to calculate the
hazard ratio for time to 50% reduction in symptom score. De-
tailsofthestatisticalmodel,modelselectionprocess,andtreat-
ment of missing data are in the eMethods in Supplement 1. All
analyses were performed using Stata 13. A statistical analysis
plan was prepared by the trial statistician prior to unblinding.
Results
Recruitment Details and Clinical Characteristics
Recruitment from 31 sites (30 secondary care hospitals, 1 pri-
mary care center) lasted 2.5 years, from October 12, 2011, to
April 30, 2014. The recruitment period was longer than
planned because of recruitment difficulties arising from the
large numbers of patients excluded. A total of 4582 patients
were screened, of whom 390 patients met eligibility criteria.
A total of 199 were randomized, 97 to active treatment and
102 to placebo (Figure 1). The major reason for nonrecruit-
ment was already receiving antibiotics (2044 [44.6%]
screened patients).
Clinical characteristics of randomized patients are sum-
marized in Table 1. Study participants’mean (SD) age was 39.9
(14.82) years (median [interquartile range] age, 38.4 [26.7-
49.5] years), with 69.8% female. Underlying asthma severity,
smoking status, exacerbation severity, and median time from
presentation to trial drug administration are presented in
Table 1. Pulmonary function at baseline (exacerbation, visit 1)
is presented in Table 2 and includes mean (SD) PEF, 69.4%
(22.7%) of predicted; FEV1, 64.8% (21.4%) of predicted; and
FEV1/FVC, 69.2% (13.5%). Baseline characteristics were well
balanced across treatment arms and centers.
Of the 199 patients randomized, all attended visit 1 (ran-
domization), 21 (10.6%) missed visit 2, 28 (14.1%) missed visit
3, and 39 (19.6%) missed visit 4; 159 (80%) patients attended
all follow-up visits. Missing visits and/or data were balanced
between the treatment arms. Day 1 was defined as the day of
administration of study drug.
Primary Outcome Analysis
Mean (SD) asthma symptom scores (from 0 = no symptoms to
6 = severe symptoms) were 4.14 (1.38) at baseline (exacerba-
tion) and 2.09 (1.71) at day 10 for the azithromycin group and
4.18 (1.48) and 2.20 (1.51), respectively, for placebo. Using mul-
tilevel modeling, there was no statistically significant differ-
ence in symptom scores between groups at day 10 (differ-
ence, −0.166; 95% CI, −0.670 to 0.337) (Figure 2 and eTable 3
in Supplement 1).
Secondary Outcome Analyses
Multilevel modeling revealed no significant between-group
differences in symptom scores on any day between baseline
and day 10 (Figure 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Signifi-
cant between-group differences were seen in neither the
acute AQLQ, the mini AQLQ (Figure 3A and B and eTables
7-10 in Supplement 1), nor in any measure of lung function
(eTables 11 and 12 in Supplement 1) on any day from baseline
to day 10, and there was no difference in time to 50% reduc-
tion in symptom score (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.71-1.49)
(Figure 3C).
Pathogen Detection Results
One hundred five (52.8%) patients provided sputum samples
for bacterial culture, 191 (96.0%) nasal and throat swabs and/or
nasal mucus samples for virus and atypical bacterial PCR, and
158 (79.4%) acute (IgM) and acute and convalescent (IgG, IgA)
serum samples for atypical bacterial serologic analysis. A bac-
terial and/or atypical bacterial test positive result occurred in
21 (10.6%) patients (9 [9.3%] active, 12 [11.8%] placebo). Nasal
and/or throat swab and/or mucus and/or sputum virus PCRs
had positive results in 36 (18.1%) patients (16 [16.5%] active,
20 [19.6%] placebo).

Subgroup Analyses
There were no differences in the primary outcome asthma
symptom score between treatment groups in patients with
positivesputumbacterialcultureresults,atypicalbacterialPCR
and/or serologic analysis results, or virus PCR test results (in-
cluding any bacteria and/or virus positive test result) (eTables
13-15andeFigures6-8inSupplement1),althoughpatientnum-
bers for these analyses were low.
Safety
Adverse events were infrequent (eTables 16-22 in Supplement
1), with more gastrointestinal adverse events in the azithro-
mycin group compared with placebo (35 vs 24 events, respec-
tively) (eTable 16 in Supplement 1). There was an increased
frequency of cardiac adverse events (4 vs 2, respectively) in
the azithromycin group compared with placebo and a
reduced frequency of respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal

otic therapy possibly reduced respiratory adverse events in
this population.
Discussion
Inthepatientswithasthmaexacerbationsrandomizedtotreat-
ment or placebo in this study, the addition of azithromycin to
standardmedicalcareresultedinnostatisticallyorclinicallysig-
nificant therapeutic benefit. The findings were consistently
negative across 3 different symptom and quality-of-life scores,
including 1 previously reporting statistically and clinically sig-
nificant benefit with telithromycin treatment.12 The findings
were also negative for all measures of lung function, including
FEV1,whichwassignificantlyimprovedinthepreviousstudy,12
and for time to a 50% reduction in asthma symptoms, which
was significantly improved in the previous study.12
Recruitmentprovedchallenging;initiallytherewere10cen-
ters, each aiming to recruit 38 participants over 1 winter sea-
son, to recruit the planned 380 patients. Our power calcula-
tion deliberately mandated large patient numbers to provide
statistically robust data to settle the important clinical ques-
tion regarding antibiotic efficacy in this setting (for compari-
son,thetelithromycinstudyrandomized270patients).12Wealso
desired larger patient numbers to enhance subgroup analyses
aimedatpotentiallyimportantmechanisticquestions.Oncere-
cruitment obstacles became clear with such widespread anti-
biotic use, a total of 31 centers were enrolled, inclusion criteria
were relaxed to change eligibility criteria from less than 24 to
less than 48 hours from time of presentation, to include older
participants with low smoking histories, and recruitment was
extended to 2 years and 7 months. However, despite all these
efforts, only 199 participants were recruited by medication ex-
piry and funding end dates and the study was terminated de-
spite not reaching its recruitment target. The study was there-
fore underpowered and a difference of 0.3 in mean symptom
score between treatment arms at 10 days cannot be excluded.
The different outcomes of the present and previous
studies,12 which used closely related therapies in similar study
designs, require interpretation and/or explanation. The antibi-
otics studied are different, albeit related. Both drugs were used
attheirstandardrecommendeddosesanddurationsoftherapy.
The shorter duration of treatment with azithromycin (3 days vs
10 days with telithromycin) is unlikely to explain the differ-
ence in outcome because azithromycin has a long tissue half-
life and is likely to have remained at therapeutic doses in the
lungforapproximately10days.29Azithromycinbutnottelithro-
mycin has antiviral activity,26 so this is an unlikely explana-
tion. In terms of antibacterial activity against relevant respira-
tory bacteria, telithromycin is reportedly more active than
azithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae but has simi-
lar activity against both Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophi-
lus influenzae.30-32 Because the present study only detected 3
S pneumoniae, 1 M catarrhalis, and no H influenzae infections
intheactivetreatmentarm,differencesinactivityagainstthese
organisms seem unlikely to explain the differing outcomes. In
terms of anti-inflammatory activities, both drugs reportedly
have similar activities when compared.25
A remarkable finding of this study was the number of pa-
tients(2044)excludedbecausetheywerealreadyreceivingan-
tibiotic therapy for their asthma exacerbation despite treat-
ment guidelines recommending that such therapy not be
routinely given.23,24 For each patient randomized, more than
10 were excluded for this reason. This important finding has
obvious and worrying implications regarding antibiotic
stewardship33; in addition, such high antibiotic use rates may
also have directly influenced the study outcome because it is

possible that patients who might potentially have benefitted
from antibiotic therapy for their asthma exacerbation (through
having sputum production, sputum purulence, fever) were
excludedfromthestudythroughalreadyhavingreceivedthem.
The population remaining to be randomized could theoreti-
cally have been selected against for antibiotic responsiveness,
through having no clinical indication that antibiotic therapy
might be of benefit. This is possible because patients being
screened had often been seen by their primary care practi-
tioner, by emergency department medical staff, and by a mem-
ber of the on-call respiratory and/or medical team, so in many
instances 3 independent physicians and/or teams had as-
sessed them, including their suitability for antibiotic therapy.
It is likely therefore that those not prescribed antibiotics were
negatively selected against, for suitability for antibiotics. This
interpretation is supported by the low bacterial and/or atypi-
cal bacterial positivity rate found in this study: only 9.3% of
azithromycin-treated participants.
It is also possible that the population randomized were in
otherwaysnotrepresentativeofthelargerpopulationscreened
because more than 2000 other patients were excluded from
the study for other reasons (Figure 1). The telithromycin study
did not report numbers of patients screened,12 so it is not pos-
sible to determine to what extent these caveats may also have
applied to that study.
A further difference is that all patients randomized to this
study were required to be prescribed oral and/or systemic cor-
ticosteroid treatment, whereas in the telithromycin study only
34.1% of patients randomized to active treatment required cor-
ticosteroid therapy.12 Requirement for corticosteroid treat-
mentinthisstudywasdesignedtoreducethenumberofmilder
exacerbations studied. However, if our study included largely
non–bacterially infected participants, this could have re-
sulted in us studying possible anti-inflammatory effects of
azithromycin, in the face of the powerful anti-inflammatory
effects of corticosteroids, with predictably negative results.
Theclinicalcharacteristicsofthepatientsinourstudycom-
pared with those in the telithromycin study were similar in
terms of mean age (39.9 years in our study vs 39.5 in the
telithromycin study), sex (30.2% male vs 32%), smoking sta-
tus (mean of 3.44 vs 2.15 pack-years), exacerbation symptom
score severity (4.16 vs 2.9), and lung function at exacerbation
(PEF, 69.4% vs 55.2% of predicted; FEV1, 64.8% vs 67.2% of
predicted; FEV1/FVC, 69.2% vs 72%).12 Differences in clinical
characteristics do not seem a likely explanation for the differ-
ence in outcome of the 2 studies.
Thestudiesdifferedstrikinglyinoneregard:61%oftelithro-
mycin-treated but only 5.2% of azithromycin-treated patients
hadapositivetestresultforcurrentatypicalbacterialinfection.12
Both studies used similar sampling and detection methods,
although the laboratories performing the analyses differed (GR
Micro London, England, for telithromycin; S.L.J.’
s laboratory
for this study). Detection rates by PCR were low in both stud-
ies (3 positive in the telithromycin study and 0 positive in this
study). In contrast, serological positive results differed mark-
edly: the telithromycin study positive results were almost all
C pneumoniae IgM positives, while in our study only 1 sample
was IgM positive for this organism. Both studies used the same
assay (Medac C pneumoniae IgM sandwich enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay, Medac) so the discrepancy between the
results of this assay is difficult to explain. This major differ-
ence in frequency of C pneumoniae IgM positivity may have
contributed to the difference in clinical outcomes between the
2 studies.
Sputumcultureforstandardbacteriawasnotperformedin
thetelithromycinstudy.12Inthepresentstudy,105(52.8%)par-
ticipants provided sputum samples for bacterial culture and
positivity was observed in 6.0% (4.1% active, 7.8% placebo).
These results, together with the negative outcomes in relation
to therapy, suggest that the role of standard bacterial infection
in the population studied was unlikely to be important.
Interpretationoftheoutcomeofthisstudymustbeconsid-
ered in the light of prior knowledge that noninfectious agents
canalsotriggerexacerbations,andofotherrandomizedplacebo-
controlled studies investigating the effects of similar therapies
in acute wheezing episodes. In addition to the telithromycin
study reporting positive outcomes in asthma exacerbations in
adults,12azithromycintreatmentduringbronchiolitisininfancy
was reported to reduce nasal lavage interleukin 8 levels, the
occurrence of postbronchiolitic wheezing,34 and the duration
of acute episodes of asthma-like symptoms in 1- to 3-year-old
children.35 Furthermore, in 1- to 6-year-old children with his-
tories of recurrent severe lower respiratory tract infections
(LRTIs), azithromycin treatment early during an apparent re-
spiratorytractinfectionreducedthelikelihoodofsevereLRTI.36
Finally,low-doseazithromycinprophylaxisfor6monthsinpar-
ticipantswithexacerbation-pronesevereasthmadidnotreduce
the primary outcome (rate of severe exacerbations and LRTIs
necessitating treatment with antibiotics); however, in a pre-
defined subgroup analysis according to inflammatory pheno-
type, azithromycin treatment benefitted participants with
noneosinophilic severe asthma.37 We therefore carried out a
similarposthocanalysisbutfoundnoevidenceofbenefitinthis
subgroup (eResults in Supplement 1). Thus, further study of
azithromycin treatment in acute exacerbations of asthma in
adults and children in settings of low rates of antibiotic use and
stratifying on blood and/or sputum cell counts seems justified.
Conclusions
In the patients randomized to treatment or placebo in this
study, addition of azithromycin to standard medical care re-
sulted in no statistically significant or clinically important ben-
efit. However, for each patient randomized, more than 10 were
excluded because they had already received antibiotics.
