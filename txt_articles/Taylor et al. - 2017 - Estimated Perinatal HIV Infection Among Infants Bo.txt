IMPORTANCE Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be reduced
through services including antiretroviral treatment and prophylaxis. Data on the national
incidence of perinatal HIV transmission and missed prevention opportunities are needed to
monitor progress toward elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the number of perinatal HIV cases among infants born in the
United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were obtained from the National HIV Surveillance
System on infants with HIV born in the United States (including the District of Columbia) and
their mothers between 2002 and 2013 (reported through December 31, 2015). Estimates
were adjusted for delay in diagnosis and reporting by weighting each reported case based on
a model incorporating time from birth to diagnosis and report. Analysis was performed from
April 1 to August 15, 2016.
EXPOSURES Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral medication, including maternal receipt
prenatally or during labor/delivery and infant receipt postnatally.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnosis of perinatally acquired HIV infection in infants
born in the United States. Infant and maternal characteristics, including receipt of perinatal
HIV testing, treatment, and prophylaxis.
RESULTS The estimated annual number of perinatally infected infants born in the United
States decreased from 216 (95% CI, 206-230) in 2002 to 69 (95% CI, 60-83) in 2013. Among
perinatally HIV-infected children born in 2002-2013, 836 (63.0%) of the mothers identified
as black or African American and 243 (18.3%) as Hispanic or Latino. A total of 236 (37.5%) of
the mothers had HIV infection diagnosed before pregnancy in 2002-2005 compared with
120 (51.5%) in 2010-2013; the proportion of mother-infant pairs receiving all 3 recommended
arms of antiretroviral prophylaxis or treatment (prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal) was
22.4% in 2002-2005 and 31.8% in 2010-2013, with approximately 179 (28.4%) (2002-2005)
and 94 (40.3%) (2010-2013) receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis or treatment during
pregnancy. Five Southern states (Florida, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Maryland) accounted
for 687 (38.0%) of infants born with HIV infection in the United States during the overall
period. According to national data for live births, the incidence of perinatal HIV infection
among infants born in the United States in 2013 was 1.75 per 100 000 live births.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite reduced perinatal HIV infection in the United States,
missed opportunities for prevention were common among infected infants and their mothers
in recent years. As of 2013, the incidence of perinatal HIV infection remained 1.75 times the
proposed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention elimination of mother-to-child HIV
transmission goal of 1 per 100 000 live births.

H
ighlyeffectiveinterventionstopreventperinataltrans-
missionofhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus(HIV)have
been available for a number of years. Beginning in
1985,theCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(CDC)rec-
ommended that HIV-infected women not breastfeed their
infants1; routine administration of antiretroviral (ARV) medi-
cation for prophylaxis, zidovudine, of HIV-infected pregnant
women,2 and the offer of prenatal HIV testing to all pregnant
women3 were recommended in 1994 and 1995, respectively.
ThepercentageofHIV-infectedpregnantwomenreceivingARV
prophylaxis rapidly increased after 1995.4,5 In 2006, the CDC
recommended universal HIV testing—using an opt-out ap-
proach—forallpregnantwomentoincreasescreeninginhealth
care settings and further reduce perinatal HIV transmission in
the United States.6
SuppressionofmaternalHIVviralloadbypotenttherapeu-
tic combinations became possible later in the 1990s with the
availability of new categories of ARVs, such as protease inhibi-
torsandnonnucleosidereversetranscriptaseinhibitors.Theuse
of these drugs in pregnant women in a manner similar to their
use in nonpregnant women became accepted practice.7 It was
also recognized that cesarean delivery before the onset of la-
bor and rupture of membranes could further decrease perina-
tal HIV transmission risk, independent of ARV use8,9; the prac-
tice was recommended for women whose viral load was not
known to be below 1000 copies/mL near the time of delivery.10
With optimal management, including suppression of HIV viral
load to undetectable levels, mother-to-child HIV transmission
rates lower than 1% can be achieved.11-13
Although identification of HIV infection is a necessary first
step in appropriate treatment and prophylaxis, reports indi-
catethataquarterofpregnantwomenhavenotbeentested.14,15
In addition, substantial proportions of women with known
HIV infection did not receive adequate prenatal care or ARV
medications.16
National estimates of the number of perinatal HIV trans-
missions in the United States are needed to guide policy and
monitor progress toward elimination of mother-to-child trans-
mission. Previous estimates of the number of perinatal HIV
cases in the United States demonstrated a peak of 1650 in 1991,
declining to 480 in 1996.5 Confidential name-based report-
ing of persons with AIDS began in all states and the District of
Columbia in the early 1980s. In contrast, confidential name-
based reporting of all persons with HIV infection (regardless
of the stage of the disease at diagnosis) was implemented by
states at different times, with 33 states having implemented
name-based HIV reporting by January 2001, 38 states by Janu-
ary 2006, and 50 states and the District of Columbia by April
2008.17Thus,themostrecentlypublishedestimateof138(95%
CI, 96-186) cases of perinatal HIV transmission for 200418 ap-
plied an indirect method using existing HIV and AIDS surveil-
lance data to extrapolate from the 33 states with name-based
HIV reporting data to all 50 US states, the District of Colum-
bia, and 5 US-dependent areas. Our objective in the present
study was to use existing HIV surveillance data to describe the
characteristics of perinatally infected children born in 2002-
2013 and known missed prevention opportunities, update the
previous estimate to include birth years 2002-2013, and pro-
vide an estimate that reflects HIV reporting data from all 50
states and the District of Columbia in recent years.
Methods
Data Sets
Diagnosis data on HIV from 50 states and the District of Co-
lumbia reported to the National HIV Surveillance System of the
CDC by December 31, 2015, were used to examine variables re-
lated to perinatal HIV transmission events from 2002 through
2013 in the United States and estimate the number of infants
with HIV infection born in each of these years. Data reported
through the National HIV Surveillance System are reported in
accordance with state notifiable disease reporting laws and re-
quirements. These data are nonresearch and do not require a
waiver of informed consent.
Part 1: Characteristics of Perinatally HIV-Infected Infants Born
in the United States, 2002-2013
We examined the characteristics of infants with perinatal HIV
infection who were born in the United States between Janu-
ary 1, 2002, and December 31, 2013, and reported to the Na-
tional HIV Surveillance System through December 31, 2015.
Data were collected by state and local surveillance staff on a
standardized Pediatric HIV Confidential Case Report form, and
deidentified data were reported monthly to the CDC. Vari-
ables examined are listed in Table 1 in 4-year intervals: mater-
nalrace/ethnicity,numberofmaternalprenatalcarevisits,tim-
ingofprenatalcare,timingofmaternalHIVdiagnosis,maternal
receipt of any ARV therapy during pregnancy, maternal re-
ceipt of any ARV during labor and delivery, child’
s receipt of
any ARV, maternal and child receipt of any ARV agent at 3 time
points (prenatal, labor and delivery, and postnatal), breast-
feeding, and mode of delivery. Data for this section were not
weighted to account for delays in diagnosis or reporting; there-
fore, the case counts for each year are lower than those in part
2, as described below (Table 2).

Key Points
Question What are the numbers and characteristics of infants
with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection born
in the United States in recent years?
Findings Data reported to the National HIV Surveillance System
show that the estimated number of infants born with perinatal HIV
infection decreased from 216 in 2002 to 69 in 2013. Maternal and
infant factors associated with infant HIV infection include late
maternal diagnosis and lack of antiretroviral treatment and
prophylaxis.
Meaning Despite reductions in perinatal HIV transmission in the
United States, gaps in HIV diagnosis and treatment persist.

developed by adjusting the reported number of perinatal HIV
cases to account for delay in diagnosis and reporting. A peri-
natally HIV-infected infant may not be diagnosed at birth, and
a diagnosed case may not be reported to the system immedi-
ately. Therefore, the delay associated with the diagnosis and
reporting of a perinatally HIV-infected infant is defined as the
time from the date when a perinatally HIV-infected infant was
born to the date when HIV infection was diagnosed and re-
ported to the National HIV Surveillance System. Based on the
clear biphasic delay pattern observed among reported cases,

we estimated the probabilities that perinatally infected per-
sons were diagnosed and reported within certain times using
conditional probabilities. For delays longer than 4 years, we
modeled the probability by a truncated exponential distribu-
tion. For delays less than 4 years, we modeled the probability
by a nonparametric approach using the life-table method.19,20
Through this procedure, each reported case was assigned a
weight to account not only for reported infants but also for in-
fants born in each year who had not yet been reported to the
CDC. The weight is the inverse of the diagnosis and reporting
delay probability associated with the case. To determine
whether there was a significant increasing or decreasing trend
in the estimated annual numbers of perinatally HIV-infected
infants, the estimated annual percent change and associated
95% CIs were calculated. A change in trend was considered sta-
tistically significant if the P value is <.05.21
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation for 95% CI
Given the national estimate of perinatally infected infants in all
50 states and the District of Columbia, N = n×w, where N is the
national estimate, n is the reported number of perinatal HIV
casesbybirthyear,andwisthefinalreportingdelayweight,we
estimated the uncertainty around each of the 2 variables (n and
w) and then used Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to cal-
culate the 95% CI of the estimated number of perinatal HIV in-
fectionsineachbirthyear.Theuncertaintyassociatedwitheach
input was incorporated into the final estimate by randomly re-
sampling each variable under a plausible probability distribu-
tion. In particular, the Poisson distribution was used for re-
sampling the count data (n: yearly births of perinatal HIV and
AIDScases),andthebinomialdistributionwasusedforresamp-
lingthereportingprobability(w = 1/reportingprobability).Simu-
lation results from 1000 runs for each estimate were used to
compute the confidence intervals. Random sampling was ap-
pliedintheMarkovChainMonteCarlosimulationprocedure.22
The distribution of the values for each output estimate reflects
the overall uncertainty that is associated with the input val-
ues. The 95% CIs were derived by identification of the 2.5 and
97.5 percentile values for the distribution of computational re-
sults. Using the estimated number of perinatal HIV infections,
as described above, we then calculated the incidence of peri-
natal HIV infection as the estimated number of perinatal infec-
tions per 100 000 live births, with denominators based on na-
tionalbirthregistrydata.23Allanalyseswereperformedbyusing
SAS,version9.3(SASInstituteInc).Analysiswasperformedfrom
April 1 to August 15, 2016.
Results
Characteristics of Perinatally HIV-infected Infants
Nearly two-thirds (63.0%) of the mothers of perinatally HIV-
infected infants born in the United States during this time pe-
riod were black or African American, and 18.3% were His-
panic or Latino (Table 1). Nearly half (48.9%) of the mothers
had missing or an unknown number of prenatal care visits,
while 40.0% had at least 1 prenatal visit during the index preg-
nancy, and 11.2% had no reported prenatal care visits. The per-
centage of women having no reported prenatal care visits in-
creased from 9.7% in 2002-2005 to 16.7% in 2010-2013.
Prenatal care was started in the first or second trimester in
39.6% of pregnancies and during the third trimester in 7.3%
(53.1% unknown).
Among the mothers of all perinatally HIV-infected in-
fants born in 2002-2013, 41.8% had HIV infection diagnosed
prior to the index pregnancy, with this proportion being 37.5%
for mothers of children born during 2002-2005 and 51.5% for
those with children born during 2010-2013. Diagnosis was
made at or after delivery in 30.3% of the mothers during 2002-
2005, compared with 21.6% during 2010-2013. Prenatal ARV
medications were used by 179 (28.4%) of the mothers during
2002-2005 and 94 (40.3%) during 2010-2013. Overall, 25.4%
of mother-infant pairs received ARV medications at all of the
3 recommended time points (ie, prenatally, during labor, and
totheinfantafterbirth)from2002through2013,withthispro-
portionbeing22.4%during2002-2005and31.8%during2010-
2013. Breastfeeding was reported by mothers of 10.6% of HIV-
infected infants during 2002-2013 (range, 8.8%-11.9%).

ARV medications during the pregnancy, delivery, and postna-
tal periods, compared with 4.0% of those with HIV diag-
nosed at delivery or later. Similarly, for the same time period,
42.7% of women with at least 1 prenatal care visit received ARV
medications at all 3 time points compared with 7.6% of women
with no prenatal care visits.
Estimated Number of Perinatal HIV Infections
Applying the reporting delay weights to the number of cases
reportedforbirthyears2002-2013,weestimatedthat216(95%
CI, 206 to 230) perinatal HIV infections occurred among in-
fants born in the United States in 2002 (5.37 per 100 000 live
births) (Table 2 and Figure 1). In 2013, we estimated that there
were 69 (95% CI, 60 to 83) perinatal HIV infections (1.75 per
100 000 live births). The estimated annual percentage change
from 2002 to 2013 was −8.4% (95% CI, −9.7% to −7.2%;
P < .001). During the entire observation period (2002-2013),
there were an estimated 1810 infants born with HIV infection
in the United States, 1221 (67.5%) of whom were born in 10
states (in descending order: Florida, Texas, New York, Geor-
gia, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey,
and Maryland). Five of these states are in the South (Florida,
Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Maryland) and accounted for
687 (38.0%) of the cases.
During the most recent 4-year period (2010-2013), an es-
timated 134 infants were born in 3 states (in descending or-
der:Florida,48;Texas,44;andGeorgia,42)constituting36.2%
oftheestimatednumberofinfantsborn.Thedenominatorused
for these calculations was based on the state data provided in
Figure 2, which differ from the totals presented in Table 2 be-
cause of rounding. Eleven states had 10 or more infants born
with HIV infection; HIV infection occurred in 275 infants in
these 11 states, which accounted for 74.3% of the infants with
HIV infection born during this period. The estimated inci-
dence of perinatal HIV infection from 2010 to 2013 was less
than 1.0 per 100 000 live births for 23 jurisdictions, 1.0 to 1.99
per 100 000 live births for 12 jurisdictions, 2.0 to 3.99 per
100 000 live births for 9 jurisdictions, and 4.0 or more per
100 000 live births for 7 jurisdictions (Figure 2). Among the
16 jurisdictions with an incidence of 2.0 or more per 100 000
live births, 10 were in the South.
Discussion
Inthisanalysis,weexaminedcharacteristicsofperinatallyHIV-
infected infants born in the United States between 2002 and
2013 based on national HIV surveillance data. Many mother-
infant pairs had missed at least 1 prevention opportunity. The
most common of these factors was lack of appropriate ARV
medications during pregnancy; just 25.4% of HIV-infected
mother-infantpairswereknowntohavereceivedatleast1ARV
during all 3 recommended periods (pregnancy, delivery, and
postnatal)overthe12-yearperiodexamined.LackofARVmedi-
cations was associated with late maternal HIV diagnosis.
During the analysis period, we observed some positive
changes in the percentage of HIV-infected infants and their
mothers who had received recommended prevention inter-
ventions. Observed increases in ARV use remained lower than
the goal of universal perinatal ARV prophylaxis for preven-
tion of perinatal HIV transmission. The observed increase in
the percentage of women with HIV diagnosed prior to preg-
nancy, which at face value seems contrary to the apparent in-
crease in the percentage of women with no prenatal care dur-
ing the latter years (2010-2013), may be indicative of increased
HIV testing in general among women during this period.
The prevalence of missed opportunities observed in this
study among all infants with diagnosed HIV born in the United
States between 2002 and 2013 was consistent with that seen
among HIV-infected women and their infants reported to the
CDC’
s Enhanced Perinatal HIV Surveillance System from 15
high-prevalenceareasintheUnitedStates(2005-2008).16Data
fromtheEnhancedPerinatalHIVSurveillanceSystemfor2005-
2008 showed slight increases in the percentages of women
with HIV diagnosed prior to pregnancy (from 66% to 71%), re-
ceiving prenatal ARV medications (from 82% to 87%), and re-
ceiving intrapartum ARV medications (from 81% to 88%), but
they showed no apparent change in the percentage of preg-
nant women with prenatal care (90%).16
The continuing prevalence of missed prevention oppor-
tunities suggests that the remaining HIV transmissions occur
inasubsetofthepopulationthatisparticularlydifficulttoreach
with the recommended interventions.24 One could hypoth-
esize that the difficulty in reaching this population may also
be reflected by the increasing percentage of women who, al-
though infection was diagnosed before pregnancy, had not ap-
parently been successfully linked to—and retained in—care.
Stated differently, the fact that infants continue to acquire HIV
infection appears to be the result of the same reasons that have
been known for years and likely not as a result of a previously
unrecognized factor, such as increasing ARV resistance or an
increasing incidence of women with acute HIV infection dur-
ing pregnancy.
These findings suggest that new strategies and more in-
tense public health interventions may be needed to maintain

theachievementsattainedthusfarandultimatelyeliminateperi-
natal HIV transmission in the United States.25 Given the asso-
ciation that we observed between late maternal diagnosis and
lackofARVreceipt,additionalemphasisonpreconceptioncoun-
seling of HIV-infected women could provide one opportunity
to ensure that all women have an effectively suppressed viral
load before delivery.26 Increased testing of partners of known
HIV-infectedadultscanspecifythetypeofpreconceptioncoun-
selingthatacoupleneeds.Manyofthepersonsidentifiedinthis
way will belong to HIV-discordant couples of reproductive age
who could benefit from different approaches to planning safer
conception and pregnancy, regardless of which partner is HIV
infected.27 AcuteHIVinfectionduringpregnancyappearstobe
playing a consistent role in remaining transmissions,28-30 un-
derscoring the usefulness of repeat HIV testing during preg-
nancy, as recommended by the CDC.6
The geographic distribution of these cases reflects the
changing geography of HIV infections among women, with
Southern states having a larger proportion of cases than in the
past.5 The cases were concentrated in 10 states, highlighting
the need to maintain great levels of capacity in these areas.
However, the fact that cases were diagnosed in most jurisdic-
tions during the overall study period highlights the need to
maintain capacity in all states to detect and respond appro-
priately to perinatal HIV exposures and infections; it further
suggests that an approach to prevention might include a de-
tailed review of every case of transmission as a sentinel health
event. It was for this reason that the CDC included in its 2012
HIV prevention grants to health departments support for a pre-
vention strategy that includes detailed review of every trans-
mission; this strategy is known as the Fetal-Infant Mortality
Review–HIV Prevention Methodology.31 As of 2015, 9 jurisdic-
tions had implemented this methodology.
Our estimates show important differences compared with
themostrecentpriorpublishedanalysisofperinatalHIVtrends
in the United States, which estimated that 277 perinatal HIV
infections had occurred in 2001, declining to 138 in 2004 and
a total of 509 born during 2002-2004.18 Our analysis for 2002-
2004 found approximately 20% more infections (n = 608) de-
spite the fact that our estimate excluded infants born outside
the United States. The prior estimates assumed that all cases
would be reported to the system within 4 years.18 This as-
sumption underestimated the number of perinatally HIV-
infectedinfantsduringthatstudyperiod.Withmoreyears’data
available for the present analysis and more jurisdictions re-
porting HIV diagnoses, we found that some cases were first re-
ported up to 9 years after the birth year, and we modified our
methodology to account for the longer observed reporting de-
lays. The present study also updated these estimates for more
recent years and found that the estimated number of perina-
tally acquired HIV infections in the United States subse-
quently declined from 182 in 2005 to 69 in 2013.
Toourknowledge,thisstudyprovidesthemostgeographi-
cally and temporally extensive data available describing sub-
stantial decreases in recent HIV transmissions to US-born in-
fants and presents a national estimate of the incidence of
perinatalHIVinfection.Inthemostrecentyearavailable(2013),
the incidence of perinatal HIV infection in the United States
continued to be 1.75 times as high as the CDC perinatal HIV
elimination incidence goal of 1 infection per 100 000 live
births.25 The other component of that elimination goal is a
mother-to-child transmission rate of less than 1% (the num-
ber of infected infants divided by the number of HIV-infected
women delivering). There are no specific data on the number
of HIV-exposed deliveries in the United States, and the de-
gree to which the most recent estimate (approximately 8700

tocharacterizemorespecificallythelengthoftimebetweenma-

substantial amount of missing data for some of the variables in

Even if perinatal rates in the “elimination” range are achieved
in any given year or jurisdiction, it will be necessary to sus-
