Summary
Background Tackling tuberculosis requires testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis in high-risk groups. The aim 
of this study was to estimate the predictive values of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and two interferon-γ release assays 
(IGRAs) for the development of active tuberculosis in high-risk groups—ie, people in recent contact with active 
tuberculosis cases and from high-burden countries.
Method In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 54 centres (eg, clinics, community settings) in 
London, Birmingham, and Leicester in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older and at high 
risk for latent tuberculosis infection (ie, recent contact with someone with active tuberculosis [contacts] or a migrant 
who had arrived in the UK in the past 5 years from—or who frequently travelled to—a country with a high burden of 
tuberculosis [migrants]). Exclusion criteria included prevalent cases of tuberculosis, and participants who were treated 
for latent tuberculosis after a positive test result in this study. Each participant received three tests (QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold-In Tube, T-SPOT.TB, and a Mantoux TST). A positive TST result was reported using three thresholds: 5 mm 
(TST-5), 10 mm (TST-10), and greater than 5 mm in BCG-naive or 15 mm in BCG-vaccinated (TST-15) participants. 
Participants were followed up from recruitment to development of tuberculosis or censoring. Incident tuberculosis 
cases were identified by national tuberculosis databases, telephone interview, and review of medical notes. Our primary 
objective was to estimate the prognostic value of IGRAs compared with TST, assessed by the ratio of incidence rate 
ratios and predictive values for tuberculosis development. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01162265, 
and is now complete.
Findings Between May 4, 2010, and June 1, 2015, 10 045 people were recruited, of whom 9610 were eligible for 
inclusion. Of this cohort, 4861 (50·6%) were contacts and 4749 (49·4%) were migrants. Participants were followed up 
for a median of 2·9 years (range 21 days to 5·9 years). 97 (1·0%) of 9610 participants developed active tuberculosis 
(77 [1·2%] of 6380 with results for all three tests). In all tests, annual incidence of tuberculosis was very low in those 
who tested negatively (ranging from 1·2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 0·6–2·0 for TST-5 to 1·9 per 1000 person-years, 
95% CI 1·3–2·7, for QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube). Annual incidence in participants who tested positively were 
highest for T-SPOT.TB (13·2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 9·9–17·4), TST-15 (11·1 per 1000 person-years, 8·3–14·6), 
and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (10·1 per 1000 person-years, 7·4–13·4). Positive results for these tests were 
significantly better predictors of progression than TST-10 and TST-5 (eg, ratio of test positivity rates in those 
progressing to tuberculosis compared with those not progressing T-SPOT.TB vs TST-5: 1·99, 95% CI 1·68–2·34; 
p<0·0001). However, TST-5 identified a higher proportion of participants who progressed to active tuberculosis 
(64 [83%] of 77 tested) than all other tests and TST thresholds (≤75%).
Interpretation IGRA-based or BCG-stratified TST strategies appear most suited to screening for potential disease 
progression among high-risk groups. Further work will be needed to assess country-specific cost-effectiveness of each 
screening test, and in the absence of highly specific diagnostic tests, cheap non-toxic treatments need to be developed 
that could be given to larger groups of people at potential risk.

effort to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Current tests 
(ie, tuberculin skin test [TST] and interferon-γ release 
assays [IGRAs]) for latent tuberculosis infection detect 
memory T-cell responses to M tuberculosis.4 The aim of 
these tests is to identify individuals who might benefit 
from treatment for latent tuberculosis infection, so 
reducing tuberculosis incidence and transmission.
Evaluating these tests requires cohort studies that 
assess individuals’ IGRA and TST status at baseline with 
prospective follow-up to determine the predictive values 
of each test for the development of active tuberculosis. 
Systematic reviews5,6 have highlighted heterogeneity and 
a paucity of relevant studies, particularly of head-to-head 
comparisons of different testing strategies in countries 
with a low incidence of tuberculosis where the risk of 
reinfection is low. Previous head-to-head comparisons 
have 
been 
relatively 
small 
scale 
(ie, 
135–1335 
participants)7–10 
and most7–9 have assessed only two testing strategies. To 
assess the prognostic value of tuberculosis testing kits, we 
did a head-to-head comparison of the incidence rate ratio 
(IRR) of tuberculosis as assessed by three different tests 
applied to the same individuals in a large prospective 
cohort of people who did not take preventive treatment.
Methods
Study design and participants
The UK Prognostic Evaluation of Diagnostic IGRAs 
Consortium (UK PREDICT) tuberculosis study was a 
prospective cohort study in which participants were 
recruited from 54 UK National Health Service (NHS) 
centres and community settings (eg, places of worship, 
schools and colleges, and workplaces) in London, 
Birmingham, and Leicester. The study procedures and 
protocol were approved by the Brent NHS Research Ethics 
Committee (10/H0717/14). The full protocol is available 
online.
Individuals were eligible if they were aged 16 years and 
older and at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection. 
Individuals at high risk were classified into two groups, 
those who had recent contact with someone with active 
tuberculosis (ie, contacts, full definition in appendix), 
and migrants who arrived in the UK in the past 5 years 
from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis 
(ie, sub-Saharan African or Asian regions) or who 
frequently travelled to countries with a high burden of 
tuberculosis (ie, migrants). Participants who could 
classify as both contact and migrant were classified as 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Multiple systematic reviews of the predictive value of 
interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) have been done, with the 
most recent review for the WHO guidelines on latent 
tuberculosis. We did an up-to-date review, by searching 
PubMed, with no language restrictions, for publications 
between Jan 1, 2013, and June 1, 2017, using the search terms 
“interferon-γ release assay”, “T-cell-based assay”, 
“antigen-specific T cell”, “T cell response”, “interferon”, 
“interferon-γ”, “γ-interferon”, “IFN”, “elispot”, “ESAT-6”, 
“CFP-10”, “culture filtrate protein”, “Enzyme Linked 
Immunosorbent Spot”, “Quantiferon”, “Quantiferon-TB” AND 
“tuberculosis”, “mycobacterium tuberculosis”. We found only 
eight head-to-head studies that used commercial IGRAs and 
tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and in which participants were not 
given preventive therapy to allow the calculation of prognostic 
predictive values, and of these studies only three had incidence 
rate ratio analyses. The WHO systematic review and our 
updated search found that the positive predictive value of 
IGRAs is low and similar to that of TSTs in high-burden settings, 
and the negative predictive value is high in all settings. 
Furthermore, the systematic review and subsequent published 
studies concluded that the quality of evidence was low because 
of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness. 
Notably, few studies were available that determined the 
predictive utility of the tests in subgroups (including people 
with and without previous BCG vaccination).
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest and first adequately 
powered study in a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis 
where the risk of reinfection is low to provide evidence that the 
predictive value of IGRAs is less than estimated previously. 
Although we found no significant differences in negative 
predictive values between the two IGRAs and TST in 
head-to-head comparisons, we found differences in the 
proportion of participants who were classified as negative by 
these tests, and in the positive prediction of progression to 
active tuberculosis. A positive T-SPOT.TB result was a 
significantly better predictor of disease progression than all 
other tests, TST that accounted for BCG-vaccination status 
(TST-15) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube were significantly 
better predictors of progression than TST-10 (with a 10 mm 
positive threshold), while a positive TST-5 result (5 mm positive 
threshold) was a significantly worse predictor of progression 
than all other tests. Additionally, we did subgroup analysis for 
migrants and contacts.
Implications of all the available evidence
Compared with the evidence in the WHO guidelines, among 
participants with positive IGRA results we found a decreased 
progression to active tuberculosis. This finding has implications 
for national and WHO policy and future recommendations. 
We provide evidence on which tests should be selected for the 
implementation of migrant testing for latent tuberculosis 
infection in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis and 
for contact investigation. We found substantial differences in 
TST performance when stratified by BCG-vaccination status, 
which is relevant to cost-effectiveness analysis and future 
guidelines.

contacts if they were recruited from a contact clinic, 
otherwise they were classified as migrants. Recruitment 
of individuals older than 35 years was prioritised, since at 
the time of recruitment they would not be eligible for 
treatment with chemoprophylaxis for latent tuberculosis 
infection and would better show the natural progression 
to active disease. Participants who were diagnosed with 
active tuberculosis at baseline or within 21 days of study 
enrolment were considered prevalent cases and excluded 
from analysis. Participants were excluded if they were 
treated for latent tuberculosis infection after a positive 
test result from this study; however, we did not exclude 
those who had been treated for tuberculosis or latent 
tuberculosis infection before recruitment and had 
subsequent exposure. Further details of eligibility criteria 
and recruitment are in the appendix (pp 2–3). All 
participants provided written informed consent.
Data collection
Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected by 
trained research nurses using paper questionnaires 
including questions on age, sex, country of birth, date of 
entry to the UK, ethnicity, nature and duration of 
tuberculosis contact (eg, household or non-household, 
when applicable), BCG-vaccination status, self-reported 
HIV status, history of tuberculosis, other medical 
diagnoses, and use of immunosuppressive drugs (see 
protocol for complete data collected). For patients 
classified as contacts, the index cases were identified 
through records by centre staff and via a contact 
investigation (also known as contact tracing—ie, the 
process of assessing all contacts of tuberculosis patients 
to determine whether they are infected or have 
tuberculosis disease; the investigation is usually led by 
clinic staff).
Testing procedures and follow-up
The protocol required tests for latent tuberculosis 
infection to be done among participants with recent 
contact about 6 weeks after last known exposure (based 
on UK guidelines11) and among those who were new 
entrants to the UK at least 6 weeks after arrival in the 
country, to ensure sufficient time for development of a 
cell-mediated immune response that would be detectable 
by the tests. However, these intervals were longer than 
10 weeks before testing for all participants.
Participants were tested with two IGRAs: QuantiFERON-
TB Gold In-Tube (Cellestis, Chadstone, VIC, Australia), an 
ELISA-based test; T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, 
Oxford, UK), an ELISpot-based test; and then with a 
Mantoux TST (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, 
Denmark) in the same clinic visit by use of standardised 
protocols. Indeterminate results were classified as 
recommended by the manufacturer. IGRA results were 
provided to participants’ clinicians only for samples that 
were to be processed in the Public Health England 
laboratory of participants aged 35 years or younger; at the 
time of the study, UK National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines did not recommend 
the testing of individuals older than 35 years for latent 
tuberculosis infection. Laboratory staff were not informed 
of TST results and each IGRA was done independently of 
the result of the other IGRA.
We assessed three different thresholds for a positive 
TST result. On the basis of 2016 NICE guidelines,12 a skin 
induration measuring 5 mm or larger is considered a 
positive result irrespective of BCG vaccination status, and 
we refer to this threshold as TST-5. We used additional 
thresholds of TST-10 for skin indurations measuring 
10 mm or more and also a BCG-dependent definition of 
TST-15, which for BCG-vaccinated participants was 
positive at 15 mm or larger, and for unvaccinated 
participants was positive at greater than 5 mm (previous 
NICE definition).11 For the primary analysis, if BCG status 
was unknown participants were assumed to have been 
vaccinated if they were not UK born (consistent with 
international recommendations).
Participants were followed up from recruitment to the 
development of tuberculosis or censoring at data cutoff. 
Participants were contacted via telephone and interviewed 
at 12 and 24 months. At data cutoff, active tuberculosis 
was identified by use of the national tuberculosis 
database, 
which 
includes 
all 
statutorily 
notified 
tuberculosis patients and all results of positive 
M 
tuberculosis 
cultures. 
Clinical 
and 
laboratory 
information on all cases of active tuberculosis was 
obtained from patient notes. Of the participants who had 
recent contact with a case of tuberculosis, those who 
progressed to active tuberculosis had their strain 
compared with the index case by use of 24-locus 
mycobacterial 
interspersed 
repetitive 
unit-variable 
number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) data.
Outcomes and identification of active tuberculosis
Our primary objective was to assess the prognostic 
value of the two IGRAs with the standard Mantoux 
TST in predicting active tuberculosis among untreated 
individuals who are at an increased risk. Active 
tuberculosis was defined as a culture-confirmed case of 
tuberculosis, or a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis with 
radiological or histological evidence and treatment by a 
clinician with a full course of antituberculosis disease 
treatment (appendix p 4). Primary analysis was done by 
use of data from the participants who completed all tests 
and had full follow-up data (ie, per-protocol population).
Secondary objectives that are discussed in this Article 
were to independently quantify and compare the 
predictive value of the whole-blood ELISA-based test 
(QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube) and the ELISpot-based 
test (T-Spot.TB).

positively and those who tested negatively and calculating 
the incidence of active tuberculosis in each group, and 
we calculated the 95% CI of this estimate using a Poisson 
exact method. We calculated the incidences using all 
available follow-up data. The discriminatory predictive 
value of each test or strategy was estimated as the IRR 
comparing the incidence of tuberculosis among those 
who had a positive test result versus those who had a 
negative test result. In the primary analyses we only 
used data from participants with results for all three 
tests.
We made pairwise comparisons of the ability of tests and 
strategies (ie, use of TST thresholds) to identify participants 
who progressed to active tuberculosis and those who did 
not using generalised estimating equation marginal 
regression models (appendix p 5).13 We used these models 
to estimate ratios of positive results and of negative results 
among those who progressed to active tuberculosis 
compared with those who did not (similar to positive and 
negative likelihood ratios for diagnostic studies). We 
calculated ratios of these ratios to make pairwise 
comparisons between tests, accounting for the paired data.
We calculated positive and negative predictive values of 
each test, with the positive predictive value being the 
proportion of participants with a positive result who 
developed tuberculosis by data cutoff, and the negative 
predictive value being the proportion of participants with 
a negative result who did not develop tuberculosis.
We did four sensitivity analyses. First, the main analysis 
was repeated excluding participants with an unknown 
BCG-vaccination status. Second, we did the analysis 
including all available test results, not just those from 
participants who had results from all three tests. Third, 
we repeated the analysis with stratification of participants 
by whether they were classified as a contact or a migrant. 
Finally, the analysis was restricted to data up to 1 year of 
follow-up.
We approached all tuberculosis clinics in London, 
Birmingham, and Leicester to participate, and we recruited 
from sites in the community with a large number of 
immigrants, including Hindu and Sikh temples, mosques, 
churches, doctor’s surgeries, and work places.
We assumed that 50% of contacts and new entrants would 
be aged 35 years or older, so a cohort of 10 000 people would

initially yield at least 5000 participants for the primary 
analysis of progression without treatment, of whom 
90 evaluable events would occur. Given probable loss to 
follow-up (which, based on clinic data, was likely to be 
around 20%) and the possibility that progression to disease 
could be less than 5%, we calculated that the power of the 
study would be maintained by including in the cohort all 
participants aged 16–35 years who did not take ciprofloxacin 
(estimated to be an additional 2500 participants). Overall, 
we calculated that 90 incident events would still be observed 
should 7500 participants be recruited, 20% lost to follow-up, 
and the rate of progression to disease only 4·2%. Our 
sample size calculations (appendix pp 5–6) indicated that a 
cohort of 5000 participants with 90 cases of active 
tuberculosis would have approximately 85% power to detect 
significant (p<0·05) differences in predictive per 
form 
ance 
arising from differences in sensitivity and specificity of 
10% between tests.
The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT01162265, and is now complete.

Results
Between May 4, 2010, and June 1, 2015, 10 045 people 
were recruited from 54 centres in London, Birmingham, 
and Leicester, of whom 435 (4·3%) were excluded 
because of possible active tuberculosis at baseline 
(175 [1·7%]) and treatment for latent tuberculosis 
infection subsequent to initial testing (260 [2·6%]; 
figure 1). The 9610 remaining participants were classified 
into two groups, 4861 (50·6%) as contacts (of whom 
3075 [63·3%] were household contacts), and 4749 (49·4%) 
as migrants from a country with a high incidence of 
tuberculosis. Full baseline demographic and clinical data 
are in table 1.
Index cases were identified for 2211 (45·5%) of 
4861 contacts. 693 (54·9%) of 1263 index cases (some 
index cases were shared between contacts, and some 
were not found for the purposes of this study) had 
pulmonary tuberculosis, with (138 [20%] of 693) or 
without (555 [80%] of 693) tuberculosis disease at extra-
pulmonary sites. 578 (46%) of 1263 index cases had 
pulmonary tuberculosis and known sputum smear 
status, 461 (80%) of whom were sputum smear positive. 
All other contacts were identified during contact 
investigations but no information on the index cases for 
these contacts was available.
By data cutoff (May 30, 2016), 97 (1·0%) of 
9610 participants had developed tuberculosis (table 2, 
figure 1). The median duration of follow-up for all 
participants was 2·9 years (range 21 days to 5·9 years).

6380 (66·4%) participants completed all tests and follow-
up (the per-protocol population) and were included in the 
primary analysis, of whom 77 (1·2%) developed 
tuberculosis. Figures 2A–F show Kaplan-Meier graphs of 
time to progression to tuberculosis in the per-protocol 
population and each test by result. Of the 77 participants 
who developed active tuberculosis, the QuantiFERON-
TB Gold-In Tube test identified 47 (61%) participants as 
positive, T-SPOT.TB identified 52 (68%) as positive, 
the TST-5 threshold identified 64 (83%) as positive, the 
TST-10 threshold identified 58 (75%) as positive, and the 
TST-15 threshold identified 52 (68%) as positive (figure 1). 
The 5 mm threshold TST (TST-5) positively identified 
more participants who progressed to tuberculosis than 
any of the other TST thresholds or tests (figure 1). The 
proportion of participants who classified as test negative 
varied considerably across the tests, largely driven by the 
TST threshold. Only 3423 (54%) participants tested 
negative by use of TST-5, which increased to 4229 (66%) 
with TST-10 and 4895 (77%) with TST-15. 5145 (81%) 
participants tested as negative with T-SPOT.TB and 
4936 (77%) with QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube test, 
similar to the results of TST-15.
Of 14 participants classified as contacts who developed 
tuberculosis and for whom MIRU-VNTR data were 
available for the contact and index case, strain comparison 
suggested that 13 cases were probably related to the index 
case.
Across the three index tests and TST thresholds, little 
variation was seen in tuberculosis incidence among

participants with negative results, with annual incidences 
of 1·2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0·6–2·0) for TST-5 
to 1·9 per 1000 person-years (1·3–2·7) for QuantiFERON-
TB Gold-In Tube test (table 3). By contrast, the annual 
incidence among the participants who tested positive 
varied a lot more between tests, with T-SPOT.TB having 
the highest annual incidence (13·2 per 1000 person-
years, 95% CI 9·9–17·4), but only slightly higher than 
was found for TST-15 (11·1 per 1000 person-years, 
8·3–14·6) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube (10·1 per 
1000 person-years, 7·4–13·4). Both TST-5 and TST-10 
were worse predictors than TST-15.
Formal statistical comparisons of the predictive value 
of positive and negative results of tests showed that a 
positive result for TST-5 was a significantly worse 
predictor of progression to active tuberculosis than 
positive results for any of the other tests (table 4). A 
positive T-SPOT.TB result was a significantly better 
predictor of progression to active tuberculosis than all 
other tests. A positive result from TST-15 or 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube were also significantly 
better predictors of progression to active tuberculosis 
than a positive result for TST-10. The difference between 
a positive TST-15 result and a positive result for 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube was not significant in 
predicting progression. We found no significant 
differences between negative results for single tests in 
predicting 
non-progression 
to 
active 
tuberculosis 
(table 5).
Sensitivity analyses, including analysis stratified by 
contacts and migrants, gave results consistent with the 
main study findings (appendix pp 7–11).
The positive predictive values for each test were 
calculated. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube had a 
positive predictive value of 3·3%, T-SPOT.TB had a value 
of 4·2%, TST-5 had a value of 2·2%, TST-10 had a value 
of 2·7%, and TST-15 had a value of 3·5% (table 3). The 
negative predictive values of each test were 99·4% for

99·6% for TST-5, 99·6% for TST-10, and 99·5% for 
TST-15 (table 3). In the sensitivity analyses, for contacts 
the positive predictive values of each test were slightly 
higher than for the whole per-protocol population, and 
the positive predictive values for migrants were lower 
than for the whole per-protocol population (appendix p 11).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study, we used the annual 
incidences of tuberculosis to quantify the ability of TST 
and two IGRAs to predict progression to active 
tuberculosis among high-risk populations. We found 
that the IGRA T-SPOT.TB had a positive predictive value 
of 4·2%, and the BCG-stratified TST, TST-15, had a 
positive predictive value of 3·5%, with the highest IRRs 
(comparing the incidence of tuberculosis for those with 
positive and negative results; 8·8 [95% CI 5·5–14·2] for 
T-SPOT.TB and 7·1 [4·4–11·4] for TST-15).
To identify the most suitable screening test to assess 
the progression of disease, three criteria need to be met: 
a high proportion of tested individuals should be 
classified as test negative and therefore require no 
further monitoring; a low rate of progression to 
tuberculosis in those who tested as negative, indicating 
the test’s ability to successfully categorise individuals 
who are at low progression risk; and increased likelihood 
of progression in those who test as positive, indicating 
the ability of the test to correctly predict disease.
Although little between-test variation was seen in 
tuberculosis incidence in participants who tested negative, 
the proportion of participants who were classified as test 
negative (and hence considered unlikely to progress) 
varied considerably, especially by TST threshold, for which 
TST-5 classified the lowest proportion of participants as 
negative, followed by TST-10 and TST-15. The proportion 
of participants who tested negative was similar for 
T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube, and TST-15. 
The incidence among participants who tested positive 
varied, such that T-SPOT.TB was the best predictor of 
disease progression, although the incidence was only 
slightly different from that found among those who tested 
positive by use of TST-15 and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-
Tube. Both TST-5 and TST-10 were less predictive than 
TST-15.
While the low fixed thresholds for the TST-positive 
cutoff detected the highest proportion of individuals who 
progressed to tuberculosis (83% at 5 mm and 75% at 
10 mm compared with 68% for TST-15), they also led to a 
substantially higher number of participants categorised 
as at risk of progression and lower progression among 
the participants who tested positively than was found 
with the high threshold TST. Compared with TST-15, 
TST-10 reclassified 666 (10·4%) of 6380 participants 
tested as high risk (of whom six progressed to 
tuberculosis) and TST-5 reclassified a further 806 (12·6%) 
participants as high risk (of whom a further six progressed 
to tuberculosis). The incidence in those reclassified 
from TST-15 to TST-10 was 2·8 per 1000 person-years, 
(95% CI 1·0–6·1) and from TST-10 to TST-5 was 2·3 per 
1000 person-years (95% CI 0·8–5·0).
When the intention is to identify the largest proportion 
of individuals with a positive test result who might 
progress to active tuberculosis, such as among household 
contacts of patients with smear-positive pulmonary 
tuberculosis, TST-5—as currently recommended in US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines14—
might be the best approach. By contrast, screening 
programmes (eg, of migrants) should consider progression 
rates, the trade-off between the three criteria of selecting 
the most appropriate testing method outlined earlier, and 
the cost-effectiveness of the selected testing strategy.
We compared our results with the review that informed 
the WHO guidelines on managing latent tuberculosis15,16 
and summarised all existing pairwise comparisons of an 
IGRA versus TST. We identified several studies in our 
literature search and from the WHO review that evaluated 
TST versus a single IGRA in high incidence countries,16 
and four did head-to-head comparisons in low incidence 
countries.7–10 However, only one of these studies compared 
TST with each of the commercially available IGRAs,10 and 
the other three studies only compared TST with 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube.7–9 Although sample 
sizes ranged from 339 to 1335 participants, all four studies 
had 15 or fewer individuals who progressed to active 
tuberculosis. To our knowledge, our study is the largest 
head-to-head comparison of the three available diagnostic 
tests for latent tuberculosis infection, both in terms of the 
number of participants and progressions to active 
tuberculosis. Our estimates of positive predictive value 
are towards the low end of those previously reported7–10,17–23 
and are less than were found in two other small cohort 
studies.8,24 Positive predictive values for the development 
of active tuberculosis depend in part on the incidence of 
tuberculosis in the study population—ie, the positive 
predictive value is higher when the incidence is greater.8

showed similar IRRs to those for both IGRAs, which is in 
contrast with the WHO guidelines review16 that concluded 
TSTs had a lower IRR than IGRAs for progression to 
active tuberculosis in low incidence countries. In our 
study, progression of disease was increased among the 
recently exposed participants compared with migrants 
whose infection had probably been acquired in another 
country.
In the primary analysis, we used data only from 
participants with all test results and follow-up data 
available. While this choice for analysis could potentially 
lead to selection bias, a sensitivity analysis that included 
data from participants with incomplete test results gave 
similar results. We assessed exposure, outcome, and 
covariates using the same standards for all participants, 
minimising the chance of information bias and enhancing 
data completeness. We used manufacturer-defined 
methods for both IGRAs, and the TSTs were administered 
by trained research nurses. We used multiple approaches 
to identify participants who progressed to active 
tuberculosis, maximising ascertainment of the outcome. 
Prevalent cases (active tuberculosis at baseline) were 
excluded to increase the probability that detected cases 
reflected progression from latent infection. When possible, 
we used MIRU-VNTR data to assess whether progression 
among contacts was most likely due to transmission from 
the index case; 13 (93%) of 14 identified case-contact pairs 
were consistent with transmission having occurred.
Our study has some limitations. Although follow-up 
within the UK was rigorous, cases of tuberculosis in 
participants who left the UK during the study period or 
follow-up might not have been identified. We were also 
unable 
to 
examine 
long-term 
progression 
risk. 
Incorporation bias can arise when the study of immune-
based results influences the diagnosis of active tuberculosis 
(eg, if the IGRA result influences the clinician’s 
investigation for tuberculosis, then those classified as 
having active tuberculosis would be more likely to have 
been from the IGRA-positive group, consequently 
favouring IGRAs for prediction of disease). However, most 
participants were recruited at sites that did not use IGRA 
results from the study in patient management (in the UK 
at the time of the study, latent tuberculosis infection 
screening was standard practice only for people who had 
been in contact with active tuberculosis and were younger 
than 35 years), which would minimise this effect. Notably, 
this incorporation bias similarly applies to TST, which is 
more difficult to mask. A further limitation of our study is 
the self-reported nature of data on comorbidities, 
particularly HIV. The small number of participants on 
treatment for latent tuberculosis infection and with self-
reported HIV infection prevented us from doing our 
intended subgroup analysis.
Our results have implications for guidelines and future 
cost-effectiveness analyses, particularly in the screening of 
tuberculosis contacts for latent tuberculosis infection and 
also recent migrants (ie, in the past 5 years) from high-
burden countries. Although negative predictive values 
were similar for all tests, we have found statistically 
significant differences for the positive prediction of 
progression to active tuberculosis between tests, with a 
positive TST-5 result being a significantly worse predictor 
than all other tests, and a positive T-SPOT.TB result being 
a significantly better predictor than all other tests, except 
for TST-15, and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube was 
significantly better than TST-10. Although the review of the 
WHO guidelines15,16 did not examine TST stratified by 
BCG-vaccination status compared with IGRAs, we show 
for the first time, to our knowledge, that by use of this 
stratification method, TST is equivalent to IGRAs. The 
most recent WHO guidelines16 recommend either a TST 
or IGRA as equivalent alternatives without taking into 
account previous BCG vaccination. Our results contradict 
this recommendation. The screening strategy by which 
participants are identified for treatment influences the 
cost-effectiveness of any test-and-treat programme; the 
more people who are identified as positive and eligible for 
treatment, the greater the cost.25 The trade-offs of testing 
with TST-5 (which identified the most progressors but 
with potentially the highest number needed to treat) versus 
IGRAs and TST-15 (which are likely to have the lowest 
numbers needed to treat) has implications for WHO 
guidelines depending on the uptake of testing and 
adherence to management in different settings. In the 
absence of a highly specific diagnostic test for latent 
tuberculosis infection at risk of progression, a cheap and 
non-toxic treatment is needed that can be given to a larger 
proportion of screened people than is the case with current 
treatment options.
A new version of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube26 has 
been developed subsequent to the end of the study period 
that could have greater sensitivity for detecting latent 
tuberculosis infection; assessment of its ability to predict 
progression to active tuberculosis will be important in 
future studies. Although other new assays, such as 
transcriptional profiling, could improve the detection of 
incipient tuberculosis,27 the increase in positive predictive 
value of these tests compared with IGRAs appears small 
because of low specificity.28 Better use of existing assays 
remains crucial until a more specific and highly predictive 
commercial test is developed.
In conclusion, our data provide evidence that TST 
stratified by BCG-vaccination status yields similar 
predictive values to the two commonly used IGRAs. 
IGRA or TST-15 strategies gave a high proportion of 
negative test results, with low progression among these 
individuals, and correctly identified a high risk of 
progression in participants who had positive test results, 
supporting their use in screening programmes. TST-5 
will identify most individuals who will benefit from 
treatment in high-risk groups at the cost of increasing the 
number of patients classified as more likely to progress to 
tuberculosis. Country-specific cost-effectiveness analyses, 
stratification of progression risk in sub-populations, and
