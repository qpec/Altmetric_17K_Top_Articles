Estimating the number of regular and dependent
methamphetamine users in Australia, 2002e2014
D
uring 2015, reports of prob-
lems arising from the use of the
crystalline form of metham-
phetamine known as “ice” or “crys-
tal” have attracted increased media,
community and policy attention in
Australia.1,2 There were substantially
more seizures of methamphetamine
at the border during this time,3
and the media reported these de-
velopments in terms of an “epidemic”
of
methamphetamine
use.
Re-
searchers and law enforcement offi-
cials have disagreed about whether its
use has increased; household survey
data on the prevalence of use in the
past year and surveys of drug users
have been interpreted as showing that
methamphetamine use has, in fact,
been stable.4,5
We need credible estimates of the
number of regular and dependent
methamphetamine users in Australia.
It is these patterns of use that are of
greatest concern from both the public
healthandpublicorderpointsofview.
These groups include the users most
likely to experience harms such as
psychoses and serious medical prob-
lems that require hospital treatment.
People who use illicit drugs heavily
are not well captured in household
surveys, in which less frequent use is
typically reported; in the most recent
national
household
survey,
for
instance, 48% of those who had used
methamphetamine in the past year
in Australia had used it only once.6
Our study assessed the current extent
of
problematic
methamphetamine
use
in
Australia
by
estimating
the numbers of regular and depen-
dent
methamphetamine
users
in
Australia. We used indirect preva-
lence estimation methods that have
been widely applied in illicit drug
epidemiology to estimate the size of
more hidden and stigmatised groups
of illicit drug users.7-10 Specifically,
we aimed to generate:
�
annual estimates of the numbers
of
users
and
of
population
rates of regular and dependent
methamphetamine use for the
period 2002e2014; and
�
age-specific
estimates
of
the
numbers of users and of popula-
tion rates of regular methamphet-
amine use and methamphetamine
dependence over the same period.
Methods
We estimated the sizes of two pop-
ulations of methamphetamine users
in Australia:
�
the
number
of
regular
users:
those who used the drug at least
once a month during the past
year;
�
the number of dependent meth-
amphetamine users: those who
have impaired control of their
use, and who continue to use the
drug despite the health and other
adverse consequences that they
might be experiencing (as defined
in the World Health Organiza-
tion’s International Classification
of Diseases [ICD]).
It is important to note that these two
populations
of
methamphetamine
consumers overlap (with dependent
users being a subgroup of those who
use the drug regularly). Estimates of
the sizes of these two populations of
users are therefore not additive (see
the section on multipliers below).
We applied indirect methods of esti-
mation.7,8 These methods draw on
different sources of data to indirectly
estimate the total number of drug
users.7 One indirect approach is the
multiplier
method;
for
example,
Abstract
Objective: To estimate the number of regular and dependent
methamphetamine users in Australia.
Design: Indirect prevalence estimates were made for each year from
2002e03 to 2013e14. We applied multiplier methods to data on treatment
episodes for amphetamines (eg, counselling, rehabilitation, detoxification)
and amphetamine-related hospitalisations to estimate the numbers of
regular (at least monthly) and dependent methamphetamine users for
each year. Dependent users comprised a subgroup of those who used the
drug regularly, so that estimates of the sizes of these two populations
were not additive.
Results: We estimated that during 2013e14 there were 268 000 regular
methamphetamine users (95% CI, 187 000e385 000) and 160 000
dependent users (95% CI, 110 000e232 000) aged 15e54 years in Australia.
This equated to population rates of 2.09% (95% CI, 1.45e3.00%) for
regular and 1.24% (95% CI, 0.85e1.81%) for dependent use. The rate of
dependent use had increased since 2009e10 (when the rate was estimated
to be 0.74%), and was higher than the previous peak (1.22% in 2006e07).
The highest rates were consistently among those aged 25e34 years, in
whom the rate of dependent use during 2012e2013 was estimated to be
1.50% (95% CI, 1.05e2.22%). There had also been an increase in the rate of
dependent use among those aged 15e24 years (in 2012e13 reaching 1.14%;
95% CI, 0.80e1.69%).
Conclusions: There have been increases over the past 12 years in the
numbers of regular and dependent methamphetamine users in Australia.
Our estimates suggest that the most recent numbers are the highest for this
period, and that the increase has been most marked among young adults
(those aged 15e34 years).
Implications: There is an increasing need for health services to engage
with people who have developed problems related to their
methamphetamine use.

 multiplying the number of people
who received drug treatment during
a particular year (an indicator or
benchmark for use) by an estimate of
the proportion of dependent drug
users who received treatment during
the year (the multiplier) to produce
an estimate of the total size of
the dependent drug-using popula-
tion. A worked example of an esti-
mate generated using the multiplier
method is presented in Box 1. These
methods have been widely applied
in research into illicit drug use to
estimate relatively hidden or stig-
matised patterns of illicit drug use.
Their
strengths
and
limitations
have
been
discussed
at
length
elsewhere.7,8
Following an extensive investigation
of the most robust multipliers that
could be used to estimate the number
of regular and dependent metham-
phetamine
users
in
Australia
in
2004 (see Appendix), multiple esti-
mates were made according to the
approach described by McKetin and
colleagues.11
Data sources
A
number
of
data
types
were
explored
as
potential
sources
of
benchmark data: hospital admissions
data, drug dependence treatment
data, arrest data, emergency depart-
ment admissions data, and ambu-
lance
service
data.
Of
these,
amphetamine dependence treatment
episodes and amphetamine-related
hospital separations were the only
data that enabled methamphetamine-
related cases to be clearly identified,
and were therefore the sole data we
used to generate estimates. The same
conclusion was drawn in a previous
Australian
investigation.11
Further
details on the selection of data sources
are presented in the online Appendix.
Analysis of benchmark data was
restricted to incidents in people aged
15e54 years, the same age range
covered by the data sources used to
calculate the multipliers.
Treatment episodes for amphet-
amine
use. We
obtained
data
on publicly and non-government-
funded specialised closed amphet-
amine treatment episodes, which are
compiled
by
the
National
Mini-
mum Data Set for Alcohol and Other
Drug Treatment Services (NMDS-
AODTS). We obtained data on epi-
sodes
in
which
the
main
drug
of concern was listed as “amphet-
amines”
(which
includes
amphet-
amine and methamphetamine).
This dataset does not include treat-
ment
episodes
undertaken
in
halfway
houses
and
sobering-up
shelters,
correctional
institutions,
health promotion services (eg, needle
and syringe exchange programs),
acute care and psychiatric hospitals
that only treat admitted patients, or
private treatment agencies that do
not
receive
government
funding.
Further details on the nature of the
data included in the NMDS-AODTS
are reported elsewhere.12
Hospital separations for amphet-
amine
use. Hospital
separations
included
those
for
a
primary
stimulant-related
diagnosis.
This
includedthediagnosesof“Mentaland
behavioural disorders due to use of
other stimulants, including caffeine”
(ICD-10 codes, F15.X) and “Poisoning
by psychotropic drugs, not elsewhere
classified — Psychostimulants with
potential for use disorder” (ICD-10
code, T43.6).
Multipliers. Ideally we would have
used multipliers compiled on an
annual basis, but major limitations
in each of the data sources we
investigated for deriving multipliers
prevented this, as discussed in the
Appendix.
Our
multipliers
were
therefore derived from a survey of
310 regular methamphetamine users
recruited from across Sydney during
2002e03 who used methamphet-
amine at least once a month during
the 6 months prior to the interview.11
They were recruited both through
advertisements and through outpa-
tient community health services to
avoid oversampling methamphet-
amine users in treatment or in hos-
pital. Multipliers were also adjusted
for the number of hospital and treat-
ment events per person during the
past year (that is, the annual rate of
events), and were restricted to those
events that would have been recor-
ded in the benchmark data sources
(Box 2).
An additional set of multipliers was
calculated for the subset of 166 par-
ticipants who were both regularly
using and dependent on metham-
phetamine during the past year.
Dependence was defined as having
a score of 4 or greater on the
Severity of Dependence Scale, which
corresponds to a Diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disor-
ders (DSM-III-R) diagnosis of severe
methamphetamine
dependence.13
Most dependent methamphetamine
users injected the drug (76%), and
were more likely to have a history of
heroin use than their non-dependent
counterparts (72% v 58%: odds ratio
[OR], 1.9; P ¼ 0.007).
Analyses
Multipliers
were
applied
to
the
benchmark data for each financial
year for which data were available
(2002e03 to 2013e14). As we used
two
sources
of
benchmark
data

and

1 Hypothetical example of the estimation of the number of dependent amphetamine users based on the
number of treatment episodes for amphetamine dependence
Benchmark data: the number of episodes across Australia in a given year for the treatment of amphetamine dependence.
Multiplier: the inverse of the proportion of users who are amphetamine-dependent and who received treatment in a given year.
In this hypothetical example, data suggest that 20 000 Australians received treatment for amphetamine dependence in a given
year. Surveys of dependent amphetamine users indicate that 10% received treatment in this year, giving a multiplier of 10.
The estimated total number of dependent amphetamine users is the product of the benchmark data and the multiplier;
ie, 20 000 � 10 ¼ 200 000 dependent users.

 separations), we obtained two esti-
mates of the numbers of regular and
dependent methamphetamine users
for each financial year. We pooled
these two estimates using fixed ef-
fects meta-analysis methods in Stata
13 (StataCorp).14 As the confidence
intervals
were
skewed,
we
log-
transformed the estimates and their
confidence intervals (CIs) for the
meta-analysis,
and
then
back-
transformed the estimates to obtain
summary results. Finally, we gener-
ated rates per 100 population from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics
estimates of the resident population
on 30 June for each year.
Ethics
Ethics approval for access to hospital
and treatment data to generate these
estimates was obtained under the
National Illicit Drug Indicators Proj-
ect (UNSW Human Research Ethics
Committee; reference, HC13081).
Results
The pooled estimates of the numbers
of regular and dependent metham-
phetamine users varied during the
study period, but were all higher in
the most recent years. It was esti-
mated that in 2013e14 there were
268 000 regular (at least monthly)
methamphetamine users (95% CI,
187 000e385 000),
and
160 000
dependent
users
(95%
CI,
110 000e232 000) aged 15e54 years
(Box 3). This equates to population
rates of 2.09% (95% CI, 1.45e3.00%)
for regular and 1.24% (95% CI,
0.85e1.81%)
for
dependent
use
(Appendix, Figure A1; Box 4). The
estimated rate in 2013e14 was higher
than in 2009e10, when the rate was
0.74%, and also higher than the pre-
vious peak, 1.22% in 2006e07. The
Appendix
presents
the
estimates
based on the individual data sources.
Estimates of the rates of regular and
dependent use varied with age and
over time (Box 5). The highest rates of
use were consistently among those
aged 25e34 years. In 2012e13, the
estimated rate of methamphetamine
dependence in this age group was
1.50% (95% CI, 1.05e2.22%). It is also
important to note the recent increase
in estimated dependent use among
those aged 15e24 years; in 2012e13
the
rate
was
estimated
to
be
1.14% (95% CI, 0.80e1.69%).

There was a clear increase in our es-
timates of the numbers of dependent

 and regular methamphetamine users
in Australia since 2010, with the
largest increases in the 25e34 and
15e24-year-old age groups.
Patterns of stimulant use often show
a rapid uptake among new users who
initially report extremely rewarding
effects that they advertise to their
peers, thereby recruiting further new
users. There is often a swift develop-
ment of problem use among heavy
users, whose doses escalate as toler-
ance develops; these problems typi-
cally
include
psychoses
and
dependence, and arrests for drug
possession and supply. The emer-
gence of these problems produces a
rapid decline in new recruits as the
high visibility of these harms be-
comes apparent to non-using peers.15
Recent surveys suggest that this phe-
nomenon has occurred in Australia.
Findings
from
the
internet-
administered Global Drug Survey
(http:/
/www.globaldrugsurvey.com)
suggest that methamphetamine may
have acquired a negative reputation
among older drug users, who report
lower use; the same may be true
amongregular ecstasy users surveyed
in Australian capital cities.16 A recent
analysis
of
Australian
household
surveys of drug use over the past
two decades further supports the
view
that
methamphetamine
use
has become increasingly stigmatised,
with
fewer
people
admitting
to
having used the drug, suggesting
that these surveys underestimate an
increasingly stigmatised form of sub-
stance use.17
Rapid uptake of methamphetamine
use may still be occurring outside the
largest cities, especially in regional
centres where young people without
prior experience
of methamphet-
amine may be exposed to it. The
available data, together with findings
reported in this article, suggest a
sharp increase in problematic meth-
amphetamine use among particular
subgroups
(particularly
young
people) in Australia. These problem
users require targeted and specific
policy and treatment responses.
Clinical implications
There is a need for both more health
services and better engagement with
and retention of clients in treatment
services.
There
are
no
effective
pharmacotherapy options for the
treatment
of
methamphetamine
dependence.18 Best practice in treat-
ment involves intensive application
of
structured
psychological
and
behavioural therapies, such as cogni-
tive behavioural therapies and con-
tingency management,19 but this is
not well translated into practice.20 For
more entrenched dependent users,
long-stay residential treatment op-
tions can produce positive short term

Research
 outcomes (compared with no treat-
ment),21 although high relapse rates
after one to three years indicate that
methamphetamine dependence can
become
chronic
and
relapsing.21
Ongoing engagement in treatment
and improved access to evidence-
based treatment options are essential
for improving the health of depen-
dent methamphetamine users.
Limitations
The use of multipliers from 2002e03
may
be
questioned
because
of
changes in the type of drug used and
the types of users, namely:
�
large increases in the purity of
crystal methamphetamine;
�
changes in the route of adminis-
tration (smoking has become the
predominant route used by newer
users, rather than injecting, the
primary route in 2002e03); and
�
recruitment of a new cohort of
younger users whose patterns of
use (primarily smoking) differs
from that of older injecting drug
users and regular stimulant users.
These changes may have increased
the rate of dependence among users,
and thus increased the proportion of
methamphetamine
users
who
become regular or dependent users.
Research suggests that crystal meth-
amphetamine users are nearly twice
as likely to develop dependence as
those using other forms of metham-
phetamine.22 The same seems to be
true of those who smoke rather than
snort or swallow the drug.23
What effects might these changes
have on the estimated number of
users?
For
example,
increased
smokingofcrystal methamphetamine
during
the
past
decade
among
people with no history of regular or
problematic
drug
use
may
have
increased the number of regular or
dependent smokers of crystal meth-
amphetamine who seek treatment. If
so, our treatment-based multiplier,
which was based on a sample of
methamphetamine users who had
high rates of injecting drug use and a
long history of polydrug use, may
overestimate
the
true
population
multiplier.
On the other hand, some treatment
services report that crystal metham-
phetamine smokers are less likely
to undergo treatment (unpublished
data from the Methamphetamine
Treatment Evaluation Study21). More
research is needed to examine this
question. If the proportion of meth-
amphetamine
users
who
smoke
crystal
methamphetamine
is
in-
creasing, then our multiplier for
treatment access, derived from a
sample of people who mostly inject
methamphetamine, may be too low.
If this is the case, we have under-
estimated the number of problem
methamphetamine users.
It might also be argued that multi-
pliers based on surveys of metham-
phetamine users in Sydney are not
representative
for
all
users
in
Australia. For example, treatment is
more available in major capital cities
than in regional or remote areas, or in
a smaller capital city. Our estimates
of the proportion of users who are
treated would then be higher in
Sydney than elsewhere, making the
multiplier smaller than it should be
for other areas. If, for example, 10% of
users in Sydney received treatment in
the past year, but only 5% did so in
rural centres, the Sydney multiplier
would be half what it would have
been in regional areas (10 in Sydney,
20 in other areas). This would mean
that our estimates are conservative
estimates of the national population
of regular or dependent metham-
phetamine users.
Finally, it is important to note that
there were no changes in the methods
or quality of data collection during
2009e10; the reduced numbers of
treatment and hospital episodes were
consistent with indicators of avail-
ability and harm related to amphet-
amines in that period.24
Conclusions
Our estimates suggest that there have
been substantial increases over the
past 5 years in the numbers of regular
and dependent methamphetamine
users in Australia. The estimated
levels of regular and dependent
methamphetamine
use
during
2012e13 are the highest for the
period examined. These increases
have
been
most
marked
among
young adults aged 15e34 years. The
increased number of problem meth-
amphetamine users indicates a need
to expand services to redress the
health
problems
associated
with
regular methamphetamine use.
