Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ST313 is a relatively newly
emerged sequence type that is causing a devastating epidemic of
bloodstream infections across sub-Saharan Africa. Analysis of hun-
dreds of Salmonella genomes has revealed that ST313 is closely re-
lated to the ST19 group of S. Typhimurium that cause gastroenteritis
across the world. The core genomes of ST313 and ST19 vary by only
∼1,000 SNPs. We hypothesized that the phenotypic differences that
distinguish African Salmonella from ST19 are caused by certain SNPs
that directly modulate the transcription of virulence genes. Here we
identified 3,597 transcriptional start sites of the ST313 strain D23580,
and searched for a gene-expression signature linked to pathogenesis
of Salmonella. We identified a SNP in the promoter of the pgtE gene
that caused high expression of the PgtE virulence factor in African
S. Typhimurium, increased the degradation of the factor B component
of human complement, contributed to serum resistance, and modu-
lated virulence in the chicken infection model. We propose that high
levels of PgtE expression by African S. Typhimurium ST313 promote
bacterial survival and dissemination during human infection. Our find-
ing of a functional role for an extragenic SNP shows that approaches
used to deduce the evolution of virulence in bacterial pathogens
should include a focus on noncoding regions of the genome.

T
he bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
(S. Typhimurium) is one of the best-understood pathogens and
a major cause of gastroenteritis globally. One sequence type of S.
Typhimurium, ST313, is the primary cause of invasive nontyphoidal
Salmonellosis (iNTS) across Africa, resulting in ∼388,000 deaths
each year (1). Coinfection with HIV or malaria infection and young
age (<5 y of age) are known risk factors for iNTS infection (1, 2).
Multidrug resistance has contributed to the expansion of
S. Typhimurium ST313. Whole-genome sequence-based phylo-
genetics revealed clonal replacement of ST313 lineage 1 by lineage
2 in the mid-2000s, accompanied by the acquisition of chloram-
phenicol resistance (3). The ST313 clade has recently acquired re-
sistance to ceftriaxone, a first-line antibiotic for multidrug-resistant
bacterial infections (4). Genomic comparison between the classical
gastroenteritis-associated S. Typhimurium ST19 and the Afri-
can ST313 isolates shows that gene content and synteny are
highly conserved, that ST313 has a distinct repertoire of plasmids
and prophages, and carries 77 pseudogenes reflecting a degree of
genome degradation (5, 6). ST313 and ST19 share >4,000 genes,
and their core genomes differ by ∼1,000 SNPs (5). We have re-
ported that 2.7% of the S. Typhimurium isolated from patients in
England and Wales are ST313, but lack the characteristic prophages
BTP1 and BTP5 that are signatures of African ST313 lineages (7).
Certain virulence-associated phenotypes have been examined in
ST313 strains. Compared with the ST19 group of gastroenteritis-
associated S. Typhimurium, ST313 is more resistant to complement-
mediated killing by human sera (8, 9) and to macrophage-mediated
killing (10). ST313 exhibits a stealth phenotype during macrophage
infection, consistent with an immune evasion strategy that causes
reduced levels of IL-1β cytokine production, apoptosis, and caspase-
1–dependent macrophage death (10, 11). Strategies used by ST313
to evade the innate immune system include reduced expression of
both FliC and the SPI1 effector protein SopE2 (11). Furthermore,
ST313 does not express the SseI effector protein due to pseudoge-
nisation of the sseI gene, allowing ST313 to cause increased systemic
infection via dendritic cell-mediated dissemination to extraintestinal
sites in the murine infection model (12).
We used a functional genomic approach to search for SNPs
responsible for the increased virulence of S. Typhimurium ST313
lineage 2.
Results
The reference strain for S. Typhimurium ST313 lineage 2 is
D23580, which was isolated from an HIV− Malawian child (5).
Significance
Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease is a major and pre-
viously neglected tropical disease responsible for an estimated
∼390,000 deaths per year in Africa, largely caused by a variant
of Salmonella Typhimurium called ST313. Despite the avail-
ability of >100,000 Salmonella genomes, it has proven chal-
lenging to associate individual SNPs with pathogenic traits
of this dangerous bacterium. Here, we used a transcriptomic
strategy to identify a single-nucleotide change in a promoter
region responsible for crucial phenotypic differences of African
S. Typhimurium. Our findings show that a noncoding nucleo-
tide of the bacterial genome can have a profound effect upon
the pathogenesis of infectious disease.

 The strain 4/74 was isolated from a calf in the United Kingdom
and is a well-characterized representative of S. Typhimurium
ST19. Our challenge was to identify which, if any, of the >1,000
SNPs that separate strains D23580 and 4/74 serve to differ-
entiate the strains in terms of gene expression and phenotype.
We investigated whether the emergence of the epidemic clade

 of S. Typhimurium ST313 was linked to the altered expression of a
core genome-encoded virulence factor. Rather than focusing on a
comparison of the core genome, we used comparative transcriptomics
to identify transcripts that were both expressed at different levels and
associated with a distinct SNP in the promoter region.
This study built upon the primary transcriptome of S. Typhimurium
ST19 strain 4/74, which we determined using a combination of
RNA-seq and differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) under infection-
relevant growth conditions (13, 14). By working at the single-
nucleotide level, we defined transcriptional start sites (TSS), and
cataloged the transcripts expressed in the bacterial cell (15, 16).
Here, we used the same approach to define the primary tran-
scriptome and to identify the TSS of D23580, a representative
strain of African S. Typhimurium ST313. RNA was isolated from
in vitro growth conditions that reflect the extracellular and intra-
cellular stages of infection, namely the early stationary phase (ESP)
and the SPI2-inducing condition (InSPI2) (Materials and Methods).
To find all relevant TSS, a pooled sample containing RNA from
16 environmental conditions was also analyzed (14) (Materials and
Methods). TSS were identified by comparison of mapped sequence
reads from each pair of dRNA-seq and RNA-seq samples, as
described previously (13, 14, 16). We identified 3,597 TSS for S.
Typhimurium strain D23580, revealing the active gene promoters
across the genome of an ST313 isolate for the first time. Previously,
we reported the locations of 3,838 TSS for the ST19 strain 4/74 (13).
Categorization of the TSS into different classes showed that a similar
proportion of transcription initiation sites of 4/74 and D23580 were
designated as primary (61%) or antisense (11%) (Fig. 1A).
We determined the level of conservation of transcriptional orga-
nization between D23580 and 4/74 by identifying the TSS shared
between the two strains. The locations of the majority of the TSS
defined for strain 4/74 were conserved in strain D23580. Specifically,
of the 3,838 TSS of strain 4/74, 390 were absent from D23580 and
included TSS located in 4/74-specific regions such as prophages
sopEΦ and Gifsy-1 (Dataset S1, tab g). We identified 63 D23580-
specific TSS, mainly located in the BTP1 and BTP5 prophages of
D23580, which are absent from strain 4/74 (5, 6) (Dataset S1, tab d).
To benchmark the transcriptional architecture, we first fo-
cused on Salmonella pathogenicity islands SPI1 and SPI2, which
are required for key aspects of Salmonella virulence (17). The
locations of all TSS within the SPI1 and SPI2 islands were
identical in strains D23580 and 4/74 (Fig. 1B and Dataset S1, tab
c). In summary, two closely related S. Typhimurium strains that
varied by 1,488 SNPs at the core genome level had a high level of
conservation at the transcriptional level and shared 90% of
promoter regions (Dataset S1, tab a).
To address our hypothesis that the level of expression of certain
virulence genes varied between strains D23580 and 4/74 due to
changes at the DNA sequence level, we cross-referenced the SNP
differences between the two strains with the locations of the TSS
(Datasets S1 and S2). We identified 19 TSS that were associated
with nucleotide polymorphisms in the −40 to −1 region of the
2,211 primary TSS of D23580 (Dataset S3). We compared the
expression level of each TSS between 4/74 and D23580, in two
growth conditions, to identify the promoter SNPs responsible for
transcriptional changes. No SNPs were identified in the vicinity of
the −10 or −35 elements of the fliC or sopE2 gene promoters,
indicating that the reported differential expression of FliC and
SopE2 between ST313 and ST19 (11) is not caused by alterations
to the promoter sequence (Datasets S1–S3). We found one SNP at
the −12 position of the pgtE TSS, which was associated with an
average 11-fold increase in TSS expression in D23580 compared
with 4/74 (Dataset S3), and we investigated this experimentally.
Identification of a Nucleotide That Modulates Expression of the PgtE
Virulence Factor. PgtE is an outer membrane protease that be-
longs to the Omptin family of Gram-negative bacteria (18),
cleaves and mediates resistance to α-helical antimicrobial pep-
tides, and disrupts the human complement cascade by degrading
complement components, such as factor B (19, 20). PgtE does
not contribute to intramacrophage replication per se, but stim-
ulates bacterial dissemination during murine infection (21) by
facilitating extracellular survival upon release from host cells
(22–25). Expression of the pgtE transcript is induced during intra-
macrophage replication (26, 27), controlled by the SPI2-associated
regulators PhoPQ and SlyA (19, 28), and is activated by OmpR/
EnvZ and SsrA/B (15).
The promoter and coding regions of the pgtE gene were
compared between D23580 and 4/74 at the DNA sequence level,
and differed by two SNPs. One SNP was identified in the coding
region of pgtE at nucleotide location 2,530,498 in D23580
(2,504,548 in 4/74), generating a synonymous mutation [T54
(ACT) in 4/74 → T54 (ACC) in D23580]. The other SNP was
located in the promoter region; the −12 nucleotide (relative to
the +1 of the TSS) was C in 4/74 (C4/74) and T in D23580
(TD23580) (Fig. 1C). This T nucleotide in the −10 motif is a highly
conserved element of highly expressed σ70-dependent promoters
(14). We analyzed the functional role of TD23580 in the pgtE
promoter region experimentally by replacing the TD23580 nucleotide
with C4/74 by single-nucleotide exchange mutagenesis to generate
strain D23580 PpgtE
4/74. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that
the D23580 PpgtE
4/74 strain only contained the intended single-
nucleotide difference.
To determine the biological role of the TD23580 nucleotide, we
assayed the level of pgtE transcription in 4/74, D23580, D23580
PpgtE
4/74, and D23580 ΔpgtE strains using qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A).
The high level of pgtE expression in D23580 was reduced 10-fold
by the introduction of the single C4/74 nucleotide in the −10 re-
gion of the pgtE promoter, P < 0.01 (Fig. 2A). The level of the
pgtE transcript expression in 4/74 and the D23580 PpgtE
4/74 SNP
mutant was similar.
We hypothesized that the high level of pgtE transcription would
increase PgtE protein production in D23580 compared with wild-
type strain 4/74, and this was observed (Fig. 2B). A second lineage
2 isolate, D37712, expressed the same high level of PgtE. In
contrast, low levels of PgtE were produced by the ST313 lineage
1 isolates A130 and D25248, and ST19 isolates 14028 and LT2
(Fig. 2B). The enhanced production of PgtE by D23580 was re-
duced to the level of the 4/74 strain by a single-nucleotide change
in strain D23580 PpgtE
4/74. To determine whether the TD23580 SNP
would have a reciprocal effect in the S. Typhimurium ST19 genetic
background, we introduced the T nucleotide to the −10 promoter
motif of pgtE on the chromosome of strain 4/74 (Materials and
Methods). The strain 4/74 PpgtE
D23580 produced increased levels of
PgtE protein (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our data show that in
D23580, the high-level expression of pgtE at the transcriptional and
protein level is driven by the TD23580 nucleotide in the −10 region of
the pgtE promoter.
The TD23580 SNP Increases Resistance to Human Serum Killing,
Modulates Cleavage of Complement Factor B, and Interferes with
Complement Deposition. To determine the impact of the increased
PgtE activity mediated by the promoter TD23580 SNP upon extra-
cellular survival, we undertook serum bactericidal assays. Several
bacterial factors contribute to the serum-resistance phenotype of
Salmonella, including the long heterogenic O-antigen side chains of
smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is the outermost compo-
nent of the cell envelope of the Gram-negative cell (29–31).
Therefore, we assayed resistance to human serum killing of in
vitro-grown S. Typhimurium that lacked the LPS biosynthetic α1,3-
glucosyltransferase enzyme WaaG. Following treatment with
healthy human sera, the level of survival of D23580 ΔwaaG was
significantly higher than D23580 ΔwaaG PpgtE
4/74 (P ≤ 0.05) (Fig.
3A). No killing was observed following treatment with heat-
inactivated sera that lacked active complement, proving that the
observed bactericidal activity was complement-mediated. In

 summary, the promoter TD23580 SNP increases the resistance of
D23580 to serum killing, and the low level of pgtE expression
driven by the PpgtE
4/74 promoter does not.
To confirm the phenotypic role of the TD23580 SNP in wild-type
S. Typhimurium D23580, we determined levels of complement
deposition by flow cytometry. Following incubation with human
sera, lower levels of complement component 3b (C3b) were found
bound to the surface of wild-type D23580 than D23580 PpgtE
4/74
bacteria (Fig. 3B). Human serum killing of S. Typhimurium is
mediated by activation of the classic complement pathway by the
binding of specific IgG or IgM antibodies, followed by deposition
of membrane attack complexes on the bacterial surface (32–34).
We deduce that the TD23580 nucleotide carried by wild-type
D23580 reduces the level of binding of C3b, and explains the in-
creased resistance of D23580 ΔwaaG to serum-mediated killing
described above.
As described above, moving the TD23580 SNP into strain 4/74 caused
increased PgtE protein production (Fig. 2B). To investigate the
function of the TD23580 SNP in the S. Typhimurium ST19 genetic
background, we examined the role of the TD23580 SNP upon
complement deposition. The 4/74 wild-type bacteria had higher
surface-bound levels of C3b than 4/74 PpgtE
D23580 (Fig. 3C),
showing that increased expression of PgtE interferes with the
complement cascade in both S. Typhimurium ST19 and ST313.
PgtE disrupts the complement cascade by proteolytically
cleaving the C3b protein (35). The mechanism of the serum-
resistance phenotype was investigated by determining the abil-
ity of the S. Typhimurium strains to mediate PgtE-dependent
cleavage of complement factor B (Fig. 3D). In agreement with
the literature (36), no PgtE activity was detected in strains
expressing smooth LPS [Fig. 3D, lanes 1–3 (D23580), lanes 7–8
(4/74)]. Because the results of the serum-resistance assay showed
that short (rough) LPS was required to visualize PgtE activity, we
repeated experiments in a ΔwaaG background (Fig. 3D, lanes 4–6 and
9–10), and discovered that the D23580 ΔwaaG mutant showed a
high level of complement factor B cleavage. In contrast, 4/74
ΔwaaG and the D23580 ΔwaaG PpgtE
4/74 strains showed a low level
of complement factor B degradation.
We speculate that after the pathogen exits macrophages, the
high level of expression of PgtE in S. Typhimurium ST313 strain
D23580 interferes with opsonization and increases resistance to
complement-mediated serum killing.
Assessment of PgtE-Mediated Virulence in the Chicken Infection
Model. Because S. Typhimurium ST313 has a hyperinvasive
phenotype during chicken infection (37), this animal model was
used to assess the virulence of the wild-type D23580 and the
D23580 PpgtE
4/74 strains. Following oral infection, the D23580
PpgtE
4/74 SNP strain and the D23580 ΔpgtE strain showed sig-
nificant attenuation in splenic colonization in comparison with
D23580 wild-type (P = 0.0035 and P = 0.0379, respectively),
based on two independent repeats of the experiment (Fig. 3E).
The data show some bird-to-bird variation between all three
tested isolates, which is likely a consequence of the oral route of
infection and the use of a commercial outbred chicken line. We
found that the D23580 PpgtE
4/74 SNP strain, the D23580 ΔpgtE
strain, and the wild-type D23580 strain colonized liver and
cecum to similar levels (Fig. S1). Overall, the results showed that
Fig. 2.
The TD23580 SNP in the pgtE promoter of S. Typhimurium is associated with increased pgtE transcription and PgtE protein production. (A) The level of
pgtE transcript was measured by qRT-PCR and the relative gene expression, normalized to endogenous control hns, was calculated using the ddCt algorithm
(68) and is the average of three biological replicate experiments, with SEs. Significant differences were analyzed using an unpaired t test (*P < 0.01). (B)

The pgtE promoter TD23580 SNP mediates increased resistance to human serum killing, decreases complement component 3 deposition, enhances
cleavage of human complement factor B, and promotes virulence in the chicken infection model. (A) Sensitivity to pooled healthy human serum was assayed
in a ΔwaaG background (truncated LPS), to observe only the effect of outer membrane proteases. D23580 ΔwaaG showed significantly greater serum re-
sistance than D23580 PpgtE

 exchange of the TD23580 SNP to the C4/74 genotype resulted in lower
median bacterial numbers and a reduced number of animals
with splenic infection, equivalent to that seen in the absence of
PgtE (10 of 19 for D23580 compared with 2 of 19 for D23580 PpgtE
4/74
and 4 of 19 for D23580 ΔpgtE). We conclude that that the
TD23580 SNP promotes systemic infection of the chicken, and that
full virulence of D23580 requires the high level of expression of
PgtE that is driven by the TD23580 nucleotide.
The pgtE Promoter SNP Is Only Carried by African ST313 Lineage 2,
and Not Lineage 1. To determine if the pgtE promoter TD23580
SNP is a characteristic feature of iNTS, the pgtE promoter SNP
was analyzed in the context of a phylogeny of 258 genomes of
S. Typhimurium ST313 including isolates from Malawi, as well as
recently described UK-ST313 genomes from the UK (7). The
228 genomes that carried the TD23580 SNP formed a mono-
phyletic cluster that included lineage 2, as well as the UK-
ST313 strains that share most recent common ancestry with
lineage 2 (Fig. 4). The C4/74 SNP was found to be conserved in all
27 lineage 1 genomes analyzed and certain UK-ST313 genomes
which shared more recent common ancestry with lineage 1. This
suggests that the TD23580 SNP first arose in a common ancestor
of lineage 2 and a subset of the UK-ST313 (Fig. S2).
The pgtE Promoter Is Highly Conserved in S. enterica. To understand
the wider distribution of the pgtE promoter SNP in the Salmo-
nella genus, the conservation of the SNP was assessed in 83
published complete genomes representing the known genomic
diversity of Salmonella. The pgtE promoter sequence was not
conserved in the three genomes of Salmonella bongori included
in the analysis (Dataset S4). Of 80 S. enterica genomes screened,
79 genomes carried the C4/74 genotype. The TD23580 SNP was
only found in Salmonella Gallinarum strain 287/91, raising the
possibility that the SNP has arisen independently in this serovar
(Fig. 4). Apart from the −12 SNP present in S. Typhimurium
ST313 and S. Gallinarum, the pgtE TSS −35 region was found to
be 100% conserved in 75 of 80 S. enterica genomes, with only
serovar Agona and subspecies Arizonae showing sequence di-
vergence (Dataset S4).
In summary, the −10 C4/74 → TD23580 allele of the D23580 pgtE
promoter causes an increase in transcription of the pgtE gene
and the production of high levels of PgtE protein in D23580. The
increased activity of PgtE in D23580 leads to increased resistance
to human serum killing, reduced complement deposition, and
enhanced degradation of complement factor B, which is required
for activation of the alternative complement pathway. Importantly,
the single SNP in the D23580 pgtE promoter drives the ability of

subspecies 1, the C nucleotide is present in 23 serovars, and a T nucleotide was identified in a single genome (S. Gallinarum isolate 287/91).

side of ST313, only 1 of 80 complete S. enterica genomes, that of S.
Gallinarum, carried the −12 TD23580 allele. S. Gallinarum is the
causal agent of fowl typhoid, suggesting a putative link between the
TD23580 SNP and the ability of S. enterica to cause systemic in-
fection (38). We have shown that the pgtE promoter SNP is a
signature of ST313 lineage 2, which clonally replaced ST313 line-
age 1 in the early 2000s (3). All isolates of ST313 lineage 2 that we
have analyzed carried the same TD23580 SNP in the −10 promoter
motif of pgtE.
Discussion
Previous studies have identified SNP mutations associated with
the host tropism of notorious pathogens such as Staphylococcus
aureus (39) and Campylobacter jejuni (40). However, these ex-
amples involved SNP mutations located within coding genes, and
functionally important SNP mutations have rarely been identi-
fied in intergenic regions of bacteria. As the expression of a gene
is dependent on the −10 and −35 recognition motifs of σ70-dependent
promoters (41), a single-nucleotide change can modulate pro-
moter function. Examples include the C → T transition in the −10
promoter motif of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis eis gene, which
increases eis expression to generate low-level resistance to Kana-
mycin (42). Similarly, a promoter SNP that affected expression of
Escherichia coli succinate transporter dctA evolved to increase the
utilization of citrate as a carbon source in one population of the
Long-Term Evolution Experiment (43).
Here, we have identified a single SNP responsible for high
levels of expression of the PgtE outer membrane protease that is
linked to the virulence of African S. Typhimurium ST313. Our
study has implications for bacterial genome-wide association
studies, which should clearly include a focus on noncoding regions
of the genome. The findings also emphasize the value of identi-
fying all gene promoters in bacterial pathogens, to allow nucleotide
differences to be correlated with the process of transcriptional
initiation.
It is known that S. Typhimurium bacteria produce high levels
of pgtE transcript inside host macrophages (26, 27), and that
PgtE protease activity is high in S. Typhimurium bacteria re-
leased from infected macrophages (22). The steric hindrance
caused by long O-antigen chains makes the modification of LPS
a prerequisite for optimal PgtE activity. Such remodeling occurs
during intramacrophage replication, resulting in shortening of
the oligosaccharide chains (22). Accordingly, we used rough
S. Typhimurium strains (ΔwaaG) that express short O-antigen
chains to determine that the pgtE TD23580 SNP contributes to the
resistance of ST313 D23580 to human serum killing.
PgtE is known to interfere with the complement cascade in
several ways, including the cleavage of factors B and C3b (35).
To demonstrate a role for the pgtE TD23580 SNP in wild-type
(smooth) bacterial strains, we show that after incubation with
healthy human serum, the pgtE TD23580 SNP caused decreased
C3b deposition on the Salmonella cell surface in both the
4/74 and D23580 backgrounds. We speculate that the pgtE TD23580
SNP primes intracellular bacteria for an extracellular lifestyle,
and aids the survival of complement-mediated attack by the in-
nate immune system.
The opsonic activity of complement has been shown to be
essential for phagocyte-mediated killing of Salmonella in the
blood of African people (44), and therefore our data are con-
sistent with the hypothesis that subversion of host innate im-
munity via interference with the complement cascade contributes
to the pathogenesis of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella in
Africa. Because other factors have been reported to enhance the
invasiveness of S. Typhimurium ST313 (11, 12, 45), our data sug-
gest that the adaption of African ST313 to a systemic lifestyle is
multifactorial. Clearly, further investigation into the interaction
between the nucleotide changes responsible for the pseudogeni-
sation of sseI and the pgtE promoter SNP is required to understand
which alteration drove the adaptation to invasive disease, and
which could represent “passenger” mutations.
We suggest that the high level of PgtE activity in D23580, to-
gether with the inactivated sseI effector gene (12) and the acqui-
sition of chloramphenicol resistance (3), has been key to the
success of S. Typhimurium ST313 lineage 2. This mechanism has a
parallel in the evolution of Yersinia pestis, a pathogen that ac-
quired the Pla Omptin protease, a PgtE homolog, at least 3,000 y
ago (46). The Pla protein allowed Y. pestis to transition from a
gastrointestinal to an extraintestinal lifestyle and cause plague
(47). Here, we propose that the increased PgtE protease ac-
tivity caused by the TD23580 SNP in the −10 motif of the pgtE
promoter was an important evolutionary event that primed the
emergence and clonal expansion of an epidemic S. Typhimurium
lineage.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions. S. Typhimurium strain 4/74 (accession
no. CP002487), a representative strain of nontyphoidal Salmonella sequence
type 19, and D23580 (accession no. FN424405), a representative strain of
nontyphoidal Salmonella sequence type 313 (ST313) were used in the study.
Strain D23580 was isolated from an HIV− child from Malawi with blood
stream infection, and use of this strain has been approved by the Malawian
College of Medicine (COMREC ethics no. P.08/14/1614). Other wild-type
strains belonging to ST19 and ST313 used in this study are listed in Table S1.
All environmental growth conditions were repeated exactly as previously
described (13), with the exception that the “pool” sample was obtained by
pooling RNA from 16 environmental conditions: early exponential phase
(EEP), mid exponential phase (MEP), late exponential phase (LEP), ESP, late
stationary phase (LSP), 25 °C, NaCl shock, bile shock, low Fe2+ shock, an-
aerobic shock, anaerobic growth, oxygen shock, non-SPI2, InSPI2, peroxide
shock (InSPI2), and nitric oxide shock (InSPI2) (13).
When required, Lennox broth (LB) was supplemented with the following
antibiotics: chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 μg/mL, kanamycin (Km) 50 μg/mL, tet-
racycline (Tc) 20 μg/mL, and gentamicin (Gm) 20 μg/mL.
Preparation of cDNA Libraries and Illumina Sequencing. Before RNA-seq, total
RNA was extracted using TRIzol, and treated with DNase I, as described
previously (14). RNA integrity was inspected visually with the Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies). Contaminating DNA was removed using DNase I
(Ambion) and RNA samples were not ribo-depleted before cDNA library
construction. cDNA library construction, TEX-treatment for dRNA-seq (ESP,
InSPI2, and pooled sample), and RNA-seq with the Illumina HiSeq platform
was carried out by Vertis Biotechnologie, Germany. All protocols were
identical to those used previously (13, 14). Sequence reads were mapped
against the S. Typhimurium D23580 reference genome using Segemehl, with
accuracy set to 100% (48, 49). RNA-seq and dRNA-seq data can be down-
loaded as raw reads (.fastq file format); the Gene Expression Omnibus data-
base accession no. is GSE108104.
Identification of TSS by a Combination of RNA-Seq and dRNA-Seq. Methods
used to assign TSS in D23580 have been described previously (14). Briefly, a
TSS was assigned when it was enriched in one of the dRNA-seq libraries (ESP,
InSPI2, or Pool) compared with the corresponding RNA-seq library, and was
linked to an expressed transcript. This analysis was followed by a second step
of validation, in which the transcripts per million approach (50, 51) was used
to calculate an expression value for the first 10 nucleotides associated with
each TSS, designated the promoter usage value (PUV) (14, 27). A TSS was
considered to be expressed when the PUV was ≥10. A TSS was defined as
“conserved” between D23580 and 4/74 if the TSS nucleotide sequence was
present in both strains, and the PUV value of the TSS was ≥10.
Identification of TSS-Located SNP Mutations Associated with Different Levels
of Transcript Expression in D23580 and 4/74. A list of SNP differences between
the D23580 and 4/74 reference genomes (accession nos. FN424405 and CP002487)
was generated using NUCmer (52) resulting in 1,488 SNPs and small indels
(Dataset S2). We identified the SNPs located within the −40 to −1 region of
primary TSSs in D23580 (primary = primary + primary/as + primary/internal)
(Datasets S1 and S3). PUV values for each promoter in D23580 and 4/74 (14)
were used to analyze the activity of the promoters associated with SNP dif-
ferences in the −40 to −1 TSS region.

 Bacterial Strain Construction Using λ Red Recombineering. All of the bacterial
strains and plasmids used and constructed in this study are described in Table
S1 and the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides (primers) in
Table S2.
The ΔpgtE, ΔwaaG and pgtE-FLAG mutations were constructed in
S. Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 strains using the standard λ red re-
combination methodology (53). The heat-inducible λ red recombineering
plasmid pSIM5-tet was used and the induction of the λ red operon was
achieved by heat treatment (42 °C, 15 min) of bacterial cultures grown to
midexponential phase (OD600 0.3–0.4 at 30 °C) in LB supplemented with Tc
(53–55). After recombination (53–55), all of the genetic constructs (except
the ΔwaaG::Kan mutation) were transferred into a clean wild-type back-
ground by phage transduction, using the P22 HT 105/1 int-201 (56), as pre-
viously described (6). When required, the antibiotic resistance cassettes were
flipped-out using the FLP recombinase expression plasmid pCP20-TcR (57).
The pgtE gene was deleted in S. Typhimurium using PCR fragments gen-
erated with the primers DH95 and DH96 and the template plasmids pKD4 and
pKD3. The resulting fragments, carrying, respectively, the Km resistance (Kan)
or the Cm resistance (Cam) cassettes were, respectively, electroporated into
D23580 and 4/74 carrying pSIM5-tet and recombinant ΔpgtE::Kan/Cam mu-
tants were selected on Km or Cm LB agar plates. Finally, the mutations were
transduced in the corresponding wild-type strain and the resistance cassette
was removed, as described above. Similarly, waaG was inactivated using the
primers del_waaG_F and del_waaG_R and pKD4 as template.
The FLAG-tagged strains were generated using a forward primer (DH93),
which included the region homologous to pgtE end (′pgtE), the nucleotide
sequence encoding the FLAG octa-peptide in frame with the pgtE coding re-
gion, the pgtE stop codon, and a region homologous to the resistance cassette
(58). The ′pgtE-FLAG-Kan and ′pgtE-FLAG-Cam modules were amplified by PCR
using, respectively, pKD4 and pKD3 and primers DH93/DH94. The resulting
amplicons were, respectively, electroporated into S. Typhimurium ST313 (ex-
cept A130) or ST19 (and A130) strains, carrying all pSIM5-tet, and recombi-
nants were selected on Km or Cm LB agar plates. The insertions were then
transduced into the corresponding wild-type strains and the resistance cas-
settes were removed, as described above.
Construction of Scarless Single-Nucleotide Substitution Mutants. Two different
methods were used to construct single-nucleotide mutants. The single-
nucleotide T → C substitution in the pgtE promoter of S. Typhimurium
D23580 was constructed using a ssDNA recombineering approach, as has been
previously described (59). The protocol was identical to that used for con-
struction of mutants using λ red recombineering (described above), except
that 400 ng of the manufactured primer (DH90, HPLC purified) was used in the
transformation reaction. After 2 h of recovery at 30 °C, dilutions of trans-
formation were plated on LB agar (without selection). Clones were restreaked
and screened by a stringent PCR with primers DH40 and DH41. Primer
DH40 has full complementarity with the sought after mutant, representing
one mismatch to the original strain (these two types could be distinguished
using a stringent annealing temperature), while DH41 has full complemen-
tarity with both types of clone. The correct allele of the D23580 PpgtE
4/74 strain
was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing using Illumina technology
(MicrobesNG, University of Birmingham). Variant-calling analysis confirmed
that the D23580 PpgtE
4/74 strain had the intended single-nucleotide difference
compared with the wild-type strain.
The single-nucleotide C → T substitution in the pgtE promoter of
S. Typhimurium 4/74 (chromosomal position 2504765) (4/74 PpgtE
D23580) was
carried out by a scarless genome-editing technique based on the pEMG
suicide plasmid, as previously described (6, 60). The pEMG derivative
pNAW41 that carries the pgtE promoter region with the specific substitution
was constructed as follows: the regions flanking the targeted nucleotide
were PCR-amplified with the primers pairs NW_122/NW_123 and NW_124/
NW_125, using 4/74 genomic DNA as template. The primers NW_123 and
NW_124 encode for C → T substitution and are complementary to each
other over a stretch of 20 nucleotides. The resulting PCR fragments (504 and
505 bp, respectively) were fused by overlap extension PCR and the resulting
989-bp fragment was digested and cloned into pEMG using the BamHI and
EcoRI restriction sites. The pNAW41 suicide plasmid was mobilized from
E. coli S17-1 λpir into S. Typhimurium 4/74 by conjugation and trans-
conjugants that have integrated pNAW41 by homologous recombination
were selected on minimal medium M9 agar supplemented with 0.2%
of glucose and Km. The resulting merodiploids were resolved using the
pSW-2 plasmid as previously described (6) and the C → T substitution was
confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing, using the primers NW_155
and NW_156.
qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from bacteria from midexponential
(OD600 = 0.3) cultures of bacteria grown in PCN/InSPI2, DNase-treated with
Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion) and the RNA integrity was inspected visually
using the Bioanalyzer. Complete DNA-removal was confirmed by a negative
PCR with 40 cycles. Four-hundred nanograms of RNA were converted into
cDNA using the GoScript Reverse Transcription System (Promega), with
random primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Sensifast
SYBR Hi_ROX Kit (Bioline) was used for qRT-PCR with primer pairs DH54/
DH55 and qPCR_hns_f/qPCR_hns_r. For each qRT-PCR, performed in dupli-
cate, 26.66 ng cDNA was used in total reaction volumes of 20 μL. The amount
of pgtE and hns mRNA was calculated using a standard curve based on
10-fold dilutions of genomic DNA (10–0.0001 ng/μL), included in each qRT-
PCR run. The amount of pgtE mRNA was normalized to the amount of
hns mRNA.
Western Blot Analysis. Salmonella strains carrying the FLAG-tagged version of
pgtE were grown in PCN/InSPI2 medium to OD600 = 0.3. Bacteria were har-
vested from 10 mL of culture by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells
were washed once with PBS and suspended in 67.5 μL of the same buffer.
Seventy-five microliters of Laemmli buffer 2× [120 mM Tris·HCl pH 6.8,
4% (wt/vol) SDS, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, Bromophenol blue 0.02% (wt/vol)]
and 7.5 μL β-mercaptoethanol were subsequently added to the samples. The
extracts were boiled for 10 min, chilled on ice, and cell debris was pelleted by
centrifugation (20,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Fifteen microliters of the samples
(supernatant) were loaded on a SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel and proteins
were separated for 80 min at 150 V in SDS/PAGE running buffer (25 mM Tris,
192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS). Proteins were transferred onto a methanol-
soaked PVDF membrane (Cat. No. 3 010 040; Roche) using a semiwet
transfer system (#170–3940; Bio-Rad) for 2 h, 125 mA at 4 °C in transfer
buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine). The membrane was blocked for 15 h at
4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 10 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl) sup-
plemented with 5% (wt/vol) of dry skimmed milk. Incubation with the an-
tibodies (1 h at room temperature) and washing steps (two washes for
15 min each) were done in TBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 and
0.5% (wt/vol) dry skimmed milk. The primary antibodies, monoclonal anti-
FLAG M2 antibody (1:3,000 diluted, Sigma-Aldrich F3165) and anti-DnaK
mAb 8E2/2 (1:10,000 diluted, ADI-SPA-880; Enzo Life Sciences), were used
for the detection of PgtE-FLAG and DnaK (loading control), respectively.
After incubation with the primary antibodies, the membrane was washed
and incubated with the secondary antibody [goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L)-
HRP, 1:2,500 diluted, # 172–1011; Bio-Rad]. After washes, the membrane was
rinsed briefly in TBS before addition of Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate
(32109; Thermo Scientific) and the chemiluminescence reaction was mea-
sured using the Image Quant LAS 4000 imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Complement Factor B Cleavage Assay. The complement factor B cleavage
assay was carried out as described previously (20), with the following mod-
ifications. Bacterial strains were grown overnight in LB at 37 °C. Overnight
culture was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS. Two OD600
(in 200 μL PBS containing 33 ng/μL of complement factor B) were incubated
at 37 °C in a heat block with agitation (700 rpm) for 2 h and subsequently
pelleted by centrifugation. Sixty-six nanograms of complement factor B were
separated on an SDS/PAGE, before Western blotting, as described above.
Serum Bactericidal Assays. Serum bactericidal assays were performed four
times using a modification of the previously described method (61). Briefly,
bacteria were grown to OD600 = 2 in 5 mL of LB at 37 °C and resuspended in
PBS to a final concentration of 107 CFU/mL; 10 μL was then mixed with 90 μL
of undiluted pooled healthy human sera at 37 °C with shaking (180 rpm),
and viable counts determined. Killing was confirmed to be due to the ac-
tivity of complement by using 56 °C heat-inactivated sera as a control.
Complement Deposition Assays. Detection of C3 complement component
deposition was done as previously described (32–34). In brief, overnight
cultures of S. Typhimurium were grown to an OD600 of 2. Cells were washed
twice with PBS and 5 μL of S. Typhimurium at 2 × 109 CFU/mL was mixed with
45 μL healthy human sera or PBS at room temperature for 5 min (D23580
strains) or 10 min (4/74 strains). Cells were then washed twice with 1 mL of
PBS by 5 min centrifugation at 3,300 × g, and incubated with anti-human
C3c FITC-conjugated antibody (Thermo Scientific) for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples
were washed twice and fixed with 200 μL of 1% formaldehyde-PBS. Cells
were acquired on a BD FACSAria and analyzed with FlowJo v10.4. Three
to five replicate assays were conducted for each strain background and
the average geometric mean fluorescence intensity for replicates is shown,

 along with the SD. An unpaired, single-tailed t test was used to assess the
statistical significance of strain differences.
Chicken Infection Experiments. All work was conducted in accordance with
United Kingdom legislation governing experimental animals under project
license PPL 40/3652 and was approved by the University of Liverpool ethical
review process before the award of the license. All birds were checked a
minimum of twice daily to ensure their health and welfare. Birds were housed
in accommodation meeting United Kingdom legislation requirements. One-
day-old Lohmann Brown Layers were obtained from a commercial hatchery,
separated into groups on arrival, and given ad libitum access to water and a
laboratory-grade vegetable protein-based pellet diet (SDS). Chicks were
housed at a temperature of 30 °C. At 7 d of age, chickens were inoculated by
oral gavage with 108 CFU of S. Typhimurium strains D23580, D23580 PpgtE
4/74, or
D23580 ΔpgtE. At 3 d postinfection, 10 birds from each group were killed for
postmortem analysis. Samples from spleen, liver, and the caecal contents
were removed aseptically from each bird and diluted 1:5 (wt/vol.) in sterile
PBS (data from caecal content and liver are shown in Fig. S1). Tissues were
then homogenized in a Colworth 80 microstomacher (A.J. Seward & Co. Ltd).
Samples were serially diluted and dispensed onto Brilliant green agar
(Oxoid) to quantify numbers of Salmonella, as described previously (62). A
Mann–Whitney test was used to determine the statistical significance of
strain differences.
Analysis of the Conservation of the pgtE Promoter SNP. For analysis of the
conservation of the pgtE promoter SNP, 258 genomes of S. Typhimurium
ST313 isolates from Malawi and the United Kingdom (7) were assembled
using the A5 pipeline (63) and Abacus (64), unless reference quality genomes
were available (all strains and accession numbers are given in Dataset S4).
Additionally, 83 reference genomes were downloaded from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information that represent the known diversity of
the Salmonella genus. Core genome SNPs were identified using the PanSeq
package (65) and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed
from the concatenated SNP alignment using PhylML (66). BLASTn was used
to identify the genotype of the entire pgtE TSS −35 region nucleotides in all
genomes (Dataset S4).
