SUMMARY
The ventral pallidum (VP) is posited to contribute
to reward seeking by conveying upstream signals
from the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Yet, very little
is known about how VP neuron responses contribute
to behavioral responses to incentive cues. Here, we
recorded activity of VP neurons in a cue-driven
reward-seeking task previously shown to require
neural activity in the NAc. We find that VP neurons
encode both learned cue value and subsequent
reward seeking and that activity in VP neurons is
required for robust cue-elicited reward seeking. Sur-
prisingly, the onset of VP neuron responses occurs at
a shorter latency than cue-elicited responses in NAc
neurons. This suggests that this VP encoding is not a
passive response to signals generated in the NAc
and that VP neurons integrate sensory and motiva-
tion-related information received directly from other
mesocorticolimbic inputs.
INTRODUCTION
The ventral pallidum (VP) is a critical output structure of the
ventral basal ganglia (Heimer et al., 1982), linking signals from
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to downstream motor nuclei
(Heimer et al., 1987; Leung and Balleine, 2015; Mogenson and
Yang, 1991). The canonical view of VP is that it is a relay for
NAc ‘‘indirect’’ pathway signals (Gittis et al., 2014), which in
the dorsal striatum are primarily carried by D2-dopamine recep-
tor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2 MSNs) (Gerfen and
Surmeier, 2011). Yet, emerging research suggests that this
segregation of D1 ‘‘direct’’ and D2 ‘‘indirect’’ output pathways
does not apply to the ventral basal ganglia (Humphries and Pre-
scott, 2010; Zhou et al., 2003), where similar proportions of D1
and D2 MSNs project from NAc to VP (Lu et al., 1998; Tripathi
et al., 2010) and are equally likely to target VP neurons that proj-
ect to the thalamus (Kupchik et al., 2015).
Both the NAc and VP are implicated in the promotion of
reward-seeking actions by reward cues (Ambroggi et al., 2011;
du Hoffmann and Nicola, 2014; Leung and Balleine, 2013; Mahler
et al., 2014; Nicola et al., 2005; Perry and McNally, 2013; Yun
et al., 2004). In a discriminative stimulus (DS) task, cue-evoked
responses in NAc neurons encode cue value (Ambroggi et al.,
2008, 2011) and both the probability and vigor of reward-seeking
actions (McGinty et al., 2013; Nicola et al., 2004). While VP neu-
rons encode the value of primary reward (Itoga et al., 2016; Tin-
dell et al., 2006) and Pavlovian reward cues (Smith et al., 2011;
Tindell et al., 2005, 2009), the relationship between VP cue re-
sponses and cue-induced reward seeking actions has not
been studied. Here, we report that, like NAc neurons (Ambroggi
et al., 2011; Yun et al., 2004), VP neurons are required for optimal
performance of a DS task. We then investigated how VP neurons
encode a DS, how this compares to NAc responses, and
whether VP neuron responses predict the vigor of subsequent
reward seeking actions.
RESULTS
The Ventral Pallidum Is Necessary for Behavioral
Performance in the DS Task
Rats were trained to perform a DS task, in which presses on the
‘‘active’’ lever during the DS (an auditory cue lasting up to 10 s)
resulted in delivery of liquid sucrose (10%). Presses made in
the absence of the DS or during presentations of an alternative
auditory cue (the non-rewarded stimulus [NS]) had no pro-
grammed consequences (Figure 1A). First, we investigated
whether activity in VP neurons is necessary for performance of
the task, by infusing a low-dose mixture of the GABAA agonist
muscimol and the GABAB agonist baclofen into the VP of rats
trained to respond to at least 60% of DS presentations. Inactiva-
tion reduced the probability of a response to the DS (t(6) = 3.087,
p = 0.0215; Figure 1C) but had no effect on total active lever
presses (t(6) = 0.9702, p = 0.36; Figure 1E) or on active presses
during the intertrial interval (t(5) = 0.095, p = 0.92) or during the
NS (t(6) = 0.6689, p = 0.5284; Figure 1D). VP inactivation slightly
but significantly enhanced the low number of inactive lever
presses (t(6) = 2.542, p = 0.044; Figure 1F). Because 3/7 rats
made zero DS responses following VP inhibition, the effect on la-
tency could not be reliably assessed. Overall, these results
establish a role for VP activity in performance in the DS task,
but not what information about the DS is encoded by VP

Figure 1. Schematic of the DS Task, Pharmacological Inactivation, Recording Histology, and Result Summary
(A) The discriminative stimulus (DS) and control cue (NS) are two auditory cues, lasting up to 10 s, presented on a variable-interval schedule with an average
interval of 30 s. Presses on the active lever during the DS terminate the DS and result in delivery of a 10% sucrose reward. Presses during the NS are recorded but
have no programmed consequences.

 neuronal activity. To address this question, we recorded the ac-
tivity of VP neurons during performance of the task.
Ventral Pallidum Neurons Respond to a Learned
Appetitive Cue at Short Latencies that Precede NAc
Responses
Rats were trained until they made active lever presses on >80%
of DS trials and <20% of NS trials and were implanted with driv-
able multielectrode arrays aimed at VP. Following retraining, we
recorded from 577 neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent
of VP (6 rats, 45 sessions; Figures 1G and S1A). Basal firing
rates ranged from 0.2 to 18.7 Hz (interquartile range: 2.9–6.7;
median = 4.7) and were not correlated with the magnitude of
cue responses, or their encoding of behavioral responses. While
many VP neurons responded to multiple task events (Figures 1H
and S2), we focused our primary analysis on explicit cue re-
sponses. Using our first response detection method, searching
for post-cue bins in which firing rate is outside the 99% confi-
dence interval of the baseline firing rate (10 s pre-cue), we found
that the majority of VP neurons are excited by the DS (426/577,
73.8%; Figures 1H and 1I), whereas a smaller proportion are in-
hibited (62/577, 10.7%) and/or exhibit both response types (23/
577, 4%). This large proportion of DS responsive neurons in
the VP (more than 70%) was surprising, given the much smaller
proportion observed in the NAc (15%–20% excited, 10%–15%
inhibited; Ambroggi et al., 2011). We expected the onset of VP
responses to the DS to reflect upstream responses in NAc and
thus to occur at longer latency. However, we observed VP DS
excitations at short latencies (Figure 1K), similar to those we
previously reported for DS excitations in NAc (Figure 1J). To
compare the latencies of DS-evoked responses in the VP and
NAc, we reanalyzed previous NAc recordings from rats perform-
ing the identical task (Ambroggi et al., 2011), using the same
onset detection criteria. Rats in both cohorts received identical
training, in the same operant boxes, and were trained to
identical criteria. VP excitations to the DS had a shorter onset
latency (median = 90 ms) than either NAc excitations (median =
110 ms; t(642) = 7.06, p < 0.0001) or inhibitions (median =
200 ms; t(533) = 14.5, p < 0.0001; Figure 1L). This suggests
that short latency DS-evoked excitations in VP neurons are
not driven by phasic NAc responses to the cue. In contrast,
VP inhibitions to the DS (median = 170 ms; Figure 1M) are de-
tected after NAc excitations (t(295) = 4.708, p < 0.0001)
and at a similar latency to NAc inhibitions (t(186) = 0.051, p =
0.96).
What Is Encoded by Changes in Firing of VP Neurons
Evoked by the DS?
We next assessed whether the changes in VP neuron firing,
which predominantly precede those observed ‘‘upstream’’ in
the NAc, occurred differentially to the DS versus the NS.
Because the onset of inhibitions occurred at a longer latency
(Figure 1M), we conducted this analysis on firing during time
windows based on these onsets (90–300 ms for excitations,
200–300 ms for inhibitions). While the majority of neurons re-
corded in VP were significantly excited by the DS (392/577,
73.5%; Figure 2A), about half of these neurons were also excited
by the NS (214/392, 54.9%; Figure 2A). The magnitude of NS re-
sponses was significantly smaller than to the DS (t(391) = 29.26,
p < 0.001) and the majority of individual neurons were more
excited by the DS than the NS (Figures 2B–2D; 54% of total neu-
rons). To assess the predictive ability of VP neuron firing rates,
we ran receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Figures
2E and 2F) to assess detection of the DS (versus baseline), the
NS, and cue identity (DS versus NS), calculating the area under
the ROC curve (auROC) for each neuron for each time window.
We found that the population auROC distribution was signifi-
cantly different from a control distribution (mean control auROC =
0.497) for the detection of the DS (t(576) = 12.1026, p < 0.001),
and identification of the DS versus the NS (t(576) = 20.58, p <
0.001; Figure 2E), but not for detection of the NS (t(576) =
1.3297, p = 0.18). This provides additional evidence that firing
in the VP neural population is predictive of the occurrence of
the DS and of the identity of the DS versus the NS.
In comparison to the DS-excited population, a small propor-
tion of VP neurons were inhibited by the DS (85/577, 14.7%). A
slightly larger proportion of neurons were inhibited by the NS
(108/577, 18.7%; x2 = 7.299, p < 0.001; Figure 2G), many of
which were excited by the DS (76/108 neurons, 70%), and ex-
hibited a brief excitation to the NS prior to the inhibition (53/
108, 90–300 ms post-DS; Figures 2I and 2J). Inhibitions selective
to the DS were generally not preceded by excitations (Figures 2I
and 2J). We hypothesize that these NS inhibitions contribute to
inhibiting inappropriate responding.
Ventral Pallidum DS Excitations Predict Latency to Make
an Instrumental Response
Beyond representing the predictive value of the DS, VP neurons
responded differentially depending on the speed and likelihood
of a subsequent reward-seeking response. This suggests that
VP neurons not only encode the incentive value of the DS but

 promote responding to it. We analyzed DS trials based on
whether they were followed by an active lever press or not (Fig-
ure 3A) and found that, as a group, DS-excited neurons are
significantly more excited when the DS is followed by reward
seeking (t(333) = 17.27, p < 0.001; Figures 3B and 3E). Further,
of the 334 DS-excited neurons from sessions with >10 omitted
trials, more than half (188/334, 56.3%) had significantly greater
DS excitations on trials with a lever press, though even on
omitted trials VP responses to the DS are still greater than re-
sponses to the NS (t(331) = �3.57, p < 0.001). In contrast to
the excitations, the DS inhibitions were not significantly different
in magnitude based on behavioral response (Figures 3B and 3F;
t(49) = �0.49, p = 0.63), suggesting that inhibitions encode
something more static than incentive motivation. Consistent
with this, inhibitions to the DS were stronger than to the NS,
even when the DS was not followed by a response (t(49) =
�6.97, p < 0.0001). While DS inhibitions do not encode response
likelihood, it is possible that DS inhibitions in a subset of VP
neurons are necessary for DS-induced reward seeking. We
also assessed firing to the DS on trials with and without a lever
press using ROC curve analysis and found that the auROC dis-
tribution was significantly greater than the control distribution
(Figure 3C; t(576) = 19.49, p < 0.001) and that the majority of
VP neurons had auROCs greater than 95% of control auROCs
(333 neurons, 57.7%), further suggesting that VP neuron excita-
tions encode the likelihood of reward seeking.
Finally, we examined whether the DS response on a given
trial is related to the latency of the animal to respond on that
trial, by running Spearman rank correlations on individual
neurons (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3). The firing rate of 156 (27%)
neurons following the DS significantly predicted the animal’s
latency to make a lever press. In most of these neurons (n =
144), the DS-evoked firing rate was inversely correlated with la-
tency to lever press. Even when we restricted our analysis to the
inhibition analysis window, few neurons had positive correlations
(200–300 ms post-DS; 12/577 neurons, 2.08%; Figure S3C).
These findings indicate that VP neuron DS excitations encode
the motivational strength of the reward predictive cue and may
play a causal role in the vigor of approach to the lever after
the cue.
Optogenetic Inhibition of VP during the DS Increases
Omissions and Latency to Respond
Based on our electrophysiological data, we hypothesized that in-
hibition of VP during the cue period would slow and/or reduce
the likelihood of DS-induced responses. We targeted expression
of ArchT3.0-eYFP or eYFP alone to VP, implanted an optic fiber
over VP (Figures 4A–4C), and trained rats in the DS task until they
responded on >80% of DS trials and <20% of NS trials. On the
test day, we illuminated VP with green light (�15 mW) for the
full duration of the DS during 50% of DS presentations (Fig-
ure S4A). We found that bilateral photoinhibition of VP during
the DS significantly increased latency to lever press (Figures
4D and 4E; laser X virus: F(1,11) = 10.615, p = 0.008). Addition-
ally, photoinhibition of VP increased the number of omissions
(Figures 4G and 4H; laser X virus: F(1,11) = 6.672, p = 0.025).
That inhibition of VP during the DS acutely increases both latency
to respond to the DS, as well as the likelihood of a response
omission indicates that VP activity during the cue actively pro-
motes DS-elicited reward seeking behavior.
DISCUSSION
Here, we demonstrate that the majority of VP neurons are
robustly excited by a cue signaling the availability of reward.
The onsets of DS-evoked excitations are detected at a shorter
latency than either excitations or inhibitions of NAc neurons in
the same task, suggesting that VP DS excitations are driven pri-
marily by inputs other than NAc MSNs. That these VP neuron ex-
citations promote reward seeking is supported by three lines of
evidence: first, DS excitations are greater when followed by a
reward-seeking response. Second, the firing rate of many neu-
rons following the DS is significantly inversely correlated with
the animal’s latency to respond. Finally, optogenetic inhibition
of VP neurons during DS presentations increases the latency
of reward-seeking actions following the DS, as well as the prob-
ability of omissions. Together, these findings demonstrate that
activity in VP neurons is a critical mechanism by which incentive
stimuli generate reward-seeking behavior.
Is VP a Simple Relay of Upstream Signals Originating
Primarily in NAc?
Much interest in the role of VP in reward seeking stems from its
proposed role as a major downstream target of the NAc. Previ-
ous work has demonstrated that NAc neurons encode cue value
(Ambroggi et al., 2008, 2011; Day et al., 2006) as well as the vigor
of reward-seeking actions (McGinty et al., 2013; Nicola et al.,
2004), and we had expected that VP activity would reflect up-
stream encoding in NAc. However, our data are not consistent
with this idea. First, we find that reward-predictive cues are
more widely represented in the VP than in the NAc, which could
be driven by NAc neurons if they had an extensive axonal arbor-
ization within the VP. Yet, anatomical data suggest that this is not
the case (Tripathi et al., 2010). Second, the onset latencies of
most VP excitations to the DS are too short to be evoked by
cue-evoked phasic inhibitions or phasic excitations in the NAc.
Therefore, the earliest components of the excitatory DS re-
sponses in many VP neurons, which predict the latency to initiate
a reward-seeking response, are not driven or gated by transient
changes in NAc neuron firing.
NAc inputs to VP may play an important role in cue-elicited
reward seeking that is independent of the timing of cue-evoked
responses in NAc neurons, as suggested by work using either
tonic inhibition or ‘‘disconnection’’ of this pathway (Leung and
Balleine, 2013; Stefanik et al., 2013b; but see Khoo et al.,
2015). Inputs from NAc to VP may also be important for inhibi-
tions observed following both the DS and the NS, which occur
at a sufficient latency (Hakan et al., 1992; Lavin and Grace,
1996; Mogenson and Nielsen, 1983; Yang and Mogenson,
1985). Approximately 17% of NAc core neurons and 12% of
NAc shell neurons are excited by the DS (Ambroggi et al.,
2011); these neurons could mediate the inhibitions observed
downstream in VP. Yet, the magnitude of VP neuron inhibitions
evoked by the DS does not differ depending on whether the an-
imal makes a subsequent lever press. Overall, our results are not
consistent with the hypothesis that phasic encoding of the

 incentive strength of the DS by VP neurons is driven by upstream
phasic encoding in NAc.
Given this, what is the origin of the phasic signals to the VP that
drive, or that could be integrated to drive, VP encoding of DS
response vigor? VP neurons receive inputs from a variety of
‘‘limbic’’ areas including the prefrontal, insular, and orbital
cortices, and basolateral amygdala (Kelley et al., 1982; Maslow-
ski-Cobuzzi and Napier, 1994; Reep and Winans, 1982), basal
ganglia structures including the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
and substantia nigra (Heimer et al., 1991; Martinez-Murillo
et al., 1988; Maurice et al., 1997), as well as inputs from the
lateral hypothalamus (Grove, 1988), midline thalamic nuclei, sub-
thalamic nucleus (Fuller et al., 1987), and parabrachial nucleus
(Saper and Loewy, 1980). One promising candidate region pro-
jecting to VP, which has been implicated in the DS task and
shown to influence NAc encoding of incentive stimuli and
reward-seeking vigor is the basolateral amygdala (Ambroggi
et al., 2008; Ishikawa et al., 2008a; Jones et al., 2010; Za
´ borszky
et al., 1984). Prefrontal cortex is also implicated in the DS task
(Ishikawa et al., 2008b) as well as other forms of cue-induced
reward seeking (Capriles et al., 2003; Peters et al., 2009; Stefanik
et al., 2013a). Phasic inputs from these regions may be inte-
grated with more tonic signals from NAc to generate incentive
salience encoding. Future studies are required to determine
what is specifically encoded by these inputs, and which VP
efferent targets are critical for the generation of motivational
vigor in response to cues.

creases DS Response Latency and Omis-
sions
(A) Example of ArchT virus expression (green) in VP
with fiber placement (Dapi in blue; 53).
(B) Example of substance P immunohistochemsitry
(red) for demarcating the borders of the VP.
(C) Merged photo of substance P (red) and ArchT
virus expression (green) in VP.
(D–I) Scatterplots of average latency (D) and per-
centage of omissions (proportion of trials with no
response, G) on laser trials versus no laser trials.
Individual data points and mean (±SEM) for the
difference between laser and no laser trials for la-
tency (E) and percentage of omissions (H). Data
split into four bins of seven trials each to demon-
strate the time course of the difference between
laser and no laser trials for latency (F) and per-
centage of omissions (I) in ArchT3.0 (green) and
YFP control rats (gray). *p < 0.05 laser versus no
laser; +p < 0.05 ArchT3.0 versus YFP.
