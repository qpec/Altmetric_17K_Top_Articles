Abstract
Criminal behaviour poses a big challenge for society. A thorough understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying criminality could optimize its prevention and management. Specifically,elucidating the neural mechanisms
underpinning reward expectation might be pivotal to understanding criminal behaviour. So far no study has assessed
reward expectation and its mechanisms in a criminal sample. To fill this gap, we assessed reward expectation in
incarcerated, psychopathic criminals. We compared this group to two groups of non-criminal individuals: one with high
levels and another with low levels of impulsive/antisocial traits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to
quantify neural responses to reward expectancy. Psychophysiological interaction analyses were performed to examine
differences in functional connectivity patterns of reward-related regions. The data suggest that overt criminality is
characterized, not by abnormal reward expectation per se, but rather by enhanced communication between reward-related
striatal regions and frontal brain regions. We establish that incarcerated psychopathic criminals can be dissociated from
non-criminal individuals with comparable impulsive/antisocial personality tendencies based on the degree to which
reward-related brain regions interact with brain regions that control behaviour. The present results help us understand
why some people act according to their impulsive/antisocial personality while others are able to behave adaptively despite
reward-related urges.

 Introduction
Criminal behaviour causes great individual suffering as well as
large social and economic costs (Wickramasekera et al., 2015).
There is a pressing need to understand this behaviour to im-
prove risk assessment, prevention and treatment strategies
(van der Gronde et al., 2014). Here, we add to this understanding
by advancing recent insights in the neurobiology of reward pro-
cessing derived from studying impulsive/antisocial traits in
healthy community samples compared with a criminal sample.
In the perspective of risk assessment regarding recurrent
criminal behaviour, the construct of psychopathy is of particu-
lar interest. It is highly associated with violent criminal behav-
iour (Porter and Woodworth, 2006; Blais et al., 2014): For
example, people fulfilling the criteria for psychopathy are over-
represented in the US prison population: �25% of inmates are
diagnosed with psychopathy compared with 1% of the general
population (Hare, 2003; Porter and Woodworth, 2006). It might
therefore not be surprising, that tools developed to assess
psychopathy have found to be useful in predicting future crim-
inal behaviour (e.g. Camp et al., 2013; Whittington et al., 2013).
Especially, the impulsive/antisocial factor of psychopathy has
repeatedly been shown to be predictive of violence (e.g. Edens
et al., 2008; Kennealy et al., 2010; Camp et al., 2013; Blais et al.,
2014).
Interestingly, recent advances in neurobiological research
elucidate the neural underpinnings of this impulsive/antisocial
factor (Buckholtz et al., 2010a): Functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) evi-
dence suggest that reward expectancy and its underlying meso-
limbic dopamine system, might be key to understanding
impulsive/antisocial traits (Buckholtz et al., 2010a; Bjork et al.,
2012). These seminal findings were however collected from
healthy control, community samples and therefore precluded
direct conclusions about its relevance for understanding overt
criminality. Here, we will fill this gap by assessing the neurobio-
logical underpinnings of reward expectancy in a low and high
impulsive/antisocial non-criminal group and a (psychopathic)
criminal group also scoring high on impulsive/antisocial traits.
This will allow us to further our understanding of the relation
between impulsive/antisociality, reward expectancy and, critic-
ally, overt criminality on a neurobiological level.
More specifically, recent work on reward expectation has
shown that non-criminal volunteers with impulsive/antisocial
personality traits [assessed with the Psychopathy Personality
Inventory (PPI) (Lilienfeld and Andrews, 1996)] exhibit enhanced
reward
expectancy-related
blood

level
dependent
(BOLD) signal in the ventral striatum (Buckholtz et al., 2010a;
Bjork et al., 2012) as well as enhanced ventral striatal dopamine
release (Buckholtz et al., 2010a). Buckholtz et al. (2010a) used a
monetary incentive delay (MID) task to assess the association
between reward anticipation and impulsive/antisocial traits in
a mixed gender community sample. During reward anticipa-
tion, the right nucleus accumbens signal correlated positively
with the impulsive antisocial factor of psychopathy. The au-
thors proposed that this neural hyper-reactivity to reward ex-
pectation is either a direct consequence of aberrant firing of
midbrain dopamine neurons (ventral tegmental area) or a result
of decreased regulatory control of ventral striatal activity
through a broad inhibitory failure of prefrontal areas. These re-
sults have been extended by Bjork et al. (2012), who showed that
impulsive/antisocial traits correlate positively not only with
ventral striatal activity during instrumentally obtained rewards,
but also with anticipation of passively obtained rewards in the
anterior mesofrontal cortex. To advance these findings to a fo-
rensic level, involving overt and severe criminality, it is pivotal
to test criminal, impulsive/antisocial individuals. This enables
direct assessment of whether enhanced neural processing of re-
ward expectation in non-criminal impulsive/antisocial adults
extends to criminal impulsive/antisocial individuals. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate the neural mechanism
underlying reward expectation in a group of criminals scoring
high on antisocial/impulsivity factor of the psychopathic per-
sonality inventory. Specifically, we assessed whether these
criminals show similar (or even greater) increases in ventral
striatal reward expectancy-related BOLD signal as do (than)
non-criminal healthy controls with high impulsive and antiso-
cial traits (following Buckholtz et al. 2010a). If the ventral striatal
reactivity is related to the level of impulsive/antisociality as
measured by the PPI, but not directly related to criminality, we
expect no group differences in ventral striatal reactivity be-
tween the criminal and non-criminal high impulsive/antisocial
groups. In addition, overt criminality might only emerge in
high-impulsive antisocial persons if the relatively high level of
ventral striatal reactivity to reward expectation is not accompa-
nied by appropriate regulation of other brain areas. We tested
this latter hypothesis by assessing differences in neural con-
nectivity between the healthy control group scoring high on im-
pulsive/antisocial traits and the criminal group.
Note that the impulsive/antisocial traits assessed here are
an integral part of the psychopathy construct (Neumann et al.,
2005; Hare and Neumann, 2008), but do not specifically distin-
guish psychopathic criminals from other criminals (Patrick
et al., 2009). Here, we nevertheless focus our analyses on these
traits, rather than on the interpersonal and affective traits of
psychopathy, firstly because we aim to further the findings of
Buckholtz et al. (2010a) who were able to convincingly couple
these traits to reward-expectation and its underlying neurobiol-
ogy. Second, the aim to advance insight in overt criminality
seems to be best served by assessing the impulsive/antisocial
traits as measured by the PPI: These traits reflect past violence
and predict future violence more consistently and with larger
effect sizes than the interpersonal/affective factor (e.g. Edens
et al., 2008; Kennealy et al., 2010; Camp et al., 2013; Blais et al.,
2014).
Materials and methods
Participants
We assessed BOLD signal with fMRI in 34 subjects using an MID
task, known to induce reward-related BOLD signal in the ventral
striatum (Knutson et al., 2001; Hoogman et al., 2013). These 34
subjects consisted of 20 healthy subjects without criminal re-
cord and 14 psychopathic criminals (Table 1). The latter group
was part of a group of 18 patients recruited on a voluntary basis
from the inpatient population of a high security forensic psychi-
atric hospital in the Netherlands based on available information
about clinical status and prior history. Two criminals had to be
excluded due to technical problems and two withdrew from
participation during the study. The remaining 14 psychopathic
criminals
were
between
18
and
55
years
of
age
(mean
age ¼ 40.14, s.d. ¼ 8.82, 3 left handed) and diagnosed with a
psychopathy score of � 26 according to the Hare Psychopathy
Check List-Revised [PCL-R (Hare, 2003); mean total score ¼ 30.6,
s.d. ¼ 3.9]. We assessed IQ levels using the Dutch version of the
National Adult Reading Test (Schmand et al., 1991). Twenty
healthy men (three left-handed) matched for age and IQ (mean

 age ¼ 40.8, s.d. ¼ 9.86) without criminal records and/or a history
of current psychiatric disorders were recruited by advertise-
ment among employees of the high security forensic psychiatric
hospital.
Participants in both groups were checked for drug use and
for medical history. Furthermore, all subjects (n ¼ 34) were as-
sessed with the PPI (Lilienfeld and Andrews, 1996). Following
Buckholtz et al. (2010a), we focused on the second factor (impul-
sive/antisocial traits) and divided the healthy control group by
median split (median ¼ 146) in a high and a low scoring group.
The above procedure resulted in three groups: (i) a non-crim-
inal control group with low impulsive/antisocial traits, (ii) a
non-criminal control group with high impulsive/antisocial traits
and (iii) a psychopathic criminal group (Table 1). The three
groups did not differ in IQ and age (both P > 0.715; Table 1). Of
note is that impulsive/antisocial trait scores did not differ be-
tween the non-criminal healthy high impulsive/antisocial and
the criminal psychopathy group (Table 1).
Psychopathy assessment
In both groups psychopathic traits were assessed using the PPI,
and additionally in the criminal group using the PCL-R.
Psychopathy checklist—revised. The PCL-R is a 20-item instru-
ment for assessing criminal psychopathy in research, clinical
and forensic settings. In contrast to the PPI, this is not a self-re-
port questionnaire, but items are scored by at least two inde-
pendent, trained raters based on file information, collateral
reports and extensive interviewing.
Psychopathic personality inventory. The PPI is a 187 item self-re-
port questionnaire designed to measure psychopathy in com-
munity samples (Lilienfeld and Andrews, 1996). Items are
answered on a 4-point Likert scale (1 ¼ false, 4 ¼ true). Eight sub-
scales are scored which can be further reduced into two factors
[respectively, fearless-dominance; and impulsive-antisocial be-
haviour (IA)], which in turn are summed into a total score repre-
senting a global index of psychopathy. Note that the IA factor
was used to split the healthy control group into high and low
scoring subjects.
Procedure
Participants received written and oral information about the ex-
periment and signed an informed consent. All participants were
invited for a screening session and a scan session with no more
than 2 weeks in between the appointments. During the first
appointment, they were screened for psychiatric exclusion cri-
teria1 by trained psychologists using the Structure Clinical
Interview for DSM disorders to exclude axis 2 disorder [SCID-II;
Dutch version (Weertman et al., 2000)], Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview to exclude axis 1 disorder [MINI;
Dutch version (van Vliet et al., n.d.)] and the Dutch version of
the National Adult Reading Test for IQ assessment (NLV;
Schmand et al., 1991). Further, participants completed the PPI
(Lilienfeld and Andrews, 1996) [Dutch version (Jelicic et al.,
2004)]. They were instructed not to drink more than 3 units/day
during in the week preceding the experimental measure, not to
use of alcohol within 24 h of the measurement, not to use can-
nabis or other illicit drugs within the week before measurement,
not to use psychotropic medication other than oxazepam dur-
ing the 5 days before measurement, not to use oxazepam within
12 h before measurement and not to smoke within 1 h before
measurement and no more than five cigarettes on the scan day.
Furthermore, they were asked to refrain from any caffeinated
drinks and chocolate on the scan day and to refrain from exten-
sive physical exercise and heavy meals before the scan session.
In the scanner, participants wore earplugs and headphones.
Foam pads were placed inside the head coil to restrict move-
ment and a heartbeat device was connected to the second toe.
Before performing the MID task, participants performed an ap-
proach avoidance task reported elsewhere. Instructions and
task images were projected onto a translucent screen at the end
of the scan tube, which was visible via a mirror attached to the
head coil. Participants received a practice block that was
stopped when participants had five on-time responses (hits).
After summarizing again the purpose of the task, the experi-
mental block was started, which lasted 12 min. After a short
break outside the scanner, the anatomical scan (duration:
5 min) and an unrelated task were acquired in the 3T MR scan-
ner, which was located in an adjacent scanner room.
Experimental task
Monetary incentive delay task. The MID task (Figure 1) consisted
of 75 trials (25 potentially rewarding, 25 potentially non-reward-
ing and 25 baseline fixation trials). Each trial started with a cue
(green square indicating reward trials and red square indicating
no-reward trials), which was presented for 3500–8500 ms. Next,
a white circle was presented (target) to which the participants
had to respond as quickly as possible by pressing a button. The
target was followed by a black screen for 2000 ms, after which
the outcome was displayed (1650 ms) informing the participant
about the outcome of the current trial (61) and the total amount
of points. Participants could gain one point in the reward

 condition and no points in the no-reward condition if they re-
sponded between 270 and 500 ms after target onset. The re-
sponse window was adjusted on an individual level and
separately for reward and no-reward trials (after a hit, 20 ms
was subtracted from the last response window, after a miss,
10 ms was added to the last response window). For every partici-
pant, the initial response window was set to 270 ms. This pro-
cedure resulted in comparable hit rates in the reward (34%) and
no-reward (30%) condition. Before the next cue was shown, a
black screen was shown for 500 ms. Participants were told that
the total amount of points was converted to monetary rewards
(1 point resulted in 20 eurocents) and would be given as a bonus
to the regular payment for participation.
Behavioural analysis
The number of hits, reaction times on hits and target duration
were submitted to a 2 � 3 repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance with Reward Expectation (reward, no-reward) as within-
subject factor and Group (psychopathic criminals, non-criminal
high-, non-criminal low-impulsive/antisocial) as between-sub-
ject factor.
MR Image acquisition and analysis
Image acquisition. Whole-brain imaging was performed on a 1.5
Tesla
MR
scanner
(Magnetrom
Sonata,
Siemens
Medical
Solutions,
Erlangen,
Germany)
using
an
8-channel
coil.
Functional data were obtained using a multi-echo gradient T2*-
weighted echo-planar scanning sequence (Poser et al., 2006)
with BOLD contrast (34 axial-oblique slices, repetition time, 2.64
s; echo-times: 6.9, 24.2, 33, 43 and 52 ms; in plane resolution, 3.3
� 3.3 mm; slice thickness, 3.0 mm; distance factor 0.17; flip angle
80�). In addition, a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-
prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo anatomical scan was
obtained from
each subject
from
a 3 Tesla MR
scanner
Magnetrom Trio Tim, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen,
Germany) using a 32-channel head coil (192 sagittal slices;
repetition time, 2.3s; echo time, 3.03ms; voxel size 1.0 � 1.0 �
1.0 mm; field of view 256 mm).
Preprocessing. fMRI data analysis was performed with SPM5 soft-
ware (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Trust Centre
for Cognitive Neuroimaging, London, UK). The first five volumes
of each participant’s dataset were discarded to allow T1 equilib-
rium. First, realignment parameters were estimated for the
images acquired at the first echotime and consequently applied
to images resulting from the three other echoes. The echo-
images were combined by applying a PAID-weight algorithm as-
sessing the signal-to-noise ratio as described by Poser et al.
(2006). Thirty volumes, acquired just after the main task (while
the participant watched a black screen) were used as input for
this algorithm. Thereafter, the following preprocessing steps
were applied: slice-time correction, co-registration and a seg-
mentation procedure using the tissue probability maps pro-
vided by SPM5 for grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal
fluid centered in MNI space to estimate normalization param-
eters based on the structural image. Structural as well as func-
tional
images
were
then
normalized
by
applying
these
estimates. All normalized images were smoothed with an iso-
tropic
8 mm
full-width
half-maximum
Gaussian
kernel
(Worsley and Friston, 1995).
Single subject analysis. A random effects, event-related, statis-
tical analysis was performed with SPM5. First, we specified a
separate general linear model (GLM) for each participant. This
GLM included eight main regressors representing different fac-
tors of the MID task: Cue for reward and no-reward trials;
Instrumental Target for reward and no-reward trials; Outcome
for reward-hit, reward-miss, no-reward hit and no-reward miss
trials. These regressors were modeled as delta functions at their
onset and were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic
response function (HRF). Realignment parameters (three rigid-
body translations and three rotations) were added to capture re-
sidual movement-related artefacts. High-pass filtering (128s)
was
applied
to
remove
low-frequency
drifts.

 estimates for all regressors were obtained by maximum-likeli-
hood estimation, modelling temporal autocorrelation (AR1). The
parameter estimates, derived from this fit of the model to the
data, reflect the strength of covariance between the fMRI data
and the canonical response function for each of the regressors.
Group level analysis. The beta estimates for the Cue reward and
no-reward trials were of primary interest. These were admitted
to a 2 � 3 ANOVA (full factorial) at the group-level with
Reward
Expectation
(reward/no-reward)
as
within-subject
factor and Group (psychopathic criminals/non-criminal high-,
non-criminal
low-impulsive/antisocial)
as
between-subject
factor. Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimates of variance
components
were
used
to
allow
for
unequal
variance
between
subjects
and
possible
deviations
from
sphericity
introduced by dependencies between levels in the repeated
measures factor. For the factor Group between level independ-
ence was assumed. The main effects and interactions were
then calculated.
We assessed whether increased signal during reward ex-
pectation relative to no-reward expectation was different be-
tween subjects high vs low on impulsive and antisocial traits as
was expected based on Buckholtz et al. (2010a). To this end, we
used a planned contrast (within the full factorial, ANOVA
model; contrast (1)) to compare reward- (vs no-reward-)related
signal change between the healthy controls with low impulsive/
antisocial traits and the compound group with high impulsive/
antisocial traits (i.e. healthy controls scoring high on these traits
plus the psychopathic criminals who also scored high on these
traits). Next we assessed whether reward- (vs no-reward-)
related signal differed between the psychopathic criminals and
the high impulsive/antisocial healthy controls (at the whole
brain level as well as within our small volume of interest in the
ventral striatum, family wise error corrected for multiple com-
parisons). Finally, we assessed group differences in reward-
related signal by exploring the omnibus full factorial model.
Supplementary, we repeated the full factorial ANOVA, but now
with the healthy control group divided in two groups based on
their Fearless/Dominance score (i.e. factor 1 of the PPI, see
Supplementary materials for results).
Functional connectivity analyses. Because we did not find differ-
ences between non-criminal controls with high impulsive/anti-
social traits and psychopathic criminals on the contrasts
described above, we anticipated that differences between crim-
inal and non-criminal people with impulsive/antisocial traits
might not lie in reward expectancy signals in the ventral stri-
atum per se, but in how this region is connected to other brain
regions. Therefore, we assessed differences between these two
groups in terms of functional connectivity (Friston et al., 1997)
with the ventral striatal region, in which reward-related signal
was increased in (criminals and non-criminal) people with high
impulsive/antisocial traits vs people with low impulsive/antiso-
cial traits .
To conduct this analysis, we proceeded in several steps.
First, for each individual in the psychopathic criminal and non-
criminal impulsive/antisocial control group the (first principal
component of the) BOLD time series was extracted from a 3 mm
sphere surrounding the BOLD response peak revealed by con-
trast (1) (the seed, c.q. the right ventral striatum: Figure 2a). The
time series was then deconvolved based on the canonical HRF
to construct a time series of neural responses following the pro-
cedures outlined by Gitelman et al. (2003).
Second, a GLM was estimated for every subject, which
included the following three main regressors (as well as the six
motion parameters): (1) The seed BOLD response time series; (2)
a regressor representing the task-induced effect reflecting re-
ward vs no-reward expectation and (3) the psychophysiological
interaction regressor, which is the cross product of the deconvo-
luted regressor (1) and regressor (2). The latter regressor repre-
sents the interaction between neural signal and the two task
conditions. This regressor was then convolved with the HRF.
Parameter estimates for the interaction regressor were esti-
mated by maximum-likelihood estimation, modelling temporal
autocorrelation at the subject-level. The parameter estimates,
derived from this fit of the model to the data, reflect the
strength of the task-induced change in connectivity with the
seed region (the ventral striatum). These estimates were then
used at the group level in an independent sample t-test with
group (two levels: psychopathic criminal/non-criminal impul-
sive/antisocial control) as between-subject factor to assess
group differences.
Statistical thresholding of fMRI analysis. We report only those ef-
fects that survive family wise error correction for multiple com-
parisons at the whole brain (P<0.05, voxel-level) and where
appropriate in the right ventral striatum as defined by the
Harvard–Oxford Atlas [based on previous findings by Buckholtz
et al.(2010a) and Bjork et al. (2012)].
Results
Behavioural results
No behavioural differences between groups. During reward expect-
ation subjects showed more accurate responses than during the
neutral condition (main effect of Reward Expectation on hits:
F(1/31) ¼ 8.3, P ¼ 0.007) leading to shorter target duration for the
reward condition than the no-reward condition (F(1/31) ¼ 11.0,
P ¼ 0.002). Critically, there were no main or interaction effects of
Group in terms of target duration (F < 1.5). Furthermore, as
intended by our task design, behavioural performance on hits
(i.e. accuracy) did not differ between the groups.
Neuroimaging results. First, analysis of data from all 34 subjects
replicated prior studies using this task and revealed signifi-
cantly greater BOLD signal in the ventral striatum during reward
than no-reward cues (xyz ¼ [12 14 �6], T ¼ 3.49, P¼0.007; small
volume correction for multiple comparisons within the anatom-
ically defined right ventral striatum, (Knutson et al., 2003)). Next,
we established that, following Buckholtz et al. (2010a), reward-
related BOLD signal in the ventral striatum was higher in the
two groups with high impulsive/antisocial traits than in the
group with low impulsive/antisocial traits (Figure 2a, whole-
brain corrected for multiple comparisons: T ¼ 5.31, P ¼ 0.049,
small volume correction for ventral striatum: T ¼ 3.30, P ¼ 0.011).
There were no other Group � Reward effects (established by an
omnibus
ANOVA
with
a
three-level
group
factor,
and/or
planned contrasts between pairs of groups). Critically, there
were also no differences between the two (criminal vs non-
criminal) groups with high impulsive/antisocial traits. Thus
reward-related
BOLD
signal
in
the
ventral
striatum
was
enhanced in people with impulsive/antisocial traits, but did
not
differentiate
criminal
psychopathic
individuals
from
non-criminal
individuals
with
impulsive/antisocial
traits.
Furthermore, there were no correlations between task perform-
ance (reaction times/target duration on reward vs no-reward

ventral striatum.
Next, we tested the hypothesis that the difference between
the non-criminal impulsive/antisocial group and psychopathic
criminal group does not lie in ventral striatal signalling per se,
but rather in the degree to which this reward-related neural sig-
nal interacts with neural systems that control behaviour, such
as the prefrontal cortex. This task-dependent, functional con-
nectivity analysis revealed a group effect in the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex. No other regions were revealed by this ana-
lysis. Thus, reward-related connectivity between the ventral
striatum and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was different be-
tween the psychopathic criminals and the non-criminal impul-
sive/antisocial group (Figure 2b, two sample t-test: T ¼ 7.44,
P ¼ 0.018, result was corrected for multiple comparisons at the
whole brain level). This difference was remarkable in terms of
consistency (Figure 2b): There was no overlap between the
groups, with reward-related connectivity between the ventral
striatum and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex being below zero in
all healthy high impulsive/antisocial individuals, but (around
or) above zero in all psychopathic criminals. There were no sig-
nificant correlations between connectivity differences (reward
vs no-reward) within the psychopathy group and the factors of
the two or four factor model of the PCL-R (within the psychop-
athy group, all Spearman’s rho<0.580, P>0.007, P-threshold cor-
rected for multiple comparisons). Moreover, there were no
correlations between task performance (reaction times/target
durations on reward vs no-reward trials) and connectivity (re-
ward vs no-reward).
Discussion
The present data suggest that not reward expectation per se, but
the way in which reward expectations are communicated to
frontal areas might be key to understanding the overt criminal-
ity in impulsive/antisocial people. This suggests that criminality
in impulsive/antisocial individuals is accompanied by abnormal
contribution of reward signalling to regions regulating the cog-
nitive control of behaviour (Ridderinkhof, 2004).

 We go beyond earlier studies that assessed reward expect-
ation in relation to impulsive/antisocial traits (Buckholtz et al.,
2010a; Bjork et al., 2012) by assessing high impulsive/antisocial
criminals (compared with healthy control samples) and by as-
sessing task-related connectivity. Our results show differential
task-dependent coupling between the anterior ventral striatum
and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (c.q. superior frontal gyrus)
in the high impulsive/antisocial healthy control group com-
pared with the high impulsive/antisocial criminals. Noteworthy
is the difference between these groups, which was striking in
terms of its nature and robustness: First, there was no overlap
between the groups when assessing individual connectivity pat-
terns. Second, all impulsive/antisocial healthy controls showed
a clear negative coupling, whereas all the criminal individuals
showed (near zero or) positive coupling.
These results advance findings from earlier studies showing
abnormal reward processing in healthy, non-criminal volun-
teers with impulsive/antisocial traits (Buckholtz et al., 2010a;
Bjork et al., 2012) to a criminal sample. For example, Buckholtz
et al. (2010a) have reported a positive association between im-
pulsive/antisocial trait scores and neural signal in the right ven-
tral striatum during reward expectation. The ventral striatum
well connected with (para)limbic, cortical and ventral tegmental
areas as well as motor effector sides, which enables this region
to functions as an interface between cognition, emotion and ac-
tion (Cardinal et al., 2002; Floresco, 2015). It has an established
function in reward-related processes such as expectation of re-
ward (Knutson et al., 2001) and ventral striatal deficits may be
involved in impulsivity (Basar et al., 2010), sensation seeking
and heightened reward sensitivity all associated with antisocial
behaviour (Glenn and Yang, 2012). Recently, greater reactivity in
the ventral striatum has been directly linked with increased re-
taliatory aggression (Chester and DeWall, 2015). Moreover, there
is one case description of deep brain-stimulation in bilateral
ventral striatum resolving pathological (self-directed) aggres-
sion (Harat et al., 2015). Furthermore, the finding that enhanced
reward signalling in the ventral striatum is not specific to im-
pulsive/antisocial criminals, but extends to non-criminal, but
impulsive/antisocial individuals is not surprising given previous
studies showing enhanced reward signalling in the ventral stri-
atum of healthy individuals with high impulsive (Buckholtz
et al., 2010b) or impulsive/antisocial traits (Buckholtz et al.,
2010a).
Our findings concur with a growing body of research that
suggests that subjects comparable in terms of overt criminality
and PCL-score to our sample (i.e. psychopathic criminals) are
characterized by aberrant connectivity within networks that
underpin the interaction between affective and cognitive proc-
esses (Yang et al., 2012; Contreras-Rodr�
ıguez et al., 2014; Motzkin
et al., n.d.). In fact psychopathic criminals have been shown to
exhibit abnormal functional and structural connectivity pat-
terns in particular with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Yang
et al., 2012; Contreras-Rodr�
ıguez et al., 2014). This part of the pre-
frontal cortex has long been implicated in the cognitive control
of behaviour, especially in signalling the need for performance
adjustment (e.g. Ridderinkhof, 2004), self-inhibition of move-
ments (Brass and Haggard, 2007) and impulse control (Cho et al.,
2013). Interestingly, non-invasive stimulation of the dorsome-
dial
prefrontal
cortex
via
repetitive
transcranial magnetic
stimulation has been shown to enhance inhibitory control over
prepotent responses (Obeso et al., 2013), to improve subjective
choice for delayed rewards, and to interfere with striatal dopa-
mine (Cho et al., 2015). These observations raise the hypothesis
that psychopathic criminals might exhibit a failure to adjust
performance due to aberrant impact of reward expectation.
This hypothesis should be tested in future studies with behav-
ioural tasks that are optimized for detecting aberrant behaviour
in psychopathic criminals. We hypothesize that tasks involving
both reward anticipation and adjustment of behaviour based on
punishment and/or of negative (facial) emotional cues (cf. Blair,
2008) might be particularly sensitive.
The present results might be relevant in the context of theo-
rizing about differences between ‘successful’ from ‘unsuccess-
ful’ psychopathic individuals, with the former referring to
individuals with psychopathic personality traits who do not
have any criminal convictions (Gao and Raine, 2010). Unlike pre-
vious studies that focused on reward expectation in healthy
people with psychopathic traits (Buckholtz et al., 2010a; Bjork
et al., 2012), this study included also a sample of criminal, non-
successful psychopathic individuals rather than a community
sample of people with high PPI scores. As such our data concur
with previous suggestions that there are substantial differences
between non-successful and successful psychopathic individ-
uals at neural, physiological, cognitive and behavioural levels
(Gao and Raine, 2010). Specifically, non-successful psychopathic
individuals have been argued to exhibit greater frontal impair-
ments and greater high-level cognitive deficits than do success-
ful psychopathic individuals (Gao and Raine, 2010). Our results
provide the first direct evidence for this hypothesis. Note that
the comparison between successful and non-successful impul-
sive/antisocial individuals is necessarily confounded by overt
criminal history. As such, we cannot and do not claim specifi-
city of our findings to psychopathic criminals compared with
non-psychopathic criminals.
Previous studies have shown enhanced reward expectancy
signalling in the ventral striatum of healthy individuals with
high impulsive (Plichta and Scheres, 2014) or impulsive/antiso-
cial traits (Buckholtz et al., 2010a). Nevertheless, it is far from
trivial that psychopathic criminals show similar hypersensitiv-
ity, because several other patient groups characterized by im-
pulsivity, such as ADHD, show reduced ventral striatal neural
signals during reward expectancy (Plichta and Scheres, 2014).
This result contributes to our understanding of why some peo-
ple act according to their impulsive/antisocial personality while
others are able to behave adaptively despite reward-related
urges. The enhanced reward expectation processing in psycho-
pathic criminals concurs very well with the clinical observation
that psychopathic criminals exhibit ruthless reward-driven
behaviours and that they, unlike healthy people, are not in-
hibited by immoral or otherwise aversive signals. Moreover, this
account would accord with the finding that psychopathic crim-
inals fail to adapt behaviour based on aversive information
when reward is at stake (Newman et al., 1990).
It is important to emphasize that our findings cannot be in-
terpreted as being ‘specific’ to either criminality, psychopathy
or their interaction (i.e. psychopathic criminality): a non-crim-
inal control group with high psychopathy severity (in terms of
PCL-R scores) nor a criminal control group with low psychop-
athy severity was included. Crucially, our findings enhance the
understanding of the neural mechanism underlying overt crim-
inality within impulsive/antisocial populations, given the com-
parison
of
two
(one
criminal,
one
non-criminal)
equally
impulsive/antisocial groups.
Furthermore, we highlight that the sample size in this study
was relatively modest, which is a necessary consequence of the
limited availability of clean, drug- and tattoo-free psychopathic
criminals. Indeed our sample size is comparable with that in
other fMRI studies with psychopathic criminals. Nevertheless,

 we argue that our results are reliable, given that it includes a
general replication of prior findings (Buckholtz et al., 2010a), and
given that our novel result on connectivity reaches statistical
significance even after correction for multiple comparisons at
the whole-brain level. As such, the present mechanistic study
raises a promising target for future clinical work, which could
advance our findings to a diagnostic level, by replicating in a
larger population our finding that reward expectancy-based
connectivity fully dissociated criminals from high impulsive/
antisocial non-criminals.
