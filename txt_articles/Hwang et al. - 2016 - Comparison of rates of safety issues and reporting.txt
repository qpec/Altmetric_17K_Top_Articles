Comparison of rates of safety issues and reporting of trial 
outcomes for medical devices approved in the European Union 
and United States: cohort study
Thomas J Hwang,1,3 Elisaveta Sokolov,2 Jessica M Franklin,3 Aaron S Kesselheim3 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate safety alerts and recalls, publication of key 
trial outcomes, and subsequent US approval of high 
profile medical devices introduced in the European 
Union.
Design
Cohort study.
setting
Novel cardiovascular, orthopedic, and neurologic 
devices approved in the EU through Conformité 
Européenne marking between 2005 and 2010.
Data sOurCes
Public and commercial databases searched up to 
January 2016 for press releases and announcements of 
approvals; public Food and Drug Administration and 
European regulatory authority databases for US 
approvals and safety alerts and recalls; and Medline, 
Embase, and Web of Science for peer reviewed 
publications.
Main OutCOMe Measures
 We categorized the novelty of the devices in the study 
sample as a “major innovation” or an “other change,” 
and extracted descriptive data about the devices and 
information on any safety alerts and withdrawals. 
Linear regression models examined factors associated 
with differential EU and US approvals. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were used to evaluate 
factors associated with safety alerts and recalls and 
the publication of trial outcomes for devices 
categorized as major innovations. Models controlled 
for time, therapeutic category, regulatory pathway, size 
of sponsoring company, and indicator variables for 
devices approved first in the EU and devices approved 
only in the EU.
results
67% (206/309) of devices identified were approved in 
both the US and the EU, of which 63% (129/206) were 
approved first in the EU. The unadjusted rate of safety 
alerts and recalls for devices approved first in the EU 
was 27% (62/232) compared with 14% (11/77) for 
devices approved first in the US. The adjusted hazard 
ratio for safety alerts and recalls was 2.9 (95% 
confidence interval 1.4 to 6.2) for devices approved 
first in the EU. The results of pivotal trials were 
published for 49% (37/75) of devices categorized as 
major innovations, with an overall publication rate of 
37% five years after approval.
COnClusiOns
Devices approved first in the EU are associated with an 
increased risk of post-marketing safety alerts and 
recalls. Poor trial publication rates mean that patients 
and clinicians need greater regulatory transparency to 
make informed decisions about treatment.
Introduction
Medical devices play an important role in patient care, 
but the approval of the devices and their regulation are 
handled differently in the European Union and United 
States. In the EU, devices can be marketed if they per-
form “as intended” and are likely to be safe; clinical 
testing may be required for some high risk devices. By 
contrast, in the US, high risk devices must demonstrate 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness before 
they can be used by patients, generally through the 
conduct of prospective clinical trials (see table 1 ).1
The public health consequences of these diverging 
paradigms for device regulation have come under 
increasing scrutiny.2-5  On the one hand, approving 
devices without first requiring evidence of safety and 
effectiveness can reduce the time to market of new tech-
nologies. For example, transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement was developed as a less invasive treatment 
option for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis.6 
 
The first transcatheter aortic valve replacement was 
approved for use in the EU in 2007
, four years earlier 
than the first approval by the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration in 2011 (although it was not until 2010 that 
evidence of this device’s effectiveness was established 
by a published randomized controlled trial).7
On the other hand, widespread use of new devices 
without adequate testing makes informed treatment 
decisions difficult and can slow the ability of investigators 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
In the European Union, medical devices are approved by private notified bodies if 
they meet performance criteria and are likely to be safe, but notified bodies 
generally do not require evidence of effectiveness for most devices
Many high risk devices are approved faster in the EU than in the United States, 
where the Food and Drug Administration usually requires prospective clinical trials 
of such devices
Controversy over the safety of implanted devices approved without rigorous clinical 
testing has led to calls for regulatory reforms in the EU and US
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Most high profile medical devices approved in the EU (devices for which the 
approvals are publicly announced), including devices identified as major 
innovations, are eventually also approved in the US
Medical devices available in the EU before the US are at higher risk for emergence 
of safety issues
Evidence of clinical performance or outcomes for many new medical devices that 
could guide treatment decisions remains unpublished or unavailable up to five 
years after approval

to generate this information for future patients. In addi-
tion, patients might be exposed to an increased risk of 
harms from devices of uncertain utility. For example, a 
report by the FDA highlighted 12 devices that were 
approved in the EU (but not the US) and later found to 
be unsafe or ineffective.8  The recent emergence of 
safety issues involving implanted devices in the EU9-12 
 
and the US13-15 has renewed calls to revisit the appropri-
ate trade-offs between access to devices and risk. After 
the European Commission called for immediate action 
to better guarantee the safety of medical technology in 
the Joint Action Plan of 2012, new draft regulation is 
now in the late stages of negotiation.
Evidence on the safety and performance of the EU’s 
approach to the regulation of devices is limited.16  Previ-
ous studies have focused on the quality and reporting of 
evidence supporting approvals of devices in the US3 
17-24 
 
and safety record of devices approved with less clinical 
testing.25-27  Attempts to study EU device regulation have 
been hampered by the lack of a publicly available regis-
ter of approved devices in the EU (as there is in the US); 
the confidentiality of information submitted to notified 
bodies and regulators; and the decentralized nature of 
approval decisions made across individual member 
states.1

We identified high profile new medical devices 
approved in the EU between 2005 and 2010 and evalu-
ated safety issues related to these devices and publica-
tion of the key outcomes of trials. We focused on 
cardiovascular, neurologic, and orthopedic devices, 
which account for the majority of high risk devices used 
in clinical practice.
Methods
study cohort
We used public and commercial sources to construct a 
novel dataset of medical devices granted marketing 
approval (Conformité Européenne (CE) marking) in the 
EU between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010 and 
indicated for the treatment of cardiovascular, neuro-
logic, and orthopedic conditions (fig 1). We focused on 
“high profile” devices, defined as those with publicly 
announced approvals.
In the US, devices are “approved” through premarket 
approval (PMA), humanitarian device exemption, and 
premarket supplement pathways, or “cleared” through 
the 510(k) process. For simplicity, we use “approval” to 
refer to both types of authorization, unless otherwise 
denoted.
Firstly, we searched Factiva (Dow Jones, New York, NY) 
for company press releases and news articles 
 
mentioning devices granted CE marking. We did a simi-
lar search through annual reports, financial regulatory 
filings (eg, with the US Securities and Exchange Com-
mission), transcripts of calls on earnings and investor 
relations, and stock analyst reports using two commer-
cial databases (S&P Capital IQ, McGraw Hill Financial, 
New York, NY, and Bloomberg, Bloomberg LP, New 
York, NY). We then consulted market research reports, 
trade publications, and search engines, and cross 
checked our results with a commercial database of mar-
keted medical devices (Evaluate, London, UK). We also 
reviewed companies’ websites and marketing materials 
to match product names, which might differ between

the US and EU. Finally, we supplemented these searches 
with a manual review of the FDA review summaries for 
PMA devices approved between 1 January 2005 and 31 
January 2016; these summaries typically include a 
“prior marketing history” section. We initially down-
loaded all data on 30 May 2015 and subsequently 
updated the data through 31 January 2016.
Data extraction and coding
We extracted key information, including product type 
(eg, implantable electric stimulator) and trade names 
(eg, Brio Neurostimulation System), therapeutic area 
and subcategory (see supplementary appendix table 1), 
sponsor’s name, marketing status in the US and EU, 
and date of CE marking. We also matched devices 
approved in the EU to the FDA’s publicly available lists 
of devices that have been cleared or approved for mar-
keting in the US through the 510(k), PMA, premarket 
supplement, or humanitarian use pathways. To identify 
devices that may have been later withdrawn or discon-
tinued, we cross referenced public sources and investor 
materials for any mention of marketing or sales in the 
US. For devices also marketed in the US, we extracted 
the date of clearance or approval, as well as the applica-
ble regulatory pathway, and identified whether devices 
were approved first in the US or in the EU. We catego-
rized the sponsors of devices as small companies if they 
had gross revenues of less than $1bn at the time of 
device approval. We searched Medline, Embase, and 
Web of Science for peer reviewed publications of the 
pivotal clinical trials used to support regulatory 
approval or used to demonstrate safety and effective-
ness of the device, or both. We excluded short case 
series reports (<25 patients).
Using a prespecified protocol (see supplementary 
appendix), we categorized the novelty of each device in 
our sample as a “major innovation” or an “other 
change.” A major innovation was defined as a device 
that: was the first in a new class of products; involved 
new technology and made new claims with respect to 
its safety or effectiveness, or both; or involved new tech-
nology and was intended to be used in a new or 
expanded patient population. For example, the Melody 
Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve was categorized as a 
major innovation because it was the first transcatheter 
pulmonary valve that received regulatory approval in 
the US or EU (CE marking granted in 2006). “Other 
change” devices included products that had already 
been marketed, as well as devices that differed from 
existing products owing to minor technical, mechani-
cal, system, or manufacturing changes.
Finally, we determined if each device in the cohort 
had been the subject of a recall or a post-marketing 
safety alert. We searched for recalls, field safety notices 
(which are issued when a device needs to be recalled for 
technical or clinical reasons), and other safety related 
corrective actions (eg, software updates to prevent pos-
sible adverse patient outcomes or device malfunction) 
using publicly available databases maintained by the 
FDA and national regulators in the two largest medical 
device markets in Europe: Germany (Bundesinstitut für 
Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) and the United 
Kingdom (Medicines and Healthcare products Regula-
tory Agency). We excluded recalls and safety alerts that 
were limited in scope (eg, a safety alert for a small num-
ber of lots because they had not been properly sterilized 
during manufacturing) or that were unlikely to cause 
adverse health consequences or technical failure (eg, a 
field safety notice for misspellings in the product label). 
To be conservative, we also excluded manufacturing 
related recalls for three products (Confient ICD and Liv-
ian CRT-D (both by Boston Scientific, MA, USA) in 
2010;29  iDuo System (ConforMIS; MA, USA) in 201530), 
for which the manufacturers stated that patients were 
unlikely to be harmed (including these recalls in our 
analysis strengthened our results).
statistical analysis
We calculated the unadjusted median difference in time 
between approval in the EU (CE marking) and in the US 
(approval or clearance by the FDA), rate and relative 
risk of safety alerts and recalls, and median time to pub-
lication of the pivotal study. Time to first safety alert and 
recall as well as time to publication were calculated 
from the time of first approval.
In adjusted analyses, we constructed: multivariable 
linear regression models to examine factors associated 
with greater time differentials in approvals between the 
EU and the US; Cox proportional hazards regression 
models to examine factors associated with safety alerts 
and recalls; and Cox proportional hazards regression 
models to examine factors associated with publication 
of trial outcomes for devices categorized as major inno-
vations. Models included all variables of interest 
regardless of statistical significance: therapeutic 
 
subcategory, regulatory pathway, size of sponsoring 
company, an indicator variable for devices categorized 
as major innovations (except for models predicting 
publication), an indicator variable for devices approved 
first in the EU (which included devices not yet approved 
in the US), and an indicator variable for devices 
approved only in the EU. To account for secular trends 
over time, we included indicator variables for year of CE 
marking or year of first approval for the linear and Cox 
regression models, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, 
we repeated our analysis of safety events using: only 
recalls, a continuous time variable instead of an indica-
tor variable for approval year, indicator variables for 
therapeutic area, and subcategory. We also repeated 
our analyses using logistic regression models and 
obtained substantively similar results.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata ver-
sion 12 (StataCorp). We considered two tailed P values 
less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to 
involve patients in the dissemination of results, nor will

we disseminate results directly to patients, beyond our 
general media communications plan.
Results
Overall, 309 new devices were identified that received 
Conformité Européenne (CE) marking between 2005 
and 2010: 245 (79%) cardiovascular, 28 (9%) neuro-
logic, and 36 (12%) orthopedic devices (table 2). Nearly 
one quarter (75 of 309, 24%) was classified as major 
innovations. Most were developed by large companies 
(174 of 309, 56%).
regulatory approval in the eu and us
The majority of devices approved for use in the Euro-
pean Union in our sample were also approved for use in 
the United States (206 of 309, 67%), of which most were 
approved first in the EU (129 of 206, 63%). Among the 
devices approved in the EU and US, 44 (21%) were 
approved through the premarketing approval (PMA) 
pathway, 76 (37%) approved as supplement PMA, 82 
(40%) cleared through the 510(k) pathway, and 4 (2%) 
approved as humanitarian use devices. Of the 75 
devices categorized as major innovations, a greater pro-
portion was approved in the US (54 of 75, 72%), with 20 
(27%) approved through the PMA pathway in the US. 
Among the 54 devices categorized as major innovations 
and approved in the EU and US, most were approved 
first in the EU (40 of 54, 74%).
The median time difference between CE marking and 
FDA approval was one month (FDA clearance before CE 
marking) for 510(k) clearance, 11.0 months (CE marking 
before FDA approval) for PMA supplement, 12.3 months 
(CE marking before FDA exemption) for humanitarian 
exemption, and 36.3 months (CE marking before FDA 
approval) for PMA approval (P<0.001 for comparison 
across categories) (fig 2 ). In multivariable linear regres-
sion modeling adjusting for therapeutic subcategory, 
level of innovation, size of sponsoring company, and year, 
PMA and PMA supplement devices were associated with 
time differences of 38.0 (95% confidence interval 30.0 to 
46.1; P<0.001) and 20.5 (12.5 to 28.5; P<0.001) months, 
respectively, between CE marking and subsequent FDA 
approval (see supplementary appendix table 2).
analysis of safety alerts and device recalls
Overall, 73 devices (24%) in the study cohort were sub-
ject to a recall or post-marketing safety alert as of 31 
January 2016. Examples of safety events included the 
recall of an automated biventricular support system 
owing to a defect that could cause the device to shut 
down and stop pumping without warning (Abiomed 
AB-5000 Console, 2010), and a safety alert and labeling 
change for a neurostimulator, warning that reducing or

ceasing stimulation could cause worsening of seizure 
frequency or severity compared with before implanta-
tion (Medtronic Deep Brain Stimulation, 2015).
The unadjusted rate of safety alerts and recalls in 
devices approved first in the EU (including CE marked 
devices not yet approved in the US) was 27% (62 of 232) 
compared with 14% (11 of 77) for devices approved first 
in the US (risk ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 
3.4; P=0.04). In multivariable Cox regression modeling, 
devices approved first in the EU were associated with a 
2.9-fold greater rate of safety alerts and recalls (hazard 
ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 6.2; P=0.005) 
and a 4.6-fold greater rate of recalls (4.6, 1.5 to 14.0; 
P=0.006) than devices approved first in the US (fig 3 
 
and supplementary appendix table 3). Similar results 
were obtained in sensitivity analyses using a continu-
ous time variable and adjustment for therapeutic area 
and subcategory (see supplementary appendix tables 4 
and 5). For example, a drug eluting stent received CE 
marking in 2006. However, a year later the stent was 
recalled after results of a US pivotal trial showed that 
the device was associated with significantly increased 
rates of major adverse cardiac events, including myo-
cardial infarction and target vessel revascularization.31
Peer reviewed publication of primary trials of device 
safety and effectiveness
Among the 75 novel devices categorized as major inno-
vations, the results of pivotal trials were published for 
37 (49%). The median time to publication from first reg-
ulatory approval in the US or EU was approximately 3 
years (37 months; range 0-118 months). Overall, the 
rates of publication one year, two years, and five years 
after regulatory approval were 7%, 17%, and 37%, 
respectively. In multivariable Cox regression modeling, 
devices approved in the US through the PMA pathway 
were significantly more likely to achieve publication 
than non-PMA approved devices (hazard ratio 8.6, 2.8 to 
26.9; P<0.001).
discussion
We found that among high profile cardiovascular, neu-
rologic, and orthopedic devices authorized for approval 
in the EU between 2005 and 2010, including those cate-
gorized as major innovations, the majority were 
approved first in the European Union and subsequently 
in the United States. Overall, a quarter of the devices in 
our study were associated with safety issues after they 
reached the market, ranging from communications 
about expanded safety warnings to recalls. Devices 
approved first in the EU were also associated with a 
nearly threefold greater rate of safety alerts and recalls.
Comparison with other studies
In a study of Food and Drug Administration approved 
prescription drugs, Carpenter and colleagues found 
that drugs approved closer to a regulatory deadline 
were more likely than other drugs to have serious safety 
issues, including withdrawal from the market for safety 
reasons and black box warnings.32  In a review of urgent 
recalls of devices (those with a reasonable chance of 
causing serious injury or death) issued by the FDA, 
Zuckerman and colleagues found that between 2005 
and 2009 these recalls related to 35 cardiovascular 
devices, including 12 devices approved through the 
PMA pathway.26  During this period, the FDA approved 
45 new cardiovascular devices through the PMA path-
way,33 implying a rate of safety issues (12 of 45, 27%) 
comparable to our estimate. Similarly, Day and col-
leagues examined rates of recall of FDA approved ortho-
pedic devices and found that such devices cleared 
through 510(k) were 11.5 times more likely to be recalled 
for any reason than were PMA approved devices 
(17
.8% v 1.6%).34
Evaluating safety problems associated with devices 
in the US and EU has previously occurred mostly 
through anecdotal reports and uncontrolled analyses. 
A case series report by the FDA warned “the limited 
testing required in the EU can fail to predict dangerous 
risks and lack of effectiveness in actual use” and docu-
mented 12 high risk devices approved only in the EU 
that were “ultimately withdrawn from the market, but 
only after thousands of patients were harmed.”8

One industry sponsored analysis found that the abso-
lute number of serious device recalls did not differ 
between the US and EU, but the relative rate of all safety 
issues was not determined.35
The median delay of three years between Conformité 
Européenne (CE) marking and US approval for PMA 
pathway devices—which are usually the highest risk 
implantable devices—in our study is consistent with 
prior industry estimates during a comparable period.36 
 
Most of the medical devices (67%) in our study were 
approved in both the US and the EU, similar to the pro-
portion of new prescription drugs approved in both 
locations (66%).37
Roughly half (51%) of the primary trials assessing the 
safety and effectiveness of devices judged to be major 
innovations remained unpublished or not conducted 
over five years after first approval, comparable to the 
rate reported in a study23  of high risk cardiovascular 
devices approved in the US between 2000 and 2010 (46 
of 106, 43%). Similarly, Kynaston-Pearson and col-
leagues found that nearly half of recently introduced hip 
replacement prostheses had no published evidence of 
clinical effectiveness.38  By contrast, previous studies39 
40 
 
found that the results of 76-78% of pivotal trials for new 
drugs are eventually published. Information on devices 
approved in the EU, or pathways in the US that do not 
require premarket clinical testing, is even more lim-
ited.22  In a study of 10 devices reimbursed in Austria, 
Wild and colleagues found that evidence available at 
the time of CE marking are more often case series or 
small feasibility trials, compared with the controlled 
trials and large prospective cohort studies used as the 
basis for FDA approval.41  In turn, low rates of publica-
tion and lack of high quality evidence may adversely 
impact patient outcomes. Nieuwenhuijse and col-
leagues found that innovative and well known hip and 
knee replacement prostheses were widely implanted 
despite a lack of high quality evidence supporting their 
use; several of these devices were also associated with 
inferior survival and higher rates of revision.27
limitations of this study
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we identified 
devices approved in the EU based primarily on com-
pany announcements, investor reports, and news arti-
cles on marketed products. Since we focused on devices 
with publicly announced regulatory approvals, our 
findings might not be generalizable to devices that are 
authorized but not marketed or that are introduced 
without formal notice to the public or shareholders, 
and this study likely underestimates the total number of 
approvals during the study period. However, this can-
not be definitively determined. In a prior investigation 
by The BMJ, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency was unable to provide any data on 
the numbers of high risk devices currently in use,42  and 
similarly denied this information to researchers.28 43 
 
None the less, given the strong incentives for companies 
to market and sell their products as widely as possi-
ble,44 we believe our studied devices represent those 
most likely to be used by patients and clinicians. 
Secondly, we focused on three disease areas, but 
these include the most commonly used implantable 
and high risk devices in clinical practice45-47  and repre-
sent approximately 70% of all high risk devices 
approved in the US.20  Thirdly, although we chose our 
study period to allow at least five years of follow-up 
(consistent with the upper bound of prior estimates of 
the time differential between CE marking and FDA 
approval35 ), with time, more of the devices currently 
approved only in the EU may be approved in the US, 
and more trials may be published. Fourthly, CE marking 
does not guarantee that patients will immediately have 
access to new products, and actual delays in access 
between the US and EU may be smaller after accounting 
for the time associated with reimbursement decisions 
by EU payers.48  Fifthly, there may be additional safety 
issues that have not yet triggered regulatory action, 
which would mean that our study underestimates the 
true prevalence of device related safety concerns. It is 
also possible that the standards for issuing safety alerts 
and recalls may differ across jurisdictions, although 
prior studies have reported that the absolute number of 
safety related announcements is comparable between 
the US and EU.34  To mitigate the potential for bias, we 
included all safety alerts and recalls issued in both the 
US and the EU. Finally, an additional number of devices 
may be ineffective, and other reasons may explain why 
certain devices approved in the EU are not also submit-
ted for approval in the US. For example, in a large ran-
domized controlled trial, a novel CE marked 
biodegradable drug eluting stent did not improve clini-
cal outcomes compared with an older drug eluting 
stent; the stent remains available only in the EU.49
Conclusions and policy implications
Despite these limitations, this study provides an 
important empirical measure of the trade-offs associ-
ated with the US and EU frameworks for regulating 
medical devices. Although most devices, including the 
majority of those identified as major innovations, are 
ultimately approved in both the US and the EU, patients 
in the US may not have access for up to three years later 
than patients in the EU. Supporters of the current EU 
system argue these delays have public health implica-
tions if some patient populations can benefit from ear-
lier treatment, although a device’s true benefits might 
only be known in retrospect after the trials needed for 
FDA approval are conducted. In the US, regulators 
could improve their efficiency and minimize delays by 
fast tracking approval of devices with the potential to 
substantially improve patient health outcomes. To that 
end, in 2014 the FDA announced a pilot program to 
expedite development and approval of certain high risk 
medical devices for serious or life threatening condi-
tions characterized by unmet medical needs.50
However, the possible benefits of faster access must be 
carefully weighed against the risks arising from devices, 
as was observed with a number of drug eluting stents ini-
tially hailed as breakthroughs,51  but later found to be 
unsafe or ineffective.52-55  There has been growing con-
sensus by patients, physicians, payers, and  
policymakers

that the current EU system could be revised to better safe-
guard patient safety.56-67  Compared with the US, at the 
time of approval, patients in the EU have substantially 
less and lower quality information on the potential ben-
efits and harms of new devices, which raises ethical con-
cerns because CE marking may be misinterpreted as 
signifying that devices are safe and clinically effective.40 
 
The European Society of Cardiology and others have 
called for a centralized system for evaluating high risk 
devices; stronger and more transparent clinical data 
requirements that incorporate expert medical advice; 
and public education on the limitations of CE marking.68
As of January 2016, however, the proposed revisions of 
the EU’s directives on medical devices did not include a 
new regulatory body focused on devices. At a minimum, 
policymakers should require greater transparency, includ-
ing a public register of all CE marked devices and summa-
ries of their regulatory decisions (as is the case for drugs in 
the EU and both drugs and devices in the US). The Euro-
pean Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) already 
collects some of these data, but this database is not pub-
licly accessible. Such information is important for patients 
and clinicians to make informed decisions about treat-
ment as well as for researchers, who might not know that 
similar products have been studied in unpublished trials.69 
 
Beyond greater transparency, policymakers could con-
sider compromise solutions that would benefit both 
patients and device manufacturers, such as coupling more 
rigorous evidentiary standards for the highest risk devices 
with a streamlined pathway for reimbursement across the 
EU, as well as conditional approval and funding of break-
through technologies.70  Indeed, one economic modeling 
study found that between 2004 and 2013, coronary stents 
studied in clinical trials were more likely to be commer-
cially successful than those that were not, and European 
utilization of new stents increased substantially after the 
results of clinical trials conducted for US approval were 
released; the authors concluded that the EU could mean-
ingfully improve patient welfare by increasing the infor-
mational standard required for market access.71
Conclusions
Patients and clinicians need access to, and balanced 
presentation of, the available evidence of the safety and 
effectiveness of novel devices, as well as clear communi-
cation about the evidentiary gaps. Our findings suggest 
that products introduced earlier in their development 
cycle are also more likely to increase the risk of harms, 
underscoring the urgent need for transparency to make 
truly informed decisions.
