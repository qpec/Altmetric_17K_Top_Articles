BACKGROUND: Although married cancer patients have more favorable survival than unmarried patients, reasons underlying this
association are not fully understood. The authors evaluated the role of economic resources, including health insurance status and
neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), in a large California cohort. METHODS: From the California Cancer Registry, we identified
783,167 cancer patients (386,607 deaths) who were diagnosed during 2000 through 2009 with a first primary, invasive cancer of the
10 most common sites of cancer-related death for each sex and were followed through 2012. Age-stratified and stage-stratified Cox
proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality
associated with marital status, adjusted for cancer site, race/ethnicity, and treatment. RESULTS: Compared with married patients,
unmarried patients had an elevated risk of mortality that was higher among males (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.29) than among females
(HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.18-1.20; Pinteraction < .001). Adjustment for insurance status and nSES reduced the marital status HRs to 1.22 for
males and 1.15 for females. There was some evidence of synergistic effects of marital status, insurance, and nSES, with relatively higher
risks observed for unmarried status among those who were under-insured and living in high nSES areas compared with those who
were under-insured and living in low nSES areas (Pinteraction 5 6.8 3 1029 among males and 8.2 3 1028 among females). CONCLU-
SIONS: The worse survival of unmarried than married cancer patients appears to be minimally explained by differences in economic
resources. Cancer 2016;122:1618-25. V

INTRODUCTION
The association of marital status with cancer survival is well established: mortality is lower among married than unmarried
patients with cancer irrespective of sex, site, and stage of disease.1-3 In a recent analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) data, Aizer et al demonstrated significantly lower cancer-specific mortality among married patients
diagnosed with 1 of the 10 most common cancer types4 after adjustment for stage, treatment, age, sex, and county-level
socioeconomic status (SES). Increased social support has been suggested as 1 of the primary drivers for the inverse associa-
tion between being married and cancer mortality, particularly because married cancer patients were more likely than
unmarried patients to be diagnosed at an earlier disease stage and to receive definitive treatment.4,5 The protective effect of
marriage on survival is greater among males than females and diminishes with increasing age.6,7
Married patients differ from unmarried patients in many ways; they are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors,
such as having better diets, engaging in more physical activity, participating in health-prevention measures like cancer
screening, and receiving more aggressive treatment.6-8 Less well studied, however, is the impact of economic resources as a
contributing factor for marriage-associated survival differences, despite the finding that married individuals generally have
greater combined income and access to health insurance than unmarried individuals.9 Moreover, economic disadvantage
may interact with marital status to produce heightened disparities in cancer outcomes.10

 Therefore, we assessed the extent to which mortality
differences between married and unmarried cancer
patients are explained by health insurance status and
neighborhood SES (nSES). We addressed this question
using population-based data from the California Cancer
Registry (CCR) for the 10 most common sites of cancer-
related deaths, with attention to differences by sex and
including data on patient-level health insurance status and
neighborhood-level (ie, block-group) SES as indicators of
economic resources.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case Selection
We obtained data for first primary invasive cancers among
individuals aged �18 years diagnosed from 2000 through
2009. For males, the cancer sites were prostate, lung and
bronchus (“lung”), colon, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(“NHL”), bladder, liver and intrahepatic bile duct (“liver
and IBD”), leukemia, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus.
For females, the sites were breast; lung; colon; corpus and
uterus, not otherwise specified (“uterus”); NHL; ovary;
pancreas; leukemia; brain and other nervous system
(“brain”); and liver and IBD. The data were obtained
from the CCR, which registers cancers from throughout
the large and diverse state of California and comprises 3
National Cancer Institute (NCI) SEER program regions
and half of the cases in all 18 SEER regions. Of 844,824
cases, we excluded cases diagnosed at autopsy or from death
certificate only (n 5 9286) and those with unknown
follow-up time (n 5 4347), unknown marital status (n 5
36,937), or unknown treatment (n 5 11,087).
Patient characteristics from the CCR (from report-
ing facilities, with demographic variables based on self-
report) included: marital status, age, address and stage at
diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, sex, histology,
first course of treatment (surgery, radiation, and/or sys-
temic hormone agents), and primary and secondary sour-
ces of payment. By using the payment variables, health
insurance status was coded hierarchically as no insurance;
any public, military, or any Medicaid/Medi-Cal (includ-
ing Medicare/Medicaid) insurance; private insurance
only; Medicare only or Medicare and private insurance;
and unknown. We conducted our primary analyses with
marital status coded as married and unmarried (consisting
of never married, separated, divorced, and widowed),
because mortality risks generally do not vary greatly across
subcategories of unmarried status.7
Patient address at diagnosis was geocoded and
assigned to a census block group, then linked to an nSES
index that was developed previously from principal compo-
nents analysis, incorporating information on education,
occupation, employment, household income, poverty, rent
and house values from the Census 2000 Summary File (for
cases diagnosed 2000-2005), and American Community
Survey data from 2007 to 2011 (for cases diagnosed during
2006-2009).11,12 The hospital that initially reported each
case was classified by NCI-designated cancer center status
(yes, no).
Determination of Follow-Up and Vital Status
The CCR follows all patients for vital status, collecting
information by follow-up from the diagnosing hospital,
state and national vital statistics databases, and other sour-
ces. Follow-up time for all-cause mortality was computed
as the number of days between diagnosis and either death,
the date of last known contact, or the end date of follow-
up, whichever occurred first. For analyses of cancer-
specific death, the underlying cause of death was obtained
from death certificates; follow-up was censored at the date
of death for those who died from a cause other than the
primary cancer.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests were used to compare case characteristics
by marital status and sex. We estimated hazard ratios
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with
all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality using
multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els. Because the HRs for marital status differed signifi-
cantly by sex, we conducted analyses separately for males
and females. We also conducted analyses by age, using age
70 years as a cutoff point, because prior studies have noted
that the strength of the correlation between marital status
and mortality appears to diminish at this age.2,7
We tested the proportional hazards assumption for
each covariate using correlation tests of time versus scaled
Schoenfeld residuals. The assumption of proportional
hazards was violated for stage and age. Thus, we com-
puted stage-stratified and age-stratified Cox regression
models, allowing the baseline hazards to vary by these var-
iables. These models were adjusted for cancer site, race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [“white”], non-Hispanic
black [“black”], Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander
[“API”], and other or unknown), treatment (surgery, radi-
ation, hormone agents), nSES (statewide quintiles), and
health insurance. Models that included all of the cancer
sites combined excluded cases with leukemia, because
stage and surgery were not applicable. All statistical tests
were 2-sided with an a value of .05. Likelihood ratio tests

 of interaction were computed based on cross-product
terms. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). We did not obtain
informed consent from the patients, because we analyzed
de-identified cancer registry data.
RESULTS
The cohort included 393,470 males and 389,697 females.
With follow-up through December 31, 2012, there were
1,801,907 and 1,903,874 person-years of follow-up for
males and females, respectively, and 204,007 and
182,600 deaths, respectively. Compared with females,
males were more likely to be married and were less likely
to be widowed (for males: 70% married, 14% never mar-
ried, 1% separated, 8% divorced, and 7% widowed; for
females: 51% married, 15% never married, 1% separated,
11% divorced, and 22% widowed) (Table 1). Nearly all
patients (98%) had some type of health insurance, with
private insurance being the predominant type. Unmarried
patients were more likely than married patients to com-
prise the very youngest and the very oldest age categories,
to live in lower SES neighborhoods, to be uninsured or
have public insurance, to be diagnosed at a later stage of
disease, not to receive any surgery or radiation, and were
more likely to be black but less likely to be API. The pro-
portion of patients who used an NCI-designated cancer
center was similar for married and unmarried patients at
9.7% and 9% among unmarried and married males,
respectively, and 5.9% and 6.2% among unmarried and
married females, respectively (data not shown).
Uninsured males and females had an approximately
25% increased risk of death compared with privately
insured patients (Table 2). Patients who had any public
insurance also had increased mortality compared with

 those who had private insurance. Mortality declined with
increasing levels of nSES.
Overall, both unmarried men and unmarried
women were more likely to die than their married coun-
terparts, and HRs were significantly higher in men than in
women (Table 3). Although HRs for unmarried patients
appeared to be slightly higher for those aged <70 years
than those aged �70 years, elevated risks persisted and
were stronger for men than for women in both age groups.
Similar associations for marital status were observed across
cancer sites (Fig. 1), although the size of the associations
varied somewhat, being slightly more pronounced for
NHL and prostate cancer in males and for uterine cancer,
NHL, and breast cancer in females. Results for cancer-
specific mortality were similar to those for all-cause mor-
tality (data not shown).
HRs associated with specific types of unmarried sta-
tus for women were similar across groups (compared with
married women: HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.14-1.17] for never
married; HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.11-1.22] for separated;
HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.14-1.17] for divorced; HR, 1.15
[95% CI, 1.13-1.16] for widowed). Among men, how-
ever, the HR was highest in those who had never been
married (compared with married: HR, 1.26 [95% CI,
1.24-1.28] for never married; HR, 1.17 [95% CI,
1.12-1.22] for separated; HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.21-1.25]
for divorced; HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.16-1.20] for widowed).
Adjustment for both nSES and insurance status only
marginally reduced the higher risks associated with being
unmarried (Table 4). When stratified on nSES and insur-
ance status, the HRs for marital status did not substan-
tially vary across strata (Table 5). However, there was
evidence of an interaction, such that those patients with
lower levels of insurance coverage and living in higher SES
neighborhoods had the highest risks (Table 5). Stratifying
on nSES and adjusting for insurance status did not change
associations of marital status and survival for each cancer
site, with the exception of NHL among men, for which
considerably higher HRs were observed among those liv-
ing in higher than lower SES neighborhoods (Supporting
Figs. 1 and 2; see online supporting information).
DISCUSSION
In the large, sociodemographically and geographically
diverse California population, we observed that health
insurance status and nSES did not substantively explain
the marital status association for male or female cancer
patients, despite having independent associations with all-
cause mortality. Similar results were observed across can-
cer sites, although there was some suggestion of a stronger
association for sites with more favorable survival (breast,
prostate, and NHL). Our results also confirmed previous
observations of more pronounced survival benefits associ-
ated with marriage for males than for females and some
attenuation of the association in older patients, although
the protective effects persisted even among elderly
patients.
Although the association of marriage and various
outcomes, including longevity and cancer, is supported by
a large body of research,7 the mechanisms driving this cor-
relation are not fully understood.6,7 Two underlying path-
ways have been postulated: 1) a “social” pathway, in
which greater social support, social integration, social role
attainment, and social control are available to married
individuals; and 2) a “material” pathway, in which better
economic resources, such as greater income, employment,

 and better health insurance, are available to married indi-
viduals.7 Although we were not directly able to test the
social pathway and we lacked individual-level SES infor-
mation on income and employment, our results based on
insurance status and nSES provide at least indirect evi-
dence that the survival benefits associated with marriage
may not be because of better material resources. Further
research should examine how this association is mediated
by specific factors within social pathways. Others have
demonstrated that specific social advantages of marriage
include spousal or children support/encouragement for
health-seeking behaviors, such as adherence to recom-
mended health screening and treatment, and health-
promoting behaviors, such as more exercise and better
diet.6,7 Furthermore, evidence suggests that higher levels
of social support are directly correlated with biologic proc-
esses that may mitigate the harmful physiologic effects of
stress by directly inhibiting tumor progression through
immunologic
or
neuroendocrine
pathways.6,7,13
Increased social support has been associated with mainte-
nance of normal diurnal patterns of cortisol14-16 and
lower levels of depression,17,18 both of which, in turn,

 have been associated with lower mortality. A meta-
analysis indicated that providing social support to patients
with metastatic breast cancer increases 1-year survival.19
In this study, we observed evidence of an interaction
among marital status, health insurance status, and nSES,
with slightly stronger associations for unmarried status
and mortality observed among patients with public or no
insurance living in higher SES neighborhoods. Our find-
ings may be related to the higher out-of-pocket costs for
uninsured individuals,20 with those financial challenges
compounded by the higher costs of living in higher SES
neighborhoods. In contrast, however, a recent study of
women with late-stage colon cancer in California reported
that the poorest survival was observed among unmarried
women who lived in high poverty areas and were unin-
sured or had public health insurance.10 The discrepancy
in study findings may reflect differences across cancer sites
or in the type or geographic level of nSES measure and
stages of disease. Our small area-level (block group) nSES
measure comprising 7 indicators provides a more compre-
hensive view of community-level SES than the single mea-
sure of poverty at an unspecified geographic level that was
used in the colon cancer study. Other studies have
reported higher mortality among individuals of low
individual-level SES living in the context of high SES
communities,21,22 which may reflect increased stress and
economic strain among these individuals. The lack of
individual-level SES information in population-based
cancer registry data limited our ability to further explore
this finding.
The stronger survival benefit of marriage among men
confirms prior research1,2,23,24 and may provide important
clues into underlying mechanisms. Men and women
appear to benefit differentially from marriage,25-28 with
women benefitting more financially and men benefitting
more
socially.6,7,25
Furthermore,
the
adoption
of
“healthier” lifestyle habits that often accompanies marriage
may be greater among men than women.26,27,29 Thus, the
greater survival benefits observed in men may reflect sex-
specific differences in the relative contributions of the
underlying mechanisms. In this context, our finding of
larger survival advantages for men than for women, even
after controlling for SES and insurance status, underscores
the likely importance of socially mediated factors.
Our findings benefit from the strengths of a large
and representative data source. However, this study could
not account for changes in marital status since diagnosis
or specific psychosocial factors. All studies addressing the
association of marriage and health outcomes must con-
sider the likelihood of self-selection, ie, individuals who
marry are physically, emotionally, or psychologically
healthier and/or of higher individual SES than those who
do not,6,7,30 which may be especially relevant for the
stronger effects observed in men, because unhealthy men
may have greater difficulty marrying than unhealthy
women.29 Although California is a large and diverse
region and the CCR database represents half of the cases
reported to the 18-registry SEER program, our results
nonetheless may not be generalizable to other US regions.
We also lacked granular data on treatments, adherence to
practice guidelines, and follow-up care as well as institu-
tional and provider characteristics.
In summary, in a large and representative cohort of
men and women diagnosed with 1 of the 10 most com-
mon sites of cancer-related death, we observed that the
well established survival benefit of marriage operates inde-
pendently of the economic resources we were able to
assess. We also observed evidence of greater survival defi-
cits for unmarried cancer patients with no or public insur-
ance living in higher SES neighborhoods, a new finding
that warrants further follow-up. Together, our results
suggest that, because economic resources likely play a
minimal role in explaining the detrimental survival expe-
rienced among unmarried cancer patients, future research
that focus on social support and other socially mediated
factors associated with marriage may provide an impor-
tant avenue to inform interventions that improve cancer
survival.
