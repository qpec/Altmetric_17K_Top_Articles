abstract
OBJECTIVES: The risk of infections is higher in children attending child care compared with 
children cared for at home. This study examined the effect of a combination of probiotics on 
absence from child care because of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in healthy 
infants aged 8 to 14 months at the time of enrollment in child care.
METHODS: The ProbiComp study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
A total of 290 infants were randomly allocated to receive a placebo or a combination of 
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in a dose of 109 colony-
forming units of each daily for a 6-month intervention period. Absence from child care, 
occurrence of infant symptoms of illness, and doctor visits were registered by the parents 
using daily and weekly Web-based questionnaires.
RESULTS: Median absence from child care was 11 days (interquartile range: 6–16). Intention-
to-treat analysis showed no difference between the probiotics and placebo groups (P = .19). 
Additionally, there was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes between groups; 
the number of children with doctor-diagnosed upper or lower respiratory tract infections, 
the number of doctor visits, antibiotic treatments, occurrence and duration of diarrhea, and 
days with common cold symptoms, fever, vomiting, or caregivers’ absence from work.
CONCLUSIONS: A daily administration of a combination of B animalis subsp lactis and L 
rhamnosus for 6 months did not reduce the number of days absent from child care in healthy 
infants at the time of enrollment in child care.

The risk of respiratory and 
gastrointestinal infections is 2 to 3 
times greater in children attending 
child care compared with children 
cared for at home, especially in  
young children aged 0 to 2 years, 
1 
– 
3  
and it is most pronounced within 
the first months after enrollment in 
child care.1 The increased exposure 
to infections in child care has 
been associated with factors such 
as crowding and sharing of toys, 
leading to increased risk of disease 
transmission between infants.4 
Moreover, many children stop being 
breastfed when they start in child 
care, which is also likely to increase 
the risk of infections because 
breastfeeding has been shown to 
protect against infections.5, 
 
6 In 
Denmark, 90% of all 1- to 2-year-old 
children are attending child care, 
7 
and on average each child is absent 
from child care because of illness 12 
days each year.4, 
8 Infection during 
childhood is a distress to families but 
also a financial burden to society, 
both in terms of lost working days 
of parents and medical costs.9, 
 
10 
Therefore, strategies for prevention 
are of great importance.
The effect of probiotics in the 
prevention of infections in preschool-
aged children has been investigated 
in several randomized controlled 
trials.11 
– 
26 Recent reviews and meta-
analyses have suggested an effect 
of probiotics in the treatment and 
prevention of upper respiratory 
infections and gastrointestinal 
infections in children27 
– 
33 but also 
indicated that the effect of probiotics 
is strain dependent. Bifidobacterium 
animalis subsp lactis (BB-12) and 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) are 
2 probiotic strains that have been 
widely examined, and researchers 
in studies of healthy preschool-aged 
children have reported a reduction 
in the incidence or duration of 
respiratory infections, 
11, 
14 
– 
16, 
 
25 
gastrointestinal infections, 
17, 
18 and 
a reduction in days absent from 
school or child care.11, 
 
14 Proposed 
beneficial effects of probiotics include 
interactions with both the innate and 
adaptive immune systems, which 
may increase resistance against 
pathogens.34 Many probiotic studies 
have been performed in preschool-
aged children, but to our knowledge, 
no previous study has investigated 
the effect of probiotics on infections 
during the time of enrollment in child 
care. The primary objective of the 
ProbiComp study was to examine the 
effect of a daily administration of a 
combination of the strains BB-12 and 
LGG for 6 months on absence from 
child care because of respiratory and 
gastrointestinal infections in Danish 
infants when starting child care.
MeThODs
study Design and subjects
The ProbiComp study was a double-
blind, placebo-controlled parallel 
study in which Danish infants aged 
8 to 14 months were randomly 
assigned to either probiotics or 
a placebo for a 6-month period. 
Infants were recruited during 2 
autumn seasons, from mid-August 
to mid-December in 2014 and 2015. 
Written information about the 
study was sent to parents of 11 516 
infants living in the capital region 
of Denmark by using extractions 
from the National Danish Civil 
Registry, resulting in parents and 
legal guardians of 290 infants (2.5%) 
giving written, informed consent 
to participate. Infants were eligible 
for inclusion if they were single 
born and expected to start in child 
care at age 8 to 14 months between 
September and February. Exclusion 
criteria were birth weight <2500 g, 
gestational age <36 weeks, severe 
chronic illnesses, regular medication, 
antibiotic treatment within 4 weeks 
before baseline examination, or non-
Danish–speaking parents. Intake 
of supplements or fermented milk 
products with probiotics was not 
allowed for 2 weeks up to baseline 
and during the whole intervention 
period, and intake of other yogurt 
products was limited to 1 to 2 meals 
per week. The onset of intervention 
was up to 12 weeks before expected 
start in child care. The study protocol 
was approved by the Committees 
on Biomedical Research Ethics 
for the Capital Region of Denmark 
(H-4-2014-032), and the study 
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(identifier NCT02180581).
study Product and Randomization
The study product was provided for 
free by Chr Hansen A/S (Hørsholm, 
Denmark) and consisted of 1.0 
g of maltodextrin powder, with 
or without a combination of the 
2 probiotics BB-12 and LGG at a 
dose of 109 colony-forming units 
(CFUs) each (BB-12 and LGG are 
registered trademarks of Chr 
Hansen A/S). Active sachets were 
analyzed for long-term storage 
stability at 25°C/60% relative 
humidity, and the products were 
within the specification after 24 
months. The powder was provided 
in identical sachets, and the placebo 
and active powder did not differ in 
smell, taste, or color. Neither study 
personnel nor parents were aware 
of the nature of the product, and 
unblinding took place only after 
completion of data collection and 
main statistical analyses. The infants 
were assigned to receive either 
probiotics or a placebo by using block 
randomization (randomization.com) 
with a block size of 8. The sachets 
were provided to the families for 
the entire 6-month intervention 
period at baseline and were packed 
in boxes labeled with unique 
participant identification numbers 
to ensure allocation concealment. 
A randomization list and boxes 
with sachets were prepared by 
a university employee with no 
involvement in the study. Parents 
were instructed to dissolve 1 sachet 
in a small amount of infant food 
or drink daily and not to add the 
product to hot food or drinks. They 
2

 PEDIATRICS Volume 140, number 2, August 2017
were asked to register daily whether 
the infants had ingested the product. 
Registration sheets and unused 
sachets were returned by the parents 
at the end of the intervention to 
evaluate compliance.
Data collection
Clinical examinations at the start 
and end of intervention were 
performed at the University of 
Copenhagen’s Department of 
Nutrition, Exercise and Sports in 
Denmark. Naked body weight was 
measured to the nearest 5.0 g by 
using a digital scale (TANITA BD-815 
MA; Frederiksberg Vaegtfabrik, 
Frederiksberg, Denmark). Length 
was measured to the nearest 0.1 
cm by using a portable measuring 
board (QuickMedical Medical 
Equipment and Supplies, Issaquah, 
WA). The mean of 3 measurements 
was used. At baseline, the parents 
were interviewed about household 
characteristics and infant history 
of illness since birth. At both visits, 
questions about breastfeeding and 
the use of infant formula were asked.
During the intervention period, 
occurrence of infant symptoms of 
illness, absence from child care, 
and so on were registered by the 
parents in weekly and daily Web-
based questionnaires. On a weekly 
basis, doctor visits, doctor-diagnosed 
respiratory infections, antibiotic 
treatments, absence from child 
care, and caregivers’ absence from 
work because of infant illness were 
registered. Reasons for absence 
from child care were categorized 
independently by 2 study personnel. 
Parents evaluated daily if an infant 
was ill or not. If the infant was ill, 
symptoms of the common cold 
(runny or stuffy nose and/or cough), 
fever, vomiting, and diarrhea 
were registered. All Web-based 
questionnaires could be answered 
retrospectively for ≤7 days. To 
minimize the occurrence of missing 
data, the parents received reminders 
via short message service and were 
contacted by e-mail or telephone if 
questionnaires were not answered.
Primary and secondary endpoints
The primary endpoint was the 
number of days absent from child 
care because of respiratory or 
gastrointestinal infections, which 
are defined as symptoms related to 
the respiratory or gastrointestinal 
tracts. Secondary endpoints were 
the number of days absent from 
child care because of other illnesses 
(not infections), the number of 
infants with doctor-diagnosed upper 
respiratory tract infections (URTIs) 
(eg, sinusitis, sore throat, otitis 
media, and pseudo croup) and lower 
respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) 
(eg, pneumonia and bronchitis), 
the number of URTIs per infant, 
the number of infants with at least 
1 episode of diarrhea (defined as 
≥3 loose or watery stools in 24 
hours, and a minimum of 48 hours 
separating episodes), the number 
of diarrheal episodes per infant, the 
duration of diarrheal episodes, the 
number of days with vomiting, the 
number of days with fever (>38°C), 
the number of days with symptoms 
of the common cold (defined as a 
minimum of 2 consecutive days 
with symptoms of either runny 
or stuffy nose and/or cough), the 
number of doctor visits because 
of infections or other illnesses, the 
number of antibiotic treatments, and 
the number of days caregivers were 
absent from work because of infant 
illnesses.
adverse events
Each month, the parents reported 
in Web-based questionnaires if 
their infants had experienced any 
symptoms, illnesses, or unexpected 
events not described in the daily and 
weekly questionnaires during the 
last month. The clinically responsible 
physician evaluated all reported 
symptoms.
sample size calculation
Sample size was calculated on the 
basis of Hojsak et al, 
11 who showed a 
39% reduction in the number of days 
absent from child care because of 
infections for a 3-month intervention 
period. The average number of days 
absent from child care because of 
infections was 5.1 days in the placebo 
group. A conservative estimate of 
an SD of 5.0 was also derived from 
the same article. In the current 
study, a 6-month intervention 
period would amount to children 
attending child care for an average of 
4.5 months (because of enrollment 
before admission to child care). A 
25% reduction leads to effect size 
of 1.925 (obtained as 0.25 × 5.1 × 
4.5/3). The resulting sample size 
calculation, assuming α = .05 and 
power = 0.85, showed that 244 
children (122 in each of the 2 groups) 
had to be recruited. To allow for a 
20% dropout, 153 children had to be 
recruited per group.
statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics are shown as 
mean (SD) or median (interquartile 
range [IQR]) for continuous variables 
and n (%) for categorical variables. 
Compliance was compared between 
groups by using a 2-sample t test. For 
the primary outcome, the effect of 
probiotics was evaluated by using a 
Poisson regression model with robust 
SEs (to adjust for any misspecification 
of the model). To take into account 
the difference in time from baseline 
to start in child care among infants, 
the number of intervention days 
after start in child care was included 
as an offset. Secondary outcomes, 
measured as days or episodes, were 
analyzed by using similar Poisson 
regression models but with total 
number of intervention days as an 
offset. The effect of probiotics on the 
number of children with at least 1 
episode of a URTI, LRTI, or diarrhea 
was evaluated by using logistic 
regression. Adjustment for age, sex, 
intervention year, and enrollment

period within each year (August 
to September, October, November 
to December) was included. These 
were selected before data analysis, 
and because of the randomized 
design, adjustments were limited to 
variables related to the study design 
and/or based on biological grounds. 
Analysis of the duration of diarrheal 
episodes included only infants with 
reported episodes (>0) and was 
analyzed by using mixed-effects 
Poisson regression, with infant as 
a random effect and otherwise the 
same adjustment as for the analysis 
of diarrheal episodes per child 
including all children. Additionally, 
all analyses were repeated and 
included adjustment for occurrence 
of URTIs since birth. Analyses were 
based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
concept, including all randomly 
assigned infants with any available 
questionnaire data on outcome, 
irrespective of compliance to the 
assigned intervention group. For 
infants who withdrew from the study, 
data were included until the day of 
withdrawal. Additionally, analyses 
were conducted on a per-protocol 
population and only included subjects 
with no major deviations from the 
study protocol (ie, having ≥85% self-
reported compliance and ≤14.9% 
missing data on outcome [∼27 days] 
from Web-based questionnaires). 
All analyses were performed by 
using R, 
35 and a P value of <.05 was 
considered significant.
ResulTs
As shown in Fig 1, 290 infants were 
randomly assigned in the study (145 
in each intervention year), with 144 
and 146 allocated to the probiotic 
and the placebo group, respectively. 
Three infants were excluded before 
the baseline examination because of 
antibiotic treatments, and 2 families 
withdrew their consent, resulting 
in a total of 285 infants for the ITT 
analyses. Twenty-five infants (8.8%) 
withdrew during the study (14 in the 
probiotic group) after a median of 12 
weeks of intervention (range: 
1–29). In 
both groups, dropouts were primarily 
because of parents finding study 
activities too time consuming (n = 14) 
or because the parents wanted to give 
the infants probiotics (n = 7).
As shown in Table 1, the 
randomization produced similar 
distributions in the 2 groups in 
regard to sociodemographic factors, 
anthropometrics, and breastfeeding. 
A small difference was seen in 
health status since birth, with more 
infants having at least 1 episode of 
a doctor-diagnosed URTI since birth 
in the probiotic group compared 
with the placebo group (12.7% and 
5.0%, respectively). The median 
intervention period was 183 days 
(IQR: 182–189), and 35% of the 
infants were included in the months 
of August to September, 33% in 
October, and 32% in November to 
December. The infants started child 
care at an average age of 10.6 months 
(SD: 1.1) and after a median of 12 
days (IQR: 5–21) after onset of the 
intervention. Median compliance was 
97.0% (IQR: 94.0–99.0) and did not 
differ between the 2 groups (P = .92). 
Furthermore, parents in both groups 
completed 99.0% (IQR: 96.2–100) 
of daily questionnaires and 98.2% 
(IQR: 92.3–100) and 100% (IQR: 
92.7–100) of weekly questionnaires 
in the probiotic and placebo groups, 
respectively. For daily and weekly 
questionnaires, 3.3% and 5.5% of 
records in the probiotic group and 
3.0% and 4.8% of the records in 
the placebo group were missing. 
Similar to the ITT population, infants 
excluded in per-protocol analyses

had a mean age of 10.0 months (SD: 
0.7), weight of 9.4 kg (SD: 1.0), and 
length of 73.9 cm (SD: 2.8).
Primary and secondary endpoints
There was no difference in absence 
from child care between the probiotics 
and placebo groups (probiotics 
compared with placebo: 1.14 days 
(95% confidence interval [CI] −0.55 to 
2.82). Likewise, no effect of probiotics 
was found for any of the secondary 
endpoints (Table 2). Per-protocol 
analyses showed similar results to 
ITT (Supplemental Table 3) except 
that infants in the probiotic group had 
significantly more days with fever 
than infants in the placebo group 
(mean difference 1.84, 95% CI: 0.06 
to 3.63, P = .04). However, additional 
adjustment for occurrence of at least 1 
episode of a URTI since birth rendered 
this effect nonsignificant (1.39, 95% 
CI: −0.41 to 3.18, P = .13). All other 
conclusions remained unchanged 
(data not shown).
adverse events
There were no reported adverse 
events related to the study product.
DIscussIOn
In this study, a daily administration 
of the 2 probiotic strains BB-12  
and LGG, in a dose of 109 CFU per  
day of each for 6 months, did not 
reduce days absent from child 
care because of respiratory or 
gastrointestinal infections in  
Danish infants aged 8 to 14 months  
at the time of enrollment in child 
care.
Our results support findings from 
a Norwegian study in 1- to 3-year-
old children in which no effect of 
a combination of the strains LGG 
and BB-12 (1.5 × 1010 CFU per day 
of each) was found on respiratory 
infections or absence from child 
care during their first winter in child 
care.18 However, the number of days 
with gastrointestinal symptoms 
was significantly reduced in the 
probiotic group compared with 
the placebo group.18 Similarly, a 
12-week intervention with formula 
supplemented with BB-12 (1.2 × 109  
CFU per day) resulted in fewer and 
shorter episodes of diarrhea in  
4- to 10-month-old Israeli infants in 
child care, but there was no effect 
on respiratory infections.17 A recent 
study by Hojsak et al12 in healthy 
1- to 6-year-old Croatian children 
showed no preventive effect on 
respiratory or gastrointestinal 
infections or a reduced absence from 
child care in a 3-month intervention 
with BB-12 administered in a dose 
of 109 CFU per day. Previously, 
the same authors investigated the 
probiotic LGG in a similar setting and 
found a significantly reduced risk of 
URTIs and 39% fewer days absent 
from child care because of illness 
(3.1 and 5.1 days in the probiotic and 
placebo groups, respectively).11 A 
reduced risk of respiratory infections 
and a reduction in the number of 
days absent from child care was also 
reported in 2 independent Finnish 
studies of children of the same age  
as those studied by Hojsak et al11, 
 
12  
in a subgroup analysis13 and an 
analysis not adjusted for age.15 In

both of these studies, the probiotic 
LGG was administered daily for 7 
months but in a lower dose (1–2 × 
108 CFU per day) than in our study. 
A preventive effect on infections 
has also been suggested in child 
care studies in which researchers 
examined other probiotic strains 
than those in the current study. For 
example, a 6-month intervention 
with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 
17 938 resulted in a significant 
reduction in both frequency and 
duration of diarrhea and respiratory 
tract infections in 6- to 36-month-
old children, 
21 and Lactobacillus 
acidophilus NCFM alone or in 
combination with B animalis subsp 
lactis Bi-07 reduced influenza-
like symptoms such as fever and 
rhinorrhea in children aged 3 to

a Values are median (IQR) or n (%).
b All randomly assigned children with data on outcome (of 290 randomly assigned children, no data are available for 5 children who dropped out before intervention started, and data are 
additionally missing for 2 children for the primary outcome because of dropout before starting child care). N = 283–285.
c Estimates are presented as the number of days or episodes (back-transformed to original scale) and analyzed by using Poisson regression with robust SEs and the duration of 
intervention as an offset (duration of intervention after starting day care for primary outcome) unless otherwise stated. Sex, age, intervention year, and enrollment period within each 
year are included as covariates.
d Binary outcomes are analyzed by using logistic regression. Sex, age, intervention year, duration of intervention, and enrollment period within each year are included as covariates.
e Doctor-diagnosed URTIs (eg, sinusitis, sore throat, otitis media, and pseudo croup) and LRTIs (eg, pneumonia and bronchitis).
f Only infants with ≥1 episode of diarrhea were included in analysis. An estimate is given as the number of episodes and analyzed by using mixed Poisson regression with child as a random 
effect. Sex, age, intervention year, and enrollment period within each year are included as fixed effects.

5 years.26 The explanation as to 
why results between studies are 
inconclusive could be related to 
several factors, such as the duration 
of studies, the probiotic dose, the 
ages of participants, and strain-
specific effects. Recent meta-analyses 
showed that the LGG probiotic was 
most effective in the treatment of 
acute gastroenteritis in doses of 1010 
CFU per day or more.28 Although the 
dose dependency seems less clear 
in the prevention of respiratory and 
gastrointestinal infections, the dose 
of 2 × 109 CFU per day used in the 
current study may be too low to show 
a potential beneficial effect.
The infants in our study were on 
average 10 months old at baseline, 
and 47.4% were still breastfeeding. 
The average age of termination of 
breastfeeding for these infants was 
12.1 months (SD: 1.6). In contrast, 
Smerud et al18 and Weizman et al17 
only included infants who were 
not breastfed at baseline. The age 
of the children in other studies in 
child care centers were older than 
1 year.11 
–13, 
 
15 Breast milk is an 
important factor in the developing 
immune system and in the 
protection against infections during 
infancy, and it contains numerous 
components that are thought to 
modulate immunologic responses, 
such as cytokines, oligosaccharides, 
leukocytes, and immunoglobulin A.36 
Also, 68.1% of the infants received 
infant formula from baseline to an 
average age of 12.8 months (SD: 
1.4), with 33.5% of the formulas 
supplemented with probiotics 
and 57.2% supplemented with 
prebiotics. Parents were instructed 
not to provide the infants with other 
supplements or yogurt products 
with added probiotics, but because 
products with probiotics are widely 
available in Denmark, it cannot be 
ruled out that the infants consumed 
other products supplemented with 
probiotics. Products with prebiotics 
were not prohibited during the 
study, and prebiotics have been 
shown to promote growth, especially 
of bifidobacterium in the gut.37 A 
potential immunoprotective effect of 
breastfeeding and/or probiotics and 
prebiotics may thus have reduced the 
power of the current study. Another 
important consideration is that the 
infants were of generally good health, 
and the families were recruited 
after replying to an invitation. This 
resulted in a self-selected population 
of primarily well-educated, high-
income families with a special 
interest in the study. Considering the 
aforementioned factors, the results 
from this study cannot be readily 
extrapolated to children in other age 
groups or in different settings.
A strength of this study is the low 
drop-out rate of 8.7%, which was 
considerably lower than expected. 
Self-reported compliance was 
high, and comprehensive daily and 
weekly records of infant illness were 
collected with limited missing data 
(∼6%), showing no indication of a 
differential bias between groups. 
Besides missing data, a limitation 
of the current study is that data on 
infant illness were collected by using 
parental questionnaires. Although 
parents were instructed only to 
report URTIs and LRTIs if diagnosed 
by a doctor, etiology of illness and the 
rate of bacterial and viral infections 
could not be confirmed. However, 
the ProbiComp study was performed 
in a real-life setting, and the use of 
parent-reported information may 
thus reflect the effectiveness of the 
intervention, which is highly relevant 
in a public health perspective.
cOnclusIOns
A daily administration of a 
combination of the probiotics BB-12 
and LGG for 6 months did not reduce 
the number of days absent from child 
care in Danish infants aged 8 to 14 
months at the time of enrollment 
in child care. This study does not 
support the use of probiotics in 
the prevention of respiratory and 
gastrointestinal infections in infants.
