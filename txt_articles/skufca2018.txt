Background: A bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix�; HPV2, GlaxoSmithKline) was introduced into the Finnish
national vaccination programme (NVP) in November 2013 for girls aged 11–13 years with a catch-up for
14–15 year-olds. We evaluated the association between HPV2 and selected autoimmune diseases and
clinical syndromes by conducting a nation-wide retrospective register-based cohort study.
Methods: First life-time occurrences of the relevant ICD-10 codes in girls aged 11–15 years between Nov-
2013 and Dec-2016 were obtained from the national hospital discharge register. Population denomina-
tors were obtained from the Population Information System and vaccination records from the National
Vaccination Register. Registers were linked using unique personal identity codes. Association between
HPV2 and 38 selected outcomes were studied using Cox regression, with age as the main time-scale
and the first vaccination dose as the time-dependent exposure. The hazard ratios (HR) with 95%CI were
assessed according to the time since exposure (entire follow-up, 0-180/181-365/>365 days).
Results: Of 240 605 girls eligible for HPV2 vaccination, 134 615 (56%) were vaccinated. After adjustment
for geographical area (6 hospital districts), country of origin (Finnish-born/not) and number of hospital
contacts from 9 through 10 years of age, HRs ranged from 0.34 (95%CI 0.11–1.05) to 8.37 (95%CI
0.85–82.54) and HPV2 vaccination was not statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of
any outcome during the entire follow-up.
Conclusions: This study found no significantly increased risk for the selected outcomes after the HPV
vaccination in girls 11–15 years of age. These results provide valid evidence to counterbalance public
scepticism, fears of adverse events and possible opposition to HPV vaccination and consequently can
contribute to increase HPV vaccination coverage in Finland as well as elsewhere.

1. Introduction
Concerns about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine related
adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) are common
among the adolescent females, their parents and health profession-
als around the world [1–4]. These concerns are frequently sup-
ported by anti-vaccination groups, spread in social media, and
are also caught by the media, which has led to negative publicity
about the vaccinations and coverage drop in many countries [5,6].
However, the available pre- and post-licensure data demon-
strate acceptable safety of HPV vaccines, and the World Health
Organization (WHO) [7] and the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) [8] recommend HPV vaccinations to prevent the cervical
cancer and other HPV-related diseases.
In November 2013, a school-based HPV vaccination with a biva-
lent HPV vaccine (Cervarix�; HPV2, GlaxoSmithKline) given in
three doses (0, 2, 6 months) to 11–13 year-old females and
catch-up in 14–15 year-olds was implemented in the Finnish
national vaccination programme (NVP). The Finnish Medicine
Agency (FIMEA) receives notifications about the AEFIs following
the HPV vaccination from healthcare professionals and patients,
who are advised to report suspected adverse reactions to vaccines
that come to their knowledge. These notifications are intended to

 provide early safety signals, but this passive reporting system is
subject to reporting biases and cannot prove causal association
with vaccinations.
To evaluate the association of HPV2 with a large number of
potential AEFIs, we assessed the baseline incidences of selected
outcomes and conducted an observational retrospective nation-
wide register-based cohort study.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Outcomes
We selected potential AEFIs with the diagnoses according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 (ICD-10) [9].
Our selection of the outcomes was based on previous research
[6,10,11], media reports on HPV safety and discussions on the
use of the ICD-10 codes with clinicians in Finland. We included
diagnoses
of
immunological
diseases,
disease
syndromes
of
unknown etiology and general symptoms, including the diseases
alleged to be AEFIs in the media, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS) and the non-specific diagnostic entities, such as complex
regional pain syndrome (CRPS), chronic fatigue syndrome/systemic
exertion intolerance disease (CFS/SEID) and postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome (POTS). (see Supplementary Table 1 for all
outcomes with ICD-10 codes)

2.2. Data sources
The population denominators were obtained through the
Finnish Population Information System [12] with information on
the personal identity code (PIC), sex, age, death, immigration
to Finland, date of birth and area of residence. The individual
follow-up times for each citizen were used in the cohort study
and average yearly age-and sex-specific population estimates for
the baseline calculations.
Exposure data on vaccinations was obtained from the Finnish
National Vaccination Register (NVR), available since 2011 at the
THL. Exposure time started on the day of the first dose of HPV vac-
cine regardless of receiving following doses. The NVR includes
information on PIC, sex, age, date of birth, the date, type and dose
of HPV vaccine, and hospital district information. Based on the NVR
records, the first-dose vaccine uptake has ranged by birth cohorts
between 64 and 73% in females and 0% in males [13]. Before the
HPV introduction into the NVP, approximately 30,000 doses were
administered since 2006 on girls/parents’ own initiative at own
cost. Persons who have been vaccinated in clinical trials before
the NVP are not included in this study (birth cohorts born
1992–1995) [14]. Based on the national sales data, approximately
5400 doses were sold outside of the NVP between 2013 and
2016. With a 3-dose schedule, the number of HPV vaccinated (of
any age) was 1800 during this time period [15].
Outcome data was obtained from the national hospital dis-
charge register (HILMO) with the individual information for all
hospital visits including outpatient visits and inpatient hospitaliza-
tions. Since 1996 HILMO contains comprehensive records on inpa-
tients with ICD-10 codes and since 1998 also outpatient visits. The
basic variables include PIC, area of residence, ICD-10 codes, admis-
sion, discharge, and outpatient visit dates. We have previously
used this register for a baseline study of the GBS, CFS/SEID and
POTS [16].
Data on confounding variables were obtained from the Finnish
Population Information System on the geographical area and
country of origin, and from HILMO on the number of hospital visits
from 9 through 10 years of age.
To assess the primary health care resource use in vaccinated
and non-vaccinated females from 9 through 10 years of age, we
used
the
National
Register
of
Primary
Health
Care
Visits
(AvoHILMO). Since 2011, AvoHILMO contains records on outpa-
tient care from all public health care centers in Finland with
assigned ICD-10 codes or the International Classification of
Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2) codes [17].
We used the unique and permanent PIC number allocated to all
permanent inhabitants of Finland to link information from the
different national registers.
The study was approved by the Institutional review board of
THL and the permission to use the data was provided by the
register controller at THL.
3. Statistical analysis
First, we calculated annual baseline incidence rates per 100,000
person-years (IRs) for 65 selected outcomes in female and male
populations
of
age
11–15 years
residing
in
Finland
during
2002–2016. We also evaluated incidence rate ratio (IRR) with
95% confidence intervals (95%CI) comparing sex-specific IRs in
the pre-vaccination (PreV) period from January 2009 through
October 2013, with the post-vaccination period (PostV) from
November 2013 through December 2016.
We then carried out a nation-wide population-based observa-
tional retrospective register cohort study, comparing the risk of
the outcomes between females exposed and not exposed to
HPV2. Given the low number of the cases for some outcomes stud-
ied in the baseline analyses, we included only outcomes with at
least 5 vaccinated cases for further assessment in the cohort study,
resulting in a total of 38 outcomes. We defined the outcome as the
first occurrence of the ICD-10 diagnosis in any discharge notifica-
tion in any position (first and secondary diagnoses collected).
The cohort included all individuals eligible for HPV2 through
the NVP during the PostV period, i.e. females of age 11–15 years
and residing in Finland (n = 240,650). Follow-up started from the
11-year birthday or 1 November 2013, whichever came last. The
females in the cohort were followed until the first outcome diagno-
sis, death, 16th birthday, or 31 December 2016, whichever came
first. Subjects with any life-time occurrence of the outcome diag-
nosis before the start of the follow-up were excluded from the
specific outcome analysis. To ensure complete information on
medical history from HILMO, we excluded females who immi-
grated to Finland later than they turned 2 years (n = 13,433), and
also those who were vaccinated with the first HPV2 dose (n = 9)
before and those vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine
(GardasilTM, Merck and Co., n = 57) during the follow-up time.
We used Cox regression to study the association of HPV2 and
the selected outcomes. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95%CIs were estimated for each outcome. We used stratified
Cox models with birth cohorts as strata and age in years as the
main time scale. The 95%CIs and Wald tests were used to test for
significance of the effects in the model. Vaccination status (first
dose) was used as time-dependent covariate and the exposed
follow-up time started at the date of the vaccination. We assessed
the hazards for the selected outcomes according to the time since
the first vaccination exposure, i.e. 0–180 days, 181–365 days, more
than 365 days and entire follow-up (overall). In addition, we did
sensitivity analysis, excluding subjects living in communities with
incomplete reporting of vaccination data to the NVR (<2% of the
population) [18].
All models were adjusted for hospital district (N = 6), country
background (born abroad or in Finland) and number of any

 hospital visits or admissions (0; 1;2; 3–4; 5–6; �7) two years
before the scheduled vaccination, i.e. when the females were 9–
10 years of age.
The number of primary healthcare visits (0; 1;2; 3–4; 5–6; �7)
at 9–10 years of age included physical visits in outpatient, school,
student and work health services. The significance in distribution
of health care use between vaccinated and non-vaccinated was
tested by the Wilcoxon-type trend test.
For the data analysis we used the Stata software package, Ver-
sion 15 (USA: StataCorp LP) and the R software package [19].
4. Results
Out of a total of 240,605 persons followed over 453,676 person-
years during PostV period in females aged 11–15 years, we identi-
fied 3730 cases for the 65 outcomes. The IRs spanned from 0.0 (acute
rheumatic fever, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Reiter
´s dis-
ease) to 250.8 per 100,000 person-years (asthma). For 8 outcomes
a significant IRR between PostV and PreV was observed (Fig. 1, Sup-
plementary Table 2). However, for 5 outcomes, a similar increase
was observed among males, for 1 outcome (celiac disease) signifi-
cance was very weak and for the remaining 2 outcomes (other par-
alytic syndromes and polyarteritis nodosa), the number of cases was
very low. Moreover, except for the unspecified illnesses, an increas-
ing trend of the IR was observed already before 2013.
There was no significant increase of the IRs in the PostV for the
CRPS, GBS and POTS but the CFS/SEID showed an increase (IRR 2.0).
However, a similar increase was observed in males (IRR 2.1)
(Fig. 2).
The characteristics of our cohort, females aged 11–15 years eli-
gible for the HPV2 vaccination in the NVP from November 2013
through December 2016, are shown in Table 1. Of 240,605 eligible
females, 134,615 (55.9%) were vaccinated with variations among
the birth cohorts: year 1997 (4.8%); 1998 (59.5%); 1999 (63.1%);
2000 (65.6%); 2001 (65.8%); 2002 (71.0%); 2003 (68.3%); 2004
(63.5%); 2005 (0.4%). The Northern Finland had the lowest HPV2
coverage (48.3%) and coverage was higher among Finnish born
females (57.2%) compared to non-Finnish (37.6%). The vaccinated
group had had less hospital and primary healthcare visits com-
pared to the non-vaccinated group (p < 0.001).
The adjusted HRs for the entire follow-up ranged from 0.34
(95%CI 0.11–1.05) to 8.37 (95%CI 0.85–82.54) across the 38
outcomes among the vaccinated in relation to the unvaccinated,
of which 17 had an overall adjusted HR equal or above one. How-
ever, the 95%CIs and the overall Wald test (p > 0.05) showed that
HPV2 was not significantly associated with an increased risk for
any of the 38 outcomes (Fig. 3).
There were in total 4 outcomes for which the adjusted HR was
statistically significantly below one for the overall period (CFS/
SEID, epilepsy and recurrent seizures, Henoch-Schonlein
´ s purpura,
malaise/fatigue) and for 3 additional outcomes in other exposure
windows (autism, idiopatic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other
hyperthyroidism). There were 3 outcomes for which the adjusted
HRs in other exposure windows were above one, but all 3 out-
comes had very low numbers in vaccinated (N = 5 or 6) and there-
fore wide 95%CIs: GBS (HR = 32.17, 95%CI 1.59–652.4) within more
than 365 days, myositis (HR = 7.46, 95%CI 1.00–55.39) and pancre-
atitis (HR = 20.28, 95%CI 1.66–247.9) within 181–366 days after
the vaccination. However, the overall Wald tests for the HRs being
equal to one when comparing all exposure-periods (simultaneous
test) were not significant (p = 0.9, p = 0.2 and p = 0.7, respectively)
(see Supplementary Table 3 for HRs in all outcomes).
For the unspecified illnesses, which increased during the post-
vaccination periodthe overall adjusted
HR
(HR = 0.66,
95%CI
0.48–0.90) was lower than one in the cohort analysis. None of
the 8 outcomes with significant increase of IRs in females in the
PostV period compared to PreV period (Fig. 1) was associated with
the HPV2.
The
sensitivity
analysis
by
excluding
municipalities
with
incomplete reporting of the vaccination data did not change the
estimates of our HRs.
5. Discussion
This was the first safety evaluation in Finland after the HPV2
vaccine was introduced into the NVP, evaluating the risk of the
pre-selected
outcomes. In this nation-wide population-based
cohort study, exposure to HPV2 was not associated with increased
occurrence of the evaluated autoimmune diseases and other clini-
cal syndromes.
Our results are in line with many other studies, which showed
no risk for AEFIs following HPV2 vaccination in studies before
licensure [20–22] and after [23–25], including large population-
based cohort studies on HPV2 [6,11] and studies on quadrivalent

 (HPV4) vaccine [10,26–27]. However, although multiple studies
and reviews by the EMA [8] and the WHO [7] confirm the safety
of HPV vaccines, due to limited evidence, the causal link is still
being discussed [28–29]. Two French studies have found an associ-
ation of GBS with the HPV4 vaccine [6,11], while others did not
[30–31]. In our study, only a low number of GBS cases was
detected. The results were statistically non significant, but after
more than 365 days the adjusted HR was substantially increased,
but with very wide 95%CIs: (HR = 32.17, 95%CI 1.59–652.4). The
period during which any true increase would be expected is in
the first 6–8 weeks after the vaccination.
Some studies reported association of HPV vaccines with the
CFS/SEID [2,32], CRPS [33] and POTS [2,32–34], while others, in line
with our results, did not [35–37]. The CFS/SEID was negatively
associated with the HPV2 in our study.
A major strength of this study was that we included individual
level data of the entire population in Finland with data from all
hospitals in Finland and thus reduced the risk of selection bias. Fur-
thermore, the national health insurance assures equal access to
care for all Finnish citizens and persons permanently residing in
Finland. We took the whole history of the subjects into account
as we included only the first incident life-time occurrence of the
diagnosis. The HILMO and NVR registers are considered close to
complete due to the mandatory reporting and because HPV2 are
administered through the public school-based system. Some sub-
jects without vaccination records, and considered unexposed in
this study, may have been vaccinated in the private health care
before the NVP, or could be missed due to incomplete reporting.
After the NVP, it is highly unlikely that females eligible for the free
NVP would pay for the expensive vaccination; this is supported by
our sensitivity analysis excluding subjects from municipalities
with incomplete reporting which did not change the results.
We also evaluated baseline sex-specific incidence rates of a large
number of outcomes (n = 65). Although increases of the IRs for
some outcomes after the HPV2 introduction were observed, no sig-
nificant association with HPV2 was found in the cohort study.
Therefore, these increases most likely happened due to other
causes, by changes in the diagnostic practices or by chance alone.

 The limitation of this study is that the register data were not
validated; we used routine vaccination data and diagnoses as set
by the treating physicians. However, we consider the exposure
data, i.e. vaccinations, highly specific, with a low number of false
positives. On the other hand, for the outcome data we have prob-
ably some misclassification including both false positive and false
negative outcomes. Especially the ill-defined syndromes (CFS/SEID,
CRPS, POTS) with overlapping clinical features can be under-
reported because these are misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all.
To be as precise as possible in the selection of the ICD-10 codes
for these outcomes, we had multiple discussions on the use of
codes with the Finnish clinicians. We decided for a broad definition
to identify cases in a sensitive manner to ensure adequate number
of cases and to evaluate the public health impact of the potential
adverse outcomes. Therefore, we also included the ICD-10 codes
from the R-chapter with symptoms without specific diseases
codes. Misclassification of the outcome may thus result in false
positive diagnoses which may mask true associations due to poor
specificity of the outcome. All the HRs for the ill-defined syn-
dromes were below one, and therefore any misclassification should
be major to mask any potential true association. While for most of
the diagnoses any potential misclassification is likely symmetric

 between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated, the above-mentioned
ill-defined syndromes have been associated with vaccinations by
the media, and therefore, vaccinated subjects might have been
diagnosed more commonly with these syndromes resulting in false
positive results due to bias; however, this was not observed in our
results.
Another limitation was that the less severe cases diagnosed and
treated in the outpatient settings only were missed. We did not
include primary care data because the diagnostic coding was not
consistent (both ICD-10 codes and ICPC-2 codes have been used)
during the follow-up periods across the country and it did not
include the private outpatient care.
In vaccine safety studies it is important to consider also the pre-
vious medical history of the subjects [38]. We observed that
females with more frequent hospital and primary healthcare visits
were less likely to be vaccinated, in line with the Norwegian study
[35], although the proportions of visits between the vaccinated and
non-vaccinated were not very different. Those with unexplained or
serious illness might more likely object to the vaccination, which
may result in the healthy vaccinee bias [39]. We observed 5 of

 38 outcomes inversely associated with the HPV2, a phenomenon
reported also elsewhere [10,23]. The observed reduced risk among
the HPV2 vaccinated females might have happened because they
might have had better baseline health or healthier lifestyle. We
aimed to reduce the healthy vaccinee bias by adjusting for the
number of hospital visits. In addition, we adjusted our estimates
for the baseline factors, including age and hospital geographic area.
However, inclusion of primary healthcare visits was not included
in the model as it did not affect the estimates. Additional adjust-
ments might reduce potential confounding further, but we did
not have individual data on these. Additionally, we excluded the
subjects diagnosed with the outcome of interest before the study
follow-up. This should reduce the probability of healthy vaccinee
bias, although the incident cases might have had other prior diag-
noses which might also cause healthy vaccinee bias despite adjust-
ment for prior hospital visits. As in any observational study,
residual confounding may be present. We did however use the best
available information on healthcare utilization (Finnish national
hospital discharge register), which includes all inpatient and out-
patient visits in all Finnish hospitals. A true protective effect may
be possible [40] although, to date, the findings about the non-
specific effects of vaccines are controversial after live vaccines
and have been observed mainly for infectious diseases [41].
The associations found could be also due to the alfa error
because of multiplicity testing bias [42], which was unavoidable
because we studied so many outcomes. We tried to reduce the bias
by using Wald (simultaneous tests) for different periods after vac-
cination but did not use the Bonferroni correction because it may
result in too conservative estimates [43] and could hide some weak
signals that we aimed at finding in this explorative analysis. On the
other hand, most of the outcome event numbers were small result-
ing in inadequate power to detect any potential true associations.
Therefore, we need to await further accumulation of follow-up
data.
6. Conclusions
No significant association between the bivalent HPV vaccine
and risk of multiple AEFIs was observed. This large nationwide
study supports other studies on the safety of the HPV vaccination
and conclusions made by EMA [12] and WHO [11]. Our results
can serve as a source of information for communication by the Fin-
nish public health authorities to improve public acceptance of the
vaccination and consequently contribute to higher HPV immuniza-
tion coverage and lower HPV-related disease burden in Finland.
