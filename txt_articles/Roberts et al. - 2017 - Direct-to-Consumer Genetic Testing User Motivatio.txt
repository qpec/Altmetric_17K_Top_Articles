 < 0.05). After receiving results, 
59% of respondents said test information would influence 
management of their health; 2% reported regret about seek-
ing testing and 1% reported harm from results.  
Conclusion: 
DTC-PGT has attracted controversy because of the health-
related information it provides, but nonmedical information 
is of equal or greater interest to consumers. Although many 
consumers did not fully consider potential risks prior to test-
ing, DTC-PGT was generally perceived as useful in informing 
future health decisions.

Introduction 
 
The direct-to-consumer (DTC) offering of personal 
genomic testing (PGT) has generated controversy ever 
since its introduction, with concerns raised about its po-
tential harms and limitations  
[1] 
. Such concerns often re-
late to the fact that DTC-PGT services are typically pro-
vided without a medical intermediary (e.g., an ordering

Abstract 
 
Background/Aims: 
 To describe the interests, decision mak-
ing, and responses of consumers of direct-to-consumer per-
sonal genomic testing (DTC-PGT) services.  
Methods: Prior to 
2013 regulatory restrictions on DTC-PGT services, 1,648 con-
sumers from 2 leading companies completed Web surveys 
before and after receiving test results.  
Results: 
 Prior to test-
ing, DTC-PGT consumers were as interested in ancestry (74% 
very interested) and trait information (72%) as they were in 
disease risks (72%). Among disease risks, heart disease (68% 
very interested), breast cancer (67%), and Alzheimer disease 
(66%) were of greatest interest prior to testing. Interest in 
disease risks was associated with female gender and poorer 
self-reported health ( 
p < 0.01). Many consumers (38%) did 
not consider the possibility of unwanted information before 
purchasing services; this group was more likely to be older,

physician or genetic counselor), and the types of tests of-
fered (e.g., susceptibility tests for common diseases) are 
neither available in genetics clinics nor considered stan-
dard of care. Advocates of a DTC approach view regula-
tory restrictions based on such concerns as unwarranted 
paternalism  
[2] 
, and they point to the potential of DTC-
PGT to expand access to personal health information, in-
form future plans, and motivate disease prevention ef-
forts  
[3] 
. Many professional organizations, however, have 
criticized the validity and utility of the health-related in-
formation provided and expressed concerns about neg-
ative downstream consequences should consumers or 
their health-care providers misinterpret such informa-
tion  
[4–6] 
. The US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)’
s November 2013 warning letter to one major pro-
vider of PGT services noted concerns about the disclosure 
of pharmacogenomic and  
BRCA 1/2  
mutation results in 
particular  
[7] 
, and this action resulted in the temporary 
discontinuation of this company’
s marketing of services, 
as well as a reduction in the types of genetic tests offered. 
Reactions were mixed, with medical and public health ex-
perts generally applauding the intervention  
[8] 
, while 
some academic commentators viewed the FDA action as 
regulatory overreach  
[9] 
.
 
There is one area, however, where stakeholders on 
both sides of the debate are generally in agreement. That 
is, more data on the experience of PGT consumers could 
illuminate future practice and policy. A recent review of 
empirical studies in this area was conducted that included 
39 articles representing (1) content analyses of DTC-PGT 
websites, (2) studies of consumer perspectives and expe-
riences (e.g., test motivations and interests, comprehen-
sion of test results, psychological and behavioral impact 
of testing), and (3) studies of health-care provider per-
spectives (e.g., genetic counselors, primary care physi-
cians)  
[10] 
. The review concluded that neither the health 
benefits envisioned by DTC-PGT proponents (e.g., sig-
nificant improvements in positive health behaviors) nor 
the worst fears expressed by its critics (e.g., widespread 
psychological harms and misunderstanding of test re-
sults, undue burden on the health-care system from un-
necessary clinical follow-up) have materialized to date. 
However, the review also noted that extant research in 
this area has significant limitations. For example, some 
studies have examined responses to hypothetical instead 
of actual PGT scenarios or provision of PGT information 
in a controlled research context, as opposed to consumer 
services available on the open market  
[11, 12] 
. Studies 
have also been limited by low response rates, small sample 
sizes, an absence of data collection at baseline (i.e., prior 
to receiving one’
s test results), and/or an inability to link 
participants’
 responses to their actual genetic testing re-
sults  
[13] 
.
 
To help address these gaps in the literature, we initi-
ated the Impact of Personal Genomics Study (PGen). 
This longitudinal survey of consumers of 2 PGT compa-
nies examines respondents’
 appraisal of DTC-PGT ser-
vices and their responses to their own personalized test 
results  
[14, 15] 
. In an effort to inform practice and policy 
in this contentious area of personal genomics, the goals 
of this study include better understanding of (1) who ob-
tains DTC-PGT, (2) how they decide to seek such ser-
vices, and (3) what benefits, harms, and limitations they 
perceive in DTC-PGT after undergoing testing. In this 
analysis, we address the following specific questions: 
What are the demographic and health-related character-
istics of PGT consumers? What motivations do they cite 
for seeking such services, and what factors do they con-
sider (or not) in their test decisions? Finally, how useful 
do they find this information and in what ways?
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Participants and Procedures 
 
Detailed description of the PGen Study methods can be found 
elsewhere  
[16] 
, with a brief summary provided here. Study par-
ticipants were new customers of 23andMe, Inc. (23andMe) and 
Pathway Genomics Corporation (Pathway) enrolled between 
March and July 2012. Throughout this period of data collection, 
23andMe provided PGT services via a DTC model, disclosing a 
much wider range of genetic disease risk and pharmacogenomic 
information than currently offered in their services. A total of 
3,900 new 23andMe customers received an e-mail from the com-
pany that included an overview of the study and an invitation to 
participate in the longitudinal set of PGen surveys.
 
 
Just prior to the start of data collection for the PGen Study, 
Pathway Genomics shifted from a DTC to a physician-mediated 
approach, whereby its services were still advertised online, but the 
company now required the consumer’
s physician to both order 
and return the results of testing. To ensure all PGen survey par-
ticipants were reporting on a DTC-PGT experience, a modified 
service model was created for the purposes of this study; Pathway 
users were recruited primarily through banner advertisements and 
e-mails to members of the PatientsLikeMe health-based social net-
working site, offered a subsidized testing price (USD 25), and per-
mitted to order PGT without physician mediation.
 
Data from consumers of both companies were collected via a 
series of 3 Web surveys administered by Survey Sciences Group 
(SSG; now SoundRocket), a third party survey research firm. Im-
mediately after purchasing testing services, interested customers 
were brought to a Web page describing the study’
s purpose, assur-
ing participants of data privacy and confidentiality, and inviting 
them to participate. After consenting, participants were able to ac-
cess the study’
s baseline (BL) survey, which occurred after partici-

pants had purchased testing but before they received test results. 
Within 2–3 weeks (2W) following receipt of their individual results, 
participants who said they had viewed their results were sent a fol-
low-up survey asking about their reactions to PGT information. A 
third survey was administered at 6 months (6M) following consum-
ers’
 receipt of PGT results. Institutional Review Boards at Brigham 
& Women’
s Hospital and the University of Michigan reviewed and 
approved this study. As part of the informed consent process, par-
ticipants agreed to the publication of aggregate survey data.
 
Measures 
 
Overview 
 
As noted above, the PGen Study involved a series of longitudi-
nal surveys administered both before and after consumers learned 
their DTC-PGT results. An interdisciplinary team of academic and 
industry scientists developed a battery of measures to be used in 
the study, drawing upon expertise in disciplines including survey 
methodology, medical genetics, genetic counseling, health psy-
chology, health services research, and medical decision making. 
Questionnaires incorporated both validated measures and novel 
survey items created specifically for the purposes of this study. De-
velopment of the latter included pilot testing in a small conve-
nience sample of adults, with standard cognitive interviewing 
techniques used to inform modifications to question wording and 
response choices. The BL, 2W, and 6M surveys consisted of 240, 
77, and 248 questions, respectively, with median response times 
across the surveys ranging from 22 to 32 min. However, we report 
here on only a subset of the measures administered in the larger 
PGen Study, as summarized in  
Table 1 
. The reader is referred to 
our previously published work for findings on other study out-
comes including comprehension of test results  
[14] 
, changes in 
disease risk perceptions  
[17] 
, changes in prescription medication 
use  
[18] 
, and use of primary care services following testing  
[19] 
.
 
Sociodemographic Information 
 
Demographic characteristics were ascertained using self-report 
items assessing age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, em-
ployment status, and household income.
 
Health-Related Information 
 
Self-rated health was assessed by a standard self-report item 
 
[20] asking participants to rate their health on a 5-point scale (1 = 
poor to 5 = excellent).
 
Body mass index (BMI) was assessed by using participants’
 self-
reported height and weight to calculate a ratio based on standard 
criteria  
[21] 
. Based on their BMI score, participants were then clas-
sified as underweight (12.0–18.4), normal (18.5–24.9), overweight 
(25–29.9), or obese (30 or more).
 
Smoking status was assessed by asking participants if, and how 
often, they currently smoked cigarettes. Those endorsing the 
“some days” or “every day” response option were classified as cur-
rent smokers.
 
Current screening practices were assessed by asking partici-
pants whether they had undergone various disease screening tests 
within the past year (and if not, whether they had ever undergone 
screening). Examples included mammography, colonoscopy, and 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests.
 
Prior experience with genetic services was assessed by asking 
participants whether or not they had previously undergone ge-
netic testing (other than newborn screening), met with a clinical 
genetics specialist, or purchased personal genomics services from 
another company.
 
Insurance status was assessed by asking participants whether or 
not they currently held health, life, disability, or long-term care 
insurance policies.
 
Test Motivations and Interests 
 
Participants were asked at BL about their level of interest (1 = 
not at all interested, 2 = somewhat interested, 3 = very interested) 
in various types of genetic information provided by the 2 compa-
nies, including ancestry, disease risks, carrier screening, medica-
tion response, and trait information (this latter option was pro-
vided only by 23andMe).
 
 
Participants were also asked about their level of interest (1 = 
not at all interested, 2 = somewhat interested, 3 = very interested) 
in learning about their genetic risk for numerous specific condi-
tions provided in the companies’
 services. A composite measure of 
interest in disease-specific risks was created by summing respons-
es to questions about 16 distinct conditions (range: 16–48, with 
higher scores indicating greater overall interest). Cronbach’
s α for 
this measure was 0.91.
 
Decision Making 
 
Participants were asked at BL about the extent to which they 
had considered (1 = did not consider, 2 = considered somewhat,
3 = considered a lot) issues related to their decision to purchase

Some characteristics were assessed with slightly different survey items in the PGen versus BRFSS studies. For 
example, BRFSS classified as current smokers those who endorsed a “currently smoke” response, whereas in PGen 
current smokers were those who answered that they smoke cigarettes “some days” or “every day”. Cancer 
screening was assessed in PGen by asking participants whether they had completed screening either “within the 
past year” or “more than a year ago”; in BRFSS, participants were asked about “within the past 2 years”. For 
employment status, participants were given the response option of “unable to work” (6.1%) on the BRFSS but 
not the PGen survey. F, female; M, male; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; n.a., not available.

personal genomics services. Testing considerations included test 
cost, convenience, predictive value of test information, company 
education materials, available treatment options for conditions 
tested, information privacy, and the possibility of unwanted infor-
mation. Participants were also asked if they had received PGT as
a gift.
 
As part of the 6M survey, participants were administered a val-
idated measure of decisional regret  
[22] assessing the extent to 
which respondents experienced regret or harm following their de-
cision to pursue testing (range: 0–100, with higher scores indicat-
ing greater levels of decisional regret). Cronbach’
s α for this mea-
sure was 0.87.
 
Perceived Utility of Results 
 
As part of the 2W survey, participants were surveyed regarding 
their perceptions of the utility of services and satisfaction with in-
formation provided. Responded were asked to indicate their level 
of agreement (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) with 8 
statements, with responses summed to create a composite measure 
(range: 8–40, with higher scores indicating greater perceived util-
ity). Cronbach’
s α for this measure was 0.85.
 
Data Analyses 
 
Descriptive statistics characterized the sample in terms of its 
demographics, health-related experiences, and other question-
naire responses. Participants’
 demographic characteristics and 
health-related information were compared to data collected as part 
of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a na-
tionwide surveillance system established by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention  
[23] 
. Comparisons to the US general 
population were sought given that both the PGT companies and 
the vast majority of their consumers are based in the US.
 
Associations between demographic variables and outcomes of 
interest were examined using linear or logistic regression. Models 
included as their dependent variable either a composite outcome 
measure of interest (interest in disease-specific risks; perceived 
utility of results) or whether or not participants had reported “not 
at all” considering the possibility of unwanted information when 
deciding about testing. The following predictors were included in 
each regression model: age (categorized as 18–34, 35–54, or  
≥ 
55 
years old), gender, race/ethnicity (white vs. nonwhite), level of ed-
ucation ( 
≤ 
high school or some college, college degree, or graduate 
degree), company (Pathway or 23andMe), and health status (good/
very good/excellent vs. fair/poor). A significance level of  
p < 0.05 
was used in analyses, which were conducted using SPSS statistical 
software version 21.
 
Results 
 
A total of 1,648 participants completed the BL survey, 
including 1,085 customers (65.8%) from 23andMe and 
563 (34.2%) from Pathway. Of these, 1,046 completed the 
2W survey and 1,042 completed the 6M survey. Survey 
respondents from 23andMe were similar to the broader 
sample of 3,900 23andMe consumers invited to the study 
in terms of age (mean = 50.1 ± 15.8 vs. 51.0 ± 15.9 years), 
but our survey respondents were slightly more likely to be 
female (56.8 vs. 47.8%;  
p < 0.0001). Data were not avail-
able to compare Pathway survey invitees versus respond-
ers.
 
Table 2 summarizes participants’
 sociodemographic 
and health-related characteristics. In brief, the sample 
was largely middle aged (mean age = 47.8 years, SD = 
15.6), and a majority were white (90.0%) and female 
(60.4%). The median educational level was college gradu-
ate. Compared to the general US adult population, study 
participants were more likely to be white (90 vs. 74.7%), 
female (60.4 vs. 51.4%), and college educated (77.9 vs. 
24.2%). The vast majority (85.0%) reported good to excel-
lent health, with 23andMe customers more likely than 
Pathway customers to endorse better health status (90.9 
vs. 74.1%). Fewer than 15% (13.8%) reported prior ge-
netic testing experience in the health-care system, but 
10.3% had already purchased another type of personal ge-

netic testing (e.g., ancestry testing). Compared to the gen-
eral population, study participants were less likely to be 
overweight/obese (55.7 vs. 63.4%) or current smokers 
(8.6 vs. 19.6%), more likely to have health insurance (94.7 
vs. 79.6%), and more likely to have completed a colonos-
copy (86.6 vs. 66.8%; among respondents age 50 and 
above only).
 
Respondents’
 levels of interest in types of genetic in-
formation are reported in  
Table 3 
. The type of informa-
tion that the most participants reported being “very inter-
ested” in was ancestry (73.7%), followed closely by traits 
(72.2%, only assessed among 23andMe consumers be-
cause Pathway did not provide such information) and 
disease risks (71.9%). Significantly fewer participants re-
ported being very interested in medication response 
(52.1%) or carrier status information (30.9%). Partici-
pants’
 levels of interest in various disease risks are also 
reported in  
Table 3 
, broken down by condition. The con-
ditions about which most respondents said they were 
“very interested” in learning about their risk were (1) 
heart disease (67.8%), (2) breast cancer (66.9%; women 
only), and (3) Alzheimer disease (AD; 66.3%). A majority 
of participants also reported being very interested in 
prostate cancer (59.9%; men only), skin cancer (59.4%), 
diabetes (55.3%), and colon cancer (52.7%).
 
In terms of testing considerations involved in partici-
pants’
 decision making, the only factor that a majority 
said they “considered a lot” was “whether there are health-
related actions I can take as result of learning my informa-
tion” (51.1%). Approximately a fifth to a half of the sam-
ple said they “considered a lot” factors including the con-
venience of being tested at home (46.3%), genetic privacy 
(39.8%), predictive value of test results (30.4%), cost of 
services (29.8%), and the possibility they might receive 
unwanted information (20%). A minority said they did 
“not at all” consider the possibility they might receive un-
wanted information (37.9%), genetic privacy (20.8%), or 
the predictive value of testing (19.5%). A total of 121 par-
ticipants (7.3%) said they had received PGT services as a 
gift.
 
Overall, participants reported low levels of decisional 
regret (mean score = 7.9 out of 100) at 6 months follow-
ing receipt of PGT results. Over 93% of respondents in-
dicated that getting tested was “the right decision” for 
them, with 94% saying they would make the same deci-
sion again. Overall, 2% of respondents indicated that they 
regretted their decision to pursue testing, with 1% saying 
the decision had done them harm.
 
Respondents’
 perceptions of the utility of their results 
are summarized in  
Table 4 
. A majority of respondents 
said that results made them feel more in control of their 
health (65.8%), that they learned something new to im-
prove their health (61%), and that PGT information 
would influence how they will manage their health 
(59.4%). However, 38% agreed that they were disappoint-
ed their test results did not tell them more.
 
Table 5 summarizes regression analyses of variables 
associated with main study outcomes. Interest in disease 
risk information was higher among women, individuals 
with poor to fair self-reported health, and Pathway con-
sumers, with those with less than a college education ex-
pressing greater interest in disease risks than those with a 
professional degree or doctorate (all  
p < 0.01). Variables 
associated with greater likelihood of having considered 
the possibility of unwanted information in test decision 
making were younger age, female gender, and higher lev-

Discussion 
 
We report here on findings from one of the largest sur-
veys to date of DTC-PGT consumers. Study findings in-
dicated that compared to the general US adult popula-
tion, our sample was disproportionately female, white, 
and of higher socioeconomic status (SES). These findings 
are consistent with prior studies suggesting higher inter-
est in DTC testing among these demographic groups  
[24, 
25] 
. This sample also differed from the general US adult 
population on key health-related variables; study partici-
pants were more likely to possess health insurance, less 
likely to smoke, and less likely to be overweight or obese. 
These findings likely reflect participants’
 higher levels of 
SES and strong focus on health and wellness issues. How-
ever, it should also be noted that despite these distinc-
tions, participants did not differ markedly from the gen-
eral population in terms of certain self-reported health 
and cancer screening behaviors such as mammography 
and PSA testing.
 
 
As expected, most consumers indicated strong interest 
in learning about genetic risk information for medical 
conditions. Perhaps more notable was that consumers ex-
pressed approximately the same level of interest in ge-
netic ancestry information and traits. This finding reflects 
the broad US population interest in genealogy, where sev-
eral companies are marketing genetic testing to help in-
dividuals trace their ancestral history and link socially to 
distant relatives  
[26] 
. Consumers expressed lower levels 
of interest in pharmacogenomic (52% very interested) 
and carrier testing information (31%). This may be be-
cause these types of information are not always viewed as 
personally relevant (e.g., some consumers may not be tak-
ing prescription medications and/or may have aged be-
yond reproductive decision making), or because they are 
less familiar to consumers than other types of genetic 
tests.
 
Consumers expressed significant interest in learning 
their genetic risks for a wide range of medical conditions. 
The diseases of greatest interest tended to be common 
diseases (e.g., heart disease, breast cancer) with proven 
options for screening, treatment, and risk reduction via 
health behaviors. A notable exception was AD, where 
two-thirds of respondents said they were very interested 
in learning their risk. This level of interest is consistent 
with national surveys on public interest in genetic testing 
for AD  
[27] 
. Previous studies where  
APOE genetic test 
results have actually been disclosed to at-risk individuals 
suggest that testing is used to inform advance planning

User Responses to DTC Genetic Testing

(e.g., purchase of long-term care insurance) and engage-
ment in health behaviors viewed by test recipients (if not 
proven by scientific research) as lessening the risk of AD 
and related health conditions  
[28, 29] 
.
 
Our data on test decision making indicate that con-
sumers considered a wide range of factors (e.g., conve-
nience, types of information provided) before purchasing 
PGT services. However, these results also raise concerns 
that many decisions were made without full consideration 
of the potential risks and limitations of testing. For ex-
ample, nearly 40% of respondents said they had not con-
sidered the possibility of unwanted information prior to 
purchasing PGT services. This result, along with the find-
ing that 7% reported receiving PGT services as a gift, sug-
gests challenges in obtaining fully informed consent to ge-
netic testing in a DTC format. Consumers do provide con-
sent upon purchase of services, but unlike in clinical 
practice, the process lacks a medical intermediary to dis-
cuss and highlight potential risks, which may include un-
anticipated disease risk results. One approach that has 
been suggested to address these concerns is a tiered ap-
proach to informed consent  
[30] 
, where DTC test recipi-
ents are re-consented before potentially sensitive genetic 
results are disclosed. For example, 23andMe has used a 
format where its users are required to view educational 
materials before “unlocking” personal results that could 
indicate high risk of Parkinson disease ( 
LRRK2  
genotype), 
AD ( 
APOE 
), or hereditary breast or ovarian cancer ( 
BRCA 
1/2 
). Additional research is needed to understand quality 
of test decision making in a DTC format and to what ex-
tent consumers may be “blindsided” by genetic test infor-
mation. It should be noted, however, that unanticipated 
and distressing DTC results may still yield medical bene-
fits to test recipients and their family members  
[31] 
.
 
In a November 2013 letter to 23andMe, the US FDA 
raised concerns about potential negative health conse-
quences resulting from false positive or false negative as-
sessments for high-risk indications. Particular concern 
was noted around  
BRCA 1/2 
-related genetic risk for he-
reditary breast and ovarian cancer and certain drug re-
sponses (e.g., warfarin sensitivity). Only 2% of our re-
spondents indicated that they regretted their decision to 
pursue testing, with 1% saying the decision had done 
them harm. However, the source of the regret or type of 
harms is unknown, suggesting the need for future re-
search in this area. Given the relative rarity of  
BRCA 1/2 
 
mutation carriers and active medication users with ac-
tionable pharmacogenomic results, particularly large 
sample sizes would be needed to assess the likelihood of 
the specific risks noted in the FDA letter.
 
Consumers’
 responses upon learning their PGT infor-
mation suggest that they believed that test results would 
meaningfully inform their future health decisions and be-
haviors. Related findings from our work suggest that over 
a quarter of participants went on to share this informa-
tion with their primary care physician  
[17] 
, although it is 
unknown if and how PGT results influenced uptake of 
medical procedures and health outcomes. Despite this 
evidence that many consumers are already using or plan-
ning to use PGT results in guiding their health decisions, 
nearly 40% of respondents reported disappointment that 
their results were not more informative. Such unmet ex-
pectations appeared more likely among those reporting 
poor to fair health, a group that may have viewed PGT 
testing as a potential means of addressing or explaining 
their current health problems  
[32] 
. These results are con-
sistent with emerging findings from the literature on clin-
ical use of whole-genome sequencing, where many pa-
tients appear to overestimate the likelihood of benefit 
from current precision medicine approaches  
[33] 
. It may 
be that consumers are overrating the importance of ge-
netic contributions to disease (vs. behavioral or environ-
mental determinants) and/or that they presume current 
genetic testing technologies possess greater capabilities 
than they actually do.
 
This study possessed several strengths, including a 
large sample size and detailed assessment of participants 
who had purchased PGT from prominent providers in 
the field. However, this study also has notable limitations 
that should be kept in mind when interpreting results. All 
measures used were subject to potential self-report bi-
ases, and some questionnaire items had not been fully 
validated prior to their use. In addition, recruitment pro-
cedures (e.g., subsidized testing for Pathway customers) 
likely created selection biases such that findings may not 
fully generalize to the broader population of DTC-PGT 
users. The limited number of participants with lower lev-
els of education and income (e.g., 84% of the sample re-
ported an annual household income of USD 40,000 or 
above) makes it difficult to generalize these results to 
populations of low SES; future research in this area 
should attempt to enroll samples with greater diversity in 
terms of SES. Finally, detailed information was not avail-
able on certain outcomes of interest, such as specific ge-
netic test information that participants found particu-
larly useful and how exactly they planned to use such 
information to guide future health-care decision making 
and behaviors.
 
Many policy dilemmas continue to surround the pro-
vision of PGT in a DTC format, with much speculation

about related risks and benefits, as well as debate over 
how to strike an appropriate balance between respecting 
individual consumer autonomy and protecting against 
potential harms. This study, conducted in a recent win-
dow of time in the US where access to DTC-PGT infor-
mation was less constrained than at present, begins to 
provide insights on how consumers appraise and re-
spond to genetic test information in this context. Our 
data suggest that consumers generally find PGT infor-
mation useful and anticipate that it will be beneficial in 
guiding future health decisions, with very few consumers 
reporting harms or decisional regret. At the same time, 
our findings also suggest areas for improvement in the 
informed consent process for DTC-PGT, so that indi-
viduals undergoing testing recognize the potential for 
unwanted information and have realistic expectations 
regarding test benefits and limitations. Such findings 
could prove useful in guiding future practice and policy 
decisions in this area.
