Abstract
Background: Increased availability of low/er strength alcohol products has the potential to reduce alcohol
consumption if they are marketed as substitutes for higher strength products rather than as additional products.
The current study compares the main marketing messages conveyed by retailers and producers for low/er and
regular strength wine and beer products.
Methods: A content analysis of the marketing messages stated (in text) or depicted (in image) for low/er and
regular strength wines and beers sold online on the websites of the four main UK retailers (Tesco, ASDA,
Sainsbury’s, and Morrisons), and the producers of these products between February–March 2016.
Results: Four themes were identified: (a) suggested occasions for consumption, (b) health-related associations, (c)
alcohol content, and (d) taste. Compared with regular strength products, low/er strength equivalents were more
often marketed in association with occasions deemed to be suitable for their consumption including lunchtimes
[wine: X2(1, n = 172) = 11.75, p = .001], outdoor events/barbeques [beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 11.16, p = .001] and on sport/
fitness occasions [beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 7.55, p = .006]. Compared with regular strength wines and beers, low/er
strength equivalents were more frequently marketed with images or text associated with health. These included
images of fruit [wine: X2(1, n = 172) = 7.78, p = .005; beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 22.00, p < .001] and the provision of their
energy (calorie) content [wine: X2(1, n = 172) = 47.97, p < .001; beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 15.10, p < .001]. Low/er strength
products were also more often marketed with information about their alcohol content. There were few differences
in the marketing messages regarding taste.
Conclusions: Low/er strength wines and beers appear to be marketed not as substitutes for higher strength
products but as ones that can be consumed on additional occasions with an added implication of healthiness.

Background
Alcohol is the fifth leading cause of death and disability
globally [1]. The cost of alcohol-related harms in the UK
has been estimated at £21 billion a year, including costs
to individual drinkers, to people around them, and to so-
ciety [2]. The development, promotion and marketing of
low/er strength alcohol products is proposed as one way
of reducing alcohol consumption and associated harms
[3]. This interest is captured in the most recent UK Gov-
ernment Alcohol Strategy published in March 2012 that,
amongst other policies, included an industry pledge
through the Responsibility Deal to take one billion units
of alcohol out of the market by 2015, primarily through
increasing consumer selection of low/er strength alcohol
products [3]. However, it is disputed whether this pledge
has been met [4].
For such products to reduce consumption depends on
a number of assumptions. These include: first low/er

 strength alcoholic products being selected by consumers
in place of higher strength products as opposed to sim-
ply increasing the number of opportunities perceived
suitable for consuming alcohol (see also [5, 6]); and sec-
ond labels highlighting low/er alcohol strength not en-
gendering a self-licensing effect (i.e., giving people
permission to consume more following what might be
interpreted as a virtuous choice) resulting in the higher
overall consumption of alcohol than would have been
consumed from a higher strength product alone [7, 8].
Such effects may be mediated by the marketing mes-
sages used to sell low/er strength alcohol products.
There is a paucity of evidence regarding the marketing
of such products to the general public. The purpose of
the present study is to describe the main marketing mes-
sages used by retailers and producers of low/er strength
wine and beer products. For the purposes of the study
we defined low/er strength alcohol products as low alco-
hol products (i.e., less than 1.2% ABV including de-
alcoholised products) and lower alcohol products (i.e.,
above 1.2% ABV but less than the rate at which duty
rises - 8.5% ABV for wine and 2.8% ABV for beer). Regu-
lar strength alcohol products were defined as wines
above 8.5% ABV and beers above 2.8% ABV. Marketing
messages were defined as the messages stated in text or
depicted in images in the online marketing materials on
retailers’ and producers’ webpages (see [9]).
Methods
Aim
To describe the marketing messages stated (in text) or
depicted (in image) by retailers and producers for low/er
strength wine and beer products sold online by the four
main supermarkets in the UK during February–March
2016, and to compare these messages with those used
for comparable regular strength products.
Sample identification
Searches were conducted of the websites of the four
main
UK retailers (Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury’s, and
Morrisons) between February and March 2016 to iden-
tify webpages marketing low/er strength wines and
beers. For each webpage marketing low/er strength alco-
hol products the webpage of a comparable regular
strength alcohol product was identified on the same
website. Regular strength alcohol products which are as
similar as possible to the identified low/er strength alco-
hol products were selected for analysis. For example, if a
low/er strength rosé was identified in the initial search,
we identified a similar rosé by the same producer with
regular strength. If this was not possible, we selected a
regular strength rosé from a different producer, made
from the same grape.
Once all webpages marketing the low/er and regular
strength alcohol products were identified on the four re-
tailers’ websites, the website of each product’s producer
was searched to identify the producer webpage market-
ing the product. In total, 86 webpages marketing 41 dis-
tinct low/er strength wines, and 48 webpages marketing
16 distinct low/er strength beers were identified. Corres-
pondingly, 86 webpages marketing comparable regular
strength wines and 48 webpages marketing comparable
regular strength beers were identified.
Inclusion criteria were as follows:
� Marketing messages (both text and images) for (1)
low/er and (2) regular strength wines and beers sold
online on the websites of (a) the four main UK
retailers (Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury’s, and Morrisons);
and (b) the producers of these products; and
� Text-based messages in English.
The marketing messages (both text and images) re-
trieved from websites meeting the above inclusion cri-
teria were preserved as Adobe .pdf files which were
shared between the two coders (MV, LC).
Coding guide development and coding procedures
The first two authors independently pilot coded six
products. A coding guide was developed after iteratively
coding the marketing messages for these six products.
The computation of inter-rater reliability served to es-
tablish reliability between the coders (Krippendorff’s
α ≥ .67). Disagreements were resolved by discussion until
perfect agreement was achieved. The first two authors
used the guide to code the identified marketing mes-
sages for the presence or absence of the different coding
features. Any disagreements in coding were again re-
solved after discussion.
Coding instrument
The following was recorded:
Website descriptions Date of retrieval, uniform re-
source locator (URL) of website, and any age restrictions
on website.
Product information The types of products sold were
coded as follows: low/er or regular strength wine, low/er
or regular strength beer. The cost of the product was
also recorded. Strength descriptors (e.g., “none,” “light,”
“medium” and “high”) were recorded with the corre-
sponding %ABV listed. Energy and calorie information
were recorded too. Drinking occasions suggested on the
webpage were also coded. Taste descriptors and the
presence of different flavours were coded as present or
absent.

 Analyses
The frequency of occurrence of each marketing message
was calculated. After piloting the coding framework, the
two coders iteratively reviewed and discussed examples
of themes. Major thematic content areas were suggested
following pilot analyses. A series of Chi squared tests
were performed to compare differences in marketing
messages of low/er vs. regular strength wines and beers.
For all analyses, we considered a 5% Type I error rate at
the level of the superordinate theme and type of drink
(global),
with
a
Holm-Šídák
multiplicity
correction
which takes into account the dependence between the
subordinate themes contained within a superordinate
theme per drink (see [10]).
Results
Four themes were identified in the marketing messages:
occasions, health-related associations, alcohol content and
taste. Messages that did not fit within these four were cate-
gorised as “miscellaneous” (see Fig. 1 and Additional file 1:
Table S1 in Online Supplementary Materials). Of these
themes, the different occasion, health-related and alcohol
content messages were more often present for the low/er
strength alcohol products. For the “taste” and “miscellan-
eous” categories there were few significant differences in
their presence between the low/er and regular strength
products, and these contrasts did not reach the global
significance level after correcting for multiple compari-
sons. These results suggest that taste descriptors may
not be used to distinguish between low/er and regular
strength wines and beers in marketing messages con-
tained on producers’ and UK retailers’ webpages (more
details on the taste and miscellaneous superordinate
themes can be found in Additional file 1: Table S1 in
Online Supplementary Materials).
Low/er compared to regular strength wines were signifi-
cantly more likely to be marketed as suitable for consump-
tion on any occasion/everyday [e.g.,‘Perfect option for every
taste and occasion’] [X2(1, n = 172) = 7.75, p = .005], as well
as being suitable for consumption during lunch-times [e.g.,
‘Perfect for all occasions from a lunchtime barbeque to an
evening celebration’] [X2(1, n = 172) = 11.75, p = .001]. Simi-
larly, low/er strength beers were more likely to be mar-
keted as suitable for outdoor/summer picnic/barbeques
[e.g., ‘A perfect way to refresh whether it’s at a BBQ, down
at the beach, or when you’re watching the game with
mates’] [X2(1, n = 96) = 11.16, p = .001], and for sports and
fitness occasions [e.g., ‘To refresh thirsty sportsmen and
women’] [X2(1, n = 96) = 7.55, p = .006].
Low/er strength wines were more likely to include mar-
keting messages associated with health [e.g.,‘Great if you're
watching your weight but still hanker after a little bit of
what you fancy’] [X2(1, n = 172) = 60.95, p < .001], and
information about calorie [X2(1, n = 172) = 47.97, p < .001],
and carbohydrate content [X2(1, n = 172) = 18.87, p < .001].
Similar findings were observed for beer as regards to infor-
mation about calorie [X2(1, n = 96) = 15.10, p < .001],
and carbohydrate content [X2(1, n = 96) = 18.96, p < .001].
Low/er, compared with regular strength wines and beer,
were more often marketed with images of fruits [wine:
X2(1, n = 172) = 7.78, p = .005; beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 22.00,
p < .001].
Low/er strength products were also more likely to
contain messages regarding alcohol content: including
%ABV information in their images [wine: X2(1, n = 172)
= 21.68, p < .001; beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 19.83, p < .001],
and strength descriptors such as “light” or “lower” visible
in their images [wine: X2(1, n = 172) = 53.87, p < .001;
beer: X2(1, n = 96) = 9.93, p = .002]. For a sample of ver-
batim marketing messages pertaining to occasions and
health-related claims please see Table 1.
Discussion
Compared
with
regular
strength
products,
low/er
strength equivalents were more often marketed in asso-
ciation with occasions deemed to be suitable for their
consumption
including
lunchtimes
[wine],
outdoor
events/barbeques [beer] or on sports and fitness occa-
sions
[beer].
Furthermore,
compared
with
regular
strength wines and beers, low/er strength equivalents
were more frequently marketed with images or text as-
sociated with health. These included images of fruit and
the provision of their energy (calorie) and carbohydrate
content.
Presenting low/er strength alcohol products as suitable
for consumption on a wider range of occasions than
regular strength products suggests they may be being
marketed to replace soft drinks rather than alcohol
products of regular strength. This raises a broader ques-
tion of the extent to which low/er strength alcohol prod-
ucts will contribute to a public health strategy to reduce
alcohol consumption [4, 6].
Furthermore, the marketing messages suggesting ex-
tended occasions for low/er strength alcohol consumption
may be additional to regular strength alcohol consump-
tion, while maintaining or extending recognition of the
main brand in question. Importantly, although the devel-
opment and sale of low/er strength alcohol alternatives
has been portrayed by the alcohol industry as a way of
removing units from the market (thereby reducing alcohol
consumption in the population) [3], none of the marketing
messages captured on retailers’ and producers’ websites
marketing low/er strength alcohol wines and beers
mentioned drinking less or reducing alcohol harms (see
also [4, 11]).
The explicit reference to health benefits of low/er
strength alcohol alternatives suggests that the industry
and retailers may be targeting the health conscious

 “millenials” who now form a large portion of the drinks
market (see [12]). It may also be part of a wider indus-
try strategy to imply the health benefits of alcohol more
generally which is currently not possible with regular
strength products under existing advertising restric-
tions [13]. This is consistent with the current industry
strategy to position alcohol consumption as “part of a
healthy lifestyle” [11, 14, 15]. Finally, linking consump-
tion of low/er strength beer with sports is reminiscent
of the traditional mode of regular strength alcohol
advertising which has often been synonymous with
sponsorship of sports events [16]. This is concerning
because the linking of alcohol with sports and fitness
has been associated with risky drinking [17]. Low/er
strength alcohol products may therefore be part of this
wider industry strategy.
The study was limited in its sampling frame thereby
limiting the extent to which we can generalise our findings
beyond this. We only coded low/er strength wines and
beers being sold in UK supermarkets. Furthermore, due to
time and resource constraints, we only coded the low/er
strength wines and beers found on the websites of the four
main supermarkets in the UK. It is also important to note
that other platforms such as billboards and social media
(such as Facebook) may carry marketing messages that
differ to those found in the present research which was
limited in its focus on retailers’ and producers’ webpages.
Future studies could usefully extend the sampling frame
to include other marketing platforms. Furthermore, our
sampling strategy used the levels at which duty rises as
thresholds to define regular strength products (with any
wine above 8.5%ABV and beer above 2.8%ABV defined as
regular strength). Even though very few regular strength
products were near this minimum threshold (with
only one beer product at 3.8%ABV and a few wines
at 9–9.5%ABV, with most products belonging to the
regular category being of greater %ABV), it is possible
that this choice of rather low minimum thresholds may
have masked some of the differences between the mar-
keting messages used for low/er and regular strength
wines and beers, thus resulting in more conservative
estimates of these differences.
Testing whether marketing messages on low/er strength
alcohol products differed between producers espousing
“responsible drinking” values and those producers not
espousing such values was beyond the scope of this study.
Future research could examine whether producers’ self-
proclaimed “responsible drinking” values translate into the
marketing strategies they ultimately pursue.
Conclusions
Low/er strength wines and beers appear to be marketed
not as substitutes for higher strength products but as
ones that can be consumed on additional occasions with
an added implication of healthiness. The present find-
ings cast doubt on the industry contention that the de-
velopment, promotion and marketing of low/er strength
alcohol products may reduce alcohol consumption and
associated harms [3]. Rather, the present findings add to
an existing literature that highlights how measures
intended to benefit public health (in this case wider
availability of low/er strength alcohol products) may
benefit industry to the detriment of the health of the
public (see also [18]).
