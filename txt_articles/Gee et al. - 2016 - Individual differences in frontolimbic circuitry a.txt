Anxiety disorders peak in incidence during adolescence, a develop-
mental window that is marked by dynamic changes in gene expres-
sion, endocannabinoid signaling, and frontolimbic circuitry. We tested
whether genetic alterations in endocannabinoid signaling related to a
common polymorphism in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which
alters endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) levels, would impact the
development of frontolimbic circuitry implicated in anxiety disorders.
In a pediatric imaging sample of over 1,000 3- to 21-y-olds, we show
effects of the FAAH genotype specific to frontolimbic connectivity that
emerge by ∼12 y of age and are paralleled by changes in anxiety-
related behavior. Using a knock-in mouse model of the FAAH poly-
morphism that controls for genetic and environmental backgrounds,
we confirm phenotypic differences in frontoamygdala circuitry and
anxiety-related behavior by postnatal day 45 (P45), when AEA levels
begin to decrease, and also, at P75 but not before. These results, which
converge across species and level of analysis, highlight the importance
of underlying developmental neurobiology in the emergence of ge-
netic effects on brain circuitry and function. Moreover, the results have
important implications for the identification of risk for disease and
precise targeting of treatments to the biological state of the develop-
ing brain as a function of developmental changes in gene expression
and neural circuit maturation.

A
nxiety disorders typically emerge during adolescence, when
the incidence of mental illness peaks (1, 2). The developmental
phase of adolescence is characterized by dynamic changes in gene
expression, frontolimbic circuitry (3, 4), and overall tone of the
endocannabinoid system, which are implicated in anxiety (5–7).
The corticolimbic endocannabinoid system undergoes dynamic
changes across development. The onset of adolescence is marked
by the highest expression of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) in
both cortical and subcortical brain regions, with CB1 expression
declining to adult levels throughout adolescence (8, 9). Across the
amygdala and prefrontal cortex, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
expression shows a transient increase from postnatal day 35 (P35) to
P45 during adolescence in mice (10). Consistent with the regulatory
role of FAAH, anandamide (AEA) levels show an inverse pattern
of a peak at P35 and subsequent decrease during adolescence (10,
11). AEA is an endogenous ligand for the CB1 receptor, suggesting
that the concurrent changes in AEA and CB1 expression reflect
decreasing endocannabinoid signaling during adolescence (12),
which may be associated with increasing risk for anxiety (Fig. 1).
A common human polymorphism in the gene encoding FAAH
(C385A; rs324420), the primary catabolic enzyme of the pro-
totypical endocannabinoid AEA, regulates FAAH activity. The
variant FAAH A385 allele destabilizes the FAAH protein, causing
lower levels of FAAH enzymatic activity and/or increased levels of
AEA in T lymphocytes and brain (13, 14). Phenotypic expression
of common polymorphisms may vary as a function of developmental
changes in AEA signaling, gene expression, and neural circuit mat-
uration. Defining the precise interaction of developmental and ge-
netic variation in AEA signaling can advance understanding of the
molecular basis of anxiety disorders and facilitate developing FAAH
C385A as a biomarker for precise targeting of treatments to the
biological state of the developing brain.
To enhance the reliability of human genetic studies of FAAH
C385A, we have developed a knock-in mouse that biologically
recapitulates the human FAAH A385 allele, displaying reduced
FAAH protein levels and enzymatic activity and increased AEA
levels in the brain relative to wild-type (WT) mice, which express
the ancestral FAAH C385 allele (14). We have shown that the
variant FAAH A385 allele is associated with selective enhance-
ment of frontolimbic connectivity implicated in anxiety (15–18)
and greater fear extinction in both adult humans and mice (14). In
light of the quantitative differences in AEA levels across devel-
opment and because of the genotype at FAAH C385A, we hy-
pothesized that there would be a gene by development interaction,
in which the effects of FAAH C385A on frontolimbic connectivity
and anxiety emerge during adolescence.
In this study, we implemented parallel studies in mice and hu-
mans across development (19) to determine the developmental
Significance
Anxiety disorders peak during adolescence, a developmental
period that is marked by dynamic changes in gene expression,
frontolimbic circuitry, and endocannabinoid signaling. This
cross-species study identifies parallel gene by development
interactions across humans and a knock-in mouse model of the
same fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) polymorphism. The
impact of FAAH genetic variation on frontolimbic circuitry and
anxiety in mice and humans emerges during adolescence as
anandamide levels decrease but not before. These findings
have important implications for the identification of risk for
disease and precise targeting of treatments to the biological
state of the developing brain as a function of developmental
changes in gene expression and neural circuit maturation.

 course of FAAH C385A effects on frontolimbic circuitry and
anxiety-related behavior. Diffusion tensor imaging data from 1,050
human participants ages 3–21 y old (518 females) from the Pe-
diatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) Study (20)
and tract tracing in FAAH knock-in and WT mice at P23–P75
were used to measure the interaction of FAAH C385A genotype
and age on frontolimbic circuitry relative to control tracts. We
specifically hypothesized that FAAH A385 allele effects on en-
hanced frontolimbic circuitry and anxiety would emerge during
adolescence, when AEA levels begin to decrease (10, 11), and
therefore, may be most sensitive to the additional quantitative
effects of the FAAH A385 allele.
Results
FAAH C385A-Associated (Phenotypic) Differences in Frontolimbic Circuitry
Emerge in Adolescence in Humans and Mice. Species-specific analyses
were performed to assess the effects of FAAH C385A genotype on
frontolimbic connectivity across age. In humans, we examined con-
nectivity within the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a white matter tract
in the human brain that connects limbic structures in the anterior
temporal lobe with ventral and medial prefrontal cortices (21–24)
implicated in anxiety (15). This fiber bundle shows a protracted
developmental trajectory, with continuing development well
into young adulthood (25, 26). We measured fractional an-
isotropy (FA), an index of connectivity derived from diffusion
tensor imaging, and controlled for sex, ancestry, and site (i.e.,
imaging facility at which the scan occurred). A significant linear
effect of age [F(1,1,031) = 305.985; P < 2.2 × 1016] on FA was
observed in the UF (Fig. S1). Consistent with our earlier results
of enhanced adult frontoamygdala connectivity as a function of
the FAAH A385 allele (14), there was a main effect of the
FAAH genotype on UF FA [F(1,1,031) = 17.858; P = 2.59 × 10−5].
Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, there was an age
by genotype interaction [age × genotype interaction: F(1,1,031) =
5.893; P = 0.0154] (Fig. 2A), with the genotype effect apparent after
12 y of age [F(1,491) = 14.02; P = 0.0002; trend toward dose de-
pendence association) (Fig. S2) but not before [F(1,523) = 0.513; P =
0.474]. Specificity of the FAAH genotypic effects on frontolimbic
circuitry was shown using the corticospinal tract as a control, which
showed a similar main effect of age [F(1,1,031) = 531.616; P = 2.0 ×
10−16] but no effect of genotype [F(1,1,031) = 2.699; P = 0.101] or
age by genotype interaction [F(1,1,031) = 0.009; P = 0.927] (Fig. S3).
The age by genotype interaction on UF FA was significant, even
when controlling for corticospinal FA [F(1,1,030) = 6.532; P = 0.011].
We have proposed that knock-in mice that recapitulate common
human polymorphisms facilitate controlled experiments on an in-
bred genetic background and provide a valuable source of valida-
tion of human candidate gene associations (19). Therefore, we
performed connectivity analyses in FAAH A385 allele knock-in
mice (FAAHA/A) and WT littermate controls (FAAHC/C). Given
previous findings of FAAH C385A effects on descending infra-
limbic (IL) to basolateral amygdala (BLA) projections but not as-
cending BLA to IL projections (14), we focused on IL to BLA
projections. The anterograde tracer phaseolus vulgaris leucoag-
glutinin (PHA-L) was injected into the IL prefrontal cortex of mice
to label axonal projections from IL to BLA as a measure of fron-
toamygdala connectivity (27). Connectivity analyses were performed
as a function of age in FAAHC/C and FAAHA/A mice after PHA-L
injections at P23, P45, and P75 corresponding to preadolescence,
adolescence, and adulthood, respectively (n = 7 per genotype per
age), by quantifying fiber density in the BLA. Consistent with the
human findings, the tract tracing experiment revealed a significant
age group by genotype interaction [F(2,36) = 58.72; P < 0.0001] on
fiber density in the BLA (Fig. 2B). Posthoc Student’s t tests between
genotypes within each age group showed enhanced projections
from IL to BLA in adolescent [t(12) = 13.81; P < 0.0001] and
adult [t(12) = 12.49; P < 0.0001] FAAHA/A mice relative to FAAHC/C
mice but no differences in fiber density in preadolescent mice
[t(12) = 0.56; P = 0.583] as a function of FAAH C385A genotype.
FAAH A385 Allele Is Associated with Lower Anxiety in Adolescence
but Not in Childhood Across Humans and Mice. Prior studies have
shown that anxiety disorders peak during adolescence (1, 2) when
there are dynamic changes in AEA levels (10, 11) that impact
anxiety-related frontolimbic circuitry (28–31). Moreover, we have
shown that the FAAH A385 allele is associated with increased
frontolimbic connectivity and lower anxiety in both mice and hu-
mans in adulthood (14). Based on this culmination of findings and
our imaging results showing phenotypic differences in frontolimbic
circuitry that emerge during adolescence, we hypothesized that
there would be a similar age by genotype interaction on anxiety,
with FAAH A385 allele carriers showing less anxiety during ad-
olescence than noncarriers and no phenotypic differences during
childhood. We tested this hypothesis in a subset of the PING
Study participants with self-reported anxiety symptoms (n = 214)
using our imaging results and participant mean age of 12 y old to
determine a priori age group boundaries for childhood (less than
12 y of age) and adolescence (12 y of age and older). We show an
age group by genotype interaction for anxiety controlling for sex,
ancestry, and site [F(1,198) = 6.23; P = 0.0134] (Fig. 3A). Posthoc
analyses controlling for age, sex, ancestry, and site within each age
group showed that adolescent FAAH A385 allele carriers had
lower self-reported anxiety than noncarriers [F(1,102) = 8.96; P =
0.003], a phenotypic pattern that did not reach significance in
children [F(1,83) = 3.82; P = 0.054].
To constrain our interpretation of our human findings and control
for genetic and environmental background differences, we tested
anxiety-like behavior in FAAHC/C and FAAHA/A mice using the el-
evated plus maze (EPM) at P23, P45, and P65–P75. Consistent with
the human findings, the EPM test showed a significant age group by
genotype interaction on anxiety-like behavior [F(1,45) = 4.922; P =
0.0316] as measured by percentage of time in the open arms (Fig.
3B). Posthoc t tests revealed that FAAHA/A mice spent more time in
the open arms than FAAHC/C mice during adolescence [t(15) = 2.49;
P = 0.0261] and adulthood [t(15) = 2.45; P = 0.0326) but not during
preadolescence [t(15) = 0.932; P = 0.3687]. There was no FAAH
C385A genotype by age group interaction effect on total distance
traveled in the EPM, a nonanxiety-related behavior (Fig. S4).

activities (FAAH) based on measurement in a rodent system (10). The endo-
cannabinoid system peaks and then wanes in adolescence, which may con-
tribute to changes in risk for anxiety during this developmental stage. FAAH
and AEA fluctuate reciprocally across development. Early adolescence is
marked by a decrease in FAAH and an increase in AEA levels, whereas FAAH
levels increase and AEA levels decrease toward later adolescence (10, 33). CB1
receptor expression peaks with the onset of adolescence (8, 9, 32, 33). The

 Discussion
This developmentally informed translational approach with par-
allel studies in mice and humans provides converging evidence
that effects of the FAAH C385A polymorphism on frontolimbic
circuitry emerge during adolescence. FAAHA/A knock-in mice and
human FAAH A385 allele carriers show stronger frontolimbic
connectivity beginning in adolescence and extending into young
adulthood but not in childhood. Consistent with stronger struc-
tural connectivity, adolescents but not younger mice or humans
with the FAAH A385 allele showed lower anxiety, further sug-
gesting developmental specificity in the phenotypic effects of the
FAAH C385A polymorphism. This previously unidentified gene
by development interaction may elucidate mechanisms underlying
risk for anxiety disorders and suggest an important step toward
precision medicine approaches that tailor treatment based on
genetic variation and developmental stage (e.g., adolescence).
The adolescent emergence of FAAH C385A effects on fronto-
limbic circuitry in mice and humans suggests that normative de-
velopmental processes moderate the effects of the FAAH C385A
polymorphism
on
frontolimbic
development.
CB1
expression,
FAAH activity, and AEA levels are relatively stable during childhood
but fluctuate dynamically across adolescence (10, 11, 32, 33). During
this period of fluctuation, the developing system may be especially
sensitive to differential expression of FAAH and consequently, AEA
levels associated with the variant allele, especially as AEA levels
wane. Specifically, as AEA levels decrease during midadolescence,
additional quantitative effects of the FAAH A385 allele may in-
crease. The moderation of phenotypic differences by developmental
stage was not evident for a control tract, suggesting some specificity
of the phenotypic effects to frontolimbic circuit development.
Consistent with the developmental emergence of FAAH
C385A effects on frontolimbic connectivity, the effects of the
FAAH A385 allele on anxiety also emerged during adolescence.
Developmental alterations in the activity of FAAH and conse-
quently, the levels of AEA in the system, may influence the de-
velopment of neural circuitry and the emergence of anxiety (4). The
endocannabinoid system has been associated with anxiety (34, 35),
and we have shown that the FAAH A385 variant allele strengthens
frontolimbic circuitry, enhances fear extinction, and decreases
anxiety-like behaviors in mice and humans during adulthood (14).
Effects of the FAAH C385A polymorphism on frontolimbic cir-
cuitry implicated in anxiety (15–18) are a likely mechanism un-
derlying phenotypic differences in anxiety associated with the
A385 allele. Specifically, functional effects of the A385 allele may
enhance prefrontal regulation of the amygdala during fear (6, 7)
through stronger frontoamygdala connectivity (14). In addition to
revealing their developmental trajectory, here we extend these
findings to structural connectivity in humans. Our prior work
suggests that phenotypic differences resulting from the FAAH
C385A polymorphism are specific to top-down connections from
the IL to BLA, which were not apparent for the BLA to IL or the
connections between the BLA and prelimbic cortex (14). Thus,
greater regulation by top-down control of the amygdala may me-
diate the gain of function that FAAH A385 allele carriers exhibit
in the domain of anxiety. Given the smaller sample of participants
with anxiety scores in this study and the substantial effects of age
on frontolimbic connectivity over this age range, it was not pos-
sible to uncouple these effects in a mediation model.
Despite the need for identification of differential genetic
effects across development to inform risk and treatment of
psychiatric disorders, gene by development interactions have
remained largely elusive. Moreover, the challenges of mapping
psychiatric disorders onto neurobiology, including nonreplication
of past candidate gene studies, has hindered progress in clini-
cal practice. Conducting parallel studies across species allows for

 greater control of environmental and genetic background (e.g., in
rodents) while enabling rapid translational discovery by leveraging
conserved elements of neural and behavioral systems to identify
genotype–phenotype relationships (19, 36–38). By integrating a de-
velopmentally informed approach with parallel rodent and human
studies (Fig. 4), we have established convergence and cross-species
validation of the developmental emergence of FAAH C385A effects
on frontolimbic circuitry. Ultimately, such translational studies can
facilitate scientific consensus that will permit the implementation of
developmental biomarkers guiding clinical practice.
The finding that FAAH C385A effects on frontolimbic circuitry
and anxiety emerge during adolescence may prove valuable in
enhancing personalized medicine for anxiety disorders, which are
the most common psychiatric disorders during adolescence. De-
spite dynamic changes across brain development, many treatments
are based on principles studied in adults; delineating the biological
state of the developing brain is critical for optimizing treatment for
children and adolescents (3). Tailoring clinical practice based on
developmental stage and individual genotypic differences may
indicate which treatments will be most effective for which patients.
Although any single common polymorphism is unlikely to be
sufficient for personalizing treatments, this work may contribute to
efforts to target treatments that rely on endocannabinoid signaling
(e.g., FAAH inhibitors). Most recently, the role of endocannabi-
noids in treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has
been elucidated, suggesting additional implications for use of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or their combination
with exposure-based therapies. Specifically, BLA-specific CB1
receptors and fluoxetine-induced increases in AEA mediated the
effects of fluoxetine (but not citalopram) on fear extinction (39).
Given the high incidence of anxiety disorders during adoles-
cence (1) and prior evidence of diminished fear extinction dur-
ing adolescence across species (40–42), these findings in the
context of recent work on treatment mechanisms related to the
endocannabinoid system have significant potential to optimize
treatment for anxiety during this sensitive window of development.
Conclusions
A developmentally informed approach integrating multiple levels
of analysis across parallel studies in humans and mice engineered
to recapitulate common human polymorphisms can identify reli-
able and precise genotype–phenotype relationships. In this report,
we have shown that the effects of FAAH C385A genotype on
frontolimbic connectivity vary as a function of developmental
stage, emerging in early adolescence when endocannabinoid sig-
naling is decreasing. This developmental trajectory coincides with
the onset of anxiety disorders in many individuals and may con-
tribute to interindividual variation in anxiety disorders and their
treatment during adolescence and beyond. Our results underscore
the importance of considering normative developmental neuro-
biology in characterizing the phenotypic effects of common human
polymorphisms and their association with atypical development.
Moreover, these findings highlight how phenotypic expression of
common polymorphisms varies as a function of developmental
changes in gene expression and neural circuit maturation and have
broad implications for the development of common polymor-
phisms as potential biomarkers guiding psychiatric care.
Methods
Human Participants. Data used for this study were obtained from the PING
Study database (pingstudy.ucsd.edu) (SI Methods) (20). Participants included
an initial sample of 1,221 typically developing individuals ranging in age
from 3 to 21 y old who had diffusion scans collected in the multisite PING
Study. Details on the recruitment, ascertainment, behavioral, genetic, and
neuroimaging methods and acquisition in the PING Study are summarized
below (details are in refs. 43–46). All participants provided informed consent
(age 18 y old and older) or parental informed consent with child assent (ages
7–17 y old) in accordance with policies of the Institutional Review Boards
of the sites of participation. Compensation was provided as agreed on
during the consent process. In total, 1,050 individuals (mean age = 12.11 y
old; SD = 4.80; range = 3.0–21.0; 518 females) (Table S1) from the PING Study
database were included in this work after 171 participants from the initial

opment interaction [F(1,198) = 6.2269; P = 0.0134] on anxiety revealed that A allele carriers (n = 54; 19 females) had lower anxiety than C homozygotes (n = 63;
30 females) during adolescence [F(1,102) = 8.96; P = 0.00346] but not during childhood [F(1,83) = 3.82; P = 0.054; A allele carriers: n = 32; 21 females; C homozygotes:
n = 65; 28 females]. These findings parallel the adolescent emergence of stronger frontolimbic connectivity among A allele carriers. (B) Consistent with the finding in
humans, a significant genotype by age group interaction [F(1,45) = 4.922; P = 0.0316] revealed that FAAHA/A mice (P23: n = 9; P45: n = 9; P65–P75: n = 10) showed less
anxiety-like behavior than FAAHC/C mice (P23: n = 6; P45: n = 8; P65–P75: n = 7) during adolescence and adulthood, but not during childhood, as measured by
percentage of time spent in the open arms of the EPM. *P < 0.05.

 sample were excluded for excessive movement during image acquisition (n =
2) or insufficient information for age, sex, ancestry, or genotype (n = 169).
Diffusion Imaging Data Preprocessing and FA Analysis. Diffusion MRI data were
obtained from the PING Study database. Acquisition protocols for a high-reso-
lution, T1-weighted scan and diffusion-weighted scans were standardized across
sites dependent on the make of scanner, with most parameters constant across all
locations (SI Methods). Image preprocessing and analysis were performed with a
customized processing pipeline using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (47)
and FMRIB Software Library software packages (48). Images were corrected for
both susceptibility-induced and eddy current distortions (49). Participant head
movement during image acquisition was calculated, and realignment was per-
formed across gradient direction slices. Gradient vector directions were rotated
based on the motion correction. Gradient slices that were found to have head
displacement greater than one-half of a voxel (1.25 mm) were excluded from
the diffusion directions used for additional analyses, because data for that
gradient direction were likely inaccurate because of movement. If more than
one-half of the gradient slices in a participant’s data exceeded the movement
threshold of 1.25 mm, the participant was excluded from additional analysis.
We examined structural connectivity for an a priori tract of interest, the UF,
based on its identification as a major white matter tract connecting the pre-
frontal cortex and amygdala (22) and our prior evidence of phenotypic dif-
ferences across mice and humans in frontoamygdala connectivity (14).
Probabilistic tractography was used to determine UF masks on a participant by
participant basis. Diffusion data were modeled using a crossing fiber tech-
nique described previously (Bayesian estimation of diffusion parameters
obtained using sampling techniques) (50). A two-fiber model was created to
perform probabilistic tractography and FA analysis. To determine the location
of the UF in each participant, a mask in standard Montreal Neurological In-
stitute (MNI) space was created to use as a seed region for tractography. The
seed was placed at the site where the UF is known to ascend from the tem-
poral lobe and loop anteriorly into the frontal lobe (Fig. 2A). An exclusionary
mask was also placed posteriorly to the seed region to prevent detection of
any tracts traveling posteriorly from the seed.
Participant FA maps were transformed into MNI space using a standard FA
map, and probabilistic tractography was performed using the seed described.
This technique resulted in individualized probabilistic maps, where the highly
connected voxels showed a clear UF-shaped pattern that was easily isolated
with a single threshold (4,000) held constant for all participants (Fig. 2A). The
resulting probabilistic UF masks (both hemispheres) for each participant
were inspected visually to ensure a trajectory consistent with the known shape
of this major white matter tract (51). Each participant’s FA map was then
masked using individualized UF masks. The FA values of included voxels were
averaged, resulting in an average UF FA value for each participant. To test the
specificity for results of analyses of the UF, analyses were also performed on
the corticospinal tract, which served as a control tract (SI Methods and Fig. S3).
Human Genotyping. The FAAH genotype was acquired by the PING Genomics
Core by genome-wide genotyping on extracted DNA from saliva samples using
the Illumina Human 660W-Quad Beadchip with markers passing quality control
filters (sample cell rate >98%; SNP call rate >95%; minor allele frequency >5%).
To assess ancestry and admixture proportions, a supervised clustering approach
was implemented in the ADMIXTURE software (52), which clustered participant
data into six clusters corresponding to six major continental populations: Afri-
can, Central Asian, East Asian, European, Native American, and Oceanic.
Anxiety Self-Report. A subset of child and adolescent participants in the
PING Study sample provided self-report on the Screen for Child Anxiety-
Related Emotional Disorders (53). All child and adolescent participants
who had genotype and self-reported anxiety (n = 217; mean =12.69 y
old; SD = 2.8; range =7.25–17.92; 100 females) were examined in the
analyses of anxiety; three of these participants were excluded because of
extreme scores on the anxiety measures (outliers <1.5× or >1.5× inter-
quartile range), resulting in a total sample of 214 (Table S2).
Mouse Model and Anterograde Tract Tracing Analyses. We have previously validated
a knock-in mouse model of FAAH C385A; generation of FAAH C385A mice is de-
tailed in our prior work (14). WT mice express the human ancestral C385 allele, and
replacement with the variant A385 allele resulted in knock-in mice having lower
levels of FAAH protein and higher levels of AEA than WT mice. The FAAH knock-in
mice were backcrossed >10 generations onto C57B16 mice (Charles River Labora-
tories). Only male mice were used for all experiments. All animals were kept on a
12:12-h light–dark cycle at 18 °C to 22 °C with food and water available ad libitum.
Five mice were housed together per cage. All procedures were in accordance with
the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (54) and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medical College.
Based on our a priori hypothesis about genotypic effects on the development
of frontoamygdala circuitry, we used anterograde tracers in our FAAH knock-in
mouse model to examine connectivity with the IL. Mice were microinjected with
20 nL of PHA-L [2.5% solution (wt/vol) in 0.05 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at pH
7.4; catalog no. AS-2300; Vector Laboratories] into the IL at P23, P45, and P75 to
assess its projections to BLA (Fig. 2B and Table S3). After a survival time of 10 d
after PHA-L injections, animals were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol (0.1 mL/10 g
body weight) and perfused through the heart with 30 mL 0.9% saline
followed by 120 mL 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer.
Brains were removed and postfixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in a
0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight and then, transferred to a sucrose
solution (30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4 °C for 48 h). Coronal sec-
tions were cut on a freezing microtome (40 μm). Free-floating serial sections (take
one out of every three) were washed (three times for 10 min each) in TBS and
incubated for 30 min in a blocking solution containing 4% normal donkey serum
and 1% BSA in TBS with 0.2% Triton X-100. Sections then were transferred in
rabbit anti–PHA-L primary antibody (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories) diluted in the
blocking solution mentioned above and incubated 24 h at 4 °C. Sections were
incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor-labeled donkey anti-rabbit 555 (1:500;
Invitrogen). Sections were mounted, coverslipped, and sealed with nail polish.
Injection sites were confirmed by referring to the Allen Mouse Brain Map
(Allen Co.). Sections were observed under a Nikon 80i Fluorescent Microscope.
Digital photography was performed using a MicroFire camera and FireFrame
software (Optronics), and stereological estimation of cell density was per-
formed using StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightfield). Contours of the IL
and BLA were drawn, and random sampling was applied to contours. Total
volume of BLA was estimated using the Cavalieri method. Total cell numbers in
IL were estimated using a fractionator, with counting frame size of 25 × 25 ×
40 μm and sampling grid size of 100 × 100 μm. Detection of fiber density in
BLA was performed using a stereological method. Briefly, sections were traced
under a 4× lens, and then, perimetrics probe analysis was done under a 40×
lens. Counting frame was set to 25 × 25 μm, and radius of the Merz coherent
test system was set to 5 μm. Total length of all sampling sites was automati-
cally calculated. For each animal, fiber density is obtained from the sum of the
lengths divided by the sum of the areas for all sections. There were no dif-
ferences in injections across all genotypes and age groups (Fig. S5).
EPM to Measure Anxiety-Like Behavior in Mice. The EPM task was conducted as
described previously (SI Methods) (55). All mice studies were blinded to the in-
vestigator with regard to genotype for both the tract tracing and behavior studies.
Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were performed within the R statistical
software package, version 2.15.1 (R Core Team). For human analyses, ANOVA

Developmentally informed vertically integrated translational approach
to genetic variation and treatment targets across development. We have used
developmentally informed parallel human and mouse studies to identify the
relevance and impact of the FAAH C385A polymorphism on brain biochemistry,
neurocircuitry, behavior, and symptoms (i.e., vertical integration across multiple
levels of analysis) during development and identified a previously unidentified
gene by development interaction.

 was conducted to examine the effects of age group (under 12 y old versus 12 y
old and older) and FAAH genotype [homozygous CC vs. A allele carriers (AA, AC)]
on FA while controlling for sex, ancestry, and site. When a significant age group
by genotype interaction was detected, posthoc general linear model (GLM)
analyses examined the effect of genotype within each age group in children
(under 12 y old) as well as adolescents and young adults (12 y old and older)
controlling for age (continuous given the wide age range), sex, ancestry, and
site. Given a significant age group by genotype interaction on FA, we had an a
priori hypothesis that genotype would have an effect on anxiety among ado-
lescents and young adults (12 y old and older) but not among children (under
12 y old). This hypothesis was tested within each age group using a GLM con-
trolling for age (continuous given the wide age range), sex, ancestry, and site. For
mice analyses, ANOVA tested for an age group (P23, P45, or P75) by genotype (WT
vs. knock in) interaction on fiber density and the percentage of time spent in the
open arms during the EPM. For a significant age group by genotype effect,
posthoc Student’s t tests tested the effect of genotype within each age
group. For humans, secondary exploratory analyses used a GLM to test for a
dose-dependent effect of genotype on FA (AA > AC > CC) (Fig. S2) and anxiety
(AA < AC < CC) (Fig. S6). Statistical tests were two-sided; values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Data are presented as means ± SEMs.
