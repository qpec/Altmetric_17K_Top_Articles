Background
There is evidence from observational studies that whole grains can have a beneficial effect on risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Earlier versions of this review found mainly short-term intervention studies. There are now longer-term randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) available. This is an update and expansion of the original review conducted in 2007.
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of whole grain foods or diets on total mortality, cardiovascular events, and
cardiovascular risk factors (blood lipids, blood pressure) in healthy people or people who have established cardiovascular disease or
related risk factors, using all eligible RCTs.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (Issue 8, 2016) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to 31 August 2016), Embase (1980 to week 35
2016), and CINAHL Plus (1937 to 31 August 2016) on 31 August 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 July 2017 and the
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 6 July 2017. We checked reference lists
of relevant articles and applied no language restrictions.
Selection criteria
We selected RCTs assessing the effects of whole grain foods or diets containing whole grains compared to foods or diets with a similar
composition, over a minimum of 12 weeks, on cardiovascular disease and related risk factors. Eligible for inclusion were healthy adults,
those at increased risk of CVD, or those previously diagnosed with CVD.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies. Data were extracted and quality-checked by one review author and checked by
a second review author. A second review author checked the analyses. We assessed treatment effect using mean difference in a fixed-
effect model and heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and the Chi2 test of heterogeneity. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using
GRADE with GRADEpro software.

 Main results
We included nine RCTs randomising a total of 1414 participants (age range 24 to 70; mean age 45 to 59, where reported) to whole
grain versus lower whole grain or refined grain control groups. We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain diets on total
cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, total stroke). All included studies reported the effect of whole grain diets on risk factors
for cardiovascular disease including blood lipids and blood pressure. All studies were in primary prevention populations and had an
unclear or high risk of bias, and no studies had an intervention duration greater than 16 weeks.
Overall, we found no difference between whole grain and control groups for total cholesterol (mean difference 0.07, 95% confidence
interval -0.07 to 0.21; 6 studies (7 comparisons); 722 participants; low-quality evidence).
Using GRADE, we assessed the overall quality of the available evidence on cholesterol as low. Four studies were funded by independent
national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding by organisations with
commercial interests in cereals.
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from RCTs of an effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular outcomes or on major CVD risk factors
such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Trials were at unclear or high risk of bias with small sample sizes and relatively short-term
interventions, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs with longer
durations assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.

Whole grain cereals for cardiovascular disease
Background
Whole grain foods encompass a range of products and include whole grain wheat, rice, maize, and oats. The term ’whole grain’ also
includes milled whole grains such as oatmeal and wholemeal wheat.
Study characteristics
We evaluated nine randomised studies assessing the effects of whole grain diets compared to diets with refined grains or a usual diet on
levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure (major risk factors for cardiovascular disease including heart attacks or stroke). The
evidence is current to August 2016.
Key results
The diets were followed for at least 12 weeks, but most studies had some methodological limitations, numbers of participants were
small, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. We found no studies reporting on the effect of whole grains on deaths from
cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular events. All nine included studies reported the effects of whole grain diets on levels of cholesterol
in the blood or blood pressure. We found no effects on blood cholesterol or blood pressure in favour of whole grain diets. Four studies
were funded by independent national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding
by organisations with commercial interests in cereals.
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to date to recommend consumption of whole grain diets to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease, or lower blood cholesterol, or blood pressure.

This was an update and expansion of the original review published
in 2007 (Kelly 2007).
Description of the condition
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions that af-
fect the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart dis-
ease, cerebrovasculardisease, andperipheral arterial disease (WHO
2013). One of the main mechanisms thought to cause CVD is
atherosclerosis, where the arteries become clogged by atheromas
or plaques (NHS 2012). Cardiovascular disease occurs when the
arteries are completely blocked or when blood flow is restricted
by a narrowed artery, limiting the amount of blood and oxygen
delivered to organs or tissue (BHF 2014). Arteries may naturally
become harder and narrower with age, although this process may
be accelerated by such factors as a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, eth-
nicity, smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure (NHS
2012). Another cause of CVD is unstable plaque rupturing. It is
thought that unstable plaques activate an inflammatory response
in the body that causes the structure of atherosclerotic plaque
to weaken and rupture, leading to the formation of blood clots
(Spagnoli 2007).
Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death and dis-
ability globally (WHO 2013). Around 30% of total global deaths
can be attributed to CVD (WHO 2013), and it is estimated to
cause 17 million deaths per year (Bovet 2012). The World Health
Organization reports that by 2030, CVDs will account for almost
23.3 million deaths per year (WHO 2013). This burden is set to
increase as a consequence of ageing populations and increasing
levels of sedentary lifestyles and obesity.
One key public health priority in the prevention of CVD is tar-
geting modifiable risk factors. One such risk factor is diet, which
plays a major role in the aetiology of many chronic conditions,
including CVD. Indeed, a number of dietary factors have been
found to be associated with a decrease in CVD risk, such as a
low sodium intake (Aburto 2013), a low-carbohydrate diet (Hu
2014), intake of whole grains (Ye 2012), and a high consumption
of fruits and vegetables (Oude 2010). Such factors are important,
not only because they have been linked to CVD development, but
also because they can be modified. This makes them one of the
main targets for interventions aimed at primary prevention and
management of CVD.
Description of the intervention
A whole grain contains the entire edible parts of a natural grain
kernel. The structure of all whole grains is similar and includes
the endosperm, germ, and bran. Whole grains are rich in dietary
fibre, antioxidants, resistant starch, phyto-oestrogens, and other
important micronutrients such as vitamins and folic acid (Slavin
2003). In the grain-refining process, most of the bran and some
of the germ is removed, resulting in the loss of dietary fibre, vita-
mins, minerals, lignans, phyto-oestrogens, phenolic compounds,
and phytic acid. The remaining starchy endosperm is ground to
produce refined white flours.
Important grains in the Western diet include wheat, rice, maize,
oats, barley, and rye. Wholemeal foods are made from whole grains
that have been milled to a finer texture rather than leaving them
whole in the final product. Both whole grain and wholemeal cereal
foods are grain foods that include the outer layers of the grain,
including the bran and germ. The EU HEALTHGRAIN consor-
tium definition of whole grain is “whole grains shall consist of
the intact, ground, cracked or flaked kernel after the removal of
inedible parts such as the hull and husk. The principal anatomical
components - the starchy endosperm, germ and bran - are present
in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact kernel”
(van der Kamp 2014). This definition also allows for small losses
of components during processing. The HEALTHGRAIN defini-
tion also lists specific grains included as whole grain. Research
has shown that such processing of whole grains does not remove
biologically important compounds (Slavin 2001). Nutritionally,
whole grain and wholemeal foods are similar.
For foods made from whole grain such as breads, breakfast cereals,
pasta, biscuits, and grain-based snack foods, a standard definition
for what constitutes a whole grain food has been recommended
as a minimum of 8 g whole grains/30 g serving (27 g/100 g)
(Ferruzzi 2014). This was in response to a lack of consistency in
previous definitions of whole grain foods across “countries, gov-
ernments, regulatory agencies, private and commercial organisa-
tions” (Ferruzzi 2014).
A recent comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of
prospective studies of the relationship between whole grain intake
and cardiovascular disease found significant reductions in risk for
cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease per 90
g/day (3 servings) increase of whole grain intake (Aune 2016). Ev-
idence from two different meta-analyses of observational cohort
studies suggests that those consuming 48 to 80 g/day (3 to 5 serv-
ings/day) compared to lower consumers of whole grains (Ye 2012),
or2.5servings/daycomparedto0.2 servings/day have a21% lower
risk of CVD (Mellen 2008). The 10-year Nurses’ Health Study,
a large prospective study of 75,521 women aged 38 to 63, found
that increased whole grain intake was associated with decreased
risk of coronary heart disease (Liu 1999). The lower risk associated
with higher whole grain intake was not fully explained by the con-
tribution of the diet to intakes of dietary fibre, folate, vitamin B6,
and vitamin E. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
study found a beneficial relationship between whole grain con-
sumption and the risk of total mortality and incidence of coronary
artery disease but not the risk of ischaemic stroke (Steffen 2003).
The study followed 15,792 people aged 45 to 64 for 11 years.
A review of the relationship between whole grains and CVD risk
concluded that there is an increasing body of evidence (Seal 2006),
5

 including from observational studies, suggesting a strong inverse
relationship between increased consumption of whole grain foods
and CVD risk. Associations between whole grain consumption
and risk factors for coronary heart disease have also been reported.
Inthe FraminghamOffspringstudy, dietsrich inwhole grainswere
inversely associated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol and body mass index (McKeown 2002).
While cereal fibre has been associated with reduced risk of CVD
(Rimm 1996; Wolk 1999), the relative effects of fibre or other
components of whole grains such as phytochemicals and micronu-
trients, Fardet 2010; Okarter 2010, on CVD and risk factors is
unclear (Ferruzzi 2014). A recent systematic review of RCTs found
no effectof whole grains on body weight outcomes, although there
was some evidence of small changes in body fat (Pol 2013). A
systematic review of the effect of whole grains on type 2 diabetes
and risk factors, Priebe 2008, found only one relevant randomised
trial relating to a small improvement in insulin sensitivity (Pereira
2002).
Why it is important to do this review
Recent meta-analyses examining whole grains and CVD events in-
cluded only prospective cohort studies. Evidence seems to suggest
a benefit of foods and diets containing whole grain on CVD risk
factors. However, evidence has come largely from observational
studies, which may be prone to confounding and other biases. We
undertook this systematic review to examine the evidence of the
effects of whole grains on CVD events and major risk factors from
RCTs.
O B J E C T I V E S
The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of whole
grain foods or diets on total mortality, cardiovascular events, and
cardiovascular risk factors (blood lipids, blood pressure) in healthy
people or people who have established cardiovascular disease or
related risk factors, using all eligible RCTs.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials. Cross-over and parallel-group study
designs were eligible for inclusion. Minimum study duration for
inclusion was 12 weeks.
Types of participants
Free-living adults (age 18 years or older) were eligible for inclusion
if they were healthy, had established cardiovascular disease, or one
or more of the following risk factors: abnormal blood lipid lev-
els (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL cholesterol, triglyc-
erides, and total cholesterol), raised blood pressure/hypertension,
overweight (body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI
> 30 kg/m2), metabolic syndrome, or diabetes.
Types of interventions
We includedstudiesiftheycomparedthe effectof individual whole
grain foods or diets high in whole grain foods with other diets or
foods with lower levels or no whole grains. Comparisons were be-
tween diets with similar overall macronutrient (energy, carbohy-
drate, fat, and protein) levels. For the purposes of this review, the
term ’whole grain’ includes foods based on milled whole grains,
such as wholemeal or oatmeal. Studies had to have a minimum 12-
week intervention period (or follow-up period following dietary
advice).
We did not include studies if they were multiple-component in-
terventions, or interventions that incorporated factors other than
whole grain foods or diets, unless the effect of whole grain foods or
diets could be separated from the other factors. We did not include
studies on foods that were based only on individual components
(e.g. bran, germ, or other components) of the grain. We did not
include studies that examined the effect of high fibre, dietary fibre,
or cereal fibre where the specific effect of whole grain foods or diets
could not be distinguished.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Total cardiovascular mortality.
2. Cardiovascular events (e.g. fatal and non-fatal myocardial
infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke).
Secondary outcomes
1. Blood lipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, triglycerides).
2. Blood pressure.
3. Quality of life.
4. Adverse events (e.g. bloating, nausea, weight gain, difficulty
in eating out).
Body weight data and BMI were recorded as potential parameters
that might influence the above outcomes, but studies that reported
only weight or BMI outcomes (without cardiovascular, lipid, or
blood pressure outcomes) were not included.
Since the last update of this review, a separate Cochrane Review
has been published focusing on the effects of whole grain foods for
6

 the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Priebe 2008). Hence,
we excluded studies with diabetes as an outcome or changes in
related risk factors including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin
resistance or sensitivity, glucose or insulin outcomes or weight,
BMI, and other anthropometric outcomes if they did not also
measure lipids or blood pressure.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We updated and ran the searches on 31 August 2016 in the follow-
ing databases; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL, Issue 8, 2016) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE
(Ovid, 1946 to 31 August 2016), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to week 35,
2016), and CINAHL Plus (EBSCO, 1937 to 31 August 2016).
We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov, 5 July
2017) and the World Health Organization International Clin-
ical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP) ( apps.who.int/
trialsearch/, 6 July 2017).
We amended the searches from the previous review (Appendix 1)
to account for the broader inclusion criteria of this update. We
ran the updated search strategies (Appendix 2) without date limits
and applied no language restrictions. The Cochrane sensitivity-
maximising RCT filter was applied to MEDLINE and terms as
recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions were applied to Embase (Lefebvre 2011).

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (SK and LH/HL/CC/LA/HJ) independently
scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved records and rejected
only those that the review author definitively determined did not
meet the inclusion criteria. We obtained full texts for any studies
that could not be rejected with certainty. Two review authors (SK
and RG/HL/HJ/LA) then independently assessed each paper. We
used an in/out form to assess the inclusion (or otherwise) of full
papers into the review. If a trial was excluded after the full paper
was obtained, the study and its reason for exclusion were recorded.
Differences in selection were resolved by discussion or by consult-
ing a third review author (KR).
Data extraction and management
One review author (SK, JC, or LA) extracted original reports of
trial results, which a second review author (KR or EL) checked.
Differences between review authors’ extraction results were re-
solved by discussion and, when necessary, by consulting a third
review author.
We extracted data as follows, which are reported in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
1. General information: published/unpublished, title, authors,
source, country, year of publication, trial dates, additional
publications.
2. Trial characteristics: design, setting, duration,
randomisation (and method), allocation concealment (and
method), blinding (outcome assessors), check of blinding,
funding/conflict of interest.
3. Participants: inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, total
number and number in comparison groups, sex/age, ethnicity,
BMI, lipid levels, blood pressure, similarity of groups at baseline,
withdrawals/losses to follow-up, assessment of adherence,
medications used, smoking status when provided.
4. Intervention: dietary information/diet provided, length of
intervention, comparison interventions, macronutrient
composition of diets.
5. Outcomes: outcomes as specified above, the main outcome
assessed in the study, other events, length of follow-up.
6. Results: for outcomes and times of assessment.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias of included studies by examining the ran-
dom sequence generation and allocation concealment, description
of dropouts and withdrawals, blinding (outcome assessment), and
selective outcome reporting. We basedassessmentonthe Cochrane
’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011), however we did not assess blind-
ing of participants, as it is difficult to blind participants to their
intervention arm in this type of dietary trial. We additionally as-
sessed whether intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. We cat-
egorised risk of bias as ’low’, ’unclear’, or ’high’. One review author
(SK or LA) assessed the risk of bias, which a second review author
(EL) checked. Any disagreements were resolved by a third review
author (KR).
We did not exclude studies on the basis of risk of bias. In particular,
we examined the following factors.
1. Method of randomisation
2. Allocation concealment
3. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
4. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
5. Intention-to-treat analysis
6. Selective reporting (reporting bias)
7. Groups comparable at baseline
8. Other (e.g. power analysis, analysis issues)

 Measures of treatment effect
We processed data in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). For continu-
ous outcomes, we compared net changes (i.e. intervention group
minus control group differences) and calculated a mean difference
(MD) and 95% CI for each study.
Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were expressed as mmol/L (and
converted from mg/dL by multiplying by conversion factors of
0.0259 for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, and by 0.0113 for
triglycerides where necessary) (JAMA 2004).
We converted standard errors to standard deviations by the equa-
tion given in the Cochrane Handbook where necessary.
We included studies reporting multiple comparison groups in this
review. Where this was the case, we used the data for the control
group for each intervention group comparison and reduced the
weight assigned to the control group by dividing the control group
N by the number of intervention groups. We included two studies
that had two interventions. One did not provide mean values
and could not be included in the meta-analysis (Brownlee 2010),
and the control group N of the second study was halved (Tighe
2010-W).
We aimed to include cluster-randomised trials in this review by
using the unit of randomisation (cluster) as the number of obser-
vations. Where necessary, we would have utilised individual-level
means and standard deviations adjusted for clustering together
with the number of clusters in the denominator, in order to weight
the trials appropriately. We found no trials where participants were
randomised by cluster/groups.
We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of
effect, with the exception of HDL cholesterol, where an increase
in this outcome is a positive finding.
Assessment of heterogeneity
For each outcome, we conducted tests of heterogeneity using the
Chi2 test of heterogeneity and the I2 statistic. Where heterogeneity
was low, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis. If we detected
substantial heterogeneity (I2 of 50% or greater), we looked for pos-
sible explanations (e.g. participants and intervention). If we were
unable to explain the source of heterogeneity, we considered the
following options: provide a narrative overview and not aggregate
the studies at all, or use a random-effects model with appropriate
cautious interpretation.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using Cochrane’s statistical soft-
ware, Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014). We entered continuous
data as the change in means and standard deviations from baseline
to follow-up measurements.
We aimed to categorise studies into two subgroups: primary-pre-
vention populations (healthy individuals or those at high risk of
CVD) or secondary-prevention populations (those with a pre-ex-
isting diagnosis of CVD). However, we identified no studies in
secondary-prevention populations.
Studies reported results either as absolute values at the endpoint
or as change from baseline. For the pooled analysis, we reported
change from baseline values. Where papers did not report results
as change from baseline, we calculated this and for the standard
deviation differences followed the methods presented in Section
16.1.3.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions for imputing these (Higgins 2011), and assumed a corre-
lation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up measures as suggested
by Follman (Follmann 1992).
We planned to use sensitivity analysis to take into account the
influence of various factors, for example (a) risk of bias, and (b)
exclusion of particularly small and underpowered trials. However,
all studies were of similar risk of bias and size, and therefore no
sensitivityanalyseswere undertaken. We alsoplannedtoundertake
assessment of funnel plots and tests of asymmetry to assess possible
publication bias, but there were insufficient studies included in
the review (Egger 1997).
Quality of the evidence
We presented the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome
according to the GRADE approach, which takes into account is-
sues not only related to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsis-
tency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external validity,
such as directness of results. Two review authors (LA, SK) rated
the quality for each outcome. We presented a summary of the evi-
dence in a ’Summary of findings’ table, which provides key infor-
mation about the best estimate of the magnitude of the effect, in
relative terms and absolute differences for each relevant compari-
son of alternative management strategies, numbers of participants
and trials addressing each important outcome, and the rating of
the overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome. We
created the ’Summary of findings’ table based on the methods de-
scribed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions (Higgins 2011). We presented results on the outcomes as
described in Types of outcome measures.
In addition, we established an appendix ’Checklist to aid consis-
tency and reproducibility of GRADE assessments’ to help with
standardisation of the ’Summary of findings’ table (Appendix 3)
(Meader 2014).

reference management software and combined. The combined ar-
ticles were then de-duplicated using the EndNote software, leav-
ing 9635 combined hits. A further 42 potentially relevant records
were identified from handsearching relevant reviews, and 1427
from searching clinical trials registers. A total of 414 full-text ar-
ticles were assessed for eligibility, and 9 studies (reported in 13
references) were included in the review, of which 8 were included
in meta-analysis.

 Included studies
Details of the studies included in the review are shown in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
We identified nine different studies that met the inclusion cri-
teria for this review (the study by Tighe reported two differ-
ent relevant intervention arms in the same paper) (Brownlee
2010; Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Katcher 2008; Kristensen 2012;
Lankinen 2014; Maki 2010; Tighe 2010-W; Tighe 2010-WO;
Zhang 2011). We found no studies that reported the effect of
whole grain foods or diets on CVD mortality or CVD events and
morbidity (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty, total stroke). All nine included studies reported the
effect of whole grain foods or diets on major risk factors for CVD
(lipids and blood pressure) according to the inclusion criteria for
this review outlined in Types of outcome measures. All nine stud-
ies were parallel RCTs. The nine included studies involved a total
of 1414 participants. Four of the nine studies had total sample
sizes below 100 participants (Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Katcher
2008; Kristensen 2012).
In four studies, both the whole grain and control diets were energy-
restricted weight loss diets (Harris 2014; Katcher 2008; Kristensen
2012; Maki 2010).
In one study, the whole grain was oats (Maki 2010). In five studies,
the diets included a range of whole grain foods mainly based on
wheat (Brownlee 2010; Harris 2014; Katcher 2008; Kristensen
2012; Lankinen 2014); one study used a mixture of rye and wheat
products (Giacco 2013); one study used whole grain brown rice
(Zhang 2011); and one study had two intervention arms, one
based on whole grain wheat products and the other a mixture of
whole grain wheat and oats (Tighe 2010-W).
Seven studies described their control group diet as refined foods;
one study described the control diet as usual diet (Brownlee 2010);
and in the remaining study the control was white rice (Zhang
2011).
The length of the intervention was 12 weeks in seven studies and
16 weeks in two studies (Brownlee 2010; Zhang 2011).
Population and setting
Three studies included participants who were overweight or
obese (Brownlee 2010; Kristensen 2012; Maki 2010); two stud-
ies included participants with metabolic syndrome (Giacco 2013;
Lankinen 2014); one study included participants who were over-
weight or obese and had metabolic syndrome (Katcher 2008); and
one study included participants who had risk factors for metabolic
syndrome (Harris 2014), including obesity. One study recruited
participants with BMI from 18.5 to 35 kg/m2 or with signs of
metabolic syndrome or moderate hypercholesterolaemia (Tighe
2010-W). One study included participants with metabolic syn-
drome or diabetes (Zhang 2011).
Three studies were conducted in the USA (Harris 2014; Katcher
2008; Maki 2010), two in the UK (one in Scotland, Tighe
2010-W, and one in England, Brownlee 2010), one in Finland
(Lankinen 2014), one in Denmark (Kristensen 2012), one in both
Italy and Finland (Giacco 2013), and one in China (Zhang 2011).
Intervention
The interventions in eight of the nine studies included the pro-
vision of whole grain foods to the study participants (Brownlee
2010; Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Kristensen 2012; Lankinen
2014; Maki 2010; Tighe 2010-W; Zhang 2011). In the remaining
study the participants were given a list and description of foods
and a daily serving of whole grain foods to aim for depending
on individualised energy requirements set out by a study dietitian
(Katcher 2008). In two studies (Brownlee 2010; Kristensen 2012),
a range of foods were available, and the studies aimed to allow
participants to choose their whole grain foods. The Giacco 2013
study prespecified a proportion of whole grain that was required
to be in the form of bread (this differed slightly between the two
different study centres), and participants were also provided with
oat biscuits for snacks. In the study by Harris 2014, a range of
grain types were provided including wheat, oats and rice, with
77% from wheat products. In this study prepared meals and snacks
were provided to the study participants. The study by Maki 2010
also provided ready-to-eat cereals. In the study by Tighe 2010-W,
participants had three food servings replaced by study foods (either
whole grain wheat or whole grain wheat and oats). In all studies
except Brownlee 2010, control participants also received like-for-
like food or advice but with refined products.
Three studies reported that participants also received advice from
a dietitian (Katcher 2008; Kristensen 2012; Maki 2010), and two
studies encouraged participants to undertake a prescribed amount
of physical activity each week (Katcher 2008; Maki 2010).
All nine trials reported daily dietary components of the interven-
tion diets. One study reported daily intake of energy as a change
from baseline (Brownlee 2010), where the energy intake increased
in the two intervention groups but decreased in the control group.
In the four studies that aimed to reduce energy intake as part of
their intervention (Harris 2014; Katcher 2008; Kristensen 2012;
Maki 2010), only two reported baseline and end-of-study daily
energy, where as expected results showed a reduction in energy
consumption (Katcher 2008; Maki 2010). Of the remaining stud-
ies, there was an increase in energy consumption in both groups
by the end of the intervention in the study by Giacco 2013 and no
difference in energy intake across or between groups in the studies
11

 by Tighe 2010-W, Lankinen 2014, and Zhang 2011. As can be
seen in Table 1, most studies reported similar dietary components
between intervention and control groups (or did not report the
statistical significance, but data appear to be similar). There was
a difference in carbohydrates and fibre (g/day) between the whole
grain groups and the control groups in two studies (Brownlee
2010; Kristensen 2012), but no other dietary components dif-
fered. In the Giacco 2013 study, a difference in protein intake was
seen between those in the whole grain group and those in the con-
trol group. Zhang 2011 reported lower intake of carbohydrates (P
= 0.03) and dairy products in the brown rice group (P = 0.02),
and Lankinen 2014 reported that total fat decreased in the whole
grain group.
We relied on the study authors’ definition of whole grain for this
review. Definitions and level of whole grain in the diets where
reported are shown in Table 1. This varied between studies. In two
studies a whole grain product was defined as at least 51% whole
grain by dry weight (Giacco 2013; Harris 2014); in one study it
was 50% by dry weight (Kristensen 2012); in one study the whole
grain content of commercially available whole grain foods used
ranged from 34 to 80.8 g per 100 g dry weight (and one product
was included with 11.2 g per 100 g cooked weight) (Brownlee
2010); and in one study products were identified as whole grain
if a whole grain was listed as the first ingredient on the food label
(Katcher 2008). Two studies did not report the definition of whole
grain used (Lankinen 2014; Tighe 2010-W), but one of these
did report the number of servings (Tighe 2010-W). One study
used exclusively whole grain oats (Maki 2010), and another study
defined the brown rice used as whole grain (Zhang 2011).
Funding
Four studies were funded wholly by independent sources, two by
the UK Food Standards Agency (Brownlee 2010; Tighe 2010-W),
one by a European Commission grant (Giacco 2013), and one
through Chinese national funding organisations (Zhang 2011),
although in three of these studies some of the test foods were
supplied by commercial companies (Brownlee 2010; Giacco 2013;
Tighe 2010-W). All of the other five studies reported funding or
some partial funding by organisations with interests in cereals.
Excluded studies
We excluded two studies because the macronutrient content of
the diets was not reported adequately (Chang 2013; Wang 2013).
We excluded 13 studies because the length of the intervention
was less than 12 weeks (Charlton 2012; Davidson 1991; Johnston
1998; Karmally 2005; Keenan 2002; Kim 2008; Leinonen 2000;
McGeoch 2013; Reynolds2000; Van Horn 1988; VanHorn 1991;
Vitaglione 2015; Zhang 2012). This update of the review only in-
cluded studies with an intervention length of 12 weeks or longer.
We also excluded studies that only reported outcomes related to
diabetes and measures of glucose and insulin or body weight alone
that did not also report lipid or blood pressure outcomes. Con-
sequently, we have excluded some short-term studies that we in-
cludedinthe original versionof thisreview(Kelly 2007): Davidson
1991, Johnston 1998, Karmally 2005, Keenan 2002, Leinonen
2000, Reynolds 2000, Van Horn 1988, and Van Horn 1991. Ad-
ditionally, one study in the original review no longer met the inclu-
sion criteria as it did not report relevant outcomes (Pereira 2002).
We excluded a further study because reporting of macronutrient
intake was insufficient to determine if the diet composition was
similar in the intervention and control groups (Pins 2002); this
was marked as unclear in the original review, but as we were unable
to obtain any further data from the reported supplementary table
or from the authors, this study has been excluded for this update.
These changes mean that none of the studies in the original review,
Kelly 2007, are included in this update.
Risk of bias in included studies
Overview
The reporting of methods was poor, therefore we rated the risk of
bias as unclear in the majority of studies (Figure 2; Figure 3).

 Allocation
Seven studies reported an adequate method of randomisation
(Brownlee 2010; Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Katcher 2008;
Kristensen 2012; Lankinen 2014; Tighe 2010-W), but only two of
these also clearly reported concealment of allocation to treatment
groups (Giacco 2013; Tighe 2010-W). The remaining studies did
not provide information on allocation process.
Blinding
Only three studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assess-
ment (Katcher 2008; Tighe 2010-W; Zhang 2011). We rated all
of the remaining studies as unclear for this domain as no informa-
tion was provided.
Incomplete outcome data
A number of studies had high levels of dropouts/losses to fol-
low-up, and reporting of the details of these dropouts was poor.
Three studies fully reported numbers and reasons for incomplete
data (Katcher 2008; Lankinen 2014; Zhang 2011), whereas five
studies had differential dropouts between treatment groups and
were therefore rated as at high risk of attrition bias (Brownlee
2010; Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Maki 2010; Tighe 2010-W).
One study reported an adequate intention-to-treat analysis for
outcomes of interest to this review (Zhang 2011). One further
study provided some data as a modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation, but did not provide this in a format that was useable for
the review (baseline values for this population were not reported)
(Maki 2010).
Selective reporting
While all studies appeared to report all outcomes as intended,
not enough information was available to judge the potential risk
of selective reporting bias. Of the nine included studies, eight
reported that the study protocol was registered, and one did not
report if a protocol was registered (Maki 2010).
Other potential sources of bias
Power
We rated three studies as being at low risk of other sources of
bias (Brownlee 2010; Maki 2010; Tighe 2010-W), as the power
calculations were based on relevant outcomes (LDL cholesterol
or total cholesterol, or both), and the predicated sample size was
met. We rated all of the other studies as unclear on this factor. The
remaining six studies based their power calculations on outcomes
that were not relevant to this review (Giacco 2013; Harris 2014;
Katcher 2008; Kristensen 2012; Lankinen 2014; Zhang 2011),
and it is therefore uncertain if they were fully powered to detect a
difference in the key outcomes of relevance here.
Compliance to diet
None of the studies specifically reported any problems with com-
pliance to the diets. In one study (Kristensen 2012), the authors
reported high compliance with the diet, but this was only reported
in 57 of 72 female participants who completed food diaries. The
Zhang 2011 study reported mean adherence 90.0 +/- 17.1% in
the white rice group and 88.7 +/- 23.3% in the brown rice group.
However, a number of studies reported high levels of dropouts and
losses to follow-up, and full details of reasons for dropout were not
fully reported.
Comparability at baseline
Five studies had comparable groups at baseline (Brownlee 2010;
Giacco 2013; Harris 2014; Kristensen 2012; Lankinen 2014).
The remaining four studies reported some differences between
intervention and control for some baseline variables (Katcher
2008; Maki 2010; Tighe 2010-W; Zhang 2011); it was unclear
whether these were of any significance, as they may have oc-
curred by chance. Details are reported in the ’Risk of bias’ table in
Characteristics of included studies for each study.
Potential confounders
Body weight
Differential changesinbodyweightbetweeninterventionandcon-
trol groups could lead to differences in lipid levels between groups.
However, we found no evidence of differences in body weight be-
tween intervention and control groups. Six included studies re-
ported data on body weight, and five of these could be summarised
in a meta-analysis (see Analysis 1.1). The four studies with energy-
restricted diets all showed weight loss in both arms of their studies.
In three studies this was greater in the intervention arm (Harris
2014; Kristensen 2012; Maki 2010), and in the fourth study this
was greater in the control arm (Katcher 2008). The remaining
studies did not show any clear pattern of weight loss between in-
tervention and control groups. There was no difference between
groups in the pooled study estimate of weight loss (mean differ-
ence (MD) -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.04 to 0.23). In
the study that could not be pooled (Brownlee 2010), the median

 weight change in the whole grain intervention group was a gain of
0.2 (standard deviation (SD) 13.1) kg compared to a zero weight
change (SD 13.9) in the control arm. Five studies reported data
on the BMI of participants, and there was no difference between
groups in the pooled study estimate (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.24 to
0.01) (Analysis 1.2).
Dietary fibre
Any reported differences in dietary fibre content between the treat-
ment and control groups have been reported in Table 1. The focus
of this review was to assess whether whole grain diets have a ben-
eficial effect on CVD and major risk factors for CVD in order to
inform recommendations as to whether more whole grain foods
should be included in the diets of the general public. All whole
grains contain dietary fibre. Dietary fibre content may potentially
be a contributing factor to any differences between whole grain
diets and the control diets, but it was not the primary focus of this
review.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparisonWhole grain
cereals for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular
disease
Primary outcomes
We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain foods
or diets on:
1. total cardiovascular mortality; or
2. cardiovascular events (e.g. fatal and non-fatal myocardial
infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke).
Secondary outcomes
Blood lipids
Total cholesterol
Eight studies reported total cholesterol, and data from six stud-
ies (seven comparisons) could be summarised in a meta-analy-
sis (Analysis 1.3). The pooled analysis showed no effect on total
cholesterol (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.21; 722 participants;
6 studies (7 comparisons); low-quality evidence). There was no
substantial heterogeneity.
Two studies could not be summarised in the meta-analysis. In
one study this was because data were presented as medians only.
In this study there was no difference in total cholesterol between
participants in the two whole grain groups and participants in the
control group (Brownlee 2010). The remaining study reported
percentage change in total cholesterol levels rather than absolute
levels, and data were aggregated over all follow-up points (from
4 to 12 weeks). The data in this study were reported for a per-
protocol population with approximately 24% of participants in
the whole grain arm and 35% in the control arm excluded from
the analysis (fewer than reported to have completed the study).
The authors of this study found that the total cholesterol level was
reduced more with whole grain ready-to-eat oat cereal than with
control (5.4% (standard error (SE) 0.8%) versus 2.9% (SE 0.9%),
P = 0.038) during the treatment period (Maki 2010).
LDL cholesterol
Nine studies reported LDL cholesterol, and data from seven stud-
ies (eight comparators) could be summarised in a meta-analysis
(Analysis 1.4). The pooled analysis showed that there was no ef-
fect on LDL cholesterol (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.16; 770
participants). There was no substantial heterogeneity.
Two studies could not be summarised in the meta-analysis. In
one study this was because data were presented as medians only.
In this study there was no difference in LDL cholesterol between
participants in the two whole grain groups and participants in the
control group (Brownlee 2010). The remaining study reported
percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels rather than absolute
levels, and data were aggregated over all follow-up points (from
4 to 12 weeks). The data in this study were reported for a per-
protocol population with approximately 24% of participants in
the whole grain arm and 35% in the control arm excluded from the
analysis (fewer than reported to have completed the study). The
authors of this study found that LDL cholesterol level was reduced
more with whole grain ready-to-eat oat cereal than with control
(8.7% (SE 1.0%) versus 4.3% (SE 1.1%), P = 0.005) during the
treatment period (Maki 2010).
HDL cholesterol
Eight studies reported HDL cholesterol,and data from seven stud-
ies (eight comparators) could be summarised in a meta-analysis
(Analysis 1.5). The pooled analysis showed no effect on HDL
cholesterol (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.01; 772 participants).
There was no substantial heterogeneity. In the one study that could
not be summarised in the meta-analysis, there were no differences
in HDL cholesterol between the whole grain groups and the con-
trol group (Brownlee 2010).
Triglycerides
Eight studies reported triglyceride levels, and data from seven stud-
ies (eight comparators) could be summarised in a meta-analysis
(Analysis 1.6). The pooled analysis showed no effect on triglyc-
erides (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13; 771 participants). There
16

 was no heterogeneity. In the one study that could not be sum-
marised in the meta-analysis, there were no differences in triglyc-
eride levels between the whole grain groups and the control group
(Brownlee 2010)..
Blood pressure
Systolic blood pressure
Eight studies reported systolic blood pressure, and data from seven
studies (eight comparators) could be summarised in a meta-analy-
sis (Analysis 1.7).The pooled analysis showed no effect on systolic
blood pressure (MD 0.04, 95% CI -1.67 to 1.75; 768 partici-
pants). There was no substantial heterogeneity. In the study that
could not be included in the meta-analysis (Brownlee 2010), there
were no effects of whole grain foods compared with the control
group.
Diastolic blood pressure
Eight studies reported diastolic blood pressure, and data from
seven studies (eight comparators) could be summarised in a meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.8). The pooled analysis showed no effect on
diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.16, 95% CI -0.89 to 1.21; 768
participants). There was no heterogeneity. In the study that could
not be included in the meta-analysis (Brownlee 2010), there were
no effects of whole grain foods compared with the control group.
Quality of life
No studies reported quality of life as an outcome measure, al-
though one study did report measures of satisfaction with the diets
(Katcher 2008). There were no differences between intervention
and control groups for “sense of a healthy lifestyle”, “convenience”,
“family dynamics”, “preoccupation with food”, and “negative feel-
ings”, but those participants on the whole grain diets did report
more (P = 0.04) difficulty with meal planning and preparation.
Adverse events
Two studies reported adverse events. In one study (Maki 2010),
the frequencies of adverse events of any type (whether related to the
study products or not) were reported to be similar between groups
(59.8%forthe whole graingroupand52.4%forthe control group,
P = 0.321). The most common adverse events in both groups
were respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. Adverse
events the authors considered to be related to the study products
were: nausea (2 participants in the whole grain oat group), flatu-
lence (2 participants in the whole grain oat group), gastroenteritis
(1 participant in the control group), gastroesophageal reflux (1
participant in the control group), and vomiting (1 participant in
the control group). Adverse events that led to drop out from the
study were an infectious cyst (1 control) and spinal stenosis (1
control), but the study authors did not consider these to be related
to the study product. In the Brownlee 2010 study, 3 participants
in both whole grain groups (different levels of whole grain) and
no participants in the control group reported intolerance to study
foods.

Summary of main results
This systematic review summarised nine RCTs examining the ef-
fect of whole grain foods or diets compared with refined grain
foods or a usual diet control on risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease over 12 weeks or longer. All studies were conducted in pri-
mary-prevention populations. None of the studies reported on our
primary outcomes of mortality (total or cardiovascular) or cardio-
vascular events. The nine included studies reported the effect of
whole grain diets on the secondary outcomes of this review, that is
lipids or blood pressure, or both. We assessed all included studies
as being at high or unclear risk of bias. The duration of the inter-
ventions in the included studies ranged from 12 to 16 weeks.
Overall, our meta-analysis found no differences between whole
grain and control groups for any lipid or blood pressure outcomes,
with similarmacronutrientcontentsbetweenwhole grain andcon-
trol groups. Weight or BMI (as potential confounders) also did not
differ between groups. Heterogeneity was low or non-substantial.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
While there is growing evidence from observational studies that
whole grains have benefits for cardiovascular disease, we found
insufficient evidence from RCTs of a duration of 12 weeks or
longer to draw any conclusions.
We found no studies on the effect of whole grains on CVD mor-
tality or events. The included studies reported lipid and blood
pressure outcomes. Only a few trials reported quality of life or
adverse events.
We included studies in this review if there was a comparison be-
tween a whole grain food or diet and a diet or food containing
no whole grains or fewer whole grains. We did not aim to assess
the effects of dietary fibre, although any beneficial effects of whole
grains may well be associated with the dietary fibre content (Brown
1999). We have reported the dietary fibre content of the foods
or diets in Table 1, and, as would be expected, it is consistently
higher in the whole grain diets than in the control diets.
Most of the studies reported the effect of predominantly whole
grain wheat, with one study reporting oats (Maki 2010), one
17

 brown rice (Zhang 2011), and one study reporting the effect of
combined whole grain wheat and oats (Tighe 2010-WO). There
is a lack of evidence to date from longer-term studies (> 12 weeks)
of the effect of wholegrain oats. The one trial that studied oats
exclusively found reductions in total and LDL cholesterol with
whole grain oat cereal compared to the control (Maki 2010). Oats
(and barley) also typically contain soluble non-starch polysaccha-
ride such as β-glucan, which has been associated with a choles-
terol-lowering effect of oats (Whitehead 2014). Due to the pres-
ence of β-glucan, it is possible that whole grain oats may have
differential effects than other whole grains. There is a need for
more studies of longer duration on the effect of whole grain oats
on CVD and cardiovascular risk factors (the review by Whitehead
2014 included β-glucan in a range of different forms, not just as
whole grain oats). Regarding studies that examined whole grain
wheat, there were no differences between whole grain and control
groups for individual studies or when studies were pooled in meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4).
It is possible that body weight change may account for any ob-
served changes in cardiovascular risk factors. While we have re-
ported weight data in this review, most of the studies had insuffi-
cient power to measure small changes in weight. We also included
studies in the review if the only difference in dietary composition
was substitution of refined grains by whole grains, and therefore
the macronutrient contents and the overall energy intake of the
diets were similar.
Quality of the evidence
Most of the included studies had a number of methodological un-
certainties, and all of the included studies were at high or unclear
risk of bias. However, heterogeneity was low or non-substantial.
The duration of interventions included in the review was short,
sample sizes were small, and many trials had a large number of
dropouts. Adverse events were generally not reported. These fac-
tors make overall interpretation of the findings of the review dif-
ficult.
We aimed to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each
primary outcome according to the GRADE approach, which takes
into account issues not only related to internal validity (risk of bias,
inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external
validity, such as directness of results. The included studies were
RCTs, but they did not report the primary outcomes (n = 6) of this
review, therefore we could not assess the overall quality (Summary
of findings for the main comparison). For secondary outcomes, we
assessed total cholesterol, which we downgraded by two levels: for
inconsistency due to variability in the direction of effect (Appendix
3), and for imprecision because “clinical action would differ if
the upper versus the lower boundary of the confidence interval
represented the truth” (Guyatt 2011)
Potential biases in the review process
We carried out a comprehensive search across major databases for
interventions involving whole grains for this review. In addition,
we screened the reference lists of systematic reviews and contacted
authors for information when needed. Two review authors carried
out all screening, inclusion and exclusion, and data abstraction,
and one review author conducted analyses, which a second review
author checked.
We excluded a number of trials of short duration (< 12 weeks),
as we were interested in the sustained and longer-term effects of
increased whole grain intake, which are more relevant to public
health interventions. However, this did limit the number of trials
eligible for inclusion.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Evidence from two different meta-analyses of observational co-
hort studies suggests that those consuming 48 to 80 g/day (3 to
5 servings/day) compared to rare consumers of whole grains (Ye
2012), or 2.5 servings/day compared to 0.2 servings/day, have a
21% lower risk of CVD (Mellen 2008). However, observational
studies can be confounded by variables that cannot be controlled
or that remain unaccounted for, which can impact on the results.
However, to our knowledge there are no previous systematic re-
views of RCTs examining the effects of whole grains on CVD risk
factors and clinical events. The intervention length in the studies
included in this review ranged from 12 to 16 weeks. In contrast,
many of the observational studies that report beneficial effects of
whole grains have follow-up periods of many years (Ye 2012).
The current review is limited in its findings. All trials were short
term and hence none reported clinical events, and there was in-
sufficient information on CVD risk factors to be able to draw any
conclusions about the effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular
health.
Short-term trials (< 6 weeks) have reported beneficial effects of
whole grain oats on lipids (Johnston 1998; Karmally 2005), but
these are very short-term studies, and it is unclear if such effects
are sustained over the long term.

Implications for practice
We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
of the effect of whole grain diets or foods on cardiovascular mor-
tality or events. Only evidence relating to the effect of whole grains
on lipids or blood pressure is currently available, and most studies
were at unclear or high risk of bias, with the longest study followed
up to only 16 weeks. It is unclear to what extent whole grain foods
18

 contribute to cardiovascular risk. The results from this review do
not support changing dietary habits of patients for short periods of
time to obtain better control of cardiovascular risk factors. There
may be a benefit if diet is changed on a long-term basis but the
RCT evidence from longer term studies is not currently available.
Implications for research
There is currently no evidence from RCTs of the effect of whole
grain diets on cardiovascular mortality or events. This is a clear gap
in the evidence, and well-designed, adequately powered studies are
needed of sufficient duration to assess the impact of whole grain
diets on cardiovascular mortality or events. The Global Burden
of Disease Study attributed 1.7 million deaths worldwide in 2015
to ischaemic heart disease, and 3.1 million deaths from all causes
to low whole grain diets (Global Burden of Disease Study 2015).
These figures were derived from longitudinal cohort studies, and
there is a need for RCTs in this area. While this review found 9
studies that reported the effects of whole grain diets on lipids or
blood pressure, most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias,
and no study followed up for longer than 16 weeks. There is also
a need for well-designed, adequately powered, long-term (follow-
up at one year or more) RCTs to ascertain the effects of whole
grains in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular
disease. While there are a number of short-term studies on oats (<
12 weeks) (Kelly 2007), there are few longer-term studies on oats
(12 weeks or longer). The higher soluble non-starch polysaccha-
ride content, such as ß-glucan, of oats (and barley) has previously
been linked with beneficial effects on risk factors for cardiovascular
disease, but there are insufficient trials of 12 weeks or longer with
oats.

Methods
Setting: UK (Cambridge and Newcastle)
Design: randomisation by minimisation with even distribution of participants in each
group by age sex and BMI, parallel group
Dates: trial dates not reported
Intervention duration: 16 weeks
Follow-up: no postintervention follow-up
Focus: to compare the effects of different levels of whole grain diets (2 intervention
groups) to replace refined grains in the diets of overweight and obese people who were
not whole grain consumers on markers of cardiovascular risk
Participants
N: 316 randomised (to 3 groups) (85/105 completers in the lower-dose intervention
group, 81/105 in the higher-dose intervention group, and 100/106 in the control group)

Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg):intervention(lowerdose):79.0 SD9.8; intervention
(higher dose): 79.0 SD 9.3; control: 79.8 SD 10.2
Medications used: not reported
Interventions
Whole grain group 1: (lower whole grain; 60 g WG/d as 3 servings for 16 weeks) (n =
105 randomised, 85 completed)
Whole grain group 2: (higher whole grain; 60 g WG/d as 3 servings for 8 weeks, then
120 g WG/d as 5 servings for 8 weeks) (n = 105 randomised, 81 completed)
Control: (usual diet) (n = 106 randomised, 100 completed)
Description of dietary intervention: the 2 intervention groups were provided with a
range of whole grain foods (whole wheat bread, Shredded Wheat Fruitful, Cheerios,

porridge oats, brown basmati rice, whole wheat pasta, Weetabix, porridge, oat bars, and
whole grain crisps) and asked to substitute ‘like for like’ for refined grain foods to a
prescribed amount. The approach was chosen to reflect choices of whole grains in a free-
living population
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: none
Assessment of dietary adherence: FFQ (7-day recall) at weeks 8 and 16
Was the diet energy reduced? no
Comparability of diet composition: There was an (P < 0.05) increase in carbohydrate
intake in both whole grain groups at week 8 and week 16, and between control and
whole grain group 1 and whole grain group 2. There was also an increase in total energy
intake in whole grain group 1 at week 8 and wholegrain group 2 at week 16. There was
an increase in protein in whole grain group 1 at week 8 and whole grain group 2 at
week 16. Percentage energy from fat decreased in whole grain group 2 at weeks 8 and
16. Dietary fibre increased in both whole grain groups at both week 8 and week 16. (See
Table 1.)
Change in diet over time: Whole grain intake (estimated from FFQ data): at baseline
WG intake was < 20 g/day for each group; for the control group, WG intake averaged
19 (SD 19.9) g/d; for whole grain group 1, WG intake was 74 (SD 28.5) g/d averaged
for weeks 8 and 16 (no significant difference between week 8 and 16); for whole grain
group 2, WG intake was 83 (SD 3) g/d at week 8 and 115 (SD 39.6) g/d at week 16.
(See Table 1.)
There were differences between baseline and intervention groups in frequency of con-
sumption of breads and breakfast cereals at week 16 (P < 0.05):
• bread: control: 1.46/day (SD 1.46); whole grain group 1: 1.99 (SD 5); whole
grain group 2: 3.06 (SD 1.93);
• breakfast cereals: control: 0.57 (SD 0.50); whole grain group 1: 1.00 (SD 0.52);
whole grain group 2: 1.00 (SD 0.65).
A difference between whole grain group 2 and control was seen for fruit intake after 16
weeks (p<0.005)
There were no differences in other food groups (meat, fish, potatoes, rice and pasta, dairy
and egg products, milk, spreads, sweets and snacks, vegetables
Outcomes
Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerides (TAG; mmol/L),
weight (kg), body fat (%), systolic BP (mm Hg), diastolic BP (mmHg), NEFA (mmol/
L), markers of insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, inflammatory and coagulatory
status. States no conflicts of interest for any authors
Funding/conflicts of interest
Fully funded by UK Food Standards Agency (project N02036). Study foods were pro-
vided by commercial suppliers (Cereal Partners Worldwide, Weetabix, Allied Bakeries,
PepsiCo)
Notes
The authors noted that “the participants appeared to include the whole grain foods as
a dietary addition as opposed to the dietary substitution that was explicitly requested”.
This conclusion is supported by the diet composition data. Adverse effects: 3 participants
in both whole grain groups reported intolerance to study foods, none in control group

Methods
Setting: Finland (Kuopio) and Italy (Naples)
Design: parallel groups (with stratification for sex, age, and BMI)
Dates: March 2008 to May 2014
Intervention duration: 12 weeks
Follow-up: no postintervention follow-up
Focus: to compare the effects of diets containing whole grain rye or wheat cereals com-
pared to refined grains on markers of metabolic syndrome in people with metabolic
syndrome
Participants
N: 146 randomised (62/71 completers in the whole grain intervention group and 61/
75 in the control group)
Inclusion criteria: male and female, aged 40 to 65 years, with metabolic syndrome
(diagnosed on National Cholesterol Education Program criteria)
Exclusion criteria: diabetes and/or renal failure (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL), liver
abnormalities (ALT/AST ratio 2 times above normal values), anaemia (haemoglobin <
12 g/dL), any other chronic disease, or if they used any drug able to influence glucose
and lipid metabolism and inflammation (corticosteroid hormones other than inhaled
corticosteroids, hypolipidaemic and/or anti-inflammatory drugs); however, in the Kuo-
pio study centre the use of cholesterol lowering medications (statins) was allowed
Age (years): 40 to 65 years, otherwise not reported.
Sex (% men): whole grain intervention: 46.9%; control: 47.5%
Ethnicity: Italian and Finnish (ethnic composition not reported)
Baseline cardiovascular risk status:
BMI (kg/m2): whole grain intervention: 31.6 (4.6); control: 31.3 (4.4)
Total cholesterol (mmol/L): whole grain intervention: 5.15 (1.09); control: 5.28 (0.93)
HDL cholesterol (mmol/L): whole grain intervention: 6 (0.36); control: 4 (0.31)
LDL cholesterol (mmol/L): whole grain intervention: 3.26 (0.98); control: 3.41 (0.80)

Medications used: in the Kuopio study centre, some individuals were using cholesterol-
lowering medication (10 in the whole grain intervention group and 10 in the control
group), however sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding these people
Interventions
Whole grain diet group: (wheat and rye whole grain)
Control: (refined cereal foods), differed between centres
Description of dietary intervention: whole grain wheat and rye products (and smaller
amounts of oat and barley), most with a low postprandial glucose and/or insulin response.
The only difference between the whole grain and the control diet was the inclusion of a
fixed amount of whole grain or refined cereal products as the main carbohydrate source.
Aimed to include 90% sourdough bread and 10% endosperm rye bread. Naples - whole
grain products including whole wheat bread (plus some endosperm rye bread), whole
wheat pasta, barley kernels, whole grain oat biscuits and breakfast cereals (all bran sticks
and flakes). Kuopio - whole grain and control diets aimed to include 20% to 25% of the
total daily energy intake as study breads. The type of bread consumed by the Kuopio
participants was 50% commercial whole grain rye bread, 40% endosperm rye bread,
and 10% sourdough whole wheat bread, and participants were advised to replace their
habitual potato consumption with 210 g dry weight of whole wheat pasta per week, and
were given whole oat biscuits for snacks. Test products in both diets provided free of
charge on a weekly basis. Also given written instructions and recipes

Interventions
Whole grain diet group (whole grain products, variety of grain types)
Control (refined grain products)
Description of dietary intervention: the whole grain diet group consumed all WG
products from a variety of grain types; those receiving the control diet consumed the
refined grain counterpart. The top 3 grains consumed were wheat, oats, and rice with the
whole grain diet and wheat, rice, and corn with the refined grain diet. Wheat products
constituted 77% of the whole grain diets and 63% of the control diets. Diets were tailored
to individual energy requirements; the whole grain diets contained between 163 and 301
g/whole grain per day, and the refined grain diets no whole grains. Both diets comprised
an isocaloric weight maintenance diet for 6 weeks followed by an energy-reduced diet for
the next 6 weeks (reduced by ~500 kilocalories/d). All meals and snacks were prepared
at metabolic kitchens on the university campus. Participants had to go to the kitchen to
pick up or eat their meals
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: none
Assessment of dietary adherence: compliance forms (all food provided)
Was the diet energy reduced? yes
Comparability of diet composition: both diets were designed to have the same
macronutrient composition and to meet National Cholesterol Education Program guide-
lines for saturated fat (< 7% E), mono- and polyunsaturated fats (~10% and ~7% E)
, total cholesterol (< 200 mg/d), and total fibre (> 20 g/d). Participants consumed all
study foods and did not consume any additional non-study foods on 86% of reported
days. Physical activity levels were stable. (See Table 1.)

Interventions
Whole grain diet group: based on a range of whole grains
Control: refined cereal foods
Description of dietary intervention:
The whole grain group were given a target number of daily whole grain servings (4, 5,
6, or 7 servings/d) based on their energy needs. The whole grain group were given a list
and description of whole grain foods to help them identify foods to include in their diet,
and they were encouraged to select foods for which a whole grain was listed as the first
ingredient. They were advised to consume 3 daily servings of whole grain foods for the
first 2 wks of the study, and then to increase to their target number of daily whole grain
servings for the remaining 10 wks. Participants in the refined grain group were also given
a list of whole grain foods and were asked not to consume any of these foods during the
study period. A registered dietitian met individually with each participant at baseline to
discuss the dietary intervention and provided educational materials
Additionally, both groups were asked to eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, 3 servings
of low-fat dairy products, and 2 servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry, per day, based on
2005 dietary guidelines for Americans. The target macronutrient composition was 55%
of energy as carbohydrate, 30% of energy as fat (with an emphasis on unsaturated fats),
and 15% of energy as protein
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: participants in both groups were encouraged to
engage in moderate physical activity for 30 min per session 3 times/wk
Assessment of dietary adherence: 3-day diet record (and a diet satisfaction question-
naire)

Interventions
Whole grain diet group: whole grain wheat
Control: refined wheat foods
Description of dietary intervention: whole grain wheat foods as part of an energy-
restricted diet to provide 105 g of whole grains daily. The whole grain or refined grain
foods were intended to replace ~2 MJ of the participants’ habitual diet, and both groups
were asked to consume 62 g of bread, 60 g pasta (uncooked), and 28 g of biscuits daily.
There was no restriction on consumption of other cereal products. Both groups were
asked to consume an energy-restricted diet with a deficit of at least 1250 kJ/d but not
less than 5000 kJ/d, with minimum protein intake of 60 g/d. The participants met with
a dietitian at least 5 times during the study. Food provided biweekly
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: none
Assessment of dietary adherence: food diary (self reported) (note only 57 of 72 women
who completed the study kept food diaries eligible for data analysis)
Was the diet energy reduced? yes (~1250 kJ/d deficit)
Comparability of diet composition: total self reported energy intake similar at weeks
1 to 6: whole grain 5830 kJ/d (SEM 190) and refined grain 5900 kJ/d (SEM 280),
but higher in refined grain group for weeks 7 to 12: whole grain 6060 kJ/d (SEM 150)
and refined grain 6330 (SEM 180) kJ/d. Carbohydrate also appears to be higher in the
refined grain group, but SEM and P values not reported. (See Table 1.)
Change in diet over time: reported at 4, 8, 12 weeks. (See Table 1.)

Interventions
Whole grain diet group: whole grain wheat and rye bread
Control: refined wheat foods
Description of dietary intervention: the whole grain group replaced their habitual
grain products with whole grain breads and a bread with low postprandial insulin re-
sponse. Products covered 20% to 25% of total energy intake and were delivered to the
participants. The fibre contents of the breads were 6.9% (endosperm rye bread), 6.4%
(whole grain wheat bread), and 10% to 14% (commercial whole grain rye breads). 1
portion of habitually used grain product, e.g. a slice of low-fibre wheat bread, was allowed
daily to increase compliance. Pasta with a fiber content of 6% was also delivered and
was instructed to be consumed at the dose equal to 3.5 dL of uncooked pasta per week.
Participants were given whole grain oat biscuits of which they were allowed to consume
1 portion per day on a voluntary basis. Biscuits contained 8 to 8.5 g/100 g of dietary
fibre and 16 to 18 g/100 g of fat, of which 4.3 to 7.7 g was saturated
The control groupreplacedtheirhabituallyusedbreadswith refinedwheatbreads(dietary
fiber 3 to 4.3 g/100 g) and other cereal products, e.g. pasta, with low-fibre products (<
6 g/100 g dietary fibre). Participants were allowed to eat a maximum of 1 to 2 portions
of rye products per day
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: none
Assessment of dietary adherence: 4-dayfoodrecord atbaseline,three 4-dayfood records
at weeks 3, 7, and 11
Was the diet energy reduced? no
Comparability of diet composition: yes. In the whole grain group, the intake of total
fat decreased, but there was no change in the quality of dietary fat. Fibre intake increased

Interventions
Whole grain diet group: whole grain oat ready-to-eat cereal
Control: low-fibre cereal foods
Description of dietary intervention: 2 portions per day of whole grain ready-to-eat oat
cereal or energy-matched low-fibre foods (control) such as corn cereals, white toast, plain
bagels, English muffins, pretzels, soda crackers, or rice cakes, as part of a reduced-energy
(~500 kilocalories/day deficit) dietary program that encouraged limiting consumption of
foodshigh inenergyandfat, portioncontrol, andregularphysical activity. All participants
were asked to avoid foods rich in viscous soluble fibre such as barley, oatmeal and oat
bran products except for the study products provided to the whole grain oat cereal group.
The whole grain oat ready-to-eat cereal (Cheerios, General Mills, Minneapolis, MN)
was packaged in ~40 g portions by the manufacturer. A registered dietitian met biweekly
with participants to monitor and reinforce dietary changes
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: regular physical activity (30 to 60 min/day) was
encouraged in both groups as part of the intervention. Physical activity was assessed using
a 7-day recall questionnaire. At baseline, the mean activity scores above resting were 118.
4 (SEM 7.6) metabolic equivalent hours in the whole grain oat group and 118.3 (SEM
10.0) in the control group. Physical activity scores increased by 9.1% (SEM 4%) in the
whole grain group and 15% (SEM 5.2%) (P = 0.710) in the control group
Assessment of dietary adherence: 3-day self reported diaries recording compliance with
provided foods, participant interview, and review of unused foods. The whole grain oat
group consumed 96.8% (SEM 0.6) of the expected servings of study foods, and the
control group consumed 95.7% (SEM 0.7) (P = 0.202)
Was the diet energy reduced? yes (~500 kilocalories/day deficit)
Comparability of diet composition: (See Table 1.) As designed, both groups reduced
energy intakes; there was no difference between groups at week 12, although the control
group showed a larger reduction in energy intake at week 4. The percentage of total daily
energy intake from carbohydrate was greater at week 12 in the whole grain oat group
than in the control group (P = 0.017). Total and soluble fibre increased as expected
Change in diet over time: as above for energy. (See Table 1.)

Notes
Adverse effects: the frequencies of adverse events (of any type, whether related to the
study products or not) were reported to be similar between groups (59.8% for the whole
grain group and 52.4% for the control group, P = 0.321). The most common adverse
events in both groups were respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. Most
adverse events were mild and not related to the study product. Adverse events the authors
considered related to the study products were nausea (2 people in the whole grain oat
group), flatulence (2 people in the whole grain oat group), gastroenteritis (1 person in the
control group), gastroesophageal reflux (1 person in the control group), and vomiting
(1 person in the control group). Adverse events that led to drop out from the study were
an infectious cyst (1 control) and spinal stenosis (1 control), but the study authors did
not consider these to be related to the study product

Description of dietary intervention: after a 4-week run-in period on the refined grain
diet, the intervention groups had 3 servings/d of refined cereal foods replaced by either
3 servings of whole wheat foods (70 to 80 g wholemeal bread and 30 to 40 g whole grain
cereals) or with 1 serving of whole wheat foods and 2 servings of oats. The study foods,
both refined and whole grain, were products widely available from UK food retailers.
Apart from the whole grain foods supplied, participants selected their own foods to eat
and advice on which foods to replace with whole grain servings was standardised to each
participant’s regular diet
Incentives: not reported

Interventions
White rice: the 2 types of rice in the study were from the same batch; the white rice was
produced by further milling the brown rice. Both types of rice were cooked in the same
steam box under the same conditions
Brown rice: from the same batch as the white rice as described above.
Description of dietary intervention: the cooked rice was packaged into 225 g servings
(equivalent to 100 g cooked rice) and provided to participants at designated university
campus cafeterias during the lunch hour from Monday to Fridays. Participants took
cooked rice home for dinner and meals on Saturdays. They were encouraged to eat ad
libitum and were permitted to consume other staple foods only on Sundays. They were
instructed to maintain their usual dietary pattern regarding other food selections
Incentives: not reported
Co-interventions in both groups: none
Assessment of dietary adherence: compliance was monitored by researchers weighing
leftovers in the cafeteria and was calculated as the frequency of consumption of the pre-
scribed type of rice divided by the frequency of consumption of total staple carbohydrates
throughout the intervention. Participants recorded the amount of rice they consumed at

0 +/- 17.1% in the white rice group and 88.7 +/- 23.3% in the brown rice group; P
for difference = 0.20. There was no difference in energy intake between groups over the
intervention period, but lower intake of carbohydrates (P = 0.03) and dairy products
in the brown rice group (P = 0.02). There was no difference in protein, fat, dietary
cholesterol, vegetables, fruits, red meat, poultry, or seafood. Dietary fibre was higher in
the brown rice group, as would be expected (P < 0.0001). (See Table 1.)

Notes
No between-group differences were found for any markers except serum LDL concen-
tration, which decreased more in the white rice group that in the brown rice group (P =
0.02). However, this effect was only observed among participants with diabetes (n = 47)
. Among participants with diabetes, a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure was
observed in the brown rice group than in the white rice group (P = 0.02)
Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Unclear risk
“randomly assigned (stratified by sex and
5y age category)”, but method of randomi-
sation not reported
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
Not reported
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
All researchers not directly in contact with
study participants (dietitians, laboratory
technicians,andstatisticians)were unaware
of group allocations. Not possible for par-
ticipants to be unaware of their group as-
signment due to differences in appearance
and texture of the brown and white rice
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
98/101 completers in brown rice group;
95/101completersinwhite rice group. The
6 withdrawals in the white rice group were
due to busy schedule (n = 4); loss of interest
(n = 1); or stroke unrelated to intervention.

(Continued)
The 3 withdrawals in the brown rice group
were due to a busy schedule or heart disease
unrelated to the intervention
Intention to treat analysis
Low risk
Intention-to-treat analysis done for all rel-
evant outcomes.
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Unclear risk
All outcomesof relevance tothisreviewthat
were reported at baseline were reported at
follow-up
Groups comparable at baseline
Unclear risk
Higher proportion of participants with di-
abetes (P = 0.03) and participants on anti-
hypertensive medication (P = 0.03) in the
white rice group at baseline
Other bias

No lipid or blood pressure outcomes. The primary outcomes of this study relate to insulin sensitivity.
As there is now a separate published review on whole grains and diabetes outcomes in which this study
was included (Priebe 2008), it has now been excluded from the present review, for which the main
outcomes relate to CVD and lipid and blood pressure outcomes
Pins 2002
Excluded due to a lack of clarity about the relative macronutrient content of the diets. There is a reference
to the macronutrient data in the paper (Table reference T2) to the journal website. However, the data
were not available there, so we attempted to contact the authors, but were unable to find up-to-date
contact details
In the original version of this review this study was included as it aimed for the same macronutrient
content in both arms. It was marked as awaiting further information. We have been unable to verify
the relative macronutrient of the diets (as above), so the study is now excluded

Participants
298 overweight participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus
Interventions
30-day centralised intervention, then participants returned home and and were asked to continue with their diet.
Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the following 4 groups
1. Usual care group (n = 60) received no dietary intervention.
2. The healthy diet group (n = 79) received a low-fat and high-fibre diet.
3. 50 grams oat group (n = 80) received healthy diet + same amount of cereals replaced by 50 grams of whole
grain (whole grain oats were continuously provided).
4. 100 grams oat group (n = 79) received healthy diet + same amount of cereals replaced by 100 grams of whole
grain (whole grain oats were continuously provided).

ing impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance or sen-
sitivity, glucose or insulin outcomes. We excluded studies
reporting only weight, body mass index, and other an-
thropometric outcomes if they did not also measure lipids
or blood pressure. We included studies in healthy par-
ticipants to capture both primary and secondary preven-
tion of cardiovascular disease. As more longer-term trials
are currently available, we have excluded very short-term
studies and included only those of at least 12 weeks’ dura-
tion. We specified an eligible participant age of inclusion
of 18 years or older (previously ≥ 16 years)

We expanded the inclusion criteria for this review to include the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Since
the last update of this review in 2007, a separate Cochrane Review has been published focusing on the effects of whole grain foods for
the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Priebe 2008). Hence, we excluded studies with diabetes as an outcome or changes in related
risk factors including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance or sensitivity, glucose or insulin outcomes. We excluded studies
reporting weight, body mass index, and other anthropometric outcomes if they did not also measure lipids or blood pressure. As more
trials are currently available, we have excluded short-term studies and included only those of at least 12 weeks’ duration. We specified
an eligible participant age of inclusion of 18 years or older (previously ≥ 16 years).
