BACKGROUND
The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is being evaluated in order to inform a 
decision regarding its inclusion in routine vaccination schedules.
METHODS
We conducted 7 years of follow-up in children who had been randomly assigned, 
at 5 to 17 months of age, to receive three doses of either the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine 
or a rabies (control) vaccine. The end point was clinical malaria (temperature of 
≥37.5°C and infection with Plasmodium falciparum of >2500 parasites per cubic mil-
limeter). In an analysis that was not prespecified, the malaria exposure of each 
child was estimated with the use of information on the prevalence of malaria 
among residents within a 1-km radius of the child’s home. Vaccine efficacy was 
defined as 1 minus the hazard ratio or the incidence-rate ratio, multiplied by 100, 
in the RTS,S/AS01 group versus the control group.
RESULTS
Over 7 years of follow-up, we identified 1002 episodes of clinical malaria among 
223 children randomly assigned to the RTS,S/AS01 group and 992 episodes among 
224 children randomly assigned to the control group. The vaccine efficacy, as as-
sessed by negative binomial regression, was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
−17.0 to 21.9; P 
= 
0.66) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 7.0% (95% CI, −14.5 
to 24.6; P 
= 
0.52) in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccine efficacy waned over time 
(P 
= 
0.006 for the interaction between vaccination and time), including negative 
efficacy during the fifth year among children with higher-than-average exposure 
to malaria parasites (intention-to-treat analysis: −43.5%; 95% CI, −100.3 to −2.8 
[P 
= 
0.03]; per-protocol analysis: −56.8%; 95% CI, −118.7 to −12.3 [P 
= 
0.008]).
CONCLUSIONS
A three-dose vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 was initially protective against clinical 
malaria, but this result was offset by rebound in later years in areas with higher-
than-average exposure to malaria parasites. (Funded by the PATH Malaria Vaccine 
Initiative and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00872963.)

R
TS,S/AS01 is a malaria vaccine candi-
date that has undergone phase 3 evalua-
tion across several sites in Africa that 
have varying intensities of malaria transmission. 
During more than 48 months of follow-up, im-
munization with the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine was 
estimated to be associated with rates of protec-
tion against clinical malaria of 36.3% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 31.8 to 40.5) among children 
5 to 17 months of age who had received a fourth 
dose and 28.3% (95% CI, 23.3 to 32.9) among 
those who had not received a fourth dose.1 The 
rates among young infants (6 to 12 weeks of age 
at the time of first vaccination) with more than 
38 months of follow-up were 25.9% (95% CI, 19.9 
to 31.5) among those who had received a fourth 
dose and 18.3% (95% CI, 11.7 to 24.4) among 
those who had not received a fourth dose.
The efficacy of vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 
wanes over time.2 The potential for rebound in 
malaria cases (also referred to as “age shift”) as 
immunity wanes may lessen the public health 
usefulness of malaria vaccines. We present data 
from 7 years of follow-up to assess the possibility 
of a rebound.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted this trial as part of a double-blind, 
randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial of the 
RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in children who were 5 to 17 
months of age at the time of the first vaccination 
and who lived in Kilifi, Kenya, or in Korogwe, 
Tanzania.3 The original two-site trial was initiat-
ed in March 2007 and was completed in August 
2008 in Korogwe and, after a site-specific exten-
sion, in November 2008 in Kilifi. Additional fol-
low-up was then conducted in Kilifi until April 
2011 (4-year efficacy results were published in 
2013).2 A further extension trial was conducted 
until November 2014, at which time follow-up was 
discontinued. The data reported here are from the 
Kilifi site only. The full details of the conduct of 
the trial are provided in the protocol (including 
the statistical analysis plan), available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The trial extension was designed by the aca-
demic authors, and employees of GlaxoSmith-
Kline Biologicals provided review of the protocol. 
Until November 1, 2008, the sponsorship, moni-
toring, and data management were the responsi-
bility of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals; after that 
date, these aspects of the trial were the respon-
sibility of the Kenya Medical Research Institute–
Wellcome Trust Research Programme. Data were 
gathered by the academic team, and the analysis 
was conducted by the first, second, and last au-
thors. The first draft of the manuscript was writ-
ten by the first author and revised by the last au-
thor, with comments from all the authors. Safety 
reporting to the regulatory authorities was under-
taken by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.
Participants
In early 2007, we recruited 447 healthy children 
who were 5 to 17 months of age. We conducted 
three extensions: from the end of 12 months of 
follow-up until November 2008, then until April 
2011, and then finally for an additional 3 years. 
Written informed consent for the extension was 
obtained from the parents or guardians of all 
the children with the use of approved consent 
forms provided in Swahili or Giriama. Nonliter-
ate parents indicated consent by using a thumb-
print, and a signature was obtained from an 
independent literate witness. The original trial 
and its extensions were approved by the Kenya 
Medical Research Institute National Ethics Com-
mittee, the Western Institutional Review Board, 
and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Com-
mittee. This article is published with the permis-
sion of the Director of Kenya Medical Research 
Institute.
Procedures
In the initial trial, three doses of the RTS,S/AS01 
vaccine or rabies (control) vaccine were adminis-
tered, at baseline and at 1 and 2 months. No 
vaccines were administered during the extended 
follow-up phase. Participants were followed up 
by means of both weekly active surveillance and 
passive surveillance to identify clinical malaria 
cases. We obtained blood samples for the as-
sessment of asymptomatic parasitemia at 8, 12, 
15, 25, 38, and 49 months (as reported previ-
ously2) and at 65, 78, and 91 months after vac-
cination. The participants and clinicians who 
were involved in the follow-up were unaware of 
the trial-group assignments. The principal inves-
tigators became aware of the trial-group assign-
ments after the end of the initial phase of the 
trial but did not take part in the clinical evalua-
tion of participants.

Seven-Year Efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine
Malaria-Parasite Exposure
Malaria transmission shows fine-scale geograph-
ic heterogeneity.4 We previously found that fine-
scale variations in exposure could be predicted 
by estimation of the prevalence of malaria infec-
tion among children who reside within a 1-km 
radius of each participant as an exposure index. 
Furthermore, the accuracy of this exposure in-
dex is refined by weighting according to the in-
verse of the distance between homes within the 
1-km radius and the index child. Hence, homes 
that are near to the index child contribute more 
important information than do those on the 
edge of the 1-km radius.5 In an analysis that was 
not prespecified, we used data from 870 children 
who were under active surveillance in the same 
trial area to determine exposure indexes and 
categorized the participants into low-exposure 
and high-exposure groups according to whether 
they were at or below the cohort mean or above 
the cohort mean, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was clinical malaria caused 
by Plasmodium falciparum (temperature of ≥37.5°C 
and P. falciparum parasitemia density of >2500 para-
sites per cubic millimeter). The intention-to-treat 
cohort included all the children who had under-
gone randomization. The per-protocol cohort in-
cluded children who received three doses of vac-
cine according to the trial protocol and for whom 
surveillance data were available at any time from 
2 weeks after receipt of the third dose. We cen-
sored data from children at 7 years of follow-up.
We used Cox proportional-hazard regression 
for analysis of the first malarial episode. Multiple 
episodes were analyzed by means of negative bi-
nomial regression and the Andersen–Gill exten-
sion of Cox regression, with clustering by partici-
pant. The first-episode analysis was used as the 
primary analysis after 8 months of follow-up,3 but 
longer-term follow-up showed lower efficacy when 
all episodes were considered.2 Vaccine efficacy 
was defined as 1 minus the hazard ratio or the 
incidence-rate ratio multiplied by 100 in the 
RTS,S/AS01 group versus the control group.
Adjustments were made for age, bed-net use, 
and malaria exposure. We plotted the incidence-
rate ratios over time by first aggregating the 
data into 4-month groups and then calculating 
the incidence rates in each trial group; we then 
divided the incidence in the RTS,S/AS01 group 
by the incidence in the control group. A quadratic 
equation was then fitted to these values.
As previously reported,1 we calculated the 
cases averted in each year of follow-up by sub-
tracting the measured incidence per person-year 
among participants in the RTS,S/AS01 group from 
the incidence per person-year among participants 
in the control group and then multiplying by 1000 
to express the result as the number of cases avert-
ed per 1000 children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01. 
We calculated cumulative cases by summing the 
cases averted up to and including each given 
year. We used bootstrapping methods to obtain 
95% confidence intervals by taking the 2.5th and 
97.5th percentiles of 1000 iterations. All the analy-
ses were performed with the use of Stata soft-
ware, version 13 (StataCorp).
Results
Trial Participants
Of the 447 children enrolled in the original trial, 
312 completed all three extensions of follow-up 
(164 participants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 
148 in the control group) (Fig. 1). We included 
all enrolled children in our analysis (i.e., 447 par-
ticipants in the intention-to-treat cohort and 415 
in the per-protocol cohort). All the participants 
who underwent randomization received at least 
one dose of vaccine. The characteristics of the 
RTS,S/AS01 group and the control group were 
similar at baseline (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Participants 
who were lost to follow-up were significantly 
less likely to have bed nets and more likely to 
live farther away from the dispensary than were 
other participants. In addition, a nonsignificantly 
greater number of participants in the control 
group than in the RTS,S/AS01 group were lost to 
follow-up, and participants who were lost to fol-
low-up had a nonsignificantly lower incidence of 
malaria (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy against First Episode
In the intention-to-treat cohort, there were 150 
cases of first episodes of clinical malaria among 
223 participants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 
157 cases among 224 participants in the control 
group. In a Cox regression analysis, after adjust-
ment for person-years of follow-up but no covari-
ates, the vaccine efficacy against the first episode 
of clinical malaria was 27.0% (95% CI, 8.5 to 41.8;

Seven-Year Efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine
P 
= 
0.006) (Table 1). Consistent results were seen 
in the per-protocol analysis.
Efficacy against All Episodes
In the intention-to-treat cohort, 1002 episodes of 
malaria occurred in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 
992 in the control group. The rate of loss to 
follow-up was higher in the control group than 
in the RTS,S/AS01 group, and after the inclusion 
of person-years of observation in the negative 
binomial model, the estimate of vaccine efficacy 
was 4.4% (95% CI, −17.0 to 21.9; P 
= 
0.66) (Ta-
ble 1). Similar results were seen in the per-pro-
tocol analysis.
Efficacy was consistently lower in the cohort 
with high exposure to malaria parasites than in 
the cohort with low exposure (Table 2). Efficacy 
against all episodes of clinical malaria was 16.6% 
(95% CI, −24.6 to 44.2) in the low-exposure co-
hort (P 
= 
0.38) and −2.4% (95% CI, −26.1 to 16.8) 
in the high-exposure cohort (P 
= 
0.82).
Waning in Vaccine Efficacy
There was a significant interaction between re-
ceipt of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and follow-up 
time in the adjusted negative binomial regression 
model (incidence-rate ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02 to 
1.14; P 
= 
0.006) and in the Andersen–Gill exten-
sion of the Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio, 
1.22; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.45; P 
= 
0.03). These inter-
action terms indicate that the efficacy of vacci-
nation changed significantly over time. This find-
ing can be quantified further by an examination 
of efficacy in individual years. In the intention-
to-treat analysis, vaccine efficacy declined from 
35.9% (95% CI, 8.1 to 55.3; P 
= 
0.02) in the first 
year to 3.6% (95% CI, −29.5 to 28.2; P 
= 
0.81) in 
the seventh year (Table 2 and Fig. 2). In year 5, 
negative efficacy was observed. This finding was 
of marginal significance overall (−34.4%; 95% CI, 
−83.9 to 1.8; P 
= 
0.06) in the per-protocol analy-
sis, but most of the negative efficacy was seen in 
the high-exposure cohort. At year 5, negative 
efficacy was not significant in the low-exposure 
cohort (−0.8%; 95% CI, −100.7 to 49.3; P 
= 
0.98) 
but was significant in the high-exposure cohort 
(−56.8%; 95% CI, −118.7 to −12.3, P 
= 
0.008).
Waning of vaccine efficacy was more rapid in 
the cohort with high exposure to malaria para-
sites than in the cohort with low exposure. A 
three-way interaction among vaccination, time, 
and malaria-parasite exposure resulted in an 
incidence-rate ratio of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.42; 
P 
= 
0.004) in the negative binomial analysis. This 
three-way interaction indicated significant varia-
tion in the rate of decline, with more rapidly 
declining efficacy observed with increasing ex-
posure index.
Estimated Cases of Malaria Averted
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the overall es-
timated number of clinical malaria cases averted 
over a period of 7 years was 317 cases (95% CI, 
−357 to 973) per 1000 children vaccinated with 
RTS,S/AS01, with wide confidence intervals that 
overlapped zero. In the low-exposure cohort, 
cases continued to be averted throughout the 
follow-up period, to a total of 718 cases (95% CI, 
4 to 1404) per 1000 participants in the RTS,S/AS01 
group. However, in the high-exposure cohort, 
there were negative cases averted in later years 
(i.e., there were more cumulative cases among 
participants in the RTS,S/AS01 group than among 
those in the control group), which more than 
offset the cases that were averted in earlier years, 
leading to −141 cases (95% CI, −1210 to 906) 
averted per 1000 participants (Fig. 3). The find-
ings regarding averted cases were based on inci-
dence rates rather than absolute numbers of cases 
per participant and hence were adjusted for per-
son-years at risk (Table 2).
Cross-Sectional Analysis
The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum para-
sitemia was lower in the RTS,S/AS01 group than 
in the control group at all cross-sectional sur-
veys before the fourth year. Thereafter, the preva-
lences were similar in the two groups (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
There were no significant differences between 
the RTS,S/AS01 group and the control group in 
Figure 1 (facing page). Randomization and Follow-up  
of Trial Participants.
We conducted three extensions: from the end of 12 
months of follow-up until November 2008, from then 
until April 2011, and finally for an additional 3 years. 
Other reasons for withdrawal included children miss-
ing vaccinations because of hospital admission (with 
contraindications to further vaccination), medical con-
ditions not permitted by the protocol, and incomplete 
documentation regarding concomitant vaccinations.

The control group received a rabies vaccine. All clinical malaria cases were detected by active case detection or passive case detection. Vaccine efficacy was defined as 1 minus the haz-
ard ratio or the incidence-rate ratio, then multiplied by 100. P values were calculated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model for first episodes and negative binomial regres-
sion for multiple episodes.

23.6] and 25.4% [95% CI, 19.9 to 31.7], respec-
tively) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). No cases of meningitis were reported. A 
total of 15 cases of severe malaria were identi-
fied during follow-up: 5 cases in the RTS,S/AS01 
group and 10 in the control group. In the control 
group, all the episodes of severe malaria occurred 
before 2.7 years of follow-up, whereas in the 
RTS,S/AS01 group, all the cases of severe malaria 
were observed after 2.7 years of follow-up (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). All cases of se-
vere malaria resolved without long-term sequelae.
Discussion
We found that RTS,S/AS01 provided protective ef-
ficacy in the first year after vaccination but that 
the efficacy subsequently waned. Efficacy was 
close to zero in the fourth year and may have 
been negative in the fifth year. The larger phase 
3 trial of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine showed efficacy 
estimates of 28.3% (95% CI, 23.3 to 32.9) against 
all malaria episodes over a median of 4 years of 
follow-up in the group that received three doses 
of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as compared with the 
control group.1 The data set from the phase 2 trial 
presented here includes fewer participants than the 
phase 3 trial did (447 vs. 8923 participants) with 
a longer duration of follow up (7 years vs. 4 years).
There was a trend toward negative efficacy in 
the fifth year in the whole cohort, with a sig-
nificant result in the subgroup of children who 
had a high malaria-exposure index, as compared 
with those with a low exposure index (Table 2). 
Only 312 of the 447 participants who underwent 
randomization completed follow-up, which may 
have introduced a risk of bias. There were indi-
cations that participants who were lost to follow-
up lived farther from the dispensary and were less 
likely to have bed nets than participants who 
completed the trial (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Participants who were lost to 
follow-up were also more likely to be in the con-
trol group and to have a lower risk of malaria 
episodes, but these findings were not signifi-
cant, which suggests a low risk of bias in the 
primary analysis.6 Furthermore, our analysis was 
exploratory among the two subgroup cohorts 
and hence is prone to type I error because of 
multiple comparisons. However, the negative ef-
ficacy during the fifth year fits an overall trend 
(Fig. 2B, bottom graph), and the variation in ef-
ficacy over time and according to malaria-parasite 
exposure is supported by a significant interaction 
between time and exposure in the determination 
of vaccine efficacy.
The summation of the described variation in 
efficacy over time since vaccination and accord-
ing to malaria exposure led to undetectable ef-
ficacy over a period of 7 years in the cohort we 
studied (i.e., the confidence intervals for the esti-
mates of efficacy and numbers of cases averted 
included zero). We note that the absolute num-
ber of malaria cases was in fact slightly higher 
in the RTS,S/AS01 group than in the control group 
(Table 1). The calculated vaccine efficacies and 
cases averted were marginally (and nonsignifi-
cantly) positive after correction for fewer person-
years of observation among persons who received 
the control vaccine than among those who re-
ceived RTS,S/AS01. The confidence intervals for 
cases averted are wide in our analysis. This un-
certainty reflects the limited sample size in our 
trial, combined with high frequencies of clinical 
episodes: any uncertainty in estimates of relative 
efficacy therefore translates to greater uncertain-
ty in the estimates of absolute numbers of cases 
averted.
We recorded a clinical malaria rate of 0.76 
cases per person-year of observation among par-
ticipants in the control group who were under 
conditions of active surveillance. In the phase 3 
trial, at the site where the highest transmission 
was recorded (Siaya in western Kenya), a clinical 
malaria rate of 3.31 cases per person-year was 
recorded under conditions of passive surveillance.7 
Therefore, our “higher-than-average transmission” 
cohort within the Junju geographic area in Kilifi 
may be equivalent to a moderate intensity of 
transmission in the wider African context,8 and 
hence our results may not be generalizable to 
areas with higher intensities of transmission.
The potential for malaria rebound has been 
suggested before as a possibility after pre-eryth-
rocytic vaccination9 and may also be a concern 
with regard to insecticide-treated bed nets in the 
context of insecticide resistance.10 Malaria rebound 
has been observed in randomized trials involving 
children after the withdrawal of weekly malaria 
chemoprophylaxis.11-13 In contrast, studies of in-
termittent preventive treatment with antimalarial 
agents have not shown a rebound.14,15

Vaccine efficacy against all episodes was estimated with the use of negative binominal regression. The intention-to-treat cohort included all the children who had undergone randomiza-
tion. The per-protocol cohort included children who received three doses of vaccine according to the trial protocol and for whom surveillance data were available from 2 weeks after re-
ceipt of the third dose. The cohort with a low malaria-parasite exposure index had a distance-weighted local prevalence of malaria that was at or below the cohort mean, and the cohort 
with a high exposure index had a prevalence that was above the cohort mean.

Seven-Year Efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine
Malaria rebound may occur because the 
RTS,S/AS01 vaccine protects against malaria 
sporozoites but does not induce clinical immu-
nity against blood-stage parasites. We and oth-
ers have previously found lower levels of anti-
bodies against blood-stage parasites in children 
who have been immunized with the RTS,S/AS01 
vaccine than in those given the control vaccine.9,16 
The reduced exposure to blood-stage parasites 
among persons who have received the RTS,S/AS01 
vaccine may lead to a slower acquisition of im-
munity to blood-stage parasites, leading to an in-
crease in episodes of clinical malaria in later life. 
This effect may be less marked in geographic 
regions where children are only occasionally 
exposed to parasites, in which immunity is more 
slowly acquired, and hence we did not see any 
evidence of rebound in our low-exposure cohort.
A large phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 showed 
an efficacy estimate of 28% against all malaria 
episodes over a median of 4 years of follow-up 
in the group that received three doses of the 
RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as compared with the con-
trol group.1 Efficacy against clinical malaria was 
Figure 2. Malaria Incidence and Vaccine Efficacy, According to Malaria Exposure and Trial Group in the Intention- 
to-Treat Cohort.
Panel A shows the incidence of malaria in the cohort with a low exposure index (distance-weighted local prevalence 
of malaria at or below the cohort mean), and Panel B the incidence in the cohort with a high exposure index (dis-
tance-weighted local prevalence of malaria above the cohort mean). The top graphs show the incidence of malaria 
in the RTS,S/AS01 group and the control group according to year of follow-up. The bottom graphs show the esti-
mates of vaccine efficacy, aggregated in 4-month windows, on the basis of the calculation of 1 minus the inci-
dence-rate ratio times 100, with the incidence-rate ratio calculated as the incidence of malaria in the RTS,S/AS01 
group divided by the incidence in the control group. The orange line indicates 0% efficacy, and the blue line indi-
cates smoothed estimates of efficacy over time. The dashed lines indicate 95% confidence intervals, and green 
dots point estimates of efficacy.

higher among children who received a fourth dose 
than among those who did not (36% vs. 28%).1 
Extended follow-up is currently being undertak-
en at three sites from the phase 3 trial and in-
cludes some participants who are receiving a 
fourth dose, which will provide further informa-
tion on outcomes in year 5 and beyond.
In conclusion, RTS,S/AS01 vaccination showed 
evidence of 35.9% efficacy in the first year after 
vaccination, but efficacy fell to 2.5% in the fourth 
year. The cohort with a high exposure index had 
a partial rebound in clinical malaria cases dur-
ing the fifth year. This result eroded the benefits 
that were seen in early years, such that over a 
period of 7 years, vaccine efficacy was estimated 
at 4.4%, a rate that was substantially lower than 
that seen over short-term follow up.3 In areas with 
a high intensity of malaria-parasite transmission, 
some of the early gains in averting the malaria 
burden can be lost in later years owing to a wan-
ing in vaccine efficacy. A larger phase 3 trial has 
been conducted across a range of transmission 
conditions and with additional vaccine doses. It 
will be essential to monitor efficacy in longer-term 
follow-up for year 5 and beyond to accurately 
measure the benefit and potential risk of vacci-
nation with the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine.
