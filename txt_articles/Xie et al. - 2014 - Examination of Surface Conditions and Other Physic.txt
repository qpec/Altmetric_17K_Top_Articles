ABSTRACT
Objectives The present work examined the
surface conditions and various other physical
properties of sterilised single-use stainless steel
acupuncture needles from two of the most
popular brands widely used in many countries.
Methods Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
images were taken for 10 randomly chosen
needles from each brand. Further SEM images
were taken after each of these needles
underwent a standard manipulation with an
acupuncture needling practice gel. A comparison
of forces and torques during the needling
process was also carried out.
Results The SEM images revealed significant
surface irregularities and inconsistencies at the
needle tips, especially for needles from one of
the two brands. Metallic lumps and small,
loosely attached pieces of material were
observed on the surfaces of some needles. Some
of the lumps and pieces of material seen on the
needle surfaces disappeared after the
acupuncture manipulation. If these needles had
been used on patients, the metallic lumps and
small pieces of material could have been
deposited in human tissues, which could have
caused adverse events such as dermatitis.
Malformed needle tips might also cause other
adverse effects including bleeding, haematoma/
bruising, or strong pain during needling. An
off-centre needle tip could result in the needle
altering its direction during insertion and
consequently failing to reach the intended
acupuncture point or damaging adjacent tissues.
Conclusions These findings highlight the need
for improved quality control of acupuncture
needles, with a view to further enhancing the
safety and comfort of acupuncture users.
INTRODUCTION
Acupuncture is a therapeutic modality
that involves inserting needles into certain
points of the human body. It has been
used in clinical practice for thousands of
years and is currently being practiced glo-
bally.1
2 In modern China, traditional
Chinese medicine including acupuncture
accounts for 40% of medical treatment,3
while in W
estern countries acupuncture is
one of the most frequently used comple-
mentary/alternative therapies.4–8
The use of acupuncture can perhaps be
traced as far back as the Stone Age
(around 3 million years ago) in ancient
China, using the Bian Shi (sharpened
stones) to stimulate certain points on a
patient’s
body
to
achieve
therapeutic
effects. The use of Bian Shi was followed
by fine needles made of other materials
such as bamboo, ceramic, bones, the
thorns of plants, the beaks of birds and
metals (including gold, silver, bronze and,
more,
recently
stainless
steel).1

Modern-style acupuncture related therap-
ies can be applied via a range of equip-
ment
including
needles,
acupressure
pellets and electrical or laser stimulation.
However, among all these forms of treat-
ment needling acupuncture involving skin
penetration is the most frequently used
method, in China and in other countries.
It is estimated that 1.4 billion acupuncture
needles are used each year worldwide.10
Acupuncture needles were originally
made for reuse multiple times, being steri-
lised after each usage.9 An outbreak of
hepatitis B in 1977 in the W
est Midlands,
UK11 raised concerns regarding the reuse
of acupuncture needles and consequently
single-use disposable acupuncture needles
were introduced. The original usage of
this type of needle was in Europe, fol-
lowed by Japan and Korea. Later, Chinese
manufacturers took up the challenge of

 cost reduction by combining automation with low
labour costs.9 Nowadays, China, Japan and Korea are
the main suppliers of acupuncture needles, with China
providing up to 90% of the world’s acupuncture
needles.12
The increasing use of acupuncture in recent decades
has drawn increased attention to the safety and quality
of this type of treatment. Although the adoption of
single-use disposable needles has reduced the risk of
human-to-human transmission of diseases in acupunc-
ture treatment, acupuncture use is not free of adverse
events. It was noted in a 2009 study that bleeding or
haematoma/bruising at needled points represented
58% of all reported adverse events caused by acupunc-
ture.13 Recent research on acupuncture has mainly
focused on the efficacy or mechanisms by conducting
clinical trials or in vivo/in vitro studies.14 There are
very few scientific studies on one of the most critical
components of acupuncture: the needle itself.9 15 16
A decade ago, Hayhoe et al carried out a pioneering
study using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to
examine tips of single-use disposable acupuncture
needles. He found significant faults in most of the
acupuncture needles.9 Since then, there has been no
further research in this important area. The present
study is aimed at investigating the surface conditions
and other physical properties of the current most
commonly used acupuncture needle brands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Prepacked, sterile, single-use, disposable acupuncture
needles from two of the most widely used commercial
brands, one from China (hereafter called H needles:
H1, H2, …, H10) and another from Japan (hereafter
called S needles: S1, S2, …, S10), were investigated
before and after needling. Due to commercial sensitiv-
ity, the identities of the manufactures are not disclosed
in this article. Both of these types of needle are made
of stainless steel, with the same nominal shaft diam-
eter and lengths of 0.25 and 30 mm, respectively. To
examine the surface conditions and the force charac-
teristics, 10 needles from each brand were indiscrim-
inately
selected
from
different
batches
of
the
commercial product. The use-by dates of the batches
were June 2014 for H needles and May 2014 for S
needles,
approximately
16 months
after
the
time
when all tests were completed (January 2013). To
simulate human tissue in acupuncture manipulation,
gel
pads
from
a
UNICO
Needling
Practice
Kit
(Kenshin Trading Corporation, Torrance, California,
USA) were used.
Evaluation of force amplitude and frequency in needling
To evaluate the force and torque histories during need-
ling, a needling sensor tool known as an Acusensor was
applied.17 The Acusensor consists of two individual
sensors: a needle motion sensor and a needle force
sensor. The motion sensor measures the two main
components of the needling manipulation: the longitu-
dinal displacement and the rotation. The force sensor
measures the axial force in the longitudinal direction
and the rotational ‘force’ (that is, ‘torque’) acting on
the needle.
Acupuncture manipulation tests were conducted at
RMIT University
, Melbourne, Australia. The Acusensor
device was used to record needling profiles produced by
a qualified acupuncturist with 20 years of experience in
clinical practice in acupuncture. The UNICO gel pad
was held between two layers of polymer foam materials.
Only the central part of the gel pad was used for need-
ling. T
o avoid any possible damage to needle tips, the
insertion tube of the Acusensor was not used and there-
fore the displacement and the rotation of the needle
were not recorded. In fact, the magnitudes of the needle
displacement and rotation are not important in the
present study
. The time histories of the axial force and
rotational torque were recorded using the Acusensor.
During the tests, the acupuncturist was not allowed to
see the real-time data, in order to avoid any bias of the
acupuncture manipulation.
SEM characterisation
To examine the surface conditions of the acupuncture
needles before and after needling, a ZEISS Supra 40
VP field emission SEM was used. Prior to the needling
tests, SEM images of the randomly selected needles
were taken to check the surface conditions of the
needle tips and shafts, with a view to identifying
defects such as scuffs, scratches, lumps and irregular-
ities. The needles were then used to conduct the need-
ling tests using UNICO gel pads as surrogates for
human tissue. Thereafter, further SEM images were
taken
to
investigate
whether
the
imperfections
remained on the needles and if any gel materials had
been taken out of the pads as a result of the needling.
An
energy
dispersive
spectroscopy
(EDS)
device,
which the SEM was equipped with, was used to iden-
tify the alloy compositions and alien materials found
on the needle surfaces.
For the SEM examination, the as-received needles
were unpacked and placed on a thin aluminium plate
with their handles fixed by conducting resin. They
were then sealed in the vacuum chamber of the SEM
device. To assist in identifying the correct angles for
observation after needling, the handles were marked
with red dots in a certain direction. After the needling
tests, these needles were carefully rearranged so as to
locate the exact same observation angles to give the
same photographing windows.
Further, in order to check the firmness of the lumps
or other alien materials attached to the needle sur-
faces, several other randomly selected needles from
each brand were cleaned in an ultrasonic washing
machine for 1 min. Then, the needles were examined
using the SEM. For H needles, these specimens were

 designated as H11, H21, …, H101, and for S
needles, S11, S21, …, S101.
RESULTS
SEM observation of as-received needles
The SEM images of the randomly selected as-received
H and S needles are shown in figures 1 and 2, respect-
ively. A significant difference between the two types
of needle was observed. For H needles, only one
needle (H8) exhibited a relatively smooth and sharp
end, and the best magnification for the SEM observa-
tions was 5000×. However, almost all examined S
needles had relatively smooth tip shapes. Online sup-
plementary figures S1 and S2 show the SEM images
of the shafts of these two types of needle, with a mag-
nification of 400×.
For H needles, typical characteristics of the needle
tips included: (i) scratches, (ii) blunt ends, (iii) mal-
formed
ends
and
(iv)
lumps
and
irregularities.
Generally, the needle tips had several types of imper-
fections combined. The shafts of H needles were rela-
tively smooth, particularly that of needle H3. Minute
scratches and lumps were observed on the surfaces of
the other three needles examined.
In contrast, S needles generally exhibited fairly con-
sistent and smooth tips, where the scratches were pat-
terned, mostly along the longitudinal direction. Few
lumps (S3, S8 and S9) or attachments (S5 and S6)
could be observed. The shafts of the S needles were
almost perfectly smooth, with few scratches on the
surfaces.
Interestingly,
a
circle
of
approximately
0.032 mm in diameter was found on the shaft surface

 of needle S2 (see online supplementary figure S2),
which was possibly due to the detachment of a lump
in the polishing process during manufacture.
W
e also investigated the chemical compositions of the
needles and the UNICO gel by scanning selected points
on the surfaces using the SEM, which was equipped
with an EDS device. For H needles, the representative
composition (by weight) was 2.10% C, 0.96% O,
0.41% Si, 17.97% Cr, 66.46% Fe and 12.09% Ni,
while for S needles it was 2.73% C, 0.62% Si, 21.34%
Cr, 65% Fe and 10.3% Ni. The composition of the gel
was 97.92% C, 1.90% O and 0.18% Si. It is of note
that the chemical compositions of the two types of
needle were quite similar, even though they were manu-
factured in two different countries.
According to measurements from the SEM images,
the actual diameters of the two types of needle were
almost identical: the average shaft diameter was
0.256 mm for H needles and 0.254 mm for S needles
(against the nominal diameter of 0.25 mm for both
types of needle).
Surface conditions of needles after acupuncture
manipulation
To investigate changes at the needle tip before and
after an acupuncture manipulation,
some of the
needles were selected to be tested (for example, those
with lumps on the surface, or with very unusual ends
such as needle H3). When taking SEM images, these
needles were carefully positioned in order to obtain
the same region for photographing before and after
needling, so that changes in surface conditions could
be observed clearly.

 As shown in the left-hand panels of figures 3 and 4,
lumps and irregularities at the needle tips were
attached to the surface relatively firmly; most of them
were not detached even after ultrasonic cleaning
(H91, H101, S31 and S81). It was only found with
needle S31 that one of the two major lumps disap-
peared after ultrasonic cleaning.
As seen in figures 3 and 4, after acupuncture manipu-
lation some of the foreign material previously attached
to the needles had been wiped off. At the same time,
some gel became attached to the needle surfaces. For H
needles, most of the lumps and irregularities disap-
peared. Specifically
, only a small part of the unusual end
of needle H3 remained and the rest was torn off during
needling. Furthermore, a trace of twist at the slender tip
of H3 was observed, which could be caused by the rota-
tional manipulation in needling. For needle H91, after
ultrasonic cleaning for 3 min, the attached irregularities
still remained. However, some of these irregularities dis-
appeared after needling. For needle H101, the large
non-metallic lump, which remained after ultrasonic
cleaning,
was
eliminated
with
little
residue
left.
Interestingly
, no obvious gel material was observed in
the SEM images of H needles after needling.
After acupuncture manipulation, the surface condi-
tions of S needles were slightly different from those of
H needles. As shown in figure 4, although the tips of S
needles were much smoother, gel was found to be
attached to the surface of these needles after needling
too. The three tested needles, S6, S8 and S31, were all
found to have gel on the needle surface. An EDS spec-
trum showed the chemical compositions of the attach-
ments were 40.36% C, 14.60% O, 4.18% Si, 8.33% Cr,
30.00% Fe and 2.53% Ni, and 23.14% C, 11.15% O,
4.56% Si, 12.39% Cr, 46.34% Fe and 2.42% Ni for
needles S6 and S8, respectively, where C, O and Si were

 from the composition of the gel, and Cr, Fe and Ni
were from the needle matrix. Additionally, some lumps
and irregularities were wiped off the needle during
needling (for example, needles S31 and S81), similar to
the results seen with the H needles.
Although figure 2 shows that the S needles also had
some defects, all 10 randomly selected needles exhibited
an identical cone shape at the tip. In stark contrast, each
of the 10 randomly selected H needles had its own
poorly formed irregular shape (except for H8).

 supplementary figures S3 and S4, respectively. It can
be seen that the force frequency and the torque fre-
quency were synchronised in every single test for H
and S needles. Further, figure 5A demonstrates a
perfect linear relation between the torque frequency
and the force frequency with the slope being equal to
1. In the manipulation, when the longitudinal (up and
down) movement increased in frequency, the rota-
tional movement increased accordingly in a linear
relationship. This relationship is, in fact, related to the
needing technique of the acupuncturist and independ-
ent of the needle type. Figure 5B clearly shows that,
overall, H needles had significantly higher force
amplitudes than S needles at the same frequency
levels. Figure 5C shows that torque amplitudes (for
rotational movements) of the two types of needle
were scattered in a range from 45 to 120 mN, and no
clear trend could be identified.
Although there was an unusually large attachment
to needle H3, the force amplitude of this needle was
not the highest. Instead, H101, which had the biggest
cone at the tip, resulted in the largest force amplitude
but,
interestingly,
the
smallest
torque
amplitude.
Needle H91 had a moderate size tip cone and a force
amplitude between those of the other two H needles.
In contrast, S needles had similar tip sizes and the
force amplitudes fluctuated randomly in a relatively
small range from 1000 to 1100 mN. Needle S6, with
one side of the tip flattened, had a relatively higher
force amplitude. Needle S31 had the smallest force
amplitude, although its tip was accidentally blunted
during the ultrasonic cleaning process.
Another phenomenon was observed regarding the
relationship between frequency and force/torque amp-
litude. For S needles, with increased frequency in lon-
gitudinal movement, the longitudinal force generally
increases. In contrast, with increased frequency in
rotational movement, the rotational torque amplitude
generally deceases. However, no clear trends were
observed in H needles, possibly due to significant var-
iations of the surface conditions of these needles.
DISCUSSION
The first disposable acupuncture needles were intro-
duced in the late 1970s.9 After more than three
decades of developments in regulatory standards and
manufacturing techniques, it would be reasonable for
acupuncturists and patients to expect high quality in
such a widely used clinical device. The findings from
this study were of concern, as acupuncture needles
from even most highly regarded manufacturers exhib-
ited significant irregularities and inconsistencies.

 Prior to the adoption of single-use disposal needles,
the most commonly reported acupuncture adverse
effects were infections, including hepatitis,18 due to
lack
of
rigorous
sterilisation.9
For
example,
acupuncture-associated hepatitis B outbreaks were
reported in UK,11 19 Jerusalem20 and USA21 between
1970 and 1990. Although there was no such report in
China,22
23 considering the fact that China had a
moderate-to-high risk of hepatitis B infection com-
pared to many W
estern countries,24 the real situation
might be similar in China.23 Along with the use of
single-use disposal needles, infection is no longer the
major concern with regard to acupuncture. A number
of large surveys on the safety of acupuncture were con-
ducted recently, mainly in Europe. All these surveys
reported a low risk of adverse events in acupunc-
ture.13
25–29 Although the rates of adverse events
reported by either practitioners or patients are consid-
ered low, it is worth noting that among all reported
adverse events, some local reactions such as bleeding
or
haematoma/bruising
were
the
most
common
events.13 26 28 Strong needle pain was also reported in
all the above surveys.
In addition, earlier reports of skin reactions to acu-
puncture due to the presence of chromium or nickel
in the needles exist.30–32 Although the needles used in
previous studies were quite different from those used
in the present study, the EDS spectra of the H and S
needles showed that the needle surfaces contained sig-
nificant proportions of chromium and nickel (18% Cr
and 12% Ni for H needles, and 21% Cr and 10% Ni
for S needles). The small metallic pieces loosely
attached to the needle surfaces were mainly composed
of
iron,
chromium
and
nickel.
As
observed
in
the present study, some of the metallic lumps and
pieces on the needle surfaces disappeared after the
acupuncture manipulation. If the needles had been
used on patients, these materials could have been
deposited in human tissues, which might have caused
adverse events such as dermatitis. A more recent
review of acupuncture studies published between
1987 and 1999 also revealed that contact dermatitis
in needled areas had been reported,33 indicating that
single-use disposal needles might also cause such
adverse effects.
The small metallic pieces found on the needle sur-
faces were mostly likely from the grinding and polish-
ing processes during the manufacture of the needles.
The grinding and polishing processes would also gen-
erate electrostatic forces that would attract tiny metal
filings to the needle surfaces. However, these metallic
pieces should have been removed from the needles if
adequate cleansing processes were carried out.
The commonly seen bleeding or haematoma/bruis-
ing was possibly caused by unsmooth needle tips
breaking small blood vessels during needle insertion.
Highly malformed tips were found in several H
needles. This could be the reason for the occasional
unexplained strong pain in the needling area reported
by some patients during acupuncture.9 An off-centre
(eg, H10) or an unsymmetrical (eg, H3) needle tip
may also cause the needle to alter direction during
insertion.9 If the flaws at the needle tip are eliminated
through adequate quality control of the needle manu-
facturing process, such acupuncture needling asso-
ciated adverse effects may well be reduced.
It is worth noting that the 2007 National Institutes of
Health Consensus Statement stated that ‘One of the
advantages of acupuncture is that the incidence of
adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many
drugs or other accepted procedures of the same condi-
tions’.29 However, fear of needling pain is a major issue
preventing people from seeking acupuncture treat-
ment.34 35 If this fear can be reduced by improving the
quality of the needle tip, acupuncture treatment may be
accepted more widely in clinical practice.
While it was observed that the force amplitudes of
H needles during the needling process were generally
higher than those of S needles, no clear correlation
was found between the surface roughness/imperfec-
tion of individual needles and the corresponding
force/torque amplitudes. Further research is needed in
order to determine the relationship between the
needle surface conditions and the force/torque magni-
tudes of acupuncture manipulation.
CONCLUSIONS
This research performed a systematic study of surface
conditions of acupuncture needles from two of the
most popular brands widely used in many countries.
Based upon the results, the following conclusions can
be drawn:
1. Acupuncture needle manufacturers, including the well
established
ones,
should
review and
improve
their
quality control procedures for fabrication of needles. In
particular, needle tips should be properly formed, shar-
pened and cleansed.
2. Significant surface irregularities and inconsistencies at
needle tips, especially with the H needles, were found.
These defects might cause adverse effects in needled
areas, such as bleeding, haematoma/bruising, strong pain
or dermatitis.
3. These findings highlight the need to improve the quality
control of acupuncture needles, with a view to further
enhancing the safety and comfort of acupuncture users.
