 Importance—Prostate cancer treatments are associated with side effects. Understanding the side 
effects of contemporary approaches to management of localized prostate could inform shared 
decision-making.
Objective—To compare the harms of radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation (EBRT) and active 
surveillance (AS).
Design—The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study is 
a prospective, population-based, cohort study of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 
2011–2012. This study reports follow up through August 2015.
Setting—Patients accrued from five Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results registry sites 
and the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor.
Participants—Men < 80 years old with clinical stage cT1-2 disease, prostate specific antigen < 
50 ng/mL, enrolled within six months of diagnosis, who completed a baseline survey and at least 1 
follow-up survey.
Exposure—Treatment with RP, EBRT or AS was ascertained within one year of diagnosis.
Main Outcome and Measures—Patient-reported function in sexual, urinary incontinence, 
urinary irritative, bowel, and hormonal domains on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index 
Composite (EPIC) 36 months after enrollment. Domain scores range from 0–100. Higher score 
indicates better function. Minimum clinically important difference defined as 10–12, 6, 5, 5, and 4, 
respectively.
Results—The cohort included 2550 men (mean age 63.8 years, 74% white, 55% intermediate or 
high risk), of whom 1523 (59.7%) underwent RP, 598 (23.5%) EBRT, and 429 (16.8%) AS. Men 
undergoing EBRT were older (mean age 68.1 vs. 61.5, p<0.001), and had worse baseline sexual 
function (mean EPIC domain score 52.3 vs. 65.2, p<0.001) than men undergoing RP. At 3 years, 
adjusted mean sexual domain score for men undergoing RP had declined more than for men 
undergoing EBRT (mean difference −11.9 points, 95% CI [−15.1, −8.7]). The difference in decline 
in sexual domain scores between EBRT and AS was not clinically significant (−4.3 points, 95% CI 
[−9.2, 0.7]). RP was associated with worse urinary incontinence than EBRT (−18.0 points, 95% CI 
[−20.5, −15.4]) or AS (−12.7 points, 95% CI [−16.0, −9.3]) and better urinary irritative symptoms 
compared to AS (5.2 points, 95% CI [3.2, 7.2]). No clinically significant differences for bowel or 
hormone function were noted beyond 12 months. No differences in global quality of life or 
disease-specific survival (3 deaths) were noted (99.7–100%).
Conclusion and Relevance—In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, RP was 
associated with a larger decline in sexual function and urinary incontinence than EBRT or AS after 
3 years, and lesser urinary irritative symptoms compared to AS; however, there were no 
meaningful differences in bowel or hormonal function beyond 12 months and no meaningful 
differences in global quality of life measures. These findings may facilitate counseling regarding 
the comparative harms of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer.
Introduction
The optimal management for localized prostate cancer depends on factors including risk of 
progression, competing risks of mortality, baseline urinary, sexual and bowel function, and

 patient preferences.1 Comparing the effectiveness and harms of radiation therapy (RT), 
surgery (RP) and active surveillance (AS) is critical for shared decision making.2 Yet 
comparative data have limited generalizability for several reasons, such as focusing on 
homogenous populations and comparing older treatments instead of contemporary robotic 
RP and intensity modulated RT (IMRT).3–12
In this context, the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation 
(CEASAR) study, a prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort study was developed.
13 In light of the nearly 100% 5-year survival for men with localized prostate cancer, patient-
reported disease-specific functional outcomes were selected as the primary short and 
intermediate-term outcome measures. This study assessed patient-reported functional 
outcomes at 3 years after treatment.
Methods
The parent study accrued men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 2011–12 from 5 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries (Atlanta, Los Angeles, 
Louisiana, New Jersey and Utah), and the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic 
Research Endeavor registry. Details of the protocol have been published.13 Eligibility 
criteria were age < 80 years, PSA < 50 ng/mL, clinical stage T1-T2, no nodal involvement or 
metastases on clinical evaluation, enrolled within 6 months of diagnosis.
Patient-reported outcomes, were collected via survey at enrollment, and 6, 12, and 36 
months after enrollment. A medical chart review, including clinical and treatment 
information, was obtained at 12 months. SEER registry data were linked to the dataset. This 
study includes follow-up through August 2015. IRB approval was obtained from each site 
and Vanderbilt. Patients provided informed consent.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measures were 36-month domain scores on the 26-item Expanded 
Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), a validated instrument for measuring disease-
specific function in sexual, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative, bowel and hormonal 
domains after treatment for prostate cancer.14 Domain scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher score representing better function. The minimally important difference (MID), 
representing the magnitude of change that is clinically meaningful to patients, has been 
estimated for each EPIC domain using standard techniques; the distribution-based approach 
estimated MID as 1/3-1/2 of a standard deviation and the anchoring approach identified the 
magnitude of change on each EPIC domain that resulted in a change in satisfaction with 
treatment.15 Both techniques yielded similar MIDs, and were consistent with the a priori 
definition of MID used in the power calculation of the original grant application for this 
study (½ of a standard deviation.) The sexual function domain focuses on the quality and 
frequency of erections (MID 10–12 points). The urinary incontinence (MID 6 points) and 
urinary irritative (MID 5 points) domains ask questions about frequency and amount of 
urinary leakage, and symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, and urinary frequency. The 
bowel function domain (MID 4 points) focuses on bowel frequency, urgency, bleeding and 
pain. The hormonal domain (MID 4 points) assesses symptoms such as hot flashes,

 gynecomastia, low energy and weight change. Baseline survey instructions were to respond 
with pre-treatment function in mind. Previous studies have investigated the issue of recall 
bias for the EPIC, including a study in this cohort, and adjusted differences in domain scores 
between those who complete the survey before treatment and those who complete it 
afterward range from 1.0 to 3.7 points, well below the MID for each domain.16
Individual items from the EPIC-26 were selected a priori as secondary outcomes based on 
clinical relevance by content experts and patients on the study team.
Treatments were also compared with respect to global quality of life, using selected domains 
from the commonly used Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36): physical 
functioning, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue.17,18 Domain scores are scaled from 0 
to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. MIDs for these domains have been 
estimated for the localized prostate cancer population as 7, 6, and 9 points respectively.19
Exposure
The main exposure was initial treatment (RP, EBRT, or AS), defined according to the 
following hierarchy of sources: medical chart abstraction, patient report, SEER registry. A 
participant was categorized as AS if there was documentation of AS in absence of treatment, 
or if there was no treatment administered within one year of diagnosis. Distinguishing 
between watchful waiting, AS, and treatment delay was not possible, and these patients were 
categorized as AS recognizing that it was a heterogeneous group. For analysis, time zero for 
treated patients was the date of treatment, while for AS patients it was the date of diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared across treatments using Kruskal-Wallis tests for 
continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables.
To describe typical trajectories of function over time, longitudinal regression models were fit 
to predict EPIC domain scores as a function of treatment, time since treatment, and their 
interaction. For each domain, a single model was fit incorporating domain scores from all 
time points. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an independent weight 
matrix because of the correlation between observations on the same patients. Modeling time 
using regression splines allowed for a flexible relationship between function and time. 
Variability in the interval between treatment and survey completion allowed for estimation 
of domain scores between rounds of data collection, and beyond 36 months.
Recognizing that outcomes (and patients’ priorities) may differ by baseline function, these 
models were repeated, stratifying by baseline domain scores (excellent and less than 
excellent). Since excellent function has not been defined in the literature based on EPIC 
domain scores, a cutoff baseline score was selected for each domain that approximated the 
highest quartile of domain scores, an approach that has been used in prior publications on 
patient-reported outcomes after prostate cancer treatment.20
To measure the association between treatment choice and domain score over time, a similar 
set of models was fit that adjusted for age, race, comorbidity,21 prostate cancer risk stratum,

 22 physical function,17,18,23 social support,24 depression,25 medical decision-making style,26 
site, and baseline EPIC domain score. This multivariable modeling approach was designed 
to minimize bias associated with known differences in baseline characteristics that are 
associated with functional outcomes (i.e., confounding). Multiple imputation was used for 
missing covariates (see eMethods). Since androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard 
component of RT for high-risk disease and an option in intermediate-risk disease, ADT was 
not controlled for in the models.27 Instead, exploratory models were fit for sexual and 
hormonal function with 5 treatment groups: nerve-sparing RP, non-nerve-sparing RP, EBRT 
without ADT, EBRT with ADT, and AS. Unadjusted and adjusted longitudinal regression 
models using GEE were fit for responses to individual EPIC items and for the three SF-36 
domains, using the same covariates as above. In the SF-36 regression models, the baseline 
SF-36 domain score was added as an independent variable.
Probability of overall and disease-specific survival was estimated by treatment using the 
Kaplan-Meier with log-rank tests.
Differences in domain scores between treatments were statistically significant if the two-
tailed p-value was < 0.05 and were interpreted as clinically meaningful if the differences 
were as large as the MID. R version 3.2.2 was used for all analyses.
Results
The parent study accrued 3,709 men, of whom 440 patients were excluded for failing to 
meet basic inclusion criteria. An additional 519 men were excluded from the current study 
for receiving a treatment other than RP, EBRT, or AS, leaving 2,750 patients for 
consideration (eFigure 1). The analytic cohort contained the 2,550 men (93%) who 
completed a baseline survey and at least one survey thereafter. Approximately 93% of 
surveys were completed on paper, while 7% were completed by phone; 98% of surveys were 
conducted in English and 2% in Spanish; 54% of baseline surveys were collected prior to 
initial treatment. Survey response rates were 89% at 6 months, 86% at 12 months, and 78% 
at 36 months (eFigure 1, eTable 1).
Among men in the analytic cohort, 1,523 (59.7%) underwent RP, 598 (23.5%) EBRT and 
429 (16.8%) AS. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Briefly, 26% of the cohort 
was non-white. EBRT patients were older, had higher comorbidity burden, and had higher-
risk disease features compared to RP patients. Seventy-seven percent of AS patients were 
low-risk. Among RP patients with complete reporting of nerve-sparing status (71%, 
1082/1523), 79% (859/1082) had bilateral nerve-sparing and among those with complete 
reporting of surgical approach (85%, 1302/1523), 77% (1002/1302) had robotic surgery. 
Among EBRT patients with complete records of EBRT type (78%, 467/598), 81% (378/467) 
had IMRT and among those with complete reporting of ADT use (99%, 593/598), 45% 
(265/593) of EBRT patients had ADT within the first year. By the 3-year survey, 24.2% of 
AS patients had undergone treatment, and 90.2% of the remainder had had a PSA checked 
within the past 12 months.

 For the stratified analyses, excellent baseline EPIC domain scores were defined as ≥ 90 for 
the sexual function domain (26.4% of men); 100 for the urinary incontinence domain 
(60.3%); 100 for the urinary irritative domain (26.1%); 100 for the bowel domain (61.7%); 
and 100 for the hormonal domain (39.1%).
Sexual Function
Men undergoing RP had higher baseline sexual domain scores than men undergoing EBRT, 
and comparable scores to those on AS (eTable 2). RP and EBRT were associated with 
declines in sexual function scores, but the decline was greater for RP patients, resulting in 
similar average unadjusted domain score for RP and EBRT at 3 years (Figure 1A–C). The 
difference in functional decline between RP and EBRT was greater for the 26.4% of men 
with excellent baseline function (baseline sexual domain score ≥ 90), while the 73.6% of 
men with lower baseline function (baseline domain score < 90) had poor sexual function 
outcomes regardless of whether they underwent RP or EBRT. AS was associated with 
preservation of function, with mild decline over time.
When controlling for baseline domain scores and other covariates (eTable 2, Figure 1D), 
men undergoing RP had a larger decline in sexual domain score compared with EBRT 
(adjusted mean domain score difference at 3 years: −11.9 points, 95% CI −15.1, −8.7) or AS 
(−16.2 [−20.6, −11.7]), relative to the MID of 10–12. Adjusted domain score after EBRT 
was significantly worse than AS at 12 months (−10.5, [−14.0, −6.9]), but the magnitude of 
difference at 3 years was no longer significant (−4.3, [−9.2, 0.7]). Treatment, baseline 
domain score and time since treatment were the only variables for which the magnitude of 
association with 3-year domain score exceeded the MID.
On exploratory analysis with a 5-tier treatment variable (nerve-sparing RP, non-nerve 
sparing RP, EBRT alone, EBRT + ADT, and AS), the difference between EBRT alone and 
AS was not statistically significant (−3.0 points, p = 0.27), and the difference between RP 
and EBRT + ADT was attenuated (−8.2 points [−13.2, −3.2]), below the MID (eFigure 2).
More men who underwent RP were bothered by sexual dysfunction 3 years after diagnosis 
(44% vs. 35% for EBRT and 28% for AS, p<0.001 on multivariable analysis; Figure 1E, 
eTable 2). Erection insufficient for intercourse was common at 3 years (70% for RP, 71% for 
EBRT, and 51% for AS on raw percentages [Figure 1F]), but, controlling for baseline sexual 
function and other factors, odds were significantly higher for RP vs. AS (OR 3.4, 95% CI 
[2.5, 4.6]) and RP vs. EBRT (2.1, 95% CI [1.5, 2.9]). Among men who had sufficient 
erections at baseline, erection sufficient for intercourse at 3 years was reported in 43% (95% 
CI: 40, 47) for RP, 53% (45, 60) for EBRT and 75% (68, 80) for AS in raw percentages. An 
exploratory multivariable model, using 5 treatment groups, yielded similar results (eTable 3).
Urinary Incontinence
Baseline urinary incontinence domain scores were similar across groups (eTable 4). 
However, RP was associated with a significant decline in urinary incontinence score after 
treatment, particularly in the 60.3% of men with perfect urinary incontinence domain scores 
at baseline (Figure 2A–C). There was no significant change in urinary incontinence score for 
men who had EBRT or AS, regardless of baseline score.

 Despite some improvement in incontinence domain scores 12 months after RP, adjusted 
incontinence scores were still significantly worse for RP compared with AS (−12.7 points 
[−16.0, −9.3]) and EBRT (−18.0 points [−20.5, −15.4]) at 3 years, differences greater than 
the MID (6 points) (Figure 2D, eTable 4). By contrast, urinary incontinence was not 
significantly different between EBRT and AS. Treatment, baseline domain score and time 
since treatment were the only variables for which the magnitude of association with the 3-
year domain score exceeded the MID.
Reports of moderate or big problem with urinary leakage were more common after RP vs. 
AS (14% vs. 6%, OR 2.9 [1.8, 4.7]) and RP vs. EBRT (14% vs. 5%, OR 4.5 [2.7, 7.3]) 
(Figure 2E, eTable 4). Urinary function bother scores were not significantly different for RP 
vs. AS and EBRT vs. AS at 3 years, but were higher for RP vs. EBRT (12% vs. 10%, OR 1.7 
[1.1, 2.5]) (Figure 2F, eTable 4).
Urinary Irritative
Baseline scores were similar across groups (eTable 4). Scores improved for RP patients, 
particularly in the 73.9% of men whose baseline score was below 100 (Figure 3A–C). Those 
undergoing EBRT or AS experienced little or no change in irritative urinary symptoms.
Adjusted urinary irritative function scores were slightly better for men undergoing RP 
compared to AS at 1 year (4.5 points [3.0, 6.0]) and 3 years (5.2 points [3.2, 7.2]), at the 
threshold of clinical significance (eTable 4). Other comparisons across treatments, while 
statistically significant, were below the MID of 5 (Figure 3D, eTable 4). Besides treatment 
with RP, the only other factors for which the magnitude of association with 3-year domain 
score exceeded the MID were baseline domain score and time since treatment.
Reports of moderate or big problems with burning with urination were uncommon (2% in 
each group [Figure 3E, eTable 4]). Reports of moderate or big problem with frequent 
urination were lower for RP vs. AS (13% vs. 18%, OR 0.6 [0.4, 0.8]) and for EBRT vs. AS 
(15% vs. 18%, OR 0.6 [0.4, 0.8]) at 3 years, but not significantly different between RP and 
EBRT (Figure 3F, eTable 4).
Bowel Function
Decline in bowel domain score was not common (Figure 4A–C, eTable 5). Six months after 
treatment, domain scores were higher in men who underwent RP vs. EBRT (4.6 points [3.2, 
6.1]) and lower for EBRT vs. AS (−5.8 points [−10.3, −1.2]). However, by 12 months these 
differences were near the MID of 4 and by 36 months, they were smaller. Unadjusted and 
adjusted results were similar. No other independent variables had a magnitude of association 
with 3-year domain score that met the threshold for clinical significance.
The frequency of ‘moderate or big problem’ with bowel bother, bloody stools, or bowel 
urgency was 1–8% across all treatments at 3 years (Figure 4E–F, eTable 5). Nonetheless, the 
odds of bowel urgency at 3 years were lower for RP than EBRT (3% vs. 7%, OR 0.3 [0.2, 
0.6]) and RP vs. AS (3% vs. 5%, OR 0.5 [0.3, 0.9]).

 Hormone Function
Hormone domain scores were worse for EBRT compared to AS and RP at 6 months (RP vs. 
EBRT: 5.0 points [3.3, 6.6]; EBRT vs. AS: −6.5 points [−11.1, −1.9]), but these differences 
no longer significant at 3 years on unadjusted or adjusted analyses (Figure 5, eTable 6). No 
other independent variables had a magnitude of association with 3-year domain score that 
reached the MID.
In the exploratory models that separated EBRT into with and without ADT, the only group 
with decrements in hormone function was the EBRT + ADT group, and these associations 
were limited to the first year (eFigure 2).
Quality of life
Baseline Physical Functioning and Energy/Fatigue scores on the SF-36 were lower for men 
undergoing EBRT compared to RP or AS (Figure 6, eTable 7). None of the treatment groups 
experienced a clinically significant decline in Physical Functioning, Emotional Well-Being, 
or Energy/Fatigue scores. On multivariable analysis, associations between treatment and 3-
year SF-36 quality of life domain scores were below the threshold for clinical significance, 
as were associations baseline EPIC sexual and urinary incontinence domain scores and 3-
year SF-36 domain scores.
Survival
Median follow up time among censored patients was 40 months (Q1, Q3: 38, 45). There 
were 78 deaths, including 3 prostate cancer deaths. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, estimated 3-
year disease-specific survival was not significantly different across groups (99.7–100%). 
Unadjusted 3-year overall survival was higher for RP (99% [98, 99]) compared to other 
groups (EBRT: 96% [94, 98]; AS: 97% [95, 99], p<0.001), commensurate with the younger 
age and lower comorbidity of men undergoing RP (eTable 9).
Discussion
In this study of men with localized prostate cancer, RP was associated with clinically 
significant declines in sexual function compared to EBRT and AS, particularly in men with 
excellent function at baseline. Urinary incontinence scores also declined significantly after 
surgery compared to EBRT and AS, with 14% of RP patients reporting a moderate or big 
problem with urinary leakage at 3 years, compared to 5% with EBRT and 6% with AS. RP 
was associated with better irritative voiding symptoms than AS, with a difference that met 
the threshold for clinical significance. Mean scores in bowel and hormonal domains were 
significantly worse for EBRT vs. RP and AS at 6 months, but the differences were below 
threshold for clinical significance by 3 years. Treatment, baseline domain scores and time 
since treatment were the independent variables with clinically significant associations with 
3-year domain scores. None of the treatment groups experienced clinically significant 
declines in global quality of life domain scores. This information may facilitate patient 
counseling regarding the expected harms of contemporary treatments, and their possible 
impact on quality of life.

 Prior studies have quantified the harms of prostate cancer treatment. However, randomized 
trials in localized prostate cancer have been difficult to execute, and those that have been 
completed focus on outmoded treatments; enrolled too few minority patients; lack a range of 
disease severity; failed to collect baseline functional assessments; or include a 
preponderance of elderly, infirm patients and/or low-risk patients, for whom treatment is 
questionable.3,5,6,28–30 The ProtecT trial, for example, included 99% Caucasian patients and 
nearly 80% Gleason 6 (low-risk) patients.5,6 In ProtecT, 87% of surgical patients underwent 
open RP (compared to 77% robotic in this study) and patients undergoing EBRT had 3D 
conformal RT plus ADT (compared to 81% IMRT, with 45% receiving concurrent ADT in 
this study).5,6 Thus, ProtecT study findings may be difficult to apply to a racially diverse 
population with a range of disease risk strata, managed with contemporary treatments.
Case series that have evaluated functional outcomes are not generalizable because they 
report on outcomes at centers of excellence; lack the variables necessary to adjust for 
confounding; lack an AS group as a comparator; or have other sources of bias.31–37
Despite these caveats, functional outcomes in this study are similar to previously published 
multi-institutional prospective cohort studies, and the ProtecT trial.6,20,38–41 Nonetheless, 
comparisons between the CEASAR cohort and similar historical cohorts have shown slightly 
smaller declines in erectile function domain scores at 6 and 12 months with robotic RP 
compared with open RP, and slightly better bowel domain scores at 6 months for IMRT 
compared to older 3D conformal RT.42,43 These data suggest that contemporary treatments 
have similar associations with functional outcomes, but perhaps slightly less in magnitude.
This study may have implications for decision making in localized prostate cancer. First, it 
demonstrates the frequency and severity of side effects of contemporary treatments, and the 
likelihood of preserved global quality of life regardless of treatment, thus providing a basis 
for shared decision-making. Secondly, in contrast to previously published studies, this study 
may be more generalizable, since the cohort is racially diverse, population based, and 
includes a range of disease severity.3,6,28,38 Third, this study may inform future research on 
personalized risk assessment; tools to facilitate shared decision making; and other patient-
centered outcomes.
This study has several limitations. There may be disagreement about the definition of MID, 
which may also differ from one patient to the next. While some outcomes favored one 
treatment over another, the results do not indicate what value patients place on particular 
domains. Furthermore, there are other important outcomes to consider in localized prostate 
cancer, including long-term functional outcomes and oncologic endpoints, anxiety, 
satisfaction, and financial toxicity. The number and severity of adverse outcomes presenting 
beyond 3 years may differ by treatment, and 3 years is inadequate to estimate oncologic 
outcomes. Data on patients who had alternative treatments, such as brachytherapy and 
ablation, were not included because there were not enough patients who received these 
treatments to generate sufficient statistical power for reliable comparisons. Aggregated data 
and average function scores may fail to capture the severity of side effects for individuals, 
and do not yield personalized risk estimates. The analysis did not adjust for the quality of 
care or experience of the treating provider or institution, which may influence outcomes.

 Thus, the findings of this study represent a sub-set of the information needed to guide 
decision making. A substantial proportion of patients answered the baseline survey after 
initiating treatment, raising the possibility of recall bias, although in prior studies the 
magnitude of recall bias was small for the EPIC.16 This study used an observational cohort, 
rather than an experimental design, so there may be unmeasured sources of confounding.
Conclusion
In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, RP was associated with a larger decline 
in sexual function and urinary incontinence than EBRT or AS after 3 years, and lesser 
urinary irritative symptoms compared to AS; however, there were no meaningful differences 
in bowel or hormonal function beyond 12 months and no meaningful differences in global 
quality of life measures. These findings may facilitate counseling regarding the comparative 
harms of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer.

 Key Points
Question
What are the comparative harms of contemporary treatments for localized prostate 
cancer?
Findings
In this prospective, population-based cohort study of 2,550 men, radical prostatectomy 
was associated with significant declines in sexual function compared with external beam 
radiotherapy (−11.9 points on a 100-point scale) and active surveillance (−16.2 points) at 
3 years. Radical prostatectomy was also associated with significant declines in urinary 
incontinence compared to radiation and active surveillance, but there were no meaningful 
differences in bowel or hormonal function beyond 12 months, and no meaningful 
differences in global quality of life.
Meaning
Quantifying the harms of different treatment options may facilitate treatment counseling 
in men with localized prostate cancer.

Association Between Treatment and Sexual Function Outcomes. Outcomes are sexual 
function domain scores and selected individual items from the Expanded Prostate Cancer 
Index Composite (EPIC-26). Domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score 
representing better function. Time zero is the date of treatment for radical prostatectomy and 
external beam radiation therapy patients, and date of diagnosis for active surveillance 
patients. Minimum clinically important difference for the sexual domain score is 10 points. 
Individual item probabilities range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a higher 
probability of favorable outcome. Numbers in the legends indicate the number of men who 
completed baseline and 36-month sexual domain surveys for each treatment group. 
Longitudinal figures extend to 37 months along the x-axis because the interval between 
treatment and completion of the 36-month survey was greater than 36 months for some 
patients.

Domain Score (95% CI), Longitudinally by Treatment in All Men (panel A), Men with 
Excellent Baseline Domain Score (panel B), and Men with Lower Baseline Domain Score 
(panel C). A baseline domain score of 90 or above was defined as excellent, and a score 
below 90 was defined as lower, approximating subgroups of the top quartile and all others.
D: Adjusted Mean Point Difference (95% CI) in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 
(EPIC-26) Sexual Domain Score Between Groups at 3 Years. Forest plots depict the 
covariate adjusted effect of treatment, baseline sexual domain score, age, and D’Amico risk 
stratum on domain score at 3 years, estimated from multivariable regression models that 
controlled for baseline domain score, age, race, comorbidity, prostate cancer risk group, 
physical function, social support, depression, medical decision-making style and accrual 
site. Effect size represents the adjusted mean point difference on the EPIC domain score 
between groups; the group after the colon (:) is the referent, so positive values may be 
interpreted as better outcome for the group before the colon and negative values indicate a 
better outcome for the group after the colon. Reference lines indicate the minimum clinically 
important difference (10 points). eTable 8 contains unadjusted domain scores and number of 
patients for each subgroup (age, baseline domain score and disease risk group) by treatment. 
D’Amico risk classification system predicts the risk of recurrence after treatment for 
clinically localized prostate cancer. Low-risk disease is defined as a clinical stage T2a or 
less, Gleason Score 6 (3+3) or less, and a prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL. 
High-risk disease is defined as T2c or higher, Gleason Score 8 (3+5, 4+4, 5+3) or greater, or 
a prostate-specific antigen greater than 20 ng/mL. Disease not defined as low or high-risk is 
defined as intermediate-risk.

Association Between Treatment and Bowel Function Outcomes. Outcomes are bowel 
function domain scores and selected individual items from the Expanded Prostate Cancer 
Index Composite (EPIC-26). Domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score 
representing better function. Time zero is the date of treatment for radical prostatectomy and 
external beam radiation therapy patients, and date of diagnosis for active surveillance 
patients. Minimum clinically important difference for the bowel function domain score is 4 
points. Individual item probabilities range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a 
higher probability of favorable outcome. Numbers in the legends indicate the number of men 
who completed baseline and 36-month bowel function domain surveys for each treatment

the covariate adjusted effect of treatment, baseline bowel function domain score, age, and 
D’Amico risk stratum on domain score at 3 years, estimated from multivariable regression 
models that controlled for baseline domain score, age, race, comorbidity, prostate cancer risk 
group, physical function, social support, depression, medical decision-making style and 
accrual site. Effect size represents the adjusted mean point difference on the EPIC domain 
score between groups; the group after the colon (:) is the referent, so positive values may be 
interpreted as better outcome for the group before the colon and negative values indicate a 
better outcome for the group after the colon. Reference lines indicate the minimum clinically 
important difference (4 points). eTable 8 contains unadjusted domain scores and number of 
patients for each subgroup (age, baseline domain score and disease risk group) by treatment.

clinically localized prostate cancer. Low-risk disease is defined as a clinical stage T2a or 
less, Gleason Score 6 (3+3) or less, and a prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL. 
High-risk disease is defined as T2c or higher, Gleason Score 8 (3+5, 4+4, 5+3) or greater, or 
a prostate-specific antigen greater than 20 ng/mL. Disease not defined as low or high-risk is

aTotal Illness Burden Index for Prostate Cancer (TIBI CaP) is a validated measure of comorbidity and predictor of all-cause mortality in a prostate cancer population. Scores range from 0 to 23, with higher 
score indicating a higher number and/or greater severity of comorbid illnesses.
bD’Amico risk classification system predicts the risk of recurrence after treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Low-risk disease is defined as a clinical stage T2a or less, Gleason Score 6 (3+3) or 
less, and a prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL. High-risk disease is defined as T2c or higher, Gleason Score 8 (3+5, 4+4, 5+3) or greater, or a prostate-specific antigen greater than 20 ng/mL. 
Disease not defined as low or high-risk is defined as intermediate-risk.
cThe 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite assesses sexual, urinary, bowel and hormonal function, and domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better function.
dThe Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health consisting of 8 domains. The physical function domain score is a weighted sum of 10 questions on the SF-36 
(items 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12). The emotional well-being domain score is a weighted sum of 5 items on the SF-36 (items 24, 25, 26, 28, 30). The energy/fatigue score is a weighted sum of 4 questions on the 
SF-36 (items 23, 27, 29, 31). Each domain score is directly transformed to a scale of 0–100 with increasing scores indicating better function or less disability.
eFive selected questions from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were used to create a modified domain score. Responses were directly transformed to a scale of 0–100 with increasing 
scores indicating greater support.
fThe depression scale score is derived using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Scores were scaled to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive 
symptoms.
gThe Medical Decision Making Style Score is a validated measure of participatory decision making, using 7 items, scored on a scale from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating increased patient choice, 
control, and responsibility.
