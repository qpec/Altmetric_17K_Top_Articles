Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Research has shown that higher activation and engagement with health care is 
associated with better self-management. To our knowledge, the linkage intervention (LINKAGE) 
is the first to engage patients receiving addiction treatment with health care using the electronic 
health record and a patient activation approach.
OBJECTIVE—To examine the effects of an intervention aiming to link patients receiving 
addiction treatment with health care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A nonrandomized clinical trial evaluating the 
LINKAGE intervention vs usual care by applying an alternating 3-month off-and-on design over 
30 months. Participants were recruited from an outpatient addiction treatment clinic in a large 
health system between April 7, 2011, and October 2, 2013.

 INTERVENTIONS—Six group-based, manual-guided sessions on patient engagement in health 
care and the use of health information technology resources in the electronic health record, as well 
as facilitated communication with physicians, vs usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary outcomes, measured at 6 months after 
enrollment, were patient activation (by interview using the Patient Activation Measure), patient 
engagement in health care (by interview and electronic health record), and alcohol, drug, and 
depression outcomes (by interview using the Addiction Severity Index for alcohol and drug 
outcomes and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression).
RESULTS—A total of 503 patients were recruited and assigned to the LINKAGE (n = 252) or 
usual care (n = 251) conditions, with no differences in baseline characteristics between conditions. 
The mean (SD) age of the patients was 42.5 (11.8) years, 31.0% (n = 156) were female, and 455 
(90.5%) completed the 6-month interview. Compared with usual care participants, LINKAGE 
participants showed an increase in the mean number of log-in days (incidence rate ratio, 1.53; 95% 
CI, 1.19–1.97; P = .001). Similar results were found across types of patient portal use 
(communicating by email, viewing laboratory test results and information, and obtaining medical 
advice). LINKAGE participants were more likely to talk with their physicians about addiction 
problems (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.52–3.49; P < .001). Although 6-month abstinence rates were 
high for both conditions (≥70.0% for both) and depression symptoms improved (the proportion 
with scores≥15 on the 9-item PHQ dropped from 15.1% [38 of 252] to 8.0% [18 of 225] among 
LINKAGE participants), there were no differences between conditions. Those who received all 
intervention components had significantly better alcohol and other drug outcomes than those who 
received fewer intervention components.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of the 
LINKAGE intervention in helping patients receiving addiction treatment engage in health care and 
increase communication with their physicians. The intervention did not affect short-term 
abstinence or depression outcomes. Understanding if the LINKAGE intervention helps prevent 
relapse and manage long-term recovery will be important.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01621711
Patients with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders have high rates of medical and 
psychiatric comorbidities and complex treatment needs.1–4 They often rely on emergency 
services, seldom using preventive services even when they have health insurance,5–7 with 
that trend increasing in recent years.8 At the same time, health care has a key role in positive 
AOD use outcomes and lower cost trajectories.7,9–13 Although a robust linkage between 
mainstream health care and addiction treatment would benefit these patients,14 this goal has 
not been accomplished.2,3
Health care reform and related policy changes have brought unprecedented opportunities to 
improve integration of care for patients with AOD problems.15 Building on the Mental 
Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act,16,17 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act18 made addiction services an “essential benefit” rather than being subject to more 
limitations than for other health conditions.18 In addition, the fast-paced evolution and 
implementation of health information technology (eg, electronic health records [EHRs], 
Weisner et al.

 including patient portals)19–23 stemming from “meaningful use” regulations offer innovative 
mechanisms for patients with AOD disorders to engage in their health care.15–17
However, patients with AOD disorders lag behind individuals with other health conditions in 
participating in their health care through patient portals,24 and few interventions to facilitate 
their use have been tested. At the same time, studies25–27 demonstrate the use of health 
technology by patients with AOD and psychiatric disorders. Patient portals provide 
opportunities to engage in health care, such as interacting with clinicians, using online 
programs for health problems (eg, sleep disorders or coping with pain), and obtaining 
medical information and appointments. To our knowledge, the linkage intervention 
(LINKAGE) is the first trial of an intervention focused on increasing engagement of patients 
having AOD disorders with health care using the EHR and patient portals as a platform, as 
well as a patient activation approach used for other health conditions for engaging patients.22
Building on research in other health conditions demonstrating that higher activation levels 
are associated with better self-management,28–30 we hypothesized that the LINKAGE 
intervention would increase patient activation and engagement in health care, decrease AOD 
use, and reduce depression symptoms. We also examined intervention results for the subset 
of patients with psychiatric comorbidity.
Methods
Study Design
The study site was the San Francisco outpatient addiction treatment clinic of Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California, a large health care system. The study was a nonrandomized 
clinical trial31 comparing the LINKAGE intervention and usual care (UC). Intervention 
allocation was determined by a nonrandomized, alternating off-and-on design over 30 
months (ie, 5 alternating 3-month periods for each condition). After a random start, the 
LINKAGE intervention groups alternated with the UC medical education groups, changing 
every 3 months. Eligible patients were recruited in each period, were assigned to the current 
arm, and received LINKAGE or UC medical education sessions accordingly. The study used 
an off-and-on design rather than randomization due to high risk of contamination because 
patients in both conditions attended the larger treatment program together. Although it was 
nonrandom, patient allocation was independent of patient characteristics, thus enhancing 
comparability in potential confounders between conditions.
Key Points
Question
What is the effect of an intervention aiming to engage patients receiving addiction 
treatment with health care using the electronic health record and a patient activation 
approach?
Findings
This nonrandomized clinical trial found a significant effect of the LINKAGE intervention 
on patient engagement in health care, including patient portal use and communication

 with physicians about alcohol and other drug problems. Six-month abstinence rates were 
high and comparable between conditions.
Meaning
Teaching and activating patients receiving addiction treatment on how to use health care 
may empower them to better engage in their health management, and electronic health 
record patient portals may be useful in accomplishing this goal.
Study Participants
Patients 18 years or older deemed eligible by their physician were recruited between April 7, 
2011, and October 2, 2013, after completing a 10-day stabilization program. Nine potential 
participants were not eligible because of severe cognitive disability, and 40 were ineligible 
due to severe psychiatric comorbidity (ie, exhibiting severe mania, active psychosis, or 
severe aggressive behavior) (26 LINKAGE participants and 23 UC participants). All 
participants provided written informed consent, receiving $50 compensation for the baseline 
interview and $60 compensation for the 6-month interview. The institutional review boards 
of the University of California, San Francisco, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California 
approved the study, and it received a National Institutes of Health Certificate of 
Confidentiality.
Baseline Assessment
After informed consent, the baseline interview was self-administered by computer with a 
research technician (S.B.W.) present. Data were collected on demographics, socioeconomic 
status (education and income), computer and smart-phone access and use, AOD dependence 
by type (using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Psychoactive Substance Dependence in 
the DSM-IV),32,33 and baseline measures of 6-month outcome measures. Nineteen 
substance abuse–related medical condition categories and 4 psychiatric disorders (major 
depression, anxiety, bipolar, and other psychotic disorders)1,10,13 were collected from the 
EHR.
Usual Care
Participants in both arms received standard treatment, including medical examinations and 
detoxification. Standard treatment first included a 2-week stabilization program. The next 
phase (when study recruitment occurred) lasted 6 weeks and consisted of 2 groups per day, 5 
days a week, during which participants received either the LINKAGE or UC medical 
education sessions depending on whether it was an on or off period. Usual care medical 
education sessions were 45 minutes and were conducted by a licensed therapist. They 
focused on AOD-associated medical and psychological problems. Standard treatment also 
included therapy groups, individual counseling, 12-step meetings, and weekly breathalyzer 
and urine screens. Appointments with physicians and medications were available.
LINKAGE Intervention
LINKAGE participants received standard treatment. However, instead of the UC medical 
education sessions, they received six 45-minute group-based, manual-guided sessions (2 per

 week) conducted by a clinical psychologist (T.B.R.), which focused on demonstrating how 
health care is related to overall health, accessing and engaging with health care, and 
improving communication with physicians. The theoretical approach was patient activation, 
namely, “understanding one’s role in the care process and having the knowledge, skill, and 
confidence to manage one’s health and health care.”34(p207) Participants were taught key 
patient portal skills (eg, using secure email, viewing laboratory test results and medical 
information, and accessing prevention services) and were motivated to use them. They also 
practiced skills necessary for collaborative communication with health care professionals 
and were offered contact with their primary care physician facilitated by a therapist (T.B.R.) 
(ie, a 15-minute telephone appointment, a secure email, or help in preparation for an in-
person medical visit to discuss their addiction and treatment, health concerns, and ongoing 
care).
Follow-up Assessment
Telephone interviews were conducted at 6 months after study enrollment. Electronic health 
record data were obtained for both the intervention period (study enrollment through 6 
weeks, conservatively allowing for missed and makeup sessions) and the postintervention 
period (week 7 through 6 months).
Outcome Measures
The Patient Activation Measure score assessed patient beliefs, knowledge, and confidence 
regarding engaging in health behaviors on a 13-item scale (score range, 1–100 points).35 
Again of 3 to 5 points is associated with improved health behaviors and positive health 
outcomes.36
Patient engagement primary outcomes were days of patient portal log-in measured by the 
EHR and communication about AOD problems with the primary care physician measured 
by the following interview question: “Have you talked to your primary care provider about 
AOD problems?” (yes or no). Electronic health record data were also collected on the use of 
the patient portal to email physicians, check laboratory test results, access information about 
laboratory tests and medical conditions, and obtain medical advice.
Addiction treatment retention during the 6 months after study recruitment was calculated 
from the EHR as the number of days attending treatment without a gap of 7 or more 
continuous days, consistent with the program’s definition of dropout.9 Alcohol and other 
drug abstinence and heavy drinking were measured by the Addiction Severity Index37 and 
by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism evidence-based questions on the 
numbers of days drinking and days of heavy drinking (≥5 drinks per day for men and ≥4 
drinks per day for women)38,39 and the use of each of 9 substances in the past 30 days.
Depression symptoms were measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire.40 Scores 
range from 0 to 27. A score of at least 15 indicates moderate to severe depression and need 
for active depression treatment.41 We found no differences between conditions using cut 
points of 10 or 15.

 Statistical Analysis
Power calculations are 2 sided, with a significance level of .05. Assuming an overall 
proportion of 60.0% improvement in patient activation (eg, ≥3-point improvement in the 
Patient Activation Measure score), we had greater than 0.80 power to test at least a 13.0% 
difference between conditions with a sample size of 225 per group. With a total abstinence 
rate of 60.0%13,42 in the UC condition, power to detect a 15.0% between-condition 
difference was 0.92 with a sample size of 219. Although longitudinal Poisson regression 
models were used in analyzing patient portal use, we present a more conservative estimation 
for analysis of a single time point. We had power of 0.99 with a sample size of 142 in each 
condition to detect a risk ratio of 1.5 for patient portal use between conditions.
We examined comparability between conditions on baseline characteristics using general 
linear regression for continuous variables and Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables. The 
LINKAGE intervention effect on patient portal use was analyzed using generalized 
estimating equation Poisson regression, with allowance for overdispersion using a quasi-
likelihood approach43 adjusting for dependence and time. We report main effects from 
models without inclusion of the interaction of the intervention with time because the time-
averaged effect of the LINKAGE intervention (compared with UC) was the main interest. 
The intervention effect on nonportal outcomes at 6 months was examined using logistic 
regression for binary-measures and general linear regression for continuous measures. To 
account for multiple comparisons, we conducted both unadjusted analyses and analyses with 
Bonferroni correction for 5 outcomes (patient activation, days of patient portal log-in, 
communication about AOD problems with the primary care physician, AOD use outcomes, 
and depression outcomes).
Exploratory analysis within the LINKAGE condition examined the effects of the number of 
LINKAGE sessions attended and facilitated physician communication on each outcome 
using Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and general linear regression for continuous 
variables. We also examined the differences between conditions among the subsample with 
psychiatric comorbidity.1,13 Analyses were conducted using the intent-to-treat principle with 
statistical software (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Enrollment and Follow-up
Of 520 eligible patients, 503 were recruited and completed a baseline interview (Figure). Of 
these patients, 455 (90.5%) completed the 6-month interview, with no significant differences 
between conditions. Three hundred ninety-five of 503 (78.5%) had a psychiatric 
comorbidity.
Receipt of the LINKAGE Intervention
Of the 252 LINKAGE participants, 246 (97.6%) attended at least 1 session, with 139 
(55.2%) attending 1 to 5 and 107 (42.5%) attending all 6. Among the UC participants, 230 
(91.6%) attended at least 1 session, with 107 (42.6%) attending 1 to 5 and 123 (49.0%)

 attending all 6. Facilitated telephone, email, or in-person visits by LINKAGE participants 
with primary care physicians were received by 173 of 252 (68.7%) (Figure).
Baseline Patient Characteristics
We found no significant differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, annual household 
income, AOD dependence, level of patient activation, or access to computer or smartphone 
or use between LINKAGE and UC conditions (Table 1). The mean length of Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California membership was 6.5 years, with no difference between 
conditions. We found no differences in the prevalence of medical and psychiatric 
comorbidities10,13,44 except for liver cirrhosis (11 [4.4%] for LINKAGE and 25 [10.0%] for 
UC) and diabetes (10 [4.0%] for LINKAGE and 22 [8.8%] for UC) (P < .05 for both). The 
only difference among either the full sample or the subsample with psychiatric comorbidity 
was that more UC participants reported talking with their physician about AOD problems (P 
= .02 for the full sample and P = .001 for the subsample with psychiatric comorbidity).
Six-Month Outcomes
Patient Activation and Engagement in Health Care—At 6 months, participants in 
both conditions had higher mean Patient Activation Measure scores than at baseline. More 
participants in the LINKAGE condition had an increase of at least 3 points, although the 
difference was not statistically significant (129 of 225 [57.3%] vs 116 of 230 [50.4%], P = .
14 among the full sample and 104 of 172 [60.5%] vs 92 of 182 [50.6%], P = .06 among the 
subsample with psychiatric comorbidity) (Table 2). LINKAGE participants had significantly 
more patient portal use during the intervention period, and the differences remained 
significant after the intervention through the 6-month followup. The results from generalized 
estimating equation overdispersed Poisson models demonstrated that, compared with UC 
participants, LINKAGE participants showed a 1.53-fold increase in the mean number of log-
in days (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19–1.97; P = .001). Similar results were 
found across the following types of patient portal use: the mean number of log-in days for 
medical advice (IRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13–2.11; P = .006), the mean number of messages 
sent by a health care professional (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08–1.94; P = .02), the mean number 
of log-in days for laboratory test results review (IRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.43–2.56; P < .001), 
and the mean number of log-in days for laboratory test information (IRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 
1.43–2.51; P < .001). Among the subsample with psychiatric comorbidity, those in the 
LINKAGE condition also had significantly higher use of each activity.
LINKAGE participants had twice the odds of having talked with their primary care 
physician about AOD problems (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.52–3.49; P < .001 among the 
full sample and odds ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.00–2.57; P = .05 among the subsample with 
psychiatric comorbidity). No differences were found in addiction treatment length of stay for 
the full sample or the subsample with psychiatric comorbidity.
AOD Use and Depression Symptoms—Among both the full sample and the 
subsample with psychiatric comorbidity, LINKAGE participants and UC participants had 
high AOD abstinence rates at 6 months, with no significant differences between conditions 
(Table 3). No differences were found for heavy drinking or moderate to severe depression,

 although the proportion with scores of at least 15 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
dropped by almost half from 15.1% (38 of 252) to 8.0% (18 of 225) for LINKAGE 
participants and from 13.5% (34 of 251) to 7.0% (16 of 230) for UC participants.
Effects of the Number of LINKAGE Sessions and Facilitated Physician Communication
Among LINKAGE participants, those receiving all 6 sessions had higher patient portal use 
than those receiving fewer sessions. They also had higher alcohol abstinence rates (83.7% 
[82 of 98] vs 71.7% [91 of 127], P = .03) and total abstinence rates (77.6% [76 of 98] vs 
65.4% [83 of 127], P = .05) and longer treatment retention (103.8 vs 60.4 days, P < .001) 
(Table 4). We did not examine a dose-response effect because, while the sessions built on 
each other, they each had a unique focus. Participants receiving facilitated physician 
communication (68.7% [173 of 252]) had significantly higher mean patient portal use during 
the intervention period than those not receiving facilitated physician communication, and the 
differences remained significant for the postintervention period except for physician email 
exchange. More of those receiving facilitated physician communication also reported talking 
to their physician about AOD problems and had longer treatment retention (92.0 vs 49.3 
days, P < .001), better alcohol abstinence (82.9% [131 of 158] vs 62.7% [42 of 67], P < .
001), and less heavy drinking (8.9% [14 of 158] vs 26.9% [18 of 67], P < .001). Similar 
results were found for the subsample with psychiatric comorbidity, although some findings 
were not statistically significant.
Discussion
The LINKAGE intervention taught skills to help patients communicate effectively with 
physicians and engage in their health care using the EHR as a platform. LINKAGE 
participants had more days of patient portal log-in, including seeking medical advice, 
receiving messages from primary care physicians, checking on laboratory test results, and 
reviewing medical information. Participants with psychiatric comorbidity had findings 
similar to those of the full sample, indicating that the intervention was also beneficial in 
engaging these complex patients.
However, the intervention did not result in better 6-month AOD or depression outcomes. We 
note that the LINKAGE intervention did not focus on AOD use or depression, which was the 
emphasis of the standard treatment program. Abstinence rates were high for both conditions 
(≥70.0% for both), similar to the results of other trials conducted in this health system.13,42 
Depression outcomes also significantly improved for both groups but with no differences 
between conditions. Six months may not have been long enough to observe any differences 
in these outcomes given the intensive treatment program. However, by taking better care of 
their health, we expect that LINKAGE participants will have better outcomes than UC 
participants over time. Because AOD disorders are chronic health conditions requiring 
ongoing care,3,45 we also expect that, by engaging patients in their health care, potential 
service needs will be identified earlier and relapse avoided.36
Another approach to providing services in a separate primary care clinic, the Addiction 
Health Evaluation and Disease Management (AHEAD) trial, also found no differences in 
AOD use outcomes.46 A trial that provided facilitated referral to primary care after

 detoxification demonstrated that patients were more likely to access medical services, but no 
differences were observed in AOD use outcomes.47 The LINKAGE intervention may best be 
placed in specialty addiction treatment, where patients can address their AOD problems as 
part of a larger program and may be more open to thinking about their overall health while 
also practicing patient engagement activities.
Findings on patient portal use were conservative in not counting the first 6 weeks of 
treatment. Many patients completed the intervention in 3 weeks, but we extended the 
analysis during the intervention to 6 weeks to allow for potential missed sessions and 
makeup sessions. For those who received the full intervention, beneficial effects were more 
robust, including alcohol abstinence and heavy drinking outcomes. This finding suggests a 
potential significant effect if the intervention was adopted as part of standard treatment. The 
LINKAGE intervention was innovative in its use of the EHR to engage patients in health 
prevention and other services. Our findings suggest that patients receiving addiction 
treatment are interested in having a role in their health care and in using health information 
technology.45 The intervention is scalable because EHR use and patient portal use are 
increasing under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related 
incentives.20,23,25,48 The intervention is manual based and relies on the common addiction 
group therapy format.2 Although patients with AOD disorders often use episodic care rather 
than comprehensive health services, similar to other patients,4,5 the intervention helped them 
better connect with their overall health care and improve communication with their 
physician.
We note that the intervention focused on patients rather than physicians. Physicians often are 
unaware of their patients’ AOD problems,2 and patients may change health plans or 
physicians. The patient empowerment and skills in managing health care that were the core 
elements of the intervention can be used by patients wherever they receive medical care.
Our study had some limitations. It used an off-and-on, non-randomized clinical trial design, 
in which participant allocation was done by alternation, with different cohorts changing 
every 3 months over 30 months. Patient allocation was independent of patient 
characteristics. Most important, randomization would have resulted in contamination 
between study conditions because patients in both conditions were together during other 
parts of the standard program. It successfully resulted in similar demographic and clinical 
baseline characteristics between conditions. The study may have been under powered for 
examining the effect on patient activation level. It did not include validation with biological 
specimens because follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone; however, self-
reported differences should have been similar for both conditions, and other studies13,49–53 
have found high concurrence. Although the study was conducted in an integrated health 
system with a mature EHR, it provides an excellent laboratory for examining the 
intervention. By 2014, more than 80% of US primary care physicians had adopted an EHR, 
and more than half were using all basic EHR functions.21

 Conclusions
Every year, more than 3 million US adults enter addiction treatment, and this number will 
increase with its new status as an essential benefit of patient care.18 Among the adult general 
population, 3.9% in 2013 met diagnostic criteria for drug use disorders54 and 13.9% for 
alcohol use disorders.55 These individuals often have co-occurring problems, and their care 
needs to be integrated with mainstream health care.14 Teaching patients receiving addiction 
treatment how to use health care may empower them to better engage in their health 
management. Electronic health record patient portals may be useful in accomplishing this 
goal. Although the LINKAGE intervention did not achieve short-term differences in AOD 
and depression outcomes, it will be important to understand if it is helpful in avoiding AOD 
relapse and in improving overall health.
