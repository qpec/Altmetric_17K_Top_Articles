A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a group of
commonneurodevelopmentaldisabilitiesofmostlyun-
known etiologic factors. Recent studies have sug-
gested that the prevalence of ASD in the general US population
maybegreaterthan1%,1withapproximately4timesmoremales
affected than females. Autism spectrum disorder has a strong
genetic component, with heritability estimates ranging from
50%to90%.2-4 Recentwhole-genomeandexomestudieshave
implicatedanincreasingnumberofgenesandpathwaysinASD,
highlightingitsextremelocusheterogeneity.5-9Atpresent,clini-
cal genetics evaluation is recommended after an ASD diagno-
sis and is estimated to result in an identified etiologic factor in
30% to 40% of patients.10 Because the cause of most cases of
ASD cannot yet be explained using genetic approaches, sev-
eral groups have sought to associate environmental exposures
with ASD.11-13 However, the risk conferred by genomic varia-
tion in combination with environmental exposures remains
unknown. Understanding the rate at which ASD diagnoses are
shared among siblings in a family will aid in the interpretation
of the genetic and environmental factors that increase the fa-
milial risk for ASD, leading to improved screening and counsel-
ing at the point of care.
The sibling recurrence rate, defined as the probability of
a child having ASD with 1 or more siblings with ASD, has been
estimated to be 6.1% to 18.7%.14,15 However, sex-specific re-
currence rates in the general US population remain largely
IMPORTANCE Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is known to be more prevalent among males
than females in the general population. Although overall risk of recurrence of ASD among
siblings has been estimated to be between 6.1% and 24.7%, information on sex-specific
recurrence patterns is lacking.
OBJECTIVE To estimate high-confidence sex-specific recurrence rates of ASD among siblings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study used an administrative database
to measure the incidence of ASD among children in 1 583 271 families (37 507 with at least 1
diagnosis of ASD) enrolled in commercial health care insurance plans at a large US managed
health care company from January 1, 2008, through February 29, 2016. Families in the study
had 2 children who were observed for at least 12 months between 4 and 18 years of age.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary measure of ASD recurrence was defined as the
diagnosis of ASD in a younger sibling of an older sibling with an ASD diagnosis.
RESULTS Among the 3 166 542 children (1 547 266 females and 1 619 174 males; mean [SD]
age, 11.2 [4.7] years) in the study, the prevalence of ASD was 1.96% (95% CI, 1.94%-1.98%)
among males and 0.50% (95% CI, 0.49%-0.51%) among females. When a male was
associated with risk in the family, ASD was diagnosed in 4.2% (95% CI, 3.8%-4.7%) of female
siblings and 12.9% (95% CI, 12.2%-13.6%) of male siblings. When a female was associated
with risk in the family, ASD was diagnosed in 7.6% (95% CI, 6.5%-8.9%) of female siblings
and 16.7% (95% CI, 15.2%-18.4%) of male siblings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings are in agreement with the higher rates of ASD
observed among males than among females in the general population. Our study provides
more specific guidance for the screening and counseling of families and may help inform
future investigations into the environmental and genetic factors that confer risk of ASD.

 unknown; these data are particularly important for a sexu-
ally dimorphic disorder such as ASD, for which the strongest
risk factor is being male.16,17 Recent studies have examined
sex-specific ASD recurrence in siblings in small, targeted
cohorts14,18-21 or birth cohorts,3 but the sex-specific recur-
rence among siblings in the general US population remains to
be quantified. Thus, we performed a large, retrospective popu-
lation analysis of the rate at which sibling pairs are com-
monly or singly diagnosed with ASD. The data for this analy-
sis were derived from diagnostic billing codes at a commercial
managed health care company in the United States, yielding
the largest such study to date, to our knowledge.
Methods
Our study population was drawn from a deidentified admin-
istrative database at Aetna, a commercial managed health care
company. At the time of analysis, the database contained
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
diagnostic billing codes for more than 63 million individuals
in the United States during a 98-month time frame from Janu-
ary 1, 2008, through February 29, 2016. No race, ethnicity, or
socioeconomic data were present in the database. The
Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board waived
the requirement for approval, as it deemed this analysis of the
database to not be human subjects research.
Usingsubscriber-to-memberrelationshipinformationcon-
tained in the enrollment data, we identified all families with
exactly 2 children between the ages of 4 and 18 years and with
at least 12 months of medical coverage. The children in these
families constituted our study population. A small fraction of
the designated siblings in these families may have been ge-
netically unrelated or half-siblings. Because there is no way
to identify and exclude these siblings from our analysis, we ac-
knowledge that this caveat may lead to underestimation of the
rates of recurrence. However, this limitation should be com-
parable for males and females.
In total, 3 166 542 children were evaluable from 1 583 271
families. Of these, 39 460 children from 37 507 families had re-
ceived a diagnosis of ASD (ICD-9 code in the 299 group), indi-
catinganoverallpopulationincidenceof1.25%(95%CI,1.23%-
1.26%).Themaletofemaleratiooftheoverallstudypopulation
was 1.05, and the male to female ratio of those with ASD was
4.10.
To examine the sex-specific association of an older sib-
ling’
s ASD diagnosis with diagnosis in the younger sibling (ie,
recurrence),weperformedamultiplelogisticregressiononthe
21 074 two-child families in the study population whose old-
est child had received a diagnosis of ASD. The younger sib-
ling’
s diagnosis status was modeled as a function of the child’
s
mean age during the observation period and the interaction
between the birth-ordered sexes of the sibling pair (male and
male, male and female, female and male, and female and fe-
male). Because the database contains only birth year and not
full birth dates, we could not with certainty identify twins.
Thus, any sibling pairs with the same birth year were ex-
cluded from this portion of the analysis. The child’
s age was
determined to not be significantly associated with ASD diag-
nosis in the younger sibling (see Results) and was omitted from
the final model. Recurrence probabilities and their respective
95% CIs were calculated from the logistic regression. P values
describing the significance of the difference between pairs of
estimated recurrence rates and their associated SEs were cal-
culatedusingaz-testonthelogodds-scalevaluesderivedfrom
the regression model. P < .05 (2-tailed) was considered sig-
nificant. All calculations were performed using a combina-
tion of custom written queries in Microsoft SQL Server 2014
(Microsoft Corp) and R statistical software.22
Results
Overview
In a general population cohort of 3 166 542 children from
1 583 271 sibling pairs, the overall prevalence of ASD was 1.25%
(95% CI, 1.23%-1.26%); the prevalence was 1.96% (95% CI,
1.94%-1.98%) among males and 0.50% (95% CI, 0.49%-
0.51%) among females. The male to female ratio of the study
population was 1.05 and of individuals with ASD was 4.1, con-
sistent with previous findings.17 Figure 1 summarizes sex-
specific ASD diagnoses in the 4 types of sibling pairs studied.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of ASD diagnoses by age
in the study cohort. The timing of diagnosis peaked at 5 to 6
years of age and decreased thereafter, consistent with previ-
ous reports.1,23 Each child may have received multiple diag-
noses during the observation period, and diagnoses may have
occurred before or after the required 12-month observation pe-
riod between 4 and 18 years of age. Because the rate of diag-
nosis varied with age, we examined the effect of including ad-
justments for age when measuring the association of a sibling’
s
ASD diagnosis. Age was determined to not be a significant
covariate (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .13) in the
logistic regression. Inclusion of age in the model yielded no
statistically significant difference in the recurrence probabili-
ties for any of the sibling pairs when computed at 4 years of
age vs 18 years of age (the useful range of the model). Thus,
age was omitted from the regression analysis.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of study participants (in-
cluding older and younger siblings) for number of months of
observation. The spikes at 12-month intervals can be attrib-
uted to the data being derived from an administrative data-
Key Points
Question What are the sex-specific recurrence rates of autism
spectrum disorder among siblings?
Findings In this population analysis of 1 583 271 families with 2
children, a significantly increased risk of recurrence of autism
spectrum disorder was found among males than among females.
Meaning An older female sibling diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder is associated with greater risk of recurrence in the
younger sibling compared with an older diagnosed male sibling,
and male siblings are more likely to experience recurrence than
female siblings regardless of the sex of the diagnosed sibling.

 base at a US managed health care company, and commercial
health plans typically renew or change enrollment on an an-
nual basis. The spike at 98 months represents the siblings who
were enrolled for the entire 98-month observation period re-
corded in the data set. The quartiles of the distribution were
24, 44, and 72 months; 75% of the children had at least 24
months of observation, 50% had at least 44 months of obser-
vation, and 20% had at least 72 months of observation.
Approximately 15% of the claims that met the coding
criteria for the study population did not record a specialty
for the servicing health care provider. Among the remaining
85% of claims, the top 10 most frequently recorded special-
ties, accounting for greater than 90% of the claims with an
ASD diagnosis, were mental health professional, physical
rehabilitation professional, family practice, mental health
provider, pediatrics, acute short-term hospital, dentistry,
children’
s hospital, neurology, and rehabilitation facility.
The remaining 57 recorded specialties each accounted
for 1% or less of all ASD diagnosis claims for the study
population.

 ASD Recurrence Rates
We estimated sex-specific recurrence rates of ASD by fitting a
logistic regression on the 21 074 families with 2 children in the
study population whose oldest child had received a diagnosis
of ASD. Figure 4 shows the estimated recurrence probabilities
with 95% CIs for each of the 4 possible ordered sibling pairings.
The probability of ASD recurrence in a younger male sib-
ling with an older diagnosed female sibling was the highest of
all 4 ordered sibling pairs (16.7%; 95% CI, 15.2%-18.4%). The
next highest probability of recurrence was in a younger male
with an older diagnosed male sibling (12.9%; 95% CI, 12.2%-
13.6%). The probability of recurrence in a younger female sib-
ling with an older diagnosed female sibling was 7.6% (95% CI,
6.5%-8.9%). The lowest probability of recurrence was ob-
served for a younger female sibling with an older diagnosed
male sibling (4.2%; 95% CI, 3.8%-4.7%). All pairwise compari-
sons of these sex-specific recurrence rates indicated a statis-
tically significant difference (P < .001).
WhenafemaleormaleoldersiblinghadadiagnosisofASD,
a younger male sibling had a higher probability of an ASD di-
agnosis than a female participant. Furthermore, a female sib-
ling with an ASD diagnosis appeared to be a stronger indica-
tor of risk than a similarly diagnosed male sibling.
Discussion
Because these data were derived from insurance company–
based ICD-9 codes for a large sample population, we were able
to amass a larger data set than in most studies in ASD in which
diagnosis was determined in a clinical research setting. Thus,
this study of a population of 37 507 families with ASD is larger
than than those in several studies published in the past de-
cade and therefore enables a broad-based estimate of recur-
renceinthecontextofmedicalcare.Despitetheobviousmeth-
odological differences in ascertainment of ASD cases, the risk
of recurrence seen in these data is generally similar to esti-
mates from recently reported retrospective studies3,24 but
lower than the highest estimates found in a smaller prospec-
tive infant sibling cohort.14
Consistent with some prior studies, we found a differ-
ence in the rate of recurrence in individuals of the same sex
depending on the sex of their sibling. For families with 2 chil-
dren, the rate of recurrence of ASD in a male child was ap-
proximately 1 in 7.7 if the other sibling with ASD was male. If
the other sibling with ASD was female, the rate of recurrence
was 1 in 6, an approximately 1.3-fold higher risk of recur-
rence. These rates are consistent with a model in which fe-
malesrequireahighernumberofgeneticorenvironmentalrisk
factors to manifest ASD than do males.
This finding does not fit into a model of X-linked muta-
tions or germline mosaicism but may be consistent with mul-
tiple alleles or mutations of modest effect and a protective en-
vironment for unexplained reasons in the developing female
brain. The rate of recurrence of ASD among female children is

 7.6% if the affected sibling is female and 4.2% if male. Thus,
the risk associated with a female sibling diagnosed with ASD
is higher than that associated with a male sibling, a finding that
isinlinewithseveralgeneticmodels.Inthemultivariatemodel
of Risch et al,25 a female sibling with a previous diagnosis of
ASD was found to be associated with an increased rate of re-
currence in a male sibling, consistent with our observations.
This finding is also consistent with those of Robinson et al26
of British and Swedish twin cohorts in which siblings of fe-
male probands with ASD had significantly more autistic traits
than did siblings of male probands with ASD. Whether the fe-
male protective effect is inherent in differences in structure
of the brain and hormonal milieu or in unidentified specific
genetic variants remains a matter of continued investigation.
Regardless of the mechanism, recent studies support the hy-
pothesis that the female protective effect results in female pro-
bands having a higher mutational burden, as determined by
exome sequencing in neurodevelopmental disorders.27 There-
fore, males with a similar or lesser genetic burden acquired
through the family shared with the female proband may mani-
fest the disorder but the converse may not be true.
Although some prior studies have not described a sex as-
sociation in ASD, our data set is the largest to date to report
sex-specific recurrence rates among siblings and should be fac-
tored into genetic counseling for families in the absence of a
known explanatory cause of ASD in the family. Sandin et al3
identified a pattern of sex-specific adjusted relative risk of re-
currence for ASD that is consistent with our analysis. Al-
though that study found the difference in relative risk of re-
currencetonotbestatisticallysignificant,thesex-specificrates
of recurrence reported in our study are significantly differ-
ent. The sample size of our study enabled a high-confidence
analysis of sex-specific ASD rates of recurrence in the general
population,whichpriorstudieswereunderpoweredtodetect.3
These findings could be incorporated into screening and coun-
seling for families with no known ASD etiologic factors.

Conclusions
Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder
that is known to affect males at a higher rate than females in
the general population and to cluster in families. This study
estimated the frequency with which the disease recurred in
female and male sibling pairs and the rate of recurrence in sex-
heterogeneous families. Our findings support the hypothesis
that the disease clusters in families owing to shared genetic
or environmental factors. Our findings also support previous
observations that ASD affects males more than females even
within families. For families that have a child who has been
diagnosed with ASD, the findings of this research provide bet-
ter likelihood estimates of disease recurrence among subse-
quent offspring and may help guide counseling and support
services.
