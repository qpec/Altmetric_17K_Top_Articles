IMPORTANCE Cancer diagnosis and treatment may adversely affect reproductive outcomes
among female cancer survivors.
OBJECTIVE To compare the birth outcomes of adolescent and young adult cancer survivors
(AYA [diagnosed at ages 15-39 years]) with those of women without a cancer diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR) was
used to identify female AYA cancer survivors diagnosed from January 2000 to December
2013; CCR records were linked to statewide birth certificate files from January 2000
to December 2014 to identify postdiagnosis live births to AYA survivors (n = 2598).
A comparison cohort of births to women without a recorded cancer diagnosis was randomly
selected from birth certificate files (n = 12 990) with frequency matching on maternal age
and year of delivery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of preterm birth, low birth weight,
small-for-gestational-age births, cesarean delivery, and low Apgar score.
RESULTS Overall, 2598 births to AYA cancer survivors (mean [SD] maternal age, 31 [5] years)
were included. Births to AYA cancer survivors had a significantly increased prevalence of
preterm birth (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34-1.71), low birth weight (PR, 1.59; 95%
CI, 1.38-1.83), and cesarean delivery (PR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14) relative to the comparison
cohort of 1299. The higher prevalence of these outcomes was most concentrated among
births to women diagnosed during pregnancy. Other factors associated with preterm birth
and low birth weight included treatment with chemotherapy and a diagnosis of breast cancer,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or gynecologic cancers. The prevalence of small-for-gestational-age
births and low Apgar score (<7) did not differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Live births to AYA cancer survivors may have an increased risk
of preterm birth and low birth weight, suggesting that additional surveillance of pregnancies
in this population is warranted. Our findings may inform the reproductive counseling of
female AYA cancer survivors.

n the United States, adolescent and young adult (AYA) can-
cersaredefinedasthosediagnosedbetween15and39years
ofage.1Thoughnonuniformacrosscancersites,5-yearrela-
tivesurvivalratesofover80%havebeenestimatedfortheAYA
cancer population in the United States.2,3 With continued im-
provements in early diagnosis and treatment,3 a growing num-
ber of AYA patients with cancer will become long-term survi-
vors, prompting concerns about the late effects of malignancy
and treatment in this population.
For the more than 45 000 US women diagnosed with AYA
cancers each year,4 such concerns may include future fertil-
ity and reproductive outcomes. Though recent studies5,6 sug-
gest that 60% of female AYA cancer survivors want the possi-
bility of having children, there is currently limited information
available regarding the potential risk of adverse birth out-
comes in this population. Studies of births to childhood can-
cersurvivors(diagnosedatages0-14years)intheUnitedStates
suggest an increased risk of outcomes such as preterm birth
and low birth weight relative to the general population.7,8 Yet
little research has focused specifically on birth outcomes
among AYA cancer survivors, who were diagnosed and treated
during childbearing years and thus may have a risk profile dis-
tinct from that of survivors diagnosed during childhood. Stud-
ies from Australia9 and Europe10-13 have documented an in-
crease in adverse birth outcomes among survivors diagnosed
with cancer during reproductive years. However, given poten-
tial differences in the racial and ethnic makeup of these coun-
tries, as well as in the prevalence of other risk factors, it is un-
clear whether AYA cancer survivors in the United States have
similarly elevated risks. Furthermore, few studies have exam-
ined whether various treatment modalities, such as radiation
therapy and chemotherapy, are associated with adverse birth
outcomes among births to AYA cancer survivors.9
In the current study, we used a data linkage between the
North Carolina Central Cancer Registry and state birth certifi-
cate files to compare selected birth outcomes of female AYA
cancer survivors to those of women without a history of can-
cer. We also evaluated risks of adverse birth outcomes accord-
ing to factors such as cancer site group, treatment type, and
the interval between diagnosis and birth.
Methods
Data Sources
To identify AYA cancer survivors, we used data from the North
Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR). As required by state
law, all cancer cases and benign brain and/or central nervous
system tumors diagnosed in North Carolina are reported to the
CCR by health care providers. We identified all women diag-
nosed with an incident cancer at ages 15 to 39 years from Janu-
ary 2000 to December 2013. Information recorded in the CCR
includescancersite,stage,dateofdiagnosis,andprimarytreat-
ments (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). We defined can-
cer site groupings for commonly diagnosed AYA cancers
(breast, melanoma/skin carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and gynecologic) using AYA-
specific recodes of International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O-3) definitions, available from the National In-
stitutes of Health Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Re-
sults Program (eTable 1 in the Supplement).14
Live births occurring in North Carolina from January 2000
to December 2014 were identified using statewide vital rec-
ords. Data abstracted from birth certificates included birth
weight, gestational age, infant sex, mode of delivery, plural
birth, and Apgar score (a measure of the physiologic condi-
tion of the newborn).15 Gestational age recorded on birth cer-
tificates may be determined from the motherâ€™
s self-reported
last menstrual period, from ultrasound findings, or other peri-
natal factors.16 Maternal characteristics, including race/
ethnicity, parity, smoking during pregnancy, education, and
marital status, were also abstracted from birth certificates.
To identify births to AYA cancer survivors, data from the
CCR and birth certificate files were linked using a probabilis-
tic linkage strategy in Link Plus.17 Variables used in the link-
age included maternal name, date of birth, and social secu-
rity number. Estimates of reliability for variables used in the
linkage, ranging from 0% (totally unreliable) to 100% (com-
pletely reliable), were 98%, 96%, 97%, 96%, and 96% for so-
cial security number, date of birth, last name, first name, and
middle name, respectively.
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of the University of North Carolina and by the North Carolina
StateCenterforHealthStatistics;patientwritteninformedcon-
sent was not required for the analysis of existing, deidenti-
fied records.
Selection of Study Population
From the CCR, we identified 21 716 women with a cancer di-
agnosis between ages 15 and 39 years from January 2000 to
December 2013. By linking with state birth certificate files, we
found that 8529 of these women had a total of 14 132 live births
from January 2000 to December 2014. We excluded births to
women with nonmalignant diagnoses and to women whose
recorded diagnosis was not their first or only cancer (n = 1857
births). We excluded births that occurred before diagnosis
(n = 8622) and those missing infant date of birth (n = 53). To
Key Points
Question Are adverse birth outcomes more prevalent among
births to adolescent and young adult (AYA, diagnosed at ages
15-39 years) cancer survivors than among births to women
without a recorded cancer diagnosis?
Findings This case-control cohort study used a data linkage
between the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry and statewide
birth certificate files to identify births to AYA cancer survivors, and
a comparison cohort of births to women without a recorded
cancer diagnosis randomly selected from birth certificate files. The
results suggest an excess risk of preterm birth and low birth
weight among births to AYA cancer survivors.
Meaning These findings may inform the preconception and
prenatal counseling of AYA cancer survivors and suggest the need
for additional surveillance of pregnancies in this population.

focus our analyses on births closest to the motherâ€™
s cancer di-
agnosis and treatment, we included only the first postdiagno-
sis birth to each cancer survivor that occurred from January
2000 to December 2014, excluding second or later births that
also occurred during this time period (n = 924). We further ex-
cluded multiple births (n = 72) and those with fewer than 20
weeks gestation or a birthweight less than 500 g (n = 6). Thus,
final analyses included 2598 births to AYA cancer survivors.
In North Carolina from January 2000 to December 2014, a
total of 1 846 939 births occurred to 1 369 916 women without
a recorded cancer diagnosis. After excluding second or later

survivor.Birthswerefrequencymatchedonyearofdeliveryand

births to women without a recorded cancer diagnosis.
Outcomes
Outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW),
small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, a 5-minute Apgar score
less than 7, and cesarean delivery. Low birth weight was de-
fined as less than 2500 g. We evaluated preterm birth before
37 weeks gestation and before 34 weeks gestation, to distin-
guish early preterm and late preterm. National standards for
US births, published by Oken et al,18 were used to determine
SGA, defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile of in-
fants of the same sex and gestational age.
Statistical Analyses
Poissonregressionmodelswithrobusterrorvariance19wereused
to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) for all birth outcomes, com-
paring births to AYA cancer survivors with the comparison co-
hort. All regression models were adjusted for variables consid-
eredaprioriaspotentialconfounders:yearofbirth(2000-2003,
2004-2006, 2007-2009, 2011-2012, 2013-2014), maternal age
(<24,25-29,30-34,â‰¥35years),race/ethnicity(non-Hispanicwhite,
non-Hispanic black, other), maternal education (high school or
less, some college, Bachelorâ€™
s degree or higher), previous live
births(0,1,2,â‰¥3),maritalstatus(married,notmarried),andma-
ternal smoking during pregnancy (any, none). Because mater-
nal education and smoking during pregnancy were missing for
allbirthsin2010,duetoachangeintheformatoftheNorthCaro-
linabirthcertificatethatoccurredthatyear,thesebirthswerenec-
essarily excluded from multivariable models for all outcomes.
Cesarean deliveries were also missing for 2010 births.
We conducted further analyses stratified by cancer site
group, treatment (radiation and/or chemotherapy), time be-
tween diagnosis and birth, and age at diagnosis. In analyses
stratified by time between diagnosis and birth, we assumed
that a motherâ€™
s cancer diagnosis occurred during pregnancy
if the infantâ€™
s gestational age was longer than the interval be-
tween the motherâ€™
s diagnosis and the infantâ€™
s date of birth. We
also evaluated risks associated with chemotherapy and/or ra-
diation within cancer site groups.
Within the AYA survivor group, we then evaluated risks as-
sociated with chemotherapy and/or radiation compared with
those who received surgery only. Births to gynecologic can-
cer survivors were excluded from these analyses owing to po-
tential associations between gynecologic surgery and ad-
verse birth outcomes.20
To address whether preterm birth was related to medical
intervention,ratherthanspontaneouslabor,weperformedsen-
sitivity analyses excluding all cesarean deliveries (844 births
to AYA cancer survivors; 3907 births to comparison cohort).
We then excluded both cesarean deliveries and induced labor
(1323 births to AYA cancer survivors; 5903 births to compari-
son cohort). All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute).

of births that were preterm (overall preterm, <37 weeks; early
preterm, <34 weeks), low birth weight, or cesarean delivery

Among the 2598 AYA cancer survivors with an included

cologic cancers (n = 129 [5%]), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(n = 110 [4%]) (Table 2). Other diagnoses frequently included
melanoma in situ (n = 258 [10%]), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 69

or chemotherapy (n = 646 [25%]).
Overall, preterm birth (PR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34-1.71), early
preterm birth (PR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.62-2.55), and LBW (PR, 1.59;
95% CI, 1.38-1.83) were increased among births to AYA cancer
survivors relative to the comparison cohort (Table 3). A small
but statistically significant increase in cesarean deliveries was
also identified among survivors. The prevalence of SGA and
low Apgar score did not differ between groups.
In analyses stratified by cancer site group, the prevalence
of preterm birth was elevated among births to women diag-
nosed with breast cancer (PR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), Hodg-

women diagnosed with cancer before the start of pregnancy.
Overall, births to women treated with chemotherapy with-
out radiation, were more likely to be preterm (PR, 2.11; 95% CI,

more common among births to breast cancer survivors who
were treated with chemotherapy without radiation (eTable 2

tions in preterm birth (PR, 6.03; 95% CI, 3.13-11.63) and LBW
(PR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.88-11.06) were observed among births to

tive to the comparison cohort.
Discussion
In this population-based study, we found an increased preva-
lence of preterm birth and LBW among births to female sur-
vivors of AYA cancer compared with the general population.
A slight increase in cesarean deliveries was also observed
among births to survivors of AYA cancers. The higher preva-
lence of these outcomes was most pronounced among births
to mothers diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy, with a
more modest increase among those with a longer interval be-
tween diagnosis and birth. Elevations in preterm birth per-
sisted when cesarean deliveries and/or induced labor were ex-
cluded, suggesting an increase in spontaneous preterm
deliveries among AYA cancer survivors. Overall, the preva-
lence of other adverse birth outcomes, including SGA and low
Apgar score, did not differ significantly between births of sur-
vivors and those of the comparison cohort.

Our findings regarding preterm birth and LBW are in line
withthoseofrecentstudiesbasedoutsidetheUnitedStates.9-12
In a study of births to AYA cancer survivors diagnosed in West-
ern Australia between 1982 and 2007, Haggar et al9 reported
comparable increases in preterm birth (relative risk [RR], 1.68;
95% CI, 1.23-2.12) and LBW (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.23-2.12) com-
pared with women without a previous cancer diagnosis.9 As
in the current study, the first completed postdiagnosis preg-
nancy was included, regardless of the interval between diag-
nosis and birth. Other non-US studies with similar inclusion
criteria have observed a similarly elevated prevalence of these
outcomesamongfemalecancersurvivorsdiagnosedduringre-
productive years.10,12 In our study, the large sample size al-
lowed us to stratify by the length of time between a womanâ€™
s
cancer diagnosis and her first postdiagnosis birth. Our results
suggestthattheincreasedprevalenceofpretermbirthandLBW
may be most concentrated among births to AYA cancer survi-
vors diagnosed during pregnancy, some of whom may de-
liver early to begin treatment. However, modest though sig-
nificant elevations in preterm birth and LBW remained among
births to women diagnosed before pregnancy, indicating that
the elevated prevalence of these outcomes may not be lim-
ited to births to women diagnosed during pregnancy.
Long-term effects of cancer treatment are a possible ex-
planation for these findings. In all cancer site groups com-
bined,bothpretermbirthandLBWweremorecommonamong
birthstowomentreatedwithchemotherapy.Thismaybepartly
explained by cardiovascular or pulmonary impairments due
to chemotherapy, which may impact blood volume regula-
tion and adversely affect pregnancy outcomes.21,22 Treat-
ment with radiation, in the absence of chemotherapy, did not

ings contrast with those of Haggar et al,9 in which the stron-
gest associations with preterm birth and LBW among AYA

survivors were observed for treatment with radiation alone.
This may be attributable to differences in site group makeup
between study populations, as our results also suggest poten-
tial differences in treatment effects according to cancer site.
Inoursample,treatmentwithchemotherapywasmoststrongly
associatedwithpretermbirthandLBWamongbirthstowomen
diagnosed with breast cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Sur-
gical treatment among gynecologic cancer survivors ap-
peared to be associated with an increase in both preterm birth
and LBW, as did treatment with radiation among survivors of
Hodgkin lymphoma. However, these findings were based on
small numbers of outcomes, and further investigation is war-
ranted to assess treatment effects within site groups.
AlthoughLBWwasincreasedamongAYAsurvivors,weob-
served little difference in the prevalence of SGA relative to the
comparison cohort. This is consistent with findings of prior
studies among childhood and AYA cancer survivors.7,8,11,13
Births to AYA survivors that met the criteria for LBW (<2500
g) were generally not small enough to fall below the 10th per-
centile for their gestational age, suggesting that the increase
in LBW may be largely driven by shorter gestation relative to
the comparison cohort.
Limitations
StrengthsofthisstudyincludethelargesampleofbirthstoAYA
cancersurvivorsandtheavailabilityofindividualtreatmentin-
formation. Some limitations should also be considered. Infor-
mation regarding childbearing intent and the number and tim-
ing of attempts of parenthood was not available for this study.
Additionally,misclassificationmayoccurinadministrativedata
sources such as birth certificates and cancer registries. For ex-
ample, gestational age recorded on birth certificates is usually
estimated from the motherâ€™
s self-reported last menstrual pe-
riod, and may therefore be subject to some inaccuracy. How-
ever, validation studies have demonstrated high reliability for
birth outcome variables on US birth certificates,23-27 including
those in North Carolina.23,25 Furthermore, we lacked informa-
tiononwomenwhomovedoutofthestateduringthestudype-
riod. North Carolina census data for 2000 through 2010, only
7% of women overall moved out of state.28 Thus, even if out-
comes differed among women who moved out of North Caro-
lina, we expect the influence on our estimates would be small.
Furthermore, the number of outcomes was small within some
subgroups; thus, we had limited statistical power to detect sig-
nificant differences in some stratified analyses.

Conclusions
Overall, our results suggest an increased risk of preterm birth
and LBW among births to AYA cancer survivors. Treatment
with chemotherapy may be associated with increases in
these outcomes. Our findings may inform the preconception
and prenatal counseling of AYA cancer survivors and suggest
the need for additional surveillance of pregnancies in this
population.
