SUMMARY
Cardiomyocytes (CMs) generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are under investigation for their suitability as hu-
man models in preclinical drug development. Antiarrhythmic drug development focuses on atrial biology for the treatment of atrial fibril-
lation. Here we used recent retinoic acid-based protocols to generate atrial CMs from hiPSCs and establish right atrial engineered heart
tissue (RA-EHT) as a 3D model of human atrium. EHT from standard protocol-derived hiPSC-CMs (Ctrl-EHT) and intact human muscle
strips served as comparators. RA-EHT exhibited higher mRNA and protein concentrations of atrial-selective markers, faster contraction
kinetics, lower force generation, shorter action potential duration, and higher repolarization fraction than Ctrl-EHTs. In addition, RA-
EHTs but not Ctrl-EHTs responded to pharmacological manipulation of atrial-selective potassium currents. RA- and Ctrl-EHTs’ behavior
reflected differences between human atrial and ventricular muscle preparations. Taken together, RA-EHT is a model of human atrium that
may be useful in preclinical drug screening.
INTRODUCTION
More than 33 million people worldwide suffer from atrial
fibrillation (AF), with increasing prevalence (Chugh et al.,
2014). Uncoordinated high-frequency contractions in the
atria lead to atrial stunning, increasing the risk for blood
clots, stroke, and heart failure (Marini et al., 2005; Wang
et al., 2003). Pulmonary vein isolation by catheter ablation
and antiarrhythmic drugs represent two treatment op-
tions. While ablation is not always effective, particularly
in advanced forms of the disease, the available antiar-
rhythmic drugs have limited efficacy and cause adverse ef-
fects (Schotten et al., 2011).
Drug development is hampered by the difficulty in
isolating and maintaining human atrial cardiomyocytes
(CMs). Animal models do not accurately represent the
physiology of human CMs, limiting their predictive power
(Denayer et al., 2014). CMs generated from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may offer a platform to
study disease mechanism and evaluate novel drugs. How-
ever, hiPSC-CMs are believed to consist predominantly of
ventricular-like cells with a small percentage of atrial-like
and nodal-like cells (van den Berg et al., 2016; Blazeski
et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Marczenke et al., 2017). Recent
developments therefore aim at establishing hiPSC-derived
models of predominantly atrial-like myocytes.
Retinoids regulate heart morphogenesis and contribute
to cardiac reprograming. Specification of cardiac progeni-
tors can be altered by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment
(Zaffran et al., 2014). Previous studies have shown that
treatment of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and
hiPSC differentiation cultures with RA is sufficient to
generate cells that display electrophysiological properties
and gene expression patterns characteristic of early atrial-
like myocytes (Chen et al., 2017; Cyganek et al., 2018; De-
valla et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Josowitz et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2011).
The current study was conducted to evaluate the suit-
ability of hiPSC-derived atrial-like myocytes in engineered
heart tissue (EHT) format (Mannhardt et al., 2016). This
system offers a more physiological cell environment and
allows the monitoring of the major parameters of heart
function: force, pacemaking activity, contraction and
relaxation kinetics (Hansen et al., 2010; Mannhardt et al.,
2016), as well as standard cardiac electrophysiology (Le-
moine et al., 2017).
RESULTS
RA Treatment Decreases Cell Size
We used RA to induce an atrial phenotype in hiPSC-CMs.
HiPSC-CMs were differentiated following an established
three-step protocol (Breckwoldt et al., 2017, Figure 1A).
RA treatment (1 mmol/L) between day 4 and day 7 after
mesodermal induction did not significantly alter the

 percentage of cardiac troponin T (cTnT)-positive cells (Fig-
ures 1B and S1), indicating no effect on principal cardiac
differentiation efficiency. However, cell area as a surrogate
of cell size was smaller in RA-treated cells (Figure 1C). While
substantial overlap was noted between RA-treated and con-
trol hiPSC-CMs, mean values were significantly smaller in
RA (1736 ± 64 mm2 versus 2469 ± 192 mm2, n = 209 and
88; p < 0.05, unpaired t test).
Cell size was also estimated as the volume of a perfect
sphere using flow volumetry analysis (Mosqueira et al.,
2018) (Figure 1D) after hiPSC-CM differentiation and after
14 days of EHT culture. Volume of RA-treated cells was
smaller than control (Ctrl) cells (560 ± 1.3 mm3 versus
588 ± 1.6 mm3, n = 26,508 and 21,577; p < 0.05, unpaired
t test), reflecting the smaller size of native atrial compared
with ventricular CMs, although at an overall lower level
(Bensley et al., 2016; Claycomb et al., 1989). After
14 days of EHT culture, the difference in volume of RA-
treated cells versus Ctrl cells increased, due to an increase
in size in Ctrl-EHTs (569 ± 3 mm3 versus 854 ± 2.8 mm3,
n = 15,474 and 20,931; p < 0.05, unpaired t test).
RA Treatment Increases Gene Expression and Protein
Level of Atrial-Specific Markers
Several proteins are differentially expressed between atrial
and ventricular myocardium and can therefore be used as
discriminators (Ellinghaus et al., 2005; Gaborit et al.,
2007; Wobus et al., 1995) (Table S1). We used RT-qPCR to
quantify transcript concentrations of the corresponding
genes in monolayer cultures (MLs) and EHTs. House-
keeping genes GUSB and CTNT did not differ between
Ctrl-MLs
and
Ctrl-EHTs.

and MLC2V (for full gene names see Table S1), whereas

and

channels
(KCNJ3,

 In six out of ten atrial genes, RA-induced increase in expres-
sion was larger in EHTs than in MLs (Figure 2A), suggesting
a further atrial specification in a 3D model of auxotonically
beating EHT. The higher mRNA expression of MLC2A, ANP,
PITX2, and COUPTFII in RA-MLs compared with Ctrl-MLs
was confirmed on the protein level (Figures 2B, S2, and
S4). These data suggest that RA induces atrial specification
in hiPSC-CMs.
RA Treatment Reduces the Number of MLC2V+ and
Increases that of MLC2A+ Cells
EHTs were casted from Ctrl- and RA-treated hiPSC-CMs
with a percentage of cTnT+ cells between 75% and 95%.
EHT generation from Ctrl- and RA-treated hiPSC-CMs was
highly reproducible with more than 90% of EHTs forming
functional contracting tissues. RA-EHTs showed slower
development than Ctrl-EHTs, indicated by a later onset of
spontaneous beating. At steady state (�day 20), the resting
length of RA-EHTs was higher than for Ctrl-EHTs (5.4 ±
0.07 mm versus 5.0 ± 0.16 mm; p < 0.05, unpaired t test;
Figure S5). Ctrl- and RA-EHTs showed a dense network of
a-actinin-positive myocytes (Figure S6B). CMs in EHTs
showed predominant longitudinal orientation along force
lines and well-developed sarcomeric organization (Figures
S6A and S6B). Dystrophin staining of CMs in cross sections
(Figure S6C) showed that the majority of the cells in EHTs
were concentrated in the outer layers near the surface.
This observation has been made previously (Hirt et al.,
2014; Vollert et al., 2013) and is likely due to better nutrient
and oxygen supply and the stronger force lines at the edges.
Ctrl- and RA-EHTs could be easily distinguished by the
different expression of myosin light chain isoforms. RA-
treated CMs gave rise to MLs and EHTs characterized by a
high fraction of MLC2A+ cells and low fraction of
MLC2V+ cells, while Ctrl MLs and EHTs displayed the
opposite distribution (Figure 3). Human adult heart tissues
showed almost exclusive expression of MLC2A in speci-
mens from right atrial appendages (RAAs) and of MLC2V
in specimens from left ventricles (LVs) (Figure 3B).
These findings support the conclusion that RA signaling

 promotes the development of atrial-like myocytes at the
expense of the ventricular phenotype.
RA Treatment Increases Beating Frequency and Speeds
up Contraction Kinetics
EHTs beat faster than MLs, independently of the presence
or absence of RA during differentiation. RA treatment
significantly increased beating frequency in both culture
formats (Figure 4), but its effect compared with Ctrl proto-
col was larger in EHTs than in MLs (increase by 61% ± 4%
versus 28% ± 2%; p < 0.05, unpaired t test). Force was
lower in EHTs from RA-treated hiPSC-CMs (RA-EHTs)
than those from Ctrl-EHTs (Figure 4B). Contraction ampli-
tudes as calculated by the MUSCLEMOTION algorithm
(Sala et al., 2018) are arbitrary measures that cannot be
used to distinguish absolute level of ML contractility.
Ctrl-EHTs showed an overall inverse force-frequency rela-
tionship between 1.7 and 4.7 Hz. RA-EHTs showed a flat
relation between 2.1 and 2.9 Hz and then a similarly in-
verse force-frequency relationship up to 5.9 Hz (Fig-
ure S7A). Since contraction kinetics are faster in RAA
than LV (Berk et al., 2016; Molenaar et al., 2013), we
analyzed time to peak (TTP) and relaxation time (RT). RA
treatment accelerated contraction kinetics in both ML
and EHT culture conditions (Figures 4A and 4B, Videos
S1 and S2). To rule out that differences in contraction ki-
netics were the consequence of different spontaneous
beating frequencies, kinetics were also analyzed under fre-
quency Ctrl (3 Hz). Under these conditions, TTP and RT
were 80 ± 0.65 ms and 117 ± 1.8 ms for RA-EHTs (n = 6)
and 110 ± 1.3 ms and 123 ± 2.5 ms for Ctrl-EHTs
(n = 5), respectively. Thus, the observed differences be-
tween RA- and Ctrl-EHTs were not due to differences in
baseline frequency.
These functional data show that RA treatment changes
contractility pattern toward an atrial-like phenotype.
RA Treatment Reduces Action Potential Duration at
90% Repolarization and Increases Repolarization
Fraction
We next evaluated whether atrial-like expression of
marker proteins was associated with typical atrial-like ac-
tion potential (AP) shape (Figure 5). We used two recently
proposed parameters, AP duration (APD) at 90% repolari-
zation (APD90) and repolarization fraction calculated as
(APD90 � APD50)/APD90 to distinguish between atrial

similar areas of evenly distributed CM network throughout the diameter of EHTs while generally the majority of the cells are located at the
outer layer of the EHT (Figure S6C; Hirt et al., 2014; Vollert et al., 2013).

 and ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs (Du et al., 2015). APs
were recorded by voltage-sensitive dyes from MLs and
by sharp microelectrodes from EHT, RAA, and LV samples.
In accordance with a previous report (Lemoine et al.,
2018), APD90 was shorter in Ctrl-EHTs than in LV.
APD90 was significantly shorter in RA-MLs and RA-EHTs
than in Ctrl-MLs and Ctrl-EHTs, respectively (126 ±
10 ms versus 206 ± 24 ms, n = 70/140 in ML and 166 ±
2 ms versus 243 ± 2 ms, n = 90/157 in EHT; p < 0.05, un-
paired t test). Repolarization fraction, known to be higher
in RAA than in LV and perfectly discriminating between
the regions (Horva
´th et al., 2018), was higher in RA-
MLs and RA-EHTs than in Ctrl-MLs and Ctrl-EHTs, respec-
tively (0.28 ± 0.003 versus 0.15 ± 0.002, n = 70/140 in
MLs and 0.41 ± 0.005 versus 0.24 ± 0.002, n = 90/157
in EHTs; p < 0.05, unpaired t test) with no overlap be-
tween the groups (Figures 5 and S7B). These findings indi-
cate a more atrial-like electrophysiological phenotype
induced by RA treatment.
RA Treatment Induces Muscarinic Responsiveness of
APD
The acetylcholine-activated potassium current IK,ACh is a
hallmark of atrial CMs. Its activation by carbachol (CCh)
is expected to shorten APD. Based on earlier experiments
in human adult cardiac tissues (Dobrev et al., 2001), we ex-
pected maximum effects of CCh on AP recordings 2 min af-
ter drug exposure. CCh did not have an effect on the APD
of LV, but shortened APD90 in RAA from 314 ± 14 ms to
174 ± 15 ms (n = 10; p < 0.05, paired t test) (Figure 6B). In
Figure 4. Effect of RA Treatment on Beating Rate and Contraction Kinetics

batches) showed faster kinetic parameters (TTP and RT) and faster spontaneous beating compared with Ctrl-MLs (n = 12 wells from two
batches).
(B) Effects on EHTs: average contraction peaks were calculated from six different EHTs. RA-EHTs (n = 17 from three batches) showed faster
contraction kinetics, faster spontaneous beating, and smaller force compared with Ctrl-EHTs (n = 10 from three batches). All average
contraction peaks were normalized. Y axes differ between MLs and EHTs to better visualize the effect of RA.
Error bars show means ± SEM.
1382
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 11 j 1378–1390 j December 11, 2018
 accordance with these data on human heart muscles, CCh
reduced APD90 of RA-EHT from 221 ± 2.4 to 183 ± 9.4 ms
and it did not affect APD90 in Ctrl-EHT (Figure 6A). As
seen for the resting membrane potential (RMP) in RAA,
CCh evoked hyperpolarization of the take-off potential
(TOP) in RA-EHTs (from �69.3 ± 3 mV to �73.7 ± 2.8
mV) but not in Ctrl-EHT (Figure 6A).
RA Treatment Makes AP Sensitive to the IKur Blocker
4-Aminopyridine
In human heart, the ultrarapidly activating delayed
rectifier K+ current (IKur) is another current predominantly
expressed in the atria. We therefore measured the contribu-
tion of IKur to APs using low concentrations of 4-aminopyr-
idine (4-AP; 50 mmol/L) to block IKur. In RAA, 4-AP
prolonged APD20 and shortened APD90 by 194% and
11.2%, respectively, while it had no effect on LV even at a
concentration of 1 mmol/L (Figure 7B) (Wettwer et al.,
1994, 2004). In RA-EHTs, 4-AP significantly prolonged
APD20 (from 31.1 ± 0.14 ms to 44.4 ± 0.82 ms) and AP
amplitude (APA), but, in contrast to RAA, did not shorten
APD90 (Figure S7F). 4-AP had no effect in Ctrl-EHTs (Fig-
ure 7A). Prolongation of APD20 by 4-AP in RA-EHT but
not in Ctrl-EHTs indicates induction of the atrial-selective
potassium current IKur by RA.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to generate a 3D model of hu-
man atrial heart muscle. We used recently established
RA-based protocols to differentiate atrial-like cells from
hiPSCs and used our fibrin-based EHT technique to cast
3D muscle strips that were directly compared with native
human heart muscles. The findings show that atrial-like
RA-treated
hiPSC-CMs
readily
form
spontaneously
beating EHTs that, compared with standard EHT, show
increased contraction and relaxation velocity, higher
repolarization fraction, and pharmacological responses
to a muscarinic agonist and an IKur blocker, characteristic
features of atrial heart muscle. The data thus show that
addition of RA during hiPSC-CM differentiation not only
induces an atrial-like pattern of gene expression but trans-
lates into functional properties typically seen in human
atrial tissue.
Effect of RA on Atrial-Specific Gene Expression is
Larger in EHTs Than in MLs
Several recent studies showed that the presence of RA
during hiPSC and hESC differentiation upregulates atrial
transcripts such as COUPTFI, COUPTFII, PITX2, SLN, ANP,
and MLC2A along with a downregulation of ventricular

 transcripts such as IRX4 and MLC2V (Chen et al., 2017;
Cyganek et al., 2018; Devalla et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017;
Josowitz et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011).
To further characterize the functional phenotype of these
cells, we used the EHT technique that improves hiPSC-
CM and hESC-CM maturation (Besser et al., 2018; Fong
et al., 2016; Mannhardt et al., 2016; Nunes et al., 2013;
Ulmer et al., 2018; Uzun et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2013)
and allows direct measurements of force under loaded,
steady-state conditions and AP with sharp microelectrodes
(Lemoine et al., 2017). An interesting finding was that the
differences between Ctrl and RA-treated hiPSC-CMs on
gene expression persisted in EHT and were even stronger
in EHTs than in MLs in more than 50% of genes
(Figure 2). Similarly, the predominance of MLC2V+ cells
in Ctrl-treated and of MLC2A+ cells in RA-treated hiPSC-
CMs was more pronounced in EHTs than in MLs and
approached the almost black-and-white difference in
native human ventricular and atrial heart muscles (Fig-
ure 3). Thus, the data suggest further specification of cham-
ber-specific characteristics in the 3D EHT format.
RA-EHTs Show Atrial Contraction Pattern
Literature values of contractile force per cross-sectional area
for human EHTs range between <0.1 and >20 mN/mm2.
Absolute values, in contrast, range only between 0.08 and
1.5 mN for human EHTs, indicating the relevance of
construct diameter for relative force development (Wein-
berger et al., 2017). In contrast, forces of intact heart mus-
cles can reach 40 to 80 mN/mm2 (Van Der Velden et al.,
1998). The lower forces in EHTs can be mainly explained
by lower cardiac myocyte density, lower sarcomere volume
fraction, and the overall lower level of cardiac myocyte dif-
ferentiation (Hirt et al., 2014; Weinberger et al., 2017).
Atrial-specific myosin has a higher cross-bridge cycling
rate than ventricular-specific myosin. Since force of a mus-
cle inversely depends on cross-bridge kinetics, tension gen-
eration and Ca2+ sensitivity of atrial fibers are lower than
those of ventricular fibers (Morano et al., 1991). In fact, iso-
metric force of ventricular skinned fibers from adult human
heart revealed two times higher force generation per cross
section and a higher Ca2+ sensitivity than atrial skinned fi-
bers (Ruf et al., 1998; Ng et al., 2010; Piroddi et al., 2007). In

given before and 2 min after CCh exposure. AP traces were recorded at 37�C with 2 Hz pacing for EHTs obtained from ERC18 cell line. LV and

1384
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 11 j 1378–1390 j December 11, 2018
 line with this finding, Ctrl-EHTs developed two times
higher force than RA-EHTs (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, both the rate of active tension generation
and relaxation are faster in atrial than in ventricular myofi-
brils and this is believed to be related to cross-bridge
kinetics (Ng et al., 2010; Piroddi et al., 2007). Atrial and
ventricular CMs express predominantly atrial light chain-1
and ventricular light chain-1, respectively. Atrial light
chain-1 has faster cross-bridge kinetics than ventricular
light chain-1 (Lowey et al., 1993; Morano et al., 1996; Ng
et al., 2010). When contracting isometrically, human atrial
myocardium exhibited almost two times higher maximum
shortening velocity than ventricular myocardium (Berk
et al., 2016; Molenaar et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2010). In the
present study, RA-EHTs showed 35% shorter RT50% and
47% shorter TTP�50% than Ctrl-EHTs, nicely fitting the
smaller RT and TTP in human atrial tissue compared with
ventricular heart muscle. Qualitatively similar differences
were observed by evaluating contractile activity of ML
cultured cells by MUSCLEMOTION, but, again, differences
between RA and Ctrl were smaller than in EHT (Figure 4).
The differences in contractility between RA-EHTs and
Ctrl-EHTs may be causally related to the different expres-
sion of cardiac myosin light chain isoforms (Figure 3) and
to the different sarcomere organization within the EHT
(Figure S6A).
RA-EHTs Show Atrial-like AP Parameters
Native atrial and ventricular tissues do not show automa-
ticity. Thus, the spontaneous beating of both RA- and
Ctrl-EHTs is a peculiarity of the in vitro culture that is well
known for all hiPSC-CM models but still not completely
understood. Accordingly, the higher beating rate in RA-
EHTs compared with Ctrl-EHTs is hard to interpret. RA
treatment had a clear impact on AP parameters. RA-EHTs
had a less negative TOP than Ctrl-EHTs (�70 ± 1.1 mV
versus �76 ± 1.5 mV, Figure S7C), which qualitatively re-
sembles the difference of RMP in human cardiac tissue
(�78.5 ± 1.0 mV in LVand �74.0 ± 0.5 mV in RAA) (Burash-
nikov et al., 2008). The relatively large difference could
underlie the lower upstroke velocity in RA-EHTs than
in Ctrl-EHTs (97.6 ± 2.4 V/s versus 207.6 ± 10.6 V/s,

before and 15 min after 4-AP exposure. AP recordings were obtained at 37�C with 2 Hz pacing for Ctrl-EHTs and 4 Hz pacing for RA-EHTs. LV
and RAA APs were field stimulated at 1 Hz. Y axes differ between EHT and human adult cardiac tissues to better visualize the effect of 4-AP.

 Figure S7C), because TOP is in the steep region of the
steady-state inactivation curve where small changes in
TOP can have large effects on sodium channel availability
and subsequently upstroke velocity (Lemoine et al., 2017;
Skibsbye et al., 2016).
As seen before, APD90 in EHTs from hiPSC-CMs was
shorter than in adult human cardiac tissue (Horva
´th
et al., 2018). Nevertheless, RA treatment of hiPSC-CMs
further shortened APD90 (Figure 5). The difference between
RA and Ctrl was larger than the difference between RAA
and LV. Since refractoriness depends strictly on membrane
voltage and therefore on APD90, the short AP in RA-EHTs
could facilitate tachyarrhythmias, which may come as an
advantage for future drug testing purposes.
Repolarization fraction is known to better discriminate
atrial versus ventricular APs than the absolute values of
APD90 (Du et al., 2015; Horva
´th et al., 2018). We observed
the same in the present study. As seen in RAA versus LV
before (Horva
´th et al., 2018), repolarization fraction did
not overlap between RA-EHT and Ctrl-EHT, suggesting a
strong effect of RA to induce an atrial-like repolarization
pattern. However, we never saw the very rapid initial repo-
larization leading to a pronounced spike and dome phe-
nomenon typical for human RAA. The shape of RA-EHT
APs resembled APs recorded from patients with persistent
AF and a loss of the steep initial repolarization. This finding
could suggest a low contribution of transient potassium
outward currents as Ito and IKur.
RA-EHTs Respond to Atrial-Selective Drugs
Ion channels Kv1.5 and Kir3.1, encoded by KCNA5 and
KCNJ3, respectively, conduct the potassium currents IKur
and IK,ACh, which are major determinants of electrophysio-
logical differences between atrial and ventricular CMs
(Ravens et al., 2013). Here we have used CCh to identify
IK,ACh. Both RA-EHTs and Ctrl-EHTs decreased beating rate
upon CCh exposure (Figure S7D). However, this finding
cannot be taken as a proof for IK,ACh, since activation
of
muscarinic
receptors
also
effectively
decreases
If
(DiFrancesco et al., 1989). On the other hand, APD short-
ening upon muscarinic receptor activation should allow
clear IK,Ach identification. The absence of CCh-induced
APD shortening in Ctrl-EHTs is in line with the absence of
IK,ACh in cells isolated from Ctrl-EHTs (Horva
´th et al.,
2018). In contrast, CCh-induced APD shortening in RA-
EHTs is an indication of an atrial-like phenotype. The effect
of CCh was tested on Ctrl- and RA-EHTs obtained from
another Ctrl cell line, ERC18. This cell line showed lower
baseline beating frequency than C25 (2 Hz versus 3 Hz).
Given that the effect of CCh on APD90 shows a reversed
rate-dependency (i.e., decreases at higher frequency) (Fig-
ure S7E), we expected a larger effect in ERC18 (Figure S3).
Indeed, CCh shortened APD90 in RA-EHTs by 20% in
ERC18 compared with 7% in C25. The effect was still smaller
than the 50% shortening in RAA (Figure 6), likely due to the
lower current amplitude of IK,Ach in RA-EHTs (Figure 6).
IKur is another atrial-selective potassium current recently
employed to identify atrial-like repolarization pattern. The
recently developed selective IKur blocker Xention D-0101
was effective in RA-treated but not in Ctrl hESC (Devalla
et al., 2015; Ford et al., 2013). Since this compound was
not
available,
we
used
4-AP
at
low
concentration
(50 mmol/L). Even when we used high concentrations
(1 mmol/L) of 4-AP, we could not detect an effect in LV.
This finding may be due to the use of subendocardial prep-
arations from patients with heart failure showing very low
Ito amplitudes (Wettwer et al., 1994). At 50 mmol/L, 4-AP re-
sembles the effects of selective IKur block by D-0101 in RAA;
that is, prolongation of APD20 but shortening of APD90
(Ford et al., 2013; Wettwer et al., 2004). We confirmed
this effect in RAA (Figure 7B). In RA-EHTs, 4-AP (50 mmol/L)
induced the expected prolongation of APD20 but did not
shorten APD90. The shortening of APD90 by low concentra-
tion of 4-AP in RAA results from stronger activation of IKr by
a more positive plateau voltage induced by the prolonga-
tion of APD20 (Wettwer et al., 2004). Maybe the absence
of a clear plateau phase in RA-EHTs limits indirect effects
of IKur block on IKr.
Taken together, the present results confirm and extend
previous findings demonstrating that RA induces atrial
CM
specification during
cardiac differentiation from
hiPSCs and hESCs. The 3D EHT format accentuated atrial
versus ventricular differences and revealed characteristic
atrial heart muscle features in terms of gene expression,
contractile force, contraction kinetics, AP features, and
pharmacological responses. While quantitative differences
to native human atrial myocardium remain, the data over-
all suggest that RA-EHTs may be a useful extension of
experimental models in preclinical drug development
and mechanistic studies. Particularly relevant would be
chronic pacing of the RA-EHTs to study electrical remodel-
ing of AF and test new potential drugs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Differentiation of hiPSC-CMs
This investigation conforms to the principles outlined by the
Declaration of Helsinki and the Medical Association of Hamburg.
All materials from patients were taken with informed consent of
the donors. All procedures involving the generation and analysis
of hiPSC lines were approved by the local ethics committee in
Hamburg (Az PV4798, 28.10.2014).
Expansion of three undifferentiated hiPSC Ctrl cell lines (C25,
ERC18, and ERC1) (Figure S3) was performed in FTDA medium,
as recently described (Breckwoldt et al., 2017). Embryoid body
(EB) formation was induced in stirred suspension cultures
1386

 (spinner flasks). Mesodermal induction was achieved using BMP-4
(10 ng/mL), activin A (3 ng/mL), and bFGF (5 ng/mL) in the
absence of insulin in RPMI medium (Breckwoldt et al., 2017).
Specification of cardiac differentiation of mesodermal progenitors
was performed by WNT signal inhibition (XAV939, 1 mmol/L).
This resulted in a population of primarily ventricular CMs. Based
on previous reports (Cyganek et al., 2018; Devalla et al., 2015; Lee
et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2011), differentiation of atrial-like myo-
cytes was achieved by RA treatment (1 mmol/L) for the first 3 days
of Wnt signaling inhibition. RA (Sigma Aldrich R2625) was
prepared as explained in a previous publication (Devalla et al.,
2015). Data presented in this manuscript were mainly derived
from the Ctrl cell line C25 (Moretti et al., 2010) but are represen-
tative of similar results in all three lines (Figure S3). All data were
confirmed in at least three batches.
ML and EHT Generation
At the end of cardiac differentiation, no purification step was
performed before ML and EHT preparation. Differentiated EBs
were enzymatically dispersed with collagenase II (200 U/mL, Wor-
thington, LS004176 in Hank’s balanced salt solution minus Ca2+/
Mg2+, Gibco, 14175-053) for 3.5 hr at 37�C (Breckwoldt et al.,
2017). Part of the dissociated cells were plated onto black-sided
96-well plates (NUNC; 10,000 cells/well) pre-coated with Geltrex
(Gibco, A1413302; 1:100 in DMEM, 37�C, 1 hr). After 14 days
in culture, the cells formed a uniform ML. At the same time, disso-
ciated cells were mixed with fibrinogen (Sigma F4753) and
thrombin (100 U/mL, Sigma Aldrich T7513) to cast EHTs (1 3
106 cells/EHT) (Breckwoldt et al., 2017). The EHT is a synchro-
nously beating syncytium of hiPSC-CMs that generates auxotonic
contractile force by deflecting two elastic silicone posts (Breck-
woldt et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2010; Mannhardt et al., 2016).
After 14 days in culture, EHTs displayed spontaneous coherent,
regular beating deflecting the silicone posts and allowed video-op-
tical contraction analysis.
Contractility Measurements
MLs
Contraction activity in MLs was measured using an established
platform (CellOPTIQ, Clyde Biosciences, UK). In brief, ventricular-
and atrial-like myocytes obtained from hiPSCs were seeded onto
96-well glass-bottomed plates (MatTek, p96G-1.5-5-F) pre-coated
with 1:100 fibronectin (Sigma, F1141) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-
buffered saline (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific, UK, 14040133)
for 3 hr at 37�C before plating. A total volume of 200 mL of cell sus-
pension was used to obtain a final density of 65,000 cells/cm2. Af-
ter 14 days, videos of MLs were acquired at a sampling rate of
100 frames/s for 10 s. During recordings, the 96-well plate was posi-
tioned inside an on-stage incubator at 37�C with 5% CO2. Camera:
Hamamatsu ORCA-flash4.0 V2 digital CMOS camera C13440–
20CU. Microscope: Olympus IX73. Objective: Olympus, 403 air,
numerical aperture 0.60. Spontaneous contraction activity of cells
was measured using the algorithm of MUSCLEMOTION software
(Sala et al., 2018). Average contraction peaks were generated
from six contraction peaks of different MLs. These average peaks
were normalized to the smallest and largest values in the dataset
and depicted as mean ± SEM.
EHTs
Contractile analysis was performed on 14- to 20-day-old EHTs
in modified Tyrode’s solution (in mmol/L: NaCl, 120; KCl, 5.4;
MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1.8; NaH2PO4, 0.4; NaHCO3, 22.6; glucose, 5;
Na2EDTA,
0.05;
and
HEPES,
25)
pre-equilibrated
overnight
(37�C, 7% CO2, 40% O2). Analysis of contractile force was per-
formed by video-optical recording as previously described (Hansen
et al., 2010; Schaaf et al., 2011) on a setup available from EHT Tech-
nologies. The contraction peaks were analyzed in terms of fre-
quency, force, TTP, and RT. TTP�80% and TTP�50% refer to the
time from 20% to 50% above baseline (�80% and �50% from
peak) to peak, respectively. RT50% and RT80% refer to the time
from peak to 50% and 80% relaxation (50% and 20% above base-
line), respectively. Average contraction peaks were generated from
six contraction peaks of different EHTs. These average peaks were
normalized to the smallest and largest values in the dataset and de-
picted as mean ± SEM.
AP Recordings
MLs
APs in MLs were measured using CellOPTIQ platform, as previ-
ously described for ML contractility measurements. After 2 weeks,
cells were transferred to serum-free media (DMEM, Gibco 11966,
supplemented with galactose 10 mM and sodium pyruvate
1 mM). Cells were exposed for 1 min to the ratiometric voltage-
sensitive dye (Di-4-ANEPPS 6 mmol/L, at room temperature). After-
ward, MLs were placed on a heated platform of an inverted
microscope (37�C and 95% O2, 5% CO2). The Di-4-ANEPPS fluores-
cence was recorded at 10 kHz for 15 s in each well. Voltage signals
were subsequently analyzed offline using proprietary software
(Clyde Biosciences).
EHTs
APs in EHTs were recorded with sharp microelectrodes (14–20 days
old) as previously described (Lemoine et al., 2017, 2018). Tissue
from human LVs and RAAs was used for comparison. Tissues
were continuously superfused with Tyrode’s solution (NaCl,
127 mmol/L; KCl, 5.4 mmol/L; MgCl2, 1.05 mmol/L; CaCl2,
1.8 mmol/L; glucose, 10 mmol/L; NaHCO3, 22 mmol/L; NaHPO4,
0.42 mmol/L; equilibrated with O2-CO2 [95:5] at 36.5�C ±
0.5�C, pH 7.4). Tissues were field stimulated with a rectangular
pulse of 1 ms at a fixed rate 50% above threshold. All parameters
related to APD were corrected for the beating rate with Bazett
correction (Bazett, 1997). RAA samples were obtained from
patients suffering from coronary artery disease or valve disease un-
dergoing bypass or valve replacement. Left ventricular free wall
samples were obtained from patients suffering from valve disease
or cardiomyopathy (details are given in Table S2). All patients
gave informed consent. The study followed the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. Drug effects were measured 2 min after exposure to CCh and
15 min after exposure to 4-AP. APs were analyzed offline using the
Lab-Chart software (ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software
5.0. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM in bar graphs and scatter-
plots. Differences between groups were analyzed by paired or un-
paired t test. Results were considered statistically significant if

 the p value was less than 0.05. All experiments consisted of at least
