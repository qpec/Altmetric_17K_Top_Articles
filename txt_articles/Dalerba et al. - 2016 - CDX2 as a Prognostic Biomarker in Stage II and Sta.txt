BACKGROUND
The identification of high-risk stage II colon cancers is key to the selection of 
patients who require adjuvant treatment after surgery. Microarray-based multigene-
expression signatures derived from stem cells and progenitor cells hold promise, 
but they are difficult to use in clinical practice.
METHODS
We used a new bioinformatics approach to search for biomarkers of colon epithe-
lial differentiation across gene-expression arrays and then ranked candidate genes 
according to the availability of clinical-grade diagnostic assays. With the use of 
subgroup analysis involving independent and retrospective cohorts of patients with 
stage II or stage III colon cancer, the top candidate gene was tested for its asso-
ciation with disease-free survival and a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS
The transcription factor CDX2 ranked first in our screening test. A group of 87 of 
2115 tumor samples (4.1%) lacked CDX2 expression. In the discovery data set, 
which included 466 patients, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was lower 
among the 32 patients (6.9%) with CDX2-negative colon cancers than among the 
434 (93.1%) with CDX2-positive colon cancers (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, 
3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 7.38; P 
= 
0.002). In the validation data 
set, which included 314 patients, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was lower 
among the 38 patients (12.1%) with CDX2 protein–negative colon cancers than among 
the 276 (87.9%) with CDX2 protein–positive colon cancers (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% 
CI, 1.36 to 4.29; P 
= 
0.003). In both these groups, these findings were independent 
of the patient’s age, sex, and tumor stage and grade. Among patients with stage 
II cancer, the difference in 5-year disease-free survival was significant both in the 
discovery data set (49% among 15 patients with CDX2-negative tumors vs. 87% 
among 191 patients with CDX2-positive tumors, P 
= 
0.003) and in the validation data 
set (51% among 15 patients with CDX2-negative tumors vs. 80% among 106 patients 
with CDX2-positive tumors, P 
= 
0.004). In a pooled database of all patient cohorts, 
the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was higher among 23 patients with stage II 
CDX2-negative tumors who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy than among 
25 who were not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (91% vs. 56%, P 
= 
0.006).
CONCLUSIONS
Lack of CDX2 expression identified a subgroup of patients with high-risk stage II colon 
cancer who appeared to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. (Funded by the Na-
tional Comprehensive Cancer Network, the National Institutes of Health, and others.)

uring the past decade, disease-free 
survival among patients with stage III 
colon cancer has increased significantly 
owing to the introduction of new adjuvant che-
motherapy regimens.1-3 This therapeutic success, 
however, has not translated into longer disease-
free survival among patients with earlier-stage 
(stage I or II) cancer.4 The lack of simple, reliable 
criteria for the identification of patients with 
early-stage disease who are at high risk for re-
lapse has made it difficult to identify patients in 
whom the hazards of multiagent chemotherapy 
may be offset by benefits with respect to disease-
specific survival.4-9
To address this problem, researchers have ex-
plored the possibility of stratifying patients with 
colon cancer according to the gene-expression 
profile of their tumor tissues, and they have 
developed multigene-expression signatures that 
can be used to identify high-risk colon can-
cers.10-15 Although gene-expression signatures 
hold promise, they are difficult to use in clinical 
practice16 and are often not predictive of benefit 
from adjuvant chemotherapy.17
Among the gene-expression signatures with 
the greatest promise are those derived from 
stem cells and progenitor cells.18,19 Therefore, we 
initiated a systematic search for a biomarker 
that could be used to identify undifferentiated 
tumors (i.e., tumors depleted of cells with a 
mature phenotype) by means of immunohisto-
chemical analysis.
To perform this search, we adopted a bio-
informatics approach using Boolean logic. This 
approach, which was designed to discover de-
velopmentally regulated genes,20,21 was used to 
identify genes with expression in colon cancer 
that was negatively linked to the activated leuko-
cyte-cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166). 
This marker of immature colon epithelial cells is 
preferentially expressed at the bottom of colon 
crypts22,23 and on human colon-cancer cells with 
enriched tumorigenic capacity in mouse xeno-
transplantation models.24
This screening test led us to identify caudal-
type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) as 
a candidate biomarker of mature colon epithelial 
tissues. Using subgroup analysis involving retro-
spective patient cohorts, we evaluated the associa-
tion of this biomarker with 5-year disease-free 
survival and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy 
among patients with colon cancer (Fig. 1).
Methods
Bioinformatics Analysis of Gene-Expression 
Array Databases
We searched for genes that fulfilled the “X-nega-
tive implies ALCAM-positive” Boolean relationship 
in a collection of 2329 human colon gene-expres-
sion array experiments (Fig. S1 in Supplementary 
Appendix 1, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org). This collection was down-
loaded from the National Center for Biotechnolo-
gy Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) repository (www 
. 
ncbi 
. 
nlm 
. 
nih 
. 
gov/ 
geo). 
The search was conducted with the use of Bool-
eanNet software20 with a false discovery rate of 
less than 0.0001 as a cutoff point for positive 
results (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Appendix 1). 
Candidate genes were ranked according to the 
dynamic range of their expression levels (Fig. S3 
in Supplementary Appendix 1).
The relationship between CDX2 expression 
levels and other molecular features such as micro-
satellite instability and TP53 mutations was 
studied in ad hoc collections annotated with the 
respective information after tumor samples were 
stratified into CDX2-negative and CDX2-positive 
subgroups with the use of the StepMiner algo-
rithm25 (Fig. S4 and S5 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1). The relationship between CDX2 messenger 
RNA (mRNA) expression levels or ALCAM mRNA 
expression levels and disease-free survival was 
tested in a discovery data set of 466 patients. We

A database containing 2329 human gene–expression 
arrays from both 214 normal colon tissue samples and 
2115 colorectal-cancer tissue samples was mined to 
identify genes that fulfilled the “X-negative implies 
 
activated leukocyte-cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)–
positive” Boolean implication. The search yielded 16 
candidate genes, of which only 1 (CDX2) encoded for a 
clinically actionable biomarker. The association between 
CDX2 expression and disease-free survival was tested 
in two independent patient cohorts: a discovery data 
set (National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene 
Expression Omnibus [NCBI-GEO]) and a validation data 
set (Cancer Diagnosis Program of the National Cancer 
Institute [NCI-CDP]). The association between CDX2 
expression and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy 
was tested in a pooled database of 669 patients with 
stage II disease and 1228 patients with stage III dis-
ease from four independent data sets (NCBI-GEO, 
NCI-CDP, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel 
Project [NSABP] C-07 trial [NSABP C-07], and the Stan-
ford Tissue Microarray Database [TMAD]).

Supplementary Appendix 1. Complete lists of all

Tables S1 through S5 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1, Supplementary Appendix 2, Supplemen-
tary Appendix 3, Supplementary Appendix 4, 
and Supplementary Appendix 5, respectively.
Immunohistochemical Testing
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sec-
tions were stained with 4 mg per milliliter of a 
mouse antihuman CDX2 monoclonal antibody 
that was previously validated for diagnostic ap-
plications (clone CDX2-88, BioGenex).28,29 The 
staining protocol was based on recommenda-
tions from the Nordic Immunohistochemical 
Quality Control organization (www.nordiqc.org), 
which suggests heat-induced antigen retrieval 
with Tris buffer and EDTA (pH 9.0) (Epitope 
Retrieval Solution pH9, Leica).30 Tissue slides 
were stained on a Bond-Max automatic stainer 
(Leica), and antigen detection was visualized 
with the use of the Bond Polymer Refine Detec-
tion kit (Leica).
Analysis of Tissue Microarrays
Colon-cancer tissue microarrays, fully annotated 
with clinical and pathological information, were 
obtained from three independent sources: 367 
patients in the Cancer Diagnosis Program of the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI-CDP), 1519 patients 
in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and 
Bowel Project (NSABP) C-07 trial (NSABP C-07), 
and 321 patients in the Stanford Tissue Microarray 
Database (Stanford TMAD). A detailed description 
of the patient cohorts represented in each tissue 
microarray and of the scoring system used to 
evaluate CDX2 expression is provided in Figures 
S11 through S14 in Supplementary Appendix 1.
All tissue microarrays were scored for CDX2 
expression in a blinded fashion. In cases in 
which tissue microarrays contained two tissue 
cores for a patient (i.e., two samples from dis-
tinct areas of the same tumor), the two cores 
were scored independently and paired at the end. 
If scores for the two samples were discordant, 
the final score for the tumor was upgraded to 
the higher score. All tumors in which the malig-
nant epithelial component showed widespread 
nuclear expression of CDX2, either in all or a 
majority of cancer cells, were scored as CDX2-
positive. All tumors in which the malignant epi-
thelial component either completely lacked CDX2 
expression or showed faint nuclear expression in 
a minority of malignant epithelial cells were 
scored as CDX2-negative.
The concordance between the scoring results 
obtained by two independent investigators was 
evaluated with the use of contingency tables and 
by calculation of Cohen’s kappa indexes (Fig. S15 
in Supplementary Appendix 1). The association 
between CDX2 expression and survival outcomes 
was tested by a third investigator who did not 
participate in the scoring process.
Statistical Analysis
Patient subgroups were compared with respect to 
survival outcomes with the use of Kaplan–Meier 
curves, log-rank tests, and multivariate analyses 
based on the Cox proportional-hazards method. 
Differences in the frequency of CDX2-negative 
cancers across different subgroups were com-
pared with the use of Pearson’s chi-square test 
and by computation of odds ratios together with 
their 95% confidence intervals. Interactions be-
tween the biomarker (CDX2 status) and adjuvant 
chemotherapy were evaluated with the use of the 
Cox proportional-hazards method in a 2-by-2 
factorial design (i.e., by testing for the presence 
of an interaction factor between the hazard rates 
of the two variables).
Results
Identification of CDX2
The first aim of this study was to identify an ac-
tionable biomarker of poorly differentiated colon 
cancers (i.e., tumors depleted of mature colon 
epithelial cells). An actionable biomarker is one 
for which a clinical-grade diagnostic test had 
already been developed. Using a software algo-
rithm designed for the discovery of genes with 
expression patterns that are linked by Boolean 
relationships (BooleanNet),20 we mined a data-
base of 2329 human colon gene-expression array 
experiments, searching for genes that fulfilled 
the “X-negative implies ALCAM-positive” Boolean 
implication (i.e., genes with expression that was, 
at the same time, absent only in ALCAM-positive 
tumors and always present in ALCAM-negative 
tumors) (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
The search led to the identification of 16 can-
didate genes (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1). Of these genes, only 1 gene encoded a

CDX2 as a Biomarker in Colon Cancer
protein that could be studied by means of im-
munohistochemical analysis with the use of a 
clinical-grade diagnostic test: the homeobox tran-
scription factor CDX2.28,29,31 CDX2 is a master 
regulator of intestinal development and onco-
genesis,32,33 and its expression is highly specific 
to the intestinal epithelium.29 Colon cancers 
without CDX2 expression are often associated 
with an increased likelihood of aggressive fea-
tures such as advanced stage, poor differentia-
tion, vascular invasion, BRAF mutation, and the 
CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).34-39
A detailed analysis of the gene-expression re-
lationship between CDX2 and ALCAM confirmed 
the existence of three gene-expression groups: 
CDX2-negative and ALCAM-positive, CDX2-posi-
tive and ALCAM-positive, and CDX2-positive and 
ALCAM-negative (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix 1). Lack of CDX2 expression was restrict-
ed to a small subgroup of 87 of 2115 colorectal 
cancers (4.1%). This subgroup was characterized 
by high levels of ALCAM expression (Fig. S3 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1) and only partial over-
lap with tumors defined by microsatellite insta-
bility or TP53 mutations (Fig. S4 and S5 in Sup-
plementary Appendix 1). We thus proceeded to 
Figure 2. Relationship between CDX2 Expression and Disease-free Survival in the NCBI-GEO Discovery Data Set.
Analysis of CDX2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the NCBI-GEO discovery data set revealed the presence of 
a minority subgroup of CDX2-negative colon cancers that were characterized by high ALCAM mRNA expression levels 
(Panel A) and that were associated with a lower rate of 5-year disease-free survival than CDX2-positive colon cancers 
(Panel B). In Panel A, each circle in the scatter plot represents one patient sample. The association between CDX2-
negative cancers and a lower rate of disease-free survival remained significant in a multivariate analysis that excluded 
tumor stage, tumor grade, age, and sex as confounding variables (Panel C).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
evaluate the association between CDX2 expres-
sion and disease-free survival in two indepen-
dent patient data sets: the NCBI-GEO discovery 
data set and the NCI-CDP validation data set.
CDX2 Expression and Disease-free Survival  
in the NCBI-GEO Discovery Data Set
To evaluate the association between CDX2 expres-
sion and disease-free survival among patients in 
the NCBI-GEO discovery data set, we used the 
StepMiner algorithm to stratify the population 
of 466 patients into CDX2-negative and CDX2-
positive subgroups and then used Kaplan–Meier 
curves to compare the disease-free survival of 
the two subgroups (Fig. 2). The analysis showed 
that the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was 
lower among the 32 patients (6.9%) with CDX2-
negative tumors than among the 434 (93.1%) with 
CDX2-positive tumors (41% vs. 74%, P<0.001). In 
a multivariate analysis that excluded age, sex, 
and tumor stage as confounding variables, the 
hazard ratio for disease recurrence among pa-
tients with CDX2-negative versus CDX2-positive 
tumors was 2.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.58 to 4.72; P<0.001).
Within the NCBI-GEO discovery data set, 
data on only 216 patients were annotated with 
information on pathological grade (Table S1 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1). A multivariate analy-
sis that was restricted to these 216 patients 
showed that CDX2-negative tumors were associ-
ated with a higher risk of recurrence than CDX2-
positive ones (hazard ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.60 to 
7.38; P 
= 
0.002); the hazard ratio associated with 
the CDX2 status was higher than that associated 
with increasing pathological grade (hazard ratio, 
0.99; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.74; P 
= 
0.96).
High levels of ALCAM expression had previ-
ously been shown to be associated with worse 
clinical outcomes.23 Moreover, in the NCBI-GEO 
discovery data set, the rate of 5-year disease-free 
survival associated with ALCAM-positive tumors 
was moderately, but significantly lower than that 
associated with ALCAM-negative ones (67% vs. 
78%, P 
= 
0.048) (Fig. S7 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1). Therefore, we evaluated whether the asso-
ciation between CDX2-negative tumors and a lower 
rate of disease-free survival could be explained 
by the fact that most CDX2-negative tumors were 
also ALCAM-positive. To this end, we used Hege-
mon software21 to stratify the NCBI-GEO popu-
lation into three subgroups (CDX2-negative and 
ALCAM-positive, CDX2-positive and ALCAM-posi-
tive, and CDX2-positive and ALCAM-negative) and 
then compared their clinical outcomes (Fig. S8 
and S9 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
The results showed that CDX2-negative and 
ALCAM-positive tumors were associated with a 
lower rate of 5-year disease-free survival than 
CDX2-positive and ALCAM-positive and CDX2-pos-
itive and ALCAM-negative tumors. A similar set 
of tests also indicated that when compared side 
by side with the use of multivariate analysis, the 
hazard ratios for disease recurrence associated 
with the CDX2 and ALCAM grouping system were 
higher than those associated with the “intestinal 
stem-cell” gene-expression signature19 (Fig. S10 
in Supplementary Appendix 1).
CDX2 Expression and Disease-free Survival  
in the NCI-CDP Validation Data Set
To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we 
decided to test whether they could be reproduced 
in an independent data set,40 and we chose to 
analyze a human colon-cancer tissue microarray 
obtained from the NCI-CDP. This microarray was 
explicitly designed to contain a balanced distri-
bution of patients with and without tumor recur-
rence, as well as with a relatively homogeneous 
long-term follow-up, with the aim to maximize 
the statistical power to find associations be-
tween biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

Protein Expression and Disease-free Survival in the 
NCI-CDP Validation Data Set.
Analysis of CDX2 protein expression in the NCI-CDP 
validation data set confirmed the existence of a minority 
subgroup of CDX2-negative cancers (Panel A) that lacked 
the distinctive CDX2 nuclear expression that is charac-
teristic of epithelial cancer cells in the majority of colon 
cancers (Panel B). CDX2-negative cancers were associ-
ated with a lower rate of 5-year disease-free survival 
than CDX2-positive cancers (Panel C). The association 
between the absence of CDX2 expression and a lower 
rate of 5-year disease-free survival was confirmed by 
means of a multivariate analysis (based on the Cox 
proportional-hazards method) that excluded tumor 
stage, tumor grade, age, and sex as confounding vari-
ables (Panel D). CDX2-negative tumors were associated 
with a lower rate of survival independent of their sub-
classification with regard to low or intermediate (G1 or 
G2) or high (G3 or G4) pathological grade (Panel E).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
To evaluate CDX2 protein expression, we used 
immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-
CDX2 monoclonal antibody that had previously 
been validated for diagnostic purposes.28,29 Analy-
sis of stained sections confirmed the presence of 
a minority subgroup of cancers that lacked ex-
pression of CDX2 protein in malignant epithelial 
cells, as compared with the majority of samples 
that had intense nuclear staining (Fig. 3). On the 
basis of these results, we stratified the patient 
cohort into two subgroups: CDX2-negative (48 of 
366 patients [13%]) and CDX2-positive (318 of 366 
patients [87%]). A description of the scoring 
system and its performance in terms of interob-
server agreement is provided in Figures S14 and 
S15 in Supplementary Appendix 1.
CDX2-negative tumors were associated with a 
worse prognosis than were CDX2-positive tumors, 
with lower rates of 5-year disease-free survival 
(48% vs. 71%, P<0.001) (Fig. 3), overall survival 
(33% vs. 59%, P<0.001) (Fig. S16 in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1), and disease-specific survival 
(45% vs. 72%, P<0.001) (Fig. S16 in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1). The association remained sig-
nificant in multivariate analyses that excluded 
age, sex, tumor stage, and tumor grade as con-
founding variables: in the analysis of disease-
free survival, the hazard ratio for disease recur-
rence associated with CDX2-negative tumors as 
compared with CDX2-positive tumors was 2.42 
(95% CI, 1.36 to 4.29; P 
= 
0.003); in the analysis 
of overall survival, the hazard ratio for death 
was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.18 to 2.71; P 
= 
0.006); and in 
the analysis of disease-specific death, the hazard 
ratio for death was 2.09 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.58; 
P 
= 
0.007).
CDX2-negative status was more common 
among tumors with a high pathological grade 
(Fig. S17 in Supplementary Appendix 1). How-
ever, CDX2-negative tumors were associated with 
a lower rate of survival irrespective of their low 
or intermediate (G1 or G2) or high (G3 or G4) 
pathological grade — a finding consistent with 
the results of the multivariate analysis (Fig. 3, 
and Fig. S17 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
CDX2 Expression and Survival among Patients 
with Stage II Disease
To evaluate our findings with respect to the 
prognosis among patients with early-stage colon 
cancer, we decided to study the association be-
tween the CDX2-negative phenotype, assessed at 
either the mRNA or protein level, and disease-
free survival among patients with stage II dis-
ease. Stage II CDX2-negative tumors were asso-
ciated with a lower rate of 5-year disease-free 
survival than were stage II CDX2-positive tumors 
in both the NCBI-GEO discovery data set (49% vs. 
87%, P 
= 
0.003) (Fig. 4) and the NCI-CDP valida-
tion data set (51% vs. 80%, P 
= 
0.004) (Fig. 4).
We found similar associations with respect to 
overall survival (40% among patients with CDX2-
negative tumors vs. 70% among those with 
CDX2-positive tumors, P<0.001) (Fig. S18 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1) and disease-specific 
survival (66% vs. 89%, P 
= 
0.005) (Fig. S18 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1). These associations 
were not confounded by risk factors that are 
known to affect survival rates among patients 
with stage II colon cancer, such as the depth of 
invasion of the primary tumor (T3 vs. T4) (Fig. 
S19 in Supplementary Appendix 1) and the num-
ber of lymph nodes resected at surgery (≥12 vs. 
<12) (Fig. S19 in Supplementary Appendix 1). 
However, in each of the two data sets, only 15 
patients with stage II CDX2-negative disease were 
identified.
CDX2 Expression and Benefit from Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy
To evaluate whether patients with CDX2-negative 
tumors might benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy, we investigated the association between 
CDX2 status, assessed at either the mRNA or 
protein level, and disease-free survival among 
patients who either did or did not receive adju-
vant chemotherapy. A preliminary test involving 
cohorts of patients with stage III disease in both 
the discovery and validation data sets suggested 
a strong association between the use of adjuvant 
chemotherapy and a higher rate of disease-free 
survival in the CDX2-negative subgroups (Fig. S20 
in Supplementary Appendix 1).
We thus decided to validate this observation 
in an expanded database of 669 patients with 
stage II colon cancer and 1228 patients with 
stage III colon cancer. We obtained this data-
base by pooling data from four independent 
patient cohorts (NCBI-GEO, NCI-CDP, NSABP 
C-07, and Stanford TMAD); these data were an-
notated with information about adjuvant che-
motherapy (Fig. 1). A detailed description of all 
patient data sets used for this experiment is 
provided in Figure S6 and Figures S11, S12, and 
S13 in Supplementary Appendix 1.

adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a 
higher rate of disease-free survival in both the 
stage II subgroup (91% with chemotherapy vs. 
56% with no chemotherapy, P 
= 
0.006) and the 
stage III subgroup (74% with chemotherapy vs. 
37% with no chemotherapy, P<0.001) of the 
CDX2-negative patient population (Fig. 5). A test 
for the interaction between the biomarker and 
the treatment revealed that the benefit observed 
in CDX2-negative cohorts was superior to that 
observed in CDX2-positive cohorts in both the 
stage II subgroup (P 
= 
0.02 for the interaction) 
and the stage III subgroup (P 
= 
0.005 for the in-
teraction). The association between CDX2-nega-
tive status and benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy was not confounded by risk factors that 
are known to affect the survival rates among 
patients with stage II and stage III disease. 
These risk factors include the depth of invasion 
of the primary tumor (T3 vs. T4), the number of 
lymph nodes resected at surgery (≥12 vs. <12), 
and the number of metastatic lymph nodes (N1 
vs. N2) (Figs. S21 through S24 in Supplementary 
Appendix 1).
Discussion
Prognostic biomarkers are key to the risk strati-
fication of patients with colon cancer and the 
decision to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy 
in patients with early-stage disease.6 Currently, 
tumor stage, tumor grade, and microsatellite 
instability remain the most important among a 
handful of prognostic variables that are consid-
ered in the development of algorithms for the 
treatment of patients with early-stage colon 
cancer.5,9 Prognostic variables such as lympho-
vascular invasion by cancer cells and perineural 
invasion by cancer cells, though very promising, 
have proved difficult to standardize because of 
technical problems inherent in the visual analy-
sis and subjective definition of these features.6 
Microarray-derived gene-expression signatures 
from stem cells and progenitor cells have also 
shown promise,19 but they are often difficult to 
translate into clinical tests.16 Overall, it has 
proved difficult to identify a prognostic bio-
marker that is also predictive of benefit from 
adjuvant chemotherapy.7,8,17
In this study, we applied a bioinformatics 
approach to the discovery of prognostic bio-
markers in human cancer. We assembled a large 
database of gene-expression array experiments 
involving human colorectal cancers and searched 
for genes with differential expression, defined 
by a Boolean relationship with respect to a well-
established differentiation marker, across the 
patient population. The concept behind this ap-
proach was that genes associated with differen-
tiation processes (e.g., transcription factors in-
volved in the regulation of stem-cell self-renewal, 
lineage commitment, or both) could be identi-
fied as single prognostic biomarkers that could 
be used to stratify tumors on the basis of a 
Figure 4. Relationship between CDX2 Expression and Disease-free Survival 
among Patients with Stage II Disease.
In the NCBI-GEO discovery data set (Panel A), CDX2-negative cancers were 
associated with a rate of 5-year disease-free survival that was lower than 
the rate associated with CDX2-positive cancers. In the NCI-CDP validation 
data set (Panel B), CDX2-negative cancers were associated with a rate of 
5-year disease-free survival that was lower than the rate associated with 
CDX2-positive cancers.

cells and progenitor cells.
Using this approach, we identified CDX2 as a 
biomarker with expression that has been found 
to be absent in a minority subgroup of colon 
cancers that are characterized by high levels of 
ALCAM, a molecule that is expressed at the 
highest levels at the bottom of human colonic 
crypts22,23 and on human colon-cancer cells with 
enriched tumorigenic capacity in mouse xeno-
transplantation models.24 We then performed a 
test to determine whether CDX2-negative can-
cers might be associated with a worse progno-
Figure 5. Relationship between CDX2 Expression and Benefit from Adjuvant Chemotherapy.
The relationship between CDX2 expression and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated in a pooled 
 
database of 669 patients with stage II disease (Panel A) and 1228 patients with stage III disease (Panel B) from four 
 
independent data sets (NCBI-GEO, NCI-CDP, NSABP C-07, and Stanford TMAD). Among all patients with stage II 
disease in the entire database, treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a higher rate of 
5-year disease-free survival. However, treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy was strongly associated with a higher 
rate of 5-year disease-free survival in the CDX2-negative subgroup, but it was not associated with a higher rate of 
5-year disease-free survival in the CDX2-positive subgroup. Among patients with stage III disease, treatment with 
adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a higher rate of 5-year disease-free survival in the entire database and 
in both the CDX2-negative and CDX2-positive subgroups. A test for an interaction between the biomarker and the 
treatment indicated that in both stage II and stage III disease, the benefit associated with adjuvant chemotherapy 
was superior among CDX2-negative patients than among CDX2-positive patients.

CDX2 as a Biomarker in Colon Cancer
sis. The results revealed that without adjuvant 
chemotherapy, CDX2-negative tumors were asso-
ciated with a lower rate of disease-free survival 
than CDX2-positive tumors across independent 
data sets. This effect was independent of many 
known risk factors, including pathological grade.
Previous studies had indicated that CDX2-
negative tumors are often associated with sev-
eral adverse prognostic variables (e.g., advanced 
stage, poor differentiation, vascular invasion, 
BRAF mutation, and CIMP-positive status).31,35-38 
We hypothesize that the prognostic effect asso-
ciated with an absence of CDX2 expression could 
be explained by its aggregate capacity to func-
tion as a single biomarker for multiple biologic 
risk factors, under the common theme of a 
highly immature progenitor-cell phenotype.
Finally, our results indicate that patients 
with stage II or stage III CDX2-negative colon 
cancer might benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy and that adjuvant chemotherapy might 
be a treatment option for patients with stage II 
CDX2-negative disease, who are commonly treat-
ed with surgery alone. Given the exploratory 
and retrospective design of our study, these 
results will need to be further validated. We 
advocate for these findings to be confirmed 
within the framework of randomized, clinical 
trials, in conjunction with genomic DNA se-
quencing studies.
