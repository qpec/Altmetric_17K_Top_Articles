Abstract
Purpose:
To examine the trends in baccalaureate (bachelor of science in
nursing)–prepared registered nurses (BSN RNs) in U.S. acute care hospital
units and to project the growth in the number of BSN RNs by 2020.
Design:
This is a longitudinal study using the Registered Nurse Education
Indicators data (2004–2013) from the National Database of Nursing Quality
Indicators.
Methods:
The level of BSN RNs in each unit was operationalized as the
proportion of nurses holding a baccalaureate degree or higher among all the
nurses in a unit. Our sample included 12,194 unit-years from 2,126 units of six
cohorts in 377 U.S. acute care hospitals. A hierarchical linear regression model
was used to examine the trends in BSN RNs and to project future growth in
the number of BSN RNs when controlling for hospital and unit characteristics
and considering repeated measures in units over time and clustering of units
within hospitals.
Results: The proportion of BSN RNs in U.S. acute care hospital units increased
from 44% in 2004 to 57% in 2013 (a 30% increase); when combining all
cohorts, this rate increased from 44% in 2009 to 51% in 2013. On average, the
proportion of BSN RNs in a unit increased by 1.3% annually before 2010 and
by 1.9% each year from 2010 on. The percentage of units having at least 80%
of their nurses with a baccalaureate degree or higher increased from 3% in
2009 to 7% in 2013. Based on the current trends, 64% of the nurses working
in a hospital unit will have a baccalaureate degree by 2020, and 22% of the
units will reach the 80% goal by 2020.
Conclusions: There was a significant increase in the proportion of BSN RNs
in U.S. acute care hospital units over the past decade, particularly after 2010.
However, given the current trends, it is unlikely that the goal of 80% nurses
with a baccalaureate degree will be achieved by 2020.
Clinical Relevance: The U.S. nursing workforce is under educational trans-
formation in order to meet the increasing healthcare needs. To help acceler-
ate this transformation, further advocacy, commitment, and investment are
needed from all healthcare stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, executives and
managers of healthcare facilities, nursing schools, etc.).
Nurses compose the largest healthcare workforce in the
United States. There were 2.75 million registered nurses
(RNs) working in healthcare settings in 2014, of whom
61% (or over 1.6 million) worked in hospitals (Bureau
of Labor Statistics, 2015). Given the dramatic changes
within the U.S. healthcare system, such as the aging
of the baby boomers and the expansion of health in-
surance coverage (Department of Health and Human

Services, 2015; Garfield, Damico, Cox, Claxton, & Levitt,
2016), nurses will likely have an even greater role in
improving quality of care and patient outcomes (Na-
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,
2015). Consequently, it is critical to build a competent
nursing workforce to meet the increasing and complex
healthcare needs in the United States.
One strategy for preparing a competent nursing work-
force is to advance nurse education, particularly by pro-
moting the number of baccalaureate (bachelor of science
in nursing)–prepared registered nurses (BSN RNs). In-
creasing evidence has demonstrated that higher nurse
education is associated with better quality of care and pa-
tient outcomes (Aiken et al., 2014; McHugh & Ma, 2013).
In a seminal study of 168 U.S. general acute care hospitals
with 232,342 surgical patients, the researchers found that
hospitals with higher proportions of nurses holding a bac-
calaureate degree (BSN) or higher had significantly lower
surgical patient mortality and failure-to-rescue (Aiken,
Clarke, Cheung, Sloane, & Silber, 2003). This study was
replicated in the United States with more recent data
of 665 hospitals and 1.3 million patients (Aiken et al.,
2011) and internationally with similar results (Aiken
et al.,2014; Ridley, 2008; Van den Heede et al., 2009).
The linkage between higher proportion of BSN RNs and
lower mortality rates has been further supported by
findings from a panel study of 134 hospitals over time
(1999–2006; Kutney-Lee, Sloane, & Aiken, 2013). Fur-
ther complementing the results of large-scale studies, a
detailed study of the dose response of care by BSN RNs in
a single large U.S. hospital showed that better patient out-
comes were associated with more hours of patient care by
BSN RNs; and the hospital could financially benefit from
hiring more BSN RNs (Yakusheva, Lindrooth, & Weiss,
2014).
Acting on the basis of growing evidence of a linkage
between more BSN RNs and better patient outcomes, the
Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended in its mile-
stone report, The Future of Nursing: Leading Change,
Advancing Health, that 80% of U.S. RNs should have
at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing by 2020
(80/20 goal; IOM, 2011). This recommendation was
immediately supported, for the first time in history, by
the Tri-Council, an alliance between the main nurs-
ing organizations in the United States, including the
American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the Amer-
ican Nurses Association, the American Organization of
Nurse Executives, and the National League for Nursing
(Tri-Council of Nursing, n.d.). Since the report was
released, a variety of initiatives (e.g., The Future of
Nursing: Campaign for Action) have been carried out to
achieve this 80/20 goal, and some changes have been
noted. A 2014 survey of nursing schools by the American
Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) indicated a
4.2% enrollment growth in entry-level baccalaureate
programs and a 10.4% increase in “RN-to-BSN” pro-
grams for RNs with associate degrees or diplomas from
2013–2014 (AACN, 2015).
While there is mounting evidence demonstrating the
significance of promoting baccalaureate education for
nurses, empirical evidence illustrating the recent trends
in BSN RNs in clinical settings over time is rare. Such evi-
dence is critical for a better understanding of the ongoing
educational transformation of the nursing workforce. To
address the gap, the purpose of this study was twofold:
(a) to illustrate the recent trends in BSN RNs using unit-
level data (2004–2013) of U.S. acute care hospitals from a
national database; and (b) to estimate whether the 80/20
goal is achievable based upon the current trend and, if
not, how far away from it we remain.
Methods
Data and Sample
This was a longitudinal study using the Registered Nur-
se Education Indicators data (2004–2013) from the Na-
tional Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI).
The NDNQI was founded in 1998 by the American
Nursing Association with the mission of aiding nurses in
efforts to improve care quality and patient safety and has
been owned by Press Ganey, Inc. since 2014 (Montalvo,
2007). The NDNQI is a national nursing quality measure-
ment data repository in the United States that enables re-
searchers to compare the quality of hospital nursing and
nursing-sensitive patient outcomes at the unit level. Over
2,000 hospitals nationwide were submitting nursing and
patient outcomes data to the NDNQI by 2014.
One of the NDNQI’s endeavors is to collect data on
nurses’ education (RN education indicator) at the unit
level from NDNQI member hospitals. RN education data
in each eligible unit were collected by trained nursing
staff in NDNQI member hospitals and reported quarterly
to the NDNQI. Submitted information includes the num-
ber of eligible RNs on a unit and the number of RNs
at each educational level (i.e., diploma, associate degree,
bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and doctorate degree).
For nurses with multiple degrees, only the highest nurs-
ing degree is counted. RNs (full-time, part-time, and per-
diem RNs) are eligible for this report if they were unit
based, with direct patient care responsibilities for at least
50% of their time, and listed on the staffing roster during
the reporting quarter. RNs who were on temporary voca-
tional or medical leave were included, too. However, RNs
were excluded if they were contract or agency nurses or
not assigned to a specific unit.

Recent Trends in BSN RNs
In this study, the unit of analysis was the unit-year.
We annualized the proportion of BSN RNs across quar-
ters in each year from 2004 to 2013 for each unit. To
be included in this study, units must have at least three
quarters of RN education data in each year; units must
also have at least 5 consecutive years of RN education
data to ensure a sufficient amount of data for modeling
time trends and projections. Units were categorized into
different cohorts based on the first year a unit submitted
data to the NDNQI. For example, cohort 2004 included
units that submitted three or four quarters of data each
year since 2004 and until 2013. In total, there were six
unit cohorts (cohorts 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, and 09).
An advantage of the NDNQI database is that units are
consistently and systematically classified into a certain
type based on the patient population, type of care pro-
vided, and patient acuity level. This enables compara-
tive analysis of units across hospitals. For this study, we
included five adult unit types: critical care, step-down,
medical, surgical, and medical-surgical combined. These
units represent the vast majority of adult units reporting
data to the NDNQI. They also are the most common units
within acute care hospitals. The final analytic dataset con-
sisted of 12,194 unit-years from 2,126 units in 377 acute
care hospitals.
Variables
Unit BSN RNs. The level of BSN RNs in each unit was
operationalized as the proportion of RNs holding a bac-
calaureate degree or higher among all the RNs in a unit.
A time variable (named t) was generated to reflect the
numbers of years from the baseline year, which varied by
cohorts. A dummy variable named flag was also created
to indicate whether a year was before or after 2010 (i.e.,
flag = 0 before 2010, flag = 1 from 2010 on). This vari-
able was used to compare time trends before and after
the release of The Future of Nursing report.
Covariates. Hospital- and unit-level characteristics at
baseline were included as covariates. Hospital-level co-
variates were ownership, bed size, teaching status, Mag-
net status, and geographic location. Hospital ownership
was categorized as nonprofit, profit, or government-
owned. Hospital size was measured by the number of
staffed beds and grouped into two categories (small, �299
beds; large, �300 beds). Teaching status was classified as
teaching and nonteaching. Hospitals were also identified
based on their Magnet status. Given the geographic lo-
cations, hospitals were classified as those located in the
metropolitan area versus those out of metropolitan ar-
eas. A unit-level variable indicating unit type was incl-
uded, too.
Analysis
Baseline characteristics (both hospital- and unit-level)
were described first for each cohort. Levels of BSN RNs
were then described for each cohort by unit type. BSN
RN levels were plotted to show visually how the propor-
tion of BSN RNs changed over time. Given the complex
data structure that units clustered within hospitals and
measures were repeated within units over time, a three-
level hierarchical linear regression model was employed
to examine whether there was a difference in the trends
of growth in the number of BSN RNs before and after
the release of the IOM’s Future of Nursing report, when
controlling for baseline hospital and unit characteristics.
Random intercepts at both hospital and unit level were
included to account for the cluster of units within hospi-
tals and repeated measures within units. Our preliminary
analysis suggested no significant differences in the overall
trends by unit cohort. Therefore, regression models were
conducted across all cohorts. Finally, based on the esti-
mates of current trends in the growth in the number of
BSN RNs from the above model, we projected the level
of BSN RNs by 2020 and compared it with the recom-
mended 80% goal.
Results
Table 1 describes the hospital- and unit-level char-
acteristics at baseline. Of the 2,126 units, there were
547 (25.7%) critical care units, 299 (14.1%) step-down
units, 426 (20.0%) medical units, 335 (15.8%) surgi-
cal units, and 519 (24.4%) medical-surgical combined
units. These units were from 377 acute care hospitals,
of which the majority were nonprofit (88.3%) and lo-
cated in metropolitan areas (87.0%), 47.1% were teach-
ing hospitals, 29.2% had at least 300 beds, and 7.7% were
Magnet hospitals. There were some differences in hospital
characteristics at baseline across cohort, such as hospital
size, teaching status, and Magnet status.
Table 2 presents the unit percentage of BSN RNs at
the baseline year for each cohort by unit type. Over-
all, the percentage of BSN RNs at baseline slightly var-
ied by cohort from 36% (cohort 2005) to 44% (cohort
2004). In each cohort, the percentage of BSN RNs var-
ied by unit types, and critical care units had the high-
est levels of RNs holding bachelor’s degrees or above at
baseline. For example, in cohort 2004, the percentage of
RNs holding a baccalaureate degree varied from 49% in
critical care units to 36% in medical-surgical combined
units.
Figure 1 (also shown in Table S1) illustrates the
trends in BSN RNs at the unit level in each cohort from
2004 to 2013. The percentages of BSN RNs increased

significantly over time in all cohorts. For example, for
units in cohort 2004, the percentage of BSN RNs in-
creased by approximately 30% from 44% in 2004 to 57%
in 2013. Despite the differences in percentages of BSN
RNs at the baseline years, our preliminary analyses (see
Figure 1) indicated that there were no significant cohort
differences in the trends in BSN RNs.
We also analyzed the proportion of units with �50%
and �80% BSN RNs (Table S2). Overall, the percentage
of units with �50% nurses with a BSN degree increased
from 35% in 2009 to 52% in 2013 (a 47% increase); the
percentage of units with �80% nurses with a BSN degree
increased from 3% in 2009 to 7% in 2013 (a 73% in-
crease). Although critical care units had the highest pro-
portion of units with �50% nurses with a BSN degree in
2009, it had the lowest increase rate from 2009 to 2013.
Medical-surgical combined units had the highest rate of
increase (150%) in the proportion of units with �80%
BSN RNs, from 2% in 2009 to 5% in 2013; and surgical
units had the lowest rate of increase (55%) in the propor-
tion of units with �80% BSN RNs, from 3.28% in 2009
to 5% in 2013.
Table 3 shows estimates of the differences in trends in
BSN RNs before and after 2010 when controlling for hos-
pital and unit characteristics at baseline. There was a sig-
nificant difference in trends in BSN RNs before and after
2010 as indicated by the interaction term (coefficient =
0.63, p = .000). On average, the proportion of BSN RNs
increased by 1.3% annually in the years before 2010; and
it increased by 1.9% each year after 2010. In other words,
the average increasing rate after 2010 was 1.5 times the
rate in years before 2010.
Table 4 presents the estimates of proportion of BSN
RNs in the future based upon the current trends, both
overall (all units) and by unit types. By 2020 there will
be a projected 64% RNs that provide direct patient care

have the highest proportion of BSN RNs (72%), whereas
medical-surgical combined would have the lowest (60%).
The 80% goal will not be reached until at least 2029
(81%); critical care units will likely be the first to reach
the 80% goal by 2025, and by 2031 units of all types will
achieve the 80% goal. In general, 22% of the units in this
study will reach the 80% goal by 2020 and 57% of the
units will reach the goal by 2023 (Table S3). Table S3
also displays the predicted proportion of units with �50%
and �80% nurses with a BSN degree by 2020, 2025, and
2030.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the recent trends in
BSN RNs in U.S. acute care hospital units between
2004 and 2013 using data from a national nursing
quality database. Our findings provide empirical evi-
dence illustrating the ongoing educational transforma-
tion of the nursing workforce, particularly in hospital care
settings.
Our study shows that there is a consistent increase in
the proportion of BSN RNs in acute care hospital units,
and this increase appears to have begun several years be-
fore the 2010 IOM report of The Future of Nursing was
released. In our study, for example, we found that in co-
hort 2004 approximately 44% of the nurses providing
direct patient care on a unit had BSN degrees in 2004,
and this number reached 57% in 2013; across cohorts,
51% of RNs held a baccalaureate degree or higher in
2013. Our finding is similar to that of the National Sam-
ple Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN). The NSSRN is
a national survey conducted by the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA) between 1977 and 2008
and aimed at examining the characteristics of U.S. reg-
istered nurses. Data from the NSSRN indicated that ap-
proximately 45% and 50% of the RNs held a bachelor’s
degree or higher in 2004 and 2008, respectively (HRSA,
n.d.). Data from the National Nursing Workforce Survey
showed that there were about 61% RNs holding a bac-
calaureate or higher degree (Budden, Zhong, Moulton,
& Cimiotti, 2013). Using data from the Integrated Post-
Secondary Education System, Buerhaus, Auerbach, and
Staiger (2016) estimated that the proportion of nurs-
ing graduates with baccalaureate degrees increased from
45% in 2002 to 53% in 2012; in 2011, there were more
BSN graduates than associate degree in nursing (ADN)
graduates for the first time. Despite slight differences in
the estimates of proportion of BSN RNs, which are mainly
due to the different sampling strategies employed in each
study, a common theme of a consistent and significant in-
crease in the proportion of BSN RNs is conclusive across
studies.
Our findings also suggest that the increase in the
proportion of BSN RNs in acute care hospital units accel-
erated from 2010 on. In our sample, we found that on
average the proportion of BSN RNs on a unit increased
by 1.3% annually before 2010 and 1.9% annually in
2010 and after. In 2010, the IOM published the milestone
report of The Future of Nursing. Although we cannot
claim a causal relation between the publication of this
report and the accelerated increase in the number of
BSN RNs, our finding does suggest that the publication
of The Future of Nursing report may have contributed
to this change. This report has drawn extensive media
coverage that raised national attention to improving
nurse education nationwide and resulted in various
initiatives nationwide for promoting nurse education.
For example, shortly after the report was published,
the American Association of Retired Persons and the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation jointly initiated the
Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action. One of its
aims is to promote more efficient articulation between
associate degree and baccalaureate nursing programs
and help state action coalitions develop local and re-
gional strategies to increase the number of nurses with
BSNs (Campaign for Action, n.d.). Another example
is the Magnet Designation Program, which recognizes
healthcare organizations for high-quality patient care,

Recent Trends in BSN RNs
excellent nursing practice, and innovations in profes-
sional nursing practices. It now requires hospital appli-
cants to provide evidence documenting progress or effort
toward achieving a nursing workforce of 80% BSNs.
In addition, hospitals also show increasing and strong
preference in hiring BSN RNs (AACN, 2016; Bates, Chu,
& Spetz, 2016), and nursing schools have demonstrated
their commitment by implementing new models to
educate more BSN RNs (Close & Orlowski 2015; Gaines
& Spencer 2013). These changes well demonstrate the
influence of national initiatives on nursing workforce
development.
Despite the consistent and significant increase in the
proportion of BSN RNs, our findings suggest that the goal
of 80% BSN RNs by 2020 is unlikely to be achieved in
acute care hospitals. Based on the current trend, our es-
timates indicate that it will be 2029 that 80% of hospi-
tal RNs will be BSN prepared, and that nurses on critical
care units will reach this 80% goal first (by 2025), com-
pared to other unit types. There are many reasons that
challenge the achievement of this 80/20 national goal.
One of them is the shortage of faculty and other resource
constraints of nursing schools to enroll more BSN stu-
dents. According to the AACN, there was a nurse fac-
ulty vacancy rate of 8.3% nationwide in 2013; 79,659
qualified applicants were turned away from nursing bac-
calaureate and graduate programs in 2012; on average,
doctoral-prepared and master’s degree–prepared nurse
faculty holding title of “professor” were 61 and 57 years
old, respectively (AACN, n.d.). The small difference in
wage premium of BSN RNs and ADN or Diploma RNs
also discourage AND or Diploma RNs from pursuing a
baccalaureate degree (Spetz & Bates, 2013). In addition,
some hospital executives and administrators are reluctant
to invest more money and resources to hire BSN RNs.
However, researchers have estimated that, in addition to
better quality of care and patient outcomes, increasing
BSN RNs can be cost saving by improving patient out-
comes such as reducing readmissions (Yakusheva et al.,
2014).
Findings from our study have several implications for
accelerating the progress of achieving the goal of 80%
of RNs holding a baccalaureate degree. First, further ef-
forts are needed to promote national recognition of the
importance of advancing nursing education in health
care, as well as policy and financial support from federal,
state, and local government. Both findings from our study
and previous research have suggested that such support
can have a significant impact on the transformation of
the nursing workforce (Aiken, Cheung, & Olds, 2009).
Second, administrators in hospitals and other healthcare
facilities should commit to more investment in hiring
BSN RNs or support employed AND or Diploma RNs to
obtain a baccalaureate degree. Researchers have shown
that RN-to-BSN is the fastest growth pathway for RNs
to obtain a baccalaureate degree (e.g., a 10% increase
from 2013 to 2014) (AACN, 2015). It was also found
that in hospitals that provided tuition and other benefits
(e.g., more flexibility in scheduling) or value and respect
higher nursing education, RNs were more likely to en-
roll in RN-to-BSN programs (Spetz & Bates, 2013). Last
but not least, researchers need to provide more evidence
demonstrating the business case of having more BSN RNs
providing care to patients.
Our study has some limitations. Although the ND-
NQI collects data from a large sample of hospitals
nationwide, participation of hospitals in NDNQI data sub-
mission is voluntary. Therefore, hospitals with certain
characteristics may be overrepresented or underrepre-
sented. Specifically, there are a higher proportion of large
(>300 beds) and not-for-profit hospitals in our sample,
when compared to 2011 American Hospital Association
data (Choi, Boyle, & Dunton, 2014). In addition, only
data from NDNQI-affiliated hospitals were used; thus,
one should be cautious when generalizing the results
from this study to other hospitals or other healthcare
settings (e.g., nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and
home care agencies). Our projections of the proportion of
BSN RNs in acute care hospital units were based on the
current trends; thus, it is conservative.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study
using unit-level data from hospitals nationwide to exam-
ine the trends in BSN RNs over a decade (2004–2013).
Our findings provide unique insights into the current
ongoing
educational
transformation
of
the
nursing
workforce. Despite the significant increase in BSN RNs,
results from our study suggest that further efforts and
commitment from healthcare stakeholders (e.g., policy-
makers, executives and managers of healthcare facilities,
nursing schools, etc.) are needed to advance nursing
education and promote the use of BSN RNs, which in
turn will result in superior quality of care and better
patient outcomes as researchers have suggested.
