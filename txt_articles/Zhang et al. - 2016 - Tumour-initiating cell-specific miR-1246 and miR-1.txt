The tumour-initiating cell (TIC) model accounts for phenotypic and functional heterogeneity
among tumour cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory molecules frequently aberrantly
expressed in cancers, and may contribute towards tumour heterogeneity and TIC behaviour.
More recent efforts have focused on miRNAs as diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Here, we
identified the TIC-specific miRNAs, miR-1246 and miR-1290, as crucial drivers for tumour
initiation and cancer progression in human non-small cell lung cancer. The loss of either
miRNA impacted the tumour-initiating potential of TICs and their ability to metastasize.
Longitudinal analyses of serum miR-1246 and miR-1290 levels across time correlate their
circulating levels to the clinical response of lung cancer patients who were receiving ongoing
anti-neoplastic therapies. Functionally, direct inhibition of either miRNA with locked nucleic
acid administered systemically, can arrest the growth of established patient-derived xenograft
tumours, thus indicating that these miRNAs are clinically useful as biomarkers for tracking
disease progression and as therapeutic targets.

ung
cancer
is
the
deadliest
cancer
worldwide,
with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung
cancer accounting for B85 and 15% of the incidences,
respectively1. Despite advances in detection and improvements to
standard of care, NSCLC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage
and bears poor prognosis. Relapses are frequent after primary and
adjuvant therapy, often evolving into a lethal metastatic disease2.
These observations can, in part, be attributed to the highly
heterogeneous nature of lung tumours that contain distinct
tumoural and microenvironmental cell types, all of which
contribute
in
varying
degrees
toward
self-renewal,
drug
resistance, metastasis and relapse.
The tumour-initiating cell (TIC; also referred as cancer stem
cell) model provides one explanation for the phenotypic and
functional diversity among cancer cells in some tumours3. TICs
have been demonstrated to be more resistant to conventional
therapeutic interventions, and are key drivers of relapse and
metastasis4–6.
There
is,
therefore,
increasing
interests
in
developing strategies that can specifically target TICs with novel
and emerging therapeutic modalities, thereby halting cancer
progression and improving disease outcome7,8.
While significant efforts have focused on identifying agents and
inhibitors that can disrupt the function of proteins, such as
kinases and transcription regulators, necessary for TIC function,
another avenue involves understanding the contribution of
non-protein-coding molecules, and how they may be exploited
as diagnostic and therapeutic targets9,10. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
represent a class of therapeutic targets that have been shown
extensively to drive or inhibit cancer progression, and in some
instances, may also be utilized as non-invasive biomarkers11–14.
These findings, in part, resulted in the first miRNA mimic to
enter Phase I clinic trials in patients with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma15.
MiRNAs have been found to function as either proto-
oncogenes or tumour suppressors in almost all cancers through
their dysregulated expression16. For instance, miR-17B92 cluster
has been widely documented to promote tumour formation in a
variety of cancers17, whereas let-7 has shown conserved function
as a tumour suppressor in lung and other cancers18,19. A few
studies have begun to demonstrate the contribution of miRNAs
in TICs either using cultured human cell lines or mouse
models20–23, but these do not necessarily recapitulate their
bona fide function in human tumours which tend to be more
heterogeneous, and for which TICs can be better defined. Thus,
there is a need to adopt the use of patient-derived tumour models
and direct interrogation of patient materials for assessing the
contributions of miRNAs and their diagnostic value in cancer.
Certain miRNAs have been detected as circulating cell-free
molecules in the serum or plasma of cancer patients, and they
appear to be useful as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers
for disease progression24–26. However, real-time tracking of
circulating miRNAs level within individual patients across
different time points, and how the levels impact their clinical
response to ongoing therapy, has not been demonstrated, to the
best of our knowledge.
In this study, we focused on dissecting the role of TIC-specific
miRNAs that are found enriched in primary human lung
tumours and their contribution towards disease progression and
therapy response. We utilized lung TICs that were directly
isolated from primary tumours and patient-derived tumour-
spheres to first identify and functionalize the previously poorly
characterized miRNAs, miR-1246 and miR-1290, and demon-
strated their crucial roles in tumour initiation and metastasis.
We were able to track the circulating levels of both miRNAs in
patients during the course of treatment to understand their
response to ongoing therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated the
impact on tumour growth following the ablation of these
miRNAs with locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitors, thus
underscoring anti-miRNA strategies to be a viable therapeutic
modality, at least, for NSCLCs.
Results
Identification of miRNAs restricted to TICs in NSCLC. To
uncover miRNAs which are major regulators of lung TICs, we
took advantage of our previous findings that patient-derived
tumourspheres and CD166 þ lung primary tumour cells are
enriched for TICs27. Consistent with earlier data, we confirmed
that patient-derived tumourspheres and CD166 þ tumour cells
were tumorigenic even when transplanted subcutaneously into
mice at low cell numbers, whereas CD166 � tumour cells and two
normal human primary lung epithelial cell lines (NHBE, human
bronchial epithelial cells; and small airway epithelial cells
(SAEC)) were completely devoid of this ability (Fig. 1a). To
exclude non-tumour cells, we sorted for cells that were EPCAM þ
carcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Limiting dilution
cell transplantation analysis for tumour initiation showed that
as few as 500 CD166 þ
cells could be serially propagated
in immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG)
mice,
whereas

CD166 �
cells
had
no

to

tumours
in
serial
transplantation
assays
performed
subcutaneously
(Fig.
1b).
These
data
confirmed
both
tumourspheres and CD166 þ tumour cells to be enriched for
TICs. To profile the miRNA expression from lung TICs and their
differentiated
progenies,
which
are
non-tumour
initiating,
miRNA microarray was performed (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
We first identified miRNAs which were enriched in CD166 þ
TICs relative to CD166 � non-TICs (n ¼ 3), and intersected these
with miRNAs enriched in patient-derived tumourspheres relative
to normal NHBE and SAEC. This method, utilizing two distinct
manners of purifying for TICs, enabled us to robustly identify a
conserved set of miRNAs which were exclusive to TICs but not
non-TICs (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1).
The top downregulated lung TIC-associated miRNAs include
miR-23a,
miR-130a,
let-7
family,
miR-513a-5p,
miR-125b
and miR-29a, whereas the top upregulated miRNAs include
miR-1290, miR-130b, miR-1246, miR-630, miR-196a/b, miR-9/9*
and miR-17B92 cluster and its miR-106bB25 analogues.
Consistent with other studies, reduced let-7 miRNA family
expression, which is associated with significantly shorter cancer
patient survival, was found in TICs18,28. Similarly, miR-23a and
miR-130a were shown to be downregulated in chronic myeloid
leukaemia29, and miR-29a/b/c was frequently reduced in a variety
of cancers that include lung cancer30. Conversely, upregulation of
miR-17B92 cluster and its paralogues miR-106bB25, which
were elevated in lung TICs, was found in several other cancers31,
as
these
miRNAs
promoted
the
rapid
proliferation
and
undifferentiated phenotype of lung epithelial progenitor cells, as
well as playing a role in embryonic lung development32,33. Other
miRNAs that include miR-130b, miR-196a/b and miR-9/9*,
similarly, were found to contribute towards the progression of
other cancer types34–36.
From the compendium of candidate miRNAs, which were
validated by quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR; Supplementary
Fig. 1c), at least several of these miRNAs have not been previously
implicated in TIC function and oncogenesis. We chose to focus
on miR-1246 and miR-1290 because they represent the topmost
upregulated miRNAs among our TIC miRNA signature, and
could be important drivers for cancer progression. Using another
independent lung cancer patient cohort for which we generated
tumourspheres, and also purified for CD166 þ cells, we indeed
confirmed miR-1246 and miR-1290 expression to be elevated
more than fivefold in CD166 þ TICs, and increased 6 and

 30 times, respectively, in the corresponding patient-derived
tumourspheres when compared with either normal lung epithelial
cells or CD166 � non-TICs (Fig. 1d).
Because our initial evidence suggested that miR-1246 and miR-
1290 could be restricted to lung TICs, we first sought to examine
their expression patterns within human lung tumours as this
serves to provide a clinically relevant context for studying their
function. To broadly demonstrate the expression and specificity
of certain miRNAs to NSCLC carcinoma cells, we analysed their
levels in matched lung tumours and adjacent non-neoplastic
tissues of the same individuals (n ¼ 11 pairs) by qRT–PCR using
miR-16, miR-92 and miR-26b as endogenous controls that
remained
unaltered
between
tumour
and
normal
tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). Both miR-1246 and miR-1290 showed
consistent upregulation in tumours compared with their adjacent
non-neoplastic tissues (Po0.01 for miR-1246, Po0.01 for
miR-1290 by unpaired t-test; Fig. 1e). More importantly, the
comparative expression of other miRNA candidates such as
miR-130b, miR-23a and miR-125b, which were initially found to
be also enriched in TICs, did not provide strong evidence that
they were restricted to tumours, whereas miR-1246 and miR-1290
did (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Similarly, by analysing the miRNA
sequencing-based expression of a far larger cohort of paired
tumour and adjacent tissues deposited in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA), we observed a highly significant elevation of
miR-1246 in tumour samples, relative to adjacent tissues (Fig. 1f
and Supplementary Table 2).
We next assessed whether the expression of miR-1246 and
miR-1290 might be heterogeneous among the tumours of
different NSCLC patients, and the implications for disease
outcome. By in situ-hybridization (ISH) assay on tissue micro-
arrays from a cohort of 143 patients (n ¼ 197 tumour cores;
Fig. 1g), miR-1246 expression negatively correlated with patient
survival (P ¼ 0.016 by log-rank test), while miR-1290 had a
weaker correlation (P ¼ 0.082 by log-rank test; Fig. 1h and
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Patients bearing tumours with
higher miR-1246 expression, as assessed by staining intensity,
showed elevated subdistribution hazard ratio compared with
those harbouring tumours with lower miR-1246 expression
(2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.22–6.66) (Fig. 1h). We further
sought to verify the above findings with another cohort of lung
cancer patients, this time analysing the miRNA-sequencing data
set from TCGA. Consistently, higher miR-1246 or miR-1290
expression in tumours was associated with shorter patient
survival periods (P ¼ 0.007 and P ¼ 0.024 by log-rank test,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. 1f,g).
Since we initially found miR-1246 to be enriched in flow
cytometry purified CD166 þ cells, we proceeded to verify whether
the miRNA was also found within TICs present in patient tumour
sections. To compare the cellular expression of miR-1246 and
CD166 protein, ISH and immunohistochemistry were first
performed separately on serial sections of both malignant and
normal lung tissues. Mir-1246 was strongly localized to the
cytoplasm and nucleus in tumour cells, while remained weak
or undetectable in most of the normal lung epithelial cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
1h).
Similarly,
CD166
positivity
was
predominately detected in the cytoplasm and cell membrane in
tumour cells and almost absent in normal lung tissues (Fig. 1i and
Supplementary Table 5). To directly correlate the expression
pattern of miR-1246 with CD166, we combined ISH and
immunohistochemistry on the same tissue or tumour section.
MiR-1246 expression was predominantly restricted to CD166 þ
cells in primary NSCLC tumours, and largely absent in CD166 �
tumour cells and normal lung epithelial cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2a). w2-Analysis in NSCLC tissues showed a strong
correlation between the intensity of miR-1246 expression and
miR-1290 expression by ISH (Po0.001 by Student’s t-test;
Supplementary Fig. 2b).
MiR-1246 and miR-1290 confer tumorigenicity. The highly
enriched expression of miR-1246 and miR-1290 in lung CD166 þ
TICs, but not in CD166 � cells and normal lung epithelial cells,
strongly suggests these two miRNAs to be crucial for tumour
initiation and establishment. To test this, we utilized highly
specific miRZip lentiviral anti-miR-1246 and anti-miR-1290 to
knockdown miR-1246 and miR-1290 in lung tumourspheres and
assessed their tumorigenic potential in cell cultures and in mice.
Dissociated tumourspheres were initially plated on either soft
agar or 2D adherent cell cultures—assays which select for the
growth of bulk cancer cells, including differentiated cancer cell
populations. Interestingly, this resulted only in a small decrease
in colony numbers, indicating that the loss of miR-1246 and
miR-1290 did not impact cell growth and proliferation under
these cell culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). However,
when tumourspheres bearing either miR-1246 or miR-1290
knockdown were subjected to extended periods of culture in
serum-free sphere-forming condition that selects for TICs and
stem cells, their numbers were markedly reduced by at least
5.4-fold (Fig. 2a). In a limiting dilution assay, sphere-formation
efficiency was consistently reduced when 500, 150 and 50 cells
were plated (Fig. 2b). When tumourspheres were transplanted
into immune-compromised mice, those bearing knockdown of
either miR-1246 or miR-1290 alone markedly inhibited tumour
growth (Fig. 2c,d). To confirm that the loss of miR-1246 or
miR-1290 impacted tumour initiation, we transplanted TS cells
that were knocked down for either miRNA in limiting dilution
cell numbers. While control-treated TS cells continued to form
tumours with 100 cells, zip1246- or zip1290-treated cells were
severely inhibited in their tumour initiation capability when 2,000
cells were transplanted, and were completely ablated of this ability
with 100 cells, thus underscoring the role of these miRNAs in
tumour initiation (Fig. 2e).
Because lung TICs and cancer progression were dependent on
miR-1246 or miR-1290, we assessed whether these miRNAs could
confer tumorigenic potential to otherwise normal-like or non-
tumorigenic cells. Exogenous introduction of either miR-1246 or
miR-1290 into immortalized human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK293) modestly increased proliferation and colony formation
in vitro (Fig. 2f–h and Supplementary Fig. 3e), but surprisingly,
was able to confer on these otherwise non-tumorigenic cells and
their tumorigenic potential, as gauged by the ability of the
miRNA-bearing cells to form tumours efficiently (Fig. 2i). In all,
66.7% (4/6) and 88.3% (5/6) of mice bearing miR-1246- and
miR-1290-overexpressing
HEK293
cells,
respectively,
grew
tumours, whereas none of the mice transplanted with control-
treated cells formed tumours. To test the oncogenic potential of
miRNAs in more physiologically relevant cell systems, we
introduced either miR-1246 or miR-1290 into immortalized
human lung epithelial cells (NuLi-1). The overexpression of either
miRNAs increased soft-agar colony formation in vitro, but could
not initiate tumours even when 1 � 106 cells were xenografted
into NSG mice (Fig. 2j–l). This indicates that the miRNAs
could drive neoplastic transformation of normal-like lung cells
in vitro but did not confer full tumorigenic potential. More
strikingly, overexpression of either miR-1246 or miR-1290 in
non-tumorigenic CD166 �
cancer cells was able to confer
tumorigenic ability, as demonstrated by the formation of tumours
when 100,000 cells were transplanted (Fig. 2m).
MiR-1246 and miR-1290 are required for lung cancer metastasis.
More recent findings have indicated that subpopulations of

 carcinoma cells, which bear properties of TICs, help seed
metastases at distant organs37,38. This led us to wonder whether
miR-1246 and miR-1290 could confer metastatic traits to lung
tumour cells. We first assessed the expression of these miRNAs in
cancer cells that metastasized to either the lymph node or distant
organs. To determine the correlation between miRNA expression
levels in primary tumours and lymph node metastasis, we
performed ISH for the miRNAs in paired primary lung tumours
and corresponding lymph nodes (n ¼ 143 patients). Primary
tumours that contain high miR-1246 or miR-1290 expression
tended to correlate with the detection of metastatic tumour cells
within lymph nodes, whereas those expressing low levels of the
miRNAs did not (Fig. 3a,b). Hence, there was a strong association
between expression of these miRNAs in primary tumour and
lymph node metastasis (P ¼ 0.024 and P ¼ 0.001 by Student’s
t-test, respectively). Of note, however, we did not observe a strong
correlation for the miRNA expression levels between primary
tumours and incidence of distant metastases; this is likely

 attributed to the very few cases of paired tumour and distant
metastases we were able to obtain. Overall, the results suggest that
miR-1246 and miR-1290 could contribute towards the metastatic
abilities of lung tumour cells.
To test the migratory and invasive roles of these miRNAs in
tumourspheres, we first performed transmembrane migration
and matrigel invasion assays for dissociated tumoursphere cells.
Both
the
migration
(Fig.
3c,d)
and
invasion
capabilities
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b) were markedly impaired on knock-
down of either miR-1246 (zip1246) or miR-1290 (zip1290), thus
suggesting that the miRNAs were necessary for the invasion, at
least in vitro. We further sought to examine whether miR-1246
and miR-1290 were indeed directly mediating the metastasis of
lung TICs in animal models. We initially performed experimental
metastasis analyses by directly introducing the same number of
tumoursphere cells containing zip1246, zip1290 or zip-control,
into the lungs of immune-compromised NSG mice through
tail-vein injection; this allowed us to examine their extravasation
and colonization abilities—key stages of the metastatic cascade.
After 5 weeks, metastatic nodules in the lungs and liver
were markedly reduced on knockdown of either miR-1246 or
miR-1290
in
tumoursphere
cells
before
tail-vein
injection
(Fig. 3e–j and Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Subsequently, we transplanted tumoursphere cells expressing
either zip1246 or zip1290 subcutaneously into NSG mice to
determine their impact on spontaneous metastasis from primary
tumours. Consistent with previous findings, transplanting large
numbers of tumoursphere cells (1 � 106), which contained either
zip1246 or zip1290, gave rise to tumours that were reduced in size
relative to control-treated cells. The latter cells seeded metastatic
lung nodules efficiently 60 days post-transplantation, whereas
miRNA-knockdown cells were deficient in this regard (Fig. 3k
and Supplementary Fig. 4d). However, owing to differences in
size of primary tumours arising from treated and control cells, it
could be likely that larger tumours are more capable of
disseminating metastatic cells. To account for this difference,
we calculated the metastatic index, which normalizes the number
of metastatic nodules to the size of primary tumours. The
metastatic index was indeed four to eight times lower in mice
containing tumoursphere cells expressing either zip1246 or
zip1290, relative to control-treated cells (Fig. 3k). Alternatively,
we allowed zip1246- and zip1290-expressing tumoursphere cells
to form tumours, over a prolonged period of time, until they were
approximately similar in size to control tumours (12 mm in
diameter), and subsequent examined the number of metastatic
lung nodules. The number of lung nodules in control groups was
five to nine times more than those in groups containing either
zip1246 or zip1290, given similar tumour burden (Fig. 3l). In
human lung cancer patient cohorts, gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) demonstrated a positive correlation between metastasis
incidence and miR-1246 or miR-1290 expression in a variety
of patient solid tumours that included lung adenocarcinoma
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Collectively, our data indicated that
miR-1246 and miR-1290 play pivotal roles in mediating the
spontaneous
metastasis
of
primary
tumour
cells.
This
is
consistent with the notion that highly aggressive tumours tend
to contain an enriched population of TICs, which can augment
tumour growth and metastasis39.
Circulating miRNAs levels correlate with therapy response.
Circulating cell-free miRNAs have been reported in patients
harbouring ovarian cancer, melanoma and lymphoma40–42. The
levels of certain miRNAs appear to be predictive of survival
outcomes26. In the vast majority of these studies, circulating
miRNAs of different cancer patients and normal individuals are
compared, typically at a single time point. Furthermore, in
instances
where
circulating
miRNA levels
were correlated
with therapy response, the measurements are obtained from
different individuals, thereby confounding analyses. The direct
contribution of miRNA levels to disease progression and therapy
resistance remains unclear. Here, we performed a longitudinal
survey of circulating miR-1246 and miR-1290 in the same
individuals to assess variation in their levels in response to
ongoing EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, which
is a standard of care for NSCLC patients with tumours
harbouring mutant EGFR. We first examined the serum levels
of miR-1246 and miR-1290 from NSCLC patients and healthy
individuals (n ¼ 124) by qRT–PCR. MiR-1246 and miR-1290
levels increased 11.3 times and 12.8 times, respectively, in stage
I–III
NSCLC
patients
compared
with
healthy
individuals,
as expected (Fig. 4a).
To understand changes in the levels of miRNAs in response to
therapy for the same individuals, we recruited a small cohort of
late-stage lung cancer patients who were assigned to receive
EGFR TKI, and in some cases that progressed on EGFR TKI, with
subsequent follow-up radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The base-
line levels of circulating cell-free miRNA levels were ascertained
before treatment and tracked at several time-points during the
course of treatment. On recruitment, tumour sizes on computed
tomography (CT) scan were determined using RECIST 1.1. In
general, we were able to categorize patients into four subgroups,
depending on the pattern of clinical response to treatment, based
on either changes in the tumour size or the detection of
metastatic disease. Group 1 (n ¼ 6) comprised of patients who
initially responded to therapy, but later progressed as a result of
tumour re-growth or occurrence of metastasis. Lung tumours in
Patient 2 and 8, for instance, shrank rapidly by as much as
29–56% shortly following therapy, indicating that they were
initially responders (Fig. 4b). During this response period,
serum levels of miR-1246 and miR-1290 reduced by 69–87%
and
63–90%,
respectively.
For
these
individuals,
however,
disease progressed; this is indicated by either tumour re-growth
(Patient 2) or brain metastasis (Patient 8) despite continued
EGFR TKI treatment. Concomitant increases in the serum
miR-1246 and miR-1290 could be detected, thus suggesting their
levels to be indicative of the patients’ response to therapy.
In Group 2 (n ¼ 3), patients did not respond to therapy from the
onset, as determined by continued tumour growth or the
detection of metastasis. In these individuals, levels of both
miRNAs progressively increased during the course of the disease,
resulting in treatment being withdrawn subsequently (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Table 6). Group 3 consisted of a single individual
(Patient 220), who had stable disease, and no change in the serum
levels of miR-1246 or miR-1290 was detected (Fig. 4d).
In Group 4 (n ¼ 5), patients initially had disease progression
but subsequently responded to therapy. All these patients received
EGFR TKI as a first line of treatment, and either chemo- or
radiotherapy as the second line of treatment. As an example,
Patient 218 progressed on EGFR TKI as tumour grew by 41%
on day 86; this was mirrored by increases in miR-1246 and
miR-1290 levels. On switching to chemotherapy, the tumour
shrank by 59% and the levels of both miRNAs were, similarly,
reduced (Fig. 4e). Patient 219, similarly, showed marked tumour
growth and occurrence of brain metastasis while on EGFR TKI,
but later responded to whole-brain radiotherapy as measured by
the reduction in tumour size (Fig. 4e). In this example, the levels
of miR-1246 appeared to better mirror the response of patient to
therapy than that of miR-1290. Of note, for the vast majority
of patients in all four groups, serum levels of miR-1246 and
miR-1290 showed a positive correlation with tumour size as well
(Fig. 4b,c,e). Thus, our data suggest that serum miRNAs correlate

 well with the response of patients to ongoing therapy. This
strategy of utilizing circulating miRNA levels as a surrogate for
assessing disease progression status may, quite possibly, be more
sensitive and predictive of metastasis that may not be readily
detected in CT scans (Fig. 4b–e and Supplementary Table 6).
While CT scans remain diagnostically useful in most instances,
they are of limited therapeutic benefit, hence, leading us to
explore if targeting miRNAs might be beneficial.
LNA-targeting miRNAs arrest PDX tumour growth. Because
tumours appear to depend on miR-1246 and miR-1290 to
progress, we reasoned that the inhibition of these miRNAs might
impact their growth. We made use of LNA that can be
administered into animals and silences specific miRNAs in a
highly selective manner. This strategy has been experimentally
tested in mice and non-human primates for the treatment of
several diseases43, and more recently, it has been applied in
clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis C15. We first evaluated
the utility of LNA against miR-1246 or miR-1290 in cell cultures
by transfecting them into lung TICs expressing high levels of both
miRNAs. Inhibition of either miR-1246 or miR-1290 significantly
reduced their respective expression (Fig. 5a). To assess their
therapeutic utility in a physiologically relevant manner, LNAs
against
either
miR-1246
or
miR-1290
were
introduced
intraperitoneally into NSG mice bearing patient-derived lung
tumour xenografts. LNA (8 mg kg � 1) against either miR-1246 or
miR-1290 was administered at the same time as lung TIC
implantation (1 � 105 cells). This not only delayed the onset of
lung TIC-driven tumorigenesis, but also inhibited the long-term
growth of xenograft tumours (Fig. 5b,c). Even when a lower dose
of 2 mg kg � 1 was introduced, the delay of tumour initiation
and reduction in growth was, similarly, observed (Fig. 5b,c).
To directly assess the impact of LNAs on tumour initiation, we
treated mice transplanted with limiting dilution number of TS
cells. As expected, 100,000 xenografted cells continued to form
tumours, albeit smaller and delayed, with LNA administration
(8 mg kg � 1).
The
LNA,
however,
completely
abrogated
tumour-initiation when 100 cells were transplanted, thereby
demonstrating the in vivo impact of blocking miR-1246 and
miR-1290 on tumour initiation (Fig. 5d). To ascertain the impact
of anti-miR-1246 and anti-miR-1290 LNA on pre-existing
tumours, we first allowed tumours to form (5 mm in length)
before treating mice with 8 mg kg � 1 LNA at 3–4-day intervals.
The outgrowth of tumours in the LNA-treated mice was largely
inhibited, whereas control-treated mice continued to form large
tumours, thereby indicating the therapeutic utility of silencing
miR-1246 and miR-1290 in established tumours (Fig. 5e,f). Since
the loss of each miRNA, on its own, was capable of reducing the
tumorigenic ability of TS cells, we test if the combined inhibition
of both miRNAs would demonstrate a more severe impact.
Indeed,
the
concomitant
administration
of
LNAs
against
miR-1246 and miR-1290 in mice bearing the pre-established
tumours could result in a greater inhibition of tumour growth,
and suggested the utility of targeting both miRNAs together
(Fig. 5f).
A potential confounding challenge with therapeutic agents,
including LNA, is animal toxicity, which can undermine their
utility44. To understand whether LNA targeting miR-1246 or
miR-1290 would produce adverse side-effects in mice, we profiled
the dynamic changes in albumin levels, as well as alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
activities, in mouse serum at different time points following LNA
therapy at 8 mg kg � 1. The levels of albumin and activities of ALT
and AST were, in fact, comparable to the sham-treated animals,
thus indicating that the LNA, as a therapeutic agent, did not
result in overt or measurable toxicity, at least, to the liver
(Fig. 5g). This was further confirmed by the histological
examination of liver sections obtained from the LNA-treated
mice that did not show observable difference compared with
control
animals
(Fig.
5h).
Taken
altogether,
our
results
demonstrated that miR-1246 and miR-1290 contribute towards
lung cancer progression through acting on TIC populations, and
more importantly, we provided a proof-of-concept principle that
LNA approaches can be used to impact the behaviour of TICs by
targeting miRNAs crucial for their function.
MT1G is a target of miR-1246 and miR-1290 that inhibit TICs.
Because miRNAs are well-known to regulate the activities of
downstream targets, which in turn, control the behaviour of a cell,
we sought to identify genes that might be directly targeted by
miR-1246 or miR-1290. To do so, we performed whole-tran-
scriptome analyses after knocking down miR-1246 or miR-1290
in A549, a metastatic lung cancer cell line, which expressed high
levels of the miRNAs, as well as after overexpressing miR-1246 or
miR-1290 in NHBE, a normal lung epithelial cell line not
expressing the miRNAs. The upregulated genes on knockdown
were intersected with genes downregulated on overexpression for
each miRNA perturbation to gather a list of candidate mRNAs
that could potentially be regulated by either miRNA. We further
validated these targets by qRT–PCR (Fig. 6a,b). Genes repressed
by miR-1246 include PRL36A, GLIPR1, HAS2, NCKAP5, MT1G
and CYP4F11, whereas miR-1290 represses MT1G, MT1H,
GLIPR1, CYP4F11 and NCKAP5, among others. A few of the top
target genes, such as MT1G and GLIPR1 were, in fact, common
targets of both miR-1246 and miR-1290, thus suggesting that they
may play an important role in mediating the function of lung
cancer cells. Because the regulation of these gene expressions
might be attributed to the indirect, secondary effects of
miRNA perturbations, a computational approach to validate the
interaction between miRNAs and their targets was taken. Using
seed sequence base-pairing analyses, we detected the duplex
formations between human miR-1246 and miR-1290 with the
30-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs that include MT1G
(Fig. 6c), thereby highlighting the propensity of both miRNAs to
target a common gene.
We chose to focus on understanding the role of MT1G in
lung TICs for several reasons. First, MT1G belongs to the
metallothionein family of cysteine-rich metalloproteins which
bind heavy metals. Metallothionein expression was reduced in
several types of cancers, including lung cancer and hepatocellular
carcinoma45,46. MT1/2-knockout mice manifested an increased
propensity for carcinogenesis47,48. Second, in a cohort of NSCLC
patients with paired tumour and normal tissues (n ¼ 9), MT1G
was strongly expressed in normal tissues but markedly reduced in
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Third, transcriptome analysis
comparing tumourspheres and CD166 þ
tumour cells with
normal CD166 þ lung epithelial cells and CD166 � tumour
cells clearly placed MT1G among the top downregulated genes27
(Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). Of genes in the metallothionein family,
MT1G was the most highly suppressed in lung TICs (Fig. 6d).
To confirm MT1G as a direct target of miR-1246 and
miR-1290, we cloned its wild-type 30-UTR, as well as made
point mutations, and tagged them to a luciferase reporter vector.
On co-transfection of either miR-1246 or miR-1290 together
with wild-type MT1G 30-UTR reporters into HEK293 cells, the
luciferase activities were reduced significantly (Fig. 6e). No
change was observed for mutant MT1G 30-UTR reporter.
Conversely, knockdown of miR-1246 or miR-1290 in tumour-
spheres increased luciferase activity of wild-type MT1G 30-UTR
but not the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6d).

 Similar to the expression patterns of miR-1246, miR-1290
and CD166, we also observed heterogeneous expression of
metallothioneins within human lung tumour sections. Here,
we assessed the total levels of all metallothioneins because
an antibody
specific
to MT1G
was not available. While
metallothioneins were abundant in normal lung tissues, their
expression were varied across different adenocarcinomas, ranging
from low to high (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Table 7).
Interestingly, well-differentiated tumours tended to express
higher levels of metallothioneins, whereas poorly differentiated
tumours did not. We then sought to correlate the expression of
metallothioneins, which was classified as low or high based on
immunohistochemistry, with either miR-1246 or CD166 protein
level in a cohort of patient tumours. metallothioneins expression
was inversely correlated with both miR-1246 (Fig. 6g) and CD166
expression (Fig. 6h), providing an indication that metallothionein
expression was repressed in lung TICs which tend to express the
miR-1246 and CD166.
The above data indicated MT1G might have a role in the
inhibition of tumour-initiation or metastasis. To test this,
MT1G was first overexpressed in lung tumourspheres by
lentiviral infection (Fig. 6i). Their abilities to form colonies on
adherent cultures and on soft agar were inhibited markedly on
MT1G overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Their migration

 also reduced significantly, as expected (Fig. 6k). To further test
whether MT1G controls metastasis independent of tumour size,
we introduced MT1G-expressing tumourspheres or control cells
directly into the lung through tail-vein injection. The number
of metastatic nodules was indeed reduced in the mice injected
with MT1G-expressing tumourspheres relative to control cells
(Fig. 6l). Interestingly, in mice bearing xenografted tumours
that were treated with anti-miR-1246 or anti-miR-1290 LNAs
(Fig. 5e), these small residual tumours had increased metallo-
thionein protein level (Supplementary Fig. 7e). It remains,
however,
unclear
whether
these
contained
differentiated
non-TICs that are resistant to the TIC-specific LNAs, or the
inhibition of miRNAs de-repressed the inhibition of MT1G
expression. Clinically, in NSCLC patients, lower metallothionein
protein expression was associated with regional lymph node
invasion (P ¼ 0.025 by w2-test) and distant metastasis (P ¼ 0.047
by w2-test; Supplementary Fig. 7f). These results are consistent
with previous findings on the function of metallothioneins in
other cancers49,50.
If MT1G was a major target of both miRNAs, we tested
whether MT1G overexpression could counter the effect of
miR-1246 or miR-1290 expression. We first treated NuLi-1 cells
with pre1246 or pre1290 and this led to an increase in their
sphere-forming
ability,
as
expected
(Fig.
6m).
However,
in a separate experiment, when the cells were simultaneously
overexpressing MT1G, their sphere-forming ability was inhibited.
Conversely, we also investigated the mechanistic regulation
of MT1G and the miRNAs in TS cells. Knocking down
either miR-1246 or miR-1290 markedly reduced the tumour-
sphere-forming ability of TS cells as anticipated (Fig. 6n).
The
concomitant
depletion
of
MT1G
in
miR-1246-
or
miR-1290-depleted cells could, at least in part, rescue the effect
of miRNA loss. Finally, the transplantation of these treated cells
in limiting cell numbers into NSG mice clearly showed that the
TS cells containing MT1G knock down remain tumorigenic even
in the presence of miR-1246 or miR-1290 loss, thus confirming
MT1G to be their major target (Fig. 6o). Taken altogether, our
results indicate that miR-1246 and miR-1290, which are enriched
in TICs, have critical roles in regulating tumour growth and
metastasis, in part, through the repression of metallothioneins,
especially MT1G.
Discussion
An attractive notion for the more effective treatment of cancer is
the use of combination therapies which target specific cell
populations within a heterogeneous tumour51–54. Mounting
evidence has pointed to TICs as being crucial drivers of tumour
initiation, growth, metastasis and resistance4,5,55–57, and one
needs to ablate TICs in addition to treating bulk tumour
cells58–60. Using an unbiased approach to uncover TIC-specific
miRNAs from patient-derived tumour cells and tumourspheres,
we identified a miRNA signature containing two miRNAs,
miR-1246 and miR-1290, both of which contribute towards
tumour initiation and metastasis. Although miR-1246 and
miR-1290 expression are restricted to TICs, it remains unclear
whether they are also associated with tumour grades. In one small
cohort
of
NSCLC
patients
(n ¼ 143,
National
University
Hospital), the miRNA expressions appear correlated to tumour
stage (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). However, in another
cohort of patients (n ¼ 397, TCGA data set, Supplementary
Fig. 1f), there is no clear correlation (Supplementary Fig. 1g).
Thus far, very little information is known regarding the link
between TIC frequency with tumour grade, metastasis, therapy
resistance or clinical outcome. This is an important question that
could shed more light on the biological significance of TIC
abundance to disease processes.
While we identified the putative tumour suppressor, MT1G, as
a common target for miR-1246 and miR-1290, one could not
exclude the possibility that other miRNA target genes could also
contribute towards the inhibition of tumorigenicity. Since
miRNAs are well-known to exert pleiotropic effects on a variety
of gene targets, it is arguably more effective to inhibit miRNAs,
owing to their potential for silencing other additional endogenous
target mRNAs, as in the case of miR-1246 and miR-1290.
Previous studies have suggested MT1G to be involved in tumour
suppression
in
colorectal
cancer,
hepatocellular
carcinoma
and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where its loss of expression
appears
to
be
epigenetically
regulated
such
as
through
promoter
hypermethylation46,61–63.
MT1G
also
contributes
towards chemoresistance. Overexpression of the MT1G isoform
sensitizes colorectal cell lines to the chemotherapeutic agents in
part through enhancing p53 and repressing NF-kB activity, but
the precise connection for the mechanistic role of MT1G leading
to the activation of p53, or in regulating other pathways, remains
largely elusive61.
Because miR-1246 and miR-1290 can confer tumorigenic
properties, we sought to determine whether they might also
be found enriched in other cancers, compared with their
corresponding normal tissue. Interestingly, across the major
types of cancers that include breast, colon, and head and neck,
both miRNAs are strongly upregulated in tumours relative to
their normal counterparts (Supplementary Figs 8 and 9 and
Supplementary Tables 2 and 8–10). It is, however, unclear if these
miRNAs are restricted to the TIC compartments of these
tumours, or could have broader roles in bulk tumour cell
populations as well. Nonetheless, our observations indicate
miR-1246 and miR-1290 can behave as non-invasive biomarkers
that may be exploited for the early detection of a broad spectrum
of cancers (Supplementary Fig. 10). We noted from our normal
tissue microarray data that the skin, oesophagus, nerve and liver
were main tissue compartments that also expressed these
miRNAs; this raises the possibility of toxic side-effects on these
tissues (Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). However, we did not observe
alteration to the skin, changes in appetite or the body weight of
mice treated with the LNAs. Notwithstanding, the pharmaco-
dynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of anti-miR LNAs will
need to be more rigorously evaluated for assessing their potential
as a viable therapeutic strategy.
Methods
Patients and samples collection. Eligible patients were pathologically confirmed
with the diagnosis of NSCLC. The solid tumours or serum were collected from
patients according to protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of the National
University of Singapore. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. Serum
from stage I–III patients with NSCLC and healthy individuals was collected for
serum miRNA profiling. To correlate serum miRNAs levels with therapy response,
NSCLC patients at stage IIIB or IV, recruited as part of the NCT00809237 clinical
study, took both 250 mg gefitinib, in combination with 600 mg hydroxychloroquine
orally once daily, from the start of treatment to documented progression on CT
imaging. Blood was drawn at every 4 weeks during treatment. CT was performed
and documented in a blinded manner to monitor response to treatment according

 1 mg ml � 1 collagenase/dispase solution (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with 0.001%
DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and 2% antibiotics (Sigma) in a water bath
at 37 �C for 3 h. After incubation, the suspensions were passed through 70- and
40-mm cell-strainers (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) and centrifuged at 122g for 5 min at
4 �C. Cells were then resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA) for 4 min at room temperature with intermittent shaking. The cell
viability was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion. Live single cells accounted for
90% of the whole population.

mouse anti-human CD166 � phycoerythrin (FAB6561P) was derived from
R&D and anti-human EPCAM-FITC was derived from Miltenyi Biotech. For
immunohistochemistry staining, primary rabbit anti-human E-Cadherin (1:500,
cat #1702-1) was from Epitomics. Primary mouse anti-CD166 (1:50, clone
MOG/07, NCL-CD166) was purchased from Novocastra (Leica Biosystem).
Primary anti-human metallothionein (1:50, clone E9, M0639) was from Dako.

1:10,000, ab6721) were purchased from Abcam. For ISH, sheep anti-digoxigenin
(DIG)—alkaline phosphatase (AP; cat #11093274910) came from Roche.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For sorting, single-cell suspension was
incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotech) in ice for 20 min. Then the
cells were incubated with antibody against CD166 conjugated with phycoerythrin
(R&D), and antibodies against lineage markers (human CD45 and CD31). To
exclude dead cells, 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD PharminGen) was added before
sorting. Appropriate isotype antibodies were used as controls.
Plasmids. The MT1G 30-UTR sequence was cloned into the pEZX-MT01
firefly/Renilla Duo-Luciferase reporter vector (GeneCopoeia). The pmiRZip-1246
and pmiRZip-1290 in miRZip-copGFP lentiviral vector (System Biosciences) to
stably knockdown miR-1246 or miR-1290 expression was used following the
manufacturer’s instructions and contained the following shRNA sequence: 50-AAU
GGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG-30 or 50-UGGAUUUUUGGAUCAGGGA-30,
respectively. The pmiR-1246 and pmiR-1290 in pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP
(CD511B-1) lentiviral vector (System Biosciences) to stably overexpress miR-1246
or miR-1290 was used following the manufacturer’s instructions and contained the
following sequence: 50-AAUGGAUUUUUGGAGCAGG-30 or 50-UGGAUUUUU
GGAUCAGGGA-30, respectively. Precision pLOC-LentiORF-MT1G (OHS5899,
Open Biosystems) and empty vector control Precision pLOC-LentiORF RFP
(OHS5833) were used to overexpress MT1G. pTRIPZ inducible lentiviral shRNA
against MT1G and pTRIPZ empty vector were used to knockdown MT1G. The
sequences for shMT1G-1 and shMT1G-2 are 50-TATTATTCACATATTTCAC-30
and 50-TTTTGCACTTGCAGGAGCC-30, respectively. LNA inhibitors against
miR-1246 or miR-1290 (Exiqon) contained the following sequence: 50-TGCTCCA
AAAATCCAT-30 or 50-CCTGATCCAAAAATCC-30, respectively, and the
scramble LNA inhibitor control’s sequence was: 50-ACGTCTATACGCCCA-30.
Transient transfection and luciferase assay. PureFection (System Biosciences)
was used for transient transfection. In all, 100 ng of wild-type or mutant 30-UTR
reporter constructs of MT1G constructs (GeneCopoeia) were cotransfected with
100 ng of pCDH-miR-1246, pCDH-miR-1290, pmiRZip-1246, pmiRZip-1290 or
scrambled control vectors into HEK293 or tumoursphere cells. Firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured 48 h post-transfection using dual-luciferase
reporter system (Promega). The firefly luminescence was normalized to Renilla
luminescence as an internal control for transfection efficiency. MiR-1246- or
miR-1290-binding site 50-AAATC-30 was substituted with 50-TTTAG-30 in
mutated MT1G.
Microarray assay. Agilent Human miRNA Microarray Release 16.0, 8 � 60 K
(G4872A-031181, Agilent Technologies) was used to identify miRNAs expressed in
lung TICs. Total RNA (100 ng per sample) was hybridized to the microarrays.
We compared the miRNA expression profiles of tumour spheres, NSCLC
patient-derived CD166 þ and CD166 � xenograft tumour cells from three NSCLC
patients, as well as two normal lung epithelial cells, including NHBE and SAEC.
MiRNA labelling, hybridization washing, scanning, feature extraction and
application were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
All miRNA raw data were normalized based on the cross-correlation method65.
Significantly changed miRNAs were identified based on average fold change cutoff
of 1.5 and the cutoff of the P value cross all replicates at 0.05.
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) was used to identify the
genes upregulated in A549 knocking down miR-1246 or miR-1290, and genes
downregulated in NuLi-1 overexpressing miR-1246 or miR-1290. Total RNA
(200 ng per sample) was hybridized to the microarrays. Total RNA was converted
to double-stranded cDNA, followed by an amplification step to generate labelled
cRNA. The follwoing hybridization, image processing and raw data extraction were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All mRNA raw data were
normalized based on the cross-correlation method65. Significantly changed
mRNAs were identified based on average fold change cutoff of 1.5 and the cutoff of
the P value cross all replicates at 0.05.
MiR-1246 and miR-1290 targets prediction. Potential miR-1246 and miR-1290
targets were identified by using two sets of wide-transcriptome microarray profiles:
NuLi-1 relative to NuLi-1 cells overexpressing miR-1246 or miR-1290 (Illumina
humanHT12_V4), and A549 relative to A549 cells knocking down miR-1246 or
miR-1290 (Illumina humanHT12_V4). The following criteria were used to identify
the possible miR-1246 or miR-1290 target genes: (1) genes downregulated
41.5-fold on miR-1246 or miR-1290 overexpression in NuLi-1 cells, and (2) genes
upregulated 41.5-fold on miR-1246 or miR-1290 downregulation in A549 cells.
All potential targets were subsequently verified by qRT–PCR.
Isolation and quantification of circulating tumour miRNAs. Whole blood was
collected in red-topped tubes (BD). Blood was clotted by leaving it undisturbed at
room temperature for 30 min. The clot was removed by centrifugation at 1,000g for
10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Then the serum in the upper supernatant was
transferred immediately into a clean tube for circulating miRNA assays.
Real-time PCR for miRNAs and genes. Total RNA was extracted from solid
tissues and cultured cells using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) as well as
from serum using mirVana PARIS kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. MiRNA expression was assessed by Taqman MicroRNA assay,
and the gene expression of mRNAs was evaluated by Taqman Probes (Applied
Biosystems). Taqman miRNA probes were as follow: hsa-miR-1246 (462575_mat),
hsa-miR-1290 (002863), hsa-miR-130a (000454), hsa-miR-130b (000456),

(1006), miR-16 (000391), miR-26b (000407) and miR-92 (000430) (solid tissues),
or hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-374 (000563) (cultured cells), or hsa-miR-425-5p
(001516), hsa-RNU-48 and hsa-miR-16 (serum samples). Gene expression was
normalized to GAPDH. Each sample was run in triplicate for real-time PCR.
Sphere-formation assay. Single cells were resuspended in complete serum-free
media. It contains DMEM/F12 with 50 ng ml � 1 epidermal growth factor
(Invitrogen), 20 ng ml � 1 basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), 0.4% bovine
serum albumin (Sigma), 0.05 mg ml � 1 insulin–transferring–selenium and 1%
MEM non-essential amino acid (Gibco). Then cells were plated at 10,000 cells
per well in six-well non-treated cell culture plates (Nunc). Fresh medium was
replenished every 3 days. Tumourspheres were cultured for 10–14 days and then
quantified. For passaging, tumourspheres were digested into single cells using
accutase (Chemicon) and re-plated. For limiting dilution assay, 50, 150 and 500
of single cells were plated to assess sphere formation.
Colony-formation assay in plate and soft agar. Single cells were plated in 10-cm
dishes in triplicates with 1,000 cells per dish. Fresh medium was replenished every
3 days. The cells were incubated for 10 days followed by Giemsa (Sigma) staining.
The plates were air-dried and photographed, and the total number of colonies was
analysed by openCFU (http://opencfu.sourceforge.net)66.
For soft-agar colony formation, 500 live cells were mixed with 0.35% top-agar
and were plated onto 0.6% base-agar in six-well plates with triplicates. The cells
were incubated for 14–21 days followed by INT staining overnight. The plates
were photographed and the colony numbers were counted by Gelcount (Oxford
optonix).
Cell proliferation assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96-well plates with 400
HEK293 cells per well in four replicates on day 0. The cell viability was measured
every day using CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescent signal was recorded as
relative light units. The relative proliferation index on day 0 was normalized as 1.

 Cell migration and invasion assays. In vitro cell migration and invasion assay
were performed using Boyden chambers (BD bioscience) that use 8 mm micropore
membranes without Matrigel (for migration assay) or with Matrigel (for invasion
assay). Both assays were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cells were resuspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in DMEM/F12 medium
and seeded in the upper chamber at a concentration of 1 � 105/0.5 ml. The
chambers were incubated in the wells containing DMEM/F12 medium with 10%
FBS for 6 or 24 h. Filters were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with
Giemsa. The cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed by swabbing
with a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the reverse side were counted
in 10 random fields under a microscope (Zeiss) at 400 � magnification.
Lentiviral-mediated miRNA and MT1G overexpression or knockdown.
Lentivirus was produced in 293FT packaging cells and collected 48–72 h
post-infection. For lentiviral overexpression or knockdown of miR-1246 or
miR-1290, cells (tumoursphere, A549, NuLi-1 and HEK293) were infected with the
lentiviral supernatant for 48 h in the presence of 8 mg ml � 1 polybrene (Sigma).
Two days after infection, puromycin was added to the media at 1 mg ml � 1, and cell
populations were selected for 1–2 weeks. For lentiviral overexpression of MT1G,
cells (tumoursphere and HEK293) at 70% confluence were transduced with MT1G
lentiviral particles (1.64 � 109 TU ml � 1, Open Biosystems) or control lentiviral
particles (2 � 108 TU ml � 1, Open Biosystems) together with polybrene. Then
the infected cells were passaged and selected by blasticidin S (Invitrogen) at
12 mg ml � 1 for 1–2 weeks. For inducible lentiviral knockdown of MT1G,
tumoursphere cells at 70% confluence were transduced with two shRNAs against
MT1G lentiviral particles (Open Biosystems) or control lentiviral particles together
with polybrene. Then the infected cells were passaged, induced by 0.5 ug ml � 1
doxycycline and then selected by puromycin at 1 mg ml � 1 for 1–2 weeks.
Western blot. Cells were collected and lysed with Nonidet-P40 supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein concentrations of the extracts were
measured using BCA assay (Pierce) and equalized with the extraction reagent.
Equal amount of the extracts was loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:10,000,
ab6789) or rabbit IgG (1:10,000, ab6721) was used as secondary antibody and the
antigen-antibody reaction was visualized by Amersham ECL Prime detection
reagent (GE Healthcare). Uncropped Western Blot images are included in
Supplementary Fig. 11.
H&E and immunohistochemistry. Samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE), sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin (H&E)
according to standard histopathological techniques. For immunohistochemistry,
sections were incubated with anti-human CD166 (Novaocastra), E-cadherin
(Epitomics) and metallothioneins (Dako), and visualized using the Envision HRP
Polymer System (Dako). All images were captured on a high-throughput Leica
SCN400 scanner.
MiRNA ISH. ISH on tissue microarray sections from FFPE tissue sample with
human lung and other types of cancers was applied by using the miRCURY LNA
microRNA ISH Optimization kit 5. Five micrometer-thick tissue sections were
incubated with 15 mg ml � 1 proteinase K for 45 min at 37 �C. After washing, the
sections were incubated with 20 nM LNA probes (50-double-digoxigenin-labelled
LNA probes specific for human miR-1246 (50-cctgctccaaaaatccatt-30), miR-1290
(50-tccctgatccaaaaatcca-30) or scrambled probe (50-gtgtaacacgtctatacgccca-30)
(Exiqon)) in hybridization buffer (Roche) overnight at 55 �C. After stringent
washes, sections were blocked with 2% sheep serum and further incubated with
sheep anti-digoxigenin AP (Roche; 1:500) at room temperature for 2.5 h. Sections
were washed in PBS-T (0.1%) and miRNA-bound LNA probes were detected by
AP substrate (Roche) at room temperature for 1.5 h. After counterstaining with
Nuclear Fast Red (Vector laboratories), slides were mounted using mounting
medium (Eukitt). Image acquisition was performed with high-throughput Leica
SCN400 scanner and/or Olympus FluoView FV1000. LNA 50-digoxigenin-labelled
(50-cacgaatttgcgtgtcatcctt-30) U6 snRNA probe at 0.1 nM was used as positive
control.
For co-localization of miRNA-1246/miR-1290 and CD166 protein in FFPE
tissues, the sections were stained with LNA probe by ISH followed by
immunohistochemistry with anti-CD166 (Novaocastra).
Tissue microarray. A tissue microarray with regional lymph nodes, malignant and
cancer-adjacent normal lung specimens from NSCLC patients was constructed.
Tumour specimens were transferred to the Department of Pathology, National
University Hospital of Singapore within 1 h after surgical removal. Suitable areas
for tissue retrieval were marked on standard H&E sections, punched out of the
paraffin block and inserted into a recipient block. The punch diameter was 0.6 mm.
The tissue array was cut in 4-mm thick sections. Tissue microarrays including
multiple organs (FDA808b-1, 2 and BC00112) were purchased from Biomax.
MiR-1246, miR-1290 or metallothionein staining was independently scored by
two anatomical pathologists (M.E.N and Y.H.P). Staining intensity was scored
semi-quantitatively (score 0: undetectable; 1 þ : weak; 2 þ : moderate; 3 þ : strong)
and grouped as low (score 0) or high (scores 1 þ B3 þ ).
Transfection by LNAs in vitro. tumoursphere cells were plated at 3,000 cells in
serum-free medium in a 96-well non-treated plates to reach 50–60% confluence. In
all, 50 nM of LNA anti-miR-1246, anti-miR-1290 or negative control (Exiqon) with
fluorescine and PureFection (System Biosciences) were applied for transfection.
The transfected cells were collected after culturing for 40 h.
Animal studies. All research involving animals complied with protocols approved
by the A*STAR Biological Resource Centre Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Four to 6-week-old female NSG immunodeficient mice (Jackson
Laboratory) were used for subcutaneous injections, and 6–8-week-old female NSG
mice were used for tail-vein injections. For subcutaneous xenograft tumour assay
and/or spontaneous metastasis assay, 100 to 1 � 106 cells (CD166 þ and CD166 �
tumour cells, tumoursphere, HEK293 and NuLi-1) in serum-free medium and
Matrigel (BD; 1:1) were inoculated into the flank of NSG mice. The xenograft
tumour formation was monitored by calipers twice a week. The recipient mice were
monitored and killed when the tumours reached 2 cm in diameter, and thus the
metastases by tumoursphere cells were evaluated 60–90 days post transplantation.
The subcutaneous xengoraft tumours and the spontaneous metastasis into lung
were analysed under a dissecting microscope equipped with GFP fluorescence
imaging.
For the tail-vein assay of cancer metastasis, cells were inoculated intravenously
into 6–8-week-old female NSG mice, and both the lungs and the liver were
removed on the 13th, 27th and 33rd day post transplantation, and fixed with 10%
neutral-buffered formalin. Tumour metastasis was recorded by fluorescence
imaging. For quantitative analysis of metastasis, the metastatic lung nodules
40.4 mm were counted. Metastatic index was calculated as number of lung
nodules per mouse/volume of subcutaneous tumour.
LNA Synthesis and administration. Custom-made miRCURY LNAs for in vivo
application were designed and synthesized as unconjugated and fully phosphor-
othiolated oligonucleotides by Exiqon. The sequences of the LNA targeting
miR-1246 or miR-1290 were fully complementary to the mature miRNA sequence:
50-TGCTCCAAAAATCCAT-30 (LNA antimiR-1246) and 50-CCTGATCCAAAA
ATCC-30 (LNA antimiR-1290); the scrambled LNA control was 50-ACGTCTATA
CGCCCA-30 (LNA antimiR-ctrl). LNA was intraperitoneally delivered to mouse at
a dose of 2 or 8 mg kg � 1 body weight in 1 � PBS. At the beginning of tumour-
formation assay, mice were injected twice a week from day 0 on implantation of
1 � 105, 2,000 and 100 tumoursphere cells via subcutaneous injection and killed
49–90 days after LNA administration. In mice with established subcutaneous
xenograft tumours (5 mm in length), LNAs were administrated twice a week at
8 mg kg � 1 body weight for 19 days. Four mice were used in each group.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mouse serum albumin, ALT and
AST levels were measured at different time points after LNA treatment by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (USCN).
Data analysis. For survival analysis and GSEA, two lung tumour (LUAD and
LUSC) RNA-seq data sets were utilized from the TCGA data portal. The survival
analysis was based on the Kaplan–Meier method for two sample groups of low and
high miRNA expression. In segragation of patient samples into high and low
groups, normalization using the total numbers of mappable reads across all
samples was first performed. Then the miRNA mean expression as cutoff was
applied to segregate high- and low-expression samples. In addition, those middle
samples with expression close to the mean expression value were removed, since
they might be equally classified into either group. For identification of enriched
gene sets, GSEA was performed based on the normalized data and using GSEA
v2.07 tool (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/) with msigdb.v4.0.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean±s.e.m. Unless otherwise
stated, statistical significance was determined by a Student’s two-tailed t-test.
Po0.05 was considered statistically significant. The associations between
expressions of miRNAs or CD166 and metallothioneins were evaluated using
w2-test. The linear association between serum miRNAs levels and tumour size
was analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) by SigmaPlot 11.
