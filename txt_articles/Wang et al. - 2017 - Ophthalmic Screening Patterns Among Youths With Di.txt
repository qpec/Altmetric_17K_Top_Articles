 Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Ophthalmic screening to check for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is important to 
prevent vision loss in persons with diabetes. The American Academy of Ophthalmology 
recommends that ophthalmic screening for DR occur beginning at 5 years after initial diabetes 
diagnosis for youths with type 1 diabetes; the American Diabetes Association recommends 
screening of youths with type 2 diabetes at the time of initial diagnosis. To our knowledge, it is 
unknown to what extent youths with diabetes obtain eye examinations in accordance with these 
guidelines.
OBJECTIVE—To assess the rate of obtaining ophthalmic examinations and factors associated 
with receipt of eye examinations for youths with diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study 
examined youths 21 years or younger with newly diagnosed diabetes enrolled in a US managed 
care network from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Kaplan-Meier survival curves estimated the time 
from initial diabetes diagnosis to first eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models identified factors associated with 
receiving an ophthalmic examination after initial diabetes diagnosis.
RESULTS—Among 5453 youths with type 1 diabetes (median age at initial diagnosis, 11 years; 
interquartile range, 8–15 years; 2972 male [54.5%]; 4505 white [82.6%]) and 7233 youths with 
type 2 diabetes (median age at initial diagnosis, 19 years; interquartile range, 16–22 years; 1196 
male [16.5%]; 5052 white [69.9%]), 64.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 42.2% of patients 
with type 2 diabetes had undergone an eye examination by 6 years after initial diabetes diagnosis. 
Black youths (1367 [10.8%] of the sample) had an 11% and Latino youths (1450 [11.4%] of the 
sample) had an 18% decreased hazard of undergoing an eye examination by 6 years compared 
with white youths (black youths: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–0.99; Latino 
youths: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92). As household net worth increased, youths were 
increasingly more likely to undergo an eye examination by 6 years after initial diabetes diagnosis 
(net worth of ≥$500 000 vs <$25 000: HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.34–1.68).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Despite possessing health insurance, many youths with 
diabetes are not receiving eye examinations by 6 years after initial diagnosis to monitor for DR. 
These data suggest that adherence to clinical practice guidelines is particularly challenging for 
racial minorities and youths from less affluent families.
The incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents is increasing worldwide.1–5 Type 
2 diabetes, which previously affected few children and adolescents, now constitutes up to 
45% of all new diabetes diagnoses among adolescents, concurrent with the increase in 
childhood obesity.6,7 Projections based on US Census data suggest that the prevalence of 
type 1 diabetes will triple and type 2 diabetes will quadruple in youth by 2050, with the 
greatest increases among racial/ethnic minorities.8
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious complication of diabetes that is often asymptomatic in 
early and occasionally later stages but may progress to sight-threatening disease.9–12 Ocular 
complications of diabetes include diabetic macular edema, proliferative DR, tractional

 retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma, all of which can lead to blindness.13 Various 
clinical practice guidelines for the ophthalmic screening of patients with type 1 diabetes 
exist, although medical professional societies differ in their recommended timing of 
monitoring. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends initial 
screening 5 years after type 1 diabetes onset.14 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
recommends initial screening 3 to 5 years after type 1 diabetes onset for patients 10 years or 
older.15 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the same for patients 9 
years or older.16 The AAO and ADA recommend screening of youths with type 2 diabetes at 
the time of initial diabetes diagnosis, similar to adults with type 2 diabetes.17,18
A prior study19 of youths with diabetes reported that only one-third of those with type 1 
diabetes were referred for eye examinations in accordance with the above-mentioned clinical 
practice guidelines; another study20 found only half of youths with types 2 diabetes obtained 
eye examinations in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. Factors such as younger 
age, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (compared with type 1 diabetes), and shorter diabetes 
duration have been associated with poor adherence to guidelines for ophthalmic screening 
for DR.21 Most previous studies21,22 of factors associated with guideline adherence have 
been performed in adults, and the few studies19,20 of youths have not investigated 
sociodemographic factors, which may identify subgroups of children and adolescents 
particularly at risk for guideline nonadherence. The purpose of this study was to compare the 
rate of obtaining eye examinations among youths with diabetes in a large, nationwide US 
managed care network. Specifically, we sought to assess to what extent youths with diabetes 
obtain eye examinations in accordance with national guidelines and to identify 
sociodemographic factors associated with receipt of ocular examinations among youths with 
diabetes.
Methods
Data Source
The Clinformatics DataMart database (OptumInsight) contains detailed records of all 
enrollees in a nationwide managed care network from January 1, 2001, through December 
31, 2014. We accessed data on all beneficiaries 21 years or younger at their initial 
enrollment date. Medical claims from inpatient and outpatient health care encounters and 
associated International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes23 for all ocular and nonocular conditions were available, as 
was information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, household net worth, and urban or rural location 
of residence. The database also captures pharmacy records of all outpatient medication fills. 
All persons in the insurance plan were also fully enrolled in the pharmacy plan. This 
database has been used previously to study patients with ophthalmic diseases.24–26 The 
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study involving 
deidentified data and determined that informed consent was not required.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included all youths with continuous enrollment in the medical plan, enrollment for 3 
years or more, and 2 or more diabetes diagnoses (ICD-9-CM codes 250.xx or

 362.01-362.07) on separate dates. To ensure that all the children had diabetes, those who 
never filled an insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent prescription were excluded. To help 
exclude youths with preexisting diabetes (nonincident cases), we required the youths’ first 
diabetes diagnosis to have occurred 12 months or more after plan enrollment. Children who 
lacked information on race/ethnicity or household net worth were also excluded.
Classification of Diabetes Type
Youths were classified as having diabetes based on a previously validated algorithm.27 In 
brief, children younger than 10 years at their first diabetes diagnosis were considered to have 
type 1 diabetes. Among children 10 years or older, those who were prescribed only insulin 
in the 730 days after initial diagnosis were also considered to have type 1 diabetes. The 
remainder were classified as having type 2 diabetes. In this group, patients must have filled 
an oral hypoglycemic prescription (eg, metformin or sulfonylureas) with or without a 
concurrent insulin prescription within 730 days of their initial diabetes diagnosis. This 
algorithm had a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 78.2% for detecting type 1 diabetes 
and 83.2% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity for detecting type 2 diabetes in a Canadian 
study of youths with diabetes.27
Outcome
The primary outcome was receipt of an eye examination by an eye care professional, as 
identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes 92002, 92004, 92012, 92014, 
99201-99205, 99211-99215, 99221-99223, 99231-99233, 99241-99245, 99251-99255, or 
99281-99285.
Statistical Analysis
Data analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Inc). 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created using GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0 
(GraphPad Software). Characteristics of the study population were summarized using 
medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables and frequencies and 
percentages for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves assessed the timing from 
initial diabetes diagnosis to first eye examination for youth with diabetes; those with type 1 
and type 2 diabetes were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards regression modeling evaluated whether diabetes type and sociodemographic factors 
affected the hazard for undergoing an eye examination. All enrollees were right-censored 6 
years after their initial diabetes diagnosis. Model predictors were diabetes type, age and 
calendar year at initial diabetes diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, household net worth, and 
residence in an urban or rural community. We performed an additional analysis studying 
whether an association exists between diabetes type and calendar year to understand whether 
screening for DR was increasing or decreasing over time for each diabetes type. For all 
analyses, P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 5453 youths with type 1 diabetes (median age at initial diagnosis, 11 
years; IQR, 8–15 years) and 7233 youths with type 2 diabetes (median age at initial

 diagnosis, 19 years; IQR, 16–22 years). The median time in the plan after initial diabetes 
diagnosis for both groups was 2.1 years, with a maximum of 12 years, resulting in a 
maximum age of 34 years at the end of follow-up. Most youths with type 2 diabetes were 
female (6037 [83.5%]). Of those with type 1 diabetes, 4505 (82.6%) were white, 445 (8.2%) 
black, and 392 (7.2%) Latino. Among those with type 2 diabetes, 5052 (69.9%) were white, 
922 (12.8%) black, and 1058 (14.6%) Latino (Table 1).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis evaluated the time to first eye examination after initial 
diabetes diagnosis for youths with each diabetes type (Figure 1). Youths with type 1 diabetes 
had a higher rate of obtaining eye examinations compared with those with type 2 diabetes. 
Survival analysis estimated that by 6 years after initial diabetes diagnosis, 64.9% of youths 
with type 1 diabetes and 42.2% of youths with type 2 diabetes had undergone an eye 
examination. White and Asian youths had a higher rate of obtaining eye examinations than 
did black and Latino youths. By 6 years after initial diabetes diagnosis, 54.7% of white and 
57.3% of Asian youths had undergone an eye examination compared with 44.6% of black 
and 41.6% of Latino youths (Figure 2). Youths from families with higher household net 
worth were also more likely to obtain an eye examination compared with youths with lower 
household net worth levels (Figure 3). Overall, 3949 youths with diabetes (31.1%) 
underwent an eye examination. For 2159 youths (54.7%), the first ocular examination was 
performed by an ophthalmologist, and for 1790 youths (45.3%), the examination was 
performed by an optometrist.
In the multivariable regression model, youths with type 1 diabetes were 114% more likely to 
undergo an eye examination by 6 years after initial DM diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.97–2.33) compared with those with type 2 diabetes (Table 2). Black 
youths were 11% less likely (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–0.99) and Latino youths were 18% 
less likely (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92) to undergo an eye examination by 6 years 
compared with white youths. As household net worth increased, youths were increasingly 
more likely to undergo an eye examination by 6 years (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.34–1.68 for net 
worth ≥$500 000 vs <$25 000). The likelihood of an ocular examination increased by 2% 
(HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02) for every year increase in age at initial diabetes diagnosis. 
The likelihood of an ocular examination among youths with diabetes decreased by 2% for 
each calendar year during the study period (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99). Separate models 
stratified by diabetes type revealed that calendar year of initial diagnosis was only a 
significant predictor for obtaining an ocular examination for youths with type 2 diabetes 
(HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–0.98) but not for youths with type 1 diabetes (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 
0.99–1.01). In other words, in later calendar years, the odds of obtaining an eye examination 
decreased among youths with type 2 diabetes compared with those diagnosed in earlier 
years.
Discussion
In this study of youths with diabetes who were enrolled in a large managed care network, 
only 64.9% of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and 42.2% of those with type 2 
diabetes had undergone an eye examination within 6 years after initial diagnosis. This 
finding indicates that many youths with diabetes were not undergoing screening for DR as

 frequently as recommended by professional societies, such as the ADA, AAP, and AAO. 
Factors associated with receipt of a timely ocular examination—by 6 years after initial 
diabetes diagnosis—included older age at diabetes onset, white race, higher household net 
worth, and type 1 diabetes (relative to type 2 diabetes).
Previous studies21,22,28,29 estimating adherence to clinical guidelines for eye examinations 
among youths and adults with diabetes have varied widely, depending on study design and 
population studied, with adherence rates ranging from 20% to 82%. In a survey21 of 2308 
adults with diabetes, 65% self-reported receiving a dilated eye examination in the previous 
year. In another survey22 of adults with type 1 diabetes, 82% self-reported obtaining an eye 
examination in the past year. Among 988 adults with diabetes seen in a rural clinic setting, 
21% to 30% were reported to have obtained an annual dilated eye examination.28 In the 
National Long-Term Care Survey, during the 5 years from 1994 to 1998, a mean of 53% of 
Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes surveyed in each year received annual eye 
examinations.29
Ocular examination rates among youths with diabetes have also varied widely. For example, 
a study of 80 youths who had type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more or type 2 diabetes for any 
duration who were receiving care at a pediatric diabetes clinic at a US academic medical 
center found that only 38 (35%) were referred for an eye examination.19 An electronic 
health record review20 of 56 youths with type 2 diabetes from several medical practices in 
Ohio found documentation that dilated eye examinations within 1 year of initial diagnosis 
took place for 54% of the patients, although the authors suspected that incomplete record of 
an eye examination when one actually took place may have led to an underestimation of 
proportions who had been examined. In a Canadian study30 of 1507 adolescents with 
diabetes transitioning from pediatric to adult care, 70% to 72% of adolescents had 1 or more 
eye examination in the 2 years before and after their transition. These prior studies19,20 have 
typically reported the rate of obtaining an eye examination in a cross-sectional fashion and 
included patients with diabetes of varying disease duration. These factors can greatly affect 
whether a patient has undergone an ocular examination. Unlike previous studies,19,20 our 
study is unique because we captured children and adolescents with newly diagnosed diabetes 
whom we followed up longitudinally from onset of diabetes to determine whether they 
received ocular examinations.
Factors previously reported to be associated with obtaining screening ophthalmic 
examinations in adults with diabetes include possessing health insurance and receiving 
specialist care, such as from endocrinologists (rather than generalist care, such as from 
primary care physicians) for diabetes management.22 Younger age, shorter diabetes duration, 
type 2 diabetes (compared with type 1 diabetes), and having the last eye examination 
performed by an optometrist or primary care physician (vs an ophthalmologist) have been 
reported to be associated with increased nonadherence to established ophthalmic screening 
guidelines.21Our study confirmed some of these previously noted risk factors. In addition, 
we learned that race and economic status play an important role in adherence to clinical 
guidelines for obtaining ophthalmic examinations among youths. Despite possessing health 
insurance, black and Latino youths and youths from lower economic backgrounds were less 
likely to undergo ophthalmic examinations in accordance with clinical practice guidelines

 than were white youths and children from more affluent families. This finding is particularly 
disconcerting because racial minorities are projected to have the greatest increase in diabetes 
prevalence during the next several decades.8
Barriers to guideline adherence are likely multifactorial, with physician and patient factors 
playing a role. Patient-related factors that contribute to not obtaining an annual eye 
examination include limited personal mobility attributable to poor health, forgetfulness, lack 
of health insurance or financial barriers, long scheduling wait times, and lack of acceptance 
of the diagnosis of diabetes and its associated indications for regular care.31,32 In one 
study,31 a small number of patients (5%) reported an aversion to pupil dilation. A survey33 
of an Hispanic population identified a lack of knowledge of the potential ophthalmic 
consequences of diabetes, especially among persons with newly diagnosed diabetes, as a 
factor contributing to poor guideline adherence. Health care professional factors may also 
play a role. Although previous studies34,35 of Canadian general practitioners have found that 
more than 80% to 90% were aware of ophthalmic screening guidelines for adults with type 2 
diabetes, it is unclear to what extent primary care physicians are aware that these guidelines 
also apply to children with type 2 diabetes. One Canadian survey34 reported that only 13% 
of 645 general practitioners believed that the initial screening for patients newly diagnosed 
as having type 1 diabetes should be performed 5 years after diagnosis, but 81% believed that 
the initial screening for patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes was supposed to occur 
sooner (shortly after initial diagnosis). Although physician knowledge of guidelines seems 
adequate, there appears to be a discrepancy between knowledge of guidelines and actual 
referral rate, because one study36 reported that the primary care referral rate for 
ophthalmologic services for patients with diabetes was 33% or less. Because of our data 
source, we cannot determine the extent to which failure to obtain an eye examination was 
attributable to lack of referral for eye care or lack of patient willingness to undergo an eye 
examination despite referral.
New strategies that use point-of-care ophthalmologic services, especially those that involve 
nonmydriatic fundus photography, may be a promising option to improve adherence to 
ophthalmic screening guidelines because they improved screening rates considerably for 
adults with diabetes.28,37 Pilot studies38,39 of nonmydriatic fundus photography among 
youths with diabetes have found that gradable or clinically valuable images were obtained in 
almost all patients screened. More studies are needed to determine whether, how, and in 
what settings nonmydriatic fundus photography can help remove barriers to adherence to 
clinical guidelines to improve screening and detection of DR in youths with diabetes, 
particularly those who are underserved, such as racial minorities, youths from less affluent 
backgrounds, or those who are uninsured.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. This study included more than 12 000 youths with diabetes 
throughout the nation, among whom more than 5500 were youths with type 1 diabetes and 
more than 7000 youths had type 2 diabetes. The diverse population allowed analysis of 
racial minorities and patients from a range of economic backgrounds. Patients in this study 
were under the care of numerous practice settings throughout the country and not limited to

 a single academic center or a few private practices. All participants had health insurance; 
thus, lack of health insurance could not have been a barrier to adherence to clinical practice 
guidelines. Determining whether an individual received an eye examination from claims data 
is also likely more accurate than patient self-report.40
This study also has limitations. Although we relied on a validated algorithm to determine 
enrollees’ type of diabetes,27 some cases may have been misclassified. Some cases of type 2 
diabetes may include patients taking metformin for insulin resistance or prediabetes. 
Complete data on hemoglobin A1c levels were not available, making it difficult to 
characterize the severity of diabetes for this cohort. Despite efforts to ensure that the study 
population included only persons with incident diabetes by requiring 12 months in the plan 
without a prior diabetes diagnosis, some of these children may have had preexisting 
diabetes. Thus, we may be underestimating the time from disease onset to first recorded eye 
examination and overestimating the numbers of youth with diabetes who are adherent to 
current practice guidelines. Clinical data, such as visual acuity and retinal examination 
findings, were unavailable in our data set. Although claims data document whether an 
examination was performed by an eye care professional, we could not discern from claims 
data alone whether the examination involved pupil dilation to best assess for DR. Thus, we 
may be overestimating the number of youth with diabetes who are adherent to practice 
guidelines. Our results may not apply to youth without health insurance who are likely to 
have even lower ophthalmic screening rates. Although lack of health insurance was not a 
barrier to adherence in this population, insurance co-payment requirements may have 
contributed. Finally, our results may not apply to enrollees in other health insurance plans 
because there may be variation among plans regarding availability and participation in 
diabetes disease management programs. This particular managed care network has an 
optional disease management program for diabetes, but we had no information on which 
youth were in the program.
Conclusions
For youths with type 1 diabetes, for whom there are clear screening guidelines for DR, 
approximately two-thirds of children and adolescents in our cohort obtained eye 
examinations to check for DR as recommended by professional societies. Youths with type 2 
diabetes were even less likely to undergo screening to check for DR. Groups of youth with 
diabetes who had a reduced likelihood of undergoing eye examinations included racial 
minorities and those from less affluent families. Identifying ways to improve adherence to 
ophthalmic screening guidelines, including for racial minorities and economically 
disadvantaged youth, can help with timely diagnosis of DR so that sight-threatening 
consequences of DR can be avoided.

 Key Points
Question
To what extent do youth with diabetes obtain eye examinations to screen for diabetic 
retinopathy in accordance with established screening guidelines?
Findings
This longitudinal cohort study of 12 686 youth 21 years or younger with newly diagnosed 
diabetes enrolled in a US managed care network found that only 65% with type 1 
diabetes and 42% with type 2 diabetes had undergone an eye examination by 6 years after 
initial diabetes diagnosis.
Meaning
These data suggest that many youth with diabetes who have health insurance are not 
receiving timely eye examinations to monitor for retinopathy.
