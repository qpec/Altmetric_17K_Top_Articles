Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized by interstitial remodelling,
leading to compromised lung function. Cellular senescence markers are detectable within IPF
lung tissue and senescent cell deletion rejuvenates pulmonary health in aged mice. Whether
and how senescent cells regulate IPF or if their removal may be an efficacious intervention
strategy is unknown. Here we demonstrate elevated abundance of senescence biomarkers in
IPF lung, with p16 expression increasing with disease severity. We show that the secretome of
senescent fibroblasts, which are selectively killed by a senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus
quercetin (DQ), is fibrogenic. Leveraging the bleomycin-injury IPF model, we demonstrate
that early-intervention suicide-gene-mediated senescent cell ablation improves pulmonary
function and physical health, although lung fibrosis is visibly unaltered. DQ treatment repli-
cates benefits of transgenic clearance. Thus, our findings establish that fibrotic lung disease is
mediated, in part, by senescent cells, which can be targeted to improve health and function.

ibrosis and wound healing are fundamentally intertwined
processes, driven by a cascade of injury, inflammation,
fibroblast proliferation and migration, and matrix deposi-
tion and remodelling1. Older organisms display reduced ability
to heal wounds2 and resolve fibrosis3, leading to tissue scarring
and irreparable organ damage. The origins of persistent injury
response
and
repair
signalling
underlying
fibrotic
tissue
destruction are poorly understood. This is particularly true of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a quintessential disease of
ageing with median diagnosis at 66 years and estimated survival
of 3–4 years4. IPF symptoms, including chronic shortness
of breath, cough, fatigue and weight loss, are progressive and
lead to a dramatic truncation of healthspan and lifespan. This is
due
to
destruction
of
lung
parenchyma,
which
exhibits
characteristic honeycombing and fibroblastic foci patterns1,5.
Current IPF treatment regimens have limited efficacy6,7. Better
defining the mechanisms responsible for chronic activation
of profibrotic mechanisms and lung parenchymal destruction
is essential for devising more effective therapies.
Cellular senescence is an evolutionarily conserved state of
stable replicative arrest induced by pro-ageing stressors also
implicated in IPF pathogenesis, including telomere attrition,
oxidative stress, DNA damage and proteome instability. Damage
accumulation stimulates the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors p16Ink4a and/or p53-p21Cip1/Waf1, which antagonize
cyclin-dependent
kinases
to
block
cell
cycle
progression8.
Through
secretion
of
the
senescence-associated
secretory
phenotype (SASP), a broad repertoire of cytokines, chemokines,
matrix remodelling proteases and growth factors, senescent cells
paracrinely promote proliferation and tissue deterioration8.
Conversely, senescence is autonomously anti-proliferative, may
be requisite for optimal cutaneous wound healing9 and may
restrict pathological liver fibrosis10.
A growing body of evidence implicates accelerated mechanisms
of ageing, including cellular senescence, in IPF pathogenesis11.
Established
senescence
biomarkers,
including
p16,
p21
and
senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity (SA-b-gal), have
been observed in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells in human
IPF lung tissue12,13, and human IPF cells show increased senescence
propensity ex vivo14. In mice, intratracheal instillation of the
chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin causes resolvable lung fibrosis
that recapitulates key features of human IPF15. Bleomycin lung
injury induces a molecular signature of senescence16,17 and age-
dependent accumulation of senescent myofibroblasts may impede
fibrosis resolution following bleomycin exposure3. In contrast,
overexpression of an enzyme responsible for production of the
extracellular matrix component hyaluronan exacerbates bleomycin-
induced injury18, whereas its depletion appears to activate
senescence,
challenging
a
negative
role
for
senescence
in
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis19.
Very recently, Hashimoto et al. provided crucial evidence that
cellular senescence contributes to lung ageing and may be
targeted for functional improvement20. Using a novel suicide-
gene strategy, they discovered that elimination of naturally
occurring senescent cells restores lung compliance, structure and
elasticity in aged mice. An alternative approach to transgenic
senescent cell clearance is senolytics21,22, which may be a tractable
treatment option for humans. Administration of the senolytic
quercetin
diminishes
the
proinflammatory
phenotype
of
bleomycin-induced
senescence
in
fibroblasts
in
vitro23.
Similarly, delivery of rapamycin, a SASP inhibitor, attenuates
pulmonary fibrosis and myofibroblast activation in vivo24. The
culmination of prior reports suggests that senescent cells may
contribute to fibrotic lung disease; however, their mechanism of
action and whether they may be therapeutically targeted to
improve lung function remains untested.
Experimentation
described
herein
explored
the
role
of
cellular senescence in IPF pathology across the translational
continuum. We began by assessing human IPF and control
biospecimens and demonstrate that several senescence biomar-
kers accumulate in IPF lung, with p16 expression increasing
concordantly with disease severity. Using bleomycin-induced
lung injury as an IPF model, we show that, similar to human
IPF, murine lung fibrosis is characterized by accumulation
of p16- and SASP-positive fibroblasts and epithelial cells. We
hypothesized that SASP signalling is a mechanism by which
senescent cells exert negative effects, and our in vitro experiments
establish that the SASP of senescent fibroblasts is indeed
fibrogenic. Critically, senescent fibroblasts are selectively elimi-
nated through treatment with the senolytic drug cocktail,
dasatinib plus quercetin (DQ). Next, we tested the efficacy of
senescent cell deletion in improving bleomycin-induced lung
pathology in Ink-Attac mice, in which p16-positive cells are
deleted through suicide-gene activation. We show that senescent
cell clearance improves pulmonary function, body composition
and physical health when treatment is initiated at disease onset.
Notably, senolytic DQ treatment phenocopies the transgenic cell
clearance strategy. Thus, our results suggest that senescent cells,
through their SASP, wield potent effects on adjacent cells,
ultimately promoting functional lung deterioration. Our findings
provide
important
proof-of-concept
evidence
for
targeting
senescent cells as a novel pharmacological approach for treatment
of human IPF.
Results
Senescence biomarkers accumulate in IPF lung. To explore
the hypothesis that senescent cells and the SASP regulate lung
fibrosis, we interrogated microarray and RNA sequencing
(RNAseq) data sets corresponding to independent IPF and
control human cohorts for differential expression of established
senescence genes. IPF subjects exhibited significant impairments
in lung function, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC)
and diffusion capacity, and physical function, as measured by
the 12-item short form health survey physical component
score and 6 min walking distance, relative to control subjects
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). CDKN2A (p16) was significantly
upregulated within lung samples of individuals with IPF and
increased with disease severity (Fig. 1a). Correlation analyses
revealed
that
elevated
pulmonary
p16
expression
assessed
via microarray was associated with reduced FVC, diffusion
capacity and 12-item short form health survey physical compo-
nent score (Supplementary Fig. 1).
To corroborate expression data, we investigated p16 cytospatial
distribution using immunohistochemistry in a subset of control
and IPF lung samples that were analysed by microarray.
We identified a rare population of p16-positive epithelial
cells in control lung samples (Fig. 1b). In IPF lung samples,
both epithelial cells and fibroblasts were p16 positive within
fibroblastic foci
(Fig.
1c), the presumed
leading
edge
of
IPF disease. In the honeycomb lung, reactive bronchiolar
epithelium
and
fibroblasts
were
equally
positive
for
p16
(Fig. 1d). We next quantified an independent senescence
biomarker, telomere-associated foci (TAF), which are sites of
unresolved DNA damage within telomeres, demarcated by
gH2A.X and telomere immuno-fluorescence in situ hybridization
co-localization25. We observed a significant increase in both
the mean number of gH2A.X foci and the percentage of
TAF-positive
cells
in
IPF
samples,
relative
to
controls
(Fig.

 epithelial cells within fibrotic foci and honeycomb lung, and
accretion of TAF in lung tissue of individuals with IPF.
Hypothesizing that senescent cells mediate IPF pathology
via their secretome, we assessed differential expression of
SASP components in human IPF transcriptome data sets,
focusing on growth and matrix remodelling factors, which play
essential roles in proliferation and tissue reorganization26.
Pregnancy-associated
plasma
protein
A
(PAPPA),
which
mediates insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling by cleaving
IGF-binding proteins to liberate IGF27, was robustly upregulated,
as were IGFBP2 and 4, although to a lesser magnitude (Fig. 1a).
Expression of several matrix-remodelling proteins
(MMPs)
strongly increased with disease severity and in concordance
with profibrotic factors, including collagen, type I, a1 (COL1A1)
and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1, Fig. 1a), the latter
of which is a potent mediator of fibroblast proliferation28.
Bleomycin injury induces cell senescence. We next established
experimental
systems
to
further
interrogate
the
cellular
identity and mechanisms by which senescent cells exert their
effects. Aerosolized intratracheal instillation of the chemother-
apeutic agent bleomycin induces lung fibrosis in mice and
recapitulates critical features of human IPF15. Using this
murine model, we fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS)
whole lungs isolated 14 days post bleomycin or phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) exposure based on cell-surface marker
presentation (Fig. 2a–d) and conducted gene expression profiling
on populations of fibroblasts (PDGFRa þ, EPCAM �, CD31 �
and CD45 �) (Fig. 2b,e), epithelial cells (EPCAM þ, PDGFRa �,
CD31 �
and
CD45 �)
(Fig.
2c,f)
and
endothelial
cells
(CD31 þ, PDGFRa �, EPCAM � and CD45 �) (Fig. 2d,g). We
observed significant upregulation of p16 within both fibroblasts
and epithelial cells but not endothelial cells (Fig. 2e–g). Transcript

 levels of proinflammatory and profibrotic SASP factors, monocyte
chemotactic protein 1 (Mcp1), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1
(Pai1), tumour necrosis factor-a (Tnfa), Mmp10, Mmp12, Col1a1
and transforming growth factor-b (Tgfb) were also increased in
fibroblasts (Fig. 2e) and epithelial cells (Fig. 2f). All three
cell populations exhibited upregulation of Mmp10 and Mmp12
(Fig. 2e–g). Thus, similar to human IPF, bleomycin-mediated
lung
injury
induces
a
senescent
signature
characterized
by
increased
transcriptional
activation
of
p16
and
SASP
components in fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
The secretome of senescent fibroblasts is profibrotic. To sub-
stantiate the SASP as a mediator of IPF pathology, we
devised an in vitro assay to test fibrotic activation. Exposure of
human
IMR90
fibroblasts
to
10 Gy
irradiation
induced
senescence observable after 21 days, which was confirmed by
staining for SA-b-gal (Fig. 3a) and expression profiling of
senescence effectors (p16 and p53) and SASP factors (MCP1 and
IL6) (Fig. 3b). Conditioned medium (CM) collected from senes-
cent cells (SASP-CM), relative to sham-irradiated control cells
(CCM), exhibited 3- to 4200-fold increases in the abundance of
established SASP proteins interleukin (IL)-1a, IL1b, IL6, IL10,
MCP1, PAI1, VCAM1, MMP2, MMP12 and TGFb (Fig. 3c).
To examine potential fibrogenic effects of the SASP, we
treated
naive
IMR90
fibroblasts
with
non-CM
(NCM),
NCM þ 2 ng ml� 1 TGFb (positive control), CCM or SASP-CM
and immunostained for a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA), an
indicator of fibrotic activation29. SASP-CM induced aSMA signal
intensity at a level comparable to TGFb treatment (Fig. 3d). Sixty-
two percent of fibroblasts treated with SASP-CM stained positive
for aSMA protein, whereas only 21% of cells treated with CCM
were aSMA positive. We next utilized traction force microscopy30
to determine whether fibrotic activation translated to changes in
contractile
behaviour.
SASP-CM-treated
fibroblast
exhibited
significantly greater traction forces, relative to CCM-treated
fibroblasts (Fig. 3e). IMR90 cells treated with SASP-CM also
expressed higher levels of several fibrosis genes, including actin-a-2
(ACTA2, encoding aSMA), COL1A1, COL1A2 and fibronectin 1
(FN1), relative to NCM- and CCM-treated cells (Fig. 3f). Thus, our
results demonstrate that the secretome of senescent fibroblasts
robustly stimulates a fibrotic phenotype in healthy human
fibroblasts. Importantly, CM collected from irradiated bronchiolar
epithelial cells did not activate a fibrogenic response, as measured by
aSMA fibrotic activation of naive IMR90 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2), suggesting that cell-type-specific SASP composition may
differentially affect pathological phenotypes within the lung.

 Senescent fibroblasts are eliminated by DQ treatment. Based
on these findings, we reasoned that senescent cells might be
viable pharmacological targets to counter fibrotic pulmonary
disease. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of drugs previously
shown to selectively eliminate senescent cells and spare quiescent
and proliferating cells by comparing DQ, a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor and flavonol combination22, and navitoclax, a Bcl-2
family inhibitor21. In a dose-dependent manner, DQ killed
irradiation-induced senescent primary human fibroblasts more
efficiently than navitoclax in vitro (Fig. 3g). A single dose
of 20 mM D þ 15 mM Q eliminated 433% of senescent cells
within 3 days (Fig. 3g). Similarly, in IMR90 fibroblasts made
senescent by etoposide pretreatment, treatment with DQ robustly
reduced senescence, as measured by SA-b-gal staining relative
to control, whereas navitoclax treatment had no observable
effect (Supplementary Fig. 3).

 Senescent cell clearance mitigates fibrotic lung disease. Using
the Ink-Attac mouse model, in which a drug, AP20187 (AP),
induces apoptosis through dimerization of FKBP-fused caspase 8,
we previously discovered that clearance of p16-expressing cells
improves parameters of physical health and function in progeroid
mice31. Attenuation of age-related pathologies and extension
of lifespan in chronologically aged mice has been demonstrated
using the same transgenic strategy32–34, and improvements in
lung structure and function in aged mice have recently been
demonstrated using a similar suicide-gene strategy20. Here we
applied the bleomycin fibrosis model to Ink-Attac mice, to test
the hypothesis that senescent cell clearance attenuates pulmonary
dysfunction. In parallel, we tested the efficacy of DQ treatment.
Ink-Attac mice received a single dose of bleomycin or PBS
through

induced lung fibrosis over a 3-week time course (Fig. 4a).
Compared
with
PBS,
bleomycin
increased
whole
lung
p16 expression by threefold (Fig. 4b). Pulmonary transcript
levels of putative SASP factors Mcp1, Il6, Mmp12, Col1a1 and
Tgfb also increased following bleomycin administration (Fig. 4c).
Senescent cell clearance through AP-mediated suicide-gene
activation or senolytic DQ treatment significantly reduced
p16 transcriptional levels in the lungs and, concordantly,
blunted increases in Mcp1, Il6, Mmp12 and Tgfb (Fig. 4c).
We also assessed whether senescent cell clearance altered
inflammatory aspects of bleomycin-induced lung injury through
analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at endpoint.
Total BAL cell counts were significantly increased in vehicle-
treated bleomycin-exposed mice, and treatment with AP or
DQ attenuated this increase. Differential analysis revealed
a similar trend for macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Cytokine protein levels within the
BAL fluid were highly variable; however, apparent increases in
MCP1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b) and IL6 (Supplementary Fig. 4c)
were diminished following AP or DQ treatment.
To determine whether the molecular and cellular phenotypes
of lungs derived from mice subjected to AP and DQ treatment
corresponded
to
functional
improvements,
we
conducted
non-invasive, whole-body plethysmography35. Bleomycin injury
resulted in a twofold increase in enhanced pause (Penh),
an indirect estimate of airway resistance. This effect was
diminished by AP and DQ treatment (Fig. 4d). We employed
the forced oscillation technique in anaesthetized, tracheostomized
mice before necropsy as a direct measure of lung compliance36.
Bleomycin reduced lung compliance in vehicle-treated mice by
40%. Both AP- and DQ treatment minimized this impairment,
limiting bleomycin-induced reductions in lung compliance to
15% (Fig. 4e). Despite striking improvements in lung function
following senescent cell clearance, quantified reductions in lung
fibrosis histopathology did not reach statistical significance
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Of note, the primarily airway-centred
fibrosis was immature and reflective of acute lung injury,
characterized
by
fibroblastic
proliferation
and
mixed
inflammation, rather than collagen deposition.
We
next
evaluated
whether
systemic
health
parameters
were improved following AP or DQ treatment. Monitoring of
body weight, an important indicator of pathology severity
following bleomycin challenge37, revealed that vehicle-treated
mice lost an average of 3.6 g, relative to baseline. In comparison,
both AP- and DQ-treated mice lost approximately 1.6 g of body
weight (Fig. 4f). To assess exercise capacity, a measure that
integrates multiple physiological systems and is used in people
with lung disease to gauge intervention responses, we conducted a
graded treadmill exercise test. Mice that received bleomycin and
were treated with vehicle ran substantially shorter mean and
maximal distances to exhaustion than all other groups. Compared
with bleomycin-injured mice treated with vehicle, mice treated
with AP and DQ ran, on average, 437% further to exhaustion
(Fig. 4g).
Senescent cell retention impairs fibrosis resolution. Taken
together, our in vivo results strongly support the hypothesis
that elimination of senescent cells improves fibrotic pulmonary
disease when treatment is initiated at the onset of pathogenesis. We
next
sought
to
test
the
clinically
important
question
of whether senescent cell clearance provides comparable benefit
when initiated at a timepoint when pathology has fully developed.
Ink-Attac
mice
contained
a
strong
senescent
signature
in
lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells 2 weeks post-bleomycin chal-
lenge (Fig. 2), a timepoint of well-established fibrotic remodelling in
the lung15. Accordingly, we administered a single dose of bleomycin
or PBS through aerosolized intratracheal administration to Ink-
Attac mice. Two weeks post challenge, we randomized bleomycin-
exposed mice to AP, DQ or vehicle treatment groups based on
change in body weight and non-invasively measured airway
resistance (Penh). Mice were treated for 2 weeks and were killed
4 weeks following bleomycin or PBS exposure (Fig. 5a). Body
weight
monitoring
revealed
that,
similar
to
our
previous
experiments
(Fig.
4f),
mice
that
received
bleomycin
lost
substantial body mass, relative to mice that received PBS. Upon
treatment initiation on day 14, mean body weight of mice treated
with AP plateaued, while vehicle-treated, bleomycin-exposed
counterparts continued to lose weight (Fig. 5a), suggestive of
physical benefit afforded by senescent cell clearance, even when
treatment is initiated in later-stage disease.
Spontaneous resolution is an inherent limitation of the
bleomycin IPF model, with the rate and variability of bleomy-
cin-induced
pathology
resolution
dependent
on
complex
factors, including genetic background and the microbiome38,39.
Indeed, both endpoint compliance (Supplementary Fig. 6)
and comparison of Penh airway resistance at endpoint (4 weeks
post challenge) to measures taken at the treatment randomization
timepoint (2 weeks post challenge) revealed appreciable, albeit
variable,
improvement
in
all
bleomycin-exposed
groups,
including vehicle-treated mice, with AP-treated mice showing
greatest improvement (Fig. 5b). Thus, in our hands, the 3–4-
week-period following a single bleomycin exposure represents a
pivotal window of natural resolution (Figs 4 and 5a,b).
Critically, impaired capacity to resolve fibrotic bleomycin injury
has been associated with accumulation of apoptosis-resistant,
senescent myofibroblasts3. As we were unable to disentangle
senescence-dependent
and
-independent
events
governing
resolution,
we
queried
whether
p16
expression,
a measure of senescent burden, was associated with indicators of
disease persistence. Impaired lung function, as measured by
endpoint
airway
resistance
(Penh)
(Fig.
5c)
and
airway
compliance (Fig. 5d), correlated significantly with p16 transcript
abundance. This finding is consistent with associations drawn in
humans, in which increased p16 expression correlated significantly
with reduced FVC, pulmonary diffusion capacity and physical
function (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, in bleomycin-exposed
mice, expression of the inflammatory and fibrogenic SASP factors
Mcp1 (Fig. 5e), Pai1 (Fig. 5f), Mmp10 (Fig. 5g) and Col1a1 (Fig. 5h)
robustly correlated with p16 transcriptional activation. These results
further support the notion that the presence and activities of
senescent cells may dictate resolution capacity following bleomycin-
induced pathology.

butes to fibrotic lung disease and can be targeted to improve

 pulmonary

and
physical
health.
We
show
that senescence effectors and molecular markers of senescence-
related DNA damage increase in the lungs of individuals
with IPF (Fig. 1). This is associated with elevated transcription
of SASP components. Cell-type analyses in the lungs of
both human IPF (Fig. 1c,d) and bleomycin-injured mice
(Fig. 2) demonstrate that fibroblasts and epithelial cells acquire
senescent identities. Through in vitro testing we establish that the
secretome of senescent fibroblasts may be a source of profibrotic
signalling observed in pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 3). We also
discovered that senescent fibroblasts are efficiently killed by
treatment with a senolytic cocktail, DQ (Fig. 3g and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3).
Leveraging transgenic and pharmacological approaches, we
show that bleomycin-mediated lung injury induces a molecular
signature of senescence in mice. Elimination of senescent cells
by suicide gene or senolytic strategies attenuates bleomycin-
mediated impairments in lung function and physical health
(Fig. 4). Combined in vitro and in vivo results implicate the
SASP as a mechanism by which senescent cells mediate fibrotic
pulmonary pathology. Specifically, we show that the secretome of
senescent fibroblasts contains an array of factors with established
roles in regulating fibrotic and inflammatory aspects of IPF,
including TGFb, IL6 and MMP12 (Fig. 3c). Deletion of senescent
cells reduces pulmonary expression of these factors (Fig. 4c).
Senescent cells, therefore, are a viable origin of multiple signalling
cascades that drive persistent fibroproliferative activation in
IPF, and their clearance is a means to combinatorially down-
regulate these processes.
Our murine results strongly support the hypothesis that
senescent cell elimination potently influences health outcomes
when animals are treated in early-stage pathogenesis, highlighting
the potential utility of senolytics as an intervention strategy to
be paired with early disease detection. Through demonstration

 Mmp12 and Tgfb, our results support the premise that senescent
cells are a source of persistent injury-response signalling under-
lying chronic activation in IPF. Signalling factor reductions
coincided with striking improvements in pulmonary and physical
function (Fig. 4c–g) in the absence of significant improvements
in lung fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. 5). A lack of visible
histopathological fibrosis resolution may not reflect benefits at
the cellular and subcellular level, and further, the short time
course and heterogeneity intrinsic to the bleomycin model may
limit
observable
fibrosis
resolution.

 irradiation or repetitive bleomycin administration, will be useful
for conclusively determining the effects of senescent cells in later-
stage disease40,41. We also provide evidence that senescent cell
retention is associated with impaired ability to resolve bleomycin-
induced injury. Taken together, our findings causally implicate
senescence and the SASP in fibrotic lung disease, thereby
revealing senescent cell elimination and SASP blockade as novel
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of IPF.
Methods
Human samples and transcriptome data sets. Microarray data, clinical
parameters and lung tissue samples derived from control subjects and patients
with IPF were obtained through the Lung Tissue Research Consortium
(LTRC, (http://www.ltrcpublic.com)). The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board
approved all aspects of the study using human data and biospecimens. Informed
consent was obtained from all subjects who contributed medical data and biological
specimens to the LTRC, comprising Mayo Clinic, University of Colorado, Uni-
versity of Michigan, Temple University and University of Pittsburgh.
IPF diagnosis was based on American Thoracic Society and European
Respiratory Society criteria, and all IPF samples displayed typical patterns of
usual interstitial pneumonia42.
An independent set of LTRC-obtained tissues were applied to messenger
RNA sequencing. RNA libraries were prepared from 200 ng of high-quality total
RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the TruSeq RNA Sample
Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The concentration and size distribution
of TruSeq libraries was determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip
(Santa Clara, CA) and a final quantification, using Qubit fluorometry
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was done to confirm sample concentration. Libraries
were loaded onto paired end flow cells at concentrations of 8–10 pM to generate
cluster densities of 700,000 mm � 2 following Illumina’s standard protocol using the
Illumina cBot and cBot Paired end cluster kit version 3. The flow cells were seque-
nced as 51 � 2 paired end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using TruSeq SBS
sequencing kit version 3 and SCS version 1.4.8 data collection software. Base calling
was performed using Illumina’s RTA version 1.12.4.2. RNAseq data and supporting
information are publicly available. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE92592.
Mouse model. All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved
by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Anaesthetized male heterozygote Ink-Attac mice32 on a C57BL/6 � BALB/c
background aged 2.5–8 months old received PBS or 2 U kg � 1 bleomycin
(Bleomycin for injection, USP, APP Pharmaceutical, LCC Schaumburg, IL)
through aerosolized intratracheal delivery, as previously described43.
For experiments employing senescent cell clearance as a means to prevent
pulmonary disease, mice were randomized to AP (10 mg kg � 1, six treatments)
delivered by intraperitoneal injection, dasatinib (5 mg kg � 1) plus quercetin
(50 mg kg � 1) delivered by oral gavage (three treatments) or vehicle groups
5 days post-intratracheal instillation and were killed 3 weeks post-intratracheal
instillation. For experiments employing senescent cell clearance as a means to
treat pulmonary disease, mice were randomized to the same treatment groups
2 weeks post-intratracheal instillation and were killed 4 weeks post-intratracheal
instillation. Body weight was monitored daily. Mice that failed to exhibit
bleomycin-induced weight loss by 7 days were excluded from the study.
Physical function was characterized at endpoint by measuring running time and
distance using a motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH)44.
Mice were acclimated to the treadmill for 3 consecutive days for 5 min starting at a
speed of 5 m min � 1 for 2 min, then 7 m min � 1 for 2 min, followed by 9 m min � 1
for 1 min, at an incline grade of 5%. The next day, animals ran on the treadmill at
an initial speed of 5 m min � 1 for 2 min and every subsequent 2 min the speed was
increased by 2 m min � 1 until the mice were exhausted (5% grade). Exhaustion was
defined as the inability of the mouse to remain on the treadmill despite an electrical
shock stimulus and mechanical prodding. Running time and distance were
recorded.
At endpoint, airway responsiveness was determined through whole-body
plethysmography (Buxco Electronics, Sharon, CT) and FlexiVent forced oscillation
technique (Scireq, Montreal, Canada)45. Briefly, for whole-body plethysmography,
conscious mice were placed in a whole-body plethysmographic chamber
(Buxco Electronics) with a volume of 800 cm3. After a few minutes for stabilization,
baseline respiratory waveform and enhanced pause (Penh, an indication of airway
resistance in mice) were determined. For FlexiVent assessments, mice were
anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and placed in
a supine position. A tracheostomy was performed and a blunt tip cannula as an
endotracheal tube was inserted into the trachea. Mice were mechanically ventilated
by the Flexivent system and physiological parameters (heart rate, pulmonary
resistance, elastance and compliance) were recorded by a pressure transducer that
was attached to the ventilator system. Subsequently, BAL fluid and lungs were
collected. Total leukocyte counts in BAL fluids were determined using a
haemocytometer after staining with Randolph’s stain. For cell differential analysis,
cytospin preparations from BAL fluids were stained with Wright–Giemsa and
4200 cells were analysed by using a standard cell morphology criteria. BAL
cytokines were measured using ProcartaPlex immunoassays (Affymetrix
eBioscience, Vienna, Austria). Investigators conducting functional measures were
blinded to treatment groups during data collection. Sample sizes were based on
previously published experiments, in which statistical differences were identified.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Fully anaesthetized bleomycin- and PBS-
exposed mice were perfused with cold PBS 14 days post exposure and the lungs
were immediately dissected. The lungs were finely minced with a razor blade in a
100 mm petri dish in 1 ml of cold DMEM medium containing 0.2 mg ml � 1 Lib-
erase DL (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 100 U ml � 1 DNase I (Roche). The mixture
was transferred to 15 ml tubes and incubated at 37 �C for 30 min in a water bath.
Enzymatic digestion was inactivated by adding DMEM medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was passed once through a 40 mm cell
strainer (Fisher, Waltham, MA) to remove multicellular debris. Cells were then
centrifuged at 1,300 r.p.m. at 4 �C for 10 min, washed once in PBS and resuspended
in 0.2 ml of FACS buffer (1% BSA, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 7.4 in PBS). The single cell
suspension was then incubated with anti-CD45-PerCp-Cy5.5, anti-CD31-PE, anti-
PDGFRa-APC and anti-EpCAM-BV421 antibodies (1:200) (Biolegend, San Diego,
CA) for 20 min on ice. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold FACS
buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer. FACS sorting was conducted using
a BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). FACS-sorted epithelial cells,
endothelial cells and fibroblasts were collected in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes
containing RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which were subjected to
mRNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis and RT–PCR analysis.
Cell culture. For experiments employing radiation-induced senescence, IMR90
(passages 5–7; ATCC, catalogue number CCL-186) and primary human fibroblasts
(passages 3–6) were exposed to 10 Gy radiation or sham conditions using a RS2000
X-Ray Irradiator (RAD Source Technologies, Suwanee, GA). Normal bronchial
epithelial cells (passages 4–7, Lot 7F3000, Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were exposed
to 5 Gy or sham conditions. Senescence was confirmed by expression profiling
(p16, SASP factors) and/or SA-b-gal staining32 21 days post radiation. For
SA-b-gal staining, cells were fixed for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde þ 0.2%
glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS and
incubated overnight in SA-b-gal staining solution containing the following:
1 mg ml � 1 X-gal, 40 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 5 mM
potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 150 mM sodium chloride
and 2 mM magnesium chloride in water. Cells were then rinsed in PBS and stored
at 4 �C until imaging. Media applied 20 days post irradiation (or sham) was
collected 24 h later and was diluted with NCM to reflect equivalent source cell
concentrations. ProcartaPlex immunoassays (Affymetrix eBioscience) were used
for CM secretome composition assessment, according to the manufacturer’s
specifications. Non-irradiated IMR90 cells (passages 5–7) were treated with NCM,
NCM þ 2 ng ml � 1 TGFb, CCM or SASP-CM and applied to downstream analyses
as indicated. Primary human fibroblasts collected from human patients were
authenticated through aSMA staining. For senolytic treatment, sham and
irradiated primary human fibroblasts were treated with indicated concentrations of
DQ or navitoclax for 3 days, starting at day 20 post irradiation or sham exposure.
Cell viability after drug treatment was measured by ATPLite Kits (PerkinElmer;
Waltham, MA) performed according the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luminescence was read using a multi-scan plate reader (Fisher).
For experiments utilizing etoposide-induced senescence, IMR90 human
lung fibroblasts (passage 10; ATCC) were treated for 48 h with 20 mM etoposide
(Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). Etoposide was removed and replaced with
fresh media. Six days after etoposide removal, approximately 60% of IMR90 cells
were SA-b-gal positive. Cells were treated for 48 h with 20 mM D þ 15 mM Q or
10 mM navitoclax (or untreated control) and the percentage of SA-b-gal-positive
cells was determined using a C12FDG-based senescence assay described as
follows46. Briefly, etoposide-treated senescent IMR90 cells were seeded at a
concentration of 5 � 103 cells per well in 96-well plates 24 h before treatment.
Following addition of the drugs, the cells were incubated for 48 h under
20% O2 oxygen conditions. For fluorescence analysis of SA-b-gal activity, cells were
incubated for 1 h with 100 nM Bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Next,
10 mM C12FDG (Setareh Biotech, Eugene, OR) was added to the culture medium
and the cells were incubated for 1.5–2 h. Ten minutes before analysis, the
DNA intercalating Hoechst dye (2 mg ml � 1) was added to the cells. For
quantitative analysis of cell number (Hoechst staining) and number of C12FDG-
positive senescent cells, a laser-based line scanning confocal imager IN Cell
6000 Analyzer was used. All samples were analysed in duplicate with three to five
fields per well.
Immunoanalysis and histopathology. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks corresponding to IPF (n ¼ 27) and control (n ¼ 10) subjects obtained
from the LTRC were sectioned at 5 mm. For p16 immunohistochemistry, the FFPE
unstained slides were deparaffinized through standard methods. Pretreatment
consisted of CC1 Mild Cell conditioning (EDTA for 30 min) with Ventana
Ultraview detection system (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ) run on

 Ventana XT Benchmark autostainer. The Ventana predilute CINtec p16 Histology
(mouse monoclonal antibody clone E6H4) was used as the primary antibody
(32 min at 37 �C). Appropriate positive and negative controls were performed. The
expression of p16 was considered positive when both nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining was identified.
TAF immuno-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was conducted as
previously described25. Briefly, FFPE human lung tissue sections were de-waxed in
Histoclear and hydrated in an alcohol gradient cascade. Antigen retrieval was
achieved by boiling slides in 0.01 M citrate buffer. Cooled and washed slides
were blocked in normal goat serum (1:60) in BSA/PBS and primary antibody
(rabbit polyclonal anti-gH2AX 1:200, Cell Signaling, 9718) was applied and
incubated at 4 �C overnight. Washed slides were then incubated with secondary
antibody for 30 min (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Vector Labs, BA-1000),
washed three times in PBS and incubated with Avidin DCS (1:500) for 20 min.
Slides were dehydrated in an alcohol gradient cascade and denatured for 5 min at
80 �C in hybridization buffer (70% formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO),
25 mM MgCl2, 1 M Tris pH 7.2, 5% blocking reagent (Roche)) containing
2.5 mg ml � 1 Cy-3-labelled telomere-specific (CCCTAA) peptide nuclei acid probe
(Panagene), followed by hybridization for 2 h at room temperature in the dark and
washing. Sections were incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
mounted and imaged. In-depth Z-stacking (a minimum of 40 optical slices
with � 100 oil objective) followed by Huygens (SVI) deconvolution was employed
for imaging.
For in vitro immunocytochemistry, IMR90 cells were plated into eight-well
chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and after attachment
cells were treated for 72 h with prepared CM. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich), permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight with
a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody against aSMA
(F3777, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:200 in PBS with 1% BSA. Cells were then washed
and mounted with ProLong Antifade with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Slides were imaged using a Cytation5 (BioTek, Winooski, VT) microscope at
� 20 magnification. For scoring, an observer blinded to the treatment conditions
counted aSMA-positive cells using a visual threshold for bright fibrous staining
and the observer was blinded to the treatment.
For murine fibrosis assessment, FFPE lung tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 mm
and subjected to haematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome staining. Sections
were reviewed by a blinded pathologist and approximately half of the specimens
were scored by a second blinded pathologist to confirm agreement. Specimens were
scored according to an eight-tier, modified Ashcroft scale47.
Traction force microscopy. Traction analysis was conducted as previously
described31. Briefly, polyacrylamide substrates with shear moduli of 6.4 kPa
were prepared as previously described, and fluorescent sulfate-modified latex
microspheres (0.2 mm, 505/515 ex/em) (FluoSpheres, Life Technologies) were
conjugated to the gel surfaces after treatment with 1 mg ml � 1 of dopamine
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM HEPES solution (pH 8.5). IMR90
cells were plated on the gels overnight and treated as indicated before traction
force measurements. Images of gel surface-conjugated fluorescent beads were
acquired for each cell before and after trypsinization using a Nikon ECLIPSE
Ti microscope at � 10 magnification. Traction forces were estimated by
measuring bead displacement fields and computing corresponding traction
fields using TractionsForAll (http://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/tissue-repair-
mechanobiology/software).
Real-time PCR. For transcriptional analysis on sorted mouse lungs and IMR90
cells treated with CM or NCM, total mRNA from each cell population was isolated
using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated
RNA was purity- and concentration-assessed by nanodrop. cDNA was synthesized
using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase or SuperScript VILO (Invitrogen).
IMR90 fibroblasts exposed to sham or 10 Gy radiation conditions and mouse
lung tissue samples were subjected to Trizol-based RNA extraction, followed
by nanodrop concentration and purity analysis, and cDNA synthesis through
M-MLV reverse transcription (Invitrogen). RT–PCR was performed using
FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) and analysed using a LightCycler
96 (Roche) or Applied Biosystems TaqMan Fast Advanced Mastermix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) analysed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT–PCR primers used in this study are
listed in Supplementary Table 3 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA).
Statistical analyses. GraphPad Prism 6.05 and R 3.2.0 were used for statistical
analysis and generation of graphs. Data are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. Pr0.05
was considered statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, the statistical
method used for multiple comparisons was one-way analysis of variance with
Tukey’s post-hoc comparison. Binary variables were compared using t-tests.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to summarize biomarker and
functional data relationships. For human subject characteristics, continuous and
categorical variables were compared using the analysis of variance F-test and the
w2-test, respectively.
For RNAseq, specimens were randomly assigned to assay processing, to balance
batch preparation, flow cell and lane. The primary endpoint for gene expression
was number of reads per gene, which were sequenced cDNA strands mapped back
to the reference genome. The number of strands per region was used to evaluate
the expression level of the region. Sample quality was evaluated using box plots to
visualize gene counts per sample. In addition, minus versus average plots were used
to assess global bias. The influence of GC content and gene length on gene
expression was also examined. Transcripts quantified by RNAseq that had median
counts of o32 in both control (n ¼ 19) and IPF (n ¼ 20) groups were considered
‘non-expressed’. Normalized count data were evaluated in the same manner as the
un-normalized count data, namely by utilizing minus versus average plots and
visualizations of the GC content and gene length. Conditional quantile
normalization using the cqn Bioconductor package48 was applied to the RNAseq
data, to reduce variability introduced by GC content, gene size and total gene
counts per sample. Gene expression was evaluated using empirical Bayes estimates
obtained through the use of edgeR in R. The results of the gene expression
evaluation were ranked based on P-value and false discovery rate to account for
multiple comparisons.
For human transcriptome analyses, we report expression changes that were
identified in IPF versus control tissue by both microarray and RNAseq at a
significance level of qo0.05. For microarray comparisons, subject data were
stratified based on FVC scores as follows: least severe (FVC 480%), n ¼ 17;
moderate (FVC 50–80%), n ¼ 60; most severe (FVC o50%), n ¼ 16; control,
n ¼ 64. Significance of differential expression was determined using linear
regression via the functions lmFit and eBayes from the limma package49. Models
were adjusted for age.
For mouse model data, linear regression was used to fit a model for each
endpoint and included indicator variables adjusting for time period and group
comparisons using Bleo-Vehicle as the comparison group. Model assumptions
including identification of influential points and the distribution of the residuals
were assessed and, when appropriate, transformations were used on the dependent
variables to improve the model fit. The models were summarized using the
Dunnett’s test, which adjusts for multiple comparisons to a single control.
