Background
The association between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis
has been studied extensively but the temporal order still remains
controversial.
Aims
To examine the association between cannabis use in adoles-
cence and the risk of psychosis after adjustment for prodromal
symptoms and other potential confounders.
Method
The sample (n = 6534) was composed of the prospective general
population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1986.
Information on prodromal symptoms of psychosis and cannabis
use was collected using questionnaires at age 15–16 years.
Participants were followed up for ICD-10 psychotic disorders
until age 30 years using nationwide registers.
Results
The risk of psychosis was elevated in individuals who had tried
cannabis five times or more (hazard ratio, (HR) = 6.5, 95% CI 3.0–
13.9). The association remained statistically significant even
when adjusted for prodromal symptoms, other substance use
and parental psychosis (HR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.1–8.0).
Conclusions
Adolescent cannabis use is associated with increased risk of
psychosis even after adjustment for baseline prodromal symp-
toms, parental psychosis and other substance use.

Increasing evidence points towards a dose–response relationship
between the level of cannabis use and the risk for psychotic out-
comes,1–4 and also indicates that cannabis use results in earlier
onset of psychosis.5,6 Most longitudinal studies have taken reverse
causation into account by excluding individuals with pre-existing
psychotic symptoms, which could have led to overestimates of the
true association.7 Moreover, most of these previous studies have
focused on psychotic symptoms rather than psychotic illness per
se. Several studies have examined the impact of psychotic baseline
severity in relation to the cannabis use–psychosis association (for
example Arseneault et al, Henquet et al, Kelley et al and Bechtold
et al).8–11 To our knowledge, there is only one prospective study
examining cannabis use and psychosis diagnosis (schizophreniform
syndrome) that has taken baseline psychotic (prodromal) symp-
toms into account as a potential confounder before or at the time
of cannabis use.8 Furthermore, cannabis use often co-occurs with
other types of substance use, which may also have an impact on
the psychosis outcome.12
The aim of this study was to examine the predictive association
between adolescent cannabis use at age 15–16 years and the risk of
subsequent psychosis by the age of 30 years in the Northern Finland
Birth Cohort Study 1986 (NFBC1986). An association between can-
nabis use and prodromal symptoms in adolescence has been
reported previously in NFBC1986.13 We hypothesised that cannabis
use increases the risk for psychosis independently of baseline pro-
dromal symptoms, parental psychosis and other forms of substance
use including daily tobacco smoking.
Method
Participants
NFBC1986 is an ongoing follow-up study including 99% of all
births, comprising all the live born children (n = 9432) from the
two northernmost provinces in Finland.14 In all, 7344 (48.8%
boys) participated in the follow-up study in 2001–2002, when the
participants were aged 15–16 years. Participants who signed the
informed consent form and answered the questions on cannabis
use were included in the present study. Adolescents who had
received a psychosis diagnosis before the 15–16-year follow-up
(n = 10) were excluded from the study. The final sample included
6534 individuals (49.1% boys). Information on psychosis-related
diagnoses was collected from the national registries until the end
of 2015, i.e. by the age of 30 years. The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District
in Finland (17 May 2006). The data flow is shown in Fig. 1.
Data collection
Data collection started prospectively before birth and has continued
since.14 A multidisciplinary NFBC field study was conducted when
the adolescents were 15–16 years of age. Data on substance misuse
was collected in 2001–2002, in two different surveys. First, they
received a postal questionnaire, which included questions on
smoking habits. Thereafter, all the participants were invited to a
field study where they completed self-report questionnaires includ-
ing questions on prodromal symptoms for psychosis (PROD-
screen),15 on alcohol use and illicit substance use. For more detailed
information about the study and its design, see Fig. 1 (see also the
NFBC1986 webpage, available at http://www.oulu.fi/nfbc/node/
40696).
Measures
Cannabis use
The data on adolescent cannabis use was collected using question-
naires that the participants received during the field study when
they were aged 15–16 years. The participants were asked ‘Have
you ever used marihuana or hashish?’ as dichotomised (no/yes)
and with options: (a) never, (b) once, (c) 2–4 times, (d) 5 times or

227
 more, or (e) regularly. Options (d) and (e) were pooled because of
small sample size in the two categories.13
Psychosis diagnoses
Information on diagnosed non-organic psychoses (ICD-10: F20,
F22-F29, F302, F312, F315, F323, F333) was gathered from nation-
wide registers: the Care Register for Health Care 2001–2015 and the
Register of Primary Health Care Visits 2011–2015 of the National
Institute for Health and Welfare, disability pensions of the
Finnish Centre for Pensions 2001–2015, and the medication reim-
bursement register of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland
2001–2005. The Care Register contains data on patients discharged
from in-patient care, and since 1998 also data on specialised out-
patient care. The Register of Primary Health Care Visits covers all
out-patient primary healthcare delivered in Finland. For more com-
prehensive information about the registers see Supplement 1 in
Filatova et al.16 Age at the time when psychosis was first detected
was estimated as the onset age of psychosis. Cumulative incidence
of psychoses was calculated.
Prodromal symptoms
When the cohort members were 15–16 years old the participants were
asked about the occurrence of prodromal symptoms during the pre-
vious 6 months (no/yes) using the PROD-screen15. The PROD-ques-
tionnaire has 12 specific items (no/yes) rating, for example feelings
that something strange or inexplicable is taking place within oneself
or in the environment, feelings that one is being followed or influ-
enced in some special way, experience of thoughts running wild or
difficulty in controlling the speed of thoughts. The sum of the ques-
tionnaire was used as a continuous variable in the analyses.
Smoking and substance use other than cannabis
Data on tobacco smoking, alcohol use and use of illicit drugs or
other intoxicants was collected at two points during the 15–16-
year follow-up: information on regular tobacco smoking was ascer-
tained in postal questionnaires and other data on substance use were
collected in the questionnaire that the participants received during
the field study. Daily tobacco smoking was studied with the question
‘Are you currently smoking tobacco daily (no/yes)’. Frequent
drunkenness was questioned as a subjective measure ‘Have you
been drunk during the past year (0, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, 10–19, 20–39
or 40 times or more)’, but we categorised this as ‘Have you been
drunk during the past year 10 times or more (no/yes)’. Data were
also collected on any use of other substances with several questions
(no/yes), for example prescription drug use, use of inhalants and
illicit drugs. Because of the low number of users in each group,
these were combined as ‘Other substance use (no/yes)’.
Family structure
Information on family structure was gathered by combining infor-
mation collected from parents at birth and when the cohort member
was aged 15–16. The classification of the family pattern included
families with (a) both parents living with the participant all the
time (intact families) and (b) other (non-intact) families.13
Place of residence
Data were collected based on the population density of the residen-
tial area at age 15–16 years in order to account for possible con-
founding
due
to
place
of
residence.
The
variable
was
dichotomised in the analyses (urban v. non-urban).
Socioeconomic status of the family
The socioeconomic status of the family was estimated by the
highest education level achieved by either parent when the child
was aged 15–16. This variable was categorised as: professionals
(professionals, entrepreneurs and other white-collar workers)
and non-professionals.13
Parental psychosis
Information on parental psychosis (no/yes) was based on parental
diagnoses in the nationwide registers. These registers include: (a)
Register of Health Care during the years 1972–2015 (Hospital
Discharge Register until 1994). This register also includes visits to

Statistical methods
We used logistic regression analysis with Cox-regression analysis
(hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals) to assess
the effect of cannabis use on the risk of psychosis. Times of emi-
gration and death were used as censoring points in the analyses.
We also conducted additional Cox-regression analyses on canna-
bis use and separate psychosis diagnoses. Cannabis use was
included in the analyses as dichotomised (no/yes) and categorised
(never, once, 2–4 times, 5 times or more). Logistic regression ana-
lysis with odds ratios (ORs with 95% confidence intervals) were
used to study the associations between (a) covariates (i.e. family
characteristics, smoking, alcohol use and other drug use) and can-
nabis use (dichotomised), and (b) covariates and psychosis diag-
nosis. We also studied dose–response with a trend test, in which
cannabis use was entered into the regression analysis as a continu-
ous variable. In the final Cox-regression analyses, we included cov-
ariates that had statistically significant effects (P < 0.05) on both the
outcome of cannabis use and psychosis diagnosis. Additionally, we
also included parental psychosis (no/yes) because it is known to be
a potential risk factor for psychosis although it reached statistical
significance only for psychosis risk and thus did not fulfil the inclu-
sion criteria as described above. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS 21.0.
Results
Background variables, cannabis use and occurrence of
prodromal symptoms and psychosis
The background variables under study and their relation to canna-
bis use and occurrence of psychosis during the follow-up are pre-
sented in Table 1. In all, there were 375 (5.7%) ever users of
cannabis of which 66 (1.0%) had used cannabis more than five
times. Girls reported cannabis use more commonly than boys
(6.3% v. 5.1%, P < 0.05). Among those who had tried cannabis
once, 58.9% were female (112/190). The respective figures for 2–4
times and 5 times or more were 55.5% (66/119) and 48.5% (32/
66). Daily smokers were more likely to use cannabis than non-
daily smokers (22.2% v. 3.3%, P < 0.05, see Table 1).
In total, 1993 adolescents (30.5% of the study sample) reported a
frequency of three or more items on PROD-screen. Altogether 124
individuals with psychoses emerged in the sample population (29
narrow-defined schizophrenia, 10 schizophrenia spectrum disorder
(schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder), 12 bipolar disorder
with psychotic episodes, 19 major depression with psychotic features,
54 other psychosis (brief reactive psychosis, other psychotic disorder).
Of these, 57 out of 124 (46.0%) were female.
Attrition
In the attrition analysis, participants from non-intact families were
less likely to participate in the study than individuals from intact
families (60% v. 70%) when the participants were 15–16 years old.

Adolescent cannabis use and risk of psychosis
229
 Also, participation rate in individuals from non-urban area (72%)
was higher than in those from urban areas (64%).13 Not participat-
ing in the follow-up study was associated with greater risk for psych-
osis (HR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.13–2.04).
Associations between adolescent cannabis use and subsequent
psychosis
The frequencies and hazard ratios for the risk of psychosis in relation
to cannabis use are presented in Table 2. Of the cannabis users, 18 out
of 375 (4.8%) received a psychosis diagnosis during the 15-year
follow-up (4 narrow-defined schizophrenia, 4 schizophrenia spec-
trum disorder, 0 bipolar disorder with psychotic features, 7 major
depression with psychotic features, 3 other psychosis). Among
those without adolescent cannabis use, the incidence of psychosis
was 1.7% (n = 106; 25 narrow-defined schizophrenia, 6 schizophrenia
spectrum disorder, 12 major depression with psychotic features, 12
bipolar disorder with psychotic features, 51 other psychosis).
Use of cannabis at the age 15–16 years was associated with
psychosis (unadjusted HR = 2.85; 95% CI 1.73–4.67). When
studied by category, using cannabis less than five times had no stat-
istically significant association with psychosis. The proportion of
psychoses in each cannabis-use category were as follows: once
2.6% (5/190), 2–4 times 5.0% (6/119) and for five times or more
10.6% (7/66). A dose–response was seen with the trend test
(OR = 1.83; 95% CI 1.45–2.31). More frequent use of cannabis, i.e.
using at least five times, was associated with subsequent psychosis
(HR = 6.47; 3.01–13.91), and this was also evident when the data
was adjusted for prodromal symptoms of psychosis (Table 2).
When further adjusted for daily tobacco smoking, frequent
alcohol use, other substance use and parental psychosis, the associ-
ation between frequent cannabis use in this sample and subsequent
psychosis attenuated but remained statistically significant (Table 2).
When the psychosis diagnoses were analysed separately, diag-
noses of psychotic depression (HR = 9.74, 95% CI 3.83–24.73) and
schizophrenia spectrum disorder (HR = 11.18, 95% CI 3.16–39.62)
were associated with cannabis use. No statistical significance was
reached for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic epi-
sodes and other psychosis in cannabis users v. controls.
Figure 2 presents cumulative incidences of psychosis and
hazard curves for psychosis risk by cannabis use and prodromal
symptoms in four groups. As can be seen in this descriptive
figure, adolescents with prodromal symptoms (cut off ≥3) and
cannabis use had approximately a twofold higher incidence of
psychosis by age 30 years than adolescents with prodromal symp-
toms but no cannabis use.
Discussion
Main findings
Cannabis use at the age of 15–16 years was associated with subse-
quent psychosis diagnosis, and this was evident in the group with
heaviest cannabis use even after controlling for baseline prodromal
symptoms, daily smoking, frequent alcohol use, other substance use
and parental psychosis. We found a dose–response effect suggesting
that more frequent cannabis use is associated with a greater risk for
psychosis.
Our results further confirm the previous results of meta-
analyses1–4 indicating that adolescent cannabis use is associated
with increased risk for psychosis. In our study, this was evident
even when adjusted with multiple covariates. Further, in line with
previous studies,1,3 cannabis use was associated with subsequent
psychosis diagnosis with a dose–response effect.
Comparison with findings from other studies
As stated earlier, several studies have examined the impact of
psychotic baseline severity in relation to the cannabis–psychosis
association (for example, Arseneault et al, Henquet et al, Kelley

 et al and Bechtold et al).8–11 but to our knowledge there is only
one prospective study (Dunedin) examining cannabis use and a
psychosis diagnosis that has adjusted for psychotic baseline sever-
ity.8 In our study, the association between the use of cannabis five
times or more in adolescence and subsequent psychosis remained
statistically significant after adding the prodromal symptoms to
the multivariable model. However, inclusion of the prodromal
symptoms decreased the hazard ratio of the cannabis–psychosis
association approximately by 30%. There might be a subsample
of participants that are self-medicating, but it is unlikely that
the whole decrease in the strength of association would be
because of self-medicating since the study population was only
15- to 16-years olds during the field study. Some studies have
revealed certain schizophrenia risk alleles are associated with
increased use of cannabis.17 In addition, a recent study revealed
that the association between symptoms of cannabis-use disorder
and psychotic-like experiences in young adults could be partly
explained by shared genetic factors.18 Therefore, the decrease in
the strength of the association might rather be because of the
high correlation between these two variables (PROD-screen >3
and cannabis use). However, shared genetic factors likely
explain only part of the association and we are still missing the
data from adolescent samples.
In our previous report those who had tried cannabis had a
higher mean number of prodromal symptoms than the controls
(3.11 v. 1.88; t-test 8.68, P < 0.001).13 Experiencing prodromal
symptoms in adolescence is common19 and in our study 30.5% of
adolescents reported a frequency of three or more items in the
PROD-screen. It should be noted that as this is a population-
based study, individuals have self-reported prodromal symptoms
and therefore differ from clinical or other high-risk samples20
since no interview assessing symptoms was performed. It is likely
that the current estimate of frequency of prodromal symptoms
would have been much lower in an interview. For example, in the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, 38.9% of chil-
dren self-reported experiencing prodromal symptoms in the previ-
ous 6 months; however, observer-rated assessments identified only
13.7% of children as experiencing these symptoms.21
In our current study, participants with prodromal symptoms
and cannabis use in adolescence had double the incidence of
psychosis compared with controls with prodromal symptoms
but no cannabis use (Fig. 2). Current evidence indicates that
early-onset cannabis use predates the onset of psychosis, especially
among those with pre-existing vulnerability and heavier cannabis
use.22 Subjects with prodromal symptoms in adolescence might be
more prone to adverse effects of cannabis, experiencing more
severe prodromal and psychotic symptoms compared with those
without cannabis use.
In line with previous strong evidence,23 parental psychosis was a
significant risk factor for offspring psychosis. However, frequent
cannabis use in adolescence increased the risk for psychotic illness
independently of parental psychosis in our sample. Participants
with both parental psychosis and cannabis use have been shown
to have a greater risk for psychotic outcomes.23 It has been
speculated that there might be a shared genetic aetiology between
cannabis dependence and schizophrenia,24 which may in part
explain the associations between adolescent cannabis use, parental
psychosis and onset of offspring psychotic illness. Unfortunately,
because of the relatively low number of individuals with psychosis
among the cannabis users, we could not reliably study the inter-
action of these risk factors (parental psychosis and adolescent can-
nabis use).
Cannabis-use disorder has been associated with greater
psychosis conversion, independently of other forms of substance
use.12 In order to study the cannabis-specific association with
psychotic illness, we added daily smoking, frequent drunkenness
or illicit drug use other than cannabis to the multivariable
models with parental psychosis history. In these analyses, an
association between frequent cannabis use and psychosis was
shown independent of other substance use. However, statistical
significance between frequent cannabis use and subsequent
psychotic illness was attenuated by 28% when substance use
other than cannabis, i.e. daily smoking, frequent drunkenness
or other forms of substance use, was included in the multivariate
model with prodromal symptoms. This may mostly be explained
by overadjustment, because polysubstance use was very common
among cannabis users. For example, 45% of the cannabis users
were also daily smokers and 66% of cannabis users were frequent
alcohol users. Furthermore, assessing the true significance of can-
nabis use or cigarette smoking may also be challenging because
cannabis users usually smoke cannabis mixed with tobacco.25
We reported that individuals from non-intact families (60% v.
70%) and urban areas (64% v. 72%) were less likely to participate
in the NFBC field study in 2001–2002. As these individuals were
more likely to have ever used cannabis, it is likely that our
proportion of individuals using cannabis is underestimated, but as
the participation rates are still very good it is unlikely that this
affected the overall conclusions of the study. Although boys
report cannabis use more often in general,26 here girls reported
more cannabis use than boys (6.3% v. 5.1%). However, this was
mostly because of more sporadic use than in boys. It can be specu-
lated that girls of this age (15–16 years) might be more prone to
single experiments with cannabis because of earlier puberty.
Finally, although there were more cannabis users among girls,
gender did not reach statistical significance for psychosis in the
crude analyses. Unfortunately, we were unable to analyse psychosis
risks separately by gender because of the low number of cannabis
users.
We reported also that specifically diagnoses of psychotic depres-
sion and schizophrenia spectrum disorder were associated with can-
nabis use. Interestingly, no significance was found for narrow
schizophrenia. As a result of the small number of cases strong con-
clusions cannot be drawn, since we could not analyse the effect of
frequent use of cannabis on separate diagnoses. However, this has
not been reported in previous prospective samples to our knowledge
and should be noted in further studies.
Strengths and limitations
There are notable strengths in our study.
(a) This is one of the largest birth cohort studies with high genetic
and ethnic homogeneity with relatively low attrition.
(b) We were able to use several nationwide registers, and only a
very small proportion (2.1%) of cohort members died or
emigrated during the follow-up. Therefore, the coverage of
clinically significant psychosis diagnoses within this popula-
tion during the 15-year-follow-up can be considered to be
high.
(c) We made substantial efforts to minimise the possibility of
residual confounding.
(d) Furthermore, adjusting for prodromal symptoms indicated a
possible temporal or even causal link between cannabis use
and subsequent psychosis that is in line with previous research.
However, the following limitations should be taken into account
when interpreting our results.
(a) The number of cannabis users with a psychosis diagnosis was
relatively low. Also, no prospective data on cannabis use
before or after the age of 15–16 years was available.
Adolescent cannabis use and risk of psychosis
231
 (b) Information on substance use was collected using self-report,
which may give rise to a bias of underreporting and possible
underestimation of the true association.7
(c) Cannabinoid levels of cannabis may vary considerably, and
different strains may have different psychotropic potentials.27
The THC/CBD concentration of different strains has also
increased considerably over the years28 and may alter the gen-
eralizability of our results. This should be noted in future
studies.
(d) Unfortunately, we did not have any data on other family/rela-
tives with psychosis and this should be noted in order to
account for genetic vulnerability more comprehensively.
(e) Individuals from non-intact families and urban areas were less
likely to participate in the NFBC field study in 2001–2002,
which may introduce bias. Further, adolescents with pro-
dromal symptoms may also be less likely to answer on self-
report questionnaires, as the risk of psychosis was higher
among the non-participants compared with those who
participated.
Implications
Our study provides further evidence on the temporal order of ado-
lescent cannabis use and psychosis. According to our results, canna-
bis use increases the risk for subsequent psychosis even after
prodromal symptoms of psychosis, parental psychosis and other
substance use have been taken into account. However, it is still con-
troversial whether cannabis use alone is a sufficient risk factor for
psychosis or rather a component cause in the pathogenesis. The
importance of psychoeducation and prevention of adolescent can-
nabis use is emphasised as adolescents using cannabis and having
prodromal symptoms were at twofold risk for subsequent psychosis.

poems
I’m getting there – A patient-inspired poem
Katherine Murdoch
At 11, I was standing in the courtroom. Trying to fix you
Emotional breakdowns and abuse were my toys
Trying to fly out of bedroom windows
While my family didn’t want the burden of my cloud, in theirs
I became you.
College didn’t get on with me
So the hairdressing was gonna be the new start
Everyone wished for me
But hairspray got in my throat, you see
They wanted my smile to beam and my appearance to gleam
But my cloud didn’t see the sun
The only shine my body sees is when it’s imprinting on my skin, cold
See the imprint is one, which will keep
It scars deep.
And the tiny white mountains on me,
My skin,
Are stared at by climbing eyes
Who could not possibly comprehend their origin
The grey lifeless cloud, which won’t just hide away
In another place.
And I know what you think of these lines, so a cocoon of my house is fine
The front door, firmly shut, cut
But the same room in the same house, the walls are mocking me and
My body is imprinted on the sheets like stone, alone
And the little red raindrops are falling to the floor, staining my existence with a plop
But there is no rainbow without rain,
So being able to leave my bed or throwing up everything I consume with the tablets I ingest is the decision to be alive
Not to thrive.
So I’m reaching my hands out for you to see
To see the white mountains on my skin
My mum is angry, she wants you to see and society to believe
The tablets are endless, five times a day, before not after meals
20/30/80 mg of this, that, and stop
They don’t work on me
I’ve tried counselling opening up to who, what, when
So believe me, help me, help me to be the daughter I’m supposed to be.
You breathe,
And tentatively try to solve the soggy puzzle of my mind
That really is quite kind but I’m a bit messed up, up there
The notion of fixing me up in a shiny box, with my name neatly on the front, has gone
Long gone
But I came here to share
I’m getting there.
