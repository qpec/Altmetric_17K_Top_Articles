BACKGROUND
Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody to the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and inter-
leukin-23, was evaluated as an intravenous induction therapy in two populations with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. Ustekinumab was also evaluated as 
subcutaneous maintenance therapy.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients to receive a single intravenous dose of ustekinumab 
(either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo in two 
induction trials. The UNITI-1 trial included 741 patients who met the criteria for pri-
mary or secondary nonresponse to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists or had 
unacceptable side effects. The UNITI-2 trial included 628 patients in whom conven-
tional therapy failed or unacceptable side effects occurred. Patients who completed 
these induction trials then participated in IM-UNITI, in which the 397 patients who 
had a response to ustekinumab were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous main-
tenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks) 
or placebo. The primary end point for the induction trials was a clinical response at 
week 6 (defined as a decrease from baseline in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
[CDAI] score of ≥100 points or a CDAI score <150). The primary end point for the 
maintenance trial was remission at week 44 (CDAI score <150).
RESULTS
The rates of response at week 6 among patients receiving intravenous ustekinumab at 
a dose of either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg per kilogram were significantly higher 
than the rates among patients receiving placebo (in UNITI-1, 34.3%, 33.7%, and 21.5%, 
respectively, with P≤0.003 for both comparisons with placebo; in UNITI-2, 51.7%, 
55.5%, and 28.7%, respectively, with P<0.001 for both doses). In the groups receiving 
maintenance doses of ustekinumab every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks, 53.1% and 48.8%, 
respectively, were in remission at week 44, as compared with 35.9% of those receiving 
placebo (P 
= 
0.005 and P 
= 
0.04, respectively). Within each trial, adverse-event rates were 
similar among treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, those receiving 
intravenous ustekinumab had a significantly higher rate of response than did those 
receiving placebo. Subcutaneous ustekinumab maintained remission in patients who 
had a clinical response to induction therapy. (Funded by Janssen Research and Devel-

Ustekinumab for Crohn’s Disease
C
rohn’s disease is a chronic inflam-
matory disease of the gastrointestinal 
tract that is treated with glucocorticoids, 
immunosuppressants, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
antagonists, or integrin inhibitors.1-3 The draw-
backs of these agents include an increased risk 
of infection4-7 and cancer8 and limited efficacy.9 
Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody to the 
p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 
that has been approved for use in the treatment 
of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.10 In previous 
trials involving patients with psoriasis in which 
ustekinumab was administered subcutaneously 
for up to 5 years, the drug was not associated with 
an increased risk of serious adverse events.11,12
In a previous phase 2b trial, intravenous 
ustekinumab induction therapy in patients with 
Crohn’s disease that was refractory to treatment 
with TNF antagonists showed a significant bene-
fit in terms of clinical response but not remis-
sion, and subcutaneously administered mainte-
nance doses of ustekinumab were efficacious 
during a period of 22 weeks.2 This phase 3 de-
velopment program for the treatment of Crohn’s 
disease with ustekinumab consisted of two 
8-week induction trials (UNITI-1 and UNITI-2) 
and one 44-week maintenance trial (IM-UNITI), 
representing 52 weeks of therapy.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 were conducted at 178 sites 
in 23 countries and 175 sites in 23 countries, 
respectively, and IM-UNITI was conducted at 
260 sites in 27 countries. All were double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials performed from July 
2011 through June 2015. The institutional review 
board at each participating institution approved 
the protocols (which are available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org), and all the 
patients provided written informed consent. All 
three trials were conducted in accordance with 
the protocols and statistical analysis plans (avail-
able with the protocols).
A steering committee composed of academic 
investigators and Janssen scientists designed the 
trials. The steering committee and Janssen per-
sonnel analyzed and interpreted data and con-
tributed to the manuscript. The first two authors 
wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All the 
authors approved the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication and vouch for the 
veracity and completeness of the data and analy-
ses and the fidelity of the trials to the protocols. 
Editorial support was provided by Janssen.
Patients
Patients 18 years of age or older who had had 
Crohn’s disease for at least 3 months and had a 
score on the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
(CDAI) of 220 to 450 out of a possible range of 
0 to 600 (with higher scores indicating more 
severe disease)13,14 were enrolled in the induction 
trials. In UNITI-1, patients were required to have 
received one or more TNF antagonists at ap-
proved doses and to have met the criteria for 
primary nonresponse (the absence of a response) 
or secondary nonresponse (a response that was 
not maintained) or to have had unacceptable side 
effects (for details, see the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org). In UNITI-2, patients 
were required to have had treatment failure or 
unacceptable side effects when treated with im-
munosuppressants (i.e., azathioprine, mercapto-
purine, or methotrexate) or glucocorticoids. Pa-
tients in UNITI-2 could have previously received 
one or more TNF antagonists provided they had 
not had unacceptable side effects and had not 
met the criteria for primary or secondary non-
response to treatment. They were also required 
to have objective evidence of active Crohn’s dis-
ease, which was defined as either a serum level 
of C-reactive protein (CRP) of more than 3.0 mg 
per liter, a fecal calprotectin level of more than 
250 mg per kilogram of body weight, or endo-
scopic ulcerations in the ileum, the colon, or both. 
Patients who completed UNITI-1 or UNITI-2 
could enroll in the IM-UNITI maintenance trial. 
The primary (randomized) population in IM-UNITI 
consisted of patients who had a clinical response 
to ustekinumab induction therapy.
Stable doses of immunosuppressants, mesala-
mine, antibiotics, or oral glucocorticoids (≤40 mg 
of prednisone per day or ≤9 mg of budesonide 
per day) or a combination thereof were permit-
ted. Patients were required to have no history of 
treatment with interleukin-12 or interleukin-23 
antagonists. Previous treatment with intravenous 
glucocorticoids, TNF antagonists, or natalizumab 
was not permitted for specified washout peri-
ods (for details, see the UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and 
IM-UNITI protocols). Patients with gastrointes-
tinal conditions that might require surgery or

might preclude the use of the CDAI to assess the 
response to treatment and those with infections 
(including active tuberculosis) or a history of 
cancer were excluded.
Therapies for Crohn’s disease were maintained 
at stable doses from baseline of induction ther-
apy through week 44 of maintenance therapy. In 
patients who had a response to treatment after 
induction and who were receiving glucocorticoids, 
tapering was initiated at week 0 of IM-UNITI 
(for details, see the Supplementary Appendix).
Randomization
At week 0, patients in both induction trials were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive a 
single intravenous infusion of 130 mg of ustekinu-
mab, a weight-range–based dose that approxi-
mated 6 mg of ustekinumab per kilogram of 
body weight, or placebo. (The administration of 
6 mg of ustekinumab per kilogram meant that 
patients weighing ≤55 kg received 260 mg, those 
weighing >55 kg and ≤85 kg received 390 mg, 
and those weighing >85 kg received 520 mg.)
In the maintenance trial, patients who had a 
response to ustekinumab induction therapy at 
week 8 were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 
to receive subcutaneous injections of 90 mg of 
ustekinumab every 8 weeks, 90 mg of ustekinum-
ab every 12 weeks, or placebo through week 40. 
Patients in the maintenance trial who met loss-
of-response criteria (defined as a CDAI score 
≥220 and an increase from their baseline CDAI 
score of ≥100 points) between weeks 8 and 32 
underwent dose adjustment from receiving place-
bo to receiving ustekinumab every 8 weeks or from 
receiving ustekinumab every 12 weeks to receiv-
ing ustekinumab every 8 weeks; patients receiving 
ustekinumab every 8 weeks continued to receive 
that regimen after loss of response. Other patient 
populations entered IM-UNITI but did not under-
go randomization (for details, see the IM-UNITI 
protocol).
Randomization was performed centrally with 
the use of permuted blocks in all trials. Trial re-
gion and CDAI score (≤300 or >300) were used 
as the stratification variables in both induction 
trials, and the initial response to TNF antagonist 
therapy (yes or no) was used in UNITI-1; the dose 
of ustekinumab during the induction trial and 
remission at week 0 of the maintenance trial 
were the stratification variables in IM-UNITI.
End Points
In both induction trials, the primary end point 
was clinical response at week 6, which was de-
fined as a decrease from baseline in CDAI score 
of at least 100 points or a total CDAI score less 
than 150.13,14 Major secondary end points were 
clinical remission at week 8 (CDAI score <150), 
clinical response at week 8, and a decrease from 
baseline in CDAI score of at least 70 points at 
weeks 3 and 6. Results are presented here for the 
following other prespecified secondary end points: 
clinical response at week 3; clinical remission at 
weeks 3 and 6; decrease from baseline in CDAI 
score of at least 70 points at week 8; change in 
CDAI score, change in CRP level, and normaliza-
tion of CRP level (<3.0 mg per liter) at weeks 3, 
6, and 8; and change in fecal calprotectin level 
and normalization of fecal calprotectin level 
(≤250 or ≤100 mg per kilogram) at week 6.
In the maintenance trial, the primary end 
point was clinical remission at week 44 (CDAI 
score <150). Major secondary end points at 
week 44 were clinical response (decrease in 
CDAI score of ≥100 points from week 0 of induc-
tion or clinical remission), maintenance of re-
mission among patients in remission at week 0 
of the maintenance trial, glucocorticoid-free re-
mission, and remission in patients who met the 
criteria for primary or secondary nonresponse or 
who had unacceptable side effects when treated 
with a TNF antagonist (UNITI-1 population). Re-
sults are presented here for the following other 
prespecified secondary end points: clinical re-
mission at week 44 in the subgroup of patients 
in whom conventional therapy failed (UNITI-2 
population), change in CDAI score through week 
44, change in CRP level through week 44, and 
change in fecal calprotectin level at week 44.
For the induction and maintenance trials, 
patients with treatment failure (i.e., those who 
had a surgery related to Crohn’s disease, had 
prohibited changes in concomitant medications 
for Crohn’s disease, or had begun receiving a 
prohibited concomitant medication) or who had 
data that were insufficient to calculate CDAI 
scores (i.e., data on fewer than four of the eight 
CDAI components) were not considered to have 
a response or to be in remission. Patients who 
had a loss of response or discontinued the trial 
agent owing to lack of therapeutic effect or an 
adverse event of worsening of disease were also

Ustekinumab for Crohn’s Disease
considered to have treatment failure in the main-
tenance trial.
Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety
At weeks 0, 3, 6, and 8 during induction and at 
4-week intervals during maintenance, CDAI scores, 
adverse events, concomitant medications, and 
CRP levels were evaluated. Fecal calprotectin 
levels were evaluated at weeks 0 and 6 during 
induction and at weeks 8, 24, and 44 during 
maintenance. Quality-of-life measures (i.e., the 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and 
the Short-Form 36 Health Questionnaire), health 
economic outcomes, and outcomes for endos-
copy (performed in a subtrial) were examined 
but are not reported here. The statistical analysis 
section details the prespecified analyses that are 
presented in this report; a comprehensive list of 
all prespecified analyses can be found in the 
statistical analysis plans for each trial (see the 
protocols).
In UNITI-1 and UNITI-2, follow-up for patient 
safety occurred either through week 8 in patients 
who entered the maintenance trial or 20 weeks 
after the induction dose in patients who did not 
enter the maintenance trial. In IM-UNITI, patients 
were followed through week 44. To maintain 
blinding in IM-UNITI, all the patients received 
either ustekinumab or placebo every 4 weeks 
from week 8 through week 40.
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
Serum ustekinumab levels were evaluated at 
weeks 0, 3, 6, and 8 during induction and every 
4 weeks during maintenance. Antidrug antibod-
ies were evaluated by means of a drug-tolerant 
electrochemiluminescence assay at weeks 0 and 
6 during induction and at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 
44 during maintenance.
Statistical Analysis
For both induction trials and for the maintenance 
trial, we compared primary and major secondary 
end points for each ustekinumab group and the 
placebo group using a two-sided, Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel chi-square test with adjustment 
for the stratification variables. In the mainte-
nance trial, induction trial (UNITI-1 or UNITI-2) 
was added as a stratification variable. The type I 
error rate in each of the three trials was con-
trolled at an alpha 
level of  
0.05 for the primary 
and major secondary end points with the use of 
a hierarchical testing procedure (for details, see 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The analyses of secondary end points (i.e., all 
end points except for the primary and major 
secondary end points) were to proceed regard-
less of the outcomes for the primary and major 
secondary end points. These secondary end points 
were not adjusted for multiplicity. Statements of 
significance for these secondary end points are 
based on nominal P values and should be inter-
preted cautiously.
Continuous end points were analyzed by means 
of analysis of covariance on van der Waerden 
normal scores. Dichotomous end points were 
analyzed by means of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel 
chi-square test. Rules for treatment failure and 
missing data were also applied for secondary 
end points. For continuous end points, baseline 
values (from week 0 of induction) were assigned 
from the time of treatment failure, and the last 
available observation was carried forward for 
missing data. For dichotomous end points, the 
rules for treatment failure and missing data that 
were specified for the primary end point were 
applied.
To evaluate the consistency of the treatment 
effect, we conducted prespecified subgroup anal-
yses. The results of the subgroup analyses of the 
primary end point for each trial and for the first 
major secondary end point of remission at week 
8 of UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 can be found in Fig-
ures S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
In the induction trials, calculations for sam-
ple size and power were based on comparisons 
of the group receiving 6 mg of ustekinumab per 
kilogram and the placebo group. We calculated 
that 675 patients (225 patients per treatment) in 
UNITI-1 and 600 patients (200 patients per treat-
ment) in UNITI-2 would provide a power of more 
than 90% at a two-sided significance level of 
0.05 to detect the following: a between-group 
difference of 15 percentage points in UNITI-1, 
assuming a response rate of 25% for placebo 
and 40% for 6 mg of ustekinumab per kilogram 
at week 6 (on the basis of data from the phase 2b 
trial2), and a between-group difference of 17 per-
centage points in UNITI-2, assuming a response 
rate of 33% for placebo and 50% for 6 mg of 
ustekinumab per kilogram at week 6 (on the basis 
of data from the phase 2a trial15). For the main-

Ustekinumab for Crohn’s Disease
tenance trial, calculations of sample size and 
power were performed with assumed remission 
rates at week 44 of 15% for the placebo group 
and 35% for the group receiving 90 mg of 
ustekinumab every 8 weeks, with 100 patients 
per treatment group yielding 90% power, and 
with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.
Efficacy analyses were conducted in accor-
dance with the intention-to-treat principle. Safety 
analyses were performed for all patients who 
received at least one dose of a trial agent, and 
pharmacokinetics analyses were performed for 
those receiving ustekinumab.
Results
Patients
In UNITI-1 and UNITI-2, 741 and 628 patients, 
respectively, underwent randomization. The per-
centages of patients who discontinued the trial 
prematurely were low in both trials (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Overall, 1281 patients 
were enrolled in IM-UNITI, with 397 patients in 
the primary population and 884 patients in the 
population that did not undergo randomization. 
Few patients who underwent randomization dis-
continued the trial agent before week 44 (Fig. S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
In both induction trials and in the mainte-
nance trial, baseline and disease characteristics 
were similar among the groups (Table 1, and 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
UNITI-1, approximately 50% of the patients who 
had been treated with two or more TNF antago-
nists met the criteria for primary or secondary 
nonresponse or had unacceptable side effects; 
29.1% fulfilled the criteria for primary nonre-
sponse, 69.4% fulfilled the criteria for secondary 
nonresponse, and 36.4% had unacceptable side 
effects. In UNITI-2, 68.6% of patients had not 
received TNF antagonists (data not shown).
Induction Therapy
In UNITI-1, the percentages of patients who had 
a response at week 6 were significantly higher in 
the groups that received ustekinumab at a dose 
of either 130 mg or 6 mg per kilogram (34.3% 
and 33.7%, respectively) than in the placebo group 
(21.5%), with an absolute difference between 
130 mg of ustekinumab and placebo of 12.8 
percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 
5.0 to 20.7; P 
= 
0.002) and between 6 mg of

In UNITI-1, data on duration of disease were available for 246 patients in the placebo group.
§ 
 
The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) consists of eight factors, with each factor totaled after adjustment with a weighting factor ranging from 1 to 30. CDAI scores range from 
 
approximately 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity.
¶  
The immunosuppressants included azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate.
‖ 
 
The glucocorticoids included budesonide.
**  
Patients may have reported more than one reason for treatment failure. Primary nonresponse refers to the absence of an initial response. Secondary nonresponse refers to an initial 
response that was not maintained.

ustekinumab per kilogram and placebo of 12.3 
percentage points (95% CI, 4.5 to 20.1; P 
= 
0.003) 
(Fig. 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In UNITI-2, the percentages of patients 
who had a response at week 6 were also sig-
nificantly higher in the groups that received 
ustekinumab at a dose of either 130 mg or 6 mg 
per kilogram (51.7% and 55.5%, respectively) 
than in the placebo group (28.7%), with an abso-
lute difference between 130 mg of ustekinumab 
and placebo of 23.0 percentage points (95% CI, 
13.8 to 32.1) and between 6 mg of ustekinumab 
per kilogram and placebo of 26.8 percentage 
points (95% CI, 17.7 to 35.9) (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Fig. 1, and Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In both trials, the efficacy of 
ustekinumab was generally consistent in the two 
treatment groups across prespecified subgroups 
(Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The rates at which patients met the criteria 
for all major secondary efficacy end points that 
were included in the hierarchical testing plan 
(i.e., remission at week 8, response at week 8, 
and decrease from baseline in CDAI score of ≤70 
points at weeks 3 and 6) were significantly higher 
in the two ustekinumab groups than in the pla-
cebo group (Fig. 1A and 1B, and Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The differences be-
tween the two ustekinumab groups and the pla-
cebo group in the rates of response and remis-
sion at the remaining trial visits (i.e., response at 
week 3, remission at weeks 3 and 6, decrease 
from baseline in CDAI score of ≤70 points at 
week 8, and change in CDAI score) were nomi-
nally significant, except with regard to remission 
at week 3 for the group in both trials that re-
ceived 130 mg of ustekinumab (Fig. 1A and 1B, 
and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In the induction trials, both doses of ustekinu-
mab were associated with greater reductions in 
and normalization of serum CRP levels than was 
placebo. The differences between ustekinumab 
and placebo were nominally significant and were 
observed as early as week 3 and persisted through 
week 8. Similar effects were observed for fecal 
calprotectin levels at week 6 (Fig. 2A and 2B, and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Maintenance Therapy
In IM-UNITI, the percentage of patients who 
were in remission at week 44 was significantly 
higher in the groups that received 90 mg of 
ustekinumab every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks 
(53.1% and 48.8%, respectively) than in the pla-
cebo group (35.9%), with an absolute difference 
between treatment every 8 weeks and placebo of 
17.2 percentage points (95% CI, 5.3 to 29.2; 
P 
= 
0.005) and between treatment every 12 weeks 
and placebo of 13.0 percentage points (95% CI, 
1.1 to 24.9; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 3, and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The efficacy of usteki-
numab was generally consistent in the two treat-
ment groups across prespecified subgroups (Fig. 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The percentage of patients who continued to 
have a response at week 44 was significantly 
higher in the groups that received treatment every 
8 weeks or every 12 weeks than in the placebo 
group (P 
= 
0.02 and P 
= 
0.03, respectively) (Fig. 3A). 
The rate of remission at week 44 was signifi-
cantly higher among patients who entered main-
tenance in remission and who received treat-
ment every 8 weeks — but not those who 
received treatment every 12 weeks — than 
among those who received placebo (Fig. 3A). The 
rate of glucocorticoid-free remission at week 44 
was significantly higher in the group that re-
ceived treatment every 8 weeks — but only 
nominally higher in the group that received 
treatment every 12 weeks (owing to the hierarchi-
cal testing procedure) — than in the placebo 
group. The absolute between-group differences 
for the subgroup of patients who had met the 
criteria for primary or secondary nonresponse to 
TNF antagonists or who had unacceptable side 
effects (44.8% of the primary population en-
rolled from UNITI-1) were similar to those ob-
served for the population included in the analy-
sis of the primary end point (i.e., patients from 
both UNITI-1 and UNITI-2) but were not signifi-
cant (Fig. 3B).
Analyses of the prespecified secondary end 
points showed that in the subgroup of patients 
in whom conventional therapy failed (55.2% of 
the primary population enrolled from UNITI-2), 
the percentage of patients who were in remission 
at week 44 was higher in the group that received 
treatment every 8 weeks than in the placebo 
group, and the difference was nominally signifi-
cant; however, the percentage was only numeri-
cally higher in the group that received treatment 
every 12 weeks than in the placebo group 
(Fig. 3B). The percentages of patients who were 
in sustained clinical remission (i.e., remission at

Ustekinumab for Crohn’s Disease
Figure 1. Patients with a Clinical Response or Clinical Remission during Induction.
Panel A shows the rates of clinical response (i.e., a decrease from baseline in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 
score of ≥100 points or a CDAI score <150) and Panel B shows the rates of clinical remission (CDAI score <150) at weeks 
3, 6, and 8 of the induction trials in the groups receiving ustekinumab at a dose of either 130 mg or 6 mg per kilogram 
and in the placebo groups. For all the P values in gray, P<0.05 is only nominally significant, since the end point is not 
among the type I error–controlled end points, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Weight-range–based 
doses of ustekinumab approximating 6 mg per kilogram of body weight are as follows: 260 mg (weight, ≤55 kg), 390 mg 
(weight, >55 kg and ≤85 kg), and 520 mg (weight, >85 kg). Patients who had a surgery related to Crohn’s disease, had 
prohibited changes in concomitant medications for Crohn’s disease, or had begun receiving a prohibited concomitant 
medication were considered to have treatment failure (treated as if they did not have a clinical response or clinical re-
mission) from that time point onward, regardless of their CDAI score. Patients for whom there were insufficient data 
to calculate the CDAI score at a given time point were treated as if they did not have a clinical response or clinical re-
mission at that time point.

the groups that received treatment every 8 weeks 
or every 12 weeks than in the placebo group 
(46.1% and 40.3%, respectively, vs. 26.0%; P<0.001 
and P 
= 
0.02 [both nominal]). Median CDAI scores 
worsened in the placebo group and remained 
generally unchanged in both treatment groups, 
with the group that received treatment every 
8 weeks having consistently better scores than 
the placebo group from week 24 onward and the 
group that received treatment every 12 weeks 
having better scores than the placebo group from 
week 32 onward (Fig. 3C).
More than half the patients who did not 
have a response to a single dose of intravenous 
ustekinumab at induction and received an addi-
tional 90-mg dose of subcutaneous ustekinumab 
at the initiation of maintenance therapy had a 
clinical response 8 weeks after receiving the 
90-mg dose. Of those patients, 68.1% continued 
to have a response and 50.2% were in remission 
at week 44, after receiving 90 mg of ustekinumab 
every 8 weeks (for details, see the Supplementary 
Appendix). The efficacy results for patients in the 
primary population whose dose was escalated at 
the time of loss of response are included in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Median CRP levels for patients in both usteki-
numab groups remained generally unchanged at 
week 44, whereas the levels for patients in the 
placebo group increased over time, with clear 
separation from the ustekinumab groups begin-
ning at week 12 (Fig. 3D). The percentages of 
patients in whom the fecal calprotectin level re-
mained at 250 mg per kilogram or lower were 
also significantly higher in both ustekinumab

Safety
In UNITI-1, the rates of adverse events in the 
groups receiving 130 mg of ustekinumab, 6 mg 
of ustekinumab per kilogram, and placebo were 
64.6%, 65.9%, and 64.9%, respectively. The per-

Panel A shows the rates at week 44 of the maintenance trial (after a total of 52 weeks of treatment) of clinical remission, clinical re-
sponse, clinical remission among patients in clinical remission at week 0 of the maintenance trial, and glucocorticoid-free remission. 
Panel B shows the rates of clinical remission at week 44 in the subgroup of patients who met the criteria for primary or secondary non-
response or had unacceptable side effects when treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (UNITI-1 population) and in the 
subgroup of patients who did not have a response or had unacceptable side effects when treated with previous conventional therapy 
(UNITI-2 population). Panel C shows the median change in the CDAI score from week 0 of the maintenance trial, and Panel D shows  
the median change in C-reactive protein levels from week 0 of the maintenance trial. In Panels A and B, for the P values in gray, P<0.05 
is only nominally significant according to the hierarchical testing procedure and should therefore be interpreted with caution. In Panels C 
and D, the white data points indicate that P<0.05 for the comparison with placebo, but these values are only nominally significant since 
the end point is not among the type I error–controlled end points and should therefore be interpreted with caution.

adverse events were 4.7%, 2.9%, and 5.8%. Rates 
of adverse events occurring within 1 hour after 
an ustekinumab infusion were similar across the 
groups receiving both doses in UNITI-1 and 
UNITI-2. At week 44 of IM-UNITI, the percent-
ages of patients in the primary population with 
at least one adverse event in the groups receiving 
90 mg of ustekinumab every 8 weeks, 90 mg of 
ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and placebo were 
81.7%, 80.3%, and 83.5%, respectively. The per-
centages of patients with a serious adverse event 
were 9.9%, 12.1%, and 15.0%, respectively. Seri-
ous infection developed in 13 patients across all 
three study groups, occurring at rates of 2.3% in 
the group receiving ustekinumab every 8 weeks, 
5.3% in the group receiving ustekinumab every 
12 weeks, and 2.3% in the placebo group.
One patient, in the group receiving 6 mg of 
ustekinumab per kilogram in UNITI-1, had a 
preexisting monoclonal gammopathy and did not 
continue to the maintenance trial. The patient 
received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma after 
the 20-week safety follow-up period. In UNITI-2, 
basal-cell carcinoma developed in one patient 
receiving placebo.
There were two patients with basal-cell carci-
nomas in the IM-UNITI primary (randomized) 
population, one in the placebo group and one in 
the group receiving 90 mg of ustekinumab every 
8 weeks. Among patients who were not in the 
primary population, six nonmelanoma skin can-
cers occurred: basal-cell carcinoma in one patient 
assigned to receive ustekinumab every 8 weeks, 
two squamous-cell carcinomas in one patient 
receiving 90 mg of ustekinumab subcutaneously 
at week 0 of the maintenance trial (treatment 
was discontinued before the next dose), and two 
basal-cell carcinomas and one squamous-cell 
carcinoma in a patient who did not receive 
ustekinumab. (The patient had had a response to 
intravenous placebo and in IM-UNITI was as-
signed to maintenance with placebo.) Of the five 
patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer who 
were assigned to receive ustekinumab or placebo, 
three were currently using or had previously used 
immunosuppressants. In one patient assigned to 
receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks, a metastatic 
adenocarcinoma developed in the small bowel 
and a carcinoid tumor was found incidentally in 
the resected bowel.
During 1 year of therapy, there were no deaths 
or instances of the reversible posterior leukoen-
cephalopathy syndrome. Three opportunistic in-
fections occurred, including one case of listeria 
meningitis in a patient in the group receiving 
6 mg of ustekinumab per kilogram who was 
taking 30 mg of prednisone per day (in UNITI-1) 
and two nonserious cases of esophageal candi-
diasis — one in a patient receiving placebo who 
was taking 40 mg of prednisone per day and 
methotrexate (in UNITI-2) and one in a patient 
who was not in the primary IM-UNITI popula-
tion and was receiving 90 mg of ustekinumab 
subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Pantoprazole and 
infliximab were prescribed within 2 weeks before 
the diagnosis of candidiasis.
One case of active pulmonary tuberculosis oc-
curred approximately 10 months after the admin-
istration of a single intravenous induction dose 
of 130 mg of ustekinumab in a patient assigned 
to receive placebo during maintenance therapy. 
A nonfatal stroke that resulted from a ruptured 
cerebral aneurysm was reported in a patient who 
had received a single dose of 90 mg of ustekinu-
mab subcutaneously at week 0 of the mainte-
nance trial.
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
At week 8 of UNITI-1, the respective median se-
rum levels of ustekinumab in the groups receiv-
ing 130 mg of ustekinumab and 6 mg per kilo-
gram were 2.1 μg per milliliter (interquartile 
range, 1.0 to 3.4) and 6.4 μg per milliliter (inter-
quartile range, 3.3 to 9.6), respectively. At week 8 
of UNITI-2, the respective levels were 2.0 μg per 
milliliter (interquartile range, 1.2 to 3.5) and 
6.3 μg per milliliter (interquartile range, 3.9 to 
9.6). At weeks 24 and 44 of IM-UNITI, the median 
serum levels of ustekinumab in the group receiv-
ing 90 mg every 8 weeks were approximately 
three times as high as the levels in the group 
receiving 90 mg every 12 weeks (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In all three trials, an 
association was observed between serum usteki-
numab level and remission (Tables S6 and S7 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
After testing was conducted with an assay that 
can detect antidrug antibodies in the presence 
of ustekinumab, two patients who had received 
130 mg of intravenous ustekinumab were posi-
tive for antidrug antibodies, and both had neu-
tralizing antibodies. In IM-UNITI, the incidence 
of antidrug antibodies at week 44 was low (27 of 
1154 patients [2.3%]). Given the small number

of patients with antidrug antibodies, no definite 
conclusions can be drawn about their effect, al-
though their presence did not preclude efficacy.
Discussion
Both ustekinumab induction regimens showed 
consistent benefit over placebo, irrespective of 
previous treatment or response to a TNF antago-
nist. At week 6 of the induction trials, response 
rates for both intravenous ustekinumab doses 
were significantly higher than those for placebo. 
At week 44 of the maintenance trial, among 
those who had a response to ustekinumab dur-
ing induction, both subcutaneous ustekinumab 
doses showed significantly higher efficacy than 
placebo.
Ustekinumab was significantly better than 
placebo with respect to the primary and all major 
secondary end points for induction at both doses, 
with the highest rates of response and remission 
observed with the dose of 6 mg per kilogram. In 
UNITI-1, patients had relatively severe Crohn’s 
disease of long duration and had met the criteria 
for primary or secondary nonresponse or had 
unacceptable adverse effects associated with at 
least one TNF antagonist. In UNITI-2, the ma-
jority of patients had not received a TNF antago-
nist, and the median baseline CDAI score was 
similar to those reported in previous induction 
trials in populations in whom conventional ther-
apy failed or unacceptable side effects occurred.16,17 
Remission was induced at week 8 in 20.9% of 
patients receiving the regimen of 6 mg of 
ustekinumab per kilogram in UNITI-1. Higher 
rates of absolute response and remission were 
observed in UNITI-2, presumably because dis-
ease was less refractory and of relatively shorter 
duration in patients in whom only conventional 
therapy had been unsuccessful.
The benefits of ustekinumab in inducing a 
response were observed as early as week 3. This 
prompt onset of clinical efficacy, paralleled by 
decreases in CRP levels, is desirable in such highly 
symptomatic patients. Improvements in (and 
greater normalization of) CRP and fecal calpro-
tectin levels after treatment with ustekinumab 
suggest that objective reduction of inflammation 
was occurring in tandem with clinical improve-
ments. Although statistical testing was not planned 
or performed, there appears to be a numerical 
difference favoring the dose of 6 mg per kilogram 
over the dose of 130 mg for most efficacy vari-
ables; the former was also associated with higher 
blood levels of ustekinumab.
In IM-UNITI, superiority over placebo was 
shown for both the primary outcome and the 
majority of the secondary end points. In both of 
the groups receiving maintenance doses of sub-
cutaneous ustekinumab, patients had significant-
ly lower CRP and fecal calprotectin levels at week 
44 than those who received placebo. Although 
both the regimen administered every 8 weeks 
and the regimen administered every 12 weeks 
were superior to placebo, the totality of the effi-
cacy and exposure–response data appear to favor 
administration every 8 weeks. The favorable data 
for this regimen were most apparent for a num-
ber of remission-based outcomes. Notably, a high 
percentage of the patients with a response to 
ustekinumab at induction were in clinical remis-
sion during maintenance with placebo, despite 
having received only a single intravenous induc-
tion dose of ustekinumab. This finding could 
indicate that ustekinumab has a long duration of 
action, a likelihood that may become better un-
derstood in future trials.
The induction trials presented here evaluated 
a single intravenous dose of either 130 mg or 6 mg 
per kilogram (i.e., up to a dose of 520 mg). 
There were no deaths, and rates of overall ad-
verse events, serious adverse events, and adverse 
events within 1 hour after infusion occurred at 
similar rates across groups. The rates of adverse 
events were similar for subcutaneous mainte-
nance therapy with ustekinumab and placebo, 
and there was no apparent relationship between 
dose and safety. The adverse events observed in 
these trials are consistent with 5 years of cumu-
lative data acquired for patients with psoriasis 
(who received subcutaneous doses of ≤90 mg)11,18 
and 2 years of safety data for patients with pso-
riatic arthritis.19 The rates of antidrug antibodies 
were low, as measured with the use of a drug-
tolerant assay.
In conclusion, intravenous ustekinumab in-
duces response and remission in patients with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease that 
is refractory to either TNF antagonists or con-
ventional therapy. Among patients who had a re-
sponse to intravenous induction, subcutaneous 
ustekinumab administered at a dose of 90 mg 
every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks was more effec-
tive than placebo for maintaining remission.

Guidance for conventional treatment failures 
Concomitant Medications- Failure of Conventional Therapy Guidance for UNITI-2 
eligibility (and for completion of electronic Case Report Forms [eCRF] in the UNITI-1 
study) 
As a requirement for entry into the UNITI-2 study, patients must meet the following 
requirements for prior or current medications for Crohn’s disease: 
Has failed conventional therapy: 
• 
Is currently receiving corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators (i.e., azathioprine 
[AZA], methotrexate [MTX], or 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) at adequate therapeutic 
doses; 
OR 
• 
Has a history of failure to respond to or tolerate an adequate course of corticosteroids 
and/or immunomodulators (i.e., AZA, MTX, or 6-MP); 
OR 
• 
Is corticosteroid dependent or has had a history of corticosteroid dependency; 
AND 
• 
Has not previously demonstrated inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or more 
TNF antagonist therapies (i.e., infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab pegol). 
Regarding these requirements for failure of conventional therapy, in order to provide 
investigators with guidance as to the standard for what represents failure of these 
conventional therapies, the below criteria have been developed and are suggested as a 
standard for these aspects of the patient’s medical history when assessing patient eligibility.  
 ONLINE SUPPLEMENT

In both the UNITI-1 and 2 studies, the Crohn's Disease Medication History eCRF, which has 
been designed to gather the relevant information regarding the patient’s treatment history in 
terms of the relevant corticosteroid and immunomodulator conventional therapies  
(specifically, oral corticosteroids, including budesonide, and the immunomodulators AZA, 
MTX, and 6-MP). To assist in the completion of this eCRF, guidance regarding suggested 
standards for adequate treatment, refractoriness, intolerance and dependence is provided 
below. 
Please note that while not a part of the study inclusion criteria for UNITI-1, this information, 
through the eCRF is also needed to define the medication history of patients participating in 
the UNITI-1 study. 
 
Guidance on Adequate Treatment, Refractoriness and Intolerance to Medical Therapies 
► 
Corticosteroids 
Guidance for defining current or prior adequate trial of oral corticosteroids (ie, to establish 
that a patient has failed or is refractory to corticosteroids):  
Question from the “Crohn's Disease Medication History” eCRF: 
Has the patient at any point failed to respond to a full and adequate course of corticosteroids 
for Crohn’s disease? 
A full and adequate course of corticosteroids for Crohn’s disease is suggested to be defined 
as a daily dose of at least 0.75 mg/kg or 40 mg prednisone (or corticosteroid equivalent, oral 
or intravenous) per day or 9 mg/day budesonide (for ileal or right sided colonic disease) for 
at least 2 weeks. 
 
Guidance for defining corticosteroid intolerance:   
Question from the “Crohn's Disease Medication History” eCRF: 
Did the patient otherwise become intolerant, or develop a medical contraindication to steroid 
therapy? 
Suggested definitions of intolerance/contraindication: 
1) 
Patient developed clinically significant adverse events unresponsive to dose reduction 
and in the judgment of the investigator preclude the use of these medications to treat 
Crohn’s disease (e.g., osteonecrosis or osteoporosis, psychosis, uncontrolled diabetes) 
-or- 
2) 
Patients who have or developed a medical condition precluding the use of 
corticosteroids as a treatment for their Crohn’s disease 
 ONLINE SUPPLEMENT 
47 
Guidance for defining corticosteroid dependence:  
Question from the (Crohn's Disease Medication History) eCRF: 
Have they been steroid-dependent at any point?   
Suggested definition:  The patient has been unable to reduce daily steroid dose below 10 
mg/day of prednisolone (or equivalent) or below 3 mg/day budesonide within 3 months of 
starting steroids for Crohn’s disease, without recurrent active disease, or by having relapse of 
Crohn’s disease within 3 months of stopping oral corticosteroids. 
 
► 
Immunomodulators: 
Patients currently or previously receiving 6-MP, AZA, and/or MTX 
Guidance for defining current or prior adequate trial of immunomodulators (i.e., to establish 
that a patient has failed or is refractory to immunomodulators): 
Question from the “Crohn's Disease Medication History” eCRF: 
Has the patient at any point failed to respond to a full and adequate course of 
immunomodulator therapy? 
Suggested standards for a full and adequate course of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX: 
At least 3 months of therapy with one of the following: 
• 
1 mg/kg/day 6-MP, 2 mg/kg/day AZA or 25mg intramuscular/subcutaneous per week 
MTX 
OR 
• 
Dose of 6-MP or AZA confirmed to be therapeutic for the patient with whole blood 
thioguanine nucleotide levels > 200 pmole/8x108 red blood cells  
OR 
• 
The highest tolerated dose due to leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, or nausea 
Guidance for defining current or prior intolerance to immunomodulators:

Corticosteroid taper schedule 
Recommended tapering schedule for oral corticosteroids (other than budesonide) 
• 
Dose > 15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose by 5 mg/week 
until receiving 10 mg/day, then continue tapering at 2.5 mg/week until 0 
mg/day.   
• 
Dose 11 to 15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose to 10 mg/day 
for 1 week, then continue at 2.5 mg/week until 0 mg/day.   
• 
Dose ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose by 2.5 mg/week

Statistical Analyses 
The overall Type 1 error rate within each study was controlled at α=0.05 over the primary 
and major secondary endpoints with the use of hierarchical testing. The first major secondary 
and subsequent endpoint(s) were tested only if the preceding endpoint in the hierarchy was 
positive. Within each major secondary endpoint, fixed-sequence testing was applied. 
 
In both induction studies the primary endpoint was clinical response defined as a ≥100-point 
decrease from baseline in CDAI score (or score <150) at week 6. Major secondary induction 
endpoints (listed in hierarchical order of testing) were clinical remission (CDAI score <150 
points) at week 8, clinical response at week 8, and ≥70-point CDAI decreases at week 6 and 
at week 3. A fixed-sequence-testing procedure was used where the 6-mg/kg ustekinumab 
group was first compared with placebo. Each study was considered positive if this 
comparison was significantly different from placebo, and only in that case would the primary 
endpoint be evaluated for the 130 mg dose. The first major secondary and subsequent 
endpoint(s) were tested only if the preceding endpoint in the hierarchy was positive. Within 
each major secondary endpoint, fixed-sequence testing was applied; first 6-mg/kg then 
130-mg ustekinumab (which could only be tested if positive for the preceding endpoints). 
 
For the maintenance study the primary endpoint was clinical remission (CDAI score of <150 
points) at week 44. Major secondary maintenance endpoints at week 44 (listed in hierarchical 
order of testing) were clinical response (100-point reduction in CDAI score from induction 
week 0 or clinical remission), clinical remission among patients in clinical remission at 
week 0 of the maintenance study, corticosteroid-free clinical remission, and clinical 
remission in patients refractory or intolerant to a TNF-antagonist (UNITI-1 population). 
 ONLINE SUPPLEMENT 
51 
Within each major secondary endpoint, fixed-sequence testing was applied; ustekinumab 
90 mg q8w group was first compared with placebo, allowing comparison of q12w with 
placebo only if the study was positive. A similar approach was used to evaluate the 
secondary endpoints, requiring a positive comparison for the higher dose and prior 
hierarchical endpoints in order to claim statistical significance. 
 
Study Interruption 
 
Both induction studies were interrupted in November 2011 due to an IV formulation drug 
stability issue after 28 (UNITI-1) and 12 (UNITI-2) patients were enrolled. Because 
knowledge of this issue might bias assessments, data from these patients were not included in 
the analyses in UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 and enrollment was increased to 703 and 612 patients, 
respectively.  The analysis populations in these studies were based on the 741 and 628 
patients, respectively, who were randomized after the study restart. In IM-UNITI, of the 397 
randomized patients, 9 patients, who were randomized prior to the study restart, were 
excluded from the efficacy analysis population.  Thus, 388 patients were included in the 
efficacy analysis population for IM-UNITI.

Ustekinumab efficacy in non-randomized patients 
 
 
Patients not in clinical response at week 8 of UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 following intravenous 
(IV) induction with placebo or ustekinumab were eligible to enroll in the non-randomized 
portion of IM-UNITI and if in clinical response 8 weeks later were continued on 
ustekinumab (Figure, Patient populations in IM-UNITI). Among patients not in clinical 
response after IV placebo induction who were treated with a single ustekinumab 130 mg IV 
dose at week 0 of maintenance, 80/279 (28.7%) were in clinical remission and 53.0% were in 
clinical response at week 8. Among those who continued onto ustekinumab 90mg q12w, 
79/159 (49.7%) were in clinical remission and 106 (66.7%) were in clinical response at 
week 44.  Placebo induction nonresponders who received an IV infusion of ustekinumab 130 
mg appeared to do as well as those originally randomized to ustekinumab 130 mg who then 
continued to receive ustekinumab 90mg q12w. 
Among patients not in clinical response after IV ustekinumab induction, 135/467 (28.9%) 
were in clinical remission and 50.5% were in clinical response at week 8 (after an additional 
90mg ustekinumab subcutaneous [SC] dose at week 0), and of 251 patients continuing onto 
ustekinumab 90mg q8w, 126 (50.2%) were in clinical remission and 171 (68.1%) were in 
clinical response at week 44 (Table). This experience indicates that there are a substantial 
number of patients who may be delayed clinical responders and highlights the benefit of 
continued treatment with at least one additional SC ustekinumab administration 8 weeks after 
initiation of induction.

Efficacy in patients who increased their study dose in the randomized population 
Randomized patients in IM-UNITI who met loss of response criteria, defined as a CDAI 
score of ≥ 220 and a ≥ 100 point increase from the maintenance baseline CDAI score, 
between weeks 8 and 32 could undergo a single dose adjustment as follows: 
placebo→ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w, ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w→ustekinumab 90 mg 
SC q8w, and ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w→ ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w (no dose 
adjustment).  
Patients who lost clinical response received a dose adjustment and were assessed 16 weeks 
after the visit where the loss of response criteria were met to determine if benefit was 
achieved from dose adjustment (e.g., clinical response [≥ 100 point decrease in CDAI] and 
clinical remission [CDAI < 150]). Among 29 patients randomized to the ustekinumab 90 mg 
q12w group who dose adjusted to ustekinumab 90mg q8w, 41.4% were in clinical remission 
and 55.2% were in clinical response (median CDAI score decrease of 141.0) 16 weeks after 
dose adjustment. Among 28 patients randomized to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group who lost 
clinical response and continued to receive ustekinumab 90 mg q8w, 32.1% were in clinical 
remission and 46.4% were in clinical response 16 weeks later, with a median decrease in 
CDAI score of 78.5. Among 51 patients randomized to placebo who dose adjusted to 
ustekinumab 90mg q8w, 39.2% were in clinical remission and 70.6% were in clinical 
response (median CDAI score decrease of 121.0) 16 weeks later. In patients who received 
UST 90 mg q12w and subsequently met loss of response criteria, dose adjustment to q8w 
dosing provided some additional clinical benefit compared to patients who did not dose 
adjust remaining on UST 90 mg q8w.
