Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in 
early November 2017 and rose sharply from December through 
February 3, 2018; elevated influenza activity is expected to 
continue for several more weeks. Influenza A viruses have 
been most commonly identified, with influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses predominating, but influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 
influenza B viruses were also reported. This report summarizes 
U.S. influenza activity* during October 1, 2017–February 3, 
2018,† and updates the previous summary (1).
Viral Surveillance
U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System laborato-
ries, which include both public health and clinical laboratories 
throughout the 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
Columbia, contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza. 
During October 1, 2017–February 3, 2018, clinical labora-
tories tested 666,493 specimens for influenza virus, 124,316 
(18.7%) of which tested positive (Figure 1). During this period, 
the percentage of specimens testing positive for any influenza 
virus increased to 26.4% during the week ending January 13 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric mortality reports); 
4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging Infections 
Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary of the 
geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial epidemiologist reports).

and remained at approximately that level (26.3%–26.7%) 
through the week ending February 3, 2018. The percentage 
of specimens testing positive for influenza A viruses peaked 
at 21.8% during the week ending January 13; however, the 
percentage testing positive for influenza B viruses continued 
to increase through the week ending February 3, during which 
8.1% of specimens tested were positive for influenza B. On a 
regional level, the percentage of specimens testing positive for 
any influenza virus has decreased for 2 or more consecutive 
weeks in U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

or remain level in the remaining regions (Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, and 8) through the week ending February 3.
Public health laboratories tested 51,014 specimens collected 
during October 1, 2017–February 3, 2018. Among these, 
27,669 tested positive for influenza virus, including 23,257 
(84.1%) for influenza A and 4,412 (15.9%) for influenza B 
viruses (Figure 2). Among the 22,810 seasonal influenza A 
viruses subtyped, 20,512 (89.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 2,298 (10.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses; influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for 74.1% of 
all influenza viruses reported.  Influenza B virus lineage infor-
mation was available for 3,319 (75.2%) influenza B viruses; 
3,010 (90.7%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 309 
(9.3%) to the B/Victoria lineage. Whereas influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses accounted for the majority of circulating viruses in all 
HHS regions, the proportion of subtyped influenza A viruses

that were identified as A(H1N1)pdm09 regionally ranged 
from 5% (Region 7) to 21% (Region 6), and the proportion 
of circulating viruses reported to be influenza B ranged from 
9% (Region 5) to 28% (Region 10).
Data on age were available for 23,578 influenza-positive 
patients whose specimens were tested by public health laborato-
ries. Overall, 1,863 (7.9%) were aged 0–4 years, 5,208 (22.1%) 
were aged 5–24 years, 7,576 (32.1%) were aged 25–64 years, 
and 8,931 (37.9%) were aged ≥65 years. Influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses were predominant among all age groups, account-
ing for 68%–72% of viruses identified among persons aged 
0–4 years, 5–24 years, and 25–64 years and 84% of viruses 
reported among persons aged ≥65 years. The largest proportion 
of reported influenza B virus infections occurred in persons 
aged 5–24 years; influenza B viruses accounted for 21.9% of 
the viruses reported in this age group.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
Six human infections with novel influenza A viruses were 
reported to CDC during October 1, 2017–February 3, 2018. 
All of these were variant¶ virus infections (human infections 
with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine). Five of 
these infections were previously described (1). The sixth human 
¶ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

infection with a novel influenza A virus was caused by an influ-
enza A(H3N2) variant (A[H3N2]v) virus in Iowa in an adult 
patient with onset of respiratory symptoms in November 2017. 
This patient reported exposure to swine during the week preced-
ing illness onset, was not hospitalized, and has fully recovered. 
No sustained human-to-human transmission was identified.
The A(H3N2)v virus detected in Iowa had a hemagglutinin 
(HA) gene segment derived from a seasonal human H3N2 
virus that was likely introduced into swine by reverse zoonosis 
(i.e., human infection of swine) in 2010. This virus was closely 
related to H3N2 viruses known to circulate in the U.S. swine 
population (2), as well as to variant virus infections detected 
in Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
Ohio, and Pennsylvania during May–December 2017 (1,2).

Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
In the United States, public health laboratories participating 
in influenza surveillance as WHO collaborating laboratories 
are asked to submit a subset of influenza-positive respiratory 
specimens to CDC for virus characterization according to spe-
cific guidelines.** CDC characterizes influenza viruses through 
one or more laboratory tests, including genomic sequencing,

This process is used to assess whether antigenic drift from the 
vaccine reference viruses has occurred.
All influenza-positive specimens submitted for surveil-
lance and received by CDC are sequenced by next genera-
tion sequencing (NGS), using previously described genomic 
enrichment practices (3,4) adapted by CDC. NGS uses 
advanced molecular detection to identify gene sequences from 
each virus in a sample and thus reveals the genetic variations 
among many different influenza virus particles in a single 
sample; these methods also reveal the entire coding region of 
the genomes. The genomic data are analyzed to determine the 
genetic identity of circulating viruses and submitted to public 
databases (GenBank or GISAID EpiFlu). Data obtained from 
antigenic characterization are important in the assessment of 
the similarity between reference vaccine viruses and circulat-
ing viruses. In vitro antigenic characterization data generated 
through HI assays or virus neutralization assays are used to 
assess whether genetic changes in circulating viruses affect anti-
genicity, which might subsequently affect vaccine effectiveness.
Since the 2014–15 season, many influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses propagated in tissue culture have lacked sufficient 
hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization using 
HI assays. Therefore, a subset of influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
are selected for antigenic characterization using the virus 
neutralization focus reduction assay to assess the ability of 
various antisera to neutralize infectivity of the test viruses. 
CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 1,365 
influenza viruses collected and submitted by laboratories 
in the United States since October 1, 2017, including 276 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 695 influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 394 influenza B viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segments from 276 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected since October 1, 2017, 
showed that all belonged to subclade 6B.1 (Figure 3). Of the 
205 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses analyzed using HI assays with 
ferret antisera, 100% were antigenically similar to the cell 
culture–propagated 6B.1 virus A/Michigan/45/2015, the refer-
ence virus representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine virus for 
the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.
A total of 695 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were sequenced, 
and phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segments illustrated 
that multiple clades/subclades were cocirculating (Figure 3). 
Circulating viruses possessed HA gene segments that belonged 
to clade 3C.2a, subclade 3C.2a1, or clade 3C.3a with 3C.2a 
predominating (Figure 3). Among the 262 representative 
A(H3N2) viruses that were antigenically characterized, 257 
(98.1%) were well-inhibited (reacting at titers that were within 
fourfold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera 
raised against A/Michigan/15/2014 (3C.2a), a cell-propagated 
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014–like reference virus representing the 
A(H3N2) component of the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere 
influenza vaccines. Although considerable genetic diversity 
(i.e., multiple cocirculating genetic subgroups) has been 
observed among the HA gene segments of H3N2 viruses, 
there have been very few (1.9%) H3N2 viruses showing anti-
genic drift in the HA this season. In contrast to the 98.1% 
of viruses that were well-inhibited by ferret antisera raised 
against cell-propagated A/Michigan/15/2014, only 64.4% of 
viruses tested were well-inhibited by ferret antiserum raised 
against the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 refer-
ence virus representing the A(H3N2) vaccine component. 
This is likely because of egg-adaptive amino acid changes in 
the HA of the egg-propagated virus. The majority of influ-
enza vaccines used in the United States are produced with 
egg-based manufacturing.
Among influenza B viruses, phylogenetic analysis of 338 
influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses showed that all the 
HA gene segments belonged to clade Y3 (Figure 3). A total of 
202 B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigenically character-
ized, and all were antigenically similar to cell culture–propa-
gated B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference virus representing 
the B/Yamagata-lineage component of quadrivalent vaccines 
for the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.
Among the 56 influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses sequenced 
and phylogenetically analyzed, the HA gene segment of all 
viruses belonged to genetic clade V1A, the same genetic clade as 
the vaccine reference virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, the 
HA gene segment of 28 viruses (50.0%) had a six-nucleotide 
deletion (encoding amino acids 162 and 163), and viruses like 
these, abbreviated as V1A-2Del, were previously reported (5). 
Of the 29 influenza B/Victoria viruses that were antigenically 
characterized, 17 (58.6%) were antigenically similar to cell 
culture–propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008, the reference virus 
representing the B/Victoria lineage component of 2017–18 
Northern Hemisphere vaccines. All 12 B/Victoria viruses that 
were poorly inhibited (reacting at titers that were eightfold or 
more reduced compared with the homologous virus titer) by 
antisera raised to cell culture–propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 
were V1A-2Del viruses.
Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 1,666 
influenza virus specimens collected since October 1, 2017, 
from the United States for resistance to the influenza neur-
aminidase inhibitor antiviral medications currently approved 
for use against seasonal influenza: oseltamivir, peramivir, and 
zanamivir. Among 376 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
tested for oseltamivir and peramivir susceptibility, four 
(1.1%) were resistant to both drugs and contain H275Y, the

265 of those influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses also were 
tested for zanamivir susceptibility, and all were susceptible. All 
903 influenza A(H3N2) viruses tested for oseltamivir and zana-
mivir susceptibility were susceptible to both of these medica-
tions. A total of 638 of those A(H3N2) viruses also were tested 
for peramivir susceptibility, and all were susceptible. All 387 
influenza B viruses tested for oseltamivir, peramivir, and zana-
mivir susceptibility were sensitive to all three recommended 
antiviral medications. High levels of resistance to the adaman-
tanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses. Adamantane drugs 
are not recommended for use against influenza at this time.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
During October 1, 2017–February 3, 2018, the weekly 
percentage of outpatient visits to heath care providers 
participating in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness 
Surveillance Network (ILINet) for influenza-like illness§§ 
(ILI) ranged from 1.3% to 7.7% (Figure 4). The percentage 
first exceeded the national baseline¶¶ level of 2.2% during the 
week ending November 25, 2017 (week 47) and has remained 
at or above the baseline for 11 consecutive weeks so far this 
season. From the week ending December 23, 2017, (week 51), 
through the week ending February 3, 2018, (week 5), all 10 
HHS regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI 
 
§§ Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C], oral or equivalent) and 
cough or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
¶¶ The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for ILI 
during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three seasons plus two standard 
deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks 
in which each week accounted for <2% of the season’s total number of specimens 
that tested positive for influenza in public health laboratories. National and 
regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted based on state 
population. Use of the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.

clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical

Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
Influenza activity levels reported by state and territorial 
epidemiologists indicate the geographic spread of influenza 
activity††† within their jurisdiction (50 states, District of 
Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands). 
During the 2017–18 season, the peak number of jurisdictions 
reporting widespread activity in a single week was 50 (93%); this 
occurred for the 3 consecutive weeks (weeks ending January 6, 
January 13, and January 20, 2018). During the previous five 
influenza seasons, the peak number of jurisdictions reporting 
widespread activity in a single week during each season has 
ranged from 41 (76%) in the 2015–16 season to 48 (89%) 
during the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-
confirmed influenza infections in adults and children through 
the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-
NET),§§§ which covers approximately 27 million persons (9% 
of the U.S. population). During October 1, 2017–February 3, 
2018, 17,101 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospi-
talizations were reported, representing a cumulative incidence 
 ††† Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with 
no increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI or two or more institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, 
with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no 
greater than sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or 
more outbreaks but less than half of the regions in the state with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in those regions; and 5) widespread: 
increased ILI activity or institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed 
influenza) in at least half the regions in the state, with recent laboratory 
evidence of influenza in the state.
 §§§ FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed, influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents 
aged <18 years (since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years 
(since the 2005–06 influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers 
approximately 70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states 
(California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New 
Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 
2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 
IHSP sites included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota 
during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and Utah during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during 
the 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18 seasons. 
Cumulative unadjusted incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National 
Center for Health Statistics population estimates for the counties included 
in the surveillance catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent 
on clinician-ordered influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is 
underused because of the poor reliability of rapid test results and greater 
reliance on clinical diagnosis for influenza. Therefore, cases identified as part 
of influenza hospitalization surveillance likely are an underestimation of the 
actual number of persons hospitalized with influenza.
among all age groups of 59.9 per 100,000 population. The 
hospitalization rate was highest among persons aged ≥65 years, 
who accounted for 59% of reported influenza-associated 
hospitalizations.
The cumulative influenza hospitalization rates per 100,000 
population during October 1, 2017–February 3, 2018, for 
persons aged 0–4 years, 5–17 years, 18–49 years, 50–64 years, 
and ≥65 years were 40.0, 10.3, 18.3, 63.1, and 263.6, respec-
tively. Among all hospitalizations, 14,770 (86.4%) were asso-
ciated with influenza A virus infection, 2,251 (13.2%) with 
influenza B virus infection, 43 (0.3%) with influenza A virus 
and influenza B virus coinfection, and 37 (0.2%) with influ-
enza virus infection for which the type was not determined. 
Among the 3,841 patients for whom influenza A subtype 
information was available, 3,308 (86.1%) were infected with 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses and 533 (13.9%) with influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Among hospitalized persons aged 
0–64 years for whom influenza A subtype information was 
available, 23.6% were infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses, compared with only 7.0% of those aged ≥65 years.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season.
What is added by this report?
Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in 
early November 2017 and rose sharply from December 
through February 3, 2018. Influenza A viruses have been most 
commonly identified, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predomi-
nating, but influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses 
were also detected. Influenza illness this season has been 
substantial, with some of the highest levels of influenza-like 
illness and hospitalization rates in recent years, and elevated 
activity occurring in most of the country simultaneously. 
Elevated influenza activity is expected to continue for several 
more weeks.
What are the implications for public health practice?
With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity 
expected, the increasing proportion of influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 and influenza B viruses, and the potential to prevent 
significant illness through influenza vaccination, CDC continues 
to recommend influenza vaccination at this time. In influenza 
seasons with increased severity, influenza antiviral medications 
are an increasingly important adjunct to vaccination in the 
treatment of influenza. Early treatment with neuraminidase 
inhibitor antiviral medications is recommended for patients 
with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and 
those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults 
aged ≥65 years who develop influenza symptoms.
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
MMWR / February 16, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 6 
177
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Information on underlying medical conditions was avail-
able for 2,147 (12.6%) hospitalized patients with laboratory-
confirmed influenza as of February 3, 2018. Among 1,955 
hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical 
condition available, 1,325 (67.8%) had at least one underlying 
medical condition that placed them at high risk for influenza-
associated complications. The most commonly reported medi-
cal conditions were cardiovascular disease (35.5%), metabolic 
disorders (33.0%), obesity (25.2%), and chronic lung disease 
(23.6%). Among 192 hospitalized children with information 
on underlying medical conditions available, 97 (50.5%) had at 
least one underlying medical condition, the most commonly 
reported being asthma (22.8%), neurologic disorders (14.4%), 
and obesity (10.1%). Among 151 hospitalized women aged 
15–44 years with information on pregnancy status, 36 (23.8%) 
were pregnant.
Pneumonia and Influenza–Associated Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed 
deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of 
deaths attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week 
of death to allow for collection of sufficient data to produce 
a stable P&I mortality percentage. From October 1, 2017, to 
January 20, 2018, the weekly percentage of deaths attributed 
to P&I has ranged from 5.8% to 10.1% and has exceeded the 
epidemic threshold¶¶¶ for 5 consecutive weeks. P&I percent-
ages for recent weeks are likely to be artificially low because 
of a delay in manual coding for deaths occurring in 2018, 
and the percentage of deaths caused by P&I is higher among 
manually coded death certificates than among machine-coded 
death certificates. The percentage of deaths caused by P&I will 
likely increase as more data become available.
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
As of February 3, 2018, (week 5), 63 laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 
2017–18 season were reported to CDC. Fifteen deaths were 
associated with an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, 
16 were associated with an influenza A(H3N2) virus infection, 
14 were associated with infection with an influenza A virus for 
which no subtyping was performed, and 18 were associated 
with an influenza B virus infection. Since influenza-associated 
pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable condition in 
 ¶¶¶ The seasonal baseline proportion of P&I deaths is projected using a robust 
regression procedure, in which a periodic regression model is applied to the 
observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were reported by the National 
Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System during the 
preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 standard deviations 
above the seasonal baseline.
2004, the number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths per 
season has ranged from 37 to 171, excluding the 2009 pan-
demic, when there were 358 pediatric deaths during April 15, 
2009–October 2, 2010. The mean age of the reported pediatric 
deaths reported this season was 7.4 years (range 2 months to 
17 years); 40 (63%) of the children died after admission to 
the hospital. Among the 56 children with a known medical 
history, 30 (54%) had at least one underlying medical condi-
tion recognized by ACIP as placing them at increased risk for 
influenza-related complications. Among the 54 children who 
were eligible for influenza vaccination (≥6 months of age at 
date of onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 
14 (26%) had received at least 1 dose of influenza vaccine 
before onset of illness (13 were fully vaccinated according to 
2017 ACIP recommendations, and one had received 1 of 2 
recommended doses).
Discussion
Influenza illness this season has been substantial, with 
some of the highest levels of ILI and hospitalization rates in 
recent years and elevated activity occurring in most of the 
country simultaneously. Influenza A(H3N2) is the predomi-
nant influenza virus circulating this season. Past A(H3N2) 
virus–predominant seasons such as the 2012–13 and 2014–15 
seasons had increased numbers of influenza related infections, 
hospitalizations, and deaths compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 
virus-predominant seasons, and the 2017–18 season is on track 
to reach or exceed estimates from those seasons.
The percentage of outpatient visits to doctors’ offices, urgent 
care centers, and emergency departments that were for ILI 
rose sharply in late 2017 to 7.7% in early February. This is 
the highest level of ILI activity since the pandemic in 2009 
which peaked at 7.7%. During the previous five influenza 
seasons, the peak weekly percentages of outpatient visits for 
ILI ranged from 3.6% to 6.1% and remained above baseline 
levels for an average of 16 weeks (range = 11–20 weeks). The 
weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI this season has 
been above the national baseline for 11 weeks, suggesting that 
influenza activity is likely to continue for several more weeks.
The cumulative hospitalization rate attributed to laboratory-
confirmed influenza for the week ending February 3, 2018, 
(59.9/100,000) exceeded the rate for the same week in 2014–15 
(50.9/100,000), an A(H3N2) virus–predominant season 
categorized as high severity, and is the highest rate observed for 
this week since the system expanded to include adults during 
the 2005–06 season. Persons aged ≥65 years account for the 
majority of cases (59%); however, hospitalization rates for all 
adult age groups (18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥65 years) are 
higher than those observed during the same week in 2014–15. 
These hospitalization rates are not adjusted for testing practices,

which can vary from season to season; therefore, caution should 
be used when comparing hospitalization rates across seasons.
P&I-related deaths also rose sharply in the first weeks of 
2018, accounting for 10.1% of all deaths recorded on death 
certificates during the week ending January 20, 2018. It is 
anticipated that the number of P&I-related deaths will con-
tinue to increase for several more weeks and might exceed the 
peaks in past recent A(H3N2) virus–predominant seasons 
(11.1% in 2012–13 and 10.8% in 2014–15). Through the 
week ending January 20, P&I-related mortality has been above 
the epidemic threshold for 5 consecutive weeks. During the 
past five seasons, the average number of weeks this indicator 
was above threshold was 11 (range of 7–15 weeks).
Sixty-three laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pedi-
atric deaths have been reported to CDC as of February 3, 2018; 
46% of these children were otherwise healthy. Among those 
children who were eligible for vaccination and for whom vac-
cination status was known, only 14 (26%) had received any 
influenza vaccine this season before the onset of illness (13 were 
fully vaccinated, and one had received 1 of 2 recommended 
doses). In a previous analysis of pediatric deaths with a similar 
percentage of eligible children vaccinated (26%), influenza 
vaccination was associated with a 65% reduction in risk for 
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric death (6).
With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity antici-
pated this season, it is too early to assess overall severity of the 
season. However, estimates of the burden of influenza disease 
from the 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons provide an indication 
of what might be anticipated for the 2017–18 season. CDC 
estimated that during each of those seasons influenza accounted 
for as many as 35.6 million illnesses, 16.6 million medically 
attended visits, 710,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths.****
Interim estimates of 2017–18 season vaccine effective-
ness (VE) against influenza A and influenza B virus infec-
tion associated with medically attended acute respiratory 
illness in the United States was 36% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 27%–44%). VE was estimated to be 25% 
(95% CI = 13%–36%) against illness caused by influenza 
A(H3N2) virus, 67% (95% CI = 54%–76%) against A(H1N1)
pdm09 virus and 42% (95% CI = 25%–56%) against influ-
enza B virus (7).  During the 2014–15 season, an A(H3N2) 
virus–predominant season with high severity and low vaccine 
effectiveness, influenza vaccine was estimated to have prevented 
millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of influenza-related 
hospitalizations. With several more weeks of elevated influ-
enza activity expected, an increasing proportion of influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses, and the potential to

disease/burden.htm.
prevent significant illness through influenza vaccination, CDC 
continues to recommend influenza vaccination at this time.
During influenza seasons with increased severity, influenza 
antiviral medications are an increasingly important adjunct to 
vaccination in the treatment of influenza. Three neuraminidase 
inhibitor antiviral medications are approved and recommended 
for use in the United States during the 2017–18 influenza sea-
son: oral oseltamivir (available as a generic or under the trade 
name Tamiflu [Genentech, South San Francisco, California]), 
inhaled zanamivir (Relenza [GlaxoSmithKline, London, 
England]) and intravenous peramivir (Rapivab [Seqirus, 
Summit, New Jersey]). Resistance to these medications is not 
a concern at this time because only four influenza viruses (all 
A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses) collected in the United States since 
October 1, 2017, were identified as not being sensitive to 
oseltamivir and peramivir.
Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to 
reduce illness duration and severe outcomes of influenza based 
on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses 
of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies 
(8,9). Treatment with influenza antiviral medications initi-
ated as close to the onset of illness as possible is recommended 
for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have 
severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hos-
pitalization; or who are not hospitalized but who are at high 
risk for developing serious influenza complications. Treatment 
should not be delayed while waiting for results of testing or 
even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic test results 
are negative. Clinical benefit of antiviral treatment is greatest 
when treatment begins within 48 hours after symptom onset; 
however, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after 
illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients (8,10). A 
CDC health advisory released on December 27, 2017, regard-
ing treatment with antiviral medications is available at https://
emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00409.asp.
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional 
information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, 
influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel 
influenza A infections in humans is available online (https://
www.cdc.gov/flu).
