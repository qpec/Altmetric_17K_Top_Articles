Objective. To assess the efficacy and safety of com-
bination therapy with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glu-
cosamine sulfate (GS) compared to placebo in patients
with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).
Methods. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study was performed in 164 patients
with Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or grade 3 radiographic
knee OA and moderate-to-severe knee pain (mean6 SD
global pain score 62.16 11.3 mm on a 100-mm visual ana-
log scale [VAS]). Patients were randomized to receive either
combined treatment with CS (1,200 mg) plus GS (1,500 mg)
or placebo in a single oral daily dose for 6 months. The
mean change from baseline in the VAS global pain score
was set as the primary end point. Secondary outcomes
included the mean change in the investigator’s global
assessment of disease activity, total Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC),
pain and function subscale scores on the WOMAC,
responder rates based on the Outcome Measures in Rheu-
matology (OMERACT)–Osteoarthritis Research Society
International (OARSI) 2004 response criteria, and rescue
medication use. Adverse events were also recorded. A Data
and Safety Monitoring Board was instituted to ensure
patient safety and data accuracy.
Results. Intriguingly, in the modified intent-to-treat
(mITT) population, CS/GS combination therapy was infe-
rior to placebo in the reduction of joint pain (mean6 SD
change in VAS global pain score over 6 months 211.86
2.4 mm [19% reduction] in patients receiving CS plus GS
versus 220.56 2.4 mm [33% reduction] in patients receiv-
ing placebo; peak between-group difference in global pain
score at 6 months 8.7 mm [14.2%], P< 0.03), but no
between-group differences were seen in the per-protocol
completers. Both placebo treatment and CS/GS combina-
tion treatment improved to a similar extent the total
WOMAC score as well as the pain and function WOMAC
subscale scores, both in the mITT population and in the
per-protocol completers. Neither the OMERACT–OARSI
responder rate nor the frequency of rescue medication use
differed between the treatment groups. Severe adverse
events were uncommon and equally distributed.
Conclusion. The results of this trial demonstrate a
lack of superiority of CS/GS combination therapy over
placebo in terms of reducing joint pain and functional
impairment in patients with symptomatic knee OA over 6
months. Further research might fully elucidate the suit-
ability of CS/GS combination therapy in patients with OA.

 that results in disabling symptoms in ;10% of individuals
older than age 55 years (1). Guidelines for the treatment of
knee OA include weight loss, muscle strengthening, and
analgesic/antiinflammatory drugs. Nonsteroidal antiinflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, and opioids are the
most frequently prescribed medications in daily clinical prac-
tice, although long-term consumption of these drugs is asso-
ciated with a high incidence of side effects (2–5). Indeed,
NSAID use may increase the risk of gastrointestinal adverse
events, heart attacks, and acute renal failure. In addition,
comorbidities may hinder NSAID use in some patients, lead-
ing to treatment with opioids instead. In turn, opioids are
thought to increase the risk of fracture and the likelihood of
poor self-reported health outcomes. Joint replacement sur-
gery remains the best therapeutic option in severe cases.
In spite of the great controversy surrounding the
use of symptomatic slow-acting drugs in OA (SySADOAs),
such as chondroitin sulfate (CS), glucosamine sulfate (GS),
glucosamine hydrochloride (GH), and combination treat-
ment with CS plus GS, these are commonly used to control
symptoms of OA in Western countries. Discrepancies arise
from the contradictory results that have been observed in
diverse clinical trials; some points of contention include dif-
ferences in chemical formulations, uneven quality of the
products tested, inadequate allocation concealment, and
other possible sponsor-dependent bias (6–10).
CS/GS combination therapy failed to reduce joint
pain in the global population of patients with knee OA
from the Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention
Trial (GAIT). However, in a subset analysis that had not
been preplanned, significant relief of joint pain was
observed with this combination therapy in the subgroup of
patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain (8). The same
combination therapy was shown in the head-to-head
Multicentre Osteoarthritis interVEntion trial with
SySADOA (MOVES) study to possess efficacy compara-
ble to that of celecoxib for severe OA at 6 months of treat-
ment (7). Nevertheless, the MOVES study was regarded
with criticism because it could possibly bear a large Type II
error (11,12). Furthermore, clinical research in OA is often
hindered by a considerably high placebo effect, in particu-
lar when questionnaire-based outcomes are used (13).
Therefore, the inclusion of a placebo control group appears
mandatory in clinical trials involving SySADOAs (14,15).
The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of
CS/GS combination therapy compared to placebo after 6
months of treatment in patients with painful knee OA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design. The study was a phase III multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
clinical trial. It was carried out in 9 rheumatology referral cen-
ters and 1 orthopaedic surgery referral center in Spain.
The study was designed in 2 steps. In the first step, we
required that 50% of the patient sample (n 5 158) would com-
plete a study period of 6 months. Once this step had been com-
pleted, an interim analysis would be performed and the results
evaluated by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). On
the basis of the results obtained, it would be decided whether to
proceed or not to proceed with the second step. In the second
step, 50% of the patient sample would be recruited to complete 6
months of follow-up. Statistical analyses would be conducted on
the data obtained from the total sample recruited in steps 1 and 2
(n5 316).
Screening was followed by a baseline period in which blood
was withdrawn for routine laboratory tests. In addition, radio-
graphic studies were updated, if not available from the 3 previous
months, and medications being taken for symptoms were discontin-
ued. Throughout the screening and study periods, only acetamino-
phen was allowed as a rescue medication (maximum dosage 3 gm/
day), except for the 48 hours prior to clinical evaluation.
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treat-
ment arms, i.e., CS plus GS or placebo. Clinic visits were
scheduled at 4, 12, and 24 weeks following the baseline visit.
This study was conducted for a registration dossier and was
approved by the institutional review board of each participat-
ing center and by the Spanish Medicines Agency (SMA). All
procedures complied with the principles of the Guidelines for
Good Clinical Practice and with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients.
The study population consisted of patients
with primary symptomatic knee OA, diagnosed according to the
American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee OA (16),
who were classified as having radiographic grade 2 or grade 3
knee OA according to the Kellgren/Lawrence scale (17). All re-
cruited patients were required to have moderate-to-severe knee
pain as defined by a self-reported global pain score of 40–80 mm
on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) during the preinclusion
week. Exclusion criteria included obesity (body mass index
$35 kg/m2), concurrent arthritic conditions, or any coexisting dis-
ease that could preclude successful completion of the study. In
those cases of bilateral knee involvement, only the most painful
knee at baseline was considered.
Treatment and randomization. Patients were random-
ized to receive, in a single oral daily dose, a sachet of a formula-
tion containing 1,200 mg CS (from bovine tracheal cartilage)
plus 1,500 mg crystalline GS (of crustacean origin), both of which
were of pharmaceutical quality (Tedec Meiji Farma), or a conve-
niently masked placebo. The details of the quality of the raw
materials and the manufacturing process of the combination
therapy were submitted and approved in advance by the SMA.
The randomization process was performed using the
block randomization method, and subjects were consecutively
assigned to each therapeutic group in a 1:1 ratio. The randomi-
zation was independent and computer-assisted, carried out by
individuals who had no contact with the investigators who had
either assigned patients to their randomized treatments or per-
formed any patient assessment or conducted the statistical anal-
ysis. The block size was also kept secret to maintain blinding.
Patients were sequentially assigned to a randomization number
at each site, and the individual codes were kept in single, sealed,
opaque envelopes to be opened only at the end of the study or
in instances of safety concerns or a medical emergency.

 The treatment was not identified in the case report
form and remained unknown until the database was closed
and the results of the final analysis were reported. A patient
was considered to comply with the treatment schedule when
having a treatment compliance rate of $80% at each visit.
Evaluation of efficacy and safety.
The primary effi-
cacy end point was the mean reduction from baseline to end of
study in the global pain score on a 0–100-mm VAS. To ascertain
this score, at every visit, the patient was asked, “How much pain
did you experience in your knee during the previous week?” The
secondary efficacy outcomes comprised the mean reduction in
the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoar-
thritis Index (WOMAC) (18), as well as the pain and function
subscale scores on the WOMAC (each on 0–100-mm VAS), the
investigator’s global assessment of disease activity (on 0–100-mm
VAS), the percentage of treatment responders according to the
Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)–Osteoar-
thritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 response
criteria (19), and the use of rescue medication (acetaminophen;
quantified in gm/day) throughout the study.
The evaluation of treatment safety and tolerability was
based on the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs). In
addition, the rate of discontinuation of study treatment due to
AEs was ascertained.
Establishment of the DSMB. A DSMB was instituted
to ensure the ongoing safety of participants and the accurate,
bias-free gathering of data (20,21). The DSMB was formed by a
committee comprising an experienced biostatistician who pre-
pared and presented the interim analysis prior to the first analy-
sis, an investigator with expertise in current performance of
clinical trials and clinical methodology (GH-B), and a basic
researcher (RL). This committee was blinded with regard to
treatment assignment and not involved in the trial procedures,
and had no financial interests or conflicts of interest with the
sponsor or other trial organizers.
Since this is a placebo-controlled study, it was established
beforehand in the protocol to perform an interim analysis when
50% of the estimated sample size had reached the time of the 6-
month follow-up. The results of the interim analysis were evalu-
ated by the DSMB. If conclusive results were obtained, the trial
would be stopped and the code broken, thereby avoiding further
placebo treatments in more patients. For this interim analysis, the
study results remained blinded to everyone, including the members
of the DSMB.
Statistical analysis. A sufficient sample size was cal-
culated as one that would allow for detection of differences of
$10 mm in the VAS global pain score at the end of the study
when comparing mean values between treatment groups. Based
on certain assumptions, including a standard deviation of 30
points, a global alpha error of 0.05, and a beta error of 0.2 (80%
power), the number of evaluable patients to be included was
125 per treatment arm. With a 20% dropout rate, the final sam-
ple size considered was 316 patients (158 per treatment arm).
The interim analysis was carried out when 158 patients
(50% of the total sample) had completed the first step of the
study period as planned. To conduct this analysis, the alpha
error was readjusted to 0.03 and the necessary sample size was
adjusted to 79 patients per treatment arm, in accordance with
the Pocock approach (22). It was established that an alpha
error of ,0.0307 would lead to a DSMB recommendation that
the trial be ended. Likewise, for an alpha value of .0.0307,
the DSMB would recommend that the trial be either contin-
ued or stopped for lack of efficacy.
The analysis populations were defined a priori as
follows: 1) modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, consis-
ting of all randomized patients who received at least one dose
of the study treatment and who had at least one postbaseline
assessment of the main variable; 2) per-protocol population,
consisting of all patients in the mITT population who were
without major protocol deviations; and 3) safety population,
made up of all randomized patients who received at least one
dose of the study treatment.
In this study, the mixed model for repeated measures
(MMRM) method was used in order to impute the missing val-
ues for the efficacy analysis. Absolute change from baseline was
calculated for each visit without imputing any missing values,
before the MMRM model was applied. Subsequently, the
MMRM analysis was performed by including in the model the
absolute change from baseline as the dependent variable, treat-
ment group as the independent variable, patient as the random
variable, and visit as the repeated measure. Thus, the MMRM
model was used to calculate a predicted value for each missing
value. After this imputation process had been carried out, the
MMRM model yielded estimates for the dependent variable and
P values for comparisons between treatments. The same process
was performed for the relative change from baseline.
Continuous variables were summarized using the mean6
SD. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used for comparisons between
groups when the continuous measure followed a normal distribu-
tion, and Levene’s test was carried out to confirm the homogene-
ity. Categorical variables were summarized in contingency tables
by presenting the number and percentage of subjects in each cate-
gory. The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each categorical
variable was included in the efficacy analysis tables. For continu-
ous variables, comparisons between treatments were done using
the parametric Student’s t-test when the variable followed a nor-
mal distribution, and the nonparametric Wilcoxon’s test when it
did not. Where applicable, the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact
test was performed to analyze the relationships between categori-
cal variables and treatments.
After checking the assumptions of normality, homosce-
dasticity, and parallelism, the comparison of continuous variables
between treatments (A versus B) was performed using a para-
metric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for the sensitiv-
ity analysis. Continuous variables (i.e., global pain scores) were
taken as explanatory variables. Treatment was the explicative var-
iable, and the baseline value was included as a covariate. To test
the influence of rescue medication, a second ANCOVA model
was constructed to include treatment, baseline VAS global pain
score, and rescue medication use.
For the difference between treatments, the mean val-
ues and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. All analyses
were undertaken using SAS for Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
Disposition and demographic characteristics of
the patients.
Of the 193 patients with knee OA who
were screened, 85.0% (n 5 164) were randomized to a
treatment group and included in the ITT population.
Among all patients who were included in the ITT

79
 analysis, 96.3% (n 5 158) were eligible for the mITT
population (Figure 1). In total, 18% of patients in the
placebo group compared with 31% of patients receiving
CS plus GS failed to complete the 6-month treatment
period in compliance with the terms established by the
study protocol (Figure 1). Although no significant dif-
ference was observed, the CS/GS combination therapy
group had a higher number of dropouts (mainly due to
AEs and protocol deviations) compared to the placebo
group (Figure 1). The median time to dropout in both
groups was similar: median 12.0 weeks (interquartile
range 8.1–13.4) in patients receiving CS plus GS and
11.5 weeks (interquartile range 5.1–13.0) in patients
receiving placebo.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the
patients with knee OA in the mITT population were com-
parable at baseline in both groups (Table 1). All recruited
patients had moderate-to-severe symptomatic knee OA,
with a mean 6 SD VAS global pain score of 62.16
11.3 mm at baseline. The rate of compliance was 94.3%.
Efficacy results. The efficacy data were analyzed
in a blinded manner. It is important to remember that the
DSMB could stop the trial and break the study code if sig-
nificant differences in the primary end point between the 2
treatment arms were evident at the time of the interim anal-
ysis. Indeed, at this interim time point, in the mITT popula-
tion, there was a mean6 SD reduction in the VAS global
pain score from baseline to 6 months of 220.56 2.4 mm
(33% reduction) in the placebo group compared to
211.86 2.4 mm (19% reduction) in the active treatment
group. Differences in global pain scores between the 2
groups were found as early as 12 weeks after the initiation
of treatment, and reached a peak difference of 8.7 mm
(14.2%) at 6 months, in favor of greater reduction in pain
in the placebo group (P5 0.029) (Figure 2). In contrast, in

 the per-protocol population, the change in VAS global
pain scores was similar in both groups (P 5 0.072).
No differences in any of the secondary outcome
measures were observed between the groups at 6
months of treatment. Indeed, in both the mITT popula-
tion and the per-protocol population, a larger decrease
in the investigator’s global assessment of disease activity,
total WOMAC score, and pain and function WOMAC
subscale scores occurred in the placebo group than in
the CS plus GS group, although the differences were
not statistically significant (Table 2).
By the end of the study, ;50% of patients, both in
the mITT population and in the per-protocol population,
fulfilled the OMERACT–OARSI response criteria and
subcriteria. The proportion of responders in the placebo
group was similar to that in the CS/GS combination ther-
apy group, both in the mITT population and in the per-
protocol population (Table 3). Furthermore, 144 patients

 (91%) took acetaminophen during the study (mean 6 SD
dosage 0.69 6 0.6 gm/day per patient). In the CS/GS com-
bination therapy group, 72 patients (90%) took a rescue
medication, as compared to 72 patients (92.3%) in the pla-
cebo group (P 5 0.61). The daily dosage of acetaminophen
was a mean 6 SD 0.646 0.52 gm/day in those receiving
CS plus GS and 0.736 0.65 gm/day in those receiving
placebo.
Safety results.
With regard to the results of the
safety analyses, the 159 patients (97%) included in the ITT
population received at least one dose of the study treat-
ment. Of these, a small number of dropouts related to AEs
was reported in both groups. The incidence of dropout
was higher in the CS/GS combination therapy group
(Table 4), and reasons for dropping out mainly consisted
of abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, upper abdomi-
nal pain, and constipation. There was, however, a trend
toward fewer withdrawals associated with other reasons in
the CS/GS combination therapy group compared to the
placebo group.
DISCUSSION
This is the first randomized controlled trial spon-
sored by a pharmaceutical company to evaluate the efficacy
of the combination of CS plus GS for the treatment of knee
OA, and was the first to include a DSMB composed of inde-
pendent experts charged with ensuring participant safety
and accurate, bias-free data. Indeed, this independent
group of experts carried out an interim analysis in adher-
ence to preestablished criteria. Given the differences found
in the primary end point between the 2 treatment arms, the
blinding was broken by the DSMB, and unexpectedly,
patients receiving placebo showed a greater reduction in
the VAS global pain score than did patients receiving com-
bined treatment with CS plus GS. However, the difference
in pain reduction among per-protocol completers was not
significant between the groups. In addition, no significant
differences in secondary outcomes were observed between
the 2 treatment arms, including the total WOMAC score,
the pain and function subscale scores on the WOMAC, the
proportion of OMERACT–OARSI responders, and the
frequency of consumption of rescue medication.
Furthermore, our research is one of the few studies
to investigate the efficacy and safety of CS in combination
with crystalline GS, both of them of patented pharmaceuti-
cal quality. Previous evidence suggested that crystalline
forms of glucosamine are more effective than other salts of
glucosamine or nutraceutical supplements (23).
Although the use of CS and GS as a treatment for
joint pain has been recognized since the 1970s, limited
data are available with regard to the effect of CS/GS com-
bination therapy on knee OA. Some clinical studies have
addressed the therapeutic effects of this combination on
OA, especially in terms of reducing pain and improving
function (7,8,24). Furthermore, certain more recent stud-
ies have described a potential benefit of chondroitin plus
glucosamine in modifying the structural progression of
knee OA (25,26). However, strong criticism has been
raised with regard to the design and data interpretation of
these clinical and structural studies, including the lack of a
placebo arm or flaws in their design (11,12). In contrast,
other studies have failed to demonstrate a significant bene-
fit of CS/GH combination therapy in terms of amelioration
of long-term symptoms or structural damage (27–29). In
this regard, a recent 4-year follow-up study of the Osteoar-
thritis Initiative cohort showed that CS/GS combination
treatment did not relieve symptoms or modify disease pro-
gression (30). Of note, most of the studies with combined
therapy were done with GH or with nutraceutical supple-
ments, both being products whose effectiveness remains
controversial.
Several biases in the study design and data manage-
ment, which could have been introduced not only by phar-
maceutical companies but also by independent authors,
might have contributed to the contradictory results
observed in previous randomized controlled trials (31).
The quality of the products administered, the data manage-
ment, and the use of a placebo arm are some of the more

 substantial points of criticism (9,27,31–33). In the present
study, the CS (isolated from tissue of bovine origin) and the
GS (obtained from a crustacean shell) were of pharmaceu-
tical grade, thus strengthening the validity of our results.
With regard to the quality of the data manage-
ment, an independent DSMB was appointed before the
clinical trial began, to perform an interim analysis ensur-
ing the neutrality and reliability of the data obtained.
According to the protocol, after a significant difference
in pain reduction was detected in one treatment arm over
the other (P 5 0.029), the DSMB advised breaking the
code. Surprisingly, placebo showed greater efficacy than
the active treatment in terms of reaching the primary end
point at 6 months. Finally, the study was ended to pre-
vent overexposure of additional patients to placebo treat-
ment. This supports the appointment of external expert
boards to avoid potential biases derived from sponsors.
In considering the primary end point, the effect of
the placebo was higher than that of the CS/GS combina-
tion therapy in this study, albeit differences in secondary
end points were not found. In OA, the placebo response
itself may be important, because the results and the inter-
pretation of the studies depend not only on the response
to the active drug but also on the magnitude and direction
of the response to the placebo. The placebo effect on pain
and other symptoms related to OA may range from an
improvement rate of 20–25% up to 60%, depending on
the duration of disease, the severity of disease, and the
scales used for assessment (6,8). In a recent meta-analysis,
all interventions significantly outperformed that of oral
placebo for the reduction of joint pain, with effect sizes
ranging from 0.63 (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 0.39–
0.88) for the most efficacious treatment (hyaluronic acid)
to 0.18 (95% CrI 0.04–0.33) for the least efficacious treat-
ment (acetaminophen). Notably, intraarticular placebo
was found to have a significantly larger effect (effect size
0.29, 95% CrI 0.04–0.54) when compared to orally admin-
istered placebo (34). These findings are consistent with
those presented in a previous systematic review of all
treatments used for OA (13), and with studies that com-
pared use of needles to use of pills for the treatment of
other medical conditions (35–38). All of these findings
provide a clear argument against the assessment of effi-
cacy of CS/GS combination therapy in knee OA without a
placebo control. Furthermore, our results could have been
interpreted differently in the absence of a placebo arm.
It is interesting to point out that the effect size in
the placebo group in our study was low, and the effect of
CS plus GS was even weaker as compared to that previ-
ously reported in other studies (7). These findings may be
attributed to the fact that GS may interfere with the
absorption of CS and could therefore reduce its local
effect (39). With time, our patients may have had less
severe knee pain when compared to the patients in those
other studies, which would justify a more attenuated effect
of the pharmacologic intervention in this study. Further-
more, when the main outcome studied is particularly sub-
jective, the placebo effect can overcome the effect of the
active drug. In addition, the presence of abdominal symp-
toms could interfere with joint pain global assessments.
The lower improvement in pain severity observed in the
CS plus GS treatment group compared to the placebo
group, as measured by the VAS global pain score, could
be related to the higher number of patients with abdomi-
nal discomfort in the CS plus GS treatment group, thereby
skewing the results in favor of more self-reported pain
improvement in the placebo group.
Our study has some limitations that need to be
acknowledged. The size of the study sample was small,
although it was adequate to demonstrate nonsuperiority
of the active treatment arm. Another confounding factor
is the analgesic effect conferred by the use of a pain killer
(acetaminophen) as a rescue medication, which is allowed
in all OA clinical trials. Moreover, a higher number of
dropouts due to AEs was detected in the CS/GS combina-
tion group, a factor that may interfere with the patient’s
global pain assessment. Finally, failure to meet the thera-
peutic goals could be attributed to the dosage regimen
used in this study. Whereas the daily dose of CS and GS
was administered twice per day in previous studies (7,8),
the same total dose was administered only once daily in
the current study. Nevertheless, as in our study, GS has
also been administered once daily in other studies, and no
difference in efficacy between CS administered once a day
and CS administered in divided doses has been found
(40). Thus, our results cannot be convincingly explained
by differences in the dosage regimen used.
In summary, our findings show that CS/GS com-
bination therapy was not superior to placebo in control-
ling pain and functional limitation in patients with knee
OA at 6 months of treatment. Further preclinical and
clinical research may provide valuable insights into the
efficacy of combined treatment with CS plus GS as a
therapeutic option in patients with OA.
