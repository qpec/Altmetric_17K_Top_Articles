Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 11, pp. 2165–2174, 2016. Purpose: This study aimed to compare the effects of three different high-intensity training
(HIT) models, balanced for total load but differing in training plan progression, on endurance adaptations. Methods: Sixty-three
cyclists (peak oxygen uptake (V
˙ O2peak) 61.3 T 5.8 mLIkgj1Iminj1) were randomized to three training groups and instructed to
follow a 12-wk training program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of low-intensity training, and laboratory testing.
The increasing HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 � 16 min in weeks 1–4, 4 � 8 min in weeks 5–8, and 4 � 4 min
in weeks 9–12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the increasing
HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all mesocycles.
Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmolILj1 blood
lactate in 4 � 16-, 4 � 8-, and 4 � 4-min sessions, respectively (P G 0.001). Pre- and postintervention, cyclists were tested for
mean power during a 40-min all-out trial, peak power output during incremental testing to exhaustion, V
˙ O2peak, and power at
4 mmolILj1 lactate. Results: All groups improved 5%–10% in mean power during a 40-min all-out trial, peak power output, and
V
˙ O2peak postintervention (P G 0.05), but no adaptation differences emerged among the three training groups (P 9 0.05). Further,
an individual response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large, moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
training group (P 9 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk training period has little or no effect on training adaptation when
the overall training load is the same. Key Words: CYCLING, ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE, LACTATE THRESHOLD,

o maximize physiological adaptations and perfor-
mance capability in elite athletes, all factors involved
in the training organization need to be optimized. In
endurance sports, these include the duration and intensity
of individual training sessions, the frequency of training
sessions, and the organizational pattern of these stimulus
variables over time. Recent descriptive studies of some of
the world_s best endurance athletes have shown that suc-
cessful athletes in cycling (14,25,35), running (1,2), and
cross-country skiing (21,22,33) perform a high volume of
low-intensity training (LIT) (defined as work eliciting a
stable blood lactate concentration [laj] of less than approxi-
mately 2 mmolILj1) in addition to much smaller but sub-
stantial proportions of both moderate-intensity training (MIT)
(2–4 mmolILj1 blood lactate) and high-intensity training
(HIT) (training above maximum lactate steady-state intensity
[94 mmolILj1 blood lactate]) throughout the preparation pe-
riod. The majority of descriptive studies present a ‘‘pyramidal’’
training intensity distribution (TID), with high volume of
LIT, substantial MIT, and less HIT, whereas a few studies
suggest athletes to adopt a ‘‘polarized’’ TID (reduced volume

 of MIT, somewhat higher HIT), which have been proposed
to give superior endurance adaptations (27,29). However,
although some evidence suggests superior responses by
increased HIT in a clearly polarized TID, there is currently
limited empirical data comparing different stimulus ordering
approaches for the HIT component of training that is often
seen as critical to maximizing adaptations.
The term training ‘‘periodization’’ originates primarily from
older eastern European texts and is widely and rather indis-
criminately used to describe and quantify the planning process
of training (11). Periodization plans add training load struc-
ture, with well-defined training periods designed to stimulate
specific physiological adaptations (e.g., V
˙ O2max) or per-
formance qualities in a specific order presumed optimal for
performance development. Such endurance training models
involve the manipulation of different training sessions periodized
over timescales ranging from microcycle (2–7 d), to mesocycle
(3–6 wk), to macrocycle (6–12 months; including preparation,
competition, and transition periods). Recent experimental find-
ings indicate improved training adaptations after shorter, highly
focused training periods of HIT compared with mixed programs
with the same total quantity of intensive sessions (18–20). For
example, RLnnestad et al. (18) found superior effects of a
12-wk block periodization program, where each 4-wk cycle
consisted of 1 wk of five HIT sessions, followed by 3 wk of
one HIT session per week, when compared with a tradi-
tional program incorporating ‘‘two weekly HIT sessions.’’
However, others report superior effects after a polarized TID
compared with an HIT block periodized training concept
(28). The latter study was, however, not conducted with
groups performing the same quantity of HIT sessions, which
may have affected the results.
These recent findings not only confirm HIT to be an
important stimulus for endurance adaptations but also high-
light mesocycle organization as a potential modifier of the
adaptive response. Previous research has shown that the
physiological adaptations to HIT sessions are also sensitive
to the interactive effects of intensity and accumulated dura-
tion. For example, both Seiler et al. (26) and Sandbakk et al.
(23) have recently demonstrated that slight reductions in
HIT work intensity facilitated large increases in tolerable
accumulated duration and better overall adaptive responses
in well-trained cyclists and cross-country skiers. Although
research has progressed our understanding of the intensity/
accumulated duration relationship during HIT sessions and
its relationship with endurance performance development
in an isolated fashion (23,26), the accumulative effects of
the order of such sessions are not well understood. Different
patterns of HIT ordering are used by elite athletes. Some
endurance athletes increase HIT intensity and decreasing
HIT duration from the preparation to the competition period
(32,33). However, anecdotal evidence also shows that some
successful athletes use a ‘‘reversed’’ model, where HIT in-
tensity is decreased and HIT duration increased, or a ‘‘mixed’’
model with larger microvariation of various HIT sessions
(e.g., interval sessions) throughout the training period.
Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to compare
the effects of three different HIT models, balanced for total
load but periodized in a specific mesocycle order or in a mixed
distribution, on endurance adaptations during a 12-wk train-
ing period in well-trained endurance athletes. We simulated
a preparation period in which cyclists in increasing (INC),
decreasing (DEC), and mixed (MIX) HIT groups performed
training periods that were matched for all features (frequency,
total volume, and overall HIT load) except the mesocycle
order or distribution of HIT sessions. We hypothesized that
the INC HIT organization would be best tolerated and give
best overall adaptive effects.
METHODS
This was a multicenter study involving three test centers
completing the same controlled experimental trial. At each
test center, three matched periodization groups were instructed
to follow a 12-wk high-volume LIT model, in addition to a
significant portion HIT performed as prescribed as supervised
interval sessions. Performance and physiological tests were
compared before and after the intervention period.
Subjects
Sixty-nine male cyclists (38 T 8 yr, V
˙ O2peak 62 T
6 mLIkgj1Iminj1) were recruited to the study using an-
nouncements in social media and through local cycling clubs.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) male, 2) V
˙ O2peak
955 mLIkgj1Iminj1, 3) training frequency more than four
sessions per week, 4) cycling experience 93 yr, 5) regularly
competing, and 6) absence of known disease or exercise
limitations. Study participation was administered from three
different test locations, including 29, 20, and 20 subjects, re-
spectively. All subjects were categorized as well trained (12)
or at performance level 4 according to an athlete categoriza-
tion by De Pauw et al. (6). All subjects completed the inter-
vention. However, we excluded six subjects from the final
analyses because of absence from posttesting and/or G70%
compliance with prescribed interval sessions. Excluded sub-
jects were from MIX (two subjects) and DEC (four subjects)
groups. The study was approved by the ethics committee of
the Faculty for Health and Sport Science, University of Agder,
and registered with the Norwegian Social Science Data
Services. All subjects gave their verbal and written informed
consent before study participation.
Preintervention Period
Before intervention, a 6-wk preintervention period (PIP)
was conducted to familiarize subjects with interval sessions
included in the intervention period and with testing pro-
tocols (Fig. 1). During the PIP, subjects were instructed to
perform only one interval session each week, combined with
freely chosen (ad libitum) LIT volume. All subjects completed
a questionnaire regarding training history the previous year,
years of cycling experience, previous peak performance level,

 and previous/current injuries and diseases. Pretesting was per-
formed at the end of the PIP (mid-December), and subjects
were thereafter randomized into one of three different train-
ing groups (INC, DEC, and MIX) matched for 1) age, 2)
cycling experience, and 3) V
˙ O2peak.
Intervention Period
Training organization. The training intervention was
performed from early January to the end of March (12 wk),
corresponding to the early preparation period for these
cyclists and consisted of three 4-wk mesocycles. Subjects
were instructed to follow a mesocycle week load structure
as follows: week 1, medium LIT volume and two supervised
interval sessions; weeks 2 and 3, high LIT volume and three
supervised interval sessions; and week 4, reduced LIT volume
by 50% compared with the previous 2 wk and one HIT session
executed as a physiological test (results not presented). In
total, each subject was prescribed 24 supervised interval
sessions, in addition to laboratory testing, and self-organized
ad libitum LIT equal to the subject_s normal LIT volume. Each
intervention group organized interval sessions in a specific
periodized mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during
mesocycles 1–3 (Fig. 1).
Interval sessions. All HIT was performed indoors as
supervised group interval training sessions and included a
20- to 30-min low-intensity (55%–70% HRmax) warm-up,
followed by four interval bouts of 4, 8, or 16 min separated by
a 2-min rest, and concluded with a 10- to 30-min low-intensity
(55%–70% HRmax) cooldown. Sessions were performed at
the same time of day throughout the intervention period with
room temperature maintained at 17-C–20-C and 50%–60%
relative humidity. Subjects manipulated cycling load elec-
tronically by adjusting the ergometer with T3-W precision, and
they were provided with continuous feedback regarding their
absolute and average power, cadence (rpm), HR, and elapsed
time on a large video screen. Revolutions per minute was
individually selected. During interval sessions, subjects
were instructed to cycle at their maximal sustainable in-
tensity during all four interval bouts (isoeffort) (26,27) such
that they 1) completed the described session structure (all
four interval bouts completed with only a 2-min rest) and 2)
with even or progressive power from first to fourth interval
bout. Before each interval session, we estimated the power
each subject would be able to maintain during all interval
bouts based on previous interval sessions and subject feed-
back. Mean power, HR (mean and peak), RPE 6–20 (3), and
revolutions per minute were quantified at the end of each
interval lap. Blood lactate concentration [laj] was measured
randomly among a subset of 56 subjects at the end of the third
and fourth interval bout. Data from all intervention groups
pooled together showed that the three different interval pre-
scriptions (4 � 16 min, 4 � 8 min, and 4 � 4 min) induced
significantly different mean power, [laj], and HR (mean and
max) responses. In addition, both RPE and session RPE
(sRPE) (9) were significantly different across interval pre-
scriptions despite the same ‘‘maximal session effort’’ ap-
proach (Table 1). However, all intervention groups (INC,
DEC, and MIX) executed the three different interval pre-
scriptions with similar mean power, [laj], HR (mean and
FIGURE 1—Study protocol. A 6-wk PIP, including familiarization to interval sessions, pretesting, and randomization (R), was followed by a 12-wk
intervention period divided in three 4-wk mesocycles with different interval session prescriptions for each training group. All groups performed
24 supervised interval sessions, in addition to testing and ad libitum LIT. The INC group (n = 23) performed 8 interval sessions as 4 � 16 min in
mesocycle 1 (weeks 1–4), 8 interval sessions as 4 � 8 min in mesocycle 2 (weeks 5–8), and 8 interval sessions as 4 � 4 min in mesocycle 3 (weeks 9–12). The
DEC group (n = 20) performed interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as INC, and the MIX group (n = 20) organized all 24 interval
sessions (8 in each mesocycle) in a mixed distribution; sessions 1 as 4 � 16 min, session 2 as 4 � 8 min, session 3 as 4 � 4 min, session 4 as 4 � 16 min,
and so on. In total, during 12 wk, all subjects independent of group performed 8 interval sessions in each 4 � 16-, 4 � 8-, and 4 � 4-min
prescriptions, respectively. All subjects were tested (T) in-between cycles during weeks 4 and 8 (results not presented). Posttesting was completed
within 5 d postintervention period.

 max), RPE, and sRPE. In addition, there was no significant
difference in total compliance (% interval sessions com-
pleted) among intervention groups.
Training monitoring. All subjects were provided with
the Norwegian Olympic committee_s online training diary to
record their training. The following variables were regis-
tered for each training session: 1) total training form dura-
tion (endurance, strength, sprint/jump, other), 2) activity
form duration (cycling, running, cross-country skiing, etc.),
3) total duration in each endurance training zone (session
goal/time in zone method [31]), 4) session goal categorical
intensity distribution (31), 5) perceived exertion (1–10) rated
30 min postexercise (sRPE) (8), and 6) self-reported re-
covery status (1–9) (18). Individualized HR zones were
calculated based on the HRpeak results from pretesting using
a five-zone aerobic intensity scale used by the Norwegian
Olympic Federation to prescribe and monitor the training of
well-trained endurance athletes: zone 1, 60%–75% HRpeak;
zone 2, 75%–85% HRpeak; zone 3, 85%–90% HRpeak; zone 4,
90%–95% HRpeak; and zone 5, 95%–100% HRpeak (27).
There were no significant differences among groups in
any training variable measured as mean during 12 wk (Table 2)
and no significant differences in training volume during
the intervention period compared with the previous train-
ing year. Weekly training volume remained stable across
mesocycles 1–3 in all groups (average cycle 1: 9.8 T 3.2 hIwkj1;
cycle 2: 10.0 T 3.2 hIwkj1; cycle 3: 10.7 T 3.1 hIwkj1). A self-
reported scale for recovery status suggested that subjects
were fully recovered every fourth week, as there were no
significant differences among the three intervention groups
or across 4-wk training cycles in self-reported recovery status
(data not shown).
Testing Procedures
Pretesting was completed 2 wk before intervention start.
Posttesting was initiated 2–4 d after the last supervised in-
terval session for all subjects and completed within 10 d.
Both testing periods were performed for 2 d separated by
a minimum of 48 h recovery. Subjects were instructed to
perform only LIT for a minimum of 48 h preceding each test
and to consume the same type of meal. They were instructed
to not eat during the last hour or consume caffeine during the
last 3 h preceding testing.
Test day 1. On day 1, four to six submaximal incremental
5-min steps were performed in the laboratory on a bicycle
ergometer to identify the workload eliciting 4 mmolILj1 [laj]
(Power4mM) and gross efficiency (GE). The test started with
5-min cycling at 125 W, and V
˙ O2, respiratory exchange ratio
(RER), and HR were measured during the last 2.5 min, with
mean values for this period used for statistical analyses.
Blood [laj] was measured after 4.30 min, and RPE was
determined at the end of each 5-min step using Borg_s 6–20
RPE scale (3). Power was increased by 50 W (25 W if [laj]
was 93 mmolILj1) after 5 min. Testing was terminated when
[laj] reached Q4 mmolILj1. Power and V

 4 mmolILj1 [laj] were identified after plotting the true power–
lactate curve for each subject, by fitting a polynomial regres-
sion model (17). GE was calculated using the method of Coyle
et al. (5). Briefly, the rate of energy expenditure was calculated
by using gross V
˙ O2 from the first three 5-min submaximal
steps (125, 175, and 225 W), and GE was expressed as the
ratio of work accomplished per minute to caloric expenditure
per minute.
After 10 min recovery, an incremental test to exhaustion
was performed to determine 1) V
˙ O2peak, 2) peak power
output (PPO), 3) HRpeak, and 4) peak blood lactate concen-
tration [laj
peak]. The test started with 1 min of cycling at
3 WIkgj1 (rounded down to nearest 50 W) and subse-
quently increased by 25 W every minute until voluntary
exhaustion or failure to maintain Q70 rpm. Strong verbal
encouragement was provided throughout the test. V
˙ O2peak
was calculated as the average of the two highest 30-s con-
secutive V
˙ O2 measurements. The plateau of the V
˙ O2 curve
and/or the HR Q95% of known HRmax, RER Q1.10, and [laj]
Q8.0 mmolILj1 were used as criteria for the attainment of
a valid test (10). PPO was calculated as the mean power
during the last minute of the test. HRpeak was recorded
during the final 5 s before exhaustion, and [laj
peak] was
measured 60 s postexhaustion. In addition, a theoretical
maximal aerobic power was calculated by using submaximal
V
˙ O2 measurements in addition to V
˙ O2peak. Maximal aerobic
power was defined as the power where the horizontal line
representing V
˙ O2peak meets the extrapolated linear regression
representing the submaximal V
˙ O2/power relationship. To
estimate fractional use of V
˙ O2peak, the previously described
V
˙ O2 corresponding to 4 mmolILj1 [laj] was calculated as
percentage of V
˙ O2peak (%V
˙ O2peak@4 mM).
Finally, after 15 min recovery, a 30-s all-out Wingate test
(36) was conducted. The test started with the subject ped-
aling at a freely chosen cadence less than 120 rpm for 20 s
with an ~150-W braking resistance. Then after a 3-s count-
down, a braking resistance equivalent to 0.7 NImIkgj1 body
mass (Lode Excalibur) or a 0.098 torque factor (Velotron)
was applied to the flywheel and remained constant throughout the
30-s test. Cyclists were instructed to pedal as fast as possible from
start and were allowed to sit or stand as preferred throughout
the test. Strong verbal encouragement was provided throughout.
The mean power during 30 s (Power30s) was recorded.
Test day 2. On test day 2, subjects performed a 40-min
all-out trial. The test started with a 30-min warm-up at a self-
selected power output. Thereafter, subjects were instructed
to cycle at the highest possible mean power during 40 min.
Subjects were blinded to power output and HR but were
allowed to see remaining time and rpm. They were encour-
aged to remain seated during the trial but were permitted to
stand and stretch their legs occasionally, and they were
allowed to drink water ad libitum. Mean power, mean HR
(HRmean), and HRpeak were registered, as well as RPE and
[laj], at the end of the test.
Instruments and materials. For each individual, all tests
on day 1 were performed on the same Velotron (Racermate,
Seattle, WA) or Lode Excalibur Sport (Lode B. V., Groningen,
The Netherlands) cycle ergometer under similar environmental
conditions (18-C–22-C/50%–60% relative humidity). Pre- and
posttests were performed at the same time of day. Saddle
height, handlebar position, and distance between the tip of
the saddle and the bottom bracket were adjusted by each
subject as desired. Subjects were instructed to remain seated
during all tests (except the 30-s all-out test) and allowed to
choose their preferred cadence. Both test ergometers are
computer controlled and provide G2% margin of error in both
accuracy and repeatability, according to the manufacturer.
Test day 2 and all interval sessions were performed in groups
on their own road racing bicycle mounted on Computrainer
LabTM ergometers (Race Mate, Seattle, WA) calibrated according
to the manufacturer_s specifications and connected to a central
PC running dedicated software (PerfPRO Studio, Hartware
Technologies, Rockford, MI).
V
˙ O2 was measured using Oxycon Proi with a mixing
chamber and a 30-s sampling time (Oxycon; Jaeger GmbH,
Hoechberg, Germany). Gas sensors were calibrated via an
automated process using certified calibration gasses of known
concentrations before every test. The flow turbine (Triple V,

(5530 series; Hans Rudolph, Kansas, MO). HR was mea-
sured using Polar V800 (Polar Elektro Oy, Kempele, Finland).
Blood [laj] were analyzed using a stationary lactate analyzer
(EKF BIOSEN; EKF Diagnostics, Cardiff, UK).
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL) and are presented as mean T SD or 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). Baseline and training characteristics
were compared using a one-way between-groups ANOVA,
followed by Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests. A one-way
repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare differ-
ences among 4 � 16 min, 4 � 8 min, and 4 � 4 min interval
session prescriptions. A univariate general linear model
(GLM) (ANCOVA) was used to assess differences in base-
line characteristics and changes in test variables among the
intervention groups. A GLM repeated-measures model
(ANOVA) was used to compare pre- and posttest results in
each group. GLM analyses were adjusted for the influence
of different covariates (test location and pre-Power4mM
(WIkgj1)) and conducted to ensure that there were no viola-
tions of the assumptions of normality, linearity, and spheric-
ity. All data analyzed by GLM are presented as adjusted
values. Because of expectations of small changes in these
already well-trained cyclists, the data were further analyzed
with effect size (ES) calculated according to Cohen_s d (0.2 =
small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large) (4). Medium or large ES
(90.5) are discussed as tendencies if comparisons are non-
significant. The frequency distribution of individual response
magnitude across training groups was compared using a chi-
square test, and ES was calculated with Cramer_s V with three

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics and Body Mass
There were no significant differences among training
groups before the intervention period with respect to age,
cycling experience, body mass, or any performance or
physiological test variables (Table 3). After the interven-
tion, there was a significant body mass reduction in INC
(80.3 T 7.4 vs 79.0 T 7.6 kg), DEC (79.7 T 7.8 vs 78.5 T
7.5 kg), and MIX (79.7 T 8.9 vs 78.2 T 8.8 kg) training
groups (all P G 0.05).
Performance Responses
All training groups improved significantly in all perfor-
mance measures after the intervention period. The mean
(95% CI) improvement before and after the mean power
during a 40-min all-out trial (Power40min) was 8.0% (5.3–
10.6), 7.4% (4.4–10.4), and 4.9% (1.8–8.0) in INC, DEC,
and MIX groups, respectively (all P G 0.05; Fig. 2). The rel-
ative improvement did not differ among groups (P = 0.307),
but there was a medium ES when comparing difference in
absolute values (Table 3) in INC and DEC versus MIX
groups. Mean (95% CI) PPO values increased significantly
by 7.1% (4.7–9.5), 6.0% (3.4–8.6), and 6.5% (3.9–9.2) in
INC, DEC, and MIX groups, respectively (all P G 0.05;
Fig. 2), with no differences among groups (P = 0.813). The
MIX and the DEC groups improved significantly in mean
(95% CI) Power30s by 2.4% (0.3–4.4) and 2.7% (0.7–4.7),
respectively (both P G 0.05), whereas a nonsignificant 1.2%
(j0.7, 3.1) change occurred in the INC group. The changes
in Power30s did not differ among groups (P = 0.509).
Physiological Responses
The INC and the DEC groups improved mean (95% CI)
Power4mM significantly by 5.8% (2.7–8.9) and 5.9%
(2.6–9.2), respectively (all P G 0.05).The MIX group showed
a nonsignificant change of 2.9% (j0.4 to 6.3) (Fig. 2). The
relative changes among groups in Power4mM did not differ
(P = 0.360), but there was a medium ES when comparing
absolute values (Table 3) in the INC group versus the MIX
group. All groups significantly improved mean (95% CI)
V
˙ O2peak by 5.8% (3.7–8.0), 4.5% (2.3–6.8), and 3.8% (1.5–
6.0) in the INC, DEC, and MIX groups, respectively (all
P G 0.05; Fig. 2). No significant differences occurred among
groups (P = 0.392), but there was a medium ES when com-
paring absolute values (Table 3) in the INC group versus the
MIX group.
The DEC group significantly improved mean (95% CI) frac-
tional use calculated as V
˙ O2peak@4 mM by 3.7% (1.2–6.3)
(P G 0.05). There was a nonsignificant 1.3% (j1.1 to 3.7)
and j0.5% (j3.1 to 2.1) change in the INC and MIX groups,

 respectively (Fig. 2). Although the relative changes among
groups did not differ (P = 0.070), there was a medium ES
when comparing the DEC group versus the MIX group. All
groups decreased in GE. Mean (95% CI) relative changes were
j2.6% (j4.4 to j0.9) in the INC group (P G 0.05), j2.0%
(j3.8 to j0.2) in the DEC group (P G 0.05), and j1.4%
(j3.3 to 0.4) in the MIX group (not significant) (Fig. 2),
with no significant differences among groups (P = 0.642).
A chi-square test for independence indicated no signif-
icant association among training groups and individual per-
formance (Power40min) response (P = 0.146, Fig. 3). There
was, however, a medium ES (4), calculated with Cramer_s V
with three categories. Approximately 87%, 63%, and 56%
of subjects in the INC, DEC, and MIX groups, respectively,
achieved moderate to large gains in performance capacity,
whereas ~13%, 37%, and 44% showed nonresponse.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that, at the group level,
the physiological and performance improvements after in-
tensified training were moderate to large in all the training
groups used in this study. This indicates that the basic load
features of the training were well tolerated and effective.
However, the specific HIT periodized mesocycle order or
mixed distribution, focusing on manipulating the intensity
prescription for interval sessions, had little or no generaliz-
able effect on the adaptive effect of the same overall

 endurance training load. Furthermore, the individual varia-
tion in training response did not significantly differ among
the three training groups, suggesting similar expected dis-
tribution of large, moderate, or nonresponses, respectively,
to each prescription.
Performance and Physiological Adaptations
After a 12-wk training period, including two to three in-
terval sessions each week in addition to ad libitum LIT, we
found that all groups significantly increased performance
variables (Power40min and PPO) by 5%–8%. Coinciding
with 40-min all-out trial improvements, Power4mM also in-
creased by 3%–6% in all groups. These performance re-
sponse magnitudes are consistent with previous studies
investigating the effect of HIT over similar time frames
(15,18,24), or after shorter HIT interventions (2%–6%
improvement) (12,30). Furthermore, all groups increased
V
˙ O2peak significantly by 4%–6%, which is in line with the
increase in V
˙ O2max reported in other studies involving
well-trained to elite-level cyclists during comparable training
periods (15,18,24). Overall, our results demonstrate that the
training load prescribed in the present study was effective in
improving performance and physiological capacity in well-
trained cyclists.
We found negligible changes in the fractional use of
V
˙ O2peak from pre- to posttest, in both the INC (~1%) and the
MIX (~0%) groups. The overall small changes in this vari-
able are likely because short-term HIT stimuli are more ef-
fective in inducing central cardiovascular adaptations (13).
However, the DEC group improved by ~4%.
A small decrease in GE occurred in all groups, despite
increased V
˙ O2peak. A relative shift in energetic contribution
from carbohydrate to fat could account for a small decrease
in GE. For example, a shift in RER from 0.87 to 0.82 at the
same oxygen consumption and power output would result in
an ~1% decline in GE (from for example, 21.6%–21.4%).
However, the decrease in GE observed in the present study
was still larger than what could be explained by a shift in
RER toward greater fat use. The main contributor to de-
creased GE is therefore probably due to higher oxygen
consumption, which has also been reported previously (9).
Group Comparisons
Despite large overall progress in all groups, we found no
significant differences among groups in adaptive changes
from pre- to postintervention, except the fractional use of
V
˙ O2peak where the DEC group tended to improve more than
the other groups. The latter may be a compensation of the
slightly smaller increase in V
˙ O2peak in DEC compared with
the INC group. Altogether, these results suggest that orga-
nizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
‘‘increasing’’ or ‘‘decreasing’’ mesocycle order or in a mixed
intensity distribution results in minor differences in adaptive
response when the overall load is the same.
However, although there were no significant differences
among groups, the greater microvariation of interval training
stimuli (i.e., the MIX group) tended to induce less overall
adaptive responses compared with the INC and the DEC
groups. We speculate that this tendency could be explained
by higher interval session ‘‘quality’’ in the INC and DEC
groups who, unlike the MIX group, performed the same
eight interval sessions consecutively during each mesocycle.
Therefore, subjects in the INC and DEC groups may have
been more familiar with their specific sessions and, thus,
able to more accurately pace their tolerable power/intensity
from the beginning of the first to the end of the fourth in-
terval bout.
We have failed to find any experimental studies for direct
comparisons with our results. However, previous experi-
mental studies manipulating HIT organization patterns dur-
ing timeframes from 2 to 12 wk indicate improved block
periodization training adaptations compared with mixed pro-
grams (18–20) and superior effects after a polarized TID
compared with an HIT block periodization training concept
(28). However, in these studies, block periodization was
organized as short periods with heavy HIT stimulus followed
by periods with LIT focus, or without same total training load
among groups, and is therefore not directly comparable to the
present study.
Individual Differences in Adaptations Response
Despite excellent overall control of the training program
variables, and no differences among groups in overall
training load, we quantified large individual differences in
adaptive response after 12 wk of training. This finding is
consistent with other recent studies (16,34). Furthermore, a
response distribution analysis for Power40min revealed no
significant differences in the variability of response across
groups (Fig. 3). However, we do note that only 56% and
63% of subjects in the MIX and DEC groups achieved 93%
improvement, as compared with 87% of subjects in the
INC group. Supplementary analyses of variables influencing

 the individual effects following different periodization models
are needed in future studies.
Methodological Considerations
The main strengths of this study were the structured ran-
domized design, rigorous monitoring of all training vari-
ables, and the large group of well-trained endurance athletes.
We managed to match the groups for total work (isoenergetic),
and all subjects, regardless of group, performed a well-
documented training model with two to three weekly interval
sessions interspersed with ad libitum LIT. On the basis of
previous studies using the same model of interval training
prescription (26), we anticipated that the different interval
duration prescriptions (4 � 16, 8, and 4 min) would constrain
three reasonably discrete work intensities, which would allow
us to compare the effects on endurance adaptations when
organizing those interval training prescriptions in different
periodized mesocycle groups. The distinctive physiological
responses to the three interval prescriptions were confirmed
by the significant differences in power, [laj], HR, RPE, and
sRPE during interval sessions.
This study was conducted as a multicenter trial involv-
ing three test locations, which administrated 29, 20, and
20 subjects each, respectively. We are conscious that,
despite our best efforts to standardize them, there could
be small methodological differences across centers that
may affect the intervention results.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study suggests that organizing different in-
terval sessions in a specific periodized mesocycle order or in
a mixed distribution during a 12-wk training period has little
or no effect on training adaptation when the overall training
load is the same. Although we found a small tendency in-
dicating that a larger microvariation in interval training in-
tensity and duration (i.e., the MIX group) actually induces
less adaptation, we overall argue that rigid periodization
structures are not supported by the results of this direct in-
tervention study.
