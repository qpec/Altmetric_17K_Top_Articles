IMPORTANCE Elevated systolic blood (SBP) pressure is a leading global health risk.
Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies and interventions.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and SBP of
140 mm Hg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and disability by age and
sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015.
DESIGN A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated distribution of
SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 1980-2015) of 8.69 million
participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of
mean SBP and adjusted variance for each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient
evidence for a causal relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke,
and hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health burden
related to SBP (�110-115 mm Hg and also �140 mm Hg) by age, sex, country, and year.

UnitedStatesaccountedformorethanhalfoftheglobalDALYsrelatedtoSBPofatleast110to

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some
estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (�110-115 and �140 mm Hg) increased substantially
between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths associated with elevated SBP also increased.
Projections based on this sample suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP
of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.

S
ystolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 110 mm Hg has
been related to multiple cardiovascular and renal out-
comes, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascu-
lar disease, and chronic kidney disease.1-3 The global obesity
epidemic may further increase SBP in some populations.4-6
The burden of SBP of at least 110 mm Hg remains high despite
the availability of preventive interventions and low-cost, ef-
fective antihypertensive medications.4,7
Several studies have assessed SBP measurements from
population-based examination surveys.4,5 The global bur-
den related to high SBP has been reported in detail for
1997, 2001, 2005, and 2010.5,6,8,9 Results from the Global
Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study 2015
(GBD 2015) related risk factors to 41% of all disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015.10 In GBD 2015, SBP was
associated with the highest burden among risk factors—more
than either smoking or obesity.10 In the current study, we
used the results of the GBD 2015 comparative risk assess-
ment to explore patterns of SBP above 110 to 115 mm Hg and
related deaths and DALYs for 195 countries and territories
from 1990 to 2015.10 This analysis reports separately the dis-
ease burden for participants aged 25 years and older related
to SBP levels of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and SBP levels of
140 mm Hg or higher.11,12
This analysis supersedes all previous global burden of dis-
ease study results for SBP because all data from 1990 to pres-
ent have been re-analyzed using consistent methods.
Methods
This analysis was part of the GBD 2015 comparative risk
assessment to assess health loss (DALYs) related to specific
risk factors.9 In contrast to pooling studies or primary studies
that analyze individual record data to estimate the magni-
tude of related burden and the number of people at different
levels of SBP, the GBD study is a descriptive meta-analysis of
available study results. Thus, the data are projections for
a population rather than direct estimates for a sample pop-
ulation and should be assessed considering the availability
of primary data for a given country and year, uncertainty of
the pooled estimates, and the overall modeling strategy
and assumptions.
Prior to the 1990s, diastolic blood pressure was consid-
ered to be a better predictor of health outcomes than SBP.
Later, epidemiological studies showed a greater association
and better predictive validity with outcomes for SBP, espe-
cially for patients who were older (in whom incidence of
related disease is higher).13,14 Atherosclerosis is known to
increase SBP and strengthen the association with heart, cen-
tral nervous system, and renal vascular diseases.15-17 Due to
the strong correlation between SBP and diastolic blood pres-
sure and to avoid double counting of high blood pressure
burden, measures of SBP alone are now used in studies of the
global and national burdens of risk factors. Only SBP was
included in this analysis. For this study, estimates were first
produced at age-, sex-, country-, year-, and cause-specific
strata before being aggregated.
The analysis was divided into 5 components in the
following sequence: (1) the distribution (mean and variance)
of SBP in each age, sex, and country group was estimated;
(2) the relative risks (RRs) of 10 cardiovascular and renal
outcomes, including chronic kidney disease, associated
with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg based on pooled pro-
spective cohort studies were estimated; (3) a level of mini-
mum risk for SBP was determined; (4) the cause-specific
population-attributable fraction (PAF) related to SBP that
was elevated above this minimum level of risk was calcu-
lated; and (5) deaths and DALYs related to SBP of at least 110
to 115 mm Hg were computed by multiplying each outcome
by the PAF for each country, age, sex, and year group.
Estimating SBP Distributions
Data for this study were obtained from an update to
the systematic review of health examination surveys re-
porting SBP originally conducted as part of the GBD
2010 study.9,18 Using PubMed, studies published between
July 15, 2009, and December 31, 2015, were added to the
original review. Studies were included if they were
population-based and measured SBP using a sphygmoma-
nometer (either manual or electronic; see eAppendix in
the Supplement for details on the evaluation of study qual-
ity and identifying and removing outliers). All measure-
ments of blood pressure were categorized by sex, and data
points were divided by age groups based on the global age
distribution of mean SBP using the available detailed age-
and sex-specific data. Mean SBP was estimated in each
age-, sex-, country-, and year-specific stratum using spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression (method has been
widely applied in global health estimation, including for
tobacco prevalence estimation and obesity).19,20 Detailed
methods for this estimation procedure are described in the
eAppendix (Supplement) and country data sources are pro-
vided in searchable form online through the Global Health
Data Exchange.21
Key Points
Question What is the worldwide association between elevated
blood pressure and the burden of disease?
Findings In studies from 154 countries that included 8.69 million
participants, it is estimated that between 1990 and 2015
the rate of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 110
to 115 mm Hg increased from 73 119 to 81 373 per 100 000
persons, and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17 307
to 20 526 per 100 000 persons. The estimated rate of annual
deaths associated with SBP of of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg
increased from 135.6 to 145.2 per 100 000 persons, and for SBP
of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 97.9 to 106.3 per
100 000 persons.
Meaning Over the past 25 years, the number of individuals
with worldwide SBP levels of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and
of 140 mm Hg or higher and the estimated associated deaths
have increased substantially.

Accounting for Blood Pressure Variation
ThestandarddeviationofSBPwasestimatedforeveryage,sex,
country, and year by estimating the relationship between the
mean of SBP and the standard deviation in available studies;
the proportion of variance of SBP due to measurement error
was also estimated (eAppendix in the Supplement).22-27 SBP
varies over time with circadian rhythm, changes in diet, physi-
calactivity,andtreatment,whichaddsubstantialrandomnoise
to the long-term exposure average.28 Random measurement
error of SBP also causes an attenuation of the association be-
tween the SBP level and incidence of disease outcomes called
regression dilution bias.29 A correction for usual SBP is com-
monly used in cohort studies to estimate the association be-
tween the level of SBP and the outcome risk. Using these cor-
rected RRs in burden of disease estimates requires the same
adjustment be applied to the distributions of SBP from sur-
veys that are based on 2 to 3 measurements taken during a
single encounter. Multiple measurements in a cohort of par-
ticipants over time can provide an estimate of the random
variation that needs to be taken out of the single (time) mea-
surement to correct for this underestimation of effect size.

Cohort studies and a meta-analysis of 147 clinical trials of
blood pressure–lowering drugs found improved outcomes
due to blood pressure lowering were similar across the range
of 120 to 180 mm Hg SBP levels at pretreatment.31,32 The RRs
that were based on blood pressure lowering in these meta-
analyses were similar to the results from the Prospective Stud-
ies Collaboration.33 For the present study, age-specific RRs for
cardiovascular outcomes based on pooled cohort studies were
used including the Prospective Studies Collaboration and the
Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration (eFigure 1 and eTable
1 in the Supplement).18,34 For this study, a meta-analysis of
cohort studies was completed to estimate the relationship be-
tween SBP and chronic kidney disease. Citation information
for the data sources used for RRs are provided by the Global
Health Data Exchange in a searchable web tool.21
Minimum Risk Level
The GBD comparative risk assessment framework is based on
the observation that risk caused by a given exposure begins at
acertainlevelandthenascendsasexposureincreasesabovethat
level. This counterfactual level is referred to as the theoretical
minimum-risk exposure level which, when compared with an
observedlevelofSBP,allowsforestimationofthePAF.Thetheo-
retical minimum-risk exposure level of SBP was estimated to
range from 110 to 115 mm Hg based on pooled prospective co-
hort studies that show risk of mortality increases for SBP above
that level.30,35 Recent randomized clinical trial results, includ-
ing the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and
theHeartOutcomesPreventionEvaluation(HOPE-3),showthat
lifestyle modification early in life is likely to be a major compo-
nent for lowering SBP to near this level given the variable range
of benefit observed in these studies when blood pressure was
lowered with antihypertensive medications alone.36-38 The se-
lection of a theoretical minimum-risk exposure level of an SBP
level of 110 to 115 mm Hg—the level that captures the maxi-
mum attributable burden—is consistent with the GBD study
approach of estimating all attributable health loss that could be
prevented even if current interventions did not exist that
could achieve such a change in exposure level (eg, a tobacco-
smokingprevalenceof0%).Somestudies,suchastheFraming-
ham cohort, have found an increase in SBP with increasing age
andithasbeensuggestedthatthetheoreticalminimum-riskex-
posure level should also follow this age pattern.39 Other stud-
ies that found no change in SBP with age40-42 support main-
taining a single theoretical minimum-risk exposure level
across age groups. Based on the current evidence,43 we deter-
mined that a difference in theoretical minimum-risk exposure
level by age group was not sufficiently supported and decided
to retain a single level across age groups. Further investiga-
tionsintheformofcohortsorpooledcohortstudiesareneeded
to determine if varying the theoretical minimum-risk expo-
sure level for SBP with age group is justified. To include the un-
certainty in the theoretical minimum-risk exposure level,
1000 random draws from the uniform distribution of the inter-
val between 110 and 115 mm Hg were taken; unertainty in the
theoretical minimum-risk exposure level was propagated by
sampling between the 110- and 115-mm Hg interval each time
the population-attributable burden was calculated.

described in this equation. The log-normal function, rather
than normal,44 β, or γ distributions, gave the best fit of the dis-
tribution of SBP in multiple health examination surveys such
as the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, and
Indonesia Family Life Survey.
Burden Related to SBP
Deaths and DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg
were computed by multiplying an age-, sex-, country-, year-,
and cause-specific PAF by the estimated deaths or DALYs for
the same strata. Total (all-causes) burden related to SBP of at
least 110 to 115 mm Hg was calculated by the following:
All-cause−associated burdenasct =�
w
o = 1DALYoasct PAF
oasct.
Hypertensive heart disease and hypertensive chronic kidney
disease were treated as conditions that would not have oc-
curred without elevated systolic blood pressure, and all dis-
ease burden for these causes was attributed to this risk fac-
tor. The PAFs and related deaths and DALYs for each 1-mm Hg
increment of SBP were evaluated to provide the distribution
of health burden across the range of possible SBP levels.
Uncertainty Intervals
We computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all esti-
mates of deaths and DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to
115 mm Hg. A Monte Carlo simulation approach was used
to propagate uncertainty from all sources in the final burden
estimations. These intervals incorporated sampling uncer-
tainty in the examination surveys, parameter estimation in the
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model for blood
pressure mean, the RRs for each outcome from the analysis of
pooled cohort studies, the theoretical minimum-risk expo-
sure level, and the deaths and DALYs estimated for each age,
sex, country, year, and cause. The 1000 draws of the poste-
rior distribution of mean SBP and outcomes by country, age,
and sex were calculated independently so the variance of
estimation for the aggregate groups (eg, all-age, both sexes,
or global burden) were more likely to be underestimated be-
cause of possible covariance between different risk levels and
outcome, countries, or sexes. Despite efforts to incorporate all
sources of uncertainty, uncertainties from some intermedi-
ate predictive steps were not propagated due to existing data
and methodological constraints. Therefore, the UIs pre-
sented may be optimistic estimates. Analyses and computa-
tions were completed using Stata version 13.1, R version 3.1.2,
and Python version 2.7.11.
Results
Global
In total, 844 studies from 154 countries (N=8.69 million indi-
vidual participants) published from 1980 to 2015 were in-
cluded in GBD 2015.10 Between 1990 and 2015, the rate of SBP
of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 73 119 (95% UI,
67 949-78 241) to 81 373 (95% UI, 76 814-85 770) per 100 000;
the rate of SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17 307
(95% UI, 17 117-17 492) to 20 526 (95% UI, 20 283-20 746) per
100 000. The associated estimated annual deaths for SBP of
at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and of 140 mm Hg or higher in-
creased from 135.6 deaths (95% UI, 122.4-148.1) to 145.2 deaths
(95% UI 130.3-159.9) per 100 000 and from 97.9 deaths (95%
UI,87.5-108.1)to106.3deaths(95%UI,94.6-118.1)per100 000.
Table 1 shows the projected number of individuals,
deaths, and DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg
and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher for 6 time points between
1990 and 2015. The projected number of individuals with
SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 1.87 billion
(95% UI, 1.74-2.0 billion) in 1990 to 3.47 billion (95% UI, 3.27-
3.65 billion) in 2015, and the associated annual number of
projected deaths increased from 7.2 million (95% UI, 6.5-7.9
million) in 1990 to 10.7 million (95% UI, 9.6-11.8 million) in
2015, a 1.6% increase per year (Table 1). Projected DALYs
related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from
148 million (95% UI, 134-162 million) in 1990 to 211 million
(95% UI 193-231 million) in 2015. The projected number of
individuals with SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from
442 million (95% UI, 437-447 million) in 1990 to 874 million
(95% UI, 864-884 million) in 2015, and the associated annual
number of projected deaths in 2015 (7.8 million [95% UI, 7.0-
8.7 million]) or 14.0% of total deaths (95% UI, 12.5%-15.5%)
and 143 million DALYs (95% UI, 130.2-157.0 million) were
related to SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.
Similar to DALYs, age-standardized death rates associ-
ated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg declined from 225
(95% UI, 200-247) per 100 000 to 170 (95% UI, 151-188) per
100 000 (eTable 4 in the Supplement), which suggests popu-
lation growth and aging may have been the main driver of the
observed increase in total projected DALYs related to SBP of at
least 110 to 115 mm Hg since 1990 (Table 1). Age-standardized
rate per capita (an adjusted measure for population size and
age structure) of deaths and DALYs related to SBP of at least
110to115mmHgdecreaseddespiteincreasedaverageSBP.The
downward change in the age-standardized rate of deaths was
0.92%(95%UI,0.80%-1.03%)peryearformenand1.37%(95%
UI, 1.26%-1.50%) per year for women (eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). Age-standardized DALYs per capita decreased from
4.1 (95% UI, 3.7-4.5) per 100 persons in 1990 to 3.2 (95% UI,
2.9-3.4) per 100 persons in 2015 (see data reported as per
100 000 individuals in eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Figure 1 shows 2 views of global trends for individuals with
SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher. Panel A shows that the rate of high
SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17 307 (95% UI,
17 116.9-17 492) per 100 000 in 1990 to 20 525 (95% UI, 20 283-
20 746) per 100 000 in 2015. Although the rate initially de-
creased between 1990 and 1995, the initial trend was fol-
lowed by an increase to 2015. Panel B shows that after
controlling for changes in population aging, the age-
standardized rate increased after 2000 (eFigure 2 and eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement).

other 26% of DALYs occurred in individuals with SBP be-
tween 140 and 150 mm Hg, and the remaining 45% of DALYs

levels of SBP, ischemic heart disease was the most important

stroke and then ischemic stroke.

specific outcome and the PAFs for those outcomes in 2015 are
shown in Table 2. Forty-one percent (95% UI, 35.9%-45.4%)
of deaths related to SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher were related
to CVDs (and the rest through chronic kidney disease), among
which 40.1% (95% UI, 32.2%-48.1%) were related to ischemic
heart disease, 40.4% (95% UI, 34.5%-46.4%) to cerebrovas-
culardiseases(38.1%[95%UI,29.9%-46.7%]toischemicstroke
and 42.5% [95% UI, 34.2%-50.8%] to hemorrhagic stroke)
(death PAFs for SBP ≥140 mm Hg; Table 2). SBP of at least 110
to 115 mm Hg was associated with all hypertensive heart dis-
ease deaths, 68.7% (95% UI, 63.7%-73.5%) of chronic kidney
disease deaths, 54.4% (95% UI, 46.8%-62.4%) of cerebrovas-
cular disease deaths (50.0% [95% UI, 39.4.0%-60.8%] of is-
chemic stroke and 58.3% [95% UI, 48.0%-68.5%] of hemor-
rhagic stroke deaths), and 54.5% (95% UI, 44.4%-64.2%) of
ischemic heart disease deaths (Table 2). Overall, SBP of
140 mm Hg or higher was associated with 73.2% (95% UI,

aged 25 to 29 years, 30% of CVD burden is in those with SBP
of 140 mm Hg or higher.
Regional and Country Results
Figure 3 shows age-standardized DALY rates associated with
SBPofatleast110to115mmHgfor21GBDregionsandbycause.
Regions were ordered by life expectancy. Age-standardized
DALY rates varied substantially—from 1025.66 (95% UI, 916.51-
1136.97)intheAsia-Pacifichigh-incomeregionto7022.18(95%
UI, 5259.73-9652.2) in Oceania. The variation in 2015 for SBP
of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg was greater across countries rang-
ing from 923 DALYs (95% UI, 794-1046) per 100 000 in
Switzerland to 13 639 (95% UI, 10 696-17 151) per 100 000 in
Afghanistan (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Age-standardized
DALYs associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg were
highest in Oceania, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Central
sub-Saharan Africa. Relative to life expectancy, the burden of
SBP was comparatively high in East Asia and Central Europe
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). The relative contributions of dif-
ferent outcomes to the global age-standardized DALY rate as-
sociated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg varied by re-
gion. In sub-Saharan Africa, cerebrovascular diseases
predominated, while in Oceania, Central Asia, and Eastern
Europe, ischemic heart disease predominated.
Table 4 and Table 5 provide deaths and DALYs associated
with SBP 110 to 115 mm Hg and of 140 mm Hg or higher for all
ages and both sexes combined, by region, and for the 25 most
populous countries in the world from 1990 to 2015. The last
column in Table 4 and Table 5 lists the number of individuals
measured for each country for all included data sources.
Estimates for all countries can be found in eTables 2, 3, and 4
in the Supplement. The highest age-standardized death rate
was estimated for Afghanistan with 637 deaths (95% UI, 511-
579) per 100 000, Vanuatu with 420 (95% UI, 309-584) per
100 000,andIraqwith415(95%UI,336-506)per100 000.The
lowest age-standardized rates of SBP-related deaths were in
Andorra with 61 (95% UI, 51-71) per 100 000, France with 62
(95% UI, 54-72) per 100 000, and Canada with 64 (95% UI,
53-75) per 100 000. The age-standardized mortality rate for
women was 145 (95% UI, 129-162) per 100 000 vs 197 (95% UI,
176-217) per 100 000 for men (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Of the global burden of 212 million DALYs related to SBP
of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg, 60% occurred in 10 countries,
with the majority of DALYs in China with 45.1 million and in
India with 38.7 million (Figure 4). Age-standardized DALYs
from SBP decreased globally, but the trend varied between
countries. Although age-standardized DALYs per capita asso-
ciated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg decreased
between 1990 and 2015 in South Korea by 77.2% (95% UI,
75.6%-78.8%) and in the the United Kingdom by 65.6%
(95% UI, 64.1%-67.1%), a significant increase of 18.9% (95%
UI, 1.6%-41.4%) was observed in Bangladesh. Countries in
sub-Saharan Africa (except Southern sub-Saharan Africa),

South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Latin
America generally increased in age-standardized DALYs per
capita associated with SBPs of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg. In
China, the total burden of SBP has increased since 1990, and
SBP levels increased after 1995 but were offset by decreases
in mortality until 2005, at which point the overall age-
standardized burden started increasing.
Discussion
Inthisstudy,weusedanexpandedsetofbloodpressurepreva-
lence surveys to assess, for the first time to our knowledge, the
full distribution of the population by level of SBP and the bur-
den of mortality and DALYs associated with each level of SBP
for 195 countries and territories. This study showed that SBP
of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg was associated with more than
10 million deaths (95% UI, 9.6-11.8 million) and more than
212 million DALYs (95% UI, 193-231 million) in 2015, a 1.4-fold
increase since 1990. Compared with all other specific risks
quantified in the GBD, SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg was the
leadingglobalcontributortopreventabledeathin2015.10These
estimates are concerning given that in 2015, an estimated
3.5 billion individuals had an SBP level of at least 110 to
115 mm Hg.
This analysis, the first to be performed at a comprehen-
sive global scale, found considerable variation among the 195
countries and territories and 21 regions studied. Five coun-
tries accounted for more than half of global DALYs associated
with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg: China, India, Russia,
Indonesia, and the United States. Both the projected number
andprevalencerateofSBPofatleast110to115mmHgarelikely
to continue to increase globally. These findings support in-
creased efforts to control the burden of SBP of at least 110 to
115 mm Hg to reduce disease burden.
In this study, ischemic heart disease and stroke ac-
counted for the majority of health loss (DALYs, which include
deaths and nonfatal burden) related to SBP of at least 110 to
115 mm Hg. Although the majority of the burden associated
with SBP occurred in persons with hypertension (SBP
≥140 mm Hg), nearly 30% occurred in individuals with an SBP
between 115 and 140 mm Hg. A broad range of other condi-
tions contributed to health loss associated with SBP of at least
110 to 115 mm Hg, with chronic kidney disease notable for con-
tributing almost as many DALYs globally in 2015 as hyperten-
sive heart disease.
There have been claims that the burden of SBP of at least
110 to 115 mm Hg is an increasing problem globally.4,5,8,45
The finding that the total projected number of individuals with
SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher is increasing globally supports
those claims. Although the drivers of trends in hypertension
were not quantified in this study, other research has docu-
mented that dietary salt intake, fruit and vegetable consump-
tion, overweight and obesity, and physical activity have also
changed substantially over the same time period.10 Among
these factors at the global scale, the prevalence of obesity and

overweight in particular increased substantially over the pe-
riod 1990 to 2015.20
With population growth and aging and the fact that SBP
levels increase with age, the number of persons with hyper-
tension and related adverse health outcomes are expected to
increase in the world. Despite the increase in global SBP lev-
els in terms of numbers (per individual with SBP ≥140 mm Hg),
rates, and age-standardized rates of SBP of 140 mm Hg or
higher, deaths and DALYs associated with SBP of at least 110
to 115 mm Hg and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher have de-
creased. The difference in trends between exposure to SBP of
at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and the rates of related outcomes is
likely related to background trends downward in global age-
specific cardiovascular death rates. Previous studies have at-
tributed those declines in CVD death rates to changes in risk
factors such as tobacco as well as improved access to
treatment.46-48 Although declines in elevated blood pressure
may have contributed to CVD declines in some high-income
countries such as Japan, globally, the downward trend in hy-
pertension is not a driver of CVD rate reductions.49 Yet SBP of
at least 110 to 115 mm Hg remains one of the larger risks for de-
creased human health, greater than tobacco or high body mass
index, for which SBP probably mediates a portion of the risk.9
Prevention and control of high blood pressure through a com-
bination of behavioral, lifestyle, and drug treatment strate-
gies as a health system priority could mitigate the growing bur-
den associated with high SBP.
The results of the current study are informed by, but do
not help to resolve, the significant debate about appropriate
clinical use and targets for blood pressure–lowering medica-
tions. Meta-analyses performed by Law et al and Ettehad et al
showed cardiovascular mortality benefits for a target SBP as
low as 120 mm Hg.31,32 SPRINT showed significant mortality
benefits among individuals in the United States with el-
evated cardiovascular risk, 90% of whom were already receiv-
ing prior treatment with blood pressure–lowering medica-
tion, when they received intensive blood pressure reduction
therapy and achieved an average SBP below 120 mm Hg.38 The
HOPE-3 trial did not observe this same benefit when less in-
tensive blood pressure reduction was achieved. However, un-
like the SPRINT trial, the population enrolled in HOPE-3 had
an initial mean SBP of 138 mm Hg (and only 22% were receiv-
ing prior treatment with blood pressure–lowering medica-
tions), more tobacco smokers, and more women. In a prespeci-
fied analysis, HOPE-3 found benefit only among those whose
SBP remained above 143 mm Hg.
These results support the model assumption that el-
evated SBP is a modifiable risk factor for mortality even though
the precise subpopulation and SBP target for blood pressure–
lowering medications remains less clear. The purpose of this

Reported data include both sexes
combined and individuals aged 25
years and older. Data are reported for
the 3 most populous countries
(United States, China, and India) to
highlight burden at the highest
population levels and utility of
country-specific results. Data for
other countries and regions are
presented on a regional scale using
super regions from the Global Burden
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
study 2015 (the regions that contain
the United States, China, and India
were excluded to prevent double
representation of the following
results: high income, South Asia,
Southeast Asia, East Asia, and
Oceania) and have presented the
remainder of countries from those
super regions as an additional group.

study was to estimate the full extent of health burden lost re-
lated to elevated SBP and not to determine the optimum SBP
level for the current population. This estimation is an essen-
tial step in understanding the contribution of SBP as a risk fac-
tor for global health loss. Quantification of the modifiable
health loss due to SBP, given scale-up of the technologies cur-
rently available for SBP lowering, would require an alternate
estimation strategy than used for this study. However in 2015,
7.8 million deaths and 143 million DALYs were estimated to be
related to SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher, suggesting that large
health gains from expanded treatment with blood pressure–
lowering medications are possible. It is likely that more evi-
dence will be needed to define the role of pharmacotherapy
in reducing the burden associated with SBP of at least
110 mm Hg and less than an SBP of 140 mm Hg.
This study has important limitations. First, the burden of
high diastolic blood pressure, including cases of isolated high
diastolicbloodpressure,wasnotincluded.Second,burdenwas
only associated with SBP for individuals aged 25 years and
older, except for hypertensive heart disease, which included
all ages. Third, estimates of population mean SBP were based
on 814 studies in 154 countries. For 41 countries with no ex-
amination survey data, estimates of blood pressure levels were
based on spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression statis-
tical models; there is a need for population-based health sur-
veys in these countries as well as broader implementation of
surveys that track access to treatment. Fourth, measured stan-
dard deviations of blood pressure were converted to nar-
rower ranges of usual blood pressure using a single correc-
tion factor based on cohort studies in 5 countries.10 The
conversion from measurements taken at a given point in
time to usual blood pressure were based on an intertemporal
variation in SBP for each individual. This intertemporal varia-
tion may well vary across countries. Moreover, uncertainty
in this correction was not captured in this study. Fifth, the rela-
tive risk of each 10-mm increment of SBP was assumed to be
the same from 115 mm Hg to SBP above 200 mm Hg. The meta-
analyses by Lv et al and by Law et al of all blood pressure–
lowering trials support this assumption; showing that there
was no statistically different RR as a function of starting level
of SBP.31,50 Sixth, the RRs for each outcome were assumed
to be generalizable across populations. Higher RRs have been
reported for 6 countries in the East Asia, high-income
AsiaPacific,andAustralasiaregionsincludingChina(andHong
Kong), Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and
Taiwan.35,51,52 Other studies found RRs varied by race.7,53,54
Large cohort pooling studies are required to establish statis-
tically significant location- and time-specific RRs. While ac-
knowledging these limitations, this study was based on the
largest available set of data and applied the same methods to
previous years to provide a consistent analysis of time trends
from 1990 to 2015.
Conclusions
In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some
estimates, the prevalence of elevated SBP (≥110-115 and
≥140 mm Hg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015,
with a corresponding increase in DALYs and deaths associ-
ated with elevated SBP. Projections based on this sample sug-
gest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at
least 110 to 115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of
140 mm Hg or higher.
