 POINT OF VIEW
The NIH must reduce
disparities in funding to
maximize its return on
investments from taxpayers
Abstract New data from the NIH reveal that the scientific return on its sponsored research reaches a maximum at
around $400,000 of annual support per principal investigator. We discuss the implications of this ’sweet spot’ for
funding policy, and propose that the NIH should limit both the minimum and maximum amount of funding per
researcher.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the fed-
eral
steward
of
biomedical
research
in
the
United States. The NIH must ensure that scien-
tists at-large are allowed to compete on equal
footing for grant support, and it is obligated to
allocate research dollars in a way that maximizes
the
returns
on
taxpayers’
investments.
Two
recent
studies
from
within
the
NIH
(Basson et al., 2016; Lauer et al., 2017) reveal
with precision the perils of not doing so—and
provide equally precise guidance for evidence-
based changes in funding policy.
Systemic disparities in funding
Principal investigators at-large do not have equal
access to federal grant funding for scientific
research and this chronic problem has long been
recognized
by
federal
funding
agencies
(National Academies, 2013). There are dispar-
ities in grant application success rates or award
sizes or both for investigators grouped by race
(Ginther et al., 2011), gender (Pohlhaus et al.,
2011; Magua et al., 2017), age (Levitt and Lev-
itt, 2017), institution (Murray et al., 2016) and
state (Wahls, 2016a). To the extent tested these
disparities persist even after controlling for other
factors, suggesting that implicit (subconscious)
biases and social prestige mechanisms (e.g., the
Matthew effect) can affect allocations of funding.
However, we do not need to define the various
potential sources of bias, or even accept that
there might be any bias at all in funding deci-
sions, to understand that the unbalanced alloca-
tions
of
funding
are
detrimental
to
the
biomedical research enterprise in the US.
Differences in grant application success rates
and award sizes (whose impacts on allocations
of
funding
are
multiplicative)
contribute
to
heavily skewed distributions of funding that
favor a small minority of scientists and disfavor
the vast majority (Figure 1). Just 1% of NIH-
funded investigators get 11% of research project
grant dollars and 40% of the money goes to
10% of funded investigators (Collins, 2017a;
amounts of funding include administrative sup-
plements, if any). The distributions are even
more heavily skewed at the level of institutions
and states. While the NIH gives half of all
research project grant dollars to about 19% of
funded investigators, half the money goes to
just 2% of funded organizations and 10% of
states (Figure 1). These values underrepresent
the true magnitude of disparity because many

 Figure 1. Heavily skewed distributions of NIH grant funding favor a minority and disfavor the majority. A search
of the NIH RePORTER database identified 25,674 investigators who received research project grant funding in
FY2015. These individuals were ranked in descending order by the amount of funding they received, and then
grouped into 52 bins, each of which contained 493 investigators (the remaining, lowest-funded 38 investigators
were not binned). The same process was applied for amounts of funding to 2,038 organizations (39 per bin) and to
52 states, including Washington DC and Puerto Rico (1 per bin). Pareto plots display amounts of funding
(histograms, left Y axis) to each bin. For example, the first bin of investigators got more than twice as many dollars
as the second bin. Cumulative curves (right Y axis) display fraction of total funding to a given bin and all higher-
funded bins (i.e., those to its left). Inset text (italics) in the top panel show the mean amount of funding (in $
millions, M) per investigator for select bins. The amount of funding per investigator that yields maximum
productivity (the ’sweet spot’ from Figure 2) is almost exactly the median amount of funding per investigator. The
proposed lower and upper limits for support per awardee ($0.2M and $0.8M) would free up enough money to

Point of View
The NIH must reduce disparities in funding to maximize its return on investments from taxpayers
 meritorious scientists who apply for support go
unfunded.
Such “funding inequality has been rising since
1985, with a small segment of investigators and
institutes getting an increasing proportion of
funds, and investigators who start in the top
funding ranks tend to stay there (which results in
stasis, or lack of mobility)” (Katz and Matter,
2017). Elsewhere in the ranks, increasing hyper-
competition for the limited resources places the
majority of awardees at risk of laboratory closure
when
they
lose
their
sole
NIH
grant
(Peifer,
2017a).
The
hyper-competition
also
serves as an effective barrier for the recruitment
of young investigators into the biomedical work-
force, causing many highly talented trainees and
early career scientists to redirect their career
paths away from working on the underlying biol-
ogy, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases
(Carr,
2013).
Consequently,
thought-leaders
and organizations such as the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology
have advocated for a more equitable distribu-
tion of funding to help sustain the biomedical
research
enterprise
(Alberts
et
al.,
2014;
Lorsch, 2015; FASEB, 2015). There are compel-
ling reasons for such changes in funding policy.
Double-edged sword of disparity
At population scale, the underfunding and non-
funding of some groups of scientists (the major-
ity) compromises their ability to contribute effec-
tively to the missions of the NIH. It has been
posited that a more balanced distribution of
resources among investigators—geared towards
harnessing the greatest possible number of per-
spectives,
creative
ideas
and
experimental
approaches—would strengthen the diversity of
the research ecosystem, increase the likelihood
of scientific breakthroughs, and lead to a greater
return on taxpayers’ investments (Lorsch, 2015).
However,
we
must
consider
the
alternative
hypothesis.
Is
it
possible
that
the
negative
impacts of underfunding the majority of investi-
gators are offset by positive impacts of over-
funding the minority?
In his 1985 commentary in Cell, Bruce Alberts
pointed out that individual investigators each
have a finite capacity to carry out grant-related
duties and that their productivity falls when their

Figure 2. Productivity peaks at about $400,000 per investigator and declines with lower and higher amounts of funding. Each plot shows the
marginal return (Y axis) as a function of annual NIH research project grant funding (total costs) per investigator (X axis); note that both axes are
logarithmic, and that the range of the Y-axis varies from plot to plot. The marginal return for each amount of funding corresponds to the first derivative
of the Cobb-Douglas production function, using relative citation ratios (RCRs) as the measure of production (Mongeon et al., 2016; Lauer et al.,
2017). The RCR is a measure of article influence, developed by the NIH, that normalizes the number of citations received by a publication for the field
of study and the time of publication (Hutchins et al., 2016). The three plots show the marginal return based on the maximum RCR (A), median RCR (B)
and annual weighted RCR (C). The vertical dashed lines correspond to funding values of $250,000, $1 million and $2 million per investigator.

Point of View
The NIH must reduce disparities in funding to maximize its return on investments from taxpayers
 amounts of funding exceed those capacity limits:
consequently, highly funded laboratories are
generally “less productive” and represent a
“poor training environment” relative to more-
modestly
funded
laboratories.
Alberts
advo-
cated for capping the total amount of funding
that each investigator can receive, explaining
how this would reduce waste and would permit
the
funding
of
more
investigators,
thereby
increasing the diversity and net productivity of
the research enterprise (Alberts, 1985).
About three decades later, that prescient
insight was validated by a series of empirical
studies which showed that scientific output, as
measured in multiple ways, does not scale uni-
formly with amounts of funding and that there
are diminishing marginal (incremental) returns on
investments
in
research
(see,
for
example,
Mongeon et al., 2016 and references therein).
These diminishing marginal returns apply for the
heavily
skewed
allocations
of
NIH
funding
among individual grants (Lauer, 2016a), investi-
gators
(Lauer
et
al.,
2017),
institutions
(Wahls,
2016)
and
quartiles
of
states
(Wahls,
2016a).
Giving
a
disproportionately
large share of grant funding to a minority of
investigators, institutions and states is counter-
productive—whether or not the imbalances are
driven by bias.
Maiden voyage of policy meets
iceberg
Big ships turn slowly, but they can turn. In
response to the plethora of data from groups
within and outside of the NIH, in May 2017 the
NIH director Francis Collins announced a new
policy
to
cap
funding
per
investigator
(Collins, 2017a). This was a modest plan that
would have capped the number of research
awards (three R01 grant equivalents), not dol-
lars, per investigator. The majority of very well-
funded investigators would have been protected
from the caps because only about one in five of
the investigators with more than a million dollars
of NIH research project grant funding per year
has more than three such grants (Wahls, 2017).
Nevertheless, according to Collins, the new pol-
icy would have freed up enough funds for about
1,600 new awards to help early and mid-career
researchers who just miss the pay line for fund-
ing (Collins, 2017a). The “about 1,600 new
awards” might seem like an impressive number,
but it is actually a trivial increase given that the
NIH supports almost 50,000 competitive grants
to researchers.
One month later, in a stunning about-face
that ignored the unanimity of conclusions from
studies conducted within and outside of the
NIH, the NIH cancelled the incipient policy on
funding caps (Collins, 2017b). It was replaced
by a plan (the Next Generation Researchers Ini-
tiative, or NGRI) that is predicted to, over five
years, support up to 2,000 additional investiga-
tors (Collins, 2017b). The NGRI plan has no pro-
visions to address the inefficient utilization of
research dollars caused by the focused concen-
trations of funding at any of the levels described
above.
Sweet spot for funding; high cost
of disparity
To what extent do the heavily skewed alloca-
tions of NIH research project grant funding
affect the returns on taxpayers’ investments? Is
there a specific amount of funding per investiga-
tor that yields optimal returns? Two recent stud-
ies
conducted
within
the
NIH
provided
important insight by measuring marginal returns
(i.e., the incremental amount of productivity that
is generated by each additional dollar of fund-
ing) for investigators with different amounts of
NIH funding. One study used direct costs, the
other used total costs. For those unfamiliar with
the difference, each dollar of direct costs corre-
sponds to about $1.50 of total costs (direct costs
plus indirect costs). Although indirect cost rates
vary between institutions, both direct costs and
indirect costs go to support the research of a
given project, so total costs provide the most
appropriate parameter when it comes to mea-
suring returns on taxpayers’ investments.
While there is no ideal, single way to measure
scientific output and each metric has its caveats,
the two NIH studies used broadly accepted
measures. These are scientific publications and
time-normalized citation impact factors per unit
of funding. The latter metric encompasses the
influence of the publications, as measured by
how frequently other scientists cite the pub-
lished work in their own articles, taking into
account that article-level citation impact factors
follow
a
log-normal
distribution
(see
Hutchins et al., 2016 and references therein).
Importantly,
the
various
productivity
metrics
used in these studies (and others) support similar
conclusions.
One study reported that scientific output for
investigators funded by the NIH’s National Insti-
tute
of
General
Medical
Sciences
(NIGMS),

The NIH must reduce disparities in funding to maximize its return on investments from taxpayers
 publications and citation rates, tapers off above
$300,000 of annual direct costs and diminishes
further thereafter, “with only small discontinuous
increase above $500,000” (Basson et al., 2016).
The impacts of these differences are staggering.
Funding for a first R01 grant ($200,000 annual
direct costs) to an investigator produces, on
average, about five publications during the fund-
ing period, whereas the same amount of funding
for a third R01 grant yields only about one addi-
tional publication (Lorsch, 2015). At least at
population scale, about 80% of the dollars allo-
cated for each third grant to an investigator are
not being used productively, relative to what
could be realized by giving that grant to an
unfunded investigator (of which there are many,
given that about three quarters of applicants are
denied funding each year; Rockey, 2014).
The second study extended the analyses to
include all NIH-funded investigators and came
to essentially identical conclusions (Lauer et al.,
2017). Optimal rates of output, based on time-
normalized, field-normalized citation impact fac-
tors, occur at about $400,000 of total costs per
investigator (the sweet spot for funding; Fig-
ure 2). That sweet spot coincides almost exactly
with median funding per investigator (Figure 1).
However, there are diminishing marginal returns
for amounts of funding above and below that
sweet
spot.
For
example,
the
incremental
returns for each dollar of funding at $800,000
(twice the optimal level) and at $200,000 (half
the optimal level) are about 25% to 40% of the
returns at the sweet spot (Figure 2). Thus the
majority of the dollars allocated outside of this
range are not being used effectively, relative to
what could be realized by funding investigators
at the sweet spot. Notably, the diminishing mar-
ginal returns persist even when award data are
parsed by NIH institute, for “elite” investigators,
and by human versus non-human model systems
(Lauer et al., 2017).
NIH should limit minimum and
maximum funding per investigator
The findings from both of the recent NIH stud-
ies, and many others, further support the calls
from thousands of concerned individuals (includ-
ing an online petition: Peifer, 2017c) for the
NIH to reinstate or otherwise impose an upper
limit on funding per investigator. Caps based on
the number of grants per investigator would be
ineffective at addressing the unbalanced alloca-
tions of funding because, under a three-grant
cap (Collins, 2017a), about 80% of investigators
with more than a million dollars of support per
year would be protected from any reductions in
funding (Wahls, 2017). There would be little
impact on the heavily skewed allocations of
funding and, correspondingly, upon the dimin-
ishing marginal returns. Even a more stringent,
two-grant cap would have no effect on amounts
of support to about half of NIH’s millionaires.
Therefore, the caps should be based on dollars
and should be applied uniformly to all awardees
with very few or no exceptions (Alberts, 1985).
Dollar-based funding caps would be effective.
For example, a cap of one million dollars (total
costs) of annual NIH research project grant fund-
ing per investigator—which is an extremely gen-
erous amount of support that is far beyond the
point at which diminishing marginal returns kick
in (see Figure 2)—would reduce inefficiencies at
the top end of the funding distribution and
would free up enough money to support about
10,000 additional investigators (Wahls, 2017).
This would be far more effective at expanding
the investigator pool and at rescuing early to
mid-career investigators than the new NGRI pro-
gram, which will not address differences in pro-
ductivity per dollar of funding and is expected
to fund only about 2,000 additional awards over
the next five years (without any clear indication
of award sizes or where the dollars will come
from; Collins, 2017b).
Notably, investigators with amounts of NIH
funding below the sweet spot also have sub-
optimal productivity (Figure 2; Lauer et al.,
2017), presumably because they lack the critical
mass (e.g., number of grant-supported person-
nel) to sustain high productivity. The double-
edged sword of disparities in allocations of fund-
ing is sharp on both edges, each of which cuts
the efficiency with which precious research dol-
lars are being expended.
Giving a disproportionately large
share of grant funding to a minority
of investigators, institutions and
states is counterproductive—
whether or not the imbalances are
driven by bias.

Point of View
The NIH must reduce disparities in funding to maximize its return on investments from taxpayers
 I therefore call on the NIH to establish both a
lower limit and an upper limit for the amount of
NIH research project grant funding per awardee
each year. I posit, based on available data (such
as Figure 2) and as a point for discussion, that a
lower limit of $200,000 and an upper limit of
$800,000 total costs would be
appropriate.
Within this range, median funding per investiga-
tor would still be close to the productivity sweet
spot of $400,000 (Figure 1). The flanking limits
would increase returns on taxpayers’ invest-
ments by curbing inefficiencies at the low and
high ends of the funding distribution, while still
affording considerable flexibility in amounts of
support to each investigator. The large (four-
fold) range in allowed funding would accommo-
date the fact that some types of research are
more expensive than others. Moreover, these
specific limits would free up enough money to
support more than 10,000 additional investiga-
tors, each funded at (or with mean funding at)
the productivity sweet spot of $400,000. Here’s
why:
Based
on
FY2015
values
from
NIH
RePORTER, 5,038 research project grant recipi-
ents (which is 20% of the total number of grant
recipients)
each
got
more
than
$800,000.
Together they received about $8.39 billion, so
limiting each to $800,000 would free up about
$4.36 billion. There were 2,302 investigators (9%
of the total) with funding between $10,000 and
$199,999. Together those awardees got $0.32
billion, so bringing each of them up to the
$200,000 minimum would cost about $0.14 bil-
lion. Thus the minimum and maximum funding
limits would free up about $4.22 billion, which is
enough to award $400,000 to each of 10,542
additional
investigators
who
do
not
have
funding.
Harnessing additional talent and
its limitations
To what extent would supporting about 10,500
additional
investigators
expand
the
funded
workforce? Is there an existing capacity to sup-
port such changes? Would the NIH still be fund-
ing only meritorious research projects? These
and related questions can be answered by com-
paring calculated impacts of the proposed fund-
ing limits to available data.
When measured over five-year periods end-
ing in 2003 and 2015, the number of NIH
research
project
grant
applicants
rose
from
about 60,000 to slightly less than 90,000, but
the number of awardees held steady at about
27,500 (Lauer, 2016b). Over the same time
frame (2003 to 2015), the value of the NIH bud-
get not only failed to keep pace with the
expanding US population in general, and the
expanding scientific workforce in particular, it
actually lost 22% of its purchasing power due to
budget
cuts,
sequestration
and
inflation
(FASEB, 2017). For these reasons, grant applica-
tion success rates and investigator funding rates
have fallen fairly steadily over time.
Each year only about one quarter of appli-
cants, including those who submit multiple pro-
posals, get funded (Rockey, 2014). Similarly,
less than one third of applicants secure any
research project grant funding over a five-year
period (up to 2015); about 60,000 applicants do
not
get
any
of
their
applications
funded
(Lauer, 2016b). Therefore, the unutilized capac-
ity of the biomedical workforce (as measured by
unfunded applicants) is large enough to sustain
an additional 10,500 awardees, which would
increase the pool of funded investigators by
about
38%.
Competition
for
funding
would
remain fierce, the additional awards would go
only to meritorious investigators whose applica-
tions receive high priority scores from scientific
peer review, and the majority of applicants
would remain unfunded.
It thus seems clear that while dollar-based
funding limits would be quite effective at har-
nessing additional talent, in isolation they would
be insufficient to address the problem of too
many
investigators
competing
for
too
few
research
dollars.
Additional
steps,
such
as
restoring
the
NIH
budget
to
its
inflation-
adjusted 2003 levels or even higher (to account
for population expansion), would be required to
ensure
that
biomedical
research
in
the
US
remains competitive on the international stage.
Meanwhile, concerned scientists are discussing
ideas and principles, and agency officials are
exploring additional mechanisms, to support a
robust research ecosystem in the face of finite
resources (see, for example, Levitt and Levitt,
2017;
Alberts et al., 2014; Lorsch, 2015;
FASEB, 2015; Pickett et al., 2015; Blume-
Kohout and Adhikari, 2016; Schaller et al.,
2017;
Heggeness
et
al.,
2017;
Plank-
Bazinet et al., 2017). A good example is the
Maximizing
Investigators’
Research
Award
(MIRA) program, a NIGMS program to “fund
people, not projects” (NIGMS, 2017). The MIRA
program seeks to increase the efficiency of fund-
ing by providing investigators with greater sta-
bility and flexibility while distributing funding
more widely among investigators. To participate

Point of View
The NIH must reduce disparities in funding to maximize its return on investments from taxpayers
 in this program, MIRA awardees must agree to
accept the MIRA grant as their sole source of
NIGMS research funding. The MIRA program,
coupled with clearly defined limits on dollars of
support per investigator, could serve as a para-
digm for all NIH research project grant funding.
Use data, not power of affluence,
to guide policy
Sustaining the competitiveness of biomedical
research in the US, and the benefits it brings to
US citizens, can only be maintained through ade-
quate appropriations for the NIH budget. Con-
gress began restoring the NIH budget in FY2016
(FASEB, 2017) and all of us should encourage
them to keep doing so. We should also help to
ensure that the investments are utilized as effi-
ciently as possible. To do this we must be critical
(in a positive, analytical sense) of extant funding
mechanisms, incipient programs and proposed
changes to funding policy, including those put
forth in this article. I therefore propose an over-
arching, guiding principle: Policies aimed at sus-
taining the biomedical research enterprise and
for maximizing the efficiency with which research
dollars are expended will be most effective only
if they address adequately the vast disparities in
funding among investigators, institutions and
states.
Understandably,
individuals
who
benefit
directly or indirectly from unbalanced, heavily
skewed allocations of funding (Figure 1) will
campaign to preserve the status quo. Moreover,
as a general rule in societies, affluence confers
political power. The NIH’s rapid cancellation of
its incipient, evidence-based, modest plan to
cap
funding
per
investigator—seemingly
in
response to “a concerted effort by a few very
well-funded and powerful scientists threatened
by this new approach, combined with a failure of
the rest of us to vocally support the underlying
idea. . .” (Peifer, 2017b)—is an excellent case in
point. The “rest of us” who assumed that the
policy would be implemented had no compel-
ling reason to voice our opinions at the time of
its announcement, speaking up en masse (see,
for example, Peifer, 2017c) only once the incipi-
ent policy was, unexpectedly, cancelled. Impor-
tantly, there is no scientific basis for the NIH to
capitulate to the wishes of the affluent minority.
A plethora of data from within and outside of
the NIH document unambiguously the perils of
giving the majority of funding to a minority of
investigators—and
those
data
provide
benchmarks for remediation through changes in
funding policy.
Empirical imperatives
Strong disparities in allocations of federal fund-
ing for scientific research, such as those shown
in
Figure
1,
are
deleterious
because
they
degrade the diversity and productivity of the
research enterprise. While the etiology of this
problem might be complex, there is a straight-
forward, effective mechanism that can provide
substantial
remediation
for
many
of
its
consequences:
.
To address the inefficiencies caused by
heavily skewed allocations of funding;
.
To distribute grants and grant dollars
more equitably among investigators, insti-
tutions and states;
.
To rescue talented early and mid-career
researchers who just miss out on funding;
.
To provide a more reliable stream of sup-
port for the approximately 70% of investi-
gators whose laboratories subsist on a
single grant;
.
To harness the creative ideas of additional,
meritorious investigators at all levels who
are
victims
of
abysmal
funding
rates
(untapped talent and capacity);
.
And to maximize the returns on taxpayers’
investments—
The NIH must cap the number of research
project grant dollars that each investigator can
receive and it should also consider establishing a
minimum amount of support per awardee.
