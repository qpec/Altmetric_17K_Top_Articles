BACKGROUND
Pharmacologic inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
The effect of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inhibiting 
PCSK9 on the risk of cardiovascular events or diabetes is unknown.
METHODS
We used genetic scores consisting of independently inherited variants in the genes 
encoding PCSK9 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR; 
the target of statins) as instruments to randomly assign 112,772 participants from 
14 studies, with 14,120 cardiovascular events and 10,635 cases of diabetes, to 
groups according to the number of LDL cholesterol–lowering alleles that they had 
inherited. We compared the effects of lower LDL cholesterol levels that were medi-
ated by variants in PCSK9, HMGCR, or both on the risk of cardiovascular events and 
the risk of diabetes.
RESULTS
Variants in PCSK9 and HMGCR were associated with nearly identical protective effects 
on the risk of cardiovascular events per decrease of 10 mg per deciliter (0.26 mmol 
per liter) in the LDL cholesterol level: odds ratio for cardiovascular events, 0.81 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.89) for PCSK9 and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.90) 
for HMGCR. Variants in these two genes were also associated with very similar 
effects on the risk of diabetes: odds ratio for each 10 mg per deciliter decrease in 
LDL cholesterol, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.19) for PCSK9 and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06 to 
1.20) for HMGCR. The increased risk of diabetes was limited to persons with im-
paired fasting glucose levels for both scores and was lower in magnitude than the 
protective effect against cardiovascular events. When present together, PCSK9 and 
HMGCR variants had additive effects on the risk of both cardiovascular events and 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, variants in PCSK9 had approximately the same effect as variants in 
HMGCR on the risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes per unit decrease in the 
LDL cholesterol level. The effects of these variants were independent and additive.

Variation in PCSK9 and HMGCR and Cardiovascular Risk
M
onoclonal antibodies and other 
therapies that inhibit proprotein con-
vertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
have been shown to reduce low-density lipopro-
tein (LDL) cholesterol levels by approximately 50 
to 60% in several randomized trials.1-8 Whether 
lowering LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting 
PCSK9 will reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
events and, like statins, also increase the risk of 
new-onset diabetes is unknown.9
Exploratory and post hoc analyses of random-
ized trials have suggested that lowering LDL 
cholesterol levels by approximately 70 mg per 
deciliter (1.81 mmol per liter) with a PCSK9 in-
hibitor may reduce the risk of major cardiovas-
cular events by up to 50%.10,11 However, these 
trials included a total of fewer than 120 cardio-
vascular events, and data on the risk of new-
onset diabetes are very limited. Four much larger 
and longer-term cardiovascular outcome trials 
are currently ongoing and will provide a much 
more robust estimate of the clinical effect of 
PCSK9 inhibitors.12-15
In anticipation of the results of those trials, we 
have used a “mendelian randomization” approach 
to test the effect of LDL cholesterol–lowering 
variants in PCSK9 on the risk of cardiovascular 
events and diabetes. The results of a mendelian 
randomization study can be interpreted as follows: 
if a genetic variant (e.g., in PCSK9) is associated 
with an exposure of interest (e.g., LDL choles-
terol levels) that is observationally associated 
with the outcome under study (e.g., coronary heart 
disease), then the observed association between 
the exposure and the outcome is likely to be 
causal if the variant is also associated with the 
outcome. If not, the observed association be-
tween the exposure and the outcome is likely to 
be noncausal. (For more information, see the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.)
Because PCSK9 inhibitors are designed to 
recapitulate the phenotype of loss-of-function 
mutations,16,17 we used the presence of LDL cho-
lesterol–lowering variants in PCSK9 to estimate 
the biologic effect of inhibiting PCSK9 on both 
the risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of 
diabetes. We constructed genetic scores that 
mimic the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and the 
effect of statins (which target 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl–coenzyme A reductase [HMGCR]) and 
compared the effect of these scores on the risk 
of cardiovascular disease and the risk of diabe-
tes to make inferences about the potential clini-
cal benefit and safety of treatment with a PCSK9 
inhibitor as compared with treatment with a 
statin.
Methods
Study Population
The study included 112,772 participants (with 
14,120 cardiovascular events and 10,635 cases of 
diabetes) from 14 prospective cohort or case–
control studies who had provided written in-
formed consent for genetic studies and for whom 
individual participant-level data were available as 
part of the Database of Genotypes and Pheno-
types program of the National Center for Bio-
technology Information.18 A description of the 
included studies and the genotyping platforms 
that were used in each study is provided in Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Genetic Instruments
We constructed genetic scores for PCSK9 and 
HMGCR by combining all variants within 100 kb 
on either side of each gene that were associated 
with LDL cholesterol levels at a genomewide 
level of significance (P<5.0×10−8) as reported by 
the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium and that 
were in low linkage disequilibrium (r2<0.2) with 
all other variants included in the score.19,20 For 
each variant, we defined the exposure allele as 
the allele associated with lower LDL cholesterol 
levels.19 For each study participant, we calculated 
a weighted PCSK9 genetic score and a weighted 
HMGCR score by adding the number of LDL cho-
lesterol–lowering alleles that the person had inher-
ited at each variant that was included in either 
score, weighted by the effect of each variant on 
LDL cholesterol levels measured in milligrams 
per deciliter.19
Study Design
We dichotomized each genetic score and used 
this instrument to divide participants into two 
groups of approximately equal size on the basis 
of whether their genetic score was above the 
median or below the median (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Because each variant 
that was included in either genetic score is inher-
ited approximately randomly at the time of con-

ception21 and is inherited approximately indepen-
dently of other variants included in the score 
owing to low linkage disequilibrium, the number 
of LDL cholesterol–lowering alleles that a person 
inherits in either score should also be random. 
Therefore, assignment to each group with the use 
of this instrument should be random. To evalu-
ate the dose–response relationship, we divided 
participants into four groups on the basis of the 
quartile value of their genetic score. To compare 
the separate and combined effect of variants in 
PCSK9 and HMGCR, we conducted a 2×2 factorial 
analysis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Study Outcomes
The primary cardiovascular outcome for the study 
was a composite of the first occurrence of myo-
cardial infarction or death from coronary heart 
disease. Key secondary cardiovascular outcomes 
were major coronary events (defined as the first 
occurrence of myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, or death from coronary heart 
disease) and major vascular events (defined as 
the first occurrence of a major coronary event or 
stroke). The primary safety outcome was diabetes, 
defined as either a glycated hemoglobin level 
greater than 6.5% or treatment with a glucose-
lowering medication. Key secondary safety out-
comes were fasting plasma glucose level, weight, 
and body-mass index. To increase the statistical 
power of the analyses, we combined prevalent 
and incident outcome events under the assump-
tion that all events occur incident to a genetic 
exposure.
Statistical Analysis
We assessed whether the assignment to each 
group was indeed random by comparing the 
baseline characteristics of the participants in each 
group. We measured the difference in LDL choles-
terol level between groups using linear regres-
sion and compared the risk of cardiovascular 
events or diabetes using logistic-regression analy-
ses that were adjusted for age and sex. To com-
pare the effect of different variants or genetic 
scores on the risk of cardiovascular events and 
diabetes, we adjusted each effect size estimate 
for a standard decrement of 10 mg per deciliter 
(0.26 mmol per liter) in the LDL cholesterol level 
using the usual ratio of effect estimates method 
(for details, see the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
All analyses were performed separately in each 
of the included studies and then combined across 
studies in a fixed-effects inverse-variance–weighted 
meta-analysis to produce summary estimates of 
effect. To minimize the potential for bias with 
respect to population stratification, separate 
analyses were performed for each included an-
cestral group before being combined.
In a test of replication, we compared the effect 
of lower LDL cholesterol levels on the risk of coro-
nary heart disease mediated by the PCSK9 and 
HMGCR genetic scores in up to 62,240 case patients 
and 127,299 controls without such disease who 
were enrolled in the Coronary Artery Disease Ge-
nomewide Replication and Meta-Analysis plus the 
Coronary Artery Disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) 
consortium studies and in up to 86,196 partici-
pants of European descent (with 22,669 cases of 
diabetes) who were enrolled in the Diabetes Ge-
netics Replication and Meta-Analysis (DIAGRAM) 
consortium studies (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).22-24 Pleiotropy was assessed with 
the use of mendelian randomization–Egger re-
gression.25 All analyses were performed with the 
use of Stata 12 software or Golden Helix SNP & 
Variation Suite software (version 8.1.4).26 A de-
tailed description of the methods is provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Participant Characteristics
The weighted mean age of the study participants 
was 59.9 years. The participants had weighted 
mean cholesterol values as follows: LDL choles-
terol, 129.9 mg per deciliter (3.36 mmol per liter); 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 52.3 mg 
per deciliter (1.35 mmol per liter); and non-HDL 
cholesterol, 155.3 mg per deciliter (4.02 mmol 
per liter) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Seven variants were included in the PCSK9 
genetic score and six variants in the HMGCR ge-
netic score (Tables S4 through S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). There were no significant 
differences in any nonlipid baseline characteris-
tics between the groups being compared, thus 
showing that assignment to each group was in-
deed random (Table 1).
Cardiovascular Events
As expected, participants in the group with higher 
PCSK9 genetic scores had a lower mean LDL

lower PCSK9 scores (difference, −4.2 mg per 
deciliter [−0.11 mmol per liter]; P 
= 
5.6×10−16), as 
well as a lower mean level of non-HDL cholesterol 
(difference, −4.5 mg per deciliter [−0.12 mmol

1.8×10−16), a lower median level of 
triglycerides (difference, −5.3 mg per deciliter

6.8×10−10), and a higher 
mean level of HDL cholesterol (difference, 0.5 mg 
per deciliter [0.01 mmol per liter]; P 
= 
5.4×10−5) 
(Table 1). Participants in the group with higher 
PCSK9 genetic scores had an 8.4% lower risk of 
myocardial infarction or death from coronary 
heart disease (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.88 to 0.95), as well as similarly 
lower risks of major coronary events, major vascu-
lar events, myocardial infarction, and death from 
coronary heart disease (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). In dose–response analyses, in-
creasing PCSK9 scores were associated with a 
stepwise decrease in LDL cholesterol levels and 
a corresponding stepwise decrease in the risk of 
myocardial infarction or death from coronary 
heart disease (Fig. 1A). Indeed, when the effects 
of each PCSK9 score and the individual PCSK9 
variants included in these scores were plotted, 
there was a dose-dependent log-linear associa-
tion between PCSK9-mediated lower LDL choles-
terol levels and the risk of myocardial infarction 
or death from coronary heart disease (Fig. S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The effect of the 
PCSK9 score on the risk of myocardial infarction 
or death from coronary heart disease was similar 
in all subgroups studied (Fig. S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
In similar analyses using the HMGCR genetic 
score, participants in the group with higher 
HMGCR scores had a mean LDL cholesterol 
level that was lower by 3.2 mg per deciliter 
(0.08 mmol per liter) than participants with lower

effect in all subgroups studied.

For each study participant, we calculated a weighted PCSK9 genetic score and a weighted HMGCR score by adding 
the number of low­density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol–lowering alleles that the person had inherited at each vari­
ant that was included in either score, weighted by the effect of each variant on LDL cholesterol levels measured in 
milligrams per deciliter. A total of 10,401 primary cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or death from coro­
nary heart disease [CHD]) were included in the analysis. Of these events, 5508 (1528 prevalent myocardial infarc­
tions and 3980 incident myocardial infarctions or deaths from CHD) occurred in the prospective cohort studies and 
4893 in the case–control studies. Across the included studies, the median weighted PCSK9 score was 12.7 (range,

decrease in risk (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 
to 0.90) (Fig. 1C). The effects of the PCSK9 and 
HMGCR scores were very similar for all of the 
cardiovascular outcomes studied (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In the 2×2 factorial 
analysis, the PCSK9 and HMGCR genetic scores 
had additive effects on LDL cholesterol and the 
corresponding risk of cardiovascular events 
(Fig. 2A).
In external validation analyses involving up to 
62,240 case patients with coronary heart disease 
and 127,299 controls without such disease, the 
PCSK9 genetic score (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.80 to 0.88) and HMGCR genetic score (odds 
ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.89) had nearly 
identical associations with the risk of coronary 
heart disease per decrease of 10 mg per deciliter 
in the LDL cholesterol level (Figs. S6, S7, and S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Mendelian ran-
domization–Egger analyses showed that the effect 
of both PCSK9 and HMGCR variants on the risk of 
cardiovascular disease was due entirely to their 
LDL cholesterol–lowering effect, with no evidence 
for any significant pleiotropic effects (Figs. S9 
and S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Risk of Diabetes
Participants in the group with higher PCSK9 
scores had a 6.1% higher risk of diabetes than 
those in the group with lower PCSK9 scores 
(odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11). After 
adjustment for a standard decrement of 10 mg 
per deciliter in the LDL cholesterol level, PCSK9 
variants were associated with an 11.2% increase 
in the risk of diabetes (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 
1.04 to 1.19). This effect was very similar to the 
12.7% increase in the risk of diabetes per 10 mg 
per deciliter decrease in the LDL cholesterol level 
that was associated with HMGCR variants (odds 
ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.20) (Fig. 3). Both the 
PCSK9 and HMGCR genetic scores appeared to 
have dose-dependent effects on the risk of dia-
betes. When present together in the 2×2 facto-
rial analysis, the PCSK9 and HMGCR variants had 
additive effects on the risk of diabetes (Fig. 2B).
Among persons without prevalent diabetes at 
baseline, neither the PCSK9 genetic score nor the 
HMGCR genetic score was significantly associat-
ed with baseline fasting plasma glucose levels 
(difference in plasma glucose level for each 10 mg 
per deciliter decrease in LDL cholesterol level for 
PCSK9 score, 0.26 mg per deciliter [0.01 mmol 
per liter]; P 
= 
0.33; difference for HMGCR score, 
0.42 mg per deciliter [0.02 mmol per liter]; 
P 
= 
0.10). Among persons with impaired fasting 
glucose levels at baseline (≥100 mg per deciliter

Replication and Additional Analyses
In additional analyses designed to evaluate the 
role of LDL receptor–mediated pathways as a 
potential common mechanism by which PCSK9 
and HMGCR inhibition may increase the risk of 
diabetes, a genetic score consisting of variants 
in the gene encoding the LDL receptor (LDLR) had 
a very similar effect on the risk of diabetes per 
unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level as com-
pared with the PCSK9 and HMGCR genetic scores 
(Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In a test of replication involving up to 86,196 
participants of European descent (with 22,669 
cases of diabetes) who were enrolled in the 
DIAGRAM consortium studies, the PCSK9 and 
HMGCR genetic scores had very similar effects 
on the risk of diabetes per decrease of 10 mg per 
deciliter in the LDL cholesterol level (odds ratio

A total of 10,635 cases of diabetes were included in the analysis. Of these cases, 4340 were prevalent at baseline 
and 6295 incident cases occurred during follow­up in the prospective cohort studies. The case–control studies pro­

(Figs. S12, S13, and S14 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In additional analyses involving up to 
133,100 persons enrolled in the Meta-Analyses of 
Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium 
studies,27 the PCSK9 and HMGCR genetic scores 
had very similar effects on plasma glucose levels 
2 hours after an oral glucose challenge (effect 
of PCSK9 score per 10 mg per deciliter decrease 
in LDL cholesterol, 1.55 mg per deciliter; 95% 
CI, 0.46 to 2.63 [0.09 mmol per liter; 95% CI, 
0.03 to 0.15]; effect of HMGCR score per 10 mg per 
deciliter decrease in LDL cholesterol, 1.44 mg 
per deciliter; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.77 [0.08 mmol 
per liter; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.15]). These effects 
were quantitatively similar to the effect of the 
PCSK9 46L loss-of-function allele alone on both 
the risk of diabetes (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 
0.98 to 1.23) and on plasma glucose levels 2 hours 
after an oral glucose challenge (effect per 46L 
allele, 1.51 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 0.00 to 3.02 
[0.08 mmol per liter; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.17]).
Unlike the HMGCR genetic score, the PCSK9 
genetic score was not associated with weight, 
body-mass index, waist circumference, or waist-
to-hip ratio in up to 339,224 participants enrolled 
in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric 
Traits consortium studies (Table S8 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).28
Discussion
We found that genetic variants that mimic the 
effect of PCSK9 inhibitorshad remarkably simi-
lar effects on the risk of cardiovascular events 
and the risk of diabetes as compared with vari-
ants that mimic the effect of statins when mea-
sured per unit change in the LDL cholesterol 
level. Furthermore, we found that when variants 
that mimic the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and 
statins were present together, they had indepen-
dent and additive effects on the risk of both 
cardiovascular events and diabetes.
Our finding that PCSK9 and HMGCR variants 
were associated with approximately the same 
effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease per 
unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level sug-
gests that treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor 
should reduce the risk of cardiovascular events 
by approximately the same amount as treatment 
with a statin. Therefore, treatment with a PCSK9 
inhibitor, used either alone or in combination 
with a statin, should reduce the risk of cardio-
vascular events by approximately 20% per de-
crease of 1.0 mmol per liter (39 mg per deciliter) 
in the LDL cholesterol level.29
Our finding that variants in PCSK9 and 
HMGCR were associated with very similar effects 
on the risk of diabetes per unit decrease in the 
LDL cholesterol level implies that, like statins,

PCSK9 inhibitors may also increase the risk of 
new-onset diabetes. However, the increased risk 
of diabetes that was associated with both PCSK9 
and HMGCR variants appeared to be confined to 
persons with impaired fasting glucose levels. 
Therefore, as with statins, any potential increased 
risk of new-onset diabetes during treatment with 
a PCSK9 inhibitor is likely to be confined to 
persons with impaired fasting glucose levels.
Although variants that mimic the effect of 
PCSK9 inhibitors and statins were associated 
with an increased risk of diabetes, the corre-
sponding proportional reduction in cardiovascu-
lar risk was much greater than the increased risk 
of diabetes. Therefore, as with statins, the reduc-
tion in cardiovascular risk with PCSK9 inhibitors 
should far exceed any potential increased risk of 
diabetes. Furthermore, we found that both PCSK9 
and HMGCR variants were associated with a de-
creased risk of cardiovascular events among per-
sons with diabetes and those without diabetes. 
This finding is consistent with the results of 
meta-analyses showing that statins are associated 
with the same proportional reduction in the risk 
of cardiovascular events in persons with diabe-
tes as in those without diabetes.30 Therefore, like 
statins, PCSK9 inhibitors should reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular events equally well among per-
sons with diabetes and those without diabetes.
The mechanism by which PCSK9 and HMGCR 
variants increase the risk of diabetes is unclear. 
However, it is unlikely to be mediated by weight 
gain because unlike HMGCR variants, PCSK9 vari-
ants are not associated with obesity or its sub-
phenotypes, such as weight, body-mass index, or 
waist circumference. Instead, the mechanism may 
involve an LDL receptor–mediated pathway. We 
found that each set of gene-specific variants in 
PCSK9, HMGCR, and LDLR had a very similar effect 
as the other sets on the risk of diabetes per unit 
decrease in the LDL cholesterol level. This find-
ing is consistent with the fact that both PCSK9 
and HMGCR inhibitors ultimately reduce plasma 
LDL cholesterol levels by increasing the density 
of LDL receptors.31 It is also consistent with the 
observation that persons with familial hypercho-
lesterolemia appear to have a lower prevalence of 
diabetes than unaffected relatives.32
The genetic evidence suggests that PCSK9 and 
HMGCR inhibition, possibly acting through an 
LDL receptor–mediated pathway, may cause mild-
ly impaired glucose tolerance (as suggested by 
higher plasma glucose levels 2 hours after an 
oral glucose challenge) without materially in-
creasing fasting glucose levels, which may then 
lead to an increased likelihood of incident diabe-
tes among persons who have impaired fasting 
glucose levels. This conclusion is consistent with 
data from the Justification for the Use of Statins 
in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating 
Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), in which treatment with 
rosuvastatin was associated with an increased 
risk of diabetes but not an increase in fasting 
plasma glucose levels, and virtually all of the 
increased risk of diabetes occurred among per-
sons with impaired fasting glucose levels.33
Our study has limitations. Lifelong exposure 
to decreased levels of LDL cholesterol that are 
mediated by genetic variants is associated with 
much greater reductions in the risk of cardiovas-
cular disease per unit decrease in the LDL cho-
lesterol level than is short-term pharmacologic 
treatment.34 Therefore, the effect of PCSK9 vari-
ants on the risk of cardiovascular events (and 
probably diabetes) that was estimated is likely to 
be quantitatively much larger than the effect of 
treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor observed in the 
ongoing outcome trials as measured according 
to the unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol level. 
However, having first established that variants 
that mimic the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and 
statins have biologically equivalent effects on the 
risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes per unit 
decrease in the LDL cholesterol level, we believe 
it is reasonable to anticipate that PCSK9 inhibi-
tors and statins are likely to have therapeutically 
equivalent effects on the risk of cardiovascular 
events and diabetes per unit decrease in the LDL 
cholesterol level.35,36 In addition, it is important 
to note that monoclonal antibodies bind extra-
cellular PCSK9 and therefore may not have the 
same biologic effect as PCSK9 variants that lower 
LDL cholesterol levels.
In conclusion, we found that variants in PCSK9 
and HMGCR were associated with approximately 
the same effects on the risk of cardiovascular 
events and very similar effects on the risk of 
diabetes per unit decrease in the LDL cholesterol 
level. We also found that these effects were in-
dependent and additive.
