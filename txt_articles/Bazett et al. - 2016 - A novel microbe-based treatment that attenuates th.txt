There is an unmet need for effective new and innovative treatments for asthma. It is becoming 
increasingly evident that bacterial stimulation can have beneficial effects at attenuating allergic 
airway disease through immune modulation. Our aim was to test the ability of a novel inactivated 
microbe-derived therapeutic based on Klebsiella (KB) in a model of allergic airway disease in mice. 
BALB/c mice were exposed intranasally to house dust mite (HDM) for two weeks. Mice were treated 
prophylactically via subcutaneous route with either KB or placebo for one week prior to HDM exposure 
and throughout the two week exposure period. 24 hours after the last exposure, lungs were analysed 
for inflammatory cell infiltrate, gene expression, cytokine levels, goblet cell metaplasia, and serum was 
analysed for allergen-specific serum IgE levels. HDM exposed mice developed goblet cell hyperplasia, 
elevated allergen-specific serum IgE, airway eosinophilia, and a concomitant increase in TH2 cytokines 
including IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5. Treatment with KB attenuated HDM-mediated airway eosinophilia, total 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell numbers, BAL TH2 cytokine production, and goblet cell metaplasia. 
Our prophylactic intervention study illustrates the potential of subcutaneous treatment with bacterial 
derived biologics as a promising approach for allergic airway disease treatment.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and airway hyper-
responsiveness in response to environmental stimuli1. Airway inflammation includes an alteration in the profile 
and magnitude of cytokines that are locally produced, and the associated recruitment and activation of immune 
cells2. It is estimated that up to 300 million people3,4 suffer from asthma worldwide with the standard of care 
involving stepwise therapies designed to control asthma symptoms. This includes β 
-agonists, inhaled corticos-
teroids, combination therapies, and biologics5. Despite these therapeutic approaches, a subset of patients are not 
adequately controlled with current treatment options, and no therapeutic approach exists to reverse established 
asthma.
Asthma has multiple endotypes that are defined by cellular and immune mediator profiles2,6,7. A large pro-
portion of asthmatics demonstrate a TH2-cytokine skewed inflammatory profile2. The TH2-skewed asthmatic 
population frequently presents with an allergic phenotype characterized by increased allergen-specific serum 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, lung eosinophilia, and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) TH2 cytokine 
levels including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-131,6,8. This TH2 signature is currently being targeted with new biologics, includ-
ing antibodies against IL-4Rα 
9, IL-510, and IL-1311, which have provided clinical benefit to select patient popula-
tions. The clinical efficacy of these biologics gives evidence that strategies that are able to alter the TH2-skewing of 
the immune response in asthma would be of significant benefit.
The hygiene hypothesis, and adapted variations, has been proposed to explain the increase in rates of asthma 
in developed countries12,13. This hypothesis broadly states that there is a protective influence of microbial expo-
sure on the development of allergy and asthma. Therefore, the modern sanitized living standards of the developed 
world may contribute to disrupting the balance between our immune system and the microbiota that inhabit our

environment14,15. This perspective is consistent with the finding that children at risk for developing asthma have 
altered intestinal microbiomes16, which have been attributed to the use of formula, probiotics, and/or antibiot-
ics17. Therefore, means by which we are able to stimulate the immune system to overcome the dysfunction and 
dysbiosis caused by the reduced early life exposure to microbes may provide a new alternate avenue for managing 
the ever-increasing incidence of immune disorders such as asthma.
Different treatment strategies using bacterial products have shown clinical and in vivo efficacy at overcoming 
immune dysfunction in allergic disease, ranging from live bacteria that alter the microbiome, to specific pattern 
recognition receptor agonists18–21. In this study, we investigated whether using a novel therapeutic derived from a 
microbial species, Klebsiella (KB), that commonly causes lung infections would improve the immune dysfunction 
in an established asthma model.
The overall objective of this study was to test the use of KB in an asthma model consisting of two week expo-
sure to intranasally administered house dust mite (HDM), which has previously been shown to develop a robust 
TH2 response, serum IgE increase and goblet cell hyperplasia22. Using a prophylactic intervention strategy, we 
hypothesized that KB would attenuate development of respiratory mucosal immune responses important in an 
allergic asthma phenotype, resulting in lower levels of markers of systemic allergic sensitization, attenuation 
of the TH2 responses in the lung, and reduced pathology. Here, we demonstrate that a prophylactic subcutane-
ous intervention with a novel therapeutic derived from Klebsiella attenuates the development of TH2 lung and 
systemic inflammation, and associated lung pathology, while not inhibiting allergic sensitization. Our data is 
consistent with the hypothesis that bacterial derived therapeutics are able to diminish immune dysfunction in 
allergic airway disease, providing a potential new treatment option to be further investigated in additional stud-
ies, including in models of established airway disease.
Results
HDM induces an increase in HDM-specific serum IgE levels, which is not attenuated by KB. 
In 
this study, we investigated the efficacy of a KB therapeutic at attenuating allergic sensitization and TH2-skewed 
lung inflammation in a HDM murine model. The model was a two-week intranasal HDM exposure model with 
euthanasia one day after the final exposure. Subcutaneous treatment with the KB therapeutic was given prophy-
lactically for one week and continued throughout the HDM exposure phase (Fig. 1).
As a measure of allergic sensitization, we measured HDM-specific IgE in the serum (Fig. 2). HDM exposure 
induced an increase in HDM-specific IgE when compared to saline treatment (p < 
 0.05). KB treatment did not 
significantly attenuate the HDM-specific IgE signal.
KB attenuates lung inflammatory cell infiltrate following HDM exposure. 
As a measure of airway 
inflammation we performed bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and analysed the differential cell counts (Fig. 3). In 
placebo treated animals, HDM exposure induced an elevation in total BAL cell count (Fig. 3A, p < 
 0.05), which 
was attributed to an increase in neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils (Fig. 3B–E, p < 
 0.05). 
KB decreased the total BAL cell count and the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and eosino-
phils in HDM exposed animals (p < 
 0.05). However, in HDM exposed animals treated with KB, the total BAL 
cell count and each cell type remained elevated relative to saline exposed mice treated with KB (p < 
 0.05). Within 
saline exposed mice, KB did not cause any significant change in the number of total cells, neutrophils, lympho-
cytes, macrophages or eosinophils in the BAL fluid.
KB attenuates HDM-induced elevation of eotaxin and IL-5. 
Allergen-induced airway eosinophilia 
is influenced by systemic factors that regulate the differentiation of eosinophils in the bone marrow as well as 
chemotaxis to the lung23–25. IL-5 is a promoter of eosinopoiesis, promoting eosinophil maturation from the bone 
marrow and into the circulatory system26. Therefore, we next investigated if the suppression of HDM-induced air-
way eosinophilia was associated with changes in serum IL-5. HDM exposure induced an increase in serum IL-5 
that was attenuated by KB (Fig. 4A). KB had no impact on serum IL-5 levels in saline exposed animals. Eotaxin 
is a eosinophil chemotactic factor that promotes eosinophil recruitment to the lungs24,27,28. In the lung, HDM 
exposure induced an increase in BAL eotaxin that was attenuated by treatment, although this remained elevated

relative to saline controls (Fig. 4B). KB treatment had no impact on BAL eotaxin levels in saline exposed animals. 
Changes in other serum and BAL mediators can be found in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.
Increased expression of TH2 and TH1 genes in HDM exposed mice was not attenuated by KB. 
 
Allergic airway inflammation and eosinophilia is associated with TH2-skewed immune profiles. Therefore, we 
next measured lung gene expression of select TH2 (IL-4 and IL-13) and TH1 (IFN-γ 
) genes in the lung tissue. 
HDM exposure induced an increase in IL-4 and IL-13 gene expression that was not attenuated by KB (Fig. 5A,B). 
KB also had no impact on baseline IL-4 and IL-13 gene expression. Similarly, IFN-γ 
 gene expression was elevated 
in HDM-exposed groups and this was not attenuated KB (Fig. 4C).
Increases in BAL TH2 cytokine protein levels following HDM exposure is attenuated by KB. 
As 
lung tissue gene expression may not accurately reflect protein production in the BAL, we performed multiplex 
and ELISA analyses that included TH2 and TH1 mediators of interest. HDM exposure induced an increase in the 
protein levels of the TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Fig. 6A–C). KB attenuated HDM-induced IL-4 and IL-5, 
although IL-5 levels remained elevated relative to saline controls. Similarly, KB showed a trend for attenuation of 
HDM exposure induced IL-13 levels (p = 
 0.13). KB had no impact on BAL IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13 protein levels in 
saline exposed animals.
HDM exposure did not induce the TH1 cytokines, IFN-γ 
, IL-2, and TNF-α 
 (Fig. 6D–F). KB did not impact 
IFN-γ 
 or IL-2 in HDM-exposed animals, but did attenuate BAL TNF-α 
 in these animals. KB treatment had no 
observable impact on BAL IFN-γ 
, IL-2, and TNF-α 
 in saline exposed animals.
To look at the overall BAL cytokine profile changes between groups, we did a principle component analysis 
(PCA) using all multiplex data and the IL-13 ELISA data. The different experimental groups clustered separately 
based on the 1st principle component (PC1), containing 26% of the total variance (Fig. 7). Within the placebo 
treated mice, saline-exposed mice clustered separately from HDM exposed mice. KB treatment minimized the 
separation of HDM exposed mice from saline controls. Within the saline control group, KB and placebo treated 
mice were similar–as shown by their clustering together. As PC1 appeared to best differentiate the mice into differ-
ent groups (explaining 26% of variance), we looked at the cytokines that had the greatest contribution to PC1. The 
top 5 cytokines that determined PC1 were IL-5 (7.3%), eotaxin (7.2%), LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor; 7.2%), 
IL-4 (6.8%) and IL-13 (6.7%). Values of each mediator measured in BAL are shown in Supplemental Table 2.
Increases in airway goblet cells following HDM exposure is attenuated by KB treatment. 
HDM 
exposure-induced TH2 skewed airway inflammation is associated with an increase in the mucus producing goblet 
cells, an important component of asthma pathology29,30. We therefore quantified the goblet cell number in the 
airways. HDM exposure induced an increase in the area of periodic acid-Schiff stained goblet cells. KB treatment 
reduced the number of goblet cells in HDM exposed animals, although this was still elevated relative to saline 
controls (Fig. 8). Treatment with KB had no impact on goblet cells in saline exposed animals.
Discussion
Increasing evidence suggests that microbial exposures impact the development of the immune system and mod-
ulate the risk for developing allergic asthma16,31, which has led to the hypothesis that treatment of such disorders 
could involve agents that stimulate, rather than suppress, the immune system21. In our proof of concept study, 
we explored the ability of subcutaneous prophylactic treatment with a novel microbe-based compound, KB, to 
attenuate the establishment of allergic sensitization and lung inflammation in a mouse model of HDM exposure. 
Our results demonstrate that prophylactic treatment with KB attenuated markers of TH2-skewed allergic airway

results demonstrate efficacy and biological plausibility for future studies exploring how KB impacts established 
allergic airways disease with alternate dosing strategies aimed at reversing an established phenotype.

Allergic asthmatics demonstrate a TH2-cytokine skewed inflammatory profile with pronounced IL-4, IL-5, 
and IL-13 production in BAL and lung tissue2. TH2-skewed inflammatory responses contribute to the recruitment 
and activation of eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils to lung tissue. Activation of these cells can in turn impact 
mesenchymal cells including airway epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, contributing to airway 
remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness1. Selective targeting of TH2 cytokines to prevent allergic inflam-
mation has been attempted with anti-IL-5, IL-4Ra and IL-13 antibodies and is currently used as add-on therapy 
options for patients that are poorly controlled with conventional corticosteroids5. HDM is a common model to

trigger asthmatic responses and is known to induce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 levels30,32. These cytokines were present 
in our study and BAL protein levels were attenuated to varying degrees by KB treatment. Principal component 
analysis completed on 31 BAL cytokines further showed the effect of KB on the HDM-induced TH2 response. In 
the principle component analysis, HDM exposed mice clustered independently from saline exposed mice, and 
KB treatment shifted the HDM exposed mice back towards the control mice. IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin were 
identified as the major contributing cytokines to this KB-induced shift. Collectively these results suggest a broad 
dampening of the TH2 response in the airways after treatment, which may have important clinical implications.

IgE levels have been therapeutically targeted in allergic asthma33. Allergen-specific IgEs are able to recognize 
epitopes on antigens, which have the potential to lead to the activation of eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. 
Activation of these immune cells leads to the release of inflammatory mediators including the TH2 cytokines, 
IL-4, IL-5, and IL-131. We demonstrated that HDM exposure induced a robust allergen-specific serum IgE 
response that was not affected by KB treatment. This finding suggests that the Klebsiella derived therapeutic may 
not be effective in preventing the development of allergic sensitization and allergen-specific IgE, while still being 
efficacious for controlling lung inflammation. Our mouse model observations showing a disconnect between 
systemic allergic sensitization and allergen-induced lung inflammation parallel a clinical scenario where atopic 
non-asthmatic individuals show reduced lung inflammation relative to atopic asthmatics34. Interestingly, our 
data suggests that in this allergen model, the production and regulation of TH2 cytokines are uncoupled from IgE 
levels. Furthermore, our data suggests that allergic outcomes of clinical importance (e.g. BAL eosinophils) may 
not be directly related to allergen-specific IgE levels in the serum.
Eosinophils are recruited to the lungs during allergic asthma and mouse models of HDM exposure30. 
Eosinophils express the high affinity FceR that binds allergen specific IgE, which is a pre-requisite for activation 
and release of inflammatory mediators. Eosinophil levels are impacted by systemic factors that activate the bone 
marrow to produce eosinophils, and chemokines to recruit them to the lung23–25. Eotaxin can be released from 
airway epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to recruit eosinophils following an allergen expo-
sure27. Eotaxin is a potent chemokine for eosinophils and has served as a predictor of asthma onset and disease 
severity27. In contrast to eotaxin, IL-5 is a potent survival factor for eosinophils and promotes the maturation of 
progenitors leaving the bone marrow35,36. Clinical targeting of IL-5 for asthma therapy implicates the importance 
of this mediator in certain populations of asthmatics10. Therefore, for this treatment strategy to be efficacious at 
attenuating the downstream consequences of eosinophil activation by FceR cross-linking, an effective alternate 
strategy would be to reduce the total number of airway eosinophils or the ability for them to be recruited to the 
lung. Consistent with this biological concept, we demonstrate that HDM exposure induced an elevation in serum 
IL-5 and BAL eotaxin that are both attenuated by KB treatment. Our results indicate that a treatment with a 
biologic is capable of simultaneously targeting two of the key molecular components that promote airway eosin-
ophilia, in a process that is independent of the regulation of allergen specific IgE.
Microbes and microbial products can stimulate the immune system, shifting the immune profile to have pos-
itive benefits on asthma phenotypes. Live, orally delivered, bacteria have shown promise in preclinical studies 
at reducing TH2 responses. For example, similar to KB, oral exposure to live Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria can 
attenuate IL-5, IL-13 and eosinophilia in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, which was accompanied 
by a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness19. Interestingly, oral administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus also 
reduced IL-5, TNFα 
 and MCP-1 BAL levels, although this did not alter airway total cells or airway hyperres-
ponsiveness19. Specific microbial products can also have potential benefits on asthma phenotypes. For example, 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is found on gram negative bacteria including Klebsiella, have shown protec-
tive effects and can decrease the TH2 response when delivered intranasally and intravenously37–39. Other specific 
bacterial derived products that are agonists for pattern recognition receptors have the potential to decrease the 
TH2 response including macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) from Mycoplasma fermentans40 and 
Lipoprotein 1 (Opr1) isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa41. Mechanistically, these approaches are thought to 
prime dendritic cells and cause release of IFN-γ 
, ultimately leading to a decreased TH2 response40,41. Overall, this 
supports the approach of using bacterial products to alter the lung immune response. Future studies will be aimed 
at identifying the specific pathway and molecules through which the KB compound provides efficacy.
Mouse models of allergen exposure have been important for studying allergic sensitization, lung inflammation 
and associated lung pathologies42,43. The HDM exposure models in mice recapitulate the allergic sensitization, 
lung inflammation, pathology, and airway responsiveness that are observed in human asthmatics44. In this study, 
we showed that prophylactic treatment with KB in a two week model of intranasal HDM exposure effectively 
attenuates total BAL cells counts, eosinophilia, BAL TH2 cytokines, markers of eosinophil development and 
migration, and lung pathology. In light of our results, future studies examining the efficacy of KB in TH17 skewed 
mouse models of steroid resistant human asthma45 or TH2-low endotypes2,6 are warranted, which should include 
more refined analysis of lung and blood immune cell phenotypes (e.g. T regulatory cells)46 and activity states to 
extend understanding of how KB modulates immune responses important in allergic airways disease.
In conclusion, these data show that the a prophylactic microbe-derived treatment, KB, is efficacious at attenu-
ating HDM-induced TH2 skewed allergic airway inflammation, airway eosinophilia, and mucus content in goblet 
cells, independent of modulating allergen-specific IgE levels. Our study demonstrates proof of concept that this 
is a relevant novel treatment strategy to modulate inflammatory processes in asthma and sets the foundation for 
testing efficacy for reversal of established allergic airways disease. KB may promote a switch in the immune sys-
tem, providing a novel approach to treat patients with asthma or potentially serving as an early-in-life immune 
modulating approach to the prevention of asthma for high-risk individuals.
Methods
Animals. 
Female mice (BALB/c) age 6–8 weeks old were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, 
ME). 10 mice per group were used. Mice were housed in environmentally controlled specific pathogen free con-
ditions with a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle for the duration of the study. All protocols were reviewed and approved 
by the Animal Research Ethics Board of University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada) and all studies 
were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care guidelines. No deviations from the 
guidelines were performed.
Allergen exposure protocol. 
Mice were exposed to saline (35 μ 
L) or house dust mite (HDM, 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus, Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC), intranasally, 25 μ 
g in 35 μ 
L of saline, under

isoflurane anesthesia22. The HDM was product number XPB70D3A25, lot number 231897 with an endotoxin 
content of 78.72 endotoxin units/mg with an expiration date of 2023. HDM or saline nasal exposure was done for 
5 consecutive days in week 1 and 4 consecutive days in week 2 (experimental days: 1–5; 8–11, Fig. 1). Mice were 
euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure.
Klebsiella intervention strategy. 
KB was an immunogenic product derived from a propriety Klebsiella 
strain originally isolated from a sputum sample of a patient with acute Klebsiella pneumonia (Qu Biologics Inc., 
Vancouver, BC). The product comes suspended in physiological saline containing 0.4% phenol as a preservative 
for a final OD600 of 5.0. Placebo was physiological saline containing 0.4% phenol. KB or placebo was prophylacti-
cally given on day − 
7, − 
5, − 
3 of the experiment, and treatment was continued on experimental days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10. 
30 μ 
L of placebo or KB was injected at alternating sites subcutaneously in the lower right and left quadrant of the 
abdomen and the upper right and left quadrant of the chest, as suggested in the product protocol.
Blood collection, BAL, and cytospin analysis for BAL cell differentials. 
Blood and BAL were col-
lected and analysed as described previously29. BAL cell differential counts were performed by examining cytos-
pins according to cell morphology and Wright-Giemsa staining. A total of 100 cells per mouse were differentiated 
by a blinded observer.
Quantification of HDM-specific immunoglobulins by ELISA. 
HDM-specific IgE expression was ana-
lysed using a modified protocol47. In brief, HDM was coated onto 96-well plates (2.5 ug/well) and incubated over-
night at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% FBS in PBS, undiluted serum was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 
After washing, biotin anti-mouse IgE (BD Bioscience-San Jose, CA, USA) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 
one hour. Streptavidin-HRP/TMB substrate was used to visualize levels and absorbance was recorded at 450 nm. 
Data is presented as relative to the placebo treated saline exposed group.
Gene expression. 
Right lung tissue was lysed by homogenizing with a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen–Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada) and RNA isolation performed using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies-Carlsbad, 
CA, USA). iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit was used for cDNA synthesis (Biorad). Gene expression was done by 
quantitative RT-PCR on a StepOnePLus RT-PCR machine (Applied Biosystems-Foster City, CA, USA) using 
TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with Taqman probes for IL-4 (Mn00445259_m1), 
IL-13 (Mn00434204_m1) and IFN-γ (Mn01168134_m1).
Cytokine and chemokine analysis of BAL and serum samples. 
We quantified 31 cytokine/chemok-
ine/growth factor biomarkers simultaneously using a Milliplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine kit (Millipore, St. 
Charles, MO, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol. The multiplex was performed by Eve Technologies 
(Eve Technologies Corp, Calgary, AB, Canada) using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., 
Hercules, CA, USA). The 31-plex consisted of eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNγ 
, IL-1α 
, IL-1β 
, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, 
IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IP-10, KC, LIF, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, 
MIP-1α 
, MIP-1β 
, MIP-2, RANTES, TNFα 
, and VEGF. The assay sensitivities of these markers range from 0.1–
33.3 pg/mL. As IL-13 levels in the multiplex were mainly below detection, IL-13 protein levels were measured in 
the BAL fluid by an ELISA (eBioscience San Diego, CA, USA).
Histology. 
Lungs were dissected and inflated with 5 mL of 10% formalin as described previously29. Tissues 
were embedded with paraffin and sectioned at 3 μ 
m. Sections were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff to quan-
tify mucus-containing goblet cells. Stained sections were scanned at 60X magnification using an Aperio 
Slidescanner (Vista, CA), version 11.1.2.760. Positively stained pixels were identified by colour segmentation in 
a cross-sectional manner in the lung airway using Aperio Image Scope software to express the number of strong 
positive pixels (Periodic acid-Schiff) normalized to basement membrane length (μ 
M).
Data Analysis. 
Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism and are expressed as mean ± 
 SD. Multi-group 
comparisons were made by one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak post-hoc test. Four experimental group com-
binations of interest were compared; Saline-placebo vs. Saline- Klebsiella, Saline-placebo vs. HDM-placebo, 
Saline-Klebsiella vs. HDM- Klebsiella, HDM-placebo vs. HDM- Klebsiella. Differences were considered to be 
statistically significant when p < 
 0.05. For the purpose of statistical analysis, any value that was below the lowest 
value of the standard was recorded as half the lowest value of the standard. Principal component analysis (PCA) 
was performed for the BAL multiplex data, shown in Supplemental Table 1, plus the IL-13 ELISA. PCA was com-
pleted in R (version 3.2.4) using the prcomp command. (R Core Team (2016) R: A language and environment for
