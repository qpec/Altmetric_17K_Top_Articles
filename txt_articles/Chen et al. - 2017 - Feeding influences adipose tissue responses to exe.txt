10.1152/ajpendo.00006.2017.—Feeding profoundly affects metabolic
responses to exercise in various tissues, but the effect of feeding status
on human adipose tissue responses to exercise has never been studied.
Ten healthy overweight men aged 26 � 5 yr (mean � SD) with a
waist circumference of 105 � 10 cm walked at 60% of maximum
oxygen uptake under either fasted or fed conditions in a randomized,
counterbalanced design. Feeding comprised 648 � 115 kcal 2 h be-
fore exercise. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals to
examine changes in metabolic parameters and adipokine concentra-
tions. Adipose tissue samples were obtained at baseline and 1 h after
exercise to examine changes in adipose tissue mRNA expression and
secretion of selected adipokines ex vivo. Adipose tissue mRNA
expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4),
adipose triglyceride lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), fatty acid
translocase/CD36, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), and insulin
receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) in response to exercise were lower in fed
compared with fasted conditions (all P � 0.05). Postexercise adipose
IRS2 protein was affected by feeding (P � 0.05), but Akt2, AMPK,
IRS1, GLUT4, PDK4, and HSL protein levels were not different.
Feeding status did not impact serum and ex vivo adipose secretion of
IL-6, leptin, or adiponectin in response to exercise. This is the first
study to show that feeding before acute exercise affects postexercise
adipose tissue gene expression, and we propose that feeding is likely
to blunt long-term adipose tissue adaptation to regular exercise.
exercise; postprandial; adipose tissue; feeding
IT HAS BECOME CLEAR in the last 10 years or so that adipose tissue
plays an active role in many physiological processes and
pathological states (74, 78), and dysfunction within this tissue
is characterized by tissue-specific insulin resistance, local in-
flammation, fibrosis, and the abnormal secretion of adipokines
(36). Adipose tissue secretes dozens of mediators including the
archetypal adipokines, adiponectin and leptin (16, 38, 46).
Adiponectin is exclusively derived from adipose tissue and
circulates in high concentrations (10�20 mg/l). In other cases,
the quantitative amounts secreted by adipose can be substan-
tial; for example, subcutaneous adipose contributes up to a
third of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) (45).
Feeding has a pronounced effect on the whole body meta-
bolic responses to exercise and reduces the contribution of fat
towards metabolism (3, 23, 77). In addition, feeding influences
the skeletal muscle responses to various forms of exercise (9,
10, 13). For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme
4 (PDK4) is significantly upregulated in muscle with exercise
in fasted but not fed conditions (10). Other feeding-related
changes in gene expression in muscle after exercise have been
reported, including altered expression of glucose transporter
type 4 (GLUT4), PDK4, fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT/
CD36), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), uncoupling
protein-3 (UCP3), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
(9). Collectively, therefore, there is strong evidence that feed-
ing affects the responses to exercise in skeletal muscle. Adi-
pose tissue plays a crucial role during exercise (18), and this
led us to speculate that preexercise feeding may also affect the
adipose tissue responses to acute exercise.
During moderate-intensity exercise, adipose tissue provides
much of the energy for working skeletal muscle through the
mobilization of stored triacylglycerol (27). Exercise also initi-
ates a number of other responses in adipose tissue such as
increased blood flow and altered expression of various adipo-
kines within abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (66). It is
possible that these acute exercise-induced changes could be
part of the mechanism through which exercise improves health
(66). However, all prior studies of adipose tissue responses to
exercise in humans have been conducted in the fasted state (8,
19, 25, 31, 32, 39). The effect of feeding status on the response
of human adipose tissue to exercise has never been studied.
This is despite the fact that feeding has a profound effect on
adipose tissue (1, 30) and that we spend the vast majority
(~70%) of a 24-h period in a fed state (58). Consequently, the
aim of the present study was to investigate whether feeding
influences the adipose tissue responses to exercise.
METHODS
Ethical Approval
The protocol was approved by Bristol Research Ethics Committee
(REC reference number: 13/SW/0020) in accordance with the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:
NCT02870075). All participants provided verbal and written in-
formed consent before taking part.
Experimental Design
Ten men aged 18-35 yr with increased central adiposity were
recruited via local advertisement. Participants attended the laboratory
on three occasions for initial assessment of maximum oxygen uptake
(V
˙ O2max) and two subsequent main trials. The trial days involved
walking for 60 min at 60% V
˙ O2max under either fasted or fed

 conditions in a randomized, counterbalanced design separated by a 3-
to 4-wk washout period. This intensity and duration of exercise were
selected because they rely heavily on fatty acids mobilized from
adipose tissue and also because this is the type of exercise recom-
mended in recent position stands (20, 27). Blood and adipose tissue
were sampled at baseline and after exercise to examine the impact of
prior feeding. There are no data regarding how different dietary status
(fasted vs. fed) affects the adipose responses to exercise. However, a
previous study using a similar meal showed that feeding had an
enormous effect on the use of lipid during exercise, and thus this
indicates that the role of adipose tissue during exercise would be
potentially very different (3, 77). On the basis of these results, to see
an effect on lipid oxidation during exercise with 95% power and 5%
alpha, we would require between six and eight participants. We
recruited 10 men to account for greater variability in other outcome
measures.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be eligible to take part,
participants were required to be overweight with a waist circumfer-
ence of 94�128 cm (76). Participants were also required to be weight
stable (63) for at least 3 mo (mass stable � 3%). Participants com-
pleted a health questionnaire to exclude any existing cardiovascular
and metabolic diseases and a Physical Activity Readiness Question-
naire (PAR-Q) to make sure that participants were able to exercise
safely. Individuals taking any medications known to influence lipid/
carbohydrate metabolism or immune function and smokers were
excluded. A summary of participants’ physical characteristics is
shown in Table 1.
Fat in L1-L4 regions was determined using Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry (DEXA) (Discovery; Hologic, Bedford, UK) as pre-
viously described (22).
Pretrial Assessments
V
˙ O2max measurement. An incremental continuous treadmill test
until the point of volitional fatigue was used to determine V
˙ O2max. For
most participants, a treadmill speed of 4 km/h and gradient of 8.5%
were appropriate. This grade was maintained, and the speed was
increased by 1 km/h after every 3-min stage. One minute expired air
samples were collected into Douglas bags (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee,
KS), and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate were
measured in the final minute of each stage and also at the point of
volitional fatigue, defined as when the participant indicated that only
1 min remained until fatigue. Samples were analyzed for relative
expired fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide (Servomex, Crowbor-
ough, UK), and the total volume within the bag was measured using
a dry gas meter (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK).
Physical activity assessment. As part of the pretrial assessments,
participants wore a combined heart rate/accelerometer monitor for 1
wk to assess their habitual physical activity energy expenditure
(Actiheart; Cambridge Neurotechnology, Cambridge, UK). This was
attached to the chest via two adhesive ECG pads for 24 h per day
except for during showering/bathing/swimming (65).
Body composition analysis. Body mass was measured using digital
scales following an overnight fast and post void (TANITA, Tokyo,
Japan). Waist and hip circumference was assessed according to World
Health Organization guidelines (76). Body composition was determined
using DEXA. Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue mass
was estimated from a central region between L1 and L4 (22).
Trial Days
In the 72 h before each main trial, participants were asked to refrain
from performing any strenuous physical activity and from consuming
alcohol/caffeine for 48 h before the main trials. A dietary record was
completed 48 h before the first main trial, and participants replicated
this diet before their second main trial.
On main trial days, participants arrived at the laboratory between 8
and 9 AM following a 12-h fast. After anthropometric measurements,
participants rested on a bed for 15 min, followed by four 5-min
expired gas sample collections to determine resting metabolic rate
(RMR) (5, 11) using substrate oxidation under resting conditions (17).
During exercise, alternative equations were used (28).
After RMR assessment, a cannula was inserted into an antecubital
forearm vein, and a baseline venous blood sample was taken and
allocated into tubes with either EDTA or serum separation beads
(Sarstedt, Leicester, UK). Plasma samples were centrifuged immedi-
ately at 3,465 g at 4°C for 10 min. Serum samples were left for 45 min
to coagulate before centrifugation. Subcutaneous adipose tissue sam-
ples (~1 g) were taken under local anesthetic (1% lidocaine) from the
area around the waist ~5 cm lateral to the umbilicus with a 14-gauge
needle using an aspiration technique (72) followed by adipose tissue
cleaning and processing as described previously (67).
Participants then either consumed a meal (fed) or remained fasting
(fasted), and cannula-derived venous blood samples were taken every
15 min for the following 60 min. A further blood sample was collected
at 120 min immediately before the walking protocol. In both the fasted
and fed treatments, participants walked on the treadmill at 60%
V
˙ O2max for 60 min, and 1 min of expired air samples, RPE, and heart
rate were collected at 5, 20, 40, and 60 min. After completion of
exercise, another blood sample was immediately collected, and par-
ticipants then rested for a further 60 min. At this point, a second
adipose tissue and final blood sample were taken.
Meal
The meal in the fed trial was the same as previously described in
detail (7). The composition of the meal was selected to reflect typical
breakfasts in the UK (7). The amount was normalized to resting
energy requirements (7). Briefly, the total energy provided was
648 � 115 kcal (carbohydrate 120.1 � 21.3 g, fat 12.7 � 2.3 g, and
protein 20.9 � 3.7 g). The meal included white bread (Brace’s thick
white), cornflakes (Kellogg’s cornflakes), semiskimmed milk (Sains-
bury’s British semi-skimmed milk), orange juice (Sainsbury’s 100%
pure squeezed smooth orange juice), spread (Unilever; I Can’t Believe
It’s Not Butter), jam (Sainsbury’s strawberry jam), and sugar (Sains-
bury’s British white granulated sugar). Participants were asked to
consume the meal within 15 min. In the fasted trial, participants sat
quietly for a 15-min period.
Adipose Tissue Gene Expression and Culture
After we cleaned and minced the adipose tissue biopsy sample, one
portion of adipose tissue (~200 mg) was immediately homogenized in
5 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in an RNase/DNase-free sterile
tube (Invitrogen) and stored at �80°C before mRNA gene expression
and protein analysis. The remaining adipose tissue was used for
culture, and four ~100-mg portions were placed in sterile culture
plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with endothelial cell basal media
(ECBM) (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) containing 0.1% fatty
acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml

 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Adipose tissue was
incubated with a final proportion of 100 mg tissue per 1 ml ECBM
media for 3 h (68) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 and 95 � 5% relative
humidity incubator (MCO-18A1C CO2 incubator; Sanyo, Osaka,
Japan). After the 3-h incubation, media was transferred to sterile tubes
and stored at �80°C. Adipokine secretion from adipose explants was
normalized to explant adipose mass and then L1-L4 fat mass as
described (67).
Real-Time PCR
An RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) was used to extract
RNA from adipose tissue as described (72). Tissue samples were
quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorimeter (Life Technologies, Paisley,
UK). RNA was reversed transcribed (1 �g) to cDNA using a High-
Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, War-
rington, UK). Organic phenol-chloroform phase from the RNA ex-
traction was kept for further protein analysis. Real-time PCR was
performed using a StepOne (Applied Biosystems). Predesigned prim-
ers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems for the
measurement of expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (Hs00985639_m1),
adiponectin (Hs00605917_m1), leptin (Hs00174877_m1), IL-18
(Hs00155517_m1), tumor necrosis factor-� (TNF-�) (Hs99999043_

m1), and CPT-1B (Hs03046298_s1). The G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2)
(Hs00605971_m1), peptidylpropyl isomerase A (PPIA), was used as an
endogenous control (48). The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method
was used to process data, where �Ct � Ct target gene � Ct PPIA. Ct
target genes were normalized to an internal calibrator (lowest �Ct for
each target gene) and baseline. The Ct values for IL-6 (31 out of 40
samples), TNF-� (16 out of 40 samples), and IL-18 (37 out of 40
samples) were frequently over 35, and thus these results are not included.
Western Blotting
The adipose tissue protein fraction was isolated from the TRIzol
phenol-chloroform phase following the manufacturer’s protocol (TRI-
zol Reagent, Life Technologies). Briefly, 1 ml of organic phase was
mixed with 1.5 ml isopropanol. After being mixed, the samples were
incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 10 min of
centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4°C to pellet the protein. One milliliter of
protein pellet was washed using 2 ml of 0.3 M guanidine hydrochlo-
ride in 95% ethanol for a 20-min incubation followed by centrifuga-
tion at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4°C. This process was repeated three times.
After completion of the washing procedure, 2 ml of 100% ethanol was
added to the protein pellet for an additional 20-min incubation at room
temperature before being centrifuged. The pellet was then left to air
dry for 5�10 min. Then, 200 �l of 1% SDS were added to resuspend
the pellet. The protein content of the samples was determined using a
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Proteins
(25 �g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred using a
semidry electro-transfer method to a nitrocellulose membrane.
Western blotting analysis was performed with the following anti-
bodies: RAC-� serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt2)/PKB-�
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) (34), AMPK (Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy, Beverly, MA) (72), GLUT4 (26), IRS1 (Millipore) (35), IRS2
(Millipore) (47), PDK4 (ABGENT, San Diego, CA) (29), HSL (Cell
Signaling Technology) (56), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (GAPDH) (Proteintech, Rosemont, IL) (62). The images
were acquired in an EPI Chemi II darkroom (Analytik Jena, Upland,
CA), and bands quantified using VisionWorks LS analysis software
(Analytik Jena).
Biochemical Analysis
Plasma glucose and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were mea-
sured using commercially available assay kits and analyzer (Daytona
Rx; Randox, Crumlin, UK). Serum insulin (Mercodia, Uppsala, Swe-
den) and both serum and adipose media concentrations of IL-6, leptin,
and adiponectin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were measured
using ELISA.

time. Analysis of gene and protein expression data were conducted
using logged transformed data as previously described (72). Incre-
mental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated for insulin,
glucose, and NEFA using the trapezoid method (75) and analyzed
using paired t-tests. Statistical significance was set at P � 0.05.
RESULTS
Energy Expenditure and Substrate Oxidation During Fasted
and Fed Trials
There were modest feeding-induced differences between
trials for relative exercise intensity (% V
˙ O2max) and exercise
energy expenditure (Table 2). Fat oxidation during exercise
was reduced by ~45% in the fed trial (Table 2). Prefed RMR
was not different (2,103 � 418 vs. 2,058 � 365 kcal/day in
fasted and fed trials, respectively).
Plasma Glucose, NEFA, and Serum Insulin Concentrations
Trial � time interaction effects were found for blood glucose,
insulin, and NEFA between fasted and fed trials (P � 0.026, P �
0.003, and P � 0.001, respectively). As expected, iAUCs for
glucose and insulin were elevated for all parameters in the fed trial
(P � 0.02 and P � 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 1, B and D). Peak
glucose and insulin concentrations in the fed trial were reached 15
min after the meal (7.1 � 0.6 mmol/l and 370 � 185 pmol/l, Fig.
1, A and C, respectively). NEFA concentrations were lower at
most time points in the fed trial (Fig. 1E).

effect for HK2, MCP-1, and PGC-1� (Fig. 2). The expression
of the remaining genes was not significantly different between
trials or over time (Fig. 2).
Adipose Tissue Protein Expression
There was an interaction effect for IRS2 protein expression
between trials (P � 0.05), showing an approximately twofold
increase in fasted conditions and no change in fed conditions
(Fig. 3A). The change in the expression of the remaining
proteins was not statistically different between fasted and fed
conditions. Representative Western blots are shown in Fig. 3B.
Serum Adipokine Concentrations and Adipose Tissue
Secretion Ex Vivo
Serum IL-6 increased (Fig. 4A) and serum leptin decreased
(Fig. 4C) in both trials (P � 0.05). There was a modest time
effect for serum adiponectin (Fig. 4E) although no interaction
effects were identified for serum IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin.
Furthermore, no time or time � trial interactions were identi-
fied for ex vivo adipose explant secretion of IL-6, leptin, and
adiponectin in response to exercise under fasted and fed con-
ditions (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
This study presents the first evidence that feeding status
alters the human adipose tissue response to acute exercise, and
thus feeding status has the potential to influence the long-term
adaptation of adipose tissue to regular exercise.
In the present study, our feeding protocol successfully ma-
nipulated systemic concentrations of glucose and insulin. In the
2 h before exercise, there was a 168-fold and 26-fold difference
in insulin and glucose iAUC, respectively. As anticipated with
this study design, prior feeding increased relative carbohydrate
utilization and decreased fat oxidation during exercise (3, 23,
77). Thus exercise in fed and fasted trials was performed in a
very different physiological state.
At the gene expression level, we found that adipose tissue
responded differently to moderate-intensity exercise under
fasted versus fed conditions. When compared with the changes
in fasted exercise conditions, feeding led to lower changes or a
decrease in PDK4, ATGL, HSL, FAT/CD36, GLUT4, and IRS2
mRNA as demonstrated by interaction effects for these out-
comes. Over time, acute differences in skeletal muscle gene
expression with exercise conducted in the fasted vs. the fed
state have been proposed to contribute to diverse physiological
adaptations (12, 70). Our data demonstrate that feeding status
also alters adipose tissue responses to an acute bout of exercise.
We have previously shown that weight loss leads to a large
increase in genes such as PDK4 and HSL in adipose tissue (71),
whereas overfeeding leads to a profound decrease in both
PDK4 and HSL in adipose tissue (72). Thus feeding has the
potential to affect the acute adipose tissue responses to exer-
cise, and, given the important role of adipose tissue in health
and the nature of these changes (66, 71, 72), we propose that
feeding before exercise blunts some of the health-related
changes induced by exercise training.
We found a difference in adipose IRS2 protein content
between fasted and fed exercise conditions although the other
measured proteins were not affected. We should highlight that
our protein measurements represent only total protein content.
Repeated small changes in adipose protein synthesis likely lead
to accumulated differences and functional changes in adipose
phenotype over time (6, 50). Clearly, the only way to know
whether the acute changes observed in the present study
translate into long-term differences in protein content in adi-
pose is to examine whether chronic training conducted in the
fasted vs. postprandial state leads to divergent adaptations.
Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Adipose Tissue

DIETARY STATUS AFFECTS ACUTE ADIPOSE RESPONSES TO EXERCISE

 Fasting and exercise increase PDK4 mRNA expression in
skeletal muscle (52, 53), and insulin suppresses PDK4 mRNA
and protein content in skeletal muscle (37, 40). It is possible
that insulin could be responsible for the lower adipose PDK4
mRNA response in the fed trial although higher NEFA in the
fasted trial could also have increased PDK4 expression (2, 33).
Other feeding-related studies have shown that muscle PDK4
mRNA expression remained unchanged 1�4 h after exercise in
the fed state (with lower NEFA concentrations) compared with
exercise in the fasted state (9, 10). Thus exercise in the fasted
state appears to increase PDK4 expression in both muscle and
adipose, whereas exercise in the fed state does not.
ATGL and HSL mobilize stored fat and release it into the
circulation (79). In the present study, gene expression of
ATGL, HSL, and FAT/CD36 in adipose were all differentially
expressed in fasted and fed exercise conditions. These interac-
tion effects are explained by responses in the fed trial being
either lower or in the opposite direction to the fasted trial.
There was also greater fat oxidation during exercise in the
fasted trial. Other studies have also shown similar responses in
fasted exercise with higher fat oxidation and increased skeletal
muscle FAT/CD36 gene expression (9). Moreover, these find-
ings are consistent with the previously observed increase in
adipose HSL activity reported during cycling exercise, which
is blunted with nicotinic acid ingestion (73). Thus, given the
nature and direction of these changes, we propose that feeding
blunts at least some of the exercise-induced stimulus on adi-
pose tissue.
We found that GLUT4 mRNA, IRS2 mRNA, and IRS2
protein were also differentially expressed in adipose in fasted
and fed exercise trials. These effects were subtle but consistent,
and this also seems to indicate that exercise in a fed state will
not generate the same change in pathways involved in glucose
metabolism and signaling within adipose tissue as fasted ex-
ercise. Previous findings in skeletal muscle have found an
increase in GLUT4 mRNA in fasted but not fed conditions after
exercise (9, 10).

 on skeletal muscle PGC-1� mRNA is controversial. Some
studies indicate that PGC-1� mRNA expression is upregulated
after exercise whether acute exercise is performed in fed or
fasted conditions (10, 42), but other studies show that higher
carbohydrate availability before exercise blunts PGC-1�
mRNA expression in skeletal muscle both at rest and after
exercise (4, 55). In the present study, the increase in adipose
PGC-1� mRNA expression after exercise was unaffected by
feeding status. Chronic training studies indicate that adipose
PGC-1� mRNA is increased in humans (59) and rodents (64,
69), and this has also been reported to increase PGC-1� protein
content and mitochondrial biogenesis in rodents (69). Whether
the present results indicate an acute exercise-induced increase
in mitochondrial biogenesis in human adipose tissue is plausi-
ble but unclear at the present time.
Adipokine Response to Exercise and Impact of Feeding
Status
Previous studies have shown that circulating adipokine con-
centrations are affected by acute exercise (8) and that energy
consumption during exercise alters these systemic responses
(57, 61). However, evidence from studies that have manipu-
lated feeding status before exercise is scarce. Zoladz et al. (80)
found no difference in circulating IL-6 and leptin after a single
bout of exercise, in a fed or fasted state. However, the duration
of exercise lasted only 12 min, and this might be insufficient to
examine the notion that feeding status influences circulating
adipokines. The exercise in the present study was 60 min, and
we too found no evidence that preexercise feeding affects
circulating IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin. This may be due to
the fact that moderate-intensity exercise has only a modest
effect on many of these parameters, and thus there is little
potential for feeding to interact with exercise and exert an
effect (41). Serum IL-6 was increased over time in both fasted
and fed trials in the present study, which could be partly due to
the effect of exercise (51). As we did not observe changes of
adipose IL-6 secretion ex vivo, the increase in serum IL-6
might be caused by release from skeletal muscle during exer-
cise (49), but it is also possible that this reflects local produc-
tion of IL-6 attributable to prolonged cannulation (14).
Temporal and Population-Specific Considerations
This study is the first to examine the impact of feeding on
adipose tissue responses to exercise. We recruited overweight
participants, and this focus is a strength given that ~62% of the
UK population are overweight (24). Increased adiposity has a
profound effect on adipose tissue function [e.g., a downregu-
lation of GLUT4 mRNA (67) and reduction in postprandial
adipose tissue blood flow (44)]. These could be important
considerations when interpreting our findings. We should also
highlight that, in the present study, we were limited to only two
adipose tissue biopsies because of a concern over potential
interference from repeated sampling (15), so we do not have a
full and complete time course. For the first study of this kind
and with limited sampling opportunities, a second biopsy 60
min after exercise was considered to balance the requirement to
capture pathways that rapidly change and those that are slower
to respond. Subsequent studies should consider more frequent
adipose sampling and/or the inclusion of additional resting
trial(s). Depending on the kinetics of each response, our sample
timing framework will be appropriate for some outcomes and
less appropriate for others. Furthermore, in the absence of an
adipose biopsy immediately before exercise, it is hard to
establish whether some effects in the fasted trial are due to the
modestly extended fasting period or due to exercise (or the
interaction between fasting and exercise). What is very appar-
ent, however, is that exercise in fed conditions does not lead to
the same changes as exercise in fasted conditions.
Conclusion
This study provides the first evidence that the feeding status
alters the response of adipose tissue to acute exercise. Several
genes involved in lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and
glucose transport were differentially expressed in adipose tis-
sue when exercise was performed in a fed vs. fasted state with
either lower or opposing responses after feeding. Given the
nature and direction of these differences, we propose that
feeding is likely to blunt long-term adaptations induced within
adipose tissue in response to regular exercise.
