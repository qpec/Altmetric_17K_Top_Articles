Abstract
Background/Objectives: To investigate the effect of dried fruit in modifying postprandial glycemia, we assessed the
ability of 4 dried fruits (dates, apricots, raisins, sultanas) to decrease postprandial glycemia through three mechanisms:
a glycemic index (GI) effect, displacement effect, or ‘catalytic’ fructose effect.
Subjects/Methods: We conducted an acute randomized, multiple-crossover trial in an outpatient setting in 10
healthy adults. Participants received 3 white bread control meals and 12 dried fruit test meals in random order. The
test meals included each of 4 dried fruits (dates, apricots, raisins, sultanas) alone (GI effect), 4 of the dried fruits
displacing half the available carbohydrate in white bread (displacement effect), or 4 of the dried fruits providing a
small ‘catalytic’ dose (7.5 g) of fructose added to white bread (‘catalytic’ fructose effect). The protocol followed the ISO
method for the determination of GI (ISO 26642:2010). The primary outcome was mean ± SEM GI (glucose scale) for
ease of comparison across the three mechanisms.
Results: Ten healthy participants (7 men, 3 women; mean ± SD age and BMI: 39 ± 12 years and 25 ± 2 kg/m2) were
recruited and completed the trial. All dried fruit had a GI below that of white bread (GI = 71); however, only dried
apricots (GI = 42 ± 5), raisins (GI = 55 ± 5), and sultanas (51 ± 4) showed a significant GI effect (P < 0.05). When
displacing half the available carbohydrate in white bread, all dried fruit lowered the GI; however, only dried apricots
(GI = 57 ± 5) showed a significant displacement effect (P = 0.025). None of the dried fruits showed a beneficial
‘catalytic’ fructose effect.
Conclusions: In conclusion, dried fruits have a lower GI and reduce the glycemic response of white bread through
displacement of half of the available carbohydrate. Longer-term randomized trials are needed to confirm whether
dried fruit can contribute to sustainable improvements in glycemic control.

Introduction
Dried fruits show promising potential for blood glucose
management. Previous trials conducted in individuals
with and without diabetes have shown dried fruits
(including dates, apricots, raisins, and sultanas) to have a
low (≤55) to medium (56–69) glycemic index (GI)1–7 and
to have beneficial effects on postprandial glucose3,6,8–11
and insulin3,6,11 levels, as well as HbA1c
8 compared to
high GI foods (e.g., crackers, cookies, white bread, glucose
solution). However, the effect of combining dried fruits
with high GI foods has not been adequately addressed.
Current research suggests that combining dried fruits
with high GI foods by displacing available carbohydrate
may benefit postprandial glycemia in comparison to high
GI foods alone. This is supported by acute studies
showing that nuts and/or dried fruits combined with high

 GI foods can attenuate relative glycemic responses in
healthy participants when compared to high GI foods
alone7,12,13. Dried fruits may also benefit postprandial
glycemia by providing small or ‘catalytic’ doses of fructose
(≤10 g/meal). Fructose, through its metabolite fructose-1-
P, has shown ‘catalytic’ effects on hepatic glucose meta-
bolism through the induction of glucokinase activity in
hepatocytes14–17. Infusion studies in humans have shown
that this mechanism relates to a ~3-fold increase in gly-
cogen synthesis under euglycemic conditions in healthy
individuals18 and a ~30% decrease in hepatic glucose
output under hyperglycemic conditions in individuals
with type 2 diabetes19. Clinical translation of these find-
ings have shown ‘catalytic’ doses of fructose at 7.5 and 10
g to decrease postprandial glycemic responses to oral
glucose or high GI meals (e.g., mashed potatoes) by
~15–30% in healthy individuals20,21 and those with
diabetes22.
Therefore, to address this knowledge gap, we aimed to:
(1) quantify the GI of 4 different types of dried fruit (dates,
apricots, raisins, sultanas) (GI effect); (2) to assess the
ability of these 4 dried fruits to decrease the postprandial
glycemic response to white bread by partially displacing
available carbohydrate (displacement effect); and (3) by
providing a ‘catalytic’ dose of fructose (‘catalytic’ fructose
effect).
Subjects and methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from the Glycemic Index
Laboratories clinic volunteer roster. Inclusion criteria
consisted of men or non-pregnant women aged 18–75
years who were in good health. Individuals with a known
history of diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, kidney
disease, thyroid disease, HIV, or any other major illnesses
that may affect carbohydrate metabolism, or using med-
ications which might either make participation dangerous
to the individual or affect the results were excluded.
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Western
Institutional Review Board® (protocol number: 971199)
which meets all the requirements of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS), the Canadian Health Pro-
tection Branch (HPB), Canadian Institutes of Health
Research (CIHR) and the European Community Guide-
lines. All participants provided written informed consent
prior to starting the study and received a financial reward
for their participation. The study was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02960373).
Study design
This was an acute randomized, multiple-crossover trial
that
followed
the
International
Organization
for
Standardization (ISO) method for determining GI (ISO
26642:2010). Eligible participants underwent 15 separate
study meals on 15 separate occasions, with each partici-
pant undergoing up to 3 study meals per week separated
by at least one day. Randomization of the sequence of
study meals was performed using a computer random
number generator by a coordinator blinded to the treat-
ment allocation. On each test day, participants came to
the
clinic
(Glycemic
Index
Laboratories,
Toronto,
Canada) in the morning after a 10-14 h overnight fast.
After being weighed and having two fasting blood samples
obtained by finger-prick 5 min apart, the participant then
consumed a study meal within 15 min. At the first bite a
timer was started and additional blood samples were
taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of
the study meal. Before and during the test, a blood glucose
test record was filled out with the participants initials, ID
number, date, body weight, study meal, time they started
eating, time it took to eat, time and composition of last
meal, and any unusual activities. Participants remained
seated quietly during the 2 h of the test. After completing
the test, participants were offered a snack and then
allowed to leave.
Study meals
Each participant underwent a total of 15 separate
study meals consisting of 3 white bread control meals
and 12 dried fruit test meals (Table 1). The test meals
included each of the 4 dried fruits (dates, apricots, rai-
sins, sultanas) alone (GI effect), displacing half the
available carbohydrate in white bread (displacement
effect), or providing a small ‘catalytic’ dose (7.5 g) of
fructose added to white bread (‘catalytic’ fructose effect).
Each study meal was designed to contain a total of 50 g
of available carbohydrate with the exception of the study
meals testing the ‘catalytic’ fructose effect. The’catalytic’
dose of 7.5 g of fructose was derived from both free
fructose and fructose bound in sucrose. The nutrient
content of the study meals was analyzed by Merieux/
Silliker (Toronto, Canada) using the Association of
Official Agricultural Chemists approved methods and is
provided in Table 2.
Blood sample collection and analysis
Each finger-prick sample consisted of a total of 2–3
drops of capillary blood collected into flat-bottomed 5
ml plastic tubes with a push cap containing a small
amount of sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate as an
anticoagulant
and
preservative.
The
samples
were
mixed by rotating the tube vigorously and then refri-
gerated during the testing session. After completion of
the test session, samples were stored at −20 °C prior to
blood glucose analysis. Within five days of collection
the blood glucose analysis was conducted using a YSI

 model 2300 STAT analyzer (Yellow Springs, OH) by a
lab technician blinded to the treatment allocation.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome was GI, which was determined
using the ISO method (ISO 26642:2010) and adjusted to
the glucose scale, where GI of glucose = 100 and white
bread = 71. Although the ISO method does not allow for
mixed meals (displacement effect, ‘catalytic’ fructose
effect) or meals containing > 50 g of available carbohy-
drate (‘catalytic’ fructose effect), we used this outcome
measure for ease of comparison with the GI of dried fruit
alone (GI effect).
The GI of the test meals was calculated by expressing
each participant’s incremental area under the blood glu-
cose curve (iAUC) values for the test meal as a percentage
of the same participant’s mean iAUC for the three white
bread control meals. The iAUC values were calculated
using the trapezoidal rule, ignoring the area below fasting.
For the purpose of the iAUC calculation, fasting glucose
was taken to be the mean of the first measurement of the
glucose concentration at times -5 and 0 min. GI values >
2*standard deviation (SD) above the mean were excluded
and replaced by the mean of the remaining values. GI and
iAUC values were expressed as mean ± SEM.
Using the t-distribution and assuming an average
coefficient of variation (CV) of within individual variation
of iAUC values of 25%, n = 10 participants had 80% power
to detect a 33% difference in iAUC with 2-tailed P < 0.05.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software
(SAS Inst. Version 8.2; Gary, NC). Data were entered into
a spreadsheet by two different individuals and the values
compared to assure accurate transcription. Pairwise dif-
ferences in GI and iAUC between the white bread control
and the three mechanisms (GI effect; displacement effect;
‘catalytic’ fructose effect) for each of the 4 dried fruits
(dates, apricots, raisins, sultanas) was assessed by the
Dunnett’s
test,
with
P < 0.05
considered
statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 10 participants (7 men; 3 women), with a
mean ± SD age and BMI of 39 ± 12 years and 25.3 ± 2.3
kg/m², respectively, were recruited and completed the
study between November and December, 2016 (Fig. 1,
Table 3).
Within participant variation of reference food
The mean within CV of the iAUC values after the 3
white bread control meals was 14.6%, which is considered
to be satisfactory (values < 30% are considered satisfactory
(ISO 26642:2010)).

 Postprandial glycemic responses and glycemic index
Table 4 shows the GI of the 4 dried fruits and their
effects on postprandial glycemic responses through the
three assessed mechanisms (GI effect; displacement effect;
‘catalytic’ fructose effect). All dried fruits lowered the
postprandial glycemic response and had a GI below that
of white bread; however, only the dried apricots (GI = 42
± 5), raisins (GI = 55 ± 5), and sultanas (51 ± 4) showed a
significant GI effect (P < 0.05). When displacing half the
available carbohydrate in white bread, all dried fruit
lowered the postprandial glycemic response. However,
only dried apricots (GI = 57 ± 5) significantly reduced the
glycemic response through the displacement effect (P =
0.025). None of the dried fruits showed a beneficial ‘cat-
alytic’ fructose effect.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that dried fruits (dates,
apricots, raisins, and sultanas) have a low to medium GI.
When displacing half of the available carbohydrate in
white bread, all of the dried fruits lowered the GI, with
dried apricots showing a significant displacement effect.
None of the dried fruits showed a beneficial ‘catalytic’
fructose effect.
Findings in relation to other studies and potential
mechanisms
Although there are a limited number of trials assessing
the effect of dried fruits on cardiometabolic health out-
comes, our findings are consistent with previous trials
showing dried fruit to have a low to medium GI1–7 and
to lower postprandial glycemia3,6–11. Several potential
mechanisms may explain these findings. The low to
medium GI and source of dietary fibre of dried fruits
(~3–8 g of fibre per ¼ cup or 60 mL, which is equivalent
to one Canada Food Guide serving23) are factors that
have both been shown to have benefits for glycemic
control and diabetes risk reduction in randomized con-
trolled trials24–27 and prospective cohort studies28–30.
Their viscous fibre and whole food matrix are thought to
be other contributors to lowering the glycemic response.
Dried fruits are also a good source of phytochemicals
(e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids, etc.)31,
which may play a role in modifying blood glucose and
diabetes risk32. Another potential mechanism may relate
to the type of sugar present. Fructose, a low GI sugar,
comprises 23–50% of the total sugar content of dried
fruits33,34. In systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
controlled feeding trials, we demonstrated that small
doses of fructose (defined as ≤ 36 g/day based on the
following: 3 meals at ≤ 10 g/meal and 2 snacks at ≤ 3 g/
snack)35 and larger doses of fructose (median, 60 g/
day)36 in exchange for other carbohydrate sources
decreased HbA1c levels by 0.4 and 0.53%, respectively.
This level of reduction exceeds the clinically meaningful
threshold of 0.3% proposed by the U.S. FDA for the
development of new oral anti-hyperglycemic agents37. In
terms of our findings regarding a displacement effect of
dried fruit, we expect this would also be observed with
other high GI carbohydrate foods. The addition of pis-
tachios to a number of commonly consumed high GI
carbohydrate foods (bread, pasta, rice, potato) was found
to attenuate the glycemic response in healthy individuals
(n = 10), all of which were statistically significant except
for potato12. To our knowledge, only one randomized
trial has been conducted where 4 different dried fruits
(raisins, apples, jujubes, and apricots) were used to dis-
place half the available carbohydrate of white rice in
healthy individuals (n = 11)7. Similar to our findings, all

 the dried fruits lowered the glycemic response relative to
white rice alone, however, none were statistically sig-
nificant due to high variability7. It would appear that a
larger number of participants would be required to
consistently observe a significant displacement effect
with dried fruit.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the results of this
acute feeding trial cannot be translated into long-term
benefits. Second, the small sample size of 10 participants,
although validated, makes these findings less precise and
generalizable. Third, the ISO method for determining GI
was not followed for the study meals assessing the dis-
placement and ‘catalytic’ fructose effect mechanisms as they
consisted of a mixed meal and/or >50 g of available carbo-
hydrate. The purpose of determining the GI for study meals
assessing these two mechanisms was for ease of compar-
isons with the GI of dried fruit alone (GI effect) and can be
regarded as a relative glycemic response. Fourth, an imbal-
ance in available carbohydrate in assessing the ‘catalytic’
fructose effect may have confounded the results. Because the
test meals assessing the ‘catalytic’ fructose effect used ‘real
world’ whole food sources of fructose from dried fruit rather
than fructose alone, there was additional glucose and
sucrose contained in these meals. The additional glucose
and sucrose would have increased the relative amount of
available glycemic carbohydrate (free glucose or glucose
from the hydrolysis of sucrose and starch) in the dried fruit
test meal compared with that in the white bread control
meal (starch alone), resulting in a higher glycemic response,
which may have offset any ‘catalytic’ effect of fructose.
Future trials should consider standardizing the amount of
available glycemic carbohydrate in study meals that assess
the effect of ‘catalytic’ doses of fructose from whole foods.
Implications
Our study aimed to assess the effect of the most
commonly consumed dried fruits. According to estimates
from the International Nut and Dried Fruit Foundation,
dried grapes (including raisins and sultanas), followed by
dates, were the most highly consumed dried fruits in both
high- and middle-income countries38. Estimates were
also provided for dried apricots, prunes, and dried figs,
which were consumed at lower levels relative to dried
grapes and dates38. Dried fruits, which can be processed
using various drying methods to extend their shelf life as
dried fruits, are nutritionally equivalent to fresh fruits in
smaller serving sizes31. This property makes dried fruit
easier to store and distribute throughout the year and
provides a healthier alternative to high GI food pro-
ducts31. Given that a small percentage of the U.S. popu-
lation consumes dried fruits (7%) (41) and the observed
benefits of dried fruits on postprandial glycemic response
levels, there is opportunity to use them in combination
with high GI foods to lower their GI and help with blood
glucose management. Although we predict that the use of
other dried fruits to displace available carbohydrate from
other high GI foods will produce similar findings to ours,
more randomized trials are needed in this area to confirm
this.
Conclusions
The results of this study show that dried fruit have a
lower GI than white bread and can lower the glycemic
response of white bread through displacement of half of
the available carbohydrate. Longer and larger randomized
trials are needed to confirm whether dried fruit can
contribute to sustainable improvements in glycemic
control, as well as assess whether other types of dried
fruits and displacement of available carbohydrate from
other high GI foods will show similar findings. Overall,
these findings will help stimulate important industry
innovation and improve the design of future clinical
investigations that will potentially lead to the use of dried
fruits as an effective tool to modify the glycemic response
of high carbohydrate foods.
