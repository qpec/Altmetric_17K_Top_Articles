In Brief
Xu et al. generated mice with all members
of the kainate receptor family of
glutamate receptors deleted. These mice
demonstrate compulsive and
perseverative behaviors and deficits in
the function and number of excitatory
synapses in the striatum. This
demonstrates that kainate receptors
regulate the proper formation and
function of striatal circuits.

SUMMARY
Kainate receptors are members of the glutamate re-
ceptor family that regulate synaptic function in the
brain. They modulate synaptic transmission and the
excitability of neurons; however, their contributions
to neural circuits that underlie behavior are unclear.
To understand the net impact of kainate receptor
signaling, we generated knockout mice in which all
five kainate receptor subunits were ablated (5ko).
These mice displayed compulsive and persevera-
tive behaviors, including over-grooming, as well as
motor problems, indicative of alterations in striatal
circuits. There were deficits in corticostriatal input
to spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsal stria-
tum and correlated reductions in spine density. The
behavioral alterations were not present in mice only
lacking the primary receptor subunit expressed in
adult striatum (GluK2 KO), suggesting that signaling
through multiple receptor types is required for proper
striatal function. This demonstrates that alterations
in striatal function dominate the behavioral pheno-
type in mice without kainate receptors.
INTRODUCTION
Kainate receptors (KARs) are glutamate-gated receptors that
are expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain but with distinct
expression patterns for the individual subunits (Wisden and See-
burg, 1993). The endogenous receptors are heteromultimeric
proteins composed of combinations of the GluK1-GluK5 sub-
units that form ligand-gated ion channel receptors and link to
non-ionotropic signaling pathways (Contractor et al., 2011). Kai-
nate receptors play a multitude of roles at synapses, primarily as
modulators of synaptic transmission, although in some neurons
they also mediate postsynaptic currents. The diversity in their
subunit composition and localization combined with multiple
signaling modalities has complicated analysis of their roles in
the brain. This has led to a lack of clarity in understanding their
principal contributions to both circuit and behavioral functions.
Likewise, genetic linkage has been demonstrated to several
neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including
schizophrenia (Begni et al., 2002; Pickard et al., 2006), obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD) (Delorme et al., 2004; Sampaio et al.,
2010), autism (Jamain et al., 2002), and mental retardation (Mo-
tazacker et al., 2007), but in most cases these have yet to receive
strong confirmatory support (Lerma and Marques, 2013).
Analysis of single-subunit kainate receptor knockout mice has
been helpful in deciphering some of these roles both at the syn-
aptic (Contractor et al., 2003; Mulle et al., 1998, 2000) and
behavioral level (Catches et al., 2012; Shaltiel et al., 2008).
Expression of the subunits varies at different developmental
time points in many cells (Bahn et al., 1994), and therefore the
interpretation of behavioral studies is complicated by difficulties
in verifying whether complete functional loss of kainate receptors
occurs in any specific cell type throughout development in these
monogenic mutants. This caveat is even more relevant given that
there is not an obligate subunit required for the expression of the
kainate receptor heteromultimeric complex. Therefore, multiple
genes must be targeted in mice to ensure functional elimination
of kainate receptors. To achieve this goal, we intercrossed five
mice with targeted mutations in the kainate receptor genes,
which are separately located on chromosomes 16, 10, 4, 9,
and 7, to produce a mouse with all five kainate receptor genes
Grik1–5 disrupted (5ko mice). Generation of these mice has al-
lowed us to study both behavioral and synaptic alterations

 when kainate receptors are genetically disrupted throughout the
life of the animal.
We found that 5ko mice had striking behavioral alterations that
were predominantly indicative of disrupted corticostriatal func-
tion. The behavioral alterations in 5ko mice were exemplified by
self-injurious over-grooming, an increase in perseverative behav-
iors, and impairments in motor ability. Moreover, we found that
corticostriatal synaptic transmission was impaired in 5ko mice;
spine density was decreased in both the D1 (direct pathway)
and D2 (indirect pathway) spiny projection neurons (SPNs) with
a concomitant decrease in the frequency of mEPSC events.
Together, study of these mice has uncovered a previously un-
known role for kainate receptors in the proper functioning of stria-
tal synapses and suggests that kainate receptors have a major
role in the correct formation of corticostriatal circuits.

single-gene targeted mice (Contractor
et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2009; Mulle
et al., 1998; Mulle et al., 2000; Pinheiro
and Mulle, 2008). Mice lacking all five
KAR genes (5ko) mice were viable and
homozygous mice were maintained on a
C57BL/6:129S
background.
Heterozy-
gous pups (5het) from a wild-type (WT)
female in the same cage were used as a
control. Successful elimination of all five
genes was confirmed by genotyping and
western blot (Figure S1A). Mortality during
the perinatal period was unaltered, despite a consistent decrease
in body weight in 5ko mice (Student’s t test, p < 0.01, n = 20 5het,
n = 37 5ko) (Figure S1B). Likewise, MRI analysis did not demon-
strate wide-scale alteration in absolute volumes in regions
including the striatum, hippocampus, and motor cortex (Figures
S1C–S1F).
5ko Mice Develop Facial Lesions through Self-Injurious
Over-Grooming
While loss of kainate receptors throughout the CNS could poten-
tially result in deficits in a number of behaviors, we found the
most prominent effect on behavior in 5ko mice was evident start-
ing at 4–6 months when a subset of mice developed facial
lesions due to self-injurious over-grooming behavior (Figure 1A).
This was quantified as the number of bouts and the time spent
grooming by singly housed male mice (4 months old) monitored
in a novel cage for a period of 30 min. For 5ko mice, both mea-
sures were significantly enhanced in comparison to 5het mice
(p < 0.001, Student’s t test, n = 21 5ko, n = 12 5het) (Figures
1B and 1C). We found no evidence of altered grooming behavior
in mice lacking GluK2 (n = 7), the primary receptor subunit

 expressed in the striatum of adult mice, a region critical to
grooming behavior (Ahmari et al., 2013; Welch et al., 2007). Prior
work has demonstrated that excessive grooming in genetic or
induced mouse models of OCD can be reduced by the adminis-
tration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Ahmari
et al., 2013; Welch et al., 2007), a first line monotherapy for OCD.
Eight-week chronic administration of fluoxetine (Flxtn) to 5ko
mice (6 mg/100 mL in drinking water ad libitum) significantly
reduced grooming in 5ko mice compared to a vehicle cohort
treated over the same time period (p < 0.05, Student’s t test,
n = 8 per group) (Figure 1C).
To quantify repetitive behaviors without the potential compli-
cation of elevated anxiety in a novel environment, we monitored
mice in automated phenotyping cages that allow for extended
monitoring of undisturbed activity over days and across the circa-
dian cycle in a habituated environment. Male mice (4–6 months,
5ko n = 10, 5het n = 9) were housed in cages for 6 days, and, after
2 days of habituation, data were collected for 4 days. We quanti-
fied total ambulation or locomotion, as well as the fine-movement
counts that detect all stationary non-ambulatory repetitive move-
ment including grooming. Consistent with manual quantification,
automated counting detected more non-ambulatory activity,
fine-movement counts, in 5ko mice (F1,17 = 8.63, two-way
repeated-measures [RM] ANOVA, p < 0.01) (Figure 1D). The in-
crease in repetitive non-ambulatory activity varied across the
circadian cycle with similar counts for both groups during the
dark cycle but consistently elevated counts for the 5ko group dur-
ing the light period. Total activity during the lights-on period alone
was significantly higher in the 5ko group compared to controls
(Student’s t test, p < 0.01) (Figure 1E). Elevated fine-movement
activity was paralleled by an increase in total ambulatory move-
ment of the 5ko mice compared to 5het controls over the course
of the 4 testing days (Figure 1F). Again, the biggest differences
appeared during the lights-on period (Figures 1F and 1G)
(Student’s t test, p < 0.01). These data further revealed a differ-
ence in the circadian pattern of activity and demonstrated that
5ko mice have increased fine movement, including grooming
and ambulatory locomotion activity, particularly during the light
cycle when their control 5het counterparts have low activity
levels. As in human compulsive disorders, elevated compulsive
behavior in mice can be accompanied by increased anxiety-
related behavior (Shmelkov et al., 2010; Welch et al., 2007). How-
ever, we found no evidence of increased anxiety-like behavior in
the 5ko mice in either the open-field test (F1,23 = 0.62, two-way
RM ANOVA, p > 0.05, Figure S2A; Student’s t test. p > 0.0,5 Fig-
ure S2B) or the elevated zero maze (F1,15 = 1.295, two-way RM
ANOVA, p > 0.05, Figure S2D; Student’s t test p > 0.05,
Figure S2E).
5ko Mice Have Alterations in Perseveration and Other
Striatal-Dependent Behaviors
Over-grooming in mice can be a manifestation of elevated
perseverative behaviors; we therefore performed additional tests
to measure perseveration in 5ko mice. In the marble-burying
task, which is a measure of digging perseveration and repetitive
behavior (Thomas et al., 2009), we quantified total digging time
and the subsequent number of marbles buried in the bedding.
The 5ko cohort buried significantly more marbles and spent a
greater fraction of time during the test digging in comparison
to the 5het control cohort (p < 0.001 ANOVA, with Dunn-Sidak,
n = 21 5ko, n = 12 5het) (Figures 2A and 2B). Surprisingly, single
GluK2 knockout (KO) mice (n = 7) also had elevated marble
burying and increased digging time in comparison to the 5het
group (Figures 2A and 2B). As an additional test of perseverative
behavior, we measured spontaneous alternations made by mice
in the Y-maze (Yadin et al., 1991). In successive trials, both
GluK2 KO and 5het mice chose an alternate arm in the majority
of second trials, reflecting a natural exploratory behavior in ro-
dents (Figure 2C). However, 5ko mice showed no preference
for the alternative arm on a successive trial, selecting it in
45.8% ± 7.3%, of trials (Figure 2C) (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis
with Mann-Whitney U test, n = 8 per group). Therefore, consis-
tent with an elevated perseverative behavior phenotype, 5ko
mice showed a significant decrease in preference for the alter-
nate arm compared to GluK2 KO and 5het control mice.
The striatum has extensive connectivity with many different
cortical regions, from prefrontal and association cortexes to
sensorimotor regions. Consequently, alterations in striatal activ-
ity can lead to both increased perseverative behaviors (Welch
et al., 2007) and changes in simple motor function, leading us
to perform measures of motor coordination in the 5ko mice.
We found that a classic hindlimb-clasping response to tail sus-
pension, which has been observed in mice with striatal lesions
(Zhang et al., 2014), was prominent in 5ko mice. Quantifying
this behavior using a phenotype scoring system (Guyenet
et al., 2010) demonstrated that all 5ko mice showed hindlimb
clasping and scored 2 or 3 on the clasping scale. None of the
5het littermates showed any tail suspension-induced clasping
(Figures 2D and 2E) similar to WT animals and GluK2 KO mice
(data not shown). In addition, in a motor learning task on the
accelerating rotarod the performance of 5ko mice was signifi-
cantly impaired in comparison to 5het and GluK2 KO groups
(two-way ANOVA, F1,16 = 9.73, p < 0.001 for 5ko versus 5het;
two-way ANOVA, F1,18 = 9.25, p < 0.01 for 5ko versus
GluK2 KO) (Figure 2F); there was no difference in performance
between GluK2 KO and 5het mice (two-way ANOVA, F1, 8 =
0.94, p > 0.05).
For a detailed kinematic gait analysis, mice were placed on a
treadmill, and parameters of stride were extracted from the digi-
tized fore and hind-paw patterns at a fixed walking velocity of
14 cm s–1. There was no difference between 5het (n = 18) and
5ko (n = 12) mice in most stride parameters (see Table S1). How-
ever, 5ko mice displayed a significant decrease in brake time
(time from initial paw contact finishing the swing phase to
maximum paw contact) [Student’s t test, p < 0.05] and an in-
crease in propel time) (time from maximum paw contact to
the start of the swing phase) (Student’s t test, p < 0.0001).
Consequently, 5ko mice had a significantly higher propel:brake
ratio than 5het controls (Figure 2G). Similar changes have been
observed in mouse models of Huntington’s disease and demon-
strate that 5ko mice have altered rhythmicity in their gate (Wright
et al., 2015).
The behavioral phenotype in 5ko mice strongly suggests that
there are alterations in striatal function. Corticostriatal circuitry
disruption is often also associated with the core features of
autism (Pec
¸ a et al., 2011), including the perseverative behavior
1850
Cell Reports 18, 1848–1857, February 21, 2017
 that we have observed in 5ko mice. Therefore, we tested
whether 5ko mice displayed abnormalities in social interaction,
another autism-linked behavior. In a three-chamber social inter-
action assay during the habituation (phase 1) when both cham-
bers contained empty wired cups (E), both control groups
(n = 12) and 5ko mice (n = 9) spent a similar amount of time in
each of the compartment (Figure 2H, paired Student’s t test,
p > 0.05). When a novel social partner was introduced into one
side (phase 2), both groups spent more time in the mouse-con-
taining chamber (M) than the empty cup (E) (paired Student’s
t test, p < 0.01), and there was no significant difference between
the control group and 5ko group (Figure 2H, phase 2) (Student’s
t test, p > 0.05). Together these experiments demonstrate that
5ko mice have multiple alterations in perseverative behavior
and motor coordination, but there is dissociation from social
interaction behavior that is often disrupted by altering cortico-
striatal activity (Mei et al., 2016).
Corticostriatal Synaptic Transmission Is Altered in 5ko
Mice
The overt behavioral alterations in the 5ko mice are suggestive of
aberrant striatal function that is emergent when all the kainate
receptor subunits are eliminated. In juvenile mice, the GluK2
subunit is the principal subunit expressed in both D1 and D2
expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs), which are the major
class of projection neuron in the striatum (Chergui et al., 2000).
To confirm the presence of kainate receptors in SPNs, we
made single-cell, whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings from
visually identified neurons in acute slices of the dorsal striatum.
Application of kainic acid (10 mM) resulted in inward currents in

 SPN recordings from WT and 5het mice, whereas no current was
detected in recordings from 5ko animals (Figure 3A). Unlike
AMPA receptors, localization of kainate receptors to postsyn-
aptic densities is not ubiquitous in all neurons throughout the
CNS. Prior studies have found that there is a slow synaptic
current in SPNs that was not inhibited by AMPA and NMDA re-
ceptor antagonism (Chergui et al., 2000) but that was reduced
by the relatively selective kainate receptor blocker ACET (Viz-
carra-Chaco
´ n et al., 2013). We confirmed that kainate receptors
contribute to corticostriatal synaptic transmission by mediating
a small amplitude GYKI53655-resistant current that was partially
blocked by the non-selective AMPA/kainate receptor antago-
nist CNQX (n = 20 WT, n = 3 5ko) (Figures 3B and 3C). The
GYKI53655-resistant current in 5ko recordings was of equivalent
amplitude to the remaining current in WT mice after CNQX (Fig-
ure 3B), further demonstrating that kainate receptors contribute
to synaptic transmission at these synapses.
We tested whether corticostriatal function is disrupted in 5ko
mice in field recordings of inputs to the dorsal striatum. Input-
output relationships for corticostriatal transmission in 5ko and
control mice demonstrated that field population response ampli-
tudes were significantly reduced in the 5ko mice in comparison
to both WT mice (two-way ANOVA, F1,30 = 7.96, p < 0.01) and
5het controls (F1,27 = 5.59, p < 0.05), whereas there was no
significant difference in the field response between WT and
5het mice (F1,23 = 0.57, p > 0.05) (Figure 3D). As an additional
measure of synaptic integrity, we made voltage-clamp record-
ings from visually identified SPNs and isolated corticostriatal
excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). NMDA receptor and
AMPA receptor EPSCs were measured by recording at +40
and –70 mV, respectively. The NMDA:AMPA amplitude ratio
for WT mice (0.247 ± 0.028, n = 19) and for 5het mice (0.317 ±
0.042, n = 7) were significantly higher in 5ko mice (0.128 ±
0.036, n = 13, p < 0.05 5ko comparison, p < 0.01 5het compar-
ison Student’s t test) (Figures 3E and 3F), further supporting
alterations in corticostriatal synapses in 5ko mice. To determine
whether this aberrant synaptic function is present in other
brain regions, we recorded from synapses on CA3 neurons of
the hippocampus. Kainate receptors are present in the postsyn-
aptic densities at the mossy fiber (MF) input on the proximal
dendrites of CA3 neurons, but excluded from the more
distal associational/commissural (A/C) synapses (Straub et al.,
2016). NMDA:AMPA ratios recorded from 5ko mice were not
significantly different to those in 5het mice in either of these syn-
aptic inputs (n = 13 A/C 5het, n = 12 A/C 5ko; n = 10 5het MF,
n = 9 5ko MF) (Figures 3G–3J), suggesting that kainate receptors
play differential roles in the development and stabilization of
synaptic contacts in different neuronal types.
Striatal Synapse Density Is Reduced in 5ko Mice
Kainate receptors interact with several components of the post-
synaptic density (PSD) including PSD95 (Garcia et al., 1998).
Because the 5ko mice show behavioral phenotypes similar to
those in Sapap3 KO mice (Welch et al., 2007), we tested for an
association between these proteins. In a recombinant expres-
sion system, the GluK2 subunit interacted with Sapap3 only
when PSD95 was cotransfected (Figure S3A). Endogenous Sa-
pap was also detected after co-immunoprecipitation with both
GluK2 and PSD95 from striatal homogenates (Figure S3B).
Because these data demonstrate that kainate receptors are an
integral part of the postsynaptic complex in striatal synapses,
it is possible that loss of the receptors can lead to disorganization
of the PSD. Electron micrographs of tissue from the dorsal
striatum did not reveal any difference in the PSD length of indi-
vidual synapses when comparing 5het and 5ko mice (Figures
S3C and S3D); however, the PSD thickness was significantly
reduced in 5ko mice (5het n = 59, 5ko n = 74, p < 0.01 Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov [KS] test) (Figure S3E).
To further investigate alterations in SPN synapses, we per-
formed two-photon imaging of live SPNs in dorsal striatal slices
and used post hoc molecular characterization to identify the
neuron type unequivocally. SPNs can be segregated into two
populations based upon their projections to the substantia nigra
pars reticulata (D1R expressing) or globus pallidus (D2R ex-
pressing) in the basal ganglia (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011). We
collected the cytoplasmic contents of each recorded neuron
and performed single-cell RT-PCR for markers of D1 AND D2
SPNs (see Experimental Procedures). Analysis of spine density
(secondary and tertiary dendritic segments 50–200 mm from
the soma) revealed a significant decrease in spine number in
5ko mice in both D1 (n = 7 5het, n = 6 5ko) and D2 identified
cell types (n = 6 per group) (Student’s t test p < 0.05) (Figures
4A, 4B, and 4D). In contrast, analysis of dendritic segments of
CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus showed no differ-
ence in the density of CA3 spines in the 5ko mice (n = 7 5ko,
n = 5 5het), suggesting a specific effect of loss of kainate recep-
tors on striatal synapses (Figures 4C and 4D). A reduction in
spine density may result in a decrease in the number of excit-
atory synapses; therefore, we performed electrophysiological
recordings from post hoc identified SPNs to measure miniature
EPSCs (mEPSCs). We found that there was a significant
decrease in the frequency of mEPSC events in both D1 and D2
SPNs in 5ko mice (p < 0.05 Student’s t test, n = 10 D2 5het,
n = 8 D2 5ko, n = 8 D1 5het, n = 8 D1 5ko) (Figures 4E
and 4G), whereas the amplitude of recorded events was not
different in either cell type (Figures 4E and 4F). These results
demonstrate that there are both functional and structural alter-
ations in synapses in the striatum and, together with the behav-
ioral data, show that loss of all kainate receptor subunits has a
major impact on corticostriatal function.
DISCUSSION
Emergent Perseverative Behavior and Motor
Dysfunction in 5ko Mice
A growing number of mutations in glutamate receptor genes
have been associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric
conditions, which is consistent with their prominent role in medi-
ating and modulating synaptic transmission. Genetic analysis
studies indicate that kainate receptors might be involved in the
pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases linked to striatal
dysfunction, including OCD (Delorme et al., 2004; Mattheisen
et al., 2015; Sampaio et al., 2010). Analysis of individual kainate
receptor subunit mutant mice provided experimental support for
some of these genetic associations and discovered significant
behavioral alterations consistent with roles for altered kainate

 receptor signaling in neuropsychiatric disorders. For example,
GluK2 KO mice exhibit behaviors analogous to mania, including
increased risk taking, increased aggression, and less despair-
like behavior (Shaltiel et al., 2008). GluK4 KO mice show reduced
anxiety relative to their wild-type counterparts as well as a reduc-
tion in learned helplessness and increase in hedonic behavior
(Catches et al., 2012). Conversely, increasing gene expression
of Grik4 in the cortex and striatum increased anhedonic, anxiety,
and depressive behaviors (Aller et al., 2015). These studies sup-
port human genetic studies that link variants in kainate receptor
genes to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Knight et al., 2012;
Pickard et al., 2008; Whalley et al., 2009). While these studies
have been instructive in demonstrating a link to human disease,
the dissection of the role of each of the subunits with a knockout
approach has gone only part way to fully describing the roles of
kainate receptors at synapses and their effects on behavior. This
is a particular concern for kainate receptors, because native
receptors are likely assembled from multiple subunits ex-
pressed in diverse pattern that changes over the course of devel-
opment (Bahn et al., 1994; Wisden and Seeburg, 1993), making it
uncertain whether all kainate receptor signaling is disrupted
throughout the life of the animal in any particular brain region in

 the single-subunit knockout studies. Additionally kainate recep-
tors have been proposed as therapeutic targets for a number of
neurological disorders (Lerma and Marques, 2013; Yuan et al.,
2015), yet the lack of available pharmacology has not allowed
investigation of a pan-kainate receptor blocker on cellular,
circuit, or behavioral function. To address these potential con-
founds, we generated mice that lack expression of all five sub-
units of the kainate receptor (5ko mice).
We were surprised to find that this approach uncovered a
strong emergent behavioral alteration in striatal-dependent pre-
servative behavior and motor function. The 5ko mice have a strik-
ingphenotype involvingself-injurious over-groomingand,consis-
tent with striatal dysfunction, elevations in digging behavior and
perseveration in a Y-maze choice test (Burguie
` re et al., 2015).
The mice also had multiple alterations in motor behaviors with a
classic hindlimb-clasping phenotype, impairments in the accel-
erating rotarod, and alterations in gait. Kainate receptors are
expressed in striatal neurons, yet little is known about their contri-
bution to synaptic transmission (Chergui et al., 2000; Vizcarra-
Chaco
´ n et al., 2013). We found that corticostriatal synaptic trans-
mission in the dorsal striatum was impaired, with changes in the
NMDA:AMPA ratio, as well as reductions in the field potential
response and lower mEPSC frequencies, both suggesting the
existence of fewer excitatory synapses. We did not detect a
change in amplitude of mEPSCs, suggesting that the quantal ef-
ficacy of individual synapses was not altered. Therefore, the
simplest explanation for the reduced NMDA:AMPA ratio would
be that the NMDA component of individual striatal synapses is
reduced in 5ko mice. Alterations in the NMDA:AMPA ratio are
observed in several animal models and could be a cellular corre-
late of repetitive grooming and perseverative behavior (Blundell
et al., 2010). These data focus attention on the importance of kai-
nate receptors to the development of striatal circuits and their
prominent effect on disrupting striatal-dependent behaviors.
This study also raises the possibility of multiple different roles
for kainate receptors in regulating striatal activity and the devel-
opment of striatal circuits. GluK2-containing receptors are
required for expression of ionotropic kainate receptor currents
in SPNs of adult/juvenile mice (Chergui et al., 2000). However,
the studies here demonstrate that loss of GluK2 alone is not suf-
ficient to reproduce many of striatal-dependent behavioral defi-
cits seen in 5ko mice. This could indicate that compensation by
other receptor subunits occurs in the single knockout or that
other kainate receptor subunits play a role in early striatal devel-
opment. In fact, there is evidence of a more diverse population of
kainate receptor subunits expressed in the striatum in the em-
bryo and during early postnatal development than is found in
the adult (Bahn et al., 1994). However, the approach of making
constitutive deletion of all the kainate receptor genes throughout
the life of the animal does not allow us to clarify whether kainate
receptor loss during development is the primary cause of the
phenotype, or whether ongoing kainate receptor signaling in
adult mice is required for proper striatal function. Likewise
another limitation of this approach is that, while the data are
strongly suggestive, we are not able to unequivocally determine
that the synaptic disruptions are due to cell-autonomous pro-
cesses resulting from loss of kainate receptor signaling in
SPNs. Approaches in the future such as conditional ablation of
receptor genes at different developmental time points will be
needed to clarify these issues.
5ko Mice Parallel Characteristics of Mouse Models of
Compulsive Disorders
The striatum forms the major input structure of the basal ganglia
and SPNs integrate convergent information to control planning
and modulation of movement. Human and animal studies show
that striatal circuits are critical to perseverative and habitual be-
haviors, and alteration of synaptic transmission in this region un-
derlies the pathophysiology of OCD (Burguie
` re et al., 2015).
Recently, studies in knockout mice have demonstrated that loss
of proteins specifically associated with excitatory synapses,
suchasthescaffoldingmoleculesSapap3 andShank3,alterstria-
tal glutamate signaling and cause OCD-like behavior, similar to
that observed in 5ko mice. Sapap3 is enriched in the striatum
and ablation of this molecule in mice results in over-grooming
behavior and selective deficits in corticostriatal synaptic trans-
mission (Welch et al., 2007). We found evidence that native kai-
nate receptors associate with Sapap co-immunoprecipitating
from striatal homogenates. Shank3 also interacts with Sapap
and potentially exists in a complex with PSD95 and glutamate
receptors. Shank3 KO mice display self-injurious grooming,
reduced corticostriatal transmission, and reduced spine density
in SPNs similar to the behavioral and synaptic perturbations in
5ko mice. Given the overlapping phenotype between 5ko mice
and these other mouse models of OCD and autism, it will be
important to assess kainate receptorgenesin thecontext of these
disorders. Indeed, there have been several studies suggesting
that kainate receptors are candidate genes for OCD (Sampaio
et al., 2010) and autism susceptibility (Delorme et al., 2004; Ja-
mainet al.,2002).Theemergentphenotypein5komicefurtherun-
derlines the known association between kainate receptor genes
and perseverative and autistic-like traits in human disorders.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Animals were group housed with 14-hr:10-hr light/dark cycle. Food and water
were provided ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the Northwestern
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Self-Grooming Manual Scoring
Individual mice (4–6 months) were habituated to a new standard mouse cage
with a 0.5-cm layer of bedding to reduce neophobia then video-taped for
30 min undisturbed. Cumulative time spent grooming for each mouse was
scored with a stopwatch.
Automated Grooming and Movement
Mice (male 4–6 months) were individually housed in metabolic PhenoMaster
chambers for 6 days on a 12-hr:12-hr lighting schedule. After 2 days of habit-
uation, automated acquisition of several parameters including fine-movement
counts and ambulatory locomotor activity were monitored continuously over
the entire period.
Marble-Burying Test
24 dark marbles were placed on top of wood chip bedding (3 cm deep) in six
rows in a cage placed in a brightly lit, open area. Animals remained in the
testing cage for 15 min. Mice were manually scored for digging time using a
stopwatch. At the end of the test period, counts were made of the number
of marbles buried by more than two-thirds of their diameter.
Spontaneous Alternations in the Y-maze
Mice were tested over 6 days with one trial per day. Mice were placed in
the starting gate for 30 s and allowed to explore the maze. Once the
Cell Reports 18, 1848–1857, February 21, 2017
1855
 mouse made a choice between the two arms, the entrance to the arm was
blocked, and the mouse remained in the blocked arm for 30 s. The mouse
was immediately placed back at the start and allowed to explore the maze
again. The choice of arm on the subsequent test was scored as either 1
(same arm) or 0 (alternate arm).
Hindlimb Clasping
Hindlimb clasping analysis was carried out according to prior studies (Guyenet
et al., 2010). Mice were lifted by the base of the tail, and hindlimb position was
observed for 10 s.
Rotarod Test
Mice were placed on the rotarod, and the initial revolution speed set to 4 rpm
for 120 s. The rotarod them accelerated at a rate of 0.12 rpm s–1 for the next
300 s, Mice were subjected to three trials per day for 4 consecutive days
with an �30-min inter-trial interval.
Gait Analysis
Automated measurements of mouse gait were measured as mice walked on a
treadmill at constant velocity of 17 cm s–1. Swing and stride parameters were
determined from a 5-s video.
Three-Chamber Social Interaction Test
In phase 1 of the test, mice were introduced to the middle compartment (C) of
a three-chamber apparatus. Mice were allowed 6 min to freely explore left and
right chambers, each containing an empty wired cup (E1 and E2). In phase 2, a
juvenile mouse of the same gender was placed in the wired cup in the left
compartment (M). Test animals were allowed to freely navigate the apparatus
and tracked by a video tracking system.
Western Blots and Co-immunoprecipitation
Synaptoneurosomes were prepared using similar procedures to those previ-
ously described (Antion et al., 2010). Cell-culture, transfection, immunoprecip-
itation, and western blot analysis were performed as described previously (Gill
et al., 2009). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PSD-95 (Affinity
BioReagents, MA1-046), anti-GluK2/3 antibody (Chemicon, AB5683), and
anti-PAN-SAPAP (NeuroMab, N127/31).
Slice Procedure and Electrophysiological Recording
Parasagittal or coronal slices containing the dorsal striatum or horizontal hip-
pocampal slices were prepared using techniques modified from those previ-
ously described (Xu et al., 2014). Individual slices were transferred to a
recording chamber and visualized. Extracellular striatal field responses were
evoked using a monopolar electrode filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(ACSF) placed in the white matter between the cortex and the striatum.
For whole-cell experiments, SPNs were visually identified and were voltage
clamped at �70 mV for measurement of AMPA current (peak) and +40 mV
for measurement of NMDA currents (measured in a 2.5-ms window, 60 ms af-
ter the onset of the current) in the presence of the GABAA receptor antagonist
bicuculline (10 mM). Kainate-mediated currents were isolated by the addition of
the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI53655 (50 mM) and NMDA receptor
antagonist D-APV (50 mM). Miniature events (mEPSCs) were recorded in
the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 mM), D-APV (50 mM), and bicuculline
(10 mM).
Single-Cell RT-PCR
For single-cell gene profiling, the intracellular contents of the recorded cells
were harvested in the patch electrode after completion of the experiment.
Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript VILO kit (Invitrogen).
cDNA was amplified by PCR using substance P, enkephalin, and b-actin
primer pairs. D1 neurons were characterized by the presence of a substance
P band, a b-actin band and the absence of the enkephalin band. D2 cells
were characterized by presence of enkephalin band, b-actin band, and the
absence of the substance P band.
Two-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy
Patch-clamp recordings were made from visually identified spiny projection
neurons including Alexa Fluor 568 dye (50 mM) in the internal solution. Fluores-
cent images were acquired with picosecond pulsed excitation at 790 nM.
Maximum projection images of the soma and dendritic field were acquired
with 0.19-mm2 pixels with 15.2-ms pixel dwell time. Approximately 60 images
were taken with 0.7-mm focal steps. Images were deconvolved using the Iter-
ative Deconvolve 3D plugin for ImageJ, and semi-automated spine counting
was performed using three-dimensional reconstructions in NeuronStudio.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted with Microsoft Excel, GraphPad Prism,
OriginPro9.0, and MATLAB software. For continuously distributed data, two-
sample comparisons were made using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s
t test or for multiple comparisons a repeated two-way ANOVA followed by
post hoc Sidak’s correction was performed. For ordinal data, a Kruskal-Wallis
test followed by a Mann-Whitney U test was used where indicated. Differences
were considered significant when p < 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± SEM.
