Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum 
of liver disorders linked to metabolic syndrome, ranging from sim-
ple fatty liver to more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
(1–3). It has been estimated that over a third of the adult population 
and approximately 5%–10% of children in the US develop fatty liv-
er. Hepatic steatosis results from a combination of adipose tissue 
dysfunction and dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism in an 
insulin-resistant state. NASH is characterized by the presence of 
persistent liver injury, chronic inflammation, and liver fibrosis. 
The latter is a wound-healing response that is activated follow-
ing liver injury and potentially reversible at early stages (4). The 
transition from relatively benign hepatic steatosis to NASH marks 
a critical step in NAFLD progression that has important clinical 
implications, particularly the risk for end-stage liver disease, such 
as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (5, 6). Multiple patho-
genic drivers have been implicated in NASH initiation and pro-
gression, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
lipotoxicity, and immune cell activation (7–10). Despite this, the 
physiological mechanisms that defend against NASH progression 
remain poorly defined.
Liver injury as a result of hepatocyte death is at the center of 
many chronic liver diseases. Clinical and animal model studies 
have demonstrated that hepatocyte death is an important driv-
er of liver disease progression (11–13). Aberrantly elevated liver 
cell death is linked to activation of liver regeneration and wound 
repair program, resulting in persistent inflammation and liver 
fibrosis that increase risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. Several 
forms of hepatocyte death have been observed in the liver, includ-
ing apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis. Hepatocyte apoptosis is 
a well-recognized cell death pathway in NASH. Mice with genet-
ic deletion of caspase 8 in hepatocytes exhibited attenuated liver 
injury, inflammation, and fibrosis following methionine/choline- 
deficient (MCD) diet feeding (14). Caspase inhibitors have been 
shown to be protective in animal models of NASH (15, 16). Necro-
ptosis is programmed necrosis that incorporates features of both 
apoptosis and necrosis (17, 18). The execution of necroptosis 
requires receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIPK3) and its substrate, 
mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Upon RIPK3 
activation, MLKL undergoes phosphorylation, oligomerization, 
and translocation to the plasma membrane, leading to membrane 
permeabilization and cell death. Necroptosis releases intracellu-
lar danger-associated molecular patterns, such as high-mobility 
group B1 (HMGB1), that have potential to trigger robust inflam-
matory response (13, 19). RIPK3 deficiency attenuates liver inju-
ry, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in an MCD diet–induced 
NASH mouse model, implicating necroptosis in the liver as a 
contributor to NASH (20, 21). As such, targeting hepatocyte cell 
death may provide an effective approach to alleviating or revers-
ing NASH progression (22).
Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) is a member of the EGF-like family of 
extracellular ligands that is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue 
(23–25). We previously demonstrated that Nrg4 binds to hepato-
cytes, activates ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, and 
attenuates hepatic lipogenic response (25). Nrg4 deficiency exacer-
bates, whereas its Tg expression protects mice from, diet-induced 
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by progressive liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis; however, the 
mechanisms that govern the transition from hepatic steatosis, which is relatively benign, to NASH remain poorly defined. 
Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) is an adipose tissue–enriched endocrine factor that elicits beneficial metabolic effects in obesity. Here, we 
show that Nrg4 is a key component of an endocrine checkpoint that preserves hepatocyte health and counters diet-induced 
NASH in mice. Nrg4 deficiency accelerated liver injury, fibrosis, inflammation, and cell death in a mouse model of NASH. 
In contrast, transgenic expression of Nrg4 in adipose tissue alleviated diet-induced NASH. Nrg4 attenuated hepatocyte 
death in a cell-autonomous manner by blocking ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of c-FLIPL, a negative regulator 
of cell death. Adeno-associated virus–mediated (AAV-mediated) rescue of hepatic c-FLIPL expression in Nrg4-deficent 
mice functionally restored the brake for steatosis to NASH transition. Thus, hepatic Nrg4 signaling serves as an endocrine 
checkpoint for steatosis-to-NASH progression by activating a cytoprotective pathway to counter stress-induced liver injury.

cellular liver fibrosis that was associated with induction of genes 
involved in inflammation and fibrosis, increased abundance of 
F4/80-positive macrophages, and the presence of TUNEL-posi-
tive cells (Figure 1, C and E, and Supplemental Figure 1, E and F). 
Immunoblotting analysis of liver lysates revealed that CASP3 and 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (apoptosis) and 
MLKL phosphorylation (necroptosis) were induced by NASH diet 
feeding (Figure 1F). Similarly to what occurred in human NASH 
livers, phosphorylation of JNK was increased, whereas c-FLIPL 
protein levels were reduced in the livers from NASH diet–fed mice. 
In contrast, protein levels of the short isoform c-FLIPR remained 
similar. These observations demonstrate that NASH diet feed-
ing recapitulates key pathologic events of human NASH in mice, 
including liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in the context 
of obesity. Interestingly, mRNA expression of Nrg4 in epididymal 
white adipose tissue (eWAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) was 
significantly decreased in NASH mice (Figure 1G). These results 
are consistent with recent work that demonstrates an inverse rela-
tionship between plasma Nrg4 levels and NASH scores in human 
patients (27). As Nrg4 is a fat-derived endocrine factor that acts 
on the liver, these findings raise the possibility that reduced Nrg4 
signaling may contribute to the disruption of tissue homeostasis 
during steatosis-to-NASH progression.
Nrg4 deficiency exacerbates diet-induced NASH in mice. We 
previously demonstrated that Nrg4 protects mice from high-fat 
diet–induced (HFD-induced) metabolic disorders, including insu-
lin resistance and hepatic steatosis (25). However, HFD feeding 
does not cause significant liver injury and fibrosis and is therefore 
inadequate for interrogating the role of Nrg4 in NASH. We next 
performed studies in Nrg4 gain- and loss-of-function mouse mod-
els in the context of diet-induced NASH. WT and Nrg4-KO mice 
were fed standard chow or NASH diet for approximately 20 weeks. 
Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, plasma ALT and AST, and mRNA 
expression of genes involved in liver fibrosis and inflammation 
were similar between 2 groups under chow-fed conditions (Sup-
plemental Figure 2, A–D). Following NASH diet feeding, Nrg4-KO 
mice had slightly higher liver triacylglycerol (TAG) content than 
control (Figure 2A). While the number of lipid droplets in hepato-
cytes was comparable, lipid droplets were slightly larger in mice 
lacking Nrg4 (Supplemental Figure 2, E and F). The exacerbation 
of hepatic steatosis by Nrg4 deficiency was less marked compared 
with what was observed in mice fed HFD, which does not contain 
fructose and cholesterol. Plasma levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1, 
the biomarkers of liver injury, were significantly elevated in Nrg4-
KO mice following NASH feeding (Figure 2A). Nrg4-null mice 
exhibited more severe liver fibrosis, as revealed by sirius red stain-
ing and measurements of liver hydroxyproline content (Figure 2, 
B and C). Nrg4 deficiency also resulted in increased abundance of 
F4/80-positive macrophages and TUNEL-positive cells. Immuno-
blotting analysis indicated that CASP3 and PARP cleavage, MLKL 
phosphorylation, and JNK activation were strongly increased in 
Nrg4-KO mouse livers (Figure 2D). In contrast, c-FLIPL protein 
levels were markedly reduced by Nrg4 deficiency.
Transcriptional profiling analysis identified 2 clusters of upreg-
ulated and downregulated genes in Nrg4-null mouse livers. Gene 
ontology analysis indicated that the upregulated genes are high-
ly enriched for extracellular matrix, wound healing, and colla-
metabolic disorders. Interestingly, plasma Nrg4 levels inversely 
correlated with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD in 2 recent stud-
ies (26, 27). Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that 
polymorphisms in the ERBB4 locus are associated with obesity, 
diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy (28–30), illustrating a poten-
tial contribution of the Nrg4/ErbB4 pathway to the pathogene-
sis of metabolic disorders. Despite this, whether Nrg4 signaling 
regulates the transition from hepatic steatosis to NASH has not 
been explored. Using a diet-induced NASH model, we uncovered 
an unexpected function of Nrg4 in protecting hepatocytes from 
stress-induced cell death and attenuating NASH in mice. Mech-
anistically, Nrg4 exerts its cytoprotective effects on hepatocytes 
through attenuating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 
of cellular FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR, referred to as 
c-FLIPL hereafter), a negative regulator of apoptotic and necroptot-
ic cell death (31, 32). These observations establish hepatic Nrg4 
signaling as an endocrine checkpoint for steatosis-to-NASH pro-
gression and reveal a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
Results
Human and mouse NASH is linked to increased apoptosis and necro-
ptosis in the liver. Hepatocyte death is at the center of the transi-
tion from relatively benign hepatic steatosis to NASH. The latter 
is characterized by persistent liver injury, chronic inflammation, 
and progressive liver fibrosis. Despite the prominent role of cell 
death in NASH pathogenesis, the physiological cues that preserve 
hepatocyte health and tissue homeostasis of the liver under met-
abolic stress conditions remain poorly understood. To address 
this, we first investigated the nature of hepatocyte death in human 
NASH patients and in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH. Com-
pared with non-NASH individuals, the levels of cleaved caspase 3 
(CASP3) and phosphorylated MLKL (p–MLKL-S358), molecular 
markers of apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively, were mark-
edly elevated in liver biopsies from a cohort of NASH patients 
(33) (Figure 1A). The induction of cell death in NASH livers was 
associated with increased phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and reduced 
protein levels of c-FLIPL, an inhibitor of apoptotic and necroptot-
ic cell death. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene-expression analysis 
indicated that mRNA expression of genes involved in inflamma-
tion and fibrosis was markedly increased in the liver from NASH 
patients (Figure 1B).
We next evaluated a recently described high-fat high-fructose 
diet (NASH diet) in inducing key aspects of NASH pathology in 
mice (34). We fed a cohort of WT C57BL/6J mice standard chow 
or NASH diet for approximately 20 weeks. NASH diet–fed mice 
developed obesity and severe hepatic steatosis (Figure 1C and 
Supplemental Figure 1, A and B; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI96324DS1). 
Hepatic lipid droplet number and size were markedly increased 
following NASH diet feeding (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D). 
Compared with chow, plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were markedly high-
er in mice fed a NASH diet (Figure 1D). Plasma concentration of 
high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a danger-associated molec-
ular pattern released by dead cells, was also significantly higher 
in the NASH group than control (Figure 1D). Sirius red staining of 
liver sections indicated that NASH diet–fed mice developed peri-

Tnfa, Il1b, Il12b, Nos2, Ccl2, Ccl5, and Adgre1 (F4/80), was sig-
nificantly elevated in the livers from Nrg4-null mice (Figure 2F).

signals, most notably lipotoxicity and proinflammatory cytokines. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that treatments of primary 
hepatocytes with a combination of palmitic acid (PA) and TNF-α 
(PA/TNF-α) robustly triggered cell death that mimics NASH- 
induced liver injury (21, 37). To investigate whether Nrg4 plays a 
direct role in the regulation of hepatocyte death, we treated pri-
mary hepatocytes transduced with GFP or ErbB4 adenovirus with 
PA/TNF-α. As expected, PA/TNF-α treatment increased CASP3 
and PARP cleavage and MLKL phosphorylation in hepatocytes 
transduced with Ad-GFP, indicative of induction of apoptotic and 
necroptotic cell death in response to PA and TNF-α (Figure 4B). 
Nrg4 treatment strongly attenuated cell death markers in primary 
hepatocytes expressing ErbB4. We measured the release of lac-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH) into culture media as an indicator of 
hepatocyte death (38). LDH release by primary hepatocytes was 
markedly increased in response to PA/TNF-α treatment (Figure 
4C). Activation of Nrg4 signaling strongly attenuated LDH release 
induced by PA/TNF-α. Further, flow cytometry analysis using 
annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) costaining indicated that PA/
TNF-α treatment increased the frequency of apoptotic (annexin V 
positive and PI negative) and dead (double positive) cells, which 
was significantly alleviated by Nrg4 (Figure 4, D and E). Similar 
protective effects of Nrg4 were also observed in transduced Hepa 
1 hepatoma cells stably expressing ErbB4 (Figure 4, F and G, and 
Supplemental Figure 4, A–C).
c-FLIPL is a cell death inhibitory protein that has been shown 
to suppress both apoptosis and necroptosis and protect against 
liver injury in mice (39–41). As shown above, c-FLIPL protein lev-
el was reduced in Nrg4-null mouse livers, but elevated by Nrg4-
Tg expression in adipose tissue. These observations suggest that 
c-FLIPL may be a downstream effector of Nrg4 that links Nrg4/
ErbB4 signaling to hepatocyte death. Interestingly, c-FLIP mRNA 
expression in Nrg4-null and -Tg mouse livers remained largely 
unchanged (Figure 2F and Figure 3D), suggesting that Nrg4 may 
regulate c-FLIPL protein levels through posttranslational mech-
anisms. In support of this, we found that endogenous c-FLIPL 
protein levels were reduced in hepatoma cells in response to PA/
TNF-α treatment without affecting c-Flip mRNA levels (Figure 5A 
and Supplemental Figure 5A). Nrg4 treatment stimulated AKT 
phosphorylation, attenuated JNK phosphorylation, and nearly 
completely blocked the decrease of c-FLIPL protein expression by 
PA/TNF-α treatment. Cycloheximide (CHX) chase studies indi-
cated that Nrg4 increased the half-life of c-FLIPL in hepatoma 
cells (Figure 5B). Accordingly, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 
blocked PA/TNF-α–induced decrease of c-FLIPL (Figure 5C), con-
sistent with a posttranslational mechanism of regulation.
We next performed studies in Hepa 1 cells stably expressing 
ErbB4 using a retroviral vector to dissect the role of c-FLIPL in medi-
ating the cytoprotective activity of Nrg4. Interestingly, c-FLIPL 
protein level was markedly reduced, whereas CASP3 cleavage and 
MLKL phosphorylation were stimulated, in response to PA/TNF-α 
treatment (Figure 5D). The effects of PA/TNF-α on c-FLIPL pro-
tein level and cell death markers were partially reversed by Nrg4 
treatment. Further, adenovirus-mediated expression of c-FLIPL 
greatly diminished PA/TNF-α–induced apoptotic and necroptotic 
cell death. These results were confirmed by LDH release and flow 
cytometry analyses (Figure 5, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 
and IL-17 have recently been implicated in promoting steatohepa-
titis and liver fibrosis (35). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that 
the populations of Th17 cells and RORγt+CD4+ T cells were sig-
nificantly increased in Nrg4-null mouse livers (Figure 2G). These 
results suggest that increased Th17 cell infiltration and IL-17 sig-
naling may contribute to the exacerbation of NASH phenotypes 
in Nrg4-null mice. Together, these data demonstrate that Nrg4 
signaling protects mice from diet-induced NASH and that its defi-
ciency exacerbates key pathogenic events of NASH.
Tg restoration of the Nrg4 endocrine axis protects mice from 
NASH. Having established that Nrg4 deficiency is causally linked 
to NASH, we next explored whether Tg restoration of Nrg4 signal-
ing is sufficient to ameliorate diet-induced NASH in mice. We fed 
WT and fat-specific Nrg4-Tg mice standard chow or NASH diet 
for approximately 20 weeks. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, plas-
ma ALT and AST, and mRNA expression of genes involved in liver 
fibrosis and inflammation were similar between 2 groups follow-
ing chow feeding (Supplemental Figure 3, A–D). Following NASH 
diet feeding, Nrg4-Tg mice had moderately lower liver fat content 
(Figure 3A), slightly smaller lipid droplets in hepatocytes (Supple-
mental Figure 3, E and F), and significantly lower plasma ALT, 
AST, and HMGB1 levels (Figure 3A), suggesting that Tg expression 
of Nrg4 may improve NASH diet–induced liver injury. In support 
of this, liver fibrosis and hydroxyproline content were significantly 
reduced in Tg mouse livers (Figure 3, B and C). Immunofluores-
cence staining revealed that the abundance of F4/80+ macrophage 
and TUNEL-positive cells was reduced in Tg mice, indicative of 
attenuated liver inflammation and hepatocyte death. Consistently, 
mRNA expression of genes involved in hepatic inflammation and 
fibrosis was significantly downregulated in Nrg4-Tg mouse livers, 
accompanied by reduced population of Th17 cells and RORγt+CD4+ 
T cells (Figure 3, D and E). Nrg4-Tg mouse livers exhibited 
reduced CASP3 and PARP cleavage and MLKL phosphorylation 
(Figure 3F). The levels of phosphorylated JNK were lower in Tg 
livers, whereas c-FLIPL protein levels were elevated in the livers 
of Nrg4-Tg mice. The strikingly opposite effects of Nrg4 deficien-
cy and Tg expression on diet-induced NASH illustrate a crucial 
role of Nrg4 in serving as an endocrine checkpoint for steatosis- 
to-NASH progression. Given that Nrg4 manipulations only mod-
erately affect the severity of hepatic steatosis, our results suggest 
that Nrg4 may exert cytoprotective functions on hepatocytes inde-
pendently of its regulation of lipid metabolism.
Nrg4 signaling protects hepatocytes from stress-induced cell death 
through c-FLIPL. Hepatocyte death is at the center of NASH ini-
tiation and progression, triggering chronic inflammation and 
fibrosis in the liver. The findings that liver injury was increased 
in Nrg4-null mice while attenuated in Nrg4-Tg mice prompted 
us to investigate whether Nrg4 directly modulates hepatocyte 
death. Previous work has demonstrated that liver expresses all 
ErbB receptors except ErbB2 (36). However, ErbB4 expression 
in primary hepatocyte culture is relatively low. We reconstituted 
Nrg4/ErbB4 signaling by transducing primary hepatocytes with 
a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing ErbB4, as previously 
described (25). As expected, recombinant Nrg4 dose-dependent-
ly stimulated ErbB4 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and AKT 
phosphorylation in transduced primary hepatocytes (Figure 4A). 
NASH-associated hepatocyte death results from an array of stress

4D). We did not observe further improvement of cell viability by 
Nrg4 in c-FLIPL–overexpressing hepatoma cells, suggesting that 
the protective effects of Nrg4 are largely mediated by its induction 
of c-FLIPL protein expression.
Nrg4 attenuates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of 
c-FLIPL. We performed ubiquitination assay to determine wheth-
er PA/TNF-α and Nrg4 play an antagonistic role in c-FLIPL ubiq-
uitination. As shown in Figure 6A, PA/TNF-α treatment induced 
robust polyubiquitination of c-FLIPL that was largely reversed by 
Nrg4 treatment. We next determined whether AKT activation by 
Nrg4 is required for its regulation of c-FLIPL protein stability. We 
performed PA/TNF-α and Nrg4 treatments without or with AKTi, 
a specific AKT inhibitor. The ability of Nrg4 to attenuate c-FLIPL 
ubiquitination in response to PA/TNF-α treatment was great-
ly diminished in the presence of AKTi (Figure 6B). As a result, 
Nrg4 failed to stabilize c-FLIPL protein and suppress PA/TNF-α–
induced cell death, as shown by CASP3 cleavage, MLKL phos-
phorylation, and LDH release (Figure 6, B–D). On the contrary, 
inhibition of JNK kinase activity blocked the induction of c-FLIPL 
ubiquitination by PA/TNF-α treatment, leading to improved 
cell viability (Figure 6, E and F). Nrg4 treatment did not further 
decrease c-FLIPL ubiquitination. As such, Nrg4 exerts opposing

effects on the AKT and JNK signaling pathways to regulate c-FLIPL 
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in response to PA/
TNF-α. Further, the reciprocal regulation of c-FLIPL protein levels 
in Nrg4-KO and -Tg mouse livers likely reflects cell-autonomous 
action of Nrg4 in hepatocytes.
Previous work has identified Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 
(Itch) as a JNK-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase for c-FLIPL (42). To 
investigate whether Itch is required for ubiquitination and pro-
teasomal degradation of c-FLIPL in response to PA/TNF-α, we 
knocked down Itch in Hepa 1 cells using 2 independent siRNA 
pools against Itch. Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of Itch did 
not appear to affect c-FLIPL ubiquitination and degradation and 
PA/TNF-α–induced cell death (Supplemental Figure 5, B and C). 
These results suggest that it is unlikely that Itch is the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase responsible for PA/TNF-α–induced c-FLIPL ubiquitination.
Restoration of hepatic c-FLIPL expression blocks steatosis-to- 
NASH progression due to Nrg4 deficiency. The above studies illus-
trate the nature of molecular signaling that links Nrg4 signaling to 
regulation of c-FLIPL protein stability and hepatocyte cell death. A 
key prediction of this model is that restoration of hepatic c-FLIPL 
protein expression will improve diet-induced NASH in mice due 
to Nrg4 deficiency. To test this, we generated a c-FLIPL expression 
vector using adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 8 under the con-
trol of the liver-specific thyroid hormone-binding globulin (Tbg) 
promoter. Tail vein injection of AAV–c-FLIPL elevated c-FLIPL 
expression specifically in the liver, but not other tissues, such as 
adipose tissue, spleen, and lung (Supplemental Figure 6A). We 
fed WT and Nrg4-null mice NASH diet for 8 weeks and transduc-
ed these mice with control AAV-GFP or AAV–c-FLIPL virus. Four 
treatment groups were obtained: WT mice injected with AAV-

injected with AAV-GFP (Nrg4 KO/GFP) or AAV–c-FLIPL (Nrg4

following an additional 12 weeks of NASH diet feeding. Simi-
lar to what occurred in the studies shown in Figure 2, Nrg4 defi-
ciency accelerated diet-induced NASH in mice. Compared with 
WT/GFP, Nrg4-KO/GFP mice had higher plasma ALT, AST, and 
HMGB1 levels, developed more severe liver fibrosis, and exhib-
ited increased presence of apoptotic cells (Figure 7, A–C). While

ing apoptosis and necropto-
sis, exert strong effects on the 
progression of both acute and 
chronic liver disease. Despite 
this, the signaling mechanisms 
that counter pathophysiological 
insults and preserve hepatocyte 
health in NASH remain poor-
ly understood. In this study, we 
uncovered an adipose-hepatic 
endocrine axis that functions as 
a checkpoint for diet-induced 
NASH in mice. Nrg4 protects 
hepatocytes from apoptosis and 
necroptosis triggered by meta-
bolic and inflammatory stress 
by 
attenuating 
ubiquitination 
and 
proteasomal 
degradation 
of c-FLIPL (Figure 8C). As such, 
activation 
of 
Nrg4-mediated 
endocrine signaling may provide 
a new therapeutic avenue for 
halting and/or reversing NASH 
pathogenesis in humans.
The observation that Nrg4, 
a fat-derived endocrine factor, 
plays a direct role in cell death sig-
naling in hepatocytes came some-
what as a surprise. We previously 
demonstrated that Nrg4 exerts 
pleiotropic effects on hepatic and 
systemic energy metabolism in 
diet-induced obesity (25). How-
ever, HFD used in the previous 
studies was inadequate in trigger-
ing liver injury and NASH. Here, 
we used a high-fat, high-fruc-
tose diet that elicits key aspects 
of human NASH pathologies in mice (34). Notably, NASH diet–
induced apoptotic and necroptotic cell death in mouse liver was 
linked to downregulation of c-FLIPL, a prosurvival factor, close-
ly resembling the observations in NASH patient livers. Several 
lines of evidence support the pathophysiological significance 
of Nrg4 in gating the transition from hepatic steatosis to NASH. 
Nrg4-null mice developed more severe liver injury upon NASH 
diet feeding, as shown by elevated plasma levels of ALT, AST, 
and HMGB1. Liver cell death and inflammation were increased 
in mice lacking Nrg4, leading to more severe liver fibrosis. In 
contrast, fat-specific Tg Nrg4 expression restored Nrg4 defi-
ciency and ameliorated the severity of diet-induced NASH in 
mice. Activation of Nrg4 signaling attenuated apoptotic and 
necroptotic cell death in hepatocytes in a cell-autonomous man-
ner, illustrating a direct role of Nrg4 in preserving liver health 
under stress conditions.
At the mechanistic level, Nrg4 engages the prosurvival fac-
tor c-FLIPL to attenuate cell death. Two isoforms of c-FLIP pro-
tein have been identified in mice: c-FLIPR and c-FLIPL (31, 32). 
NASH parameters in WT mice, it nearly completely eliminated 
worsening of NASH in Nrg4-null mice. Hepatic gene expression 
analyses indicated that the expression of genes involved in inflam-
mation and liver fibrosis in Nrg4-null mice was greatly attenuat-
ed by AAV–c-FLIPL, reaching levels similar to those in WT mice 
(Figure 8A). Accordingly, CASP3 and PARP cleavage and MLKL 
phosphorylation in Nrg4-KO mice also returned to control lev-
els following transduction with AAV–c-FLIPL (Figure 8B). Liver 
fat content and hepatic lipid droplet number and size, however, 
were not significantly affected by AAV-mediated overexpression 
of c-FLIPL (Supplemental Figure 6, B–D). These results support a 
critically important functional role of c-FLIPL regulation by Nrg4 
in mediating its effects on NASH progression.
Discussion
A hallmark of NASH is the presence of persistent liver injury as 
a result of increased hepatocyte death, which serves as a patho-
genic trigger for liver inflammation and fibrosis (13, 43). Genetic 
manipulations that impinge on the cell death pathways, includ-

naling via Nrg4 as a key regulator of c-FLIPL ubiquitination and 
proteasome-mediated degradation. Nrg4 strongly blunts JNK1/2 
activation in hepatocytes in an AKT-dependent manner following 
PA/TNF-α treatment, leading to increased c-FLIPL protein stabil-
ity. These results are consistent with previous work that demon-
strates an important role for JNK in posttranslational regulation 
of c-FLIPL (42). Notably, restoration of hepatic c-FLIPL protein 
expression alleviated diet-induced NASH in Nrg4-null mice with-
out affecting steatosis, suggesting that the Nrg4/c-FLIPL pathway 
exerts an independent effect on steatosis-to-NASH progression. 
Our work elucidates the molecular nature and pathophysiological 
significance of an endocrine checkpoint that regulates steatosis- 
to-NASH progression. Future work will further validate Nrg4-
based therapeutic biologics for NASH treatment.
Interestingly, Nrg4 appeared to predominantly affect the c-FLIPL 
isoform in the liver. c-FLIPL forms a heterodimer with procaspase 
8 to inhibit its activation and suppress the activation of apopto-
sis and necroptosis. For example, c-FLIPL protects cells from 
Fas-induced cell death, involving both apoptosis and necropto-
sis (44), and the formation of cell death–inducing ripoptosome 
in response to Toll-like receptor 3 activation (45). Inactivation of 
c-FLIPL in mouse hepatocytes promotes liver injury triggered by 
death receptor agonists (39). A recent study demonstrated that 
AAV-mediated overexpression of c-FLIPL in the liver ameliorates 
NASH in mice and nonhuman primates (41), illustrating a cru-
cial role of this factor in NASH. However, the physiological and 
pathophysiological cues that impinge on c-FLIPL remain largely 
unknown. Our current work uncovers adipose endocrine sig-

The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments 
and outcome assessment. We excluded mice that exhibited skin lesions 
due to fighting and growth retardation as a result of malocclusion.
Human studies. Human liver samples were obtained from the 
Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System at the University of Minnesota 
(Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) (33). Both male and female individu-
als were included. The average ages for normal individuals and NASH 
patients were 55.8 and 52.5 years old, respectively. Individuals with 
an alcohol-drinking history (2 to 3 drinks/day) and liver cancer were 
excluded from the study.
Hepatocyte treatment and cell death studies. Primary hepatocytes 
were isolated as previously described by using collagenase type II from 
C57BL/6J mice (25). Hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM medi-
um containing 10% bovine growth serum (BGS) at 37°C and 5% CO2. 
Hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus on the same day as isolation. 
After 24 hours, cells were switched to serum-free DMEM for 12 hours 
Methods
Animal studies. Mice were housed under 12-hour light/12-hour dark 
cycles with free access to food and water. For chow feeding, mice were 
fed Teklad 5001 Laboratory Diet. For NASH diet feeding, mice were fed 
a diet containing 40% fat (of which 18% was trans fat), 22% fructose, and 
2% cholesterol (D09100301, Research Diets Inc.) starting at 3 months 
of age. Nrg4-knockout mice and Nrg4-Tg mice have been described 
previously (25). Nrg4-KO mice were purchased from the Mutant Mice 
Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) at UCD and backcrossed for more 
than 10 generations to the C57BL/6J background. Nrg4-Tg mice on a 
C57BL/6J background were generated at the Transgenic Animal Model 
Core at the University of Michigan. For AAV8 transduction, AAV8-GFP 
or AAV8–c-FLIPL (1 × 1012 genome copies/mouse) was delivered by tail 
vein injection following 8 weeks of NASH diet feeding. After a total of 
20 weeks of NASH diet feeding, mice were sacrificed for analysis.
We did not predetermine sample size, but used group sizes typical 
for this type of work in the literature. We randomly assigned mice of the

processing and data analyses were performed according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. All original microarray data were deposited 
in the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO GSE99753).
Immunoblotting analysis. For total lysates, livers were homoge-
nized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 
5 mM NaF, 25 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovana-
date, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 
and freshly added protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells were harvested 
and homogenized with lysis buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (SDS), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 
0.002% bromphenol blue, and freshly added protease inhibitors. For 
protein stability assays, cells were treated with CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) 
before harvest. Immunoblotting experiments were performed using 
specific antibodies. For immunoblots, antibodies against c-FLIPL/R

before PA, TNF-α, and/or Nrg4 treatment. Hepa 1 cells (ATCC, CRL-
1830) were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% BGS at 37°C 
and 5% CO2. To establish a Hepa 1 cell line stably expressing ErbB4, 
Hepa 1 cells were infected with pBABE retroviral vector harboring the 
ErbB4 gene and screened with hygromycin (250 μg/ml final concentra-
tion) for at least 2 weeks. Hepa 1 cells were switched o serum-free DMEM 
for 12 hours before treatments with PA, TNF-α, AKT inhibitor (AKT 
Inhibitor VIII; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog A6730), JNK inhibitor (SP 600125; 
Sigma-Aldrich, catalog S5567), MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog 474787), 
and Nrg4 (Novo Nordisk). To knock down Itch in Hepa 1 cells, siRNAs 
against Itch (catalog 4390771, ID: S68413 and S68414) and control 
 
siRNA (catalog 4390843) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientif-
ic. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (catalog 13778030) 
was used for siRNA transfection. Cell death was evaluated using the LDH 
Cytotoxicity Colorimetric Assay Kit II (BioVision, K313-500). LDH values 
were normalized to maximum releasable LDH activity after cell lysis.
Gene expression analysis. Total RNA from adipose tissues was 
extracted using a commercial kit from Invitrogen. RNAs from other 
tissues was extracted using the TRIzol method. For qPCR analysis, an 
equal amount of RNA was reverse-transcribed using MMLV-RT fol-
lowed by qPCR reactions using SYBR green (Life Technologies). Rela-
tive abundance of mRNA was normalized to ribosomal protein 36B4. 
The primers for qPCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1.
For microarray study of liver gene expression, total liver RNA iso-
lated from NASH diet–fed WT and Nrg4-KO mice was used to gen-

Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with PBS, and then costained with 
annexin V/PI (V13242, Invitrogen) followed by flow cytometry. CD4+ T 
cell subpopulations in the liver were analyzed as described (47). Briefly, 
mouse livers were ground and lymphoid fraction in livers was isolated 
by density gradient centrifugation in Lymphoprep (AXS-1114547, Axis-
Shield) followed by in vitro stimulation with phorbol-miristate acetate 
(PMA) (100 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) plus ionomycin (1 μM, Sigma- 
Aldrich) plus brefeldin A (1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours. Cells 
were first stained extracellularly with specific antibodies against mouse 
CD4, CD8, CD45, and CD90.2 (BD Bioscience), were then fixed and 
permeabilized with Fixation/Permeabilization Solution (eBioscience), 
and finally were stained intracellularly with antibodies against mouse 
IL-17, TNF-α, RORγt, and FOXP3 (BD Biosciences). Samples were 
acquired on a flow cytometry analyzer (LSR II; BD Biosciences), and 
data were analyzed with DIVA software (BD Biosciences).
Statistics. All results are presented as mean ± SEM. Student’s 
t test was used to analyze the differences between 2 groups, while 
1-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test was used to evaluate differ-
ences among groups when 3 or more groups were analyzed. A P value 
of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical 
methods and corresponding P values for data shown in each panel 
are included in the figure legends. All representative experiments 
were repeated at least 3 times.
Study approval. All animal studies were approved by the Institution-
al Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at the University of 
Michigan. The use of human liver samples was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board at Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED).

Plasma and liver triacylglyceride analysis. The plasma ALT and AST 
levels were measured using kits from Stanbio, and plasma HMGB1 
levels were measured using ELISA kits from antibodies-online (http:/
/
www.antibodies-online.com/). Liver triacylglyceride (TAG) was 
extracted and measured as previously described.
Histopathologic analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy.  
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse liver sections were stained 
with H&E to evaluate steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. Liver 
fibrosis was assessed by Picrosirius (sirius) red (Polysciences, catalog 
24901) staining of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse liv-
er sections. TUNEL staining was conducted on the cryosections of the 
livers using a kit from BioVision (K401-60). For immunofluorescence 
microscopy, cryosections of the livers were fixed with 10% formalin, 
blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), and labeled with the antibody 
against mouse F4/80 (Abcam, ab16911) for 3 hours, followed by incu-
bation with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour. The stained sections were mounted with 
DAPI-containing mounting medium (VECTASHIELD) and then 
viewed on a Nikon A-1-A fluorescence microscope. For parameters 
involving sirius red staining and F4/80 immunofluorescence, com-
puterized image analysis (ImageJ, NIH) was used to quantify the area 
stained as a percentage of the total area of view. TUNEL+ cells were 
quantified (Image J) in TUNEL staining liver section images as the per-
centage of TUNEL+ cells per total DAPI-stained cells. For lipid droplet 
number and size quantification, ImageJ was used on the H&E staining 
images. The same threshold settings were used for all analyses.
Measurement of collagen content of liver tissue. Collagen content 
in the livers was evaluated by measuring the hydroxyproline level in 
the livers using the Hydroxyproline Colorimetric Assay Kit (K555-
100) from BioVision. Briefly, liver tissue was homogenized in water 
and samples were hydrolyzed by incubation with 6N hydrochloric 
acid at 120°C for 3 hours. Liver hydrolysates were oxidized using 
chloramine-T, followed by incubation with Ehrlich’s perchloric acid 
reagent for color development. Absorbance was measured at 560 
nm, and hydroxyproline quantities were calculated by reference to 
standards processed in parallel.
Ubiquitination assay. Hepa 1 cells were transfected with the plas-
mids encoding HA-tagged c-FLIPL and Flag-tagged ubiquitin by using 
polyethylenimine (Polysciences, catalog 23966). Ubiquitination 
assays were performed following a previously described protocol (46). 
Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% SDS buffer (Tris [pH 7.5], 0.5 mM EDTA, 
1 mM DTT) and boiled for 10 minutes. For immunoprecipitation, the 
lysates were diluted 10-fold in Tris-HCl buffer. Ubiquitination was 
assayed using anti-Flag immunoblotting.
Flow cytometry analysis. For cell death analysis, primary hepato-
cytes and Hepa 1 cells were digested with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco,
