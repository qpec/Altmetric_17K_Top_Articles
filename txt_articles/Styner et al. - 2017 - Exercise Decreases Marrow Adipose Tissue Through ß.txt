Abstract
The relationship between marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and bone health is poorly understood. We 
used running exercise to ask whether obesity-associated MAT can be attenuated via exercise and 
whether this correlates with gains in bone quantity and quality. C57BL/6 mice were divided into 
diet-induced obesity (DIO, n = 14) versus low-fat diet (LFD, n = 14). After 3 months, 16-week-old 
mice were allocated to an exercise intervention (LFD-E, DIO-E) or a control group (LFD, DIO) 
for 6 weeks (4 groups, n = 7/group). Marrow adipocyte area was 44% higher with obesity 
(p<0.0001) and after exercise 33% lower in LFD (p<0.0001) and 39% lower in DIO (p<0.0001). 
In LFD, exercise did not affect adipocyte number; however, in DIO, the adipocyte number was 
56% lower (p<0.0001). MAT was 44% higher in DIO measured by osmium-µCT, whereas exercise 
associated with reduced MAT (–23% in LFD, –48% in DIO, p<0.05). MAT was additionally 
quantified by 9.4TMRI, and correlated with osmium-µCT (r = 0.645; p<0.01). Consistent with 
higher lipid beta oxidation, perilipin 3 (PLIN3) rose with exercise in tibial mRNA (+92% in LFD,
+60% in DIO, p<0.05). Tibial µCT-derived trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) was not influenced 
by DIO but responded to exercise with an increase of 19% (p<0.001). DIO was associated with

 higher cortical periosteal and endosteal volumes of 15% (p = 0.012) and 35% (p<0.01), 
respectively, but Ct. Ar/Tt.Ar was lower by 2.4% (p<0.05). There was a trend for higher stiffness 
(N/m) in DIO, and exercise augmented this further. In conclusion, obesity associated with 
increases in marrow lipid—measured by osmium-µCT and MRI—and partially due to an increase 
in adipocyte size, suggesting increased lipid uptake into preexisting adipocytes. Exercise 
associated with smaller adipocytes and less bone lipid, likely invoking increased ß-oxidation and 
basal lipolysis as evidenced by higher levels of PLIN3.

Introduction
More than one-third of US adults are obese.(1) Obese individuals exhibit a preserved or even 
increased bone density, perhaps representing an adaptation to increased weight-based 
mechanical loading(2–6) or increased estrogen available through aromatization.(7,8) Similarly, 
in rodents, we and others have demonstrated that short-term high-fat feeding is associated 
with preserved or increased bone density.(9–11) There are studies that support a negative 
impact of obesity on bone quantity(12–14) or its biomechanical properties,(15,16) leading to 
the thinking that, despite increased bone quantity in the setting of obesity, bone quality and 
composition may not be commensurate to body weight, even representing relative bone 
fragility and increased fracture risk.(17,18) Further, obesity has been associated with 
increased fractures, albeit not classic osteoporotic fragility fractures.(19–21) Beyond the 
controversy of whether obesity is beneficial or harmful for bone health, the effect of 
localized “obesity” within bone, as represented by marrow adipose tissue (MAT), on bone 
health is controversial.(10,13,22–26)
Although it is clear that obesity increases white adipose cell size and number in extra-
marrow fat depots,(27) the relationship between obesity and MAT cellularity is not known. 
We previously showed that MAT lipid volume increases rapidly during high-fat feeding in 
rodents relative to the total bone volume, rising earlier than calorie induction of visceral fat 
depot size.(5) A positive association between obesity and MAT has also been noted in 
humans(28) as well as rodents.(10) What remains unclear is whether adipocyte hypertrophy or 
hyperplasia accounts for increased MAT in the setting of calorie excess.
MAT accumulation due to high-fat diet (HFD) or PPARγ agonist is suppressed by daily 
exercise in mice.(22,29) Exercise suppression of MAT expansion occurs simultaneously with 
new bone formation.(30) Mechanical loading in mice has been shown to increase bone 
formation rates in loaded tibias.(31) Many rodent studies confirm increased bone formation 
rate as an adaptive response to exercise via histomorphometry,(32) including running 
exercise.(32) This process, besides requiring energy for muscular contraction, will also 
require energy for local bone formation. As such, the question of whether exercise utilizes 
marrow fat as an energy depot remains to be addressed.

 In this study, we ask whether exercise is able to modulate MAT due to obesity in mice, 
building on prior work demonstrating the ability of exercise to modulate MAT after short-
term HFD feeding. We additionally ask whether bone quantity and quality are affected by 
diet-induced obesity (DIO) and whether exercise can reverse effects on bone associated with 
obesity. Mice are used to answer these mechanistic questions regarding the physiologic 
relevance of MAT because sophisticated methods to quantify whole bone MAT 
(volumetrically) are not yet available in humans. By measuring MAT via established and 
additional methods in mice, we confirm that MAT is higher in the setting of DIO. We 
additionally validate MRI for volumetric quantification of MAT and correlate this with 
established methods in our laboratory. We will show that exercise can suppress MAT under 
both control and DIO conditions. Importantly, this exercise effect is correlated with a 
diminution in adipocyte size in both control and DIO. mRNA analysis of whole tibias 
confirms that DIO was associated with higher lipid storage. Perilipin 3 (PLIN3) rose in 
exercised mice, consistent with an increase in ß-oxidation(33) and basal lipolysis.(34) 
Biomechanical strength of the tibia was higher in exercisers because of augmentation of 
cortical and trabecular thickness. Exercise was associated with improved resistance to 
bending in both diet groups, with a greater impact on bones from obese mice compared with 
those from non-obese mice.
Materials and Methods
Animals and diet
All procedures were IACUC approved. Four-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (The Jackson 
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were housed in controlled light and temperature 
conditions. Animals were randomly divided into two groups and fed high-fat diet (HFD) of 
n = 14 versus low-fat diet (LFD) of n = 14. The mice were fed their assigned diet for a 3-
month period, with the high-fat diet consisting of 45% of calories from fat (#D12451, 
Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and the low-fat diet consisting of 10% of 
calories from fat (#D12450B, Research Diets). Body weight was measured biweekly. In 
addition to this experimental group, a baseline control group (n = 10/diet group) was 
harvested before the initiation of exercise intervention. The mice were housed in groups of 2 
or 3 before exercise intervention. During the exercise intervention, mice were individually 
housed to allow access to and use of running wheels.
Exercise intervention
After a 3-month dietary lead-in, 16-week-old mice in both diet groups were allocated to an 
exercise intervention for 6 weeks. The groups were as follows: 1) sedentary mice fed with a 
LFD (LFD group, n = 7); 2) running mice fed with LFD (LFD-E group, n = 7); 3) sedentary 
mice fed with a HFD (DIO group, n = 7); 4) running mice fed with a HFD (DIO-E group, n 
= 7). Access to the voluntary, running wheel was provided to exercise intervention groups as 
previously described.(35) Wheel use was monitored using a Mity 8 Cyclocomputer (model 
CC-MT400, CAT EYE, Ltd, Osaka, Japan).

 Body composition
MRI technology was used to evaluate whole body composition (including fat, lean tissue, 
and water) in vivo 3 weeks after initiation of exercise intervention. Body composition was 
assessed using MRI (EchoMRI, Houston, TX, USA) to determine fat and lean mass 
percentages as previously described.(36)
Volumetric quantification and imaging of MAT by osmium-µCT
Osmium staining of lipid in mouse bones has been previously described.(22,29,37) Briefly, 
femurs were fixed, then decalcified and subsequently incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide/
2.5% potassium dichromate for 48 hours. µCT imaging was performed at 10-µm isotropic 
resolution. Quantitative, volumetric image analysis(22,29) of the lipid binder, osmium was 
performed via standard-density (Hounsfield unit [HU]) weighted volumetric measurements. 
Only locations with a minimal density of 2000 HU were incorporated in the analysis.(22)
Imaging was performed via µCT with energy of 55 kVp, integration time of 500 ms, and 
resolution of 0.01×0.01×0.01 mm (Scanco µCT-35, Scanco Medical, Bruttisellen, 
Switzerland). Raw, unaligned femur images were first rigidly aligned (3D Slicer, 
www.slicer.org)(38) to present all images in a consistent fashion and to allow for 
superimposition of images. Bone masks were created next, starting from segmentation via 
standardized bone thresholds. Manual contouring was performed to outline the femur in all 
images to designate a total femoral volume (Insight-SNAP, www.itksnap.org).(39) Because 
osmium is significantly denser than bone, HU thresholds were set for visualization of 
osmium as follows: low osmium from 2000 to 3000 HU (red), mid osmium from 3000 to 
4000 HU (green), and high osmium from 4000 to 5000 HU (blue). The lower threshold for 
osmium was chosen to be considerably above the HU for dense cortical bone.(40) The 
contribution of potentially mislabeled cortical bone to the osmium volume is expected to be 
negligible.(41) The maximal threshold of 5000 HU was chosen by inspecting the 99th 
percentile over the full image intensities. In between the lower and upper thresholds, we 
divided the osmium attenuation range into three uniformly separated categories.
Osmium within the bone mask was then quantified as volumetric (mm3) measurements of 
low, mid, and high osmium stain regions in the femur. Osmium volume was normalized to 
total femoral volume TV (as % of TV). We reported and analyzed the % osmium (osmium in 
mm3/total volume) above the mid osmium threshold of 3000 HU. Aligned femoral images 
were averaged across all images to form an average femur image as a reference for bone 
visualization. Images were also averaged within each group separately for color-coded 
visualizations of the osmium densities to allow for visual comparisons of MAT between 
groups (as in Fig. 2).
Volumetric quantification and imaging of MAT by MRI
Femurs were analyzed with a 9.4T horizontal small-bore MRI scanner. Water and fat maps 
were obtained with a 2- dimensional RARE imaging sequence with the following 
parameters: RARE factor = 4, TE = 28 ms, TR = 4000 ms, number of averages = 4, number 
of slices = 24, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, in-plane resolution = 100×100 µm2, matrix size = 
130×130. Utilizing the fact that the fat and water protons have a NMR frequency separation

 of 3.5 ppm, a Gaussian-shaped 90° saturation pulse with a width of 2ms was applied 
preceding the RARE sequence to suppress the fat or water signal while leaving the other 
signal unaffected. The fat and water images were acquired by setting the saturation pulse 
frequency to be the same as the water and fat frequencies, respectively. In our processing 
workflow, we first manually subdivided the full images containing all 10 samples into 
individual images for each bone. Then, we employed the water images to manually outline 
femoral bone masks using Insight SNAP.(39) Using these bone masks, interior bone regions 
were masked from other image parts in both the water and fat maps. Next, we established a 
common, study-specific reference space by computing an unbiased average image(42) from 
the masked water maps using the ANTS registration software.(43) All individual water and 
fat maps were then propagated into the common space, where voxel-wise correspondence 
allows direct comparison of intensities. Average fat maps for each group were computed in 
the common space and superimposed on the common, average water image for visualization 
of group fat maps. Fat map intensities were represented with a colored heat map in 3D 
Slicer(39) for visualization (Fig. 2C). For MAT quantification, we created a regional label 
map of the femur, excluding cortical bone regions, with regions for the epiphysis, 
metaphysis, and diaphysis. Intensity-weighted volume of MAT was then quantified via the 
regional fat histograms akin to the MAT volumetric quantification in the osmium-µCT 
images.
Marrow adipocyte diameter and number quantification via histology
Fixed and decalcified femurs were imbedded in paraffin, sectioned into 5 µm slices, and 
stained with hematoxylin as previously described.(44) Imaging was performed on an 
Olympus X81 at 4× and 40× magnifications. The 40× magnification images were obtained 
at the distal femoral growth plate, where lipid content is maximal. ImageJ was used to 
isolate adipocytes within 40× images and to quantify adipocyte size as described in Parlee 
and colleagues.(45) Additionally, globular maxima were removed manually to isolate defined 
adipocytes. The “Analyze Particles” function was used to outline cells and calculate area, in 
pixels, for each (Supplemental Fig. S1B). A lower limit of 1000 pixels was applied. This 
process was applied to 3 images per slice, with 4 slices per mouse (mice analyzed per group: 
LFD, n = 4; LFD-E, n = 4; DIO, n = 3; DIO-E, n = 4), resulting in n = 36–48 images 
analyzed per group. Adipocyte number was obtained via ImageJ.(46) The marrow cavity 
from the metaphysis in the 4× magnification images were isolated. The area of the total 
white space within this isolated area was normalized to the average adipocyte area of that 
experimental group to obtain the total number of adipocytes within the image. This value 
was normalized to the total area of metaphysis isolated to obtain average adipocyte per 
square micrometer.
Bone microarchitecture
Bone microarchitecture parameters of the proximal tibial metaphysis and mid-diaphysis 
were quantified ex vivo as previously described (resolution = 12 µm, E = 55 kVa, I = 145 
µA).(29,47–49) Intracortical porosities were quantified as previously described.(29) Cortical 
area is the area of cortical bone, whereas total area is total area enclosed by the periosteal 
bone surface (outer surface of the bone). Endosteal volume is the volume enclosed by the 
inner surface of the bone, and periosteal volume is the volume inside the outer surface of the

 bone. These values represent the volumetric equivalent of the marrow area and the total area, 
respectively.
Biomechanical testing
Biomechanical testing was performed as previously described.(50,51) Briefly, the MTS 858 
Minibionix II (MTS, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was used to resolve the mechanical properties 
at the mid-diaphysis. For the 4-point bending: 50 kN load cell samples were placed across 
two struts (distance = 0.6 mm) with the anterior side facing up. Two struts fixed to the 
lowering piston (distance = 0.15 mm) were lowered at a constant rate (0.2 mm/s) across the 
mid-diaphysis until the sample was brought to ultimate failure. Parameters evaluated were 
stiffness, defined as the slope of the curve (force versus displacement) across the elastic 
region, ultimate strength (point-of-failure), and Young’s modulus.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the whole tibia and 1 µg was reverse-transcribed and analyzed 
via real-time PCR. Ten microliters of cDNA from each experimental condition were pooled 
and diluted 1:10 to 1:10,000 to generate a 5-point standard curve. A non-template control 
was added to each PCR reaction. Standards and samples were run in duplicate. PCR 
products were normalized to GAPDH.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was evaluated by two-way ANOVA with correction for multiple 
comparisons via a Tukey post-hoc test (GraphPad Prism 7.0, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). 
Exercise and dietary intervention were used as the analysis variables. Our data sets passed 
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (GraphPad Prism 7.0). The p value cut-off for significance is 
defined at less than or equal to 0.05. Trend is defined as a p value greater than 0.05 and less 
than 0.15. For Fig. 3, GraphPad Prism was used to analyze the histogram with generation of 
a Gaussian-fit curve.
Results
Exercise reduces fat mass
DIO mice weighed 14% more than those fed LFD (Fig. 1A, diet effect p<0.001, 
Supplemental Fig. S3). Fat mass measured by MRI 3 weeks before harvest was 35% higher 
in the DIO groups compared with LFD (p<0.01, Fig 1C). Fat pad weight at harvest 
correlated with fat mass, noted to be 129% higher in DIO compared with LFD (p<0.0001, 
Fig. 1F). Lean mass was higher by 7% in DIO compared with LFD and was unaffected by 
exercise in either dietary group (p<0.01, Fig. 1E). In humans, a body mass index (BMI) cut-
off is used to define obesity (BMI>30); in mice, however, there is no predefined cut-off and, 
thus, body composition and weight are utilized to determine if an obese phenotype is 
present. Diet-induced obesity is an accepted mouse model of obesity,(52) but there is 
significant variation of weight response because of various factors: strain,(53) duration of 
high-fat feeding, as well as the fat % of the diet (45% of calories from come from fat in our 
study). Many obesity experiments are performed in male mice that gain more body weight 
than females in response to HFD.(54) Our experiment is similar to other obesity experiments

 with regard to fat mass and fat pad weight (typically a doubling in the obese compared with 
controls).(51)
Daily running distances were similar in both exercising groups (LFD-E, 10.16±2.98; DIO-E, 
9.19±1.94 km/d, p = 0.5) (Fig. 1B). Other studies(55,56) have shown similar daily running 
distances with voluntary wheel-based running, but daily distances do vary with regard to 
mouse strain, sex, and age. At the end of the 6-week experimental period, exercise did not 
impact weight gain in either LFD or DIO groups (Fig. 1A). Perigonadal fat pad weight 
responded to diet and exercise, higher by 159% in DIO compared with LFD, with an 
exercise-associated decrement of 22% in LFD and 26% in DIO (p<0.05, Fig. 1E).
Exercise lowers MAT volume in both lean and obese mice
MAT was quantified via volumetric µCT imaging of the lipid binder, osmium 
tetroxide.(22,37) Visualization was achieved by superimposing and averaging the µCT images 
(n = 10 per group for pre-exercise images and n = 6 per group for post-exercise images) and 
color labeling of osmium signal according to HU density (Fig. 2A). Before initiation of 
exercise, DIO demonstrated 45% more MAT as measured by MRI compared with LFD 
(p<0.05, Supplemental Fig. S2B, n = 10 per group). After 6 weeks of exercise, in both 
sagittal and coronal images, the osmium signal was highest in femurs from DIO groups (Fig. 
2A), albeit not statistically different (Fig. 2B), diverging from our prior finding of higher 
MAT (normalized to bone volume) in the setting of short-term high-fat feeding.(22)
Both lean and DIO groups responded to exercise with significantly lower MAT: −23% in 
LFD and −48% in DIO (exercise effect p<0.05). In fact, 6 weeks of exercise associated with 
lower lipid volume in the DIO group to levels equivalent with LFD-E femurs as shown in 
Fig. 2B.
To extend our osmium-µCT analysis using a method that is less toxic to the investigator and 
one that would allow for in vivo imaging assessment, we employed a novel MRI-based 
approach using a 9.4T scanner to study marrow fat in rodents. Because protons in fat and 
water have a 3.5 ppm difference in NMR frequency, images of the water content can be 
separated from images of lipid content. Superimposing these averaged images allows 
visualization of lipid within bone, similar to the method we have utilized with the bone 
masking in the osmium-µCT technique. MRI visualization of the marrow lipid shows the 
same effect of exercise lowering lipid content that was demonstrated with the µCT method 
(Fig. 2C, D) (p<0.001). Again, the DIO animal did not have statistically different total MAT, 
similar to the osmium-µCT method, but the exercise effect to decrease MAT was significant. 
The Pearson correlation between the osmium-µCT and MRI methods for measuring MAT 
was statistically significant (r = 0.645, p<0.01) (Fig. 2E). In both the osmium-µCT and MRI 
methods, we did find that DIO was associated with higher total bone volume. To 
characterize this alteration in bone size, we measured femoral length, which was not 
different between LFD and DIO (data not shown). However, we found that DIO mice have 
slightly larger bones in terms of circumference. With the increase in circumference, there is 
also an increase in endosteal volume of 35% (p<0.01), which was confirmed with µCT.

 Exercise shrinks adipocytes in lean and obese mice
Assessment of marrow fat volume cannot determine whether there are more or larger 
adipocytes in diet and exercise-treated animals. Limitations to defining adipocyte size in any 
fat depot include the need to accurately contour adipocyte perimeter, which is difficult when 
cells abut each other and are further subject to fixation artifact (Fig. 3A). To overcome this 
challenge, we determined the average size of clearly demarcated adipocytes within 
hematoxylin-stained histologic sections using Image J (detailed in Supplemental Fig. S1B). 
To assess variability in cell size, a histogram with Gaussian-fit curves was generated, with 
each cell fitting in 60-µm2-wide bins, and, due to the varying number of cells analyzed in 
each group, the data are represented in percentage of total cells in each bin (LFD, n = 1101; 
LFD-E, n = 886; DIO, n = 563; DIO-E, n = 793). This analysis shows that bone marrow 
adipocytes in DIO-fed groups were larger than those on the lean diet and that exercise 
reduced the average size of each adipocyte irrespective, by 19% in LFD and 37% in DIO 
(Fig. 3C). From the area data, the diameter of each cell was calculated, and the same 
analysis was performed (Supplemental Fig. S1C, D), which follows the same trends as found 
in the area analysis. Exercise did not affect adipocyte number in LFD; however, in DIO 
exercise associated with a 56% lower adipocyte number (DIO-E versus DIO, p<0.0001). 
Importantly, exercise “normalized” adipocyte size in DIO-E, producing a size similar in 
dimension to LFD (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, there was a significantly lower adipocyte size 
with exercise in the low-fat-fed animal as well as DIO, suggesting that fat fuel stored in 
marrow adipocytes is utilized during running exercise. Marrow adipocyte area was 44% 
higher in the DIO, whereas exercise associated with a reduced marrow adipocyte area: −33% 
in LFD and −39% in DIO (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3C).
Exercise was associated with higher trabecular and cortical bone quantity in lean and 
obese mice
Bone microarchitecture parameters were analyzed by µCT. The pre-exercise 16-week-old 
baseline controls demonstrated no difference with regard to bone microarchitecture between 
LFD and DIO groups (Supplemental Table S2, n = 10/group). At the end of the 6-week 
exercise intervention, running exercise, but not diet, affected trabecular bone quantity and 
quality in the proximal tibial metaphysis. Trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was 
higher in exercisers in both LFD and DIO (both by 19%, p<0.01, Fig. 4A). Although 
trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) remained similar between 
groups, trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) was significantly affected by exercise: 24% higher in 
LFD-E versus LFD (p<0.01) and 48% higher in DIO-E versus DIO (p<0.0001) (Fig. 4A). 
DIO associated with lower cortical area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar) by 2.4% compared with LFD 
(p<0.05, Fig. 5B). Additionally, in DIO versus LFD, the periosteal and endosteal volumes 
were higher by 15% (p = 0.01) and 35% (p<0.01), respectively. Thus, obesity resulted in a 
larger size of bone as well as an additionally higher endosteal cavity volume, resulting in a 
similar cortical thickness even in a larger animal (schematic overview in Fig. 7). Endosteal 
volume increases associated with DIO are compensated for by a trend toward increased total 
cortical area with a small increase in periosteal diameter. This finding suggests the bone 
marrow cavity in DIO bones expands and that this obesity-driven process is abrogated in the 
setting of exercise.

 Exercise was associated with a cortical thickness 2% higher in LFD and 7% higher in DIO 
compared with non-exercisers (p<0.05 for an exercise effect, Fig. 4B). This exercise effect 
on cortical bone thickness was more significant in obese compared with lean mice. Cortical 
porosity was not significantly affected, although there was a trend for lower cortical porosity 
with exercise in LFD (Fig. 4B).
Obesity-induced biomechanical changes are reversed with exercise
The rotational moment of inertia (MOI), which is an index of resistance to bending, was 
+24% higher in DIO (p<0.05) in the the YY (Iyy) plane and +37% in the XX (Ixx) plane 
(p<0.05) (Fig. 5A). Exercise attenuated pMOI in DIO-E, although the effect was not 
significant. Stiffness and Young’s modulus were quantified through 4-point bending of the 
tibia: a trend for higher bone stiffness (N/m) was noted in DIO; exercise was additive to this 
effect (Fig. 5B). Thus, DIO was associated with higher stiffness as measured by 4-point 
bending (resistance to fracture) and polar moment of inertia in the Ixx plane, parameters that 
point to greater bone quality.(57,58) Exercise generated an even higher 4-point bending 
stiffness in both LFD and DIO groups.
Marrow fat gene expression supports its function as an energy depot
Total bone mRNA was analyzed to assess for changes in fat and metabolism-associated 
genes. DIO associated with higher lipid storage marker FSP27 (+80% versus LFD, 
p<0.001), adipose tissue mass regulator LepR (+36% versus LFD, p<0.01) (Fig. 6). Perilipin 
(PLIN) 1 and 5 are involved in lipid droplet growth, and both increase with DIO, PLIN 5 
more significantly (PLIN5 +73%, p<0.05, versus PLIN 1+54%, p = 0.08). That these genes 
did not return to control levels with exercise might suggest that they represent the number of 
fat cells in bone. As such, the lower fat mass due to exercise would primarily arise through 
burning of adipocyte triglyceride. The diet-associated higher PLIN5 suggests that there was 
increased lipid storage in bone marrow. PLIN 3, which is associated with oxidation of 
palmitate(33) as well as promoting basal lipolysis,(34) was sensitive to exercise, showing near 
100% increases in both exercise groups (LFD-E +92%, DIO-E +109%, p = 0.01 for an 
exercise effect, Fig. 6). MAT was recently found to be a major source of circulating 
adiponectin;(59) however, bone adiponectin mRNA in our study was not altered by DIO or 
running (Supplemental Table S1). Other WAT markers, including FASN and aP2, were not 
significantly affected by diet or exercise (Supplemental Table S1).
Discussion
The physiologic function of marrow fat, in contrast to other fat depots, remains largely 
unknown. In our previous work, we showed that bone marrow fat rises rapidly after 6 weeks 
of high-fat feeding, and this rise can be entirely prevented by running exercise.(22) Here we 
investigated the effects of exercise on long-term obesity-induced marrow fat, utilizing 
rigorous imaging techniques to quantify adipose tissue volume as well as adipocyte size and 
number. We found that exercise associated with lower MAT even in the setting of established 
obesity. Importantly, running exercise caused a significant decrease in the size and number 
of marrow adipocytes. At the same time, we found that chronic obesity led to larger bone 
volumes, endosteal volumes (and hence marrow cavity area) and smaller bone area fractions

 (Fig. 7). Obese mice responded to running exercise with improved trabecular and cortical 
bone quantity, thicker cortices, and improved bone quality and stiffness. Overall, obesity and 
exercise were additive in terms of improving bone quantity (Fig. 4, see Tb.Th, Ct.Th) and 
quality (Fig. 5B, see stiffness). Exercise induction of PLIN3 in bone indicates an increase in 
lipolysis and β-oxidation of lipids. These findings indicate that marrow adipocytes shrink 
during exercise, perhaps even providing fuel for exercise-induced bone formation. This 
suggests that marrow fat might be tapped as an energy reservoir to promote anabolic 
adaptations in bone.
Increased fat calories in the diet contribute to expanded MAT volume ahead of increases in 
visceral white adipose fat depots during short-term high-fat feeding.(22) With established 
obesity, marrow adipocyte size and number were both significantly larger. Higher lipid as 
quantified by osmium-µCT and MRI as well as larger fat cell size suggests that marrow 
adipocytes store lipid similarly to adipocytes located in white adipose depots, by increasing 
cell size as well as cell number.(60,61) That being said, it is notable that the average adipocyte 
size in the marrow for LFD, LFD-E, and DIO-E mice was about one-half the size of a 
peripheral adipocyte on a control or low-fat diet,(62) and for DIO, marrow adipocytes are 
approximately one-fifth the size of a peripheral adipocyte on a similar high-fat diet.(45) Size 
differences may be due to local constraints of the skeleton or to phenotypic differences(63) in 
the progenitor source.(64) The expansion of lipid droplets in the obese bones is further 
supported by higher Fsp27, as mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of Fsp27 have smaller 
adipocytes and lower lipid storage capacity.(65) Typically, HFD-fed mice ingest higher total 
daily calories because of the calorie-dense nature of their diet. Exercising mice have been 
shown to consume higher daily calories compared with sedentary controls.(22,66,67) 
Quantification of caloric intake is planned for future studies to further our understanding of 
energy utilization in the setting of increased (and decreased) MAT.
Exercise leads to lower lipid mass in bone marrow in the setting of control and high-fat 
diets,(22) PPARγ agonist therapy,(29) and now, as we have shown here, obesity. The reduced 
size of individual adipocytes within the marrow space suggests that they may provide fuel 
for exercise and for exercise-induced anabolic adaptations in skeletal tissue. Consistent with 
this idea is the measured increase in bone mRNA encoding perilipin 3 (PLIN3). Perilipin 3 
has been noted to play a role in β-oxidation of lipids in muscle(33) and other tissues,(68,69) as 
well as in promoting higher rates of basal lipolysis.(34) The exercise induction of PLIN3 and 
Acox1 (which has a role in peroxisomal β-oxidation) supports that MAT contributes to local 
energy needs during exercise. Of the lipid-droplet-associated perilipin family of proteins, 
PLIN3 is recognized as a regulator of lipid oxidation.(33,70) PLIN3 is positively associated 
with the 24-hour RQ and palmitate oxidation.(33) PLIN3 knockdown has been shown to 
reduce lipid oxidation, and in vitro lipolytic stimulation increases PLIN3.(33) In this study, 
we found that PLIN3 expression was higher in the tibia of exercising mice, regardless of 
diet. In addition to increased PLIN3 indicating an increase in lipid oxidation, the size of 
marrow adipocytes was significantly smaller in exercising mice, supporting that lipid is 
utilized during the exercise intervention. PLIN3 is upregulated in response to exercise in 
muscle,(69) further supporting its role in β-oxidation in bone. In fact, the obese running mice 
compared with lean running mice had greater declines in MAT volume, adipocyte size, and 
adipocyte number, suggesting that they preferentially utilized this energy store. Indeed,

 studies indicate that local energy metabolism is critical for osteoblastogenesis/bone 
formation.(71–73) Conversely, our data suggest that a sedentary and obese state promotes 
MAT accumulation, a lipid depot that might serve a teleological advantage. Running 
partially offsets energy costs of thermogenesis, as has been noted in a study of wild 
weasels,(74) therefore it is possible that the protective effects of running on the mouse 
skeleton may be due to substitution of exercise for non-shivering thermogenesis to maintain 
body temperature. We did not find an “exercise dose” effect on marrow fat or bone 
parameters, which may be because of the fact that the running distance was not significantly 
different between wheel runners (Supplemental Fig. S4). These data support that increasing 
exercise duration does not necessarily correlate with additional bone mass, suggesting that 
exercise bouts could be shortened (or even optimized, inserting rest periods as we have 
published in vitro).(75)
Higher bone quantity, lower MAT, and reduced marrow adipocyte diameter and number 
along with increased PLIN3 in the running animals suggest that β-oxidation increases in the 
skeleton generating fuel for anabolism. Other cells residing in bone (eg, HSC lineage) 
besides osteoblasts may benefit from this energy source. It should be noted that RBCs rely 
solely on glucose because they contain no mitochondria, and HSC, with lower mitochondrial 
mass, also prefer to utilize glucose.(76) Osteoblasts are able to utilize both lipid and glucose 
as energy sources(77) with fatty acid oxidation accounting for 40% to 80% of total energy 
requirement.(78)
The study of MAT requires reproducible, quantitative methodologies. Here we validated an 
image-based method for quantifying lipid in bone in rodents that employs MRI fat map 
images analyzed via 3D image analysis and normalized to bone volume. The MRI technique 
was compared with our previously published osmium-µCT method with 3D image 
analysis(22,29) as well as to quantitative histologic measurements including adipocyte area 
and diameter. The volumetric MRI method correlates well with our established osmium-µCT 
method. Because MRI can distinguish between the magnetic resonance signal from lipid in 
MAT from the usual signal from water, no [toxic] staining is required, and it has the 
potential to be utilized for longitudinal, in vivo studies of MAT. Additionally, there is no 
“batch effect,” a limitation of osmium staining, thus allowing MAT comparison across 
different experiments. These imaging methods, however, while both reliable for volumetric 
quantification of lipid, do not allow assessment of adipocyte number or size. Here we used 
histological assessment to show that obesity and higher volumetric MAT were associated 
with an increase in size as well as number of marrow adipocytes. That obesity associated 
with greater adipocyte size and number(79) and that both measures were lower with exercise 
as would be expected in other white fat depots(80) is consistent with obesity-induced 
hypertrophy and hyperplasia of marrow adipocytes.
Importantly, obese mice were quick to participate in voluntary running, running as far and as 
fast to induce increases in BV/TV that were at least as significant as their lean counterparts. 
What is particularly notable here is that in the setting of DIO, exercise led to use of fat for 
fuel, correlating with a reduction in marrow adipocyte size, number, and marrow fat volume 
to levels not significantly different from lean runners. Extra-marrow fat depot volume—as 
quantified by total body MRI and by the weight of gonadal fat pads—also responded to DIO

 and exercise, similar to the response of marrow fat (increasing in DIO and significantly 
decreasing in the setting of exercise). Beginning with larger fat stores, this suggests that the 
marrow fat can be utilized as fuel for the costs of bone formation. This was also the case for 
the increase in MAT in mice treated with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone:(29) PPARγ 
induced MAT, extending even beyond the diaphysis, but this fat was attenuated by exercise 
with decreases comparable to control running animals. Interestingly in rosiglitazone-treated 
mice, intracortical porosity was higher, suggesting a negative effect on bone quality.(29) This 
may represent a direct effect of the PPARγ agonist on mesenchymal precursors,(81) perhaps 
to interfere with adaptive remodeling. Interestingly, the increased marrow fat content shown 
in postmenopausal women was reduced during treatment with teriparatide to induce bone 
formation.(82)
In addition to emphasizing the physiologic role of MAT in the setting of exercise and 
obesity, this study also serves to correlate MAT response to that of bone quantity and quality. 
Several studies show that obesity is associated with higher bone density,(83,84) although data 
from the Women’s Health Initiative suggest that BMD scales with lean mass, rather than 
total body weight or fat mass.(85) In our mouse study, obese sedentary mice had similar 
trabecular bone quantity and slightly reduced cortical bone quantity compared with mice fed 
a control diet (Fig. 4). Biomechanical properties in the Tibial mid-diaphysis were improved 
in the obese compared with the lean mice. Additionally, although femoral bones were bigger 
in DIO mice, they had a smaller bone area fraction and circumferentially larger marrow area 
(Fig. 7), which might suggest that obesity—in the setting of sedentary state—is associated 
with an increase in endosteal bone resorption. The endosteal volume expansion in DIO mice 
is compensated by an increase in MOI, resulting in a similar resistance to bending. 
Interestingly, the same increase in bending resistance is achieved in exercised DIO mice, not 
by expansion of the polar moments of inertia, but by increasing cortical thickness. Although 
the periosteal volume remained the same after exercise in the setting of obesity, the 
endosteal volume was reduced, in what appears an attempt to normalize the shift in bone 
compromised by obesity. Importantly, the distribution of biomechanical data in the exercise 
groups have lower standard deviations, perhaps reflecting the ability of exercise or 
mechanical loading toward regulating bone’s mechanical properties or increasing its ability 
to withstand load across a given surface area. Perhaps exercise and/or mechanical stimuli 
serve to organize cells and tissues down a predictable pathway of formation (or reduced 
resorption), whereas negligible mechanical input results in more varied outcomes. The 
inclusion of mechanical load in the form of exercise reduces the endosteal volume by 
increasing cortical thickness. B6 mice experience an age-related reduction in trabecular 
BV/TV as well as an age-related increase in trabecular thickness.(86) Our data demonstrate 
that both trabecular BV/TV as well as trabecular thickness are significantly higher in 
exercisers. This could be due to exercise-induced bone formation or to an effect to slow bone 
loss. Nevertheless, recovering cortical bone area and thickness after exercise highlights its 
ability to orchestrate more tightly organized bone remodeling processes, independent of 
bone size.(87)
A limitation of our work includes the use of mice to answer questions about MAT and its 
relevance to bone health, and yet prior studies in mice confirm that MAT abundance is 
similar to that of humans in pathologic states including postmenopausal osteoporosis, aging, 
Styner et al.

 and anorexia nervosa.(24) Thus, our data are relevant to the understanding of skeletal health 
in humans. Additionally, dietary and exercise trials in humans can be fraught with bias, an 
important factor in pursuing experiments in rodents that illuminate the mechanistic 
underpinnings of human disease.
In sum, our data beg the question of whether all MAT is equivalent. In comparison to diet-
induced increases in MAT, bone fat has historically been associated with decreased bone 
quantity and strength, as in postmenopausal osteoporosis, anorexia, unloading bone loss, and 
phosphate restriction,(24,88,89) suggesting an inverse relationship arising out of potential 
MSC biasing to promote adipocyte rather than osteoblast differentiation. Our data 
demonstrating loss of lipid in marrow adipocytes in response to running exercise indicate 
that marrow fat serves as a fuel depot. Further, the presence of marrow fat does not prevent 
MSC recruitment for adaptive bone formation. It is, however, likely that in 
pathophysiological conditions such as aging or unloading, where marrow fat is also present, 
that a loss of an adaptive loop recruiting osteoblasts to remodeling bone surfaces might 
compromise this energy store. Whether MAT rises because of the inability of osteoblasts to 
utilize available fuel or because MSC are prevented from entering the osteoblast lineage is 
an important question for future studies. What is evident here is that DIO results in higher 
marrow volume, causing the bone to alter its strategy to maintain strength (higher MOI). 
Exercise reduces MAT, increases local markers of fat utilization, and enables bone quantity/ 
quality to be achieved by a more robust skeleton, rather than a larger one. Exercise appears 
to drive a more organized form of bone remodeling as a strategic means to accommodate the 
changes brought on by obesity. Exercise improves bone quantity and quality in LFD and 
DIO, but the obese exercisers benefited more as they began with an adaptation away from 
the norm.
