Predicting survival after acute civilian
penetrating brain injuries
The SPIN score
ABSTRACT
Objective: To identify predictors associated with survival in civilian penetrating traumatic brain
injury (pTBI) utilizing a contemporary, large, diverse 2-center cohort, and to develop a parsimoni-
ous survival prediction score for pTBI.
Methods: Our cohort comprised 413 pTBI patients retrospectively identified from the local
trauma registries at 2 US level 1 trauma centers, of which one was predominantly urban and
the other predominantly rural. Predictors of in-hospital and 6-month survival identified in univar-
iate and multivariable logistic regression were used to develop the simple Surviving Penetrating
Injury to the Brain (SPIN) score.
Results: The mean age was 33 6 16 years and patients were predominantly male (87%). Survival
at hospital discharge as well as 6 months post pTBI was 42.4%. Higher motor Glasgow Coma
Scale subscore, pupillary reactivity, lack of self-inflicted injury, transfer from other hospital,
female sex, lower Injury Severity Score, and lower international normalized ratio were indepen-
dently associated with survival (all p , 0.001; model area under the curve 0.962). Important
radiologic factors associated with survival were also identified but their addition to the full mul-
tivariable would have resulted in model overfitting without much gain in the area under the curve.
Conclusions: The SPIN score, a logistic regression–based clinical risk stratification scale esti-
mating survival after pTBI, was developed in this large, diverse 2-center cohort. While this pre-
liminary clinical survival prediction tool does not include radiologic factors, it may support clinical
decision-making after civilian pTBI if external validation confirms the probability estimates.

The predominant experience of penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI) derives from battle-
field settings, but the contemporary civilian experience in patients treated after 2005 is limited to
small and single-center studies.1–5 As a result, the epidemiology of civilian pTBI in modern
trauma and neurocritical care settings remains incompletely understood, as does the neuroan-
atomical and biological basis for secondary brain injury. pTBI is often devastating, yet mortality
rates among trauma centers vary widely, between 44% and 100%.2 Gunshot wounds (GSW),
the primary mechanism for pTBI, are a serious public health problem. They account for a significant
proportion of deaths across all head trauma, and claim over 32,000 lives in the United States
annually,6 among .62,000 victims of firearms-related injuries.7 According to the most updated
2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, death rates by firearms comprised 5.1/
100,000 for homicides, and 6.7/100,000 for suicides.6 A comprehensive, multivariable assessment

 of disease-, patient- and hospital-specific charac-
teristics are lacking at a multicenter and popula-
tion level. Recent and recurrent civilian mass
shootings, and the severe wounding of US Con-
gresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, have
raised the public’s desire for understanding the
prognosis after pTBI.8,9 Defining pTBI outcome
determinants is the necessary first step to identify
potential strategies to improve patient outcomes.
In blunt TBI, clinical and anatomical predic-
tors of outcome have been validated.10,11 How-
ever, the pathophysiology of pTBI is distinct
from blunt TBI, and independent identification
and validation of predictors for survival are cru-
cial for families and physicians deciding about the
allocation of scarce resources and interventions.
The objectives of the current study were to
identify predictors associated with survival in
a modern, large, diverse 2-center cohort, and
to develop a parsimonious survival prediction
score for civilian pTBI.
METHODS Study design and population. We conducted
a retrospective study of consecutive patients with pTBI at the
level 1 trauma centers University of Maryland Shock-Trauma
Center ([UMSTC]; n 5 508) between January 1, 2000, and
December 31, 2009, and the University of Massachusetts
Medical School/UMASS Memorial Medical Center ([UMASS];
n 5 63) between June 20, 2003, and April 17, 2013, identified
from the local trauma registries. Data were obtained from the
trauma registry and medical records. Inclusion criteria were age
$18 years with confirmed pTBI involving perforation of the dura
on head CT (hCT) and clinical evidence of brain injury on
neurologic examination. The medical record was not available
for review in 16 patients at UMSTC and 24 patients at
UMASS. Patients who were dead on arrival were excluded
(UMSTC, n 5 115; UMASS, n 5 3), totaling 413 patients
(n 5 377 from UMSTC; n 5 36 from UMASS).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The institutional review boards at both centers
approved this study with a waiver of consent due to the retrospec-
tive design.

 Clinical management. Routine clinical care was provided anal-
ogously at both centers with attention to close adherence to the
Brain Trauma Foundation for severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) guidelines,12 as well as the American Association of Neu-
rological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons recom-
mendations for the management and treatment of pTBI,
including emergency neurosurgery.13–15 All patients were received
as level 1 trauma activations with immediate resuscitation occur-
ring in the trauma bays of the emergency departments (EDs).
Support of ventilation/oxygenation by intubation and hemody-
namic support to achieve a cerebral perfusion pressure $60 mm
Hg with isotonic fluids and vasopressors as well as 308 head of the
bed elevation was achieved. Coagulopathies were rapidly cor-
rected using blood products and tranexamic acid or activated
Factor VII (in patients on warfarin). Prothrombin complex con-
centrates were not yet available for clinical use during the study
period. All patients were immediately admitted to the neurotrau-
ma intensive care unit (ICU) under the care of board-certified
neurointensivists or surgical intensivists with expertise in
neurocritical care. Detailed descriptions of the ICU care for
severe TBI patients at both centers have been published.16,17
Measurements. Besides basic patient and hospital demograph-
ics, we recorded time-to-hospital arrival, transfer from other
hospital, mechanism of injury (GSW, knife, or other object),
and self-infliction. Clinical parameters included admission
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Abbreviated Injury Scale–
Head, and Injury Severity Score (ISS), calculated by the local
trauma attending, pupillary reactivity, and arrival systolic blood
pressure (SBP). Admission laboratory values were recorded. Illicit
substance use was documented using an initial urine or serum
toxicology screen. Each patient received a noncontrast hCT on
arrival. All hCT images were reviewed by 2 trained evaluators,
including one board-certified neurocritical care attending (K.N.S.
or S.M.) at each site, for bullet trajectory (tangential, penetrating,
perforating), injury anatomy (single lobe, multilobe/unilateral,
bilateral, or posterior fossa), side of injury (neither, right, left,
or both), presence of intracranial hemorrhage, intraventricular
hemorrhage,
subarachnoid
hemorrhage,
cisterns
(open,
compressed, absent), midline shift at the septum pellucidum,
and bullet track through the ventricles (figure 1). Furthermore,
placement of intracranial pressure monitor, craniectomy, use of
prophylactic antibiotics and antiepileptic drugs, and placement of
tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube were recorded. Discharge data
included hospital length of stay, overall withdrawal of care,
withdrawal of care on day 1, do not resuscitate status on
admission, mechanism of death, and discharge disposition.
Statistical analysis. The primary outcome measure was inpa-
tient survival; the secondary outcome measure was 6-month
survival. Initial frequencies were compared using x2 tests,
t tests, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. Associations
of individual parameters with discharge and 6-month survival
were calculated using univariate logistic regression. SBP was
grouped using clinically meaningful cutoffs: ,90 mm Hg,
$90–139 mm Hg, $140–180 mm Hg, and $180 mm Hg.
Motor GCS (mGCS) was first treated as an ordinal variable;
however, mGCS 2–5 had similarly small observation rates, and
each group separately did not have any statistically different as-
sociations with survival. Therefore, mGCS was collapsed into 3
groups: 1, 2–5, and 6. Variables with p value , 0.25 were can-
didates for the multivariable analysis. Multivariable logistic
regression models were constructed incrementally by manually
adding and removing variables due to the large number of uni-
variate associations with survival. We created a base model using
the validated International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of
Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) variables10 for blunt TBI:
mGCS, pupillary reactivity, (hypotension [SBP ,90 mm Hg],
and hypoxia in the field or ED [O2 saturation ,90%]). Of these,
only mGCS and pupillary reactivity were significant predictors,
and formed the final base model. Next, grouped variables from
the radiologic, demographic, injury, and laboratory categories
were manually added and eliminated stepwise. Variables indepen-
dently associated with survival (p , 0.05 using Wald statistic) and
resulting in the best model fit, assessed by 22 log-likelihood and
C statistic, remained. Variables were examined for colinearity and
interaction. We combined group variables with the base model as
able without overfitting to construct a parsimonious multivariable
model. From this, we developed a risk stratification scale. The
nearest
integer
from
the
parameter
estimates
from
the
multivariable logistic model was used to assign the score points
for the Surviving Penetrating Injury to the Brain (SPIN) score.
Associations with survival were expressed in odds ratios with
95% confidence intervals. p Values , 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC)
was used for all analyses.
RESULTS Among the 413 patients, the mean age was
33 6 16 years; 87% were male and 58% were black
(table 1). A total of 175 patients (42.4%) survived to
hospital discharge and 6 months after pTBI, with no
additional deaths between hospital discharge and 6
months at either center. A total of 156 (41.4%) sur-
vived at UMSTC, and 19 (52.8%) at UMASS. There
were several baseline differences between the UMSTC
and UMASS cohorts (table 1): UMSTC patients were
generally younger, predominantly black, more often
had isolated pTBI with lower ISS, more commonly
had prior traumas, less commonly had self-inflicted
pTBI, were less commonly transferred from other
centers, and had lower survival rates.
Laboratory values were similar between the cen-
ters, except UMASS patients were more anemic,
had lower median platelet counts, and had more ele-
vated alcohol levels (table 1). Additional baseline var-
iables are shown in table e-1 at Neurology.org.
hCTs were available for review in 336 (89.1%)
UMSTC patients and in 35 (97.2%) UMASS pa-
tients (table e-2). Most had penetrating (53.3%)
compared to perforating (22.5%) and tangential
(14.3%) trajectories. Admission hCTs were similar
between the centers, except UMASS patients had
higher proportions of penetrating or perforating inju-
ries and intraventricular, intracranial, and subarach-
noid hemorrhage.
Univariate associations with survival are shown in
table e-3, and identified several candidate variables for
the multivariable analysis.
The multivariable base model (mGCS and pupil-
lary reactivity) revealed a C statistic of 0.935
(figure 2). Three separate additional multivariable
models were constructed: model 1 (base 1 injury
variables), model 2 (base 1 radiologic variables), and
model 3 (base 1 laboratory variables), which all

 attained slightly improved C statistics compared to
the already very high base model’s C statistic. Com-
bining the base, injury, and laboratory variables
(model 4) achieved the highest C statistic of 0.962
(figure 2) with lower ISS, lack of self-inflicted injury,
transfer, female sex, and lower international normal-
ized ratio (INR) as independent predictors of sur-
vival while adjusting for mGCS and pupillary
reactivity (table 2). Adding radiologic variables into
this combined model would have resulted in model
overfitting, and therefore was not possible. After
adjusting for mGCS and pupillary reactivity, trajec-
tory, lack of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),
lack of cisternal compression, and single (vs multi-
ple) penetrating brain injury at one time remained as
independent predictors of survival (table 2).
The SPIN score, a survival risk stratification scale,
was developed as a sum of individual points (figure 3)
from model 4 (base 1 injury 1 laboratory model).
The score ranged from 4 to 52, with higher scores
indicating stronger likelihood of survival. To facilitate
the score’s usefulness, mGCS, ISS, and INR were
divided into the clinically most meaningful categories.
In the model, 98% of the patients with a SPIN score
of $35 survived, while only 3% of the patients with
a score of #20 survived (figure 3). In fact, there were
no patients with a SPIN score of #16 who survived.
DISCUSSION In this contemporary, large, ethnically
diverse, civilian pTBI population from 2 centers, we
found that admission mGCS and pupillary reactivity
(base model) were by far the strongest predictors of
survival. We identified several additional independent
predictors of survival. However, mGCS and pupillary
reactivity were such dominant predictors that the
other variables improved the survival prediction accu-
racy only minimally.
Other studies examining specifically GSW have
previously identified an association with lower pre-
senting GCS and pupillary reactivity with higher
mortality and worse functional outcomes.2,3,5 We
applied this to our large mixed pTBI cohort, which
included mostly but not exclusively GSWs. Our
sequential model building approach confirmed both
mGCS and pupillary reactivity as the strongest pre-
dictors of survival with a very high area under the
curve. Unlike all other studies on GSW, which used
total GCS, we intentionally used mGCS, as landmark
studies in blunt TBI have shown that in cohorts with
mostly intubated patients (as is the case in pTBI), the
verbal subscore cannot be obtained due to the pres-
ence of the endotracheal tube, and the eye opening
subscore is not consistently and reliably recorded,
partially due to several external factors, including drug
or alcohol intoxication.18,19 We did not equate the
verbal GCS subscore to 1 in intubated patients, as
it underestimates GCS. Therefore, as in the IMPACT
score,10 we used mGCS in our model.
We found that increasing ISS was independently
associated with lower odds for survival. ISS indicates

 the presence of additional body injuries and polytrau-
ma, which portends a higher mortality risk due to
systemic injury. Further, self-inflicted pTBI was inde-
pendently associated with lower odds for survival. In
fact, our multivariable adjustment revealed an almost
80% higher odds for dying when the pTBI was self-
inflicted. This is likely explained by the close proxim-
ity between the entry point of the penetrating object
and the brain, with a higher ballistic and more
destructive energy. Lower INR indicated higher odds
for survival, due to improved hemostasis. We are
unable to conclude from our data whether our pa-
tients’ admission INRs were elevated due to warfarin
intake or the presence of disseminated intravascular
coagulation from the pTBI.
Female patients had 76% higher odds for survival
compared to men, even after adjusting for severity of
injury. Female sex has been shown to be protective in
blunt TBI,20 although the reason for this remains
unclear. While several preclinical and uncontrolled
clinical studies have suggested that progesterone pro-
vides neuroprotection,21–23 this was not confirmed in
large clinical trials in early severe blunt TBI.24,25
However, one additional explanation may be that
female patients may have less severe pTBI as they
commonly practice less risky behaviors that predis-
pose to pTBI. Alternatively, our injury severity
adjustment using ISS may not be robust enough to
control for pTBI severity.
We found it surprising that transfer from another
hospital was associated with survival; one would
assume that direct admission to a level 1 trauma cen-
ter would result in improved outcomes due to faster
specialty trauma care and resuscitation. Our finding
may be explained by the fact that patients were only
transferred if they survived the initial resuscitation.
Further, we excluded all patients who were dead on
arrival. Therefore, we call for the attempt to validate
transfer from other hospital as a predictor of survival
in other cohorts.

 Unexpectedly, age was not associated with survival
in our adjusted base model. Patients with pTBI are
younger in general (mean age #35 years), and there-
fore age is not an explanatory predictor of outcome in
pTBI as seen in other diseases afflicting elderly,
including blunt TBI, stroke, or cancer.
Other smaller studies examining factors on hCTs
have previously revealed that compression of the basal
cisterns, IVH, and bullet trajectory with involvement
of the zona fatalis, i.e., perforation through bilateral
lobes (except bilateral frontal lobes), brainstem, and
the ventricles indicate much worse outcomes.1,2,5,26
These studies, however, included only 119 hCTs or
fewer, and did not have the statistical power to examine
the associations of specific neuroanatomical CT find-
ings to outcomes in a more refined way. Our study
comprising 371 hCTs revealed that survival was inde-
pendently and incrementally associated with a penetrat-
ing or tangential trajectory, compared to a perforating
trajectory. Similarly, the presence of open or com-
pressed cisterns each carried a 5 times higher odds
for survival compared to absent cisterns on hCT. This
suggests that aggressive resuscitation should not be
withheld based upon presence of a penetrating (but
not perforating) trajectory, or compressed (but not
absent) cisterns. Importantly, none of the radiologic
factors we found to be associated with survival was
included in the SPIN score to prevent model overfit-
ting. Therefore, the SPIN score remains preliminary.
Even in examples of very low SPIN scores, the radio-
logic findings should still be considered before making
clinical decisions about a patient.
Our study also revealed that single rather than con-
comitant multiple pTBI was independently associated
with 87% higher odds for survival in the adjusted
model. This association has not been reported before,
although clinically it is not surprising. It is rare to have
multiple pTBI at once, and only 8% of patients in our
cohort presented with multiple pTBI. However, our
study’s power was sufficient to document its associa-
tion with outcome for the first time.
Interestingly, at both centers, the proportion of
patients surviving pTBI was the same at hospital dis-
charge as at 6 months postinjury. We paid particular
attention to whether this may be due to incomplete
follow-up information. At both centers, however,

 we confirmed through inpatient and outpatient chart
review, as well as the public death certificate registry,
that survivors were still alive at 6 months, while the
deceased had died during the hospital admission
within the early period after injury.
Our study has important limitations. We did not
internally or externally validate the SPIN score. We
considered but decided against internal validation to
maximize the power of the full cohort for score develop-
ment. External validation is ideal, and in planning.
Until then, the SPIN score remains preliminary. We
excluded patients who were dead on arrival, because
we were looking for factors associated with survival
for the purpose of bedside prognostication. We may
have overlooked other important variables that are asso-
ciated with imminent death prior to hospital arrival.
Our cohort is mostly composed of UMSTC patients,
thereby potentially skewing our models towards the
urban pTBI population and underestimating factors
unique to a rural population. Both subcohorts stem
from academic US East Coast centers, and therefore
findings may not be generalizable to other geographic
areas. Importantly, our cohort comprises a large propor-
tion of minorities. In the United States, pTBI is more
prevalent in minority populations7; hence our cohort is
representative of the population at highest risk for

 pTBI. Our study does not prove causality or modifi-
ability. It remains unclear whether early and aggressive
interventions to improve mGCS and pupillary reactiv-
ity by use of aggressive resuscitation, osmotherapy, or
neurosurgery ultimately alters outcome. Due to the
study’s retrospective nature, some variables were incom-
pletely collected because of unavailability. For the same
reasons, we were inherently unable to confirm reliably
whether the care at both centers was truly identical,
although clinical care was provided at each institution
according to level 1 trauma center standards following
published guidelines. Therefore, it is conceivable that
institutional differences in the routine clinical care of
patients existed, resulting in unadjusted biases. We
standardized the definitions for our variables pre hoc
so that the data acquisition was as uniform as possible.
While the attempt at both centers is not to discuss
withdrawal of care with the family or setting treatment
limitations before 48 hours after admission, we cannot
adjust for center- or physician-specific biases that may
have led to early limitations of care. Therefore, we were
not able to control for early self-fulfilling prophecies or
therapeutic nihilism, a common dilemma in all studies
involving
critically
ill
brain-injured
patients.27–29
Finally, we did not examine whether the GCS and
pupillary findings were irreversible or improved serially.
Future studies should address whether patients with
early clinical findings suggestive of poor outcome
improve in the first 12–24 hours, and whether this
improvement carries further prognostic value.
In this large, contemporary 2-center US cohort,
we identified important clinical and radiologic predic-
tors associated with survival after pTBI. Higher
mGCS and pupillary reactivity on admission were
by far the strongest independent predictors of sur-
vival, with all other independent predictors adding
only very little to the improvement of the models’
C statistic. The SPIN score has not been validated
and does not contain radiologic factors, and therefore
is currently a preliminary tool that may provide guid-
ance for physicians and families in their direction-of-
care decision-making in patients with pTBI.
