SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death, but stakeholders have recently raised concerns about the pace
of innovation and investment in developing new therapeutics. Here, the authors characterized temporal trends in
cardiovascular research and development over the past 2 decades and the likelihood of successful completion of pre-
approval clinical trials. The authors also evaluated the reasons for discontinuation, novelty, and rates of trial results
publication for cardiovascular therapies in late-stage development. Between 1990 and 2012, the number of new car-
diovascular drugs entering clinical trials declined across all stages of development (p < 0.001 for linear trends). There
was no evidence for a difference in probability of successful progression to the next stage of development between
cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs. Small and medium-sized companies sponsored 43%, 38%, and 31% of new
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials, respectively. Roughly one-half of the drugs in Phase 3 trials were categorized as
targeting a novel biological pathway. The number of cardiovascular trials sponsored by small and medium-sized com-
panies and the number of novel drugs entering Phase 3 trials increased over time. Most drugs were discontinued in Phase 3
due to inadequate efficacy (44%) or safety issues (24%), but the Phase 3 trial results for only one-half of the discontinued
drugs were published in peer-reviewed journals. These results shed light on important shifts in research and development
activity and confirm the perceived challenges in cardiovascular translational research. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans

T
he development of new prescription drugs
and
their
adoption
into
clinical
practice
have been associated with significant reduc-
tions in cardiovascular mortality over the past 2
decades (1). Despite this progress, cardiovascular dis-
ease is a leading cause of death in the developing
world and still accounts for 1 in 3 deaths in the United
States (1–5). The productivity of translational research
in this field has recently come under scrutiny amidst
concerns over the declining pipeline of novel thera-
pies (6). Proposed explanations for the discrepancy
between the slowdown in innovation and burden of
disease include the rising cost of conducting large
cardiovascular outcome trials, stagnating financial in-
vestment, and diminished commercial attractiveness
of the cardiovascular field owing to availability of

 low-cost generic medications (6,7). Several
high-profile failures of clinical development
have
contributed
to
this
perception.
For
example, in 2012, a large Phase 3 trial of
varespladib, a secretory phospholipase A2 in-
hibitor hypothesized to improve cardiovas-
cular outcomes, was halted when an interim
analysis found that the drug was in fact asso-
ciated with an increased risk of myocardial
infarction (8).
There are limited data on trends in cardio-
vascular research and development and the
factors associated with the success of new
therapies in clinical trials. It has been previ-
ously reported that the number of new cardiovascular
drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) has declined in recent years (6,9). A
contraction in the pool of cardiovascular drugs under
development has also been reported (10), but trends in
new drugs that have entered clinical testing or those
that have been discontinued remain undefined.
In this study, we describe temporal trends in car-
diovascular drug development over the past 2 de-
cades, analyze the likelihood that investigational
cardiovascular
drugs
successfully
complete
pre-
approval clinical trials, and characterize the novelty
of drug pathways, reasons for discontinuation, and
rates of publishing trial results for new drugs in late-
stage development.
METHODS
DATA
SOURCES
AND
EXTRACTION. We analyzed
data
from
a
large
commercial
database
of
drug
development
activity
(Citeline
Pharmaprojects,
Informa plc, London, United Kingdom), which tracks
in real time the pipeline of pharmaceutical research
and development projects. This database covers more
than 50,000 products for all diseases from pre-clinical
to commercialization stage and is widely used by
industry and researchers to analyze trends in drug
development (11–15). Using methods described pre-
viously (16), we selected for analysis all products that
had entered Phase 1 clinical trials between January 1,
1990, and December 31, 2012 (N ¼ 4,715). For each
product, we extracted key information, including
generic and proprietary names, sponsor, primary
indication, mechanism of action (if known), start and
end dates of each phase of clinical testing, date of
regulatory approval (if applicable), and date and
reason for discontinuation (e.g., failure to demon-
strate efficacy, safety concerns, commercial/financial).
On the basis of the primary indication, each product
was mapped to an Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
(ATC) code, which categorizes drugs according to the
organ or system on which they act and their thera-
peutic and chemical characteristics. We focused on
drugs intended to treat disorders of the cardiovascular
system (ATC code C), such as antihypertensive, anti-
arrhythmic, antianginal, and lipid-lowering agents,
and disorders of blood and blood-forming organs
(ATC code B), such as blood fraction and plasma
substitutes, and anticoagulant, antithrombotic, anti-
fibrinolytic and antianemic agents. We also compared
rates of cardiovascular drugs entering clinical trials
with those of cancer drugs (ATC code L01) and central
nervous system (CNS) drugs (ATC code N, except N01
and N02) (11). We categorized all sponsors in our study
cohort into large pharmaceutical companies, defined
as companies with gross revenues >$1 billion, and
small
and
medium-sized
companies.
Next,
we
searched Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science for
peer-reviewed publications of trial results, and search
engines, press releases, and other publicly available
sources for the stated reasons (if any) for discontinu-
ation of drug development.
Finally, 2 investigators (T.J.H. and J.C.L.) catego-
rized
cardiovascular
drugs
that
entered
Phase
3
trials during our study period as targeting a “novel
pathway” or “other target.” Consistent with prior
studies by the FDA and others (17–19), we defined a
novel pathway as a target or biological pathway for
which the FDA had not yet approved a therapeutic
agent by the pivotal trial start year. Changes in
formulation (e.g., the first oral alternative to existing
intravenously administered products) and new com-
binations of existing drugs (with or without a new
agent) were considered novel pathways. Changes in
chirality (e.g., a purified single enantiomer form of an
already-approved racemic drug) were not considered
to be a novel pathway. Any disagreements (repre-
senting w5% of cases) were resolved by consensus.
All data were initially downloaded on June 28,
2013, and information on publication status and
novelty was updated through March 1, 2016. This
study was not submitted for institutional review
board review, because it is based on publicly available
data and involved no patient health records.
OUTCOME
MEASURES. We
first
studied
temporal
trends in the number of new Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical
trials started for investigational cardiovascular drugs
over time and compared these trends to those for
drugs intended to treat cancer and CNS disorders. We
also evaluated the proportion of such trials started by
small and medium-sized companies. Because the

 absolute number of new trials would not capture
differential rates
of
development activity
among
therapeutic areas, the primary outcome was the pro-
portion of new cardiovascular drug trials relative to
all new clinical trials in a given year.
Our second outcome of interest was the likelihood
of survival of cardiovascular drugs, defined as the
probability of successfully proceeding from one clin-
ical trial phase to the subsequent phase of develop-
ment (e.g., Phase 1 to Phase 2). Because companies
often
discontinue
development
projects
without
public disclosure, we used a conservative approach to
identify
“implicitly”
discontinued
products
by
assuming that projects with no development reported
for 3 calendar years or more from the start date for
Phase 1 and 5 calendar years or more for Phase 2 and
Phase 3 were discontinued. Our third outcome of
interest was the proportion of new Phase 3 trials
started for drugs targeting novel pathways over time.
Finally, we analyzed the reasons for discontinuation
of cardiovascular drugs in late-stage development
(i.e., during or after Phase 3 trials) and the rate of
publication of the results from these trials.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. We calculated the propor-
tion of new Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials for car-
diovascular drugs relative to all new clinical trials and
compared to those for cancer and CNS drugs, the
proportion
of
new
trials
started
by
small
and
medium-sized
companies,
and
the
proportion
of
Phase 3 trials started for drugs targeting novel path-
ways. We used linear regression for trend analysis of
continuous variables, and we used the Fisher exact
test to compare the difference in proportion of new
trials started by small and medium-sized companies
for cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular drugs.
To determine the probability of progression of
drugs in development, we constructed Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models for each phase
change (i.e., Phase 1 to 2, Phase 2 to 3, and Phase 3 to
regulatory filing). A key assumption of the Cox pro-
portional hazards model is the proportionality of
hazards. Although no violations of proportionality
were observed in the Phase 3 model, the assumption
of proportional hazards was not met for the Phase 1
and Phase 2 models, indicating that the estimated
hazard ratios (HRs) from these models should be
interpreted as the average HR over time. For the
models corresponding to progression from Phase 2 to
Phase 3 and from Phase 3 to regulatory filing, we
restricted
our
analysis
to
products
that
entered
testing by January 1, 2008, because inclusion of more
recent trials may bias our results due to our 5-year
discontinuation threshold. As a sensitivity analysis,
we used logistic regression and also repeated our
analysis excluding hematologic drugs (i.e., only ATC
code C).
Next, we constructed multivariable linear regres-
sion to examine factors associated with drugs cate-
gorized as targeting novel pathways. Models included
all variables of interest regardless of statistical sig-
nificance: firm type (an indicator variable for large
pharmaceutical company vs. small and medium-sized
companies), indicators for therapeutic area, and a
continuous time variable. Finally, we used descrip-
tive statistics to summarize the reasons for cardio-
vascular drug discontinuations as due to efficacy,
safety, or commercial or other reasons.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata
version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Two-
tailed p values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Our study cohort comprised 347 cardiovascular drugs
that entered Phase 1 testing between 1990 and 2012, of
which 239 (69%) were categorized under ATC code C,
corresponding to drugs for the cardiovascular system
(e.g., antihypertensive agents) and 108 (31%) were
categorized under ATC code B, corresponding to he-
matologic drugs (e.g., antithrombotic agents and
blood substitutes). The most common types of prod-
ucts under development were antihypertensive agents
(18%, 19%, and 25% of new cardiovascular Phase 1, 2,
and 3 trials, respectively), lipid-lowering agents (22%,
20%, and 12%), and anticoagulants (9%, 6%, and 9%).
The number of new cardiovascular drugs entering
clinical trials in all stages of development declined
over time (p < 0.001 for linear trend in Phases 1 to 3)
(Figure 1). Between 1990 and 1995, 108 of 679 (16%)
Phase 1 trials were initiated for cardiovascular drugs,
compared with 125 of 2,366 (5%) Phase 1 trials be-
tween 2005 and 2012. Similarly, cardiovascular drugs
accounted for 21% of all Phase 3 trials in 1990 but only
7% in 2012. This decline was similar to that for CNS
drugs, whereas the number of new cancer drugs
increased over the same period (Figure 2).
Large pharmaceutical companies sponsored most
clinical trials for investigational cardiovascular drugs.
Overall, small and medium-sized companies accoun-
ted for 43% of new Phase 1 trials for cardiovascular
drugs, 38% of new Phase 2 trials, and 31% of new
Phase 3 trials. In all 3 phases, the proportion of car-
diovascular trials started by small and medium-sized
companies was significantly smaller than that for
noncardiovascular trials (p < 0.001 for all phases), but
the number of cardiovascular trials sponsored by

 small and medium-sized companies grew over time
(Supplemental Figure 1).
PROGRESS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS THROUGH
DEVELOPMENT. We found no evidence for a differ-
ence in probability of survival (defined as successful
progression to the next stage of development) be-
tween cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs in
Phase 1 (HR: 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78 to
1.38; p ¼ 0.41), Phase 2 (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.18;
p ¼ 0.29), and Phase 3 (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.54 to 1.43;
p ¼ 0.70) (Figure 3). In a sensitivity analysis excluding
hematologic
drugs
(ATC
code
B),
similar
results
were obtained, with no significant differences in
probability
observed
between
cardiovascular
and
noncardiovascular drugs in all phases of development
(p > 0.06). Repeating our analysis with logistic
regression yielded substantively similar results.
DRUGS TARGETING NOVEL BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS.
Overall, 50% (89 of 177) of cardiovascular drugs
entering Phase 3 trials were categorized as targeting a
novel biological pathway. Over time, the rate of novel
drugs entering Phase 3 trials increased, with novel
drugs accounting for 27% of Phase 3 cardiovascular
trials in 1990 to 1991 and 57% in 2012 (p ¼ 0.004 for
linear trend) (Supplemental Figure 2). In multivari-
able analyses, none of the studied variables were
significant predictors of novel drug status.
DISCONTINUATION OF DEVELOPMENT FOR EFFICACY
AND
SAFETY
REASONS. Among
63
cardiovascular
drug discontinuations in Phase 3, the reasons for
discontinuing development were identifiable for 54
(86%) (Figure 4). Clinical development for 28 (44%)
cardiovascular drugs was discontinued due to poor
efficacy, and 15 (24%) were discontinued due to safety
issues, including 7 drugs that were associated with an
increased risk of death. A further 11 (17%) drugs were
discontinued for commercial or other strategic rea-
sons. The results from the Phase 3 trials were pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals for roughly one-half
(32 of 63, 51%) of these drugs with discontinued
development.
Selected examples of discontinuations of cardio-
vascular drugs due to efficacy or safety reasons are
shown in Table 1 (20–23). For example, the develop-
ment of several lipid-modulating agents was dis-
continued
after
disappointing
results
from
large
controlled trials. A Phase 3 trial of torcetrapib, a
cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor,
was prematurely terminated in 2006 after a signifi-
cantly increased risk of death was observed in treated
patients (23). Nolomirole, a neurohormonal agent and
selective dopaminergic D2 and adrenergic a2 agonist,
failed to show benefit in reducing or slowing time to
death or hospitalization among patients with heart
failure (21).
DISCUSSION
This study sheds light on several important shifts in
cardiovascular research and development activity
that have occurred over the past 2 decades. We found
that the share of new cardiovascular drugs entering

 clinical trials has fallen since 1990, both in absolute
terms and in comparison to drugs in other therapeutic
areas,
such
as
the
development
of
new
cancer
therapeutics.
In
parallel,
over
time,
small
and
medium-sized companies have sponsored a greater
proportion of trials for new therapies.
Our findings confirm the perceived challenges in
cardiovascular translational research, extending pre-
viously reported declines in successful cardiovascular
drug approvals (6) to show that there have been fewer
new investigational cardiovascular drugs across all
stages of clinical development, particularly in late-
stage development. Although the numbers may be
declining overall, we also found a relative growth in
the number of drugs entering late-stage testing that
targeted novel biological pathways, suggesting that
the observed contraction in cardiovascular research
output may be driven by fewer follow-on drugs. This
trend is consistent with a prior study that found a
decrease over the past decade in the number of FDA
approvals for drugs that were not first-in-class (17).
Cardiovascular drugs do not appear to be any less
likely to successfully complete clinical trials than
other drugs, even in Phase 3. Although they can be
time consuming and costly to conduct, Phase 3
comparative clinical trials also provide the highest
level of evidence on safety and efficacy to justify
utilization in the intended patient population. As
such, the consensus of stakeholders from industry,
academia, and regulators was that “despite a temp-
tation
to
use
surrogate
endpoints
to
decrease
sample sizes and shorten the duration of clinical
trials
(ostensibly
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
drug-development failures)[.]we must continue to
promote large, pragmatic trials to measure clinical
outcomes when evaluating new cardiovascular ther-
apies” (6). For example, a recent FDA advisory com-
mittee stressed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol levels were not a reliable surrogate for
cardiovascular benefit, and that timely completion of
outcome trials was imperative (24). Among cardio-
vascular drugs for which the development was halted
in Phase 3, our study found that most were dis-
continued due to inadequate efficacy, underscoring
the importance of rigorous trials in elucidating the
risk–benefit balance of new treatments.
In some cases, early and compelling evidence of
superior efficacy, compared with existing treatment
options, tilts the risk–benefit balance towards faster
patient access, and various regulatory programs can
be leveraged to appropriately expedite the develop-
ment and approval of these treatments. For example,
in
March
2014,
the
PARADIGM-HF
(Prospective
Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact
on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure)
trial of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto, Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland) was stopped early when investigators
reported that the combination significantly reduced
the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart
failure (25). In April, the sponsor notified the FDA,
which subsequently granted fast-track designation
(which provides rolling review of the new drug
application, more frequent communication with FDA

 reviewers, and other actions to expedite develop-
ment) and priority review (which requires the FDA to
make a decision within 6 months, rather than the
standard 10-month timeline). The first full approval
was granted by the FDA in July 2015, with approvals
by authorities in Canada and Europe in October and
November 2015, respectively.
Advances in translational science may yield further
breakthroughs, and policymakers seeking to promote
innovation
in
cardiovascular
drug
development
should prioritize new incentives for such research,
particularly
given
the
demonstrated
potential
of
recent
cardiovascular
translational
efforts.
For
example,
the
discovery
of
proprotein
convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) (26), identification of
mutations in PCSK9 that reduce LDL cholesterol
(27–29), and the ensuing validation of PCSK9 as a
therapeutic target for the treatment of hypercholes-
terolemia (30,31) represent a recent success in the
efficient translation of academic research into novel
therapeutics. After the initial discovery in 2003, the
first human clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody to
PCSK9 was started in 2009 (32). In 2015, recognizing
the potential benefit of these drugs for high-risk pa-
tients, the FDA approved alirocumab and evolocumab
before the large cardiovascular outcome trials were
completed. Other inhibitors of PCSK9 are now under
development, including a RNA interference drug
(33,34) and a therapeutic vaccine (35).
Our results also indicate that the pivotal trial results
are frequently not published for drugs in which
development is discontinued. This paucity of infor-
mation,
particularly
on
development
failures,
is
problematic for investigators, as understanding why a
drug fails may yield insights for other drugs in the same
class and potentially guide efforts to repurpose failed
drugs for new indications. Such information could also
be useful to patients, who otherwise may be exposed to
futile treatments or to unnecessary harms (36,37). In
addition, even “failed” trials can yield valuable in-
sights on the pathophysiology of disease and the val-
idity of experimental systems and surrogate endpoints
(such as in the case of torcetrapib and the use of LDL

 cholesterol as a surrogate for cardiovascular out-
comes). To improve reporting rates, recently, the
National Institutes of Health issued a proposed regu-
lation to require that trials for unapproved drugs are
registered and that results are deposited in a public
repository. If enacted, this rule may further incen-
tivize investigators to share, at a minimum, summary
study results for all clinical trials (38).
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. We
used
publicly
available
sources and commercial databases to identify the
reasons for discontinuation, but additional factors
may have played a role in these failures. However, we
were able to identify the stated reasons for discon-
tinuation of development for most (86%) of the drugs
in our study cohort. In addition, although our study
period
was
chosen
to
allow
sufficient
time
for
follow-up, it is possible that some of the discontinued
drugs may be approved, and more trial results may be
published in the future.
CONCLUSIONS
Over the past 2 decades, fewer investigational car-
diovascular drugs have entered clinical trials across
all stages of development, though recently, more
therapies have targeted novel biological pathways
and have been sponsored by small and medium-sized
companies. Most cardiovascular drugs fail in Phase 3
clinical trials due to inadequate efficacy or safety
concerns, but cardiovascular drugs do not appear to
be more likely to fail than drugs for other diseases.
Given the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease
globally, the declining pipeline of new therapies is
concerning. Policymakers should focus their efforts
on supporting research aimed at improving gaps in
the understanding of the pathophysiological bases for
cardiovascular
disorders,
as
well
as
facilitating
translational efforts to develop new cardiovascular
therapeutics.

*The inclusion criteria for the cariporide trial also included patients undergoing a high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery. †The primary
outcome was the time to the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, a composite that included 4 components: death from coronary heart disease (defined as fatal MI
excluding procedure-related events, fatal heart failure, sudden cardiac death, or other cardiac death), nonfatal MI (excluding procedure-related events), stroke, and hospi-
talization for unstable angina.
MI ¼ myocardial infarction.
