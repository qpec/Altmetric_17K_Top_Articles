Abstract
Background
Despite numerous studies of geographic variation in healthcare cost and utilization at the
local, regional, and state levels across the U.S., a comprehensive characterization of geo-
graphic variation in outcomes has not been published. Our objective was to quantify varia-
tion in US health outcomes in an all-payer population before and after risk-adjustment.
Methods and Findings
We used information from 16 independent data sources, including 22 million all-payer inpa-
tient admissions from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (which covers regions
where 50% of the U.S. population lives) to analyze 24 inpatient mortality, inpatient safety,
and prevention outcomes. We compared outcome variation at state, hospital referral region,
hospital service area, county, and hospital levels. Risk-adjusted outcomes were calculated
after adjusting for population factors, co-morbidities, and health system factors. Even after
risk-adjustment, there exists large geographical variation in outcomes. The variation in
healthcare outcomes exceeds the well publicized variation in US healthcare costs. On aver-
age, we observed a 2.1-fold difference in risk-adjusted mortality outcomes between top- and
bottom-decile hospitals. For example, we observed a 2.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted
acute myocardial infarction inpatient mortality. On average a 10.2-fold difference in risk-
adjusted patient safety outcomes exists between top and bottom-decile hospitals, including
an 18.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted Central Venous Catheter Bloodstream Infection
rates. A 3.0-fold difference in prevention outcomes exists between top- and bottom-decile
counties on average; including a 2.2-fold difference for risk-adjusted congestive heart failure

range of R2 between 18–64% of variability in mortality outcomes, 3–39% of variability in
patient safety outcomes, and 22–70% of variability in prevention outcomes.
Conclusion
The amount of variability in health outcomes in the U.S. is large even after accounting for dif-
ferences in population, co-morbidities, and health system factors. These findings suggest
that: 1) additional examination of regional and local variation in risk-adjusted outcomes
should be a priority; 2) assumptions of uniform hospital quality that underpin rationale for
policy choices (such as narrow insurance networks or antitrust enforcement) should be chal-
lenged; and 3) there exists substantial opportunity for outcomes improvement in the US
healthcare system.
Introduction
Geographic variation in the cost and utilization of health care within the United States has
been well documented and much debated [1–16]. In 2010, a comprehensive study was
commissioned from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to investigate geographic variation in
health care spending and utilization [12–14]. The IOM study demonstrated 1.7x variation
between the highest cost decile Hospital Service Areas (top 10%) and the lowest cost decile
Hospital Service Areas (HSAs) (bottom 10%) in the US [14]. Additionally, prior research has
examined the impact of demographics and systems factors on variation in healthcare cost and
utilization [4–7,11,14,17–19].
Despite the extensive analysis of geographic variation in healthcare cost and utilization
across the U.S., equivalent characterization of geographic variation in outcomes has not been
published. Many studies focus on variation in cost, all-cause mortality, and process quality
measures, but geographic variation in specific health outcomes has not been examined compre-
hensively. Prior efforts have often focused on investigating the correlation between an out-
come and a single factor at a national level [20]. Research on the geographic variation of health
outcomes has typically been subject to a number of important limitations including: (a) focus
only on the Medicare population [21–31], which has recently been shown to be poorly repre-
sentative of the all-payer population [32], (b) focus on a narrow geography [24,27,33–39],
often looking at only one state or region of the US, (c) analyzing only a single or few outcomes
[22–26,33–37,40–43] and/or (d) using limited risk-adjustment [24,29,33,37,39,44], typically by
only adjusting for demographics and co-morbidities [42].
Finally, when geographic variation in outcomes is examined, most studies analyze out-
comes over large geographic areas (national [45], regional [41], state [11,22,25,30], or hospi-
tal referral region [23,28–30,43] (HRR)). This results in "over-averaging" which masks the
true extent of variation [46–48]. In fact, when the IOM examined variation in spending and
utilization it concluded that variation "can be explained not by HRR-level factors but by fac-
tors at the smaller, HSA geographic level." [14] Ultimately, the IOM explicitly commented
that, "more research on health care outcomes and quality is needed, particularly in commer-
cially insured populations".[14] Recently, analysis of commercially insured populations from
2007–2009 was published by McKellar and colleagues, in which 10 quality measures were

 examined for variation at the HRR level, including four outcomes measures, and six process
measures [49].
In this context, the present study provides a comprehensive analysis of geographic variation
in United States health outcomes. Our analysis is conducted at the state, HRR, HSA, county,
and hospital levels, both before and after risk-adjustment. The present study uses an all-payer
population, spanning the 50% of the United States for which geographically identified data is
available in the Health Care Utilization Project (HCUP), to examine 24 outcomes including
inpatient mortality (IQIs), patient safety (PSIs), and prevention measures (PQIs) with rigorous
risk-adjustment. These findings have important implications to all health care stakeholders
including patients, physicians, hospital systems, payers, policymakers, and pharmaceutical and
medical technology companies.
Methods
Data sources and study population
We analyzed outcomes variation across the United States using 2011 inpatient administrative
data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample
(NIS) and State Inpatient Databases (SID). The database includes over 22 million individual
patient encounters, covers regions where approximately 50% of the US population lives, and
includes hospitals responsible for 45% of all admissions. This data set represents the most
recent data available via SID and the NIS shared via HCUP where patient residence and hospi-
tal ID can be traced back to their geographic location at the HSA or county level. The set con-
sists of all states that chose to share this data (including AZ, AK, CA, CO, FL, MD, MA, NV,
NJ, NY, NC, OR, RI, UT, VT, WA, WV, WI). Importantly, the set includes data from all insur-
ers; allowing examination of outcomes on patients with both private and public insurance
[50,51]. All patients were included, as well as associated patient-level variables: age, gender,
race, length of stay, inpatient mortality, co-morbidities.
Health outcome measures
The outcomes selected for use in this study (Fig 1) are the result of an effort by the Agency for
Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) to develop measures of inpatient mortality (IQI),
inpatient safety (PSI), and prevention (PQI) for use with inpatient administrative data [52–
55]. The IQIs measure the number of in-hospital deaths per number of hospital discharges
with a specific principal diagnosis (e.g., principal diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction
(AMI)). The PSIs measure the rate of hospital complications (e.g., central venous catheter
infection rate) per applicable discharges. The PQIs measure the ratio of the number of hospital
admissions for a specific disease (e.g., Congestive Heart Failure) compared to the total number
of eligible residents in a given county. See Figure A in S1 File for the definitions of outcomes
used.
The 24 AHRQ measures, which have been used broadly by hospitals [56,57] and national
and international agencies [58–60], are collectively the set of measures which form the com-
bined mortality (IQI 91), inpatient safety (PSI 90), and prevention (PQI 90) indices respec-
tively [61–64], that have currently maintained endorsement by the National Quality Forum
through 2015 either individually or as a part of an index. AHRQ software was used to calculate
raw mortality, safety, and inpatient admissions rates using HCUP data following AHRQ tech-
nical specifications [65].

 Risk adjustment factors and data sources
In order to analyze potential factors accounting for variability in outcomes (Fig 2), we assem-
bled two databases containing population, co-morbidities, and health-systems factors. One
database was assembled for inpatient mortality (IQIs) and inpatient safety (PSIs) outcomes to
measure variation at the hospital level. A second database was assembled for the prevention
(PQIs) outcomes to measure variation at the county level. Factors included variables pulled
directly from the HCUP database (e.g. demographics, co-morbidities) and factors aggregated
from 16 publicly available sources (Figure B in S1 File). Of the sources used, 13 sources are
government sources such as the US Census, CMS, and USDA; 3 are academically well-cited
and respected private sources [66–68]. From these sources we selected well cited factors identi-
fied in the literature as potentially associated with health care outcomes (e.g., demographics,
socioeconomics, lifestyle, co-morbidities, utilization, etc.). We then limited the analysis to fac-
tors for which we had data for over 95% of hospitals/counties examined. To build the IQI/PSI
database, encounter-level HCUP data was aggregated to the hospital level. This hospital level
data was then linked to additional sources containing population and system factors for a total

Quality Forum through 2015 either individually or as a part of an index.

 of 64 risk-adjustment factors for IQI and PSIs (Figure C in S1 File). Analogously, to build the
PQI database, encounter-level HCUP data was aggregated to the county level. This county
level data was then linked to additional sources containing population and systems factors for
a total of 81 risk-adjustment factors for PQIs (Figure D in S1 File). All told, 10 population fac-
tors, 27 co-morbidities and 10 health system factors were consistent across all IQIs, PSIs, and
PQIs. An additional 17 health system factors were matched at the hospital level for the IQI/PSI
database. An additional 8 population factors and 26 health system factors were matched at the
county level for the PQI database.
Analytic methods
We used AHRQ SAS software to calculate raw un-adjusted outcomes across each of the 24
measures spanning inpatient mortality, inpatient safety, and prevention outcomes. We calcu-
lated IQI and PSI outcomes at the hospital level. We then mapped hospital-level outcomes to
HSA, HRR, and state regions for further analysis. Those HRRs in which data was only available
for less than 50% of their component HSAs were excluded from the HRR level analysis. This
was often the case for HRRs that spanned across two states for which HCUP only made avail-
able geographically identified data for one of the two states. PQI outcomes were calculated at
the county level and geographically mapped to states. The burden of co-morbidities was esti-
mated using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index [69], which is shown to outperform the Charl-
son Comorbidity Index [70], by using the Comorbidity Elements included in the HCUP
database.
We examined the relationship between a hospital’s case volume and that hospital’s out-
comes for the IQIs and PSIs (See Section A in S2 File: Volume-outcome relationship and Fig
3). We used a Bayesian Shrinkage method initiated by Clayton and Kaldor [71] and developed
by Dimick and Birkmeyer [72,73]to correct for low-volume hospital noise for all IQI and PSI
measures before reporting observed values. The method places more weight on a hospital’s
Fig 3. Volume-outcome relationship for inpatient mortality (IQI). We assessed the relationship between outcomes and hospital case volume by
modeling the mortality (M) as M = -α*ln(V)+β, where V is hospital case volume, and α and β are constants for each of the inpatient mortality outcomes.
As case volume increases in a hospital, mortality decreases across all IQI measures.

 mortality or complication rate when it is measured more reliably, due to a large number of
patients, but shrinks back toward the mean complication rate when a hospital’s rate cannot be
measured with high reliability due to a low number of events [72–74]. The shrinkage-adjusted
IQI and PSI rates were used for subsequent analysis. The volume-outcome relationship was
not calculated for PQI events as they are measured as the number of preventable admissions
over the total population of a county (i.e., whereas higher procedural volume within a hospital
is associated with lower mortality, more populous counties were not expected to show
improved preventable admissions rates). Hospitals or counties that were major outliers >5
standard deviations away from the mean were excluded from the analysis (~0.35% of all data
points).
To understand the impact of risk-adjustment, we calculated three sets of risk-adjusted out-
comes. The first set was risk-adjusted only for population factors, the second for both popula-
tion factors and co-morbidities and the third for population factors, co-morbidities, and
health system factors. After each step we examined the relationship between these factors and
each of the outcomes at the hospital level (for IQIs and PSIs) or county level (for PQIs). The
analysis was done as a series of unweighted linear regression models. The method was chosen
as it (a) allows for an intuitive representation of the R2 measure, (b) is the statistical methodol-
ogy generally used to risk-adjust AHRQ and other similar measures (e.g., normal distribution
based risk-adjustment is used by the US Government Center for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices to adjust mortality and re-admission rates [75]) and (c) is used in a large number of aca-
demic publications [19,56,76–81]. Our analysis was conducted step-wise, first, a model with
only population variables was used, then a model with population variables and co-morbidi-
ties, and finally a full model with population variables, co-morbidities, and system factors. To
select key factors from the full set of 64 or 81 factors, dimension reduction was performed
using elastic net penalized regression models. The elastic-net method uses both the ridge and
lasso penalties, and has the advantages of both approaches. The elastic-net method automati-
cally selects key factors, and thus efficiently resolves the problem caused by multicollinearity
[82]. We adjusted the tuning parameter (λ) to select factors such that the model would produce
the lowest error. After defining the optimal λ, this value was used to select appropriate popula-
tion and co-morbidity factors in the model [83],[84]. Lastly, we used a bootstrapping method-
ology to determine the 95% confidence interval for each model’s R-squared value describing
the effects of the investigated factors [85]. Bootstrapping uses a resampling with replacement
methodology in order to estimate the variance within the sample; in this analysis, the data was
resampled 10,000 times.
The AHRQ data fundamentally represent counts. The Poisson distribution is mathemati-
cally appropriate for this type of data, and has recently been used in a few publications related
to outcomes measures [86–88] Therefore, the analysis was repeated leveraging a Poisson
model to confirm results were robust to choice of distribution. Results of this analysis can be
found in Section B in S2 File.
Finally, to visualize geographic variation, we created heat maps using ArcGIS and Alteryx.
The rate in each HSA was calculated as a weighted average of hospitals in that area. The
weighting was done separately for each outcome and was based on the total number of relevant
cases—for example, in AMI mortality, the weighting was done based on a total number of
AMI patients admitted. Most of the HSAs contain only one hospital, but HCUP data-use
restrictions prohibit plotting regions that contain only one hospital. In order to comply with
these restrictions, HSAs with a single hospital were merged with the adjacent HSA that had the
most closely matched outcome rate and the rate in the new area was calculated based on dis-
charge weighted average of all hospitals in that area.

 Results
Large variation in health outcomes exists at the hospital level for IQIs and PSIs; and at the
county level for PQIs (Fig 4 and Figure E in S1 File). Variability decreases as outcomes are
risk-adjusted for population, co-morbidities, and health system factors (Fig 4). As expected,
variability also decreases as outcomes are aggregated into larger geographic units from the hos-
pital to HSA to HRR to State level (Fig 5).
For inpatient mortality measures, combined population, co-morbidities, and health systems
factors account for a range of R2 between 18% and 64% of variability depending on the out-
come, with an average of 41%. For patient safety measures, combined population, co-morbidi-
ties, and health systems factors account for a range of 3% to 39% of safety measure variability,
with an average of 22%. Finally, for prevention measures, combined population, co-morbidi-
ties, and health systems factors account for a range of 22% to 70% of prevention measure vari-
ability, with an average of 47%. For example, consider acute myocardial infarction: population
factors accounted for 21% of variation, adding co-morbidities accounted for an incremental
30% of variation, and adding system factors accounted for an incremental 13% of variation.
The specific variability of IQIs, PSIs, and PQIs at the hospital, county, HSA, HRR, and state
level are outlined below. Results are listed both before and after risk-adjustment.
IQIs
At the hospital level, IQIs have 90th to 10th percentile observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%)
of between 1.9 and 4.1, with an average of 2.9. At the HSA level, IQIs have observed ratios (top
10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.7 and 3.6, with an average of 2.5. At the HRR level, IQIs have
observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.3 and 2.1, with an average of 1.6. And
lastly, at the state level, IQIs have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.2 and
1.6, with an average of 1.4. Variation in health outcomes decreases as data is aggregated to
larger geographies. Among IQIs, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage Mortality Rate had the lowest
amount of variation, and Congestive Heart Failure Mortality rate had the highest amount of
variation.
Variation decreases after risk-adjustment. At the hospital level, IQIs have adjusted ratios
(top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.6 and 2.6, with an average of 2.1. At the HSA level, they
have adjusted ratios between 1.5 and 2.4, with an average of 2.0 and at the HRR level, of
between 1.2 and 1.5, with an average of 1.4. Finally, at the state level, IQIs have adjusted ratios
(top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.1 and 1.3, with an average of 1.2.
Consider IQI 15: Acute Myocardial Infarction Inpatient Mortality Rate. Before risk-adjust-
ment, we observed a 4.0 fold variation in AMI inpatient death rates between the top decile and
bottom decile of hospitals. After risk-adjustment for population, co-morbidity and health sys-
tem factors, we observed a 2.3 fold variation in AMI inpatient death rate between the top decile
and bottom decile of hospitals.
PSIs
At the hospital level, PSIs have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 2.2 and 61.3,
with an average of 13.2. At the HSA level, they have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of
between 1.8 and 32.6, with an average of 8.2 and at the HRR level, between 1.4 and 5.8, with an
average of 2.5. And lastly, at the state level, PSIs have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of
between 1.1 and 6.2, with an average of 2.2. Variation in health outcomes decreases as data is
aggregated to larger geographies. Among PSIs, Postoperative Hip Fracture rate had the lowest
amount of variation, and Pressure Ulcer Rate had the highest amount of variation.

for IQI 15 AMI inpatient mortality, we observe a 4.0-fold difference in outcomes between the top 10% and bottom 10% of hospitals. For IQIs and PSIs,
"observed" refers to values that were adjusted for low-volume noise using Bayesian shrinkage method but did not risk adjust for any other factors. For

 Similarly to IQIs, variation decreases after risk-adjustment. At the hospital level, PSIs have
adjusted ratios (top 10%/bottom10%) of between 1.8 and 46.9, with an average of 10.2. At the
HSA level, PSIs have adjusted ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.6 and 29.8, with an
average of 7.1. At the HRR level, PSIs have adjusted ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between
1.4 and 5.1, with an average of 2.3. At the state level, PSIs have adjusted ratios (top 10%/bottom
10%) of between 1.1 and 5.7, with an average of 2.0.
Consider PSI 07: Central Venous Catheter Bloodstream Infection. Before risk-adjustment,
we observed a 23.9 fold variation in CVC infection rates between the top decile and bottom
decile of hospitals. After risk-adjustment for population, co-morbidity and health system fac-
tors, we observed an 18.7 fold variation in CVC infection rates between the top decile and bot-
tom decile of hospitals.
PQIs
At the county level, PQIs have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between4.3 and 7.7,
with an average of 5.1. At the state level, PQIs have observed ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of
between 1.9 and 6.3, with an average of 2.8. Variation in health outcomes decreases as data is
aggregated to larger geographies. Among PQIs, Bacterial Pneumonia Admission Rate had the
lowest amount of variation, and Uncontrolled Diabetes Admission Rate had the highest
amount of variation.
Again, variation decreases after risk-adjustment. At the county level, PQIs have adjusted
ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 2.2 and 5.1, with an average of 3.0. At the state level,
PQIs have adjusted ratios (top 10%/bottom 10%) of between 1.2 and 2.8, with an average of
1.6. Counties do not naturally map to HSA and HRR. Therefore, PQIs were not aggregated to
HSA and HRR; PQIs were analyzed at the county and state level only.
Consider PQI 08: Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Admission Rate. Before risk-adjustment,
we observed a 4.3 fold variation in CHF admission rates between the top decile and bottom
decile of counties. After risk-adjustment for population, co-morbidity and health system fac-
tors, we observed a 2.2 fold variation in CHF admission rates between the top decile and bot-
tom decile of counties.
Correlations
We examined the correlation between risk-adjusted outcomes (Fig 6). To understand the
degree of correlation between outcomes, we analyzed cross correlations between each outcome
pair after full risk correction (including population factors, co-morbidities and system factors).
There exists little or no correlation between IQIs and PSIs at the hospital level. IQIs have an
average correlation coefficient of 0.17. PSIs have an average correlation coefficient 0.05, and
PQIs have an average correlation coefficient of 0.03. Additionally, there exists effectively no
correlation between IQIs, PSIs, and PQIs at the county level.
adjusted for co-morbidities. Lastly, "+ system adjusted" values are shrunk, population adjusted, co-morbidities adjusted, and system factors adjusted.
For IQI 15 AMI inpatient mortality, we observe a 2.3-fold difference in outcomes between the top 10% and bottom 10% of hospitals after risk-
adjustment for demographic, co-morbidities, and health system factors. Dash (-) indicates numbers that were not calculated. Counties were not

 Discussion
Extensive prior research has provided insight into geographic variation [14] in healthcare cost.
However, geographic variation in outcomes had not been quantified at a similar level of rigor
Fig 5. Fully risk-adjusted geographic distributions of select outcomes (IQI 15, PSI 07, PQI 08). Large variation in outcomes is present both
between and within US states. Substantially different performances highlight the variation in outcomes across the US. This variation is observed across
all outcomes plotted. (A) IQI 15 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Mortality Rate and PSI 07 Central Venous Catheter-Related Blood Stream Infection
Rate are adjusted for low-volume noise using a Bayesian shrinkage methodology and are adjusted for population, co-morbidities, and health system
factors. After risk-adjustment, there is 2.1-fold variation in IQI 15 between the top and bottom decile HSAs. After risk-adjustment, there is 12.6-fold
variation in PSI 07 between the top and bottom decile HSAs. (B) PQI 08 Heart Failure Admission Rate data has been adjusted for population, co-
morbidities, and health system factors. After risk-adjustment, there is 2.2-fold variation in PQI 08 between the top and bottom decile counties. Areas
shown in white are due to HCUP not making geographically identifiable data on hospital or county performance available.

 or granularity.[20,89] The timeliness of this question has been underscored by CMS recently
publishing an online tool that maps Medicare-only disparities in cost, prevalence and select
outcome measures such as readmission rates [90]. In our study, which covers the all-payer
population, we demonstrate that the magnitude of HSA and county level variability in US
health care outcomes is large and exceeds the variability observed in US health care costs. Spe-
cifically, a 1.7 to 32.6-fold difference between HSAs and counties in the 90th percentile and
those in the 10th percentile across 24 non-risk-adjusted AHRQ outcomes was observed. Each
outcome examined has larger variability than the 1.7-fold variability in health care costs
observed between the top and bottom decile HSAs [14].
As expected, variability decreases as outcomes are aggregated over larger geographies.
These results are consistent with prior research suggesting that analysis averaging across large
geographies masks the true extent of variation51. In short, a tremendous amount of variability
exists within the 27 states and within the 201 HRRs, which is only identified by examining the
1,295 HSAs. Studies conducted at the state level or HRR level are inadequate for characterizing
the extent of geographic variation in the quality of US health care delivery.
The population, co-morbidity, and health system factors accounted for a range of R2
between 18–64% of variability in mortality outcomes, 3–39% of variability in patient safety
outcomes, and 22–70% of variability in prevention outcomes. Significant amounts of variabil-
ity in outcomes can be accounted for by the population, co-morbidity, and health system
factors, but, as expected, meaningful variation in outcomes remains even after completing
risk-adjustment with 61 to 84 factors. The demographic and co-morbidity factors used are

measures are weakly correlated with each other. Inpatient safety measures show little to no correlation with each other. Prevention quality measures
show little to no correlation with each other. Correlation categorization after Dancey and Reidy (2004), analysis following low denominator number

 standardized and well developed. The health system factors used are externally observable and
publically available factors such as hospital size, length of stay, and case volume.
Through the comprehensive risk adjustment of this study, we find select US hospitals serv-
ing complex and disadvantaged patient populations that deliver outstanding risk-adjusted out-
comes. Conversely, we find select US hospitals serving relatively healthy and wealthy patients
that deliver lagging risk-adjusted outcomes. Still, the study demonstrates a significant residual
outcomes variation after risk-adjustment.
The existence of meaningful residual outcomes variation after risk-adjustment with publi-
cally available demographic, co-morbidity, and health system factors implies that other factors
impact outcomes. Said differently, there is meaningful outcomes variation when different hos-
pitals treat what appear to be similar acute myocardial infarction patients, or indeed when they
treat patients with any of the measured diagnoses. We hypothesize that the residual unex-
plained variability is likely to be driven by factors inside the hospitals (e.g., department specific
care protocols, culture, and experience of the clinical teams) which are not publically observ-
able. For example, recently published in-depth site visits and interviews of US hospitals in the
top and bottom 5% of risk-standardized AMI mortality found that performance results are
centered on a supportive organizational culture that encourages engagement in quality, strong
communication and coordination among groups; and the capacity for problem solving and
learning in the organization.[91] Culture, communication, and similar factors are not publi-
cally reported, but they likely account for a portion of the residual variation in our study.
Publicly available risk-adjusted outcomes data would enable patients, physicians, and pol-
icymakers to challenge past assumptions. Without outcomes data transparency, patients can-
not make informed decisions, hospitals may not know where to focus quality improvement
initiatives, and policy makers are stuck measuring adherence to process measures. Quantifying
the geographic variation in risk-adjusted US health outcomes is the first step toward improv-
ing outcomes for patients and enabling meaningful improvements in health care productivity.
This paper has several limitations. First, the analysis is limited to factors for which publically
reported data is currently available. Additional factors for which publically reported data is not
available are not accounted for in this analysis [92]. Potential factors accounting for outcomes
variation which are not captured in this study include: degree of health system integration,
physician skill, hospital care protocols, differences in clinical practice, culture, communication,
approach to behavioral health in provider treatment routines, and many others. Further
research that incorporates data from "within" the hospital is required in order to quantify
remaining drivers of residual outcome variability. Identifying the drivers of the variability, and
also understanding root causes of outcome variation, is critical to minimizing outcome vari-
ability and improving US health outcomes.
Second, while we used 16 robust data sources, none of the administrative datasets have the
clinical richness found in electronic medical records. Furthermore, the administrative data we
used is limited to the inpatient setting, such that we were not able to assess care delivered in
ambulatory settings, skilled nursing facilities, or other sites of care. Additionally, while HCUP
SID data provided the ability to examine an all-payer population, it is limited by inability to
track patients longitudinally. As such we are unable to identify if a patient had more than one
admission in a given year (although direct hospital-to-hospital transfers are excluded from this
study). The administrative data limitation affects the accuracy of the acute mortality, acute
safety, and prevention outcomes measures in different ways. For PSI inpatient safety, the
administrative nature of the dataset is particularly limiting, as it relies on subjective reporting
(and coding) of these complications. PSI data may suffer from reporting bias, as has been sug-
gested to exist for pressure ulcers.[93,94] For PQI prevention measures, administrative data
will have higher accuracy given that inpatient admissions rates are objectively observable.

 However, one can only measure failures of prevention when a patient appears in the hospital.
We are unable to assess failures of prevention where a sick patient is never admitted to the hos-
pital, such as a Congestive Heart Failure patient who dies at home. For IQI inpatient mortality,
we are highly confident in the accuracy of the outcomes, as death in the hospital is observable
and reliable. Still, in this study, a patient who is discharged to hospice or to die at home follow-
ing an acute hospitalization would be indistinguishable from one who returned home in full
health. Our confidence in the IQI outcomes data is further strengthened by observing a signifi-
cant inverse logarithmic relationship between inpatient mortality outcomes and hospital case
volume, similar to what has been previously observed in the literature [95–98]. (See Section A
in S2 File: Volume-outcome relationship and Fig 3). As case volume increases in a given hospi-
tal, the IQI mortality rate decreases. For example, consider acute myocardial infarction: for
hospitals with 50 or fewer AMI cases, the average inpatient mortality rate is 13%, while for hos-
pitals with more than 200 AMI cases it is 5% (p<0.001).
Third, our study is limited by the fundamental lack of geographic outcomes data transpar-
ency in the US. We examined the complete set of 2011 publically available SID and NIS data
through HCUP, but the available data covers only 50% of the United States population and
was limited to a single year. In 2011, not all states participated in SID, and only a subset of
states chose to disclose patient or hospital information down to the county level. To investigate
how representative data from a single year is, a supplemental longitudinal analysis of outcomes
using SID data from the State of New York over the 11-year period from 2002 to 2012 was per-
formed (See Section C in S2 File: Longitudinal Analysis and Figure G in S1 File). This analysis
demonstrated that hospital performance showed similar large levels of variation each year dur-
ing the 11-year period. When the State of New York data was aggregated over the entire
period, each individual hospital showed meaningful persistence in performance from year to
year. Therefore, despite these limitations, we believe that the data assembled is effective and
has led to several important conclusions.
Fourth, the study is limited by the reductions in HCUP data transparency which occurred
after 2011. Since 2011, changes in the design of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
(HCUP) database dramatically decreased the number of records where geographic identifica-
tion was possible, and the number of State Inpatient Databases (SID) that include geographic
data has been reduced significantly [99],[100]. Without access to comprehensive longitudinal
data sets, further research investigating the temporal trends of outcomes variation is impossi-
ble. While we found persistence in performance through a supplemental longitudinal analysis
(text C in S2 File), additional research using HCUP data in years past 2011 is not feasible due
to changes in the design of the database after 2011. HCUP/NIS/SID should increase geo-
graphic outcomes data transparency by reverting back to the 2011 disclosure level. Recent
changes which dramatically reduced the number of records where geographic identification
was possible are a step in the wrong direction.
Despite these limitations, this study sheds light on the magnitude of health care outcomes
variation across the United States and highlights the importance of increased outcomes data
transparency and further research on outcomes variation.
Conclusion
The amount of variability in health outcomes in the United States is large and exceeds that of
cost variability. This variability persists even after adjusting for differences in population, co-
morbidities, and health system factors. Population factors, co-morbidities, and health system
factors play a meaningful role in accounting for a portion of this variation; however, a large
amount of variation remains unaccounted for. The geographic variability in healthcare

 outcomes has implications for all health care stakeholders—patients, physicians, hospitals,
payers, policymakers, pharmaceutical companies, and medical technology companies. These
findings suggest that: 1) additional examination of regional and local variation in risk-adjusted
outcomes should be a priority; 2) assumptions of uniform hospital quality that underpin ratio-
nale for policy choices (such as narrow insurance networks or antitrust enforcement) should
be challenged; and 3) there exists substantial opportunity for outcomes improvement in the
US healthcare system.

S1 File. Figure A: Summary and definitions of the 24 AHRQ outcomes measures investigated.
Each IQI represents the number of hospital deaths per 1,000 hospital discharges with a specific
condition (e.g., Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)) as principal diagnosis for patients. PSIs
describe the rate of surgical complications (e.g., wound dehiscence) following applicable inter-
ventions. PQIs provide a ratio of the number of hospital admissions for a specific disease (e.g.,
Congestive Heart Failure) to the total number of eligible residents in a given county. Figure B:
Overview of data sources used. Summary of the 16 data sources used to assemble a database
of 64 population, co-morbidities, and systems factors for IQIs and PSIs, and a database of 81
population, co-morbidities, and systems factors for PQIs. 13 are government sources; 3 are
highly respected private sources65–67. The year of the data and the data assembled from each
data source is listed. All sources contain data for >95% of hospitals/counties investigated.

from 6 sources of potential factors, including population factors such as demographics, life-
style, and socioeconomics, as well as co-morbidities and health system factors (such as physi-
cian supply and hospital bed supply). Each factor was linked at the hospital level. Figure D:

potential factors investigated for PQIs. We assembled a database from 14 sources of potential
factors, including population factors such as demographics, lifestyle, and socioeconomics, as
well as co-morbidities and health system factors (such as physician supply and hospital bed
supply). Each factor was linked at the county level. Figure E: Comparison of outcomes vari-
ability, measured via D9/D1 ratio between risk adjustments conducted with a Gaussian
distribution and Poisson distribution. Fields marked in red indicate that the two results are
meaningfully (>25%) different. Figure F: Maps of geographic variation in the United States.
These maps show geographic variability in each of the 24 outcomes studied. All values on the
map are adjusted for low-volume noise using empirical Bayesian shrinkage method, however
they are not risk adjusted for population factors, co-morbidities and health system factors to
enable the reader to see the variation before the risk adjustment. Additionally, all HSAs with
only one hospital were merged with adjacent HSA so that the resulting region contains two
hospitals as required by HCUP’s data use agreement. Figure G: Persistence of hospital/
county performance over 11-years. All outcomes measures show a high degree of persistence.
Inpatient mortality has 69% persistence, inpatient safety has 67% persistence, and prevention
has 85% persistence. To calculate, inpatient mortality and inpatient safety measures were first
shrunk using Bayesian shrinkage. Then the variation each year was assessed by calculating Top
10%/bottom 10% ratio. Persistence in hospital performance was evaluated by ranking each
hospital every year into deciles, as well as ranking each hospital based on its 11-year cumulative
performance. Percent of time (years) in which a hospital was within two deciles of its 11-year
rank was defined as persistence.
