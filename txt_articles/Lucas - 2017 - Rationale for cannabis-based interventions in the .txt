Rationale for cannabis-based interventions
in the opioid overdose crisis
Philippe Lucas1,2,3
Abstract
Background: North America is currently in the grips of a crisis rooted in the use of licit and illicit opioid-based
analgesics. Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in Canada and the US, and the growing toll of
opioid-related morbidity and mortality requires a diversity of novel therapeutic and harm reduction-based
interventions. Research suggests that increasing adult access to both medical and recreational cannabis has
significant positive impacts on public health and safety as a result of substitution effect. Observational and
epidemiological studies have found that medical cannabis programs are associated with a reduction in the use of
opioids and associated morbidity and mortality.
Aims and Methods: This paper presents an evidence-based rationale for cannabis-based interventions in the
opioid overdose crisis informed by research on substitution effect, proposing three important windows of
opportunity for cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP) to play a role in reducing opioid use and interrupting the
cycle towards opioid use disorder: 1) prior to opioid introduction in the treatment of chronic pain; 2) as an opioid
reduction strategy for those patients already using opioids; and 3) as an adjunct therapy to methadone or
suboxone treatment in order to increase treatment success rates. The commentary explores potential
obstacles and limitations to these proposed interventions, and as well as strategies to monitor their impact
on public health and safety.
Conclusion: The growing body of research supporting the medical use of cannabis as an adjunct or
substitute for opioids creates an evidence-based rationale for governments, health care providers, and
academic researchers to consider the implementation and assessment of cannabis-based interventions in the
opioid crisis.

Background
North America is currently in the grips of a crisis rooted
in the use of licit and illicit opioid-based analgesics.
Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in
Canada and the US, with many of these deaths amongst
people affected by opioid use disorder. In 2015, there
were 52,404 drug overdose deaths in the US, including
33,091 (63.1%) overdose deaths related to opioids [1]. In
British Columbia, despite the declaration of a public
health emergency in 2016 and the scale-up of public
health-based efforts such as the opening of emergency
overdose prevention sites in many high-use jurisdictions,
use and overdose rates continue to rise. On April 26th
British Columbia reported 130 opioid-related overdoses
emergency calls in a single day,1 and in March 2017, 120
individuals died of drug overdoses.2 In light of the growing
toll of opioid-based morbidity and mortality, this crisis
requires a diversity of novel therapeutic and harm
reduction-based
interventions,
and
evidence
suggests
cannabis may have a role to play in reducing some of
these harms.
Substitution effect
Substitution effect is a theory originating from behav-
ioral economics that examines how the availability of
one good can impact and influence the use of other

 goods. In regards to substance use, Hursh et al. (2005)
suggest that “pharmacological therapies for the treat-
ment of drug abuse can also be conceptualized as alter-
native commodities that either substitute for illicit drug
use (e.g., agonist therapy) or reduce the potency of illicit
drugs directly (e.g., narcotic antagonist therapy)” [2].
Common examples of such harm reduction-focused sub-
stitution effect include the use of e-cigs or nicotine
patches as alternatives to cigarettes, or methadone/sub-
oxone treatment as an alternative to heroin. This paper
presents an evidence-based rationale for cannabis-based
interventions in the opioid overdose crisis informed by
research on substitution effect and the principles of harm
reduction.
There is a growing amount of evidence that increasing
adult access to both medical and recreational cannabis has
significant positive impacts on public health and safety,
largely as a result of substitution effect. Population-level
research describes how the introduction of regimes for
legal access to cannabis (e.g., medical and/or recreational)
in some US states has preceded reductions in homicides
and violent crime [3], suicides [4], and automobile-related
fatalities [5–7], all potentially related to subsequent
declines in alcohol use. Additionally, epidemiological
research has found that medical cannabis programs are
associated with a reduction in the use of opioids and asso-
ciated morbidity and mortality. Bachhuber et al. [8] report
that U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8%
lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate com-
pared to states without medical cannabis laws, and a 2016
study found that the number of Medicare prescriptions to
seniors in medical cannabis states dropped for drugs that
treat pain, depression, anxiety, nausea, psychoses, seizures
and sleep disorders [9]. For pain, the annual number of
annual doses prescribed per physician fell by 1826 doses.
More recently, a retrospective survey of Michigan patients
concluded that medical cannabis use was associated with
a 64% decrease in opioid use (n = 118), decreased side ef-
fects of medications, and an improved quality of life [10],
and a large survey of 2897 medical cannabis patients in
California found that 30% of the sample (n = 841) re-
ported using opioid-based pain medications, 97% of which
“strongly agreed/agreed” that they were able to decrease
their opioid use when using medical cannabis [11].
A 2015 cross sectional survey of patients in Canada’s
national medical cannabis system found that 63% of
respondents reported substituting cannabis for prescrip-
tion drugs (n = 166), with 32% of the pharmaceuticals
being substituted for being prescription opioids (n = 80).
The primary reasons cited by patients for this substitution
were “less adverse side effect” (39%, n = 68); “cannabis is
safer” (27%, n = 48), and “better symptom management”
(16%, n = 28) [12]. This evidence is consistent with infor-
mation from Veteran’s Affairs Canada (VAC) showing that
a recent significant increase in the use of medical cannabis
by Canadian veterans was paralleled by a reduction of
approximately 30% in the number of prescriptions for
benzodiazepines, and a 16% decrease in the use of
opioids [13].
Research suggests that there are multiple mechanisms
of action that may result in the substitution of cannabis
for opioids. In a study of cannabinoid-opioid interactions,
Abrams et al. (2011) note that cannabinoids and opioids
share many similar therapeutic and pharmacodynamics
properties, including analgesic effects; the potential to in-
duce hypothermia, sedation, and hypotension; as well as
inhibition of intestinal motility and locomotor activity
[14], adding that
“Synergy in analgesic effects between opioids and
cannabinoids has been demonstrated in animal
models. The antinociceptive effects of morphine are
mediated predominantly by mu opioid receptors but
may be enhanced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) activation of kappa and delta opiate
receptors [15]. It has further been suggested that
the cannabinoid–opioid interaction may occur at
the level of their signal transduction mechanisms
[16, 17]. Receptors for both classes of drugs are
coupled to similar intracellular signaling mechanisms
that lead to a decrease in cyclic adenosine monopho-
sphate production via G protein activation [17–19].
There is also some evidence that cannabinoids
increase the synthesis and/or release of endogenous
opioids.” (p. 844)
In light of the growing overdose crisis in North America,
these findings on cannabis substitution effect and the
biological mechanisms behind it strongly suggest that
cannabis could play a role in reducing the public health
impacts of prescription and non-prescription opioids.
However, interventions testing the harm reduction po-
tential of cannabis substitution effect have been lacking
thus far. The following framework describes how novel
cannabis-based interventions could minimize the per-
sonal and social harms associated with opioids.
Methods
A compelling amount of evidence suggests there may be
specific
windows
of
opportunity
for
cannabis
for
therapeutic purposes (CTP) to play a role in the opioid
use and dependence cycle. This commentary synthesizes
the growing amount of research on cannabis substitu-
tion effect into specific policy recommendations aimed
at improving public health and safety outcomes, with a
focus on the 3 primary opportunities for cannabis to
potentially reduce opioid use disorder and associated
morbidity and mortality: 1) prior to opioid introduction
Lucas Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:58 
Page 2 of 6
 in the treatment of chronic pain; 2) as an opioid reduc-
tion strategy for those already using opioids; and 3) as
an adjunct therapy to methadone or Suboxone treatment
in order to increase treatment success rates.
Introduction/initiation
The pathway to opioid use disorder typically begins with
the use of pharmaceutical opioids. Research suggests
that 4 out of 5 heroin users report their opioid use began
with prescription opioids [20]. If physicians and patients
have access to a safer, less addictive alternative for pain
control like cannabis [21], introducing it into the course
of care as a first line treatment could potentially prevent
the opioid overuse cycle from starting by not only
reducing the risk pain patients would have of developing
opioid use disorders, but also by reducing the overall
supply of pharmaceutical opioids on the black market.
Clinical research on cannabis as a treatment for pain
is extensive and suggests a relatively safe and effective
treatment option [14, 22–26], and there is significant
population-level evidence that cannabis substitution for
opioids in the treatment of chronic pain is already taking
place throughout North America. Chronic pain is the
most common indication reported by Canadian and US
patients
who
use
medical
cannabis
[10,
27],
and
epidemiological studies by Bachhuber et al. [8] and
Bradford and Bradford [9] strongly suggest that access
to medical cannabis through state-level programs in the
US reduces opioid use and related harms.
In light of this data, it would seem logical to seek to
develop policies and associated education strategies to
increase physician support for CTP in the treatment of
chronic
pain,
and
thereby
reduce
the
health
care
provider community’s dependence on opioids as first or
second line treatments options. However, while opioids
remain second line treatment options throughout North
America, clinical guidelines in Canada designate canna-
bis a third or fourth line treatment option for pain, and
in the US, federal prohibition on the medical use of can-
nabis means that in many states, this is not an available
treatment option under any circumstance.
It has become apparent that Canadian clinical guide-
lines and the US’s national prohibitionist policies are no
longer reflective of the most current evidence and best
available science on cannabis, opioids, and the treatment
of chronic pain, and may in fact be inadvertently con-
tributing to the growing rate of opioid use disorder. The
growing body of research on the impact of cannabis on
the use of other, potentially more dangerous substances
creates a strong rationale to review these policies
through a public health centered lens informed by the
ongoing and increasing detrimental impacts of the
current opioid crisis.
The argument in favor of recognizing medical canna-
bis as a first line option in the treatment of chronic pain
is informed by science, common sense, and simple
compassion: if patients never start using opioids, there is
no risk their use might progress to dependence or
overdose.
Reduction/substitution
For those patients that are already using opioids in their
course of care, the therapeutic imperative is to ensure
treatment success without a progression to dependence
and/or overuse. Evidence suggests that cannabis can be
a useful adjunct therapy in meeting these goals. Cannabis
augments the pain relieving potential of opioids [14], and
can re-potentiate their effects [28], thereby reducing the
need to increase the dosage of opioid pain medications.
As noted earlier, cross-sectional and population-level
research has shown that introducing cannabis into the
treatment of chronic pain may result in a reduction or
complete cessation of opioid use [11, 12, 29–33], thereby
significantly reducing the potential for dependence or
overdose. These findings suggest an opportunity to reduce
opioid use through the development of therapeutic guide-
lines to safely introduce medical cannabis as an adjunct
therapy for patients using opioids in the treatment of
chronic pain. The aim of this strategy would be to slowly
introduce cannabis into the continuum of care, while sub-
sequently reducing the dosage and frequency of prescrip-
tion opioid use.
However, here too there are some possible obstacles to
implementation. Many members of the health care com-
munity and their respective organizations have expressed
concerns about the use of medical cannabis, with much
of the focus centering on smoking as a mode of use, and
the impact of cannabis use on potentially vulnerable
populations.
In regards to concerns over smoking as a route of
administration, research suggests those
who smoke
cannabis regularly may be at increased risk of bronchial
issues, however no causal link between cannabis use and
lung or upper respiratory cancer has ever been estab-
lished [34]. Encouragingly, recent patient surveys have
found that alternatives to smoking such as vaporization
and edibles are increasingly popular amongst patient
and recreational populations [35, 36], and a 2015 survey
of Canadian medical cannabis patients found that over
50% of patients report non-smoked options as their
primary method of use [12]. Additionally, in Canada the
availability of high quality oil-based extracts (e.g., drops
and capsules) through the federal Access to Cannabis
for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) provides
patients and health care practitioners with legal, stan-
dardized alternatives to smoked ingestion. However, any
cannabis-based medical intervention should be coupled
Lucas Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:58 
Page 3 of 6
 with an educational campaign to discourage smoking
and inform patients and physicians of safer alternative
methods of use.
In regards to vulnerable populations, it’s certainly true
that due to circumstances or pre-existing medical condi-
tions, so individuals may not be well suited for cannabis-
based therapies. In particular, a recent systematic review
of medical cannabis and mental health suggests that
“CTP users with psychotic disorders, and those at in-
creased genetic risk of developing such disorders, should
be cautioned regarding the use of cannabis” [37].
However, the same review also noted that medical can-
nabis may be useful in the treatment of post-traumatic
stress disorder (often a co-morbidity with substance use
issues), and that its use is not associated with increased
violence. In fact, a 2014 study found that cannabis use
resulted in reductions in interpersonal violence amongst
married couples [38].
Other potentially vulnerable populations include youth
and women who may be pregnant, and as with many
currently
available
prescription
drugs
–
including
opioids - physicians should carefully weigh the potential
harms and benefits of cannabis treatment when treating
these populations.
Additionally, cannabis that is high in cannabidiol
(CBD) and low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may
reduce potential harms to vulnerable populations. CBD
is a relatively safe, non-impairing cannabinoid that has
been shown to have many therapeutic effects relevant to
the opioid crisis, including the reduction of heroin-
seeking behavior in mice [39], and positive effects on
mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, psych-
osis and bi-polar disorder [37, 40]. In other words, the
existence of vulnerable populations should not result in
abandoning or otherwise withholding this treatment
option from others who might benefit from CTP,
particularly in the treatment of chronic pain. It does
however highlight the need to target outreach and edu-
cation campaigns and specific treatment modalities
aimed at reducing potential cannabis-related harms to
these vulnerable populations.
Replacement/Cessation
When opioid use graduates to dependence, it is impera-
tive that users seeking opioid replacement therapy
(ORT) enjoy the best possible chance of success, and
some research has found that cannabis use can positively
impact treatment success rates. For example, intermit-
tent
cannabis
users
showed
superior
retention
in
naltrexone treatment compared to abstinent or consist-
ent users [41]. Additionally, objective ratings of opioid
withdrawal decreased in patients concurrently using can-
nabis during the early stages of methadone stabilization
[42], and CBD has been shown to reduce heroin seeking
behavior in mice [39].
Greater ORT success rates reduce the risk of those
with opioid use disorder suffering a relapse and subse-
quent fatal overdose, thereby diminishing the health care
and public safety cost burden for all members of society.
Since there is an exceedingly high risk of relapse and
overdose in this dependent population [42, 43] - particu-
larly with introduction of fentanyl and other powerful
opioids into the illicit drug market - systematic research-
based strategies to explore the potential of medical
cannabis to improve ORT success rates should be imple-
mented immediately. In order to address the need for
good longitudinal data on the impact of cannabis-based
medicines on methadone/Suboxone treatment, I have
worked with Dr. Peter Farago to develop a multi-site
cohort study that will compare the success rate of ORT
in 250 cannabis using patients vs. 250 non-cannabis
using controls. The study received ethics approval in
May 2017 and will launch summer/fall 2017.
Patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder
deserve the best possible chance of success. Since evidence
suggests that cannabis can help reduce opioid cravings and
subsequently improve treatment retention and compliance,
there is a strong rationale to immediately proceed with this
novel intervention and associated studies.
Implementation and assessment
It is notable that many of the favorable cannabis-related
public health outcomes cited in this commentary did
not come about as a result of a deliberate strategy to
substitute cannabis for opioids, but rather through unin-
tentional in situ changes in patient behavior resulting
from cannabis use. This strongly suggests that a more
purposeful and strategic approach to cannabis substitu-
tion for opioids may lead to even more encouraging
outcomes, and Canada may be particularly well posi-
tioned to implement these proposed interventions. With
a long-standing federally regulated medical cannabis
program that currently serves over 150,000 Canadians
with physician support for medical cannabis, and access
to quality-tested medical cannabis products labeled for
THC and CBD content, outreach and education to
health care practitioners touting the three opportunities
for cannabis-based interventions could be accomplished
very quickly, and could thereby have nearly immediate
impacts on opioid use.
Of interest in regards to the assessment and evaluation
of these public policy measures, a number of provinces
have centralized tracking of prescription drug dispensing,
so detailed real-time data on the use of prescription opioids
would be available to measure the population-level impacts
of these interventions. This data could be coupled with
well-designed epidemiological studies tracking overdose
Lucas Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:58 
Page 4 of 6
 rates through first responder calls and emergency room
data, as well as prospective observational cohort studies
comparing methadone/suboxone treatment success rates
in cannabis and non-cannabis using populations.
Observational and epidemiological research would not
replace the need for high quality clinical trials examining
the impact of cannabis on chronic pain, opioid use, and
quality of life. Well-designed clinical trials continue to
be necessary studies to determine the most effective
method of use (inhalation or oral ingestion), optimal
chemical composition (THC and CBD ratios and overall
potency), and associated dosage to most effectively im-
pact opioid use in all 3 of the proposed interventions.
However, the significant public health impact of the
current opioid crisis merits a rapid response strategy,
and Canada’s federal Access to Cannabis for Medical
Purposes Regulations and associated supply of cannabis
and cannabis-based medications would allow for rapid
implementation in a responsible and reflexive manner
informed by existing regional, provincial and national
pharmacovigilance and outcome assessment programs.
Conclusion
Bureaucratic, legal and ideological obstacles to these
interventions unquestionably exist in some jurisdictions.
However, t is encouraging to see acknowledgements of the
potential impacts of medical cannabis on opioid use from
traditionally conservative organizations like the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which recently acknowl-
edged the growing scientific support for substitution effect
on its website, noting that while “research into the effects
of cannabis on opioid use in pain patients is limited…data
suggest that medical cannabis treatment may reduce the
dose of opioids required for pain relief”.3
Cannabis alone will not end opioid use disorder and
associated morbidities and mortality. However, the intro-
duction of ever more powerful opioids like fentanyl and
carfentanyl into the illicit drug market and the resulting
day-to-day increase in opioid overdoses highlights the
immediate need for innovative short and long term
intervention strategies to add to current efforts like
ORT, heroin maintenance programs, supervised con-
sumption sites, the depenalization of substance use, and
increased education and outreach on the potential harms
associated with both prescription and illicit opioid use.
The growing body of research supporting the medical
use of cannabis as an adjunct or substitute for opioids
creates an evidence-based rationale for governments,
health care providers, and academic researchers to seek
the immediate implementation of cannabis-based inter-
ventions in the opioid crisis at the regional and national
level, and to subsequently assess their potential impacts
on public health and safety.
