IMPORTANCE The ability of present-day etiologic stroke classification systems to generate
subtypes with discrete stroke characteristics is not known.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that etiologic stroke subtyping identifies different disease
processes that can be recognized through their different clinical courses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a head-to-head evaluation of the ability
of the Causative Classification of Stroke (CCS), Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment
(TOAST), and ASCO (A for atherosclerosis, S for small-vessel disease, C for cardiac source, and
O for other cause) classification systems to generate etiologic subtypes with different clinical,
imaging, and prognostic characteristics in 1816 patients with ischemic stroke. This study
included 2 cohorts recruited at separate periods; the first cohort was recruited between April
2003 and June 2006 and the second between June 2009 and December 2011. Data analysis
was performed between June 2014 and May 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Separate teams of stroke-trained neurologists performed
CCS, TOAST, and ASCO classifications based on information available at the time of hospital
discharge. We assessed the association between etiologic subtypes and stroke characteristics
by computing receiver operating characteristic curves for binary variables (90-day stroke
recurrence and 90-day mortality) and by calculating the ratio of between-category to
within-category variability from the analysis of variance for continuous variables (admission
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and acute infarct volume).
RESULTS Among the 1816 patients included, the median age was 70 years (interquartile
range, 58-80 years) (830 women [46%]). The classification systems differed in their ability
to assign stroke etiologies into known subtypes; the size of the undetermined category was
33% by CCS, 53% by TOAST, and 42% by ASCO (P < .001 for all binary comparisons). All
systems provided significant discrimination for the validation variables tested. For the
primary validation variable (90-day recurrence), the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.66-0.75) for CCS, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.56-0.67) for
TOAST, and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.71) for ASCO (P = .01 for CCS vs ASCO; P < .001 for CCS vs
TOAST; P = .13 for ASCO vs TOAST). The classification systems exhibited similar discrimination
for 90-day mortality. For admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and acute
infarct volume, CCS generated more distinct subtypes with higher between-category to
within-category variability than TOAST and ASCO.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings suggest that the major etiologic stroke subtypes
are distinct categories with different stroke characteristics irrespective of the classification
system used to identify them. We further show that CCS generates discrete etiologic
categories with more diverse clinical, imaging, and prognostic characteristics than either
TOAST or ASCO.

T
hequalityofetiologicclassificationdependsontheabil-
ity to generate homogenous subtypes with discrete out-
comes (discriminative validity), the clarity of classifi-
cation rules to ensure utility at different settings by different
investigators (reliability), and the capacity to segregate etiolo-
gies into known subtypes rather than grouping them into a
heterogeneous “undetermined” category.1 The cost of diag-
nostic investigations to identify the underlying etiology is es-
timated to be $7.7 billion annually in the United States.2,3 De-
spite this high cost to the public, little is known about the
validity of etiologic subtype information. Previous studies of
stroke classification have primarily focused on reliability.4-10
Published reports on validity are limited by small sample
sizes, variable definitions for subtypes and outcome events,
and the use of outdated classification and diagnostic evalua-
tion algorithms.11-13 In the present study, we sought to deter-
mine the predictive or discriminative validity of etiologic clas-
sification by assessing the capacity of 3 novel classification
systems—the automated Causative Classification of Stroke
(CCS) system,5 the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treat-
ment (TOAST) algorithm,6 and ASCO (A for atherosclerosis,
S for small-vessel disease, C for cardiac source, and O for other
cause) system14,15—to unequivocally generate subtypes with
distinct stroke features in a cohort of patients with acute is-
chemic stroke who underwent comprehensive diagnostic
evaluation.
Methods
Study Population and Data Collection
Thestudypopulationconsistedof2separatecohortswithmag-
netic resonance imaging–confirmed ischemic stroke admit-
ted to Massachusetts General Hospital during different peri-
ods. Cohort 1 was recruited between April 2003 and June 2006
as a part of an institutional registry project.16 Cohort 2 was re-
cruitedbetweenJune2009andDecember2011withinthecon-
text of a National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded study
(Heart Brain Interactions in Human Acute Ischemic Stroke
Study).17 Both cohorts were consecutive and excluded those
who were admitted after 72 hours of symptom onset. We col-
lected pertinent clinical, imaging, and laboratory data in each
patient through the review of electronic medical records at the
time of hospital discharge (or in-hospital death) using a stan-
dard data collection manual. We generated a stroke classifi-
cation form that included demographic characteristics, pre-
senting symptoms and clinical stroke features, stroke risk
factors, and diagnostic test findings. These forms were later
used by adjudicators to determine etiologic stroke subtypes.
DataanalysiswasperformedbetweenJune2014andMay2016.
The study was approved by the Partners Institutional Review
Board; written or oral consent was obtained from patients.
Etiologic Classification
We identified etiologic stroke subtypes using CCS, TOAST, and
ASCO systems. The CCS system is a web-based, semiauto-
mated, probabilistic decision-support algorithm that inte-
grates clinical, imaging, and laboratory information from the
stroke workup using evidence-based criteria and identifies the
most likely causative etiology.5 The TOAST system provides
causative etiologic subtypes based on clinical impression and
diagnostic test findings.6 The ASCO system is a phenotypic al-
gorithm that assigns stroke subtypes into nonmutually exclu-
sive categories without weighting toward the most likely cause
in the presence of multiple competing etiologies.14,15 All clas-
sification methods stratify stroke subtypes into the same 5 ma-
jor categories: large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) causing 50%
or more stenosis, cardiac embolism (CE), small-artery occlu-
sion (SAO), uncommon causes, and undetermined causes. To
compare phenotypic ASCO and causative CCS and TOAST, we
converted ASCO from phenotypic to causative as previously
described.18 Here, we considered only grade 1 evidence when
determiningASCOsubtypes.Tofurtherensureconsistencybe-
tween ASCO grade 1 and the other 2 systems, we reassigned
low- or uncertain-risk cardiac sources into the undetermined
category in CSS and TOAST.14
Separate teams of stroke-trained neurologists performed
subtype classifications for each classification system. As a part
of the training process, the senior author (H.A.) reassessed the
initial 20 cases classified by each adjudicator and provided
feedback. Adjudicators performed subtype determinations
using clinical and diagnostic information available at the time
ofdischargethroughinspectionofthestrokeclassificationform
for each case. Subtype adjudicators remained blinded to each
other’
s subtype assignments and validation end points for the
duration of the study. The CCS algorithm was developed at the
Massachusetts General Hospital. None of the adjudicators who
performed CCS classifications were involved in its design or
development.
Validation End Point Assessment
Because there is no ground truth in etiologic classification
against which the accuracy of classifications can be tested, we
assessed validity by studying the ability of etiologic subtypes
to discriminate between important stroke characteristics. Our
Key Points
Question Can etiologic stroke subtyping generate categories with
discrete clinical, imaging, and prognostic characteristics?
Findings A head-to-head, blind evaluation of Causative
Classification of Stroke, Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke
Treatment, and ASCO (A for atherosclerosis, S for small-vessel
disease, C for cardiac source, and O for other cause) classification
systems in 1816 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke
revealed that all systems generated etiologic subtypes with
different 90-day stroke recurrence, 90-day survival, admission
stroke severity, and acute infarct burden. The Causative
Classification of Stroke system redistributed 20% to 40% of the
population assigned into the undetermined category by other
systems into known subtypes and provided a greater
discrimination for most of the stroke characteristics tested as
compared with the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment
and ASCO systems.
Meaning Etiologic stroke classification identifies discrete
categories with different stroke features.

objective was to determine whether etiologic classification
could serve its purpose: ie, whether the classification sys-
tems could characterize and capture clinical characteristics of
interest in relation to different etiologic subtypes. This ap-
proach is an established method used to determine the pre-
dictiveordiscriminativevalidityofdiagnosticinstrumentsand
isfrequentlyusedinsocialsciencesandinmedicinewhenthere
is no unequivocal reference standard (such as for diagnosis of
psychiatric disorders).19 The primary goal of diagnostic stroke
evaluation is to identify the underlying etiology so that tar-
geted treatments to prevent a second stroke can be insti-
tuted. For this reason, we chose 90-day stroke recurrence as
the primary validation end point for quality assessment. We
used 90 days as a cutoff because approximately half of the re-
current strokes observed over the course of a year occur within
the first 90 days.20,21 Other validation end points were 90-
day survival, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS) score, and admission infarct volume. These fea-
tures are frequently used for patient selection and prognosti-
cation in clinical stroke research and, hence, are relevant for
validity assessment.
Follow-up evaluation included assessment of survival and
recurrentstrokestatusat90days,witharangeof75to105days.
One investigator blinded to the etiologic subtype results per-
formedoutcomeassessmentsthroughin-personevaluationsand
through telephone interviews or through reviews of physician
notesobtainedduringoutpatientvisitswhenthepatientwasun-
available for a follow-up visit. Physician notes provided in-
depthdescriptionsofthetiming,clinicalfeatures,anddiagnos-
tic evaluation findings of the recurrent stroke. In addition, we
usedtheSocialSecurityDeathIndextoconfirmthesurvivalsta-
tus at 90 days. We defined recurrent stroke as a clinical inci-
dent that was clearly attributable to a new area of brain infarct,
which could be observed with imaging as a lesion spatially dis-
tinctfromtheindexinfarct.16Twoinvestigators(J.H.andM.H.S.)
blinded to etiologic subtype information calculated index in-
farct volume by manually outlining acute infarcts on diffusion-
weightedimagesacquiredatthetimeofhospitaladmissionusing
semiautomated software (MRIcro software, University of Not-
tingham, Nottingham, England).
Diagnostic Investigations and Preventive Treatments
All patients underwent a thorough diagnostic evaluation to
identify the underlying etiology. The standard investigation
battery included brain imaging (computed tomography and/or
magneticresonanceimaging),extracranialandintracranialvas-
cular imaging, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echo-
cardiography.Specificbloodandcerebrospinalfluidtests,trans-
oesophageal echocardiography, and long-term cardiac rhythm
monitoringwereperformedwhentherewasnosourceonother
investigations or when the patient was younger than 55 years
old. All patients received preventive treatment as recom-
mended by the secondary stroke prevention guidelines.22
These included risk factor modification and control, antico-
agulant therapy for major cardiac sources, carotid revascular-
ization and antiplatelet treatment for LAA, antiplatelet treat-
ment for minor cardiac sources, cryptogenic stroke, SAO, and
disease-specific treatment for uncommon causes of stroke.
Statistical Analysis
We assessed the relationship between etiologic categories and
baseline clinical and imaging variables using the Kruskal-
Wallis test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test
or the χ2 test for categorical variables. We used the χ2 test to
compare the size of etiologic categories by CCS and TOAST. We
calculatedagreementbetweenclassificationalgorithmsinetio-
logic subtype assignments using unweighted κ statistics.23
We constructed the Cox proportional hazard regression
models that included time to outcome as response and etio-
logic subtypes as independent variables. We determined the
cumulativeriskofbinaryendpointsusingKaplan-Meieranaly-
sis. We used the log-rank test to examine the relationship be-
tween etiologic subtypes and cumulative outcome rates. We
furtherconstructedmultivariableCoxregressionmodelstoex-
amine the relationship between etiologic subtypes and pri-
mary outcome adjusting for baseline covariates with a uni-
variate P < .05. We computed receiver operating characteristic
curves and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) to as-
sess the discriminative ability of etiologic subtypes for binary
end points. We compared the AUC values for each algorithm
using the z test.24
Forcontinuousvalidationvariables(admissionNIHSSscore
and acute infarct volume), we used the between-category F
statistictodetermineeachalgorithm’
scapacitytogeneratesub-
types with discrete features. The better classifier had a higher
ratio of between-category to within-category variability, and
hence a larger F statistic.25 Numerical variables were ex-
pressed as median (interquartile range) or mean (95% CI).
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 16 (IBM).
Results
The study included a total of 2284 patients with acute ische-
mic stroke. We excluded 468 patients (20%) who were not
available for follow-up owing to relocation or refusal to par-
ticipate. There was no difference in patient characteristics be-
tween cohorts with and without follow-up assessment (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Of the remaining 1816 patients, 998 were
in cohort 1 and 818 in cohort 2. The study cohorts were simi-
lar with the exception that a greater percentage of the pa-
tients received statin treatment while fewer patients re-
ceived anticoagulant therapy and underwent carotid
revascularization in cohort 2 (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Baseline characteristics of the study cohort are presented
in Table 1. Classification systems differed in their ability to as-
sign stroke etiologies into known subtypes, as opposed to the
undeterminedcategory(Table2);thesizeofundeterminedcat-
egory was 33% by CCS, 53% by TOAST, and 42% by ASCO
(P < .001 for CCS vs TOAST, CCS vs ASCO, and ASCO vs TOAST).
The CCS-undetermined category was comprised of 9% cryp-
togenic,21%minorCE,1%incompleteevaluation,and2%mul-
tiple competing etiologies. The corresponding proportions for
TOAST-undetermined categories were 11%, 19%, 1%, and 22%,
respectively. The undetermined category in ASCO consisted
of 37% cryptogenic and 5% multiple competing etiologies. The

thesubtypesbetweentheclassificationsystems(Table3).Atime
epoch analysis showed that the cumulative recurrence rate did
notdifferbetweencohort1andcohort2(6.6%vs5.3%;P = .29).
Classification systems exhibited similar discrimination for 90-
day recurrence when tested separately in cohort 1 and cohort 2
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). The relationship between etio-
logic subtypes and 90-day stroke recurrence did not change af-
ter adjusting for variables with a univariate P < .05 (hyperten-
sionandadmissionNIHSSscore).Addingthetypeofpreventive

A total of 290 patients died during the study period. The
cumulative 90-day mortality rate was 16.1% (95% CI, 14.3%-
17.9%). Survival varied by etiologic subtypes (log-rank test;
P < .001 for all systems; Figure 1 and Table 3). All 3 classifica-
tion systems provided similar discrimination for 90-day mor-
tality; there was no difference in AUCs among CCS, TOAST, and
ASCO(Figure2B).AdmissionNIHSSscoreandacuteinfarctvol-
ume also differed by etiologic stroke subtypes (Table 3). The
analysis of variance demonstrated that CCS generated more
discreteandhomogenoussubtypesthanTOASTandASCO;the
F values were 39.78 for CCS, 34.99 for TOAST, and 33.21 for
ASCO for NIHSS score and 11.21 for CCS, 8.84 for TOAST, and
9.07 for ASCO for infarct volume.
Discussion
This study assessed the validity of etiologic stroke classifica-
tion by examining the strength of association between etio-
logic stroke subtypes and important stroke characteristics in
aconsecutiveseriesofpatientswhounderwentathoroughand
standard diagnostic assessment for stroke etiology. The ma-
jor finding of this study is that 90-day stroke recurrence, 90-
day survival, admission stroke severity, and admission in-
farct volume differ by etiologic stroke subtypes regardless of

that developed secondary to cardiac embolism were associ-

currence comparable with that of strokes caused by LAA. The
high risk in the uncommon-causes category was largely driven
by acute nonatherosclerotic arteriopathies such as arterial dis-
section, active vasculitis, and iatrogenic factors. Overall, the
ability of current classification algorithms to generate dis-
tinct subtypes with discrete features supports the predictive
validityofetiologicsubtypeinformation.Wenotethatourfind-
ings may underestimate the true association between etio-
logic subtypes and stroke characteristics because we tested the
validity in a treated population where the type of preventive
treatment used was based on presumed stroke etiology. Pre-
ventive treatments for high-risk etiologies (LAA and CE) gen-
erally offer larger absolute risk reductions than those for low-
risk etiologies (SAO and cryptogenic), resulting in reduced
variability in subtype-specific risk for recurrence.22 Hence, the
reported associations should be expected to be greater when
tested in untreated or poorly treated populations.
The quality of a classification algorithm can be assessed by
the degree to which it stratifies stroke etiologies into categories
with discrete clinical, radiographic, and prognostic categories.
All of the classification systems tested in this study accom-
plished this goal but they did so to different degrees. The CCS
systemexhibitedastrongerdiscriminationfortheprimaryvali-
dation end point: 90-day stroke recurrence. Although CCS,
TOAST, and ASCO stratify stroke etiologies into the same 5 sub-
types, they use different classification criteria to do this. The
TOAST and ASCO systems largely rely on the presence or ab-
sence of an abnormality and categorize etiologic findings with-
out weighting toward the most likely etiology in the presence
of multiple competing etiologies.6,14 In contrast, CCS identifies
thecausativesubtypebytakingintoaccountclinicalandimaging
stroke features that convey causal information.5 The results of
this study demonstrate that consideration of the causal evi-
denceinidentifyingtheetiologicsubtypeofstrokeenhancesthe
validity of stroke classification. A recent report from the Na-
tionalInstituteofNeurologicalDisordersandStroke–StrokeGe-
netics Network further supports the validity of the CCS
approach.26 In that study, investigators identified 2 novel loci:
oneassociatedwithLAAandtheotherassociatedwithSAO.That
discovery was made possible by using the CCS, as none of the
associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached signifi-
cance when using TOAST subtyping in the discovery data set.
Strengths and Limitations
Thepresentstudyhadseveralstrengths.Weperformedahead-
to-head comparison of widely used classification algorithms
in a consecutive cohort by using a standard manual for data
collection based on detailed diagnostic investigations, and by
ensuring blind adjudication of stroke subtypes and valida-
tion variables.
Our study had certain limitations as well. Twenty per-
cent of the study population was excluded because 90-day
follow-up information was unavailable. However, it is
unlikely that this caused a selection bias because baseline
patient characteristics and stroke features were similar
between populations with and without 90-day follow-up
data. We studied a well-investigated cohort that received a
targeted preventive treatment for the underlying etiology as
recommended by the guidelines. Caution should be
observed when generalizing the results of the present study
to settings where practice deviates considerably from the
guideline recommendations. In the present study, subtype
adjudicators used abstracted data collected using a manual
that provided documentation of clinical findings and diag-
nostic test results in a standard manner. This minimized
ambiguities and inconsistencies in the source data and,
hence, led to high agreement rates between the classifica-
tion systems. High agreement might have reduced the dif-
ferences in discrimination for stroke characteristics and out-
comes by the classification systems. The TOAST and ASCO
systems require classification of multiple competing etiolo-
gies into the undetermined category. Deviating from the
published rules by assigning multiple competing etiologies
into known subtypes based on an expert opinion could
result in lower agreement rates between CCS and the other
systems because personal opinion differs from one physi-
cian to another.7-9 Overall, we expect that the validity
advantage of CCS over TOAST and ASCO would be more
obvious in settings where the disagreement rates between
the classification systems are higher than reported in the
present study.27
Conclusions
Our findings have both clinical and research implications. The
prognostic information conveyed by etiologic subtypes dis-
closed in this study underscores the importance of carefully
identifying and properly classifying the underlying etiology
in every patient with stroke. Valid and reliable etiologic sub-
type information can be used for patient selection into clini-
cal trials, phenotyping in genetic and epidemiological stud-
ies, selection of preventive treatment, and assessment of
treatment response and prognosis. The ability to generate ho-
mogenous subtypes with distinct features could enhance sta-
tistical power in future trials of preventive treatments. This,
in turn, could reduce study costs, save time, and, more im-
portantly, increase the chances for discovery. Overall, our find-
ings contribute to the understanding of clinical and research
significance of etiologic subtype information.
