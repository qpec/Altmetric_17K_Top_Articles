Abstract: The transition to nutritional independence makes new college students vulnerable to
alterations in eating patterns, which can increase the risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The aim
of the study was to examine the potential benefits of almond vs. cracker snacking in improving
glucoregulatory and cardiometabolic profiles in new college students. A randomized controlled,
parallel-arm, 8-week intervention of 73 college students (BMI: 18–41 kg/m2) with no cardiometabolic
disorders was conducted.
Participants were randomized into either an almond snack group
(56.7 g/day; 364 kcal; n = 38) or Graham cracker control group (77.5 g/day; 338 kcal/d; n =
35). Chronic, static changes were assessed from fasting serum/plasma samples at baseline, and
after 4 and 8 weeks. Acute, dynamic effects were assessed during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) at 8 weeks. Almond snacking resulted in a smaller decline in HDL cholesterol over 8 weeks
(13.5% vs. 24.5%, p < 0.05), 13% lower 2-h glucose area under the curve (AUC), 34% lower insulin
resistance index (IRI) and 82% higher Matsuda index (p < 0.05) during the OGTT, despite similar
body mass gains over 8 weeks compared with the cracker group. In general, both almond and cracker
snacking reduced fasting glucose, and LDL cholesterol. Conclusions: Incorporating a morning snack
in the dietary regimen of predominantly breakfast-skipping, first-year college students had some
beneficial effects on glucoregulatory and cardiometabolic health. Almond consumption has the
potential to benefit postprandial glucoregulation in this cohort. These responses may be influenced
by cardiometabolic risk factor status.

1. Introduction
The benefits of nut consumption in ameliorating cardiovascular disease [1] and reducing the
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [2] in adults are well established. A meta-analysis found an
inverse association between nut consumption and diabetes prevalence, which became non-significant
after adjusting for BMI [1] suggesting that the effects of nut consumption on diabetes prevalence are
largely mediated by changes in body mass (adiposity). Almond studies demonstrating improvements
in glycemic control in T2DM [3,4], impaired glucose-tolerant (IGT) [5] individuals, and in healthy
adults [6], have mostly been performed in middle-aged to older adults (median age >40 years).
Despite increasing incidence of metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance) at younger
ages [7,8], no evidence exists on the potential benefits of almond consumption in ameliorating metabolic

disorders at earlier life stages (e.g., adolescence, young adulthood). Studying young adults, especially
those starting college, is clinically relevant because of the potential risk factors derived from changes
in eating behavior occurring during the transition from adolescence to adulthood [9,10].
The transition to dietary independence makes new college students vulnerable to unfavorable
alterations in eating patterns [11]. For instance, a relatively high number of college freshman report
skipping breakfast (20–43%); by far the most skipped meal in this group [9,12–14]. In turn, persistently
skipping breakfast has detrimental outcomes on cardiometabolic health [15] and academic performance
in adolescents [16]. It is known that most college students snack [12] both, in the morning and/or
the afternoon [14]. However, although well documented in adults [1,3,5,17], the effects of almond
snacking in young college students who routinely skip breakfast are unknown and could have
significant implications for diet-related health outcomes in this group. Dietary practices acquired at
this developmentally crucial life stage can persist through adulthood, affecting future health outcomes.
Several studies have found the transition to college life to be associated with a modest increase in
body mass (BM) of 1–3 kg (2.2–6.6 lb) [18,19]. Other studies have reported high BM gain and prevalence
of metabolic syndrome in young adults aged 18–24 years, suggesting that experiences occurring during
these years (e.g., transition to college) may affect health behaviors in favor of increased BM and
metabolic disorders [20]. While almond-supplemented diets have been shown to reduce BM or
ameliorate gain [21,22], the evidence of such effects in young adults transitioning to college is scarce
and an untapped area of research.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 8 weeks of almond snacking on
glucoregulatory and cardiometabolic profiles compared to a snack of Graham crackers in college
first years. We employed a study design that included both chronic, static measurements at 4-week
intervals (to capture mid-point changes) and acute, dynamic analyses in response to an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) after 8 weeks of intervention. We hypothesized that consumption of almonds for
8 weeks improves lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and associated hormone profiles
in college first years independently of changes in body mass or adiposity.
2. Materials and Methods
This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03084003). All procedures
involving human subjects were approved by the University of California (UC) Merced Institutional
Review Board.
2.1. Participants
One hundred and twenty-four college first years from UC Merced underwent screening to
determine eligibility for participation in the study. Eighty participants were enrolled to participate in
the study. Seven participants withdrew prior to study start. Seventy-three (41 women and 32 men)
participants (18–19 years old, BMI: 18–41 kg/m2) completed the study. Participants were recruited via
public advertisements. Informed consent was obtained from participants who met eligibility criteria
prior to commencement of study visits. Inclusion criteria included the following: (a) 18–21 years of age,
(b) newly enrolled, 1st-year college students, (c) no nut allergies, (d) willingness to consume almonds
or Graham crackers, (e) willingness to maintain consistent diet and activity patterns, (f) not taking
medications known to influence metabolism and appetite, and (g) non-smoker over the previous
year. Exclusion criteria included diagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension,
cardiovascular disease or dyslipidemia requiring drug therapy.
Obesity was not an exclusion
criterion if participants were not on or did not require medications for cardiometabolic disorders.
Participants were categorized by BMI and metabolic syndrome risk factors which were assigned
according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) consensus definition of metabolic syndrome
in adolescents [23]. Metabolic syndrome in this cohort was categorized by the presence of central
obesity i.e., waist circumference ≥94 cm (Europid males) and ≥80 cm (Europid females)/ethnicity
specific values for other groups and two of the following four factors: triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL,
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 960
3 of 19
HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL (males) and <50 mg/dL (females), fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL,
and systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg [23].
2.2. Study Protocol
The study was an 8-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm intervention. Participants were
assigned into one of two study arms: almond snack group (n = 40) or control, Graham cracker snack
group (n = 40) via simple randomization. A blinded researcher used a sequence of computer-generated
random numbers to assign participants to group 1 i.e., cracker group or group 2 i.e., almond group.
Participants were enrolled to start the study in 2 groups staggered a week apart. Assignments to
these groups was random (and not determined by snack group assignments). Participants in the
almond group consumed 56.7 g/day (2 oz; 364 kcal; 14% carbohydrate (8 g fiber), 74% fat, 13% protein,
Table S1) of dry-roasted almonds and were asked to avoid consumption of other nuts and seeds. The
almonds were dry-roasted at 129.4 ◦C for about 50 min to enhance palatability. Participants in the
cracker group consumed 5 sheets (77.5 g/day) of Graham crackers (338 kcal; 74% carbohydrate (2.5
g fiber), 20% fat, 6% protein, Table S1) and were asked to avoid all nuts, seeds, and nut-containing
products during the intervention period. The control snack of Graham crackers was selected based on
focus groups that were conducted with a subset of participants to determine habitual snack food and
intake patterns.
Weekly energy and nutrient intake data was collected using a validated, automated,
and self-administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24) [24]. Participants met with a registered
dietitian to receive training on the ASA24 tool; no dietary counseling was provided to either
group. Participants met with researchers every day before 12 pm over the study duration (with
the exception of weekends and 5-day spring break) to collect and consume their study snacks.
Peer-researchers witnessed and recorded participants’ consumption of assigned snack to confirm
compliance. Breakfast consumption for the day and sleep duration the previous night was also
recorded. Participant compliance over the weekend and spring break was monitored via text messages.
Physical activity was tracked every 4 weeks for 2 days: one weekday and one weekend day, using an
advanced version of a previously validated triaxial accelerometer (RT6, Stayhealthy Inc., Monrovia,
CA, USA) [25].
2.3. Study Outcomes
The primary outcomes were glucoregulatory profiles (glucose and insulin) at the end of the 8-week
intervention. Secondary outcomes were lipid profile, body mass, body composition, waist circumference,
plasma leptin, serum glucagon, serum adiponectin, resting blood pressure, endothelial function, and 24-h
free-living appetite. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks into the intervention except
for the OGTT and endothelial function, which were only assessed at week 8.
The sample size calculations for this analysis were based on change in fasting homeostasis model
assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) over time estimated from the change in fasting glucose and
fasting insulin concentrations of the control and almond (morning snack) groups of the Tan et al. [17]
study. Thirty-five participants were required per snack group to detect 20% change over time from the
control with an alpha of 0.05, standard deviation (SD) of 1 and 80% power. The estimated minimum
sample size was increased to 40 per group to account for potential dropouts.
2.3.1. Anthropometric Measures
Body mass (kg) and body composition were measured using a calibrated bio-electrical impedance
analysis scale (Model BC-418, Tanita Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA) with participants wearing
minimal light-weight clothing. Height (m) was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer. BM and
height were used to calculate BMI. Waist circumference was measured using a measuring tape placed
at the narrowest part of the torso.

2.3.2. Cardiovascular Measures
Resting blood pressure was assessed using an automated digital blood pressure monitor (Model
HEM 780, Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Participants rested for 5 min prior to blood pressure
measurement. Two readings were taken, and the mean was calculated to determine resting blood
pressure. Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI), a measure of endothelial function, and augmentation
index (AI), a measure of arterial stiffness, were assessed using an Endopat device (Itamar Medical Ltd.,
Caesarea, Israel).
2.3.3. Biochemical Analyses
Blood samples were collected following an overnight fast of 8–10 h by venipuncture. Blood was
collected in chilled spray-coated silica and a polymer gel (BD Vacutainer® SST, 8.5 mL) tubes for serum
separation and chilled spray-coated lithium heparin and gel (BD Vacutainer® K2EDTA, 6 mL) tubes
for plasma separation. Blood samples were immediately separated by centrifuging at 1300–1500 RCF
for 10 min at 4 ◦C. Serum and plasma samples were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 ◦C
until analysis. Consistent assay protocols were used for biochemical measurements over the study
period. Serum samples were analyzed for glucose and lipids using the Olympus AU400 (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) analyzer, and for serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) (Wako diagnostics HR Series
NEFA-HR(2)), insulin (Millipore Human Insulin ELISA EZHI-14K), C-peptide (Mercodia C-peptide
ELISA 10-1136-01), glucagon (Mercodia Glucagon ELISA 10-1271-01), GLP-1 (GLP-1 Total ELISA
EZGLP1T-36K) and adiponectin (Millipore Human Adiponectin EZHADP-61K). Plasma samples
were analyzed for leptin (Millipore Human Leptin EZHL-80SK). Leptin, GLP-1 and adiponectin
were measured to assess biochemical markers of energy balance, appetite and insulin action [26–28].
C-peptide during the OGTTs was measured to confirm the secretory capacity of the pancreatic β-cells
as C-peptide and insulin are secreted in nearly equi-molar amounts [29]. We anticipated that similar
patterns between insulin and C-peptide in response to the OGTT would be indicative of β-cell reactivity
and less so of systemic insulin metabolism. Results for NEFAs, adiponectin, leptin and glucagon are
presented in supplementary material (Figures S1 and S2).
Insulin resistance, secretion, and sensitivity indices were calculated as follows: HOMA-IR ((fasting
glucose × fasting insulin)/405) [30], HOMA-β ((360 × fasting insulin)/(fasting glucose-63)) [30] and
quantitative insulin sensitivity check (QUICKI) (1/(log10 (fasting glucose) + log10 (fasting insulin))) [30].
2.3.4. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
An OGTT was conducted at the end of the 8-week intervention in a subset of 20 participants
randomly selected from each snack group. Prior to consuming a 75 g glucose drink (Azer Scientific,
Morgantown, PA, USA, 10-FP-075), a blood sample (time 0, T0) was obtained as previously described.
Immediately following this collection, participants rapidly consumed their glucose drink and blood
samples were obtained at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after consumption. Blood samples were processed as
previously described to obtain serum.
From the OGTTs, the glucose, NEFAs, and hormone AUCs were calculated (described in statistical
analyses) as well as insulin resistance index (IRI), Matsuda index (MI) and disposition index (DI).
The IRI and MI are measures of whole-body insulin sensitivity.
IRI was calculated as glucose
AUC0–120min × insulin AUC0–120min [31,32]. MI was calculated as: 10,000/square root of [fasting
glucose × fasting insulin] × [mean glucose x mean insulin during OGTT] [33]. The disposition index,
a measure of β-cell function was calculated as MI × (∆glucose0–120 × ∆insulin0–120) [34].
2.3.5. 24-h Free-Living Appetite Ratings
Hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption ratings were measured on 100-mm
visual analog scales with end anchors of “not at all” to “extremely” [35]. These ratings were assessed
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 960

hourly during waking hours over a 24-h period. The means of the respective appetite ratings over the
24-h period were considered for analysis.
2.3.6. Acceptance and Palatability Ratings
Participants rated the acceptability of their snack biweekly using a 9-point food action rating scale
where 1 = “I would eat this if I were forced to” and 9 = “I would eat this every opportunity I had” [36].
Participants rated the palatability of their snack biweekly using a hedonic general labelled magnitude
scale (gLMS) [37] where −100 = “Extremely unpalatable” and 100 = “Extremely palatable”.
2.4. Statistical Analyses
We conducted a linear, mixed model analysis with week/OGTT time, snack group, and a
week/time-by-snack group interaction as factors for all absolute values of outcomes. Data not meeting
normality assumptions were transformed using Johnson’s family of transformations. Transformed
variables are marked in tables and figure legends. However, only non-transformed data and means
are presented for interpretation of biological significance. Analyses were adjusted for baseline/OGTT
T0 when baseline/OGTT T0 values had a significant effect on the model. When significant effects were
observed, pairwise comparisons were carried out with Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD),
except for OGTT time outcomes, where contrasts between snack groups at different time points were
constructed and adjusted for multiple comparisons.
A secondary analysis on the change in outcomes over 8 weeks, as opposed to absolute values,
was also performed (Table S2). OGTT AUCs were calculated using the standard trapezoidal rule.
Total AUCs were calculated over the entire 120 min as well as over and between the different
time points. AUCs and OGTT indices were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test with snack group as
a between-subject factor. A separate analysis including sex as between-subject factor for change in
outcomes over 8 weeks rather than absolute values and AUCs was also conducted but there were no
significant differences in any outcome. The effect of baseline BMI category x snack group on change
in outcomes over 8 weeks and OGTT AUCs and effect of baseline fasting total cholesterol category x
snack group, and baseline fasting glucose category x snack group on change in outcomes over 8 weeks
was evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis tests (Tables S3–S5 and S8). Pairwise comparisons were carried
out with Dunn all pairs for joint ranks test. A responder analysis was also conducted to determine if
the proportion of responders (i.e., those individuals demonstrating a positive change over time for the
specific outcome) is different between groups (Table S6).
Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was conducted on the intervention and
OGTT data to identify discriminatory features between the snack groups and principal component
analysis (PCA) was conducted on the correlation matrix obtained from the discriminatory features
(identified by PLS-DA) for visualization purposes (Figures S3–S5).
The alpha level was set at 0.05. All data are reported as means and SDs unless otherwise stated.
The p-values for the figures are presented in supplementary material (Table S7). JMP Pro (version 13,
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all the statistical analyses.
3. Results
3.1. Participant Characteristics
Seventy-three participants started and completed the study (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of
all participants are described in Table 1. BMI categories were assigned according to BMI-for-age-percentiles
for adolescents [38]. The total cholesterol, LDL and HDL categories are assigned according to healthy
cholesterol levels for individuals aged 19 or younger [39].
The proportion of participants with
fasting glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dL was higher in the cracker group compared to the almond
group (p < 0.05, Table 1). In general, study participants were at low to moderate risk of developing
cardiometabolic disorders.

3.2. Overall Breakfast Consumption and Sleep Habits 
Forty-six (63%) participants reported consuming breakfast either rarely, never or between 2–4 
times a week prior to the study. During the study, participants reported breakfast consumption 
(before snack) on an average of 3 days per week (2.8 ± 2.0 days/week). Participants reported an 
average of 7 h of sleep per day (6.9 ± 1.0 h/day) over the 8-week intervention. No snack group effect 
was detected for breakfast or sleep outcomes. 
3.3. Compliance with Snack Consumption 
Participants consumed their snacks on an average of 6 days per week (5.9 ± 1.7 days/week) over 
the 8-week intervention with no significant difference in overall compliance between the almond and 
cracker snack groups (p = 0.97). Average time of snack consumption was recorded as 11:00 am. In 
addition, data from 24-h recalls indicated the percentage of energy from fat and total alpha-
tocopherol (i.e., nutrients rich in almonds) was greater in the almond group at the end of the 8-week 
intervention compared to the cracker group (group x time effect, p < 0.05) (Table 2). In general, the 
almond group reported greater total fat, MUFAs, oleic acid, and lower percentage of energy from 
carbohydrate compared to the cracker group (group effect, p < 0.05). 
3.4. BM and Fat-Free Mass Increased over 8 Weeks in Both Snack Groups 
Total BM significantly increased from baseline to week 4 and to week 8 of the intervention (time 
effect, p < 0.05, Table 3) while fat-free mass significantly increased from baseline to week 8 and week 
4 to week 8 (time effect, p < 0.05, Table 3). Total fat mass, trunk fat mass, trunk fat-free mass, and 
waist circumference were not significantly different between baseline and week 8 (Table 3).  
All anthropometric outcomes were similar in both the almond and cracker groups at the end of the 
8-week intervention. 
3.5. Cardiovascular Outcomes Did Not Change Significantly over 8 Weeks in Both Snack Groups 
Resting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure 
were not significantly different between baseline, week 4 and week 8 (Table 3). There was no 
difference in any of the blood pressure outcomes or RHI and AI between the almond and cracker 
groups at the end of the 8-week intervention (Table 3).

3.6. Almond Group Had a Smaller Decline in Fasting HDL Cholesterol over 8 Weeks Compared to the
Cracker Group
Fasting serum total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased (time
effect, p < 0.05) from baseline to week 8 and week 4 to week 8 of the intervention (Figure 2a,b). LDL
cholesterol concentrations progressively decreased from baseline to week 4 to week 8 (p < 0.05, Figure 2c).
In addition, triglyceride concentrations marginally decreased from week 4 to week 8 (time effect, p < 0.05)
with no overall difference over the 8-week intervention (Figure 2d). However, the almond group had
significantly lower decrease in HDL cholesterol over 8 weeks compared to the cracker group (13.5%
vs. 24.5%, primary analysis: time x group effect, change analysis: group effect, p < 0.05, Figure 2b and
Table S2) and a trend for smaller decrease in total cholesterol (primary analysis: time × group effect,
p = 0.09). However, the secondary baseline-adjusted change analysis where week 4 was removed from
consideration demonstrated a significant group effect, p = 0.04 (Table S2). Supplementary analyses indicate
that overweight individuals in the cracker group had a greater decrease in HDL cholesterol compared
to normal-weight individuals in the almond group (p < 0.05, Table S3). In addition, individuals with
fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL in both the cracker and almond groups had a greater decline in total, LDL
and HDL cholesterol than individuals in the almond group with fasting glucose <100 mg/dL (p < 0.05,
Table S5). Responder analysis also indicates that the cracker group had a higher proportion of individuals
demonstrating a decline in LDL (regardless of magnitude) than the almond group (p < 0.05, Table S6).

the End of the 8-Week Intervention 
The IRI was significantly lower (34%) and Matsuda index was significantly higher (82%) in the 
almond group compared to the cracker group (group effect, p < 0.05, Figure 5a,b). The disposition 
index was not significantly different between the cracker and almond groups (Figure 5c). 
Supplementary analyses indicate that normal-weight individuals in the almond group had a higher 
Matsuda Index than obese individuals in the cracker group (p < 0.05, Table S8).

compared to crackers (5.4 ± 1.7 vs. 4.6 ± 1.6 FACT scale units, group effect, p < 0.05).
3.13. Activity Energy Expenditure Decreased on the Weekends over the 8-Week Intervention
Mean activity energy expenditure decreased over the weekends (2.2 ± 1.8 (baseline) vs.

2.01 ± 1.0 (week 8) kcal/minute, time x weekday/weekend effect, p < 0.05) at the end of the 8-week
intervention. There was no significant difference in activity energy expenditure between the almond
and cracker groups.
4. Discussion
The present study demonstrated that almond snacking was associated with greater glucose
tolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity (assessed with indices of postprandial state) at 8 weeks
and smaller decline in HDL cholesterol but similar decline in fasting glucose as the cracker
group in spite of minimal gains in body mass over 8 weeks. It is possible that in young adults
with no cardiometabolic disorders, the benefits of chronic almond consumption may manifest as
acute improvements in glucose tolerance. Postprandial glucose may serve as a better marker for
detecting early perturbations in glucose metabolism in nondiabetic individuals than fasting glucose as
individuals spend most of the day in the postprandial or post-absorptive state [41]. Postprandial (2 h)
glucose is also a strong predictor of mortality and cardiometabolic disorders [41]. Acute feeding studies
in healthy adults have demonstrated benefits of almonds when eaten with meals on postprandial
glucose [6,42] and insulin [42] responses. Almond consumption also has second-meal effects on
glycemic control, but was observed previously only in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance [5].
The second-meal effect is a phenomenon where a prior meal attenuates postprandial blood glucose
responses to a subsequent meal [43,44]. Studies investigating the chronic effects of almond snacking on
postprandial glycemic control are scarce, short-term (i.e., 4 weeks), conducted in at-risk individuals [17],
or T2DM individuals [45], and have not measured a small suite of glucoregulatory hormones
simultaneously. The present study expands the evidence on these effects in young adults. The unique
nutrient composition of almonds, which are rich in unsaturated fats, fiber, and polyphenols and
low in simple carbohydrates, has a moderating effect on postprandial glycemia [5,6,42] suppressing
glucose excursions, which may contribute to benefits with long-term consumption in the dynamic
postprandial state.
The positive relationship between adiponectin and insulin sensitivity is well established [46].
The present study supports this contention as the integrated adiponectin response to OGTT was
positively correlated with the Matsuda index (index of insulin sensitivity, supplementary analyses)
suggesting that improvements in glucose tolerance are at least partially mediated by adiponectin.
However, almond snacking did not differentially influence the stimulation of GLP-1 during the
OGTT in this study, indicating that the glucoregulatory benefits were possibly independent of
incretin response.
Almond snacking for 8 weeks had a marginally protective effect on HDL cholesterol by
ameliorating the decrease (13.5%) compared to the cracker group (24.5%) but had similar beneficial
decreases in LDL cholesterol as the cracker group. Although there was a trend towards a smaller decline
in total cholesterol with almond snacking as well, the change in total cholesterol was largely driven by
the change in HDL cholesterol. In contrast, a recent systematic review observed a reduction in total and
LDL cholesterol but no change in HDL cholesterol with almond consumption [47]. However, the review
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 960
15 of 19
incorporated studies conducted on participants of a much greater median age. In a very recent and
novel study published after the review, almond (43 g/day) consumption improved α-1 HDL and
α-1/pre–β-1 HDL subspecies compared to the control in individuals of normal weight albeit elevated
LDL cholesterol [48]. These favorable changes in HDL subspecies may not be captured in studies
assessing only total HDL cholesterol, for example, the present study and those included in the
systematic review [47]. Since α-1 HDL is a better (negative) predictor of coronary heart disease than
total HDL cholesterol [49], measuring HDL subspecies in future studies is important. On the other hand,
almond and cracker snacking resulted in similar declines in fasting glucose and improvements in β-cell
function (HOMA-β) over the 8-week intervention. The decline in fasting glucose levels over 8 weeks
with both almond and cracker snacking is likely due to increased frequency of breakfast/morning
snack consumption (and not increased insulin/incretin response) since skipping breakfast is associated
with higher fasting blood glucose [50,51]. However, the lack of a “no morning snack” group is an
important limitation that precludes assessment of breakfast skipping physiological responses.
The 8-week intervention resulted in minimal (0.8 kg) body mass gain in free-living and
predominantly breakfast skipping college students regardless of snack group. The decrease in activity
energy expenditure on the weekends may have contributed to body mass gain. Several studies have
indicated significant positive associations between body mass gain in college and a decrease in physical
activity, in some cases, despite decreased energy intake [52–54]. The typical mass gain for freshmen
students is 1–3 kg over the academic year [18,19], amounting to 0.1 kg/wk in the worst-case scenario,
which is the same rate of gain observed in the present study, suggesting intervention-associated gains
were not exceptional but expected. Although the mass gained was mostly fat-free mass (0.6 kg),
the limitations of bioelectrical impedance analysis in accurately assessing body composition [55],
particularly in individuals with obesity [56], and the limitations of accelerometers in assessing activity
during strength training [57] should be considered while interpreting this finding. Our findings are in
contrast with the preponderance of nut and body mass literature which suggests that nut consumption
does not lead to significant gains in body mass [58], likely due to the confounding effects of physical
activity. Supplementary analyses further suggest that overweight and obesity, and higher fasting
glucose and total cholesterol levels may differentially influence the response to a high-fat (almond)
versus a high-carbohydrate (cracker) snack. Future studies need to be powered adequately to confirm
the reliability of these responses.
Although the acute benefits of almond consumption on appetite are well documented [17,59,60],
the long-term effects of almond snacking in young adults are unclear. The present study demonstrated
a similar decline in subjective hunger and desire to eat ratings at 4 weeks with almond and cracker
consumption, and a subsequent increase at 8 weeks resulting in no significant change over 8 weeks.
Interestingly, this temporal pattern of appetite ratings corresponded with an increase in satiety
regulating gut peptide, GLP-1, at week 4 and decrease at week 8 with no significant change over
the 8-week intervention as well. Hence, while the macronutrient composition of a food contributes
to the regulation of appetite acutely [61], the differential appetitive effects may not be sustained in
chronic studies.
The decline in almond and cracker palatability and acceptance ratings from a moderate state at
baseline to a neutral state at the end of the intervention could be a result of monotony effects arising
from repeated daily consumption [62]. Repeated nut consumption has dose-dependent monotony
effects with higher doses (60 g/day) associated with decreased acceptance compared to lower doses
(30 g/day) [63]. One study found that long-term (12-week) almond consumption under energy
restriction conditions did not decrease palatability and acceptance in compliant individuals [64].
However, the study individualized the almond dose (15% of energy-restricted diet) [64] compared
to the fixed 56.7 g/day dose in the present study. Nevertheless, almonds had significantly higher
acceptance throughout the study compared to crackers, suggesting that repeated consumption of a
nutritious almond snack is well accepted over a typical refined carbohydrate snack in this population.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 960

An important strength of the study lies in the extremely high compliance of snack consumption,
likely resulting from the deployment of peer study researchers used to visually ensure daily participant
consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first almond consumption study to recruit first-year
college students, the majority of whom were breakfast skippers. A limitation of the study was not
conducting the same 5-time point OGTT prior to the intervention, as performed at 8 weeks, to allow
for a pre-post intervention assessment. However, there were no differences in baseline fasting insulin
sensitivity between groups. In addition, we performed a modified OGTT measuring blood glucose
by finger sticks at 0, 60 and 120 min. These data demonstrated no significant group effect on glucose
AUC0–120min suggesting that the groups were similar with respect to their glucose tolerance status at
the onset of the intervention (data not shown). Another limitation was the 7-day spring break that
immediately followed the mid-point of the intervention; however, the lack of remarkable differences at
week 4 that were ultimately captured at week 8, implies that the impacts of such an interruption at the
mid-point were not profound.
5. Conclusions
Almond consumption (56.7 g/2 oz.)
in an 8-week, free-living environment, marginally
ameliorated the decline in HDL cholesterol and resulted in greater postprandial glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity than a cracker snack despite expected minimal gain in body mass. In general,
incorporating a morning snack in the dietary regimen of first-year college students, a group which is
susceptible to poor lifestyle habits as they transition to independence, reduced fasting glucose and
cholesterol. However, cardiometabolic risk factors may differentially influence the response to cracker
vs. almond consumption. The physiological and clinical significance of these changes have yet to be
examined and may be more pronounced in youth with or at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders.
