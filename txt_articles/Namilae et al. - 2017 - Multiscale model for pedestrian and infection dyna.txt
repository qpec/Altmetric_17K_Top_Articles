Abstract 
  
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
developed 
a 
novel 
multiscale 
model 
combining 
social-
force 
based 
pedestrian 
movement 
with 
a 
population 
level 
stochastic 
infection 
transmission 
dynamics 
framework. 
The 
model 
is 
then 
applied 
to 
study 
the 
infection 
transmission 
within 
airplanes 
and 
the 
transmission 
of 
Ebola 
virus 
through 
casual 
contacts. 
Drastic 
limitations 
on 
air-
travel 
during 
epidemics, 
such 
as 
during 
the 
2014 
Ebola 
outbreak 
in 
West 
Africa, 
carry 
considerable 
economic 
and 
human 
costs. 
We 
use 
the 
computational 
model 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effects 
of 
passenger 
movement 
within 
airplanes 
and 
air-
travel 
policies 
on 
the 
geospatial 
spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
We 
found 
that 
boarding 
policy 
by 
an 
airline 
is 
more 
critical 
for 
infection 
propagation 
compared 
to 
deplaning 
policy. 
Enplaning 
in 
two 
sections 
resulted 
in 
fewer 
infections 
than 
the 
currently 
followed 
strategy 
with 
multiple 
zones. 
In 
addition, 
we 
found 
that 
small 
commercial 
airplanes 
are 
better 
than 
larger 
ones 
at 
reducing 
number 
of 
new 
infections 
in 
a 
flight. 
Aggregated 
results 
indicate 
that 
passenger 
movement 
strategies 
and 
airplane 
size 
predicted 
through 
these 
network 
models 
can 
have 
significant 
impact 
on 
an 
event 
like 
2014 
Ebola 
epidemic. 
The 
methodology 
developed 
here 
is 
generic 
and 
can 
be 
readily 
modified 
to 
incorporate 
impact 
from 
outbreak 
of 
other 
directly 
transmitted 
infectious 
diseases.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Commercial 
air 
travel 
enables 
rapid 
transmission 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
across 
the 
globe. 
Travelers 
are 
in 
close 
proximity 
to 
each 
other 
and 
are 
susceptible 
to 
infection 
spread 
in 
common 
spaces 
such 
as 
airport 
boarding 
areas, 
lounges, 
security 
lines 
and 
within 
commercial 
airplanes. 
In 
addition, 
air 
travel 
brings 
together 
people 
from 
different 
geographic 
regions 
with 
different 
levels 
of 
vulnerability 
and 
receptivity 
due 
to 
variations 
in 
immunity, 
ethnic 
background, 
and 
intervention 
usage 
across 
geographic 
areas 
[1]. 
There 
is 
direct 
evidence 
for 
spread 
of 
infection 
within 
commercial 
airplanes 
for 
many 
infectious 
diseases 
including 
influenza 
[2], 
SARS 
[3], 
tuberculosis 
[4], 
measles 
[5] 
and 
norovirus 
[6]. 
 
Several 
factors 
affect 
the 
infection 
transmission 
in 
the 
high 
occupancy 
enclosed 
environment 
of 
aircraft 
cabins, 
including 
cabin 
air 
quality, 
exposure 
time, 
flight 
duration, 
and 
passenger 
contact 
due 
to 
inflight 
movement. 
The 
high 
efficiency 
particulate 
filters 
used 
in 
current 
airplanes 
are 
effective 
in 
reducing 
a 
contagion 
in 
the 
recirculated 
air 
[7]; 
however, 
virus 
shedding 
from 
infected 
passengers 
before 
the 
air 
can 
pass 
through 
filters 
can 
lead 
to 
other 
passengers 
becoming 
infected. 
In 
this 
context, 
passenger 
location 
and 
movement 
resulting 
in 
close 
contact 
between 
infective 
and 
susceptible 
populations 
is 
a 
critical 
component 
in 
infection 
spread 
aboard 
airplanes. 
Passengers 
move 
during 
boarding 
(ingress), 
deplaning 
(egress) 
and 
within 
the 
cabin. 
Susceptible 
passengers 
otherwise 
not 
exposed 
to 
the 
contagion 
may 
come 
into 
contact 
with 
it 
when 
they 
are 
in 
close 
proximity 
of 
infected 
passengers 
or 
contaminated 
surfaces 
during 
the 
high 
mobility 
phases 
of 
passenger 
entry 
and 
exit. 
There 
is 
a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
contact 
rates 
and 
infection 
rates 
in 
a 
number 
of 
disease 
epidemics 
including 
SARS 
[8] 
and 
Ebola 
[9]. 
The 
probability 
of 
infectious 
disease 
transmission 
when 
the 
host 
and 
agent 
come 
into 
contact 
is 
inherently 
stochastic 
and 
depends 
on 
variations 
in 
multiple 
factors 
including 
infectivity 
(virus 
content 
in 
bodily 
fluids 
and 
rate 
of 
shedding), 
age, 
and 
demographic 
characteristics. 
Stochastic 
infection 
models 
such 
as 
Susceptible-
Exposed-
Infectious 
(SEI) 
model 
have 
been 
effectively 
used 
in 
studying 
such 
infectious 
disease 
spread 
[10]. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
develop 
a 
novel 
hybrid 
model 
that 
combines 
a 
social 
force 
based 
pedestrian 
dynamical 
model 
with 
a 
stochastic 
infection 
transmission 
framework 
to 
study 
the 
effect 
of 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
on 
the 
infection 
spread. 
 
Often 
there 
are 
limitations 
in 
modeling 
quantities 
related 
to 
real 
systems. 
Therefore, 
stochasticity 
is 
naturally 
inherent 
in 
systems, 
that 
is, 
there 
is 
uncertainty 
in 
its 
constituents. 
In 
order 
to 
address 
distinct 
types of uncertainty present in the system, we use scenario analyses into the aforementioned 
stochastic/probabilistic 
process 
based 
on 
SEI 
framework 
to 
allow 
for 
variance 
in 
projections 
of 
output 
parameters. 
 
We 
quantify 
the 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
input 
parameters 
as 
well 
as 
structural 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
model 
itself 
by 
simulating 
over 
the 
design 
space. 
 
As 
a 
case 
study, 
we 
utilize 
the 
model 
to 
assess 
the 
propagation 
of 
Ebola 
aboard 
an 
airplane. 
During 
the 
2014-
15 
Ebola 
epidemic, 
despite 
travel 
restrictions, 
there 
have 
been 
a 
few 
instances 
of 
Ebola 
infected 
travelers 
using 
commercial 
airplanes 
in 
the 
USA 
and 
Nigeria 
[11-
13]. 
Models 
have 
suggested 
that 
7.17 
infected 
travelers 
per 
month 
would 
have 
been 
transported 
through 
commercial 
airlines 
without 
air 
travel 
restrictions 
[14]. 
Detailed 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
enables 
tracking 
the 
trajectories 
of 
passengers 
that 
is 
needed 
to 
assess 
passenger 
contact 
rates 
due 
to 
different 
air-
travel 
policies. 
While 
all 
in-
plane 
passenger 
movement 
(e.g. 
movement 
of 
airplane 
staff, 
passenger 
movement 
to 
restrooms 
etc.) 
can 
contribute 
to 
infection 
spread, 
discretionary 
nature 
of 
such 
activities 
requires 
additional 
uncertainty 
considerations 
and 
difficulty 
in 
modeling, 
therefore, 
we 
focus 
on 
high 
pedestrian 
density 
and 
mobility 
phases 
of 
airplane 
boarding 
and 
deplaning 
in 
this 
paper. 
Through 
the 
modeling 
framework 
developed 
in 
this 
paper, 
we 
assess 
the 
air-
travel 
and 
passenger 
movement 
strategies 
that 
can 
reduce 
the 
infectious 
disease 
spread. 
The 
pedestrian 
movement 
component 
can 
be 
used 
to 
model 
different 
crowded 
locations 
like 
airports 
and 
the 
stochastic 
infection 
dynamics 
component 
can 
be 
used 
for 
other 
directly 
transmitted 
diseases. 
The 
integrated 
model 
developed 
here 
is 
therefore 
general 
and 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
other 
infection 
studies.

MODEL 
FORMULATION 
We 
model 
the 
motion 
of 
pedestrians 
using 
a 
molecular 
dynamics 
based 
social 
force 
model 
[15]. 
Considering 
a 
pedestrian 
as 
a 
particle 
in 
motion, 
the 
pedestrian 
particle 
is 
subjected 
to 
competing 
forces 
of 
a 
person’s 
desire 
to 
travel 
to 
a 
destination 
while 
impeded 
by 
obstructions 
(e.g. 
walls, 
chairs 
and 
other 
pedestrians). 
The 
total 
force 
experienced 
by 
a 
pedestrian: 
�
�
�=∑ �

�
�

�����

Where 
�
�
� 
is 
the 
resulting 
force, 
�
�
���
����� 
is 
the 
force 
exerted 
by 
the 
pedestrian 
in 
the 
intention 
to 
reach 
his/her 
terminus, 
�
�
���
������ 
is 
the 
resisting 
forces 
obstructing 
the 
motion, 
�� 
the 
body 
mass 
and, 
 
��
� 
and 
��
� 
are 
the 
instantaneous 
velocity 
and 
acceleration 
at 
time 
t 
respectively. 
The 
intention 
force 
relates 
the 
desired 
velocity 
of 
pedestrian 
i 
moving 
towards 
a 
destination 
(����� 
to 
the 
actual 
speed

�
�

�����

�  
[ 
���
�
�
�
���� � ��
���� ] 
(2)
Here, 
� 
is 
a 
time 
step. 
We 
modify 
the 
equations 
of 
motion 
by 
introducing 
a 
local 
neighbor 
dependence 
to 
the 
desired 
velocity ( )
i
o
v t . 
In 
line 
forming 
applications 
like 
in 
an 
airplane 
entry 
or 
exit, 
the 
self-
propelling 
intention 
force 
and 
desired 
velocity 
of 
ith 
pedestrian 
is 
dependent 
on 
the 
position 
of 
nearest 
pedestrian 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
motion, 
i.e. 
in 
front 
of 
the 
pedestrian 
particle 
in 
the 
line. 
To 
model 
the 
slowing 
of 
pedestrian 
particle 
as 
they 
approach 
other 
particles 
in 
a 
line, 
the 
desired 
velocity 
of 
ith 
pedestrian ( )
i
o

the 
critical 
distance 
between 
two 
pedestrians 
in 
a 
line 
at 
which 
the

pedestrian 
becomes

Equation 
(3) 
ensures 
that 
attractive 
force 
toward 
destination 
is 
reduced 
when 
a 
pedestrian 
encounters 
another 
particle 
and 
the 
desired 
speed 
reduces 
to 
zero 
when 
the 
distance 
between 
them 
is 
δ. 
The 
second 
part 
of 
particle 
dynamics 
in 
equation 
(1) 
considers 
the 
repulsive 
social 
force 
term 
(�

����
������� 
 
that 
inhibits 
the 
motion 
of 
pedestrian 
particles. 
The 
repulsive 
force 
is 
essential 
to 
ensure 
impenetrability 
of 
particles. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
we 
use 
the 
repulsive 
term 
[16] 
of 
Lennard-
Jones 
potential 
given 
by: 
�

where

and 
� 
are 
constants 
and 
�
�� 
is 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
��� and 
��� 
pedestrians. 
The 
equation 
of 
motion 
in 
(1) 
is 
numerically 
integrated 
to 
obtain 
the 
velocities 
and 
positions 
in 
the 
subsequent 
time 
steps. 
We 
apply 
this 
approach 
to 
pedestrian 
movement 
in 
airplanes 
to 
obtain 
the 
trajectories 
of 
pedestrian 
movement for different boarding and deplaning methods. Note that equations (1-
4) are in two 
dimensional 
space 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
pedestrian 
movement. 
 
 
There 
are 
several 
parameters 
in 
the 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
model, 
such 
as 
maximum 
walking 
speed
(
)
A
B
v
v
+
, 
random 
variation 
(
i
γ ), 
distance 
parameter 
(δ ), 
two 
parameters 
for 
the 
Lennard-
Jones 
repulsive 
force 
terms 
(� 
and 
σ) 
and 
aisle 
delay 
for 
luggage. 
There 
is 
experimental 
data 
available 
for 
some 
of 
the 
parameters 
like 
the 
range 
of 
walking 
speed 
[17, 
18]. 
Also 
the 
observed 
exit 
times 
and 
passenger 
flow 
rate 
for 
some 
commercial 
airplanes 
is 
available 
in 
the 
literature 
[19, 
20]. 
 
To 
obtain 
the 
estimates 
of 
other 
model 
parameters 
that 
represent 
realistic 
model 
behavior 
of 
an 
outbreak 
we 
vary 
the 
parameters 
over 
a 
large 
design 
space. 
 
In 
our 
earlier 
study 
[21], 
we 
used 
a 
parameter 
sweep 
on 
60,000 
processors 
to 
determine 
the 
parameters 
that 
match 
the 
available 
observed 
data 
of 
deplaning 
[19, 
20]. 
We 
have 
been 
able 
to 
match 
the 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
model 
with 
experimental 
data 
on 
flowrates 
and 
exit 
times 
for 
five 
different 
airplane 
seating 
configurations 
for 
which 
test 
data 
is 
available. 
In 
addition, 
we 
have 
also 
been 
able 
to 
capture 
qualitative 
features 
like 
front 
to 
back 
unloading 
and 
hallway 
congestion 
[21]. 
 
The 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
parameters 
obtained 
through 
our 
earlier 
work 
[21] 
are 
used 
in 
the 
model 
and 
are 
tabulated 
in 
Table 
I. 
The 
pedestrian 
trajectory 
information 
from 
the 
above 
model 
(equations 
1-
4) 
is 
integrated 
with 
a 
discrete-
time 
stochastic 
Susceptible-
Exposed-
Infectious 
(SEI) 
model 
for 
infection 
transmission 
described 
below 
(equations 
5-
6). 
Note 
that 
in 
the 
context 
of 
air-
travel 
of 
a 
few 
hours 
newly 
exposed 
(and 
infected) 
passengers 
do 
not 
become 
infectious.

and 
I(t) 
is 
the 
total 
number 
of 
infected

in 
the 
modeled

In 
the 
current 
model, 
we 
consider 
that 
there 
is 
one 
infective 
with 
Ebola 
in 
a 
given 
population 
that 
fills 
an 
airplane, 
however 
this 
number 
can 
be 
higher 
for 
more 
common 
infectious 
diseases 
like 
influenza. 
We 
also 
assume 
that 
the 
initial 
number 
of 
exposed 
in 
the 
system 
is 
zero. 
 
 
When 
these

infectives 
come 
into 
contact 
with 
i

susceptibles 
estimated 
by 
the 
pedestrian

model, 
the 
newly 
infected 
and 
the 
probability 
of 
their 
infection 
can 
be 
estimated 
using 
a 
binomial 
distribution. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
air-
travel, 
the 
model 
population 
is 
relatively 
small 
(a 
few 
hundred 
passengers), 
hence, 
contacts 
are 
few. 
We 
assume 
that 
probability 
of 
an 
individual 
infecting 
each 
susceptible 
is 
small 
and 
number 
of 
susceptibles 
as 
compared 
to 
infected 
(or 
exposed) 
is 
larger. 
Under 
this 
assumption, 
we 
approximated 
binomial 
distribution 
using 
Poisson 
distribution. 
The 
newly 
infected 
at

the

The 
use 
of 
Poisson 
distribution 
accounts 
for 
demographic 
stochasticity 
and 
variations 
in 
susceptibility 
of 
the 
population. 
The 
probability-
distribution 
of 
infection 
transmission 
varies 
depending 
on 
the 
incubation 
periods 
and 
transmission 
rates 
for 
specific 
diseases 
and 
is 
a 
primary 
input 
data 
required 
for 
the 
stochastic 
infection 
transmission 
model. 
For 
example, 
for 
Ebola 
virus 
the 
mean 
incubation 
period 
is 
12.7 
days 
[22], 
with 
logarithmic 
increase 
in 
virus 
levels 
in 
blood 
during 
acute 
illness 
phase 
[23]. 
 
The 
RNA 
virus 
copies 
in 
the 
serum 
is 
indicative 
of 
the 
transmission 
probability 
and 
we 
used 
the 
corresponding 
Center 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
(CDC) 
data 
[23] 
to 
obtain 
the 
infectivity 
profile 
shown 
in 
Figure 
2. 
Since, 
there 
is 
no 
possibility 
of 
mortality 
by 
infection 
in 
the 
short 
timescale 
of 
the 
model, 
we 
used 
weighted 
(by 
sample 
size) 
average 
of 
both 
fatal 
and 
nonfatal 
data 
from 
[23] 
to 
compute 
the 
probabilities 
in 
figure 
2. 
 
The 
overall 
model 
can 
be 
adapted 
to 
other 
directly 
transmitted 
infectious 
diseases 
as 
well 
as 
other 
crowded 
locations 
(e.g. 
airport 
security 
lines) 
by 
modifying 
the 
infectivity 
input 
and 
the 
control 
parameters 
in 
Table 
1. 
Here 
we 
used 
the 
integrated 
model 
to 
study 
infection 
transmission 
inside 
an 
airplane. 
Inherent 
uncertainties 
in 
human 
behavior 
and 
stochasticity 
in 
infection 
spread 
make 
precise 
prediction 
of 
number 
of 
infections 
difficult. 
Instead, 
we 
identify 
policies 
and 
passenger 
movement 
strategies 
that 
generally 
lead 
to 
reducing 
the 
spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases.

RESULTS 
AND 
DISCUSSION 
 We 
consider 
the 
situation 
with 
one 
infected 
individual 
with 
Ebola 
travelling 
on 
a 
commercial 
airplane. 
The 
infective 
passenger 
onboard 
is 
not 
identifiable; 
therefore, 
we 
varied 
the 
seating 
position 
of 
the 
infected 
individual 
through 
all 
the 
seats 
in 
the 
airplane. 
At 
each 
seating 
location 
of 
the 
infective, 
we 
obtained 
the 
mean 
number 
of 
newly 
infected 
members 
and 
corresponding 
discrete 
Poisson 
distribution 
using 
the 
above 
formulation. 
We 
combined 
these 
distributions 
to 
evaluate 
the 
probability 
of 
k 
newly 
infected 
passengers 
when 
an 
infected 
individual 
is 
on 
the 
airplane 
at 
any 
possible 
seating 
position. 
The 
mean 
number 
of 
newly 
infected 
is 
the 
key 
measure 
we 
use 
in 
comparing 
the 
infection 
spread 
using 
different 
boarding 
and 
deplaning 
strategies. 
 
We 
used 
this 
approach 
to 
evaluate 
air 
travel 
policies 
such 
as 
boarding 
strategies 
and 
airplane 
seating 
capacity 
that 
impact 
infectious 
disease 
spread. 
 
 
 The 
boarding 
and 
exiting 
strategies 
have 
been 
investigated 
in 
earlier 
studies 
with 
respect 
to 
minimizing 
the 
turn-
around 
time 
of 
airplanes 
at 
boarding 
gates 
[e.g. 
19, 
20]. 
Several 
passenger 
ingress 
strategies 
such 
as 
random, 
outside-
in, 
back 
to 
front, 
column 
wise, 
zone/section 
style 
enplanement 
have 
been 
studied. 
We 
compare 
a 
few 
of 
the 
boarding 
strategies 
with 
respect 
to 
spread 
of 
infections.

3, 
we 
show 
that 
the 
three-
sections 
boarding 
method 
has 
the 
highest 
mean 
and 
thus 
represents 
the 
worst 
strategy 
for 
reducing 
spread 
of 
infection. 
Interestingly, 
many 
current 
airlines 
use 
such 
a 
strategy 
with 
multiple 
zones 
or 
sections. 
 
In 
this 
method 
passengers 
sitting 
in 
the 
front 
of 
the 
aircraft 
(e.g. 
first 
class) 
board 
first 
followed 
by 
a 
middle 
zone 
and 
then 
the 
back 
section 
of 
the 
airplane. 
Because 
of 
this 
pattern, 
the 
passage-
way 
is 
filled 
with 
passengers 
waiting 
to 
get 
to 
their 
seats 
resulting 
in 
clustering 
and 
increased 
exposure 
with 
infected 
passenger 
and 
therefore 
resulting 
in 
a 
higher 
number 
of 
newly 
infected 
passengers. 
 
The 
column-
wise 
method, 
used 
here, 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
outside-
inside 
strategy 
in 
a 
front-
to-
back 
manner. 
This 
scheme 
also 
results 
in 
more 
infected 
members. 
For 
the 
random 
and 
two-
sections 
boarding, 
passengers 
close 
together 
in 
a 
queue 
may 
be 
seated 
in 
seats 
that 
are 
wide 
apart. 
This 
leads 
to 
arbitrary 
movement 
of 
passengers 
along 
the 
cabin 
preventing 
clustering 
of 
a 
group 
of 
travelers 
around 
the 
infected 
passenger 
which 
in-
turn 
reduces 
infection 
transmission. 
The 
two-
section 
and 
random 
boarding 
have 
the 
same 
mean 
value 
of 
two 
newly 
infected, 
although 
the 
infection 
transmission 
for 
two-
section 
strategy 
results 
in 
a 
lower 
probability 
of 
infection 
at 
the 
mean. 
A 
two–section 
strategy 
involves 
dividing 
the 
plane 
into 
two 
sections 
and 
the 
passengers 
are 
randomly 
boarded 
within 
these 
sections. 
Our 
model 
suggests 
that 
this 
approach 
may 
be 
a 
good 
choice 
to 
reduce 
infection 
transmissions 
during 
boarding. 
We 
find 
the 
similar 
pattern 
of 
results 
for 
144 
seat 
Airbus 
A320 
seating 
configuration 
as 
well 
as 
182 
seat 
Boeing 
757-
200 
seating 
configuration 
(see 
Figure 
3 
a 
& 
b). 
In 
these 
simulations 
(figures 
3, 
4 
and 
5) 
the 
airplanes 
contain 
a 
single 
Ebola 
infected 
passenger 
with 
infectivity 
corresponding 
to 
one 
day 
of 
infection 
in 
an 
unidentified 
seating 
location 
with 
a 
contact 
radius 
of 
1.2 
m.

and

 We 
followed 
a 
similar 
approach 
for 
the 
deplaning 
strategies. 
We 
found 
that 
deplaning 
had 
a 
smaller 
impact 
on 
infection 
dynamics 
because 
of 
the 
lower 
number 
of 
new 
contacts 
and 
lower 
time 
of 
exposure 
during 
the 
comparatively 
faster 
process. 
In 
Figure 
4, 
we 
show 
a 
comparison 
of 
deplaning 
strategies 
for 
the 
182 
seat 
Boeing 
757 
seating 
configuration. 
The 
different 
deplaning 
strategies 
such 
as 
alternating 
columns, 
alternating 
rows, 
zone 
wise 
and 
baseline 
(closest 
to 
exit 
-
 
out 
first) 
result 
in 
similar 
number 
of 
mean 
infectives. 
When 
we 
compare 
the 
probabilities 
alternate 
rows 
and 
baseline 
strategies 
are 
marginally 
better. 
In 
Figure 
5, 
we 
compute 
the 
mean 
infectives 
by 
combining 
the 
egress, 
ingress, 
and 
in-
plane 
movement. 
It 
is 
apparent 
that 
other 
pedestrian 
movement 
strategies 
can 
be 
better 
than 
the 
boarding 
using

We 
show 
the 
worst 
case 
situation 
where 
an 
infected 
individual 
with 
peak 
infectivity 
is 
seated 
at 
a 
location 
that 
results 
in 
the 
highest 
number 
of 
contacts. 
 
There 
is 
an 
inherent 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
human 
movement 
behavior 
as 
well 
as 
the 
stochasticity 
in 
the 
infection 
model. 
Many 
parameters 
affect 
the 
simulations 
including 
airplane 
size 
and 
seating 
arrangement, 
the 
number 
of 
infective 
passengers, 
the 
infectivity 
characterized 
by 
days 
post 
onset 
of 
symptoms, 
the 
radius 
of 
infection 
which 
in 
turn 
depends 
on 
transmission 
mechanics 
(e.g. 
 
Coughing, 
talking 
etc.), 
and 
the 
susceptibility 
of 
population. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
assign 
values 
for 
some 
of 
these 
parameters 
for 
deterministic 
analysis, 
however 
the 
uncertainty 
in 
these 
parameters 
needs 
to 
be 
quantified 
to 
assess 
effective 
air 
travel 
policies 
under 
a 
broad 
set 
of 
conditions. 
We 
have 
studied 
the 
variations 
in 
some 
of 
those 
parameters. 
 According 
to 
the 
CDC, 
data 
a 
nonfatal 
Ebola 
infection 
lasts 
for 
21 
days 
post 
onset 
of 
symptoms, 
with 
highest 
virus 
shedding 
rates 
and 
correspondingly 
highest 
infectivity 
in 
days 
3-
5 
of 
disease 
development 
[23]. 
The 
three 
zone 
boarding 
simulations 
are 
repeated 
by 
varying 
the 
number 
of 
days 
of 
infection 
for 
an 
infective 
person 
as 
we 
show 
in 
Figure 
6. 
The 
number 
of 
mean 
newly 
infected 
passengers 
clearly 
varies 
with 
the 
infectivity 
of 
the 
index 
passenger. 
During 
a 
known 
outbreak, 
reported 
infected 
passengers 
will 
most 
likely 
be 
grounded 
for 
further 
monitoring, 
but 
there 
have 
been 
three 
cases 
of 
potentially 
newly 
infected 
passengers 
travelling 
through 
commercial 
airplanes 
from 
the 
2014 
epidemic 
[11-
13]. 
A 
medical 
professional 
travelled 
in 
two 
commercial 
airplanes 
on 
October 
10th 
and 
October 
13, 
2014 
within 
United 
States 
[11]. 
The 
index 
case 
was 
tested 
and 
confirmed 
to 
be 
infected 
on 
October 
15th, 
however 
it 
is 
uncertain 
if 
the 
person 
was 
infectious 
and 
exhibiting 
symptoms 
during 
the 
travel 
dates. 
 
Contact 
tracing 
indicated 
no 
further 
infections. 
According 
to 
our 
simulations, 
the 
probability 
of 
zero 
new 
infected 
cases 
is 
about 
7% 
with 
a 
fully 
loaded 
flight. 
Note 
that 
there 
were 
large 
number 
of 
vacant 
seats 
in 
one 
of 
the 
flights 
which 
would 
have 
increased 
this 
probability. 
We 
cannot 
make 
a 
direct 
comparison 
because 
it 
is 
not 
known 
if 
the 
index 
case 
was 
infectious 
[11]. 
 
 Another 
critical 
model 
parameter 
is 
the 
contact 
radius 
which 
is 
the 
minimum 
distance 
at 
which 
a 
susceptible 
passenger 
in 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
infective 
can 
be 
potentially 
infected. 
The 
distance 
to 
which 
particles 
travel 
depends 
on 
the 
particle 
size 
and 
associated 
fluid 
mechanics 
in 
expiratory 
events 
like 
coughing 
and 
talking 
[24]. 
Experimental 
investigations 
measure 
particle 
size 
in 
these 
expiratory 
events 
to 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
0.1 
to 
10 
µm 
[25, 
26,

been 
estimated 
to 
travel 
over 
2 
m 
[24, 
27]. 
The 
transmission 
distance 
also 
depends 
on 
specific 
disease, 
for 
example, 
SARS 
has 
been 
transmitted 
by 
short 
range 
droplet 
based 
as 
well 
as 
longer 
range 
airborne 
mechanisms 
[28]. 
Primary 
mode 
of 
transmission 
for 
Ebola 
is 
through 
contact 
droplets, 
but 
studies 
with 
monkeys 
indicate 
possible 
transfer 
through 
aerosols 
[29]. 
Mangili 
and 
Gendreau 
[30] 
indicate 
large 
droplet 
and 
airborne 
mechanisms 
are 
possibly 
highest 
risk 
transmission 
mechanisms 
during 
air 
travel.

 We 
account 
for 
the 
effect 
of 
environmental 
variation 
and 
transmission 
methods 
on 
the 
contact 
radius 
by 
varying 
it 
from 
0.6 
m 
(24 
inch) 
to 
2.1 
m 
(84 
inch) 
as 
we 
show 
in 
Figure 
7. 
The 
typical 
seat 
width 
on 
airplanes 
is 
18 
inches 
(0.45 
m). 
We 
consider 
a 
distance 
between 
passenger 
particles 
of 
24 
inches 
(0.61m) 
 11 
 
as 
a 
touching 
distance. 
The 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
range 
in 
Figure 
7 
signifies 
a 
contact 
based 
and 
large 
droplet 
mechanism 
while 
a 
larger 
contact 
radius 
may 
be 
more 
relevant 
for 
aerosol 
based 
mechanisms. 
As 
expected, 
the 
number 
of 
newly 
infected 
passengers 
is 
lower 
when 
the 
contact 
radius 
is 
lower. 
 Next, 
we 
considered 
the 
size 
and 
the 
seating 
capacity 
of 
the 
airplane. 
 
In 
Figure 
8, 
we 
show 
the 
effect 
of 
airplane 
size 
with 
a 
random 
boarding 
strategy. 
Smaller 
airplanes 
such 
as 
CRJ-
200 
are 
better 
in 
reducing 
the 
spread 
of 
infection 
compared 
to 
larger 
capacity 
airplanes, 
however 
the 
advantage 
with 
smaller 
seating 
capacity 
of 
airplanes 
quickly 
vanishes 
as 
the 
number 
of 
seats 
increase 
beyond 
150. 
The 
smaller 
size 
of 
the 
susceptible 
population, 
lower 
number 
of 
susceptibles 
within 
a 
given 
contact 
radius 
and 
the 
reduced 
time 
of 
in-
plane 
movement 
are 
some 
of 
the 
factors 
that 
benefit 
smaller 
airplanes. 
 The 
improvements 
obtained 
for 
individual 
flights 
by 
these 
policy 
changes 
can 
benefit 
substantially 
over 
the 
course 
of 
an 
epidemic. 
For 
example, 
consider 
the 
case 
of 
2014 
Ebola 
epidemic: 
Bogoch 
et al. 
[14] 
estimate 
that 
without 
travel 
restrictions, 
41,750 
would 
have 
used 
air 
travel 
for 
international 
destinations 
in 
a 
given 
month 
from 
the 
highly 
affected 
countries 
of 
Liberia, 
Sierra-
Leone 
and 
Guinea. 
This 
is 
based 
on 
data 
from 
Sep-
Dec 
2013. 
They 
estimate 
that 
under 
these 
conditions, 
without 
travel 
restrictions, 
7.17 
infected 
travelers 
per 
month 
would 
travel 
out 
bound 
from 
these 
countries. 
Note 
that 
travel 
restrictions 
have 
resulted 
in 
very 
few 
cases 
of 
Ebola 
infected 
travelers 
using 
commercial 
airplanes. 
We 
aggregate 
our 
model 
results 
based 
on 
the 
data 
from 
[14]. 
We 
assume 
all 
the 
passengers 
traveling 
are 
divided 
equally 
between 
A320 
and 
Boeing 
757 
seating 
configurations 
considered 
in 
figure 
3, 
and 
move 
according 
to 
strategies 
discussed 
earlier 
(figures 
3, 
4 
and 
5). 
The 
mean 
number 
of 
infectives 
and 
probability 
of 
infection 
is 
computed 
as 
described 
earlier 
and 
aggregated 
per 
month. 
 
Our 
model 
suggests 
there 
is 
a 
67 
% 
probability 
of 
generating 
more 
than 
20 
new 
air-
travel 
related 
infections 
per 
month 
using 
the 
default 
boarding 
strategies 
with 
these 
144 
and 
182 
seat 
configuration 
airplanes. 
This 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
less 
than 
40% 
by 
using 
the 
better 
pedestrian 
movement 
strategies 
suggested 
in 
figures 
3 
and 
4. 
In 
addition, 
exclusive 
use 
of 
small 
50 
seater 
airplanes 
further 
reduces 
the 
probability 
of 
generating 
20 
infecteds 
to 
13% 
probability.

SUMMARY 
 A 
multiscale 
model 
combining 
social 
force 
based 
pedestrian 
dynamics 
and 
metapopulation 
stochastic 
infection 
dynamics 
model 
has 
been 
formulated. 
The 
model 
is 
used 
to 
study 
the 
dynamics 
of 
Ebola 
virus 
infection 
on 
airplanes 
specifically 
during 
pedestrian 
movement 
related 
to 
boarding 
and 
disembarkation. 
Specific 
air 
travel 
related 
policies 
that 
potentially 
mitigate 
diseases 
spread 
are 
identified. 
The 
modeling 
approach 
developed 
here 
is 
generic 
and 
can 
be 
readily 
modified 
to 
other 
directly 
transmitted 
infectious 
diseases 
and 
dense 
pedestrian 
spaces.
