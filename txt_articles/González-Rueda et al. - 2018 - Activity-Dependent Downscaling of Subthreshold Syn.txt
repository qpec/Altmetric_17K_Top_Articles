SUMMARY
Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for
cortical circuit refinement. The synaptic homeostasis
hypothesis suggests that synaptic connections are
strengthened during wake and downscaled during
sleep; however, it is not obvious how the same plas-
ticity rules could explain both outcomes. Using
whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation
of presynaptic input in urethane-anesthetized mice,
which exhibit slow-wave-sleep (SWS)-like activity,
we show that synaptic plasticity rules are gated by
cortical dynamics in vivo. While Down states support
conventional spike timing-dependent plasticity, Up
states are biased toward depression such that pre-
synaptic stimulation alone leads to synaptic depres-
sion, while connections contributing to postsynaptic
spiking are protected against this synaptic weak-
ening. We find that this novel activity-dependent
and input-specific downscaling mechanism has two
important computational advantages: (1) improved
signal-to-noise ratio, and (2) preservation of previ-
ously stored information. Thus, these synaptic plas-
ticity rules provide an attractive mechanism for
SWS-related
synaptic
downscaling
and
circuit
refinement.
INTRODUCTION
During development synaptic connections are formed, pruned,
and refined following synaptic plasticity rules, the most promi-
nent candidate of which is Hebbian plasticity. Hebb postulated
that synapse modifications occur when presynaptic activity
leads to, or correlates with, postsynaptic action potentials
(spikes; Hebb, 1949). Hebbian forms of plasticity, including
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), have since been
extensively studied in vitro (Bi and Poo, 1998; Feldman, 2000)
and incorporated in many computational models of circuit refine-
ment during development (Song and Abbott, 2001; Clopath and
Gerstner, 2010; Clopath et al., 2010; van Ooyen, 2011). How-
ever, to what extent these rules apply in the intact mammalian
brain is not known.
The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (Tononi and Cirelli,
2003) proposes that, whereas sensory experience at wake leads
to strengthening of the associated neocortical synapses, slow-
wave sleep (SWS) leads to a net depression of synaptic weights
(Vyazovskiy et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010). While Hebbian plas-
ticity, such as STDP, could explain the sensory-dependent
strengthening of synapses and underlie the emergence of
neuronal assemblies during wake, it is not obvious how the
same synaptic plasticity rules could also explain synaptic weak-
ening during sleep. Indeed, it is not known whether the SWS-
related downscaling of synaptic weights is due to synapse-
specific mechanisms or more global, neuron-wide downscaling
of synaptic weights (Turrigiano et al., 1998).
During SWS, cortical networks fluctuate at low frequency
(<1 Hz) between periods of high activity, known as Up states,
and more quiescent periods, known as Down states (Steriade
et al., 1993). Up and Down states (UDS) are observed in single
cells as subthreshold oscillations of up to 20 mV, leading to oc-
casional firing exclusively during Up states. In contrast, during
awake attention and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the cor-
tex is characterized by asynchronous and irregular activity. Thus,
it is possible that one role of UDS during SWS is to modulate syn-
aptic plasticity rules in order to promote the appropriate down-
scaling of synapses during sleep.
Here we compared synaptic plasticity rules during Up and
Down states in the developing barrel cortex of urethane-anes-
thetized mice showing SWS-like dynamics (Contreras and Ster-
iade, 1997). We studied layer (L)4-L2/3 connections at postnatal
days (P)16–P21, corresponding to the end of the critical period of
development of this synapse, when maximal circuit refinement
and sparsification of inputs are seen (Stern et al., 2001; Itami
and Kimura, 2012; van der Bourg et al., 2017). We discovered
that plasticity rules are modulated by Up states: spike-timing-
dependent potentiation (t-LTP) is absent and active synapses
failing to contribute to postsynaptic spiking are selectively
depressed. We show in a computational model that this synaptic
downscaling mechanism promotes the elimination of weak and

RESULTS
Study of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo
STDP-like synaptic changes in vivo have been previously
described using sensory-evoked postsynaptic responses (Me-
liza and Dan, 2006; Jacob et al., 2007; Gambino and Holtmaat,
2012; Pawlak et al., 2013). While such studies are important to
understand sensory coding, the specific inputs involved in each
trial are unknown. To study synapse-specific plasticity in vivo,
we used an LED for optogenetic activation of presynaptic affer-
ents during whole-cell recording of L2/3 regular spiking neu-
rons (Figures 1A and S1) in the barrel cortex of Six3-cre/Ai32
urethane-anesthetized mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2) selectively in L4 neurons (Figure 1B). The resting mem-
brane potential of every L2/3 neuron recorded presented low-
frequency (0.7 ± 0.06 Hz, n = 92) fluctuations between Up
and Down states (�55 mV versus �69 mV, Figure 1C). Occa-
sional REM-like activity was observed, characterized as long-
lasting activated states (>5 s) (Figure S2). Firing of L2/3 neurons
was sparse (0.25 Hz versus 1.06 Hz in L4, Figure S2) and
restricted to activated states, with only few highly active neu-
rons (7 out of 92; Figure 1C; de Kock and Sakmann, 2009).
Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in
postsynaptic L2/3 neurons following light-stimulation of L4 fi-
bers. To monitor EPSPs, we stimulated L4 at 0.1 Hz only during
Down states using a closed-loop circuit to prevent stimulation
during activated states (Figures 1C–1E). To assess synaptic
plasticity, we applied a pairing protocol (100 repetitions at
<0.2 Hz) following a 10-min stable baseline. At the end of the
plasticity protocol, the Down state stimulation was resumed
for a further 20 to 30 min (Figure 1F). Continued low-frequency
light stimulation of L4 input during Down states over 50 min
did not produce any significant change in synaptic weight
(98% ± 6%, n = 13, one sample Student’s t test p = 0.77, Fig-
ures 2A–2D), allowing us to use this method to study synaptic
plasticity in vivo.
Conventional STDP during Down States
We first asked whether STDP can be induced during Down
states in vivo by protocols similar to those described ex vivo in
the absence of network activity (Feldman, 2000; Rodrı
´guez-Mor-
eno and Paulsen, 2008). When L4 light stimulation was followed
within 10 ms by a single postsynaptic spike during Down states,
t-LTP was induced (129% ± 15%, n = 8, versus 98% ± 6% inter-
leaved controls, n = 13; two-sample Student’s t test p = 0.038;
Figures 2A–2D). Conversely, when light stimulation was pre-
ceded within 10 ms by a single postsynaptic spike, significant
timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) was induced
(48% ± 11%, n = 5 versus 98% ± 6%, n = 13; two-sample
Student’s t test p = 0.0012; Figures 2A–2D). Thus, spike pairing
during Down states induces conventional STDP in vivo, vali-
dating previous ex vivo results. However, neurons rarely spike
during Down states (Figure 1C) implying that pairings of single
pre- and postsynaptic spikes would not naturally occur during
these periods. Thus, we next asked whether the same plasticity
rules apply during Up states.
Synaptic Depression during Up States
In order to investigate how Up states influence synaptic plas-
ticity, we first modified the closed-loop procedure to stimulate
L4 afferents only during Up states in the plasticity protocol
(100 repetitions at <0.2 Hz, protocol 3 in Figure 1F; fewer
than 10% of stimulations occurred during activated states
lasting >5 s, which might correspond to REM-like episodes,
Figure S2). Surprisingly, we observed significant synaptic
depression (63% ± 6%, n = 10, one-sample Student’s t test
p = 0.0002; Figure 3A), which was confirmed in Scnn1a-cre/
Ai32 mice expressing ChR2 only in excitatory L4 neurons
(51% ± 8%, n = 6, one-sample Student’s t test p = 0.001;
Figure S3).
Both experiments and computational models suggest that
the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron can modify
STDP induction (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m et al., 2004; Clopath and Gerstner,
2010; Clopath et al., 2010). To test whether pairing of presyn-
aptic spiking and subthreshold depolarization of L2/3 neurons
was sufficient to induce synaptic plasticity, we paired presyn-
aptic stimulation during Down state with a 500 ms positive cur-
rent step, starting 250 ms before L4 stimulation (protocol 4 in
Figure 1F), yielding a somatic depolarization equivalent to the
mean potential during Up states for that neuron. This protocol
did not induce plasticity (103% ± 13%, n = 6, one-sample Stu-
dent’s t test p = 0.83; Figure 3B). Conversely, pairing L4 stim-
ulation during Up states with hyperpolarization to Down state
level (protocol 5 in Figure 1F) did not prevent the induction
of LTD (48% ± 8%, n = 6, one-sample Student’s t test
p = 0.0011; Figure 3B), suggesting that postsynaptic mem-
brane voltage does not control Up state-associated synaptic
depression.
Presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activa-
tion is required for the induction of t-LTD at L4-L2/3 synapses
of the barrel cortex (Bender et al., 2006; Rodrı
´guez-Moreno
and Paulsen, 2008). To investigate whether NMDARs are
necessary also for in vivo Up state-associated LTD, we applied
the
NMDAR
antagonist
2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate
(AP5; 0.2 mM) to the surface of the cortex. AP5 blocked
depression (92% ± 5%, n = 7, one-sample Student’s t test
p = 0.17; Figure 3C). Equivalent results were obtained with
extracellular
application
of
the
NMDAR
channel
blocker
MK801 (30 mM) (91% ± 4%, n = 7, one-sample Student’s
t test p = 0.09; Figure 3C). However, MK801 loaded in
the postsynaptic cell did not prevent Up state-mediated
(F) Diagram of the experimental design. EPSPs were monitored for 10 min using a 2-ms light pulse only during Down states (<0.1 Hz). Subsequently, one of eight
protocols was applied (100 repetitions at <0.2 Hz): light stimulation at Down states only (control); light-stimulation at Down states followed (1) or preceded (2) by
postsynaptic spike; light pulse during Up states only (3); light pulse during Down states paired with postsynaptic depolarization (4); light pulse during Up states
paired with postsynaptic hyperpolarization (5); and presynaptic light stimulation during Up states followed (6) or preceded (7) by a postsynaptic spike. Following
the plasticity protocol, EPSP was monitored by light stimulation during Down states (<0.1 Hz) for 20 to 30 min.

 depression (44% ± 11%, n = 6, one-sample Student’s t test
p = 0.0033; Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that
non-postsynaptic ionotropic NMDARs are required for Up
state-associated LTD and that plasticity rules distinct from
conventional STDP operate during Up states.
To test whether postsynaptic spikes following presynaptic
activity during Up states (protocol 6 in Figure 1F) induces poten-
tiation, as seen during Down states, we elicited a single spike in
the postsynaptic L2/3 neuron 10 ms after presynaptic L4 light-
stimulation during Up states. While no significant potentiation
was observed, synapses were protected from depression
(100% ± 9%, n = 7, one-sample Student’s t test p = 0. 87; Fig-
ure 3E). This protection was not effective when a postsynaptic
spike was evoked 50 ms following presynaptic stimulation
(53% ± 8%, n = 5, one-sample Student’s t test p = 0.0038; Fig-
ure 3E) or 10 ms prior to L4 stimulation during Up states
(66% ± 7%, n = 7, one sample Student’s t test p = 0.0041; Fig-
ure 3E), indicating a relatively narrow time window for protection
against depression (Figure 3F).
Up State-Mediated Depression Could Explain Input-
Specific Downscaling during SWS
The Up state-specific synaptic plasticity rule uncovered here
would be consistent with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis,
which implies that synapses are selectively downscaled during
SWS. However, in contrast to a global rescaling mechanism
(Turrigiano et al., 1998), the rule uncovered here requires presyn-
aptic activity during Up states. To test the implications of this
plasticity rule, we developed a network model of 100 indepen-
dently driven leaky integrate-and-fire presynaptic L4 neurons,
projecting onto a single postsynaptic L2/3 neuron (Figure 4A).
Synaptic weights were initially set at comparable values
(0.2 ± 0.02, Figures 4B and 4C). To model synaptic weight
changes during wake and successive sleep, we divided the
simulation into two phases: ‘‘wake’’ and ‘‘sleep.’’ To create a
wake representation in L4-L2/3 connections (‘‘sensory experi-
ence’’), during the first half of the simulation, 5 of the L4 neurons
received a 50% stronger external drive, and synaptic weights
were updated according a conventional STDP rule (Figure 4B).
This resulted in an overall potentiation of synaptic weights with
stronger potentiation of connections from L4 neurons that
received stronger input, due to the boosted coincidence of
pre-postsynaptic pairings (Figure 4C), and in an increase in
S/N (from 1.1 to 2.5, Figure 4D). To mimic synaptic weight
changes during SWS in the subsequent sleep simulation, all L4
neurons received a comparable input drive and synaptic weights
were updated with the Up state-specific synaptic plasticity rule
uncovered here, such that L4 spikes alone led to depression un-
less followed within 10 ms by a L2/3 spike (Figure 4B). This SWS-
like period resulted in the preservation of the highest synaptic
weights, corresponding to the representation created during
‘‘wake,’’ the depression of all other synaptic weights (Figure 4C),
and a further increase in S/N (to 11.2, Figure 4D). The depression
or maintenance of synaptic weights was independent of the syn-
aptic plasticity rules during ‘‘wake’’ and only depended on the
synaptic weights before ‘‘sleep’’ and the consequential probabil-
ity of L4-L2/3 coincidence, which correlated to their firing rates
(Figure S4).
To test the impact of the initial synaptic weight on the amount
of synaptic weakening endured during SWS in our model, the
initial synaptic weights were first set between 0.1 and 1 and
the ‘‘sleep’’ simulation was run. Weak synapses were strongly
depressed
while
stronger
synapses
remained
unchanged
(Figure 4E), consistent with theoretical predictions (Hashmi
et al., 2013; Nere et al., 2013) and ultrastructural data (de Vivo
et al., 2017).
Intuitively, the requirement of input activity for synaptic depres-
sion, combined with the protection against depression by post-
synaptic spikes, would preserve previously stored synaptic
representations despite presentation of new input patterns.
Thus, we tested whether the new learning rule would retain previ-
ously stored input patterns while increasing the S/N for a new set

 of inputs by repeating the ‘‘wake’’ and ‘‘sleep’’ phases over
5 days. A first set of inputs was strengthened at day 0 (pattern 1,
Figure 4F). During the following ‘‘sleep’’ phase, all weights were
updated either according the Up state-specific plasticity rule or
an homogeneous global downscaling rule. As expected, the
S/N increased and the amplitude of the pattern was conserved
only following Up state-specific plasticity (Figure 4F). At day 1,
a different set of inputs was strengthened (pattern 2). We
observed that both patterns were preserved with increased S/N
even after several subsequent wake/sleep cycles. In contrast,
both S/N and pattern amplitude gradually decayed when a global
scaling rule was used (Figure 4F). Thus, compared to global
downscaling, this new plasticity rule promotes an increase in
S/N and the retention of previously stored input patterns.

 DISCUSSION
Our study shows that cortical network activity influences synap-
tic plasticity rules. Specifically, conventional STDP applies dur-
ing slow-wave-sleep-like activity in vivo only during Down states.
Synaptic stimulation during Up states invariably led to NMDAR-
dependent synaptic depression unless the postsynaptic neuron
spiked within a narrow time window following presynaptic
stimulation, which protected against synaptic weakening. Incor-
porated into a computational network model, two important
advantages of this new plasticity rule compared to conventional
global rescaling were demonstrated: (1) improved S/N and (2)
preservation of previously stored input patterns.
The induction of STDP during Down states is consistent with a
huge body of experimental work in brain slices (e.g., Feldman,
2000; Rodrı
´guez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008). However, the
physiological relevance of such STDP could be questioned,
since cortical networks are relatively quiescent during Down
states. Fewer and divergent studies have investigated synaptic
plasticity following the pairing of presynaptic inputs and sponta-
neous or electrically evoked persistent activity in acute brain
slices (Kruskal et al., 2013; Bartram et al., 2017), highlighting
the importance of studying synaptic plasticity during activated
states in vivo. During in vivo Up states, when spikes are more
likely to occur, presynaptic-postsynaptic spike correlations
were not required for synaptic plasticity, as subthreshold synap-
tic input was sufficient to induce NMDAR-dependent LTD. This
may be a prominent form of plasticity in vivo owing to the low
firing rate in L2/3 (Figure S2). LTD independent of postsynaptic
spikes has previously been reported in slice preparations from
neocortex, when presynaptic stimulation was paired with sub-
threshold postsynaptic depolarization (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m et al., 2004),
and even without any postsynaptic activity (Rodrı
´guez-Moreno
et al., 2013). Although our evidence suggests that postsynaptic
depolarization is not required for Up state-associated LTD in vivo,
we cannot exclude the possibility that local dendritic depolariza-
tion during Up states might be involved. Alternatively, the condi-
tions for activation of presynaptic NMDARs might be met during
Up state activity without the need for postsynaptic activity (Ro-
drı
´guez-Moreno et al., 2013).
Our results highlight the importance of network activity in
gating synaptic plasticity and indicate a bias toward synaptic
depression during cortical slow oscillations. The plasticity rule
uncovered here provides a mechanism by which connections
that are strengthened during wake would be protected from
depression, rather than further strengthened. This could be
especially important during development as studied here,
when neuronal connections are expected to depress (Feldman,
2000; Itami and Kimura, 2012; Banerjee et al., 2014). Interest-
ingly, however, Up state-associated synaptic depression was
also seen in adult mice (P30–P50, 71% ± 9%, n = 8 versus con-
trol 99% ± 9%, n = 6; Figure S3), suggesting that this form of
plasticity could also contribute to circuit reshaping in mature
cortex.
Network activity under urethane anesthesia resembles that
during natural sleep (Contreras and Steriade, 1997; Clement
et al., 2008). To what extent changes in neuromodulators are
preserved during urethane anesthesia is not well studied; how-
ever, it has been reported that cholinergic modulation is compa-
rable between urethane anesthesia sleep-like transitions and
natural sleep (Steriade et al., 1993; Manns et al., 2000). Never-
theless, we cannot exclude the possibility that neuromodulatory
systems are differentially regulated and it will be important to
confirm our findings during natural sleep in future experiments.
Although the vast majority of stimulations in the Up state plas-
ticity protocols happened during SWS-associated Up states of
short duration, a few stimulations occurred during REM-sleep-
like episodes, and, although we find it unlikely, we cannot rule
out that stimulations during REM-like episodes could have a
disproportionate effect on synaptic weights. Still, our results
offer a possible mechanism for the finding that sleep favors syn-
aptic depression.
The Up state-associated plasticity studied here only takes
account of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Intuitively, if spiking
activity was the only determinant of plasticity, the higher firing
rate of L4 neurons compared to that of L2/3 neurons (Figure S2)
would promote depression on its own. However, other mecha-
nisms, such as subthreshold input cooperation within dendritic
segments (Golding et al., 2002; Losonczy et al., 2008; Lee
et al., 2016) could also promote the protection of synaptic con-
nections even in the absence of postsynaptic spikes. Similarly,
mechanisms other than those uncovered here could allow for
the depression of highly efficacious synapses that would other-
wise be permanently protected.
In our computational model, the Up state-associated synaptic
plasticity rule effectively refined a previously acquired represen-
tation via the selective downscaling of synapses with lower
synaptic weights, which is attractive as a mechanism for activ-
ity-dependent synaptic downscaling during sleep. Our data
could explain how the occurrence of UDS during SWS induces
selective downscaling of synaptic weights in an NMDAR-depen-
dent manner without the need for any additional external input.
The protection against depression by postsynaptic spikes sug-
gests a mechanism by which spiking Hebbian assemblies main-
tain their synaptic weights (‘‘neurons that fire together wire
together’’), while non-participating connections are depressed.
This would also result in the sparsification of neuronal activity,
which is seen during critical periods of development (van der
Bourg et al., 2017). This mechanism also allows consolidation
of new neuronal representations while conserving previously
stored ones. In conclusion, we suggest that Up state-associated
synaptic depression is a strong candidate for a mechanism to
contribute to activity-dependent synaptic downscaling dur-
ing SWS.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Tg(Six3-Cre)69Frty/GcoJ (Six3-cre) mice were crossed with B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG–COP4*H134R/eYFP)Hze/J mice
(Ai32; Jackson Laboratory, Maine, USA) in order to express ChR2(H134R)-YFP in L4 neurons of the somatosensory cortex (Furuta
et al., 2000). For a subset of experiments Ai32 mice were crossed with B6;C3-Tg(Scnn1a-cre)3Aibs/J (Scnn1a-Cre; Jackson Labo-
ratory, Maine, USA). Unless otherwise stated, only Six3-cre/Ai32 mice ranging from P15 to P21 were used for experiments. Both
males and females were used for experiments. Animals were housed on a 12-hr light/dark cycle and the mother was fed ad libitum.
The research was performed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical re-
view by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB).
METHOD DETAILS
Surgery
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1 g per kg of body weight). Upon cessation of reflexes, the top of
the head of the animal was shaved and the skin covering the right hemisphere was removed. A blue LED light was used to identify and
mark over the skull the YFP-fluorescent barrel field. A head-restraining platform was cemented (Super-Bond C & B; Prestige Dental,
Bradford, UK) to the skull around the mark indicating the barrel cortex location. The animal was placed on the recording frame over a
low-noise heating pad (FHC, Termobit Prod. srl., Bucharest, Romania) to aid body temperature maintenance. A 200-500 mm crani-
otomy was performed at the marked spot and the dura mater was carefully removed from a small area of the craniotomy (20-100 mm).
Care was taken to avoid bleeding or drying of the meninges and brain tissue. Saline (0.9% NaCl) was superfused constantly with a
2 mL/minute laminar flow using a peristaltic pump.

 Electrophysiology
Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from L2/3 neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex of urethane-anesthe-
tized mice using 6-9 MU pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1B120F-4, World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK).
Pipettes were filled with artificial intracellular solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 150, HEPES 10, NaCl 4, ATP-Mg 4, GTP-Na 0.3
and EGTA 0.2; adjusted to pH 7.2 and osmolarity 270-290 mOsm/L. Data were recorded using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA). Signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kH and acquired at 5 kHz using a data interface ITC-18
AD board (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY, USA) on a PC running Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). A reference silver
pellet electrode (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA) was placed in the saline bath covering the craniotomy. The recording pipette
was controlled using a micromanipulator at a 50� inclination. High positive pressure (>500 mbar) was applied and the pipette was
lowered to the surface of the brain. A 5-ms-long square pulse of voltage of 4 to 8 mV at 100 Hz was delivered via the recording elec-
trode. The pipette was quickly advanced 100 mm to L2 of the barrel cortex. The pressure was lowered to 60 mbar and the pipette was
advanced in 2 mm steps. Cell contact produced a small reduction (around 10%) in resistance of the pipette, which could be seen as a
proportional decrease in the size of the step of current in the oscilloscope. Cell contact also produced a pulsation artifact or flickering
in the positive values of the current recorded. If no cell contact was detected after 250 steps of 2 mm, the pipette was retracted and a
new pipette was used to record a new cell. Recordings were discarded if the access resistance was >25 MU or changed >10% along
the recording. For a subset of experiments, single unit recordings of L2/3 and L4 neurons were done using 3-4 MU tungsten elec-
trodes (Microelectrodes, Cambridge, UK) paired with 1 MU tungsten electrodes for L2/3 LFP recording.
Thalamocortical slices
Thalamocortical slices of 350 mm thickness containing the barrel subfield of somatosensory cortex were prepared as previously
described (Rodrı
´guez-Moreno et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2014) Briefly, mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and
the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with the following composition
(in mM): NaCl 126, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgSO4 2, CaCl2 2, NaHCO3 26, glucose 10, pH 7.2-7.4; bubbled with carbogen gas
(95% O2/5% CO2) and with an osmolarity adjusted to 280-300 mOsm/L. The brain was placed on a 10� ramp rostral side down
and a vertical cut was made through the tissue at an angle of 55� to the anteroposterior axis of the brain. Slices from the right so-
matosensory cortex were cut using a vibratome (VT 1200S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and maintained in a submerged-style chamber
at room temperature until used. The flow rate of aCSF in the recording chamber was 2 mL/min.
Optogenetics and plasticity experiments
L4 neurons were excited using a 470 nm fiber-coupled LED system (150 mm, Thorlabs, Ely, UK). The LED fiber was positioned cen-
trally above the recorded cell on top of the dura mater. Light intensity was adjusted to produce 3-6 mV EPSPs at Down states. The
average membrane potential during Down states and Up states was measured over 10 s prior to the start of the plasticity protocol.
The average membrane potential at Down states plus 0.5 mV was used as the Down state threshold, whereas the average membrane
potential at Up states minus 0.5 mV was used as threshold for Up states. In order to trigger a light-pulse only at Down states and at
<0.1 Hz, the membrane potential was scanned in 10-ms time bins using a closed-loop. When the membrane potential crossed the
threshold for Down states a 10 s recording was triggered and a 2-ms light-pulse was delivered 10 ms into the recording. At the end of
the 10 s-recording the closed-loop scanning was resumed in order to detect the next Down state. Each light stimulus was time
stamped in order to obtain minute-averages of the EPSP slope. Following a 10-minute baseline recording, a plasticity protocol
was applied at <0.2 Hz for 100 repeats. Following the plasticity protocol, the stimulus during Down states were resumed in order
to assess changes in the EPSP slope.
For the experiments performed in acute brain slices, a monopolar stainless steel stimulation electrode was used to elicit EPSPs in
L2/3 as control. Electrical stimulation was delivered with 2 s delay from the light-pulse.
Pharmacology
In a subset of experiments, NMDA receptors were blocked by epidural administration of 0.2 mM AP5 or 30 mM MK801 (Tocris Biosci-
ence, Bristol, UK) via the superfusate, as previously described (Rema et al., 1998). In order to determine the reversal potential of the
inhibitory component of ChR2 stimulation, 0.2 mM AP5 and 20 mM DNQX (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were added to the
superfusate.
Immunohistochemistry
Images from the barrel cortex of Six3-Cre/Ai32 mice and Scnn1a-Cre/Ai32 were taken to assess the level and location of ChR2
expression. Moreover, post hoc reconstruction of a subset of the neurons recorded in vivo was possible after biocytin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) staining. Biocytin was diluted at 5 mg/mL in the internal solution used for whole-cell recordings. At the end of the record-
ings, the brain was cut in 200 mm thalamocortical slices as previously described. Slices containing the barrel cortex were washed
once in PBS and were left overnight in fixing solution containing 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS at 4�C. Slices were incubated in Alexa 633
Fluor-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK)
overnight at 4�C. Before mounting, slices were incubated for 2 min in DAPI in PBS. Images were taken with a confocal microscope
(SP8, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and a 25X and a 40X objective and color intensity was adjusted using ImageJ.

 Analysis of synaptic plasticity
To assess plasticity, EPSP slopes were used as a measure of synaptic strength. Slope measurements were made on the rising phase
of the EPSP as a linear fit between time points corresponding to 25%–30% and 70%–75% of peak amplitude of the EPSP, or of the
first slope in the case of polysynaptic EPSPs. EPSP slopes were averaged over 1-minute time bins. The change in EPSP slope after
the plasticity protocol was expressed relative to EPSP slopes during the baseline recording. EPSP slopes were averaged over the last
5 min of the initial baseline and the last 5 min of recording, generally corresponding to min 25-30 after the plasticity induction protocol.
For offline UDS analysis, the membrane potential noise level was used as previously described (Craig et al., 2013).
Computational model
We simulated a feedforward network composed of 100 presynaptic neurons projecting onto one postsynaptic neuron. We used the
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. In this model, the membrane potential of a neuron is described by
tm
du
dt = � ðu � urestÞ + RIðtÞ;
where urest denotes the membrane voltage at rest, R denotes the membrane resistance, IðtÞ denotes the external current and tm de-
notes the membrane time constant. If the membrane potential reaches a threshold uth at time tðfÞ, the membrane potential is reset
to ureset and we call tðfÞ the firing time. After being reset, the membrane potential follows the same equation again.
The term IðtÞ takes into account all of the current being injected into a neuron; these can be from an external source or from other
neurons. When a neuron fires it propagates a current to all other connected neurons. In order to model this current, we assumed that
the conductance between a presynaptic neuron j and a postsynaptic neuron i increases instantaneously every time the presynaptic
neuron fires, and decays exponentially otherwise:
gj
/gj + 1
if j fires and
dgj
dt
= � gj

otherwise;
where tsyn is the synaptic time constant. The synaptic current was then calculated through
IsynðtÞ = � wijgjðu � EsynÞ;
where wij is the synaptic weight from neuron j to neuron i and Esyn is the synaptic reversal potential.
Each presynaptic neuron received an independent external current whose amplitude varied in time and was determined by a
filtered Gaussian noise, with filtering time constant 20 ms. The postsynaptic neuron also received a constant external current.
For the wake phases of the simulations, the synaptic weights were updated by the conventional STDP rule, in which pre-post
events lead to potentiation and post-pre events lead to depression. In order to implement this rule, we defined a presynaptic
trace xj (for each presynaptic neuron j) and a postsynaptic trace y that was incremented by 1 for each pre or postsynaptic spike,
respectively, and decayed otherwise:
xj/xj + 1
if presynaptic neuron j fires and
t +
dxj
dt = � xj
otherwise;
and
y/y + 1
if the postsynaptic neuron fires and
t�
dy
dt = � yi
otherwise;
where t� is the depression time constant and t + the potentiation time constant.
The synaptic weight wj was then updated by the following:
wjðtÞ/wjðtÞ � A�yðtÞ
if t = tpre;
wjðtÞ/wjðtÞ + A + xjðtÞ
if t = tpost:
where A� is the depression amplitude and A + is the potentiation amplitude. Synaptic weights were also bounded between
0 and 1: 0 < w < 1.
During the sleep phases of our simulations, the synaptic weights were updated following either an Up state-mediated plasticity or
an homogeneous synaptic scaling. For the Up state-mediated plasticity, synaptic weights were updated such that presynaptic spikes
alone led to depression whereas presynaptic spikes followed within 10 ms by a postsynaptic action potential led to no change.
In order to implement this rule, we defined a presynaptic trace xj (for each presynaptic neuron j) that was reset to 10 for every pre-
synaptic spike and decayed linearly otherwise obeying

if presynaptic neuron j fires and
t dxj
dt = � 1
otherwise;
where t = 1 ms. The synaptic weight wj was then updated by the following:
wjðtÞ/wjðtÞ � A
if t = tpre;
wjðtÞ/wjðtÞ + AHðxjðtÞÞ
if t = tpost:
where A is the depression amplitude and HðxÞ is the Heaviside step function defined by HðxÞ = 1 if x > 0 and HðxÞ = 0 if x < 0. Therefore,
a presynaptic spike leads to depression with amplitude A and a postsynaptic spike within 10 ms of the presynaptic spike protects
against this depression (increases the synaptic weight be the same amount AÞ: Synaptic weights were also bounded between
0 and 1: 0 < w < 1.
The homogeneous synaptic scaling was implemented by downscaling all synaptic weights by the same amount. The weights were
downscaled such that they would be reduced by 33% at the end of each sleep phase.
Signal/noise analysis
The S/N was measured as the mean amplitude of the synaptic weights from the neurons relative to a specific pattern divided by the
average of all synaptic weights.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The number of experimental recordings (‘‘n’’) and the number of animals (‘‘N’’) are indicated in the figure legends. When the ‘‘n’’ num-
ber per experimental condition was too low to assess the type of distribution, the data were assumed normal and a two-tailed one
sample Student’s t test was used to assess long-term plasticity. In order to compare the magnitude of plasticity to a control condition

Dunnett’s test was performed.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
A Python code with our simulations will be submitted to ModelDB. We developed this code to simulate a feedforward network of
excitatory neurons undergoing Up state-mediated plasticity. In our implementation of Up state-mediated plasticity, presynaptic
spikes alone led to synaptic depression whereas pre- followed by postsynaptic spikes within 10 ms led to no change in synaptic
weight. The simulations were used to confirm our intuition that the Up state-mediated plasticity leads to the refinement and protection
of previously stored memories in a simulated neuronal network.
