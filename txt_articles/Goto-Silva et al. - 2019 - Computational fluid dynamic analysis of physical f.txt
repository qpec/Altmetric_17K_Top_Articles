Abstract
Background: Organoid cultivation in suspension culture requires agitation at low shear stress to allow for nutrient
diffusion, which preserves tissue structure. Multiplex systems for organoid cultivation have been proposed, but
whether they meet similar shear stress parameters as the regularly used spinner flask and its correlation with the
successful generation of brain organoids has not been determined.
Results: Here we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate two multiplex culture conditions: steering
plates on an orbital shaker and the use of a previously described bioreactor. The bioreactor had low speed and
high shear stress regions that may affect cell aggregate growth, depending on volume, whereas the computed
variables of the steering plates were closer to those of the spinning flask.
Conclusion: Our protocol improves the initial steps of the standard brain organoid formation, and the produced
organoids displayed regionalized brain structures, including retinal pigmented cells. Overall, we conclude that
suspension culture on orbital steering plates is a cost-effective practical alternative to previously described platforms
for the cultivation of brain organoids for research and multiplex testing.
Background
Three-dimensional (3D) cerebral organoids generated
from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are complex
structures that partly reproduce fetal brain development
in vitro, making them powerful tools for the study of hu-
man development and disease [1]. The self-organization
that occurs during hPSC differentiation in cerebral orga-
noids allows for the appearance of complex structures,
including those recapitulating regions of the cerebral
cortex, ventral forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, hippo-
campus, and retina [2–4]. Several research groups have
used this model to study the development of diseases
such as microcephaly, lissencephaly [5, 6], and Zika in-
fection [7], as well as for drug testing [8].
Organoids are grown in 3D suspension culture, which
enables efficient nutrient delivery to 3D organized tissue.
Historically, cerebral organoids have been cultured in
spinner flasks [9]. These flasks have the advantage of
providing a low-shear environment [10], which is im-
portant because hPSCs have been shown to be sensitive
to shear stress [10, 11]. However, spinner flasks have the
disadvantage of requiring a high volume of cell culture
media for cultivation, increasing the costs of experi-
ments. Thus, they are limited to drug testing and other
multiplex experiments including comparison of multiple
patients and controls. Recently, Qian et al. (2016) [12]
proposed the use of a 3D-printed scalable mini-biore
actor, the SpinΩ, which would be cost effective and

 provide a feasible, reproducible platform for chemical
compound testing. However, cultivation in the SpinΩ
still requires, the availability of 3D-printing equipment
and other materials, which might make it infeasible for
most laboratories.
The use of orbital shaker plates described originally [9]
is a multiplex alternative to the often cost-prohibitive
use of spinner flasks. However, whether the SpinΩ and
orbital shaker plates provide the particle floating and nu-
trient mixing in a low-shear environment required to
support organoid growth has not been addressed.
Here, we applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations to compute shear stress and fluid flow fields
in orbital shaker plates and the SpinΩ. Additionally, we
developed an improved protocol to support the initial
steps of organoid development (static phase), including
embryoid body (EB) formation and compared suspen-
sion cultures in the SpinΩ bioreactor and orbital shaker
plates [9], in the initial 30-day cultivation period.
Results
Improved embryoid body (EB) formation and analysis of
organoid growth
To improve the first step of EB formation, we introduced
some variations to the protocol published by Lancaster
and Knoblich (2014) [9]. The experimental flow is
depicted in Fig. 1a. Changes in the protocol include the
addition of Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (RO
CKi) for cell survival at cell dissociation [13] and post-
plating centrifugation [14]. iPSCs cultivated in mTeSR1
medium derived from manual passages showed better EB
formation compared with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA)-passaged iPSCs (data not shown). Therefore, the
cells were passaged manually before the EB formation
step. Immediately after treatment for cell dissociation and
before centrifugation, 10 μM ROCKi was added to the trit-
uration solution. This step improved cell morphology after
dissociation (Additional file 1: Figure S1a and b) [13]. The
centrifugation step significantly improved the circularity
of organoids on day 1 of growth (Additional file 1: Figure
S1e), which was correlated with a significant increase in
the observed areas of organoids in the two conditions
(Additional file 1: Figure S1f). However, after 10 days, no
significant difference was seen between specimens treated
with and without centrifugation (Additional file 1: Figure
S1 f), suggesting that this potentially negative effect was
temporary. During the EB stage, no significant growth was
observed (Fig.1a, b) and the morphology of aggregates did
not change (Fig. 1b). Growth during the neuroinduction
stage also was not significant (Fig. 1a, b). In the neuroin-
duction stage, protrusions of developing organoids started
to expand; these continued to grow over time (Fig. 1b)
and formed neuroepithelium-like tissue (see also Fig. 3b).
The pattern of organoid growth resembled an exponential
curve (Fig. 1c), with R square values of 0.9811 for the
SpinΩ and 0.8587 for the orbital shaker. Growth in the or-
bital shaker was initially more rapid than that in the
SpinΩ (Fig. 1d), but no significant difference was observed
at the 30-day time point. A histogram analysis of orga-
noids grown in the SpinΩ and the orbital shaker at 30
days showed that the size distribution of organoids grown
on the shaker more closely resembled a Gaussian fit (Fig.
1e), suggesting more homogeneity in the shaker.
The orbital shaker delivered higher velocity fields, but
less shear stress, than the SpinΩ
Fluid dynamics in cultivation vessels has been shown to
influence cell stemness, differentiation, and growth (for
a review, see [15]). Here, we describe the fluid dynamic
conditions to which organoids were subjected. In the
plates on the orbital shaker, although some regions of
the well were depleted of fluid at 0.5 s, just after the start
of the plate movement, the fluid eventually covered the
whole bottom surface of the well as the flow developed
for the quasi-steady-state regime. The velocities were
symmetrical at 14 and 15 s, due to the periodic flow cre-
ated by the circular movement of the shaker (Additional
file 2: Figure S2). Figure 2a presents the absolute velocity
fields for the well on the orbital shaker at 15 s after the
initiation of plate movement. The maximum absolute
velocity reached with the stirrer plate during the quasi-
steady-state regime was about 0.12 m/s. The shear stress
field at 15 s is shown in Fig. 2b. The maximum stress
was about 0.045 Pa in the regions of maximum-velocity
gradients near the walls (see also Fig. 2a). The magni-
tude of the shear stress was about 10− 2 Pa in a large re-
gion of the fluid (Fig. 2)a.
The SpinΩ analysis is presented for different plane
cuts. The velocity and shear stress fields are presented in
Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The highest velocities oc-
curred at the edge of the impeller, with values around
0.05 m/s (Fig. 2a). The velocities decreased with distance
from the impeller and rotating shaft, being null at the
well walls due to the no-slip conditions. In particular,
lower velocities at the bottom of the well did not favor
the mixture required for the enhanced growth of orga-
noids. Our attempts to form aggregates from single cells
in the SpinΩ created bodies with disparate sizes. Single
cells accumulated in the low-speed area of the bioreactor
and formed a large aggregate, while adjacent cells
formed smaller bodies (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
Large differences in the velocity fields could imply differ-
ences in nutrient mixing, which could in part explain
the delayed growth in the SpinΩ on days 17–19 (Fig. 1d)
and the wide area distribution shown on the histogram
at day 30 for SpinΩ (Fig. 1e).
The maximum shear stress was 0.56 Pa at the edge of
the impeller due to the large velocity gradients in this

 region (Fig. 2b). Shear stress in the bulk fluid was
smaller, with magnitudes on the order of 10− 3 to 10− 2
Pa.
Velocity gradients and shear stress are correlated
parameters. In this study, however, the absolute vel-
ocity magnitudes were larger for the orbital shaker
than for the SpinΩ, whereas shear stress values had
the opposite pattern. These results can be explained
by the large differences in velocity values at the re-
gion around the SpinΩ impeller and the rotating
shaft increasing the shear of fluid in this area.
The gold standard for organoid protocols, a spin-
ning bioreactor, has been reported to sustain organoid
growth in culture for more than 8 months [2, 9].
Comparison with previous literature on the CFD of a
spinning bioreactor [10] showed that shear stresses of
the steering plates found by us are of the same order
of magnitude as those reported for the spinner bio-
reactor [10]. Maximum shear stress values for the
spinner were 0.028 Pa at 40 rpm and 0.047 Pa at 75
rpm [10] (Additional file 4: Table S2), and a max-
imum value of 0.045 Pa at 90 rpm was predicted for
the orbital shaker (Additional file 4: Table S2). The
maximum shear stress of the SpinΩ (0.56 Pa) was one
order of magnitude greater.
The velocity fields of the steering plates (maximum,
0.12 m/s) were of the same order of magnitude as those of
the spinner bioreactor (maximum, 0.277 m/s), whereas
those of the SpinΩ were lower (0.05 m/s) (Additional file
4: Table S2).

 Computational simulations suggest that the use of the
stirrer plate was more suitable for the growth of orga-
noids than was the use of the bioreactor. First, the
SpinΩ has regions of low velocity at the bottom of the
well, where fluid mixing is poor and particles deposition
is likely to happen. Second, shear stresses are smaller in
the orbital shaker, which could be better for the preser-
vation of organoid structures in long-term culture.
The SpinΩ reactor and orbital shaker derived structured
organoids
We examined the maturation of organoids with a focus
on the transition from predominantly neuroprogenitor
stem cells to the development of neuroepithelial regions.
Nestin staining of neural stem cells, performed at 10, 14,
and 30 days of culture, showed similar decreases over
time for the orbital shaker and SpinΩ treatments (Fig.
3a). These results are consistent with the start of differ-
entiation of progenitor cells into neurons. At 30 days,
the organoids had developed ventricular-like regions and
neuroepithelium-like structures that were positive for
MAP2 and TBR2 (Fig. 3b). MAP2 staining levels were
similar in organoids cultivated in the orbital shaker and
SpinΩ, but TBR2 staining levels were significantly stron-
ger than those cultivated in the SpinΩ. As TBR2 labeled
neuron progenitors in sub-ventricular zones, we exam-
ined whether cell proliferation was increased under our
culture conditions through phospho-histone-3 staining
on day 30. However, no difference in the number of pro-
liferating cells was detected between the two conditions
(Fig. 3c).
Organoids generated in suspension cultures presented
markers for distinct brain regions
Organoids grown in the SpinΩ and orbital shaker dis-
played very similar morphology and developmental pro-
file. We decided to focus on organoids grown on the
orbital plates to provide further characterization of the
organoid generation pipeline, because the organoids
grown in SpinΩ have been described elsewhere [12]. We

 observed that 30-day organoids from orbital shaker cul-
tures were positive for FOXG-1 (forebrain), PAX-6 (dor-
sal telencephalon), OTX-2 (retinal cells and midbrain),
and Islet-1 (hindbrain; Fig. 4a) showing diversification
and development consistent with previous reports [2].
We observed that, at 45 days, the organoids had pigmen-
ted regions (Fig. 4b, c), which were previously described
to reproduce the formation of retinal pigmented epithe-
lium [2]. The pigmented regions were positive for the
retinal cell marker glycogen synthetase (GS) (Fig. 4c).
Proteomic analysis of organoids grown for 30 days led to
the identification of 4099 proteins (Additional file 5: data-
set). The 100 most abundant proteins (ordered by peptide
spectral match) were analyzed by gene enrichment; 86
matched DAVID IDs [16, 17]. Gene enrichment analysis
revealed that the majority (76.6%) of the identified pro-
teins matched brain entries with the high p-value. Proteins
identified in our analysis are markers of the forebrain
(BCL11B, DBI, CLU, SPARC), midbrain (OTX-2), and
hindbrain (HOXA1). Retinal cell proteins were also identi-
fied: a general marker (GS) and those for the Muller glia
(DKK3), photoreceptors (RCVRN), and retinal ganglion
cells (NEFL) (Additional file 5: dataset). The appearance
of these proteins at 30 days preceded the formation of the
pigmented regions which were observed later, at 45 days
(Fig. 4c). Additionally, the synaptic proteins synaptotag-
min, synaptobrevin, synaptojanin, GABA receptor and a
set of voltage-dependent channels were detected in the

tures conditions.
Discussion
Brain organoids present cytoarchitecture that recapitu-
lates brain tissue organization, offering a complex in
vitro model for the study of brain normal and patho-
logical development [5, 18, 19]. Although brain organoid
cultivation presents challenges related to the lack of re-
producibility and scalability, we achieved high reproduci-
bility of early-stage organoid size and growth by adding
steps to a standard protocol [9]. This included the use of
higher concentrations of ROCKi and plate centrifugation
in the EB formation step, which have been previously
demonstrated to improve EB formation but have never
been applied to grow organoids [13, 14].
Scalability was achieved by applying two multiplex
platforms: steering plates on an orbital shaker and the
SpinΩ bioreactor [12]. The SpinΩ was 3D printed ac-
cording to the blueprints provided by Qian et al. [12].
We encountered the following issues with SpinΩ use: 1)
manual handling, as medium changes involved disassem-
bly
of
a
combination
of
pieces;
2)
the
need
for
sterilization for consecutive use; and 3) the maintenance
of sterile conditions, as the equipment has 12 gears that
could not be cleaned properly during the course of the
experiment. These issues make the SpinΩ dependent on
user skills, rendering it more prone to error and suscep-
tible to contamination over the long timeframe of brain
organoid cultivation (up to 8 months) [2, 9], when com-
pared with the use of steering plates on an orbital
shaker.
We suggest that the lower velocities of the SpinΩ,
may affect nutrient mixing, which could explain the de-
creased organoid growth seen on days 17 and 19, and
the wide size distribution of organoids observed on day
30. Overall, our CFD analysis indicated that the fluid dy-
namic variables of the steering plate on the orbital
shaker are closer to those of the spinner bioreactor.
Therefore, this method should be preferentially selected
as a multiplex alternative to the use of a spinner
bioreactor.
The appearance of diverse brain regions and pigmen-
ted regions labeled with the retinal epithelium marker
GS has been previously described [2] and related to a re-
gional differentiation in organoids. Organoids produced
using our protocol presented pigmented regions positive
for GS suggesting that the technique described here may
be appropriate for studies involving the complexity of
early brain development.
In addition, proteomic analysis confirmed the orga-
noids (produced in this study) show a protein profile
that is compatible with several differentiated brain
regions. Altogether, those results corroborate that the
new proposed protocol opens a new window, allowing
the exploration, with multiple analyses, of important bio-
markers of the morphological, genetic and molecular
complexity of the human brain development under nor-
mal and abnormal conditions.
Conclusion
We conclude that the use of an orbital shaker with an
improved organoid preparation protocol successfully
generates brain organoids with significant reliability
across different iPSC lines. Use of CFD analysis indicates
that use of an orbital shaker offers advantages to the
SpinΩ multiplex platform and produces morphological
and molecular complex human brain organoids.
Experimental procedures
Pluripotent stem cell culture
The human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) used
in this work are described in Additional file 4: Table S1.
GM23279 cell line from the NIGMS Human Genetic
Cell Repository was obtained and certified by the Coriell
cell repository; the remaining cell lines were generated
in-house. The iPSCs were maintained in six-well plates
coated with Geltrex in mTeSR® medium (StemCell
Technologies,
Canada).
Cells
were
either
passaged
manually or with 0.15 mM EDTA through passage 48.
Culture of brain organoids
The method used to produce cerebral organoids was
based on a previously published protocol [9]. Briefly,
iPSC colonies grown in six-well plates were dissociated
with 1 ml Accutase Cell Detachment Solution (MPBio,
USA) for 4 min at 37 °C, and 1 ml phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; LGC Biotechnology, USA) was then added.
The resulting solution was transferred to a 15-ml conical
tube, and 20 μl 10 mM Rho-kinase inhibitor (ROCKi,
Y27632; Merck Millipore, USA) was added before centri-
fugation [13], to obtain a final concentration of 10 μM.
Cells were counted in a hemocytometer and centrifuged
at 300×g for 4 min. Cells were plated in hESC medium
containing 50 μM ROCKi and 4 ng/ml b-FGF. hESC
medium contained 20% knockout serum replacement
(Life Technologies), 3% ESC-quality fetal bovine serum
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 1% GlutaMAX (Life
Technologies, Canada), 1% minimum essential medium
non-essential amino acids (MEM-NEAAs; Life Tech-
nologies), 0.7% 2-mercapto-ethanol, and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (P/S; Life Technologies), as described in
Lancaster and Knoblich (2014) [9]. We used 9000 cells/
well of a 96-well plate, which has been demonstrated to
lead to efficient organoid formation under the cultiva-
tion conditions described [20]. The 96-well plates were
Goto-Silva et al. BMC Developmental Biology            (2019) 19:3 
Page 7 of 10
 centrifuged for 1 min at 300×g to improve initial EB ag-
gregation [14] (Additional file 1: Figure S1b).
After day 1, embryoid bodies (EBs) were cultured as
described by Lancaster and Knoblich (2014) [9]. The
medium was changed every 48 h after plating for 6 days.
On day 6, EBs were transferred to 24-well ultralow-at-
tachment culture plates (one/well) containing 0.5 ml
neuroinduction medium [1% N2 supplement (Gibco), 1%
GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 1% MEM-NEAAs, 1%
P/S, and 1 μg/ml heparin in DMEM/F12 (Life Technolo-
gies). After 4 days (day 10), organoids were coated with
Matrigel similarly as described by Sartore et al. (2017)
[21] in a 60-mm non-adherent tissue culture plate; six
organoids were placed in 3 ml diluted Matrigel and incu-
bated for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The coated orga-
noids
were
then
returned
to
the
24-well
ultra-low-attachment plates with 0.5 ml neurodifferentia-
tion medium with no vitamin A (50% neurobasal
medium, 0.5% N2, 1% B27 supplement without vitamin
A, 1:100 2-mercapto-ethanol, 0.5% MEM-NEAA, 1%
GlutaMAX, and 1:100 P/S in DMEM/F12) and left for 4
days in static culture. Subsequently, cerebral organoids
were grown in suspension using two different platforms:
1) steering plates on a standard orbital shaker (six-well
culture plates), agitated at 90 rpm [as proposed by Lan-
caster and Knoblich (2014) [9]]; and 2) SpinΩ system
developed by Qian et al. [12], which was 3D printed by
the company DelthaThinkers using the blueprints pro-
vided in the manuscript and coupled to 12-well culture
plates, agitated at 60 rpm. In both cases, 10 organoids
were placed in 3 ml neurodifferentiation medium with
vitamin A (day 14). The medium was changed weekly
until day 60 of culture. They were imaged with an EVOS
cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in bright-
field. The area, diameter, and circularity of individual
cerebral organoids were quantified using a custom
macro in ImageJ.
Computational fluid dynamics simulation
CFD simulations were performed for the flows imposed
by the SpinΩ impeller and the orbital shaker using the
finite element commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics®
and using the geometry and finite element mesh as de-
scribed on Additional file 6: Figure S4. The methods
used in the analysis are described in the supplementary
information section and in [22].
Histology and immunofluorescence
Cerebral organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
incubated sequentially in sucrose solutions (10, 20, and
30%) prepared in PBS, embedded in optimal cutting
temperature compound, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
The organoids were sectioned (20-μm thickness) with a
cryostat
(Leica
Biosystems,
Germany).
Immunofluo
rescence was performed using the following primary
antibodies: rabbit anti-nestin (RA22125, 1:500; Neuro-
mics, USA), rabbit anti-PAX6 (42–6600, 1:100; Thermo-
fisher
Scientific),
rabbit
anti-TBR2
(AB2283,1:200;
Millipore), mouse anti-MAP2 (M1406, 1:300; Sigma-Al-
drich,
USA),
rabbit
anti-FOXG1
(ab18259,
1:1000;
Abcam,
UK),
rabbit
anti-islet-1
(ab20670;
1:1000;
Abcam), rabbit anti–OTX-2 (ab21990, 1:200; Abcam),
mouse anti-glycogen synthetase (610,518, 1:500; BD),
and rabbit anti-PH3 (06–570, 1:500; Millipore). The fol-
lowing secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti-mouse (A11001, 1:500; Invitrogen, Canada)
and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit (A11010, 1:500;
Invitrogen).
4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(1 mg/ml)
was used for nucleus staining. Images were acquired
using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope.
The specificity of the immunofluorescence staining
was controlled with a negative secondary antibody con-
trol, which consisted in incubating the slices with sec-
ondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody.
Proteomic analysis
Two independent pools of four organoids each were
used in the experiments. Protein digestion, peptide frac-
tionation, mass spectrometric analysis, and raw data pro-
cessing was performed as described by Murillo et al.
(2017) [23]. Gene enrichment analysis was performed
using
the DAVID Bioinformatics
Database (https://
david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp).
Statistical analysis
Statistical testing was performed using two-tailed t-test
with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Statistical significance
was defined as p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated in figure
legends. Correlation analysis was done comparing the R
square of a non-linear fit (Exponential fit in Fig. 1c and
a Gaussian fit in Fig. 1e) for the two conditions, SpinΩ
and orbital shaker.
