& Abstract
Background:
Results from a phase-3, prospective, random-
ized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
trial
evaluating
sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg (SST) for the manage-
ment of pain after ambulatory abdominal surgery are
presented.
Methods:
Adults with American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists status 1 to 3 scheduled to undergo abdominoplasty,
open tension-free inguinal hernioplasty, or laparoscopic
abdominal surgery under general or spinal anesthesia that
did not include intrathecal opioids during the operation
were eligible. Opioid-tolerant patients were excluded. The
primary endpoint was the time-weighted summed pain
intensity difference to baseline (SPID) over 12 hours. Second-
ary endpoints included SPID over 24 and 48 hours, total pain
relief, and patient and healthcare professional (HCP) global
assessments.
Results:
Overall, 161 patients were randomized to SST
(N = 107) or placebo (N = 54); pain scores were recorded
for up to 48 hours. SPID 12 was higher (greater pain
intensity reduction from baseline) in the SST group com-
pared
with
placebo
(25.8
vs.
13.1;
P < 0.001,
with
a
difference of 12.7 [95% confidence interval 7.16, 18.23]).
In
the
SST
group,
a
greater
proportion
of
patients
and HCPs responded “good” or “excellent” on the global
assessments compared with placebo (P < 0.001 for both).
There
was
a
numerically,
but
not
statistically,
higher
incidence of nausea and headache in the SST group.
Conclusions:
In patients following abdominal surgery in
an ambulatory care setting, SST was an effective opioid
analgesic in postoperative pain management. In addition,
SST
was
well
tolerated
with
mild-to-moderate
side
effects,
similar
to
those
found
in
placebo-treated
patients. &

 INTRODUCTION
The quality of postoperative analgesia following surgery
in ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) has a significant
impact on patient satisfaction, timeliness of discharge,
readmission rates, and patient care costs.1–4 A number
of studies have demonstrated the advantages of multi-
modal analgesia in the ASC setting, such as lower
adverse events (AEs) and lower pain intensity scores
both upon admission to the phase-1 unit as well as in the
phase-2 unit and at discharge.5–7 A growing number of
major surgical procedures are being performed in ASCs,
and while effective employment of multimodal analgesia
regimens can decrease the use of opioids, significant
quantities of opioids are still utilized to provide ade-
quate analgesia following these larger, more invasive
surgeries.8–11 However, new advances in postoperative
opioids have been lacking over the past 3 decades and
current opioid analgesics (eg, intravenous [IV] mor-
phine) have limitations.12–18
Disadvantages of IV morphine include a delayed
plasma:central nervous system (CNS) equilibration half-
life (t1/2ke0) of 2.8 hours, delayed effects of the active
metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), which has
an even slower t1/2ke0 of 6.4 hours, and possibly a
higher postoperative nausea and vomiting rate com-
pared with fentanyl in ASCs.19,20 Intravenous hydro-
morphone has a relatively shorter t1/2ke0 of 46 minutes,
but results in a similar side effect profile as IV
morphine,21 with some studies suggesting a higher rate
of postoperative sedation/CNS side effects with hydro-
morphone.22 Intravenous fentanyl, while resulting in a
quick onset of action due to its lipophilic nature
(t1/2ke0 = 6.6 minutes), has demonstrated a limited
duration of analgesia following ambulatory surgery,
resulting in frequent use of supplemental opioids and
increasing pain scores after only 30 minutes.19,23,24 This
prompt offset of analgesia is most likely due to
fentanyl’s rapid alpha distribution half-life of 0.8 to
2 minutes following IV administration.25 The lipophilic
opioids, sufentanil, alfentanil, and remifentanil, can
have an even more abrupt offset of analgesia due to brief
initial distribution phases and/or rapid metabolism
following IV bolus administration, and are therefore
rarely used for postoperative analgesia.26–29
Ideally, a postoperative opioid analgesic would blend
the rapid onset and tolerability of IV lipophilic opioids
with a duration of action that is better suited to ASC
patients (eg, 2 to 3 hours, facilitating pain management
both through recovery period and the transition to the
home setting). A lack of active metabolites and non-
invasive route of administration would confer addi-
tional advantages by reducing the potential for delayed
side effects and allowing adequate analgesia while
discontinuing IV lines in preparation for discharge.
With these goals in mind, a sufentanil sublingual tablet
30 mcg (SST), prepackaged in a single-dose applicator,
has been developed and the results of a phase-3 efficacy
and safety study in patients following ambulatory
abdominal surgery are reported herein. Previous studies
evaluating a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device
containing SST 15 mcg tablets have demonstrated
suitable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action com-
pared with IV morphine PCA, and an average inter-
dosing interval of 80 to 100 minutes,17,30–32 suggesting
a higher dosage strength administered by a healthcare
professional
(HCP)
could
potentially
provide
the
desired onset of action and duration of analgesia for
an ASC setting.
METHOD
This phase-3, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 4 hospitals in
the United States. The study was registered with
clinicaltrials.gov on February 2, 2015 (Clinicaltrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02356588). The protocol was approved
by the Institutional Review Board for each study site,
and written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. The study was conducted under the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation, Harmonised Tri-
partite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the
Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Primary Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Male and nonpregnant female patients aged ≥ 18 years
scheduled to undergo abdominoplasty, open tension-
free inguinal hernioplasty (Lichtenstein repair with
mesh), or laparoscopic abdominal surgery (under gen-
eral or spinal anesthesia that did not include intrathecal
opioids during the operation), and who were classified
as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class 1
to 3,33 were eligible for inclusion.
All patients were expected, by virtue of the type of
surgery performed, to have ≥ 24 hours of moderate-to-
severe postoperative pain. Patients were excluded if they
had previously taken an opioid for > 30 consecutive
days, at a daily dose of > 15 mg of oral morphine (or
equivalent), ≤ 3 months prior to surgery.

 Randomization
Using an Interactive Web Response System, patients
meeting eligibility criteria at screening and following
surgery (stable vital signs and arterial oxygen saturation
by pulse oximetry maintained at ≥ 95% with or without
supplemental oxygen) were randomized 2:1 to the SST or
an identical-appearing placebo tablet (placebo) group,
and then stratified by sex. The study period began once
the first SST or placebo was administered into the
patient’s sublingual space by a HCP via the single-dose
applicator, which was packaged in a numbered pouch to
maintain the double-blind. There was no restriction on
the type of surgical anesthesia or analgesia allowed with
the exception of long-acting regional anesthesia, as the
initial dosing of study drug required the patient to report
a pain intensity score of ≥ 4 on an 11-point numerical
rating scale (NRS; 0 = no pain; 10 = worst possible
pain). Patients could request additional doses over the
24-hour study period, with a minimum 60-minute
redosing interval. Patients were considered Completers
if they completed 24 hours in the study. An extension
period of up to 48 hours was allowed if the patient’s pain
intensity
(≥ 4)
required
continued
dosing
beyond
24 hours. In order to minimize missing data and patient
dropouts, rescue medication (1 mg IV morphine) was
allowed hourly if the patient requested additional
medication for pain that was inadequately managed by
the study drug. No other analgesic medications were
allowed once the study drug had been initiated, with the
exception of acetaminophen to treat a headache.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments Included in this
Analysis
Efficacy was assessed by patient reports of pain
intensity on the 11-point NRS, a 5-point pain relief
scale (0 = no relief; 1 = a little relief; 2 = moderate
relief; 3 = a lot of relief; 4 = complete relief), percent-
age of patients dropping out of the study due to
inadequate analgesia, and patient and HCP global
assessments (PGA and HPGA, respectively). In addi-
tion, all HCPs who administered study drug to ≥ 3
patients answered a Study Drug Administration Ques-
tionnaire at the end of the study.
Pain intensity was initially recorded at baseline prior
to dosing. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were then
obtained at 15 minutes and 30 minutes, followed by
every hour (from 1 to 12 hours) and every 2 hours (from
12 to 24 hours) following first dose of study drug, as
well as prior to rescue analgesia administration. PGA
and HPGA were completed at 24 hours or at study
termination.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted
summed pain intensity difference to baseline (SPID) over
the 12-hour study period (SPID12). Secondary efficacy
endpoints included SPID over 1 hour (SPID1) and
24 hours (SPID24), time-weighted total pain relief
(TOTPAR) over 12 (TOTPAR12) and 24 (TOTPAR24)
hours, and summed pain relief intensity difference
(SPRID) over 12 (SPRID12) and 24 (SPRID24) hours.
Other secondary endpoints included the proportion of
patients terminating the study and/or requiring rescue
medication due to inadequate analgesia, the proportion
of patients and HCPs who responded “excellent” or
“good” to the global assessments, pain intensity, pain
intensity difference (PID) to baseline, pain relief, pain
relief intensity difference at each evaluation time point,
proportion of patients not requiring study drug after
24 hours, and time to first use of rescue medication.
Safety assessments included AEs and use of concomi-
tant medications, periodic monitoring of vital signs
(blood pressure, heart rate [HR], and respiratory rate
[RR]), and continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat
(ITT) population, defined as all patients who were
randomized and received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug. A
sample size of 159 patients (106 SST and 53 placebo)
was based on an effect size of 0.55 for SPID12 and was
sufficient to provide 90% power to demonstrate statis-
tical difference at 0.05 between the 2 treatment groups.
This calculation was based on a 2-sided 2-sample t-test
with a 2-to-1 sample size allocation ratio, and a
significance
level
of
a = 0.05.
Assuming
a
10%
nonevaluable rate for both treatment groups, a random-
ized sample size of 180 patients (120 in the SST group
and 60 in the placebo group) was planned. A modified
Brown’s analysis34 was used to impute any remaining
missing data points up through the end of the study
period for all early dropouts in either treatment group.
Briefly, pain intensity data from the placebo group were
used to derive a time-specific “imputing value k” for
each time point. This k value included a combination of
pain intensity values from placebo patients remaining in
the study at that time point and the worst pain intensity
values of placebo group dropouts who terminated prior
to the time point. To minimize the impact of rescue

 medication on primary and secondary endpoint analy-
sis, pain intensity and pain relief scores obtained just
prior to rescue opioid administration were imputed for
1 hour following the use of rescue, after which time the
regularly scheduled assessments were then analyzed.
Data pooled from all study sites were examined using
an F-test before applying the 2-sample t-test. Fisher’s
exact test was used to analyze categorical data. Least-
squares (LS) means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for SPID12 and continuous secondary efficacy variables
were constructed using an ANCOVA model, which
included treatment, treatment center, sex, and baseline
pain intensity as covariates. Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel
test stratified by sex with modified ridit scores was used
for categorical data. A 2-sample Z-test was used to
analyze dichotomous outcome data on 2 proportions,
difference between proportions, and 95% CI between
SST and placebo.
Survival analysis methods were used for time to event
data. Kaplan–Meier product limit estimators were used
to measure the cumulative rates of patients that reach
the termination event (ie, termination due to inadequate
analgesia and time to take first rescue medication). A
log-rank test was used to compare the 2 groups. The
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the 2 groups for
incidence of most frequent or severe AEs for patients
during the study and for 12 hours following discontin-
uation of study drug dosing.
RESULTS
The first patient enrolled March 2015, and the final
patient completed the study June 2015. A total of 163
patients were randomized and 161 of these patients
received study drug and were included in the ITT and
safety populations (Figure 1 and Table S1). A total of
143 patients completed the 24-hour study period (89%)
and were included in the efficacy analysis for Com-
pleters. Overall, 53 of 131 (33%) patients entered the
extension period (beyond 24 hours) and were included
in the safety population (Table S1). The mean age of
patients in the ITT population was 40.9 years with
1.2% aged ≥ 65 years. There were no statistically
significant differences in baseline demographics and
characteristics between treatment groups (Table 1).
Efficacy
The primary endpoint, the LS mean SPID12 score, was
significantly higher (greater reduction in pain intensity
from baseline) in the SST than in the placebo group
(25.8 vs. 13.1; P < 0.001), with a difference of 12.7
(95% CI: [7.16, 18.23]) between groups (Table 2). For
the secondary endpoints, mean SPID, TOTPAR, and
SPRID scores were also significantly higher (greater
reduction in pain intensity and/or greater pain relief) in
the SST group at the 1- (SPID), 12- (TOTPAR, SPRID),
and 24-hour (SPID, TOTPAR, SPRID) time points
(Table 2). Among those patients completing 24 hours
(Completers), the LS mean SPID12 score remained
significantly higher in the SST compared with the
placebo group (26.07 vs. 16.09; P < 0.001), with a
difference of 9.98 (3.00; 95% CI: [4.05, 15.90]) between
groups.
When
evaluated
at
different
time
points
over
24 hours, SPID, TOTPAR, and SPRID scores at each
time point were significantly better in the SST compared
with the placebo group (P < 0.05 for each). When
SPID12 data were analyzed by age, sex, race, body mass
index (BMI), and type of surgery, scores were higher
with SST than placebo for all subgroups. However, the
total number of patients per subgroup, particularly in
the placebo arm (range: SST = 23 to 106; placebo = 10
to 53), was relatively small compared with the full study
cohort (Table S2). These differences were significant for
age < 65 years (P < 0.001), female sex (P < 0.001),
Caucasian race (P = 0.001), non-Caucasian race (P
= 0.003),
BMI < 30 kg/m2,
abdominoplasty
(P
=
0.001),
and
laparoscopic
abdominal
surgery
(P = 0.019), but not for male sex, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2,
and hernioplasty.
Onset of Analgesia. The drop in pain intensity from
baseline (PID) was greater for the SST group compared
with the placebo group at the first evaluation time point
(15 minutes; P = 0.002) (Figure 2). The remaining time
points remained numerically greater for the SST group,
with 3 time points (4, 20, and 22 hours) falling just short
of statistical significance (P = 0.051 to 0.082).
Termination Due to Inadequate Analgesia. Before the
end of the 24-hour study period, a significantly higher
proportion of patients in the placebo group (18.5%; 10/
54) compared with the SST group (3.7%; 4/107)
discontinued treatment (P = 0.002) or terminated the
study early (P = 0.001) due to inadequate analgesia
(Figure 3A).
Rescue Medication. A significantly higher proportion
of patients in the placebo group (64.8%; 35/54)
Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet 30 mcg � 851
 compared with the SST (27.1%; 29/107) group required
rescue
medication
due
to
inadequate
analgesia
(P < 0.001). Additionally, significantly more patients
in the placebo group compared with the SST group took
their first rescue medication earlier (P < 0.001; Fig-
ure 3B). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) cumulative
number of rescue morphine doses during the 24-hour
study period was significantly higher in the placebo
group (2.1 [2.9] compared with the SST group (0.5 [1.4];
P < 0.001).
PGA and HPGA. A significantly higher proportion of
patients and HCPs in the SST compared with the
placebo group reported success (“good” or “excellent”)
on the PGA (80.4% [N = 86] vs. 51.9% [N = 28]) with
a difference of 28.5% (95% CI: [13.20, 43.80];
P < 0.001) between groups at 24 hours and on the
HPGA (80.4% [N = 86] vs. 53.7% [N = 29]) with a
difference
of
26.7%
(95%
CI:
[11.42,
41.98];
P < 0.001) between groups at 24 hours.
Overall, a higher proportion of patients and HCPs
responded “excellent” and a smaller proportion of
patients responded “poor”, “fair”, or “good” in the
SST compared with the placebo group for PGA
(P = 0.004 overall) and HPGA (P = 0.022 overall) at
24 hours (Table S3).
Study Drug Dosing. Over the 24-hour study period, the
total mean (SD) number of study drug doses used was
not statistically significantly different between the SST
(7.0 [3.6]) and placebo (6.4 [3.8]) groups.
The LS mean (SEM) interdosing interval was signif-
icantly longer in the SST group compared with the
placebo group for the 12-hour study period (185.41
[8.80] vs. 146.55 [11.97] minutes; P = 0.008), but not
for the 24-hour period (220.81 [10.87] vs. 189.82
[14.78] minutes; P = 0.083).

 were 40.8 (25.0), 39.1 (30.0), and 43.7 (37.2) pg/mL at 1,
12, and 24 hours, respectively. At the same time points,
there were no differences in sufentanil concentrations
when analyzed by sex or BMI (< 30 vs. ≥ 30 kg/m2).
Safety
Seventy (43.5%) patients had ≥ 1 AE considered possi-
bly or probably related to study drug (Table 3). The
most frequently (in ≥ 2% of patients) reported AEs were
nausea (26.7%) and headache (11.8%). There were no
significant differences between treatment groups for the
incidence of any type of AE.
The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in
severity. Two patients in the placebo group discontinued
the study due to a treatment-emergent serious AE (SAE;
moderate syncope and severe hemiparesis, resolved by
the end of study), whereas no patients in the SST group
experienced an SAE (Table 3). Severe AEs that were
considered related to study drug were reported for 5
patients in the SST group (nausea, vomiting, and
headache) and 1 patient in the placebo group (hemi-
paresis) (Table 3).
There were clinically small, but statistically signifi-
cant (P < 0.05) differences within treatment groups for
mean changes from baseline for all vital signs in both
treatment groups, including systolic (SBP) and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), HR, RR, and oxygen saturation
(SPO2) at ≥ 1 time point during the 24-hour study
period. The largest mean changes from baseline for the
SST group were
as follows: SBP �13 mmHg
at
16 hours; DBP �10 mmHg at 16 hours; HR +7 beats
per minute at 24 hours; RR +1 breaths per minute at
24 hours; SPO2 �1% at 20 hours. The largest mean
changes from baseline for the placebo group were as
follows: SBP �10 mmHg at 16 hours; DBP �7 mmHg
at 16 hours; HR +8 beats per minute at 24 hours; RR +1
breaths per minute at 6 hours; SPO2 �1% at 16 hours.
Almost all (96.9%) patients took ≥ 1 concomitant
medication during the study. The most common, with
a similar proportion used between treatment groups,
were medical gases (55.9%), serotonin (5-HT3) antag-
onists (41.6%), natural opium alkaloids (39.8%), and
solution affecting electrolyte balance (38.5%).

 DISCUSSION
In this phase-3 study in patients treated for acute
postoperative pain following typical outpatient abdom-
inal surgical procedures, SST 30 mcg showed signifi-
cantly superior pain control compared with placebo for
the primary efficacy endpoint (SPID12) and for sec-
ondary endpoints related to pain intensity and pain
relief. Rapid onset of analgesia was observed in the SST
group, with statistically significant improvements in
pain intensity compared with the placebo group as
early as 15 minutes after the start of study drug dosing.
SPID12 ratings remained numerically superior in the
SST
group
across
age,
race,
female
sex,
and
BMI < 30 kg/m2 compared with placebo. However,
these results did not reach statistical significance due to
the small number of patients included in each sub-
group. Additionally, fewer patients in the SST com-
pared with the placebo group discontinued because of
inadequate analgesia or required rescue morphine. The
types of AEs reported in this study were generally as
expected in this patient population following outpatient
abdominal surgery, and there were no clinically mean-
ingful differences between treatment groups in AEs or
vital signs.
As more invasive and painful procedures are per-
formed in ASCs, emphasis on multimodal analgesia
including opioids will be necessary to efficiently manage
postoperative pain in these patients. While IV morphine
is still commonly used in this setting, it poses several
complications, as do similar opioids, such as hydromor-
phone. These opioids are hydrophilic and cannot easily
pass through the blood–brain barrier to target the CNS.
In particular, IV morphine has a delayed plasma:
CNS equilibration t1/2ke0 of 2.8 hours. Conversely, the
highly lipophilic opioid sufentanil passes more rapidly
through the blood–brain barrier, with a 6.2 minute
t1/2ke0. This lipophilic nature of sufentanil (1,300 and
1,700 times higher octanol:water partition coefficient
than hydromorphone and morphine, respectively) also
allows for prompt uptake from the sublingual tissues
following drug administration.35 This rapid transition
from sublingual tissue to mu-opioid receptor activation
was evident in this study by the greater decrease in pain
intensity from baseline at the first time point measured
(15 minutes).
The average interdosing interval of SST in this study
was 185 minutes over 12 hours, suggesting that the
sublingual route of administration results in an extended
duration of analgesia compared with the IV bolus
administration of lipophilic opioids, such as fentanyl
or sufentanil. The time from peak plasma concentration
(Cmax) to 50% of Cmax for sublingual sufentanil
(2.5 hours) is extended 25-fold compared with bolus
IV sufentanil administration of the same dose.33 SST
may afford the ability to obtain rapid analgesia via a
noninvasive route of administration while avoiding the
frequent
redosing
often
required
for
IV
fen-
tanyl.19,23,24,36
Sufentanil, unlike morphine and hydromorphone,
also avoids the issue of active metabolites that can lead
to prolonged, untoward effects, which can complicate
postoperative care and affect patient discharge.37–40 As
patients are often discharged within a few hours
following outpatient surgery, delayed untoward effects
of opioids due to both the delayed accumulation of
active metabolites and the slower CNS penetration of
these water-soluble glucuronide moieties becomes more
of a concern than following inpatient surgery where
patients are more closely monitored.

drug.
†Two SAEs (syncope [moderate in severity, 2-minute duration] and hemiparesis [severe,
47 hours and 51-minute duration]) were reported in 2 patients in the placebo group
and were considered possibly related to treatment. Both patients discontinued due to
the SAEs, which resolved without treatment by the end of the study.
‡Five patients in the sufentanil group and 2 patients in the placebo group reported 8
and 2 severe AEs, respectively; all events in the sufentanil group and one event in the
placebo group were considered possibly or probably related to treatment (one event in
the placebo group, procedural nausea, was considered unrelated). Study drug dose was
not changed and the event resolved in 5 of 5 patients in the sufentanil group and 1 of 2
patients in the placebo group (1 patient in the placebo group discontinued from study).
§Five AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in 3 patients.

 Limitations
This study had several limitations that require careful
interpretation of results. As this study was meant to
reflect the typical surgical population, patient enroll-
ment was not limited by age. Yet, the elderly were still
under-represented in this study (1.2% of patients were
age > 65 years). Additional evaluation of SST 30 mcg
in the elderly is currently ongoing in phase-3 clinical
trials.
A 12-hour evaluation period was chosen as the
primary endpoint as ambulatory care surgery typically
results in same-day discharge. This study, therefore,
cannot fully interpret the longer term effects of SST in
this population. However, the majority of patients in
this study were followed for 24 hours. Lastly, our
limited sample size (< 500) may also affect the gener-
alizability of these results.
Contrary to the limitations of this study, over 600
patients exposed to SST 15 mcg in the 3 phase-3 clinical
trials—which evaluated the sublingual sufentanil tablet
system (containing SST 15 mcg doses in a bedside
patient-controlled
dispenser
[Zalviso;
Gr€
unenthal
GmbH, Aachen, Germany; authorized for use in Europe
September 2015]) for moderate-to-severe postoperative
pain following open-abdominal and/or major orthope-
dic surgery—have shown a similar safety profile to this
study.17,31,32
These
SST
15 mcg-treated
patients
included a significant elderly population (approximately
50% were age > 65 and 20% were age > 75 years) and
were followed for up to 72 hours. SST 15 mcg could be
dosed as frequently as every 20 minutes, and therefore,
the exposure to sufentanil was similar, or higher, than in
the current study.
All patients, including those in the SST group, were
permitted to receive IV opioids in the operating room as
well as IV morphine for rescue analgesia. However, SST
demonstrated
superior
pain
relief
compared
with
placebo despite this potential confound.31,32 One of
these phase-3 studies evaluated SST 15 mcg PCA vs. IV
morphine PCA for moderate-to-severe pain following
major orthopedic or open-abdominal surgery, and
patients treated with SST 15 mcg (pro re nata [prn]
every 20 minutes) had a significantly greater mean pain
intensity reduction from baseline at 1, 2, and 4 hours
compared with IV morphine (1 mg prn with a 6-minute
lockout), further supporting the rapid onset of action of
sublingual sufentanil.17 Future studies comparing SST
30 mcg with IV morphine or other opioids may further
elucidate this issue.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, SST 30 mcg was well tolerated, with no
unexpected AEs, no clinically meaningful vital sign
changes, and a safety profile that was as expected for this
postoperative patient population.
