Background. Building on evidence that natural environments (e.g. parks, woodlands, beaches) are key loca-
tions for physical activity, we estimated the total annual amount of adult recreational physical activity in
England's natural environments, and assessed implications for population health.
Methods. A cross-sectional analysis of six waves (2009/10–2014/5) of the nationally representative, Monitor
of Engagement with the Natural Environment survey (n = 280,790). The survey uses a weekly quota sample, and
population weights, to estimate nature visit frequency across England, and provides details on a single, randomly
selected visit (n = 112,422), including: a) duration; b) activity; and c) environment type.
Results. Approximately 8.23 million (95% CIs: 7.93, 8.54) adults (19.5% of the population) made at least one
‘active visit’ (i.e. ≥30 min, ≥3 METs) to natural environments in the previous week, resulting in 1.23 billion
(1.14, 1.32) ‘active visits’ annually. An estimated 3.20 million (3.05, 3.35) of these also reported meeting recom-
mended physical activity guidelines (i.e. ≥5 × 30 min a week) fully, or in part, through such visits. Active visits by
this group were associated with an estimated 109,164 (101,736, 116,592) Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)
annually. Assuming the social value of a QALY to be £20,000, the annual value of these visits was approximately
£2.18 billion (£2.03, £2.33). Results for walking were replicated using WHO's Health Economic Assessment Tool.
Conclusions. Natural environments provide the context for a large proportion of England's recreational phys-
ical activity and highlight the need to protect and manage such environments for health purposes.

1. Introduction
Regular physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of obesi-
ty, coronary heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, mental ill health, and
mortality (National Institute for Health Care Excellence, 2008; World
Health Organization, 2009). Nevertheless, in England only 34% of adults
report meeting the minimum recommended weekly levels of activity
(i.e. 5 × 30 min) (Bélanger et al., 2011), and inactivity is estimated to
cost
the
healthcare
system
more
than
£1
billion
annually
(Scarborough et al., 2011). Consequently, there is great interest in un-
derstanding the barriers to, and enablers of, physical activity, including
the role of environmental factors (Ding et al., 2012; National Institute
for Health Care Excellence, 2012; Ogilvie et al., 2007). Although explic-
itly linked to health promotion for centuries (Thompson, 2011), the po-
tential of ‘natural environments’, such as parks, woodlands and beaches,
to support and encourage regular outdoor physical activity has only
been investigated systematically, relatively recently (Hunter et al.,
2015). Crucially, natural environments offer opportunities for informal
or incidental physical activity among those who, for lack of time,
money or confidence, are reluctant to participate in organised sports
or gym-related activities (Schutzer and Graves, 2004; Withall et al.,
2011).
To date, however, most studies have examined the relationship be-
tween a person's self-reported physical activity level in general and
their proximity to natural environments in general without exploring
how much activity occurs in outdoor natural settings (Hunter et al.,
2015). Although several studies have monitored physical activity in
adults and children using accelerometers and GPS trackers, these stud-
ies tend to involve few individuals making it hard to generalise to an en-
tire population (Evenson et al., 2013; Wheeler et al., 2010). We know of
no previous attempt to estimate either the total amount of physical ac-
tivity that takes place in an entire country's varied natural environ-
ments, or the potential benefits to population health of such activities.
The aim of the current research was to address these gaps.
Specifically, we estimated annual adult levels of physical activity oc-
curring in natural environments across England, using data from the

 Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) Survey
(Natural England, 2015a). The MENE is a nationally representative sur-
vey investigating visits to natural environments for recreational pur-
poses, and survey weights allow population estimates of visit type and
frequency. As physical activity needs to be both regular and sustained
to benefit health (Haskell et al., 2007), our assessment of the health im-
plications of nature visits focused on those individuals who met recom-
mended physical activity guidelines either fully, or partly, in natural
environments. The potential health effects associated with this cumula-
tive level of activity were considered in terms of Quality Adjusted Life
Years (QALYs) (Beale et al., 2012), and a monetary estimate of the social
value of these QALYs made. (National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence, 2013) Finally, a robustness check of this estimate (focused
on walking) was conducted using the World Health Organisation's,
Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT).
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and sample
Data were from Waves 1–6 (years 2009/10–2014/5) of the MENE
survey. The MENE is a repeat cross-sectional survey of over 40,000
adults annually (total n = 280,790). It is commissioned by Natural En-
gland and is part of a face-to-face nationally representative omnibus
survey conducted throughout the year to reduce seasonal biases. Data
are collected via in-home interviews using Computer Assisted Personal
Interviewing (CAPI) (Natural England, 2015a). Respondents are asked
about occasions in the last week when they spent leisure time “out of
doors”, defined as, “open spaces in and around towns and cities, including
parks, canals and nature areas; the coast and beaches; and the countryside
including farmland, woodland, hills and rivers. This could be anything from
a few minutes to all day. It may include time spent close to your home or
workplace, further afield or while on holiday in England. However, this
does not include routine shopping trips or time spent in your own garden”
(p.35) (Natural England, 2015a). Approximately 40% of respondents re-
port at least one visit in the last week. General information is collected
about all visits, and detailed data are collected for a single visit (n =
112,422), randomly selected (via CAPI) from those taken in the last
week.
Based on participant demographic profiles and frequency of visits,
Natural England developed two weighting variables relevant here: a)
‘weekweight’, and b) ‘weekVweight’. The use of these weights was nec-
essary to make extrapolations from the current sample of individuals
and visits per year, to the entire adult population. Details of the deriva-
tion and testing of these weights are provided elsewhere, [Appendix A1
and ref Natural England, 2015b]. Current analyses estimating popula-
tion totals and demographic sub-groups making active visits to natural
environments in the last week were weighted using ‘weekweight’.
Analysis of the total annual number of visits, as well as activities under-
taken and environment types visited, used the ‘weekVweight’. Our insti-
tutional ethics board did not require a formal ethics application for the
current analysis of this secondary, publically available, anonymised
data.
2.2. Data and variables
The main visit variables of interest were: a) duration; b) activity; and
c) environment type. For estimating health-related implications, we
were also interested in physical activity in general.
Visit duration was estimated by asking, “How long did this visit last al-
together –that is from the time you left to when you returned?”. Estimates
for time spent in the natural environment were derived after
subtracting estimated travel time; the latter based on: a) distance trav-
elled; and b) mode of transport (Appendix A2, and ref (Elliott et al.,
2015)). To avoid suggesting over precise duration estimates, duration
was dichotomised as being either b30 or ≥30 min, a meaningful thresh-
old in terms of meeting the recommended physical activity guidelines.
Although respondents could select multiple activities from a list of
19, our main analyses only included visits involving a single activity as
it was impossible to estimate duration for each activity on multi-activity
visits. Based on the Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al.,
2011), Metabolic Equivalence of Task ( MET), rates for each MENE activ-
ity have been developed (Appendix A3, (Elliott et al., 2015)). One MET is
equivalent to a standard resting metabolic rate of 3.5 ml of oxygen con-
sumption per kg of body weight, per minute engaged in an activity.
METs are thus a ratio of the metabolic rate associated with an activity
compared to this resting rate. Our main analyses focused on those activ-
ities categorised as either ‘moderate’ (i.e. 3–5.9 METs) or ‘vigorous’ (i.e.
≥6 METs) in intensity, i.e. those most linked to health (Ainsworth et al.,
2011; US Department of Health, 2008).
Regarding environment type, respondents could select from one or
more categories: ‘a park in a town or city’ (town park), ‘a children's play-
ground’ (play area), ‘a playing field or other recreation area’ (play area),
‘another open space in a town or city’ (open space), ‘an allotment or
community garden (allotment)’, ‘a country park’ (country park), a
‘woodland or forest’ (woods), ‘farmland’ (farmland), ‘a river lake or
canal’ (waterway), ‘a mountain, hill or moorland’ (uplands), ‘a village’,
‘a path, cycleway or bridleway’ (path), ‘open space in the countryside’
(open country), ‘a beach’ (beach), ‘other coastline’ (coast); and ‘Other’.
Visits involving multiple environments were classified as ‘Mixed’ (Ap-
pendix A4). As the chosen visit was randomly selected from all visits
in the last week, we assumed it was representative in terms of duration,
activity and environment.
The following socio-demographic factors were considered in terms
of who constituted ‘active visitors’: gender, age, socioeconomic status
(Social Grades AB (Highest), C1, C2 and DE (Lowest); Appendix A5), ur-
banity of residence (Appendix A6), region of residence (9 Government
Office Regions), and dog ownership.
Frequency of recreational and active travel-related physical activity
was measured using the item: ‘In the past week, on how many days
have you done a total of 30 minutes or more of physical activity, which
was enough to raise your breathing rate? This may include sport, exercise,
and brisk walking or cycling for recreation or to get to and from places, but
should not include housework or physical activity that may be part of your
job’. For current purposes, respondents were dichotomised as either
‘sufficiently active individuals’ (i.e. ≥5 days) or ‘insufficiently active in-
dividuals’ (i.e. b5 days). Although health gains may still be made with
b5 × 30 min a week, (Wen et al., 2011) we adopted the more conserva-
tive threshold.
2.3. Estimating potential health gains
Building on an estimation of the benefits to health associated with a
scheme to promote walking in natural environments, (Natural England,
2009) the current study estimated the potential value to health associ-
ated with a wider range of physical activities undertaken during recre-
ational visits to natural environments across England, using a much
larger and more representative sample, and calculated the Quality Ad-
justed Life Years (QALYs) associated with these visits. QALYs are a met-
ric used to compare the health benefits associated with different health-
related interventions, where one QALY is equivalent to one year lived in
full health. In the current analysis, we used QALY estimates derived by
(Beale et al. (2012); Beale et al., 2007) which aimed to estimate the po-
tential health benefits of “environmental interventions to promote physi-
cal activity” (20, p.26). Based on analysis of Health Survey for England
data, (Beale et al. (2007)) estimated that 30 min a week of moderate-in-
tense physical activity, if undertaken 52 weeks a year, would be associ-
ated with 0.010677 QALYs per individual, per year. Beale et al. (2007)
also assumed that the relationship between physical activity and
QALYs is both cumulative and linear (e.g. 2 × 30 min × 52 weeks =
0.021354 QALY, Appendix A7).

cross-sectional study in En..., Prev. Med. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.08.023
 As well as enabling comparisons of health gains across a range of in-
terventions, the QALY is also used to evaluate the relative cost effective-
ness of interventions by the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE). At the time of writing, the implicit social value of a
QALY in England, based on the NICE cost-effectiveness threshold, was
£20,000. Specifically, NICE states that: “generally we consider that inter-
ventions costing the NHS less than £20,000 per QALY gained are cost-ef-
fective”, (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, 2013)
implying that enhancing health by a single QALY is saving up to
£20,000 in health care costs (for further discussion of the NICE threshold
see (Claxton et al., 2015; Barnsley et al., 2013)). Of note, the earlier Nat-
ural England study used the higher QALY value of £30,000 to estimate a
monetary value of the health gains from the Walking to Health Initiative
(Natural England, 2009).
To test the robustness of our monetary estimates of potential health
gains using QALYs, we conducted a similar analysis using WHO's HEAT
tool (http://www.heatwalkingcycling.org/). This approach estimates the
number of lives saved through sufficient physical activity (via walking
and cycling only), and makes monetary estimates using the ‘value of a
statistical life’, which at the time of writing was £3,229,114, per person.
As the HEAT tool only estimates the value of two activities, we selected
the most frequent activity (i.e. walking) to compare across both valuation
approaches. The HEAT analysis requires: a) the number of walkers, b) the
average per capita amount of time spent walking, and c) the regularity of
walking, and does not require that individuals meet the 5 × ≥ 30 min
threshold. However, in order to keep the two estimates as comparable
as possible we only included walkers who did report 5 × ≥ 30 min overall,
even if not all of this was in natural environments (Appendix A8).
3. Results
Pooling data across the six waves, and using annual population
weights (Table 1), the estimated number of people who made ‘active
visits’ (i.e. ≥30 min and ≥3METs) to natural environments in any
given week was 8.23 million (95% CIs: 7.93, 8.54 million) individuals,
or 19.5% of the adult population of England. The vast majority, 7.72 mil-
lion (7.44, 7.99), made visits associated with moderate levels of activity
(3–6 METs). Only 0.52 million (0.47, 0.56) engaged in vigorous activities
(≥6 METs). Across the year, the total number of visits was approximate-
ly 2.83 billion (2.66, 2.99), of which 51.5% (1.23 billion) were
categorised as ‘active’ (of note many individuals made more than one
visit per week which is why these figures are not simply visitor numbers
multiplied by 52 weeks).
Further details on the demographic profiles of all visitors to nature
and the subset who engaged in active visits are presented in Supple-
mentary Table A. Gender, age, urban-rural, and region profiles of active
vs. non-active visitors were all relatively close to the overall population
distribution. Reflecting potential income-related inequalities in the use
of natural environments, individuals in the highest socio-economic
groups (24.4% of the population) accounted for 30.9% of all visits and
30.1% of active visits; while those in the lowest socio-economic groups
(26.2% of the population) accounted for 19.3% of all visits, and 19.9% of
active visits. Thus although less likely to visit in general, individuals in
the lowest socio-economic groups were just as likely as those in the
highest socio-economic groups to be active on any given visit.
Table 2 presents a summary of activities engaged in during visits.
The most frequent moderate-intensity activity visits (3–6 METs)
≥30 min were walking, either with a dog, or without a dog. Running
and road cycling were the most popular vigorous-intensity activities
(≥6METs). Table 3 presents data on where these active visits took
place, broken down into moderate- and vigorous- intensity. Nearly a
quarter of visits associated with moderate activities, and an eighth of
vigorous activities, took place in urban parks. Popular rural locations
for moderate physical activity included: woodlands, open countryside,
and country parks; and for vigorous physical activity included: open
countryside, pathways, and farmland. Aquatic (or ‘blue space’) settings
including inland waterways, beaches and coasts were also popular, ac-
counting for 12.6% of moderate-intensity visits, and 9.6% of vigorous-in-
tensity visits.
In order to explore the potential health implications from active
visits to nature we identified those individuals who met physical activ-
ity guidelines fully, or in part, via nature visits. This group (Table 4)
consisted of individuals who said they met guidelines and made from
1 (n = 939,833) through to ≥5 (n = 1,007,333) active visits to nature
last week; alongside those who said they did not meet guidelines but
nonetheless made ≥5 active nature visits in the last week (n =
376,833). In total this added up to approximately 3.20 million (3.05,
3.35) individuals, or approximately 7.6% of the population. Of note, we
also identified 4.32 million (4.24, 4.39) individuals (10.2%) who also
met guidelines but reported no visits to nature in the last week.
Using (Beale et al.'s (2007)) calculations, we assigned a QALY value
to each individual commensurate with their respective level of activity
in nature (i.e. 0.010677 per weekly visit), allowing us to isolate the con-
tribution to health from activity in nature alone. Multiplying the num-
ber of individuals who made 1–5 visits by the relevant QALY values,
and summing the results, provided an overall population estimate of
109,164 (95% CIs: 101,736, 116,592) QALYs per year. Assuming the so-
cial value of a QALY to be £20,000, the estimated welfare gain was in
the order of £2.18 billion (95% CIs: £2.03, 2.33) per year.
To explore the robustness of this estimate, we estimated the number
of ‘active individuals’ whose ‘active visits’ to nature consisted of walking
using both the QALY and HEAT tool approach. Using the QALY approach,
‘walkers’ accounted for an estimated 79,673 QALYs annually and a po-
tential health gain worth £1.59 billion (Supplementary Table B). Using
the HEAT approach, walkers constituted, on average, 2.12 million indi-
viduals annually, the average number of walking visits (≥30 min) was
3.7 per person, and 93% said they walked in nature at least weekly. To
simplify the estimate, we made the assumption that all walkers visited
weekly but made just 3 × 30 min visits. Based on this approach, the

 tool estimated that this amount of walking in natural environments was
“likely to lead to a reduction in the risk of mortality of 6%” and that “the
number of deaths per year prevented by this level of walking is: 542,”.
The tool concluded that the “annual benefit of this level of walking,
per year, is: £1,750,922,000”.
4. Discussion
The present study is, we believe, the first to estimate the total annual
amount of physical activity associated with recreational visits to natural
environments by adults for an entire country. Using 6 years of popula-
tion-weighted survey data, our findings suggest that over 8 million
adults in England regularly undertake meaningful physical activity in
natural environments each week, and that for over 3 million of these in-
dividuals, this activity contributes to them achieving recommended
guidelines for weekly physical activity. The implications for health
among this subset, in terms of QALYs, was considerable, and potential
financial implications, even from just walking (the most frequent activ-
ity), were large and consistent across both the QALY and HEAT tool ap-
proaches. Given that regular walking both reduces the risk of various
health conditions (Hamer and Chida, 2008), and is feasible for many in-
dividuals (Ogilvie et al., 2004), further promotion of, and support for,
walking in nature could be an important public health intervention.
(Natural England, 2009).
Although natural environments were used for recreational physical
activity by all sectors of society, a socio-economic gradient was ob-
served. Nonetheless, the data also highlight that once in nature, individ-
uals from all socioeconomic groups are equally likely to engage in
physical activity which suggests that if they can be encouraged to visit
more often or that access to local natural environments can be im-
proved, all sectors of society could benefit (Mitchell and Popham,
2008). Given that growing urbanisation places a premium on previously
undeveloped green and blue spaces in and around urban centres, a
greater appreciation of the health benefits that might be lost during

 further development, especially in areas of relative deprivation, may
help planning authorities make more informed decisions (Zhou and
Wang, 2011).
We recognise that our estimates were based on comparing current
baseline levels of physical activity in natural environments with a coun-
terfactual of no physical activity occurring in these environments. They
are not estimates based on a change in physical activity levels resulting
from an intervention, nor do they examine the substitutability of phys-
ical activity across natural and urban/indoor locations. We therefore re-
main cautious, seeing our approach more as a tool for promoting
discussion of how the potential health and wellbeing benefits of natural
environments could be estimated. For instance, this approach might
help in estimating the effects on the nation's health from large-scale en-
vironmental interventions that promote physical activity (e.g. the
development of an English national coastal path, https://www.gov.uk/
government/collections/england-coast-path-improving-public-access-
to-the-coast), or widespread restrictions on access to natural environ-
ments resulting from events such as the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth out-
break, which as well as affecting the mental health of those directly
involved, significantly restricted access for millions of visitors (Mort et
al., 2005).
A number of further limitations need to be considered. The use of
self-reported data assumes that respondents were: a) accurately
reporting the duration of activities; b) engaging in the level of intensity
associated with these activities, as set out by (Ainsworth et al. (2011))
for the entire visit duration; and c) accurately reporting the frequency
of physical activity ≥30 min a week. Although we made several at-
tempts to mitigate the effects of any violations of these assumptions in
the current work (see Appendix A9) we remain cautious about over-
interpreting the precise estimates made. Further research using more
objective measures of naturalistic physical activity in different natural
environments is needed to help assess the robustness of our assump-
tions and to provide more accurate assessments in future work.
Further, the conversion from physical activity in nature to QALYs is
based on (Beale et al. (2007)) where there are number of uncertainties
over how best to model the benefit of accrued exercise over time, or
how to account for accidents and injuries, which would need to be ex-
plored in future work. Future research may also want to include physi-
cal activity undertaken in nature for occupational purposes (e.g.
farming), by children, or in (private) gardens. Children were present
on approximately 17% of all MENE visits by adults, and children make
many visits without adult supervision (Page et al., 2009). Although pri-
vate gardens did not count as natural environments in the MENE survey,
gardening is one of the most popular outdoor physical activities, (Office
for National Statistics, 2011) is associated with moderately-intensive
activity, and encourages contact with the natural world. Moreover,
physical activity in nature may be even better for people than physical
activity in general (Thompson Coon et al., 2011), and even visits involv-
ing low levels of physical activity (e.g. picnics), may be associated with
benefits to health via stress reduction (White et al., 2013), neither of
which was investigated here.
We also recognise that as little as 90 min of moderate-vigorous phys-
ical activity a week can be beneficial for health (Wen et al., 2011). Thus
although we selected a relatively conservative approach to identifying
those who qualified as ‘physically active’ in our sample, future work
might consider a lower threshold resulting in more individuals being in-
cluded in future estimates. Future work, might also investigate the po-
tential health benefits of particular types of natural environment or
particular activities in natural settings at the population level (Willis et
al., 2015; Papathanasopoulou et al., 2016). Finally, we were also unable
to estimate the costs of sustainably managing environments and main-
taining access, or the opportunity costs of alternative land use practices.
Future work is needed to develop a full cost-benefit analysis that would
take these, and other, factors into account (Natural England, 2012).

 5. Conclusions
A considerable amount of moderate-vigorous intensity recreational
physical activity, predominantly walking, takes place in natural envi-
ronments in England. Such activity is undertaken by all sectors of the
population and may be more appealing, and thus more sustainable,
than other forms of physical activity (e.g. gyms), for many individuals.
Healthcare practitioners could use this evidence to support patients, es-
pecially those reluctant to engage in formal exercise programmes, rec-
ognise that even regular walks in the park can have meaningful
benefits for their health. By beginning to understand the value to health
from various natural settings, we may also better justify efforts to pro-
tect these settings from development or disrepair, and thus continue
to offer the public health benefits envisaged by Victorian era park
designers.
