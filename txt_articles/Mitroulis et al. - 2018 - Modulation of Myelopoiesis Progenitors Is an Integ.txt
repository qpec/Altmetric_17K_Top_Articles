SUMMARY
Trained innate immunity fosters a sustained favor-
able response of myeloid cells to a secondary
challenge, despite their short lifespan in circulation.
We
thus
hypothesized
that
trained
immunity
acts via modulation of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs). Administration of b-glucan
(prototypical trained-immunity-inducing agonist) to
mice induced expansion of progenitors of the
myeloid lineage, which was associated with elevated
signaling by innate immune mediators, such as IL-1b
and
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), and with adaptations in glucose
metabolism
and
cholesterol
biosynthesis.
The
trained-immunity-related increase in myelopoiesis
resulted in a beneficial response to secondary
LPS challenge and protection from chemotherapy-
induced myelosuppression in mice. Therefore, mod-
ulation of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow is
an integral component of trained immunity, which to
date, was considered to involve functional changes
of mature myeloid cells in the periphery.
INTRODUCTION
Recent studies have shown that certain microbial challenges
or vaccines promote a heightened response of myeloid cell
populations to a subsequent infection with the same or even
different pathogens. This process involves changes in cell
transcription and is designated ‘‘trained immunity’’ (Goodridge
et al., 2016; Jensen et al., 2015; Netea and van Crevel, 2014;
Netea et al., 2016; Quintin et al., 2012). Pathogen-associated
molecular patterns or cytokines induce a complex immuno-
metabolic program in monocytes and macrophages, enabling
a robust cellular response to re-stimulation, especially with
regard to cytokine production (Arts et al., 2016a; Netea
et al., 2016; Quintin et al., 2012). Transcriptomic and metabo-
lomic analysis have implicated metabolic pathways, especially
glucose metabolism, in the adaptation of monocytes and
macrophages in the context of innate immune memory (Arts
et al., 2016a, 2016b; Cheng et al., 2014; Netea et al., 2016).
However, the long-term effects (up to months) of trained

 immunity on circulating monocytes are puzzling, as these cells
have a relatively short lifespan in the circulation. We have,
thus, hypothesized that the adaptive processes induced
by trained immunity involve alterations to progenitors of
the hematopoietic system, a concept that has not been
addressed yet.
Hematopoiesis is a hierarchical system, in which hematopoiet-
ic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for its main-
tenance via their differentiation into progressively committed
progenitors and mature cells (Trumpp et al., 2010). HSPCs are
able to respond to stress, such as severe infection, systemic
inflammation, or iatrogenic myeloablation, by increasing their
proliferation rate and hematopoiesis (Trumpp et al., 2010; Zhao
and Baltimore, 2015). Myeloid lineage commitment and differen-
tiation of hematopoietic and myeloid progenitors are orches-
trated by myeloid-lineage-specific growth factors (Boettcher
and Manz, 2017; Mossadegh-Keller et al., 2013; Sarrazin and
Sieweke, 2011) and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1b (Pietras
et al., 2016). These mediators act on HSPCs and myeloid
progenitors driving myelopoiesis via inducing transcriptional
networks involving transcription factors (TFs) and expression of
myeloid-lineage-specific genes (Boettcher and Manz, 2017;
Rosenbauer and Tenen, 2007).
Cell metabolic pathways have been implicated in the regula-
tion of HSPC function. Aerobic glycolysis promotes the quies-
cence—and, thus, maintenance—of long-term hematopoietic
stem cells (LT-HSCs) (Simsek et al., 2010; Takubo et al., 2013;
Wang
et
al.,
2014),
whereas
oxidative
phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) is prominent in less primitive progenitors (Simsek
et al., 2010). Accordingly, disruption of the glycolytic process
impairs LT-HSC stemness, leading to loss of their self-renewal
potential (Simsek et al., 2010; Takubo et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2014). In turn, fatty acid oxidation drives asymmetric division
and differentiation (Ito et al., 2012), while cholesterol accumula-
tion is associated with skewing of hematopoiesis toward myeloid
lineage (Murphy et al., 2011; Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010).
Our present findings support the hypothesis stated earlier that
trained immunity acts at the level of hematopoietic progenitors
and specifically involves favorable adaptations in myelopoiesis.
Indeed, we show that b-glucan administration induced the
expansion of HSPCs, which was associated with IL-1b and
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor)
signaling as well as with changes in glucose and lipid meta-
bolism. Importantly, these progenitor adaptations, as conferred
by trained immunity, promoted a beneficial response to a
secondary inflammatory challenge and gave protection from
chemotherapy-induced myeloablation.
RESULTS
b-Glucan-Induced Trained Immunity Acts in the Bone
Marrow and Enhances Myelopoiesis
To study the response of the hematopoietic and myeloid
progenitor pool to agonists implicated in innate immune training,
mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of b-glucan.
After 24 hr, b-glucan increased the numbers and frequency of
hematopoietic progenitors (LSKs; Lin�cKit+Sca1+) and multipo-
tent progenitors (MPPs; CD48+CD150�LSK) in the bone marrow
(BM), as compared to injection of PBS (Figures 1A–1C).
No difference was observed in LT-HSCs (CD48�CD150+LSK),
while the numbers and frequency of short-term (ST)-HSCs
(CD48�CD150�LSK) were decreased (Figures 1A–1C). Cell-cy-
cle analysis in LT-HSCs revealed that b-glucan led to enhanced
cell-cycle progression in HSPCs (Figure S1), thus suggesting
enhanced differentiation-associated proliferation of LT-HSCs
upon b-glucan administration. The b-glucan-induced increase
in MPPs was linked to an increase in the frequency of the
MPP3 subset (Flt3�CD48+CD150�LSK), which is biased toward
the myeloid lineage (Pietras et al., 2015) (Figures 1D and 1E). In
contrast, we found no significant difference in the lymphoid-
biased MPP4 (Flt3+CD48+CD150�LSK) subset (Pietras et al.,
2015) (Figures 1D and 1E). Moreover, b-glucan induced an
increase in the frequency of CD41+ LT-HSCs (Figures 1F and
1G), which are considered the myeloid-biased LT-HSC subpop-
ulation (Gekas and Graf, 2013), although the overall absolute
numbers of LT-HSCs remained unaltered (Figure 1B).
Seven days after b-glucan injection, we observed increased
LSK, MPP, and LT-HSC cell numbers (Figure 2A), with an
elevated frequency of myeloid-biased MPP3 cells, a corre-
sponding decrease in the frequency of lymphoid-biased
MPP4 cells (Figure 2B), and increased frequency of CD41+LT-
HSCs (Figure 2C), as compared to findings with the injection
of PBS. Analysis of myeloid progenitors (MyPs; Lin�cKit+Sca1�)
at the 7-day time point revealed that b-glucan resulted in
enhanced granulocyte macrophage progenitor (GMP; Lin�c-
Kit+Sca1�CD16/32+CD34+) numbers and
in an increased
proportion of GMPs within the MyP population, accompanied
by a corresponding reduction in the relative abundance of
common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; Lin�c-Kit+Sca1�CD16/
32�CD34+), as compared to control mice (Figures 2D–2F).
Innate immune training has a long-term adaptive effect on
myeloid cells (Netea et al., 2016). We thus investigated whether
the effects of b-glucan on hematopoiesis were sustained over a
longer
period.
Although,
28 days
after
administration
of
b-glucan, the numbers of LSKs and LT-HSCs were not affected
(Figure 2G), b-glucan induced a significant decrease in the fre-
quency of lymphoid-biased MPP4 cells (Figure 2H) without
altering the frequency of MPP3 cells (data not shown). In addi-
tion, a significant increase in the numbers of GMPs was
observed (Figure 2I). To expand on these findings, we tested
the b-glucan-induced effects on HSPCs through a transplanta-
tion experiment using the CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system (Fig-
ure 2J). To this end, LT-HSCs were isolated from mice at 28 days
after b-glucan or PBS administration and transferred to lethally
irradiated recipient mice. Lineage output of donor-derived cells
was studied 12 weeks post-transplantation. Peripheral blood
analysis demonstrated that LT-HSCs from b-glucan-injected
mice gave rise to an increased proportion of Gr1+CD11b+
myeloid cells with a corresponding reduction in the proportion
of CD19+ B cells, as compared to LT-HSCs transplanted from
PBS-treated mice (Figure 2K). No difference was observed in pe-
ripheral chimerism between LT-HSCs from PBS and b-glucan-
injected mice, suggesting that the altered lineage output of the
cells from the b-glucan group was not due to differences in
reconstitution potential (Figure S2). Together, b-glucan induces
a sustained increase in myelopoiesis.

 To dissect the effects of b-glucan, LT-HSCs isolated
from mice 24 hr after b-glucan injection were analyzed by
single-cell qPCR in terms of expression of genes linked to
HSC maintenance, cell cycle, and differentiation. Hierarchical
clustering analysis revealed that LT-HSCs clustered in three
subpopulations, in accordance to previously published data

 (Yang et al., 2017). Relative to LT-HSCs from PBS-treated
mice, LT-HSCs from b-glucan-treated mice showed higher

 We next sorted CD41� and CD41+ LT-HSCs isolated from
mice 24 hr after b-glucan or PBS injection and performed sin-
gle-cell qPCR analysis. We found that the expression of the
cell-cycle-associated genes Cdc20, Ccnb2, and Cdkn2d; of
the TFs Meis1, Gata1, Gfi1b, and Gata2; and of the differentiation
markers Itga2b, Cd34, and Cd48 was enhanced in CD41+ LT-
HSCs (but not in CD41� LT-HSCs) from b-glucan-treated mice,
as compared to CD41+ LT-HSCs from PBS control-treated
mice (Figures 3D and 3E). These data suggest that b-glucan
acts predominantly on myeloid-biased CD41+ LT-HSCs.
Training with b-Glucan Mediates a Favorable Response
to Secondary Challenge and Protects from
Chemotherapy-Induced Myelosuppression
We next continued to test whether training with b-glucan could
improve the response of hematopoietic progenitors to a second-
ary stimulus that induces emergency myelopoiesis. LPS-medi-
ated systemic inflammation induces hematopoietic progenitor
expansion, which facilitates the restoration of BM cellularity
and compensates for the increased need for mature myeloid
cells (Mitroulis et al., 2017; Nagai et al., 2006; Takizawa et al.,

 2017). Therefore, mice were injected with a single dose of LPS
28 days after b-glucan or PBS administration, and BM analysis
was performed after another 24 hr. Priming with b-glucan
resulted in a more favorable response to the secondary LPS
challenge 28 days later, as shown by more pronounced expan-
sion of the LSK and MPP pools (Figures 4A–4C). Administration
of LPS induces DNA damage in HSPCs due to replication stress,
thereby leading to their functional decline (Takizawa et al., 2017).
To address whether priming with b-glucan protects against
replication stress induced by the secondary LPS challenge, we
stained for phosphorylated H2AX (g-H2AX), a marker of the
DNA-damage response. Indeed, the frequency of g-H2AX+ LT-
HSCs at 24 hr after the secondary LPS challenge was signifi-
cantly decreased in mice trained with b-glucan, as compared
to mice that received PBS (Figure 4D). No difference in the
frequency of g-H2AX+ LT-HSCs was observed prior to the
secondary LPS challenge in mice treated with b-glucan or PBS
at 28 days after treatment (Figure 4D). Thus, b-glucan pre-treat-
ment mediated a long-term protective response that mitigated
DNA damage in LT-HSCs induced by the secondary acute LPS
challenge 28 days after initial b-glucan administration.
We subsequently studied the effects of b-glucan on the recov-
ery of hematopoiesis in two models of chemotherapy-induced
myeloablation (Trumpp et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2008).
Upon repeated rounds of cyclophosphamide administration,
we observed that training with b-glucan resulted in increased
numbers of white blood cells and, especially, Gr1+CD11b+ gran-
ulocytes in peripheral blood on day 4 after each cyclophospha-
mide round (Figures 4E–4G). Additionally, we used a 5-fluoracil
(5-FU) suicide assay to study whether b-glucan can promote
host survival upon cytotoxic stress (Figure 4H). Notably,
b-glucan significantly enhanced mouse survival to repeated
rounds of 5-FU administration (Figure 4I), suggesting that
b-glucan improved chemoresistance of HSPCs. Moreover,

 training with b-glucan 7 days before administration of a single
dose of 5-FU improved the recovery of neutrophil numbers in
the circulation (Figure 4J). Furthermore, we found a decrease
in the frequency of g-H2AX+ LT-HSCs at day 14 after a single
dose of 5-FU in mice that were pre-treated with b-glucan (Fig-
ure 4K). Together, b-glucan-induced trained immunity in mice
mediates a protective hematopoiesis response to a secondary
challenge represented by myeloablative chemotherapy.
b-Glucan-Induced Myelopoiesis Is Associated with
Metabolic Changes in Progenitors
We next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of LT-HSCs
from mice on day 7 after b-glucan or PBS administration. We
identified 1,683 differentially expressed genes (false discovery
rate [FDR = 0.05]) in cells from the b-glucan-injected group,
compared to those from PBS-treated mice (Figure 5A). Ingenuity
pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated that pathways involved in

 innate immune function and pathways of cell metabolism,
including glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and especially
the mevalonate pathway, were overrepresented in the upregu-
lated genes (Figure 5B). In contrast, pathways involved in
lymphocyte development and function were overrepresented
in the downregulated genes (Figure 5B). Upregulation of myeloid
lineage markers, including Csf2rb, Elane, and Mpo, and downre-
gulation of lymphoid lineage markers, such as Ms4a1, Il7r, Il2ra,
Vpreb1, and Rag1, were also observed in LT-HSCs of b-glucan-
treated mice (Figure 5C). Consistently, TFs promoting myelopoi-
esis (Cebpe, Id1, and Id2) were upregulated in LT-HSCs from
b-glucan-treated mice, while lymphopoiesis-related TFs (Pax5,
Ebf1, Irf4, Spib, and Lef1) were downregulated (Nimmo et al.,
2015; Novershtern et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2015; Rosenbauer
and Tenen, 2007) (Figure 5D). Additionally, genes regulated by
the myeloid-lineage TF Cebpe and the lymphoid-lineage TF
Pax5 were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, in
LT-HSCs from b-glucan-treated mice compared to LT-HSCs
from PBS-treated mice (Figure S3). The sustained nature of the
b-glucan-induced alterations in LT-HSCs and CD48+CD150�
MPPs was further strengthened by transcriptomic analysis at
28 days post-b-glucan injection (Figure S4). IPA revealed a nega-
tive correlation between b-glucan-dependent transcriptomic al-
terations and lymphoid lineage gene signature in LT-HSCs and in
MPPs (Figures S4A–S4D). Gene expression of the lymphoid cell
markers Il2ra, Rag2, Vpreb1, Blnk, and Ms4a1 was downregu-
lated in both cell populations in b-glucan-treated mice (Figures
S4E and S4F).
Besides typical pathways linked to innate immunity, choles-
terol biosynthesis and glycolysis were among the highest
enriched pathways at 7 days post-b-glucan injection (Figure 5B).
Regarding metabolic pathways, gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)
hallmark gene set collection (Liberzon et al., 2015) showed a
significant positive correlation with glycolysis and cholesterol
homeostasis gene sets in LT-HSCs from b-glucan-treated
mice (Figure 5E; Table S1). Specifically, genes encoding key
regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (Hk3, Pfkp, and
Pkm) and the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate
pathways (G6pdx) were significantly upregulated (Figure 5F).
Concerning cellular cholesterol homeostasis and the mevalo-
nate pathway, there was a significant upregulation in the expres-
sion of several genes (Figure S5), including those encoding the
rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis HMG-CoA
(coenzyme A) reductase (Hmgcr) and the low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor (Ldlr) that regulates LDL uptake, and a downregu-
lation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1),
which mediates cholesterol efflux (Figure 5F). These findings
suggest an increased demand for cell cholesterol and enhanced
cellular cholesterol biosynthesis and retention in LT-HSCs upon
b-glucan treatment.
We next assessed cellular bioenergetics in BM progenitors. We
sorted cKit+ progenitors (Lin�cKit+), which include HSPCs and
MyPs, from mice at 24 hr after b-glucan or PBS injection and
performed bioenergetic flux analysis. Both under steady-state
conditions and upon metabolic stress induced by the ATP syn-
thase inhibitor oligomycin, we observed increased extracellular
acidification rates (ECARs) in cells from b-glucan-treated mice
(Figure 5G), thus suggesting the upregulation of glycolysis. These
changes in energy metabolism were further associated with upre-
gulated gene expression of glycolytic enzymes in LSK cells from
b-glucan-treated mice (Figure 5H). The enhanced response of
cKit+ progenitors to metabolic stress, as shown by the cellular
response to oligomycin, was also found at 7 days after b-glucan
administration (Figure 5I). These data suggest that the early pro-
liferative phase after b-glucan administration involves a global
increase in energy metabolism in BM progenitors.
Since cell metabolism in LT-HSCs is linked to LT-HSC mainte-
nance (Ito et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2011; Takubo et al., 2013;
Wang et al., 2014; Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010), we investigated
whether the b-glucan-induced metabolic changes in LT-HSCs
were sustained also after 5-FU administration, thereby accompa-
nying the beneficial response to chemotherapy-induced hemato-
poietic stress upon b-glucan injection (as shown in Figure 4). To
this end, mice received a single injection of 5-FU on day 7 after
b-glucan or PBS administration, and RNA-seq was performed in
LT-HSCs isolated on day 14 after 5-FU injection. GSEA revealed
a positive correlation between LT-HSCsfrom the b-glucan-trained
group with the glycolysis and cholesterol homeostasis gene sets
and a negative correlation with the OXPHOS gene set (Figure S6;
Table S2). Thus, b-glucan-dependent enhanced glycolysis of
LT-HSCs persists after severe hematopoietic stress.
Trained Immunity Links Innate Immune Signaling to
Metabolic Alterations in Progenitor Cells
We next analyzed in more detail the b-glucan-induced meta-
bolic changes by performing metabolomics and quantitative
shotgun lipidomics of BM progenitor cells. Metabolomic anal-
ysis in cKit+ progenitors derived from mice at 24 hr after
b-glucan injection revealed a reduction in metabolites involved
in linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolism, compared to cells
from the control group (Figures 6A and 6B). These findings,
together with those of the transcriptomic analysis, which indi-
cated alterations in cellular cholesterol biosynthesis pathways,
prompted us to further assess lipid metabolism by lipidomic
analysis in cKit+ progenitor cells from b-glucan- or PBS-treated
mice at the 24-hr time point. The shotgun lipid mass spectrom-
etry detects hundreds of lipid species present in the cells; how-
ever, in the present experimental approach, we did not perform
an analysis of the free fatty acids, which had been covered
by the metabolomic analysis. Principal-component analysis
(PCA) of the lipidomic data suggested significant differences
in the lipidomes of the BM progenitors from b-glucan-trained
mice compared to the PBS group (Figure 6C). Significant differ-
ences were observed in certain lipid classes (Figure 6D).
Whereas cells from b-glucan-trained mice contained substan-
tially more lipids with shorter (34–36 carbon atoms) and more
saturated acyl chains (having none, one, or two double bonds),
cells from the PBS-treated control group contained lipids
with longer acyl chains (38–42 carbon atoms) and increased
levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (R3 double bonds)
(Figures 6E and 6F). An accumulation of various species of
cholesterol esters (CEs) and a decrease of a number of
species

 alkyl-ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines [PEO]�, respec-
tively), sphingomyelins, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidyl-
serines, and lysophospatidic acid was observed in cells
from b-glucan-treated mice (Figure 6G). Consistent with the
metabolomics data, we observed a decrease in the majority
of lipids containing arachidonic acid (20:4) in cells from
b-glucan-treated mice (Figure 6H). Therefore, lipid changes
accompany trained-immunity-associated effects on hemato-
poietic progenitors.
Since HSCs do not express the b-glucan receptor Dectin-1
(Ya
´ n
˜ ez et al., 2011), we sought to determine whether the effects
of b-glucan on HSCs are mediated by cytokines induced in the
BM in response to b-glucan administration. Cytokine analysis
in the BM extracellular fluid at 24 hr following b-glucan adminis-
tration revealed, in addition to an elevated concentration of
G-CSF, enhanced levels of IL-1b, whereas the levels of other
cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)g, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p70,
were not altered (Figure 7A). We thus next sought to identify
the potential role of IL-1b-related BM inflammation in the
b-glucan effects on BM progenitor cells.
Pharmacologic inhibition of IL-1 by an IL-1 receptor antago-
nist (IL1RA; anakinra) prevented the increase in cell-cycle
progression of LT-HSCs at 24 hr after the administration of
b-glucan (Figure 7B). IL1RA also inhibited the b-glucan-induced
increase in the frequency of MPP3 cells in the LSK population
and resulted in a corresponding increase in the frequency
of
MPP4
cells
(Figure
7C).
Moreover,
IL1RA
prevented
the b-glucan-dependent
increase in glycolysis
(ECAR) at
24 hr following b-glucan injection (Figure 7D). To investigate a
possible direct link between IL-1b production and metabolic
alterations in HSPCs, isolated LSK cells were treated ex vivo
with IL-1b for 24 hr, and bioenergetic analysis was performed.
In accordance with the in vivo findings, IL-1b induced an
increase in ECAR and resulted in enhanced glycolytic reserve
of LSK cells (Figure 7E). These data suggest that, upon
b-glucan administration, IL-1 signaling promotes glycolysis
and HPSC proliferation.
To more rigorously implicate IL-1b signaling and glycolysis in
the b-glucan-induced innate immune-metabolic crosstalk within
the BM, we studied the effects of IL1RA or of 2-DG, a pharmaco-
logic inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase, on the
b-glucan-dependent expansion of HSPCs observed on day 7
post-b-glucan injection. Inhibition of either IL-1 signaling or
glycolysis reduced the numbers of HSPCs and GMPs in
b-glucan-trained mice (Figures 7F–7H). Moreover, inhibition of
IL1R or glycolysis in b-glucan-trained mice decreased the
proportion of GMPs among MyPs, as compared to b-glucan
administration alone (Figure 7I).
Previous studies have shown that disruption of cholesterol
efflux drives myeloid cell expansion by increasing the surface
expression of CD131, the common b subunit of the IL-3/GM-
CSF receptor (IL-3Rb) (Murphy et al., 2011; Yvan-Charvet
et al., 2010). Since we observed enhanced cholesterol biosyn-
thesis and reduction in gene expression of factors involved in
cholesterol efflux in hematopoietic progenitors from b-glucan-
trained mice, we next assessed the expression of CD131 in
HSPCs. We detected a significant increase in CD131+ LSKs,
CD131+ MPPs, and CD131+ LT-HSCs 24 hr after b-glucan injec-
tion (Figures 7J and 7K). We further assessed whether the
increased expression of CD131 was associated with enhanced
downstream
signaling.
Indeed,
phosphorylation
of
STAT5
(pSTAT5) was increased in LSK cells from b-glucan-injected
mice at 24 hr, as compared to control-treated mice (Figure 7L).
Therefore,
b-glucan-associated
trained
immunity
causes
changes in lipid metabolism associated with increased fre-
quency of CD131-expressing HSPCs.
We also assessed the role of cholesterol biosynthesis in
b-glucan-dependent effects on HSPCs. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-
3-methylglutaryl (HMG-CoA) reductase with atorvastatin in
b-glucan-trained mice reduced the numbers of LSKs and MPPs,
as compared to b-glucan administration alone (Figures 7M–7O),
resulting also in decreased frequency of GMPs (Figure 7P). In
line with a role of the GM-CSF/CD131 axis for the b-glucan-
dependent effects on HSPCs, antibody-mediated blockade of

 GM-CSF in b-glucan-trained mice diminished the numbers of he-
matopoietic progenitors, as compared to b-glucan injection alone
(Figures 7Q–7S). Together, the effects of b-glucan on HSPCs are
associated with IL-1b signaling, key metabolic adaptations, and
enhanced activation of the GM-CSF/CD131 axis.
DISCUSSION
Preservation of immune homeostasis after infection is achieved
not only through containment or eradication of the insulting
pathogen but also through adaptations that limit or repair tissue
damage or dysfunction and prepare the host against a second-
ary challenge. Although the latter property has been hitherto
considered an exclusive hallmark of adaptive immunity, this
dogma has been recently challenged. In this regard, innate
immune training has been shown to cause long-term alterations
in mature innate immune cells, enabling a robust innate host
response to a secondary stimulus (Jensen et al., 2015; Netea
and van Crevel, 2014; Netea et al., 2016). Because mature innate
immune cells, such as monocytes, have a short lifespan in the
circulation relative to the duration of trained immunity, the ques-
tion arose as to whether trained immunity acts at the level of their
cellular precursors. Herein, we show that b-glucan-induced
trained immunity promotes HSPC expansion and enhances
myelopoiesis, thereby conferring a protective response to a
secondary challenge represented by systemic inflammation or
chemotherapy-induced myeloablation. Thus, not only does
trained immunity affect mature myeloid cells, but its effects
may also be initiated by adaptations in the precursor cells of
the innate immune system in the BM.
Administration of b-glucan increased the frequency of the
myeloid-biased subsets of LT-HSCs and MPPs in the BM. This
finding was in line with transcriptome analysis in LT-HSCs, which
demonstrated enrichment of innate immune-related pathways at
the expense of pathways related to lymphocyte development and
function. The finding that b-glucan treatment induced increased
transcription of cell-cycle-related genes in CD41+ LT-HSCs sug-
gests the selective expansion of myeloid-biased cells as the likely
target of trained immunity in the BM. Conceivably, trained immu-
nity could also instruct primitive LT-HSCs toward myeloid differ-
entiation, which is unclear at this point. Identifying the subsets
of HSPCs that are responsive to signals related to innate immune
training requires further investigation. Future studies, including
additional transcriptional and epigenetic approaches at the sin-
gle-cell level, may reveal whether the long-term impact of trained
immunity on myeloid cells is initiated at the level of primitive HSCs
or lineage-committed populations.
Additionally, b-glucan-induced trained immunity was asso-
ciated with alterations in metabolic pathways in progenitor
cells, such as glycolysis and cholesterol metabolism, which
also accompany the induction of trained innate immunity in
mature cells and are involved in innate immune cell adaptation
to diverse stimuli (Arts et al., 2016b; Cheng et al., 2014; Mills
and O’Neill, 2016; Norata et al., 2015). LT-HSCs depend on
glycolysis for their maintenance (Simsek et al., 2010; Takubo
et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014), whereas the activation of
OXPHOS is associated with their functional impairment, loss
of self-renewal potential, and induction of DNA damage
(Suda et al., 2011; Takizawa et al., 2017; Takubo et al.,
2013; Walter et al., 2015). In b-glucan-treated mice, progenitor
cells showed enhanced glycolysis. Importantly, this glycolytic
signature was retained after chemotherapy and was associ-
ated with resistance to DNA damage upon hematopoietic
stress, induced by systemic LPS challenge or chemotherapy.
Hence, the metabolic alterations conferred by trained immu-
nity may contribute to the protection from chemotherapy-
induced myelosuppression.
Trained immunity mediated by b-glucan also induced changes
in lipid metabolism in progenitors, such as increased gene
expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and
decreased expression of Abca1, a transporter regulating choles-
terol efflux (Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010). Importantly, atorvastatin-
mediated blocking of cholesterol synthesis diminished the
b-glucan-dependent expansion of HSPCs. Similar changes in
lipid metabolism induced by blocking cholesterol efflux were pre-
viously shown to promote myeloid cell expansion in the BM via
enhanced CD131 surface expression (Murphy et al., 2011;
Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010). Consistently, b-glucan administration
in mice not only upregulated CD131 expression in HSPCs but also
activated downstream signaling, as revealed by STAT5 phos-
phorylation. The ability of b-glucan to increase the biosynthesis
and retention of cholesteryl esters and substantially decrease
glycerophospholipid-containing arachidonic fatty acid chains re-
flects the capacity of cells to actively remodel their lipidome and,
thus, the physicochemical properties of their membranes. This
adaptive response has direct implications in the lateral organiza-
tionofcellularmembranes(Sezginetal.,2017)andincellsignaling
by lipid-proteininteractions (Coskun andSimons,2011). In thisre-
gard, alterations in the cholesterol composition of the membrane
can influence the localization and signaling capacity of CD131
(Kaul et al., 2016; Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010).
In emergency myelopoiesis, cell-fate decision already takes
place at the level of non-committed progenitors (Boettcher and
Manz, 2017). Myeloid-lineage priming is regulated by a complex
interplay between myeloid-specific growth factors, cytokines,
and TFs (Boettcher and Manz, 2017; Sarrazin and Sieweke,
2011). IL-1 promotes proliferation and myeloid differentiation in
HSPCs by inducing a PU.1-based myeloid gene program
(Pietras et al., 2016). Herein, we showed that b-glucan injection
resulted in increased levels of IL-1b in the BM, presumably
promoting a microenvironment tailored toward myelopoiesis.
Our finding that b-glucan training promotes myelopoiesis
recovery after chemotherapy is likely dependent on its ability
to elevate IL-1b, which was previously associated with enhanced

 restoration of myelopoiesis after myeloablation (van der Meer
et al., 1988; Nakai and Hirai, 1989).
The b-glucan-induced expansion of HSPCs resembles induc-
tion of an emergency myelopoiesis response (Boettcher and
Manz, 2017). However, other types of emergency myelopoiesis,
including LPS-induced inflammation, usually induce LT-HSC
injury and exhaustion and, hence, myelosuppression (Chen
et al., 2010; Takizawa et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). Indeed,
in the context of emergency myelopoiesis, LPS-induced cell
stress inflicts DNA damage in LT-HSCs that is maintained for
more than 14 days (Takizawa et al., 2017). Strikingly, this adverse
effect is significantly reversed by priming with b-glucan as shown
herein. Thus, b-glucan does not cause impairment of HSPC
function and exhaustion but rather mediates a protective effect
on hematopoiesis, which can thereby respond favorably to a
secondary inflammatory challenge or chemotherapy. In conclu-
sion, the actions of trained innate immunity on precursor cells of
the innate immune system in the BM can be therapeutically
exploited to counteract the adverse effects of chemotherapy-
induced myelosuppression.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
C57BL/6-CD45.1 B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (B6/SJL) mice were from Jackson Laboratories. C57BL/6 male mice (from Janvier
Laboratories and Jackson Laboratories) were used at the age of 9-11 weeks. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free
conditions on a standard 12/12h light/dark cycle. Food and water was provided ad libitum. Animal experiments were
approved by the Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University
of Pennsylvania.
METHOD DETAILS
Mouse experiments
To study the effect of b-glucan administration on hematopoietic progenitor cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1mg of
b-glucan peptide from Trametes versicolor (Invivogen) in 200 mL of PBS; as control, i.p. injections of PBS alone were performed; mice
were euthanized 1, 7 or 28 days later. In other experiments, LPS was used as a secondary challenge. Specifically, LPS from E. coli
O111:B4 (Invivogen; 35 mg per mouse) or PBS as control were injected i.p. into mice pretreated with b-glucan or PBS; mice were
euthanized 24h after the LPS injection.
To assess lineage output of LT-HSC, the CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system was used. Sorted LT-HSC (50 cells per recipient) iso-
lated from CD45.2+ mice on day 28 post-administration of b-glucan or PBS were retro-orbitally transferred into lethally (9Gy) irradi-
ated B6/SJL (CD45.1) recipients along with 2x105 CD45.1+ carrier cells (to ensure survival). The percentage of different CD45.2+ cell
populations was assessed at 12 weeks post transplantation. Irradiated recipient mice were kept on antibiotic-containing water for
2 weeks after irradiation.
IL-1 inhibition was performed by i.p. administration of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA, Anakinra, Amgen GmbH,
100mg/kg body weight per dose) for one or two days (Cutando et al., 2013). Inhibition of glycolysis was performed by i.p. injection
of 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2-DG) (Sigma; 500mg/kg body weight per dose) twice for two consecutive days. GM-CSF inhibition was per-
formed by i.p. administration of LEAF purified anti-mouse GM-CSF antibody (Biolegend; clone MP1-22E9; 100 mg per dose) twice for
two consecutive days. LEAF purified rat IgG2a, k was used as isotype control (Biolegend; clone RTK2758; 100 mg per dose). Inhibition
of cholesterol pathway was performed by administering atorvastatin (Calbiochem; 125 mg per dose) (Arts et al., 2016b) twice for two
consecutive days.
Chemotherapy-induced myeloablation with 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) (Sigma; 150 mg/kg body weight) was performed using two
different protocols: (i) PBS or b-glucan were administered i.p. on day �7 and 5-FU was given once (day 0); blood cell population anal-
ysis was performed on days 4 and 9 post 5-FU injection and mice were euthanized on day 14 post 5-FU injection; peripheral blood
analysis was performed using a Sysmex XT2000 blood analyzer (Sysmex Corporation). (ii) PBS or b-glucan peptide was injected i.p.
once every 20 days starting on day �5. 5-FU was administered on day 0 and every 10 days thereafter for 7 rounds. Mice were
observed every other day.
In the cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation model, PBS or b-glucan were administered i.p. on day �7 and every 14 days
thereafter and cyclophosphamide (Sigma) was injected at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight i.p. on day 0 and every 14 days thereafter
for a total of 4 rounds of injection (Winkler et al., 2012). Peripheral blood analysis was performed on day 4 after each round of cyclo-
phosphamide administration, using a HemaVet automatic cell counter (Drew Scientific) for white blood cell measurement and flow
cytometry for the quantification of Gr1+CD11b+ cells.
Flow cytometry and sorting
Cell analysis was performed by FACS Canto II or FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Cell sorting was performed
using a FACS Aria II cell sorter (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Enrichment of Lin— cells was performed prior to cell sorting by negative
magnetic selection using MidiMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec). For this reason, cells were incubated with a biotin mouse lineage
panel (Biotin-Conjugated Mouse Lineage Panel, BD PharMingen) and subsequently with anti-Biotin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
The analysis of BM cellularity was performed with MACSQuant (Miltenyi Biotec). For cell surface phenotype analysis, a lineage cock-
tail (Lin), including anti-CD3e (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5), anti-B220 (clone RA3-6B2),
and anti-TER119 (clone TER-119), anti-Sca1 (clone E13-161.7), anti-cKit (clone 2B8), anti-CD135 (clone A2F10), anti-CD48 (clone
HM48-1), anti-CD41 (clone MWReg30), anti-CD150 (clone TC15-12F12.2), anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 93), anti-CD34 (clone RAM34),
anti-CD45.1 (clone A20), anti-CD45.2 (clone 104), anti-CD3e (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD19 (clone eBio1D3), anti-CD11b
(clone M1/70), anti-Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5) and anti-CD131 (clone JORO50) were used. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo
(Tree Star) software.

Cell 172, 147–161.e1–e6, January 11, 2018
 For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained for cell-surface markers as described in the previous paragraph, fixed and permeabilized
using fixation / permeabilization buffer (Foxp3/TF Buffer Set; eBioscience) and stained with anti–Ki-67 (clone SolA15; eBioscience).
After washing, cells were stained with DAPI (4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride) (ThermoFisher Scientific) and analyzed
by flow cytometry. For analysis of phospholylated g-H2AX and phospho-STAT5, cells were stained for cell surface markers, fixed and
permeabilized using fixation / permeabilization buffer (Foxp3/TF Buffer Set; eBioscience) and then stained with the respective
antibodies.
Immunoassays
To collect BM extracellular fluid, a femoral bone was flushed with ice cold PBS (500 ml; Life Technologies) and the supernatant was
harvested after pelleting cells by centrifugation at 500g for 5min at 4�C. G-CSF was measured using a mouse G-CSF DuoSet ELISA
(R&D), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 (mouse) kit was used for cytokine measure-
ment (Meso Scale Discovery) using a Meso QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument (Meso Scale Discovery), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
In vitro LSK incubation
Sorted LSK cells were cultured in suspension culture 96 well plates (Greiner Bio-One) in MyeloCult medium supplemented with stem
cell factor (20ng/ml, PeproTech). To study the effect of IL-1b on cell metabolism, LSK cells from untreated mice were incubated with
20 ng/ml IL-1b (Peprotech) for 24h. At the end of cell cultures, Seahorse extracellular flux analysis in LSK cells was performed.
Extracellular flux analysis
Real-time extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of sorted Lin—cKit+ progenitors from mice treated with b-glucan or PBS and of sorted
LSK cells, incubated for 24h as described under ‘‘in vitro LSK incubation,’’ was assessed using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent
Technologies). After washing with unbuffered Seahorse XF Base Medium (Agilent Technologies), sorted Lin—cKit+ progenitors were
seeded in duplicate in 96-well plates (105 cells per well) for Seahorse pretreated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). To perform real-time
ECAR analysis in LSK cells, cells were washed with unbuffered Seahorse XF Base Medium (Agilent Technologies), and seeded in
duplicate in 96-well plates (5x104 cells per well) for Seahorse pretreated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). Basal ECAR was measured dur-
ing three consecutive measurements in unbuffered Seahorse XF Base Medium (Agilent Technologies), containing 5.5 mM glucose
(Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 1 mM pyruvate (Life Technologies). After three basal measurements, three
consecutive measurements were taken following the addition of 2 mM oligomycin (Agilent Technologies), to measure maximal
ECAR. Glycolytic reserve was defined as the difference between maximal and basal ECAR. Equal cell numbers in the wells were
assessed by measuring total DNA content using DAPI.
Single-cell qPCR
Gene expression profiles of single cells (cells were pooled from either 3 PBS-treated mice or from 3 b-glucan treated mice) were ob-
tained as previously described (Bonifacio et al., 2015) with some modifications. cDNA was synthesized with Quanta qScript TM cDNA
Supermix directly on cells. Total cDNA was pre-amplified for 20 cycles (1x 95�C 50, 95�C 45’’, 60�C 1’, 72�C 1.50) and 1x 68�C 10’
using the Multiplex PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) in a final volume of 35 ml in the presence of primer pairs for the genes (listed
in Table S3) at 25nM final for each primer. Pre-amplified cDNA (10 ml) was then treated with 1.2 U Exonuclease I and expression
quantified by real time PCR on the BioMark HD System (ª Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA) using the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC
and the GE 96x96 Fast PCR+ Melt protocol and SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with Low ROX (Biorad, CA, USA) and 5 mM primers
for each assay.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
RNA isolation was performed using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer’s instruction. RNA was reverse-
transcribed with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). qPCR was performed by using the SsoFast EvaGreen
Supermix (BioRad, Munich, Germany) and gene-specific primers (Table S4) in a CFX384 Real time PCR detection system (BioRad,
Munich, Germany). Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated according to the DDCt method upon normalization to b2 m.
RNA sequencing
RNA isolation was performed using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN) and RNA was subjected to the amplification workflow of the
SMARTer Ultra HV v2 kit (Takara Bio). Amplified cDNA was successively converted into short read sequencing libraries using the
NEBnext Ultra DNA library preparation chemistry (New England Biolabs). Libraries were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq 2500, resulting in �29–45 million single end reads per library.
Metabolomics
For metabolomics, 2x 105 Lin—cKit+ cells per sample were sorted by FACS in 75 mM ammonium carbonate adjusted to pH 7.4
with acetic acid and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Metabolite extraction from cells was performed twice using 400 mL extraction
solution (acetonitrile:methanol:water in a 40:40:20 ratio) at �20�C. Untargeted analysis of metabolites was performed by flow
Cell 172, 147–161.e1–e6, January 11, 2018

 injection-time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an Agilent 6550 QTOF Instrument operated in negative mode 4 GHz, high resolution in
a mass to charge (m/z) range of 50-1000, as described previously (Fuhrer et al., 2011). Ions were annotated to the ionic derivatives of
the metabolites listed in the KEGG database for Homo sapiens allowing 0.001 atomic mass units tolerance.
Lipidomics
For lipidomics, 2x 105 Lin—cKit+ cells per sample were sorted. Mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis was performed at
Lipotype GmbH (Dresden, Germany) as previously described (Sampaio et al., 2011). Lipids were extracted using a two-step
chloroform/methanol procedure (Ejsing et al., 2009). Samples were spiked with internal lipid standard mixture containing: cardi-
olipin 16:1/15:0/15:0/15:0 (CL), ceramide 18:1;2/17:0 (Cer), diacylglycerol 17:0/17:0 (DAG), hexosylceramide 18:1;2/12:0 (HexCer),
lyso-phosphatidate 17:0 (LPA), lyso-phosphatidylcholine 12:0 (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine 17:1 (LPE), lyso-phosphatidyl-
glycerol 17:1 (LPG), lyso-phosphatidylinositol 17:1 (LPI), lyso-phosphatidylserine 17:1 (LPS), phosphatidate 17:0/17:0 (PA),
phosphatidylcholine 17:0/17:0 (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine 17:0/17:0 (PE), phosphatidylglycerol 17:0/17:0 (PG), phosphatidyl-
inositol 16:0/16:0 (PI), phosphatidylserine 17:0/17:0 (PS), cholesterol ester 20:0 (CE), sphingomyelin 18:1;2/12:0;0 (SM), triacylgly-
cerol 17:0/17:0/17:0 (TAG) and cholesterol D6 (Chol). After extraction, the organic phase was transferred to an infusion plate
and dried in a speed vacuum concentrator. First step dry extract was re-suspended in 7.5 mM ammonium acetate in chloro-
form/methanol/propanol (1:2:4, V:V:V) and second step dry extract in 33% ethanol solution of methylamine in chloroform/methanol
(0.003:5:1; V:V:V). All liquid handling steps were performed using Hamilton Robotics STARlet robotic platform with the Anti Droplet
Control feature for organic solvents pipetting.
Samples were analyzed by direct infusion on a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a TriVersa
NanoMate ion source (Advion Biosciences). Samples were analyzed in both positive and negative ion modes with a resolution of
Rm/z = 200 = 280000 for MS and Rm/z = 200 = 17500 for MSMS experiments, in a single acquisition. MSMS was triggered by an
inclusion list encompassing corresponding MS mass ranges scanned in 1 Da increments (Surma et al., 2015). Both MS and
MSMS data were combined to monitor cholesterol esters, DAG and TAG ions as ammonium adducts; PC, PC O-, as acetate adducts;
and CL, PA, PE, PE O-, PG, PI and PS as deprotonated anions. MS only was used to monitor LPA, LPE, LPE O-, LPI and LPS as
deprotonated anions; Cer, HexCer, SM, LPC and LPC O- as acetate adduct and cholesterol as ammonium adduct of an acetylated
derivative (Liebisch et al., 2006).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Single cell qPCR
Raw data were analyzed using the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR analysis software. Pre-processing and data analysis of single cell expres-
sion profiles was conducted using KNIME 2.11.2 and RStudio Version 0.99.486 (Boston, MA, USA). To model the bi-modal gene
expression, the Hurdle model, a semi-continuous modeling framework, was applied to the pre-processed data (McDavid et al.,
2014). This allowed us to assess the differential expression profiles with respect to the frequency of expression and the positive
expression mean via a likelihood ratio test.
RNA Sequencing Analysis
FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/) was used to perform a basic quality control on the resulting reads. As an addi-
tional control, library diversity was assessed by redundancy investigation in the reads. Alignment of the reads to the mouse reference
(mm10) was done with GSNAP (Wu and Nacu, 2010) and Ensembl gene annotation version 81 was used to detect splice sites. The
uniquely aligned reads were counted with featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) and the same Ensembl annotation. Normalization of
the raw read counts based on the library size and testing for differential expression between conditions was performed with the
DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014). Genes, which have an adjusted p value (padj) < 0.05 and counts > 50 were considered as
differentially expressed. Pathway analysis and upstream regulator analysis of gene lists containing significantly differentially ex-
pressed genes (padj < 0.05, log2FC < �0.3 and > 0.3) was done with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City,
www.qiagen.com/ingenuity). Morpheus software (Broad Institute) was used to generate heatmaps. Top canonical pathways derived
from IPA are shown. To perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene sets were ranked by taking the -log10 transform of the
p value and signed as positive or negative based on the direction of fold change. GSEA pre-ranked analysis (1000 permutations, min-
imum term size of 15, maximum term size of 500) was then performed using the GSEA software (Broad Institute) (Musso et al., 2015).
Annotated gene sets from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) were used as input. Lineage specific genes were selected based
on IPA analysis (Molecular and Cellular Functions analysis). For generation of heatmaps of genes involved in glycolysis and pentose
phosphate pathway we used the KEGG database.
Metabolomics
Data were processed and analyzed with MATLAB.

Cell 172, 147–161.e1–e6, January 11, 2018
 Lipidomics
Data were analyzed with a lipid identification software based on LipidXplorer (Herzog et al., 2011, 2012). Data post-processing and
normalization were performed using an in house developed data management system. Only lipid identifications with a signal-to-noise
ratio > 5, and a signal intensity 5-fold higher than in corresponding blank samples were considered for further data analysis. Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) was computed in MATLAB 9.0 (R2016a) using the Singular Value Decomposition function after transform-
ing raw data to mol% (each quantity was divided by the sum of the lipids in the sample and multiplied by 100). Descriptive statistics
and histograms were generated using base R version 3.3.2 (R Development Core Team, 2016) and packages reshape2 (Wickham,
2007) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009). The difference between the means was calculated species by species on the mol-percent trans-
formed dataset. For each lipid feature we calculated the mean in the two groups (PBS and b-glucan), and subtracted the mean of the
treated samples from the mean of the control samples in order to show whether and in which condition lipid species were more
abundant.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test for parametric variables and a Mann-Whitney U test for
non-parametric variables were used for the comparison of two groups. For comparisons of multiple groups, One-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Holm-Sidak multiple comparison tests was used. In vitro comparison of matched groups was performed with a paired
two-tailed Student’s t test. Comparison of survival curves was performed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. All statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA). Significance was set at p < 0.05.
