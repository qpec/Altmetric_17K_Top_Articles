 In 2010, 16.2% of the world population consisted of people aged
65 or over, a figure that is expected to rise to 26.9% by 2050.1
Increasing life expectancy highlights the importance of physical
and mental health in old age.2 Previous studies have generated
very inconsistent findings about the prevalence of mental illness
among older adults,3,4 although most studies report decreased
prevalence rates in advanced age.3,5,6 Studies have tended to focus
on selective disorders such as dementia7 or depression,8–10 implying
that the entire range of mental disorders has been insufficiently
addressed.9 Previous studies using different study designs have
found lifetime and current prevalence rates of mental disorders
in elderly people ranging from 1 to 18%.9,11 Studies of bipolar
disorder, anxiety disorders and alcohol disorders based on
structured and standardised assessment instruments such as the
Composite
International
Diagnostic
Interview
(CIDI)12
are
scarce.9 Currently prevalence estimates for depression – the only
disorder that is examined consistently – are approximately 3%.9
A few studies report lifetime prevalence rates of substance-related
(in particular alcohol-related) disorders in people 65 years and
over ranging from 1 to 12%; for schizophrenia, schizotypal
disorders and other psychotic disorders, the lifetime and current
rate is estimated at 0.5–1.0%, respectively.9 Rates for anxiety
disorders vary between 0.9 and 6.7%.9 Only one study used the
CIDI to evaluate somatoform disorders in elderly people13 and
found a current prevalence rate of 18.4% (participants were 66
and older from Norway’s general population).13
There is debate over the source and the causes of the
heterogeneity of these empirical results: some authors have argued
that older people may have developed coping strategies over the
course of their lives that enable them to manage their mental
health better than younger people,14,15 whereas others have
attributed the heterogeneity of the findings to a lack of feasible
and age-sensitive standardised and structured instruments for
diagnosing mental disorders in elderly people.16–18 Older adults
with health problems may also deny symptoms when asked to
complete
lengthy
assessments.16,17
Additionally,
important
information on the planning of intervention-based approaches
must consider severity, impairment, quality of life and coping
mechanisms. Taken together, this information indicates an urgent
need to administer diagnostic instruments that have been adapted
to the needs of elderly people.
The aim of the study is to determine lifetime, 12-month and
current prevalence estimates for a wide range of mental disorders
for people aged 65–84 years based on DSM-IV19 in different
European and associated countries using a standardised and
structured interview that was specifically adapted for elderly
people.

Background
Except for dementia and depression, little is known about
common mental disorders in elderly people.
Aims
To estimate current, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates
of mental disorders in different European and associated
countries using a standardised diagnostic interview adapted
to measure the cognitive needs of elderly people.
Method
The MentDis_ICF65+ study is based on an age-stratified,
random sample of 3142 older men and women (65–84 years)
living in selected catchment community areas of participating
countries.
Results
One in two individuals had experienced a mental disorder in
their lifetime, one in three within the past year and nearly
one in four currently had a mental disorder. The most
prevalent disorders were anxiety disorders, followed by
affective and substance-related disorders.
Conclusions
Compared with previous studies we found substantially
higher prevalence rates for most mental disorders. These
findings underscore the need for improving diagnostic
assessments adapted to the cognitive capacity of elderly
people. There is a need to raise awareness of psychosocial
problems in elderly people and to deliver high-quality mental
health services to these individuals.

 participants from each country) stratified by age and gender was
drawn from the population registries in Hamburg and Ferrara
and from postal addresses of market research units in Madrid,
Geneva, London/Canterbury and Jerusalem. Inclusion criteria
for participating in the study included the ability to provide
informed consent, having residence in the predefined catchment
area at the beginning of the study, and being at least 65 and less
than 85 years old. Potential participants were excluded on the
basis of moderate cognitive impairment as assessed by the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE; cut-off score 418)21 or an
insufficient level of corresponding language. A harmonised
procedure in contacting each participant and conducting the
survey was realised, including initial contact by phone and
mail, standardised interviewer training, implementation of a
standardised study protocol for all test centres, and using
stringent, high-quality data-control procedures.
The response rate was defined as the total percentage of
participants who completed interviews in the study compared
with who were contacted with a written invitation letter.22 In most
of the study centres, a written invitation letter was followed by a
phone call to ask potential participants if they were willing to take
part in the study. As a result of ethical regulations in some
countries, potential participants had to write back to indicate their
interest in participating; phone calls were not acceptable. The
response rates varied by country, age and gender. Responder
analyses showed significant differences in the response rate
between the centres (P50.001) and age groups (P50.001) but
not between genders (P = 0.738). The age effect indicates that
the response rate was significantly higher for younger participants
than for older participants. The overall response rate of our study
was 20%, which is comparable with that of previous studies with
similar recruitment procedures.23 Furthermore, representativeness
analysis showed that the differences were small between the
catchment areas in our study compared with catchment areas of
the overall population of the participating countries with regard
to sociodemographic characteristics (such as work status, marital
status and education) according to the effect sizes by Somers’ d 24
(all d50.01); however, these differences were significant because
of the large size of the databases. Furthermore, the minor
differences that were identified are not clinically relevant.
Measures
CIDI adaptation process, structure and training
Mental disorders were diagnosed with an adapted, age-sensitive
version of the CIDI, the CIDI65+.25 This fully structured lay
interview generates diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria.19
The process of adapting the test to the unique conditions of
elderly people included several facets, including adding words,
alternative questions and detailed section introductions, breaking
down long questions into less complicated questions, sensitising
scales upfront and embedding a fuller spectrum of syndromes.
The English paper and pencil version was translated into German,
Spanish, Hebrew, Italian and French with a back-translation and
then computerised. A pre-testing phase was conducted in
Germany and the UK to evaluate feasibility and verify the
acceptability of the CIDI65+ to respondents. To evaluate the
usability and reliability of the CIDI65+, a pilot phase was
conducted.25 Overall, the results on the reliability of the CIDI65+
were good for most diagnoses (such as depression (k = 0.79) and
anxiety disorders (k = 0.69)). Lower k-scores were found for less
frequent disorders such as panic disorders (k = 0.37), similar to
other diagnostic instruments that also report lower reliability
scores26 or that have classification systems that are less precise.25
The interview covers a wide range of mental health problems
such as anxiety disorders, affective disorders, psychotic symptoms,
obsessive–compulsive disorder, substance misuse, somatoform
disorders and acute and post-traumatic stress disorders. Cognitive
impairment, somatic morbidity and the use of healthcare services
were also assessed. The instrument also provides differential
diagnoses for mental disorders because of general medical
conditions.
Statistical analyses
Survey analyses were weighted according to the number of
inhabitants in each country and stratified by gender and two
age groups: 65–74 years old and 74 years or older. The adjusted
lifetime, 12-month and current prevalence rates and 95%
confidence limits were estimated as marginal means from a
weighted logistic regression adjusting for age in 5-year intervals,
gender and test centre.27 Group differences were tested using the
main effect P-value of the model. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence limits were also reported. All analyses were computed
using Stata 12.1.
Results
Sample characteristics
The mean age of the n = 3142 MentDis_ICF65+ participants was
73.7 years after stratification (s.d.= 5.6), and half of the sample
was female (50.7%). Participants had attended school for a mean
of 10.3 years (s.d.= 3.2). The majority of participants were
married (61%), 35% were separated, divorced or widowed and
5% had never been married (Table 1). Approximately 85% of
participants were retired. About half of the participants rated their
financial situation as good or very good (55%), with 8% rating it
as poor or very poor.
12-month and lifetime prevalence
One in two individuals aged 65–84 years had experienced a
mental disorder in their lifetime (Table 2). About one-third of
the sample had a mental disorder within the past year (35.2%,
95% CI 31.0–39.5) (Table 3). There were significant differences
between centres for all mental disorders in the past year except

for panic disorder and major depressive episodes, with the highest
prevalence rates found in Geneva (Switzerland: 47.1%), London/
Canterbury (England: 44.4%), Jerusalem (Israel: 36.7%) and
Hamburg (Germany: 35.4%). The lowest 1-year prevalence rates
were in Madrid (Spain: 32.2%) and Ferrara (Italy: 27.7%).
The most prevalent mental disorders were anxiety disorders
(17.2%, 95% CI 14.0–20.4), affective disorders (13.7%, 95% CI
11.4–15.9) and substance-related disorders (8.9%, 95% CI 6.1–
11.7). Elderly people living in London/Canterbury and in Madrid
showed the highest prevalence rates for anxiety disorder in the
past year (England: 20.8%, 95% CI 15.6–26.0; Spain: 18.3, 95%
CI 14.4–22.3), whereas participants living in Ferrara and Geneva
reported the lowest prevalence rates (Italy: 14.4, 95% CI 11.6–
17.3; Switzerland: 14.1, 95% CI 10.4–17.8). Participants living in
Jerusalem reported the highest lifetime and 12-month rates of
post-traumatic stress disorder (Israel: 5.9, 95% CI 4.2–7.5) (Tables
2 and 3). Elderly people in Geneva reported the highest prevalence
rate for affective disorder within the past year (Switzerland:
25.7%, 95% CI 21.2–30.3), followed by Jerusalem (Israel: 17.8%,
95% CI 12.2–23.3) and London/Canterbury (England: 17.6%,
95% CI 14.7–20.4). Lower prevalence rates were found in
Hamburg (Germany: 12.7, 95% CI 10.6–14.8), Madrid (Spain:
12.4, 95% CI 7.7–17.0) and Ferrara (Italy: 11.1%, 95% CI 8.5–
13.6). The highest prevalence rates for substance–related disorders
were found in Geneva (Switzerland: 12.7%, 95% CI 9.4–15.9),
Hamburg (Germany: 11.2%, 95% CI 9.7–12.7) and London/
Canterbury (England: 11.2%, 95% CI 6.2–16.1). The lowest
prevalence rate for substance-related disorders was found in
Jerusalem with 3.7% (Israel: 95% CI 2.6–4.7) (Table 3).
Current prevalence
Current prevalence rates are shown in Table 4. Nearly a quarter of
the sample were diagnosed with any current mental disorder
(23.3%, 95% CI 19.9–26.7) with the highest prevalence rates
found in Geneva (30.4%), London/Canterbury (28.4%) and
Jerusalem (27.0%). Lower prevalence rates for any current mental
disorder were found in Hamburg (23.3%), Madrid (21.0) and
Ferrara (19.5%).
The most prevalent category was anxiety disorders (11.4%,
95% CI 9.1–13.6), followed by affective disorders (8.0%, 95% CI
6.3–9.6) and substance-related disorders (4.6%, 95% CI 3.7–
5.6).

Ferrara and Geneva had the lowest current prevalence rates for
anxiety disorders (Italy: 9.4%, 95% CI 7.5–11.4; Switzerland:
7.8%, 95% CI 5.5–10.1) (Table 4). The current prevalence rate for
affective disorders was markedly higher in Geneva (Switzerland:
15.6%, 95% CI 11.5–19.7) than in Ferrara (Italy: 7.5%, 95% CI
5.2–9.8) and Madrid (Spain: 6.5%, 95% CI 4.7–8.3). The highest
prevalence rates for current substance-related disorders were 7.7%
in Geneva (Switzerland: 95% CI 7.0–8.4) and 5.4% in Hamburg
(Germany: 95% CI 5.0–5.8); the lowest rate was 2.1% in Jerusalem
(Israel: 95% CI 1.2–3.0) (Table 4).
Discussion
Main findings
Studies of mental disorders that do not focus on dementia or
depression among elderly Europeans are very scarce. This is the
first study to use a standardised and structured clinical interview
for mental disorders adapted to the needs of elderly people to
report lifetime, 12–month and current prevalence rates for a range

 Prevalence of mental disorders in elderly people
of mental disorders in elderly people residing in different Eur-
opean and associated countries. One in two individuals aged 65
to 84 years had experienced at least one mental disorder in their
lifetime, one in three had done so within the past year, and nearly
one in four currently had a mental disorder. The most prevalent
disorders were anxiety disorders, followed by affective and sub-
stance-related disorders.
Comparison with findings from other studies
In comparison with other epidemiological studies of old age9,27
and adulthood3,28 that used standardised interviews such as the
CIDI, our findings show higher prevalence rates, whereby the
proportion of those affected is in accordance with the prevalence
rates in adulthood.3,28 Compared with other studies on old age,
we found higher current prevalence rates of major depression
(6% in our study v. 3.3%),9,27 agoraphobia (3.4% v. 0.5%)9,27
and alcohol disorders (1.4% v. 0.96%).9,27 There was only one
European study from the 1990s that found comparable rates for
current affective disorders, which also used an age-sensitive measure
for depression.29 It is plausible that previous epidemiological
studies underestimated the prevalence rates of mental disorders
in elderly people because they did not use an interview adapted
to meet concerns specific to elderly people. The sentences in the
CIDI65+ were changed to make them easier for elderly people
to understand and respond to, and this may have contributed to
more valid estimates of mental disorders.25 Another reason for
the higher prevalence rates in our study could be that all countries
used the same methodological approach, whereas previous studies
may have underestimated prevalence through use of different
instruments and possible measurement errors. Another important
point to consider is the use of categorical v. dimensional
instruments. There is an explicit difference in prevalence rates
obtained
with
dimensional
and
categorical
instruments
in
affective disorders. Our study builds on established categorical
criteria for mental disorders as defined by the DSM-IV.19
However, due to the multidimensional nature of psychopathology,
the criteria and thresholds of the DSM-IV are not without major
problems.
Reviews
that
compare
findings
for
dimensional
measures of current psychopathology with categorical current pre-
valence typically reveal higher rates for dimensional measures that
might vary depending on the choice of cut-offs that are used.9
There is also a possibility that the presented rates are still under-
estimating the true prevalence of mental disorders in elderly peo-
ple because we excluded people with severe cognitive impairment
from the study.30
Prevalence rates in different countries
The prevalence rates found in our study are comparable among
the participating countries except for fluctuations in the absolute
size. Furthermore, there were several important differences
between the six catchment areas. Interpreting those differences is
complex because of the large differences between the countries
with regard to the availability of mental healthcare, the specific
economic situation, immigration status, living circumstances,
attitudes towards mental disorders in elderly people, experience
of traumatic events and lifestyles.3,31 Such factors may be
associated with greater or lesser willingness and ability to express
psychological symptoms during an interview. Another interesting
finding is the marked difference between the rates of substance
misuse in the southern areas of Ferrara (Italy), and Madrid (Spain)
and the more northern European areas of London/Canterbury
(England), Hamburg (Germany), Geneva (Switzerland); these
results are in line with previous European studies on substance
misuse in adulthood.32,33
Strengths and limitations
An advantage of the current study was the use of a reliable,
structured and standardised instrument that was adapted to the
needs of elderly people. Trained interviewers assessed participants
in catchment areas in Hamburg (Germany), in London/Canterbury
(England), Geneva (Switzerland), Madrid (Spain), Ferrara (Italy)
and Jerusalem (Israel) face to face according to DSM-IV criteria,
and the reliability of the instrument was evaluated beforehand
in a pilot phase of the study.
Nevertheless, the study has some limitations. First, the size of
the sample was limited per country and per catchment area.
Second, the representativeness of our study may be limited
because we found small but significant differences for some socio-
demographic data between our sample and the total population of
the catchment area or country. Third, this study found higher
prevalence rates of mental disorders in older people than did
previous studies; thus, the question arises of whether the response
rate in this study is associated with an overestimation or
underestimation of prevalence compared with previous studies.
However, previous studies have found both higher34,35 and lower
prevalence rates of mental disorders in non-responders.3 Kessler et
al 36 found no evidence for a selection bias related to mental illness
in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). The
authors concluded that to the extent the bias exists, prevalence
estimates may be regarded as more conservative. In addition,
many authors have stated that non-response can, but need not,
automatically mean there is a non-response bias in survey
estimates.37–39 Therefore, it may also be possible that the
prevalence of mental disorders in older people is still under-
estimated in our study. Furthermore, we were unable to include
other important population variables such as educational level
or
financial
situation.
Another
limiting
factor
regarding
representativeness was our set of inclusion criteria: we did not
include people with severe cognitive impairment, homeless people
or people who did not have sufficient knowledge of the language
in which the interview was conducted. In addition, due to the
nature of epidemiological studies with elderly people, we were
unable to control for a possible recall bias, especially regarding
lifetime symptoms.27
Future directions for research
Our study showed a high prevalence rate of lifetime, 12-month
and current mental disorders in people aged 65 to 84 years in
different European and associated countries. The newly adapted
CIDI65+ instrument shows the need for further research in the
diagnostics of mental disorders in elderly people, which is a
crucial
step
towards
more
comprehensive
mental
health
approaches for these age groups. Future studies could investigate
the prevalence of mental disorders in even older people (of 85
years and above, as this age group is growing rapidly). However,
this group may require additional modifications in diagnostic
assessment, as additional challenges are associated with very old
age (for example, cognitive impairment). Future European studies
could also include more countries, such as those from the
Scandinavian or Eastern European regions, and consider including
nursing
home
residents
or
elderly
people
with
cognitive
impairments. Translations into further languages and extensions
to surveys in other continents would be a further milestone. In
addition, data about somatic diseases and their relationship with
quality of life are needed. Additional studies could also integrate
129
 Andreas et al
primary care perspectives into the diagnostics as this is where the
majority of older adults with mental health problems are treated;
thus, this will enable the general practitioner to give advice on
specialised mental healthcare. Finally, further studies should
examine whether the use of services corresponds to the high
burden of mental illness in elderly people.

‘In The Spirit of Rivers’
Jo McFarlane
When I was 25,
a CPN referred me for psychotherapy
to cure my personality.
I was assessed and found wanting
but my need was so great, and my resilience weak,
so how could anybody sensibly take a chance with me?
The litany of traumas I disclosed,
like an automaton spitting toxic pellets,
didn’t penetrate its target audience.
Did the therapist think I was lying, perhaps?
Or was she thrown off guard
by the detachment in my voice?
The conclusion was predictable,
if, at the time, incomprehensible to me.
(The more help one needs, the less one gets).
Disproportionate equations abound in psychiatry:
If you ask for help, you mustn’t need it;
but refuse it and you’re certified psychotic
so they’ll throw away the key.
Side effects of medication are interpreted as symptoms;
blind compliance is a sign you’re in recovery.
Oh would that my brain could shut off so easily!
I was sent away to write a sonnet
Thank you Doctor for ‘saving the poet!’
Naively, at the age of 36, I thought I’d earned the right
to ditch my load, so cap in hand (with money for them)
I approached the Institute of Humorous Relations.
My life experience seemed alien and threatening
to the middle class arbiter of my fate.
On concluding the assessment,
she paused for reflection, then –
as though weighing up a bag of cherries in her hand –
had the cheek to say ‘Let’s not rock the boat’.
Didn’t she give a damn
about the massive hole in the bottom
sucking all the water in!
