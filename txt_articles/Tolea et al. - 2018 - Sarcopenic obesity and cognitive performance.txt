Background: Sarcopenia and obesity both negatively impact health including cognitive 
function. Their coexistence, however, can pose an even higher threat likely surpassing their 
individual effects. We assessed the relationship of sarcopenic obesity with performance on 
global- and subdomain-specific tests of cognition.
Patients and methods: The study was a cross-sectional analysis of data from a series of 
community-based aging and memory studies. The sample consisted of a total of 353 participants 
with an average age of 69 years with a clinic visit and valid cognitive (eg, Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment, animal naming), functional (eg, grip strength, chair stands), and body composition 
(eg, muscle mass, body mass index, percent body fat) measurements.
Results: Sarcopenic obesity was associated with the lowest performance on global cognition 
(Est.Definition1=−2.85±1.38, p=0.039), followed by sarcopenia (Est.Definition1=−1.88±0.79, p=0.017) 
and obesity (Est.Definition1=−1.10±0.81, p=0.175) adjusted for sociodemographic factors. The 
latter, however, did not differ significantly from the comparison group consisting of older 
adults with neither sarcopenia nor obesity. Subdomain-specific analyses revealed executive 
function (Est.Definition1=−1.22±0.46 for sarcopenic obesity; Est.Definition1=−0.76±0.26 for sarcopenia; 
Est.Definition1=−0.52±0.27 for obesity all at p0.05) and orientation (Est.Definition1=0.59±0.26 for 
sarcopenic obesity; Est.Definition1=−0.36±0.15 for sarcopenia; Est.Definition1=−0.29±0.15 all but 
obesity significant at p0.05) as the individual cognitive skills likely to be impacted. Potential 
age-specific and depression effects are discussed.
Conclusion: Sarcopenia alone and in combination with sarcopenic obesity can be used in 
clinical practice as indicators of probable cognitive impairment. At-risk older adults may benefit 
from programs addressing loss of cognitive function by maintaining/improving strength and 
preventing obesity.
Keywords: sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity, cognition, cross-sectional studies
Introduction
Changes in body composition including a shift toward higher fat mass and decreased 
lean muscle mass (MM) represent a significant public health concern among older 
adults as they may lead to various negative health outcomes including cardiovascular 
and neurodegenerative diseases. Higher body mass index (BMI) is inversely related to 
global cognition and subdomains such as executive function and processing speed.1,2 
In addition, higher levels of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology3 and structural 
brain changes have been found in obese adults regardless of their cognitive status.4,5 
Finally, an elevated risk of late-life dementia has been reported in middle-aged obese 
individuals6 suggesting a cumulative effect throughout the lifespan.7 The findings 
are fairly consistent across various measures of obesity.6,8 However, while obesity in 
early adulthood and middle age may increase risk for dementia, later in life it may not 
pose the same risk.9 The exact mechanisms linking obesity to cognitive dysfunction

are yet to be determined, although several pathways including 
sedentary behavior, inflammation, and vascular damage have 
been proposed.7,9
Sarcopenia or age-related loss of MM and function may 
represent another, perhaps even more important, predictor of 
reduced cognition. In epidemiologic studies, sarcopenia has 
been linked to global cognitive impairment and dysfunction 
in specific cognitive skills including memory, speed, and 
executive function.10–13 National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) data confirm the link between 
sarcopenia and cognitive dysfunction in older adults and sug-
gest inflammation as a contributing factor at least in women.13 
Other proposed pathways include behavioral,14 oxidative,15 
and metabolic mechanisms.16,17 In addition, reduced lean 
mass is associated with brain atrophy in AD18 as well as in 
cognitively normal older populations.19 Baseline sarcopenia 
predicts cognitive decline20 and development of AD and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI).21 Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
are also more prevalent once MCI is diagnosed.22,23
Given these individual effects, presence of combined 
sarcopenia and obesity captured by the concept of sarcopenic 
obesity is likely to have an even stronger impact on cogni-
tion. This hypothesis found empirical support in a recent 
cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data, in which higher 
waist girth was linked to poor cognition, followed by low 
MM and finally by the presence of both phenotypes due in 
part to higher insulin resistance in the these groups compared 
to healthy older adults.24 In light of evidence that loss of 
muscle strength (MS) may have a stronger impact on health 
outcomes than loss of MM,25 the current study was designed 
to investigate the association between sarcopenic obesity 
and cognitive function using two sarcopenia definitions that 
incorporate measures of muscle function in addition to MM, 
and also to assess this association in relation to global as well 
as specific aspects of cognition. Based on prior reports, we 
hypothesized sarcopenia alone or in combination with obesity 
to predict poorer performance on global- and domain-specific 
aspects of cognition, in particular executive function.
Patients and methods
Study participants were adults enrolled in research studies 
between 02/2012 and 03/2015. A detailed description of 
these studies has been published previously.11 Briefly, 
community dwelling adults aged 40 years residing in the 
local catchment area (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) 
were recruited via collaborations with local community 
partners, word-of-mouth, educational seminars, and from 
an in-house research registry to enroll in cognitive and 
functional studies. The protocol, which was approved by 
the New Y
ork University Institutional Review Board and 
signed by each participant, was similar across all studies in 
terms of physical and cognitive assessments and other col-
lection procedures. Exclusion criteria were age 40 years, 
nonfluency in English or Spanish, and active psychiatric 
and neurological conditions that could impact physical and/
or cognitive performance or could otherwise interfere with 
participation. A total of 353 participants with data on body 
composition, physical function, and cognition were included 
in this cross-sectional analysis. All study participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Cognition
Performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
test was used to measure global cognitive function. MoCA 
can detect impairment in older adults with a sensitivity of 
90% for MCI and 100% for mild AD26 and also assesses 
several cognitive domains commonly affected in early AD, 
including short-term memory, visuospatial skills, executive 
function, attention and concentration, language, and orien-
tation for a total of 30 points. Higher scores indicate better 
performance and scoring 26 can be used to define cognitive 
impairment in community samples. An additional point is 
added for those with 12 years or less of formal education to 
account for differences in education. In addition, scores for 
individual items were used to measure specific cognitive 
skills including visuospatial/executive function by Trail 
Making B, verbal abstraction, and clock drawing; language 
by naming, sentence repetition, and word fluency; and atten-
tion measured by finger tapping to letter, serial subtraction, 
and digits forward and backward. Orientation to time and 
place was measured by six items and short-term memory by 
delayed recall of five nouns.
The animal naming test, another dementia screening test, 
was used as a second cognitive measure of verbal fluency and 
mental flexibility. As part of this test, participants are asked 
to name as many animals as they can think of in 60 seconds. 
A score of 14 is indicative of cognitive impairment.27 Trail 
Making A (TMA), a measure of visual search speed, scan-
ning, and processing speed, was also included as an additional 
cognitive performance measure independent of the MoCA.
sarcopenic obesity
While the definition of sarcopenic obesity as the combination 
of sarcopenia and obesity is well accepted, its measurement is 
arbitrary due in part to the various ways the two components 
are measured. The definition of sarcopenia evolved overtime

sarcopenic obesity and cognition
from reduced MM to later on to include reduced muscle func-
tion. Baumgartner was among the first to define sarcopenia 
within the former context using dual X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA).28 Using similar methods to derive MM, measures 
that adjusted for body size followed.29 More easily accessible 
methods to measure MM in the clinical setting including 
bioelectrical impedance (BIA) were later proposed.30 More 
recently, reduced muscle function measured as low MS31 or 
low MS and/or poor physical performance were added.32,33
Sarcopenia was measured in our study with the short 
portable sarcopenia measure (SPSM) proposed by Miller et al 
and validated for use in older populations.33 SPSM follows 
the current sarcopenia diagnosis guidelines and incorporates 
measures of MM, MS, and physical performance. Body com-
position was measured in our study by BIA with the BC-558 
Ironman Segmental Body Composition Monitor (Tanita 
Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Handgrip strength 
was measured by dynamometry (Baseline® Digital Smedley 
Spring Dynamometer; Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL, 
USA) in both hands and the mean expressed as kg/m was 
used in data analysis. Participants were also asked to stand 
five times from a seated position as fast as possible and the 
time in seconds was recorded. We used sex-specific cutoff 
points to divide participants in quintiles of lean BMI, grip 
strength, and chair stands. A summary score was derived 
using a weighted scheme in accordance to Miller et al’s algo-
rithm and sarcopenia was defined as the bottom two quintiles 
of this summary score.33 A second formula included low MM 
and/or low MS using the same cutoff. This second definition 
was based on the notion of strength as a measure of muscle 
function. However, given that muscle weakness may have a 
stronger negative health impact than reduced lean mass, we 
allowed an independent contribution of low strength to the 
definition of sarcopenia in our study.
Obesity has been traditionally defined as BMI 30 kg/m2,34 
although other body composition measures such as fat mass, 
percent body fat (PBF), waist circumference (WC), and 
waist-to-hip ratio are often used to capture the concept of obe-
sity using various cutoff points including sample median,28 
highest two quintiles,35 or sex-specific preset values (eg, WC 
102 cm for men and 88 cm for women).34 Obesity was 
measured in the current study not only as BMI 30 kg/m2 
but also as the top two quintiles of PBF to offset inherited 
limitations of BMI as a weight measure.
Using these different sarcopenia and obesity definitions, 
we created four sarcopenic obesity indexes covering vari-
ous aspects of physical function and body composition to 
measure results’ reliability and help discern the contribution 
of individual components/measures (eg, overall vs visceral 
obesity). The first definition combines the lowest two quin-
tiles of SPSM and BMI 30 kg/m2. The second combines the 
lowest two quintiles of SPSM and the highest two quintiles of 
PBF. The third defines sarcopenic obesity as the lowest two 
quintiles of MM and/or MS and BMI 30 kg/m2. The last 
definition uses the lowest two quintiles of MM and/or MS and 
the highest two quintiles of PBF. For each of these different 
definitions, a 4-value predictor variable was created: 0=no 
obesity no sarcopenia group (controls); 1=obesity group (O); 
2=sarcopenia group (S); 3=sarcopenic obesity group (SO). 
The control group was used as the reference group.
Covariates
Age and race (white: 68.3%; black: 24.7%; other: 7%) were 
used as covariates. Sex (female: 65.4%) was not included 
since sex-specific estimates of MM, MS, chair stands, and 
PBF were used to compute our predictor measure. Depressive 
symptomatology was measured with the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS).36 A cutoff of 11 was used to 
indicate presence of depression.
Data analysis
Differences in age- and race-adjusted MoCA means across 
the four classes of our predictor were analyzed using analysis 
of covariance. In general, generalized linear models (GLM) 
and total MoCA and its five subdomains were regressed on 
the predictor using the four different definitions adjusted for 
age and race. These models were run on animal naming as 
a second outcome measure. Also, to account for the impact 
of depression on physical and cognitive performance,37–38 
we re-analyzed the relationships of interest controlling for 
depression. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A p0.05 was used 
to evaluate statistical significance.
Results
Participants were on average 69 years old (8% were 
55 years), female, and white (Table 1). Body composi-
tion, strength, and cognitive data were (all three) available 
in 90% of participants. Of these, 42% had sarcopenia 
according to Miller’s definition, whereas 62% had sarcope-
nia by the second definition. Using BMI 30 kg/m2, 32% 
of participants were found to be obese, whereas 42% were 
in the top two quintiles of PBF. Using definition 1 for our 
predictor yielded the most conservative SO prevalence: 
14.3%, while the highest prevalence (37.2%) was found 
using definition 2.

In GLM models controlled for age and race, SO status 
was associated with MoCA in a dose–response pattern. 
Compared to controls, all other groups performed poorer on 
MoCA. However, the “risk” of poor cognitive performance 
was lowest in the O and highest in the SO, whereas the 
S group performed in the middle (Table 2). For example, 
while the reduction in the MoCA score had the magnitude 
of 1.10 in the O group, the effect was almost triple in the 
SO group (ie, −2.85) with a decrease of 1.88 units in the 
S group (Table 2; Definition 1 column). This finding was 
consistent across all four SO definitions investigated in this 
study. However, the effects are somewhat stronger when PBF 
rather than BMI is used to define obesity. Adjusted mean 
differences in MoCA among the four comparison groups are 
presented graphically in Figure 1 for the two SO definitions 
using BMI 30 kg/m2 as evidence of obesity.
We next investigated the effect on individual cognitive 
subdomains. The results of the models based on the two SO 
definitions using BMI 30 kg/m2 (ie, definitions 1 and 3) 
are presented in Table 3. We found evidence of a significant 
negative association with executive function and orientation, 
where performance was poorest in SO (eg, Est.=−1.22±0.46, 
p=0.009), followed by S (Est.=−0.76±0.26, p=0.005), and 
finally by O (Est.=−0.52±0.27, p=0.060) when compared 
to controls using definition 1. Definitions 2 and 4 yielded 
similar results (data not shown).
To determine findings’ reliability, the analysis was 
repeated for animal naming. As can be observed in Table 4, 
presence of SO as measured by the two definitions based on 
PBF (ie, definitions 2 and 4) was associated with the lowest 
cognitive performance. While the direction of association 
was consistent with the MoCA findings, neither of its two 
components managed to reach statistical significance inde-
pendently of each other. By contrast, BMI 30 kg/m2 failed to 
distinguish between the four groups (data not shown). The SO 
group also showed the greatest degree of impairment across 
all groups when assessing TMA as an outcome. For example, 
using definition 2, we found the SO group to perform the 
poorest on TMA (Est.=15.49±8.26, p=0.062), followed by 
the S group (Est.=15.04±6.97, p=0.032) and finally by the

sarcopenic obesity and cognition
O group (Est.=14.16±6.11, p=0.021) compared to the control 
group. A longer time taken to complete TMA indicates a 
higher likelihood of impairment. While the SO group was 
only marginally different from the control group as indicated 
by the p level of 0.062, in analyses using MM/function as 
the sarcopenia measure of choice, the SO group performed 
significantly poorer than the control group (Est.=23.32±9.38, 
p=0.014 for definition 3; Est.=17.33±8.35, p=0.039 for defini-
tion 4), in line with the MoCA and animal naming findings.
Finally, the effect of our predictor was not significantly 
impacted when models were adjusted for depression, par-
ticularly those models predicting executive function. How-
ever, some evidence of confounding/mediation was found 
for MoCA (Est.O=−0.79±0.81, p=0.329; Est.S=−1.42±0.79, 
p=0.08; Est.SO=−2.33±1.47, p=0.114 for definition 1) and 
orientation (Est.O=−0.13±0.19, p=0.515; Est.S=−0.19±0.17, 
p=0.273; Est.SO=−0.38±0.23, p=0.097 for definition 3) when 
BMI 30 kg/m2 was used.
Discussion
Using a cross-sectional design, we found consistent evi-
dence to link SO to poor global cognitive performance in 
community-dwelling older adults. This effect is best captured 
by its sarcopenia component with obesity likely having an 
additive effect. This effect extends to specific cognitive skills, 
in particular executive function and orientation. Understand-
ing the mechanisms through which this syndrome may affect 
cognition is important as it may inform efforts to prevent 
cognitive decline in later life by targeting at-risk groups with 
an imbalance between lean and fat mass.
The less consistent independent effect of obesity is not 
surprising. Although obesity has been linked to cognitive 
deficits,2 structural brain changes,4,5 and AD pathology,3 its 
impact may be limited to earlier stages of adulthood,9 with 
inconsistent reports in samples of older adults. While some 
found obesity to be related to impaired cognitive function39 
and cognitive decline,40 other reports showed improved

cognitive performance41 and lower decline42 rate in obese 
older adults. The choice of obesity measures may at least in 
part explain these differential effects.9 In our study, when 
measured by BMI 30 kg/m2, no effect of obesity inde-
pendent of that of sarcopenia was detected. However, when 
measured using PBF, obesity was significantly associated 
with reduced global cognitive performance in one opera-
tionalization method (ie, definition 2) but not in the other 
(ie, definition 4). Also, regardless of measurement method, 
obesity was significantly associated with lower executive 
function but not with other cognitive subdomains. To further 
test the hypothesis that the effect of obesity may be limited 
to younger ages, we split our sample into age 65 years vs 
age 65 years. Although an independent effect of obesity 
remained nonsignificant for both age groups, when combined 
with sarcopenia obesity was consistently linked to poorer 
cognitive performance in the younger group, while in older 
adults, that held for some (eg, Est.SO=−0.95±0.39, p=0.018 
for executive function and Est.SO=−2.71±1.13, p=0.017 for 
MoCA using definition 2; similar results found for defini-
tion 4) but not all cognitive outcomes (ie, Est.SO=−2.39±1.58, 
p=0.131 for MoCA and Est.SO=−0.89±0.62, p=0.150 for 
executive function using definitions 1 and 3). Given these 
inconsistent findings in previous work as well as ours, it is 
possible that in older age, the effect of being overweight/
obese is offset by the strong impact of other risk factors 
including sarcopenia on cognition. Alternatively, mainte-
nance of higher fat mass may be protective to the aging brain, 
guarding off against AD.22 However, our results suggest that 
efforts to maintain a healthy weight should be made even in 
later life as obesity may enhance the detrimental effect of 
reduced MM and function.
The impact of sarcopenia on global cognitive perfor-
mance was consistent in our study, retaining its significance 
whether defined based on Miller’s SPSM or as low MM 
and/or MS. This finding is in line with previous reports, 
which have consistently linked sarcopenia to poor cognitive 
function.11,18,20,21 For example, in a case–control study com-
paring early AD patients with cognitively normal controls 
in terms of lean mass, cognitive performance, and brain 
volume, reduced lean mass was reported in the AD group 
and associated with poor cognitive performance and brain 
atrophy.18 In large epidemiologic studies of functional and 
cognitive aging, a protective role of high handgrip strength 
on cognitive health has been reported,20 slowing the rate of 
cognitive decline and decreasing the risk of AD.21 Studies 
using the newer sarcopenia diagnosis guidelines also report 
a strong association with cognitive impairment.10 Although 
an independent effect of sarcopenia was noted in rela-
tion to MoCA, we failed to find a significant effect when 
animal naming was investigated. It is possible that in the 
absence of obesity, the cognitive impact of sarcopenia is 
limited to global cognition and certain subdomains such as 
executive function and speed of processing12,13 rather than 
semantic memory.
Supporting the results of the one study reporting on the 
association between SO and cognitive functioning that we 
are aware of,24 we found that the risk of poor global cogni-
tion is even higher in older adults who present with low MM 
and strength in the context of high fat mass. This is line with 
dose–response associations with other negative health out-
comes including all-cause mortality.43 However, we found 
a less consistent effect for obesity alone when sarcopenia is 
not present. This differential finding as it relates to global 
cognitive performance may stem from several differences 
in methodologic and analytical approaches. While we used 
high BMI and PBF to define obesity in our study, Levine 
and Crimmins used WC, which may be a better measure of 
visceral adiposity24 and therefore more likely to be associated 
with negative health outcomes than other obesity measures, 
particularly BMI.45 Another difference relates to the study 
population, our participants being slightly younger (25% 
were 76+ years), which may have diluted the effects at least 
for obesity.

sarcopenic obesity and cognition
Further, our study contributes to the current body of 
knowledge by identifying specific cognitive abilities that may 
be impaired in individuals with evidence of SO. Executive 
function is reduced in obese older adults,9 and improvement in 
muscular function has been linked to enhancement of execu-
tive function in senior adults.46 In our study, obesity and sar-
copenia were associated with lower executive function when 
assessed independently and even more so when they occurred 
together. Obesity may contribute to the risk of impaired 
executive function through vascular, behavioral, metabolic, 
and inflammatory mechanisms or can result from reduced 
impulse control, self-monitoring, and goal-directed behav-
ior in individuals with impaired executive function47 with 
a negative effect on the ability to maintain energy balance.2 
Sarcopenia, in turn, has been linked to impairments in abili-
ties that relate to conflict resolution and selective attention.46 
Other cognitive skills may be impaired in sarcopenic older 
adults whether or not in the presence of obesity including 
orientation to time and space. How and in what direction this 
latter association may operate should be further investigated. 
Impaired ability to place oneself in time and space can lead 
to loss of independence and therefore identifying modifiable 
risk factors can help this at-risk group age in place.
Several interrelated mechanisms may explain the obesity-
sarcopenia-cognitive dysfunction link including decreased 
participation in physical activity, low-grade chronic inflam-
mation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance,48 all of 
which being by-products of the aging process. Our study 
was not designed to investigate potential mediators of the 
SO-cognitive impairment association due to data unavail-
ability, although there is empirical support for the metabolic 
pathways.24 These and other proposed mechanisms should 
be continued to be investigated in the quest of finding the 
most effective interventions to delay or prevent cognitive 
impairment, muscle impairment, and/or adiposity.
Study limitations relate to the cross-sectional design, the 
population studied, as well as other methodological issues. 
Although we observed a consistent association between 
sarcopenia with or without obesity in our study, due to the 
cross-sectional nature of our study, we were unable to inves-
tigate the direction of this association. Prospective studies 
will be instrumental in assessing the predictive role of SO 
on rate of cognitive decline and/or development of cognitive 
impairment and dementia in older adults. Also, our body 
composition measures may have led to an underestimation 
of obesity. For example, PBF has been found to be underesti-
mated when using BIA as compared to DXA absorptiometry 
in obese children.49 However, a high correlation between 
these two methods of measuring body composition was 
reported in middle-aged adults.33 In addition, depression, 
which can have a negative impact on performance testing, 
may confound the observed effects. However, a sensitivity 
analysis restricted to participants with low levels of depres-
sion (eg, HADS-D 11) yielded similar results especially 
when PBF was used to measure obesity (Est.=−3.08±1.01, 
p=0.003 and Est.=−3.30±1.03, p=0.002 SO vs controls when 
Miller’s SPSM and low MM and/or strength, respectively, 
were used). Finally, some concern may arise from the inves-
tigation of global- and domain-specific cognitive outcomes 
derived from one cognitive measure (ie, MoCA). We sought 
to avoid this potential limitation by incorporating two cogni-
tive measures that were independent of the MoCA: animal 
naming and TMA, with similar results. The screening nature 
of the study under investigation precluded the inclusion of 
a detailed neuropsychological battery to assess cognitive 
function. The consistency of our results that held across 
different SO definitions and cognitive function measures, 
along with the relatively large sample of a racially diverse 
population, and the use of established measures are positive 
indicators that these reported associations are not due to 
chance alone.
Conclusion
Sarcopenia, either alone or in the presence of obesity, can be 
used in clinical practice to estimate potential risk of cognitive 
impairment. BIA and grip strength by dynamometry can be 
easily administered within the time constraints of a clinic visit, 
and BMI is already usually collected as part of Annual Wellness 
visits. Further research is needed to determine whether SO is a 
simple correlate of cognitive performance or also has a role in the 
processes that lead to cognitive loss and dementia. Sarcopenic 
obese older adults may benefit from interventions designed to 
lower the risk of cognitive loss by improving/countering the 
age-related imbalance between MM and function.
