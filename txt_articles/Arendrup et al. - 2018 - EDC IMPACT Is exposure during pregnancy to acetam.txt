Abstract
Concern has been raised over chemical-induced disruption of ovary development during 
fetal life resulting in long-lasting consequences only manifesting themselves much later 
during adulthood. A growing body of evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to 
the mild analgesic acetaminophen/paracetamol can cause such a scenario. Therefore, 
in this review, we discuss three recent reports that collectively indicate that prenatal 
exposure in a period of 13.5 days post coitum in both rats and mouse can result in 
reduced female reproductive health. The combined data show that the exposure results 
in the reduction of primordial follicles, irregular menstrual cycle, premature absence of 
corpus luteum, as well as reduced fertility, resembling premature ovarian insufficiency 
syndrome in humans that is linked to premature menopause. This could especially affect 
the Western parts of the world, where the age for childbirth is continuously being 
increased and acetaminophen is recommended during pregnancy for pain and fever. 
We therefore highlight an urgent need for more studies to verify these data including 
both experimental and epidemiological approaches.
Introduction
There is increased concern about exposure to xenobiotic 
chemicals during gestation through developmental 
disruption that may result in long-lasting consequences 
extending into adulthood, resulting in for instance 
compromised reproductive health (1). Of particular 
concern is mild analgesics (hereafter called analgesics), 
comprising NSAIDs and acetaminophen/paracetamol 
(N-acetyl-para-aminophenol; 
APAP), 
used 
classically 
to relieve pain, fever and malaise, as these are the most 
frequent drugs used during pregnancy (2, 3). This is 
problematic as APAP and the NSAIDs are able to cross 
the placenta and mothers are not always aware of the 
beginning of their pregnancy and not always identify 
analgesics as drugs. For example, in a prospective birth 
cohort study in Denmark, where 285 pregnant women 
completed self-administered questionnaires on drugs 
use in general during their pregnancy and participated 
in a computer-assisted telephone interview specifically 
addressing the use of analgesics, 26.1% reported analgesic 
use in the questionnaire compared with 56.2% in the 
interview (8). Higher frequency of use has been reported 
for example in the USA (Boston and Philadelphia) and 
France, where 76.1% and 89.9% of mothers, respectively, 
used analgesics during pregnancy (9, 10). It is clear 
from these studies that acetaminophen is the preferred 
analgesic among pregnant women, likely due to the fact

that it is regarded as safe during pregnancy and hence is 
recommend by both doctors and pharmacists (2). On top 
of the intentional/therapeutic use of APAP, ubiquitous 
detection of urinary concentrations of APAP indicates the 
existence of possible unintentional (background) low-dose 
sources of exposure (11, 12). The unintended exposure 
may occur by direct ingestion of APAP residues in food 
and water or through exposure to aniline, an important 
source material in the chemical industry that is converted 
in vivo to an APAP (13, 14).
In humans, APAP has a high oral bioavailability (88%) 
and is readily absorbed, and after a therapeutic dose, plasma 
concentration peaks within 90 
min of ingestion followed 
by a plasma half-life of 1.5–2.5 
h (4). The majority of the 
metabolism of APAP occurs in the liver, and to lesser an 
extent in the kidney and intestines (5). After a therapeutic 
dose, APAP is mostly converted to pharmacologically 
inactive glucuronide (APAP-gluc, 52–57% of urinary 
metabolites) 
and 
sulfate 
(APAP 
sulfate, 
30–44%) 
conjugates by phase II biotransformation enzymes, with 
a minor fraction being oxidized to a reactive metabolite 
NAPQI (5–10%), by phase I biotransformation enzymes, 
which is primarily responsible for acetaminophen-
induced hepatotoxicity witness in overdose cases (6). 
NAPQI is further metabolized and detoxified through 
glutathione pathway and excreted as cysteine conjugate 
(7). The majority of glucuronide and sulfate metabolites 
are transported through the bloodstream to the kidney for 
excretion while some APAP-gluc are excreted through the 
bile and later intestines (7).
Several experimental and epidemiological studies 
have in recent years investigated a possible link between 
prenatal mild analgesics exposure and effects on the male 
reproductive system (reviewed in 2). Studies addressing 
comparative questions in females have, however, been 
largely lacking. To our knowledge, only one mouse study 
published in 1992 addresses this issue, showing that pre-
natal exposure to a high dose of APAP (1430 
mg/kg/day) 
 
administrated in the diet resulted in reduced birth weight 
while not affecting fertility (15). These data were contested 
in 2016, when three experimental studies in rodent were 
published suggesting that prenatal analgesic exposure 
could disrupt female reproductive development, resulting 
in decreased follicle number in adulthood (16, 17, 18). 
These data have created concern, as it is generally accepted 
that the mammalian females are born with a defined 
set number of follicles that depletes throughout their 
reproductive lifespan, inevitably leading to menopause 
and infertility. Disturbed establishment of the follicle pool 
during fetal development may therefore be damaging to 
fertility in the adult female (reviewed in 1). In this review, 
we discuss the evidence of the analgesic APAP effect on 
the female reproductive system and advocate for urgent 
development of interdisciplinary research in this domain 
from fetal life to adulthood.
Female ovarian development and windows 
of particular sensitivity for 
developmental disruption
The three recently published experimental studies on the 
effect of analgesics on female development are based on 
rodent (mouse and rat) models. The ovarian development 
in both rodents and humans is similar and can be divided 
into four stages of particular sensitivity for disruption 
occurring both prenatally and postnatally: (i) mitosis and 
migration of primordial germ cells (PGC); (ii) meiosis and 
sex differentiation (iii) germ cell nest breakdown and 
follicle assembly and (iv) follicle recruitment (1, 19).
PGCs are diploid stem cells responsible for giving rise to 
the germline in both males and females. Thus, they are the 
precursors of oocytes and spermatozoa in the ovaries and 
testes, respectively (20). PGCs arise in the extraembryonic 
ectoderm around 5 days post coitum (dpc) and undergo 
mitosis until 7 dpc in the mouse and during gestational 
week (gw) 3 in humans (19). Since the PGCs arise in the 
extraembryonic ectoderm, posterior to the future location 
of the gonads, the cell population undergoes a cellular 
migration that is initiated at 8 dpc in the mouse and 4 
gw 
in human development. This comprises the first stage of 
ovarian development and the migrating PGCs still express 
core pluripotency genes such as Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog 
that are characteristic for early embryonic stem cells 
(21, 22, 23). The exact nature of the migration related to 
proliferation is not clear; some evidence points to PGCs 
halting mitosis until colonizing the gonadal ridge (24), 
whereas other evidence points to continuous proliferation 
during the migration (25, 26). Upon reaching and 
colonizing the undifferentiated gonadal ridge on 12.5 dpc 
in the mouse and 7 
gw in human development, the PGCs 
undergo rapid proliferation to increase the population of 
PGCs and develop into oogonia (27).
Postmigration PGCs initiate the expression of, among 
others, Mvh, which marks the end of migration of PGC and 
the beginning of sexual dimorphic development in the 
undifferentiated gonadal ridge and thus the development 
into primary oogonia (28). On 13.5 dpc in the mouse, 
e16.5 in the rat and 10 
gw in human development (29), 
oogonia with XX genotype initiates meiosis and arrest

at prophase 1 allowing them to be primed for future 
oogenesis, signifying the second sensitivity stage during 
development. On 14 dpc and around 10 
gw in humans, 
the primary oocytes arrested in prophase 1 become 
clustered together in germ cell nests in a structure known 
as ovarian cords (30), either in the developing ovary 
medulla or cortex (27, 31, 32).
Toward the end of gestation in rodents, 2 or 3 days 
prior to birth, from the day of birth in rats and around 
20 
gw in humans, the germ cell nests of the medulla of 
the ovary breaks down (32), signifying a third sensitivity 
stage – the breakdown of the germ cell nests of the 
ovarian cortex starts shortly after birth in mice, and thus 
the beginning of primordial follicle assembly (33). The 
breakdown is associated with a wave of oocyte apoptosis 
and the exact mechanisms involved in germ cell nests 
breakdown are unknown, but the breakdown ultimately 
results in the establishment of primordial follicles (34). 
Importantly, whereas germ nest breakdown and follicle 
assembly happens just before and after birth in rodents, in 
humans, this happens about halfway through gestation. 
It is generally believed that the primordial follicles formed 
at this stage make up the pool of potential fertilizable 
eggs at sexual maturity (19), although there is evidence 
suggesting that this might not be the case (35). Thus, 
any perturbance to the formation of the primordial 
follicles can have permanent consequences on the 
reproductive lifespan.
The primordial follicles of the medulla of the 
ovary activate after birth in rodents but during fetal 
life in humans and constitute the first wave of follicle 
recruitment, signifying a fourth and final stage of 
sensitivity (1). This first wave dominates the ovary up 
until 3 months postpartum in rodents, where the cortical 
primordial follicles become active and constitute the pool 
of oocytes for the remainder of the reproductive lifespan. 
The first wave of follicle recruitment has also been linked 
to puberty onset and activation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–gonadal axis (36).
Experimental evidence of disruption by 
APAP of female reproductive development
The recent published studies all suggest that prenatal 
exposure to APAP by gavage may disrupt female 
development (16, 17, 18), summarized in Table 1. Holm 
and coworkers investigated APAP exposure in C57Bl/6 
mice from 7 dpc-birth exposing pregnant mice to the 
dose that women use (50 
mg/kg/day) and three times 
this dose (150 
mg/kg/day by gavage; Fig. 1). Initially, the 
report shows that APAP exposure resulted in decreased 
anogenital distance index (AGDi) among the female 
offspring. Prenatal APAP has previously been associated 
with decreased male AGDi in both experimental rodent 
models and humans (8, 14, 37, 38), attributed to anti-
androgenic actions (8). How APAP induces a reduction of 
female development and AGD remains enigmatic, but it 
could be speculated that a certain level of androgens are 
needed for the female AGD either directly or indirectly via 
the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. When assessing 
ovaries from 7-week-old female mice, Holm and coworkers 
found that primordial follicle numbers were reduced by 
approximately 50% in the APAP-exposed groups. Whereas 
the numbers of primary and secondary follicles were also 
significantly decreased, the numbers of preantral, antral 
and atretic follicles were not significantly decreased. As 
described earlier, it is believed that the primordial follicles 
make up the pool of potentially fertilizable eggs at sexual 
maturity; thus, an APAP-induced reduction of the pool 
could affect the fertility of the mice. To further investigate 
this, the researchers assessed the fertility of female mice at 
6 months of age after intrauterine exposure (50 
mg/kg/day 
 
by gavage; 7 dpc-birth) and found that the number of 
full-term pregnancies and pups per dam was significantly 
reduced compared to control females. These data indicate 
that the prenatal exposure to APAP may have perturbed the 
fetal development leading to subsequent reduced fertility. 
To further investigate the mechanism and window of 
sensitivity, Holm and coworkers exposed pregnant dams to 
50 
mg/kg/day by gavage of APAP in the period 7–13.5 dpc 
to assess germ cell numbers. Fetuses from exposure and 
control groups were collected at 13.5 dpc and by using the 
expression levels of Mvh, a stable marker for germ cells, the 
researchers found a 47% reduction in expression of Mvh in 
APAP-treated fetuses compared to controls. This reduction 
was only seen in female fetuses, whereas in male fetuses, 
no change was seen. The finding may suggest that APAP 
reduced either the migration of PGC, or the proliferation 
of oogonia, thus giving rise to fewer primordial follicles. To 
further study this potential scenario, Holm and coworkers 
collected gonads from 12.5 dpc fetuses and cultured 
them ex vivo for 3 days in 100 
µM APAP. At this stage, 
15.5 dpc, the female germ cell should have developed 
into oogonia and entered meiosis. Exposure to 100 
µM 
APAP did not significantly change the expression of Mvh, 
suggesting no effect on the number of germ cells. Next, 
the researchers investigated the expression of stem cell 
markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) and differentiation makers 
(Stra8 and Scp3) and found that they were unchanged in

APAP-exposed gonads compared to control ones. These 
findings suggest that APAP exposure in this window 
did not affect germ cell proliferation, differentiation or 
meiotic entry or expression of pluripotency markers. These 
findings from ex vivo gonad cultures suggest that the effect 
of APAP of the developing ovary might occur earlier than 
12.5 dpc, thus on primordial germ cell migration or early 
proliferation and differentiation (before 12.5 dpc). To 
investigate this possibility, low passage mouse embryonic 
stem cells (mESC) was used as a proxy for PGCs, as these 
cells share a similar phenotype (39, 40). Exposing mESC to 
50, 100 or 150 
µM APAP for 74 
h significantly reduced the 
number of cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating 
inhibition of proliferation with no change in cell viability. 
Thus, the effects seen of APAP in vivo, reduced germ cell 
numbers, reduced follicle numbers and reduced fertility 
could be due to inhibition of early mitotic inhibition 
before 12.5 dpc. This suggests a scenario where female 
development is inhibited in the first window of sensitivity.
Dean and coworkers investigated prenatal APAP 
with 7 times the dose pregnant women would use 
 
(350 
mg/kg/day) in a Wistar rat model from 13.5 to 
21.5 dpc or from 13.5 dpc until terminated, at 15.5, 16.5, 
17.5 or 18.5 dpc. The exposure thus spanned the mitotic 
proliferation of oogonia, the first prophase of meiosis of 
oocytes. Initially, the researchers showed the presence of 
cyclo-oxygenase-2 (Cox2) and prostaglandin E2 receptor 
(EP2) gene expression in germ cells of fetal ovaries and testes 
at 17.5 dpc. Although evidence of the role of prostaglandins 
in ovarian development is limited, it is generally accepted that 
prostaglandins are essential for ovulation and implantation 
(2, 41) and has been shown to affect the expression of key 
factors of ovarian development in vitro (42). Furthermore, 
the researchers show that Ep2 mRNA levels were significantly 
reduced in APAP-exposed ovaries at 15.5 dpc compared 
to control rats. Additionally, prostaglandin E2 content of 
ovaries 3 
h after a single APAP administration at 17.5 was 
reduced, indicating an acute effect of APAP.

APAP disrupts female

Next, Dean and coworkers investigated the effect of 
maternal APAP administration on the ovarian development 
of the fetus. They found that following APAP exposure, the 
number of germ cells in the ovaries of fetus at 21.5 dpc 
was significantly lower than vehicle-exposed dams. When 
reaching adulthood, 90 postnatal days (pnd), the weight 
of the ovary was significantly lower in APAP-exposed rats. 
To investigate the mechanism of this reduction of germ 
cell numbers, the researchers show that the expression of 
meiotic entry makers (Dmrt1 and Stra8) and pluripotency 
maker (Lin28) was significantly higher in fetal ovaries at 
18.5 dpc compared to control ovaries. The loss of Dmrt1 
expression was used as an index for completion of meiotic 
entry of germ cells (43, 44, 45). Thus, a higher expression 
at 18.5 suggested a delay in meiotic entry, which could 
explain the reduced number of germ cells observed at 
21.5 dpc. Reduction of germ cell number at 21.5 and lower 
ovary weight in adulthood could suggest a reduced fertility 
in adulthood. Therefore, Dean and coworkers also assessed 
the number of pups per litter and found that those exposed 
to APAP during prenatal life had significantly fewer pups, 
suggesting that prenatal APAP exposure had reduced the 
fertility of the rats.
Having data suggesting prenatal APAP exposure may 
disrupt ovarian development and adult fertility, Dean and 
coworkers investigated if this effect can be passed on to 
later generations. Since the germ cells of the fetus exposed 
to APAP, denoted F1, is the source of the next generation, 
denoted F2, an irreversible effect on the germ cells and 
ovary could be passed on to F2. Mating prenatal exposed 
F1 females to control male rats resulted in significant lower 
ovary weight of rats at age 25 pnd. Furthermore, analysis 
of follicle numbers of F2 females revealed reduced number 
of primordial, primary and total follicles numbers. These 
final experiments by Dean and coworkers may suggest 
that not only do prenatal exposure to APAP reduce female 
fertility among rats in the first generation, but this effect 
may also be transferable to the following generation.
Johannson and coworkers set out to investigate 
perinatal exposure of mixtures of chemicals as well as pure 
APAP doses. Similar to Dean and coworkers, the researchers 
exposed Wistar rats to nearly similar doses (360 
mg/kg/day) 
of APAP during pregnancy. The researchers exposed the 
dams from 13 to 19 dpc and postnatal with a similar 
dose from 14 to 22 pnd. Initially, the researchers found 
that APAP exposure in these two windows significantly

mitosis and meiosis). Johansson and coworkers (18) exposed Wistar rats to APAP (360

reduced the transcript levels of Ddx4 and a trend of 
reduction of Bmp15 at the time of termination at 22 pnd. 
As reduction of these transcripts may indicate a smaller 
number of oocytes, Johansson and coworkers assessed the 
state of follicles at 22 pnd and found that APAP exposure 
resulted in a reduction of primordial follicles compared 
to controls. No change was seen in primary, secondary, 
tertiary and atretic follicles.
To investigate if these effects had consequences later 
in the lifespan of the rats, the researchers assessed the state 
of ovaries from 13-month-old rats. Interestingly, the ovary 
weight was significantly lower in APAP exposure group, 
which was also noted by Dean and coworkers in their 
model. Further histological examination of the ovaries of 
13-month-old rats revealed a significant higher incidence 
of rats with complete absence of corpus luteum (CL) in 
the APAP-exposed group. The mean number of CL was 
also significantly lower in APAP-exposed group compared 
to 
control 
group. 
Additionally, 
histopathological 
investigation revealed a significantly higher incidence of 
ovaries containing follicular cysts and cyst-like structures 
in APAP-exposed group at 13 months of age. These data 
may suggest that the exposure had accelerated the rate of 
age-related changes of the female offspring.
Timing window, mechanism and further work
All three published rodent studies suggest a direct link 
between prenatal APAP exposure and disruption of female 
reproductive development. The reduction in primordial 
follicles, as well as irregular cycling and premature absence 
of CL resemble premature ovarian insufficiency syndrome 
in humans, a disorder usually leading to premature 
menopause (46). The fact that similar phenotypes and 
effects were observed by three independent research teams 
and in two different species of rodents further strengthens 
the notion of a possible cause-and-effect relation.
A possible mechanism or mode of action of APAP could 
be as a disruptor of mitosis early in germ cell development. 
This is supported by the data from Holm and coworkers 
showing that APAP exposure reduced the number of germs 
cells and inhibited proliferation of low passage embryonic 
stem cells. Furthermore, Dean and coworkers showed 
that APAP can interfere with prostaglandin content in 
the fetal ovary, which could also be the root of the later 
phenotypes – APAP is a known Cox2 inhibitor in vivo and 
Cox2-knockout female mice are largely infertile likely due 
to a blocked development of corpora lutea (47, 48). Two 
modes of action of APAP, which are not mutual exclusive, 
seem possible: (i) direct disruption of germ cell mitosis 
and (ii) blocking pivotal developmental prostaglandin 
signaling pathways. The blocking of mitosis of embryonic 
cells shown by Holm and coworkers indicates that the 
former is a possible mechanism, suggesting an window 
of sensitivity during mitosis around the overlap between 
the mitotic and meiotic phase of germ cell development 
– 12.5–13.5 dpc in mice and 15.5–16.5 dpc in rats (Fig. 1). 
This is comparable with the end of first trimester in 
humans, taking into consideration the differences in 
the development between rodent and humans. As two 
of the studies only initiated exposure around 13.5 dpc 
during the rat mitotic phase (Dean and coworkers starting 
13.5 dpc and Johansson coworkers starting 13 dpc), it is 
unlikely that developmental period prior to this point is 
crucial for the APAP-induced phenotype. Recent years’ 
advances in ex vivo developmental models of human 
reproduction using abortion material (49, 50, 51) could 
play a strong role in the forthcoming experiments and a 
focus on the proliferation of PGCs (sensitivity window 
one) or differentiation (sensitivity window two) would be 
reasonable. Importantly, a possible indirect effect through 
alteration of CNS development during development could 
also contribute to the changes in fertility.
Although the evidence produced in rodents is 
strong, there is still some experimental and limitations 
and human relevance to consider. Holm and coworkers 
showed that in utero exposure to APAP from 7 to 13.5 dpc 
reduced expression level of Mvh indicating a reduction of 
germ cell numbers, but this effect could not be replicated 
ex vivo in cultured ovaries from 12.5 dpc. One explanation 
could be that the effect manifests during the middle of 
the mitotic phase (prior to 12.5 dpc in the mouse); a 
phase included in all three studies. Another possibility 
is that the ex vivo experiments did not replicate the 
proper in vivo development and thus does not represent 
a valid experimental setup in this setting. There could 
also be a differential effect between the two species and 
further research should be dedicated to better understand 
this difference.
A limitation of the present study is the number of 
animals utilized. The majority of the present studies have 
been conducted as explorative studies focusing on if and 
how the effect of APAP exposure might affect the animal 
and thus not suitable for large number of animal inclusion. 
Especially the fertility experiments conducted by Holm 
and coworkers and Dean and coworkers on the prenatally 
exposed animals suffers from a low number of pregnant 
animals (n 
= 
8 in the experiment by Holm and coworkers 
and n 
= 
30–36 in the experiment by Dean and coworkers).

APAP disrupts female 
reproductive development?

Another limitation related to relevance for human 
exposure is the doses used in the two rat studies which 
are significantly higher than those typically observed 
in humans under normal administration of APAP. The 
exposure used by Dean and coworkers (350 
mg/kg/day by 
gavage), resulted in 2.5- to 8-fold higher plasma levels of 
APAP than reported in humans after normal therapeutic 
dosing during pregnancy (52, 53). Johansson and 
coworkers used a similar dose (350 
mg/kg/day by gavage), 
while the mouse studies by Holm and coworkers saw 
reduction in primordial follicles with a dose similar to that 
of pregnant women (50 
mg/kg/day). When comparing 
rodent exposure studies to human exposures, difference 
in body size needs to be taken into account. A system of 
allometry based on the body surface area can be applied 
where rat dose data are divided by a factor of around 6 in 
an effort to normalize the dose between the species (54). 
Using such an approach would place the doses used in the 
rat studies in the proximity of the human dose. It remains 
that the rodents as models comes with intrinsic limitations 
due to species-specific responses and phenotype and 
that the effects seen might not necessary be transferable 
to humans. It has been shown that certain endocrine 
disruptive chemicals can produce different phenotypes in 
rodents than in humans or where only a phenotype is seen 
in one species but not the other (55, 56). For example, the 
phthalate metabolite mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate has 
been shown to effect Leydig cell function positively in 
mice (57), negatively in rats (55) and no detectable effect 
in humans (58). Furthermore, interspecies differences 
in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
(ADME) of APAP between mice, rats and humans might 
further complex the translation of observed phenotypes 
between species. For example, while high doses of APAP 
can induce severe hepatotoxicity in mice and humans, rats 
seem to be resistant to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (59). 
Although hepatotoxicity is not explored in these studies, 
it indicates that there might be species-specific metabolic 
responses to APAP. Additionally, although the urinary 
metabolite pattern in the rat differs from that of humans, 
the metabolism in rats has some features in common 
with that in humans and thus has been suggested as a 
useful model to predict human data (60). Nonetheless, it 
is important to notice that the data from experimental 
prenatal APAP exposure studies using both mouse and rat 
models of male reproductive development correlate very 
well with subsequent evidence from human prospective 
association studies.
To further explore the possible link between 
prenatal exposure to APAP and reduced female fertility, 
epidemiological studies are crucially needed. However, 
in the case of reproductive problems in women, such as 
subfertility or premature menopause, the causative link 
is hard to establish because the initiating events occur 
decades earlier than when the adverse phenotypes can 
be observed. There are therefore intrinsic problems in 
conducting these studies in assessing the endpoints. As 
an alternative, ovary scans can be used at an earlier age 
to assess the follicle pool as a proxy for fertility and likely 
time to menopause. Assessing maternal use from either 
urine analysis or reported use is also likely to suffer from 
underreporting, as evidence indicates that pregnant 
women may not always consider APAP as medicine 
(2) and point urine analysis may miss exposures as the 
compound is short lived in the body. Making the scenario 
even more complicated is that the exact nature of the low 
dose ubiquitous of unintentional APAP exposure from 
environmental sources remains to be understood (2).
Conclusion
APAP is used worldwide to treat pain and fever during 
pregnancy. It is therefore of concern that prenatal APAP 
exposure has been linked to decreased primordial follicle 
pools and subsequent reduced fertility in experimental 
studies. These rodent studies suggest that a particular 
sensitivity window may exist in relation to proliferation 
of PGCs and/or differentiation around 13.5 dpc, 
comparable with the last weeks of first trimester during 
human pregnancy. There is considerable incentive for 
further research as the phenotypes observed resemble 
premature ovarian insufficiency syndrome in humans. 
The cause for premature ovarian insufficiency is largely 
unknown (1, 46, 61), but xenobiotic compounds have 
been suggested to be a part of the etiology (1, 62). This 
has raised the concern that prenatal exposure to chemicals 
may compromise the reproductive life span of women. 
Such an effect, even if small from prenatal APAP exposure, 
is problematic in the Western world where the age at 
childbirth is continuously being delayed (63). To follow-up 
on these initial experimental studies, epidemiological 
studies are needed. These are, however, intrinsically 
problematic as the prenatal exposure is hard to determine 
and the causative link is hard to establish because the 
initiating events occur decades earlier than the adverse 
phenotypes. Interdisciplinary approaches are therefore 
needed with the central focus being placed on further 
experimental studies including both rodent models and 
human fetal ex vivo setups to back epidemiological studies.
