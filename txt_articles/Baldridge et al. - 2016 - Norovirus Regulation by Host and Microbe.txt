Abstract
Norovirus (NoV) infection is the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis globally, and can lead 
to detrimental chronic infection in immunocompromised hosts. Despite its prevalence as a cause 
of diarrheal illness, the study of human NoVs (HNoVs) has historically been limited by a paucity 
of models. The use of murine NoV (MNoV) to interrogate mechanisms of host control of viral 
infection has facilitated the exploration of different genetic mouse models, revealing roles for both 
innate and adaptive immunity in viral regulation. MNoV studies have also recently identified 
important interactions between the commensal micro-biota and NoV with clear extensions to 
HNoVs. In this review, we discuss the most current understanding of how the host, the 
microbiome, and their interactions regulate NoV infections.
Noroviruses: Tenacious Pathogens
In the United States alone, human noroviruses (HNoVs) are responsible for approximately 
20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually, leading to over 70 000 hospitalizations and 
nearly 800 deaths [1]. HNoV infections are also a global problem, causing approximately 
US$60 billion in societal costs every year [2]. HNoVs cause a species-specific infection, but 
recent developments are overcoming the historical lack of cell culture and small animal 
models [3–5]. Nevertheless, the direct study of factors regulating HNoV pathogenesis in the 
natural host will always be limited. To counter this limitation, HNoV infections are studied 
in non-human hosts or related NoVs are investigated in their natural hosts as detailed in a 
recent review [6]. Among the available models, murine NoV (MNoV), first described in 
2003, provides the most widely used, readily tractable model system to explore viral and 
host factors regulating NoV infection [7]. MNoV infection is studied in vitro macrophages, 
dendritic cells (DCs), and B cells [4,8], as well as in vivo in mice [9]. Together, these studies 
have revealed novel host pathways critical to the regulation of NoV infection, and facilitated 
the exploration of NoV interactions with the commensal microbiome, a critically important 
player in mucosal infection. In this review, first, we briefly summarize parameters of NoV 
infections including transmission, symptoms, and viral tropism. Second, we explore the 
known mechanisms of host regulation of NoVs, with a focus on innate and adaptive immune

 regulators. Lastly, we detail recent work exploring the interactions of NoVs with the 
microbiota, describing the coordinate effects of host and microbial control of NoVs, and 
providing a comprehensive examination of the complex interactions between NoV, host, and 
bacteria. Future studies of the multifaceted regulation of NoV infection using existing and 
newly developed models will undoubtedly yield new scientific insights that may ultimately 
reduce the global burden of disease.
NoV Infection and Disease
NoV is a genus in the Caliciviridae (see Glossary) family. These non-enveloped icosahedral 
viruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, and are classified into at least 
six genogroups on the basis of their nucleotide sequence [10]. Genogroup I (GI), GII, and 
GIV viruses infect humans, with GII being the most prevalent, while GV viruses infect 
rodents (Table 1) [11]. The NoV genome contains three to four open reading frames (ORFs). 
ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins including viral protein, genome-linked (VPg) and the 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 and ORF3 encode structural capsid 
proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively [10]. ORF4 is only found in MNoVs and encodes 
virulence factor VF1 [12].
NoV transmission typically occurs by the fecal–oral route from contaminated surfaces, food 
or water, and by person-to-person spread [10] but transmission via droplets, through 
aerosolization of HNoV-containing vomitus, can also occur [13,14]. Outbreaks occur in 
places where people gather (e.g., cruise ships, day-care centers, hospitals). They are 
facilitated by the low numbers of virions able to cause infections (i.e., low infectious dose) 
[15,16], high amounts of viral shedding [17], high environmental stability of HNoV [18], 
and a relative viral resistance to disinfectants [19].
After an average 1.2-day incubation period, HNoV infection induces symptoms including 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which typically resolve within 1–4 days 
[17,20,21]. However, viral shedding may occur for weeks to months in asymptomatic 
healthy hosts [22], and years in immunocompromised patients [23]. The latter have been 
postulated to serve as a reservoir for future outbreaks [24]. There is no significant correlation 
between presentation of symptoms and viral burden, duration, or magnitude of NoV 
shedding, but enhanced cytokine responses correlate with HNoV symptoms and suggest 
immune mediation [17]. Complications can occur following acute infection and include 
postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome [25,26], life-threatening dehydration [27], 
necrotizing enterocolitis [28], and exacerbation of Crohn’s disease [29].
NoVs cause species-specific infections. Thus, HNoVs can only infect animal models with 
reduced immune responses [3]. Alternatively, models relying on the natural infection of 
surrogate viruses can be used (recently reviewed, [6,30]). MNoV, a natural mouse pathogen 
endemic to animal facilities throughout the world [31–33], has been the most widely used 
surrogate model. MNoV cultivation in multiple cell types in vitro, the ability to genetically 
manipulate both virus and host, and the use of acute [murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1)] and 
chronic (e.g., MNV.CR6, MNV-3) MNoV strains add to the strengths of this model system 
[24,30].

 The cellular and tissue tropism is a critical determinant of pathogenesis and an active area of 
investigation in the NoV field (Table 1) [34]. Recently, a model was proposed based on 
experimental evidence, whereby MNoVs use microfold (M) cells to overcome the epithelial 
barrier in order to infect B cells, macrophages, and DCs in the intestine, before being 
trafficked to local lymph nodes and distal sites by DCs [35–38]. B cells are also targets for 
HNoVs [4], but other targets exist, since humans deficient in B cells are still susceptible to 
HNoV infection [39]. Recent immunofluorescence analysis of small intestinal biopsy 
samples from HNoV-infected immunocompromised patients revealed the presence of HNoV 
infection in intestinal epithelial cells, CD68+ or DC-SIGN+ phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, 
DCs), and CD3+ cells (T cells or intraepithelial lymphocytes) [40]. A tropism of HNoV for 
enterocytes was subsequently confirmed by cultivating HNoV in human intestinal enteroid 
monolayer cultures [5]. MNoV antigen is also observed in small intestinal epithelial cells of 
immunodeficient signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1)- and 
recombination activating gene (Rag1)/Stat1-deficient mice [41,42]. Taken together, the data 
indicate that both MNoV and HNoVs share a tropism for intestinal immune and epithelial 
cells. However, whether all the same cell types are infected in immunocompetent hosts 
remains to be confirmed.
Cellular tropism of NoVs is determined at the level of virus entry [43]. This was confirmed 
recently following the identification of CD300LF and CD300LD as functional receptors for 
MNoV [44,45]. Expression of murine CD300LF and CD300LD in multiple nonsusceptible 
cells, including HeLa or HEK293T cells from nonmurine hosts, supported MNoV infection, 
while infection could be reduced by competition with soluble protein or antibody [44,45]. 
Expression of human CD300F was unable to substitute for murine CD300LF, nor was 
antihuman CD300F able to block infection, indicating that restriction of NoVs may be due 
to species-specific variation in these molecules, rendering them determinants of species 
specificity. CD300LF and CD300LD belong to a family of type I transmembrane proteins 
with an immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain that can bind lipids in the plasma 
membrane [46]. Both proteins are expressed in myeloid cells, which are known MNoV 
target cells [47,48]. These findings raise questions regarding their physiological role during 
MNoV infection in vivo. Preincubation of MNV-1 with soluble CD300LF prevents mortality 
of Stat1-deficient mice, and Cd300lf−/− mice are resistant to viral shedding following oral 
infection with MNV.CR6 [44]. Whether MNoV establishes tissue infection in Cd300lf−/− or 
CD300ld−/− mice, however, has not been reported. These data pave the way for future 
investigations into the molecular details governing NoV entry.
Another key player during NoV infection is fucosyltransferase 2, or FUT2, whose protein 
expression is critical for susceptibility to most (but not all) HNoV strains [49,50]. FUT2 
activity is required during the synthesis of ABO histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), 
which are attachment factors or receptors that facilitate binding of some caliciviruses to 
cells [51,52]. Some individuals harbor an inactivating mutation in FUT2, which leads to the 
absence of ABO antigens, and these individuals (nonsecretors) have lower susceptibility to 
symptomatic infection [53]. This is likely due to the inability of certain HNoV strains to 
infect enterocytes, since intestinal organoids from nonsecretors are resistant to infection by 
some HNoVs [5]. Antibodies that prevent the interaction between the virus and HBGAs

 correlate with development of protective immune responses to HNoV infection [54,55], and 
current vaccine and immunoprophylaxis strategies under development are aimed at eliciting 
antibodies that block HBGA binding [56,57]. Future studies will be required to understand 
the precise function(s) of different susceptibility factors during NoV infection, which in turn 
may influence vaccine design.
Host Immune Regulators of NoV
Host genes broadly important for immunity are critical in the control of HNoV infection, as 
evidenced by primary or secondary immunodeficiencies, which have been associated with 
chronic NoV infection [58]. The immune response and cytokines in particular may also 
control symptomatology in HNoV infection [17]. Serum T-helper type 1 (Th1), Th2 
cytokines, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were more elevated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic 
patients, despite equivalent viral titers [17]. However, the underlying genetic causes for these 
specific immune responses were not explored. Future work to identify additional human 
genes affecting HNoV infection and symptomatology will thus be important in order to aid 
in vaccine development and treatment. Recent NoV vaccination efforts (reviewed in [59]) 
have relied upon HNoV-recombinant viruslike particles, produced by spontaneous self-
assembly of the capsid protein VP1, to provide insight into immune correlates of protection 
[54,56]. The advent of novel in vitro culture methods for HNoV [4,5] now makes 
development of live-attenuated vaccines possible, and may facilitate defining functional host 
immune responses to HNoV.
Genetic knockout mouse models have proved extremely tractable for interrogating and 
identifying specific host genes regulating NoV pathogenesis (Table 2). Indeed, MNoV was 
first identified in immunodeficient mice highlighting the importance of the type I interferon 
(IFN) pathway, including the type I IFN receptor, Ifnar1, and the downstream transcription 
factor Stat1 in MNoV control [9,60–63]. The production of, and response to, IFNs has been 
consistently shown to be important for MNoV regulation. Pattern recognition receptors for 
viral RNA including melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a retinoic acid-
inducible gene (RIG-I)-like receptor, Toll-like-receptor 3 (TLR3), and nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family member NLRP6 also limit viral 
replication in vivo [64,65]. Pattern recognition receptors stimulate transcription of IFNs by 
activating the IFN regulatory transcription factor (IRF) family members IRF3 and IRF7, 
which additionally control MNoV viral levels [60]. Ifnar1−/− mice, which lack the ability to 
respond to type I IFNs, die upon MNoV challenge [8,9,60–63]. This lethality phenotype is 
exacerbated by an additional mutation in Ifngr1, the type II IFN receptor, suggesting 
combinatorial antiviral effects of type I and II IFNs [61,66].
Interestingly, for persistent strains of MNoV, Ifnar1 does not control viral shedding or levels 
in the gut, but rather, regulates the ability of virus to spread to extraintestinal sites such as 
spleen [67,68]. Fecal shedding of these strains is instead limited by type III IFN signaling 
through Ifnlr1 [67,68]. Intraperitoneal administration of type III IFN cures persistent MNoV 
infection, even in the absence of adaptive immunity, suggesting this pathway as a potential 
therapeutic target for humans [67]. IFN-λ administration is an especially attractive 
approach, as it is a safe treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus [69]. Work in HEK293FT

 cells demonstrated that replication of transfected HNoV RNA is also sensitive to 
pretreatment with type I and III IFN, but unlike MNoV, blocking such responses does not 
affect viral replication [70]. This suggests that there may be alternate ways in which HNoV 
and MNoV engage IFN pathways [70].
After engagement of IFNs with their receptors, downstream transcription factors drive the 
production of a variety of antiviral factors. STAT1, which mediates IFN-stimulated gene 
transcription in type I, II, and III IFN signaling pathways, is critical for controlling viral 
loads, shedding, and lethality, as observed by infection of Stat1−/− mice with acute and 
persistent MNoV strains [8,9,66–68]. Transcription factor IRF1 is important for type II IFN-
mediated control of MNoV in vitro in macrophages, and in vivo Irf1−/− mice exhibit 
enhanced lethality to MNoV challenge in the context of antibody-mediated IFNAR1 
depletion [66]. Other factors downstream of IFN signaling implicated in MNoV control 
include proteins involved in macroautophagy. Mice lacking autophagy genes Atg5, Atg12, 
Atg7, or Atg16L1 in macrophages fail to control MNoV in vivo on an Ifnar1-deficient 
background, and autophagy-deficient macrophages fail to respond to type II IFN-directed 
control of acute MNoV replication in vitro [61]. However, the specific mechanisms by 
which autophagy may control MNoV remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, ATG16L1 is 
also important for preventing intestinal pathology induced by persistent MNoV infection 
[71]. This effect does not appear to occur through direct control of MNoV levels in the gut, 
as mice hypomorphic for Atg16L1 exhibit an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like 
phenotype with viral infection [71]. Another study has shown that mice deficient in Il10, an 
anti-inflammatory cytokine, also exhibit intestinal pathology with persistent MNoV 
infection; in Il10−/− mice, altered MNoV levels may drive inflammation as MNoV is 
detectable in epithelial and lamina propria cells in the first two days after infection [72]. 
These findings suggest that although inflammation is important for controlling MNoV, 
unchecked inflammation induced by the virus may have pathologic consequences.
In addition to innate immunity, the adaptive immune system also controls MNoV (Table 2). 
For example, MNV-1 is not effectively cleared in mice lacking either set of, or both sets of, 
lymphocytes (e.g., B and T cells), that is, Rag1-, immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (Ighm/
muMt)-, and MHC Class II-deficient mice [63,73–75]. Antibody responses are an important 
component of MNoV control and protection against repeat challenge, as Rag1−/− and 
muMt−/− mice fail to clear acute MNoV infection [73,74]. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells also play 
combinatorial roles in regulating MNoV; mice lacking CD4+ T cells present higher tissue 
titers but normal viral clearance, while mice lacking CD8+ T cells exhibit delayed viral 
clearance [63,74–76]. Infection with different MNoV strains elicits differential innate and 
adaptive immune responses. While adaptive immune responses are critical for the control of 
acute MNoV strains, persistent strains such as MNV-3 and MNV.CR6 fail to generate 
effective T-cell responses, which may contribute to viral persistence [75,76]. Acute MNoV 
strain MNV-1 stimulates greater type I and III IFN responses than persistent strain 
MNV.CR6, which may contribute to the development of enhanced adaptive immune 
responses and viral clearance [67]. However, a robust adaptive immune response alone is not 
sufficient for clearance of acute MNoV, as MNV-1 persists in mice lacking type I IFN 
signaling in DCs [62]. Extrapolating from MNoV findings, it is reasonable to assume that

 targeted IFN-related therapies might be potentially effective in HNoV clearance; however, 
the importance of differential adaptive immune responses to genetically diverse NoV strains 
may represent a challenge and will require further investigation.
Interactions of NoV with the Microbiota
The intestinal lumen houses a large number and variety of commensal microbes (bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, protozoa, and single-celled archaea species), collectively referred to as the 
microbiome. Pathogens infecting the intestine encounter these microbes, and NoV infections 
are influenced by those encounters with harmful or beneficial outcomes to the host. To date, 
a direct interaction of HNoV capsids with members of the microbiota is known for a few 
commensal (e.g., Enterobacter cloacae) and pathogenic (e.g., Clostridium difficile) bacterial 
species [77,78]. Interactions are mediated via HBGA-like carbohydrates expressed on the 
surface of these bacteria [78]. Both HNoVs and MNoVs have been reported to bind 
additional carbohydrate moieties [79–83], including sialic acid residues (Table 1), which are 
widely expressed on bacteria [84]. Thus, MNoVs likely interact with members of the 
microbiome as well, although specific interactions remain to be demonstrated.
Although not universally seen, both HNoV and MNoV can alter host gut microbial 
communities. This dysbiosis typically results in an enhanced bacterial Firmicutes-to-
Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, an alteration also linked to liver fibrosis and obesity [85,86]. A 
subset (20%) of HNoV-infected individuals exhibited enhanced F/B ratios [87], while 
MNV-1 enhanced F/B ratios in C57BL/6 mice at Day 5 postinfection [88]. However, 
longitudinal analyses of both C57BL/6 (MNV-1, MNV.CR6) and Swiss Webster (MNV-1, 
MNV-4) mice failed to detect MNoV-induced dysbiosis of gastrointestinal bacteria at the 
phylum level [89]. A reduction in intestinal Lactobacillus strains occurred in MNV1-
infected ICR mice, with a concurrent increase in Proteobacteria delta, mirroring findings 
from HNoV [89]. On the flip side, experimentally induced bacterial dysbiosis also alters 
MNoV infection. For instance, pretreatment of mice with an antibiotic cocktail including 
vancomycin, ampicillin, metronidazole, and neomycin (VNAM) reduces acute MNV-1 titers 
[4] and reduces or prevents infection by persistent MNoV strains MNV-3 and MNV.CR6, 
respectively [4,68]. Importantly, MNV.CR6 viral loads are restored with a fecal transplant 
from untreated to antibiotic-treated animals [68]. Although antibiotic treatment reduces 
intestinal MNoV titers, it is not an advisable treatment option for HNoV infections, given 
the overall beneficial impact of the microbiota on human health [90].
From the perspective of the cellular level, co-infection of macrophages with MNoV and 
various bacteria has been shown to reduce viral titers, likely stemming from bacterial 
triggering of innate immune responses [91–93]. However, by contrast, MNoV-induced 
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines appears to foster bacterial growth. These findings 
highlight the need to further study complex, trans-kingdom interactions and their effects on 
the host.

 The Bermuda Triangle: Host, Microbiota, and NoV
Recent work has provided much insight into different host regulators of NoVs and clearly 
identified an important role for commensal microbes in NoV infection. However, these 
findings only begin to outline a still poorly defined triangle of interactions between the host, 
bacteria, and the virus.
As outlined earlier, commensal bacteria in vivo serve a proviral function by facilitating 
successful viral infection [4,68]. This proviral function is countered by host antiviral factors 
in the IFN-λ pathway, including IRF3, IFNLR1, and STAT1, such that in the absence of 
these host molecules, persistent MNoV is less dependent on bacteria for infection (Figure 
1A, Key Figure). The mechanism by which these host molecules alter the infectious 
potential of MNoV and its interaction with bacteria remains unclear. Consequently, these 
interactions will require a greater depth of understanding of all three arms of contact: MNoV 
interactions with commensal bacteria, interactions of bacteria with type III IFN signaling 
pathways, and the specific antiviral effects of type III IFN signaling on MNoV. In another 
interesting example of other enteric kingdoms of life interacting with MNoV in a proviral 
fashion, helminth infection with Trichinella spiralis leads to elevated intestinal MNV-1 loads 
due to STAT6-dependent changes in macrophage function [94]. These examples indicate that 
NoVs can benefit from the presence of other kingdoms of life normally present in the 
intestine, but that these beneficial effects may be mediated by the host.
In other cases, the combination of MNoV and commensal bacteria may induce pathologic 
consequences to a susceptible host, such as persistent MNoV infection potentiating intestinal 
inflammation in particular genetic contexts. For example, Atg16L1−/− or Il10−/− mice, which 
serve as models for IBD, develop intestinal inflammation following MNoV infection 
[71,72]. Treatment of mice with antibiotics following MNoV viral infection, or the infection 
of germ-free mice, prevents injury-induced pathology. Consequently, in these IBD models, 
MNoV and commensal bacteria work synergistically to induce inflammation via 
inflammatory host factors [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IFN-γ], and in opposition 
to other protective host factors (ATL16L1 and IL-10; Figure 1B).
MNoV can also act in concert with pathogenic bacteria to drive inflammation. In a mouse 
model of Helicobacter bilis-induced IBD, mice deficient in ATP-binding cassette transporter 
multidrug resistance gene 1a (Mdr1a) develop more severe colitis during co-infection with 
Gram-negative pathogen H. bilis and persistent MNoV, than with H. bilis infection alone 
[95] (Figure 1C). Host factor MDR1A, linked to human IBD and potentially important in 
intestinal barrier function, thus appears to suppress this co-infection phenotype [95]. The 
pathology-enhancing effect of MNoV in the context of IBD risk factor genes, however, was 
not observed in mice deficient for mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) and 
Il10 [96,97]. Acute MNoV infection also enhances lethality by systemic Escherichia coli, 
via type I IFNs and TNF-α, as well as via NOD1/NOD2- and RIP2-enhanced bacterial 
recognition on cell surfaces [98]. Thus, in addition to promoting potentially deleterious 
inflammatory effects from commensal bacteria under certain genetic contexts in mice, 
MNoV can also enhance inflammation, which is driven by known pathogenic bacteria such 
as E. coli. The host inflammatory response, while fighting these pathogens, is subverted by

 such multiple stimuli, turning on itself, and causing severe intestinal tissue damage to the 
host. Extrapolating to humans, the wide genetic diversity, differential co-infections, and 
unique commensal microbes harbored by each person may thus differentially predispose 
individuals to a range of symptoms and potential long-term effects from NoV-induced 
inflammation. The effects of inherent human variability during NoV infection thus represent 
an unexplored area of investigation.
In other contexts, MNoV infection can be beneficial for the host. Interestingly, in the 
absence of the microbiota, MNoV acts via type IIFN to restore abnormalities in intestinal 
tissues and immune function [99]. Wild-type mice treated with a VNAM antibiotics cocktail 
exhibited enhanced dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal injury and morbidity, which 
could be rescued by MNoV infection, but not in an Ifnar1−/− genetic background. In 
addition, MNoV infection of VNAM-treated mice significantly reduced weight loss, 
diarrhea, and intestinal histopathology following infection with Citrobacter rodentium, a 
model for enteropathogenic E. coli [99]. Thus, MNoV contributed in protecting mice against 
injury, presumably by replacing IFN signaling functions of commensal bacteria [99] (Figure 
1D). Another study found that in ampicillin-treated mice, MNoV infection partially restored 
antibacterial defenses against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, again supporting 
a role for MNoV in replacing the commensal micro-biota’s role in immune signaling [100]. 
While these studies were undertaken in the absence of the microbiota, MNoV infection of 
conventionally housed mice has also been found to increase mouse survival following 
intranasal bacterial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [101]. Indeed, MNoV infection 
was associated with reduced P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil infiltration in the lung and 
decreased proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) production, thus resulting in 
protected alveolar capillary barrier permeability and reduced acute lung injury [101] (Figure 
1E). MNoV can thus confer protection against a variety of different pathogenic bacteria by 
stimulating effective immunological responses; whether these findings apply broadly to all 
mucosal pathogens or are specific to particular pathogen subsets remains to be determined.
The intestinal environment with its rich mixture of different commensal and pathogenic 
microbes, host cells, microbial products, and cytokines is a complex locale which we are 
only beginning to understand. Systematic interrogation of the individual connections 
between these different components will start to shed light on the context-dependent effects 
of these factors on each other. Ultimately, studies will need to consider the translatability of 
these findings to HNoV infection as appropriate models are being developed.
Concluding Remarks
NoV infections cause a significant public health burden worldwide, but no directed 
treatment or prevention strategies are currently approved. Historically, this has been in large 
part due to the many technical hurdles that scientists have faced working with NoV. 
However, over the last two decades, NoV researchers have made significant leaps forward, 
increasing our general understanding of NoV biology (Box 1). These developments were 
aided in part by the utility of the MNoV model. Recent advances have included the 
identification of previously unknown host regulators, and the ascription of a novel function 
for the microbiota in modulating NoV infection at both cellular and host levels. Such

 information is invaluable for the development of vaccines and antivirals. Furthermore, NoV-
infected cell types are being identified, which shifts the paradigm away from an exclusively 
enterotropic virus to that of a virus exhibiting a broader tropism also encompassing myeloid 
cell lineages [8,40]. The implications of this expanded cellular tropism for pathogenesis and 
vaccine responses are only just beginning to be explored. In addition, determining the 
translatability of findings from MNoV to HNoV will require gaining a better appreciation of 
the aspects by which HNoV infection and disease are best modeled with current 
experimental strategies. In addition, the development of improved models will undoubtedly 
be a focus of investigation over the decades to come (see Outstanding Questions). Thus, as 
future discoveries reveal further insights into NoVs, these are expected to have a significant 
positive impact on public health, hopefully reducing the associated personal and economic 
burden of this infectious disease.
Box 1
The Clinician’s Corner
•
Norovirus is the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis, and can 
persist indefinitely in immunocompromised hosts. This may be the case 
for patients with genetic immunodeficiencies, or those at risk of 
infection post-transplantation.
•
In addition to causing acute gastroenteritis, norovirus infection has 
been suggested as a possible trigger for other enteric diseases, 
including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing 
enterocolitis in infants, and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel 
disease. Additional evidence is needed to bolster these connections, and 
the mechanisms by which norovirus might cause long-term disease 
remain unclear.
•
The commensal bacteria of the gut have been shown to help facilitate 
norovirus infection. Because different individuals harbor different 
commensal bacterial communities, it is possible that interindividual 
variation in gut bacteria could contribute to differing severity of 
norovirus infection. There is no evidence, however, that antibiotic 
treatment would be either helpful or therapeutic for an ongoing 
norovirus infection.
•
Both the innate and adaptive immune systems have been shown to be 
important for norovirus regulation in mouse models, suggesting that 
future targeting of the innate immune system may be important 
therapeutically for patients with chronic norovirus infection.

Glossary
Caliciviridae (caliciviruses)
family of positive-sense, nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA viruses including norovirus.
CD300LF and CD300LD
inhibitory receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily, known to be expressed on myeloid 
cells, and recently identified as viral receptors for murine norovirus.
CD68+ or DC-SIGN+ phagocytes
CD68 is a surface marker for macrophages, and DC-SIGN (or CD209) is a marker for 
dendritic cells, both found in the lamina propria of the human intestine.
Crohn’s disease
a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal 
tract, characterized by symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and weight loss.
Dextran sodium sulfate
a compound used to induce colitis in mouse models; it interferes with intestinal barrier 
function and stimulates inflammation, thereby mimicking clinical features of inflammatory 
bowel diseases.
Fucosyltransferase 2
enzyme that transfers fucose sugars, and governs the molecular basis of the histo-blood 
group antigens, which are surface markers for red blood cells.
Macroautophagy
a process by which cells degrade and recycle intracellular contents.

 Microfold (M) cells
a subtype of intestinal epithelial cell, found in gut- and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, 
which facilitates transport of microbes from the gut lumen to the lamina propria.
Necrotizing enterocolitis
a medical condition primarily affecting premature infants, often leading to death, where 
portions of the bowel undergo necrosis.
Pattern recognition receptors
receptors that recognize conserved features of pathogens and initiate signaling cascades 
resulting in innate immune responses. They are divided into four families, including Toll-
like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, and RIG-I-like 
receptors.
T-helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2
T helper (Th) cells are T cells that facilitate B-cell antibody class switching and activation of 
cytotoxic T cells. Th1 cells are important for control of intracellular bacteria and protozoa 
and classically produce effector cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ type II IFN). Th2 cells are 
important for the control of extracellular parasites such as helminths, and are associated with 
cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13.
Type I, II, and III interferons (IFNs)
signaling cytokines produced by host cells in response to exposure to pathogens. Type I 
(including IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFNs (such as IFN-λ) are classically triggered 
with viral infection, with type III IFN being more associated with mucosal infections. Type 
II IFN (or IFN-γ) is usually associated with bacterial infections.

Murine norovirus provides a practical model to study of norovirus infections and 
pathogenesis.
Murine and human noroviruses share a tropism for immune cells and intestinal epithelial 
cells.
Norovirus infection is regulated by multiple host genes, including viral entry factors, 
innate immune mediators, and components of the adaptive immune system.
The commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal microbiome can modulate norovirus 
infection.
Recent findings indicate that norovirus and commensal bacteria stimulate overlapping 
host immune pathways, and furthermore, that certain bacteria are required to mediate 
some of the pathologic effects of norovirus infection.
Host and microbial effects on norovirus may function in complex combinations to 
regulate viral infection and pathogenesis.

(A) Commensal bacteria facilitate persistent MNoV infection in a manner counteracted by 
innate immune factors IRF3, IFNLR1, and STAT1. (B) Commensal bacteria and MNoV are 
both needed to drive TNF-α and IFN-γ-mediated intestinal inflammation in mice lacking 
Atg16l1 or Il10. (C) MNoV exacerbates intestinal inflammation and lethality during 
pathogenic bacterial infection by potentiating inflammatory signals, including TNF-α and 
type I IFN, and host responses to bacteria. (D) In the absence of commensal bacteria, MNoV 
may replace protective functions of enteric microbes via type I IFN signaling. (E) In other 
contexts, MNoV can serve a protective role by decreasing the host inflammatory response to 
bacterial pathogens. IFN, interferon; IFNLR1, interferon λ receptor 1; IL, interleukin; IRF3,

Major Mechanisms of Infection in HNoV and MNoV. Human and murine norovirus (HNoV and MNoV) 
infections exhibit distinct characteristics, such as symptomatology and known attachment factors/receptors, 
but share overlap in the carbohydrate nature of their attachment factors, in cellular tropism, as well as in 
harboring a potential for persistent viral shedding.
Human norovirus
Murine norovirus
Symptoms
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 
[17,20,21]
Asymptomatic in wild-type mice; potential for lethality in 
immunocompromised mice (Table 2)
Duration of infection
Acute symptomatic phase (1–4 days), which may be 
followed by viral shedding for weeks to months [22–
24]
Acute strains cleared in 7–10 days; persistent strains are 
shed for many months/lifetime of animal [24,30]
In vitro tropism
B cells and enterocytes [4,5]
Macrophages, dendritic cells, microglial cells, and B cells 
[4,8,44]
In vivo tropism
Intestinal epithelial cells, myeloid cells, and 
lymphoid cells in immunocompromised patients [40]
Intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, B 
cells, and Kupffer cells (stellate macrophages in the liver) 
in immunocompromised mice [4,41,42,72]
Known attachment 
factors and receptors
Histo-blood group antigens are attachment factors 
conferring susceptibility to most HNoV strains 
[51,52]. Some strains bind heparan sulfate, sialic 
acid, and β-galactosylceramide [81–83]. No 
proteinaceous receptors are known
Strain-dependent attachment factors include terminal sialic 
acid residues on gangliosides and glycoproteins, and 
glycans on N-linked proteins [79,80]; CD300LF and 
CD300LD are proteinaceous viral receptors [44,45]

Table 2
Host Genes Involved in MNoV Regulation. Mouse genes implicated in viral infection, innate immune control, and adaptive immune control of murine 
norovirus are presented. MNV-1 and MNV-1.CW3 (here CW3) are acute strains of MNoV that infect systemic organs and are cleared by wild-type (WT) 
mice, while CR3, CR6, MNV/Hannover, and MNV-3 are persistent strains of MNoV that infect the intestine, are shed into the feces, and are not cleared in 
WT mice.
