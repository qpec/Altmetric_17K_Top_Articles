The brain-gut axis plays a critical role in the regulation of different diseases, many of
which are characterized by sympathetic dysregulation. However, a direct link between
sympathetic dysregulation and gut dysbiosis remains to be illustrated. Bone marrow
(BM)-derived immune cells continuously interact with the gut microbiota to maintain
homeostasis in the host. Their function is largely dependent upon the sympathetic
nervous system acting via adrenergic receptors present on the BM immune cells. In
this study, we utilized a novel chimera mouse that lacks the expression of BM beta1/2
adrenergic receptors (b1/2-ARs) to investigate the role of the sympathetic drive to the
BM in gut and microbiota homeostasis. Fecal analyses demonstrated a shift from a
dominance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phylum in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera, resulting
in a reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in
Proteobacteria phylum was determined. No changes in the abundance of acetate-,
butyrate-, and lactate-producing bacteria, and colon pathology were observed in the
b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Transcriptomic profiling in colon identified Killer Cell Lectin-Like
Receptor Subfamily D, Member 1 (Klrd1), Membrane-Spanning 4-Domains Subfamily
A Member 4A (Ms4a4b), and Casein Kinase 2 Alpha Prime Polypeptide (Csnk2a2) as
main transcripts associated with the microbiota shifts in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera.
Suppression of leukocyte-related transcriptome networks (i.e., function, differentiation,
migration), classical compliment pathway, and networks associated with intestinal
function, barrier integrity, and excretion was also observed in the colon of the KO
chimera. Moreover, reduced expression of transcriptional networks related to intestinal
diseases (i.e., ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory lesions, and stress) was noted. The observed

Role of Sympathetic Drive in Host-Microbiota Interaction
suppressed transcriptome networks were associated with a reduction in NK cells,
macrophages, and CD4+ T cells in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera colon. Thus, sympathetic
regulation of BM-derived immune cells plays a significant role in modifying inflammatory
networks in the colon and the gut microbiota composition. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to suggest a key role of BM b1/2-ARs signaling in host-microbiota
interactions, and reveals specific molecular mechanisms that may lead to generation
of novel anti-inflammatory treatments for many immune and autonomic diseases as well
as gut dysbiosis across the board.

INTRODUCTION
The gut harbors trillions of bacteria that modulates the host
homeostasis within and outside the intestinal tract. Recently,
emerging evidence has demonstrated the association between
gut dysbiosis and neurogenic diseases and conditions, such as
hypertension (Mell et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015), sleep apnea
(Durgan et al., 2016), and anxiety (Cryan and Dinan, 2012), all
marked by significantly altered sympathetic activity. However,
the bidirectional communication between the brain and gut
microbiota presents us with difficulties in determining the cause-
effect relationship in disease, which subsequently hinders the
efficient treatment.
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the immune
system (IS) are reciprocally regulated to maintain physiologic
homeostasis and defend the host from pathologic threats
(Bellinger and Lorton, 2014; Jänig, 2014). Although both alpha
(a-) and beta-adrenergic receptors (b-ARs) are expressed on
immune cells (ICs) (Jänig, 2014; Lorton and Bellinger, 2015),
it has been demonstrated that the adaptive IS responds to
SNS cues predominantly via the b2-ARs (Lorton and Bellinger,
2015), and that stimulation of b2-ARs on ICs modulates
lymphocyte development, survival, proliferation, activation, and
trafficking (Jänig, 2014; Lorton and Bellinger, 2015). On the
other hand, the gut, as the largest immune organ in the body,
reciprocally communicates with the host IS, and a variety
of intestinal diseases have been associated with dysregulation
of the IS [e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases (Baumgart and
Carding, 2007; Degruttola et al., 2016) and colorectal cancer
(Gao et al., 2015)]. Exogenous factors (i.e., pathogen infection,
diet, physical exercise.), that have been demonstrated to alter
the gut microbiota can also exhibit profound effects on the IS
(Karczewski et al., 2014; Lightfoot et al., 2014; Petriz et al.,
2014; Vieira et al., 2014). In addition, several extra-intestinal
autoimmune diseases [i.e., multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and type 1

diabetes (Kamada et al., 2013)] have been associated with gut
dysbiosis. Typically, one consequent feature of the gut dysbiosis
is the reduced production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the
beneficial metabolites derived from anearobic fermentation of
gut microbiota. Therefore, evaluation of SCFAs level become a
reliable indicator of gut homeostasis (Harris et al., 2012).
Collectively, the critical regulatory role of the SNS in the
control of IS, and the importance of the IS in maintaining
gut homeostasis, led to our hypothesis that the interaction
between the SNS and the gut microbiota involves SNS-mediated
modulation of IS function. This may be particularly relevant
in neurogenic diseases, due to its association with both over-
activated IS and gut dysbiosis. Given that the BM is the origin
of ICs, and that the proinflammatory BM contributes to the
modulation of neuroinflammation and autonomic functions
(Santisteban et al., 2015), we postulated that manipulation of
the SNS effects on the BM ICs will in turn affect the host
gut microbiota composition that is associated with alterations
in the gut IS. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the BM
b1/2-ARs KO chimera mice, a model in which the irradiation-
depleted wild type (WT) BM is reconstituted with BM from the
b1/2 ARs KO mice (Ahmari et al., 2016). This manipulation
results in diminished effects of SNS on the BM ICs, thus
allowing investigation of its effects on the gut microbiota
composition. Herein, we demonstrate that loss of BM b1/2-ARs
signaling results in shifts in the gut microbiota composition
and suppression of colon IS, indicating a novel mechanistic
association between the host BM SNS, IS, and the gut microbiota.
This is highly significant considering that many dysbiotic and
immune conditions are also associated with dysregulation of
the SNS (Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Bellinger and Lorton, 2014;
Bienenstock et al., 2015).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male chimera mice were generated and validated as previously
described (Ahmari et al., 2016). Control chimera mice (Control)
were generated by reconstitution of WT C57BL/6J whole BM
cells into sublethally irradiated age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J
mice by comparable irradiation and reconstitution protocols.
Following irradiation, all chimera mice were treated with 0.4%
Baytril antibiotic (enrofloxacin; Bayer) in drinking water, and
were given moist chow and Nutrical supplement daily during

the first 3 weeks. Following this, the mice were allowed to
recover for 9 weeks before fecal collections. All experimental
procedures were completed in accordance with the approved
protocols by the University of Florida Institute for Animal Care
and Use Committee, and complied with the standards stated in
the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. All mice were housed in a temperature-
controlled room (22◦–23◦C) on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle, in
specific pathogen-free cages, and had access to standard mouse
chow and water ad libitum.
Microbiota Sequencing and Analyses
Fecal samples were collected from C57 chimera and b1/2 ARs KO
chimera mice 3 months post-irradiation and BM reconstitution,
to allow for full recovery of the mice, as previously described
(Ahmari et al., 2016). The analyses of microbial composition
were performed, as previously described (Yang et al., 2015).
Briefly, fecal DNA (N = 6/group) was extracted by using ZR fecal
DNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Bacterial 16S rRNA
containing V4-V5 regions were obtained using Illumina Miseq
compatible primers. PCR amplicons were purified (Qiagen,
Madison, WI) following separation on an agarose gel, and
quantified by the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY). Equal amounts of amplicon for each sample were pooled
and qualified with Kapa SYBR fast qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems,
Inc., Woburn, MA). Pooled samples were run on the Illumina
Miseq platform using Miseq v2 reagent kit (Illumina, Inc., San
Diego, CA). Primers used for amplification are listed in Table 1.
The bioinformatics analyses were performed as described
previously (Lightfoot et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015). Briefly,
sequenced reads were demultiplexed according to a combination
of forward and reverse indices. Subsequently, obtained reads
were filtered based on additional requirements: exact match to
sequencing primers and quality score of 30 or more. Filtered
reads were joined using FLASh (Fast Length Adjustment of Short
reads) software, applied against Silva non-redundant 16S rRNA
references database (v108), assigned taxonomic classifications at
a 97% clustering threshold, and summarized in a refOTU table.
Alpha, beta diversity, and principal coordinate analyses (PCoA)
measures were created using custom R scripts and scripts from
the QIIME package. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) along
with effect size measurements (LEfSe) in Galaxy was used to
distinguish differentially significant features at each taxonomic
level. Bacterial genus were identified based on 16S sequencing
data and grouped based on the primary metabolite according to
Bergey’s manual as before described (Antharam et al., 2013; Yang
et al., 2015).
Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) Extraction
and High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC)
Fecal pellets (N = 4/group) were collected and SCFAs were
extracted, as previously described (De Baere et al., 2013) with
some modifications. Briefly, 200 µL of HCl was added to the
fecal homogenates to preserve the volatile SCFAs, and vortexed
vigorously to evenly suspend the fecal mass. Five milliliters of
methylene chloride was used to extract the SCFAs with gentle
rotation at room temperature for 20 min. After centrifugation
at 3,500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded. Five
hundred microliters of 1N NaOH was added to the organic pellet,
followed by an additional 20 min rotation at room temperature.
After spinning at 3500 rpm for 5 min, the top aqueous phase
was collected and mixed with 100 µL of HCl before filtered
for injection. A 50 µL aliquot was used for each injection. A
standard linear regression curve was generated for each of the
acetate, lactate, propionate, and butyrate solutions separately, for
calibration purposes. All of the standard solutions were extracted
according to the method described above. Relative standard
deviation (< 3.0%) was achieved by sequential injections of
10 mM standard mix (of all three SCFAs) into the mobile
phase. The chromatographic separation was performed at room
temperature using Perkin Elmer Series 200 HPLC System
(Perkin Elmer Instruments, Norwalk, CT), equipped with an
autosampler, quaternary pump, and 200 series UV/VIS detector.
The analytical column used was Hypersil Gold aQ 150 × 4.6 mm
3 µm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walthan, MA). Samples were
run in a combination of two solutions: 90% of mobile phase
A 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 2.2 and 10% of mobile phase
B acetonitrile. Flow rate was set as 0.8 ml/min for 25 min.
Wavelength used for detection was 210 nm.
Tissue Collection and Isolation of Total
RNA for Microarray Analyses
Extraction of RNA from the distal colon was performed using
1 mL TRIzol R
� Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), as
per manufacturer’s protocol. Final nucleic acid pellets were
resuspended in 30 µL RNAse-DNAse free water. Total RNA
integrity for all samples used in microarray and real-time PCR
analyses was determined using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit
with the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA). The mean RNA integrity value for all samples was 8.16 (SD
± 0.76).
Microarray Analyses and Bioinformatics
The SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 × 60 K Microarray Kit
(Agilent Product Number, G4852A Design ID 028005) was
used for expression analyses (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Sample sizes for microarray analysis were N = 7 per group.
Briefly, the RNeasy Mini Kit was used to purify RNA
prior to labeling, as per manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). RNA concentrations were determined using
the NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Microarray hybridizations were performed according to the One-
Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Low Input
Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent V6.5, May 2010) and 10 ng
total RNA per sample was used for labeling and hybridization as
per our previous protocol (Feswick et al., 2014; Ornostay et al.,
2016). Microarrays were scanned at 5 µm with the Agilent G2505
C Microarray Scanner, and Agilent Feature Extraction Software
(v. 10.1.1.1) was used to extract raw signal intensities from
microarray images. Microarray data were evaluated by manual
inspection of the quality control parameters. All arrays were
deemed high quality. Raw microarray data have been deposited

into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Series
GSE71632, GPL13912). Raw intensity data were imported into
JMP R
� Genomics v7.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Intensity data were normalized using quantile normalization.
Control probes were removed prior to identifying differentially
expressed genes (DEGs), and the limit of detection was set to an
intensity of 2.5 based on the Agilent spike-in controls. Therefore,
any probe falling below this value was assigned a normalized
intensity of 2.5. DEGs were identified using a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by a false discovery rate (FDR)
set at 5.0%. Cluster analyses were conducted in JMP Genomics
v7.0 using probes that were differentially expressed (unadjusted
p < 0.05). Two-way clustering using the Fast ward algorithm was
conducted after each row was centered to a mean of zero (0) and
variance scaled to one.
Pathway Studio 9.0 (Elsevier) and ResNet 10.0 were utilized
for sub-network enrichment analysis (SNEA) of cell processes
(Nikitin et al., 2003). The option of “best P-value, highest
magnitude fold change” in Pathway Studio was used for
duplicated probes. A total number of 32,734 mouse probes
were successfully mapped to the program using the official
gene name. SNEA was performed to identify transcriptome
networks that were enriched in the distal colon. A Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test with 500 permutations was conducted to determine
whether networks were preferentially regulated compared to the
background reference probability distribution. Networks were
constructed based on common regulators of expression and
regulators of specific cell processes. The enrichment P-value for
a gene seed was set at P < 0.05. Additional details on the use
of SNEA can be found in a previous publication (Langlois and
Martyniuk, 2013).
Real-Time PCR Validation
For distal colon microarray validation, primer sets from target
genes were collected from primerbank (Table 2; (Wang et al.,
2012)). Transcripts that showed dramatic and significant changes
in expression levels were selected for microarray validation. The
genes investigated included CFD, Cyp2e1, and Ms4a4b. N =
7–8/group. PCR was performed on CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). The PCR
conditions were as follows: 95◦C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95◦C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60◦C for 30 s, and 72◦C
for 30 s. Dissociation curves were generated, starting at 65◦C
and ending at 95◦C with increments of 0.5◦C every 5 s. Gene
expression was normalized to GAPDH and was determined using
the relative ��Ct method based on the method described (Pfaffl,
2001). No reverse transcriptase control was used.
Histopathologic Evaluation
Colon tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and
kept in 30% sucrose solution for 1 day. Tissue was then
frozen at −80◦C in O.C.T embedding, cross sectioned at 10 µm
thickness via cryostat at −20◦C, mounted onto glass slides, and
routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Sections
from C57 (N = 2) and b1/2-ARs KO (N = 2) chimera mice
were qualitatively evaluated for histopathologic lesions. Slides
were digitally scanned using an Aperio System to produce
representative images captured from the scans.

Colon tissues (N = 3/group) were fixed in 4% PFA, and kept in

slides for immunofluorescent staining. Primary mouse anti-CD4
(1:500, #14-0041-85, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-CD94
(1:100, #sc-390776, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas)
and anti-CD11b (1:200, sc-20050, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, Texas) were used, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for visualizing infiltration
of CD4+ cells, NK cells, and macrophages, separately, in the
intestines of both C57 and b1/2 ARs KO chimera. Three to four
images/rat/antibody were used for quantification. Positive cell
numbers were divided by total cell numbers, as indicated by
DAPI staining.
RESULTS
Alterations in the Gut Microbiota in
b1/2-ARs KO Chimera
The rodent gut microbiota is generally dominated by Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes phyla, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
and Tenericutes constituting the remaining phyla (Yang et al.,
2013). Shifts in the bacterial proportions and phylotypes are
widely used to evaluate gut homeostasis. Our 16S rRNA
amplicon sequencing data suggested that Chao richness and
Shannon diversity indices did not differ between C57 and
b1/2-ARs KO chimeras (Figure 1A), indicating that deficiency
in BM b1/2-ARs signaling did not induce changes in the
microbiota species richness or biodiversity (Antharam et al.,
2013; Yang et al., 2015; Mosca et al., 2016). However, a shift
from a dominance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, resulting
in a reduction of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio,
was observed (Figure 1A). We observed significant expansion
of Bacteroidetes from approximate 1/3–1/2 of total bacteria
reads and contraction of Firmicutes from approximate 2/3
to ½ of total bacteria reads in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera
group (Figure 1B). No other change was observed at phylum
level. Members of the alpha and delta proteobacteria in
the Proteobacteria phylum, and Anaeroplasmataceae family in
the Tenericutes phylum were depleted in the b1/2-ARs KO
chimera (Figure 2A). Analyses of gut microbial community
structure by unweighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis
(PCoA) revealed two separate clusters, indicating dissimilarities
in microbial community structure between the b1/2-ARs KO
chimeras and the C57 controls (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
a number of genera, including Anaerotruncus, Coprococcus,
Oscillibacter, and Desulfovibrio were significantly reduced in
b1/2-ARs KO chimeras compared to C57 control chimeras
(Figure 2B). Therefore, deficiency in b1/2-ARs signaling in the
BM led to an altered gut microbiota, characterized by a shift
from Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes dominance, a reduction in
the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, and diverse changes
at the genus level. Interestingly, no significant dysbiosis was
observed in the b1/2-ARs KO chimeras. By contrast, the shifts
in gut microbial composition is considered beneficial due to the
depletion of pathogenic bacteria and alteration in F/B ratio.
Functionally, the end-products of anaerobic fermentation of
the gut microbiota significantly contribute to the maintenance
of intestinal and systemic homeostasis. Therefore, we grouped
bacterial phylotypes at the genus level based on their primary
fermented end-products (i.e., acetate, butyrate and lactate;
Antharam et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). We did not observe
significant alterations of total acetate, butyrate, and lactate-
producing bacteria (Figure 3A) between C57 control and
b1/2-ARs KO chimeras. However, hydrogen sulfide-producing
bacteria, Desulfovibrio, was contracted in the b1/2-ARs KO
chimeras (Figure 2B). HPLC analyses of fecal samples yielded
no significant differences in butyrate levels between the KO
and control chimeras, consistent with the bacterial analyses
(Figure 3B). In the colon histological analysis, all sections from
C57 and b1/2-ARs KO chimera animals were interpeted to be
qualitatively normal, and no differences were detected between
groups (Figure 3C). These indicate that the shift of gut microbial
composition did not impact the major SCFA production and
colon histology.
Transcriptomic Profiling Identified Three
Key Transcripts Associated with Shifts in
the Gut Microbiota
We have demonstrated that the loss of b1/2-ARs signaling in BM
resulted in a shift in the gut microbiota. Due to the constant
communication between intestine and the microbiota, we also
measured the host colon transcriptome using a whole-genome
microarray to determine global gene expression changes in the
gut that may be involved in the microbiota shift. Based upon
these data, we selected three abundantly expressed genes with
significantly different expression levels (Appendix 1) between the
C57 control and KO chimeras to validate the microarray data.
Consistent with the microarray data, the expression levels of
CFD, Cyp2e1, and Ms4a4b were decreased in the KO chimera
mice (Figure 4A).
Subsequently, the microarray data were analyzed as described

4,072, P < 0.05). All expression data are provided in Appendix
1. The two-way cluster is presented in Figure 4B to show the
clustering of the individuals based on treatment. Thus, the cluster
analyses using differentially expressed transcripts (unadjusted,
P < 0.05) revealed that individual mouse from the two groups
were separated based upon gene expression profiles. A core
group of transcripts was uniquely different between the C57
control and the b1/2-ARs KO chimeras. Furthermore, microarray
analyses identified three transcripts that showed significantly
altered expression in the distal colon following an adjusted P-
value (FDR = 5%): Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D,
Member 1 (Klrd1), Membrane-Spanning 4-Domains, Subfamily
A, Member 4A (Ms4a4b), and Casein Kinase 2, Alpha Prime
Polypeptide (Csnk2a2). Ms4a4b is a CD20 homolog in T cells
(Xu et al., 2010). Klrd1 is known as CD94 and is expressed
on NK cells (Fang et al., 2011). Csnk2a2 is a protein kinase
that promotes epithelial cell restitution (Song et al., 2000).
Thus, these three differentially expressed genes are hypothesized
to be important for both immune responses in the gut and
communication with the microbiome. Herein, we observed
significant upregulation of Csnk2a2 by 1.3-folds, while Klrd1
and Ms4a4b were downregulated ∼4-fold in the distal colon of
b1/2-ARs KO chimera mice (Figure 4C).
Gene Networks Associated with Intestinal
Processes and Diseases Are Altered in
b1/2-ARs KO Chimera Mice
We conducted further analyses of the host intestinal gene
expression to identify specific host IS cellular processes that
may be associated with the observed microbiota changes in the
b1/2-ARs KO chimeras. Strikingly, the majority (262) of cell
processes were downregulated at the transcriptome level, while
only 16 gene networks were upregulated in the distal colon of the
b1/2-ARs KO chimera (Appendix 2). Given that the three most
affected genes, Ms4a4b, Klrd and Csnk2a2, are closely related
to IS, we focused our analyses on cell processes involved in IS

chimera included macrophage adhesion, NK cell proliferation
and differentiation, mast cell chemotaxis, and leukocyte function,
all showing significant downregulation in the distal colon at the
transcriptome level (P < 0.01; Appendix 2). As an example,
Figure 5A summarizes gene networks associated with leukocyte
function (fold change by −1.103, P < 0.01). In addition, epithelial
cell interaction (P < 0.001), permeability (P < 0.01), proliferation
(P < 0.0001), and recycling (P < 0.05) were also downregulated
(by ∼8%, or 1.08-fold) in the distal colon of the b1/2-ARs KO
chimera.
Furthermore, gene set enrichment analyses suggested that the
classical complement pathway, which is an important part of the
IS that contributes to phagocytosis and enhances the ability of
antibodies to clear pathogens, was also suppressed in the distal
colon of b1/2-ARs KO chimera (Figure 5B). By contrast, there
were very few cell processes increased in the colon of b1/2-ARs
KO chimera, and these included stromal cell function, cell-cell

recognition, mucosal secretion, and processes associated with
peripheral nerve blood flow. These processes increased at the
level of the transcriptome by 10–20% (Fold change of 1.1–1.2;
Appendix 2). Here we point out that this is the median fold
change of the entire network, and networks are based on 100s
of genes in some cases. Thus, fold changes for a network, when
many genes are involved, are expected to be smaller compared to
any single gene.
Due to the observed changes in the colon IS, sub-network
enrichment analyses were performed in order to identify possible
associations with diseases described in the literature (Borody
et al., 2015; Alipour et al., 2016; Degruttola et al., 2016). This
analysis revealed a significant association between the observed
transcriptome changes in our b1/2-ARs KO chimera and diseases
of the intestine function (P < 0.01), barrier integrity (P <
0.001), secretion (P < 0.05), and motility (P < 0.0001), all
associated with 5–12% (1.05–1.12-fold) downregulation of gene
networks in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera (Figure 5C). This suggests
that intestinal function may be altered following the b1/2-ARs
KO BM transplantation. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis
revealed an overall downregulation of gene networks associated
with diseases related to bowel inflammation (Figure 5D). For
example, gene networks associated with ileitis were suppressed
∼8% (P < 0.05), and included Cd36, Il4, Cd44, Cd4, and Cd40
(Appendix 2). Gene networks related to enteritis (P < 0.05)
and intestinal morphology (P < 0.05) were also decreased at
the transcriptome level in the colon of b1/2-ARs KO chimera.
Additionally, a transcriptional network of inflammatory stress
molecules was decreased by 6% (1.06-fold; P < 0.01). This
network included genes such as Nos3, Il1b, Fos, Rora, Tlr4,
and Fosl1, among others. A network related to inflammatory
lesions (e.g., transcripts including Gf1, Ccl5, Cd8a, Il1b, Il1a, Il4,
Il18, Cd4, Il15, Cx3cl1, Pparg, and Il6, among others) were also
decreased by 8% (1.08-fold; P < 0.05). Lastly, obesity networks
(e.g., transcripts including Retn, Lpl, Lep, Esr1, Lipc, Hsd11b1,
Gpt, Lipe, Vldlr, and Il6, among others, fold change −1.042, P <
0.05) were also decreased by 4% (1.04-fold). All enriched disease
networks are reported in Appendix 2.
Decreased Levels of Specific ICs in the
Colon of b1/2-ARs KO Chimera Mice
We report an overall suppression of the immune system in the
gut of b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Since the suppressed transcripts,
MS4a4b and Klrd1, are primarily expressed in T cells and
NK cells, respectively, we proposed that the reduction in
these gene transcripts in the colon would be associated with
a decreased presence of infiltrating CD4+ T and NK cells
in the colon of b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Thus, we employed
immunofluorescence to quantify the relative frequencies of
CD4+ T cells, CD11b+ macrophages, and CD94+ NK cells in
the colon. Although there were no apparent qualitative histologic
differences between the C57 and b1/2 ARs KO chimeras, we
observed a reduced contribution of CD4+ T cells (by 61.8%
or 1.62-fold; Figures 6A,D), CD11b+ macrophages (by 65.8%,
Figures 6B,D), and CD94+ NK cells (by 75.2%, Figures 6C,D)
within the colonic lamina propria of the b1/2-ARs KO chimera,
in line with the observed reduction in immune responses at the
transcriptome level.

of the BM ICs. In this model, we present several novel findings:
(i) We were able to establish a direct and novel link between
sympathetic regulation of BM, local gut inflammatory networks,
and gut microbiota, as ablation of b1/2-ARs in the BM caused
significant shifts in fecal bacterial composition toward what is
considered beneficial (i.e., comparable diversity and richness,
reduced F/B ratio, and decreased Proteobacteria phylum;
Mukhopadhya et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015; Boulangé et al.,
2016). Apart from a decrease in F/B ratio in the b1/2-ARs KO
chimera, which contrasts the reportedly increased F/B ratio in
obese and hypertensive patients and rodent models (Boulangé
et al., 2016), we also observed a decrease in specific bacteria
of the Proteobactarial phylum, of which many species are
reportedly pathogenic (Batut et al., 2004; Mukhopadhya et al.,
2012). (ii) Alteration in gut microbiota composition resulting
from BM b1/2-ARs ablation is also associated with significant
downregulation of inflammatory transcriptome networks in the
colon, including leukocyte function, macrophage adhesion, NK
cell proliferation and differentiation, leukocyte adhesion and
migration, mast cell chemotaxis, and T-cell activation, among

FIGURE 6 | Decreased infiltration of particular IC subsets in the colons of the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Significantly lower levels of CD4+ cells (A), CD11b+

others. This is associated with marked reduction in specific
subsets of ICs in the colon of the BM b1/2-ARs KO chimera.
This suggests that modulation of BM beta-adrenergic signaling
affects the gut IS. (iii) More specifically, we observed a significant
downregulation in two IS-modulating genes in the colon of the
BM chimera mice. Most interestingly, these genes are involved
in regulation of T cell propagation (Ms4a4b) and NK cell
activity (Klrd1), corresponding to the decreased frequency of
T and NK cell infiltration to the colon of BM chimera mice.
Furthermore, we observed an increase in Csnk2a2 steady state
mRNA abundance, a protein kinase that promotes epithelial
cell restitution, suggesting that improvement in colon epithelial
proliferation may be associated with local immunosuppression
in our chimera mice. This corroborates our results from the
sub-network enrichment analyses, which shows an increase
in the expression of a mucosal secretion network, a reported
first line of IS defense in the gut (Deplancke and Gaskins,
2001; Kim and Khan, 2013), as well as significant decrease in
gene transcriptome networks associated with inflammatory
bowel disease, inflammatory stress and lesions, and obesity in
the chimera mice. The latter may be particularly interesting,
considering a recent publication suggesting a connection
between expression of the Ms4a4 gene family in the gut and
obesity (Pfalzer et al., 2016), and a well-reported association
between obesity and increased SNS (Ando, 2014; Thorp and
Schlaich, 2015).

 Yang et al.
Role of Sympathetic Drive in Host-Microbiota Interaction
Multiple physiological and immunological effects of SCFAs
and lactate on the host’s IS, gut function, and autonomic activity
have previously been documented (Gao et al., 2009; Berni
Canani et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Furusawa et al., 2013; Al-
Asmakh and Hedin, 2015; Bourassa et al., 2016). In our data,
we did not observe significant changes in acetate, butyrate,
and lactate-producing bacteria, and butyrate levels between the
two groups. Consistent with this, no significant morphologic
changes were observed in the colon of both groups, indicating
that the observed microbiota shifts were not detrimental to the
intestine.
Our transcriptome analysis revealed suppression of gene
networks related to leukocyte function, intestine function, and
intestinal diseases/conditions in the colon of KO chimera. In
addition, we observed an overlapping reduction in Ms4a4b
transcript in the BM (Ahmari et al., 2016) and colon of b1/2-
ARs KO chimera, suggesting that expression of Ms4a4b may be
directly regulated by the sympathetic drive to the BM. Ms4a4b is a
CD20 homolog that modulates T cell proliferation and activation
and plays a significant role in the enhancement of immune
responses to antigen-induced signals (Howie et al., 2009; Xu et al.,
2010). It also serves as a membrane adapter of glucocorticoid-
induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family-related
gene receptors, which are involved in potentiation of CD4 and
CD8 T cell responses (Ronchetti et al., 2004). As the expression
levels of both the BM and colon Ms4a4b transcripts are related
to BM b1/2-ARs signaling, this suggests a novel convergence
between the two pathways. However, further studies are required
to determine whether Ms4a4b functions as a molecule link
between the BM SNS and inflammatory responses in circulation
as well as the gut. Similarly, Klrd1, also known as CD94, is a
critical receptor involved in maintenance of NK cell function
(Fang et al., 2011), the expression of which is also significantly
reduced in the colon of b1/2-ARs KO chimera, and, again, follows
the observed reduced infiltration of NK cells to the colon. The
reduced mRNA levels of both Ms4a4b and Klrd1 in the b1/2-ARs
KO chimera is also consistent with the significant suppression of
systemic IS in the KO chimera, as discussed previously (Ahmari
et al., 2016). On the other hand, expression of Csnk2a2, a protein
kinase that promotes epithelial cell restitution and protects
intestinal epithelial cells from inflammation-induced apoptosis
(Koch et al., 2013), is increased in the colon of b1/2-ARs
KO chimera, suggesting an improvement in epithelial function.
Furthermore, our analyses points to an increase in networks
associated with beneficial mucin secretion in the colon, as well
as a reduction in gene networks associated with inflammatory
bowel disease, inflammatory stress and lesions, and obesity in the
chimera mice. Collectively, reduced infiltration of certain subsets
of BM-derived ICs to the gut, as a result of the loss of b1/2-ARs
signaling in BM, may be related to improved colonic epithelial
homeostasis. Subsequently, the global immunosuppression in
the gut may thus potentiate the beneficial shifts in the gut
microbiota.
Considering the recent association between gut dysbiosis and
hypertension (Pluznick et al., 2013; Jose and Raj, 2015; Mell
et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015), the observed beneficial shifts in
the gut microbiota of the b1/2-ARs KO chimera may also play a
significant role in reduction of BP previously reported in the same
mouse model (Ahmari et al., 2016). Indeed, we demonstrated
a decrease in the F/B ratio in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera,
in contrast to the increased F/B ratios previously associated
with obesity and hypertension (Yang et al., 2015; Boulangé
et al., 2016). Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease
in the Proteobacteria phylum in our KO chimera. Typically,
the Proteobacteria phylum, characterized as the major group
of Gram-negative bacteria, encompass a variety of potential
pathogens that can potentiate activation of the host IS (Batut
et al., 2004; Mukhopadhya et al., 2012). It is noteworthy that
the gene set enrichment analyses identified downregulation of
biological processes such as the “defense response to bacteria,”
“defense response to Gram-positive bacteria,” “defense response
to Gram-negative bacteria,” and “Gram-positive bacterial cell
surface binding” in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. This suggests a
reciprocal host-microbiota interaction in our model, whereby,
the primary effects on the microbiota are due to the initial BM-
related IS suppression, while the secondary effects on the host
may be exerted as a result of the changes in the composition of
the microbiota.
We further observed a significant reduction in several
potentially harmful bacteria in the colon of b1/2-ARs KO
chimera. Though little is known about the role of Thalassospira,
which belongs to the Rhodospirillaceae family, the presence of
Thalassospira has been linked with diet-induced obesity (Clarke
et al., 2013). Other species, such as those of the sulfide-reducing
bacteria Desulfovibrio, have adverse effects on the host through
the production of detrimental hydrogen sulfide, a reducing
chemical that has potential genotoxic effects (Rowan et al., 2009).
This may compromise gut barrier function (Roediger et al., 1993)
and lead to host DNA damage (Attene-Ramos et al., 2007). The
remarkably contracted portion of the Desulfovibrionales order in
the b1/2-ARs KO chimera suggests a decrease in the production
of hydrogen sulfide, although additional studies are required
to confirm this. In the Firmicutes phylum, the Anaerotruncus
genus is widely found in human stool samples, while it also
contributes to 1% of total bacteria in the C57 control chimera.
This genus contains only one species known as Anaerotruncus
colihominis. Though its major end-products include acetate
and butyrate, generally regarded as beneficial metabolites, the
clinical investigation of Anaerotruncus colihominis demonstrated
its critical role in bacteremia. In comparing intestinal lumen
samples collected from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and
healthy individuals, Anaerotuncus is considered to be the key
phylotype that contributes to the differences of intestinal lumen
microbiota structure in CRC and healthy individuals (Lau
et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). Thus, a contraction in this
bacteria in our KO chimera may also be beneficial to the host.
Another decreased bacteria genus in our b1/2-ARs KO chimera
is Coprococcus, which is heavily associated with Crohn’s disease
and autism (Kaakoush et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2013; Gevers
et al., 2014). Coprococcus also appears to show sensitivity to
chronic stress, a condition with a well-established association
with inflammation, SNS and gut microbiota shifts (Bailey et al.,
2011). Thus, there appears to exist a role for Coprococcus in the
regulation of intestinal and systemic immunity, in addition to
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

its potential CNS effects. Furthermore, considering the reported
association between stress and SNS (Goldstein, 1987; Teixeira
et al., 2015), the observed contraction of Coprococcus may be
partly related to reduced SNS effects on the BM in the b1/2-
ARs KO chimera. We also observed a potentially beneficial
contraction in the Oscillibacter in the KO chimera, a bacterial
genus implicated in body weight gain in high fat diet-fed
mice (Lam et al., 2012). The relative abundance of Oscillibacter
also shows a negative correlation with tight junction protein
expression and intestinal trans-epithelial resistance, indicating
that higher relative abundance may be detrimental for the gut
barrier. Interestingly, Oscillibacter may also impact the CNS, as it
is linked with depression (Naseribafrouei et al., 2014; Jiang et al.,
2015).
In summary, this study specifically depletes the sympathetic
regulation on the BM to demonstrate the interplay between
the SNS and IS in maintenance of gut and microbiota
homeostasis. Depletion of this sympathetic regulation on
BM leads to beneficial shifts in gut microbiota associated
