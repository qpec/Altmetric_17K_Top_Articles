 Methods—We used National Health Interview Survey data (1999–2012) linked to US 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administrative records (1999–2014) to 
examine differences in reported fair or poor health and psychological distress. We used 
multivariable models to compare those currently receiving HUD housing assistance (public 
housing, housing choice vouchers, and multifamily housing) with those who will receive housing 
assistance within 2 years (the average duration of HUD waitlists) to account for selection into 
HUD assistance.
Results—We found reduced odds of fair or poor health for current public housing (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57, 0.97) and multifamily housing (OR = 0.75; 
95% CI = 0.60, 0.95) residents compared with future residents. Public housing residents also had 
reduced odds of psychological distress (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.86). These differences were 
not mediated by neighborhood-level characteristics, and we did not find any health benefits for 
current housing choice voucher recipients.
Conclusions—Housing assistance is associated with improved health and psychological well-
being for individuals entering public housing and multifamily housing programs.
As of 2015, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides 
housing assistance to approximately 5 million families (including nearly 10 million 
individuals).1 Despite the large public investment in housing assistance, there have been few 
studies assessing the association between receipt of housing assistance and health status. 
Housing is a primary dimension of the health-related social context in individuals’ lives.2 
Housing quality and location have been shown to be related to physical and mental health,3,4 
exposure to environmental toxins,5 and access to health care and services.6,7 Studies indicate 
that improvement in housing quality can have beneficial impacts on the health and well-
being of low-income families.8
Better housing costs more, and unaffordable housing strains family resources needed to 
sustain housing stability and health-promoting investments.9 Especially for low-income 
families, housing cost burdens increase the risk of eviction and homelessness, which can 
increase stress and be severely detrimental to mental health.10 Housing assistance provides 
better and more stable and affordable housing than low-income families otherwise could 
obtain and may create social contexts conducive to the development of healthy lives.11,12
HUD currently administers several housing assistance programs that are distinguished by 
their form and assistance structure, the largest of which are public housing, housing choice 
vouchers, and multifamily housing. Public housing developments are owned and managed 
by a public housing authority for low-income family occupancy. Public housing tends to 
result in higher density housing than do other programs, but the demolition of high-poverty 
tower housing developments in the 1990s was part of a national push to reduce reliance on 
public housing for housing assistance and to integrate public housing into surrounding 
communities.13
Housing choice vouchers provide direct housing subsidies that allow recipients to enter the 
private housing market. Housing choice vouchers are intended to give low-income families 
the greatest amount of freedom possible in finding a suitable housing unit, in terms of both

 housing type and neighborhood location.14 Multifamily housing programs involve private 
housing developments that reserve a certain number of housing units for rent at below-
market rates, with the difference in price subsidized by HUD. Compared with public 
housing, both vouchers and multifamily housing make it more likely that assisted families 
live in mixed-income developments, although in many cases voucher-assisted families live in 
similarly disadvantaged neighborhoods before and after receiving vouchers. Multifamily 
housing developments are often recent construction or building rehabilitation and are more 
likely to be in urban areas.
The HUD-funded Moving to Opportunity project used an experimental approach to examine 
the effects of movement out of substandard housing developments and into lower-poverty 
neighborhoods. Although most Moving to Opportunity evaluation research has found effects 
to be highly heterogeneous,15 improved housing and neighborhoods appear to be a valid 
pathway to better health outcomes for individuals, including reductions in obesity, diabetes, 
and mental health difficulties among adults.16,17
However, the primary goal of the Moving to Opportunity experiment was to examine 
neighborhood effects rather than the effect of housing assistance. Studies considering the 
effect of receiving housing assistance versus not receiving assistance on health and 
economic outcomes have often relied on data from individual public housing authorities or 
smaller samples.12 Some studies focusing on particular cities have reported that 
improvements in housing stability and affordability can lead to better educational outcomes 
for children,18,19 but it is unclear whether this is driven by methodology or particular 
samples.20 Evidence for the impacts of housing assistance on adult health outcomes is 
somewhat mixed,21 and there have been no national studies examining physical and mental 
health benefits for adults gaining access to housing assistance.
We examined whether receiving housing assistance is associated with improved health and 
well-being using a nationally representative sample of the US population. Specifically, we 
examined whether entry into housing assistance was associated with better reported health or 
reduced psychological distress relative to awaiting admission and whether there were 
differential effects associated with the 3 primary program categories: public housing, 
housing choice vouchers, and multifamily housing. Furthermore, we explored whether the 
health effects of housing assistance are mediated by neighborhood characteristics.
METHODS
We linked the annual National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) with HUD administrative 
data to examine relationships between the housing and health of the HUD housing-assisted 
population.22 This linkage provided information on the housing assistance history of NHIS 
respondents during the period of HUD administrative records. The HUD administrative 
records cover the period 1999 to 2014 and are linked to NHIS survey respondents during the 
period 1999 to 2012.

 Sample
To be linkage eligible, NHIS survey respondents had to provide sufficient personally 
identifiable information: Social Security number (including last 4 digits), date of birth, and 
gender. The final NHIS–HUD link included 264 031 eligible adult (aged ≥ 18 y) respondents 
interviewed by NHIS (1999–2012). At the time of their interview, 8695 individuals (3.4% of 
the sample) were current housing assistance recipients: 2065 in public housing, 3822 in 
housing choice vouchers, and 2808 in multifamily housing. Additionally, there were 
respondents who would enter housing assistance within 2 years of their NHIS interview: 
1105 in public housing, 1792 in housing choice vouchers, and 1194 in multifamily housing.
In our analysis of psychological distress, we used the NHIS Sample Adult file (a subset of 
the total person sample). In this analysis 8049 individuals were currently receiving housing 
assistance: 1912 in public housing, 3509 in housing choice vouchers, and 2628 in 
multifamily housing. Additionally, 3362 respondents would enter housing assistance within 
2 years: 924 in public housing, 1433 in housing choice vouchers, and 1005 in multifamily 
housing.
Dependent Variables
We assessed the association between health and housing assistance using reported health 
status and psychological distress as reported in the interview. Household reference persons 
rated the health of respondents as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor, and we 
dichotomized this response as fair or poor versus good, very good, or excellent. Reported 
health status takes into account current health conditions as well as individual health 
trajectories over time, and it is one of the best known predictors of subsequent mortality.23
Psychological distress, an indicator of mental health, was measured using the Kessler-6 
scale,24 which asks respondents how often they experience various feelings of distress. 
Responses to individual items range from 0 (never) to 4 (almost all the time). The Kessler-6 
score is the sum of the values for the 6 items; we recoded this score with 13 or greater 
denoting “serious psychological distress.” This scale predicts major depressive disorder and 
best reflects nonspecific psychological distress in population-based studies.24
Housing Assistance Status
The primary exposure was respondents’ receipt of HUD housing assistance, including the 
timing and program category of each episode of housing assistance. Previous research has 
been limited by the inability to isolate the effect of housing assistance itself from factors that 
affect both participation in HUD housing assistance and health outcomes.25,26 To overcome 
this methodological limitation, we exploited the timing of assistance, comparing current 
recipients with those who were not receiving assistance but would enter assisted housing 
within 2 years (future assistance). As waits for public housing agency–administered housing 
assistance average 2 years,1 these future assistance individuals were likely to resemble those 
on HUD waitlists. These individuals thus formed an excellent comparison group for those 
currently receiving assistance.27 This approach allowed us to account for unobserved 
differences between individuals who obtained housing assistance and those who did not 
(e.g., selection bias).

 We categorized respondents by timing and program category, with each respondent 
appearing in only 1 group for each variable. There may be some selection in which 
respondents enter a particular housing program, reflecting either self-selection or geographic 
differences in the number of housing units associated with each housing program; therefore, 
we coded respondents in the future assistance category on the basis of the program category 
corresponding with the first HUD program they entered (e.g., future public housing).
The waitlist times of those in the future assistance group varied across local public housing 
agencies, and we performed a supplemental analysis (Appendix A, available in a supplement 
to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph.org) using only those for whom 
waitlist information was available in the data linkage. The waitlist data were limited in that 
information on waitlist entry dates may have been of questionable quality in the HUD data 
and were unavailable for multifamily housing.22 However, the similarity of these results to 
our main results suggests that the future assistance group represented a good approximation 
of those on HUD waitlists. The models in Appendix B (available as a supplement to the 
online version of this article at http://www.ajph.org) consider each housing program 
category separately.
Covariates
We adjusted for individual characteristics, including age (linear and quadratic terms), 
gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other), family 
size, presence of children in the household, education (<high school, high school, >high 
school), family income to poverty ratio (<50%, 50%–99%, 100%–199%, ≥200%), 
employment status (employed, unemployed, not in labor force), insurance status (private 
insurance, public insurance, uninsured, unknown), other assistance program participation 
(the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children), and year of interview. Models including year as 
a categorical variable showed no differences from the main analysis.
We also included socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of census tracts, because 
receiving housing assistance may be associated with changes in neighborhood disadvantage 
for recipients. We obtained census tract characteristics from the 2000 Census Summary File 
3 and the 2005 to 2009 American Community Survey and used the National Center for 
Health Statistics– linked geocode files. Characteristics included median income, poverty 
rate, percentage unemployed, percentage receiving public assistance, percentage in 
professional occupations, percentage female-headed households, percentage renter-occupied 
housing, and percentage living in a different house 5 years before.
We used principal components analysis to isolate combinations of neighborhood factors. 
This produced 2 components, which together accounted for 69% of the total variance of 
these variables. The first component (neighborhood disadvantage) was loaded with the 
poverty rate (0.42) and the percentage receiving public assistance (0.38). The second 
component (neighborhood instability) was associated with percentage living in a different 
house 5 years before (0.47) and percentage renter-occupied housing (0.40). We also included 
a measure of neighborhood racial composition, categorizing tracts as mostly White (>90%), 
mostly Black (>90%), mostly Hispanic (>50%), or mixed race (all other compositions).

 Analysis
For each health outcome, we used logistic regression to examine the relationship between 
housing assistance timing (future vs current assistance) and reported fair or poor health or 
psychological distress. We included an interaction between program category and timing to 
test for program category differences in the effect of moving from future assistance to 
current assistance. We calculated predictive margins to obtain estimated probabilities of each 
health outcome by housing assistance timing and HUD program category using the margins 
command in Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). This technique has been 
shown to improve some of the uncertainties in the interpretation of interaction effects in 
logistic regression models.28 Our reported probabilities are average marginal effects across 
all covariate distributions, but we found no major differences when calculating conditional 
marginal effects for different race, income, and education levels (results not shown).
Our analyses account for the complex survey design of the NHIS and incorporate weights 
created by the National Center for Health Statistics that account for both linkage eligibility 
and nonresponse to make estimates representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized US 
population.22 To consider the possibility that the effects of housing assistance on health 
outcomes reflect the duration of time spent in assisted housing, our analysis shown in 
Appendix C (available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org) restricted current recipients to those who had been receiving housing 
assistance for less than 2 years. Appendix D (available as a supplement to the online version 
of this article at http://www.ajph.org) presents the average marginal effects separately by 
race/ethnicity.
RESULTS
Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the analytic sample by timing of housing 
assistance and program category are shown in Table 1. Overall, HUD housing assistance 
recipients had low levels of socioeconomic status. More than 50% of all individuals in the 
sample had family income below the federal poverty level, including 65% of current 
recipients in each program. Current and future recipients had similar demographic profiles, 
with no differences in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, or education. When compared with 
future recipients, current residents were older, had lower family income, were less likely to 
be employed, and were more likely to have public health insurance, which may reflect the 
wait for housing assistance. Recipients of housing choice vouchers tended to experience 
lower neighborhood disadvantage than did those in other program categories. Current public 
housing residents were less likely to report serious psychological distress than were future 
residents (P <.05).
The models depicted in Table 2 predict the odds of fair or poor health and serious 
psychological distress status as a function of housing assistance timing and program 
category. These models include an interaction between timing of housing assistance and 
program category that enabled us to examine differences in the effect of housing assistance 
among different program categories. The first column shows reported fair or poor health. 
The main effect of housing timing in this model refers specifically to housing choice 
vouchers, the omitted category. There were no differences by housing assistance timing for

 those who had housing choice vouchers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.90, 1.25). We obtained the housing timing coefficients for public housing and 
multifamily housing by multiplying the main effect by the interaction. Current residents had 
lower odds of fair or poor health than did future public housing residents (1.05 × 0.73 = 
0.77; 95% CI = 0.58, 0.99). Current multifamily housing residents also had lower odds of 
fair or poor health than did future residents (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.60, 0.98).
Using the model shown in the second column, we examined the effects of housing assistance 
on the odds of reporting serious psychological distress. There was a significant reduction in 
the odds of psychological distress for residents of public housing. Current residents had 
lower odds of serious psychological distress than did future public housing residents (OR = 
0.59; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.88). We did not find a difference in psychological distress between 
current and future recipients of housing choice vouchers or residents of multifamily housing.
The marginal probabilities (Table 3) indicate that the percentage reporting fair or poor health 
was reduced by 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = 0.8, 8.9; P = .02) for current public housing 
residents and by 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = 1.13, 8.5; P = .01) for current multifamily 
housing residents compared with future residents. Current public housing residents also 
experienced a reduction in serious psychological distress of 5.4 percentage points compared 
with future residents (95% CI = 1.8, 9.1; P = .002), from 14.7% to 9.3%.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first nationally representative study of the relationship between 
HUD housing assistance programs and adult health outcomes in the United States. It is also 
the first, to our knowledge, to explore the heterogeneous effects of major housing assistance 
programs on health. Our results demonstrate that receiving housing assistance is associated 
with a benefit for low-income adults but that this effect depends on the specific program 
category of assistance. Entering public housing and multifamily housing led to an 
improvement in reported health status relative to not yet receiving these types of assistance. 
The likelihood of serious psychological distress was also lower among individuals residing 
in public housing than among individuals who had yet to enter public housing. We did not 
find consistent health benefits for those who received housing choice vouchers, which 
constituted almost half of all HUD-assisted units.1 Although the total number of housing 
units managed under all HUD programs has increased by 20% since 1997, public housing 
units as a proportion of all units have decreased from 32% in 1997 to 22% in 2015.1
Adults who live in public housing are considerably less likely to experience serious 
psychological distress than are future public housing residents, an effect not observed for 
other housing assistance programs. Although this is a notable difference, future public 
housing residents have poorer health than do those who enter housing choice vouchers or 
multifamily housing. The improvement may reflect the presence of a network effect in 
which public housing reinforces social networks in neighborhoods with particularly high 
disadvantages. Historically, public housing projects were exceptionally dense, and the 
density of public housing today remains higher than the average in US cities.13 In contrast 
with housing choice voucher programs, public housing may consolidate limited social

 resources for low-income families.29 A concentration of individuals with similar social and 
economic experiences, health needs, and requirements for services may provide an informal 
source of information and support.30 Indeed, although public housing may increase 
neighborhood disadvantage, it does not appear to reduce social capital for low-income 
residents.31 Future research should work to identify the particular mechanisms that link 
public housing residence to improved health.
Our results are unable to demonstrate consistent health benefits for recipients of housing 
choice vouchers. This may partially reflect heterogeneity in the effect of vouchers across 
subgroups,15 which may make it difficult to identify effects. Effect heterogeneity may stem 
from programmatic changes to the voucher program that occurred between 2005 and 2013, 
including changes to the rent ceiling, changes in the size of voucher subsidies across public 
housing agencies, and the localization of fair market rents for voucher units.32 Collinson and 
Ganong33 demonstrate that whereas increasing the subsidy to voucher households across a 
metropolitan area had little impact on neighborhood quality outcomes, policies that relate 
subsidy increases to area rents had positive impacts on neighborhood outcomes.
Consequently, we may be unable to identify health benefits of housing choice vouchers if 
these policy changes are directed to particularly high-need communities. Although having an 
increase in disposable resources as a result of having housing assistance may contribute to 
the health benefits we observed for public housing and multifamily housing, the policy 
changes may reduce the salience of income effects for housing choice vouchers.14 
Furthermore, effects estimated separately by race/ethnicity (Appendix D) suggest that 
programs may have differential benefits for population subgroups, which should be an area 
for future research.
Although we are unable to examine the effect of changing neighborhoods over time, the 
effects of housing assistance on health do not appear to be mediated by neighborhood 
characteristics. We do find that housing choice vouchers provide families access to less 
disadvantaged neighborhoods than do public housing and multifamily housing. This is 
consistent with evidence that vouchers lead to reduced neighborhood disadvantage,34 but we 
did not find that this leads to improved health and well-being for voucher recipients. This 
may imply that the health benefits of improved neighborhoods may develop over a longer 
period of time.17 Future work should establish the precise relationship between housing 
program, neighborhood characteristics, and health outcomes.
Limitations and Strengths
Our analysis has limitations that should be noted. First, the NHIS–HUD link contained 
longitudinal information on housing status but did not capture changes in health over time as 
a function of housing assistance. Therefore, we were unable to explicitly model the 
relationship between duration of housing assistance and health. Our results in Appendix C 
suggest that the observed health benefits of housing assistance are not driven by duration 
effects, because adults who have lived in HUD housing for less than 2 years show similar 
benefits. Because we compared individuals living in HUD-assisted housing to those who 
would enter within 2 years, health differences that manifest relatively quickly were more 
easily captured.

 Second, our analytical strategy compared those receiving housing assistance with those 
entering assisted housing within 2 years. Although this helps to adjust for unobserved 
characteristics of the assisted housing population, it means that we can only generalize our 
results to the population who receives assistance, and not necessarily to the broader 
population who might have been eligible for assistance but did not receive it.
Third, our analysis did not explicitly compare housing assistance recipients with individuals 
who were actually known to be on HUD waitlists. Waitlist information is unavailable for 
multifamily housing programs in HUD administrative records, but our results shown in 
Appendix A are nearly identical for public housing and housing choice vouchers when 
restricting future recipients to those determined to be on a waitlist at the time of interview.
Finally, we were unable to examine the effects of providing housing to formerly homeless 
individuals, because NHIS is a household survey. However, considering the effect of 
homelessness and health, the inclusion of the formerly homeless might expand the benefits 
we observed for housing assistance.
The strengths of this study are the use of a large national sample from linked survey and 
administrative data, evaluating effects of specific program categories, and considering the 
role of neighborhood-level characteristics. Additionally, our analytic technique, comparing 
current housing assistance recipients with future recipients, reduced issues of selection bias 
in the receipt of assistance. Because the data linkage procedure confirmed that future 
recipients would enter HUD-assisted housing within 2 years of the interview, we implicitly 
accounted for differences between groups in motivation to participate and the local 
availability of HUD-assisted housing, which may be problematic using other study designs.
Public Health Implications
We have provided evidence that HUD public housing is associated with a reduction in the 
likelihood of poor health and psychological distress. Because of recent interest in 
approaches to improve health through interventions that target community, social– 
structural, and environmental factors,35 understanding the relationship between HUD 
housing assistance and health is likely to be of interest and value to researchers and 
policymakers.
