Abstract
Aims To analyze the risk of incident cataract (diagnosis or extraction) in patients with or without diabetes focusing on other
comorbid conditions, antidiabetic drug use, and diabetes duration.
Methods The study population comprised newly diagnosed diabetes patients (≥40 years) from the UK-based Clinical
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 2000 and 2015, and a random sample of the general population matched for
age, sex, general practice, and year of diabetes diagnosis. We assessed cataract incidence rates (IRs) and performed a nested
case-control analysis in the diabetic cohort to assess potential risk factors for a cataract.
Results There were 56,510 diabetes patients included in the study. IRs of cataract were 20.4 (95% CI 19.8–20.9) per 1000
person-years (py) in patients with diabetes and 10.8 (95% CI 10.5–11.2) per 1000 py in the general population. IRs increased
considerably around the age of 80 years and with a concomitant diagnosis of macular edema. The incidence rate ratio (IRR)
was highest in patients of the age group of 45–54 years. In the nested case-control study, we identified 5800 patients with
cataract. Risk of cataract increased with increasing diabetes duration (adj. OR 5.14, 95% CI 4.19–6.30 diabetes for ≥10 years
vs. diabetes <2 years).
Conclusions According to our study, diabetes is associated with an approximately two-fold increased detection rate of
cataract. The risk of cataract associated with diabetes is highest at younger ages. Patients with diabetic macular edema are at
an increased risk for cataract as well as patients with long-standing diabetes.
Introduction
Cataract is the primary cause of blindness worldwide [1]. It
is defined as a decrease in the transparency of the crystalline
lens and can be further differentiated into nuclear, cortical,
or posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) [2]. Main risk fac-
tors in the developed world, besides advanced age, appear
to be smoking [3], exposure to sunlight [4], and use of
corticosteroids [5, 6]. A potential association between
female gender and cataract remains controversial [7, 8].
Several studies have reported diabetes as a risk factor for
cataract [9]. However, there are only few studies conducted
with data from the UK [10–13], and only one previous
study from the 1980s reported on incidence rates of cataract
in a diabetic population [11].
The aim of this study was to assess incidence rates of
cataract (diagnosis or extraction, subsequently named
“diagnosis” throughout the manuscript) in patients newly
diagnosed with diabetes and treated medically (aged 40
years or older at the time of the first diabetes diagnosis), and

 to compare them with individuals without diabetes from the
general population. Furthermore, we aimed to quantify
comorbid conditions, as well as prior diabetes medication
use in diabetic patients with cataract, and we explored the
association between diabetes duration, diabetic control, and
cataract diagnosis risk.
Methods
Data source
We performed a retrospective observational study using
data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).
This database provides health care information on some 10
million patients in the UK and has been previously
described in detail [14, 15]. General practitioners (GPs)
record information on demographics, diagnoses, and drug
prescriptions, as well as on patient referrals and hospital
admissions, using standardized coding systems, the READ
codes. The Read clinical terminology system includes
occupation; social circumstances, clinical signs and symp-
toms, laboratory tests and results, diagnoses, diagnostic,
therapeutic or surgical procedures performed, as well as
administrative
items.
The
GPs
generate
prescriptions
directly
with
the
computer,
and
this
information
is
automatically transcribed into individual computerized
patient records. In addition, the CPRD records information
on
body
mass
index
(BMI)
and
lifestyle
variables
including alcohol consumption and smoking. Recorded
information on drug exposure and on diagnoses has been
validated repeatedly and has proven to be of high quality
[16, 17]. The CPRD currently covers about 7% of the UK
population,
and
enrolled
patients
are
representative
of the UK with regard to age, sex, and geographic dis-
tribution [18]. The CPRD is managed by the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in
the UK. The study protocol was reviewed and approved
by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for
MHRA
database
research
(ISAC,
reference
number
16_065) and was made available to the journal reviewers.
The investigators had access to anonymous information
only.
Study design
We first calculated incidence rates (IRs) of cataract (defined
as (a) a cataract diagnosis or a recorded cataract surgery and
(b) cataract surgery only) in patients with a first-time
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, compared to matched
diabetes-free controls. We also assessed IRs in subgroups of
diabetes patients with a diagnosis of macular edema or
retinopathy at any time in their patient records.
In addition, we conducted a nested case-control analysis
which we restricted to patients with diabetes, to further
study diabetes-associated potential risk factors for a cataract
diagnosis.
Study population
To be considered a diabetic patient, an individual must have
had a READ code for diabetes mellitus plus two or more
prescriptions for medications for diabetes recorded within
6 months prior to and until 1 year after the first-time
diagnosis of diabetes. The date of the first recording of
either the diabetes diagnosis or the prescription for a dia-
betes medication was considered the start of follow-up.
Patients had to be 40 years or older at the time of the
diabetes diagnosis to be included. We matched diabetes-free
patients from the comparison group to diabetic patients on
age, sex, GP, and year of diabetes diagnosis (i.e., we fol-
lowed diabetes-free patients from the same year on as the
matched patient with diabetes). The study period was Jan-
uary 2000 to December 2015.
All individuals included in the study population were
required to have a minimum of 3 years of medical history in
the database prior to either the first diabetes diagnosis, or—
in the comparison group—before the start of follow-up to
contribute person-time.
We excluded individuals with a diagnosis (at any time in
the record) of congenital cataract, cancer (except non-
melanoma skin cancer), HIV, or alcoholism, patients with a
diagnosis of glaucoma, glaucoma surgery, one or more
prescriptions for drugs to treat glaucoma, traumatic or
secondary cataract, as well as individuals with binocular
blindness, cataract, or cataract extraction recorded before
the start of follow-up.
Outcome definition
We defined cataract patients as those with a READ code for
cataract (diagnosis or cataract extraction) entered in the
medical records by the GP.
Covariates
In the nested case-control analysis, we assessed previous
drug prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs prior to the catar-
act, categorized by the number of prescriptions before the
index date (i.e., the cataract diagnosis or extraction date).
Additional covariates of interest were diabetes duration and
diabetic control, expressed as the average HbA1c level of
the recordings during the last 3 years preceding the index
date. We also assessed the distribution of HbA1c levels
in diabetic cataract cases with or without the use of
insulin. Furthermore, we assessed smoking status (never,

 ex-smoker, current, or unknown), body mass index (BMI <
25, 25–29.9, ≥30 kg/m2, unknown), and by means of READ
codes various recorded comorbidities such as cardiovas-
cular diagnoses (ischemic heart disease, congestive heart
failure, stroke, or hypertension), as well as asthma/COPD or
hyperlipidemia. We included all recordings prior to the
cataract diagnosis/surgery in the definition of the comorbid
status.
Statistical analysis
We calculated incidence rates of first-time cataract sepa-
rately for the diabetic cohort and for the matched indivi-
duals from the diabetes-free population, stratified by age
(40–44, 45–49, 50–54, …, and ≥90 years), sex and calendar
year of cataract occurrence. We computed the person-years
at risk individually for each person in the study population.
We assessed the person-time from the date of entry into the
study until the patient had a cataract or any of the exclusion
criteria recorded, the patient left the CPRD, died, or the
study ended in December 2015, whichever came first. We
used incident cases of cataract as the numerator, and
the sum of person-years in the study population as the
denominator within age, sex, and calendar year strata. For
the subgroup analyses, we calculated person-time in
patients
with
diabetic
retinopathy
or
macular
edema
(defined by READ diagnoses codes), and we assessed the
number of incident cataract cases in those groups, using the
same stratification as for the total sample.
For the nested case-control analysis we only included
patients with diabetes. In addition to diabetic cases with an
incident cataract during follow-up, we identified from
among the diabetic portion of the study population a control
group of patients without cataract. The date of the first-time
recording of a cataract was defined as the “index date”. We
matched controls to cases by risk set sampling on year of
birth, sex, index date, and years of history on the database.
We attempted to find four control patients per case. We
compared cases and controls with respect to the prevalence
of diagnosed comorbidities, antidiabetic drug use prior to
the cataract, as well as other covariates (see above) by
conditional logistic regression analyses. We assessed the
association between duration of diabetes history and the risk
of cataract, and we included other covariates (as potential
confounding factors) in the model to see if they changed the
relative risk estimate (odds ratio) by >10%.
We conducted the analyses with the statistical software
SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA, version 9.4).
Power calculation was performed before the conduct of the
study to ensure adequate power to detect an OR of 1.2 or
more for the association of metformin exposure and sub-
sequent cataract development at a significance level of 5%.
Incidence rates and relative risk estimates (odds ratios
(ORs)) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
For confidentiality reasons (as required by the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA), cells
containing <5 patients are marked with “x” and not display
the actual number of cases.

 Results
Follow-up analysis
We identified 56,510 patients with a first-time diagnosis
of
diabetes
(with
two
or
more
antidiabetic
drugs
prescribed within the predefined time period), and the same
number of patients in the comparison group without dia-
betes. Mean age at start of follow-up was 60.1 years (SD
11.4 years).
Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios are displayed in
Tables 1a and 1b. The incidence rates (IRs) of cataract
increased considerably around the age of 70 years until very
advanced age, with the highest IRs in the age category
85–89 years. The incidence rate ratio (IRR, the ratio of IRs
between diabetics and non-diabetics), however, was highest
in patients of the age group of 45–54 years. Incidence rates
per year of cataract diagnosis did not vary much during the
study period (results not shown). The incidence rate of
cataract diagnosis in diabetes patients with a diagnosis of
macular edema recorded at any time in their patient records
was considerably higher than in the general diabetic popu-
lation (59.0, 95% CI 49.4–68.6). The incidence rate of
cataract diagnosis in diabetes patients with retinopathy
appeared to be only slightly higher than in the overall dia-
betic population (26.3, 95% CI 25.1–27.4).
Nested case-control analysis among patients with
diabetes
We included a total of 5800 cataract cases and 21,432
matched controls in the nested case-control analysis. Mean
age of the cases and controls was 72.1 (±9.3) years. In total
50% of the cataract cases were women. The mean duration
of medical history recorded in the CPRD before the index
date was 15.8 (±5.1) years in cases and 16.0 (±5.0) years in
controls.
The main characteristics of diabetic cataract cases and
controls are displayed in Table 2. Current smokers com-
pared with non-smokers, and obese patients compared with
normal weight patients, were not at increased risk of
developing cataract.
The risk of a cataract diagnosis rose with higher HbA1c
level and was 20% increased for the highest HbA1c level
(test for trend, p < 0.0001). HbA1c of 58 mmol/mol or more
was observed in 56.8% of insulin users and in 30.5% of
diabetics without insulin therapy. Cataract diagnosis risk
was considerably increased in patients with long-term
steroid exposure (Table 3; ≥30 prescriptions: adj. OR
1.87, 95% CI 1.62–2.16). Diabetes duration was sig-
nificantly associated with the risk of a cataract diagnosis
(test for trend: p < 0.001). Antidiabetic drug treatment did
not yield any clear associations with cataract diagnosis risk.

 Discussion
This large observational study provides evidence for an
increased risk of cataract diagnosis in patients with diabetes
compared to a diabetes-free control group. This trend stayed
the same if cataract cases were defined as either having a
mere cataract diagnosis or a cataract surgery (Table 1a) or if
only cases with cataract surgery were considered (Table 1b).
The incidence rates of cataract diagnosis in diabetic patients
with a diagnosis of macular edema were considerably
higher than in the general diabetic population. Incidence
rates of cataract diagnosis in diabetics with retinopathy
appeared to be only slightly higher than in the overall dia-
betic population.
There has only been one previous study reporting inci-
dence rates of cataract in diabetic patients in the UK [11].

 This study, however, used data collected at visits of out-
patient clinics, and some data were derived from self-
completed questionnaires by the patients between 1979 and
1992. The authors were in a position to distinguish between
type 1 diabetes (“insulin dependent”) and type 2 diabetes,
T2DM, (“non-insulin treated” and “insulin-treated non-
insulin dependent diabetes”). Our study sample most
likely encompassed only individuals with type 2 diabetes
(since a first-time diabetes diagnosis was required to have
been recorded after the age of 39 years), but we did not
differentiate between insulin-treated and non-insulin treated
type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, both studies found a higher
risk of cataract in diabetic women than men. The incidence
rates of cataract diagnosis in our study seemed to be slightly
higher (overall 20.4 per 1000 person-years (py) vs. 11.7 and
17.8 per 1000 py, for non-insulin treated T2DM and
insulin-treated T2DM respectively, in the study by Jan-
ghorbani et al. [11]. Both studies observed increased rates
of cataract in the subgroup of diabetic patients with reti-
nopathy. Furthermore, both studies found a statistically
significant positive trend for the association between dia-
betes duration and risk of cataract, and both yielded
increased relative risks for cataract with higher HbA1c
levels. An increased risk of cataract for diabetic women
compared to men has also previously been reported in the
UK (relative risk of 7.85, 95% CI 4.30–14.3, in women vs.
RR of 3.42, 95% CI 2.05–5.70 in men) [10]. This study also
reported a higher risk for diabetic cataract in the younger
age groups (RR of 12.6, 95% CI 2.76–57.9, for age 50–59,
RR of 5.56, 95% CI 2.74–11.3, for age 60–69, and RR of
4.20, 95% CI 2.58–6.83, for age 70–79), a finding which
corresponds to the higher IRRs in individuals below the
age of 55 years observed in the current study. Thus, our data
are consistent with findings from previous studies reporting
that cataract development occurs more frequently at an
earlier age in diabetes patients compared to diabetes-free
controls.
Outside the UK, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of
Diabetic Retinopathy investigated the incidence of cataract
extraction in people with diabetes [19]. Age (OR of 1.79,
95% CI 1.47–2.18) and use of insulin (OR of 2.11, 95% CI
1.43–3.11) were associated with increased risk of cataract in
patients with type 2 diabetes. We also observed an increased
risk of cataract diagnosis in insulin users. The higher per-
centage of poor glycemic control in insulin users compared
with diabetics without insulin therapy may be an explana-
tion for this observation (59.4% vs. 31.7% of patients with
cataract and HbA1c ≥ 58 mmol/mol).
Our study has several limitations. Because cataract is
developing slowly over a period of time, the date of the
initial recording of cataract (or cataract surgery), i.e., the
index date, does not equal the actual cataract onset.
Therefore,
assessing
the
association
of cataract
with
previous exposure to diabetes medication or with diabetes
duration up to the index date remains somewhat arbitrary.
Furthermore, we were not in the position to differentiate
between the three types of cataract, as the diagnosis codes
most often used by the GPs were general cataract codes. In
addition, diabetic patients receive regular eye checks from
the hospital eye service whereas in the general population,
detection of early cataracts with no impact on vision may
not necessarily be fed back to the GP by the optometrist if
mild and not requiring intervention. Thus, there may be a
slight ‘over-reporting’ in the diabetes group compared to the
general population who are not having regular eye checks.
Our incidence rates may therefore rather reflect detection
rates as this was an observational study and no intervention
study. In addition, we did not perform a case validation on
cataract diagnosis cases for this study; however, a recent
validation study by Kang et al. [20] of cataract codes in the
CPRD found a positive predictive value for the cataract
code algorithm of 92.0% (90.3–93.7%). To increase the
likelihood of studying true diabetes patients, we only
included diabetic patients who received medical treatment
within a predefined time frame around the diabetes
diagnosis.
Our study has several strengths. The data source is a
well-established primary care database of high quality and
completeness. The information on drug exposure and
diagnoses was recorded prospectively and independent of a
study hypothesis, thereby recall bias could not have influ-
enced our results. Furthermore, by excluding all patients
with <3 years of recorded history in the database prior to
the first-time diagnosis of diabetes, we minimized the risk
of including prevalent diabetes cases. We were able to
incorporate many potential confounders in our analysis,
such as BMI, smoking, a range of comorbid conditions and
prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs.
In conclusion, this large observational study demon-
strates that incidence rates of cataract diagnosis in patients
with diabetes are higher than among diabetic-free patients,
particularly at younger age. The overall approximately
twofold increased risk of cataract diagnosis associated with
diabetes increases with diabetes duration. Patients with
diabetic macular edema are at an increased risk for a cat-
aract diagnosis.
Summary
What was known before
●
Diabetes is a known risk factor for cataract.
●
There are only few studies conducted on that topic with
data from the UK, and only one previous study from the
1980s reported on incidence rates of cataract in a
diabetic population.

C. Becker et al.
 What this study adds
●
IRs of cataract were 20.4 (95% CI 19.8–20.9) per 1000
person-years (py) in patients with diabetes and 10.8
(95% CI 10.5–11.2) per 1000 py in the general
population.
●
IRs increased considerably around the age of 80 years
and the incidence rate ratio (IRR), was highest in
patients of the age group of 45–54 years.
●
Cataract risk increased with increasing diabetes duration
(adj. OR 5.14, 95% CI 4.19–6.30 for patients with
diabetes for 10 years or more).
