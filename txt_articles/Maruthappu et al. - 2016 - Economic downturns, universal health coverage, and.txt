Abstract: Background 
The global economic crisis has been associated with increased 
unemployment and reduced public-sector expenditure on healthcare (PEH). 
We estimated the effects of changes in unemployment and PEH on cancer 
mortality, and identified how universal healthcare coverage (UHC) 
influenced the change. 
 
Methods 
Data were obtained from the World Bank and WHO (1990-2010). Mortality 
data from female breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, which have 
survival rates that exceed 50%, were aggregated into a 'treatable' cancer 
class.  Lung and pancreatic cancers, which have five-year survival rates 
<10%, were likewise aggregated to give an 'untreatable' cancer category. 
Multivariable regression analysis was used, controlling for country-
specific demographics and infrastructure, with time-lag analyses and 
robustness checks to explore the relationship between unemployment and 
PEH on cancer mortality, with and without UHC. Trend analysis was used to 
project mortality rates based on trends prior to the sharp unemployment 
rise experienced by many countries from 2008 to 2010, and compare them 
with observed rates. 
 
Results 
Data were available for 75 countries (unemployment analysis) and 79 
countries (PEH analysis). Unemployment rises were significantly 
associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific 
cancers save for female-lung cancer. Untreatable cancer mortality by 
contrast was not significantly linked with changes in unemployment. Lag 
analyses showed significant associations remained five years after 
unemployment increases for the treatable cancer class. Re-running 
analyses while accounting for UHC status removed the significant 
associations. All-cancer, treatable cancer, and specific cancer 
mortalities significantly decreased as PEH increased. Associations held 
over a five-year period regardless of whether UHC was present. Time-
series analysis found just over 40 000 estimated excess deaths due to a 
subset of treatable cancers from 2008-2010 based on 2000-2007 trends. The 
great majority of these deaths were from non-UHC countries. 
 
 Interpretation 
Unemployment increases are associated with cancer mortality increases. 
There is evidence that UHC protects against mortality increases 
associated with rises in unemployment, while PEH increases are associated 
with reduced cancer mortality. Reduced access to healthcare may underlie 
these associations.

INTRODUCTION 
75 
 
76 
The global economic crisis, which began in 2008, compelled many countries to cut public spending in 
77 
order to reduce public-sector borrowing.1 These spending cuts often entailed either reductions or a 
78 
flattening in public-sector jobs and public-sector expenditure on healthcare (PEH).2,3 Thirty three of 53 
79 
WHO European region countries underwent no change in PEH between 2008 and 2009, while six 
80 
experienced a reduction in PEH,4 which have prompted concerns about the possible negative effects on 
81 
public health. Studies have demonstrated that long-term unemployment leads to increased suicide rates 
82 
and reduced healthcare access.5,6 
83 
 
84 
Ecological studies exploring health-economic trends in the short run (separate from residual or secular 
85 
trends) have thus far focused on macroeconomic changes and outcome indicators, such as suicide rates, 
86 
cardiovascular disease incidence, all-cause mortality, and specific forms of cancer, but not cancer per 
87 
se.3,7–15 These potential associations may predominantly be explained by behavioural, mental, or stress-
88 
related changes with direct and immediate effects, whether, as in the case of suicides, they are counter-
89 
cyclical associations linked to the direct psychological and financial impact of job loss,16 or pro-cyclical 
90 
associations linked to reduced injury-related work and lifestyle activities in the case of all-cause 
91 
mortality.9 Few studies, however, have analysed the relationship between economic downturns and 
92 
cancer especially in countries that may be more susceptible to economic shocks due to limited social 
93 
security and healthcare systems.  
94 
 
95 
Establishing a causal relationship between an economic change, such as aggregate unemployment, on 
96 
cancer mortality is challenging, as downstream effects of unemployment-induced behavioural changes 
97 
on lifestyle-related cancers manifest much later (20–30 years) than, for example, suicide or acute, 
98 
stress-related cardiovascular events. However, access to healthcare and PEH may act as mediating 
99 
factors with more immediate effects on health outcomes. One study on the Great Depression found 
100 
deaths from cancer correlated with reduced income,17 although the lack of treatment options for patients 
101 
presenting with late-stage disease meant that the effect of the economic downturn on reduced healthcare 
102 
access and mortality could not be as strongly demonstrated as it could in an era where systemic 
103 
treatment is now available. 
104 
 
105 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012, with 
106 
estimates suggesting a rise in annual cancer cases from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million by 2030.18 
107 
Hence an understanding of the effects of macroeconomic changes on cancer outcomes worldwide is 
108 
important. 
109 
 5 
 
 
110 
We examined the association between changes in aggregate unemployment and PEH with deaths due to 
111 
specific cancers, groups of cancers, and all cancers for countries where data was available and deemed 
112 
of sufficient quality (1990–2010). Mortality was considered a more reliable measure of health outcomes 
113 
than incidence due to the susceptibility of the latter to artificial rises following the adoption of improved 
114 
means of diagnosis. We chose unemployment due to its ability to capture changes in individuals’ 
115 
circumstances, especially in the lower-income strata of societies. Given the recent drive, in many 
116 
countries, to implement universal healthcare coverage (UHC),19 we explored whether UHC conferred a 
117 
protective effect. We also estimated the difference between the actual numbers of cancer-related deaths 
118 
during and after the recent economic downturn and the expected numbers based on prior trends. For 
119 
convenience, we have used the term ‘excess deaths’ to denote those estimated differences for which the 
120 
number of deaths was higher than expected.

METHODS 
124 
 
125 
Data sources 
126 
Economic data were obtained from the World Bank’s Development Indicators & Global Development 
127 
Finance 2013 edition datasets.20 Unemployment (World Bank data code: SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS) was 
128 
defined as the share of the labour force without work but available and seeking employment.20 PEH 
129 
(World Bank data code: SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS) was measured as a percentage of gross domestic product 
130 
(GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP); it was defined by the World Bank as including all rent and 
131 
capital spending from government budgets (central and local), external borrowings and grants 
132 
(including donations from international agencies and non-governmental organisations), and social (or 
133 
compulsory) health insurance funds. Unemployment and cancer mortality (see below) data for 1990 to 
134 
2010 were available for 75 countries and data on PEH and cancer mortality for 1990 to 2009 were 
135 
available for four additional countries (table 1), representing, as of 2009, 2.106 billion and 2.156 billion 
136 
people in each dataset, respectively.20 Classification of countries into high- and middle-income was 
137 
done according to the World Bank’s Atlas Method.21 In brief, middle-income countries are those with a 
138 
gross national income per capita of more than $1 045 but less than $12 736, whereas high-income 
139 
economies are those with a gross national income per capita of $12 736 or more. Countries were 
140 
classified into those with very high or high human development indices (HDI) according to the UN’s 
141 
Human Development Programme.22 
142 
 
143 
Cancer mortality data (deaths per 100 000) for 1990 to 2010 for the countries in the unemployment and 
144 
PEH datasets were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO) mortality database.23 These 
145 
data are based on death certification and updated annually from civil registration systems of WHO 
146 
member states. Mortality data for prostate (ICD-10 C61), female-breast (ICD-10 C50), lung (male and 
147 
female; ICD-10 C33–C34), colorectal (male and female; ICD-10 C18–C21) cancers and all cancers 
148 
were extracted. Female breast, prostate and colorectal cancers have survival rates that exceed 50%.24 
149 
Notably, at the time data were collected, complete cancer mortality data were unavailable for China, 
150 
India, and countries from sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore aggregated the mortality data for these 
151 
tumour types into a ‘treatable’ cancer class.  Lung and pancreatic cancers (male and female; ICD-10 
152 
C25), which have five-year survival rates <10%, were likewise aggregated to give an ‘untreatable’ 
153 
cancer category.24 Age-standardised death rates (ASDRs), accounting for age distribution differences in 
154 
populations, were extracted for all ages and ages 0–84 for both sexes and each sex separately. For age-
155 
specific cancer mortality rates, we aggregated crude rates (per 100 000 people) for each sex and country 
156 
by 10-year age groups except for the youngest age group (0–34), which was combined to reduce the 
157 
influence of age groups with fewer observations. These crude rates were defined as the number of 
158 
 7 
 
deaths during a calendar year for a particular age group divided by the age group’s mid-year population. 
159 
 
160 
Multivariable regression analysis 
161 
We used multivariable regression analysis to assess the relationship between mortality rates for each 
162 
cancer subtype, treatable cancers, untreatable cancers, and all cancers (response variable), and 
163 
unemployment or PEH (predictor variable). Due to incomplete cancer mortality data for many of the 75 
164 
countries in the unemployment dataset, observations for the year 2010 were excluded from the analysis. 
165 
To ensure that results were not driven by uncontrollable inter-country variations, we used fixed effects 
166 
in the regression models, including one dummy variable for each country in each dataset excluding a 
167 
reference group (i.e. 74 dummy variables for the unemployment dataset and 78 for the PEH dataset; 
168 
table 2). This meant that the regression models evaluated mortality changes within individual countries 
169 
while holding constant time-invariant differences between countries, including higher predispositions to 
170 
cancer as well as political, healthcare, cultural, and structural differences. Multivariable regression with 
171 
fixed effects was used since this methodology has been widely employed in similar studies, and is 
172 
regarded as statistically robust and conservative.25 The population structure of each country was also 
173 
controlled for by incorporating total population size and demographic structure (the percentage of the 
174 
population over 65 years and less than 15 years old) into the model (table 2). Further details of the 
175 
model are provided in appendix S2. 
176 
 
177 
We conducted 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year time-lag analyses. For both datasets, we then classified countries 
178 
into those with UHC and those without, and re-ran the analyses using UHC status as a robustness 
179 
check. Countries were considered to have UHC if all of the following previously described criteria were 
180 
met: legislation mandating UHC; >90% of the population with access to some form of healthcare 
181 
insurance; and >90% of the population with access to skilled birth attendance. The latter criterion was 
182 
used to ensure the implementation of UHC met minimum performance standards expected of a 
183 
functioning healthcare system. To test the sensitivity of our results to this definition, we re-ran the 
184 
analysis using an alternative performance criterion, details of which are included in appendix S1 in the 
185 
Supplementary Material (table S1). Robustness checks are detailed in table 2 and appendix S2. 
186 
 
187 
Trend analysis 
188 
For the all-cancer mortality trend projection analysis, we set strict country inclusion criteria to ensure 
189 
that only high quality data were used. We therefore excluded countries with civil registration coverage 
190 
of cause-of-death less than 90% for the study period,23 eliminating in the process 26 countries from the 
191 
61 for which all-cancer mortality data were complete for 2000 to 2010 (figure 1). In order to limit the 
192 
effect of miscoding and comorbidity (frequent for older population groups), we excluded the 85+ age 
193 
 8 
 
group, and to further ensure robustness in cross-country comparisons, we excluded age groups with 
194 
fewer than 20 deaths in any calendar year. Details of the models used are provided in appendix S3. 
195 
 
196 
Multivariable regression analyses were conducted using Stata SE version 12 (Stata Corporation, Texas, 
197 
USA). Time-series analyses were conducted in R version 2.14.1 (http://www.r-project.org).

RESULTS 
204 
 
205 
Unemployment 
206 
A 1% unemployment rise was associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality for all but 
207 
one of the six cancer sub-types studied: prostate (regression coefficient (R)=0.0981, 95% CI 0.0353–
208 
0.1609; p=0.0022), female-breast (R=0.1583, 95% CI 0.1110–0.2056; p<0.0001), male-lung 
209 
(R=0.2260, 95% CI 0.1216–0.3304; p<0.0001), male-colorectal (R=0.0596, 95% CI 0.0188–0.1003; 
210 
p=0.0042), and female-colorectal (R=0.0676, 95% CI 0.0362–0.099; p<0.0001) (figures 2A-E, figure 
211 
S1A, table S2). The association for female-lung cancer mortality with unemployment was negative (R= 
212 
–0.0593, 95% CI –0.1013 to 0.0172; p=0.0058; figure 2F, table S2). Whereas treatable cancer mortality 
213 
was significantly linked with unemployment (R=0.1256, 95% CI 0.0148–0.2364; p=0.0265) (figure 2G, 
214 
table S2), no such significance was observed for untreatable cancers (R=0.082, 95% CI -0.041–0.205; 
215 
p=0.1919) (figure 2H, table S2). The strongest associations were found in the all-cancer data 
216 
(R=0.3745, 95% CI 0.1939–0.5551; p=0.0001; figure 2I, table S2). Lag analysis showed that these 
217 
results remained through to five years after unemployment increases (figure 2I). These associations held 
218 
and remained significant in the robustness checks performed (tables S3–S9). 
219 
 
220 
On accounting for the UHC status of countries, we found no significant association between 
221 
unemployment and cancer mortality within the first year of unemployment rising (table 3, figures S1B-
222 
C). The results were unaffected by country classifications according to an alternative definition for 
223 
UHC (appendix S1). 
224 
 
225 
Trend analysis 
226 
For the trend analysis, population-weighted mean values of the projected age-specific rates and ASDRs 
227 
for each year and sex were obtained. Globally (for the 35 countries selected), we observed significant 
228 
deviations in the projected ASDR from the observed ASDR for both male all cancer mortality (figure 
229 
3A, table S10) and female all cancer mortality (figure 3B, table S10) with the 2010 predicted ASDR – 3 
230 
years after the unemployment rise in 2007 – deviating the most from the observed ASDR (males: rate 
231 
ratio 1.0362, 95% CI 1.0209–1.052; p<0.0001; females: rate ratio 1.0428, 95% CI 1.0254–1.0607; 
232 
p<0.0001). This corresponded to 55 434 (95% CI 32 439–78 428) excess deaths among men and 53 573 
233 
(95% CI 32 386–74 759) excess deaths among women in 2010 alone. Summing the point estimates for 
234 
males and females from 2008 to 2010 yielded 252,199 excess deaths (figure 3A). This finding was 
235 
recapitulated upon confinement of our analysis to treatable cancers (rate ratio 1.0362, 95% CI 1.0225–
236 
1.0502; p<0.0001; figure 3C, table S10) resulting in 22 977 (95% CI 14 482-31 472) excess deaths in 
237 
2010. By contrast, for untreatable cancers, the deviation between predicted and observed ASDR was not 
238 
 10 
 
significant in 2008, 2009, or 2010 (figure 3D, table S10).  
239 
 
240 
We next asked whether these trends held among different groups of countries. To answer this, we 
241 
extracted ASDRs for the following: 26 countries with UHC implemented and 9 countries without UHC 
242 
as of 2008; 31 high-income countries and 4 middle-income countries as classified by the World Bank 
243 
using the Atlas Method;21 and 22 very high HDI and 13 high HDI countries.22  
244 
 
245 
For the UHC country group, no significant difference was found for treatable cancer ASDR (figure 3E, 
246 
table S10). By contrast, for the non-UHC country group the predicted ASDRs for treatable cancers were 
247 
significantly lower than the observed ASDRs for all 3 projected years (in 2010: rate ratio 1.0746, 95% 
248 
CI 1.0417–1.11; p<0.0001), which equated to 21 241 (95% CI 12 244–30 238) excess deaths due to 
249 
treatable cancers in 2010 (figure 3F, table S10). Differences between the actual and projected ASDR of 
250 
untreatable cancer were non-significant for both UHC and non-UHC country groups in 2008 with a 
251 
significantly lower-than-expected number of deaths in 2009 and 2010 for the UHC country group, and a 
252 
marginally significant higher-than-expected number of deaths in 2010 for the non-UHC country group 
253 
(table S10).  
254 
 
255 
Stratifying countries by income using the World Bank’s classification,21 yielded higher rate ratios 
256 
(indicating higher-than-expected numbers of deaths) for male, female and treatable cancers among 
257 
middle-income countries than among high-income countries (table S10). For untreatable cancers, high-
258 
income countries experienced significantly lower-than expected numbers of deaths whereas middle-
259 
income countries experienced significantly higher-than-expected numbers of deaths (table S10). On 
260 
dividing countries according to HDI, neither the very high nor high HDI groupings experienced higher-
261 
than-expected numbers of untreatable cancer deaths although significantly lower-than expected 
262 
numbers across all years were only observed for the very high HDI group (table S10).  
263 
 
264 
Public-sector expenditure on healthcare 
265 
Increases in PEH, as a proportion of GDP, were significantly associated with mortality reductions in 
266 
seven of the nine cancer categories studied: prostate (R= –0.0013, 95% CI –0.0019 to –0.0008; 
267 
p<0.0001), female-breast (R= –0.0023, 95% CI –0.0029 to –0.0017; p<0.0001), male-lung (R= –
268 
0.0037, 95% CI –0.0045 to –0.0028; p<0.0001), male-colorectal (R= –0.0011, 95% CI –0.0016 to –
269 
0.0007; p<0.0001), female-colorectal (R= –0.0011, 95% CI –0.0014 to –0.0008; p<0.0001), treatable 
270 
(R= –0.006858, 95% CI –0.007532 to –0.006184; p<0.0001) and all-cancers (R= –0.0053, 95% CI –
271 
0.0070 to –0.0036; p<0.0001) (figure 4, table S11). Female-lung cancer mortality (R= 0.0007, 95% CI 
272 
0.0004 to 0.0011; p=0.0001) on the other hand was significantly positively associated with PEH while 
273 
 11 
 
for mortality from untreatable cancers we observed no significant link (R= 0.0006, 95% CI –0.0002 to 
274 
0.0014; p=0.1492) (figures 4F and 4H, table S11). 
275 
  
276 
Lag analysis showed that these results carried through to five years after increases in PEH (figure 4). 
277 
Spending increases were associated with a slight increase in lung cancer mortality in women (figure 4F) 
278 
but not at all with deaths from untreatable cancers (figure 4H). The same trends were found irrespective 
279 
of UHC status (table 4). For the most part, these significant associations held in the robustness checks 
280 
performed (tables S12–S18).

DISCUSSION 
284 
 
285 
Our results suggest that increases in unemployment in 1990 to 2009 were associated with increased 
286 
mortality of prostate, breast, male-lung, and colorectal cancers in a range of countries. Increases in 
287 
unemployment were also associated with increased mortality due to a subset of treatable cancers as well 
288 
as all cancers. Time-lag analyses indicated that these adverse effects persisted long after initial rises in 
289 
unemployment. For the most part, these associations remained significant after controlling for 
290 
economic, resource availability, infrastructure, and out-of-pocket spending indicators. UHC 
291 
implementation, however, removed the association between changes in unemployment and cancer 
292 
mortality implying that UHC could have had a protective effect against the possible impact of 
293 
unemployment. Our findings also suggest that increased PEH (as a proportion of GDP) is associated 
294 
with improved cancer mortality. This trend continued irrespective of UHC status. 
295 
 
296 
In all analyses, we could not demonstrate an association to female-lung cancer unlike other cancers 
297 
(figures 2F and 4F). One plausible reason arising from our treatable versus untreatable cancer analysis 
298 
is that this discrepancy might have been the consequence of the survival rate for female lung cancer 
299 
being less than that for male; however, this hypothesis is not supported by evidence.26 As such, this 
300 
remains a topic for future investigation.  
301 
 
302 
The trend analysis studied a particular set of periods in order to obtain counter-factual results for 2008–
303 
2010 (the projection period), based on models of the mortality trends for 2000–2007 (the observation 
304 
period), with the hypothesis that observation-period trends would continue for the projection period. 
305 
These periods were chosen so as to correspond with the sharp upturn in unemployment observed from 
306 
2008 onwards (figure S2) during the global economic crisis, while limiting the effects of previous 
307 
unemployment fluctuations and technical progress in cancer care, which may otherwise have influenced 
308 
rates if the observation period had been extended further back than 2000. We found the strongest, most 
309 
significant deviations between observed and projected rates to occur for the non-UHC country 
310 
grouping, corroborating our multivariable regression analyses. Likewise, the difference between 
311 
expected and actual all-cancer mortality rates in middle-income countries exceeded that between high-
312 
income countries, a finding that mirrors the variable influence that the income class of a country has on 
313 
other causes of death.27 The chronological link between the unemployment rise due to the global 
314 
economic crisis and the subsequent change in cancer mortality, lends favour to a potentially causal link, 
315 
rather than reverse causality or endogeneity. 
316 
 
317 
The primary means by which increased unemployment is likely to have an adverse impact upon cancer 
318 
 13 
 
mortality is through reduced access to healthcare (figure 5), which may manifest as late-stage 
319 
diagnoses,28,29 and poor or delayed treatment.30 Furthermore, unemployment has been found to correlate 
320 
with lower socioeconomic status (SES).31,32 In turn, there is substantial evidence linking lower SES to 
321 
lower cancer survival, with reduced access to treatment being a mediating cause,33,34 as well as lower 
322 
health-seeking behaviours.35 Job loss is also strongly associated with mental health and behavioural 
323 
problems,5 and this may also have a negative impact on survival in cancer patients as a consequence of 
324 
lower rates of treatment commencement following diagnosis or higher treatment discontinuation rates.36  
325 
 
326 
Our results regarding PEH and cancer mortality are consistent with studies comparing spending levels 
327 
across countries.37 Integrated multidisciplinary care pathways for cancer involving screening, 
328 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, are costly but effective at reducing mortality. Changes in the 
329 
availability of healthcare resources – whether at the diagnosis or treatment stage – due to changes in 
330 
spending, are likely to have an impact on health outcomes. Additionally, further consequences of 
331 
changes in PEH include changes in the number of healthcare professionals, with fewer healthcare 
332 
professionals likely to result in reduced quality of care if productivity gains are not made,38 and changes 
333 
in the number of localised sites providing healthcare, with longer distances or travel times likely to 
334 
increase delays in presentation for diagnosis as well as adversely affect treatment.39 
335 
 
336 
Our study has  at least two major policy implications. First, it makes a strong case for UHC and its 
337 
possible moderating effect on unemployed populations during economic downturns. In UHC countries 
338 
where healthcare provision is meant to be equally accessible regardless of employment status, access to 
339 
healthcare is less problematic than in non-UHC countries where access is often provided by means of 
340 
an employment package. Second, amidst a background of rising healthcare costs, if spending 
341 
restrictions are not accompanied by proportionate improvements in efficiency, worse quality of care 
342 
and, in turn, higher mortality levels, may follow. 
343 
 
344 
We note several limitations of our study. First, we evaluated population health outcomes and economic 
345 
trends but did not account for variations at regional and sub-national levels. Second, for reasons of data 
346 
availability and quality, we were unable to analyse the effects of the global economic crisis after 2010. 
347 
However, in addition to the sizeable economic fluctuations that occurred during the period studied, our 
348 
analysis was still able to capture the effects of the earlier stages of the crisis with the trend analysis, 
349 
during which unemployment levels rose sharply and in some countries peaked. For the PEH dataset, we 
350 
did not account for changes in efficiency; indeed, it is possible that a country spends less on healthcare 
351 
but achieves greater outcomes due to the efficiency of its system. Linked to this, we acknowledge the 
352 
reduced global reach of our study due to the lack of data for low-income countries as well as China and 
353 
 14 
 
India. Indeed, an examination of whether our findings hold in lower income countries where it is 
354 
possible that mortality rates for certain cancer types have been rising rather than falling would offer 
355 
valuable insight. Fourth, our study was retrospective and observational, limiting our ability to draw 
356 
causal inferences. The possibility of residual confounding from social determinant and region-specific 
357 
healthcare system variables also necessitates a comprehensive, longitudinal approach characterising 
358 
trends and predictors of healthcare access and quality before and after significant economic changes to 
359 
strengthen the case for any causative effect as well as clarifying the expected latency between cancer 
360 
treatment and mortality. Finally, by employing a fixed-effects model, we assumed that any unobserved 
361 
factors within each country were time-invariant and not correlated with our variables of interest, 
362 
although the comprehensiveness of our robustness checks will have reduced the probability of this 
363 
assumption affecting our findings. 
364 
 
365 
Notwithstanding the limitations discussed, our findings suggest that both unemployment and PEH are 
366 
significantly associated with cancer mortality, with associations lasting up to five years. We estimate 
367 
that the 2008–2010 global economic crisis may have been associated with up to 250 000 excess cancer-
368 
related deaths. Our analysis also suggests that UHC may remove the association between 
369 
unemployment and cancer mortality, lending evidence in favour of healthcare system reforms aimed at 
370 
providing UHC, particularly among middle-income countries.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
496 
 
497 
Evidence before this study 
498 
We searched the literature to identify articles that quantitatively estimated either the effect of both 
499 
unemployment and healthcare spending (public or otherwise) on cancer mortality, or the effect of 
500 
universal healthcare coverage on cancer mortality. We searched PubMed for publications up to and 
501 
including May 31 2015 using the following combinations of search terms: (i) unemployment AND 
502 
cancer AND mortalit* AND (spending OR expenditure); (ii) cancer AND mortalit* AND ("universal 
503 
health coverage" OR "universal healthcare coverage"). Search combination (i) yielded seven 
504 
publications, and combination (ii) yielded one publication. With respect to search combination (i), 
505 
 
one study used a time-trend analysis to examine the relationship between unemployment and 
506 
mortality in Scotland, and included specific causes of death such as lung cancer.40 A second study 
507 
simply used Pearson’s correlation rather than a panel-based fixed effects model to find an association 
508 
between all-cancer mortality, and healthcare expenditure (negative) and unemployment (positive) in 
509 
European countries.41 The authors were therefore unable to control for potential confounding variables. 
510 
The study periods for both these publications ended before the 2008 economic recession. Three further 
511 
studies investigated a substantially narrower geographical region and outcome than the present study. 
512 
The first study examined the relationship between spending, unemployment and breast cancer mortality 
513 
in the European Union only,14 the second examined the relationship between unemployment and 
514 
stomach cancer mortality again in the European Union only,15 while the third examined prostate cancer 
515 
mortality in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.42 
516 
The remaining two studies were not considered relevant, as they did not quantify the relationship 
517 
between the macroeconomic indicators and cancer mortality. The study extracted from search 
518 
combination (ii) was also irrelevant in that again it did not seek to quantify the influence of coverage on 
519 
mortality. 
520 
  
521 
Added value of this study 
522 
The study presented here is the first global analysis of the impact of unemployment and public 
523 
healthcare spending on mortality due to all cancers, “treatable” cancers, “untreatable” cancers and 
524 
specific forms of cancer. In using a conservative, fixed-effects regression analysis model to ascertain 
525 
the existence of an association and quantify any associations combined with robustness checks, this 
526 
study accounts for criticisms levelled at other studies looking at the relationship between health 
527 
outcomes and unemployment, namely, the omission of potential confounding variables likely to be 
528 
correlated with both unemployment rates (or public healthcare spending) and cancer mortality rates. In 
529 
using a panel-data approach for the multivariable regression analysis to compare unemployment rates 
530 
 20 
 
(or public healthcare spending) at intervals of one year for each year after the increase in unemployment 
531 
(or public healthcare spending) with the mortality rates in each country, we controlled for time-invariant 
532 
heterogeneity between countries. Finally, we combined the above with a time-trend analysis, to provide 
533 
a rigorous characterisation of the associations between unemployment, public healthcare spending, 
534 
universal healthcare coverage, income, and cancer mortality. The major findings from these 
535 
complementary approaches are that unemployment increases are associated with rises in cancer 
536 
mortality, with universal healthcare coverage protecting against this phenomenon. Consideration of 
537 
certain types of cancer as either treatable or untreatable revealed that significantly higher-than-expected 
538 
numbers of deaths were only observed for treatable cancers. In contrast to unemployment, public 
539 
healthcare spending increases are associated with reductions in cancer mortality with a recapitulation of 
540 
the divergent findings between treatable and untreatable cancers. Whether or not a country has 
541 
implemented universal healthcare coverage does not significantly alter the strength of this relationship. 
542 
 
543 
Implications of all the available evidence 
544 
Policies that maintain spending and hence access to and quality of healthcare in the face of economic 
545 
downturns especially among cancers that are considered treatable may offset some of the negative 
546 
effects of such periods on health outcomes. Furthermore, the findings of our study add to the existing 
547 
body of evidence in favour of universal healthcare coverage.

with civil registration coverage of cause-of-death of <90%. Next, the over-85 age group and age groups

with fewer than 20 deaths in any calendar year were excluded. The first row of boxes at the end of the

SUMMARY 
35 
 
36 
Background 
37 
The global economic crisis has been associated with increased unemployment and reduced public-
38 
sector expenditure on healthcare (PEH). We estimated the effects of changes in unemployment and PEH 
39 
on cancer mortality, and identified how universal healthcare coverage (UHC) influenced the change. 
40 
 
41 
Methods 
42 
Data were obtained from the World Bank and WHO (1990–2010). Mortality data from female breast, 
43 
prostate and colorectal cancers, which have survival rates that exceed 50%, were aggregated into a 
44 
‘treatable’ cancer class.  Lung and pancreatic cancers, which have five-year survival rates <10%, were 
45 
likewise aggregated to give an ‘untreatable’ cancer category. Multivariable regression analysis was 
46 
used, controlling for country-specific demographics and infrastructure, with time-lag analyses and 
47 
robustness checks to explore the relationship between unemployment and PEH on cancer mortality, 
48 
with and without UHC. Trend analysis was used to project mortality rates based on trends prior to the 
49 
sharp unemployment rise experienced by many countries fromin 2008 to 2010, and compare them with 
50 
observed rates. 
51 
 
52 
Results 
53 
Data were available for 75 countries (unemployment analysis) and 79 countries (PEH analysis). 
54 
Unemployment rises were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all 
55 
specific cancers save for female-lung cancer. Untreatable cancer mortality by contrast was not 
56 
significantly linked with changes in unemployment. Lag analyses showed significant associations 
57 
remained five years after unemployment increases for the treatable cancer class. Re-running analyses 
58 
while accounting for UHC status removed the significant associations. All-cancer, treatable cancer and 
59 
specific cancer mortalities significantly decreased as PEH increased. Associations held over a five-year 
60 
period regardless of whether UHC was present. Time-series analysis found just over 40 000 estimated 
61 
excess deaths due to a subset of treatable cancers from 2008-2010 based on 2000-2007 trends. The great 
62 
majority of these deaths were from non-UHC countries. 
63 
 
64 
Interpretation 
65 
Unemployment increases are associated with cancer mortality increases. There is evidence that UHC 
66 
protects against mortality increases associated with rises in unemployment, while PEH increases are 
67 
associated with reduced cancer mortality. Reduced access to healthcare may underlie these associations.

INTRODUCTION 
76 
 
77 
The global economic crisis, which began in 2008, compelled many countries to cut public spending in 
78 
order to reduce public-sector borrowing.1 These spending cuts often entailed either reductions or a 
79 
flattening in public-sector jobs and public-sector expenditure on healthcare (PEH).2,3 Indeed, 33Thirty 
80 
three of 53 WHO European region countries underwent no change in PEH between 2008 and 2009, 
81 
while six experienced a reduction in PEH,4 which have prompted concerns about the possible negative 
82 
effects on public health. Studies have demonstrated that long-term unemployment leads to increased 
83 
suicide rates and reduced healthcare access.5,6 
84 
 
85 
Ecological studies exploring health-economic trends in the short run (separate from residual or secular 
86 
trends) have thus far focused on macroeconomic changes and outcome indicators, such as suicide rates, 
87 
cardiovascular disease incidence, all-cause mortality and specific forms of cancer, but not cancer per 
88 
se.3,7–15 These potential associations may predominantly be explained by behavioural, mental, or stress-
89 
related changes with direct and immediate effects, whether, as in the case of suicides, they are counter-
90 
cyclical associations linked to the direct psychological and financial impact of job loss,16 or pro-cyclical 
91 
associations linked to reduced injury-related work and lifestyle activities in the case of all-cause 
92 
mortality.9 Few studies, however, have analysed the relationship between economic downturns and 
93 
cancer especially in countries that are may be more susceptible to economic shocks due to less-
94 
developedimited social security and healthcare systems.  
95 
 
96 
Establishing a causal relationship between an economic change, such as aggregate unemployment, on 
97 
cancer mortality is challenging, as downstream effects of unemployment-induced behavioural changes 
98 
on lifestyle-related cancers manifest much later (20-30 years) than, for example, suicide or acute, stress-
99 
related cardiovascular events. However, access to healthcare and PEH may act as mediating factors with 
100 
more immediate effects on health outcomes. One study on the Great Depression found deaths from 
101 
cancer correlated with reduced income,17 although the lack of treatment options for patients presenting 
102 
with late-stage disease meant that the effect of the economic downturn on reduced healthcare access and 
103 
mortality could not be as strongly demonstrated as it could in an era where systemic treatment is now 
104 
available. 
105 
 
106 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012, with 
107 
estimates suggesting a rise in annual cancer cases from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million by 2030.18 
108 
Hence an understanding of the effects of macroeconomic changes on cancer outcomes worldwide is 
109 
important. 
110 
 5 
 
 
111 
We examined the association between changes in aggregate unemployment and PEH with deaths due to 
112 
specific cancers, groups of cancers, and all cancers for countries where data was available and deemed 
113 
of sufficient quality (1990–2010). Mortality was considered a more reliable measure of health outcomes 
114 
than incidence due to the susceptibility of the latter to artificial rises following the adoption of improved 
115 
means of diagnosis. We chose unemployment due to its ability to capture changes in individuals’ 
116 
circumstances, especially in lower-income strata of societies. Given the recent drive, in many countries, 
117 
to implement universal healthcare coverage (UHC),We explored whether universal healthcare coverage 
118 
(UHC) conferred a protective effect, hypothesising that UHC would enable the unemployed to access 
119 
healthcare, especially as many countries progress towards UHC systems.19 we explored whether UHC 
120 
conferred a protective effect. We also estimated the difference between the actual numbers of cancer-
121 
related deaths during and after the recent economic downturn and the expected numbers based on prior 
122 
trends. For convenience, we have used the term ‘excess deaths’ to denote those estimated differences 
123 
for which the number of deaths was higher than expected.We estimated additional cancer-related deaths 
124 
due to the recent economic downturn.

METHODS 
128 
 
129 
Data sources 
130 
Economic data were obtained from the World Bank’s Development Indicators & Global Development 
131 
Finance 2013 edition datasets.20 Unemployment (World Bank data code: SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS) was 
132 
defined as the share of the labour force without work but available and seeking employment.20 PEH 
133 
(World Bank data code: SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS) was measured as a percentage of gross domestic product 
134 
(GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP); it was defined by the World Bank as including all rent and 
135 
capital spending from government budgets (central and local), external borrowings and grants 
136 
(including donations from international agencies and non-governmental organisations), and social (or 
137 
compulsory) health insurance funds. Unemployment and cancer mortality (see below) data for 1990 to 
138 
2010 were available for 75 countries and data on PEH for 1990 to 2009 were available for four 
139 
additional countries (table 1), representing, as of 2009, 2.106 billion and 2.156 billion people in each 
140 
dataset, respectively.20 Classification of countries into high- and middle-income was done according to 
141 
the World Bank’s Atlas Method.21 In brief, middle-income countries are those with a gross national 
142 
income per capita of more than $1 045 but less than $12 736, whereas high-income economies are those 
143 
with a gross national income per capita of $12 736 or more. Countries were classified into those with 
144 
very high or high human development indices (HDI) according to the UN’s Human Development 
145 
Programme.22 
146 
 
147 
Cancer mortality data (deaths per 100 000) for 1990 to 2010 for the countries in the unemployment and 
148 
PEH datasets were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO) mortality database.23 These 
149 
data are based on death certification and updated annually from civil registration systems of WHO 
150 
member states. Mortality data for prostate (ICD-10 C61), female-breast (ICD-10 C50), lung (male and 
151 
female; ICD-10 C33–C34), colorectal (male and female; ICD-10 C18–C21) cancers and all cancers 
152 
were extracted. Female breast, prostate and colorectal cancers have survival rates that exceed 50%.24 
153 
We therefore aggregated the mortality data for these tumour types into a ‘treatable’ cancer class.  Lung 
154 
and pancreatic cancers (male and female; ICD-10 C25), which have five-year survival rates <10%, were 
155 
likewise aggregated to give an ‘untreatable’ cancer category.24 Notably, at the time data were collected, 
156 
complete cancer mortality data were unavailable for China, India, and countries from sub-Saharan 
157 
Africa. Age-standardised death rates (ASDRs), accounting for age distribution differences in 
158 
populations, were extracted for all ages and ages 0–84 for both sexes and each sex separately. For age-
159 
specific cancer mortality rates, we aggregated crude rates (per 100 000 people) for each sex and country 
160 
by 10-year age groups except for the youngest age group (0–34), which was combined to reduce the 
161 
influence of age groups with fewer observations. These crude rates were defined as the number of 
162 
 7 
 
deaths during a calendar year for a particular age group divided by the age group’s mid-year population. 
163 
 
164 
Multivariable regression analysis 
165 
We used multivariable regression analysis to assess the relationship between mortality rates for each 
166 
cancer subtype, treatable cancers, untreatable cancers and all cancers (response variable), and 
167 
unemployment or PEH (predictor variable). Due to incomplete cancer mortality data for many of the 75 
168 
countries in the unemployment dataset, observations for the year 2010 were excluded from the analysis. 
169 
To ensure that results were not driven by uncontrollable inter-country variations, we used fixed effects 
170 
in the regression models, including one dummy variable for each country in each dataset excluding a 
171 
reference group (i.e. 74 dummy variables for the unemployment dataset and 78 for the PEH dataset; 
172 
table 2). This meant that the regression models evaluated mortality changes within individual countries 
173 
while holding constant time-invariant differences between countries, including higher predispositions to 
174 
cancer as well as political, healthcare, cultural, and structural differences. Multivariable regression with 
175 
fixed effects was used since this methodology has been widely employed in similar studies, and is 
176 
regarded as statistically robust and conservative.25 The population structure of each country was also 
177 
controlled for by incorporating total population size and demographic structure (the percentage of the 
178 
population over 65 years and less than 15 years old) into the model (table 2). Further details of the 
179 
model are provided in appendix S2. 
180 
 
181 
We conducted 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year time-lag analyses. For both datasets, we then classified countries 
182 
into those with UHC and those without, and re-ran the analyses using UHC status as a robustness 
183 
check. Countries were considered to have UHC if all of the following previously described criteria were 
184 
met: legislation mandating UHC; >90% of the population with access to some form of healthcare 
185 
insurance; and >90% of the population with access to skilled birth attendance. The latter criterion was 
186 
used to ensure the implementation of UHC met minimum performance standards expected of a 
187 
functioning healthcare system. To test the sensitivity of our results to this definition, we re-ran the 
188 
analysis using an alternative performance criterion, details of which are included in appendix S1 in the 
189 
Supplementary Material (table S1). Robustness checks are detailed in table 2 and appendix S2. 
190 
 
191 
Trend analysis 
192 
For the all-cancer mortality trend projection analysis, we set strict country inclusion criteria to ensure 
193 
that only high quality data were used. We therefore excluded countries with civil registration coverage 
194 
of cause-of-death less than 90% for the study period,23 eliminating in the process 26 countries from the 
195 
61 for which all-cancer mortality data were complete for 2000 to 2010 (figure 1). In order to limit the 
196 
effect of miscoding and comorbidity (frequent for older population groups), we excluded the 85+ age 
197 
 8 
 
group, and to further ensure robustness in cross-country comparisons, we excluded age groups with 
198 
fewer than 20 deaths in any calendar year. Details of the models used are provided in appendix S3.

RESULTS 
208 
 
209 
Unemployment 
210 
A 1% unemployment rise was associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality for all but 
211 
one of the six cancer sub-types studied: prostate (regression coefficient (R)=0.0981, 95% CI 0.0353–
212 
0.1609; p=0.0022), female-breast (R=0.1583, 95% CI 0.1110–0.2056; p<0.0001), male-lung 
213 
(R=0.2260, 95% CI 0.1216–0.3304; p<0.0001), male-colorectal (R=0.0596, 95% CI 0.0188–0.1003; 
214 
p=0.0042), and female-colorectal (R=0.0676, 95% CI 0.0362–0.099; p<0.0001) (figures 2A-E, figure 
215 
S1A, table S2). The association for female-lung cancer mortality with unemployment was negative (R= 
216 
–0.0593, 95% CI –0.1013 to 0.0172; p=0.0058; figure 2F, table S2). Whereas treatable cancer mortality 
217 
was significantly linked with unemployment (R=0.1256, 95% CI 0.0148–0.2364; p=0.0265) (figure 2G, 
218 
table S2), no such significance was observed for untreatable cancers (R=0.082, 95% CI -0.041–0.205; 
219 
p=0.1919) (figure 2H, table S2). The strongest associations were found in the all-cancer data 
220 
(R=0.3745, 95% CI 0.1939–0.5551; p=0.0001; figure 2I, table S2). Lag analysis showed that these 
221 
results remained through to five years after unemployment increases (figure 2I). These associations held 
222 
and remained significant in the robustness checks performed (tables S3–S9). 
223 
 
224 
On accounting for the UHC status of countries, we found no significant association between 
225 
unemployment and cancer mortality within the first year of unemployment rising (table 3, figures S1B-
226 
C). The results were unaffected by country classifications according to an alternative definition for 
227 
UHC (appendix S1). 
228 
 
229 
Trend analysis 
230 
For the trend analysis, population-weighted mean values of the projected age-specific rates and ASDRs 
231 
for each year and sex were obtained. Globally (for the 35 countries selected), we observed significant 
232 
deviations in the projected ASDR from the observed ASDR for both male all cancer mortality (figure 
233 
3A, table S10) and female all cancer mortality (figure 3B, table S10) with the 2010 predicted ASDR – 3 
234 
years after the unemployment rise in 2007 – deviating the most from the observed ASDR (males: rate 
235 
ratio 1.0362, 95% CI 1.0209–1.052; p<0.0001; females: rate ratio 1.0428, 95% CI 1.0254–1.0607; 
236 
p<0.0001). This corresponded to 55 434 (95% CI 32 439-78 428) excess deaths among men and 53 573 
237 
(95% CI 32 386-74 759) excess deaths among women in 2010 alone . Summing the point estimates for 
238 
males and females from 2008 to 2010 yielded 252 ,199 excess deaths (figure 3A)(figure 3A). This 
239 
finding was recapitulated upon confinement of our analysis to treatable cancers (rate ratio 1.0362, 95% 
240 
CI 1.0225–1.0502; p<0.0001; figure 3C, table S10) resulting in 22 977 (95% CI 14 482-31 472) excess 
241 
deaths in 2010. By contrast, for untreatable cancers, the deviation between predicted and observed 
242 
 10 
 
ASDR was not significant in 2008, 2009 or 2010 (figure 3D, table S10).  
243 
 
244 
We next asked whether these trends held among different groups of countries. To answer this, we 
245 
extracted ASDRs for the following: 26 countries with UHC implemented and 9 countries without UHC 
246 
as of 2008; 31 high-income countries and 4 middle-income countries as classified by the World Bank 
247 
using the Atlas Method;21 and 22 very high HDI and 13 high HDI countries.22  
248 
 
249 
For the UHC country group, no significant difference was found for treatable cancer ASDR (figure 3E, 
250 
table S10). By contrast, for the non-UHC country group the predicted ASDRs for treatable cancers were 
251 
significantly lower than the observed ASDRs for all 3 projected years (in 2010: rate ratio 1.0746, 95% 
252 
CI 1.0417–1.11; p<0.0001), which equated to 21 241 (95% CI 12 244-30 238) excess deaths due to 
253 
treatable cancers in 2010 (figure 3F, table S10). Differences between the actual and projected ASDR of 
254 
untreatable cancer were non-significant for both UHC and non-UHC country groups in 2008 with a 
255 
significantly lower-than-expected number of deaths in 2009 and 2010 for the UHC country group, and a 
256 
marginally significant higher-than-expected number of deaths in 2010 for the non-UHC country group 
257 
(table S10).  
258 
 
259 
Stratifying countries by income using the World Bank’s classification yielded higher rate ratios 
260 
(indicating higher-than-expected numbers of deaths) for male, female and treatable cancers among 
261 
middle-income countries than among high-income countries (table S10). For untreatable cancers, high-
262 
income countries experienced significantly lower-than expected numbers of deaths whereas middle-
263 
income countries experienced significantly higher-than-expected numbers of deaths (table S10). On 
264 
dividing countries according to HDI, neither the very high nor high HDI groupings experienced higher-
265 
than-expected numbers of untreatable cancer deaths although significantly lower-than expected 
266 
numbers across all years were only observed for the very high HDI group (table S10).  
267 
 
268 
Public-sector expenditure on healthcare 
269 
Increases in PEH, as a proportion of GDP, were significantly associated with mortality reductions in 
270 
seven of the nine cancer categories studied: prostate (R= –0.0013, 95% CI –0.0019 to –0.0008; 
271 
p<0.0001), female-breast (R= –0.0023, 95% CI –0.0029 to –0.0017; p<0.0001), male-lung (R= –
272 
0.0037, 95% CI –0.0045 to –0.0028; p<0.0001), male-colorectal (R= –0.0011, 95% CI –0.0016 to –
273 
0.0007; p<0.0001), female-colorectal (R= –0.0011, 95% CI –0.0014 to –0.0008; p<0.0001), treatable 
274 
(R= –0.006858, 95% CI –0.007532 to –0.006184; p<0.0001) and all-cancers (R= –0.0053, 95% CI –
275 
0.0070 to –0.0036; p<0.0001) (figure 4, table S11). Female-lung cancer mortality (R= 0.0007, 95% CI 
276 
0.0004 to 0.0011; p=0.0001) on the other hand was significantly positively associated with PEH while 
277 
 11 
 
for mortality from untreatable cancers we observed no significant link (R= 0.0006, 95% CI –0.0002 to 
278 
0.0014; p=0.1492) (figures 4F and 4H, table S11). 
279 
  
280 
Lag analysis showed that these results carried through to five years after increases in PEH (figure 4). 
281 
Spending increases were associated with a slight increase in lung cancer mortality in women (figure 4F) 
282 
but not at all with deaths from untreatable cancers (figure 4H). The same trends were found irrespective 
283 
of UHC status (table 4). For the most part, these significant associations held in the robustness checks 
284 
performed (tables S12–S18). 
285 
 
286 
287

DISCUSSION 
288 
 
289 
Our results suggest that increases in unemployment in 1990 to 2009 were associated with increased 
290 
mortality of prostate, breast, male-lung, and colorectal cancers in a range of countries. Increases in 
291 
unemployment were also associated with increased mortality due to a subset of treatable cancers as well 
292 
as all cancers. Time-lag analyses indicated that these adverse effects persisted long after initial rises in 
293 
unemployment. For the most part, these associations remained significant after controlling for 
294 
economic, resource availability, infrastructure, and out-of-pocket spending indicators. UHC 
295 
implementation, however, removed the association between changes in unemployment and cancer 
296 
mortality implying that UHC could have had a protective effect against the possible impact of 
297 
unemployment. Our findings also suggest that increased PEH (as a proportion of GDP) is associated 
298 
with improved cancer mortality. This trend continued irrespective of UHC status. 
299 
 
300 
In all analyses, we could not demonstrate an association to female-lung cancer unlike other cancers 
301 
(figures 2F and 4F). One plausible reason arising from our treatable versus untreatable cancer analysis 
302 
is that this discrepancy might have been the consequence of the survival rate for female lung cancer 
303 
being less than that for male; however, this hypothesis is not supported by evidence.26 As such, this 
304 
remains a topic for future investigation.  
305 
 
306 
The trend analysis studied a particular set of periods in order to obtain counter-factual results for 2008–
307 
2010 (the projection period), based on models of the mortality trends for 2000–2007 (the observation 
308 
period), with the hypothesis that observation-period trends would continue for the projection period. 
309 
These periods were chosen so as to correspond with the sharp upturn in unemployment observed from 
310 
2008 onwards (figure S2) during the global economic crisis, while limiting the effects of previous 
311 
unemployment fluctuations and technical progress in cancer care, which may otherwise have influenced 
312 
rates if the observation period had been extended further back than 2000. We found the strongest, most 
313 
significant deviations between observed and projected rates to occur for the non-UHC country 
314 
grouping, corroborating our multivariable regression analyses. Likewise, the difference between 
315 
expected and actual all-cancer mortality rates in middle-income countries exceeded that between high-
316 
income countries, a finding that mirrors the variable influence that the income class of a country has on 
317 
other causes of death.27 The chronological link between the unemployment rise due to the global 
318 
economic crisis and the subsequent change in cancer mortality, lends favour to a potentially causal link, 
319 
rather than reverse causality or endogeneity. 
320 
 
321 
The primary means by which increased unemployment is likely to have an adverse impact upon cancer 
322 
 13 
 
mortality is through reduced access to healthcare (figure 5), which may manifest as late-stage 
323 
diagnoses,28,29 and poor or delayed treatment.30 Furthermore, unemployment has been found to correlate 
324 
with lower socioeconomic status (SES).31,32 In turn, there is substantial evidence linking lower SES to 
325 
lower cancer survival, with reduced access to treatment being a mediating cause,33,34 as well as lower 
326 
health-seeking behaviours.35 Job loss is also strongly associated with mental health and behavioural 
327 
problems,5 and this may also have a negative impact on survival in cancer patients as a consequence of 
328 
lower rates of treatment commencement following diagnosis or higher treatment discontinuation rates.36  
329 
 
330 
Our results regarding PEH and cancer mortality are consistent with studies comparing spending levels 
331 
across countries.37 Integrated multidisciplinary care pathways for cancer involving screening, 
332 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, are costly but effective at reducing mortality. Changes in the 
333 
availability of healthcare resources – whether at the diagnosis or treatment stage – due to changes in 
334 
spending, are likely to have an impact on health outcomes. Additionally, further consequences of 
335 
changes in PEH include changes in the number of healthcare professionals, with fewer healthcare 
336 
professionals likely to result in reduced quality of care if productivity gains are not made,38 and changes 
337 
in the number of localised sites providing healthcare, with longer distances or travel times likely to 
338 
increase delays in presentation for diagnosis as well as adversely affect treatment.39 
339 
 
340 
Our study has three at least two major policy implications. First, it makes a strong case for UHC and its 
341 
possible moderating effect on unemployed populations during economic downturns. In UHC countries 
342 
where healthcare provision is meant to be equally accessible regardless of employment status, access to 
343 
healthcare is less problematic than in non-UHC countries where access is often provided by means of 
344 
an employment package. Second, fiscal consolidation measures introduced during the economic crisis 
345 
are likely exacerbating the adverse health effects of the global economic downturn rather than 
346 
ameliorating them. Some have advocated that to reduce adverse effects, government policy should seek 
347 
to actively maintain aggregate employment levels;25 the implication being that, from a public-health 
348 
perspective, expansionary fiscal policy is the optimal response to the slumps in aggregate demand and 
349 
concomitant private-sector unemployment seen during economic downturns. Similarly, it is reasonable 
350 
to propose that if governments fail not just to maintain PEH but also to maintain levels of total 
351 
healthcare expenditure by not compensating for reduced private-sector and private-household spending 
352 
in economic crises, then there may be considerable adverse consequences for public health. Third, 
353 
amidst a background of rising healthcare costs, if spending restrictions are not accompanied by 
354 
proportionate improvements in efficiency, worse quality of care and, in turn, higher mortality levels, 
355 
may follow.

We note several limitations of our study. First, we evaluated population health outcomes and economic 
358 
trends but did not account for variations at regional and sub-national levels. Second, for reasons of data 
359 
availability and quality, we were unable to analyse the effects of the global economic crisis after 2010. 
360 
However, in addition to the sizeable economic fluctuations that occurred during the period studied, our 
361 
analysis was still able to capture the effects of the earlier stages of the crisis with the trend analysis, 
362 
during which unemployment levels rose sharply and in some countries peaked. For the PEH dataset, we 
363 
did not account for changes in efficiency; indeed, it is possible that a country spends less on healthcare 
364 
but achieves greater outcomes due to the efficiency of its system. Linked to this, we acknowledge the 
365 
reduced global reach of our study due to the lack of data for low-income countries as well as China and 
366 
India. Indeed, an examination of whether our findings hold in lower income countries where it is 
367 
possible that mortality rates for certain cancer types have been rising rather than falling would offer 
368 
valuable insight. Fourth, our study was retrospective and observational, limiting our ability to draw 
369 
causal inferences. The possibility of residual confounding from social determinant and region-specific 
370 
healthcare system variables also necessitates a comprehensive, longitudinal approach characterising 
371 
trends and predictors of healthcare access and quality before and after significant economic changes to 
372 
strengthen the case for any causative effect as well as clarifying the expected latency between cancer 
373 
treatment and mortality. Finally, by employing a fixed-effects model, we assumed that any unobserved 
374 
factors within each country were time-invariant and not correlated with our variables of interest, 
375 
although the comprehensiveness of our robustness checks will have reduced the probability of this 
376 
assumption affecting our findings. 
377 
 
378 
Notwithstanding the limitations discussed, our findings suggest that both unemployment and PEH are 
379 
significantly associated with cancer mortality, with associations lasting up to five years. We estimate 
380 
that the 2008–2010 global economic crisis may have been associated with up to 100 250 000 additional 
381 
excess cancer-related deaths. Our analysis also suggests that UHC may removes the association 
382 
between unemployment and cancer mortality, lending evidence in favour of healthcare system reforms 
383 
aimed at providing UHC, particularly among middle-income countries.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
509 
 
510 
Evidence before this study 
511 
We searched the literature to identify articles that quantitatively estimated either the effect of both 
512 
unemployment and healthcare spending (public or otherwise) on cancer mortality, or the effect of 
513 
universal healthcare coverage on cancer mortality. We searched PubMed for publications up to and 
514 
including May 31 2015 using the following combinations of search terms: (i) unemployment AND 
515 
cancer AND mortalit* AND (spending OR expenditure); (ii) cancer AND mortalit* AND "universal 
516 
healthcare coverage". Search combination (i) yielded seven publications, and combination (ii) yielded 
517 
one publication. With respect to search combination (i),  
one study used a time-trend analysis to 
518 
examine the relationship between unemployment and mortality in Scotland, and included specific 
519 
causes of death such as lung cancer.40 A second study simply used Pearson’s correlation rather than a 
520 
panel-based fixed effects model to find an association between all-cancer mortality, and healthcare 
521 
expenditure (negative) and unemployment (positive) in European countries.41 The authors were 
522 
therefore unable to control for potential confounding variables. The study periods for both these 
523 
publications ended before the 2008 economic recession. Three further studies investigated a 
524 
substantially narrower geographical region and outcome than the present study. The first study 
525 
examined the relationship between spending, unemployment and breast cancer mortality in the 
526 
European Union only,14 the second examined the relationship between unemployment and stomach 
527 
cancer mortality again in the European Union only,15 while the third examined prostate cancer mortality 
528 
in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.42 The 
529 
remaining two studies were not considered relevant, as they did not quantify the relationship between 
530 
the macroeconomic indicators and cancer mortality. The study extracted from search combination (ii) 
531 
was also irrelevant in that again it did not seek to quantify the influence of coverage on mortality. 
532 
  
533 
Added value of this study 
534 
The study presented here is the first global analysis of the impact of unemployment and public 
535 
healthcare spending on mortality due to all cancers, “treatable” cancers, “untreatable” cancers and 
536 
specific forms of cancer. In using a conservative, fixed-effects regression analysis model to ascertain 
537 
the existence of an association and quantify any associations combined with robustness checks, this 
538 
study accounts for criticisms levelled at other studies looking at the relationship between health 
539 
outcomes and unemployment, namely, the omission of potential confounding variables likely to be 
540 
correlated with both unemployment rates (or public healthcare spending) and cancer mortality rates. In 
541 
using a panel-data approach for the multivariable regression analysis to compare unemployment rates 
542 
(or public healthcare spending) at intervals of one year for each year after the increase in unemployment 
543 
 20 
 
(or public healthcare spending) with the mortality rates in each country, we controlled for time-invariant 
544 
heterogeneity between countries. Finally, we combined the above with a time-trend analysis, to provide 
545 
a rigorous characterisation of the associations between unemployment, public healthcare spending, 
546 
universal healthcare coverage, income, and cancer mortality. The major findings from these 
547 
complementary approaches are that unemployment increases are associated with rises in cancer 
548 
mortality, with universal healthcare coverage protecting against this phenomenon. Consideration of 
549 
certain types of cancer as either treatable or untreatable revealed that significantly higher-than-expected 
550 
numbers of deaths were only observed for treatable cancers. In contrast to unemployment, public 
551 
healthcare spending increases are associated with reductions in cancer mortality with a recapitulation of 
552 
the divergent findings between treatable and untreatable cancers. Whether or not a country has 
553 
implemented universal healthcare coverage does not significantly alter the strength of this relationship. 
554 
 
555 
Implications of all the available evidence 
556 
Policies that maintain spending and hence access to and quality of healthcare in the face of economic 
557 
downturns especially among cancers that are considered treatable may offset some of the negative 
558 
effects of such periods on health outcomes. Furthermore, the findings of our study add to the existing 
559 
body of evidence in favour of universal healthcare coverage.

Dear Mrs Hart, 
 
RE: THELANCET-D-15-05399R1, Economic downturns, universal healthcare 
coverage, and cancer mortality in high- and middle-income countries, 1990-2010. 
 
We would like to thank the editorial board and the referees for their contributions to 
and constructive comments on our manuscript. We have carefully considered the 
reviewers’ comments and revised our manuscript accordingly. In particular, we would 
like to highlight the change in title to the manuscript from “Economic downturns, 
universal health coverage, and cancer mortality: a global analysis, 1990-2010” to 
“Economic downturns, universal healthcare coverage, and cancer mortality in high- 
and middle-income countries, 1990–2010” as suggested by one of the reviewers. 
 
We have provided systematic responses to the reviewers’ comments. Please note that 
amendments to the manuscript that are in response to the reviewers' comments are 
highlighted as tracked changes. 
 
We hope we have clarified the points raised by the referees to your satisfaction and 
that you now consider the revised manuscript acceptable for publication. 
 
Yours sincerely 
 
Mahiben Maruthappu & Johnathan Watkins

 REVIEWER 4 
 
Most reviewers' suggestions have been addressed. 
 
Given the correlational nature of the study, I would use an additionally cautious 
wording in the interpretation, but this is left to the authors' choice. 
 
Our response > We have now amended the wording in the Interpretation in the 
Abstract to highlight the correlative nature of the study: 
 
“There is evidence that UHC protects against mortality increases associated 
with rises in unemployment…” 
 
In the Discussion section we also added an additional cautionary language: 
 
“…implying that UHC could have had a protective effect against the 
possible impact of unemployment.” 
 
 
REVIEWER 5 
 
General Comments 
Overall this is a very well written manuscript! 
The authors use data from SELECT high income and middle income countries to 
study the impact of macroeconomics variable (unemployment, public sector 
expenditure on health care, universal healthcare coverage and income, on cancer 
mortality. 
 
Major comments 
Comment #1: Title: The title of the paper is a little mis-leading. It says "global 
analysis." With the exclusion of countries such as China, India and countries from 
Sub-Sahara Africa; the title should say something like "Economic downturns, 
universal health coverage, and cancer mortality in select high and middle income 
countries, 1990-2010" 
  
Our response > We agree with the reviewer’s point and have amended the title of 
the paper to “Economic downturns, universal healthcare coverage, and cancer 
mortality in high- and middle-income countries, 1990–2010”. 
 
Comment #2: There may be a different picture, if the analysis is stratified into high 
income, middle income and low-income countries. 
 
Our response > We acknowledge the absence of quality data for low-income 
countries. As such, we have confined our analyses examining the role of income 
to high- and middle-income economies. We conducted fixed-effect regressions 
using the income status of a country as a balancing variable. We refer the 
reviewer to Table S8 for the results of these. We also conducted time-series 
analyses for high- and middle-income groups of countries, the results for which 
we refer the reviewer to Table S10. 
 
Minor comments 
Comment #3: Abstract (Method). Did all the countries included in the study 
experience sharp unemployment rise in between 2008 and 2010? 
 
Our response > We have now amended the text to point out that the sharp 
unemployment rise was experienced in many but not all countries. 
 
“Trend analysis was used to project mortality rates based on trends prior to 
the sharp unemployment rise experienced by many countries from 2008 to 
2010…” 
 
Comment #4: Methods: Need to indicate what criteria was used to classify countries 
into high and middle income.  It is important to include the reason why India, China 
and countries from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are not included in the analysis. 
Without India, China and countries from Low income countries (such as those in 
SSA), this can hardly be called a "global analysis." 
 
Our response > We have now highlighted the reason that data from China, India 
 and SSA countries were not included in the Methods section as follows: 
 
“Notably, at the time data were collected, complete cancer mortality data 
were unavailable for China, India, and countries from sub-Saharan 
Africa.” 
 
Comment #5: Results (Trend analysis). Brief mention is made of stratifying countries 
by income. This deserves more attention. 
 
Our response > We have now added notes to the Methods and the Results that 
income stratification was done based on the World Bank’s Atlas method. 
 
In the Methods: 
 
“Classification of countries into high- and middle-income was done 
according to the World Bank’s Atlas Method.25 In brief, middle-income 
countries are those with a gross national income per capita of more than $1 
045 but less than $12 736, whereas high-income economies are those with a 
gross national income per capita of $12 736 or more.” 
 
In the Results: 
 
“31 high-income countries and 4 middle-income countries as classified by 
the World Bank using the Atlas Method;25” 
 
and 
 
“Stratifying countries by income using the World Bank’s classification…” 
 
Comment #6: Discussion (Limitation). Suggest mentioning that less than half of the 
countries in the world are included in this study. Highlight reasons why. 
 
Our response > We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point for 
the reader to appreciate. We have previously addressed a similar comment on 
 the Discussion as follows: 
 
“Linked to this, we acknowledge the reduced global reach of our study due 
to the lack of data for low-income countries as well as China and India. 
Indeed, an examination of whether our findings hold in lower income 
countries where it is possible that mortality rates for certain cancer types 
have been rising rather than falling would offer valuable insight.” 
 
Comment #7: Discussion. Figure S is mentioned, but I cannot find it. 
 
Our response > We believe the reviewer is referring to Figure S2 as mentioned in 
the following sentence: 
 
“These periods were chosen so as to correspond with the sharp upturn in 
unemployment observed from 2008 onwards (figure S2).” 
 
We have checked and can confirm that figure S2 was included in the revised 
submission, and will be included among the supplementary figures in this second 
revision.
