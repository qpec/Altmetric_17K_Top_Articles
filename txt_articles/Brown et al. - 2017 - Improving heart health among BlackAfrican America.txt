Abstract
Background: Despite increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related conditions, evaluations of health
interventions indicate that Black/African American women are less likely to benefit than their white counterparts
and are not as likely to engage in behaviors that reduce CVD risk. The purpose of this study was to test the
feasibility and effectiveness of civic engagement as an intervention strategy to address heart health in Black/African
American women.
Methods: Using a quasi-experimental pre-post study design, civic engagement was tested by convening a
convenience sample of self-identified Black/African American women, ages 30–70 years, English-speaking, and
BMI ≥25.0 (n = 28) into “Change Clubs” in four churches. Feasibility was examined through adherence,
satisfaction, retention, and ability of Change Clubs to meet at least 50% of self-identified action steps for
community change. Effectiveness data included: dietary intake, measures of physical activity, cardiorespiratory
fitness, blood pressure, and anthropometrics. Psychosocial factors hypothesized to serve as the mechanisms by
which civic engagement enacts behavior change were also assessed.
Results: At baseline, the study sample (n = 28) had a mean age of 50.5 y; 53.6% had an associate degree or
higher; 60.7% had an income of $35,000 or higher; and 57.4% were employed full time. At the conclusion of
the study, all participants were satisfied with the progress of their Change Club and with the overall
experience and Change Clubs met their self-identified action steps for community change. The intervention
had a significant effect on finish time on the cardiorespiratory fitness test (p < 0.001) and systolic blood
pressure (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Study results suggest feasibility and evidence of preliminary effectiveness of using a civic
engagement approach to address behavior change in a way that is appealing and acceptable to Black/African
American women.

 Background
The prevalence of diet- and behavior-related diseases
and conditions, such as overweight and obesity, hyper-
tension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), are higher
among Black/African Americans in comparison to other
racial groups [1]. For example, 82% of Black/African
American women age 20 years or older are overweight
or obese, compared to 61% of white women, and few
Black/African American women meet dietary or physical
activity guidelines [1]. According to the American Heart
Association, the prevalence of hypertension and CVD
among Black/African American females (≥20 years) is
46% and 48%, respectively [1].
Despite increased risk for CVD and related conditions,
Black/African American women are not as likely to en-
gage in behaviors that reduce CVD risk [1], and evalua-
tions of health interventions indicate that Black/African
American women are less likely to benefit than their
white counterparts [2–5]. These differences in effective-
ness could be due to a variety of factors including, cul-
tural appropriateness of interventions, time constraints
and adherence to interventions, and resources [2–5].
The relatively few interventions developed specifically
for Blacks/African Americans indicate that it is possible
to achieve significant improvements in risk behaviors
and biological parameters when culture, values, beliefs,
and unique barriers are taken into account [6–14]. Des-
pite this evidence and the large disparities in CVD risk,
few gender- and culture-specific CVD prevention inter-
ventions exist [8, 11–15].
The African American Collaborative Obesity Research
Network
(AACORN)—a
collaboration
of
U.S.
re-
searchers, scholars, and community-based research part-
ners dedicated to addressing weight-related concerns in
Black/African American communities—emphasizes the
importance of engaging community members in the
planning and implementation of interventions [16]. Spe-
cifically, the AACORN research paradigm recommends
an eco-social, community-engaged approach to behavior
change as most appropriate and effective in Black/African
American communities [16]. AACORN further asserts
that recognizing the historical and social contexts, cultural
and psychosocial processes, and the physical and eco-
nomic environments that influence health behaviors
among the Black/African American population is essential
to effective health promotion in this population. Interven-
tions should therefore not only embody the culture of
Black/African American communities (i.e., values of inter-
connectedness, religiosity, and importance of family), but
also be framed in the context of environmental and
policy-level factors [17]. An additional critical consider-
ation noted by AACORN is the heterogeneity (i.e., ethni-
city, socioeconomic status, and education) among the
Black/African
American
population
and
how
an
understanding of and responsiveness to this multidimen-
sionality of the study population must underlie the devel-
opment of programs and interventions if they are to be
effective [4].
The objective of this pilot study is to test the operatio-
nalization of the AACORN paradigm through a civic
engagement approach. Civic engagement, defined as “in-
dividual and collective actions designed to identify and
address issues of public concern” [18], is an innovative
approach to behavior change. In 2011, several members
of the research team conducted a preliminary project
examining this strategy for health promotion among
predominantly white women [19]. Participants gathered
in “Change Clubs” (also referred to as the civic engage-
ment approach), and engaged in a community audit
designed to increase awareness about their food and
physical activity environments. They then self-identified
a specific community change objective, such as improv-
ing snacks in after school programs or advocating for
traffic calming measures to improve community walk-
ability. Through the Change Club curriculum, groups
were led through a process of setting action steps and
monitoring progress. Seven of eight clubs were success-
ful in meeting at least half of their benchmarks [19].
Although not evaluated in that project, this process may
also lead to change in individual health behavior.
Informed by the AACORN paradigm, our study frame-
work (Fig. 1) depicts the mechanisms by which civic en-
gagement may affect behavior change at each level of
the
eco-social
model
(i.e.,
individual,
interpersonal,
organizational, community, public policy) [20]. At the
individual level, civic engagement fosters self-regulation
(goal-setting and monitoring) and self-efficacy, which
are associated with healthier dietary behaviors, regular
physical activity, and weight status [21–27]. The study
framework also suggests civic engagement will decrease
perceived stress through empowerment, or acting in a
self-determined manner to effect change in the public
sphere [28]. At the group/collective level, by identifying
and changing environmental factors affecting commu-
nity health, the group gains a sense of collective efficacy
to create collective change [29]. The group itself pro-
vides social support, known in the literature to positively
affect health behaviors [30, 31]. It is also anticipated that
there is a positive interaction between individual-level
changes and collective efficacy of the group by which
changes at each level reinforce the other [29]. At the
community/environment level, civic engagement is de-
signed to promote environmental and policy changes
that further support personal and collective efficacy and
behavior change through reciprocal determinism [29].
Per the AACORN paradigm, the civic engagement
process reveals community strengths that can be lever-
aged for health promotion [16].

 It is hypothesized that the Change Club civic engage-
ment approach would be culturally appropriate for
Black/African American women, since it places the focus
on collective health and builds on cultural strengths
such as interconnectedness, importance of community,
and care for others. The purpose of this study was to de-
termine feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of civic
engagement as a way to affect changes in CVD-related
behaviors and outcomes in this population. The study also
aims to determine trends and obtain data to allow calcula-
tion of an adequately powered sample in a larger study.
Methods
Design, sample, and setting
A quasi-experimental pre-post study design was used
and the Tufts University Health Sciences Institutional
Review Board approved all study procedures.
Participants were recruited in collaboration with four
churches located in predominantly Black/African Ameri-
can neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts, United
States. Churches were selected based on geographic lo-
cation and existing connections with these faith-based
institutions. Informational sessions in the format of pre-
sentations about the study were conducted at each of
the churches and promotional flyers were posted onsite.
The research coordinator screened potential participants
who expressed initial interest in the research study by
telephone. Inclusion criteria were self-identifying as
Black/African
American;
female;
age
30–70
years;
English-speaking; BMI ≥25; currently sedentary (not
meeting Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans; and
safe to initiate moderate physical activity based on the
PARQ) [32]. Exclusion criteria included failure to provide
informed consent; for those who had any contraindications
to physical activity per the PAR-Q, failure to obtain
physician consent to participate; participation in any
other lifestyle modification program; current use of
either prescription or over-the-counter weight loss
medications; inability to communicate due to severe,
uncorrectable hearing loss or speech disorder; severe
visual impairment (if it precludes completion of as-
sessments
and/or
intervention);
planning
to
move
outside of area within 6 months; and self-reported
pregnancy,
since
weight
loss
is
inadvisable
[32].
Women who were eligible based on their responses
to the telephone screening, were invited to participate
in the study. Prior to the baseline assessments, each
participant reviewed and signed the informed consent
agreeing to participate in the study. Figure 2 depicts
the study flow and sample sizes.
Intervention
The 6-month intervention was developed from elements
of the Change Club and the StrongWomen – Healthy
Hearts curriculum, a community-based CVD prevention
program for midlife and older women [19, 33] (See
Table 1 for the Intervention Overview). The intervention
herein will be referred to as the Change Club civic en-
gagement curriculum. The Change Club and Strong-
Women – Healthy Hearts curriculum were adapted for
cultural appropriateness through the consideration of
food recommendations, language choice, and layout and
design of curriculum materials. Change Club members
met weekly for 6 months and participated in a step-by
step process using the civic engagement approach.
The first three months of the intervention (planning
phase) were facilitated by research staff at which time
the Change Clubs were guided through the process of

 planning,
visioning,
stakeholder
identification,
asset
mapping, and goal setting (using action steps, or specific,
measurable action items toward goal attainment). For
example, Month 1 focused on building the rapport of
the group, identity formation, and establishing group
norms. Month 2 included identification and assessment
of community needs through interviews with key com-
munity leaders and community walkabouts and selecting
a central goal related to a nutrition or physical activity
issue of concern in their community. In Month 3, the
group created a plan of action to execute the self-
identified group project, including task delegation and
action items for each group member. During these three
months, research team members either facilitated or co-
facilitated the Change Clubs. The facilitators each had
professional experience with group facilitation and the
Change Club civic engagement curriculum. Additionally,
at each session during this phase, participants received
basic nutrition education from the StrongWomen –
Healthy Hearts curriculum, designed to interweave with
the civic engagement approach. For example, as groups
participated in awareness activities focusing on food en-
vironments (i.e., accessibility and affordability of healthy
foods and produce) during Month 2, they also examined
and discussed their personal environments and circum-
stances (i.e., impact of work schedule and family dynamics
on eating habits).
The final three months of the intervention (the imple-
mentation/action phase) was facilitated by a self-selected
leader and included the period when the group imple-
mented the identified project. The action steps and
benchmarks established during the planning phase of
the intervention guided the group’s activities. As a
process evaluation measure, research staff monitored the
fidelity to the curriculum through site visits during those
last 3 months.
Each participant received a $150 gift card at each as-
sessment (pre- and post-), each participating church
(leadership and administration) received $200 for assist-
ance in recruitment and provision of space, and the
Change Clubs received $1,000 each to support their
planned community activities.
Measures
Participants completed a questionnaire at baseline to
provide demographic information: age, marital status,
occupational status, education level, income level, and
household characteristics. Most questions were based on
those used in national surveys, i.e., the U.S. Census and
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [34].
Feasibility of the Change Club study was measured by
rates of retention and adherence, with retention defined
as the percentage of those who completed the pre- post-
assessments (6 months), and adherence operationalized
as the number of sessions attended during the first
3 months of the study. To provide further insight into
feasibility in terms of acceptability of the intervention
and group progress toward stated goals, the post-
assessment
included
acceptability
and
satisfaction
questions. The identified Change Club leader and one
other randomly selected participant from each group
also participated in key informant interviews (KIIs)
post-intervention. Interviews were conducted by two
research team members and were guided by a semi-
structured interview guide. Key topics included perceptions
of roadblocks and factors leading to success; feedback on
research team support; experiences with connecting and
communicating with political decision makers and stake-
holders and others in the community; perceptions about
group dynamics and communication among members; and
thoughts about the overall experience. Data analysis is
described below.
Anthropometrics, psychosocial, physiological, and be-
havioral outcomes were collected within two weeks prior
to the start of the Change Club intervention (pre) and
again within two weeks following the conclusion of the
6-month
intervention
(post).
Demographic
variables
were only collected during the pre-assessment. See
Table 2 for a complete list of measures.
The assessed psychosocial factors hypothesized to
serve as the mechanisms by which civic engagement en-
acts behavior change per our study framework included:
self-regulation,
collective
efficacy,
perceived
stress
(proposed to be reduced through empowerment), self-
efficacy, and perceived social support [35–40]. The
Civic Engagement Scale was used to measure civic
engagement [41]. Because of the hypothesized cultural
relevance of the civic engagement approach, data were
collected from the African American Acculturation Scale,
which measures dimensions of African American culture,
whereby a higher score means greater acculturation to the
African American culture [42, 43].
Dietary intake was based on two telephone-based, 24-h
dietary recalls conducted by trained research personnel,
either a registered dietitian or graduate students in nutri-
tion, using the multiple-pass protocol [44]. The multiple-
pass method is a multi-step process designed to enhance
complete and accurate food recall and reduce respondent
burden [44]. Telephone recalls were unannounced. Data
were entered using the Nutrition Coordinating Center at
the University of Minnesota Food’s Nutrition Data System
for Research (NDSR) [45].
Physical activity was measured both objectively by
accelerometry (ActiGraph Model GT3X), worn for seven
consecutive days, and by self-report over the previous
7 days (International Physical Activity Questionnaire,
long form) [46]. Cardiovascular fitness was measured
using the Rockport 1-mile walk test, which has been
Brown et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:112 
Page 5 of 13
 validated with racially diverse sedentary women [47].
Blood pressure was measured to the nearest 1 mmHg
using a validated American Heart Association protocol
[48, 49].
Body weight was measured using a digital floor scale
(Seca 876). Height was measured, using a portable stadi-
ometer (Seca 214) according to the procedures of Loh-
man [50]. Waist circumference was measured using a
research-grade retractable tape measure (Seca 200), also
using Lohman procedures [50]. Percent body fat was
measured by bioelectric impedance (Body Composition
Analyzer MC – TBF-410, Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
and estimated using an equation developed and vali-
dated for Black/African American women [51].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics of the demographic information
were composed and tabulated. Potential confounding
variables were selected from the following: age (year),
education (≤high school or > high school), annual in-
come (≤US$35,000 or > US$35,000), partnered vs. not
partnered, employed full-time
vs. part-time or not
employed, nativity (born in US or not), and the African
American Acculturation Scale score. Selections were
done through fitting each of these potential confounding
variables into the model with the pre-post indicator as
independent variables. Observations were made on how
much the estimate of the pre-post indicator changed.
Variables were categorized as a potential confounder if

 its inclusion caused the regression estimate of the pre-
post indicator to change more extreme than 10%.
Two regression models were performed for each out-
come, an unadjusted model using only the pre-post indi-
cator as the predictor; and an adjusted model that
controls for confounding variables identified by the
method described above. We opted for using mixed
models with individual identification numbers as the
random intercept so that each participant would have
her own intercept. We favored the mixed model ap-
proach over paired sample t-test because mixed model
can tolerate some degree of imbalanced data, which was
introduced by five participants who were lost to follow
up. Due to the low sample size, adjustments could not
be performed for the site (church) as a random effect
within which the individuals were nested as the models
failed to converge. Control for churches’ effect was car-
ried out as a fixed independent variable. Stata Statistical
Software: Release 14 was used for the data management
and analysis [52]. While the a priori type I error rate
was set at 5%, this is a pilot study aiming to understand
feasibility and estimate effect size, therefore, the p-values
of this analysis should be evaluated with caution.
Qualitative data analysis
The research assistants digitally recorded and transcribed
the KIIs. Data were analyzed using the qualitative analysis
technique, inductive thematic analysis, in which meaning-
ful patterns and themes were identified and examined
[53]. First, the team developed the initial codebook based
on emergent themes from the KII transcripts. The code-
book was refined based on coding several initial tran-
scripts. Inter-coder reliability was established at 80%
agreement or greater; in the few instances where this was
not achieved, researchers met to discuss discrepancies and
further refined the codebook to clarify code definitions.
The process was repeated until inter-coder reliability was
established. NVivo 10 software was utilized to assist in the
coding and analysis the process (QSR International,
Australia) [54].
Results
Baseline
Baseline data were obtained for 28 women. Demo-
graphic characteristics of the sample are summarized in
Table 3. The sample had a mean age of 50.5 years; 53.6%
had obtained an associate degree or above; 60.7% had an
income of $35,000 or above; and 57.4% were employed
full time. As shown in Table 4, at baseline across the
four churches (n = 28) the mean weight was 204.8 lbs
(95% CI 190.4, 219.3, and mean body fat percentage was
45.6% (95% CI 43.5, 47.8). Mean systolic blood pressure
was 135.4 mmHg (95% CI 127.0, 143.7), and mean dia-
stolic blood pressure was 81.2 mmHg (95% CI 77.5,
84.9). Participants self-reported 3325 MET-minutes per
week of physical activity and at baseline, the average
time for the walking test was 22 min and 6 s (95% CI
20.7, 23.4). Participants consumed an average of 1834
kcals/day (95% CI 1289, 1952), 2790 mg sodium/day
(95% CI 2239, 3342), 1.3-cup equivalents of fruit/day
(95% CI 0.8, 1.9) and 2.2-cup equivalents of vegetables/
day (95% CI 1.6, 2.7).
Feasibility
All participants were satisfied with the intervention:
100% responded they were “very satisfied” or “generally
satisfied”
with
the
overall
experience;
and
100%
responded they were “very satisfied” or “generally satis-
fied” with the progress their Change Club had made
with respect to meeting self-identified action steps and
achieving their overall goal. All four Change Clubs met
all of their self-identified action steps for community
change within approximately 6 months. Study retention
was 82.1% and adherence was 79.0% supporting the
feasibility of the intervention. The Change Club initia-
tives included provision of organizing monthly cooking
demonstrations for the community, education and skills

 for healthier eating among food pantry patrons, compil-
ing a cookbook and healthy lifestyle tips to support par-
ents in providing healthy foods for their children, and
organizing a health fair (See Table 5).
Based on the qualitative analysis of the KIIs, emergent
themes included positive perceptions of the overall ex-
perience, appreciation of connecting with others in the
group, strengths and skills of the group members, the
barrier of time, and the challenge of managing different
viewpoints. See Table 6 for major themes and supporting
quotes. Participants and leaders felt their Change Clubs
were successful and attributed this success to effective
teamwork and a diversity of skills within the groups..
Study participants indicated overall satisfaction with the
support from the research team and expressed gratitude
for the opportunity for empowerment and cultivation of

 leadership skills. In terms of the civic engagement as-
pects of the intervention, emergent themes focused on
positive aspects, such as connecting with others in the
group and being motivated by them. Meanwhile, time
was the biggest challenge to participation. Key themes
for group dynamics included: acknowledgement and ap-
preciation of the strengths that individual Change Club
members brought to the group, view that the group was
greater than the sum of its parts, establishment of posi-
tive social connections, challenge of managing different
views, and concern about uneven participation by group
members.
Psychosocial factors
All of the psychosocial variables (self-regulation, collect-
ive efficacy, self-efficacy, perceived social support), ex-
cept perceived stress changed in the expected direction
[40]. However, none achieved statistical significance
(data not shown).
Outcome measure
Pre-post changes in dietary outcomes were in the ex-
pected direction, although none achieved statistical
significance.
Total
daily
caloric
intake
decreased
(−233.9 calories, 95% CI −533.7, 65.8); mean daily intake
of fruits (0.76 cups/day, 95% CI −0.12, 1.64) and vegeta-
bles (0.50 cups/day, 95% CI −0.52, 1.55) increased; and
mean daily intake of sodium decreased (−307.3 mg/day,
95% CI −938.9, 324.2).
For physical activity, participants self-reported 3325
MET-minutes per week at baseline. Both the adjusted
and unadjusted estimates indicate significant pre-post
increases in physical activity (adjusted model: 1619, 95%
CI 40, 3416). Accelerometry data, however, did not show
significant changes although these outcomes (moderate
or vigorous physical activity time and total accelerome-
try count) were in the expected direction (9.23 1000
counts/day, 95% CI −26.82, 45.28).
The intervention had a significant effect on the finish
time of the 1-mile walk test (−1.89 min, 95% CI −2.89,

Overall Experience
• The overall experience was positive
“For the congregation, the people we spoke to, the people I spoke to, are very
enthusiastic with what we shared with them and that we are going to continue. We
were recognized as a group that had a successful six months”
“Knowledge. Not so much about the health. I think my eating habits have probably
worsened. But it made me care about my health. I use my pedometer and I want to
get fit. So those are the things. I learned patience. I am retired so it was interesting
working on a project like this and using all the skills that one acquires I guess.”
Civic Engagement Piece
• Many participants noted positive aspects related to connecting
with others in the group and being motivated by them
• Working within a familiar neighborhood and community (that
of the church) facilitated the group project
• Time was the biggest challenge to participation
“It was wonderful we worked together we were cooperative and everyone had
assignments and there was a leader basically but everyone had a strength in
something was how it worked for our group.”
“We met on Sundays and sometimes that time became a crunch time because some
of the members had other committee meetings to attend other members lived in
other places.”
“Quite a few people in our Change Club, at least two, are native Bostonians. Because
they’re native Bostonians then they know the area, they know people. I think out of
the group all of us are familiar with different segments, and I think all of us are …
voters, so I think all of us kind of knew where we could go.”
Group Dynamics
• Strengths that individual Change Club members brought to the
group were acknowledged and appreciated
• The group was at times viewed as greater than the sum of its
parts
• Positive social connections were made
• It was sometimes challenging to manage differing views
• There was concern about uneven participation by group
members
“The team itself we had a good coach and the individual people who participated
everyone was willing to share. And learn from each other and everyone had to
contribute everyone made a contribution.”
“We had one person who was like a walking encyclopedia—we don’t have
encyclopedias anymore, but—she was full of resources and I knew if we needed to
know anything, she would know.”
“Everybody knew that any idea was welcome on the floor and sometimes we ran up
on a solution that would not have come about if it weren’t for the freedom to
brainstorm, so I definitely think people communicated very well.”
“In the end I cared and I didn’t expect to care so much. You know ‘I’ll never see these
women again. Our lives are very different.’ And just move on, but it didn’t turn out
that way.”
“When people were pushed against the wall, or when questions were asked, I mean
people just shut down. Trying to engage everybody and bring them back in when
someone shut down because they didn’t agree with what was going or they felt
uncomfortable.”
“I think we had people who could be insensible. People who weren’t really
committed. At times I felt I was overbearing and over-dominating and very focused
on trying to get the task completed. There was gridlock sometimes, we had reach an
impasse and I had to call [our original facilitator] to intervene and run some things
past her.”

 −0.84, p < 0.001). The intention was to use the walk time
and final heart rate to calculate an estimated maximal
volume of oxygen uptake (VO2max) with a validated re-
gression equation, however, the average walk times were
too long for the estimation formula to be applicable
[47]. Walk times are only reported. Heart rates were
within the targeted range for this age group, suggesting
that participants were exerting themselves adequately.
There were also significant pre-post changes in systolic
blood pressure (−12.73 mmHg, 95% CI −18.94, −6,51,
p < 0.001).
As shown in Table 4, although not significant, mean
body weight increased (0.54, 95% CI −2.07, 3.16), with a
pre-post range of 1.9 lbs for body weight. Mean waist
circumference increased significantly (4.77, 95% CI 1.56,
7.98, p < 0.05) with a pre-post range of 5.6 cm. Body fat
percentage, while not significant, changed in the ex-
pected direction (−0.64, 95% CI −1.61, 0.32).
Discussion
The findings suggest that a civic engagement approach
to behavior change among Black/African American
women demonstrates a level of feasibility and prelimin-
ary effectiveness. There are notable strengths and weak-
nesses of the study. One strength is the demonstration
of feasibility via several indicators. Observed rates of ad-
herence and retention were comparable and in some
cases better than in previous weight loss interventions
that only included Black/African American women. For
example, in a review by Fitzgibbon et al., retention rates
ranged from 72% to 80%, and adherence was 83% in the
one quasi-experimental study that included this metric
[2]. In comparison, retention and adherence rates among
Black/African American women subjects in interven-
tions including multiple races were as low as 37% and
41%, respectively [2]. Our study therefore further sup-
ports the literature suggesting that interventions may be
most acceptable to Black/African American women if
they are culturally appropriate and tailored. The results
should be interpreted with caution, however, given that
adherence was not measured for the last 3 months of
the intervention (discussed more below). Additionally,
the somewhat higher financial inventive designed to
compensate for the participant burden may have influ-
enced the response rate, and the feasibility of sustaining
this incentive amount in future large studies should be
re-examined. Post-intervention results from both the
quantitative and qualitative sources indicate that the
study
participants
were
highly
satisfied
with
their
Change Club experience. For example, a key theme of
the KIIs was that the overall experience was described as
being positive. The KIIs suggested that the participants
believed they were successful in inspiring and motivating
their communities suggesting a positive influence of the
empowerment and civic engagement. Study results also
indicate preliminary effectiveness, with pre-post improve-
ments in dietary intake, physical activity levels, cardiovascu-
lar fitness, and blood pressure. Considering the prevalence
of hypertension among Black/African American women,
the significant decrease in systolic blood pressure is promis-
ing. While changes in blood pressure are often seen with
weight loss, interestingly these changes were present inde-
pendent of changes in weight. Physical activity is considered
an independent contributor to lowering blood pressure,
and may have contributed to the reductions in systolic
blood pressure among study participants [55–57].
Despite the promising results, there are limitations
that should be discussed. It was not feasible to obtain at-
tendance data for the final 3 months of the intervention
after the research facilitator stepped away. Additionally,
while the intervention was originally designed for the
Change Clubs to advocate for policy changes within
their communities, a study finding worthy of further in-
vestigation is the domain of influence and impact chosen
by the Change Clubs. Each Change Club identified a
community-level, programmatic intervention to imple-
ment over the 6-month study instead of reaching the
(arguably) more impactful policy-level domain. This
finding could be attributed to a greater confidence
within the Black/African American community of grass-
roots community processes and neighborhood-based pro-
grams rather than political advocacy and engagement with
historically disenfranchising political structures [58, 59].
For example, none chose to try to enact broader change
by engaging in political advocacy. The curriculum may
need to be enhanced to bolster the aspect of political en-
gagement and activism. The Change Clubs, however, de-
cided on manageable programs to implement within the
timeframe, and realized success at meeting their action
steps. This is supportive of the study framework, in that
setting and achieving realistic goals may have increased
self-regulation and self- and collective-efficacy, leading to
behavior change. Although not adequately powered to see
changes in the psychosocial outcomes, pre-post changes
in these factors are consistent with the study framework.
Anticipated future work will include a larger, randomized,
controlled trial adequately powered for mediation analysis
to best evaluate the hypothesized mechanisms.
Another noteworthy unanticipated outcome included
the increase in perceived stress post intervention, al-
though the change was not statistically significant. This
was unexpected given the anticipated increase in em-
powerment, as well as the increase in social support and
camaraderie through group interactions. A possible ex-
planation for this finding is that stress increased due to
the additional obligation of being a part of the Change
Club. This explanation is supported by the qualitative
data, in which the participants described time constraints,
Brown et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:112 
Page 10 of 13
 uneven participation by group members, and conflicting
commitments. Creative strategies to overcome barriers
and the stress of participation should therefore be ex-
plored in future studies. These might include the facilita-
tion of off-site participation through conference calls and
video conferencing.
There is a growing body of evidence on culturally
adapted interventions specifically designed to improve
diet and weight outcomes for Black/African American
women. In a systematic review of interventions with cul-
turally adapted strategies for this at-risk target population,
the authors categorized culturally adapted strategies as per-
ipheral (targeted recruitment of Black/African Americans
in the media and community), constituent–involving (en-
gagement of the community in the planning and imple-
mentation of the intervention), socio-cultural (address
themes such as spirituality, religiosity, faith, traditional and
cultural foods, social support, barriers, and body image),
and evidential and linguistic (consideration of scientific evi-
dence and participant literacy levels) [60]. The review
found more significant changes in behavior and weight
when constituent-involving strategies were used, which is
the strategy utilized in the Change Club civic engagement
curriculum.
A finding also noted by Kong et al. and in the
AACORN paradigm is the need to consider ethnic diver-
sity among the Black/African American population and
further examination of how this will influence the devel-
opment of future interventions [16, 60]. In this study,
recruitment of foreign-born women was somewhat re-
flective of the state’s Black/African American population
(21.4% foreign-born in the study vs. 32.8% in the state)
[61]. Although data are not shown, score on the African
American Acculturation Scale was not found to be asso-
ciated with place of birth. However, other results from
this study suggest the importance of place of birth in
predicting changes in weight, body fat percentage, dia-
stolic blood pressure, and total accelerometry counts. As
Kong et al. described, involving the community in the
development and implementation of interventions is
particularly critical to better understand the target popu-
lation and recognize the heterogeneity among the group
[60]. Future studies with larger sample size should pay
greater attention to how cultural variables and ethnicity
relate to study outcomes and possible mediation of the
influence of the intervention.
The intent of this pilot study was to determine trends
and obtain data that would allow for calculation of an
adequately powered sample in a larger study, should re-
sults prove promising. By design, the sample size was
small with a goal of recruiting 40 participants from four
churches. Due to unanticipated recruitment challenges,
however, the sample size was smaller, which is another
study limitation. Recruitment strategies, therefore, needed
to be tailored for each church based on church culture,
internal systems, and leadership structure. Church leader-
ship and potential study participants were nearly univer-
sally enthusiastic about the study, however recruitment
required more steps than anticipated, such as develop-
ment of several different forms of recruitment materials
and presentation to and approval by the church’s govern-
ing body or health ministry. It therefore required more
time than anticipated, a key learning for future studies.
Overall, study results suggest the cultural appropriate-
ness and efficacy of civic engagement as an approach to
behavior change of Black/African American women. Sig-
nificant improvements in behavioral outcomes such as
self-reported physical activity, cardiovascular fitness, and
systolic blood pressure were realized. The small sample
size suggests that the results should be interpreted with
caution, however these noteworthy and promising re-
sults provide justification for a larger study. Interestingly,
subjective measures of physical activity improved signifi-
cantly, objective accelerometry-based physical activity
data changed in the expected direction but was not sig-
nificant. This could be due to an increased awareness in
physical activity habits as a result of participating in the
study. As shown in the significant decreases in their pre-
post walk times, the study participants also improved
their cardiorespiratory fitness. Overall, the study demon-
strated positive impacts on dietary intakes, which coun-
ters the (albeit non-significant) pre-post increases in
weight. One possible explanation supports the fit and fat
concept, in which study participants became fitter
throughout the intervention, despite not losing weight
[62]. There was also an unexpected pre-post increase in
waist circumference, which was statistically significant.
A growing body of literature suggests an association be-
tween abdominal adiposity, obesity, and stress through
the action of increased cortisol, which could provide a
possible explanation for the observed results of in-
creased perception of stress and waist circumference
[63, 64]. Future larger scaled studies may explore this
possibility given the prevalence of stress and stress-
related diseases in this population.
A major consideration in the interpretation of the re-
sults of this pre-post feasibility study is the lack of a com-
parison group and the small sample size. The changes
found therefore cannot be definitively attributed to the
intervention itself, given other possible contributing fac-
tors. Furthermore, participants received both the Change
Club civic engagement curriculum as well as nutrition
education based on an effective heart health program for
women [33]. However, only education was provided and
behavioral components such as skill-building and actual
physical activity were not included. It is therefore unlikely
that the education alone was responsible for changes in
outcomes. A larger, randomized, controlled trial with
Brown et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:112 
Page 11 of 13
 three study arms (control, nutrition education only, and
the Change Club civic engagement intervention) would
fully resolve this question.
Conclusions
Overall, this novel behavior change intervention involv-
ing civic engagement shows promise as an effective,
culturally-appropriate approach not only to implement
individual-level changes of the study participants but
also individuals of the broader community in order to
address heart disease among Blacks/African Americans
overall.
