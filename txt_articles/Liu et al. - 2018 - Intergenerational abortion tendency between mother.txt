ach year, about 6.7 million induced abortions are performed 
in developed nations.1 A considerable proportion of these 
procedures are among teens aged 19 years or younger, at 
rates of 12–25 per 1000 women, depending on the country.2–7 In Can-
ada, the teen pregnancy rate is 28 per 1000, with more than half of 
these pregnancies ending in induced abortion.6,7 Short-term mor-
bidity related to the procedure is uncommon, but includes incom-
plete procedure, infection, hemorrhage and hematometra, as well 
as uterine perforation.8 Compared with women with abortion at an 
older age, those who undergo induced abortion as teenagers are 
more likely to report psychologic stress related to the procedure.9,10
Teen induced abortion may be influenced by factors at the indi-
vidual, family, peer and community levels.11,12 A positive association 
has been observed between mother and daughter in the timing of 
fertility practices,13 age of first childbirth14 and teen child-bearing.12,15 
We examined whether there is an intergenerational association 
between mothers and their teenage daughters with respect to 
induced abortion.
Methods
Study setting
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study 
using administrative health care data for the province of Ontario, 
Canada, where health care, including induced abortion proced-
ures, is publicly funded. Abortion services, legalized in Canada in 
January 1988,16,17 can be accessed through outpatient clinics and 
hospitals up to 24 weeks gestational age.16 Almost all induced 
abortions in Canada are performed as surgical procedures, with 
less than 5% being pharmaceutically induced18 with methotrexate 
and misoprostol or with misoprostol alone.19 During the period of 
the current study, mifepristone was unavailable in Canada.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: A teenage woman’s sexual 
health practices may be influenced by her 
mother’s experience. We evaluated 
whether there is an intergenerational ten-
dency for induced abortion between 
mothers and their teenage daughters.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
population-based cohort study involving 
daughters born in Ontario between 1992 
and 1999. We evaluated the daughters’ 
data for induced abortions between age 12 
years and their 20th birthday. We assessed 
each mother’s history of induced abor-
tion for the period from 4 years before her 
daughter’s birth to 12 years after (i.e., 
when her daughter turned 12 years of 
age). We used Cox proportional hazard 
models to estimate a daughter’s risk of 
having an induced abortion in relation to 
the mother’s history of the same proced-
ure. We adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for 
maternal age and world region of origin, 
mental or physical health problems in the 
daughter, mother– 
daughter cohabita-
tion, neighbourhood-level rate of teen 
induced abortion, rural or urban resi-
dence, and income quintile.
RESULTS: A total of 431 623 daughters 
were included in the analysis. The cumu-
lative probability of teen induced abortion 
was 10.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
9.8%–10.4%) among daughters whose 
mother had an induced abortion, and 
4.2% (95% CI 4.1%–4.3%) among daugh-
ters whose mother had no induced abor-
tion, for an adjusted HR of 1.94 (95% CI 
1.86–2.01). The adjusted HR of a teenaged 
daughter having an induced abortion in 
relation to number of maternal induced 
abortions was 1.77 (95% CI 1.69–1.85) with 
1 maternal abortion, 2.04 (95% CI 1.91–
2.18) with 2 maternal abortions, 2.39 (95% 
CI 2.19–2.62) with 3 maternal abortions 
and 2.54 (95% CI 2.33–2.77) with 4 or more 
maternal abortions, relative to none.
INTERPRETATION: We found that the risk 
of teen induced abortion was higher 
among daughters whose mother had had 
an induced abortion. Future research 
should explore the mechanisms for inter-
generational induced abortion.

Although access to abortion services can vary geographically,20–22 
there is no legal restriction based on a woman’s age.3 Parental 
consent is not required for adolescents aged 16 years or older or 
for counselled mature minors under 16 years of age.23
Data sources
All study databases are housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative 
Sciences (ICES) in Toronto. We identified induced abortion proced-
ures by combining information from the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database, the National Ambula-
tory Care Reporting System and the Ontario Health Insurance Plan 
(OHIP) database, which contains billing information for all phys 
icians 
(Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170595/-/DC1). We obtained demographic information through 
the Registered Persons Database; determined each mother’s immi-
grant status through the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Can-
ada Permanent Resident database; and identified mother–daughter 
pairs in the MOMBABY data set. These data sets were linked with 
unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES.
Participants
We first identified all daughters born alive in Ontario between 
Jan. 1, 1992, and Dec. 31, 1999. We excluded daughters whose 
mothers were younger than 12 years of age or older than 50 years 
of age at the daughter’s birth, those whose mother’s country of 
birth was unknown, daughters with less than 12 years of follow-
up since the date of birth, those missing information on income 
quintile and those residing in a neighbourhood with a sparse 
number of teens, as described below.
Exposures and outcomes
The primary exposure was whether a mother had at least 1 induced 
abortion in the period from 4 years before her daughter’s birth up 
to 12 years after (i.e., when her daughter turned 12 years of age). 
We assigned each daughter to the exposed or the unexposed 
group, according to whether her mother had an induced abortion 
during this defined period. We had 2 reasons for defining the expos-
ure period as 4 years before to 12 years after the daughter’s birth. 
First, given that the mean age at menarche is 12.7 years,24 starting 
at 12 years after the daughter’s birth would approximate the earli-
est age that a daughter might undergo induced abortion. Second, 
data on induced abortion were available in our data sets only from 
1988 onward, the year when the procedure was legalized. Thus, for 
daughters in our cohort born in 1992, only a 4-year look-back win-
dow (to 1988) was possible. Nevertheless, as described below, we 
performed additional analyses considering a maternal history of 
induced abortion in the period between 10 years before and 
16 years after the daughter’s birth, and in the period when the 
mother was aged 15 years up to 38–43 years. 
The secondary exposure was the cumulative number of induced 
abortions that the mother had in the period between 4 years before 
and 12 years after the daughter’s birth, categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3 or ≥ 4. 
The primary study outcome was time to a daughter’s first 
teen induced abortion, between age 12 years and her 20th birth-
day. For the primary outcome, we followed each daughter from 
age 12 years to the date of the first induced abortion; otherwise, 
the daughter’s data were censored if she died, was lost to follow-
up, reached her 20th birthday, or was alive and event-free at the 
end of the study (Mar. 31, 2016). The secondary study outcome 
was the cumulative number of induced abortions that a daughter 
had as a teenager, censoring on the same factors as above.
We defined induced abortion as intentional termination of 
pregnancy through a surgical procedure or use of an abortifa-
cient pharmaceutical agent before 20 weeks gestational age 
(Appendix 1). If a woman had more than 1 induced abortion dur-
ing the study period, it was required that the subsequent abor-
tion occurred at least 90 days after the preceding one. The timing 
was determined either by the gestational age (in weeks) in the 
CIHI Discharge Abstract Database or the National Ambulatory 
Care Reporting System database or by an OHIP physician billing 
code for induced abortion at gestational age less than 15 weeks 
(“early”) or gestational age 15 weeks or older (“late”).
Covariables
Confounding factors were based on previous studies.25–27 The first 
set of factors, assessed at the daughter’s birth, were the mother’s 
age, the mother’s world region of origin,28 whether the daughter 
was born preterm (at 24–36 wk gestational age rather than at 
term), residential income quintile, and rural or urban residence. 
The second set of factors, when the daughter was 12 years of age, 
included residential income quintile, rural or urban residence, 
mother–daughter cohabitation (i.e., both residing within the same 
dissemination area [defined as a small, relatively stable geographic 
unit comprising 400–700 residents]) and rate of teen induced abor-
tion within the daughter’s residential dissemination area. The sec-
ond set of confounders also included any major physical illness or 
mental illness in the 2-year period before the daughter turned 
12 years of age, evaluated by the Johns Hopkins Aggregated Diag-
nostic Group using diagnostic information from inpatient care, emer-
gency department visits and physician visits.29,30 We calculated the 
rate of teen induced abortion in each residential dissemination area 
as the number of abortions experienced by girls aged 12–19 years 
residing in the same dissemination area in the same calendar year 
as when the daughter turned age 12 years, divided by the total 
number of girls aged 12–19 years residing within that dissemination 
area during that calendar year. It is for this reason that we excluded 
any daughter residing in a dissemination area with fewer than 
6 teenage girls at the time the daughter was 12 years of age.
Statistical analysis
We reported mothers’ and daughters’ characteristics for the exposed 
and unexposed groups. We used standardized differences to compare 
means and proportions, with absolute values greater than 0.10 being 
deemed to indicate important differences for a given variable.31,32
We calculated incidence rates of induced abortion, and used 
Cox proportional hazard models to generate hazard ratios (HRs) for 
a daughter having an induced abortion in relation to her mother 
having had the same procedure. We used robust sandwich variance 
estimates to account for clustering (i.e., daughters with the same 
mother).33 The HRs were adjusted for the covariables listed above.
The main model was then stratified by maternal age, world 
region of origin, residential income quintile, rate of teen induced

abortion within the residential dissemination area and mother–
daughter cohabitation. To account for possible right-censoring 
on the risk estimates from the main model, we restricted the 
sample to daughters born in 1995, thereby ensuring complete 
follow-up of each daughter to the day of her 20th birthday. 
Information on each mother’s history of induced abortion 
across all reproductive years was unavailable, so we performed 
3 additional analyses. First, we expanded the assessment of 
maternal history of induced abortion to the period from 4 years 
before to 16 years after her daughter’s birth. Then, in a restricted 
sample of daughters born in 1998 and 1999, we further widened 
the assessment of maternal induced abortion to the period from 
10 years before to 16 years after her daughter’s birth. Finally, in a 
subcohort of daughters whose mothers were born between 1973 
and 1977, we estimated each daughter’s risk of having an 
induced abortion in relation to her mother having had an 
induced abortion from 15 years of age up to 38–43 years. 
We also evaluated whether the daughter’s first induced abor-
tion was early (< 15 wk gestational age) or late (≥ 15 wk gesta-
tional age). We used a Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard 
model34 to estimate the HR in this analysis. 
To assess for a dose–response effect, we first evaluated within 
the original Cox model the total number of induced abortions that 
the mother had had (0, 1, 2, 3 or ≥ 4) between 4 years before and 
12 years after the daughter’s birth date, and the corresponding 
HR for a daughter having any teen induced abortion. Then, we 
used multinomial logistic regression to assess the number of teen 
induced abortions that a daughter experienced (0, 1, 2 or ≥ 3) in 
relation to the number of maternal abortions (0, 1, 2 or ≥ 3). 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 
(SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Sunny-
brook Health Sciences Centre and the Office of Research Ethics 
at the University of Toronto.
Results
Of 474 582 daughters born in an Ontario hospital between Jan. 1, 
1992, and Dec. 31, 1999, 431 623 were included in the analysis: 73 518 
in the exposed group and 358 105 in the unexposed group (Figure 1).
Mothers who had an induced abortion during the specified 
period were younger at their daughters’ birth than mothers who 
did not have an abortion (26.2 v. 29.5 yr) (Table 1). A higher pro-

were born to mothers from South Asia, East Asia, the Caribbean 
and Hispanic America, and were more likely to reside in a low-
income area. Unexposed daughters were more likely to reside in 
a dissemination area with no teen induced abortions. Starting 
from birth, the mean follow-up time was 18.5 years in the 
exposed group and 18.7 years in the unexposed group (Table 1).
 Of the 73 518 daughters in the exposed group, 4880 had a 
teen induced abortion, for an incidence rate of 10.1 per 1000 
person-years. In the unexposed group of 358 105 daughters, 
10 108 had a teen induced abortion, for an incidence rate of 4.2 
per 1000 person-years (Table 2). The corresponding adjusted HR 
in the main model was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86–
2.01) (Table 2). The rate of teen induced abortion started to rise 
notably at about age 15 years, with the cumulative probability of 
having an induced abortion reaching 10.1% (95% CI 9.8%–10.4%) 
in the exposed group and 4.2% (95% CI 4.1%–4.3%) in the unex-
posed group by the 20th birthday (Figure 2). The adjusted HR for 
teen induced abortion persisted across variables at the daugh-
ter’s birth and at age 12 years (Appendix 2, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170595/-/DC1).
Limiting the main model to daughters born in 1995, all of 
whom had 20 years of follow-up, did not change the main find-
ings (Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170595/-/DC1). Similar results were obtained 
when we expanded the exposure period of maternal induced 
abortion, as either from 4 years before to 16 years after the 
daughter’s birth (Appendix 4, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170595/-/DC1) or from 10 years before to 
16 years after the daughter’s birth (Appendix 5, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170595/-/DC1), or when 
we considered maternal induced abortion from 15 up to 
38–43 years of age (Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170595/-/DC1).
Of all daughters who had a teen induced abortion, 14 158 
(94.5%) had the procedure early, at less than 15 weeks gesta-
tional age, and 645 (4.3%) had it late, at gestational age 15 weeks 
or older; for 185 (1.2%), gestational age was unknown. There 
was an association between a mother’s and her daughter’s 
induced abortion for both early (adjusted HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.87–
2.02) and late (adjusted HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.47–2.16) induced 
abortions among the daughters (Appendix 7, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
170595/-/DC1).
A dose–response effect was seen for teen induced abortion, 
with adjusted HRs of 1.77 (95% CI 1.69–1.85) among daughters 
whose mothers had 1 induced abortion in the exposure period, 
2.04 (95% CI 1.91–2.18) with 2 maternal abortions, 2.39 (95% CI

Furthermore, a daughter whose mother had 3 or more induced 
abortions was most likely to also have 3 or more induced abor-
tions (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.18, 95% CI 2.37–4.28), relative to 
a daughter whose mother had no induced abortions (Appendix 8, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
170595/-/DC1).
Interpretation
In Ontario, the risk of having an induced abortion as a teenager 
was twice as high among daughters whose mother had an 
induced abortion. This higher risk of intergenerational induced 
abortion persisted across various demographic groups and 
was more pronounced with increasing numbers of maternal 
abortions.

E101
The mechanisms for intergenerational induced abortion are 
unclear, and this study was not designed to assess such details. 
Several previous studies explored the determinants of teen abor-
tion, and reported that a woman is more likely to have a teen 
induced abortion if she has mental illness or a substance use dis-
order,25–27 poor school performance,25 teenage parents at her 
own birth, parents with a lower level of education25–27 or receiv-
ing income support,26 and family disruption resulting in separa-
tion from biological parents.26,27 These factors should be taken 
into consideration when studying intergenerational induced 
abortion. In a previous study from Finland, the adjusted OR for a 
daughter having a teen induced abortion was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5–2.2) 
among those whose mother did versus did not have an ante-
cedent induced abortion.26 However, no details were available to 
further characterize the association.
Limitations
This study lacked details on several factors, including informa-
tion about the daughter’s father, the marital status and educa-
tional attainment of both the daughter and her mother, and fam-
ily dynamics. Cohabitation of the mother and daughter was 
defined using a proxy, namely, that the mother and daughter 
were residing in the same dissemination area; however, it is pos-
sible that a mother and daughter lived nearby, but in different 
households. Although physician services for induced abortion 
are fully covered under Ontario’s universal health insurance sys-
tem, some women may have undergone induced abortion by a 
nonphysician or outside of the province.
In the main analysis, a mother’s history of induced abortion was 
assessed only between 4 years before and 12 years after the daugh-
ter’s birth, rather than throughout the mother’s reproductive years. 
However, in additional analyses that expanded the timing of mater-
nal abortion exposure, the associated risk persisted. We had no 
information about the indication for teen induced abortion. How-
ever, most occurred at less than 15 weeks gestational age, which 
suggests that most were for social indications, rather than for a rec-
ognized fetal trisomy or congenital anomaly (typically detected by 
prenatal screening after 16 weeks gestational age). We did not have 
information about the sex of the embryo or fetus carried by the 
daughter or mother, or about other liveborn children. We previ-
ously found that induced abortions were more likely among female 
fetuses of Indian-born mothers who already had daughters.35,36 
However, in the current study, we found no variation in intergener-
ational induced abortion across immigrant groups.
Conclusion
This study identified maternal induced abortion as a risk factor 
for teen induced abortion. Further assessment is required to 
determine the effectiveness of family-centred interventions 
(aimed at engaging parents) in reducing sexual behaviour and 
unprotected sex among teenagers. Future research should con-
sider more in-depth exploration of the factors that contribute not 
only to teen pregnancy, but also to a decision to proceed with 
induced abortion among teenage women.
