Pathologic inclusions define �-synucleinopathies that include Parkinson’s disease (PD). The most common genetic cause of PD is the
G2019S LRRK2 mutation that upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. However, the interaction between �-synuclein, LRRK2, and the forma-
tion of �-synuclein inclusions remains unclear. Here, we show that G2019S-LRRK2 expression, in both cultured neurons and dopami-
nergicneuronsintheratsubstantianigraparscompact,increasestherecruitmentofendogenous�-synucleinintoinclusionsinresponse

not increase formation of inclusions but reduces their abundance. In addition, treatment of primary mouse neurons with LRRK2 kinase
inhibitors, PF-06447475 and MLi-2, blocks G2019S-LRRK2 effects, suggesting that the G2019S-LRRK2 potentiation of inclusion forma-
tion depends on its kinase activity. Overexpression of G2019S-LRRK2 slightly increases, whereas WT-LRRK2 decreases, total levels of
�-synuclein. Knockdown of total �-synuclein with potent antisense oligonucleotides substantially reduces inclusion formation in
G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons, suggesting that LRRK2 influences �-synuclein inclusion formation by altering �-synuclein levels.

initial formation of �-synuclein pathology by increasing a pool of �-synuclein that is more susceptible to forming inclusions.

Introduction
�-Synuclein plays a central role in the development of Parkin-
son’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system
atrophy, and is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders. This is based on evidence that the
inclusions that form in the brain, such as Lewy bodies and Lewy
neuritis, are composed of �-synuclein (Duda et al., 2000; Spillan-
tini and Goedert, 2000). In addition, autosomal dominant mis-
sense mutations in SNCA (encoding �-synuclein), as well as
multiplication of the number of wild-type SNCA alleles that in-
crease protein expression can cause PD (Singleton et al., 2003;
Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004; Iba
´n
˜ez et al., 2004). The mechanism
Significance Statement
�-Synuclein inclusions are found in the brains of patients with many different neurodegenerative diseases. Point mutation,
duplication, or triplication of the �-synuclein gene can all cause Parkinson’s disease (PD). The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the
most common known genetic cause of PD. The interaction between G2019S-LRRK2 and �-synuclein may uncover new mecha-
nisms and targets for neuroprotection. Here, we show that expression of G2019S-LRRK2 increases �-synuclein mobility and
enhances aggregation of �-synuclein in primary cultured neurons and in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars
compacta, a susceptible brain region in PD. Potent LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, which are being developed for clinical use, block the
increased �-synuclein aggregation in G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons. These results demonstrate that �-synuclein inclusion
formation in neurons can be blocked and that novel therapeutic compounds targeting this process by inhibiting LRRK2 kinase
activity may slow progression of PD-associated pathology.

 by which �-synuclein converts from its physiologic to pathologic
form remains to be fully understood. Recent findings suggest that
stressors and/or PD-linked mutations may promote a shift in
�-synuclein protein from an oligomeric membrane-associated
form to a soluble monomeric form prone to misfolding and ag-
gregation (Burre
´ et al., 2015; Dettmer et al., 2015a, 2016).
Missense mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common
known cause of PD and may facilitate pathological processes un-
derlying �-synuclein neurotoxicity. Mice coexpressing LRRK2
with the pathogenic G2019S mutation and �-synuclein with the
pathogenic A53T mutation show increased neurodegeneration
and increased �-synuclein aggregate formation (Lin et al., 2009;
Daher et al., 2012). In addition, death of substantia nigra dopa-
minergic neurons induced by viral overexpression of �-synuclein
is exacerbated in rats expressing G2019S-LRRK2 (Daher et al.,
2015). Although mice overexpressing mutant �-synuclein either
through transgenes or viral transduction provide a valuable tool
for understanding the impact of abnormal �-synuclein in vivo,
�-synuclein aggregation is often coincident with cell death
and/or mortality; thus, the progression of inclusion formation
over time is difficult to analyze with conventional staining tech-
niques (Giasson et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002), although newer in
vivo imaging approaches may be able to provide some insight
(Osterberg et al., 2015).
Recently, we described a model in which preformed fibrils of
�-synuclein applied in low concentrations (nanomolar) in vitro
or in vivo to neurons cause the formation of ubiquitinated and
phosphorylated �-synuclein inclusions with morphological
characteristics that overlap with those found in postmortem PD
brain (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011, 2014b; Luk et al., 2012). These
inclusions are formed from endogenously expressed �-synuclein
as neurons from �-synuclein knock-out mice cannot form these
inclusions (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011). Here, we examine the
effects of G2019S-LRRK2 expression in neurons on the forma-
tion of �-synuclein pathology both in cultured neurons and in
vivo. Our results suggest that G2019S-LRRK2 may enhance the
development of �-synuclein pathology over time, potentially ex-
plaining a new link between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and PD
susceptibility.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All animal protocols were approved by the University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 80-23). The
murine G2019S-LRRK2 and WT-LRRK2 BAC mice were previously de-
scribed (Li et al., 2010) and have been backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J
mice for �10 generations. The Sprague Dawley human G2019S-LRRK2
BAC transgenic rats were developed in the laboratory of Chenjian Li,
rederived at Taconic Farms, and have been previously characterized
(West et al., 2014). Both female and male rodents were used in this study.
Primary neuron cultures. Primary neuron cultures were prepared as
described previously (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2014a). Briefly, the hip-
pocampi were dissected from the brains of embryonic (E16-E17) mice in
Hibernate E (BrainBits), digested with papain (Worthington Biochemi-
cal) in HBSS supplemented with HEPES (10 mM) and sodium pyruvate
(1 mM) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep), triturated and
plated in Neurobasal Media (Invitrogen) with B27 (Invitrogen), Glu-
taMAX (Invitrogen), and 10% FBS. Two to 24 h later, the media was
completely exchanged Neurobasal/B27/GlutaMAX (no pen/strep). Neu-
rons were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips or wells at 5 � 10 4
cells per cm 2.
Transfections. At day in vitro (DIV) 5 or 6, neurons for some experi-
ments were transfected with plasmids encoding human synuclein-eGFP
(Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2014b) using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen).
For each MatTek dish with 2 ml of neuronal media, 1 ml was removed
and saved as conditioned media. For the transfection, 1 �l of Lipo-
fectamine LTX was incubated in prewarmed 50 �l of DMEM and com-
bined with 50 �l of DMEM with 1 �g of plasmid DNA and 1 �l of
Lipofectamine PLUS reagent at a final volume of 100 �l, and incubated
for 5 min. The mixture was added to 1 ml neuronal media in the dish
(without pen/strep); and 4 h later, the media was completely exchanged
with neuronal media (50/50 mix of fresh media and conditioned media).
Preparation of fibrils and addition to primary neuron cultures. Mouse
�-synuclein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described
previously (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011, 2014a). To generate fibrils, 5
mg/ml of purified �-synuclein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCL
(“buffer A” from Bousset et al., 2013) was shaken at 1000 rpm in a
thermomixer for 7 d. On the day the fibrils were added to neurons (DIV
7), the fibrils were thawed, diluted in PBS to 100 �g/ml, and sonicated
using a 1/8 inch probe tip (Fisher Scientific, model 120, catalog
#FB120110) for 30 s total time with 1 s on and 1 s off at 10% power.
Neurons were exposed to 2 �g/ml of fibrils. Sedimentation assays and
thioflavin T assays were performed as described previously (Volpicelli-
Daley et al., 2014a) to ensure fibril quality. The Pierce LAL endotoxin
detection kit determined that 0.004 ng/ml of endotoxin was added to the
primary cultures.
Antisense oligonucletides. The antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were
synthesized and provided by Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Bennett and
Swayze, 2010). The sequence of the �-synuclein ASO was TTTAATT
ACTTCCACCA, and the sequence of the control ASO was CCTATAG
GACTATCCAGGAA.
Immunoblotting. Neurons were scraped into cold 1% Triton X-100 in
50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) with PhosSTOP phosphatase
inhibitors and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Life Sci-
ence), sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000 � g at 4°C. The supernatant
was added to 2 � Laemmli buffer with 5% DTT, 40 mM sodium fluoride,
and equal concentrations of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using
7.5% TGX gels for LRRK2 immunoblots and 4%–20% gradient gels
(Bio-Rad) for synuclein immunoblots and transferred to PVDF
(Millipore Immobilon P). Blots were blocked in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and
5% skimmed-milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer.
Primary antibodies included the following: synuclein mouse antibody
(Syn1, BD Biosciences), LRRK2 (c41-2; Abcam), pS1292-LRRK2
(MJFR-19-7-8, Abcam), VDAC (NeuroMab), and Tuj1 (Neuromics
Antibodies). Following washing, membranes were incubated in HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab-
oratories), washed and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence.
Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ.
Immunofluorescence, and quantitation of images. Primary neurons
were fixed with 4% PFA and 4% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4. Neurons were
blocked and permeabilized with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fol-
lowing rinsing, neurons were incubated in primary antibody diluted in
PBS and 3% BSA as previously described (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011,
2014a). Primary antibodies included mAB81A (Waxman and Giasson,
2008), MAP2 (Fisher Scientific), and tau (Dako). Following rinses,
neurons were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in PBS and 3%

 BSA. Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor-conjugated anti-rabbit,
anti-mouse whole IgG, anti-mouse IgG1-specific, or anti-mouse IgG2a-
specific (Invitrogen). After rinsing, coverslips were mounted using Pro-
long Gold mounting media (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescent images
were captured using a Leica TCS-SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope
using computer-assisted image acquisition and an automated stage. All
images were captured at the same laser power, gain, and offset. For
each experiment, at least 10 images were acquired in a randomly
assigned grid on each coverslip, and all experiments were repeated at
least three times using independent cultures from different breeding
pairs of mice. Images were quantified using ImageJ as previously
described (Tran et al., 2014). The MaxEntropy Autothreshold func-
tion was applied to each image. The percentage area occupied was
quantified using the Measure function.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Neurons were im-
aged 18 d after adding fibrils (DIV 21–25). FRAP was performed using a
Nikon A1 High Speed Laser Confocal Spectral Imaging microscope with
a 63� oil-immersion objective at the UAB High Resolution Imaging
Shared Facility. Imaging was performed using Tyrode’s buffer (136 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2,10 mM glucose, and 10 mM
HEPES). �-Synuclein puncta that were an average length of �2.0 �m
were identified and bleached using a 405 nm laser (longer serpentine
�-synuclein-GFP in the fibril-treated cultures were not included in the
analyses). After bleaching, images were captured every 233 ms for a re-
maining 30 s. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using the Nikon
software. The average prebleach intensity was calculated, and the per-
centage recovery after photobleaching was calculated as the ratio of the
increase in fluorescence intensity from t � 0 s to t � 30 s divided by the
total bleached amount.
Surgeries. Hemizygous rats carrying the human G2019S-LRRK2 BAC
transgene, identified by PCR with DNA derived from tail snips using
primers GAT AGG CGG CTT TCA TTT TTC C and ACT CAG GCC
CCA AAA ACG AG, together with Phusion TaqDNA polymerase (New
England Biolabs). Transmission of the BAC transgene was 50%, and
littermates not positive for the transgene were included in the experi-
ments as nontransgenic (nonTg). Both males and female rats were in-
cluded in the experiments, and no gender effects could be observed in
this study. At 10–12 weeks of age, rats were deeply anesthetized with
isofluorane and stereotactically injected with 4 �l of 5 mg/ml of sonicated
fibrils into the right substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or 4 �l of 5
mg/ml monomeric �-synuclein into the left SNpc. Coordinates were 4.65
mm posterior, 2.25 mm lateral to bregma, and 4.45 mm ventral.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in rat brain sections.
Four weeks after injections, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and
transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 10 units/ml heparin fol-
lowed by ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were dissected, postfixed in 4%
PFA for 2 h at 4°C, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS, and flash
frozen in isopentane and stored at �80°C. The 40 �m coronal sections
were obtained using a freezing microtome. Sections were rinsed several
times with TBS. Sections were incubated for 10 min in 3% H2O2, rinsed,
incubated in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 0.05% Tween 20, for 30 min
at 37°C. Sections were blocked and permeabilized with 5% normal goat
or donkey serum, 0.3% concentration, in 0.3% Triton X-100, TBS, rinsed
and incubated in primary antibody in 5% normal serum TBS for 24–48
h at 4°C with agitation. Primary antibodies included mAB81A (Waxman
and Giasson, 2008), TH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and NeuN (Milli-
pore). After rinsing, sections were incubated in secondary antibody in
5% normal serum and TBS overnight at 4°C with agitation. After rinses,
sections were processed for immunofluorescence and mounted onto
charged slides using Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). For DAB staining, sec-
tions were incubated with Avidin-Biotin Complex reagent (Vector Lab-
oratories) for 30 min, rinsed and developed in ImmPACT-DAB (Vector
Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with 0.1% mg/ml cresyl vi-
olet rinsed, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount (ThermoFisher).
Immunofluorescent images were captured using a Leica TCS-SP5 laser
scanning confocal microscope. Images of DAB-stained sections were
captured using an Olympus BX61 microscope. Images were processed
using Adobe Photoshop for contrast and brightness and arranged in
Adobe Illustrator.
Stereology. Unbiased sterological estimations of TH and Nissl-positive
cells in the SNpc were performed by investigators blinded to genotype
and experimental conditions. Contours of the SNpc were identified by
Nissl stain using a low-power objective. Sections covered the entire SNpc
and were equally spaced 120 �m apart, with the Optical Fractionator
probe placed randomly, as performed previously (Daher et al., 2014). All
estimations were based on counts from at least 150 objects in the ran-
domly assigned grids. Unbiased stereological estimation of total number
of pS129-�-synuclein-positive perikaryal inclusions in the SNpc was also
performed by an investigator blinded to experimental conditions using
the rare-event counting probe in a Stereologer System (Stereology Re-
source Center). Animals were rejected from the analysis, as noted in
figure legends, if an observer blinded to the experimental conditions
determined that the injection site was not in the SNpc.
Kinaseassays.Atotalof10nMofrecombinantGST-taggedhumanLRRK2
(�970-2527, Invitrogen) was incubated with 10 �M LRRKtide (Thermo
Fisher), 100 �M ATP, and 0.1 �Ci [�-32P] ATP in buffer containing 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. MLi-2 or PF-06447475, synthesized
in-house, was titrated into the kinase reactions at 0–1000 nM concentration
as indicated. Kinase reactions were stopped by heating at 90°C after 1 h
incubation at 30°C followed by loading kinase reactions to P81 filter paper
(GE Healthcare). P81 paper was washed three times with 5% phosphoric
acid followed by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the ATP-
competitiveness of the LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, 1.1 nM Mli2 or 3.5 nM PF-
06447475 (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations, respectively) were
incubatedwith10nMrecombinantGST-LRRK2and10�MLRRKtide,inthe
presence of 0–2 mM �-32P labeled ATP (1 �Ci added per 1 mM ATP). All
data points were calculated from at least three independent reactions. The

scintillationcounting.KmandVmaxvaluesweredeterminedusingGraphPad
Prism 5.0.
Statistical analyses. The area occupied by p-�-synuclein was estimated
using mixed-effects models (covariance pattern models) to test for differ-
ences among groups. The mixed-effects model was used as it better controls
for Type I errors in the presence of missing data. Because the area occupied
by p-�-synuclein did not fit a normal distribution, a square root transfor-
mationwasusedtonormalizevaluesfortheareabeforeanalysis.Toaccount
for the correlation among the fields within an experiment, fields were mod-
eled as a random effect, nested within the experiment. An exchangeable
correlation structure was used to model the correlation among fields. Pa-
rameterswereestimatedusingrestrictedmaximumlikelihood,withpvalues
calculated using a Satterthwaite approximation. All calculations were per-
formedusing the lme4 package,3 version 1.1–11, in the Rstatistical comput-
ing environment, 4 version 3.3.0.
For the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, rates of
recovery of fluorescence were similarly estimated using mixed-effects linear

and group � time interactions, and a reduced model with only time and

tion of slope and intercept parameters. Parameters were estimated using
maximum likelihood, with CIs calculated from the likelihood profile using
the likelihood ratio test. All calculations were performed using the glm-
mADMB package, 5 version 0.8.3.2, in R.
Results
Increased �-synuclein in G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons
To study the effects of G2019S-LRRK2 on �-synuclein inclu-
sions, we selected WT-LRRK2 and G2019S-LRRK2 BAC strains
congenic on C57BL/6J that express protein at equivalent levels
and consistent with the distribution of endogenous LRRK2 pro-
tein in the mouse brain (Li et al., 2010; Webber et al., 2011; West
et al., 2014). We first characterized the levels of WT-LRRK2 and
G2019S-LRRK2 in neurons compared with nonTg mice in cul-
tured hippocampal neurons. LRRK2 levels were analyzed by im-
munoblot from lysates extracted at DIV 21, when neurons are
mature (Fletcher et al., 1994). Levels of LRRK2 were 10- to 12-

 fold increased in neurons from WT-LRRK2 and G2019S-LRRK2
BAC transgenic mice relative to nonTg neurons (Fig. 1A). Unex-
pectedly, levels of Triton X-100 extracted �-synuclein were de-
creased by half in neurons from WT-LRRK2-overexpressing mice
and increased approximately 1.5-fold in neurons from G2019S-
LRRK2-expressing mice, compared with nonTg control neurons
(Fig. 1B).
The efficiency of fibrils to induce inclusions depends on the
maturation stage and density of neurons (Volpicelli-Daley et al.,
2014a, b). Inclusion formation also depends on �-synuclein ex-
pression in synapses and synaptic maturation (Murphy et al.,
2000). However, expression of G2019S-LRRK2 has been shown
to negatively regulate neurite growth (MacLeod et al., 2006;
Da
¨chsel et al., 2010), at least before the neurons are fully mature.
To understand whether increased expression of WT or G2019S-
LRRK2 affected the abundance of neurites in cultured neurons,
we analyzed tau-positive axons and MAP2-positive dendrites us-
ing immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C).
There were no overt morphological differences between the
WT-LRRK2, G2019S-LRRK2, or nonTg control neurons, and
quantitation of confocal images revealed no significant difference
in the abundance of axons, dendrites, or total cell numbers in
culture (Fig. 1D–F). These data are consistent with previous find-
ings from this strain of mice that show expression of G2019S-

 LRRK2 has no effect on axon or dendritic development after DIV
7 (Sepulveda et al., 2013).
G2019S-LRRK2 enhances the abundance of
�-synuclein inclusions
To test whether neurons expressing G2019S-LRRK2 are more
sensitive to forming pathologic �-synuclein inclusions, sonicated
�-synuclein fibrils were added to neurons from nonTg mice,
WT-LRRK2 mice, or G2019S-LRRK2 BAC transgenic mice
at DIV 7, and at either 7 or 18 d after adding sonicated fibrils,
neurons were fixed and immunofluorescence was performed us-
ing an antibody to pS129-�-synuclein, a marker of inclusion for-
mation (Fig. 2A) (Waxman and Giasson, 2008). In neurons not
exposed to fibrils, there was minimal pS129-�-synuclein immu-
nofluorescence. Following 7 d incubation with sonicated fibrils,
the pS129-�-synuclein immunofluorescence in both neurons
from nonTg mice, WT-LRRK2 mice, and G2019S-LRRK2 mice
was much more intense with punctate and serpentine inclusions.
Confocal analysis for pS129-�-synuclein immunofluorescence
intensity 7 d after fibril exposure demonstrated that there were no
differences in the abundance of �-synuclein inclusions in neu-
rons from G2019S-LRRK2 mice compared with control nonTg
neurons (Fig. 2B).

there was a significant increase in the abundance of inclusions in

 nonTg neurons (Fig. 2B,C). In contrast, neurons from WT-
LRRK2 mice had fewer inclusions relative to both nonTg and
G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons. Confocal images show that
in both nonTg, WT-LRRK2, and G2019S-LRRK2-expressing
neurons, �-synuclein inclusions colocalized with tau along axons
(Fig. 2C). The somal inclusions in the G2019S-LRRK2 neurons
were more abundant and the longer serpentine inclusions were
more apparent compared with the smaller axonal pS129-�-
synuclein-positive puncta seen in the nonTg and WT-LRRK2-
expressing neurons (Fig. 2C).
Knockdown of endogenous �-synuclein with ASOs
To determine the extent to which endogenous �-synuclein levels
contribute to the inclusion formation phenotype associated with
G2019S-LRRK2 expression, antisense oligonucleotides were ap-
plied to neurons at DIV 7, with or without 2 �g/ml of sonicated
fibrils. Neurons were harvested for immunoblots or fixed for
immunofluorescence 18 d later. �-Synuclein ASOs substantially
reduced levels of �-synuclein in primary neurons from both
nonTg and G2019S-LRRK2-expressing mice (Fig. 3A). Knock-
down of �-synuclein prevented formation of inclusions in the

Volpicelli-Daley et al. • G2019S-LRRK2 Increases �-Synuclein Inclusions
 G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons (Fig. 3B,C). Therefore, the
increase in inclusion formation produced by G2019S-LRRK2 ex-
pression depends on levels of total �-synuclein.
A proportion of �-synuclein in G2019S-LRRK2-expressing
neurons remains mobile in neurons with inclusions
The susceptibility of �-synuclein to form inclusions depends on a
balance between �-synuclein membrane association and cytosol lo-
calization (Burre
´ et al., 2015). We hypothesized that expression of
G2019S-LRRK2, associated with increased �-synuclein levels (Fig.
1B), may increase the mobile fraction of �-synuclein. FRAP experi-
ments characterize the membrane association of �-synuclein in liv-
ing neurons and show that disease-linked mutations in �-synuclein
reduceassociationwithmembranesandincreasemobility(Fortinet
al., 2005). FRAP experiments also preserve the membrane associa-
tion of �-synuclein in intact neurons, unlike biochemical experi-
ments in which the neurons are lysed, causing �-synuclein to
dissociate from membranes. To perform these experiments, nonTg
andG2019S-LRRK2-expressingneuronsweretransfectedwith�-sy-
nuclein-GFP,whichweandothershaveshowncanberecruitedinto
insoluble, phosphorylated inclusions after exogenous addition of
fibrils (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2014b; Osterberg et al., 2015). Soni-
cated fibrils were added at DIV 7 to the transfected neurons, and
FRAP experiments were performed 18 d later (DIV 25). In control
neurons at DIV 25 not exposed to fibrils, the percentage recovery of
�-synuclein-GFPwasincreasedforG2019S-LRRK2-expressingneu-
rons, with �30% recovery in nonTg neurons and 35% for G2019S-
LRRK2-expressing neurons at 30 s after bleach (Fig. 4). Eighteen
days after exposure to sonicated fibrils, fluorescence recovery was
substantially reduced in nonTg neurons (5% recovery) because
�-synuclein-GFP was sequestered into insoluble inclusions. How-
ever, in neurons expressing G2019S-LRRK2 that were exposed to
sonicated fibrils, fluorescence recovery was only slightly impaired to
25% recovery. Although there were more pS129-�-synuclein inclu-
sions in neurons expressing G2019S-LRRK2 (Fig. 2), these neurons
retained higher concentrations of mobile �-synuclein-GFP com-
pared with fibril-exposed nonTg neurons (5% for nonTg vs 25% for
G2019S-LRRK2). Rates of recovery of fluorescence were estimated
using the mixed effects linear models constructed with group and
time effects and group � time interactions. Genotype groups, treat-
ment groups (control vs fibril-treated), and the interaction between
genotype and treatment was significant (p � 0.001). Thus, in neu-
rons expressing G2019S-LRRK2, there is increased availability of
mobile �-synuclein that can be recruited into inclusions.
Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity rescues
G2019S-LRRK2-mediated increases in �-synuclein
inclusions
To determine whether the increased inclusion formation in
the G2019S-LRRK2 transgenic neurons depended on kinase
activity, we used two structurally distinct LRRK2 kinase inhib-
itors. Both MLi-2 and PF-06447475 are potent and selective
LRRK inhibitors; their chemical structures are shown in Fig-
ure 5A (Fell et al., 2015; Henderson et al., 2015). Neither
inhibitor is known to inhibit an off-target enzyme (e.g., an-
other kinase) with potency equal to LRRK2 or G2019S-
LRRK2. To compare these molecules directly, we found that
both MLi-2 and PF-06447475 inhibited LRRK2 peptide phos-
phorylation with similar IC50 values of 1.1 � 0.2 and 3.5 � 1.1
nM, respectively (Fig. 5B), demonstrating exceptional potency
for both molecules. A LRRK2 peptide phosphorylation assay
in the presence of 1.1 nM of MLi-2 or 3.5 nM of PF-06447475
demonstrated that both inhibitors increased the Km-ATP

while leaving the Vmax unchanged (1.97 � 0.03 min), suggest-
ing a near-perfect ATP-competitive inhibitory profile that is
comparable between the two molecules (Fig. 5C). These re-
sults show that MLi-2 and PF-06447475 inhibit LRRK2 in a
similar, ATP-competitive manner and with similar potencies
and have nanomolar inhibition profiles at physiological ATP
concentrations.
To empirically determine the concentration of inhibitor that
could block LRRK2 kinase activity in primary neurons, we
treated neurons using concentrations of PF-06447475 ranging
from 0.3 to 300 nM, and MLi-2 ranging from 0.03 to 30 nM.
Immunoblots of the authentic LRRK2 autophosphorylation site
pS1292-LRRK2 were used to empirically assess LRRK2 inhibition
(Sheng et al., 2012) (Fig. 5D). Both PF-06447475 and MLi-2 po-
tently reduced levels of pS1292-LRRK2 compared with vehicle
(DMSO)-treated neurons. Immunoblots of total LRRK2 demon-
strated that neither PF-06447475 nor MLi-2, even at the highest
concentrations tested and for 18 d incubation in neuronal media,
reduced total LRRK2 levels (Fig. 5D).
To analyze the effects of PF-06447475 and MLi-2 on pS129-
�-synuclein inclusions, neurons were cotreated with either PF-
06447475 or MLi-2 and 2 �g/ml of sonicated fibrils, and neurons
were processed for analysis 18 d later. Treatment with 30 nM
PF-06447475 substantially reduced the abundance of inclusions
in neurons expressing G2019S-LRRK2 by �55% (Fig. 5F). Treat-
ment with 3.0 nM of MLi-2 reduced the abundance of inclusions
in both nonTg and G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons by 75%–
80%. These data demonstrate that reduction of LRRK2 kinase
activity inhibits inclusion formation and rescues the phenotype
associated with G2019S-LRRK2 expression.
Enhanced inclusions in TH-positive neurons in the SNpc of
G2019S-LRRK2-expressing rats
Previously, we found that G2019S-LRRK2 BAC rats express high
levels of mutant LRRK2 in dopaminergic SNpc cells, whereas
littermate nonTg rats express very low or no LRRK2 in the SNpc
(West et al., 2014). Fibrils directly injected into the rat brain show
robust inclusions in SNpc neurons after as little as 30 d (Paumier
et al., 2015). To determine whether G2019S-LRRK2 expression in
rats could directly enhance inclusion formation in dopaminergic

 neurons, we injected fibrils into the right SNpc, and equivalent
concentrations of �-synuclein monomer control into the left
SNpc, of G2019S-LRRK2 BAC transgenic rats and littermate
nonTg controls. After 1 month, the same time course used for the
primary neuronal experiments, rats were perfused and immuno-
fluorescence for pS129-�-synuclein was performed. To examine
the subcellular distribution of �-synuclein inclusions within the
SNpc, we first performed triple labeling immunofluorescence for
TH to identify SNpc dopamine neurons, and NeuN to label all
neuronal nuclei. These results demonstrated that all of the pS129-�-
synuclein inclusions localized to dopaminergic neurons, in both
G2019S-LRRK2 BAC and nonTg controls (Fig. 6). To determine
whetherinclusionformationaffectedexpressionofTHaspreviously
shown (Paumier et al., 2015), we quantified fluorescent levels of TH
in SNpc neurons with and without inclusions in both nonTg and
G2019S-LRRK2-expressing rats. Levels of TH were not reduced, but
slightly higher, in inclusion-bearing neurons in both nonTg and
G2019S-LRRK2-expressing rats (Fig. 6E).
Although the G2019S-LRRK2 BAC rat does not show dopa-
minergic neurodegeneration or changes in TH expression in the
striatum due to the transgene expression (Daher et al., 2015), we
next sought to determine whether the fibril or monomer injec-
tion caused a loss of neurons in either G2019S-LRRK2 or nonTg
rats that might confound our analysis 1 month after injection. We
performed unbiased stereology of TH-positive neurons in the
SNpc and found a normal cell count in both nonTg and G2019S-
LRRK2-expressing rats. TH expression in the dorsal striatum was
also unchanged (Fig. 7C,D).
To determine whether the abundance of inclusions was higher
in SNpc neurons in G2019S-LRRK2 rats, we counted the number of

SNpc using unbiased stereology (Fig. 8). pS129-�-synuclein-
positive inclusions were never found in the contralateral monomer-
injected side (Fig. 8A,B). Higher-magnification images revealed
abundant neurite pS129-�-synuclein reactivity (Fig. 8C, arrows),
spherical pS129-�-synuclein-positive inclusions (Fig. 8C,D, asterisk
tag), and neurons with diffuse pS129-�-synuclein staining (Fig.
8C, � tag). Stereological counts through the entire SNpc demon-
strated that G2019S-LRRK2 BAC rats had double the number of
neurons with spherical pS129-�-synuclein inclusions compared
with littermate controls (Fig. 8E).
Discussion
In this study, we have made several novel observations. First,
using a robust model of �-synuclein pathology, G2019S-LRRK2
enhanced �-synuclein inclusions in primary hippocampal neu-
rons compared with neurons overexpressing WT-LRRK2. This
effect was apparent at 18 d after �-synuclein fibril exposure, but a
difference could not be detected earlier at 7 d after �-synuclein
fibril exposure when inclusions were more minimal. The effects
of G2019S-LRRK2 expression could be mitigated with nanomo-
lar concentrations of potent and selective LRRK2 kinase inhibi-
tors, suggesting that G2019S-LRRK2 kinase activity underlies
the acceleration of �-synuclein into pathologic inclusions. This
study demonstrates that a kinase inhibitor can impair pS129-�-
synuclein-positive inclusion pathology in primary neurons. We
demonstrated that G2019S-LRRK2 expression in vivo also en-
hanced �-synuclein inclusions in dopamine neurons of the SNpc,
which further supports a link between the G2019S LRRK2 muta-
tion and PD pathogenesis. Overall, our findings provide specific
evidence for a pathological interaction between G2019S-LRRK2
expression and �-synuclein.
We first explored the effects of G2019S-LRRK2 by using pri-
mary neuron cultures and found that G2019S-LRRK2 expression
increased �-synuclein inclusions, but only after extended time
points. These results imply that G2019S-LRRK2 expression may
not affect internalization of fibrils or the initial seeding reaction,
as these effects would be expected to be observed at the initial
time points when robust pS129-�-synuclein staining could be
measured. However, G2019S-LRRK2 did impact the accumula-
tion of �-synuclein into abnormal inclusions over time, with a
consistent increase in pS129-�-synuclein reactivity. This effect
resulted from expression of the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation and
not from overexpressing LRRK2 because similar levels of WT-
LRRK2 driven from the same BAC construct, but without the
G2019S mutation, did not drive increased pS129-�-synuclein-
positive inclusion formation.
Based on these observations, we speculate that G2019S-
LRRK2 may augment the process of �-synuclein inclusion for-
mation once the process is initiated. In potential support of our
observations, it has been reported that G2019S-LRRK2 expres-
sion enhances �-synuclein aggregation in mice that also condi-
tionally overexpress human A53T-�-synuclein (Lin et al., 2009;
Daher et al., 2012), although an important difference is that, in
the current study, G2019S-LRRK2 enhanced �-synuclein inclu-
sions in the context of endogenous wild-type �-synuclein expres-
sion. Another study demonstrated that increased levels of LRRK2

 were found in brain areas from postmortem PD tissue that had
abundant Lewy bodies, but not in brain regions without pathol-
ogy, and LRRK2 and �-synuclein could be coimmunoprecipi-
tated from these human brain lysates (Guerreiro et al., 2013).
Recent studies suggest that the reduced association of �-sy-
nucleinwithmembranesmaybeacriticalstepin�-synuclein-linked
pathogenesisthatpromotesinclusionformation(Burre
´ etal.,2015).
Because �-synuclein and LRRK2 can localize to similar mem-
brane compartments, such as synapse vesicles and endosomes
(Clayton and George, 1999; Biskup et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010;
Boassa et al., 2013; Schreij et al., 2015), we hypothesized that
G2019S-LRRK2 may affect the membrane association of �-sy-
nuclein to promote recruitment into inclusions. We chose
FRAP experiments to measure this process in intact neurons
because �-synuclein readily dissociates from membranes after
the lysis of cells or homogenization of brain tissue. FRAP im-
aging of intact neurons can detect transient membrane asso-
ciation of �-synuclein at the presynaptic terminal (Fortin et
al., 2005). FRAP experiments previously demonstrated that
the disease-associated A30P mutation in �-synuclein en-
hances mobility at the presynaptic terminal, likely because of a
reduced association with membranes (Fortin et al., 2005).
Here, we found that the pool of mobile cytoplasmic �-sy-
nuclein was higher in G2019S-LRRK2 compared with control
neurons. After fibril exposure, �-synuclein mobility was
largely immobilized in nonTg neurons after inclusion forma-
tion, similar to previous reports (Osterberg et al., 2015). How-
ever, in G2019S-LRRK2 neurons, �-synuclein mobility was
only reduced. Thus, a substantial pool of mobile �-synuclein
persisted in neurons expressing G2019S-LRRK2, and this is
the pool that is known to contribute directly to the develop-
ment of �-synuclein inclusions.
As we observed increased levels of mobile �-synuclein in
G2019S-LRRK2 neurons in primary culture, one possibility is
that the enhanced mobility results from increased levels of
�-synuclein in the cytosolic pool that do not form �-helical con-
formations (Dettmer et al., 2015b). Because neurons expressing
WT-LRRK2 show significantly reduced levels of �-synuclein, we
do not predict these neurons to have enhanced mobility of
�-synuclein, although future experiments are required to assess
this prediction. Increased levels of cytosolic �-synuclein may be
more susceptible to forming pS129-�-synuclein �-sheet struc-
tures. The mass-action hypothesis for neurodegenerative disease
supposes that modest upregulations in the expression of normal
protein sequences over time can lead to protein aggregation and
disease (Singleton et al., 2004). The discovery that multiplications

 of the SNCA gene drive aggressive PD phenotypes and patholo-
gies demonstrate increased �-synuclein expression can drive PD
susceptibility (Singleton et al., 2003). Here, we hypothesize that
the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation may contribute to PD susceptibil-
ity through enhancing mobile pools of �-synuclein in neurons.
We were able to rescue the phenotypes associated with
G2019S-LRRK2 expression in two ways. First, antisense oligonu-
cleotides that lowered levels of �-synuclein substantially reduced
fibril-induced inclusion formation, in both G2019S-LRRK2-
expressing neurons and nonTg control neurons. Second, we
were able to use two structurally distinct but near-equally potent
LRRK2 small-molecule inhibitors to block the enhanced inclu-
sion formation associated with G2019S-LRRK2 expression. Both
approaches have potential clinical application for novel neuro-
protection strategies in LRRK2-linked PD, and it will be impor-
tant to fully explore these opportunities in vivo and in other
preclinical models of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Although we have not resolved why G2019S-LRRK2 neurons
have increased �-synuclein mobility and expression, one po-
tential explanation may be related to G2019S-LRRK2-impaired
autophagy, specifically chaperone-mediated autophagy, and lys-
osomal clearance of mobile �-synuclein (Friedman et al., 2012;
Orenstein et al., 2013; Henry et al., 2015). LRRK2 may also di-
rectly affect �-synuclein synthesis rates (Martin et al., 2014). Re-
cently discovered Rab LRRK2 substrates, such as Rab10a that
G2019S-LRRK2, can phosphorylate and inactivate are attractive
candidates that may affect �-synuclein clearance mechanisms
(Steger et al., 2016). Alternatively or potentially in complement
to degradative mechanisms, G2019S-LRRK2 expression in
neurons may upregulate synaptic activity (Beccano-Kelly et al.,
2015), thereby upregulating �-synuclein and the potential for
�-synuclein in the mobile pool (Fortin et al., 2005). Future stud-
ies will be required to explore these possibilities and help shed
light on pathogenic mechanisms important for �-synuclein-
linked diseases and targets for intervention and neuroprotection.
