Summary
The WHO recommends complete withdrawal of oral polio vaccine (OPV) type 2 by April 2016
globally and replacing with at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). However,
high-cost, limited supply of IPV, persistent circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses transmission
and need for subsequent boosters remain unresolved. To meet this critical need, a novel strategy
of a low-cost cold chain-free plant-made viral protein 1 (VP1) subunit oral booster vaccine after
single IPV dose is reported. Codon optimization of the VP1 gene enhanced expression by 50-fold
in chloroplasts. Oral boosting of VP1 expressed in plant cells with plant-derived adjuvants after
single priming with IPV significantly increased VP1-IgG1 and VP1-IgA titres when compared to
lower IgG1 or negligible IgA titres with IPV injections. IgA plays a pivotal role in polio eradication
because of its transmission through contaminated water or sewer systems. Neutralizing antibody
titres (~3.17–10.17 log2 titre) and seropositivity (70–90%) against all three poliovirus Sabin
serotypes were observed with two doses of IPV and plant-cell oral boosters but single dose of IPV
resulted in poor neutralization. Lyophilized plant cells expressing VP1 stored at ambient
temperature maintained efficacy and preserved antigen folding/assembly indefinitely, thereby
eliminating cold chain currently required for all vaccines. Replacement of OPV with this booster
vaccine and the next steps in clinical translation of FDA-approved antigens and adjuvants are
discussed.
Introduction
Despite their success, live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)
and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) have a number of
shortcomings making them less than optimal for their use in
posteradication environment (Mueller et al., 2005; Racaniello,
2011). Sabin strains used in OPV can revert to virulence by point
mutations or recombination with other enteroviruses (Burns
et al., 2014; Runckel et al., 2013), while IPV is expensive, does
not induce adequate mucosal immunity (Onorato et al., 1991),
requires cold storage/transportation and intramuscular injections.
Genetic instability of Sabin strains was observed several decades
ago among cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in
recipients of OPV in the USA and their close contacts (Alexander
et al., 2004; Schonberger et al., 1976). Outbreak in Haiti and
Dominican Republic (Kew et al., 2002) a decade ago led to the
discovery of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) that
caused numerous outbreaks of all three serotypes (Diop et al.,
2015; Lakhani and Bumb, 2014). Immunocompromised patients
can be chronically infected with poliovirus following vaccination
with OPV (Sutter and Prevots, 1994) and continue to excrete
virulent poliovirus for years and even decades (Dunn et al.,
2015). The inevitability with which virulent VDPV emerge led
WHO to propose complete withdrawal of OPV after the
circulation of wild polioviruses has been stopped, and to replace
it with the global use of IPV to prevent re-emergence of
poliovirus by maintaining adequate population immunity (Bhasin,
2008).
This posteradication scenario is complicated by several factors
linked to the properties of IPV. Even though persons immunized
with IPV are completely protected against paralysis, they could be
infected with poliovirus and transmit it to their contacts.
Additionally, poliovirus can live in an infected person’s faeces
for many weeks and can also contaminate food and water in
unsanitary conditions. Therefore, virulent polioviruses can silently
circulate in communities immunized with IPV (Shulman et al.,
2014). While mucosal immunity caused by OPV is significantly
more effective, it rapidly wanes, but can be boosted by either
OPV or IPV (Duintjer Tebbens et al., 2013). The cost and limited
supply of IPV has led Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)
to propose that only one dose of IPV can be used in some
countries to prime population immunity, even though one dose
of IPV does result in complete seroconversion. This suggests that
there is a need for booster vaccine that could be used in
previously immunized individuals to induce anamnestic response
and stimulate mucosal immunity. Poliovirus is an intestinal virus
transmitted from person to person through the mouth and it
multiplies in the intestine. The intestinal mucosal surface plays a
pivotal role during poliovirus infection. Thus, building up a
localized pathogen-specific mucosal immune response is impor-
tant as the antibodies generated can neutralize the virus before it
can cause infection (Shakya et al., 2016).

 Plant-derived subunit vaccines are heat-stable and are free
from contamination with animal pathogens. They can also be
engineered to contain multiple antigens and transmucosal
carriers, to protect against multiple infectious diseases (Albar-
rac�
ın et al., 2015; Chan and Daniell, 2015). Upon oral delivery,
protein drugs expressed in plant cells are protected from acids
and enzymes in the stomach by the plant cell wall; when fused
with the transmucosal carrier protein drugs released in the gut
lumen are efficiently delivered to the circulatory or immune
system (Arlen et al., 2008; Belyakov and Ahlers, 2009; Davoodi-
Semiromi et al., 2010; Kohli et al., 2014; Shenoy et al., 2014;
Sherman et al., 2014; Shil et al., 2014; Su et al., 2015). Such
mechanistic and conceptual advances could revolutionize vac-
cine delivery by eliminating the cost of complex production
systems, such as fermentation, purification, cold storage and
transportation (Jin and Daniell, 2015; Kwon et al., 2013).
Although
potato-derived
HBsAg
expressed
via
the
nuclear
genome was tested in preclinical and in human clinical trials
a decade ago (Kong et al., 2001; Thanavala et al., 2005),
progress in advancing to later stages is slow. Two major
challenges are the low levels of expression of antigens via the
nuclear genome and the potential to induce tolerance without
injectable
priming
of
antigens
with
adjuvants
(Chan
and
Daniell,
2015;
Rybicki,
2014).
Both
these
concerns
are
addressed in chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens (Chan and
Daniell, 2015; L€
ossl and Waheed, 2011).
In order to address inadequacies of the current polio vaccines,
including insufficient vaccine efficacy in some populations,
instability and reversion to neurovirulence, shedding of circulating
VDPV, and the high cost and inadequate mucosal immunity of
IPV, a low-cost booster vaccine has been developed in this study
using polio viral antigen expressed in chloroplasts. The strategy of
using a plant-made VP1 subunit vaccine for an oral booster rather
than repeated OPV vaccination is a novel approach to achieve the
goal of global
poliovirus (PV) eradication. In this study, we
provide evidence that oral boosting with chloroplast-derived VP1
together with plant-made adjuvants (saponin and squalene)
induces strong immune responses that confer protective immu-
nity against different PV serotypes.
Results
VP1 chloroplast vectors
Poliovirus capsid viral protein 1 (VP1) is one of the poliovirus
structural proteins and could serve as an ideal vaccine candidate.
Therefore, two VP1 proteins (native and codon optimized) derived
from Sabin 1 coding sequences fused with the transmucosal carrier
CTB were expressed in tobacco and lettuce chloroplasts. Of the 302
amino acids in this protein, 187 codons were optimized by
changing the codon usage frequency to resemble that of the
chloroplast psbA gene (the most highly translated chloroplast
gene). Rare codons were replaced with optimal codons for
transgene expression in chloroplasts and the AT content of the
optimized VP1 gene increased from 51.98% to 59.03%. Both CTB-
VP1 fusion genes were constructed with a GPGP (Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro)
hinge region to minimize steric hindrance of the fused VP1, as well
as a furin cleavage site, RRKRSV (Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser-Val) (Fig-
ure 1a). Both fusion genes were driven by the psbA promoter and
5’-untranslated region (UTR) to increase expression, and the
transcript was stabilized by the psbA 3’-UTR.
Integration of VP1 into tobacco plastomes
CTB-VP1 transplastomic tobacco lines were confirmed by PCR
analysis with primer sets 3P/3M and 5P/2M. Targeted integration
and homoplasmy of the CTB-VP1 gene were further evaluated by
Southern blot probed with the trnI and trnA flanking sequence.
All independent transplastomic tobacco lines showed distinct
hybridization fragments with the correct size, but not the 4.4-kb
fragment from wild type in the AflIII-digested total DNA blot
(Figure 1a,b). Thus, Southern blot analysis confirmed the site-
specific stable integration of the transgenes into the chloroplast
genome and homoplasmy.
Folding, stability and CTB-VP1 pentamer assembly in
lyophilized tobacco leaves
CTB-VP1 accumulation in transplastomic plants was quantified by
Western blot analysis. Intensities of CTB-VP1 polypeptides in
native and codon-optimized plants were compared with known

 amounts of CTB standard. The codon-optimized VP1 sequence
(2600 lg/g dry weight) increased expression by 50-fold when
compared with the native VP1 gene product (54 lg/g DW,
Figure 2a). Native and codon-optimized CTB-VP1 reached up to
0.1% and 4–5% of the total leaf protein, respectively. As shown
in Figure 2b, the monomer CTB-VP1 fusion protein with the
correct molecular mass of 44 kDa was detected with anti-CTB or
VP1 antibody. CTB-VP1 antigen increased further ~20-fold in
lyophilized cells when compared with frozen leaf samples
(Figure 2c). The intact monomer band of CTB-VP1 fusion proteins
was observed without any detectable degradation of CTB-VP1 in
all tested lyophilized samples after storage for 4 and 8 months at
ambient
temperature
(Figure 2d).
Formation
of
pentameric
structures of the CTB-VP1 expressed in chloroplasts was evalu-
ated using GM1 binding ELISAs. As shown in Figure 2e, both
native and codon-optimized fresh and lyophilized CTB-VP1 from
tobacco showed comparable absorbance to CTB (positive con-
trol). This indicates that CTB-VP1 fusion protein expressed in both
fresh and lyophilized chloroplasts formed proper pentameric
structures that could bind the GM1-ganglioside receptor, which is
a requirement for oral protein drug delivery. The stability of VP1,
efficacy of binding to GM1-ganglioside receptor, proper folding
and pentamer assembly were maintained after lyophilization and
prolonged storage for 8 months at ambient temperature (Fig-
ure 2d,e).
Evaluation of antibody responses to VP1
The objective of this study was to determine whether lyophilized
CTB-VP1 protein formulated with plant-derived adjuvants (sapo-
nin and/or squalene) approved by FDA could induce specific
antibody immunogenicity and neutralize different poliovirus
serotypes. We investigated the impact of adjuvants (squalene
and saponin) using plant cells expressing low level of VP1 (native
gene) as we anticipated that higher antigen dose might mask the
adjuvant effect. Most importantly, we could use similar weight of
plant cells but with ~50-fold lower antigen dosage, thereby

 eliminating potential impact of naturally present adjuvants in
plant cells. Mice boosted with native (1.08 lg VP1 per dose,
group 6) or codon-optimized tobacco-derived CTB-VP1 (52 lg
VP1 per dose, group 9) with both adjuvants had anti-VP1 IgG1
mean antibody titres of 6080 or 7840 on 57th, 4640 or 9760
87th 4640 or 8640 117th days. In contrast, two doses of IPV
(group 2) resulted in 3520, 2160 or 1980 VP1 titres when
compared to a single dose (group 3) of IPV (2960, 920 or 1240,
Figure 3b–d). Therefore, VP1-IgG1 titres reached highest levels in
the first month and did not increase after subsequent oral
boosters (Figure 3a–d). However, VP1-IgG1 titres in IPV single or
two doses declined after the first month. Similarly, serum VP1-IgA
titres increased after oral boosting in the first month (group 6:
336, 344, 264 or 224; group 9: 480, 552, 400, 480) and did not
increase significantly after subsequent boosting (Figure 3e–h). In
sharp contrast, IPV single or double doses did not increase IgA
titres, confirming limitation of systemic vaccine delivery. To
investigate mucosal immune response, we measured VP1 specific
from faecal extracts (Figure 4a). The highest VP1-IgA titres were
showed in groups of mice (groups 6, 9 and 10) orally boosted
with native or codon-optimized VP1 formulation. These results
show that oral boosting with plant cells expressing CTB-VP1 can
induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses whereas
IPV single or double dose developed lower levels of IgG1 and
negligible IgA titres. Because both the native and codon-
optimized VP1 are fused with CTB, we also measured specific
CTB-IgG1 antibody titres in serum and faecal extracts. Most of the
groups showed negligible titres (50–150) in serum (Figure 5) and
faecal extracts (Figure 4b), well below the standard deviation of
VP1-IgG1 titres and are therefore considered negligible.

4–6) or codon-optimized VP1 antigen with plant-derived adju-
vants (groups 7–9), as well as two doses of IPV (group 2) or single
IPV dose (group 3) – induced different levels of neutralizing titres
against all three Sabin strain serotypes. Results show that oral
boosting with codon-optimized VP1 (group 9) induced signifi-
cantly higher Sabin 1-, Sabin 2- and Sabin 3-neutralizing
antibodies (range ~3.17–10.17, ~3.17–9.5 and ~3.5–10.5 log2
titres), similar to the group of mice that received two doses of IPV
(group 2) (range ~3.17–6.17, ~3.5–10.5 and ~3.17–9.17 log2
titres) (Figure 6a–c), but were significantly higher than those in
mice with a single dose of IPV only (group 3) (range ~3.83,
~3.17–4.5 and ~2.5–6.8). However, no neutralizing antibodies
were detected in sera from mice that were only orally boosted
without IPV priming (group 10). Mice boosted with the native VP1
(group 6) had significantly lower Sabin 1-neutralizing antibodies
titres (range ~3.17–9.17) than mice boosted with codon-
optimized VP1 antigen (group 9) (~3.17–10.17) (P < 0.01).
However, mice boosted with native VP1 antigen formulation
(group 6) showed significantly higher Sabin 2 and Sabin
3-neutralizing antibodies titres than mice that received a single
dose of IPV (group 3): (~3.5–6.83 and ~3.17–10.17 vs ~3.17–4.5
and ~2.5–6.8). Clearly, poliovirus neutralization studies show that
only groups 2, 6 and 9 offer optimal protection against all three
poliovirus serotypes. With the exception of group 6 in Sabin
serotype 1, all three groups against all three serotypes provide
statistically similar results.
To determine the seropositivity rate of poliovirus-neutralizing
antibodies, for each Sabin strain, the number of mice with
seroprevalence (neutralizing antibody log2 (titre) ≥3) was com-
pared with the total number of mice in each group. Mice
receiving two doses of IPV (group 2) or orally boosted with
codon-optimized
VP1
antigen
with
saponin
and
squalene
adjuvants (group 9) showed highest seropositivity for poliovirus
Sabin 1-, 2- and 3-neutralizing antibodies (Figure 6d,f). Seropos-
itivity rate varied between 70% and 90% for two doses of IPV
versus oral boosting with VP1. These results show that codon-
optimized VP1 antigen with plant-derived adjuvants has the
greatest seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibodies (Figure 6d–f)
and virus-neutralizing titres (log2 titre ~3.17–10.17) against all
Sabin 1, 2 and 3 strains (Figure 6a–c).
Discussion
September 2015 declaration of global eradication of type 2
poliovirus has led WHO SAGE to recommend the withdrawal of
OPV2 from routine immunization programs in all countries, with
concurrent introduction of at least one dose of IPV (the global
polio eradication initiative (GPEI), 2015). However, multiple risks
still remain in preparation for the global introduction of IPV and
the upcoming switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV,
including limited IPV supply, persistent cVDPV transmission and
challenges of poliovirus containment (GPEI Polio Eradication &
Endgame Midterm Review, 2015). Most importantly, there is no
booster technology available except IPV which is not affordable
for many resource-limited countries. After type 1 and type 3
polioviruses are eradicated, the routine use of OPV vaccination
will be discontinued and replaced with global use of IPV. This
transition is essential for maintaining high levels of population
immunity to protect against the emergence of VDPV and future
outbreaks. This underscores the need for development of a new
generation of low-cost polio vaccines because the current cost of
IPV is too high for most developing countries (Verdijk et al.,
2014). Although one should be cautious in extrapolation of
results from rodent to human clinical applications, poor seropro-
tectivity and poliovirus neutralization obtained with a single dose
of IPV reported in this study offer caution on the use of IPV
without further boosting.
Cold chain-free polio booster vaccine
Expression of VP1 in chloroplasts and bioencapsulation in plant
cells can protect antigens from the digestive system upon oral
delivery and facilitates their release into the immune system in the
gut by commensal microbes (Davoodi-Semiromi et al., 2010;
Limaye et al., 2006). CTB-antigen fusions facilitate transmucosal
delivery to the immune system via the GM1 intestinal epithelial
receptor (Verma et al., 2010). Production of green vaccines
against infectious diseases with ease of oral administration that
does not require a cold chain is an important need, especially in
areas with limited access to cold storage and transportation
(Davoodi-Semiromi et al., 2010). VP1 is also highly stable in
lyophilized plant cells when stored at ambient temperature for
several months, facilitating a cold chain-free vaccine delivery
system. Most importantly, lyophilization of plant cells maintains

assembly after prolonged storage at room temperature.
Number of required oral boosters and formulations
Antigen-specific IgG1 and IgA were significantly induced after
few oral boosters which generated high levels of systemic and
mucosal immunity. Both VP1-IgG1 and VP1-IgA titres reached
highest levels after the first month of oral boosting and did not
increase further with more boosters. Although neutralization
data from later stage sera collection are provided here, previous
batches evaluated for Sabin serotype 1 neutralization showed
similar results in groups boosted with plant cells expressing VP1.
Therefore, only one or two boosters of VP1 bioencapsulated in
plant cells may be required. However, multiple boosters are now
used for several vaccines. Current anthrax vaccine requires eight
boosters (Lynch et al., 2014). Several doses of oral polio vaccine
(as many as fifteen) were administered in outbreak areas in India
(Lakhani and Bumb, 2014), but unfortunately, there were
several cases of vaccine induced polio (Bhasin, 2008). To
determine minimal number of boosts further experiments are
required, although low cost and easy storage make the number
of boosts less important than current vaccines that require cold
storage and transportation. In this study, plant cells were
suspended
in
phosphate-buffered
saline
(PBS)
before
oral
delivery but for delivery to children, suitable formulation with
sugar syrup may be required. In this context, it should be added
that oral delivery of lyophilized carrot cells expressing gluco-
cerebrosidase, suspended in orange juice entered into Phase I/II
clinical studies conducted by Protalix BioTherapeutics (Shaaltiel
et al., 2015). Future studies should focus on expression of VP1
antigen in an edible plant suitable for oral delivery; several
vaccine antigens and biopharmaceuticals have been expressed in
lettuce chloroplasts (Daniell et al., 2016a,b; Jin and Daniell,
2015; Kanagaraj et al., 2011; Lakshmi et al., 2013; Ruhlman
et al., 2007, 2010).
Although IPV is highly effective in inducing systemic antibodies
to protect against paralytic disease, it is less efficient in inducing
the mucosal immunity that is needed to prevent re-infection and
excretion of polioviruses into the environment especially in
developing countries. Our results confirmed that in mice with
single or two doses of IPV induced only minimal IgA titres,
explaining the inadequate mucosal immunity of IPV. Mice primed
with IPV and orally boosted with bioencapsulated VP1 elicited
stronger antigen-specific serum IgG1 and IgA titres in blood and
faecal extracts, confirming that oral delivery of VP1 antigen with
plant-derived adjuvants generated both systemic and mucosal
immune responses. Further, poliovirus infects the throat and
intestines after contact with an infected person. As poliovirus
invades via mucosal surfaces, localized pathogen-specific mucosal
immune responses are truly important because pathogen-specific
antibodies can neutralize pathogens before they can cause
infection (Shakya et al., 2016). Thus, instead of repeatedly
boosting with IPV, oral boosting with subunit VP1 formulation
has the potential for development of a practical and efficient
subunit poliovirus vaccine.
Impact of antigen dosage
In this study, we evaluated both native and codon-optimized VP1
antigens expressed in chloroplasts. The level of VP1 protein was
50-fold higher in plants expressing codon-optimized VP1 (Fig-
ure 2). Our in vivo study also showed that vaccination with

 codon-optimized VP1 induced significantly higher IgG1 and IgA
antibody responses than the native VP1 gene, indicating that the
higher antigen doses increase efficacy of oral immunization.
Because we gave 20 mg of lyophilized plant cells for mice
weighing 20–25 g, it is easy to deliver adequate dose to children.
In this context, our recent success in producing antigens in a
commercial cGMP facility should help in advancing this concept
to the clinic (Su et al., 2015).

Quillaia extract (Type 1) contains over 100 plant-derived triter-
penoid saponins (20–26%) and has been approved as Substances
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by FDA (Agency Response
Letter GRAS Notice No. GRN 000165). Squalene is a substance
naturally found in the human body, as well as in animals and plants
and has been used as an adjuvant in FDA-licensed AS03-

Influenza
A
(H5N1)
virus
monovalent
vaccine
(GlaxoSmithKline)
and
MF59-adjuvanted
influenza
vaccine
(Fluad
TM) (Novartis). Therefore, antigens and adjuvants used in this
study have been previously or currently used in the clinic.
Recombinant CTB is approved as a component of an internation-
ally licensed oral cholera vaccine Dukoral� and is used in the clinic
for a decade (Hill et al., 2006). Furthermore, oral administration of
rCTB significantly decreased inflammation in mild to moderately
active Crohn’s disease in human clinical trials (St�
al et al., 2010).
Oral delivery of rCTB chemically cross-linked to a peptide from the
human 60-kD heat shock protein mitigated uveitis of Behcet’s
disease in a Phase I/II clinical trials (Stanford et al., 2004).
Modelling of VP1 3-D structure shows that the key epitopes
appear on the protein surface, demonstrating the suitability of
this structure to generate antibodies suitable for neutralization
(Liu et al., 2011). Neutralizing antibody levels at a titre above the
1 : 8 dilution [3 log2(titre)] threshold are accepted by all national
regulatory agencies as having a good correlation with protection
when reviewing licence applications for IPV-containing vaccines
(Plotkin, 2010; Verdijk et al., 2014). As expected, virus-neutraliz-
ing titres induced by two IPV doses were high for all Sabin strains.
In our study, priming with IPV and orally boosting with bioen-
capsulated
VP1 with plant-derived
adjuvants
(saponin and
squalene) showed the highest seropositivity and virus-neutralizing
titres (range 3.17–10.17 log2 titre) against all Sabin 1, 2, 3 strains.
Although mice that were only boosted with VP1 plus two
adjuvants but not primed (group 10) showed the strong VP1-
specific antibody (IgG1 and IgA) production, no neutralizing virus
titres were observed in this group when compared to the mice
that were primed with IPV. Thus, only oral boosting with subunit
vaccination appears to be insufficient to induce a good neutral-
izing antibody response to the antigen. Compared to VP1-specific
antibody (IgG1 and IgA), CTB-specific IgG1 and IgA titres were
negligible because mice were not primed with CTB. These results
demonstrate that oral priming is essential to induce adequate
immunity against pathogens. Unfortunately, most articles on the
plant-made vaccine literature report antibody titres but not results
on pathogen or toxin challenge, leading to misleading conclu-
sions on the requirement of priming (Chan and Daniell, 2015;
Per�
ez Aguirreburualde et al., 2013).
Need for other booster vaccines for the elderly
population
Although this study focuses on polio booster vaccine, there is a
greater need to boost immunity as life expectancy is on the rise.
Loss of immunity against infectious diseases among elderly
population is a growing concern. For example, shingles occur
when latent chickenpox virus is reactivated when ageing weakens
the immune system and this is rarely observed due to new viral
infections. Therefore, to enhance immunity against a number of
infectious diseases among elderly population, low-cost oral
booster vaccines could serve as a novel concept.
In conclusion, virus and cold chain-free vaccines are not
currently
available
for
any
infectious
disease.
Therefore,
production and oral delivery of vaccines using transplastomic
technology should facilitate the development of low-cost cold
chain- and virus-free booster vaccines. Here, we show a low-cost
booster vaccine using bioencapsulated polio antigens as an
alternative strategy to avoid repeated OPV vaccinations for global
poliovirus eradication and prevention of polio outbreaks in
endemic areas.
Experimental procedures
VP1 chloroplast vector construction and regeneration of
transplastomic plants
The native VP1 gene (906 bp) of Sabin 1 poliovirus (Genbank
accession number AY184219) was amplified using forward
primer 5’-gggCCCgggCCCCggCgTAAACgCTCTgTTgggTTAggT-
CAgATg-3’ and reverse primer 5’-CgATCTAgATCAATATgTggT-
CAgATC-3’.
The
PCR-amplified
fragment
and
the
codon-
optimized VP1 gene (synthesized by GenScript, Piscataway, NJ)
were cloned into tobacco and lettuce chloroplast transformation
vectors. Biolistic delivery of chloroplast transformation vectors
and regeneration of transplastomic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum
cv. Petit Havana) lines were performed as previously described
(Verma et al., 2008).
Characterization of transplastomic tobacco and lettuce
lines
To confirm transgene cassette integration into the tobacco
chloroplast genome, PCR was performed using primer pairs 3P/
3M and 5P/2M (Verma et al., 2008). Southern blot analysis was
performed to confirm transgene integration and homoplasmy as
previously described (Verma et al., 2008).
Lyophilization of CTB-VP1 transplastomic tobacco leaves
Frozen CTB-VP1 tobacco leaves were transported to a lyophilizer
(Genesis 35XL, SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY) on dry ice and
lyophilized at �40, �30, �20, �15, �10, �5 and 25 °C for a
total of 72 h under a 400 mTorr vacuum. Lyophilized leaf
materials were ground in a coffee grinder (Hamilton Beach,
Southern Pines, NC) three times at maximum speed (pulse on
10 s and off 30 s). The fine powder was stored with silica gel in a
moisture-free environment at room temperature.
Immunoblot analysis and purification of chloroplast-
derived proteins
Immunoblot analysis and quantitation of CTB-VP1 fusion proteins
were performed according to previously published methods
(Davoodi-Semiromi et al., 2010). The densitometry assay for
quantification of CTB-VP1 was carried out using known amount
monomeric form (11.5 kDa) CTB standard (Sigma, St Louis, MO)
and the monomer of the fusion protein. To detect CTB-VP1-fused
proteins, blots were incubated with 1 : 10 000 rabbit anti-CTB
polyclonal antibody (GeneWay, San Diego, CA) or 1 : 1000 rabbit
anti-VP1 polyclonal antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc., San
Antonio, TX) followed by 1 : 4000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP as
secondary antibody (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). CTB and
recombinant Sabin 1 VP1 (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc.) were used
as positive controls. To purify chloroplast-derived CTB-VP1 fusion
proteins, His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech Laboratories,
Mountain View, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Eluted fractions were dialysed three times with sterile
PBS, aliquoted and stored at �20 °C. Purified chloroplast-derived
CTB-VP1 was used for immunoglobulin measurements.

 Cholera toxin B-GM1-ganglioside receptor binding assay
To test the ability of the tobacco chloroplast-derived CTB-VP1 to
form pentamers and bind to the GM1-ganglioside receptor, a
CTB–GM1 binding assay was performed as described (Davoodi-
Semiromi et al., 2010).
Mice and immunization schedule
Female CD-1 mice aged 6–7 weeks were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in
microisolator cages. Experiments were conducted in accordance
with guidelines of the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were randomly divided
into nine groups of 10 mice per group. Group 1 was a control
group in which mice were untreated. All mice from groups 2
through 8 were subcutaneously (s.c.) primed with 100 lL of IPV
suspension of three types of poliovirus [40 : 8 : 32 D antigen
unit of type 1 (Mahoney), type 2 (MEF-1) and type 3 (Saukett)
(IPOL, Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA)]. Group 2 mice were s.c.
boosted with the same IPV 30 days after priming. Group 3 mice
were only s.c. primed with IPV. Mice in groups 4 through 10
were orally boosted with lyophilized plant material: mice in
groups 4–9 were boosted once a week for eight consecutive
weeks starting 1 week after priming. Mice in groups 4 through
6 were orally boosted with lyophilized native CTB-VP1-expres-
sing tobacco leaves; each mouse was boosted with 20 mg of
material in 200 lL of PBS plus different adjuvants: saponin
(Saponin from quilaja bark, Sigma) (group 4), squalene (Sigma)
(group 5) or both (group 6). Mice in groups 7 through 10
were orally boosted with lyophilized codon-optimized CTB-
VP1-expressing tobacco leaves; each mouse was boosted with
20 mg of material in 200 lL of PBS plus different adjuvants:
saponin (group 6), squalene (group 7) or both (groups 9 and
10). Blood was collected 1 day prior to priming and 10 days
after boosting. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C
for 30 min to destroy complement activity. In the third month
after oral boosting with CTB-VP1 formulations, faecal pellets
were collected at day 10 after vaccination.
Preparation of vaccine formulations of bioencapsulated,
plant-made CTB-VP1
Vaccine formulation was generally performed as previously
described (Domingos et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2015) but with
modifications. Primary emulsion in the aqueous phase was made
by mixing 0.05% Tween-80 in PBS with 20 mg of lyophilized VP1
tobacco plant material (with 2 mg saponin or not) and followed
by mixture with the oil phase of squalene (80% v/v squalene,
20% v/v Span-80).
Determination of antibody response by ELISA
Immunological responses, including serum and faecal extract
levels of VP1-specific IgG1, IgA and CTB-specific IgG1, IgA titres,
were assayed by direct ELISA as previously described (Davoodi-
Semiromi et al., 2010). Blood was collected 1 day prior to
priming and 10 days after boosting. Faecal pellets were collected
in the third month after oral boosting. As described previ-
ously (Kraynyak et al., 2010), all faecal pellets were weighed and
2 mL/g of 0.01% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide solution containing
protease inhibitor was added. After vigorous vortexing (~20 min),
samples were centrifuged at 135 g for 20 min. The supernatant
was transferred to a clean tube for further centrifugation (1600
g, 30 min). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at �80 °C.
Briefly, for measuring VP1-IgG1 and VP1-IgA antibody titres,
10 lg/mL purified CTB-VP1 proteins was used for coating 96-well
Maxisorp ELISA plate (Nunc) overnight at 4 °C. For measuring
CTB- IgG1 and CTB-IgA antibody titres, commercial source
cholera toxin B subunit (1 lg/mL) (Sigma) was used for coating
96-well ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with
1% BSA (Sigma 7906) in PBS with 0.05% Tween. Twofold
dilution of heat-inactivated individual mice sera samples (start at
1 : 400 dilution for VP1-IgG1, 1 : 50 dilution for VP1-IgA and
CTB-IgG1) or faecal pellet extracts (start at 1 : 5 for both VP1-IgA
and CTB-IgA) were incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by HRP-
conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 (1 : 1000) (BD) or HRP-con-
jugated goat anti-mouse IgA (1 : 5000) (American Qualex, San
Clemente, CA) diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at 37 °C
for 1 h followed by colour development with TMB substrate for
10 min at RT. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 lL of 2N
sulphuric acid per well, and absorbance was measured using an
ELISA reader at 450 nm. Antibody titres are defined as the
reciprocal of the highest dilution above the cut-off, which was
three times the mean background (Frey et al., 1998). All sera
samples and faecal pellet extracts were tested in triplicate. Results
are shown as individual antibody titre � SEM.
Poliovirus Sabin 1, 2, 3 neutralization assay
Animals were orally boosted with native or codon-optimized CTB-
VP1 proteins adjuvanted with saponin and/or squalene or, for
group 2 and group 3, both priming and boosting with the IPV or
priming with IPV only. Ten days after the last oral boost (day 117
of the experiment), serum samples were collected and saved at
�80 °C for further neutralization assays at Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) as previously described (Verdijk
et al., 2014; WHO, 1991, 1997). Briefly, sera samples were tested
in triplicate with the use of modified microneutralization assays
for antibodies to Sabin strains type 1, 2 and 3. Serum samples
from control and experimental groups were tested randomly and
blindly. The serum dilution of a reciprocal titre at which no virus
neutralization was detected was recorded as the log2 (titre) of
2.5, or negative; a log2 titre of ≥3 was considered protective.
Individual titres for each mouse are plotted, and the bar
represents mean neutralizing titre � SEM.
Statistical analysis
All data are reported for individual mice, and mean � SEM is
given for each group. Analyses for statistically significant differ-
ences in antibody titres between groups were performed using
One-way ANOVA and t-test (GraphPad Prism version 6) and P
values <0.05 were considered significant.
