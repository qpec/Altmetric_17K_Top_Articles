ABSTRACT
Background To assess the relationship between sport
and osteoarthritis (OA), and specifically to determine
whether previous participation, in terms of level (elite or
non-elite), type of sport, intensity or previous injury, was
associated with OA.
Methods This systematic review was developed using
PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched (to May
2016). Narrative review and meta-analysis (with risk ratio
(RR) and 95% CIs) approaches were undertaken where
appropriate. Study quality was assessed using GRADE.
Results 46 studies were included. Narratively, 31 studies
reported an increased risk of OA, with 19 demonstrating
an increased risk in elite athletes. There was an increased
risk after sports exposure (irrespective of type; RR 1.37;
95% CI 1.14 to 1.64; 21 studies). It remained uncertain
whether there was a difference in risk of OA between
elite and non-elite athletes (RR 1.37; 95% CI 0.84 to
2.22; 17 studies). The risk was higher in soccer (RR 1.42;
95% CI 1.14 to 1.77; 15 studies) but lower in runners
(RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.41; 12 studies). 9 studies
showed an association with the intensity of sport
undertaken and OA. 5 studies demonstrated a higher
prevalence of OA following meniscectomies and anterior
cruciate ligament tears. Overall, the evidence was of
GRADE ‘very low’ quality.
Conclusions There was very low-quality evidence to
support an increased relationship between sports
participation and OA in elite participants. It is unclear
whether there is a difference in risk between elite and
non-elite participants with further prospective studies
needed to evaluate this. Pooled findings suggested that
significant injuries were associated with OA in soccer
players.
INTRODUCTION
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of
the synovial joints seen in adults and contributes to
a substantial usage of health service resources.1
There are multiple risk factors that are implicated
in OA including obesity, occupation, muscle weak-
ness, previous injury, nutrition, hormonal factors
and potentially sports participation.1 Sports partici-
pation has been shown to have numerous health
benefits
by
improving
metabolic
health,
bone
density, depression, obesity and delaying the onset
of chronic diseases.2
3 However, its relationship
with OA is not fully understood. Given that effect-
ive OA therapies are limited, determining the rela-
tionship between sports participation and OA is
important as it potentially provides a population
where interventions may prevent subsequent OA.
There have been several narrative reviews investi-
gating sporting activities and their relationship with
OA, with conflicting conclusions.4–7 For example,
Östör et al6 determined that elite level running
increased the risk of OA, although there was no
associated risk in recreational runners. Similarly,
Conaghan5 and Lequesne et al7 argued that elite
sports participation may increase the risk of OA,
and that the risk for runners in particular may be
dependent on the rate of miles run. In contrast,
Cymet and Sinkov4 concluded that there was no
increased risk of knee or hip OA in runners.
A systematic review in 2003 demonstrated mod-
erate evidence that sporting activity was associated
with hip OA, although OA in other joints was not
explored.8 In a review of OA and physical activity,
Vignon et al9 found sport to be a risk factor for
knee and hip OA, with increased risk associated
with both intensity (including duration) of sports
participation. These systematic reviews, however,
did not investigate individual sports, and nor did
the authors investigate other joints except the knee
or hips, or the role of previous sporting injuries.
Furthermore, there has been no systematic review
exploring the relationship between OA and elite
sport compared with non-elite sport.
This systematic review aims to examine the rela-
tionship between OA and the top 32 most popular
English sports by participation,10 which represents
the majority of the 1.7 million adults who partici-
pated in sports. It specifically aims to examine if
there is a relationship between previous participa-
tion in sports, the level of sports participated in (ie,
elite and non-elite sports participation), the inten-
sity of sport and whether previous injury associated
with sport is related to OA.
METHODS
Search strategy
The
electronic
databases,
AMED,
CINAHL,
MEDLINE,
EMBASE
and
SPORTDiscus,
were
searched for articles pertaining to the relationship of
sports participation and OA. Grey literature and
unpublished research and trial registries were also
searched. These included the WHO International
Clinical T
rials Registry Platform, Current Controlled
T
rials, the US National Institute of Health T
rials
Registry and OpenGrey (System for Information on
Grey Literature in Europe). Searches were performed

Boolean operators adopted are presented in box 1. These were
modified for each individual database.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies assessing any relationship between sports and OA were
included. Sport was defined as physical activity which is in a
competitive environment where rules are adhered to.11 This is
different from physical activity which was defined as any muscu-
loskeletal force that results in energy expenditure. ‘Exercise’ was
defined as planned bouts of physical activity that is structured
and for health benefits. Searches were restricted to the top 32
sports based on results from the Active People Survey10 in
2013, which provides comprehensive annual statistics on sports
participation in England. Only studies which described sports
participation were included. Only studies published in English
were included. Participants of any age were included in the
study. Studies which did not clearly document the diagnosis of
OA were excluded. Animal studies were excluded. Review arti-
cles,
case
reports,
editorials,
letters
and
comments
were
excluded.
Study selection
Searches were performed by three reviewers (GT
, AG, TOS).
Titles and abstracts from each search result were independently
reviewed by the same reviewers against predefined eligibility cri-
teria. Full texts of papers considered as potentially eligible were
reviewed independently by the same three reviewers against the
eligibility criteria. Studies which met these criteria on full-paper
assessment were included in the final review.
Data extraction and analysis of quality
Data were extracted using a standardised database based on pre-
vious
systematic
reviews.12–15
Data
were
independently
extracted by two reviewers (GT
, AG). Any disagreement in data
extraction
was
managed
through
discussion
between
the
reviewers. If consensus could not be reached, a decision was
made by a third reviewer (SRK).The Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement
checklist and four-phase flow diagram was used to enhance the
reporting of this systematic review.
Data extracted included level performed; type of sport partici-
pated in; demographics (age, sex, body mass index); sample size;
follow-up period; anatomical joints assessed; diagnosis of OA
and prevalence of OA. Sports participants were categorised into
elite and non-elite categories. The definition of ‘elite’ was sub-
jective since no recognised institution (including the IOC, British
Association of Sports and Exercise Medicine, English Institute of
Sport or British Journal of Sports Medicine) has defined this
across sports. For the purposes of this review, ‘elite’ was defined
as either professional sporting participation (eg, professional
soccer) or sporting activity at national or international level.
Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed
using a modified version of van Rijn et al’s14 appraisal tool. The
modifications included a criterion on the definition of the sports
sample ability/participation and a definition on OA and how it
was diagnosed. Seven criteria were defined: sports sample
ability/participation adequately defined; a non-sporting com-
parative group was used; age-matched controls; a prospective
design was used; total number of sports participants in the
study >100; clearly diagnosed OA with explanations (radio-
logical, both radiological and clinical or surgery); that the study
provided raw data percentages, OR, risk ratio (RR) or estimated
RR; and clearly explained statistical significance and their
meaning in any conclusions. Each criterion was rated positive,
negative or non-applicable. If a particular criterion was not
applicable for that study, a positive score was allocated for that
criterion. A total score for the methodological quality of each
study was calculated by summing the number of positive criteria
(range 0–7). Studies with five or more positive criteria were con-
sidered to be of ‘high quality’.14

 Each

was
undertaken
independently
by
two
reviewers (GT
, AG). Any disagreements regarding the appraisal
score were addressed through discussion. If agreement could
not be reached, a decision was adjudicated by a third reviewer
(SRK).
Data synthesis
Study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the data extrac-
tion tables and original source papers. When evidence of popu-
lation heterogeneity between studies was evident (eg, age,
gender, sporting activity, duration of follow-up analysis, method
of diagnosing OA), data were narratively reviewed. When there
was a low risk of population heterogeneity in respect of these
variables, an unadjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs was calcu-
lated using a Mantel-Haenzel summary estimate. Statistical het-
erogeneity was assessed with I2 and χ2 values. Where statistical
heterogeneity
was
evident
(I2
≥30%;
χ2:
p<0.10),
a
random-effects model was adopted. When this did not occur, a
fixed-effect model was adopted (Cochrane Handbook).16 All
statistical
analyses
were
performed
on
RevMan
(Review
Manager (RevMan) V
.5.1. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane
Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011).
The primary analyses undertaken included the prevalence of
OA within a general sporting cohort and the RR of experiencing
this compared with non-sporting cohorts. Secondary analyses
included the risk of experiencing OA between different sports
(eg, football, running, tennis) and between elite versus non-elite
sports people; whether there is a relationship between intensity
of sporting participation and OA; and whether previous injury
sustained during sport (most notably for the assessment of elite
sports people) was associated with OA.
A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to investigate the origin
of statistical heterogeneity when this was evident. Through this,
analyses by study design for cohort versus case–control/cross-
sectional were undertaken to account for this possible risk of
bias. An assessment of the risk of small sample size publication
bias was made using a funnel plot based on the primary analysis
(ie, relationship between sporting participation and OA).
The research synthesis results were interpreted using the
GRADE framework to assess the evidence level based on the
sum of the evidence for each individual analysis.17 Through
this, the quality of evidence was determined by evaluating the
study design and evidence for risk of bias (using the results from
van Rijn et al’s14 appraisal results), inconsistency of results,
indirectness of evidence, imprecision and likelihood of publica-
tion bias, magnitude of effect size, dose–response, confounders
or evidence of spurious effects.17
RESULTS
Search results
The results of the search strategy are summarised in the
PRISMA flow chart (figure 1). The search strategy identified
12 297 citations. From these, 372 were deemed potentially eli-
gible. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 46 were deemed
eligible and included in the full review.

Summary of the methodological quality of included studies
Online supplementary table S1 presents the results of the meth-
odological
quality
assessment
of
the
included
studies.
Thirty-three studies (71.7%) were deemed of high quality, and
13 (28.3%) as low quality. Of most importance, 10 studies
(21.7%) did not clearly define their cohort’s level of sporting
participation. Eleven studies (23.9%) provided minimal infor-
mation on their diagnosis of OA.
Assessment of publication bias
As figure 2 demonstrates, there was a broadly symmetrical
funnel plot based on the primary analysis (relationship between
sporting participation and OA). Asymmetry suggests that studies
are missing and attributed to publication bias.64 With a symmet-
rical funnel plot, the data for this study appeared to be of low
risk of small sample size publication bias to impact on this
analysis.
Relationship between sport (non-specific) and OA
Narrative synthesis: Of the 46 studies, 30 (65.2%) reported an
increased risk of OA after sports exposure.18

25–32
35 36 38 41 42 46 47 49–51 54–60 62 63 Of these, seven were cross-
sectional.54–60 The other 16 (34.8%) did not show an increased
risk.19 20 22 24 33 34 37 39 40 43–45 48 52 53 61
Meta-analysis: A meta-analysis assessed the relationship in 20
studies based on low risk of study or population heterogeneity.
For overall sports participation, there was an increased risk of
OA in people who participated in sporting pursuits compared
with a control group (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.64; p<0.01;
I2=71%; N=12 583; figure 3).
GRADE assessment: The quality of evidence for the relation-
ship between sport (non-specific) and OA was downgraded
three levels to ‘very low’ because of study limitations (risk of
bias
and
observational
study
design),
imprecision
and
inconsistency.
Relationship between level of sporting participation and OA
Narrative synthesis: T
wenty-four studies investigated the rela-
tionship
between
level
of
sporting
participation
and
OA.18 23 25 27 28 30 31 36 40 41 49–51 56–59 61–63 Nineteen (79%)
studies of elite sports participants demonstrated an increased
risk of OA,18 23 25 27 28 30 31 36 41 49–51 56–59 61–63 with one of
these demonstrating an increased risk of hospital admission due
to OA.36 The remaining five studies (20.0%) demonstrated no
relationship between sports participation and OA.19 33 34 39 40
Meta-analysis: When assessed solely for people considered as
performing at an elite level (n=20 studies), there was also an
increased risk of OA after sports exposure in elite sports people
compared with a control group (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.09 to
1.57; p=0.005; I2=72%; N=1384; figure 4).
A sensitivity analysis was undertaken of this analysis only
examining cohort study designs. For this evidence base, there
was no significant statistical relationship between OA and sports
participation in elite sports people compared with non-sports
people controls (RR 1.37; 95% CI 0.84 to 2.22; p=0.21;
I2=88%).
GRADE assessment: The quality of evidence for the relation-
ship between level of sporting participation and OA was down-
graded three levels to ‘very low’ because of study limitations
(risk of bias and observational study design), imprecision and
inconsistency.
Relationship between type of sport undertaken and OA
Narrative synthesis: In soccer, 12 studies showed a positive rela-
tionship
between
OA
and
soccer
participa-
tion.18 21 25 27 38 41 47 56 58–60 63 There was no significant
relationship between soccer and OA compared with non-
sporting participants (teachers, office workers, manual workers

study, there was only a relationship between OA and male
soccer players but not in athletics nor tennis players compared
with aged/sex-matched controls.40
T
wo papers (16.7%), which recruited long-distance runners
alone, demonstrated a relationship between running and hip23
and knee OA.55 The remaining 10 studies (83.3%) for this sport
demonstrated no association.19 22 24 37 43–45 48 52 53
Three studies (75%) of the track and field athletic studies
involving elite athletes showed a positive association between
sports and OA in the elbow62 and hip.31 51 The other study
demonstrated no association with OA in the talotibiofibular
joint.39
Meta-analysis: It was possible to pool data from 16 papers
assessing prevalence of OA in soccer players. This suggested a
pooled prevalence of 0.35, the highest prevalence of all sports
analysed (table 1). It was possible to estimate the pooled preva-
lence for a number of other sports. Pooled prevalence of OA in
long-distance/middle-distance runners was 0.07 (n=10) and
0.16 (n=8) for track and field athletics. Estimates for this value
ranged from 0.19 (n=2) for shooting, to 0.04 (n=2) for tennis.
There was a statistical relationship between OA and soccer
(RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.77; I2=66%; p=0.002; see online
supplementary figure S1), but no statistical relationship between
athletes at elite levels (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.93; I2=96%;

Relationship between intensity of sporting participation
and OA
Narrative synthesis: T
en studies evaluated the relationship
between
the
intensity
of
sporting
participation
and
OA.23 26 29 35 37 45 50 54 55 62 Nine (90%) reported a positive
relationship between greater intensity associated with subse-
quently greater prevalence of OA.23 26 29 35 45 50 54 55 62 One
study reported no association.37
T
wo studies reported that higher mileage and higher pace was
associated with greater subsequent prevalence of OA in the
knees45 and hip OA in elite athletes.23 This relationship was not
evident in non-elite athletes as assessed in an additional two
studies.37 55 In upper limb OA, one study reported an associ-
ation between 10-year history of using weights >3 kg in training
activities and subsequent elbow OA in elite javelin throwers.62
Similarly, high exposure to sport was also associated with the
increased risk of OA. High exposure was defined by participant
recall. This was defined as those in the group with >800 hours
exercise in total,35 highest quartile of sports activities in the
group29 and an equally split group classified as having high and
medium exposure.26 The number of years in combination with
long-term ‘vigorous’ exercise increased the risk of OA.50 The
term ‘vigorous’ was predefined according to sporting activity,
which included tennis.
GRADE assessment: The quality of evidence for the relation-

Relationship between previous sporting injury and OA
Narrative
synthesis:
Five
articles
assessed
the
relationship
between OA and previous sporting injury.27 38 47 56 60 One
study assessed the relationship between previous meniscectomies
and subsequent OA in former soccer players.27 The evidence
reported a RR of OA being significantly greater than the control
(RR=1.64; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.01). This was comparable with
the total data set (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.41).
T
wo studies reported on the association between OA and
soccer players who sustained an ACL injury.47 60 Lohmander
et al60 found that 51% had radiographic knee OA. Using multi-
variate analysis, no significant influence on knee symptoms was
found in those who had undergone reconstructive ACL surgery.
In a similar study involving male soccer players, 14 years after
ACL injury, Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or higher changes were
seen in 41% of the affected knees compared with 4% of the
unaffected knees. On pooled prevalence, OA was more fre-
quently seen in soccer cohorts following ACL injury (preva-
lence=0.68)47
60 compared with the overall soccer cohorts
without specific ACL injury (prevalence=0.34; table 1) or for
those soccer players postmeniscectomy (0.53).
GRADE assessment: The quality of evidence for the relation-
ship between previous sporting injury and OA was downgraded
two levels to ‘low’ because of study limitations (risk of bias and
observational study design) and imprecision.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review has evaluated the evidence on the rela-
tionship between participation in the most common sports in
England and OA. Across all studies, the relationship between
sports participation and OA was equivocal. The results suggested
an increased risk of OA for those who participate at the elite
level. This is most notably in soccer and athletes, with the
exception of long-distance/middle-distance running, compared
with non-elite sports participants (p<0.001). The majority of
studies in elite sports demonstrated an association between
sports participants and risk of OA. In previous reviews, sporting
activities have been associated with hip and knee OA, although
elite sporting participation has not been separately studied.5 8 9
Interestingly, the analyses suggest that the risk of OA may be
associated with the type of sport. Indeed, the majority of studies
involving soccer demonstrated that there was a positive associ-
ation with OA, where all the studies involving non-elite soccer
players21
32
38
47
60 and 80% of studies in elite soccer
players18 25 27 41 56 58 59 63 demonstrated a positive association.
In contrast, both narrative review and meta-analyses indicated
no association with OA and running.19 22 24 37 43–45 48 52 53
However, using the GRADE approach, the quality of the evi-
dence was assessed as very low quality, meaning that we are very
uncertain about the estimates of effect from these findings; thus,
the results of the analyses should be viewed with caution.
The results provided some evidence to suggest that higher
paced activities and higher exposure to vigorous exercise may
increase the risk of OA. Long-distance running has been shown
to be associated with OA in long-term sporting activity involv-
ing over 90 min of moderate sports participation or 45 min of
vigorous exercise50 and in athletes who ran >97 km/week and
at a faster pace.23 Notably, Lane et al43–45 52 53 only studied
between 17.9 and 27 miles ran when no association was found.
The association between soccer and OA may also be related to
the intensity of sport, as soccer is an activity which lasts over
90 min. These findings were supported in a previous systematic
review determining the association between intensity of sport
and hip OA.9
In an earlier study, more years running but not distance was
associated with an increased risk of OA, although no control
group was used.55 In contrast, no significant difference was
found between the risk of OA and the average number of years

 run or the number of miles run/week in a study using self-
reported questionnaires involving varsity runners.37
Regarding the risk of previous sporting injuries in the top 32
most popular sports in England10 and OA, it was not possible to
perform a subgroup analysis to assess this confounding variable
on meta-analysis. However, it was possible to assess the point
prevalence of different groups. This indicated that those follow-
ing an ACL rupture presented with the greatest prevalence of
tibiofemoral joint OA compared with those following menisect-
omy and non-injured controls. Overall, this was based on a
limited number of studies since there were limited data attribu-
ted to those who had an injury compared with those who did
not. No trend in the association between previous injury and
risk of OA among players who retired through injury was twice
that observed among players who had not retired through
injury, although this may suggest that the severity of injury was
an important confounding factor.
The type of pathologies typically experienced particularly by
sporting groups provides an explanation for differences in risk
of OA between footballers compared with runners, for example.
The injuries sustained during the active professional life of
soccer players, and the multidirectional, traumatic injuries
associated with soccer, are more typically meniscal lesions and
ACL injuries65 compared with runners who more frequently
have
uniplanar,
overuse
tendinopathy-type
injuries.66
The
intra-articular involvement exhibited in footballers is hypothe-
sised to be a principal reason for higher risk of OA in this popu-
lation compared with runners which are uniplanter activities
and associated with tendinopathy pathologies.
There are several limitations to this review. Imprecision with
data gathered, especially with the use of self-reporting question-
naires, exposes studies to high levels of bias. Length of
follow-up also varied between studies. The different methods of
diagnosing OA by clinical, radiological, surgical or self-reported
questionnaires make comparisons difficult. This variability in
diagnosing OA would offer different results depending on the
methods used, as radiological signs of OA may occur without
clinical symptoms.33 Furthermore, 26% of studies did not fully
explain how they diagnosed OA. This was in part due to the
methodology involved in some of the studies, where question-
naires were used to obtain the diagnosis of OA. There has been
many in-depth reviews associating injuries and the risk of
OA,67
68 and it is possible that publications that did not
mention sports participation still involved ACL injuries that
were a consequence of sporting activity. However, for our
review,
this
did
not
fulfil
our
strict
inclusion
criteria.
Furthermore, our focus on the most popular sports in England
led to exclusion of studies involving less frequent sports;
American Football, for example, was not included. Although a
higher level of sport may be related to higher ‘intensity’, many
of the articles included did not characterise the ‘intensity’ of
sport. For this reason, all the papers investigating intensity were
included, regardless of level of sport. There were also relatively
few studies investigating OA in the upper extremities compared
with the lower extremities.
In conclusion, the relationship between sports participation
and OA remains complicated and controversial, being currently
based on low-quality or very low-quality evidence. Isolating the
effect of sports participation on OA in studies remains difficult.
For non-elite participants, the relationship is unclear and further
studies need to be conducted with participant sporting ability
clearly defined. There is, however, very low-quality evidence
supporting a relationship between sports participation and OA
in elite participants. Furthermore, a relationship between the
intensity of sport undertaken and OA may also exist. The rela-
tionship remains to be explored, however, as it is unclear if it is
associated with pace, length or duration of training. Although it
was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis to assess the
risk of previous sporting injury with the risk of OA, increased
point prevalence in athletes with previous meniscectomy and
ACL rupture has been found.
Future study is warranted to develop knowledge in this field.
Research priorities include the assessment of OA in recreational
sports people. The evidence base for meta-analysis has been
based on elite athletes, and therefore it remains unknown how
generalisable these results are to the recreational as well as older
sportsperson. Second, a number of important sports were under-
represented within the current evidence. Compared with soccer
and running, there was limited literature on sports such as rugby,
cycling, golf and swimming. These may be available to assess the
relationship between OA and OA symptoms in this population.
Finally, the majority of studies were based on case–control or
cross-sectional study designs. The optimal study design to answer
these research questions would be longitudinal cohort studies.
These should be adopted for future higher quality studies to
further develop understanding in this area.
What are the findings?
▸ There is low-quality or very low-quality evidence to support
an increased association of sports participation and the
occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) in elite participants.
▸ There is very low-quality evidence to suggest that soccer,
especially in the elite setting, may increase the risk of OA,
whereas running may not.
▸ For non-elite participants, the relationship is unclear and
further prospective cohort studies need to be undertaken.
▸ Overall, there were conflicting results, based on low-quality
evidence, in determining an association between previous
sporting injuries and OA, although pooled findings suggest
that ACL injuries and meniscectomies may contribute to OA
in soccer players.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Improve awareness that there may be an increased risk of
OA in elite athletes, particularly soccer players, and those
who get injured.
▸ This may influence prehabilitation and rehabilitation of these
athletes.
▸ Be aware that high-intensity sporting activity may potentially
be associated with OA, although further research needs to
be undertaken to understand this.
▸ Understand that this needs to be balanced with the
substantial benefits of participating in sports (physical and
mental well-being) where >30 min of activity/day is advised.
