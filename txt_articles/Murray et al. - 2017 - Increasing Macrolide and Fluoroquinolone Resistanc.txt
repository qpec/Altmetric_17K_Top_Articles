Escalating resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin is 
being reported for Mycoplasma genitalium in the Asia-Pacif-
ic region. Analyzing 140 infections, we found pretreatment 
fluoroquinolone-resistance mutations in parC (13.6%) and 
gyrA (5%). ParC S83 changes were associated with moxi-
floxacin failure. Macrolide/fluoroquinolone-resistance muta-
tions were in 8.6% of specimens, for which recommended 
therapies would be ineffective.
M
ycoplasma genitalium infection is a major cause of 
urethritis in men and is associated with cervicitis, 
pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth, and spontane-
ous abortion in women (1). In the United States, Australia, 
and Europe, the recommended first-line treatment for M. 
genitalium infection is the macrolide azithromycin. How-
ever, a recent meta-analysis documented a rapid decline 
in its efficacy, from 85% before 2009 to 67% after 2009; 
the highest levels of resistance were in the Asia-Pacific re-
gion (2). The second-line therapy recommended by the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.
cdc.gov/std/tg2015/default.htm) is the fluoroquinolone 
moxifloxacin. Quinolones target the DNA gyrase (com-
prising GyrA and GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParC and 
ParE). Quinolone binding involves serine at position 83 
(Escherichia coli GyrA numbering) and the acidic amino 
acid 4 positions away (D87 or E87) (online Technical Ap-
pendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/5/16-1745-
Techapp1.pdf) (3). Mutations affecting these residues or 
surrounding sequence (the quinolone resistance-determin-
ing region, QRDR) may confer resistance (4).
Moxifloxacin treatment failure is being increasingly 
reported, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region (5,6), along 
with increasing detection rates of resistance mutations (7). 
Although several studies have reported the prevalence of 
QRDR mutations in M. genitalium, most mutations have 
not been linked with treatment outcomes. Our aims with 
this study were to report the prevalence of mutations in the 
parC and gyrA genes in patients with M. genitalium infec-
tion, to correlate specific mutations with moxifloxacin out-
comes, and to determine the prevalence of dual (macrolide/
fluoroquinolone) resistance.
The Study
From July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2013, samples were 
collected from consecutive M. genitalium–infected partic-
ipants at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre in Australia 
(5). Detection of M. genitalium, load quantitation, and se-
quence analyses were performed as described previously 
(5,8). Overall, 155 patients (112 men, 43 women) with 
PCR-confirmed M. genitalium infection were recruited, 
representing 90% of patients with infections diagnosed at 
the Centre over the study period. We obtained adequate 
samples from 140 of the 155 patients to generate base-
line parC and gyrA gene sequences; these 140 formed the 
study group.
Patients were initially given a single dose of 1 g 
azithromycin. The 54 for whom this treatment failed (posi-
tive by PCR test-of-cure at day 28 or persistent symptoms 
before day 28, with no identified reinfection risk) were 
given moxifloxacin (400 mg/d for 10 d). The 6 for whom 
moxifloxacin treatment failed were given pristinamycin (1 
g 4×/d for 10 d). This study was approved by The Alfred 
Hospital Ethics Committee (no. 150/12), and informed 
consent was obtained from patients.
In pretreatment specimens, various single-nucleo-
tide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in the parC 
and gyrA QRDR (Table 1; online Technical Appendix). 
Of the 19 (13.6%) of 140 samples with ParC substitu-
tions, 16 had S83 mutations (14 S83I, 2 S83R) and 3 had 
 
D87N substitutions.
We found a significant association between detection 
of ParC S83 mutations and treatment failure. M. genitalium 
from all 6 patients for whom moxifloxacin failed but from 
only 3 of the 48 patients for whom moxifloxacin was effec-
tive had the ParC S83 mutation (p<0.0001 by Fisher exact 
test) (Table 2, patients 1–9). The 3 infections successfully 
treated despite a change at ParC S83 are of interest. For

these patients, low bacterial load may have contributed to 
therapeutic success (9), led to spontaneous clearance, or 
resulted in false-negative follow-up PCR (Table 2). How-
ever, in contrast, treatment failed for 1 patient with a low 
anal load of M. genitalium and S83 change. Similar to the 
findings for this study, in the parent cohort of 155 patients, 
organism load influenced apparent azithromycin cure; 7% 
of infections carrying markers of azithromycin resistance 
were cured by azithromycin, and organism load was sig-
nificantly lower than that among those with resistant infec-
tions for whom azithromycin treatment failed (5).
The prevalence of S83 changes in this study is high-
er than that detected in a study at Sydney Sexual Health 
Centre (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) (8.4%, n = 
143) (10). Studies in Japan reported prevalence ranging 
from 3.6% (n = 28) to 29.4% (n = 51) and 36.8% (n = 19) 
(7,8,11), although 1 study involved a cohort at higher risk 
(female sex workers). A low prevalence of S83 mutation 
has been observed in Europe (1.5% in France, 5% in Eng-
land and Germany) (12–14). This mutation has been asso-
ciated with moxifloxacin failure in 3/3 cases in the Sydney-
based study (6).

(median 3.36).  
 
 Increasing Resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium
SNPs that changed the ParC acidic residue (D87) 
were rare (2.1%) and because of low numbers could not be 
associated with treatment outcomes. Other studies found 
higher frequency of this change (3.5%–7.1%) (7,8,10,15); 
authors of 1 study reported an association with levofloxa-
cin failure (15).
M. genitalium GyrA lacks the S83 residue common to 
GyrA of other bacteria, having instead a methionine at the 
equivalent position (M95). This enzyme is therefore proba-
bly partially resistant to quinolones. GyrA changes (at M95 
or D99) occurred at a frequency of 5.0% (7/140) but could 
not be correlated with treatment outcome because they oc-
curred concurrently with S83 changes in ParC. Previously, 
a GyrA M95I change was associated with M. genitalium 
treatment failure in 1 patient (6).
Patients who received moxifloxacin were followed up 
with a PCR test-of-cure at 14 and 28 days. For the 6 for 
whom treatment failed, the mutation profiles in follow-up 
specimens were unchanged from the initial premoxifloxa-
cin sequence, suggesting lack of resistance selection in 
vivo after moxifloxacin.
A total of 60 (42.9%) of the 140 pretreatment samples 
had macrolide-resistance mutations (5). Both macrolide 
and parC fluoroquinolone mutations at S83 or D87 were 
present in 12 (8.6%) of the 140 samples. Prevalence of 
fluoroquinolone resistance markers was higher in samples 
with (20%, 12/60) than without (8.8%, 7/80) macrolide-
resistance mutations, although this difference did not 
reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). This finding sug-
gests that successive treatment failures with first-line, then 
second-line, antimicrobial drugs are generating strains re-
sistant to 2 classes of drugs. Previous studies found lower 
levels of combined macrolide and fluoroquinolone muta-
tions in men attending a urology clinic (3/51, 5.9%) (7) 
and higher levels in a high-risk population (female sex 
workers; 4/16, 25%) (11).
This study has limitations. The resistance profiles for 
the infecting strains of M. genitalium were not tested in in 
vitro culture. There may be other unknown changes in the 
genome that confer resistance to the drugs of interest. In 
addition, the resistance levels reported are probably under-
estimates because samples were collected in 2012–2013 
and levels have probably risen since then (7).
Conclusions
We found high frequency of ParC S83 changes associated 
with fluoroquinolone resistance in a sexually transmitted 
infection clinic in urban Australia; these changes were as-
sociated with moxifloxacin failure. The high level of dual 
markers for macrolide/fluoroquinolone resistance sug-
gests successive treatment failure after sequential mono-
therapy leading to the serious outcome that ≈10% of M. 
genitalium infections are not treatable with recommended 
or readily available antimicrobial drugs. In the absence of 
alternatives, treatment with pristinamycin cured all 6 pa-
tients with dual-class resistance infections (G.L. Murray 
et al., unpub data).
This study highlights the urgent need for antimicrobial 
drug resistance surveillance and the value of diagnostic as-
says that report the presence of resistance markers to opti-
mize treatment. Our results suggest that it is time to recon-
sider the indications for azithromycin and invest in trials of 
different available as well as novel classes of antimicrobial 
drugs for M. genitalium treatment. They also raise serious 
concerns about sequential use of monotherapy and the need 
to evaluate combination therapies as we enter a new era of 
untreatable sexually transmitted infections.

he first quinolone (quinol[ine] + -one [compound

byproduct of chloroquine (see “quinine,” https://wwwnc.
cdc.gov/EID/article/21/7/ET-2107_article) synthesis and 
was introduced in 1962 to treat urinary tract infections. In 
1980, researchers at the Kyorin Pharmaceutical Company 
showed that the addition of a fluorine atom to the quino-
lone ring resulted in an antibiotic with broader antimicro-
bial activity, which was named norfloxacin, the first fluo-
roquinolone. In 1983, Bayer published data that showed 
adding a single carbon atom to norfloxacin—what would 
become ciprofloxacin—further increased activity. Fluoro-
quinolones are today among the most frequently used anti-
microbial drugs to treat infections in humans and animals.

telephone surveys among 503 adults in Hong Kong, China, 
to explore changes in their behavioral and psychological 
responses to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus epidemic. 
Trends were examined using generalized estimating equa-
tions models. Findings showed that responses varied with 
the course of the pandemic.
O
n June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization de-
clared the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) virus 
outbreak a pandemic (1). Previous studies have investigat-
ed community responses to the pandemic in different coun-
tries during early stages of the epidemic (2–5). The studies 
investigated persons’ risk perceptions and knowledge relat-
ed to the virus, perceived efficacy of preventive measures, 
and psychological and behavioral responses. However, be-
cause of intersample variations, these cross-sectional stud-
ies did not capture within-person changes. We conducted 
a longitudinal cohort study to investigate changes in re-
sponses among the general Hong Kong, China, population 
during the pH1N1 pandemic.
The Study
A cohort sample of 18- to 60-year-old adults in Hong 
Kong participated in 7 rounds of telephone surveys during 
August 2009–July 2010, which covered almost the entire 
pH1N1 pandemic period in Hong Kong. At baseline, we 
invited 677 adults to participate; 503 (74.3%) consented 
and completed the survey (online Technical Appendix 
Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/5/16-0768-
Techapp1.pdf). We measured the following variables: 
knowledge about the modes of pH1N1 virus transmission; 
risk perceptions associated with the virus (perceived sus-
ceptibility to and severity of infection); perceived efficacy 
and use of preventive measures (e.g., handwashing, using 
a facemask); psychological responses (worry about infec-
tion and emotional distress); and evaluations of the gov-
ernment’s performance in pandemic control. Sample sizes 
for surveys 2–7 ranged from 452 to 481, yielding retention 
rates of 89.8%–95.6%.
Most participants were women (57.9%), 40–60 years 
of age (55.8%), employed full time (55.9%), and married 
(65%). Sex and age distributions were comparable to those 
in the local census data (6). We aimed to determine whether 
there were overall linear trends in participants’ perceptions, 
psychological responses, and behavioral responses to the 
pandemic. We examined linear trends for these variables 
across the 7 time points by using generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) models. GEE models not only account for 
intracorrelated repeated measures data but also fit various 
data types using appropriate link functions. The analyses 
were conducted using PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA); 2-sided p<0.05 was considered significant.
Over time, >85% of the participants used a face mask 
and immediately visited a doctor when experiencing influ-
enza-like symptoms. More than 50% of the participants 
washed their hands >10 times every day throughout the 
survey period (p>0.05). As the pandemic progressed, a de-
creasing percentage of participants wore masks in public 
areas; avoided touching their mouth, nose, and eyes; took 
antiviral drugs; and avoided crowded places (p<0.001) (on-
line Technical Appendix Table 2). Percentages of partici-
pants feeling worried, depressed, or emotionally disturbed 
about pH1N1 virus decreased over time (p<0.001) (online 
Technical Appendix Table 3).
Over time, a decreasing percentage of participants rec-
ognized that touching infected persons or contaminated ob-
jects could result in virus transmission (p<0.001). Through-
out the study period, a consistently high percentage of 
participants (>92%) recognized that the virus could be trans-
mitted via respiratory droplets. Misconceptions about pos-
sible transmission through insect bites (26.1%) and water 
sources (34.5%) were prevalent. The percentage of partici-
pants reporting at least 1 misconception was stable over time 
(p>0.05). A consistently high percentage (>90%) of partici-
pants believed that using face masks in public areas, wash-
ing hands frequently, and avoiding crowded places could 
effectively prevent the spread of pH1N1 virus (p>0.05).

 DISPATCHES
The percentage of participants believing that pH1N1 
virus would be more harmful than seasonal influenza in 
terms of fatality and bodily damage increased over time 
(p<0.001). The percentages of participants who believed 
the population was highly susceptible to pH1N1virus in-
fection and who perceived a high chance of having a 
large-scale local outbreak in the coming year dropped sig-
nificantly (p<0.001), but some fluctuations were observed; 
for example, the percentage peaked during survey round 2 
(around the September influenza season).
Throughout the study period, ≈12% 21% of the par-
ticipants gave a failing score (<5 on a 0- to 10-point scale) 
for the governments overall performance in controlling the 
pandemic (p>0.05). However, during survey rounds 2 7, 
an increasing percentage of participants believed in the 
governments ability to control the pandemic (p<0.001) (on-
line Technical Appendix). The percentage of participants 
who believed that Hong Kong would not have enough vac-
cine or medication to deal with the pandemic decreased 
over time (p<0.001).
Conclusions
This study investigated changes in community perceptions 
over the course of the pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. 
Findings were highly comparable to those from other lo-
cal cross-sectional surveys (5,7) and a systematic review 
(8). Knowledge regarding preventive measures and adher-
ence to such measures was, in general, higher among our 
participants than among the general population in other 
countries (e.g., Australia, India, and the Netherlands) (9–
11). The prevalence of misconceptions about some incor-
rect modes of transmission (e.g., insect bites) gradually 
declined. However, ≈50% of participants still held at least 
1 of the 4 misconceptions regarding transmission (i.e., air-
borne transmission over a long distance and transmission 
through insect bites, water sources, and well-cooked pork). 
Furthermore, over time, a lower percentage of participants 
avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent vi-
rus transmission. A 2015 systematic review suggested that 
health authorities should provide more updated informa-
tion about the virus (8). We also recommend using health 
campaigns to increase public awareness about different 
routes of pH1N1 virus transmission.
Perceived severity of pH1N1 virus infection de-
creased over time, which may partially explain the decline 
in distress and avoidance behaviors; this pattern was also 
observed in a recent review (8). However, an increasing 
proportion of participants believed that, compared with 
seasonal influenza, pH1N1 resulted in more deaths and 
more severe body damage. Perceived susceptibility to in-
fection declined substantially as the epidemic progressed, 
suggesting that the public gradually perceived fewer 
risks from pH1N1 virus. Avoidance behaviors and use 
of facemasks in the absence of influenza-like symptoms 
became less prevalent over time, similar to a trend seen 
in Malaysia (12). Mental distress among persons in Hong 
Kong was lower during the pH1N1 pandemic than during 
the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic 
(13), possibly due to the milder consequences of pH1N1 
infection. Persons in Hong Kong seemed to remain ratio-
nal during the pandemic, thereby avoiding possible pan-
demic-associated economic threats.
Public support for the government declined over time. 
During survey round 5, a total of 20.6% of the participants 
gave a failing score to the government’s performance, and 
13.5% perceived that the government would not be able 
to control the pandemic. The poll was split as to whether 
the government should use the same response for pH1N1 
influenza and seasonal influenza. Our findings suggest that 
the public should be advised of the pros and cons of pH1N1 
control policies; a watchful step-down may be better ac-
cepted if the policies are understood.
This study has limitations. First, telephone surveys 
may be subject to self-selection bias. However, partici-
pants’ demographics were comparable to those in local 
census data (6). Second, Hong Kong’s unique experience 
with the SARS outbreak may have influenced the popula-
tion’s response to the pH1N1 pandemic; thus, our find-
ings may not be fully generalizable to other countries. 
Third, we treated time as a continuous variable in the 
GEE models. Ideally, polynomials should be added to the 
linear time variable; however, given the small number of 
time points and absence of theoretical shapes, that was 
not feasible.
Our findings provide valuable information regarding 
overall linear trends and changes in community responses 
toward the pH1N1 pandemic among a Hong Kong cohort. 
These findings should help inform other countries in for-
mulating appropriate pandemic control plans for influenza 
and other emerging infectious diseases.

Survey results showed treponemal infection among pet ma-
caques in Southeast Asia, a region with a high prevalence 
of human yaws. This finding, along with studies showing 
treponemal infection in nonhuman primates in Africa, should 
encourage a One Health approach to yaws eradication and 
surveillance activities, possibly including monitoring of non-
human primates in yaws-endemic regions.
Y
aws, an endemic tropical disease distinguished by 
bone and skin lesions, is caused by infection with 
Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue treponemes. Suc-
cessful yaws treatment campaigns during 1950–1965 
were followed by a resurgence of disease, and the World 
Health Organization (WHO) consequently mounted a 
yaws eradication campaign (1). Although the agent of 
yaws is spread among humans via direct contact, research 
has shown that nonhuman primates (NHPs) may serve as 
mammalian host reservoirs with the potential for zoonotic 
transmission (2). Successful eradication campaigns de-
pend on there being no reservoir shielding the agent from 
eradication efforts; thus, the role that NHPs play in yaws 
among humans must be determined (3).
African Old World primates (OWPs) can be infected 
by T. pallidum and exhibit symptoms of yaws (2). Of note, 
the Treponema Fribourg-Blanc strain (isolated from a ba-
boon in western Africa in 1966) exhibits remarkable genet-
ic similarity to strains that cause yaws in humans (4) and in 
experiments, was shown capable of infecting humans (5). 
More recently, studies focusing on treponemal infections 
among NHPs in eastern Africa and the Republic of Congo 
showed that the NHP geographic range overlaps consider-
ably with areas having a formerly high prevalence of yaws 
in humans (2).
Macaques (Macaca spp.), OWPs native to Asia and 
northern Africa, are susceptible to and have been experi-
mentally infected with T. pallidum (6). After the initial 
WHO eradication efforts, yaws was believed to be largely 
eliminated from countries of mainland Asia, although re-
porting and active case detection have not been uniform 
throughout the region (7). Several island nations in Asia, 
however, continue to report active human yaws cases (8,9).
Macaques, the most widely distributed and numerous 
NHPs in the world, are sympatric with humans throughout 
Asia, thriving in human-altered environments and com-
monly kept as pets. To further characterize the role NHPs 
might play in the maintenance of T. pallidum subspecies, 
we screened an extensive archive of serum samples col-
lected from free-ranging and captive macaques.
The Study
As part of a project characterizing the pathogen landscape 
among macaques and humans, we collected blood samples 
from NHPs during 1999–2012 and stored them at −80°C 
(10). We retrospectively screened samples from 734 ma-
caques representing 13 species distributed throughout the 
animal’s natural geographic range (Table 1). Study proto-
cols were approved by the University of Washington Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (no. 4233–01) 
and adhered to the American Society of Primatologists 
Principles for the Ethical Treatment of NHPs (https://www.
asp.org/society/resolutions/EthicalTreatmentOfNonHu-
manPrimates.cfm). 
We used a Macro-Vue RPR Card Test Kit (BD, Frank-
lin Lakes, NJ, USA) to screen the 734 blood samples; 11 
(1.5%) were positive (Table 2). The RPR (rapid plasma 
reagin) test, a lipoidal test (nontreponemal) for IgG and 
IgM typically associated with treponemal infection, can

 Treponemal Infections in Macaques, 1999–2012
occasionally elicit nonspecific responses. To confirm RPR-
positive samples, we used ESPLINE TP (Fujirebio, Tokyo, 
Japan), an enzyme immunoassay for measuring reactivity 
to 2 recombinant T. pallidum antigens, Tp47 and Tp17. 
ESPLINE TP and RPR tests have been validated for use 
in OWPs (11). Of the 11 RPR test–positive samples, 1 was 
from Singapore; 2 from Bali, Indonesia; and 8 from Su-
lawesi, Indonesia. Six samples (all from Sulawesi) yielded 
confirmatory positive results on the ESPLINE TP assay. 
Of note, in Sulawesi, the only positive macaques were pets 
sampled from South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi Prov-
inces, which make up the island’s southwestern peninsula 
(Figure). We also used ESPLINE TP to test the 28 RPR 
test–negative samples from Sulawesi’s southwestern pen-
insula; none tested positive.
At the time of sampling, the macaques underwent a 
physical examination, including close inspection of head, 
trunk, extremities, oral cavity, and genitals. We conducted 
a retrospective review of the data and found that none of 
the macaques had lesions typical of treponemal infection 
(4). Of the 734 macaques, 13, including 2 seropositive 
 
macaques from Sulawesi’s southwestern peninsula, had hy-
popigmentation on the palms of their hands, feet, or both. 
Hypopigmentation is rarely seen in yaws but is a common 
manifestation of pinta, which is caused by infection with T. 
carateum, a close relative of T. p. pertenue.
Conclusions
Our findings show that pet macaques in Southeast Asia can 
be infected with Treponema spp. related to those that infect 
humans. The overall prevalence of infection was low in 
our survey, but the pocket of infection detected among pets 
in Sulawesi’s southwestern peninsula is noteworthy. The 
demonstration of reactivity in the serologic tests provides 
unequivocal evidence that the macaques had been infect-
ed with T. pallidum or a highly related pathogen. We had 
hoped to amplify a portion of tp0548, a locus in the T. palli-
dum genome used for molecular typing, but no amplifiable 
pathogen DNA was found in the whole-blood samples that 
had been held in storage for >10 years. Therefore, we could 
not determine whether the treponemal strains from NHPs 
in Sulawesi resembled strains that cause human yaws.

 DISPATCHES
Sulawesi, the third largest island in the Indonesian 
archipelago, has a population of ≈17 million persons and 
7 endemic macaque species. The seropositive samples 
from South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi Provinces were 
collected in July and August of 2000, immediately pre-
dating an active yaws outbreak among humans in the re-
gion that caused 241 documented cases in the neighbor-
ing southeastern peninsula during 2001–2011 (WHO, 
 
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75528/1/
WHO_HTM_NTD_IDM_2012.2_eng.pdf) 
(Figure). 
During that outbreak, WHO characterized the South Su-
lawesi and West Sulawesi Provinces as “data deficient” 
regions in regard to the status of yaws among the human 
population. Most macaques whose samples were used 
in this study were free-ranging, but all of the macaques 
sampled in South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi Provinc-
es had been captured at a young age for use as pets. The 
association between humans and pet macaques is often 
intimate, with the sharing of food; space; and physi-
cal contact through grooming, play, or aggression (12). 
Two of the Treponema spp.–infected pets were owned 
by the same person and housed together. Studies of pet 
macaques in Sulawesi and their owners have indicated 
that infectious agents can move between these popula-
tions (12,13). Although the treponemal serologic status 
of the pet owners in this study is unavailable, the fact 
that seropositive pet NHPs from a region neighboring an 
area with a high number of human yaws cases suggests 
that the NHP cases resulted from treponeme transmis-
sion from humans to pets.
All macaques in this study, with the exception of M. 
sylvanus from Gibraltar, were from historically yaws-
endemic areas where WHO conducted past yaws eradica-
tion campaigns. Much of Asia has a rich tradition of hu-
man–NHP commensalism, and macaques are common 
in villages, often as pets (10). Moreover, we previously 
showed that macaques can harbor an array of mammalian 
picornaviruses, astroviruses, and mycobacteria (13–15), 
underscoring the role of macaques in the ecology of these 
pathogens. However, as with our current study of trepo-
nemal infections, definitive evidence for transmission and 
the direction of transmission have not been established for 
these pathogens.
Our findings of treponemal infections among macaques 
in Southeast Asia, along with published work showing in-
fection in NHPs in Africa (4), should encourage holistic 
and One-Health approaches to eradication and surveillance 
activities, including consideration of monitoring NHPs in 
yaws-endemic regions. Such approaches are particularly 
relevant for pet NHPs, which can easily be assessed and 
treated. The human–NHP interface is ancient and complex, 
and continued research, particularly in yaws-endemic re-
gions, can help to ameliorate concerns as a second WHO 
yaws eradication campaign moves forward.

We examined the characteristic changes of hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) in antiviral drug treatment–naive patients re-
ferred for pretreatment evaluation in Taiwan during 2008–
2012. Over time, we observed substantial decreases in 
the prevalence of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and increasing 
prevalence of the precore G1899A mutation and HBV-DNA 
levels in HBeAg-positive patients.
H
epatitis B virus (HBV) replication is dependent on 
the activity of its reverse transcriptase, an error-
prone enzyme, which results in the accumulation of ge-
nomic mutations. In the natural course of chronic hepatitis 
B, the prevalence of some mutations (e.g., precore stop 
codon mutations, basal core promoter mutations, dele-
tions in the pre-S gene region) gradually increases with 
the progression of disease through the different clinical 
stages (1,2). This increase is largely caused by longer du-
ration of chronic HBV infection, during which HBV has 
to adapt to environmental changes for better survival. Be-
cause of the availability of antiviral drug therapies, HBV 
replication can now be completely suppressed in most pa-
tients (3,4). However, drug resistance and suboptimal or 
no responses to antiviral drugs can occur (5), and there 
is a lag of few months between the start of treatment and 
complete virologic suppression. In addition, treatment 
noncompliance and intermittent treatment almost always 
result in virologic, or even clinical, relapses. In such cas-
es, antiviral drug therapy imposes an iatrogenic selection 
pressure on HBV, and the selected viruses carrying muta-
tions can cause infections.
HBV has been infecting humans for a long time; thus, 
it is possible that genotypic or phenotypic changes have oc-
curred over time, especially since the introduction of HBV 
vaccine and antiviral drugs. We examined serologic chang-
es and genotypic alterations of HBV in treatment-naive 
patients during 2008–2012 in Taiwan, where a universal 
vaccination program was launched in 1986.
The Study
During January 2008–December 2012, we reviewed the 
clinical and virologic data for 1,224 treatment-naive patients 
with chronic hepatitis B who were referred to our clinic at 
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, from all 
parts of Taiwan for pretreatment evaluation. We obtained 
patients’ age and sex and assessed platelet count, cirrhosis 
status, HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and HB e antibody (anti-
HBe) status, HBV genotype, HBV DNA level, basal core 
promoter mutations, and precore stop codon mutations. We 
conducted the study using previously described methods 
(6,7). The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
Univariate regression analysis indicated a significant 
increase in patient age (p = 0.001) and a significant de-
crease in the number of HBeAg-positive patients (p<0.001) 
over the 5-year year period. Three factors were signifi-
cantly associated with HBeAg status: an increased prev-
alence of anti-HBe (p = 0.004) and increased prevalence 
of precore G1896A (p = 0.003) and G1899A (p = 0.019) 
mutations. However, no significant changes occurred in the 
prevalence of 9 of 10 basal core promoter mutations (online 
Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/5/16-1894-Techapp1.pdf). We noted a mild, but 
significant, decrease in the prevalence of G1730C muta-
tions (p = 0.034).
Multivariate analysis showed that patient age and 
changes in the prevalence of HBeAg were independent of 
each other (adjusted p = 0.025 and 0.021, respectively). 
However, multivariate analysis that included G1730C, 
HBeAg, and age showed that the changing prevalence of 
G1730C was not independent of HBeAg and age (adjusted 
p = 0.222, 0.049, and 0.027, respectively).
These data indicate that the decreasing prevalence of 
HBeAg was not due to the increasing age of treatment-
naive patients but due to an authentic phenotypic change 
of HBV over the years. It was unclear why patient age in-
creased over the 5-year period; one possibility is the grad-
ual acceptance of antiviral drug therapy by older patients, 
who may have been worried about possible side effects 
of new drugs. The cause of the decreasing prevalence of 
HBeAg over time was possibly due to the fact that a higher 
proportion of HBeAg-positive patients were treated in the 
early era of antiviral drug use and more HBeAg-negative 
patients received treatment at a later time. Alternatively,

 Shifts in HBV in Treatment-Naive Patients
because HBV infection has occurred in and expanded 
among the human population over the past decades, the se-
rologic alterations may be attributed to a changing trend in 
the mode of transmission on a population scale; for exam-
ple, in Taiwan, horizontal transmission has increased be-
cause of injection drug abuse and sexual transmission, and 
vertical transmission has decreased because of the neonatal 
vaccination program.
We subsequently separated patients into HBeAg-pos-
itive (n = 398) and HBeAg-negative (n = 826) groups. In 
the HBeAg-positive group, we saw a significant increase 
over time in the prevalence of precore G1899A mutations 
(p = 0.039) and level of HBV DNA (p = 0.013); however, 
these 2 factors were independent of each other (adjusted 
p = 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). Of note, we found no 
change in age over time in this subgroup (p = 0.281) (on-
line Technical Appendix Table 2). Furthermore, because 
these patients were all HBeAg-positive, we could not 
explain the data by a differential proportion of HBeAg-
positive patients being treated in the early and later peri-
ods of the antiviral drug era. Instead, other factors (e.g., 
changes in transmission routes, altered predominant risks 
of exposure, changes of HBV prevalence in different sub-
populations) could be responsible. Alternatively, depen-
dent on the scale of antiviral drug treatment received in 
this population, the therapeutic methods might also partly 
contribute to selection of mutation G1899A and HBV 
with higher replication efficiency.
In the HBeAg-negative treatment-naive patients (n = 
826), we found a borderline increase in patient age (p = 
0.046) and a borderline decreased prevalence of male pa-
tients (p = 0.044) over time. In addition, we noted a signifi-
cant decrease in the prevalence of mutation A1752G over 
the 5-year period (p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis showed 
that these 3 changes were not independent (adjusted p = 
0.062 for age, 0.067 for male sex, and 0.201 for mutation 
A1752G; data not shown).
Conclusions
Our findings showed a shift in the phenotypic and geno-
typic characteristics of HBV in treatment-naive patients 
in Taiwan, an area where chronic hepatitis B is endemic, 
after the widespread use of antiviral drugs. In Taiwan, 
because of a limited budget for national health insurance 
and a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B, insurance 
coverage for hepatitis B treatment is not lifelong. Under 
the insurance plan, patients are provided with continuous 
nucleotide and nucleoside antiviral treatment for 3 years, 
after which the drugs are withdrawn to observe for dura-
bility of clinical remission. About half of patients have 
clinical relapses, and almost all have virologic relapses 
(8). Only patients with clinical relapses are retreated. Af-
ter 3 years of retreatment, the antiviral drugs are with-
drawn again to observe for durability; subsequent retreat-
ments (for 3 years) are given only to patients with clinical 
relapses. The procedure is repeated until no clinical re-
lapse has occurred. It is conceivable that the characteris-
tics of HBV in these antiviral drug–treated, hepatitis B–
relapsed patients have been selected by antiviral drugs. 
Antiviral drug–selected HBVs could potentially spread to 
treatment-naive patients and cause new infection or su-
perinfection. However, the contribution of this therapeu-
tic factor to the phenotypic and genotypic alterations of 
HBVs is unclear. Other environmental and social factors, 
such as altered transmission routes, changes of exposure 
risks, variations of HBV prevalence in subpopulations 
over time, and effects of neonatal vaccination, could lead 
to the changes in HBV characteristics.
Over the 5 years of this study, we found an increas-
ing prevalence of G1899A mutations and an increasing 
concentration of serum HBV DNA in treatment-naive, 
HBeAg-positive patients. The mean HBV DNA concen-
trations increased from 7.7 to 8.3 log10/mL and then sta-
bilized without further increases during the last 3 years 
of the study. On the other hand, prevalence of G1899A 
mutations increased from 2.5% to 17.4%. The clinical 
significance of this mutation in HBeAg-positive patients 
is unclear and requires further study. In conclusion, this 
study revealed that, in Taiwan, HBV characteristics have 
been changing in the era after introduction of antiviral 
drug treatment and HBV vaccination.

A reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 avian influenza A(H5N6) virus 
was isolated from a fecal sample of a  Mandarin duck (Aix 
galericulata) in South Korea during October 2016. This vi-
rus was genetically similar to H5N6 subtype virus isolates 
from China, Vietnam, Laos, and Hong Kong, including hu-
man isolates.
H
ighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) 
have caused major economic losses in poultry indus-
tries and represent a serious threat to public health. The 
H5N1 subtype of these viruses was first detected in 1996 
from a domestic goose in Guangdong, China (Gs/GD), and 
its H5 hemagglutinin (HA) gene has subsequently evolved 
into 10 genetically distinct virus clades (0–9) and multiple 
subclades (1). Since 2008, novel reassortant HPAIVs bear-
ing the HA gene of the Gs/GD lineage H5 clade 2.3.4 and 
neuraminidase (NA) gene subtypes N1, N2, N5, N6, N8, 
and N9 have been identified in China (2).
Although clade 2.3.4 of influenza A(H5N8) virus 
caused influenza outbreaks in eastern Asia and was sub-
sequently disseminated into Europe and North America by 
wild aquatic birds in late 2014 (3,4), clade 2.3.4.4 of this 
virus has caused continuous outbreaks in China since 2013 
(5). This virus disseminated into Laos and Vietnam in 2014 
and Hong Kong in 2015 (6,7). Since the first influenza case 
in Sichuan Province, China, 15 human cases of influenza 
caused by this subtype have been reported in China during 
April 2014–May 2016 (8).
We report detection of an H5N6 subtype HPAIV in a 
fecal sample obtained from a wild bird sampled in South 
Korea during the fall 2016. We sequenced and genetically 
analyzed the complete genome of this virus isolate.
The Study
On October 28, 2016, we isolated an H5N6 subtype 
HPAIV from 1 of 391 fecal samples collected from wild 
birds in Gokgyo-cheon, South Korea (36°45′12.3″N, 
127°07′12.7″E). Gokgyo-cheon is a wild bird habitat 
for wintering of migratory waterfowl, including mallard 
(Anas platyrhynchos), spot-billed duck (Anas poecilo-
rhyncha), Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata), and com-
mon teal (Anas crecca). The species of the positive fecal 
sample was identified as Mandarin duck on the basis of 
DNA barcoding technique as described (9). There were 
no detectable clinically ill or dead wild birds at the sam-
pling site.
Full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic 
analysis were conducted to trace the origin of A/Manda-
rin_duck/Korea/K16-187-3/2016(H5N6) virus, hereafter 
referred to as MD/KR/2016. Methods used are detailed in 
online Technical Appendix 1 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/5/16-1905-Techapp1.pdf). We entered genome 
sequences in the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing 
All Influenza Data) EpiFlu database (https://www.gisaid.
org) under accession nos. EPI861480–EPI861488. Strains 
used in analysis are shown in online Technical Appen-
dix 2 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/5/16-1905-
Techapp2.xlsx).
The isolate was identified as an HPAIV on the basis 
of multiple basic amino acids at the HA proteolytic cleav-
age site (PLRERRRKR/G). GISAID BLAST (https://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) searches indicated that H5 and 
N6 genes had high nucleotide identity in HA (99.17%) and 
NA (99.24%) with A/great_egret/Hong_Kong/00032/2016 
(H5N6) (Table 1). Internal gene segments, except the poly-
merase basic 1 (PB1) gene, had high nucleotide identity 
with other H5N6 subtypes isolated in Guangdong and Ji-
angxi, China (PB2, 99.09%; polymerase acidic, 98.96%; 
nucleoprotein, 99.16%; matrix, 98.98%; and nonstructural 
protein [NS], 98.31%). However, the PB1 gene had high 
nucleotide identity (97.01%) with H4 low pathogenicity 
avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs).
In previous phylogenetic analyses, the HA gene of 
clade 2.3.4.4 viruses was divided into 4 distinct subgroups 
(online Technical Appendix 1 Figure 1) (10). Group in-
tercontinental A (icA) contains H5N8 subtype virus and 
Reassortant Clade 2.3.4.4 Avian Influenza 
A(H5N6) Virus in a Wild Mandarin Duck,  
South Korea, 2016

Japan, Taiwan, Canada, the United States, and countries 
in Europe during 2013–2016. Group B contains H5N8 
subtype viruses identified in China and South Korea dur-
ing 2013–2014, and in Russia in late 2016. Group C con-
tains H5N1 and H5N6 subtype viruses identified in China, 
Vietnam, Laos, and Hong Kong, including isolates from 
humans in Guangdong, Yunnan, and Hunnan Provinces, 
China. Group D contains H5N6 subtype viruses identi-
fied in China and Vietnam, including an isolate from a 
human in Sichuan Province, China. The HA gene of MD/
KR/2016 virus belonged to group C and clustered with 
H5N6 subtype viruses isolated from humans, cats, and the 
environment in Guangdong during 2014–2015 and a mi-
gratory aquatic bird in Hong Kong during January 2016 
(A/great_egret/Hong_Kong/00032/2016 [H5N6]) (online 
Technical Appendix 1 Figure 1).
A previous study reported that A/environment/
Guangdong/GZ693/2015 (H5N6), hereafter referred to as 
GZ693/2015(H5N6), is a 7:1 gene reassortant virus be-
tween H5N6 HPAIV and LPAIVs found in southern China 
(7). MD/KR/2016 clustered with GZ693/2015(H5N6) vi-
rus for all 8 genes (online Technical Appendix 1 Figure 
2). In particular, the HA, NA, PB2, polymerase acidic, nu-
cleoprotein, matrix, and NS protein genes clustered with 
GZ693/2015(H5N6) and other clade 2.3.4.4 group C H5N6 
viruses. The PB1 gene clustered with GZ693/2015(H5N6) 
(nucleotide identity 92.79%) and LPAIVs, such as H3N2 
and H4N2 subtype viruses, from southern China. Phy-

 Reassortant Influenza A(H5N6) Virus, South Korea
gest that MD/KR/2016 virus had an identical genotype to 
GZ693/2015(H5N6).
Most of clade 2.3.4.4 group C viruses have leucine 
or serine at position 129 (H5 numbering) in HA protein. 
However, MD/KR/2016 had a single amino acid deletion 
at position 129 (Table 2), as did A/great_egret/Hong_
Kong/00032/2016 (H5N6). This deletion at position 129 
and phylogenetic network analysis suggested that MD/
KR/2016 is closely related to H5N6 subtypes isolated 
from wild birds in Hong Kong in 2016 (online Technical 
Appendix 1 Figure 3). MD/KR/2016 contained the muta-
tion associated with increased virulence in mammals and 
mammalian transmissibility (S123P and T156A muta-
tions in the HA gene; P42S and D92E mutation, and elon-
gated C-terminus with PDZ binding motif in NS gene). 
However, this isolate lacked the Q226L and G228S muta-
tions in HA, which have been associated with increased 
binding to human-type receptor (α-2,6–linked sialic acid) 
and lacked Q591K, E627K and D701N mutations in PB2, 
which have been associated with enhanced pathogenic-
ity and adaptation to mammalian hosts (11). All of the 
9 H5N6 subtype human isolates of group C lacked the 
Q226L and G228S mutations in HA, but 5 viruses con-
tained the E627K mutation in PB2 (Table 2), suggesting 
that some purported mammalian adaptation amino acid 
substitutions were not necessary for sporadic virus infec-
tion of H5N6 HPAIV in humans.
Conclusions
Wild aquatic birds have been suspected to play a key role 
in dissemination of HPAIVs to various regions, as seen 
with clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAIV in 2005, clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 
HPAIV in 2009, and clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 HPAIV in 2014 
(4,12). Some populations of Mandarin ducks are year-
round residents in South Korea and Japan; others popula-
tions migrate between Russia and eastern Asia (13). In 
South Korea, HPAIV was detected from Mandarin duck 
samples in 2010 (H5N1) and 2014 (H5N8) (14,15) and 
again in 2016 during this study, suggesting that Manda-
rin ducks are a major host species for clade 2.3.4.4 H5 
HPAIV and can disseminate the virus throughout South 
Korea and into other countries. Detection of the H5N6 
HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 in a migratory bird species in South 
Korea; reports of H5N6 outbreaks in poultry from China, 
Laos, and Vietnam; and diagnosis of lethal human cas-
es of highly homologous H5N6 viruses in China raise a 
concern over the potential for broad geographic dissemi-
nation of zoonotic H5N6 HPAIV by wild birds outside 
eastern Asia.

There is no proven alternative to penicillin for treatment of 
maternal syphilis. We report 2 case-patients with maternal 
syphilis who were successfully treated without penicillin. We 
used amoxicillin and probenecid for the first case-patient 
and amoxicillin, probenecid, and ceftriaxone for the second 
case-patient.
S
yphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. 
Untreated maternal syphilis can lead to serious compli-
cations, including congenital syphilis, stillbirth, and neona-
tal death (1). In 2012, the estimated numbers of worldwide 
cases of maternal and congenital syphilis were 930,000 and 
350,000, respectively (1). Recently, the United States re-
ported increasing rates of congenital syphilis (2).
Penicillin G is recommended for treatment of maternal 
syphilis (3). Benzathine penicillin G is used in many coun-
tries but is unavailable in others, such as Japan. As a result, 
guidelines in Japan of treatment sexually transmitted dis-
eases recommend benzylpenicillin benzathine hydrate (1.2 
million units/d) and oral amoxicillin or ampicillin (1.5 g/d) 
as alternatives (4). However, there is little evidence to sup-
port use of these regimens. We report 2 case-patients with 
maternal syphilis who were successfully treated without 
penicillin.
The Study
Case-patient 1 was a 20-year-old woman who came to the 
hospital at the National Center for Global Health and Medi-
cine (Tokyo, Japan) because of positive results for trepo-
nemal and nontreponemal tests in December 2014. Eight 
months earlier, she was given a diagnosis of trichomonal 
vaginitis, which resolved after a course of metronidazole. 
Three months before coming to the hospital, she was exam-
ined in a clinic because of a rash on her abdomen and back, 
for which she was given topical treatment, which resulted 
in resolution of the rash within a few weeks. A rapid plas-
ma reagin (RPR) and T. pallidum hemagglutination assay 
(TPHA) were not performed at that time.
Two months before coming to the hospital, she missed 
her menstrual period and showed a positive result for a home 
pregnancy test. Serologic tests for treponemal and nontrepo-
nemal antibodies were performed at a nearby clinic, and she 
was referred to our hospital 13 weeks into her pregnancy. 
Her RPR titer was 1:16, and TPHA showed positive results. 
The patient was given a diagnosis of early latent syphilis and 
prescribed a 14-day course of amoxicillin (6 g/day) and pro-
benecid (1 g/d). The RPR titer decreased to 1:8 and 1:4 at 3 
and 6 months after treatment, respectively. RPR was the last 
test performed before delivery.
She gave birth to a boy at 41 weeks gestation. The baby 
did not have any signs or symptoms of congenital syphilis, 
and his serum RPR and TPHA titers were 1:1 and 1:640, re-
spectively (Table). The baby was not treated for congenital 
syphilis and has not shown any signs of congenital syphilis 
infection. At 15 months of age, results for RPR and TPHA 
were negative for a serum sample from the infant.
Case-patient 2 was a 31-year-old woman who came 
to the same hospital because of a fever in July 2015. One 
month earlier, she went to another hospital for investigation 
of a genital ulcer. The day before coming to our hospital, 
she was given a diagnosis of syphilis and prescribed amoxi-
cillin (1.5 g/d).
A few hours after she took the first dose of amoxicillin, 
a fever developed, and the patient came to the emergency 
department of our hospital, where she was given a diagno-
sis of a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction. She was also found 
to be 6 weeks pregnant. Her RPR titer was 1:32 and TPHA 
titer was 1:160, and she was given a diagnosis of primary 
syphilis. Three days later, she again came to our hospital 
for additional evaluation. Treatment was changed to amox-
icillin (3 g/d) and probenecid (750 mg/d). Three days after 
this change in treatment, she could no longer tolerate the 
medication because of hyperemesis gravidarum, and she 
was admitted to our hospital. She was given ceftriaxone 
because she could not tolerate frequent administration of 
penicillin. Intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/d) was given for 8 
days. Her RPR titer decreased to 1:4 and 1:4 at 6 and 7 
months after treatment, respectively. RPR was the last test 
performed before delivery.
In March 2016, she gave birth to a girl at 39 weeks 
gestation. The baby did not have any signs or symptoms 
of congenital syphilis, her RPR titer was negative, and the 
TPHA titer was 1:320 in a serum sample (Table). The baby 
was not treated for congenital syphilis, and RPR and TPHA 
results at 4 months of age showed negative results.

Conclusions
In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 
930,000 cases of maternal syphilis resulted in cases of 
350,000 congenital syphilis (1). In Japan, the National In-
stitute of Infectious Diseases reported that the number of 
patients with syphilis is increasing (5). As the incidence 
of women with syphilis increases in Japan, incidence of 
congenital syphilis also increases (6). The efficacy of 
penicillin for treatment of syphilis is well established by 
clinical experience and is the only treatment option with 
documented efficacy (3).
Both case-patients described in this report were giv-
en amoxicillin and probenecid. A pharmacokinetic study 
reported that oral amoxicillin and probenecid could at-
tain treponemicidal concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid; 
therefore, these drugs were considered alternative agents 
for treatment of neurosyphilis (7). Tanizaki et al. (8) re-
ported that treatment with oral amoxicillin (3 g) and pro-
benecid (750 mg) was highly effective in and well tolerated 
by syphilis patients with HIV infection. However, in their 
report, all patients were men.
For case-patient 2, we changed treatment to ceftriax-
one, which is active against T. pallidum and has an effective 
concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. Marra et al. (9) reported 
that ceftriaxone is an alternative to penicillin for treatment of 
neurosyphilis or early syphilis among HIV-infected patients. 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines 
recommend ceftriaxone as an alternative treatment of syphi-
lis in nonpregnant women (3). However, data regarding the 
use of ceftriaxone for treatment of maternal infections and 
prevention of congenital syphilis are insufficient (3).
Because RPR titers for both case-patients became non-
reactive, treatment with amoxicillin plus probenecid and 
ceftriaxone successfully prevented syphilis in both fetuses. 
Amoxicillin and probenecid are not routinely prescribed for 
pregnant women because of little evidence of their efficacy 
in preventing congenital syphilis. Because benzathine peni-
cillin G is not available in Japan, intravenous penicillin G 
is used to treat maternal syphilis. However, this treatment 
option requires hospitalization for frequent administration; 
admission of all maternal syphilis patients is not feasible.
Although ceftriaxone can be administered once a day, 
it requires daily hospital visits. Azithromycin is not recom-
mended for use during pregnancy (3), and treatment fail-
ures for fetuses have been reported (10). Tetracyclines are 
contraindicated during pregnancy (3). Therefore, we used 
amoxicillin in accordance with guidelines for Japan (4).
One study reported the effect of probenecid during preg-
nancy on fetal outcomes (11). Because probenecid can cross 
the placental barrier, its use in pregnancy must follow care-
ful consideration of anticipated benefits and possible hazards 
(12). Probenecid was prescribed to increase serum levels of 
penicillin. Amoxicillin monotherapy might be considered for 
treatment maternal syphilis if an appropriate dose is given.
The World Health Organization estimates that 5.6 mil-
lion doses of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin are 
needed annually to treat all syphilis cases, and 930,000 doses 
are needed to prevent all cases of congenital syphilis (13). In 
May 2016, the 69th World Health Assembly reported that 
benzathine penicillin had been in short supply for several 
years (14). Therefore, during shortages of penicillin, it is 
prudent to consider alternative treatment regimens.
In conclusion, amoxicillin and ceftriaxone should be 
considered as alternatives to penicillin for treatment of ma-
ternal syphilis. Further studies evaluating the efficacy of 
amoxicillin and ceftriaxone are warranted.

During 2016, eight Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from 
7 patients in Hawaii were resistant to azithromycin; 5 had 
decreased in vitro susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Genomic 
analysis demonstrated a distinct phylogenetic clade when 
compared with local contemporary strains. Continued evo-
lution and widespread transmission of these strains might 
challenge the effectiveness of current therapeutic options.
N
eisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted patho-
gen that has progressively developed resistance to 
the antimicrobial agents recommended for treatment (1). 
Third-generation cephalosporins are among the last class 
of antimicrobial agents that are still effective, and ceftriax-
one is the foundation of treatment options recommended by 
the United States (2) and other countries. The diminished 
cache of drugs to treat gonorrhea has led most countries to 
recommend a combination of ceftriaxone and azithromy-
cin in an attempt to ensure effective therapy and slow the 
emergence of resistance by decreasing the likelihood that a 
N. gonorrhoeae isolate would survive concomitant expo-
sure to 2 antimicrobial agents with distinct mechanisms of 
action (2). However, sporadic treatment failures have been 
reported (2), and gonorrhea is considered a global health 
concern by the World Health Organization and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because of the 
few remaining treatment options.
Surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gon-
orrhoeae was established by the CDC in the United States 
in 1986 as penicillin and tetracycline resistance was becom-
ing widespread. The CDC Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance 
Project (GISP; Division of STD Prevention, National Center 
for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention) 
collects ≈5,000 isolates per year from men with urethritis 
seeking care at sexually transmitted disease clinics across the 
United States and assesses the isolates for antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility (3). The findings are used by CDC to formulate na-
tional treatment recommendations and develop research and 
disease intervention priorities. Ceftriaxone remains highly 
effective in treating gonorrhea in the United States; 99.9% of 
isolates were inhibited by <0.125 µg/mL in 2014 (4). How-
ever, the percentage of isolates with decreased azithromycin 
susceptibility (azithromycin MIC >2 µg/mL) rose sharply 
from 0.6% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014. Fortunately, none of the 
2014 isolates demonstrated clinical resistance or decreased 
susceptibility to both azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
The Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) State 
Laboratories Division maintains nucleic acid amplifica-
tion, culture, and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing 
by Etest for N. gonorrhoeae. During 2016, the HDOH and 
CDC became aware of several N. gonorrhoeae isolates 
with high-level resistance to azithromycin and decreased 
susceptibility to ceftriaxone in Hawaii as a result of routine 
laboratory testing and jointly initiated an enhanced labora-
tory investigation of the isolates.
The Study
The HDOH confirmed the identification of 61 isolates of N. 
gonorrhoeae, collected during February 2016–May 2016, and 
antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing was performed on all 
of them. Isolates were identified as N. gonorrhoeae by using 
the API NH test kit (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), and 
the MICs for azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime was 
assessed by Etest (bioMérieux) on GC II agar supplemented 
with 1% IsoVitaleX (bioMérieux). Etest carried out at the 
HDOH State Laboratories Division found that 8 N. gonor-
rhoeae isolates had extremely high MICs (>256 µg/mL) for 
azithromycin and MICs of 0.125–0.25 µg/mL for ceftriaxone 
and cefixime (online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.
gov/EID/article/23/5/17-0088-Techapp1.pdf). The 8 isolates,

which were collected from 7 patients and included 2 isolates 
(urethral and urine) from the same patient (GCWGS_0182 
and GCWGS_0322), were sent to CDC for confirmatory test-
ing using agar plate dilution (5).
All 61 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were sequenced 
(paired-end; 2 × 250-bp read length) on an Illumina MiSeq 
sequencer (Illumina Denmark ApS, Copenhagen, Den-
mark) at the HDOH State Laboratories Division. De novo 
assembly was conducted at CDC by using SPAdes 2.5.1 
(http://www.cab.spbu.ru/software/spades), and the core 
genome single-nucleotide polymorphism alignment was 
generated by using Parsnp 1.2 (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/
software/harvest), with the FA19 genome (GenBank acces-
sion no. CP012026) as the reference. The maximum-likeli-
hood phylogeny was reconstructed by using RAxML 8.0.0 
(http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml) 
with 
1,000 bootstrap replicates. Whole-genome sequencing data 
were also used to determine the multilocus sequence typing 
(MLST) and N. gonorrhoeae–multiantigen sequence typ-
ing (NG-MAST) allelic profiles for the targeted isolates.
Results of the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 8 
isolates were closely related and formed a single clade (Fig-
ure) with 223 single-nucleotide polymorphism differences. 
MLST analysis revealed 1 unique profile, sequence type (ST) 
1901 (online Technical Appendix), which is a highly success-
ful lineage associated with multidrug resistance that prob-
ably originated in Japan (6). The results of the NG-MAST 
analysis indicated that all 8 isolates shared 1 novel profile, 
ST14121. Epidemiologic investigations did not associate 
sexual network transmission among the 7 patients, although 
2 patients reported sex with the same partner. However, the 
consistent MLST and NG-MAST profiles, in combination 
with the strongly supported clade, suggest the circulation of 
a single strain within the population.
To assess the contribution of known mutations to mac-
rolide and cephalosporin resistance, we examined muta-
tions in penA, ponA, mtrR, and 23S rRNA genes. Regard-
ing azithromycin resistance, a deletion in the mtrR promoter 
associated with low-level resistance (7) and 4 mutated 23S 
rRNA copies with the A2059G mutation that confers high-
level resistance (8) were identified in all 8 isolates. The ponA 
L421P mutation and mosaic penA alleles have been associ-
ated with reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins (7,9). The 
ponA L421P mutation was found in all 8 isolates; however, 
only the nonmosaic penA XVIII allele was detected.
The first N. gonorrhoeae isolate (H11S8) with high-
level azithromycin resistance (HL-AziR) in the United 
States was identified in Hawaii in 2011 (10). More recent-
ly, Public Health England characterized 7 N. gonorrhoeae 
HL-AziR isolates that were collected in northern England 
during November 2014–March 2015 (11). Isolate H11S8 
and those from England were more susceptible to ceftri-
axone (MIC range 0.004–0.03 µg/mL) than the cluster of 
N. gonorrhoeae HL-AziR isolates identified in Hawaii. 
Genetic comparisons of the 2011 Hawaii isolate placed it 
in a distinct clade on the phylogenetic tree (Figure). The 
NG-MAST of H11S8 was ST649, and those from England 
were ST9768. Three HL-AziR N. gonorrhoeae strains were

isolated in 2011 and 2012 in Sweden with slightly higher 
ceftriaxone MICs (range 0.032–0.064 µg/mL) and were 
identified as either NG-MAST ST285 or ST8727 (12).
All patients infected with the HL-AziR isolates in our 
study were successfully treated with 250 mg ceftriaxone 
plus 1 g azithromycin. In contrast, a recent pharyngeal N. 
gonorrhoeae isolate, resistant to azithromycin and ceftriax-
one, was recovered from a patient in the United Kingdom 
following treatment with dual antimicrobial therapy of 500 
mg ceftriaxone plus 1 g azithromycin (13). Although the 
isolate was genetically distinct from the 8 isolates in Ha-
waii, it was more closely related to those 8 isolates than to 
the other 53 contemporary isolates from Hawaii.
Conclusions
The combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin remains 
the hallmark for the treatment of gonorrhea worldwide on 
the basis of surveillance data that monitors antimicrobial 
susceptibility (2,14,15). Slight fluctuations have been ob-
served in ceftriaxone MICs, but rarely have isolates been 
recovered with a MIC >0.5 μg/mL. However, a growing 
body of evidence suggests that azithromycin is becoming 
less effective and should not be used as a monotherapeutic 
agent for gonorrhea. The observation of increased MICs 
for ceftriaxone and azithromycin in a cluster of strains from 
Hawaii might be the harbinger that the effectiveness of cur-
rent treatment options will be challenged. It is critical that 
countries expand systematic surveillance for drug-resistant 
N. gonorrhoeae and that laboratories maintain culture capac-
ity to support rapid response activities to confirm suspected 
treatment failures and mitigate transmission through contact 
tracing. Expansion of laboratory capacity to conduct genetic 
analysis in real time would further benefit clinicians and 
sexually transmitted disease public health programs by iden-
tifying novel mechanisms of resistance that could be used to 
develop nonculture antimicrobial resistance tests and rapidly 
identify resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains in sexual networks.

To explore transmission patterns and genetic relationships 
of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A in China, we 
conducted a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism 
analysis on the strains in the 4 provinces in which incidence 
was highest during 1998–2012. Markedly phylogeographic 
clustering suggested regional virus circulation after intro-
duction from areas in southeastern China.
I
n Asia, incidence of paratyphoid fever remains high (1). 
In the mid-1990s, the number of paratyphoid fever cases 
in Asia caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A 
started to increase (2–4). In 2000, an estimated 5.41 million 
cases occurred; areas where incidence was highest (i.e., 
>100 cases/100,000 population per year) included south-
central and Southeast Asia (5). Since 1998, the incidence 
of paratyphoid fever in Asia and the world has been highest 
in China, ranging from 0.08 to 192.5 cases/100,000 popula-
tion annually (6); the provinces in which incidence is high-
est are Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Zhejiang (7).
Information about the transmission routes and risk 
factors for infection could be used to improve the control 
strategies and measures for paratyphoid fever. Laboratory-
based pathogen molecular subtyping, particularly genome-
wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, can 
markedly improve outbreak detection, source tracing, and 
understanding of the epidemic modes. In this study, we 
analyzed genome-wide SNP and epidemiologic data from 
Salmonella Paratyphi A strains isolated from the China 
provinces where incidence was highest over a long period 
(1998–2012) and detected region-limited clone expansion 
in the epidemic provinces.
The Study
In 1998, the incidence of typhoid/paratyphoid fever in 
China was 4.82 cases/100,000 population (60,146 cases 
reported); this measure has since decreased annually to 
0.88/100,000 (11,890 cases) in 2012 (China Information 
System for Disease Control and Prevention, unpub. data). 
Typhoid/paratyphoid fever cases in Guizhou, Yunnan, 
Zhejiang, and Guangxi Provinces accounted for 45.8% 
(in 1998) to 76.5% (in 2001) of all cases in China (online 
Technical Appendix Figure, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/5/15-1539-Techapp1.pdf). 
To analyze the genomic epidemiology of paratyphoid 
fever in these provinces, we first selected 96 Salmonella 
Paratyphi A strains circulating in 15 provinces in China 
during 1998–2011 (online Technical Appendix Table 1). 
Strains were isolated from hospitalized patients suspected 
of having typhoid/paratyphoid fever and were maintained 
in the strain bank of the Chinese Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. We then conducted genome-wide 
SNP genotyping by using the iPLEX Gold assay (Se-
quenom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with 2,343 SNPs 
obtained from 7 genomes sequenced in a previous study 
(8) and 17 genomes of Salmonella Paratyphi A strains se-
quenced in this study. We obtained 112 phylogenetically 
informative SNPs (including 57 nonsynonymous SNPs) 
(online Technical Appendix Table 2), which were further 
analyzed in 335 Salmonella Paratyphi A strains (online 
Technical Appendix Table 1) isolated from the provinces 
where incidence was highest (i.e., Guangxi, Guizhou, 
Yunnan, and Zhejiang) during 1998–2012 by using the 
iPLEX Gold assay. The population history of Salmonel-
la Paratyphi A was estimated by using BEAST version 
2.1.3 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/), and the maximum clade 
credibility tree was summarized by using TreeAnnota-
tor and visualized by using FigTree version 1.4.2 (both 
within BEAST). The consensus tree (Figure 1) showed 
that all strains fell into 2 main clades: clade 1 consisted of 
16 strains isolated from Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi 
Provinces during 1998–2007; clade 2 consisted of the 
strains that were most common and widespread in these 
4 provinces during 1998–2012. In clade 2, at least 3 sub-
clades were formed, which were markedly characterized 
by geographic clustering according to province (Figure 
1), suggesting intraprovince transmission of the different 
clones. In addition, the earlier strains in the root of each 
major subbranch were isolated mainly from Zhejiang, and 
in the years before 2005, some strains from Guangxi were 
also mixed in the Guizhou branch.
On the basis of the trees, we further determined 
from/to transmission of Salmonella Paratyphi A by using

Circos (9) (Figure 1). The same SNP genotypes of Sal-
monella Paratyphi A strains were preferentially transmit-
ted within a single province from year to year, whereas 
the strains from Zhejiang were frequently transmitted to 
Guizhou and Guangxi, particularly during 1998–2002. 
The transmission between Guangxi and Guizhou was 
markedly more frequent before 2004 and decreased after 
2005. After 2005, we found no transmission from Yunnan 
to other provinces. 
We also extracted information for 112 SNPs from 
127 genomes of the worldwide Salmonella Paratyphi A 
isolates in GenBank (10) and constructed a phylogenet-
ic tree by combining these data with data from the 335 
strains from China obtained in this study (Figure 2). The

international strains fell into 2 clades, and the strains from 
Southeast and southern Asia were positioned much clos-
er to the root of the strains from China, suggesting that 
the potential source of Salmonella Paratyphi A in China 
might be India or Indonesia.
Conclusions
The genome-wide SNP phylogeny provided more accu-
rate insights into the variation of Salmonella Paratyphi 
A strains in China. In Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan 
Provinces, which are geographically adjacent, Salmo-
nella Paratyphi A has existed for many years. Although 
we had speculated that the organism might show a mix-
ture of genetic patterns, the phylogenetic tree showed 
that epidemic strains from different provinces gradually 
accumulated their own mutations to evolve and form ob-
vious geographic branches. In earlier years of the study 
period (1998–2002), the epidemic strains from Guangxi 
and Guizhou Provinces might have originated from early 
epidemic strains from Zhejiang Province. The level of 
economic development in Zhejiang Province is high, 
whereas in Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan Provinces 
it is lower; the rural population from these 3 provinces 
migrates frequently to work in the economically de-
veloped southeastern coastal areas in China, including 
 
Zhejiang (11), Jiangsu, and Guangdong Provinces. Ac-
cording to the fifth national census conducted in 2000 
(http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/pcsj/rkpc/5rp/index.htm) 
and the sixth conducted in 2010 (http://www.stats.gov.
cn/tjsj/pcsj/rkpc/6rp/indexch.htm), the migration data 
within the 4 provinces showed this population move-
ment trend (online Technical Appendix Table 3). At ir-
regular intervals, migrant workers, mainly those who are 
young and middle-aged, return to their hometown for 
family reunions. 
In the mid-1990s, paratyphoid fever became an emerg-
ing problem in Zhejiang Province; during 1997–2005, in-
cidence was 8.61 cases/100,000 population (12). In those 
years, managing ex situ healthcare and medical treatments 
in China was problematic. When migrant workers got ill, 
they seldom sought medical treatment at the hospital in the 
city in which they worked; rather, they bought medicine at 
a chemist’s shop or returned to their hometown for treat-
ment (Zhang Q. The study on the health seeking behavior 
of migrant workers [master’s thesis]. China: Shaanxi Nor-
mal University; 2012).

 DISPATCHES
Because of lack of medical treatment in hospitals, 
migrant workers who become infected with Salmonella 
Paratyphi A easily become chronic carriers. Therefore, 
Salmonella Paratyphi A might be transmitted to Guangxi, 
Guizhou, and Yunnan Provinces via a migrating infected 
population, including patients and carriers. In addition, 
these 3 provinces are mainly mountainous, and the popula-
tion flow among these provinces is limited by their lower 
economic development and inaccessibility. Therefore, the 
transmission pattern in these regions could be closely as-
sociated with the southeastern coastal areas, where the 
level of economic development is higher, and transmission 
among these 3 provinces could be absent. Moreover, in 
these paratyphoid-epidemic provinces, most of the overall 
population lives in rural agricultural areas. Given the com-
bination of poor water and food hygiene with a hot and hu-
mid climate, the epidemic clones of Salmonella Paratyphi 
A could persist for a long time after being introduced into 
these areas.
In summary, we identified the evolution and trans-
mission mode of paratyphoid fever in the China provinc-
es where incidence is highest. Populations migrating to 
southeastern China probably mediated the transmission of 
Salmonella Paratyphi A. Considering the obvious region-
al clone expansion in these provinces, the local natural, 
social, and economic conditions need to be investigated 
for their potential roles in the spread of paratyphoid fever 
and for the development of intervention strategies.

We conducted epidemiologic and genetic analyses of family 
clusters of Mycobacterium ulcerans (Buruli ulcer) disease in 
southeastern Australia. We found that the incidence of M. 
ulcerans disease in family members was increased. How-
ever, the risk for exposure appeared short-term and not re-
lated to human-human transmission.
M
ycobacterium ulcerans is a slow-growing organism 
that causes necrotizing infections of skin and soft 
tissue, often requiring reconstructive surgery and result-
ing in long-term disability (1,2). Prevailing opinion is that 
humans are infected from the environment; insects, such 
as mosquitoes (3,4), and water-residing biting arthropods 
(5,6), have been proposed as vectors for transmission. In 
Victoria, Australia, there is evidence that native opossums 
might be involved in transmission (7). However, despite 
extensive research, the environmental reservoir of the or-
ganism and mode of transmission remain unknown.
We postulated that examination of M. ulcerans dis-
ease (Buruli ulcer) family clusters might provide useful 
new information about disease epidemiology. Theoreti-
cally, genetically related first-degree relatives have simi-
lar susceptibility to disease, and families share the same 
environment and therefore a similar exposure risk. Thus, 
we examined the epidemiology of M. ulcerans disease in 
family clusters managed in a large prospective observa-
tional cohort from the Bellarine Peninsula in southeastern 
Australia. We used data collected from all confirmed M. 
ulcerans cases managed during January 1, 1998–April 
12, 2016, at Barwon Health, a tertiary referral hospital in 
Geelong, Australia (8).
The Study
For this study, only initial M. ulcerans lesions were ana-
lyzed. A family cluster was defined as multiple family 
members independently given a diagnosis of M. ulcerans 
disease who were living at the same residence at the time of 
diagnosis. Data was collected by using Epi Info 6 (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) 
and analyzed by using Stata 12 (StataCorp LLC, College 
Station, TX, USA).
To determine the genetic relatedness of isolates de-
rived from family clusters, we performed whole-genome 
sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
analysis for 6 isolates derived from 3 family cluster pairs 
(Tables 1, 2). We sequenced DNA as 300-bp paired-end 
reads by using an MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San 
Diego, CA, USA). Resulting reads were mapped against 
the M. ulcerans Agy99 genome (9), including plasmid 
pMUM001 (10), by using Bowtie2 (11). Raw sequence 
reads for the 6 isolates have been deposited in the Nation-
al Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD, 
USA) Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession 
no. PRJNA321660. We also performed whole-genome 
SNP analysis for 6 additional unrelated previously se-
quenced human M. ulcerans isolates (Sequence Read Ar-
chive accession no. SRP004497) obtained from the same 
disease-endemic region.
A total of 324 patients with M. ulcerans disease from 
the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, Australia, were managed 
in the Barwon Health observational cohort during January 
1, 1998–April 12, 2016. Median age was 57 years (IQR 
34–74 years), and 164 patients (50.6%) were men. For the 
whole cohort, a combined time of 1,968.5 years had elapsed 
from diagnosis of the initial M. ulcerans lesions until the 
time of study analysis (April 12, 2016). The median dura-
tion elapsed from initial diagnosis until study analysis was 
4.7 years (IQR 2.8–9.7 years).
Twenty-one (6.5%) patients were part of a family 
cluster (Table 1), 9 genetically related and 12 related by 
marriage. All family clusters were diagnosed after the be-
ginning of 2008. We found that significantly fewer family 
clusters were diagnosed during the first half of the study 
period (0 of 92 cases during 1998–2007) than in the sec-
ond half (21 of 232 cases during 2008–2016) (p<0.01).

member was given a diagnosis, was 2.8 months (IQR 1.1–
20.6 months). The rate of new diagnosis of an M. ulcerans 
lesion in another family member was 5.69/1,000 person-
years (95% CI 3.15–10.29/1,000 person-years). We deter-
mined the cumulative proportion of patients given a diag-
nosis who had an affected family (Figure 1).
Core SNPs based on common variable nucleotide po-
sitions were identified for the 6 examined family isolates by 
whole-genome sequencing. A total of 4,918 core SNPs as-
cribed to the African Agy99 reference genome were identi-
fied according to strict filtering criteria. Only 8 SNPs were 
specific to >1 of the 6 isolates (Table 2). Of the 8 SNPs that 
differed among the isolates, only 3 were nonsynonymous 
substitutions. The remaining 5 SNPs were either intergenic 
or synonymous mutations.
Pairwise comparisons of family cluster isolates showed 
that isolates from the 4a/4b pair were genetically identical. 
In contrast, isolates from the 2a/2b and 1a/1b pairs contained 
several isolate-specific SNPs (Table 2; Figure 2). SNP 
analysis of unrelated M. ulcerans isolates from the same 
disease-endemic area showed that 3 of the 6 isolates were 
also genetically identical (Figure 2), which demonstrated 
that unrelated isolates can share a common genotype. The re-
maining 3 isolates contained 1–3 unique SNPs. Thus, family 
cluster isolates were not any more closely genetically related 
than 6 random isolates from the same geographic region.

 Exposure Risk and Transmission of M. ulcerans
Conclusions
Our examination of family clusters of M. ulcerans dis-
ease provides useful insights into the environmental res-
ervoir and mode of transmission of this organism. First, 
the median time to diagnosis between family members 
was short (2.8 months), and no family members were 
given a diagnosis of an M. ulcerans lesion >23 months 
apart in a cohort spanning 18 years and nearly 2,000 
combined years of elapsed time since diagnosis. This 
finding suggests that family members have been exposed 
to a source in the family’s environment that persists only 
for a short period.
Second, with an incubation period for M. ulcerans dis-
ease estimated to be a median of 4.5 months (12), the ob-
servation that the median time between diagnoses in family 
clusters was <3 months suggest that infections were not be-
ing transmitted between family members. Further evidence 
against human-to-human transmission is apparent from 
whole-genome SNP analysis, which showed that pairs of 
isolates from 2 (2a/2b and 1a/1b) of 3 family clusters were 
not genetically identical. These findings support previous 
suggestions that M. ulcerans is unlikely to be transmitted 
from person to person (13).
Unknown is the type of short-term exposure that leads 
to the close temporal relation of family clustered infections. 
Opossums have been proposed as a source, either through 
contamination of the environment by infected feces or by an 
intermediate vector, such as mosquitoes, which transfer the 
infection from infected opossums to humans by a bite (7). 
Infected opossum(s) in the family environment might cause 
cases of human infection, then subsequently die of the dis-
ease (14), removing the source of infection. Alternatively, 
transmission could be related to a short-term change in the 
environment involving soil or foliage as a result of such 
events as home construction and renovation, or planting 
and removing trees or grasses (13). Mosquitoes in the area 
might be transiently infected/contaminated with M. ulcer-
ans and infect humans through bites during this time (15).
In summary, the incidence rate of lesions in another 
family member (5.69/1,000 person-years) was higher than 
reported incidence rates during 2005–2009 in the general 
population of the Bellarine Peninsula (0.85–4.04 cases/
year/1,000 population) (7). This finding suggests that ge-
netic susceptibility or, more likely, localized exposure risk 
increases the likelihood of infection.
The incidence of M. ulcerans disease family clusters in 
an observational cohort in southeastern Australia was higher 
than in the general population of the disease-endemic area. 
However, when clusters occur, they are closely temporally 
related, which suggests a short-term risk for exposure and 
infection. Epidemiologic and genetic evidence suggests hu-
man-to-human transmission is not the source of infection.

Information about the Zika virus disease incubation period 
can help identify risk periods and local virus transmission. 
In 2015–2016, data from 197 symptomatic travelers with 
recent Zika virus infection indicated an estimated incuba-
tion period of 3–14 days. For symptomatic persons with 
symptoms >2 weeks after travel, transmission might be 
not travel associated.
Z
ika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted 
primarily through the bite of infected Aedes spp.mos-
quitoes. Transmission can also occur through occupational 
laboratory exposure and by intrauterine, intrapartum, or 
sexual routes (1–3).
In May 2015, Zika virus disease cases were identi-
fied in Brazil, representing the first local transmission in 
the Americas (4). Subsequently, Zika virus spread rapidly, 
resulting in >463,000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed 
cases in the Americas as of June 30, 2016 (5). This rapid 
expansion highlighted key knowledge gaps, including incu-
bation period. Characterizing the incubation period for Zika 
virus is needed for defining periods of risk and identifying 
local virus transmission. To estimate the incubation period, 
we used data from symptomatic persons who had traveled 
to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission and for 
whom laboratory evidence indicated recent infection.
The Study
We included in our analysis persons for whom samples test-
ed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 
January 1, 2015, through June 23, 2016, gave positive re-
sults, indicating recent Zika virus infection (defined as Zika 
virus RNA positivity by real-time reverse transcription or 
Zika or dengue virus positivity by IgM capture ELISA and 
confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test with a Zika 
virus–specific neutralizing antibody titer >10 and Zika virus 
titer >4-fold higher than dengue virus titer) (6,7). We re-
stricted our analysis to persons who were symptomatic, had 
known symptom onset date (onset of first symptom), had 
known travel dates from/to the continental United States, 
and were probably infected through a mosquito bite. We ex-
cluded from analysis those for whom disease was congenital 
or sexually transmitted and those reporting illness onset >2 
months after travel (because of the typically shorter incuba-
tion periods for other flavivirus diseases).
To estimate the incubation period distribution, we first 
defined the exposure period as either the duration of travel 
if a person experienced illness after return from travel or 
the time from beginning of travel to the onset of illness if 
the traveler became ill during travel (Figure 1, panel A). 
We then fit various probability distributions in R (https://
cran.r-project.org/) by using the dic.fit function in the 
coarseDataTools package, which uses methods detailed by 
Reich et al. (8). We selected the best model by using the 
Akaike information criterion. In addition to reporting fitted 
cumulative distribution function and associated 95% CIs, 
we reported certain quantiles and means. All analyses were 
conducted by using R.
For our primary analysis, we used all persons with evi-
dence of a recent Zika virus infection (primary case set). 
We then performed a secondary analysis of persons with 
confirmed Zika virus infection and <2 weeks of travel (sec-
ondary case set), enabling evaluation of our estimates by 
using more stringent case definition requirements. A con-
firmed case of Zika virus disease was illness in a symptom-
atic person with a sample that was either Zika virus RNA 
positive or Zika or dengue virus IgM positive with neutral-
izing antibodies against Zika virus only.
From January 1, 2015, through June 23, 2016, we 
identified 337 persons with evidence of recent Zika virus 
infection. Of these, we excluded 140 (42%) because they 
did not meet the study criteria (Figure 2). Among the re-
maining 197 persons, median age was 42 (range 1–81) 
years, most (119/197; 60%) were female, and 11 (6%) were 
pregnant (Table). Median length of travel was 11 (range 
2–177) days. The diagnosis of recent Zika virus infection 
was made by serologic testing for 134 (68%) persons, by 
molecular testing for 57 (29%), and by molecular and sero-
logic testing for 6 (3%).
The Weibull distribution fit our data best (parameter 
estimates in online Technical Appendix Table 1, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/5/16-1715-Techapp1.pdf). 
For the primary case set, our estimates for incubation pe-
riod were median 6.2 (95% CI 5.7––6.6) days (Figure 1, 
panel B) and mean 6.4 (95% CI 5.7–7.0) days. We estimat-
ed that, among persons in whom symptoms would develop,

they would develop in 5% by 2.1 (95% CI 1.7–2.4) days 
and in 99% by 13.6 (95% CI 13.0–14.2) days (Figure 1, 
panel B; online Technical Appendix Table 2).
Of the 112 (57%) persons who had traveled for <2 
weeks, cases were confirmed for 79 (71%). The age and 
sex distributions for these patients did not differ significant-
ly from those of the primary case set (p = 0.67 and 0.44, 
respectively) (Table). The median length of travel was 8 
(range 3–13) days. Zika virus diagnosis was confirmed by 
serologic testing for 47 (59%) patients, by molecular test-
ing for 31 (39%), and by both methods for 1 (1%).
For patients with confirmed cases, we estimated the 
median incubation period to be 5.8 (95% CI 5.0–6.7) days 
(Figure 1, panel B; online Technical Appendix Table 2) and 
the mean to be 6.0 (95% CI 5.2–6.8) days. The quantile es-
timates (5%–95%) for these patients were similar to those 
for all travelers; however, among travelers with shorter 
travel durations and confirmed Zika virus infections, symp-
toms developed within 11.8 (95% CI 10.8 –12.9 days) days 
for 99%, compared with 13.6 days for all travelers.
On the basis of our analysis, we estimate that the in-
cubation period for Zika virus is 3–14 days. We expect 
symptoms to develop within 1 week of infection for 50% 
and within 2 weeks for 99%. Our estimates for Zika virus 
incubation period are similar to those reported for other fla-
viviruses (9–12). The incubation period for Zika virus has

  Incubation Period for Zika Virus Disease
been estimated by Lessler et al., who reported data from 25 
patients with variable exposure and laboratory evidence of 
infection (13). Their estimated median incubation period 
was similar to ours, 5.9 days, but the upper limit from that 
study was 18 days, which is 6 and 7 days longer than our 
estimates for the primary and secondary case sets, respec-
tively. The difference in the upper limit was probably the 
result of the lower number of cases and higher variability in 
travel durations for their cohort.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, samples 
were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention for all patients in this analysis, although guid-
ance for testing recommended testing only persons with 
symptom onset <2 weeks after travel (14). Testing of all 
patients could have biased our sample population. Second, 
we included persons who were Zika virus IgM positive, 
considered as having recent infection. However, because 
the duration of IgM after Zika virus infection is not known, 
we might have included persons who had a prior infection 
unrelated to their most recent travel. Third, our analysis 
does not include other modes of transmission, such as sex-
ual or congenital, for which incubation periods might dif-
fer. Fourth, we cannot be sure that all cases included in the 
analysis were caused by vector transmission because sexu-
al transmission may have occurred during travel. Similarly, 
our primary case set included 11 pregnant women. Data 
suggest that the immunologic response to Zika virus infec-
tion might differ during pregnancy (15); however, in our 
analysis, the incubation periods of the pregnant women did 
not differ qualitatively from those of nonpregnant travelers.
Conclusions
According to our analysis, among Zika virus–infected 
travelers who will become symptomatic, 99% will expe-
rience symptoms within 2 weeks of exposure and 50% 
within 1 week. Persons for whom symptoms develop >2 
weeks after travel and test results for a recent Zika virus 
infection are positive should be evaluated for alternative 
modes of transmission (e.g., sexual transmission) or local 
vectorborne transmission.

After the deaths of 2 preterm neonates with Bacillus ce-
reus systemic infection in the same intensive care unit, 
we investigated the pathogenic potential of this bacterium. 
Genetic and virulence analysis indicated the neonates 
were infected with 2 different strains with a virulence po-
tential similar to environmental strains, indicating likely pa-
tient immune response failure. 
B
acillus cereus is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacte-
rium that is widespread in the environment. In adults, 
B. cereus is involved mainly in gastrointestinal infection 
and is the third most common cause of food poisoning (1). 
Rarely, this bacterium causes invasive or fatal infections in 
high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised adult pa-
tients and preterm neonates who have an immature immune 
system that is mostly restricted to innate immunity (2–4).
In 2013, two preterm infants with B. cereus infec-
tion died in the same intensive care unit. As part of the 
investigation of these deaths, we conducted genetic and 
virulence analyses of B. cereus strains from the patients 
and from the environment.
The Study
In September 2013, tracheobronchial aspiration and blood 
cultures positive for B. cereus were obtained from 2 prema-
ture newborns hospitalized in the same intensive care unit. 
An unfavorable outcome led to the infants’ deaths despite an 
appropriate treatment with wide-spectrum antibiotic drugs.
The first premature infant was female, born at 27 weeks 
and 2 days of gestation, and weighed 880 g. An emergency 
cesarean delivery was performed because of the mother’s 
preeclampsia. The Apgar score at birth was 1-2-10, with 
bagging ventilation and intubation at 5 min after birth. No 
evidence of maternal–fetal transmission of infection was 
retrieved. On day 4, signs of infection were noted in the 
newborn, including respiratory distress, tachycardia, and 
a gray skin complexion. Investigations revealed elevated 
inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein level 88 mg/L). 
Empirical intravenous antimicrobial drug therapy (cefotax-
ime, gentamicin, and vancomycin) was started.
Tracheobronchial aspiration was performed and, a 
sample grew 106 CFU/mL of B. cereus identified by ma-
trix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (MicroFlex LT; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, 
MA, USA) (log score value of 2.07 matching with B. ce-
reus reference strain DSM 31T, MALDI Biotyper v2.3). 
The blood culture remained sterile after 14 days. During 
her stay, the neonate had refractory hypoxemia due to a 
diffuse pulmonary lung parenchymal necrosis that required 
high-frequency ventilation and continuous thoracic drain. 
Despite an appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment (15 
days of vancomycin followed by fluoroquinolone), the 
neonate had chronic hypoxemia and died at 26 days of age.
The second premature neonate, born 2 days after the 
first, was male, born at 29 weeks and 4 days of gestation, 
and weighed 1,480 g. A cesarean section was performed to 
enable the mother to start chemotherapy for a maternal ma-
lignancy, diagnosed at 26 weeks of gestation. The Apgar 
score at birth was 10. Physical examination indicated no 
sign of maternal or neonatal infection. On day 4, signs of 
infection were observed in the newborn, along with respira-
tory distress. The infant was reintubated, and antimicrobial 
drug therapy (cefotaxime, gentamicin, and vancomycin) 
was started.
Blood cultures were positive after 9 hours, and sub-
cultures grew with B. cereus (log score 2.02). Catheter cul-
tures were positive and grew 106 CFU/mL of B. cereus (log 
score 2.1). On day 5, despite appropriate care and sepsis 
control, the newborn showed severe neurologic impair-
ment. Control cranial ultrasound revealed brain empyema, 
cerebral necrosis, and cranial hemorrhages (Figure 1). An 
unfavorable outcome led to the patient’s death at 8 days 
of age from multiple organ failure and cerebral abscesses.
The hospital’s infection control team looked for envi-
ronmental reservoirs as potential sources of contamination

of the 2 newborns. Therefore, ventilation equipment, bal-
loons used in manual ventilation, intravenous umbilical 
catheters, ultrasonic probes, linens (including towels and 
bedsheets), breast milk, and freeze-dried breast milk were 
collected and sent for microbiological analysis (Table 1). 
B. cereus cultures were positive for 5 environmental sam-
ples, including the surface of the incubator used for the 
first newborn (3 samples), ultrasonic probes (5 samples), 
and a bench surface used for bottle-feeding (5 samples). 
We compared all B. cereus strains, including those isolated 
from the 2 newborns, by using M13-PCR methods (5). This 
analysis revealed that the patients were infected by 2 differ-
ent strains and that the environmental strains were different 
from strains isolated from patients. These data excluded 
a clonal transmission between the 2 patients and the hy-
pothesis of a nosocomial outbreak caused by an emerging 
virulent strain (Figure 2, panel A). Nevertheless, a common 
source of infection for the 2 newborns by polyclonal strains 
cannot be excluded.
We screened the isolated strains for B. cereus main vir-
ulence factor genes hemolysin BL, nonhemolytic enterotox-
in, cytotoxin K, and hemolysin II (Table 2) by using PCR 
and toxin production assay methods (6–9). Both patient and 
environmental isolates produced toxins. We further assessed 
the virulence potential using an in vivo model of Drosoph-
ila melanogaster infection. To validate the capacity of this 
model to detect the virulence of various bacterial strains, 
we first infected wild-type flies with Escherichia coli CIP 
102181, Staphylococcus aureus CIP 110856, and B. cereus 
CIP 66.24T. We grew bacteria in Luria-Bertani broth over-
night at 37°C and subcultured them up to an optical density 
of 0.8 at 600 nm. We dipped a tungsten needle into an equal 
volume of bacterial suspension or phosphate-buffered saline 
(control) and used it to prick 20–30 adult male flies (10). All 
flies infected with S. aureus and B. cereus died after 20 and 
12 hours, respectively. Flies infected with E. coli displayed 
a survival rate similar to that of control flies, enabling us 
to validate D. melanogaster as a model for evaluating the 
strains’ virulence potential (Figure 2, panel B). 
We used the same protocol to compare all B. cereus 
strains. We found no statistical difference in survival be-
tween flies infected with the different B. cereus strains, in-
cluding B. cereus CIP 66.24T (Figure 2, panel C). These 
data correlate with the absence of a specific virulence sig-
nature for those strains (Table 2).
Conclusions 
Considering the fatal outcome of the 2 infections despite 
appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy, we addressed 
the question of a high virulence potential of the patients’

 Bacillus cereus in Preterm Neonates
B. cereus strains by testing for the presence of virulence 
factor genes and expression levels. We found a similar vir-
ulence factor profile in the patients and in the environmen-
tal strains. This profile suggested that the outcome of the 
infection was probably not linked to the virulence potential 
of the strains. 
We then used D. melanogaster as an infection model. 
We chose this model because flies rely only on innate im-
munity to survive infections, similar to preterm newborns, 
who have immature immune systems. We found that all iso-
lated B. cereus strains (patient and environmental strains) 
displayed a similar killing potential, suggesting that the fa-
tal outcome in both newborns was due not to the emergence 
of a hypervirulent strain but rather to a similar pathogenic 
potential for all B. cereus strains toward at-risk patients.
Given that B. cereus is ubiquitous in the environ-
ment and potentially fatal in preterm neonates, it appears 
critical to determine how these 2 neonates were infected 
and why they died, as well as why other preterm neonates 
hospitalized concurrently in the same room of the inten-
sive care unit remained uninfected. Further investigations 
would be necessary to determine whether the deaths were 
a consequence of an innate immune defect, a high bacte-
rial load at time of contamination, or a combination of 
both parameters.
Our study, along with previous ones (3,4,11–13), rein-
forces the idea that B. cereus is an underestimated emerging 
pathogen that can be involved in fatal healthcare-associated 
infections in premature newborns. Our results indicate that 
all B. cereus strains display potentially pathogenic proper-
ties toward at-risk patients. Considering that B. cereus is 
ubiquitous in the environment, it is essential to emphasize 
the necessity of strict hygiene measures and protocols to 
prevent bacterial transmission. Evaluating an immune re-
sponse capacity in at-risk patients must be considered to 
avoid a fatal outcome from B. cereus infection.

 After just over 75 years of penicillin’s clinical use, the world 
can see that its impact was immediate and profound. In 
1928, a chance event in Alexander Fleming’s London labo-
ratory changed the course of medicine. However, the pu-
rification and first clinical use of penicillin would take more 
than a decade. Unprecedented United States/Great Britain 
cooperation to produce penicillin was incredibly successful 
by 1943. This success overshadowed efforts to produce 
penicillin during World War II in Europe, particularly in the 
Netherlands. Information about these efforts, available 
only in the last 10–15 years, provides new insights into 
the story of the first antibiotic. Researchers in the Nether-
lands produced penicillin using their own production meth-
ods and marketed it in 1946, which eventually increased 
the penicillin supply and decreased the price. The unusual 
serendipity involved in the discovery of penicillin demon-
strates the difficulties in finding new antibiotics and should 
remind health professionals to expertly manage these ex-
traordinary medicines.
A
ccording to British hematologist and biographer Gwyn 
Macfarlane, the discovery of penicillin was “a series 
of chance events of almost unbelievable improbability” (1). 
After just over 75 years of clinical use, it is clear that peni-
cillin’s initial impact was immediate and profound. Its de-
tection completely changed the process of drug discovery, 
its large-scale production transformed the pharmaceutical 
industry, and its clinical use changed forever the therapy 
for infectious diseases. The success of penicillin production 
in Great Britain and the United States overshadowed the 
serendipity of its production and the efforts of other nations 
to produce it. Information on penicillin production in Eu-
rope during World War II, available only in the last 10–15 
years, provides new insights into penicillin’s story.
Dawn of Chemotherapy and the “Magic Bullet”
At the beginning of the 20th century, Paul Ehrlich pio-
neered the search for a chemical that would kill a microor-
ganism and leave the host unaltered—the “magic bullet.” 
Ehrlich also coined the term chemotherapy: “There must 
be planned chemical synthesis: proceeding from a chemical 
substance with recognizable activity, making derivatives 
from it, and then trying each to discover the degree of its 
activity and effectiveness. This we call chemotherapy” (2). 
 
After extensive testing, he found a drug with activity 
against the bacterium Treponema pallidum, which causes 
syphilis. The introduction of this drug, arsphenamine 
(Salvarsan), and its chemical derivative neoarsphenamine 
(Neosalvarsan) in 1910 ushered in a complete transforma-
tion of syphilis therapy and the concept of chemotherapy. 
Unfortunately, despite exhaustive searches, the promise of 
more magic bullets for microbial therapy remained elusive. 
For 20 years, Salvarsan and Neosalvarsan were the only 
chemotherapy for bacterial infections.
Alexander Fleming’s Discovery 
A chance event in a London laboratory in 1928 changed the 
course of medicine. Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist at 
St. Mary’s Hospital, had returned from a vacation when, 
while talking to a colleague, he noticed a zone around an 
invading fungus on an agar plate in which the bacteria did 
not grow. After isolating the mold and identifying it as 
belonging to the Penicillium genus, Fleming obtained an 
extract from the mold, naming its active agent penicillin. 
He determined that penicillin had an antibacterial effect on 
staphylococci and other gram-positive pathogens.
Fleming published his findings in 1929 (3). However, 
his efforts to purify the unstable compound from the extract 
proved beyond his capabilities. For a decade, no progress 
was made in isolating penicillin as a therapeutic compound. 
During that time, Fleming sent his Penicillium mold to any-
one who requested it in hopes that they might isolate peni-
cillin for clinical use. But by the early 1930s, interest had 
waned in bringing to life Paul Ehrlich’s vision of finding 
the magic bullet.
Discovery of Prontosil and Sulfa Drugs
This dismal outlook on chemotherapy began to change 
when Gerhard Domagk, a German pathologist and bacte-
riologist, found bacteriologic activity in a chemical deriva-
tive from oil dyes called sulfamidochrysoïdine (also known 
as Prontosil). This compound had bacteriologic activity in 
animals, but strangely, none in vitro. Prontosil had limited 
but definite success when used to treat patients with bacte-
rial infections, including Domagk’s own child. A German 
company patented the drug, and ultimately, Domagk won 
a Nobel Prize in 1939. The paradox of Prontosil’s in vivo 
success but lack of success in vitro was explained in 1935, 
when French scientists determined that only part of Pronto-
sil was active: sulfanilamide. In animals, Prontosil was me-
tabolized into sulfanilamide. Within 2 years, sulfanilamide

and several derivative sulfa drugs were on the market. The 
success of sulfanilamide changed the cynicism about che-
motherapy of bacteria (1).
Isolation of Penicillin at Oxford University
The success of sulfa drugs sparked interest in finding 
other agents. At Oxford University, Ernst Chain found 
Fleming’s 1929 article on penicillin and proposed to his 
supervisor, Howard Florey, that he try to isolate the com-
pound. Florey’s predecessor, George Dreyer, had written 
Fleming earlier in the 1930s for a sample of his strain 
of Penicillium to test it for bacteriophages as a possible 
reason for antibacterial activity (it had none).  However, 
the strain had been saved at Oxford. In 1939, Howard 
Florey assembled a team, including a fungal expert, Nor-
man Heatley, who worked on growing Penicillium spp. 
in large amounts, and Chain, who successfully purified 
penicillin from an extract from the mold. Florey oversaw 
the animal experiments. On May 25, 1939, the group in-
jected 8 mice with a virulent strain of Streptococcus and 
then injected 4 of them with penicillin; the other 4 mice 
were kept as untreated controls. Early the next morning, 
all control mice were dead; all treated mice were still 
alive. Chain called the results “a miracle.” The research-
ers published their findings in The Lancet in August 1940, 
describing the production, purification, and experimental 
use of penicillin that had sufficient potency to protect ani-
mals infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococ-
cus aureus, and Clostridium septique (4).
After the Oxford team had purified enough penicil-
lin, they began to test its clinical effectiveness. In Feb-
ruary 1941, the first person to receive penicillin was an 
Oxford policeman who was exhibiting a serious infec-
tion with abscesses throughout his body. The adminis-
tration of penicillin resulted in a startling improvement 
in his condition after 24 hours. The meager supply ran 
out before the policeman could be fully treated, howev-
er, and he died a few weeks later. Other patients received 
the drug with great success. The Oxford team then pub-
lished their clinical findings (5). At the time, however, 
pharmaceutical companies in Great Britain were unable 
to mass produce penicillin because of World War II 
commitments. Florey then turned to the United States 
for assistance.
Penicillin and US Involvement
In June 1941, Florey and Heatley traveled to the United 
States. Concerned about the security of taking a culture of 
the precious Penicillium mold in a vial that could be stolen, 
Heatley suggested that they smear their coats with the Peni-
cillium strain for safety on their journey. They eventually 
arrived in Peoria, Illinois, to meet with Charles Thom, the 
principal mycologist of the US Department of Agriculture, 
and Andrew Jackson Moyer, director of the department’s 
Northern Research Laboratory. Thom corrected the iden-
tification of Fleming’s mold to P. notatum; it was initially 
identified as P. rubrum (1).
Thom also recognized the rarity of this P. notatum 
strain because only 1 other strain in his collection of 
1,000 Penicillium strains produced penicillin. The strain 
that was eventually used in mass production was a third 
strain, P. chrysogenum, found in a moldy cantaloupe in 
a market, which produced 6 times more penicillin than 
Fleming’s strain. When a component of the media that 
Heatley used to grow the mold in England was unavail-
able, A.J. Moyer suggested using corn steep liquor, a 
waste product from the manufacture of cornstarch that 
was available in large quantities in the midwestern Unit-
ed States. With corn steep liquor, the investigators pro-
duced exponentially greater amounts of penicillin in the 
filtrate of the mold than the Oxford team had ever pro-
duced. Heatley remained in Peoria for 6 months to work 
on methods of growing Penicillium strains in large quan-
tities. Florey headed east to interest the US government 
and multiple drug companies in penicillin production. 
The US government took over all penicillin production 
when the United States entered World War II. Research-
ers at drug companies developed a new technique for 
producing enormous quantities of penicillin-producing 
Penicillium spp.: deep-tank fermentation. This process 
adapted a fermentation process performed in swallow 
dishes to deep tanks by bubbling air through the tank 
while agitating it with an electric stirrer to aerate and 
stimulate the growth of tremendous quantities of the 
mold. Unprecedented United States/Great Britain co-
operation for penicillin production was incredibly suc-
cessful. In 1941 the United States did not have sufficient 
stock of penicillin to treat a single patient. At the end 
of 1942, enough penicillin was available to treat fewer 
than 100 patients. By September 1943, however, the 
stock was sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Allied 
Armed Forces (6).
Public Awareness: The Fleming Myth
Early in 1942, Florey and Heatley went back to England. 
Because of the shortage of penicillin supplies coming from 
the United States, the Oxford group still had to produce 
most of the penicillin they tested and used. In August 1942, 
Fleming obtained some of the Oxford group’s supply and 
successfully treated a patient who was dying of streptococ-
cal meningitis. When the patient recovered, the cure was 
the subject of a major article in The Times newspaper in 
Great Britain, which named Oxford as the source of the 
penicillin. However, neither Florey nor Fleming was ac-
knowledged in the article, an oversight quickly corrected 
by Fleming’s boss, Sir Almroth Wright. He wrote a letter to 
850 
Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 23, No. 5, May 2017
 Discovery of Penicillin
The Times expounding on Fleming’s work and suggested 
that Fleming deserved a “laurel wreath.” Fleming happily 
talked to the press. Florey not only did not speak with the 
press but prohibited any member of the Oxford team from 
giving interviews, leading many to erroneously believe that 
Fleming alone was responsible for penicillin.
Secrecy in Wartime England
The British government went to great lengths to prevent 
the means for producing penicillin from falling into en-
emy hands. However, news about penicillin leaked out. 
A Swiss company (CIBA, Basal, Switzerland) wrote to 
Florey requesting P. notatum. Concerned about respond-
ing, Florey contacted the British government. Agents at-
tempted to track down where Fleming’s Penicillium cul-
tures had been distributed. Fleming wrote, “During the 
past 10 years I have sent out a very large number of cul-
tures of Penicillium to all sorts of places, but as far as I 
can remember NONE have gone to Germany” (7). Florey 
believed that, without the mold, no one in Germany could 
produce penicillin even though his publication had pro-
vided a “blueprint” for its small scale manufacture. Florey 
was wrong, and so was Fleming.
Fleming had sent a culture of Penicillium strains to 
“Dr. H. Schmidt” in Germany in the 1930s. Schmidt was 
unable to get strain to grow, but even though the Germans 
did not have a viable strain, other Europeans did.
Production during World War II
France
Someone at Institut Pasteur in France, had Fleming’s 
strain. In 1942, efforts began at Institut Pasteur and Rhone-
Poulenc to produce penicillin. Eventually, German officials 
found out and, in early 1944, the Germans asked the French 
for their P. notatum. They were given a false strain that did 
not produce penicillin. With limited supplies, the French 
produced only enough penicillin to treat ≈30 patients be-
fore the wars end.
The Netherlands 
The situation in the Netherlands was different. The Cen-
traalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) near Utrecht 
had the largest fungal collection in the world. A published 
list of their strains in 1937 included P. notatum. A letter 
found at CBS shows that in February 1942 the Nazis asked 
CBS to send their strain of P. notatum to Dr. Schmidt in 
Germany, mentioning penicillin in the letter. CBS told the 
Germans they did not have Fleming’s strain of P. notatum. 
In fact, they did. In the 1930s, Fleming had sent his strain 
to Johanna Westerdijk, the CBS director. Westerdijk could 
not refuse the German request for their strain of P. notatum 
but sent them the one that did not produce penicillin.
Efforts to produce penicillin in the Netherlands went 
underground at a company in Delft, the Nederladsche 
Gist-en Spiritusfabriek (the Netherlands Yeast and Spirit 
Factory, NG&SF). After the German occupation in 1940, 
NG&SF was still allowed to function. Because Delft was 
not bombed in the war, NG&SF’s efforts were unaffected. 
In early 1943, NG&SF’s executive officer, F.G. Waller, 
secretly wrote to Westerdijk at CBS, asking for any Peni-
cillium strains that produced penicillin. In January 1944, 
Westerdijk sent all of CBS’ Penicillium strains to NG&SF.
Four reports in NG&SF records detailed their ef-
forts (8). In the first report, NG&SF scientists tested 18 
Penicillium strains from CBS; they found 1 strain with 
the greatest antibacterial activity, which was coded P-6 
and was identified as P. baculatum. The second report 
discussed how NG&SF scientists then isolated an extract 
from P-6. They gave the substance in the extract the code 
name Bacinol after the species from which it was derived 
and to keep the Germans unaware of what they were do-
ing (Figure). As Waller wrote, “When we first started 
looking, in 1943, only one publication was available, that 
of Fleming in 1929. It was on that basis we started our 
research” (6). NG&SF researchers then had help from 
an unanticipated source. In 1939, Andries Querido was 
employed by NG&SF as a part-time advisor. By January 
1943, however, his Jewish background limited his vis-
its. On his last visit in the summer of 1944, Querido met 
someone in Amsterdam‘s Central Train Station who gave 
him a copy of the latest Schweizerische Medizinische 
Wochenschrift (Swiss Medical Journal), which he passed 
on to the NG&SF scientists. The June 1944 issue con-
tained an article entirely devoted to penicillin, showing 
the results that the Allies had achieved, including details 
of penicillin growth in corn steep extract, the scaling up 
of penicillin production, the measurement of strength by 
the Oxford unit, results of animal and human studies, and 
identification of the bacteria known to be susceptible to 
penicillin. The third report described how NG&SF scien-
tists isolated Bacinol from the extract using the informa-
tion supplied secretly by Querido.
Large-scale production would be difficult to do and to 
keep secret from the Germans, especially with a German 
guard on site. However, NG&SF scientists used an obvi-
ous ploy to keep the German guard, who knew nothing 
about microbiology, at bay: they kept him drunk. “We did 
have a German guard whose job it was to keep us under 
surveillance, but he liked gin, so we made sure he got 
a lot. He slept most afternoons” (6). NG&SF scientists 
used milk bottles for growing large quantities of Penicil-
lium mold. From July 1944 until March 1945, production 
of Bacinol continued, as detailed in the fourth report. At 
the end of the war, the NG&SF team still did not know 
if Bacinol was actually penicillin until they tested it

 ANOTHER DIMENSION
against some penicillin from England, proving it to be the 
same compound. NG&SF began marketing the penicil-
lin they produced in January 1946. Although the original 
building where Bacinol was produced was demolished, 
NG&SF named a new building in honor of their WWII 
 
efforts (Figure). 
The Nazis eventually succeeded in making penicillin 
by October 1944. However, Allied air raids crippled mass 
production of the drug (9).
Patents
The issue of a patent for penicillin was a controversial 
problem from the beginning. Chain believed that obtaining 
a patent was essential. Florey and others viewed patents 
as unethical for such a life-saving drug. Indeed, penicillin 
challenged the basic notion of a patent, considering it was 
a natural product produced by another living microorgan-
ism. The prevailing view Great Britain at the time was that 
a process could be patented, but the chemical could not. 
Merck (New York, NY, USA) and Andrew Jackson Moyer 
each filed patents on the process of penicillin production 
with no opposition. Eventually, at war’s end, British scien-
tists were faced with paying royalties for a discovery made 
in England. The penicillin production at NG&SF turned 
out to be more than of historical interest. Because NG&SF 
had researched and developed their own penicillin using 
their own mold culture, P. baculatum, and used their own 
production methods, they were not embroiled in any patent 
clash; the marketing of their penicillin eventually increased 
penicillin supply and decreased prices.
Nobel Prize in 1945
Penicillin’s colossal effects led to the awarding of the No-
bel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1945 to Fleming, 
Chain, and Florey. Penicillin was isolated from other mi-
croorganisms, which led to a new term, antibiotics. Using 
similar discovery and production techniques, researchers 
discovered many other antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s: 
streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, vancomy-
cin, and others.
Conclusions
Lessons can be learned from the circumstances sur-
rounding the discovery of penicillin. The US govern-
ment’s successful takeover of penicillin’s production 
and the unprecedented cooperation among drug com-
panies (and nations) should strongly encourage public/
private partnerships as we search for additional effective 
antimicrobial drugs. In addition, despite their essential 
value in modern medicine, antibiotics are also the only 
class of drugs that lose their efficacy with large-scale 
use as bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. We now are 
struggling with resistant bacteria that cause infections 
that are virtually untreatable. Infections such as those 
occurring after transplantation and surgical procedures, 
caused by these highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens, 
are threatening all progress in medicine. Yet, drug com-
panies, some of the same companies that helped develop 
penicillin, have nearly abandoned efforts to discover 
new antibiotics, finding them no longer economically 
worthwhile. The dry pipeline for new antibiotics has led

involved in the discovery of penicillin should remind us 
that new antibiotics are difficult to find and, more impor-
tant, should make us mindful when using these limited 
medical treasures.

In 1974, Lewis Thom-
as (1913–1993), physi-
cian, professor
, and dean, 
published The Lives of A 
Cell, the first of 2 books 
subtitled Notes of a Biol-
ogy Watcher
. The phrase 
“lives of a cell” refers to 
the independent yet inter-
related parts of a human 
cell—including mitochon-
dria, centrioles, and basal 
 
bodies—that once led in-
dependent 
lives. 
With-
out these previously independent lives working to-
gether
, we would not have the capacity for thought, 
communication, and movement. Dr
. Thomas wrote, 
“Our membranes hold against equilibrium, maintain 
imbalance, bank against entropy…. We are shared, 
rented and occupied.”
Our human lives do not depend just on the lives 
in our individual cells. Our lives depend fully on the 
earth, including the atmosphere, and the many oth-
er human and nonhuman lives that occupy it. In ex-
plaining this complex interdependence, Dr
. Thomas 
observed that the earth is “most like a cell.” This 
second interpretation of lives of a cell refers to the 
many interrelated earthly entities, such as plants, 
whales, humans, and even viruses, that “dart rather 
like bees from organism to organism, from plant to 
insect to mammal to me and back again,” all pro-
tected by the sky—a membrane that “works, and for 
what it is designed to accomplish it is as infallible as 
anything in nature.”
