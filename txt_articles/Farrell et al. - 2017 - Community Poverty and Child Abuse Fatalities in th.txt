abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Child maltreatment remains a problem in the United States, 
and individual poverty is a recognized risk factor for abuse. Children in impoverished 
communities are at risk for negative health outcomes, but the relationship of community 
poverty to child abuse fatalities is not known. Our objective was to evaluate the association 
between county poverty concentration and rates of fatal child abuse.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of child abuse fatalities in US 
children 0 to 4 years of age from 1999 to 2014 by using the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Compressed Mortality Files. Population and poverty statistics were obtained 
from US Census data. National child abuse fatality rates were calculated for each category 
of community poverty concentration. Multivariate negative binomial regression modeling 
assessed the relationship between county poverty concentration and child abuse fatalities.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2014, 11 149 children 0 to 4 years old died of child abuse; 45% 
(5053) were <1 year old, 56% (6283) were boys, and 58% (6480) were white. The overall 
rate of fatal child abuse was 3.5 per 100 000 children 0 to 4 years old. In the multivariate 
model, counties with the highest poverty concentration had >3 times the rate of child 
abuse fatalities compared with counties with the lowest poverty concentration (adjusted 
incidence rate ratio, 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.79).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher county poverty concentration is associated with increased rates of child 
abuse fatalities. This finding should inform public health officials in targeting high-risk 
areas for interventions and resources.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Fatal child abuse 
remains a substantial problem for young children 
in this country. Although individual poverty is a well-
recognized risk factor for child abuse, the role of 
community poverty on child abuse fatalities is not 
well described.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: Using national death 
certificate data, we noted higher rates of child abuse 
fatalities in counties with higher concentrations of 
poverty over 15 years of study. This study can inform 
public health officials targeting at-risk groups for 
interventions and resources.

Despite widespread reforms in 
child welfare practices over recent 
decades, child maltreatment, 
including physical, sexual, or 
emotional abuse and neglect, 
remains a substantial problem in the 
United States. In 2014, an estimated 
702 000 children <18 years old were 
abused or neglected.1, 
 
2 Fatal cases 
of abuse, although less common, 
disproportionally affect the youngest 
children, with 71% of fatalities 
occurring in those <3 years old.1 In 
their 2016 report to Congress, the 
Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse 
and Neglect Fatalities presented 
recommendations, including 
targeting resources to high-risk 
populations and calling for improved 
collection of data for child abuse 
fatalities.3
Individual poverty is a well-known 
risk factor for child maltreatment, 
and the role of community-
level poverty on nonfatal child 
maltreatment is becoming better 
understood.4 
– 
11 For decades, 
developmental psychologists 
have recognized that a child’s 
community and surrounding 
economic conditions are part of the 
macrosystem that affect a child’s 
growth and development.12 In 2016, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
published a policy statement on 
poverty and child health in the 
United States and stated that 
poverty contributes to many child 
health disparities, including infant 
mortality, language development, and 
injury.13 
– 
15
Despite the increasing understanding 
about the role of poverty in child 
health, including child maltreatment, 
the relationship between community 
poverty concentration and fatal child 
abuse on a national scale is not as 
well described.16 As government 
and child protective agencies strive 
to target high-risk communities 
for preventive interventions 
and resources, understanding 
community poverty concentration 
as a risk factor for fatal abuse is 
critical.17 Our objective was to 
analyze the association between 
community poverty concentration 
and child abuse fatality rates, and we 
hypothesized a positive association 
between county-level poverty 
concentration and rates of fatal 
abuse.
MeThODs
study Design and Data sources
This is a retrospective, cross-
sectional analysis of child abuse 
fatalities in US children 0 to 4 
years old from 1999 to 2014 using 
mortality data from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) Compressed Mortality Files 
(CMF), an administrative database 
maintained by the National Center 
for Health Statistics (NCHS).18 The 
CMF is comprised of death certificate 
data from 50 states and the District 
of Columbia. The NCHS calculates 
mortality statistics for each county. 
In accordance with World Health 
Organization regulations, NCHS 
classifies cause of death according 
to the International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and 
reports deaths annually.18 Population 
statistics and poverty data, reported 
as the percent of the population living 
below the federally defined poverty 
threshold, were obtained from the US 
Census Bureau.19 Because the study 
included only fatalities, it did not 
meet the definition of human subjects 
research and was deemed exempt 
from institutional review board 
approval.
study Measures
The primary study outcome was child 
abuse fatality rates. A secondary 
outcome was child abuse fatality 
rates over time. Deaths due to child 
abuse were identified within the 
CMF by external cause of injury 
codes. The use of the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Edition (ICD-9), Clinical Modification 
codes to identify cases of child abuse 
in administrative data sets has been 
previously described.7, 
 
20 Beginning 
in 1999, the CMF used ICD-10 
codes to classify cause of death. The 
external cause-of-injury mortality 
matrix, first developed for ICD-9 and 
modified for ICD-10, reports both 
mechanism of death and intent (eg, 
assault/homicide).21, 
 
22 Therefore, 
fatalities were identified in the CMF 
by using the ICD-10 codes for assault, 
consistent with the previous work to 
identify child abuse (ICD-10 codes 
X85–X92, X96–Y09, and Y87.1, which 
correspond to ICD-9 codes E960–
E969).20 To target the population 
most at risk for fatal abusive injuries 
and to avoid including victims of peer 
violence, the study population was 
limited to children 0 to 4 years old. 
National and state fatality rates were 
calculated as deaths per 100 000 
children 0 to 4 years old.19
Because our study question explores 
the association between community 
poverty and child abuse fatalities, 
the primary predictor variables were 
county poverty concentration and 
year. County poverty concentration, 
defined as percent of the population 
living below the federally defined 
poverty threshold, was categorized 
into discrete subgroups (0%–4.9%, 
5%–9.9%, 10%–14.9%, 15%–19.9%, 
and ≥20%) based on previously 
published studies.20, 
 
23, 
 
24 The federal 
poverty threshold for a family of 
4 was $17 029 in 1999 and was 
$24 250 in 2014. Fatality rates for 
each subgroup of counties were 
calculated as deaths per 100 000 
children 0 to 4 years old.
Previous researchers have noted 
the role of community racial 
demographics when studying 
socioeconomic factors and health 
outcomes. Therefore, racial 
composition of the county (defined as 
percent of the county population that 
is African American) was included a 
priori in our analysis.15, 
 
25 
–28 Children 
of non-white and non–African 
American races (including Asian or 
Pacific Islander, American Indian, or

Alaskan Native) comprised only 7% 
of the population and were included 
together as “other” races. The CMF 
began including a variable for 
Hispanic ethnicity in 1999; however, 
misclassification for this ethnic group 
on death certificates has been noted. 
As a result, this component of race/
ethnicity was not included in our 
analysis.29, 
 
30
In addition to the county-level 
primary predictor variables, we 
calculated child abuse fatality 
rates across strata of individual 
demographic variables (age, race, and 
sex). When reporting demographics, 
the race of the individual child (not 
the racial composition of the county) 
is reported. The CMF does not include 
the poverty level of the individual 
child’s family, thus, individual 
socioeconomic status is not included 
in the descriptive demographic 
results.
statistical analysis
We determined frequencies of child 
abuse deaths among US children 0 
to 4 years old and calculated annual 
rates of child abuse fatalities by 
individual demographic variable (age, 
sex, and race) and by community 
poverty concentration. We performed 
a multivariate negative binomial 
regression with fatality rate as 
the outcome and county poverty 
concentration as the independent 
variable, controlling for county 
racial composition and year. In this 
model, poverty concentration was 
modeled with indicator variables 
by using the categorized subgroups 
described above, with the lowest 
poverty concentration category set 
as the referent. Adjusted incidence 
rate ratios (aIRR) for each subsequent 
subgroup of poverty concentration 
were calculated. Because our goal was 
to study the association of community-
level poverty concentration, our 
multivariate analysis was focused 
on community-level variables. 
Collinearity diagnostics were 
performed among the variables.
As a secondary analysis, we 
estimated another negative binomial 
model with year as a piecewise 
linear function, with knots placed 
at 2007 and 2009. This model 
facilitated comparisons of the slope 
of child abuse fatality rates for the 
years before (1999–2007), during 
(2008–2009), and after (2010–2014) 
the recent economic recession. All 
analyses were performed by using 
Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX).
ResulTs
From 1999 to 2014, 11 149 children 
0 to 4 years old died of abuse. Infants 
<12 months old comprise 20% of 
US children 0 to 4 years old, but 
represent 45% (5053) of the child 
abuse deaths (Table 1). African 
American children 0 to 4 years old, 
who represent 16% of US children 0 
to 4 years old, were disproportionally 
represented among the fatalities, 
accounting for 37% (4174) in the 
child abuse fatality group (Table 1).
The national child abuse fatality rate 
for the study period was 3.5 deaths 
per 100 000 children 0 to 4 years 
old. The fatality rate for children <12 
months old was higher at 7.9 deaths 
per 100 000, compared with the 
fatality rate for children 1 to 4 years 
old (2.4/100 000; incidence rate ratio 
[IRR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 3.2–3.4) (Table 1). Boys had 
a higher fatality rate (3.9/100 000 
boys) compared with girls 
(3.1/100 000 girls; IRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 
1.2–1.3). White children had a fatality 
rate of 2.7 deaths per 100 000 white 
children. In contrast, for African 
American children, the child abuse 
fatality rate was 8.0 deaths per 
100 000 African American children 
(IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.9–3.1).
In counties with the lowest poverty 
concentration (0%–4.9%), the 
fatality rate was lowest at 1.3 deaths 
per 100 000 children. The fatality 
rate increased with each poverty 
concentration level. Fatality rates by 
age, sex, and race of the individual 
child within each subgroup of 
community poverty concentration 
are reported in Table 2. Infants 
in counties with ≥20% poverty 
concentration were at highest risk 
of fatal abuse with a fatality rate 
of 9.6 deaths per 100 000 infants 
(Table 2). The fatality rate for 
African American children in the 
counties with the lowest poverty 
concentration (5.1/100 000 African 
American children 0–4 years old) is 
higher than the fatality rate for white 
children in areas of highest poverty 
concentration (3.2/100 000 white 
children 0–4 years old).

County-level poverty concentration 
across the United States in 2010 as 
well as the state cumulative child 
abuse fatality rates from 1999 to 
2014 are displayed in Fig 1. Larger 
areas of high-poverty concentration 
are noted throughout the Southeast 
and Southwest. Higher child abuse 
fatality rates are generally noted 
in states with higher poverty 
concentration (Fig 2).
In the multivariate negative binomial 
regression model, counties with a 
higher poverty concentration were 
associated with increased aIRR for 
fatal child abuse when compared 
with counties with the lowest poverty 
concentration level of 0% to 4.9%. 
Counties with poverty concentration 
levels of 5% to 9.9% had an aIRR of 
1.80 (95% CI, 1.45–2.23) compared 
with the lowest poverty category. 
Counties with >10% poverty 
concentration had more than twice 
the incidence rate compared with 
the lowest poverty category: 10% to 
14.9% poverty concentration: aIRR, 
2.68 (95% CI, 2.16–3.32); 15% to 
19.9% poverty concentration: aIRR, 
3.03 (95% CI, 2.44–3.77); and ≥20% 
poverty concentration: aIRR, 3.03 
(95% CI, 2.43–3.79). In this model, 
counties were noted to have a slight 
increase in child abuse fatality rate 
for every percent increase in the 
African American population (aIRR, 
1.01; 95% CI, 1.01–1.01). Diagnostics 
did not demonstrate collinearity 
between the variables.
In our subanalysis excluding children 
who were victims of assault with 
a firearm, we had similar results. 
When compared with counties in the 
lowest poverty category, we had the 
following results: county poverty 
concentration, 5% to 9.9%: aIRR, 
1.78 (95% CI, 1.42–2.22); 10% to 
14.9% poverty concentration: aIRR, 
2.68 (95% CI, 2.14–3.33); 15% to 
19.9% poverty concentration: aIRR, 
2.95 (95% CI, 2.36–3.68); and ≥20% 
poverty concentration: aIRR, 2.96 
(95% CI, 2.36–3.72).
Annual child abuse fatality rates for 
each poverty concentration over time 
are presented in Fig 3, with higher 
fatality rates noted in counties with 
higher poverty concentration. Child 
abuse fatality rates demonstrated 
a small, but statistically significant 
decrease over time (aIRR, 0.98; 
95% CI, 0.97–0.98). There was no 
statistically significant difference in 
the slopes of child abuse fatality rates 
when comparing the prerecession, 
recession, and postrecession time 
periods.
DIscussIOn
This study demonstrates increased 
rates of child abuse fatalities for 
young children in communities 
of higher poverty concentration 
compared with those living in less 
impoverished areas. The greatest 
difference is observed when 
comparing counties with a poverty 
concentration <5% to counties with a 
>10% poverty concentration, where 
the incidence rate of child abuse 
fatalities is >2.5 times higher. There 
were also racial differences, with 
higher child abuse fatality rates for 
African American children compared 
with white children across all poverty 
concentrations.
The effects of poverty on children 
are wide-reaching. Health disparities 
exist for children in poverty, ranging 
from increased lead levels, increased 
revisit rates after tonsillectomy, 
structural differences in brain 
development, as well as fatalities 
from unintentional injuries.9, 
 
31 
– 
33 
Poor health outcomes, including 
increased rates of nonfatal child 
abuse have been reported when 
comparing areas of high poverty 
(>20% or >40% of population living 
in poverty) to areas of low poverty 
concentration (with substantiated 
abuse rates 4 times higher in areas of 
>40% poverty).28, 
 
32

child’s family has been recognized as 
a risk factor for abuse4,

hospitalization from abuse,

In this study, we analyzed the 
association between community 
poverty and fatal child abuse at the 
national level and demonstrated 
a consistent association between 
community poverty concentration and 
child abuse fatalities across the study 
period. These results suggest that the 
economic atmosphere where a child 
lives may be associated with their risk 
of suffering a fatal abusive injury.
Theories to explain the relationship 
between community poverty and 
child abuse cite lack of community 
resources, environmental stressors, 
differential reporting thresholds, 
and presence of factors related to 
economic success.28, 
 
39 The greatest 
difference in fatality rates was 
seen when comparing areas of low 
poverty concentration to areas of 
>10% poverty concentration. This 
suggests that, for fatal child abuse, 
there are implications for child health 
and safety even in the middle poverty 
categories, where most children in 
the United States reside. Ideally, this 
will allow public health officials to 
target high-risk areas for prevention 
and resources, rather than rely on 
post hoc responses to a particular 
tragedy.
Our results suggest that even 
in communities of low poverty 
concentration, African American 
children have higher rates of child 
abuse fatalities than white children 
who live in communities of high 
poverty concentration. With this 
data set, we cannot determine if an 
individual child victim was living 
in an impoverished neighborhood 
within a more affluent county. The 
specific effects of community poverty 
concentration by race on abuse 
fatality risk is worthy of additional 
exploration. Previous studies have 
reported increased rates of child 
abuse in minority children,

35,

African American children have also 
had higher reported risks for infant

mortality, preterm birth, and low birth 
weight, suggesting increased risk 
for several poor health outcomes.41 
Although minority children are more 
likely to be reported to child protection 
 
agencies and to have reports 
substantiated, 
42 
– 
45 comparison of 
child abuse to other negative health 
measures less subject to reporting 
bias suggests that the increased rates 
of poor health outcomes of African 
American children is not simply due 
to reporting bias.41 Thus, despite the 
potential for bias, the difference in 
child abuse fatality rates for African 
American children across each poverty 
concentration in our study warrants 
attention from health care providers.
This study contributes new findings 
to previous research by using a 
national data source to obtain 
fatality data. The 2011 Government 
Accountability Office report on child 
fatalities from maltreatment stated 
that there are many challenges to 
obtaining data on child maltreatment 
fatalities.16 To calculate the incidence 
of child maltreatment, researchers 
have historically used the National 
Child Abuse and Neglect Data 
System (NCANDS) and the National 
Incidence Study.32,

also carry limitations. NCANDS 
relies on voluntary reports from 
child protective services (CPS) in 
each state and is thus subject to 
the varying reporting practices 
of each state’s CPS agencies. The 
National Incidence Study relies on a 
nationally representative sample of 
122 counties. Our study used the CDC 
CMF, which provides national data 
from death certificates and, therefore, 
does not rely on CPS reporting 
practices or on data extrapolated from 
representative counties. The 2011 
Government Accountability Office 
report suggests that incorporating 
data on child maltreatment fatalities 
from additional sources like death 
certificates can better inform 
government agencies. Additionally, 
our study demonstrates the ability to 
use ICD-10 cause of death codes to 
target similar populations previously 
studied by using ICD-9.7, 
 
32
These findings should be considered 
in light of the limitations of the data. 
The CMF is an administrative database 
with potential for misclassification, 
and the data analysis is limited by 
the included variables. As a result, 
our study focused only on physical 
child abuse fatalities, and not on 
other forms of maltreatment, 
such as neglect (eg, malnutrition, 
medical neglect), which are not 
comprehensively captured with 
ICD-9 and ICD-10 external cause 
of injury codes. This may explain 
differences in the numbers of fatalities 
reported by other sources, such as 
NCANDS. Our data are comparable 
to previous NCANDS results when 
examining physical abuse fatalities, 
but not overall fatality rates, which 
include victims of neglect. Although 
the Vital Statistics program is a 
well-maintained reporting system, 
misclassification of a child’s age, sex, 
race, ethnicity (including Hispanic 
designation), or cause of death would 
alter these findings. The use of death 
certificate data, although a strength of 
this work, is also a limitation because 
7
it requires the medical examiner to 
identify the child as a victim of fatal 
assault. Therefore, the death counts 
are most likely an underestimate of all 
child abuse fatalities.
Racial bias has been noted in death 
certificate review when medical 
examiners are more likely to record 
the victim of a homicide as African 
American than white.46 It is also 
possible that the poverty level of 
the community could influence the 
medical examiner’s determination 
of cause of death with overreporting 
of assault in poor counties or 
underreporting in affluent counties. 
Researchers have also found census 
tracts to be more sensitive to 
economic differences than counties or 
zip codes.23, 
 
32, 
 
38 Counties are larger 
geographic areas of varying size and 
heterogeneity in each state, often 
comprised of smaller communities 
of varying poverty concentration (ie, 
a city and its suburbs). As a result, 
the county poverty concentration is 
a combination of its communities, 
which may underestimate the 
association of community poverty to 
a health outcome. Additionally, the 
CMF does not provide information on 
the individual child victim’s economic 
circumstance. Therefore, any interplay 
between the socioeconomic status of 
the individual child and other factors 
like race and ethnicity cannot be 
explored with this data set, limiting 
the analysis for Hispanic children 
and the interpretation of increased 
fatality rates seen in African American 
children in counties of different 
poverty concentrations. Finally, as 
an ecological study, we can report 
an association between community 
poverty concentration and child abuse 
fatalities, but we cannot demonstrate 
causation. Although additional 
studies are needed to additionally 
evaluate the complex interplay 
between poverty and child safety, the 
findings in this study highlight for 
pediatricians and community leaders 
the vulnerabilities faced by children in 
impoverished communities.
cOnclusIOns
By analyzing the association of 
community poverty and child 
abuse fatality rates from a source 
of national death data, we found 
that counties with high poverty 
concentration were consistently 
associated with higher child abuse 
fatality rates across more than a 
decade of study. As the pediatric 
and public health communities 
continue to learn about the 
undue burden poverty places on 
children, 
47 this work highlights 
that the poverty found in a child’s 
community is associated with an 
increased individual risk for fatal 
child abuse in young children. 
Community leaders, child advocates, 
public health officials, and health 
care professionals must consider 
community poverty when  
developing efforts to prevent  
child abuse deaths.
