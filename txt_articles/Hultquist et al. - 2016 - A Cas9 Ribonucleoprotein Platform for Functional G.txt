SUMMARY
New genetic tools are needed to understand the
functional interactions between HIV and human
host factors in primary cells. We recently developed
a method to edit the genome of primary CD4+
T cells by electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonu-
cleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we adapted this method-
ology to a high-throughput platform for the efficient,
arrayed editing of candidate host factors. CXCR4 or
CCR5 knockout cells generated with this method
are resistant to HIV infection in a tropism-dependent
manner, whereas knockout of LEDGF or TNPO3 re-
sults in a tropism-independent reduction in infection.
CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs can furthermore edit multiple
genes simultaneously, enabling studies of interac-
tions among multiple host and viral factors. Finally,
in an arrayed screen of 45 genes associated with
HIV integrase, we identified several candidate de-
pendency/restriction factors, demonstrating the po-
wer of this approach as a discovery platform. This
technology should accelerate target validation for
pharmaceutical and cell-based therapies to cure
HIV infection.
INTRODUCTION
Despite extraordinary progress in the development and distribu-
tion of antiretroviral drugs, HIV remains a worldwide health
threat, infecting millions of new people each year. Even with
strict adherence to a therapeutic regimen, patients remain
chronically infected with the virus and thus require lifelong treat-
ment (Finzi et al., 1997; Siliciano et al., 2003; Wong et al., 1997).
To date, a cure has been achieved in only a single person, the
‘‘Berlin patient.’’ In this case, the virus was eradicated by
allogeneic, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a donor
with a natural genetic variant in the CCR5 gene that prevented
HIV entry into these cells (Allers et al., 2011; H€
utter et al.,
2009). This success has motivated ongoing efforts to engineer
human immune cells that lack host factors required for HIV path-
ogenesis as a means to achieve a permanent cure (Baltimore,
1988; Deeks and McCune, 2010; Leibman and Riley, 2015).
Several clinical trials are currently underway using zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs) to delete the HIV co-receptors CXCR4 and
CCR5 to generate immune cells that are resistant to HIV infection
in a manner similar to the Berlin patient (Didigu et al., 2014; H€
utter
et al., 2009; Tebas et al., 2014). These approaches generally rely
on viral-based delivery of a ZFN-expression cassette to generate
HIV-resistant T cells or hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo (Maier
et al., 2013; Perez et al., 2008; Wilen et al., 2011; Yi et al.,
2014; Yuan et al., 2012). Autologous transplantation can then

 be used to repopulate a resistant T cell population while antire-
troviral therapies and natural immune responses clear the
remaining infection (Baltimore, 1988; Deeks and McCune,
2010; Didigu et al., 2014; DiGiusto et al., 2010; Holt et al.,
2010; Tebas et al., 2014). While these represent potentially viable
approaches, the use of viral delivery and the degree of off-target
editing that may occur over the course of long-term ZFN expres-
sion raises concerns in bringing such a treatment to the clinic
(Gabriel et al., 2011; Pattanayak et al., 2011; Thomas et al.,
2003).
The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palin-
dromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing has revo-
lutionized our ability to surgically modify the genomes of human
cells, but efficient delivery of Cas9 to primary T cells has been a
major challenge (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; Hsu et al.,
2014; Mandal et al., 2014; Ran et al., 2013). Recently, we re-
ported that we can overcome this challenge through electropo-
ration of Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) directly into primary
human CD4+ T cells isolated from the peripheral blood (Schu-
mann et al., 2015). This transient delivery of editing Cas9 RNPs
enables high efficiency ‘‘knockout’’ and ‘‘knockin’’ genome edit-
ing and could provide a high-throughput method for therapeutic
engineering of HIV-resistant human T cells. This approach
would have several benefits over the traditional methodologies
currently in trial, as it does not rely on viral delivery, does not
involve long-term expression off a nucleic acid cassette, and
has low rates of off-target editing (Kim et al., 2014; Schumann
et al., 2015). As Cas9 technology is further developed, the
efficiency and off-target rate should improve, making these ad-
vantages even more stark (Doench et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2014;
Kleinstiver et al., 2016; Slaymaker et al., 2016).
Beyond CXCR4 and CCR5, other human host factors can
affect HIV pathogenesis at different stages of viral life cycle
(Brass et al., 2008; Goff, 2007; Ko
¨ nig et al., 2008; Zhou et al.,
2008). However, functional studies of these factors have been
limited by significant technical challenges in primary cell types
and a subsequent reliance on RNAi and immortalized cell line
models (Pache et al., 2011). The limitations of these systems
underscore the need for improved technology to knock out spe-
cific gene sequences in primary human cells in a manner that is
simple, scalable, reproducible, and efficient. Systematic valida-
tion of host genes that act as HIV dependency factors could un-
veil new targets for therapeutic intervention, when targeted
either alone or in combination (Didigu et al., 2014; Voit et al.,
2013).
Here, we report a high-throughput platform for the efficient ed-
iting of host factors that control HIV infection in primary human
T cells. Arrayed delivery of Cas9 RNPs permits the rapid gener-
ation of isogenic T cells with ablated candidate factors for ex vivo
interrogation and investigation. Using this platform, we disrupted
the HIV co-receptors CXCR4 or CCR5 in multiple donors and
reproducibly generated cells resistant to infection in a tropism-
dependent manner. Targeting other dependency factors that
act after viral entry, including LEDGF or TNPO3, resulted in
reduced infection independent of tropism. Targeting CXCR4
and CD4 simultaneously, we demonstrated that this platform
also supports multiplex gene editing and can be used to
generate double-knockout cells at no cost to the efficiency of
the individual Cas9 RNPs. Finally, we used our platform to screen
146 unique Cas9 RNPs targeting 45 genes previously shown to
interact with HIV integrase, identifying novel host dependency
factors. These studies collectively demonstrate the utility of
Cas9 RNP T cell editing as an efficient means to validate host-
dependency factors in the context of viral infection and generate
HIV-resistant primary human T cells for scientific and potentially
therapeutic use.
RESULTS
A Platform for Editing HIV Host Factors in Primary
Human T Cells
Based on our previous success editing primary human T cells via
direct electroporation of Cas9 RNPs (Schumann et al., 2015), we
established a high-throughput platform for gene editing that is
fast, robust, efficient, and readily adaptable to a variety of down-
stream applications. Unique Cas9 RNPs were synthesized in
96-well format by complexing Cas9 recombinant protein with
chemically synthesized CRISPR-targeting RNAs (crRNAs) and
trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) in vitro. These were subse-
quently delivered to primary human CD4+ T cells by 96-well plate
electroporation, allowing for the rapid generation of hundreds of
unique, genetically modified pools from a single blood donor
(Figure 1). The protocols described here constitute significant
improvements to our previous methodology in not only scalabil-
ity but also enhanced efficiency, as well as improved availability,
as all reagents are commercially accessible. This platform there-
fore represents a valuable tool for the interrogation of genetic
factors involved in a myriad of human immune cell processes,
including T cell signaling, differentiation, and infection by diverse
pathogenic agents.
To test the efficacy of this platform for biological investigation,
we targeted a series of HIV host factors for genetic modification.
HIV infection has been thoroughly studied in a wide array of bio-
logical model systems, but primary cell data in a clean genetic
system are difficult to obtain and remain a gold standard in
host factor investigation. This is further complicated by variability
observed not only between donors but also between investiga-
tors, depending on the methodology used for T cell stimulation,
infection, and analysis. To account for this variability, we decided
to test our platform across multiple loci, in multiple donors, with
an array of different stimulation and infection protocols.
Briefly, CD4+ T cells were purified from human blood and acti-
vated with anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. As described above,
cells were electroporated with Cas9 RNPs, and genome editing
was validated at both the DNA and protein levels. The edited
cell populations were then subjected to functional testing with
various ex vivo HIV infection assays using both single-cycle re-
porter viruses and full molecular clones (Figure 1). Provided
that this method is efficient and specific, deletion of bona fide
host dependency factors is predicted to measurably reduce
HIV infectivity compared to control electroporation treatments.
Cas9 RNP Ablation of HIV Co-receptors Blocks Infection
HIV envelope (Env) must bind to CD4 and subsequently one of
two co-receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5, on the host cell to mediate
membrane fusion and trigger successful entry (Alkhatib et al.,
Cell Reports 17, 1438–1452, October 25, 2016
1439
 1996; Berson et al., 1996; Deng et al., 1996; Feng et al., 1996; Wu
et al., 1996). The chemokine receptor CCR5 is predominantly
used in vivo, but once an infection is established, viral variants
that use the co-receptor CXCR4 commonly evolve (Connor
et al., 1997; Moore et al., 2004). Several polymorphisms in the
CCR5 gene have been linked with limited disease progression
and even resistance to viral infection (Allers et al., 2011; H€
utter
et al., 2009; Liu et al., 1996; Samson et al., 1996). Targeted inhi-
bition of CCR5 either genetically or chemically has proven to be a
viable therapeutic route in vivo, and there is much interest in
furthering and expanding such co-receptor-based therapies (Al-
lers et al., 2011; Didigu et al., 2014; Gulick et al., 2008; Holt et al.,
2010; H€
utter et al., 2009; Tebas et al., 2014). We used our plat-
form to efficiently and specifically knock out CXCR4 or CCR5
and measured the impact of this editing on co-receptor expres-
sion and HIV infectivity across multiple donors.
We previously demonstrated editing of CXCR4 in primary
T cells (Schumann et al., 2015). Here, we aimed to test the effi-
cacy of this crRNA with our new platform across multiple donors
and measure the impact of these changes on HIV infection.
We first confirmed that CXCR4 could be reproducibly and effi-
ciently disrupted in multiple different human blood donors with
the modified 96-well plate delivery format. The percentage of
CXCR4-positive cells decreased from �90% in the unmodified-
and Cas9-protein-only control populations to �30%–40% in the
populations treated with CXCR4-targeting Cas9 RNPs in multi-
ple independent donors (Figure 2A). Editing of the DNA was
confirmed by tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis
(Table S1). Edited cells retained normal cell-surface levels of
CD4 and appropriately induced CD25 in response to stimulation
with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 beads (Figure 2B). The same holds
true when we stimulate with soluble anti-CD3/CD28 or with
PHA/IL-2 (data not shown). After stimulation, we challenged
these cells with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1LAI, which includes a GFP
marker in the place of nef, or an identical virus lacking native
Env expression but pseudotyped with pan-tropic vesicular
stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). Cells were co-stained for
CXCR4 surface expression and infection rates quantified by
flow cytometry. Unmodified cells and Cas9 control treated
(without crRNA or tracrRNA) cells showed no difference in
CXCR4 expression or infection with either virus (Figures 2B
and 2C). CXCR4 knockout cells, however, showed a substantial
decrease in CXCR4+ cells and a concurrent decrease in infection
with the CXCR4-tropic virus. Importantly, most of the cells in this
population that did become infected still expressed high levels of
CXCR4. On the other hand, CXCR4 knockout cells showed no
difference in infection with the VSV-G pseudotyped virus as
compared to the controls (Figures 2B and 2C). This was consis-
tently observed across all donors tested (Figure S1). Therefore,
these edited cells retained permissivity to HIV infection but
were rendered unsusceptible to specific viral strains in a
tropism-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that treat-
ment with Cas9 RNPs successfully ablated CXCR4 expression in
human T cells across multiple donors and imposed a specific
and targeted block to CXCR4-tropic HIV infection.
While T cells uniformly express high levels of CXCR4, T cells in
the peripheral blood generally express low to undetectable levels
of CCR5 (Lee et al., 1999). By stimulating these cells with low
levels of plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 anti-
bodies, however, we were able to induce sufficient expression
for infection and analysis (Figure 2D). We designed and tested
three CCR5 targeting crRNAs and found that two of them

Figure 1. Procedural Overview of the Multiplex Platform for Editing HIV Host Factors in Primary Human CD4+ T Cells
CD4+ T cells are isolated from donor blood by negative selection and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. Cas9 RNPs are formed in vitro by
incubating Cas9 protein with the appropriate crRNAs and tracrRNAs. These are electroporated into the activated T cells in a 96-well format to generate a polyclonal
pool of homozygous edited (dark blue), heterozygous (light blue), and unedited (white) cells. These cells are activated again and expanded. Editing is verified at the
DNA level by TIDE analysis or Sanger sequencing and at the protein level by immunostaining or immunoblot. These cells can then be infected with the appropriate
viral strain(s) and infection monitored by flow cytometry either of an integrated GFP reporter or after staining for intracellular p24. See also Table S1.

 successfully edited the CCR5 locus (Table S1). While the per-
centage of CCR5+ cells achieved by our protocol varied slightly
between donors, one of these crRNAs was able to routinely
decrease this population by �60%–80% relative to controls
(Figures 2E, 2F, and S2). As with CXCR4 targeting, we saw no
significant effects on CD4 expression or CD25 induction when
targeting CCR5 (Figures 2F and 2G). Similarly, these cells
showed resistance to HIV infection in a manner dependent on
viral tropism. CCR5-targeted cells had lower rates of infection
with the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus JR-CSF, whereas no significant
difference was observed upon infection with a VSV-G pseudo-
typed, pan-tropic virus. This was observed across multiple inde-
pendent donors (Figure S2).
Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that this platform
can be used to efficiently generate HIV-resistant edited primary
cells by targeting specific host dependency factors. These cells
respond normally to assorted stimuli and retain their permissivity
to viral replication if a pathway of infection is present indepen-
dent of the targeted host factor. More broadly, these data
validate this platform as a means to study the effects of genetic
perturbations in human T cells on HIV infection.
Validation of Candidate HIV Dependency Factors in
Primary Human T Cells
We first demonstrated the utility of this platform to efficiently and
reproducibly generate HIV-resistant primary T cells by targeted
knockout of CXCR4 and CCR5, host factors essential for virus
entry. We next wanted to test the ability of this approach to
interrogate host factors that act later in the viral life cycle whose
successful editing may also render cells resistant to early
infection. Toward this end, we decided to target the chro-
matin-associated factor LEDGF/p75, a host co-factor shown
to be important for HIV integration in several model systems
(Ciuffi et al., 2005; Fadel et al., 2014; Llano et al., 2004, 2006a;
Shun et al., 2007; Vandegraaff et al., 2006; Vandekerckhove
et al., 2006). Knockdown experiments have been difficult to
interpret due to residual functional activity of the gene (Llano
et al., 2006b), but knockout experiments in the mouse model
and in cell lines have shown some effect (Fadel et al., 2014;
Shun et al., 2007). While it is likely that there is some functional
redundancy with other host factors, the use of LEDGF by the vi-
rus is thought to influence the integration site landscape and
proviral latency (Ge
´ rard et al., 2015; Jordan et al., 2001; Llano
et al., 2004, 2006a; Shun et al., 2007; Vandegraaff et al., 2006;
Vandekerckhove et al., 2006). The inability to knock out LEDGF
in primary T cells has greatly limited the study of this factor in
ex vivo human systems.
To test the impact of LEDGF knockout in primary human
T cells, we first designed and tested an array of crRNAs with
our multiplex delivery system (Figure 3A). Of the six LEDGF
crRNAs we tested, two caused significant decreases in protein
level by immunoblot and showed editing at the DNA level by
TIDE analysis (Figure 3A; Table S1). These cell populations
were infected either with a CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 GFP reporter vi-
rus or with a VSV-G pseudotyped virus as described earlier (Fig-
ure 2D). While CXCR4 knockout specifically inhibited infection of
the CXCR4-tropic virus, we saw similar inhibition of both viruses
in the two populations where LEDGF had been depleted (Fig-
ure 3A). The level of inhibition observed is limited by not only
the percentage of cells that are effectively edited but also by
the length and MOI of the infection. To determine if we see a
more pronounced effect using different infection conditions,
we repeated these experiments using our most efficient crRNA
with a replication competent HIV-1 GFP reporter virus in a
spreading infection over 7 days (Figure 3B). Compared to con-
trols, LEDGF-targeted cells exhibited a 2- to 7-fold reduction in
viral replication across multiple blood donors three days after
infection (average 4-fold reduction, Figures 3C and S3). After
7 days of spread, these differences were even greater, with
LEDGF targeted cells exhibiting a 6- to 12-fold reduction in HIV
replication (Figure 3C). Little change was observed in cellular
viability over this time course as monitored by live-cell gating
(Figure S3). These data collectively confirm a functional role for
LEDGF/p75 in HIV infection in primary human CD4+ T cells.
Furthermore, they demonstrate the utility of this platform for
analyzing HIV host factors at later steps in infection, especially
in analyzing those factors resistant to more traditional RNAi
approaches.
We next tested ablation of three other candidate host depen-
dency factors that act at three other stages of HIV replication to
further generalize the applicability of the arrayed targeting
method: TNPO3 (required for efficient cellular trafficking by

 proper localization of CPSF6) (Brass et al., 2008; Christ et al.,
2008; De Iaco et al., 2013), NUP153 (required for nuclear import
of the pre-integration complex) (Ko
¨ nig et al., 2008; Matreyek and
Engelman, 2011), and CDK9 (required for viral gene expression)
(Mancebo et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 1997). For each gene, we de-
signed three crRNAs and tested them for knockout generation
in multiple donors by TIDE analysis at the DNA level and immu-
noblot at the protein level (Table S1). Two of the three crRNAs
for NUP153 and CDK9 reproducibly led to decreased cell
viability and cell death, consistent with essential functions for
these genes in cellular health (Albert et al., 2014; Ball and Ullman,
2005; Duheron et al., 2014; Price, 2000). The Cas9 RNPs that did
not cause cell death showed low levels of editing at the DNA level
but no depletion of the respective protein (data not shown). We
interpret these data to mean that these two genes are essential
for cellular viability and they were not assayed further. In
contrast, cells survived when the nuclear transporter TNPO3
was disrupted; two crRNAs were identified that generated inser-
tions and deletions at the TNPO3 locus with �40%–70% effi-
ciency depending on the donor (Table S1).
To directly compare the efficacy of CXCR4, TNPO3, and
LEDGF editing, we used the most efficient crRNA for each
gene to generate isogenic knockout populations in multiple, in-
dependent donors. Knockout of each factor was specific and
did not alter the protein level of the other host factors (Figure 3D).
Upon infection with a CXCR4-tropic GFP reporter virus (as in Fig-
ure 2D), CXCR4 knockout nearly ablated infection while TNPO3
and LEDGF knockout inhibited infection with �60% efficacy.
Pseudotyping the virus with VSV-G envelope was sufficient to
completely overcome the barrier CXCR4 depletion poses to
infection, but knockout of TNPO3 and LEDGF still inhibited infec-
tion by the same amount relative to controls (Figure 3D). Thus,
while some locus and donor variability in editing efficiency was
observed, this Cas9 RNP platform serves as a robust method
for disrupting key host factors at multiple stages of infection.
Cas9 RNP Multiplexing Allows for the Generation of
Double-Knockout Cells
A potential strength of using in vitro synthesized Cas9 RNPs is
the ease with which double knockouts could be generated.
Like small interfering RNA (siRNA) methodologies, simply mixing
the Cas9 RNPs prior to electroporation would be expected to
yield a mixed population of cells, some of which are doubly
modified. To test the feasibility of this approach, we attempted
to knock out both CXCR4 and CD4 by co-electroporation of their
respective Cas9 RNPs. For CD4, we designed three crRNAs
that yielded different efficiencies when electroporated with the
respective RNPs singly (Figure 4C). Immunostaining for both
CXCR4 and CD4 demonstrated specific depletion of each cell-
surface marker only when the Cas9 RNP targeting that gene
was included and furthermore demonstrated the clear accu-
mulation of a double-negative population in the multiplexed
samples (representative flow plots, Figure 4A). Comparing the
efficiency of CXCR4 knockout alone or in multiplex with the
CD4 RNPs showed no loss of knockout efficiency in both donors
tested (Figure 4B). Similarly, all CD4 RNPs demonstrated equiv-
alent efficiencies with or without inclusion of the CXCR4 RNP
(data not shown).
Several methods for delivering nucleic acid or protein to cells
result in preferential delivery of multiple reagents to the same cell
at once such that a single cell that receives one packaged mole-
cule tends to receive all others in the mixture (Ma et al., 2007).
Cas9 RNPs, however, then must direct to the chromosomal
DNA, successfully cleave their target site, and introduce a func-
tional mutation to result in a phenotypic readout, a process that
may or may not be related to cleavage success at independent
loci. Based on the efficiency of each CXCR4 and CD4 RNP
when delivered alone, and given that we see no loss in efficiency
during multiplexing, we calculated the predicted percentage of
double-knockout cells when delivering the Cas9 RNPs at a 1:1
ratio, assuming editing at each locus was independent of the
other (Figure 4C). We found that this nearly perfectly reflected
the observed percentage of double-knockout cells when stain-
ing for CD4 and CXCR4 (Figure 4C). Therefore, the generation
of double-knockout cells by Cas9 RNP multiplexing is depen-
dent on the efficiency of each individual RNP, and the probability
of editing at each locus appears to be independent.
Given the ability of this platform to generate double-knockout
cells, we decided to multiplex two of our most efficient Cas9
RNPs, against CXCR4 and LEDGF, to see if we could generate
cells doubly resistant to HIV infection. As observed with CD4
and CXCR4, we saw no loss of efficiency for either the CXCR4
or LEDGF RNPs when delivered simultaneously as opposed to
individually (Figure 4D). These cell populations were infected

Replication
(A) CD4+ T cells were isolated from the blood of two donors by negative selection and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. 146 inde-
pendent Cas9 RNPs were formed in vitro by incubating Cas9 protein with the appropriate crRNAs and tracrRNA. These were electroporated into the activated
T cells in 96-well format to generate polyclonal pools of edited cells. These cells were activated again and replica plated. Cells were infected in triplicate with
replication-competent HIV-1 (NL4-3 strain) with IRES:GFP cloned behind Nef. Every 48 hr for 6 days, half of the culture was removed to monitor infection by flow
cytometry while an equal volume of fresh media was replaced.

 with a CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 GFP reporter virus or with a VSV-G
pseudotyped virus as previously described and normalized to
the Cas9-only control (Figure 2E). As observed before (Figure 3F),
CXCR4 disruption caused cells to become almost completely
resistant to CXCR4-tropic HIV infection but had no impact on
the infectivity of the VSV-G pseudotyped virus (Figures 4B and
4C). On the other hand, LEDGF knockout resulted in a modest
decrease in the infectivity of both viruses regardless of their en-
velope, in agreement with prior results (Figures 3D, 4B, and 4C).
The cells treated with both RNPs demonstrated a dual pheno-
type, restricting the CXCR4-tropic virus as effectively as the
CXCR4 knockout cells and restricting the VSV-G pseudotyped
virus as effectively as the LEDGF knockout cells (Figures 4B
and 4C). These viral replication phenotypes are consistent with
our protein level analyses and indicate the efficient generation
of double-knockout primary T cells. This was repeated in multi-
ple, independent donors with nearly identical results (Figure S4).
Taken together, these data show that our multiplex editing plat-
form can successfully generate double-knockout populations.
Not only could this be useful for the analysis of functional redun-
dancy and epistatic relationships among genes, but such combi-
natorial editing could also be an effective tool for the generation
of multiply HIV-resistant cells for curative transplantation therapy
(Didigu et al., 2014; Voit et al., 2013).
An Arrayed Platform for Primary T Cell Genetics Using
CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs
One major benefit to this approach is the ability to perform high-
efficiency gene editing in primary T cells in an arrayed format for
screening and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Unlike
pooled CRISPR libraries that rely on selection and sequencing
for the identification of impactful genes, this system allows for
the generation of hundreds of physically distinct cellular pools
for analysis and a myriad of downstream applications. This is
especially ideal for high-throughput screens that may require
the interrogation of hundreds of genes with specific and special-
ized readouts not suitable for pooled analysis.
As proof of principle, we designed a screen of 45 genes
described in the published literature that either directly or indi-
rectly affect the function of HIV integrase. These included 21
genes supported by at least two publications in the HIV-1,
human interaction database as well as 24 genes identified by
HIV-1, human protein-protein interaction mapping by affinity-pu-
rification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Ako-Adjei et al., 2015;
Ja
¨ ger et al., 2011). Three crRNAs were designed per gene along-
side multiple non-targeting controls and several previously
analyzed crRNAs, including those targeting CXCR4 and LEDGF
as positive controls and CDK9 as a toxicity control. In total, 146
crRNAs were designed and synthesized in 96-well plate arrayed
format (Tables S1 and S2). These crRNAs were incubated with
tracrRNA and Cas9 protein to form Cas9 RNPs, which were sub-
sequently electroporated into activated primary T cells from two
donors (Figure 5A). These cells were reactivated and replica
plated into five 96-well plates. 48 hr later, one plate was lysed
for protein, one was lysed for genomic DNA, and three were in-
fected with HIV-1NL4-3 with IRES:GFP immediately following
the Nef reading frame. Every 2 days for 6 days, half of the cul-
tures were removed and fixed for analysis by automated flow cy-
tometry and the cultures supplemented with an equal volume of
fresh media (full dataset provided in Table S2).
At each time point, we observed a roughly normal distribu-
tion of infection rates tightly clustered around the median
value (Figure 5B). Cells treated with non-targeting controls
distributed evenly around the median, while the cells treated
with CXCR4 RNPs consistently resulted in the lowest rate of
infection. Any RNP that scored more or less than 1.5 SDs
from the median at any given time point was considered
significantly impactful, and the full spreading infection profile
for these hits was plotted alongside the non-targeting controls
(Figure 5C). Of the RNPs with significant effects, including the
positive control RNPs targeting validated host dependency
factors, more resulted in decreased rates of infection (1.5
SDs less than the median; red line), but some resulted in
increased rates of infection (1.5 SDs more than the median;
blue line).
For both donors, the strongest blocks to infection were
dictated by knockout of the positive controls: CXCR4, CDK9,
and LEDGF (Figure 5C). CDK9 likely exerted its effect based
on both toxicity of the editing event and specific blocks to the
HIV replication cycle. No other RNP elicited cellular toxicity
as severe as those targeting CDK9 as determined by flow cytom-
etry measuring cellular density (data not shown). GEMIN2
knockout also consistently resulted in blocks to infection in
both donors, as predicted from studies in cell lines (Hamamoto
et al., 2006; Nishitsuji et al., 2009). KPNA1, KPNA5, and
KAT2A also significantly decreased replication in at least one
donor, confirming previously published studies (Armon-Omer
et al., 2004; Gallay et al., 1997; Levin et al., 2010; Terreni et al.,
2010). FAM96B and UNC45A resulted in significant blocks to
infection as well, but no role for these proteins in HIV infection
has been published beyond an interaction with HIV integrase
(Ja
¨ ger et al., 2011).
In contrast to the above factors, SMARCB1 (INI1/SNF5) and
XRCC6 knockout both resulted in strong increases in infection
in both donors (Figure 5C). SMARCB1 is known to inhibit HIV
replication in cell lines, possibly through the stabilization of
pre-intregration complexes in non-reactive conformations (Das
et al., 2009; Maroun et al., 2006; Pyeon et al., 2015). XRCC6
(Ku70) and other components of the non-homologous end-
joining (NHEJ) pathway, however, have an unclear role in the
HIV life cycle, though some results suggest a role in post-integra-
tion expression (Baekelandt et al., 2000; Jeanson et al., 2002; Li
et al., 2001; Manic et al., 2013). These results suggest a possible
role for Ku70 as a restriction factor in primary T cells and highlight
the importance of this approach to directly test the impact of
genetic alterations in relevant primary models. Additionally,

 PLOD1, SUCLA2, HDGFRP2, and EEF1A1 each scored signifi-
cantly as a potential restriction factor in at least one of the two
donors.
Importantly, we cannot rule out the role of any gene that failed
to score as significant in this assay without validation of the
crRNAs used at the DNA and/or protein level. Conversely, corre-
lation between crRNA effectiveness at the protein level and the
functional impact on infection can provide secondary validation
in screens of untested crRNAs. For example, XRCC6 crRNA 2 re-
sulted in the most efficient knockout by immunoblot, crRNA 3
was of intermediate efficiency, and crRNA 1 was ineffective (Fig-
ures S5 and 5C). This correlates well with the spreading infection
data, where we see crRNA 2 as effective in both donors, crRNA 3
as effective in one donor, and crRNA 1 failing to score signifi-
cantly. Similar parallels are observed with UNC45A, where
crRNAs 1 and 3 are the only two to effectively result in gene
knockout by immunoblot and are the only two to result in signif-
icant inhibition of HIV infection (Figures S5 and 5C). TIDE analysis
of editing for each gene observed to alter HIV infectivity further
validated these findings. In every case, only those crRNAs that
caused a phenotypic change in infection were successful at
inducing DNA edits at the corresponding genetic loci (Table S1).
Overall, these data demonstrate the strength of this platform
for the high-throughput screening of genes directly in primary
cells. This approach has the potential to unveil a number of
new host factors playing essential roles in HIV infection and path-
ogenesis. Given the ease of use, effectiveness of editing, and
universal availability of the reagents, we hope this platform can
be broadly adapted for the study of a broad variety of T cell
processes.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we describe an efficient, high-throughput method
for systematically editing genes in primary human lymphocytes
to facilitate the study of viral host factors, T cell genetic inter-
actions, and therapeutic approaches for the cure of HIV. This
arrayed Cas9 RNP platform is notable for its efficiency, adapt-
ability, and scalability. Each reaction consists only of the primary
T cells, recombinant Cas9 protein, electroporation buffer,
tracrRNA, and crRNA. We found targeting to be robust across
different donors and different loci, with one to two of every three
crRNAs tested achieving significant editing and detectable de-
creases in protein expression. The T cells must be activated
and generally require 24 to 48 hr for recovery after electropora-
tion, but they are otherwise amenable for use in a wide variety
of downstream applications. We found minimal adverse effects
on cell replication, surface marker expression, response to stim-
ulation, or infection broadly. These experiments were performed
with 300,000 cells per reaction in 96-well plate format, but the
cell number could be even further reduced to scale up target dis-
covery efforts. Coupled to the chemical synthesis of crRNAs in
96-well plates, this platform allows for the screening of hundreds
of genes in isogenic sets of primary cells from a single donor. The
method should be readily adaptable to diverse primary human
cell types that are targets of a variety of pathogenic organisms.
In this study, we used this Cas9 RNP platform to knock out
genes that are required for HIV infection in T cells. Targeting of
the HIV co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 elicits strong protective
phenotypes to infection that strongly correlate with the effective-
ness of the RNP in a tropism-dependent manner. CCR5 has
already been developed as a target for treatment with the antire-
troviral drug maraviroc, and cell-based therapies with CCR5-
deficient cells are under development (Didigu et al., 2014; Gulick
et al., 2008; Tebas et al., 2014). However, the natural variant in
CCR5 that confers resistance to HIV may increase susceptibility
to West Nile virus, suggesting that CCR5 may have pleotropic ef-
fects on T cell function and infection with diverse pathogens
(Glass et al., 2006). Similarly, CXCR4 is essential in hematopoi-
etic stem cells but appears largely dispensable in T cells, sug-
gesting multiple roles in a cell-type-dependent manner (Berson
et al., 1996; Feng et al., 1996; Zou et al., 1998). The ability
to readily and reproducibly generate knockout cells ex vivo
provides a system for testing pleiotropic effects of these modifi-
cations, an essential consideration for the development of next-
generation therapeutics.
This approach was also successful in targeting genes required
at later stages of initial infection. Disruptions of LEDGF and
TNPO3 were well tolerated in primary T cells and both resulted
in clear defects in HIV replication. The ability to measure the
impact of LEDGF on infection demonstrates the advantage of
this technique over RNAi approaches. Even treatment with ubiq-
uitously penetrating RNAi can leave cells with persistent low
levels of target gene expression, which has complicated func-
tional validation of factors required at only low concentrations,
such as LEDGF (Llano et al., 2006a, 2006b). In contrast, Cas9
RNPs can generate true genetic knockouts in a substantial sub-
set of targeted cells. While still a heterogenous pool, a large frac-
tion of Cas9 RNP-treated cells are completely devoid of the
target protein, allowing for functional interrogation in a clean
genetic system. Furthermore, unlike siRNA electroporation, tran-
sient treatment with Cas9 RNPs generates permanent genetic
modifications in the T cells, allowing for the examination of later
time points in infection where more robust effects may be
observed.
While LEDGF and TNPO3 knockouts resulted in clear replica-
tion defects upon single-round infection, neither inhibited infec-
tion fully, even after adjusting for observed editing efficiency.
This strongly suggests alternate routes to infection may exist in-
dependent of these factors or that some level of functional
redundancy with other unidentified host factors is occurring in
primary T cells (Levin et al., 2010; Vandegraaff et al., 2006; Van-
dekerckhove et al., 2006). The ease in generating double-
knockout populations using this system makes it an attractive
platform for analyzing these redundant factors and perhaps for
systematically determining epistatic relationships among host
dependency genes to better identify gene pathways (Roguev
et al., 2013). The fact that editing at different loci appears to
occur independently of each other, however, mandates the vali-
dation of highly efficient RNPs to ensure high efficiency of double
editing. Such multiplex editing could generate cells that are
resistant to HIV infection through multiple independent mecha-
nisms, analogous to current combinatorial antiretroviral thera-
pies (Didigu et al., 2014; Voit et al., 2013).
In contrast to LEDGF and TNPO3, NUP153 and CDK9 ap-
peared essential for T cell survival ex vivo. While not unexpected,

 these results rule out therapeutic ablation of these factors. While
genes that impact cell viability or growth are obviously excluded
from this possibility, ablation of any gene would need to be stud-
ied more thoroughly in a mouse model prior to consideration for
any cell-based therapy. As mentioned above, while CXCR4 and
CCR5 deletion may not cause an obvious deficiency in vitro, de-
letions of these genes have been linked to immune defects
in vivo. One potential way around this problem is to focus on
identifying and engineering specific, naturally occurring poly-
morphisms that are known to be well tolerated and potentially
protective against infection. We have previously demonstrated
that Cas9 RNPs can generate knockin edits in primary T cells
in addition to the knockout disruptions that were the focus of
the current studies (Schumann et al., 2015). While the efficiency
of knockin edits is lower than that of knockouts, as the technol-
ogy improves, we envision this platform could be just as readily
employed to study the impact of point mutants and haplotypes
on infection.
Beyond using this CRISPR/Cas9 RNP approach to explore the
roles of known host factors, genetic relationships between
genes, and functional redundancy, the ease of scalability in per-
forming these manipulations in primary human T cells opens up
the possibility of discovery-based screening. As a proof of prin-
ciple, we screened 45 genes with known or suspected roles in
HIV integrase function as curated from principally cell-line-based
data in the literature. Beyond confirming the expected pheno-
type of several host factors in primary cells, we also uncovered
novel roles for genes with no previously published replication
phenotype, including XRCC6 and UNC45A. While much more
follow-up work remains to be done with these factors, it demon-
strates the power of the platform to achieve high-quality genetic
perturbation on the medium- to high-throughput scale.
This platform has multiple applications well beyond the identi-
fication of genes involved in HIV replication. The capacity to
perform high-content screens in human T cells allows for the ge-
netic dissection of pathways essential for immune cell effector
function in a variety of healthy and diseased states. One major
concern in applying genome editing to primary human cells
has been that CRISPR/Cas9 generates a heterogeneous mixture
of cells with various phenotypes as a result of imprecise repair
mechanisms at the targeted site (Doudna and Charpentier,
2014; Ran et al., 2013). While this platform can target genes
with 70%–90% efficiency, not every cell is edited in the final
population. Moving forward, we will need improved ways of
purifying edited cells for both research and therapeutic pur-
poses. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that we can
already link specific, edited genotypes to complex phenotypes,
including HIV infection. The efficiency of gene disruption is high
enough that we are able to observe quantitative changes in HIV
infection with multiple in vitro assays. Heterogeneously edited
cells may actually prove beneficial for experiments performed
under selective conditions, identifying genetic variants that
protect against infection while leaving normal gene function un-
perturbed. Efforts to understand these and other questions are
ongoing and promise to shed more light on the potential of
CRISPR/Cas9 technology for therapeutic purposes.
Multiplex Cas9 RNP-mediated editing of primary CD4+ T cells
is a powerful method for the study of T cell processes and the
identification and analysis of next-generation cell- and drug-
based therapies. It allows for interrogation of microbial depen-
dencies on human host genes directly in the relevant primary
cells, identifying pathways that could potentially be exploited
for therapeutic development. Specifically coupling Cas9 RNP
editing with cell-based therapies could provide a direct path
from target discovery and validation to the engineering of
therapeutic cells for the cure of HIV infection and other disease
states.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed experimental procedures and associated references are available in
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cas9 RNP-Mediated Editing of Primary Human T cells
In brief, primary CD4+ T cells were isolated from human whole blood by Ficoll
gradient centrifugation and negative selection via the Easysep Human CD4+
T cell enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies). T cells were stimulated with
bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2)
for 48 hr prior to electroporation. Electroporation was performed using the
Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 96-well Nucleofector kit and 4D-Nucleofecter (Lonza).
Recombinant S. pyogenes Cas9 protein used in this study expresses a C-ter-
minal HA tag and two nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides that facilitate
transport across the nuclear membrane. The protein was expressed and puri-
fied as described previously (Anders and Jinek, 2014) and obtained from the
QB3 Macrolab, University of California, Berkeley. Purified Cas9 protein was
stored in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) plus 150 mM potassium chloride, 10% glyc-
erol, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at �80�C. crRNA for
each gene were designed using the online tool developed by the Zhang lab
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (http://crispr.mit.edu/) (Hsu
et al., 2013). Each crRNA and the associated tracrRNA were chemically syn-
thesized (Dharmacon) and suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to generate
80 mM RNA stocks.
Cas9 RNPs were prepared fresh for each experiment. crRNA and tracrRNA
were first mixed 1:1 and incubated 30 min at 37�C to generate 40 mM crRNA:
tracrRNA duplexes. An equal volume of 40 mM Cas9-NLS was slowly added to
the crRNA:tracrRNA and incubated for 15 min at 37�C to generate 20 mM Cas9
RNPs. For each reaction, �300,000 stimulated T cells were pelleted and re-
suspended in 20 mL P3 buffer (Lonza). 3 mL of 20 mM Cas9 RNP mix was added
directly to these cells and the entire volume transferred to the 96-well reaction
cuvette. For double-editing reactions, 3 mL of each Cas9 RNP was added to
20 mL cells. Cells were electroporated using program EH-115 on the Amaxa
4D-Nucleofector (Lonza). 80 mL pre-warmed, complete RPMI was added to
each well, and the cells were allowed to recover for 30 min at 37�C. Cells
were then re-stimulated on plates coated overnight with 10 mg/mL anti-CD3
(UCHT1, Tonbo Biosciences) and 10 mg/mL anti-CD28 (CD28.2, Tonbo Biosci-
ences) for 24 hr prior to infection.
