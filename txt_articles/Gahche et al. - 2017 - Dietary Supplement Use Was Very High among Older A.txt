Abstract
Background: Dietary supplements (DSs) have the potential to be both beneficial and harmful to health, especially in adults
aged $60 y, and therefore it is important to monitor the patterns of their use.
Objective: This study evaluated DS use by adults aged $60 y to characterize the use of DSs, determine the motivations
for use, and examine the associations between the use of DSs and selected demographic, lifestyle, and health
characteristics.
Methods: Data from 3469 older adults aged $60 y from the 2011–2014 NHANES were analyzed. DSs used in the past
30 d were ascertained via an interviewer-administered questionnaire in participants� homes. The prevalence of overall DS
use and specific types of DSs were estimated. The number of DSs reported and the frequency, duration, and motivation(s)
for use were assessed. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association between DS use and
selected characteristics.
Results: Seventy percent of older adults in the United States reported using $1 DS in the past 30 d; 54% of users took 1 or
2 products, and 29% reported taking $4 products. The most frequently reported products were multivitamin or mineral
(MVM) (39%), vitamin D only (26%), and omega-3 fatty acids (22%). Women used DSs almost twice as often as men
[adjusted OR (aOR), 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.3). Those not reporting prescription medications were less likely to take a DS than
those reporting $3 prescription medications (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.6). The most frequently reported motivation for DS
use was to improve overall health (41%).
Conclusions: Use of DSs among older adults continues to be high in the United States, with 29% of users regularly taking $4
DSs, and there is a high concurrent usage of them with prescription medications.

Introduction
By 2030, persons aged $65 y are expected to account for 20%
of the US population (1). Aging is often accompanied by
increased nutritional risk that can cause or exacerbate health
conditions. Undernutrition in older adults can be due to reduced
energy and food intake, biological changes in the digestive
system, medical and psychological conditions, polypharmacy,
and social issues such as poverty and the inability to shop and
prepare meals (2). In the United States, dietary supplement (DS)
use is widespread, with over half of adults reporting use, and the
highest use reported in older adults (3–5). DSs can provide
nutrients that may be lacking or inadequate in the diet and can
help older adults meet recommended intake targets. DSs may be
needed to meet nutrient requirements, particularly for nutrients
that are not ubiquitous in the food supply, such as vitamin D (6,
7). However, the additional nutrients provided by DSs can also
potentially lead to intakes exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake
Level (UL), especially for nutrients that are fortified in the US
food supply (6–8). Moreover, some botanical and herbal DSs
cause adverse reactions with prescription and over-the-counter
drugs (9). The high concurrent use of prescription medications
and DSs in older adults may increase the risk of drug-nutrient
and other drug-supplement interactions (10–12). Thus, DSs
have the potential to be both beneficial and harmful to health,
and it is important to monitor usage patterns in this rapidly

 growing segment of the US population aged $60 y. The purpose
of this study was to characterize the use of DSs among older
adults with the use of the nationally representative data from the
NHANES and relate their use to selected demographic, behav-
ioral and health characteristics in that population.
Methods
Survey description. NHANES is a nationally representative sample of
the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NHANES uses a com-
plex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design. Certain
population groups are oversampled to increase the precision of estimates
for these subgroups, including non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-
Hispanic Asians. Non-Hispanic whites and those classified as ‘‘other’’
were oversampled on specific subdomains for low-income and for older
adults $80 y of age. Information on the NHANES sample design can be
found elsewhere (13). Survey participants were asked to complete an
in-person home interview and a health examination conducted in a
mobile examination center. The NCHS Ethics Review Board approved
the survey protocol and materials, and all adult participants provided
written informed consent.
This analysis was completed with the use of combined data from
NHANES 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014. The NCHS recom-
mends that analysts combine $4 years of data to improve the reliability
and stability of statistical estimates (14). The unweighted response rate
for interviewed and examined older adults aged $60 y was 56.9% in
2011–2012 and 57.8% in 2013–2014 (15, 16). The NHANES 2011–
2014 examined a sample of 19,151 participants of all ages, and for the
present study, those aged <60 y (n = 15,679) and those with unknown or
missing DS information (n = 3) were excluded. The final analytic sample
was n = 3469.
Covariates. Demographic, lifestyle, and health history information was
collected during the interviewer-administered questionnaire in the
participants� homes. Measured height and weight were used to calculate
BMI (in kg/m2), and classifications were used as follows: obese ($30.0),
overweight (25.0–29.9), normal weight (18.5–24.9), and underweight
(<18.5) (17). Demographic data included sex, age, race and Hispanic
origin, educational attainment, and income. Age groups were defined as
60–69, 70–79, and $80 y. Self-reported race and Hispanic origin groups
are defined in the 2011–2014 NHANES as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and ‘‘other’’ (‘‘other’’
includes multiracial). Following the NCHS recommendations, the
‘‘other’’ group is represented in the estimates for the total sample, but
is not presented separately as a group. Educational level was categorized
as completion of less than high school (HS), HS diploma or general
equivalency diploma, or past HS. Income was defined with the use of the
family income-to-poverty level ratio (FIPR), which is a measure of
socioeconomic status that represents the ratio of household income to
the US poverty guidelines after adjustments for inflation and family size.
The FIPR was calculated by dividing family income by the Department
of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines specific for family size
and geographical location (18). Three FIPR categories were constructed
as follows: <130%, 130–349%, and $350%. These cutoffs are
consistent with eligibility for major food assistance programs that use
<130% of the poverty line as the criterion.
Behavioral or lifestyle characteristics included self-reported current
usual physical activity, health status, cigarette smoking, and alcohol
consumption. Self-reported physical activity for a typical week was
assessed with the use of a physical activity questionnaire based on the
Global Physical Activity Questionnaire developed by the WHO. Physical
activity was classified as none, moderate (<300 min of moderate or
vigorous activity/wk), or vigorous ($300 min of moderate or vigorous
activity/wk). Alcohol use was assessed with the use of 3 questions that
ascertained use in the last 12 mo, frequency, and number of drinks. A
drink was defined at the time of the interview as a 354-mL glass of beer, a
148-mL glass of wine, or 44 mL of liquor. The mean daily drink number
was calculated as the number of days a participant reported drinking in
the past 12 mo multiplied by the usual number of drinks that were
consumed and then divided by the total number of days. The mean daily
number of drinks were categorized as none, <1 (but >0), 1 to <2, or
$2 drinks/d (19). Smoking status was defined as those who responded
yes to smoking $100 cigarettes during their lifetime and those who
reported that they currently smoked every day or nearly every day.
Smoking status was categorized as never, former, or current.
Health status and health history characteristics included current
health status, insurance status at the time of the household interview,
health care visits in the past 12 mo, and number of prescription
medications taken in the past 30 d. Self-reported current health status
was classified as excellent or very good and good versus fair or poor. The
number of health care visits in the past 12 mo was categorized as 0–
1 times, 2–3 times, and $4 times. Health insurance coverage at the time
of the survey was categorized as private (including persons covered by
public and private plans), public, and uninsured (20). The number of
prescription medications was calculated with the use of the question ‘‘In
the past 30 d, have you used or taken medication for which a prescription
is needed?’’ Respondents who answered affirmatively were asked to
show the interviewer all medication labels, and an interviewer recorded
the exact product name from the medication container label. If the
container was unavailable, the participant verbally reported this
information. For this analysis, the number of prescription medications
reported by participants were summed and categorized as 0, 1–2, and $3
different prescription medications taken in the past 30 d.
DS data. Detailed information on the use of all types of prescription and
nonprescription DS products was collected during the household
interview. Participants were asked to recall all vitamins, minerals, herbs,
botanicals, and other types of DSs that were used during the past 30 d.
Interviewers asked the participant to show them product containers if
they were available; containers were seen for 86% of the reported DSs
for older adults $60 y of age. Information about product name,
frequency and duration of use, dosage, and the motivation(s) for use
were recorded for each DS reported during the interview. Collection
procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (5, 21, 22). DS
categories were then constructed based on nutrient content, product
names, and descriptive characteristics commonly used in marketing
(Supplemental Table 5). Subcategories were constructed to allow for
more specific analyses of products most commonly reported by older
adults. The specific types of products were chosen for presentation due
to their high frequency of use and their importance to older adult
nutritional status (23). Motivations for use were based on a categorical
question in which participants were shown a hand card with the
categories, could select >1 motivation, and could provide motivations
not listed on the hand card. More information on how these data were
collected and prepared for data files are available in the NHANES DS
documentation for NHANES cycles 2011–2012 (21) and 2013–2014
(22). Motivations reported by >2% of users are presented. The less
frequently reported motivations are not presented, but they included
reasons such as for weight loss, for antioxidants, to maintain blood sugar
(diabetes), for respiratory health, for allergies, to improve digestion, for
relaxation (decrease stress), for the nervous system, for liver health
(detoxification), for thyroid health (goiter), to build muscle, and
stimulated by word of mouth. The ‘‘other’’ category represents a small
number of motivations that could not be added to the predefined
categories or motivations that were reported by a small number of
participants and not analyzed.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with the use
of SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.) and SAS-callable
SUDAAN (version 11.0; Research Triangle Institute) to account for the
complex survey design. The examination weights were used for all
analyses to account for oversampling and survey nonresponse and are
poststratified to US Census Bureau population estimates. SEs for
prevalence estimates were approximated by Taylor series linearization.
Prevalence estimates are provided for types of DSs, number, frequency,
duration, and motivation(s). Geometric means were estimated for
number of DSs taken to account for the skewed distribution. Statisti-
cal testing of differences between groups were assessed with the use of

 two-sided Student�s t tests. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust for
multiple comparisons. To test for linear trends, the null hypothesis of a
nonlinear trend was examined with the use of orthogonal polynomials,
with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. Values presented have a
relative SE #30% unless otherwise noted.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association
between DS use and demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics.
Adjusted ORs (aORs) and 95% CIs for the probability of DS use were
calculated for each predictor to explain the strength of the association
after controlling for sex, age group, race and Hispanic origin, educational
attainment, physical activity, health status, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, and number of prescription medications reported in the
past 30 d. To test for trends, the median was assigned for each category
in which the variable was originally continuous and then treating the
variable as continuous. For variables that were originally nominal or
ordinal, integer scores were assigned and then treated as continuous.
Logistic regression was based on a smaller sample size of the participants
with complete data on all covariates (n = 3227).
Results
Seventy percent of older US adults reported using $1 DS, with
significantly higher use reported among women (76%) than men
(62%) (Table 1). For both sexes, those in the older age groups
reported higher use than those in the youngest age group (60–69 y).
The most commonly reported DSs for both men and women
included multivitamin or mineral (MVM) supplements (39%),
vitamin D supplements (26%), omega-3 FA supplements
(22%), and B-complex and B vitamins (16%) (Tables 1 and 2).
Calcium and vitamin D (13%), vitamin C (11%), calcium-only
(9%), and botanical or herbal (9%) supplement use was also
reported by many older adults. The prevalence of MVM,
B-complex and B vitamins, calcium and/or vitamin D, vitamin E,
iron, and magnesium supplement use was significantly higher in
women than men (Table 1). In contrast, the prevalence of
selected nonvitamin or nonmineral DS use did not differ by sex
or age group (Table 2).
Thirty-one percent of DS users reported taking only 1 sup-
plement in the past 30 d, 23% took 2, 17% took 3, and 29%
took $4 (Supplemental Table 2). More women took >1 DS than
men (P < 0.05), and women used more DSs (mean number of
DSs was 2.47 compared with 2.16; P < 0.05) than men. The
mean number of supplements taken did not differ by age group.
Users tended to report taking DSs regularly, with $79% of older
adults reporting daily use of the most commonly reported
products (Supplemental Table 3). The number of months of use
differed among types of DS products. Notable supplements
taken for $10 years included vitamin C products (63%), MVM
products (48%), vitamin B-12 products (25%), v-3 FA products
(23%), and botanical products (22%).
Analysis of the characteristics of DS users revealed consistent
patterns for DS use. The use of any type of DS was significantly
higher for those in the older age groups (70–79 and $80 y) than
those in the youngest age group (60–69 y) (Supplemental Table
1). The prevalence of use of any DS, MVM, calcium and/or
vitamin D products, v-3 FA products, vitamin C, and glucosa-
mine or chondroitin products was significantly higher in non-
Hispanic white users than non-Hispanic black and Hispanics
users, but not Asian users, who tended to report using DSs at a
frequency similar to that of non-Hispanic white users. For most
of the DS product types, prevalence was highest for those who
had higher educational attainment, higher income, private
insurance, $2 health care visits in the past 12 mo, were
nonsmokers, reported at least some physical activity, and who
reported excellent or very good health status and were taking

 $1 prescription medication in the past 30 d. In contrast, DS use
in general did not significantly differ by weight status or
whether a person lived alone. Multivariate adjusted analysis
(Table 3) confirmed many of the descriptive findings with regard
to patterns of use by sex, race and Hispanic origin, and types of
products used by sex, and they also revealed some novel
findings. Those who reported excellent or very good health
status were more likely than those who reported fair or poor
health status to take MVM products (aOR; 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1,
2.2), v-3 FA products (aOR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3), vitamin C
products (aOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.2), and glucosamine or
chondroitin products (aOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.4). Interest-
ingly, those reporting 0 prescription medications were less likely
than those reporting $3 prescription medications to report using
$1 DS (aOR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.6), MVM product (aOR: 0.5;
95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), and calcium and/or vitamin D product (aOR:
0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 0.9).
The most frequently reported motivations for use of DSs were
as follows: to improve overall health (41%), for bone health
(37%), to maintain health (36%), to supplement the diet (22%),
and for heart health and cholesterol (22%) (Table 4). Compared
with men, women reported a higher frequency of taking $1 DS
for bone health (47% compared with 22%), for eye health (11%
compared with 6%), and for muscle-related issues (5% com-
pared with 2%). The use of DSs to improve overall health and
for bone health were the 2 most popular motivations across all
race and Hispanic-origin groups. The use of DSs to prevent
colds, boost the immune system, for healthy skin, hair, and nails,
and to maintain healthy blood decreased with age, whereas the
use of DSs for eye health increased with age. Most DSs were not
used under the recommendation of a health care practitioner
(e.g., physician, nurse, or dietitian), but over half of calcium and
vitamin D products, vitamin D–only products, iron products,
and fiber products reported were taken at the recommendation
of a health care professional (Supplemental Table 4).
Discussion
These nationally representative data indicate that the majority of
older adults are using DSs, primarily micronutrient DSs. Similar
to previous reports, we found that women are more likely to take
most DSs than men (24–29). There were also differences in DS
use by race and Hispanic origin, with the highest DS use found in
non-Hispanic white adults and non-Hispanic Asian adults. DS use
was also higher for those with higher educational attainment and
higher income. Lower income groups of older Americans, such
as non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subgroups, may be food
insecure, vulnerable to undernutrition, and may not be meeting
expert recommendations for certain nutrients of concern (30). For
such vulnerable subgroups, micronutrient DSs may help to meet
dietary recommendations. Yet these are the very groups who were
least likely to use micronutrient-containing DSs.
We found, as have others, that there is high concurrent use of
DSs and prescription medications (10, 11, 26, 31, 32). The 73%
of older adults who were taking $3 prescription medications
were more likely to report taking a DS than those that reported
taking 0 prescription medications. Furthermore, 8% of older
adults who reported taking $3 prescription medications were
also taking $1 botanical DS product. Most DSs are not
prescribed by health care practitioners, and DS use is not
routinely discussed during health care visits (33). Therefore, it is
unlikely that anticipatory guidance about DS use with prescrip-
tion medications is routinely being provided to patients, partic-
ularly for those with polypharmacy both for prescription drugs
and botanical DSs. Herb-drug interactions could enhance or negate
the other�s effects or could modulate the activity of enzymes and
drug transporters (34).
The DRI reports recognize that DSs may be necessary to help
older adults supplement their diets and fill nutrient gaps to
increase the likelihood of achieving recommended intakes,
specifically for vitamins D and B-12 and for calcium. However,
we found that older adults were using DSs primarily not for this
purpose of supplementing the diet, but rather for other health-
related reasons. For example, the most common reason for
taking MVM was to improve health, the second and third reasons
were for bone health and to maintain health, respectively, and the
fourth reason was to supplement the respondent�s diet (Supple-
mental Table 4). MVM products currently on the market,
depending on their formulation, may provide nutrients in
amounts that help older adults to meet dietary recommenda-
tions, which is the intended use of the products (35). For
example, Bailey et al. (7) found that supplementation with folic
acid, vitamin C, vitamin B-6, vitamin A, and vitamin E reduced
the prevalence of dietary inadequacy significantly in older adults
aged $71 y. Most of these vitamins were present in MVM

 nationally representative study on MVM products and therefore
may not provide nutrients in amounts that improve intake (36).
Other over-the-counter products, such as calcium and calcium–
vitamin D combinations and prescription potassium supple-
ments, may instead provide the amounts necessary to meet
recommendations when dietary measures do not suffice. Al-
though MVMs and other DSs containing micronutrients may fill
dietary gaps for some nutrients, they may increase the risk of
exceeding the UL for nutrients that are present in highly fortified
US foods. Bailey et al. (7) found that the prevalence of older
adults aged $71 y taking DSs who met or exceeded the UL was
;7% for folic acid, 3% for vitamin A, and 4% for vitamin B-6.
In addition, 19% of men and 8% of women aged $71 y taking
DSs met or exceeded the UL for iron, with <0.5% meeting or
exceeding the UL from diet alone (8). The formulations of
MVMs, particularly for older adults, need review and ration-
alization if they are to fill common nutrient gaps in dietary
intakes while avoiding nutrient excess.
The evidence that any DS prevents chronic diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancers, remains weak although
it is an area that deserves continued research. Nevertheless, nearly
40% of US adults aged $60 y in our study used MVM to
maintain and improve their health, despite inconclusive evidence
that they prevented chronic disease. After systematic evidence
reviews of the literatures, the US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) concluded that evidence was insufficient that vitamin
and mineral supplements were useful for preventing cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) or cancer (37). However, in 2013 when
the review was done, only 2 randomized clinical trials (The
Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants and
Physicians’ Health Study II) were available that assessed CVD
and cancer outcomes. Although there was no significant reduc-
tion in risk from most types of fatal and nonfatal CVD, there
was a small but significant reduction in total cancer incidence
among men, particularly those with a history of cancer. Limited
data were available for women and cancer or CVD. The
majority of observational studies have not shown an association
between MVM use and CVD incidence or mortality, with the
exception of the Nurse�s Health Study, in which the risk of
coronary heart disease was reduced by 24% for women who
took multivitamins [reviewed in Angelo et al. (38)]. MVM use
and cancer incidence or mortality have been mixed, however,
most of the research to date that used data from cohort studies
have not found an association (38).
Compared with our study, DS use among older adults in the
United States has increased slightly from 63.3% (SE: 1.7%) in
NHANES 1999–2000 to 69.7% (SE: 1.4%) in NHANES 2011–
2014 (38). The use of vitamin B-12 products and iron products
has increased, the use of vitamin C and E products decreased,
and MVM, B-complex, calcium-only, and folic acid use has been
consistent compared with estimates from NHANES 1999–2000
(39). Additionally, Kantor et al. (3) found a significant increase
in the use of vitamin D products among older adults aged $65 y
from NHANES 1999–2000 to NHANES 2011–2012. These
changes may reflect recommendations put forth in more recent
years for certain nutrients and could also reflect reporting of
research findings on DSs. However, this is speculative, because
NHANES data cannot be used to answer questions such as the
changing of behaviors over time. These findings underscore the
need for continuous monitoring of DS use in the population.
This study has several strengths, including the national
representativeness of NHANES DS data. Also, although poly-
pharmacy for prescription drugs and DS use have been reported
in other studies of older adults, the characterization of the type

 of DS with verification of the product containers to confirm their
identity and the details on the amounts consumed were lacking
(10, 26). In NHANES, a high percentage of product containers
were seen by interviewers, allowing for accurate transcription of
product names compared with self-report, which then provided
more information for accurate product label acquisition from
manufacturers and more precise estimation of DS exposures.
The limitations of our study include the fact that total dietary
intakes of nutrients from DSs and other foods and beverages were
not estimated, and therefore the proportion of the population not
reaching the Estimated Average Requirement or >UL could not be
provided. Future work should address this and provide more
recent estimates for older adults. Another limitation is the
relatively low response rate for older adults, which was 56.9%
in 2011–2012 and 57.8% in 2013–2014. Finally, although DS
containers were seen for 87% of reported products, interviewer
error or omissions in recording information cannot be ruled out.
In conclusion, the prevalence of DS use, often of several
products, was high among older adults in the United States.
Almost one-third of the older adults reported using $4 types of
DSs in the past 30 d. These products were generally taken
regularly and for many years. Most of the products used
contained micronutrients. Some DSs (such as calcium, vitamin
D, and vitamin B-12) may fill gaps in older adults� food intakes
that may be inadequate. Others, however, may contain high
amounts of micronutrients like folic acid or vitamin A that are
also fortified in the food supply, which may increase risks of
intakes that exceed the UL. The risk of adverse reactions due to
interactions is increased when these and other DSs containing
high amounts of certain botanicals or other nonvitamin or
nonmineral supplements are used concurrently with many
prescription medications. Health care professionals should be
aware of DS use in their patients and should monitor their use
for safety and possible nutrient–drug interactions.
