Abstract
Background
Tobacco consumption is the largest avoidable health risk. Understanding changes of smok-
ing over time and across populations is crucial to implementing health policies. We evalu-
ated trends in smoking initiation between 1970 and 2009 in random samples of European
populations.
Methods
We pooled data from six multicentre studies involved in the Ageing Lungs in European
Cohorts consortium, including overall 119,104 subjects from 17 countries (range of median
ages across studies: 33–52 years). We estimated retrospectively trends in the rates of
smoking initiation (uptake of regular smoking) by age group, and tested birth cohort effects

National funders who supported data collection in
the original cohort and cross-sectional studies are
 using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) modelling. We stratified all analyses by sex and region
(North, East, South, West Europe).
Results
Smoking initiation during late adolescence (16–20 years) declined for both sexes and in all
regions (except for South Europe, where decline levelled off after 1990). By the late 2000s,
rates of initiation during late adolescence were still high (40–80 per 1000/year) in East,
South, and West Europe compared to North Europe (20 per 1000/year). Smoking initiation
rates during early adolescence (11–15 years) showed a marked increase after 1990 in all
regions (except for North European males) but especially in West Europe, where they
reached 40 per 1000/year around 2005. APC models supported birth cohort effects in the
youngest cohorts.
Conclusion
Smoking initiation is still unacceptably high among European adolescents, and increasing
rates among those aged 15 or less deserve attention. Reducing initiation in adolescents is
fundamental, since youngsters are particularly vulnerable to nicotine addiction and tobacco
adverse effects.
Introduction
Smoking is still the leading cause of avoidable mortality and the strongest modifiable risk fac-
tor for respiratory and allergic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.[1–3] The preva-
lence of smoking has been, and still is, declining in Europe, which is mainly related to more
restrictive national regulations that have been introduced over time.[1,4,5] The Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control is giving further boost to the global fight against smoking.[2]
Still, more needs to be done, and understanding trends of tobacco habits over time and across
populations is essential to implementing further effective public health policies.
The prevalence of smoking within a population depends on the rates of smoking initiation,
cessation, and smoking-related mortality. Most scientific publications on tobacco use report
prevalence figures, and only few provide data on age at smoking initiation.[1,2,4,6–8] Teasing
out the trends in smoking initiation is especially important to develop primary preventive
strategies.
According to the 2015 Eurobarometer special report, 19% of European smokers start before
the age of 15 years.[1] Early tobacco exposure is particularly damaging, as individuals are more
vulnerable to tobacco effects in the stages of growth than when organ systems are fully devel-
oped, and emerging evidence suggests that exposure in early puberty may have an impact on
health across generations.[9–11] Young adolescents are particularly susceptible to nicotine
addiction.[12] The World Health Organization recommends monitoring tobacco use in the
13–15 year-old population, but data on smoking in early adolescence are still scarce.[1,2,6,
7,13] In 2013, the World Health Assembly endorsed an action for a 30% worldwide reduction
in the prevalence of smoking by 2025, but young adolescents were not mentioned, which may
be related to the lack of data in this age group.[14]
Given the gap in knowledge on this important public health issue, we investigated the time
trends in the uptake of regular smoking over 1970–2009 in Europe. We aimed at identifying

Methods
Study design and population
We used the data from six large-scale multicentre studies on random samples of the general
population in Europe, which were available in the Ageing Lungs in European Cohorts (ALEC)
consortium (http://www.alecstudy.org/) (S1 Fig).
The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) is an international cohort
study performed on subjects aged 20–44 years at enrolment in 1991–1994.[15] In ECRHS I,
random samples of subjects participating in a postal screening (stage 1) took part in a clinical
interview (stage 2), where they reported information on their smoking habits for the first time.
The cohort of participants in stage 2 (labelled “ECRHS clinical” throughout the manuscript)
was reassessed at two independent follow-up examinations during 1999–2002 in ECRHS II,
[16] and during 2010–2013 in ECRHS III (www.ecrhs.org). ECRHS-Italy is the postal follow-
up of the Italian participants in ECRHS I stage 1 carried out in 1998–2001 and 2008–2009.[17]
The Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) study is the postal follow-up of the
ECRHS I stage 1 participants from the Nordic centres.[18] We used the RHINE data collected
in 2010–2012 only, because age at initiation had been assessed using a different question in
1999–2001. S2 Fig describes how ECRHS clinical, ECRHS Italy and RHINE stem from the
ECRHS study. The Global Allergy and Asthma Network of Excellence (GA2LEN) study is an
international cross-sectional study carried out in Europe in 2007–2009.[19] The Italian Study
on Asthma in Young Adults (ISAYA) is a cohort study (baseline: 1998–2000; follow-up: 2008–
2009), and the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases study (GEIRD) is a
cross-sectional study carried out in Italy (2005–2010).[17,20]
We used data on smoking from postal questionnaires for all studies, in addition to data
from clinical interviews in ECRHS. Subjects who had participated in more than one study (or
more than one occasion in multi-wave studies) were only considered once.
In each study, one or more random samples of the population were available per centre (S1
Table). In the main analysis, we included subjects from 79 samples from 17 countries with par-
ticipation rates above 25% (Table 1), and discarded four samples with lower participation
rates. We classified the samples into four regions corresponding to the United Nations
geoscheme and tobacco epidemiology:[21] North Europe (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Nor-
way, Sweden, UK), East Europe (Estonia, Macedonia, Poland), South Europe (Italy, Portugal,
Spain) and West Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland).
Data on smoking
We defined “ever smoking regularly” using the question “Have you ever smoked for as long as
a year?”, except for RHINE where subjects identified themselves as “smokers” or “ex-smokers”
without reference to duration (“for as long as a year”) (Table 2). Each study reported slightly
different instructions, however most questionnaires specified that “ever smoking for as long as
a year” referred to having smoked “at least one cigarette per day or one cigar per week for one
year”. In all the studies, age at initiation was collected only among ever smokers using the
question “How old were you when you started smoking?”; we used the first information avail-
able for subjects with follow-up data.
In order to assess the impact of the retrospective assessment of smoking initiation, we com-
pared age at initiation at different waves of cohort studies (S1 Appendix). This analysis showed

 a fairly good correlation of age at initiation reported up to twenty years apart, and that preci-
sion was higher when age at initiation was derived using the first information available.
Statistical analysis
We performed both the age-stratified analysis and APC modelling on data pooled across all
the studies, with the analyses stratified by sex and European region. Subjects with missing
information on smoking status or age at initiation were deleted listwise. All the analyses were
performed using STATA 14 (Stata Corp. College Station, TX, USA).

 Rates of smoking initiation (per 1000/year) were calculated retrospectively from childhood
to the most recent assessment, as the ratio between the number of incident smokers (subjects
taking up regular smoking) and total time at risk (person-years). Subjects were considered at
risk from age 11 years to age at initiation, age at the last study, or age 35, whichever came first,
since our data showed that 0.9% of smokers started before the age of 11, and only 0.7% after
the age of 35.
Age-stratified analysis.
We estimated smoothed trends in smoking initiation rates (with
95% confidence intervals) over the period 1970–2009, using two-level mixed-effects general-
ized linear models with subjects nested into samples. We used a negative binomial outcome
distribution, a logarithmic link function, and an offset for log person-years. These analyses
were further stratified into three age groups, which we refer to as young adolescents (11–15
years), late adolescents (16–20 years), and young adults (21–35 years), resulting in 24 separate
models (2 genders × 4 regions × 3 age groups). Period (time) was modelled using natural
splines with four equally spaced inner knots (i.e. placed to ensure an equal number of new
smokers in each sub-period), since four knots provided the best fitting according to the Bayes-
ian Information Criterion (BIC) across most models. Age was included to adjust for potential
residual confounding within age groups.
We carried out sensitivity analyses (data not shown) where we (i) excluded the data from
RHINE in order to assess the impact of the different question used to define ever smoking, (ii)
excluded 14 samples with a response rate below 40%, and (iii) only considered smokers who
had reported >5 cigarettes/day (n = 46,382, 82.2% of all smokers) for the calculation of the
rates. This was done through right-censoring of subjects with a smaller (n = 6,123) or missing
(n = 3,897) number of cigarettes/day at all the available study waves, because for these subjects
we might have missed a period of greater smoking intensity between initiation and the time
when they answered the questionnaires. These subjects contributed to person-years up to the
age at censoring, but they did not contribute to the number of events.
APC modelling.
We estimated birth cohort effects using APC modelling, assuming that
cohort effects resulted from the interaction between age effects and period effects.[22] Under
this assumption, a cohort effect arises when a change in some determinants of the variable of
interest over time (period effect) affects age groups differently. For example, the enforcement
of laws restricting tobacco sales to minors may reduce smoking initiation in children but not
in adults. APC modelling was used to test whether differences in trends at different ages
(cohort-effects) were statistically significant with no a priori assumptions on what age groups
are relevant for comparison.
Due to an insufficient number of smokers for some age-period groups in some samples, we
did not use multi-level models but merged data from different samples and used single-level
regression analysis. APC modelling was carried out in two steps: (i) we first fitted negative
binomial regression models on age and period, using natural splines with four and five knots
respectively, and calculated model deviance residuals (multi-level models did not provide nor-
mally-distributed residuals); (ii) we then analysed the residuals using linear regression on birth
cohort (natural spline with three knots), with robust standard errors to account for deviations
from normality, and weights inversely proportional to the variance, since the precision of
residuals varied according to the number of subjects by age and period. The number of knots
for splines was selected based on the BIC as mentioned before.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
Ethical approval was not requested for this secondary analysis of pooled data from previous
studies. In each of the original studies, ethical approval was obtained for each centre from the

 appropriate ethics committee.[15–20] All procedures have conformed to the principles
embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from partic-
ipants in the clinical examinations (ECRHS clinical). In ECRHS Italy, RHINE, GA2LEN,
ISAYA and GEIRD, only data from postal questionnaires were used, which were voluntarily
sent back giving consent to use the anonymized data.
Results
The combined dataset included 55,490 males (780,068 person-years) and 63,614 females
(975,609 person-years). GA2LEN was the largest study, while ECRHS contributed with the
largest number of samples (Table 1). The median age of the participants ranged from 33 years
in ECRHS and ISAYA, to 52 years in RHINE. The prevalence of ever smoking ranged from
42.8% in GA2LEN to 61.3% in ECRHS (S2 Table).
Time trends in smoking initiation (age-stratified analysis)
The crude rates of smoking initiation by region, age and time period are shown in S3 Table
(males) and S4 Table (females). In all the regions combined, the rates of smoking initiation
before 1970 peaked at 18 years of age in males and 19 in females; in the 2000s, they peaked at
ages 16 and 15, respectively (Fig 1).
Fig 2 shows adjusted smoothed trends in smoking initiation in males (top panel) and
females (bottom panel) across age groups and by region. Overall, initiation rates were highest
during late adolescence (16–20 years, red lines). In this age group, in 1970, rates ranged from
90 (North Europe) to 140 (East Europe) per 1000/year in males, and from 70 (East and South
Europe) to 100 (West Europe) per 1000/year in females. In late adolescent males from North
Europe, rates decreased steadily throughout the study period. In the other groups, rates
decreased only after they had reached a peak during the 1970s. In South Europe the decline
levelled off after 1990 for both sexes. Around 2005, initiation rates during late adolescence
were the lowest in males and females from North Europe (20 per 1000/year) and the highest in
males from South Europe (80 per 1000/year).
Initiation rates in early adolescence (11–15 years, green lines) were lower than in late ado-
lescence, but they started to increase after 1990 in all regions, except for males in North Europe
who had stable rates. In the 2000s, initiation rates during early adolescence were above 20 per

 1000/year in males from South and West Europe, as well as in females from West Europe. In
the latter group, initiation rates reached 40 per 1000/year by 2005, similar to those of males of
the same age and older females (16–20 years).
In young adults (21–35 years, blue lines), initiation rates were generally low (below 20 per
1000/year) and they were either stable or declining over time.

 Europe (both sexes) and North Europe (females) were higher than expected under the hypoth-
esis of additivity of age and period effects, as indicated by positive model residuals. These
results are in agreement with the age-stratified analysis. For example, the excess of smoking
initiation (positive residuals) in the youngest birth cohorts of West European females (S3 Fig)
was mirrored by the different time trends between young adolescents (upward trend) and
older subjects (downward trend) in the age-stratified analysis (Fig 2).
Discussion
We investigated long-term trends in the uptake of regular smoking across Europe. We found
that smoking initiation rates were highest during late adolescence. In this age group, rates
decreased substantially between 1970 and 2009 across Europe, with the exception of South
Europe where this decline levelled off after 1990. The most crucial finding of our work was the
marked increase in smoking initiation during early adolescence observed after 1990, for both
sexes and in all regions, except for North European males. This finding was corroborated by
the APC analysis, which highlighted the presence of birth cohort effects in the youngest
cohorts. Our study also suggests that if youngsters reach age 20 as non-smokers, they are very
unlikely to start later in life.
Our findings of the highest initiation rates during late adolescence are in agreement with
Eurobarometer surveys showing that the majority of European smokers (53% according to the
2015 report) start between the ages of 15 and 18 years.[1] The European School Survey Project
on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) documented a global decrease in the prevalence of life-
time use of cigarettes among 15–16 year-olds between 1995 (67%) and 2015 (47%).[6] In line
with this trend, we found a marked reduction in smoking initiation since the 1970s. This
seems to suggest that the tobacco control policies implemented over time, together with the
dissemination of information on the harmful effects of smoking, have effectively addressed the
age group that is at the greatest risk of starting smoking. In North Europe, initiation rates dur-
ing late adolescence reached a minimum of 20 per 1000/year around 2005 in both sexes, while
in the rest of Europe they ranged from 40 (West European females) to 80 (South European
males) per 1000/year. Moreover, the declining trend levelled off in South Europe after 1990.
These findings suggest that, in East, South and West European countries, the strategies to pre-
vent adolescents from smoking are lagging behind North Europe. Scandinavia and the UK are
at the forefront of tobacco control policies and scientific research on tobacco control.[2,23,24]
Scandinavian countries were the first in Europe to adopt anti-tobacco initiatives in the 1970s.

We found a worrying increase in smoking initiation during early adolescence after 1990, in
spite of the reduction observed among older subjects. In line with our findings, the proportion
of European smokers who start before the age of 15 years has been reported to increase from
17% to 19% between 2012 and 2014.[1] Similar trends towards an anticipation in smoking ini-
tiation have also been reported in the US.[8] Tobacco use in young adolescents is strongly
influenced by siblings and friends.[26] Early smoking initiation is associated with early puberty
onset, possibly because of a gap between physical and social maturity,[27] and age at puberty
has been decreasing in both sexes in Europe and elsewhere.[28]
An increase in tobacco prices may be a successful strategy for young people, who are the
most price-sensitive sector of the population.[29–31] Current policies on prices focus on con-
ventional (boxed) cigarettes, and they seem to induce a shift to cheaper products, including
hand-rolled cigarettes.[30] Equalising taxation levels of all tobacco products, as advocated by
the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, may limit smoking initiation especially dur-
ing early adolescence.[2] Smoking in youth can be reduced by preventing tobacco sales to

 minors through law enforcement, which may include warnings and fines to non-compliant
retailers.[32,33] Since young adolescents generally obtain cigarettes from their peers, restrict-
ing sales to minors can break the chain of tobacco supply to them [12]. Reducing exposure to
cigarette advertising (including pack display at the point of sale), and implementing plain
packaging in combination with pictorial health warnings, makes youth less likely to try smok-
ing or to smoke again after experimentation.[34–36] It is still unclear whether smoking bans
can reduce the prevalence of smoking, but smoke-free places may produce an environment
that is less favourable to experimentation in young adolescents.[37]
Our findings in the context of current tobacco control policies
Since we were able to estimate trends only until 2005–2009, we looked at available data on
tobacco control policies in order to generalise our findings to present. We used the Tobacco
Control Scale (TCS), a quantitative scoring system based on expert opinions that evaluates pol-
icies on tobacco prices, smoke-free places, spending on information campaigns, bans on
advertising, health warning labels and treatment for smoking cessation.[23,38,39] According
to the TCS, no European region showed a clear progress in policy implementation between
2007 and 2013 (Fig 3). Even if North Europe had the best performance, there is large room for
improvement in all regions: on average, TCS scores for 2013 were between 40 and 60 in a scale
ranging up to 100. Therefore, we speculate that major reductions in the rates of initiation are
unlikely to have occurred in the same period.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of our study include the use of large samples of European populations, a consistent
assessment of age at initiation across all the studies, and a long time window of observation. A
limitation is that we used multiple random samples from studies with different designs and
age ranges in a number of countries, which may not be representative of the European

 population. Participation rates varied widely across studies and centres, which could have
introduced some bias. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding samples with participation
rates below 40% produced consistent results. Our data had not been collected to specifically
assess smoking trends. We applied an operational definition of smoking that focused on regu-
lar smoking but we were not able to investigate smoking experimentation. The questions avail-
able in RHINE did not address regular smoking but excluding this study, which contributed
with 18.0 and 8.6% of the subjects from North and East Europe respectively, did not make a
material difference in the results. The retrospective assessment of age at initiation may have
introduced recall bias, although we found that reporting was fairly consistent up to two
decades apart (S1 Appendix).
Since we could not assess trends in smoking intensity, it may be argued that the observed
trends were driven by trends in occasional smoking. However, our findings were confirmed in
a sensitivity analysis excluding subjects reporting to smoke 5 or less cigarettes/day. We had no
data to distinguish between boxed cigarettes, hand-rolled cigarettes, or e-cigarettes. However,
boxed cigarettes are still the most common tobacco product in Europe, and most of our data
come from a period preceding the widespread availability of e-cigarettes.[1] Finally, we were
not able to use multilevel models in the APC analyses due to data sparseness.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the rates of smoking initiation are still unacceptably high at ages 16–
20 years in most European regions, and they are increasing among those aged 15 years or
younger. In West Europe, females aged 11–15 years seem to deserve particular attention, since
their rates of initiation have reached the rates observed in females aged 16–20 years. Some chil-
dren experiment with smoking because they feel pressured by peers, and parental smoking
may give easy access to cigarettes. These social factors are difficult to address and require com-
plex community-level interventions.[13] However, there is a necessity for countries to inten-
sify implementation of evidence-based tobacco control measures reaching adolescents,
especially price increases, enforced legislation on sales to minors, plain packaging, and bans on
advertising. The use of internet and social media campaigns may also represent a valuable
strategy to target the youngsters.[40]
