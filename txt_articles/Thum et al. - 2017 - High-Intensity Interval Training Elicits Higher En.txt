Abstract
Exercise adherence is affected by factors including perceptions of enjoyment, time availabil-
ity, and intrinsic motivation. Approximately 50% of individuals withdraw from an exercise
program within the first 6 mo of initiation, citing lack of time as a main influence. Time effi-
cient exercise such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) may provide an alternative to
moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICT) to elicit substantial health benefits. This
study examined differences in enjoyment, affect, and perceived exertion between MICT and
HIIT. Twelve recreationally active men and women (age = 29.5 ± 10.7 yr, VO2max = 41.4 ±
4.1 mL/kg/min, BMI = 23.1 ± 2.1 kg/m2) initially performed a VO2max test on a cycle ergom-
eter to determine appropriate workloads for subsequent exercise bouts. Each subject
returned for two additional exercise trials, performing either HIIT (eight 1 min bouts of cycling
at 85% maximal workload (Wmax) with 1 min of active recovery between bouts) or MICT (20
min of cycling at 45% Wmax) in randomized order. During exercise, rating of perceived exer-
tion (RPE), affect, and blood lactate concentration (BLa) were measured. Additionally, the
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was completed after exercise. Results showed
higher enjoyment (p = 0.013) in response to HIIT (103.8 ± 9.4) versus MICT (84.2 ± 19.1).
Eleven of 12 participants (92%) preferred HIIT to MICT. However, affect was lower (p<0.05)
and HR, RPE, and BLa were higher (p<0.05) in HIIT versus MICT. Although HIIT is more
physically demanding than MICT, individuals report greater enjoyment due to its time effi-
ciency and constantly changing stimulus.

Introduction
In adults, the recommended amount of physical activity to modify health risks is equivalent
to 150 min/wk of moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICT) or 75 min/wk of vigorous
exercise [1]. However, in the United States, only approximately 20% of adults meet this recom-
mendation [2]. The greatest barrier to regular physical activity is lack of time ([3–4], which
questions the practicality of MICT in the overall adult population considering its relatively

 large time commitment. High intensity-interval training (HIIT) consisting of repeated, intense
exercise bouts separated by passive or active recovery has been widely studied in the last
decade ([5]. Data show that compared to MICT, 6 wk of HIIT in the form of repeated Wingate
tests elicits similar improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and mitochondrial
function [6]. In addition, some studies show significantly greater improvements in VO2max in
response to HIIT compared to MICT [7].
While HIIT may require less time compared to MICT, the shortness of breath, leg pain, and
dramatic fatigue usually experienced during HIIT may make this modality less tolerable in cer-
tain populations. The Dual-Mode theory [8] demonstrates that at intensities below the ventila-
tory threshold (VT), affect as measured with the Feeling Scale [9] is positive, suggesting that
exercise at this intensity is pleasurable and long-term may promote exercise adherence [10].
However, at supra-VT work rates which are characteristic of HIIT, affect becomes less positive
due to onset of interoceptive cues and greater contribution of anaerobic metabolism to ATP
supply [8]. This may ultimately reduce exercisers’ willingness to partake in more intense exer-
cise, which is important for designing proper exercise prescription especially when more
intense exercise may elicit superior improvements in VO2max [11].
A few studies have compared perceptions of affect and/or enjoyment in response to acute
bouts of HIIT versus MICT. Bartlett et al. [12] reported that running-based HIIT led to
greater perceived enjoyment compared to MICT in active men. When average intensity was
matched between HIIT and MICT (intensity equal to 85% respiratory compensation point),
young healthy men reported higher RPE and fatigue, lower affect, but similar enjoyment in
response to HIIT versus MICT [13]. In untrained adults, HIIT was reported to be less plea-
surable than MICT [14], but more than 50% of participants reported that they preferred it.
In addition, HIIT was viewed as more enjoyable than vigorous exercise yet no differences in
enjoyment were seen compared to MICT. In obese young women, Kong et al. [15] reported
that enjoyment was significantly higher during each week of a 5 wk HIIT regimen (repeated
8 s “all-out” sprints separated by 12 s passive recovery) compared to MICT (40 min at 60–
80%VO2max).
Despite empirical evidence showing significant adaptations and potentially higher enjoy-
ment in response to HIIT compared to MICT, acceptance of high intensity interval training
is not universal. Recently, Hardcastle et al. [16] criticized the practicality of one paradigm of
HIIT, sprint interval training (SIT) characterized by repeated Wingate tests, which has been
used to improve VO2max and other health outcomes [6,17]. Hardcastle et al. [16] assert that
SIT is too physically demanding for a largely sedentary population, and that low levels of
enjoyment and affect elicited by the intense nature of SIT may discourage exercise adher-
ence and motivation. However, the current study and related investigations ([12–14] in-
corporated HIIT which has a lower metabolic perturbation than SIT. Despite significant
physiological differences between these modes of interval training, findings from recent
studies showed similar enjoyment between two regimes of HIIT [18] and similar affect
between HIIT and SIT [19].
Due to these equivocal results, it remains to be determined whether HIIT is a more enjoy-
able and preferable modality of exercise compared to MICT. This line of inquiry is necessary
to identify effective, time-efficient, and enjoyable modes of exercise to impact fitness and over-
all health status in various populations.
The aim of this study was to examine differences in enjoyment, perceived exertion, and
affect between MICT and HIT in recreationally active individuals. It was hypothesized that
HIIT will be perceived as more enjoyable compared to MICT, although lower affect and higher
RPE were anticipated in response to HIIT.

 Methods
Ethics Statement
Prior to providing written informed consent, all participants filled out a health-history ques-
tionnaire to ensure that they met all inclusion criteria, and all procedures were approved by
the CSU—San Marcos Institutional Review Board (S1 protocol).
Design
This repeated measures, within-subjects study required all participants to complete three ses-
sions of exercise in a climate-controlled laboratory (temperature and relative humidity equal
to 19–22˚C and 40–60%, respectively). Initially, VO2max was assessed on a cycle ergometer
during progressive exercise to exhaustion. Between 48–96 h later at the same time of day, par-
ticipants initiated one of two bouts of either HIIT or MICT during which perceptual responses
and blood lactate concentration were obtained. Participants refrained from intense exercise
for 48 h before each session, and they completed a dietary log so food intake was standardized
24 h before each session. In addition, all subjects fasted for 3 h prior to each session. The
STROBE checklist is available to the reader as S1 checklist.
Participants
Healthy, non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2), recreationally active men (n = 8) and women (n = 4)
were recruited via word-of-mouth from the university population from September to Decem-
ber 2015. Their characteristics are listed in Table 1. Participants performed a minimum of
3 h/wk of physical activity including aerobic exercise, resistance training, surfing, group exer-
cise, hiking, and/or non-competitive sport and had done so for at least 1 yr. None reported
any fitness-related goals such as training for a particular event. Only one participant regularly
performed cycling-based HIIT similar to that performed in the current study. Additional
inclusion criteria were non-smokers between the ages of 18–49 yr who lacked knee ailments
or any other pre-existing health conditions. A recruitment flowchart for the study is shown in
Fig 1.
Baseline Assessment
On the first visit, participants underwent anthropometric measurements including height,
weight, and body composition. Skinfold (Lange, Santa Cruz, CA) measurements were per-
formed twice in rotational order at each of three sites (chest, abdomen, and thigh for men; tri-
ceps, suprailiac, and thigh for women), and the mean value was used to estimate percent body

 fat using the appropriate equation [20–21]. Next, the participant initiated incremental exercise
on an electrically-braked cycle ergometer (Velotron DynaFit Pro, RacerMate, Seattle, WA) to
determine VO2max using a ramp protocol. Work rate began at 50–70 W for 2 min followed by
25–35 W/min increases in work rate until volitional fatigue. During exercise, heart rate (HR)
was assessed via telemetry (Polar, Woodbury, NY) and gas exchange data were obtained every
15 s using a metabolic cart (ParvoMedics True One, Sandy, Utah) which was calibrated pre-
exercise according to manufacturer guidelines. Maximal workload (in Watts) from this bout
was used to determine the exercise intensities of subsequent trials. VO2max incidence was con-
firmed using established criteria [22] including respiratory exchange ratio > 1.15, leveling off
in VO2 at exercise termination, and HR within 10 b/min of the age-predicted value (220 –age).
Completion of HIIT and MICT
At the same time of day as the VO2max trial within subjects, participants performed either
HIIT or MICT, whose order was randomized using a Latin Squares design [23]. Trials were
separated by a minimum of 2 d to maximum of 7 d. Exercise began with a 5 min warmup at
25%Wmax. High intensity interval training consisted of eight 60 s bouts of cycling at 85%
Wmax separated by 60 s of recovery at 25%Wmax. During MICT, participants pedaled at 45%
Wmax for 20 min. Across regimens, exercise duration was slightly different (16 vs. 20 min).
Assessment of Perceptual Responses
Rating of perceived exertion (RPE, Category Ratio-10, 11-point scale))[24], and affect
(11-point scale, rating from +5 very good to -5 very bad) [9] were recorded pre-exercise while

 participants were seated on the ergometer and at 25, 50, 75, and 100% of session completion.
During HIIT, these were measured at cessation of each 60 s interval in the order of RPE fol-
lowed by affect. Before each trial, participants were read specific instructions according to
what each measure encompassed. The meaning of the CR-10 scale was communicated by
instructing participants to report perceptions of their exertion in terms of their breathing,
heart rate, and level of fatigue. For affect, they were read the following text: While participating
in exercise, it is common to experience changes in mood. Some individuals find exercise pleasur-
able, whereas others find it to be unpleasant. Additionally, feeling may fluctuate across time. That
is, one might feel good and bad a number of times during exercise. They were asked to respond
to each scale in terms of how they felt at that moment.
After a 5 min cool-down, subjects were seated for 5 min and subsequently completed the
Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) [25]. The 10 min period between the cessation of
exercise and completion of PACES was necessary to ensure focus by mitigating effects of resid-
ual fatigue on participants’ score. This scale was used to assess level of enjoyment of HIIT and
MICT using participant responses to 18 questions scored on a 1–7 Likert scale. After comple-
tion of both trials, participants were asked which modality of exercise they ultimately preferred
(HIIT or MICT).
Assessment of Blood Lactate Concentration and Heart Rate
Blood lactate concentration (BLa) was recorded during MICT and HIIT at the following inter-
vals: before the warm-up, at 25% and 75% of exercise completion, and 3 min post-exercise.
During HIIT, blood was sampled immediately after the completion of training bouts 2 and 6.
Blood samples were acquired with a portable analyzer (Lactate Plus, Nova Biomedical, Wal-
tham, Massachusetts) and fingerstick lancets (Unistix 3 Comfort, Owen Mumford, Marietta,
GA). Heart rate was measured continuously during exercise using telemetry.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using SPSS version
20.0 (Chicago, Illinois). A two-way (time and exercise regime) analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measures was used to compare differences in outcome measures between MICT
and HIT. If a significant F ratio was obtained, Tukey’s post hoc test was used to identify signifi-
cant differences between means. A paired t-test was used to determine significant differences
in enjoyment between exercise modalities. At a power equal to 0.80 (two-tailed α = 0.05) and
effect size for enjoyment equal to 1.0, a minimum sample size of eight individuals was deter-
mined [26] which is similar to a previous study [12]. Effect size was reported as Cohen’s d. Sig-
nificance was set at p<0.05.
Results
All participants completed all bouts without incident. To confirm the higher absolute inten-
sity of HIIT versus MICT, Fig 2A and 2B reveal change in HR and BLa during exercise. For
HR, there was a regimeXtime interaction (F4,40 = 10.0, p<0.001, d = 4.08). Post hoc analyses
showed significantly higher HR at all time points in HIIT versus MICT. Peak intensity of
MICT (77%HRmax) was lower than that of HIIT (89%HRmax). Similar findings were
shown for BLa, indicating a significant regimeXtime interaction (F3,30 = 14.6, p<0.001,
d = 1.0). Post hoc analyses showed that all exercise values of BLa were higher during HIIT
versus MICT.

 Differences in Physical Activity Enjoyment in Response to HIIT versus
MICT
PACES scores indicated a significant difference in enjoyment (p = 0.013, d = 1.54) between
MICT (84.2 ± 19.1) and HIIT (103.8 ± 9.4). Ninety two percent of participants demonstrated
higher enjoyment and preference for HIIT compared to MICT.
Differences in RPE and Affect in Response to HIIT versus MICT
A significant regimeXtime interaction (F4,40 = 9.6, p = 0.003, d = 0.74) was demonstrated for
RPE. Post hoc results showed that all exercise RPE values were higher by 1.5–2.7 units in HIIT
compared to MICT (Fig 2C). Affect declined during exercise (F4,40 = 19.6, p<0.001) to values
at exercise cessation equal to 1.5 ± 1.9 and 0.0 ± 3.2 in MICT and HIIT, respectively. Data
showed a significant regimeXtime interaction (F4,40 = 7.1, p = 0.004, d = 0.78). Post hoc

 analyses showed that all exercise affect values were less positive in response to HIIT versus
MICT (Fig 2D).
Discussion
Given the rising epidemic of sedentarism in American society [27], it is increasingly important
for exercise professionals to identify various modalities of exercise that are enjoyable, time effi-
cient, and produce significant health benefits. According to Burgomaster et al. [6], interval
training has been shown to elicit comparable physiological adaptations to endurance training,
despite a much lower training volume and time commitment. Although a lower time commit-
ment of exercise may have the potential to increase exercise adherence, the extent to which
individuals enjoy HIIT remains unclear. This study examined differences in enjoyment in
response to cycling-based HIIT compared to MICT. Our data showed greater enjoyment of
HIIT compared to MICT despite higher metabolic stress in the form of significantly higher
RPE, HR, and BLa.
Unlike previous studies in this area [13–14,28], we examined differences in BLa between
MICT and HIIT. Our data show significant increases in BLa for both exercise regimes, al-
though values were significantly higher in HIIT compared to MICT (Fig 1B). This partially
supports the less positive affect exhibited throughout and at cessation of HIIT versus MICT,
which is explained by the Dual-Mode Theory [8]. It is apparent [8] that affect begins to decline
with increasing reliance on anaerobic metabolism which would be more substantial at intensi-
ties equal to 85%Wmax versus 45%Wmax as performed in MICT.
Yet despite this more aversive response consequent with HIIT, enjoyment as measured
with the PACES scale was significantly higher compared to higher-volume MICT. Three
potential factors explain this response. First, the intermittent nature of HIIT provides partici-
pants with multiple recovery intervals which may provide a “break” from less positive affective
responses [14] which are seen with continuous exercise at supra-VT intensities. Second, many
participants viewed MICT as quite monotonous and did not enjoy maintaining a moderate
effort for 20 min. In contrast, HIIT provides an ever changing stimulus that breaks the entire
session up into small increments of work interspersed with recovery. Third, there is a certain
level of accomplishment that is experienced during HIIT which is not apparent in MICT [14].
Overall, this may give the exerciser a greater amount of self-confidence and may explain why
92% of participants preferred HIIT to MICT.
Various methodological differences inherent in previous studies need to be considered
when trying to compare findings across studies. In the Bartlett et al. study [12], participants
were highly-fit men with a VO2max equal to 57 mL/kg/min who completed a 50 min session
of MICT at 70%VO2max or HIIT consisting of six 3 min intervals at 90%VO2max. Work and
average intensity were matched across bouts. Enjoyment as measured with PACES was higher
by approximately 25 units in response to HIIT compared to MICT. However, these findings
are not unexpected considering that this sample of participants likely has a history of positive
responses to intense exercise participation. In a subsequent study in 15 young men (VO2max =
47.9 mL/kg/min) [13], repeated 2 min intervals at 100%VO2max led to less positive affect and
greater fatigue versus MICT consisting of 24 min of cycling at 72%VO2max, although enjoy-
ment was similar. In the Jung et al. study [14], 44 inactive men and women (VO2max = 36 mL/
kg/min) performed in randomized order HIIT consisting of 1 min bouts at 100%Wpeak, and
moderate (40 min at 40%Wpeak) and vigorous MICT (20 min at 80%Wpeak). Despite a less
positive affect reported in HIIT versus moderate MICT, participants exhibited similar task self-
efficacy and greater enjoyment versus vigorous exercise (p = 0.01) and MICT (p = 0.08). An
examination of these data and ours (Fig 1D) suggests some interesting trends. Lower intensity

 HIIT (~78%Wpeak) as performed in a previous study [28] elicits more positive affect values
during exercise equal to 2.0 (between fairly good and good) compared to HIIT used in the pres-
ent study (85%Wpeak) and that of Jung et al. (100%Wpeak) [14], in which affect reached a
nadir to values near 0 (neutral). When HIIT bouts are sustained for up to 2 min at 100%
VO2max [13], affect declined to values of approximately -2.5 (bad). Although speculative, this
suggests an inverse association between the specific work rate employed in HIIT and the affec-
tual response to exercise.
A recent study [19] showed similar affect in response to a single bout of sprint interval
training (SIT) with a 1:3 ratio of work to recovery compared to HIIT with a 1:1 ratio, although
BLa and RPE were higher in response to SIT. Nevertheless, enjoyment was not assessed in this
study. Similarly, there was no difference in enjoyment between dissimilar HIIT regimes (16 X
1 min at 90–95%HRpeak versus 4 X 4 min at 90–95%HRpeak) in young men [18]. As intensi-
ties of HIIT can widely vary from as low as 60%Wmax [29] to 300%Wmax [6], there is a poten-
tial for differences in physiological and perceptual responses across this continuum. Future
studies should explore the optimum intensity and/or work:recovery interval enhancing levels
of enjoyment and affect in HIIT compared to MICT, considering that in-task affect is related
to intentions to exercise [30]. In addition, a few studies have examined changes in enjoyment
during chronic administration of HIIT. In young, healthy obese men and women [31], enjoy-
ment significantly increased during training, and in another study [15], enjoyment was consis-
tently higher throughout 5 wk of HIIT versus MICT despite it being at a higher intensity (80%
VO2peak vs. 71%VO2peak). These findings, albeit preliminary, show that chronic HIIT is
viewed as more enjoyable than MICT and emphasize the potential of this exercise paradigm in
young, overweight-to-obese individuals.
The structure of HIIT in the present study followed a 1:1 ratio of work to recovery. This
ratio was also used in sedentary adults [14,29] and in overweight to obese inactive adults [28].
In contrast, a 2:1 ratio was used in the study by Oliveira et al. [13] in which many participants
could not complete the interval protocol, which may have led to greater fatigue compared to
MICT. Martinez et al. [28] revealed that interval exercise can be pleasurable even in sedentary
individuals. In this study, 20 insufficiently active (BMI = 25–35 kg/m2) individuals completed
a trial of heavy continuous exercise (20 min at 50%Wmax) and three bouts of HIIT: 30s work/
30s rest, 60s work/60s rest, and 120s work/120s rest. Interval sessions were 24 min in duration
and were completed at an intensity equal to 60% of the difference between anaerobic threshold
and VO2max, which was equivalent to 78%Wmax. Affect and enjoyment were assessed during
and after exercise. Greater enjoyment and affect (p<0.05) were reported for 30 and 60 s HIIT
bouts compared to the 120 s duration and continuous exercise, which were seen as signifi-
cantly more aversive. These findings suggest that interval duration � 60 s and having a 1:1
ratio of work:recovery may be optimal for increasing perceptual responses to exercise and
potentially long-term adherence to this modality of training.
Limitations of the current study included a relatively small sample consisting of habitually
active men and women varying in age and gender. Despite this small and heterogeneous sam-
ple, differences in outcome measures were highly significant between regimes. In addition, the
inclusion of both genders, which was not done in previous studies [12–13], broadens our find-
ings to a more diverse population. Similar to our results, Jung et al. [14] and Martinez et al.
[28] also showed significantly higher enjoyment in response to HIIT compared to MICT in a
large sample of men and women, which would suggest that men and women consistently
report higher enjoyment of HIIT. However, their participants were inactive and those in the
current study were habitual exercisers, which suggests that fitness level may not significantly
alter enjoyment responses to low-volume HIIT. Nevertheless, individual differences in affec-
tive responses exist [14], so further study is merited to examine if differences in gender and

 fitness level mediate the enjoyment response to various intensities of exercise including HIIT.
It remains to be determined to what extent perceptual responses such as higher enjoyment and
lower affect in HIIT are influenced by the timing of inquiry. It is possible that a greater sense
of accomplishment is realized after rather than during HIIT, altering perceptions of enjoyment
and mood. The entire HIIT session performed in the present study was 4 min shorter in dura-
tion than MICT, making it more time efficient. In addition, the unequal disparity of male and
female participants does not allow us to consider a potential role of gender on these responses,
as done in a previous study [32]. Although enjoyment responses to a single bout of HIIT may
be predictive of attitudes towards chronic exercise participation in this modality, little research
[15, 31] exists examining if enjoyment is modified long-term. Lastly, sprint interval training
[33–34] is a widely used and more intense approach to HIIT whose completion improves vari-
ous health outcomes; however, it was not completed in the present study. Consequently, addi-
tional research is merited to examine if this modality elicits different perceptions of enjoyment
compared to MICT or HIIT.
Conclusion
Data reveal that HIIT requiring a shorter time commitment than MICT led to greater enjoy-
ment in a small sample of active men and women. Despite greater metabolic stress, over 90%
of participants preferred HIIT versus MICT. These findings may support increasing integra-
tion of HIIT into the regular exercise routine of healthy, active individuals. Further study in
larger heterogeneous populations should attempt to substantiate our findings and investigate
if the greater enjoyment in response to low-volume HIIT compared to MICT is also revealed
at all intensities above VT as well as when work:recovery interval is manipulated.
