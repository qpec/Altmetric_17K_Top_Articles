World Hepatitis Day — 
July 28, 2016
World Hepatitis Day, recognized on July 28, was established 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise awareness 
and promote understanding of viral hepatitis, the seventh 
leading cause of death worldwide (1). Together, hepatitis B 
and hepatitis C are responsible for most of the 1.4 million 
annual deaths attributed to viral hepatitis (1). In April 2016, 
the 69th World Health Assembly adopted a Global Viral 
Hepatitis Strategy that aims to eliminate hepatitis B and 
hepatitis C as public health threats by 2030 (1). The strategy 
includes prevention and treatment targets that, when met, 
will save millions of lives.
This issue of MMWR features a report revealing the 
growing risk for perinatal transmission of hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) in the United States, a risk most pronounced in areas 
where HCV incidence is increasing among young adults and 
women of childbearing age. Vaccination-based strategies 
are highly effective in preventing perinatal hepatitis B virus 
transmission (2). The report highlights that, in the absence 
of a vaccine for HCV, there is an immediate need to improve 
risk screening, scale up HCV testing among persons at 
risk, including children born to HCV-infected mothers, as 
recommended by CDC and the United States Preventive 
Services Task Force, and improve case reporting, particularly 
among women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver-
related morbidity and mortality (1). Transmission of HCV 
is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be 
transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmis-
sion occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%–7.8%) 
of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV 
and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are 
also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or 
who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no rec-
ommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection 
from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV 
infection among persons aged ≤30 years (5,6) with similar

increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises 
concern about increases in the number of pregnant women 
with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could 
be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial 
laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate 
trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* 
HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years, and the propor-
tions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and 
in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV 
infection during 2011–2014 (6). During 2011–2014, com-
mercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV 
detection (antibody or RNA positivity†) among women of 
childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody 
or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years increased 14%; birth 
certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to 
HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%. 
During the same time in Kentucky, the HCV detection rate 
among women of childbearing age increased >200%, HCV 
testing among children aged ≤2 years increased 151%, and the 
proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women increased 
124%, from 0.71% to 1.59%. Increases in the rate of HCV 
detection among women of childbearing age suggest a potential 
risk for vertical transmission of HCV. These findings highlight 
the importance of following current CDC recommendations 
to identify, counsel, and test persons at risk for HCV infection 
(1,7), including pregnant women, as well as consider develop-
ing public health policies for routine HCV testing of pregnant 
women, and expanding current policies for testing and moni-
toring children born to HCV-infected women. Expansion of 
HCV reporting and surveillance requirements will enhance 
case identification and prevention strategies.
In the United States, incidence of HCV infection has been 
increasing in young persons, including women of childbear-
ing age, particularly in rural areas such as Appalachia (5,6). 
Although acute HCV infection, as defined by the Council of 
State and Territorial Epidemiologists,§ is a notifiable condition 
and reportable to the health department in almost all states,¶ 
persons with acute HCV infection account for a small fraction 
of persons with newly diagnosed HCV infection; most new 
diagnoses are among persons with HCV infection of unknown 
duration. Because reporting of all cases of HCV infection is 
not mandated in many states, a substantial proportion of 
HCV-infected women of childbearing age, including pregnant 
women, are likely not reported in routine state-based surveil-
lance systems. Commercial laboratory data and birth certificate 
data provide additional sources of information to supplement 
HCV surveillance data.
* Childbearing age among women is defined as 15–44 years.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
To evaluate HCV infection among women of childbearing 
age and the potential for mother-to-child transmission of 
HCV, trends in HCV detection (defined as HCV antibody 
or RNA positivity) in women of childbearing age and HCV 
testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years from 
2011–2014 were assessed nationally and for Kentucky using 
commercial laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics (Quest). 
Detection of HCV infection among infants was not evaluated 
because 1) the exact infant dates of birth to allow discrimina-
tion between maternal and infant HCV antibody were not 
available, and 2) very few infants had RNA testing to detect 
current HCV infection. Trends in proportions of infants born 
to HCV-infected women were assessed using birth certificate 
data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Maternal 
HCV infection status on birth certificates is obtained from the 
prenatal record, labor and delivery admission form, admission 
history and physical examination, or delivery record; maternal 
HCV diagnosis is recorded on the birth certificate if HCV 
infection is present at pregnancy diagnosis or if HCV infection 
is confirmed during pregnancy with a positive test for HCV 
(8). Demographic characteristics of HCV antibody-positive 
pregnant women reported to the Kentucky Department for 
Public Health (KDPH) during 2011–2014 were also exam-
ined. These data were collected as part of routine acute HCV 
surveillance, and during December 2013–December 2014, 
were enhanced by a KDPH request for voluntary reporting of 
all cases of HCV infection identified among pregnant women 
and infants.
The annual HCV detection rate among women of child-
bearing age tested by Quest was calculated as cases of HCV 
detection per 100,000 women of childbearing age served by 
the laboratory (i.e., women of childbearing age who received 
a laboratory test for any reason). Quest data were also used to 
calculate the annual HCV testing rate per 100,000 children 
aged ≤2 years served by Quest. The proportion of infants 
born to HCV-infected mothers was calculated using birth 
certificate data.
During 2011–2014, the national rate of HCV detection 
among women of childbearing age served by Quest increased 
22%, from 139 to 169 per 100,000, and the rate of HCV test-
ing among children aged ≤2 years served by Quest increased 
14%, from 310 to 353 per 100,000 (Figure 1). During this 
time, the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women 
nationally increased 68%, from one in 536 (0.19%) to one

in 308 (0.32%) (Figure 2). During the same time, the rate 
of HCV detection among women of childbearing age in 
Kentucky increased 213%, from 275 to 862 per 100,000, 
and the rate of HCV testing among children aged ≤2 years 
increased 151%, from 403 to 1,011 per 100,000 (Figure 1). 
In addition, the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected 
women increased 124%, from one in 142 (0.71%) to one in 63 
(1.59%) (Figure 2). During 2011–2014, HCV case reporting 
to KDPH identified 777 pregnant women with HCV antibody 
positivity; 527 (68%) were aged 20–29 years, 218 (28%) were 
aged 30–39 years, 653 (84%) were non-Hispanic white, and 
293 (38%) reported past or current injection drug use.
Discussion
The national increases in HCV detection among women of 
childbearing age, HCV testing among infants, and the propor-
tion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers suggest increased 
risk for mother-to-child transmission of HCV. This risk might 
be higher in certain areas of the United States, as illustrated 
by the findings in this report for Kentucky, which might be 
related to increasing illicit injection drug use (5). KDPH 
surveillance data for pregnant women are also consistent with 
demographic patterns of HCV incidence overall in Kentucky 
and nationally (6).
Many opportunities to improve identification and monitor-
ing of HCV infection among women of childbearing age and 
infants exist. CDC recommends HCV testing for persons with 
a history of injection drug use and others at risk, including 
persons infected with HIV and persons with recognized expo-
sures (e.g., health care workers after needle sticks or mucosal 
exposure to HCV-positive blood) (1,7). It is important that 
providers assess women of childbearing age, particularly preg-
nant women, for HCV risk and test accordingly. CDC also 
recommends HCV testing of children born to HCV-infected 
women (1,7). Several organizations have published guidelines 
on HCV testing of children,** but harmonization is needed to 
ensure that all women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy

and all infants born to HCV-infected women are appropriately 
tested and linked to care if they are infected.
The potential for mother-to-child transmission of HCV 
has prompted some jurisdictions to consider changes in 
HCV case identification strategies and reporting policies. 
For example, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health 
recently demonstrated improved identification of infants 
born to HCV-infected mothers by cross-matching maternal 
information (including mother’s name and date of birth) on 
birth certificates to women in HCV surveillance registries (9). 
In 2015, Kentucky mandated reporting of all HCV-infected 
pregnant women and children through age 60 months, as well 
as all infants born to all HCV-infected women.†† Development 
of national reporting criteria to include a case definition for 
perinatal HCV infection could standardize reporting across 
states. Reporting pregnancy status as part of HCV laboratory-
based surveillance would also facilitate case identification. 
Improved surveillance can inform HCV screening and testing 
recommendations for pregnant women. Furthermore, there is 
an opportunity to detect HCV infection through routine HCV 
testing of infants identified as having perinatal exposure to 
illicit drugs, or neonatal abstinence syndrome, and their moth-
ers; this could enhance HCV case identification as suggested 
by the large proportion of HCV antibody-positive pregnant 
women in Kentucky who report injecting illicit drugs.
 
†† Kentucky Reportable Disease Regulations: 902 Ky. Admin. Regs. 2:020.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, incomplete information on pregnancy status on 
case report forms used for surveillance in Kentucky and 
maternal HCV infection status on birth certificates might 
underestimate rates of infants born to HCV-infected mothers. 
Second, identifying cases of HCV-infected persons, including 
pregnant women, relies on completeness of reporting; there-
fore, the data from KDPH are likely underestimates. Third, 
laboratory data were limited to a single commercial laboratory 
and thus might not represent the United States and Kentucky 
populations. Finally, HCV-infected mothers cannot be linked 
to their children using laboratory data, and information on 
children’s age in the laboratory data are limited, making it dif-
ficult to determine whether children are appropriately tested 
and have current infection; thus, HCV detection rates among 
children aged ≤2 years were not included in this report.
These findings underscore the importance of providing pri-
mary prevention services (7) and following current recommen-
dations to identify persons at risk for HCV infection and test 
accordingly; doing so among pregnant women would improve 
early identification of HCV-infected infants and linkage of 
the mother and infant to care and treatment. Furthermore, 
identifying HCV-infected women of childbearing age before 
pregnancy, with linkage to care, treatment, and cure, would 
avoid HCV infection during pregnancy and prevent mother-
to-child transmission. Expanding current and developing 
new public health policies to increase HCV detection among 
women of childbearing age (especially pregnant women) and 
infants should be considered; however, additional data are 
needed to better assess HCV prevalence among pregnant 
women and their infants and investigate options for perinatal 
prevention, care, and treatment.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Illicit injection drug use is a risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection; recent increases in injection drug use and increases in 
incidence of HCV infection among young persons have been 
observed in the United States.
What is added by this report?
During 2011–2014, increased rates of HCV detection (antibody 
or RNA positivity) among women of childbearing age and HCV 
testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged ≤2 years were 
observed both nationally and for Kentucky (22% and 14%, 
nationally; >200% and 151%, Kentucky). During the same 
period, birth certificate data showed the proportion of infants 
born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68% nationally and 
124% in Kentucky.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increased HCV testing of pregnant women, harmonized testing 
guidelines for children born to HCV-infected women, and 
adoption of a standardized perinatal HCV case definition might 
improve early identification of infants born to HCV-infected 
women and subsequent linkage of the mother and infant to 
care and treatment to prevent HCV-related sequelae.
