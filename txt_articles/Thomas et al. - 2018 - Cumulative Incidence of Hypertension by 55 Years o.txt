Background-—Blacks have higher blood pressure levels compared with whites beginning in childhood. Few data are available on
racial differences in the incidence of hypertension from young adulthood through middle age.
Methods and Results-—We calculated the cumulative incidence of hypertension from age 18 to 55 years among participants in the
CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study. Incident hypertension was defined by the first visit with mean
systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive
medication. Among 3890 participants without hypertension at baseline (aged 18–30 years), cumulative incidence of hypertension
by age 55 years was 75.5%, 75.7%, 54.5%, and 40.0% in black men, black women, white men, and white women, respectively.
Among participants with systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure <110 and 70, 110 to 119/70 to 74, and 120 to 129/75
to 79 mm Hg at baseline, blacks were more likely than whites to develop hypertension: multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios 1.97
(95% confidence interval, 1.65, 2.35), 1.80 (95% confidence interval, 1.52, 2.14), and 1.59 (95% confidence interval, 1.31, 1.93),
respectively. Parental history of hypertension and higher body mass index, serum uric acid, and systolic blood pressure/diastolic
blood pressure categories were associated with a higher risk for hypertension among blacks and whites. A higher Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet adherence score was associated with a lower risk for hypertension in blacks and whites.
Conclusions-—Regardless of blood pressure level in young adulthood, blacks have a substantially higher risk for hypertension
compared with whites through 55 years of age. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e007988. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.007988.)

T
here is evidence that blacks have higher blood pressure
(BP) levels and increased risk for hypertension compared
with whites beginning in childhood.1–3 Cross-sectional studies
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) have consistently reported a higher preva-
lence of hypertension in blacks compared with whites
beginning at a young age.4–8 However, few studies have used
longitudinal data to quantify the cumulative incidence of
hypertension from young adulthood through middle age among
blacks and whites. Also, there are few data on racial
differences in hypertension according to the definition in the
2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart
Association (AHA) BP guideline.9 Determining the magnitude of
racial differences in the cumulative incidence of hypertension
in young adulthood through middle age may help determine
the need for primordial prevention and interventions aimed at
maintaining optimal BP levels across the life span, particularly
among blacks. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to
determine the cumulative incidence of hypertension in black
and white adults aged 18 to 30 years who have been followed
until age 55 years. Because there are limited data on the
percentage of young adults with normal BP (systolic BP [SBP]
<120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] <80 mm Hg) and
elevated BP who develop hypertension, cumulative incidence
of hypertension was calculated by baseline levels of SBP and
DBP. An additional goal was to identify risk factors associated

for primordial prevention.
Methods
Data used in this analysis are available to the scientific
community through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute’s Biological Specimen and Data Repository Informa-
tion Coordinating Center (BioLINCC), and the analytical
methods are described below.
Study Population
Detailed methods for the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults) study have been published
previously.10 Briefly, in 1985–1986, 5115 black and white
men and women aged 18 to 30 years were enrolled in the
CARDIA study from 4 field centers in the United States
(Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland,
CA). Enrollment was performed to provide approximately
equal numbers of participants by sex, self-reported race
(black or white), age (18–24 or 25–30 years), and education
(less than or equal to high school or greater than high
school) at each site. The baseline clinic visit was completed
in 1985–1986 (Exam Year 0). The current analyses included
data from clinic visits that were completed at baseline and
during 8 follow-up visits that occurred 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20,
25,
and
30 years
following
the
baseline
examination.
Participation rates at follow-up visits ranged from 90% (Year
2 follow-up) to 71% (Year 30 follow-up) of the surviving
cohort. Institutional review boards at the participating sites
approved the human subjects protocol at each examination.
All participants provided written informed consent at each
study visit.
We restricted the analytical sample to participants with
valid clinic BP measurements at the baseline examination and
during at least 1 follow-up examination (n=4961). Participants
with SBP ≥130 mm Hg, DBP ≥80 mm Hg, self-reported use
of antihypertensive medications, or a self-reported previous
diagnosis of hypertension (n=911) at baseline were excluded.
Participants who were missing baseline covariate data
relevant to the analyses (n=159; described below) were also
excluded. One additional participant withdrew their consent
and was not included. After these exclusions, 3890 partici-
pants (795 black males, 1124 black females, 854 white
males, and 1117 white females) were included in the current
analyses.
Covariates
Age, sex, self-reported race, highest level of education
achieved, alcohol use, cigarette smoking (current, former, or
never), and parental history of hypertension were collected
using an interviewer-administered questionnaire during the
baseline examination. All covariates were measured at the
baseline study visit (Exam Year 0), except for highest level of
education, which was defined as the highest number of years
of education reported at any study visit. Alcohol use was
categorized as nondrinker, moderate (men/women: >0–14/
>0–7 drinks
per
week),
or
heavy
(men/women:
>14/
>7 drinks per week). A graded, symptom-limited maximal
exercise treadmill test that involved a multistaged protocol
with progressive difficulty of walking and running was
performed at baseline.11 Duration, in minutes, of the treadmill
tests was used to assess physical fitness, with longer
durations indicative of better physical fitness. Height and
weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet was calculated using the methods
described by Chang et al.12 Eight dietary components com-
prise the DASH adherence score. In brief, each dietary
component was assigned a score between 0 (poor adherence)
and 3 (high adherence). Dietary component scores were
summed to create an overall DASH diet adherence score
ranging from 0 (poor adherence) to 24 (high adherence).
Serum uric acid was measured using the uricase method from
an overnight fasting blood sample collected between 7 and
10 AM.3
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association blood pressure guideline definition,
cumulative incidence of hypertension by age 55 years was
75.5%, 75.7%, 54.5%, and 40.0% in black men, black women,
white men, and white women, respectively.
• Blacks had 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for hypertension after
multivariable adjustment, regardless of baseline blood
pressure level.
• Body mass index and adherence to Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension diet were modifiable risk factors asso-
ciated with hypertension in blacks and whites.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given that racial differences in hypertension emerged
before 30 years of age, primordial prevention should be
considered for blacks at a young age.
• Among potential risk factors for racial disparities in
hypertension, a focus on maintaining optimal body mass
index may be particularly effective.

 Clinic BP Measurements
At each visit, clinic SBP and DBP were measured following a
standardized protocol by trained and certified staff. During the
baseline and Year 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 study visits, BP was
measured using a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer
(W.A. Baum Co., Copiague, NY). During the Year 20, 25, and
30 study visits, BP was recorded using a standard automated
BP measurement monitor (Omron model HEM907XL; Omron
Healthcare, Inc, Lake Forest, IL). To ensure comparability
between the 2 methods, BP measurements at the Year 20 and
25 study visits were calibrated to random-0 sphygmo-
manometer values based on simultaneous readings from
both devices using a Y connector on a subset (n=906) of
CARDIA participants.13 At all study visits, each participant’s
arm circumference was measured at the midpoint between
the acromion and olecranon of the right arm to determine the
appropriate cuff size. Participants were asked to sit quietly in
a comfortable posture with feet flat on the floor for at least
5 minutes before having their BP measured. Three readings,
each separated by at least 30 seconds, were performed with
the participant’s right arm positioned at heart level. Each BP
measurement was rounded to the nearest even number and
recorded. The average of the second and third readings was
used to define BP at each visit. Incident hypertension was
defined by the first visit at which a participant had mean SBP
≥130 mm Hg, mean DBP ≥80 mm Hg or self-reported use of
antihypertensive medication. Incident elevated BP or hyper-
tension was defined by the first visit at which a participant
had mean SBP ≥120 mm Hg, mean DBP ≥80 mm Hg, or self-
reported use of antihypertensive medication.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics were calculated for the overall
population and for blacks and whites, separately. Statistical
significance of differences in participant characteristics
across race was determined using t tests and chi-square
tests, as appropriate. Cumulative incidence of hypertension
from age 18 through 55 years was calculated by race/sex
groups (ie, black males, black females, white males, and white
females) using the practical incidence estimator accounting
for the competing risk of death.14 This method is a modified
Kaplan–Meier approach that estimates incidence of disease
using age as the time scale. Specifically, we estimated age-
specific incidence of hypertension up to 55 years of age. If a
participant did not develop hypertension, they were included
in analyses through age 55 years, at which time they were
censored. We did not calculate cumulative incidence of
hypertension beyond age 55 years because there were
insufficient data for participants of both race/sex groups
beyond this age. Cumulative incidence of hypertension
through age 55 years was also calculated by race within
categories of baseline SBP (ie, <110, 110–119, and 120–
129 mm Hg), DBP (ie, <70, 70–74 and 75–79 mm Hg), and
SBP/DBP (ie, SBP/DBP <110/70, 110–119/70–74, and
120–129/75–79 mm Hg). For analysis of SBP/DBP cate-
gories, participants with BP in 2 categories (eg, SBP
<110 mm Hg and DBP between 70 and 74 mm Hg) were
designated into the higher category. Cumulative incidence of
elevated BP or hypertension from age 18 through 55 years
was calculated by race/sex groups using the practical
incidence estimator by race/sex groups, overall, and within
categories of baseline SBP, DBP, and SBP/DBP. A log-rank
test was used to determine the statistical significance of
differences in cumulative incidence of elevated BP or
hypertension between groups.
Interval-censored Weibull regression models were used to
calculate the hazard ratio for incident hypertension compar-
ing blacks with whites within categories of baseline SBP,
DBP, and SBP/DBP. Model 1 included adjustment for age and
sex. Model 2 included adjustment for factors included in the
FHS (Framingham Heart Study) hypertension risk score: age,
sex, BMI, SBP, DBP, cigarette smoking, and parental history
of hypertension. Model 3 included adjustment for the
variables in model 2 and the highest level of education
obtained, physical fitness, serum uric acid level, alcohol
consumption, and the DASH diet adherence score. Values of
covariables were not updated following baseline because we
were interested in analyzing incidence over a long time
horizon. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for incident
hypertension associated with risk factors at baseline were
calculated using interval-censored Weibull regression for
blacks and whites, separately, and within categories of
SBP/DBP (ie, SBP <110 and DBP <70, 110–119 or 70–74,
and 120–129 or 75–79 mm Hg). Continuous variables were
modeled so that prevalence ratios represent 1 standard
deviation difference in risk factor level (eg, 5 kg/m2 for BMI).
All models that were stratified by SBP/DBP categories
included adjustment for SBP and DBP as continuous variables
to account for potential residual confounding. The above
analyses were repeated to calculate multivariable-adjusted
hazard ratios for incident elevated BP or hypertension as the
outcome for blacks and whites, separately, and within
categories of SBP/DBP. We conducted a sensitivity analysis
among participants with valid clinic BP measurements at the
baseline examination and during at least 4 follow-up exam-
inations (n=3341). Analyses were conducted using SAS
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
At baseline, the mean age of participants was 24.7 years,
42.4% were men, and 49.3% were black. Compared with

 whites, blacks were younger, had fewer years of education,
were less physically fit, and were less likely to consume
moderate-to-heavy amounts of alcohol and adhere to the
DASH diet and more likely to smoke cigarettes and have a
parental history of hypertension. Blacks also had a higher
mean BMI and SBP and lower mean serum uric acid level
compared with whites (Table 1).
Over 30 years of follow-up, 2040 participants developed
hypertension. Among these participants, 1050 (51.4%) met
SBP and/or DBP criteria alone (ie, SBP ≥130 mm Hg or DBP
≥80 mm Hg, but not taking antihypertensive medication),

incidence of hypertension was 75.5% in black men, 75.7% in
black women, 54.5% in white men, and 40.0% in white women
(Figure 1 and Table S1). Black men and women developed
hypertension at younger ages compared with white men and
women (Table 2). There was a graded increase in cumulative
incidence of hypertension with higher baseline SBP/DBP
levels in blacks and whites (Figure 2 and Table S2). The
subgroups with the highest cumulative incidence of hyper-
tension between 18 and 55 years of age were blacks with
SBP/DBP 120 to 129/75 to 79 mm Hg (cumulative inci-
dence, 88.1%) and SBP/DBP 110 to 119/70 to 74 mm Hg

74 mm Hg (52.6%) and <110/70 mm Hg (32.7%). Cumula-
tive incidence of elevated BP or hypertension by race and sex
and by baseline category of BP level is presented in Figures
S1 and S2. The number and percentage of individuals who
developed hypertension in each baseline BP category are
presented in Table S3.
After adjustment for age and sex and within each baseline
SBP, DBP, and SBP/DBP category, risk for hypertension was
�2 times higher for blacks compared with whites (Table 3).
There were statistically significant differences in the black-
white hazard ratio for hypertension across SBP and SBP/DBP
levels with higher hazard ratios at lower BP levels (P values for
interaction, <0.05). After full multivariable adjustment, blacks
had 1.5 to 2 times the risk for hypertension compared with
whites within each baseline BP category. Differences in the
black-white hazard ratio for hypertension across baseline SBP,
DBP, or SBP/DBP levels were not statistically significant after
multivariable adjustment (all P values for interaction, >0.2).

 After full multivariable adjustment, blacks also had �1.5 to 2
times the risk for elevated BP or hypertension compared with
whites within each baseline BP category (Table S4).
Parental history of hypertension and higher BMI, serum
uric acid, and baseline SBP/DBP categories were each
associated with an increased risk for hypertension in blacks
and whites (Table 4). A higher DASH diet adherence score
was associated with a lower risk for hypertension in blacks
and whites. Female sex and higher levels of physical fitness
were associated with a lower risk for hypertension in whites,
but not blacks. Older age was associated with a higher risk for
hypertension in blacks, but not whites. Risk factors associ-
ated with incident elevated BP or hypertension in blacks and
whites are presented in Table S5.
Black race and higher BMI were associated with a higher
risk
for
hypertension
within
each
SBP/DBP
category

sion were associated with a higher risk for hypertension
among participants with SBP/DBP <110/70 mm Hg and
110 to 119/70 to 74 mm Hg. Higher serum uric acid was

Discussion
In the current study, the cumulative incidence of hypertension
by age 55 years was substantially higher for black men and

 SBP/DBP were associated with a higher incidence of
hypertension in blacks and whites. Higher adherence to the
DASH diet was associated with a lower incidence of
hypertension in blacks and whites.
The higher incidence of hypertension in blacks compared
with whites in the current study is consistent with previous
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.3–8,15,16 In a previous
analysis of the CARDIA study, 10-year incidence of hyperten-
sion was 16.4% in black men, 13.1% in black women, 7.8% in
white men, and 3.2% in white women.3 Additionally, in the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, 10-year incidence
of hypertension in blacks was more than 2 times higher than
that of whites.16 Among adults free of hypertension at age
45 years in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis),
a higher cumulative incidence of hypertension in blacks
compared with whites was also present through 75 years of
age.15 These studies used the 7th report of the Joint National
Committee
(JNC7)
definition
of
hypertension
(ie,
SBP
≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg or antihypertensive med-
ication use). The current study extends previous research by
reporting the incidence of hypertension following young black
and white adults from 18 through 55 years of age using the
2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline definition of hypertension (ie,
SBP ≥130 mm Hg or DBP ≥80 mm Hg or antihypertensive
medication use). Racial differences in incident hypertension
emerged before 30 years of age, a finding that is consistent
with the AHA Scientific Statement on Cardiovascular Health in
African Americans, and suggests that primordial prevention
should be considered for blacks at a young age.17
It has been hypothesized that blacks have a higher
incidence of hypertension compared with whites attributed
to higher BP beginning in childhood.18 However, studies have
consistently reported a stronger progression to hypertension
in blacks compared with whites.19–21 A meta-analysis of 50
cohort studies reported stronger tracking of BP from child-
hood into adulthood for blacks.19 A recent cross-sectional
study using Markov modeling of NHANES data indicated that
transitions from lower to higher BP categories occur at a
young age, particularly among blacks.20 Additionally, a
prospective cohort study using electronic health record data
reported that progression from prehypertension is acceler-
ated in blacks.21 Risk for hypertension in the current study

 was 1.5 to 2 times higher in blacks than whites after
multivariable adjustment, a disparity that was present at all
BP levels investigated. The finding that blacks with SBP/DBP
<110/70 mm Hg at baseline (ie, when participants were
aged 18–30 years) have a higher risk for developing hyper-
tension than their white counterparts suggests that racial
disparities in hypertension are not solely attributed to higher
BP levels beginning in childhood. Racial differences in factors,
including the maintenance of health behaviors, may also play
an important role in the higher incidence of hypertension in
blacks compared with whites.21–23
Higher BMI, cigarette smoking, parental history of hyper-
tension, lower level of education, higher alcohol use, and
higher serum uric acid level are well-established risk factors
for hypertension.24–29 Most of these risk factors are more
common among blacks compared with whites. Also, higher
levels of physical fitness and adherence to DASH diet have
been associated with reductions in BP and lower risk for
hypertension among blacks and whites.30,31 In the JHS
(Jackson Heart Study), a cohort comprised exclusively of
blacks, higher BMI and physical inactivity and a less heart
healthy diet were all modifiable health behaviors associated
with an increased risk for incident hypertension.32 In the
current study, parental history of hypertension and higher
BMI, serum uric acid level, and baseline SBP/DBP were each
associated with developing hypertension in blacks and whites.
A higher DASH diet adherence score was associated with a
lower risk for hypertension in blacks and whites. Also, higher
levels of physical fitness were associated with a lower risk for
developing hypertension in whites, but not blacks. Given the
steep increase in weight occurring among black young adults
as they grew older, previously reported in the CARDIA study,
and the association between BMI and incident hypertension in
the JHS, primordial prevention aimed at reducing BMI may be
particularly effective.32,33
A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute advisory on
Primary Prevention of Hypertension and the Lancet Commis-
sion on Hypertension has identified the promotion of a
healthy lifestyle in childhood and young adulthood, with a
particular focus on lowering caloric intake combined with an
increase in physical activity, as critical in the prevention of
hypertension.34,35 The current study supports these recom-
mendations and suggests that primordial prevention begin-
ning at a young age may be effective in preventing

 hypertension in some young adults, but may not fully
eliminate disparities in hypertension incidence by race. Risk
for developing hypertension was much higher in blacks
compared with whites, regardless of baseline BP level, even
after multivariable adjustment. Given the interaction of
genetic and environmental factors in determining one’s risk
for hypertension,36 more-detailed genotyping, as well as
phenotyping of risk factors associated with the development
of hypertension, may help identify the reasons underlying this
racial disparity in hypertension.
The strengths of this study include the use of a large,
population-based cohort with representation from 4 US cities
and collection of data beginning in early adulthood with
30 years of follow-up. CARDIA collected data in a compre-
hensive fashion, which allowed for the investigation of risk
factors for hypertension. This study also used the 2017 ACC/
AHA BP guideline definitions of elevated BP and hypertension.
Despite these strengths, the current results should be
interpreted in the context of known and potential limitations.
Several covariates, including diet and alcohol use, were self-
reported. Data on dietary sodium intake were not available.
Also, clinic BP was taken 3 times at each study visit, whereas
the recommendations for diagnosing hypertension are often
based on the average BP at 2 or more visits.37 BP was
measured using different devices over the study follow-up;
however, we were able to calibrate measurements to account
for this protocol change. CARDIA only enrolled white and
black adults, and future studies are needed to determine the
cumulative incidence of hypertension from young adulthood
through middle age among other racial and ethnic groups.
In conclusion, blacks have a substantially higher risk for
hypertension compared with whites from young adulthood
through middle age. Racial differences in incident hyperten-
sion became apparent before 30 years of age. By 55 years of
age, 75% of black men and women in the current study
developed hypertension compared with 54% of white men and
40% of white women. The increased risk for hypertension in
blacks was present at all baseline BP levels, suggesting that
higher BP in childhood does not fully explain racial disparities
in hypertension. These findings also underscore the impor-
tance of focusing on modifiable risk factors, including BMI and
adherence to a DASH diet, at an early age for the prevention
of hypertension.
