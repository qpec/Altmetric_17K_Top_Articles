Aims
To evaluate whether the distance from the site of event to an invasive heart centre, acute coronary angiography
(CAG)/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and hospital-level of care (invasive heart centre vs. local hospital)
is associated with survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Nationwide historical follow-up study of 41 186 unselected OHCA patients, in whom resuscitation was attempted be-
tween 2001 and 2013, identified through the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. We observed an increase in the propor-
tion of patients receiving bystander CPR (18% in 2001, 60% in 2013, P < 0.001), achieving return of spontaneous circu-
lation (ROSC) (10% in 2001, 29% in 2013, P< 0.001) and being admitted directly to an invasive centre (26% in 2001,
45% in 2013, P < 0.001). Simultaneously, 30-day survival rose from 5% in 2001 to 12% in 2013, P < 0.001. Among pa-
tients achieving ROSC, a larger proportion underwent acute CAG/PCI (5% in 2001, 27% in 2013, P< 0.001). The pro-
portion of patients undergoing acute CAG/PCI annually in each region was defined as the CAG/PCI index. The follow-
ing variables were associated with lower mortality in multivariable analyses: direct admission to invasive heart centre
(HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.89–0.93), CAG/PCI index (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.25–0.45), population density above 2000 per square
kilometre (HR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.98), bystander CPR (HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.99) and witnessed OHCA (HR 0.87,
95% CI: 0.85–0.89), whereas distance to the nearest invasive centre was not associated with survival.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Admission to an invasive heart centre and regional performance of acute CAG/PCI were associated with improved
survival in OHCA patients, whereas distance to the invasive centre was not. These results support a centralized
strategy for immediate post-resuscitation care in OHCA patients.

Introduction
Surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is highly dependent
on time to treatment. Accordingly, early cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR) and immediate post-resuscitation care are crucial.
Coronary angiography (CAG) is recommended for OHCA patients
of presumed cardiac etiology.1,2 However, it remains elusive whether
distance to an invasive heart centre affects survival in OHCA patients
and whether longer transportation to distant invasive heart centres is
acceptable for providing specialized intervention and critical care. In
Denmark, a centralized strategy has been implemented for the treat-
ment of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).3
Prehospital electrocardiographic diagnosis and field-triage of these
patients directly to invasive heart centres for primary percutaneous
coronary intervention (primary PCI) are routine, whereby local hos-
pitals are bypassed. This strategy has proven successful in reducing
treatment delay and mortality in STEMI patients.4 It is unknown if a
STEMI-like approach with field-triage directly to invasive heart
centres implying a longer prehospital transportation time is associ-
ated with lower mortality in patients with OHCA.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate if survival in
OHCA patients is associated with: (i) distance to an invasive heart
centre; (ii) performance of acute CAG/PCI within 6 h of the first con-
tact with the health care system, and (iii) hospital-level-of care (field-
triage to invasive heart centre vs. admission to local hospital).
Methods
Design
This was a historical follow-up study of an unselected OHCA population
based on the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. The study period was from
1 January 2001 to 31 December 2013. The Danish Data Protection
Agency (file number 2013-41-1758) and The National Board of Health
approved the study. In Denmark, ethics approval is not required for
register-based studies.
Setting
We conducted a nationwide register-based study in Denmark, which has
a population of approximately 5.6 million inhabitants. The emergency
telephone number (1–1-2) is used nationwide, with five regional emer-
gency medical dispatch centres (EMDC) providing telephone-guided
CPR. The Danish emergency medical service (EMS) system is two-tiered,
and operates as a double dispatch service. The first tier involves an ambu-
lance with basic life support (BLS) equipment including a defibrillator. The
ambulance is staffed with two emergency medical technicians (EMTs).
The second tier consists of an anaesthetist-staffed prehospital critical
care team operating a separate vehicle with the capability to provide
advanced life support (ALS) and endotracheal intubation. In 2010, a heli-
copter emergency medical service (HEMS) was launched with one heli-
copter serving the Eastern part of Denmark and in 2011 one more
helicopter was put into action serving the Western part of Denmark. In
emergency OHCA calls, the EMDC activates the EMS system and the
nearest available ambulance and the prehospital critical care team are dis-
patched. The EMS treatment protocol adheres to the ESC guidelines for
Resuscitation.1 A national consensus on triage of patients with OHCA
was established in 2013 by the Danish Society of Cardiology, recom-
mending acute CAG in patients achieving ROSC and with signs of STEMI,
severe ischaemia, cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, need of
pacing, and in patients without ROSC when a cardiac cause was sus-
pected. A lack of a consensus before 2013 implies that various referral
patterns prevailed in the 5 regions during the study period. Performance
of acute CAG/PCI was only possible when patients were field-triaged dir-
ectly to or transferred to one of the 5 high-volume invasive heart centres
with a 24-h CAG/PCI service; Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus;
Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen; Odense University Hospital, Odense;
Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg and Gentofte Hospital, Gentofte
(until 2012). In Denmark, therapeutic hypothermia was gradually imple-
mented between 2004 and 2006 in the intensive care units (invasive heart
centres and local hospitals). Since 2006, therapeutic hypothermia has
been used universally in Denmark as recommended by ESC Guidelines
for Resuscitation.1
Population
The study population comprised all OHCA patients identified in the
Danish Cardiac Arrest Register. Patients were included whenever a clin-
ical condition was followed by a resuscitation attempt either by a layper-
son or by the EMTs supported by the pre-hospital critical care team. The
Danish Cardiac Arrest Register does not register patients with obvious
late signs of death in whom resuscitation efforts are not initiated, and
such patients were therefore not included in the study. Furthermore, pa-
tients were excluded if their civil registration number was invalid or miss-
ing and if they were foreign citizens or had emigrated.
Registries
Following every resuscitation effort, the prehospital critical care team and
EMTs completes an Utstein template and a medical registration form.
These mandatory documents are stored in the Danish Cardiac Arrest
Register. The specific time points for the emergency call, arrival on scene,
departure from scene and arrival at the local hospital or invasive centre
are registered by the EMDC and the EMTs in a separate EMS database.
The following data were derived from the Danish Cardiac Arrest
Register and the EMS database; date/time of cardiac arrest and EMS call;
location (private home or public); address of OHCA; whether the event
was witnessed by a layperson, healthcare personnel or EMS; and whether
bystander CPR and/or defibrillation was performed, initially recorded
rhythm [asystole, pulseless electrical activity (PEA), ventricular fibrillation
(VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT)], time of first rhythm analysis by the
EMS and a status of the patient’s condition upon arrival to hospital, e.g.
ROSC or dead. Hospital level of care (centre with acute CAG/PCI facili-
ties or local hospital) and the patient’s home address were obtained from
the Danish National Patient Registry. The Western Denmark Heart
Registry
(VDHD)
and
the
Eastern
Denmark
Heart
Registries
(PATS = Patient Analysis & Tracking System) databases provided individ-
ual baseline characteristics and procedure-specific information on all
CAGs and PCIs. Mortality data were acquired from the Danish Civil
Registration System, which contains daily updated vital status on all
Danish citizens. Valid individual linkages between all registries were ob-
tained by use of the unique ten-digit civil registration number assigned to
all Danish citizens.
Distance to invasive heart centres
The driving distance from the scene of the event to the nearest invasive
centre was calculated in kilometres (km) using the Danish geographic grid
combined with the Danish Address Web Application Programming
Interface Routing Machine.
Statistical analyses
Binary data are presented as percentages and continuous variables as me-
dians with inter-quartile range (IQR). We compared binary variables and

continuous variables using the v2 test and the Kruskal–Wallis test, as ap-
propriate. A P-value <0.05 (2-sided) was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Follow-up was initiated on the date of cardiac arrest and ended on
the date of death or April 27 2015 according to precedence. For tem-
poral trends, we compared binary variables and continuous variables
using non-parametric test of trend—an extension of the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion analyses were performed for calculation of hazard ratios (HR), and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine the association between the
covariates and mortality and to adjust for potential confounders. The as-
sumptions of linearity were assessed graphically. Variables associated
with mortality in the univariable Cox regression analyses were included
in the multivariable Cox regression models. Performance of CAG and
PCI are a priori associated with improved outcome, i.e. only performed
in those achieving ROSC or being admitted with ongoing CPR.
Accordingly, in the Cox regression analyses each patient were assigned a
CAG/PCI index defined as the proportion of patients undergoing acute
CAG/PCI (within 6 h of the first contact with the health care system) an-
nually in each region to reflect the current use of CAG/PCI in the region
where the patient lived. Missing values among covariates were replaced
by using multiple imputations. Logistic regression modelling was used for
binary covariates, ordinal logistic regression modelling was used for cat-
egorical variables with more than two values, and linear regression mod-
elling was used for continuous covariates. We imputed 10 data sets. Data
management and statistical analyses were performed using STATA SE
14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
We identified 43 206 OHCA patients in the Danish Cardiac Arrest
Register. We excluded 2020 patients because they had an invalid or
missing civil registration number, had emigrated or were foreign citi-
zens. The final study population comprised 41 186 OHCA patients.
The cumulative 30-day survival was 9% (95% CI: 8–9%) (n = 3550).
The median follow-up time for patients with ROSC was 28 (2–1404)
days. A total of 8.419 (20%) patients achieved ROSC of which 605
(7%) were conscious/awake at admission to hospital. Table 1 shows
geographical characteristics, patient characteristics and survival strati-
fied according to the five Danish regions. Geographical characteristics
differed significantly, e.g. distance to invasive heart centre and popula-
tion density. Furthermore, the proportion of patients admitted dir-
ectly to an invasive heart centre, acute CAG/PCI and 30-day survival
differed. A total of 1.785 (21%) patients with ROSC had an acute
CAG performed and 1.262 (15%) patients had an acute PCI per-
formed after the CAG. More than 90% of the CAG and PCI proced-
ures were performed within 6 h after EMS call. The highest 30-day
survival rates were seen in the Capital Region (10%) and in the
Central Denmark Region (9%).
T
emporal changes in 30-day survival,
bystander CPR and ROSC
Throughout the study period, we observed a large increase in
the overall 30-day survival (5% in 2001, 12% in 2013, P < 0.001)
(Figure 1A). Thirty-day survival rose significantly over time in patients
with and without bystander CPR (P < 0.001) with the largest increase
being observed in those without bystander CPR (3% in 2001, 10% in
2013, P < 0.001) (Figure 1B).
A major temporal increase was also observed in the proportion of
patients receiving bystander CPR (18% in 2001, 60% in 2013,
P < 0.001) (Figure 2A) and in the proportion of patients achieving
ROSC (10% in 2001, 29% in 2013) (Figure 2B). Bystander CPR was
associated with lower mortality in the multivariable analyses, (HR of
0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–0.99, P = 0.005)) (Table 2).
Admission to invasive centre and
performance of acute CAG and PCI
A total of 38% (n = 15 822) of patients with OHCA were not admit-
ted to hospital but declared dead at the site of event. Subgroup ana-
lyses revealed considerable heterogeneity between the regions with
regard to the proportions of patients declared dead at the site of
event. Among the remaining patients (n = 25 364), the majority was
admitted to a local hospital (n = 17 991). An increase in survival over
time was observed in those admitted directly to an invasive heart
centre (Figure 1C). However, the proportion of patients admitted dir-
ectly to invasive heart centres differed significantly between regions
(Figure 2C). Admission directly to an invasive centre was independ-
ently associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR= 0.91 (95% CI:
0.89–0.93, P < 0.001)) (Table 2). Among patients achieving ROSC, the
use of acute CAG/PCI increased significantly during the study period,
with significant differences between the regions (Figure 2D). Regional
performance of acute CAG/PCI following OHCA (CAG/PCI index)
was associated with a lower mortality, revealing an adjusted HR of
0.33 (95% CI: 0.25–0.45, P < 0.001) (Table 2).
Return of spontaneous circulation,
hospital level-of-care, acute CAG/PCI
and 30-day survival according to distance
from the site of event to the invasive
heart centre
The proportion of patients achieving ROSC declined significantly at
distances above 5 kilometres from the nearest invasive centre
(P < 0.001) (Figure 3A). Increasing distance from the scene of the
event to the invasive heart centre was associated with a lower pro-
portion of patients admitted directly to an invasive heart centre
(P < 0.001) (Figure 3B) and a lower use of acute CAG/PCI (P = 0.005)
(Figure 3C). A distance below 5 km from the site of the event to the
invasive heart centre was associated with lower mortality in the uni-
variable analysis (unadjusted HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89–0.96, P < 0.01),
but not in the multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96–
1.07, P = 0.70) (Table 2).
Population density and 30-day survival
The population density determined from the zip code of the site of
the event was incorporated in the analyses for each patient. The
Capital Region of Denmark had the highest population density and
the shortest distance to an invasive centre (Table 1). In the univariable
analyses, a population density above 2000 per zip code per m2 was
associated with lower mortality (unadjusted HR of 0.95 (95% CI:
0.92–0.97, P < 0.001) (Table 2). Population density remained inde-
pendently associated with lower mortality, corresponding to an ad-
justed HR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89–0.98, P < 0.001) (Table 2).

Discussion
This nationwide study is currently the largest to investigate the asso-
ciation between OHCA patients’ survival and distance to invasive
heart centre, performance of acute CAG/PCI and hospital-level of
care. The three main results of the study were, first, that admission to
an invasive heart centre and regional use of acute CAG/PCI were
associated with improved 30-day survival; second, distance from the
site of the event to the invasive heart centre was not associated with
survival; third, survival was associated with population density, by-
stander CPR, witnessed arrest and shockable rhythm. These results
support a strategy that prioritizes the establishment of an efficient

prehospital organization over the establishment of multiple geo-
graphically distributed invasive heart centres.5,6
Few studies have assessed the association between distance to hos-
pital and survival in OHCA patients,7,8 and all of these studies were
based on selected study populations small in number. The present
study therefore extends previous data. We expected that a longer dis-
tance from the site of event to an invasive heart centre would be asso-
ciated with a lower survival in OHCA patients. Nevertheless, a higher
survival rate was seen among OHCA patients only within 5 kilometres
of the invasive heart centre. More importantly, in multivariable analyses
the distance from the site of event to the nearest invasive heart centre
was not associated with survival. Our results reflect that successful pre-
hospital CPR is the key to survival, regardless of whether it is provided
by a bystander or EMS, which should ideally be independent of the dis-
tance to the invasive centre. However, one would still expect an asso-
ciation between distance and outcome in those treated with PCI,
consistent with the findings in STEMI patients.3 Most likely, a larger
sample size is needed to prove this association in OHCA patients.
No randomized studies exist on acute CAG/PCI following OHCA.
However, several small observational studies have assessed this issue

using the actual performance of CAG/PCI at patient level.9–11 It is un-
surprising that a strong association then appears simply because
CAG/PCI is performed mainly in patients achieving ROSC, with the
few exceptions of selected patients transferred to acute CAG/PCI
during ongoing CPR. In the present study, we used an index for
CAG/PCI activity defined by the proportion of patients having acute
CAG/PCI performed annually in each region. This index accordingly
reflects the regional level of care with regard to the performance of
acute CAG/PCI, and it was significantly associated with improved sur-
vival. Whether admission to an invasive heart centre is a surrogate
for a higher level of care, performance of acute CAG/PCI or both,
our results underline the importance of a centralized post-
resuscitation care strategy in OHCA patients. This is in consensus
with the statement from the European association for percutaneous
cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI)/stent for life (SFL) groups as
well as recent ESC Guidelines for Resuscitation.1,12
It is hardly surprising that population density is associated with sur-
vival; though, the present study is the first to implement population
density in a 12-year survival analysis among OHCA patients. Our re-
sults are consistent with those of previous studies documenting that
survival is higher among OHCA patients in crowded areas, e.g. air-
ports, than in rural areas.13,14 The association between population
density and survival remained significant in the multivariable analyses.
However, population density clearly differed from region to region.
We cannot rule out that population density is, in part, a proxy for the
region and a proxy for distance to the invasive heart centre.
Accordingly, one would assume that the region with the highest
population density and the shortest distance to an invasive heart
centre, i.e. the Capital Region of Denmark (A), would perform signifi-
cantly better than the other regions. Nonetheless, the survival rates
were comparable in three other regions (B, C, E) with significantly
lower population densities and longer distances to the nearest inva-
sive heart centre. One explanation may be that the longer distance
and lower population density were counter-balanced by a signifi-
cantly higher rate of acute CAG/PCI in those regions (B, C, E).
Hence, if the association between rate of acute CAG/PCI and survival
is causal, a more frequent use of acute CAG/PCI in the Capital
Region of Denmark should produce an even higher survival rate in
the future. This is, of course, entirely speculative, and it remains to be
evaluated in a randomized study whether or not the association be-
tween acute CAG/PCI and survival is causal.
Consistent with previous studies, bystander CPR was associated
with survival. However, the increase in bystander CPR has partially
been used to explain the overall increase in survival.15–17 The novelty
of our study is that the relative increase in survival was even higher
among those not receiving bystander CPR and that the overall num-
ber of patients achieving ROSC rose. The explanation for this may be
improved EMS skills. More importantly, our results indicate that the
improved bystander CPR rate is not the only reason for improved
survival following OHCA, which is in accordance with a previous
study by Chan et al.18
Whether improved survival observed in patients admitted directly
to invasive heart centres is caused by increased use of acute CAG/
PCI, therapeutic hypothermia, overall advanced care or selection bias

cannot be determined by the present study. Nevertheless, the total-
ity of components available for optimization by high-volume invasive
heart centres represents an argument in favour of centralized post-
resuscitation care in OHCA patients.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is the combination of large registries and
databases, by far the largest study conducted to date in Denmark in
OHCA patients, providing a detailed description of the association
between the distance from the site of the event to an invasive heart
centre, acute CAG/PCI, hospital level-of-care and survival in patients
with OHCA. Our study has limitations. First, it is observational in na-
ture and therefore we cannot rule out some element of selection
bias. In this context, the decision to discontinue a resuscitation at-
tempt as well as the decision to transport the patient to an invasive
heart centre or a local hospital was left at the discretion of the anaes-
thetist. However, due to the fact that this was an unselected OHCA
population, it is important to emphasize that the potential benefits of
centralization may be even better in a population of OHCA patients
of presumed cardiac origin. Further, the non-randomized study de-
sign does not allow the demonstration of any causal relationship be-
tween survival and hospital-level-of care as well as acute CAG/PCI.
We do acknowledge that our findings are hypothesis generating only.
Second, it would have been interesting if ECG data were available,
which would enable stratified analyses in patients with and without
ST-elevations. However, several studies are questioning the value of
the ECG in the early post-arrest course as regard to the STEMI diag-
nosis and patients triage for acute CAG/PCI.19 Furthermore, import-
ant factors about CPR quality, no-flow time (interval between the
arrest and the onset of basic life support) and low-flow time (interval
between the arrest and ROSC) were not taken into account, due to
lack of data. Additionally, data on advanced outcome measurements
as target temperature hypothermia and the Cerebral Performance
Category score were not available. Thus, it was not possible to take
these factors into account and this must be considered as an import-
ant limitation, even though the evidence to support hypothermia
treatment is sparse. Mild hypothermia is standard care in comatose
survivors after cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm and has been
extrapolated to survivors with non-shockable rhythm. However, few
randomised trials have reported improved outcomes with mild hypo-
thermia compared with normothermia in OHCA patients.20
Recently, the TTM-trial found no difference in overall mortality or
CPC score at a targeted temperature of 33 �C vs. 36 �C.21 Thus, one
could question if normothermia is just as good as hypothermia.
Third, the site of OHCA was unavailable in 23% of the cases and
therefore substituted by the home address when calculating the

distance from scene of event to the invasive centre. However, ap-
proximately 80% of OHCA occur at home, indicating that the dis-
tance calculation was correct in 95% of cases (0.77þ 0.23*0.8).13
Finally, a number of patients had missing data, but comparing esti-
mates from the observed dataset with estimates from the imputed
datasets did not significantly change our results.
Conclusion
Immediate admission to an invasive heart centre and acute CAG/PCI
are associated with improved survival in patients with OHCA,
whereas distance from site of the event to the invasive heart centre
was not. Our results support the establishment of few high-volume
invasive heart centres and suggest that OHCA patients should field-
triage directly to these centres for optimal post-resuscitation care,
regardless of the distance. Clinical randomized studies are needed to
clarify the causality between acute CAG/PCI and survival.
