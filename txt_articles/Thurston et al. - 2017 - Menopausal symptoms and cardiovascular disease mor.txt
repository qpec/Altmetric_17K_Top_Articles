Abstract
Objective—Studies have linked vasomotor symptoms to markers of cardiovascular disease risk, 
yet few have considered clinical cardiovascular events. Data suggest that associations may depend 
upon the age that symptoms occur. We examined associations between vasomotor symptoms and 
cardiovascular events and endothelial function, considering age of symptom onset.
Methods—The Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation enrolled women referred for coronary 
angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia. 254 women aged >50 years, postmenopausal, 
with both ovaries, not taking hormone therapy underwent a baseline evaluation, were followed 
annually (median=6.0 years), and the National Death Index was searched to ascertain

 cardiovascular disease mortality (median=9.3 years). A subset of participants underwent brachial 
artery ultrasound for flow mediated dilation. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to 
determine vasomotor symptom groups [symptoms beginning <age 42 (early onset), beginning ≥42 
(later onset), never] which were examined in relation to cardiovascular events and flow mediated 
dilation in Cox proportional hazard and linear regression models.
Results—Women reporting early onset vasomotor symptoms (HR=3.35, 95%CI=1.23, 7.86, p=.
005) and women who never had vasomotor symptoms (HR=2.17, 95%CI=1.02, 4.62, p=.05) had 
higher cardiovascular disease mortality than women with later onset symptoms (multivariable 
models). Women with early onset vasomotor symptoms had lower flow mediated dilation than 
women with later onset symptoms (b=-4.31, SE=2.10, p=.04, multivariable).
Conclusions—Women with signs and symptoms of ischemia who had vasomotor symptoms 
beginning early in midlife had higher cardiovascular disease mortality and reduced endothelial 
function relative to women with later onset symptoms. Future research should evaluate the 
vascular phenotype of women with early midlife vasomotor symptoms.

Introduction
Eighty percent of women experience menopausal symptoms, particularly vasomotor 
symptoms (VMS; hot flashes, night sweats) at some point during the menopause 
transition.1,2 While traditionally believed to persist for several years around the final 
menstrual period, newer data indicate that VMS start earlier in life, in many cases in the late 
reproductive years when a woman is still menstruating.3 These symptoms also appear to 
persist much longer than previously thought; on average a decade.4,5
VMS are well-known to be associated with poorer quality of life, mental health, and 
functioning during the menopause transition.6,7 However, recent data also suggest a potential 
relationship between VMS and physical health, particularly indicators of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk. More frequent or severe VMS have been linked to adverse CVD risk 
factors8-10 and subclinical CVD, such as increased intima media thickness,11 aortic 
calcification,12 and reduced brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD),12,13 a marker of 
endothelial dysfunction.
As existing studies were largely conducted among midlife women, few have examined 
relationships between VMS and clinical CVD events. The few studies examining clinical 
CVD events yield mixed and inconclusive findings.14-16 Further, emerging data indicate that 
associations between VMS and CVD risk may depend on the age at which VMS occur,15,17 
yet an age-dependence of VMS-CVD risk associations is not routinely examined. Thus, 
there is an important gap in knowledge about age-dependent relationships between VMS and 
adverse CVD events.

 Accordingly, we investigated associations between the history of menopausal symptoms, 
principally VMS, and risk for non-fatal CVD events and CVD mortality among women 
participating in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Women’s Ischemia 
Syndrome Evaluation (WISE). We considered the age at which symptoms began, as well as 
the role of CVD risk factors, in VMS-CVD risk associations. Further, as VMS have been 
hypothesized to be associated with endothelial dysfunction,12 we additionally tested 
relations between these menopausal symptoms and brachial artery FMD.
Methods
Study Participants
The WISE is an NHLBI-sponsored four-center prospective cohort study of 936 women 
undergoing clinically ordered coronary angiography for further evaluation of symptoms and 
signs of suspected myocardial ischemia described elsewhere.18 Briefly, exclusion criteria 
included emergency referral, pregnancy, cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association class 
IV congestive heart failure (CHF), acute ischemic syndrome (defined as acute myocardial 
infarction (MI) or unstable angina) within one month prior to study entry, coronary 
revascularization within 6-months prior to entry, conditions other than ischemic heart 
disease likely to be fatal or requiring frequent hospitalization within 4-years, 
contraindication to provocative myocardial stress testing, and a condition likely to affect 
study retention (alcoholism, drug abuse, or severe psychiatric illness). Among women 
screened and meeting criteria, 50% agreed to participate. All women provided written, 
informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines. The study was approved by the 
institutional review board at each WISE clinical site and the data coordinating center.
The analytic sample was comprised of 254 WISE participants who were postmenopausal 
(determined by methods previously described)19 and over the age of 50 (to allow adequate 
time for a woman to report on her history of VMS); who had both ovaries; and who were not 
currently taking hormone therapy (HT). Additional analyses of brachial artery FMD 
included 104 women in that substudy. Women undergoing FMD measurement were more 
likely to be white (p=0.003), to have lower SBP (p=0.01), and were less likely to have used 
HT (p=0.02), but did not differ on any other characteristic from the larger WISE sample.
Procedures
At the time of coronary angiography, baseline evaluation was completed that included 
collection of demographic, medical history, detailed reproductive history and exogenous 
hormone use, psychosocial and symptom data from 1998 to 2002, and a fasting blood 
sample as described previously (cross-sectional phase).18 Participants were then followed 
annually for fatal and nonfatal CVD events for a median of 6 years; subsequently, the 
National Death Index was searched to ascertain CVD mortality, which extended follow up 
time for mortality to a total (median) of 9.3 years.
Menopausal Symptoms—Menopausal symptom history was obtained in the 
reproductive questionnaire. Women were asked “Have you ever had menopausal symptoms,

 such as hot flashes or night sweats?” (yes/no). If yes, women were queried about the age of 
first symptom onset.
CVD Mortality and Non-Fatal CVD Events—Method of assessing CVD mortality and 
non-fatal CVD events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke) are 
described in detail elsewhere.20 Briefly, women were contacted at 3 months and annually 
thereafter regarding adverse CVD events or hospitalizations for up to 9 years (median, 6.0 
[interquartile range, 3.2-7.1]). For deaths, we obtained a death certificate, records of any 
related CVD hospitalizations during the preceding follow-up time period, and/or description 
by a primary relative regarding the circumstances surrounding the death. A National Death 
Index search was subsequently conducted and death certificates obtained which extended the 
follow-up, for mortality only, to a median of 9.3 years (interquartile range 8.4-10.3 years). 
The cause of death was reviewed by two cardiologist investigators masked to the clinical and 
angiographic data; a third reviewer was used in discrepant death classification.
Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD)—A sub-sample of WISE participants at the four clinical 
sites participated in the brachial artery ultrasound sub-study,21,22 104 of whom met criteria 
for inclusion in the present analysis. All short and long-acting vasoactive medications were 
withheld for 24-48 hours, respectively. Resting brachial artery diameter was measured with 
B-mode ultrasonography with a 7.5-MHz probe. A blood pressure cuff placed distal to the 
brachial artery was inflated to 40 mm Hg greater than systolic blood pressure for 4 minutes. 
Brachial artery diameter was reassessed for 2 minutes after cuff deflation. Quantitative 
analysis was performed at a core laboratory (University of Pittsburgh) by investigators 
masked to subject identifiers. Images were digitized, and calibrated electronic calipers were 
used to measure brachial artery diameter with the intima-media interface to define arterial 
borders. Three measurements were made in each analyzed frame and averaged (intraclass 
correlation coefficient between 2 independent observers =0.94).22 FMD was calculated as 
FMD=100x (peak diameter after cuff deflation – resting diameter)/resting diameter.
Covariates—Covariates derived from the baseline WISE examination included 
demographic, medical history (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia), and current and 
prior smoking. Steroid and protein assay methods were used by the WISE hormone core 
laboratory to determine estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone levels.23 The WISE 
reproductive status questionnaire includes a detailed history of menarche, date of last 
menstrual period, current and prior menstrual cycling patterns, prior reproductive events 
(pregnancy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy), and current and prior oral contraceptive or HT 
use. Documentation of type of gynecological surgery was obtained when the reproductive 
hormone levels in the blood were not consistent with the reported status during expert 
consensus review for menopausal status determination. A core laboratory (blinded to 
historical or clinical data) used in previous NHLBI-sponsored multicenter trials analyzed 
baseline coronary angiography for CAD presence and severity,24 including quantitative 
assessment of the presence of obstructive CAD (defined as 50% or more luminal diameter 
stenosis in one or more epicardial coronary artery), and the WISE CAD severity score using 
previously published methods.24 The WISE CAD severity score was based on percent

 stenosis adjusted for any complete collateral vessels, with the possible range of score being 
5 (no detectable stenosis) to 100 (multiple severe lesions).
Statistical Analysis
For women with a history of VMS, we used ROC analysis to estimate the optimal VMS age 
cut-points, yielding three groups: VMS occurring before age 42 (“early onset VMS”), VMS 
occurring at age 42 or later (“later onset VMS”), or never experiencing VMS. In descriptive 
comparisons, baseline data are reported as frequencies or means ± standard deviation. 
Highly skewed variables are reported as medians (interquartile range). Because of the 
significant differences in age among the three groups, all p-values were age-adjusted using 
analysis of variance. VMS groups were examined in relation to the outcomes of CVD 
mortality, non-fatal CVD events, and combined fatal and non-fatal CVD events using the 
Kaplan-Meier method to estimate rates and generate p-values using the log-rank statistic. 
For combined non-fatal CVD events and CVD mortality, only the first event was used. For 
multivariate modeling, we fitted Cox proportional hazards models to test the association of 
the three VMS groups with CVD mortality after adjusting sequentially for other baseline 
variables. Covariates were chosen among standard coronary risk factors and other baseline 
variables shown in univariate analysis to predict these outcomes. These were added in 
incremental steps: (1) Unadjusted; (2) adjusted for demographic factors; (3) further adjusted 
for presence vs. absence of obstructive CAD; (4) further adjusted for traditional CVD risk 
factors; (5) same as model 4 but substituting the CAD severity score (log transformed 
because of skewed distribution) for the simple presence vs. absence of obstructive CAD. At 
each step, we re-examined the association between the VMS group and CV mortality.
In additional models, we evaluated the VMS onset groups in relation to the FMD in linear 
regression models. Covariates were selected whose univariate association with FMD resulted 
in a p-value of <0.10. Only one variable, race, qualified, yet we additionally forced age and 
CAD into the model. Analyses were conducted with SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
All analyses were two-tailed and alpha=0.05.
Results
The mean age of the women at entry was 66 ± 8 years. The majority (82%) were non-
Hispanic White, over a third (37%) had a BMI>30, 56% had obstructive CAD, and 33% had 
diabetes. Of the 254 participants, 93 (37%) reportedly never had VMS, 40 (16%) had VMS 
that started before age 42 (early onset VMS), and 121 (47%) reported VMS that began after 
age 42 (later onset VMS). Both groups of women with VMS were younger and more often 
reported a history of hypertension than women never reporting VMS, and women with early 
onset VMS had a higher BMI than women with later onset VMS. No other risk factors 
varied between groups (Table 1).
Among the 254 women, 40 (16%) had at least one nonfatal CVD event (over a median of 6 
years) and 56 (22%) had a fatal CVD event (over a median of 9.3 years). Of the 40 women 
with nonfatal CV events, 16 (40%) eventually died of cardiovascular causes. Women with 
early-onset VMS and to a lesser extent women who never reported VMS had significantly 
higher CVD mortality than women who had later onset VMS (Table 2, Figure 1). Non-fatal

 CVD events did not significantly differ among VMS groups. Relations between VMS onset 
group and CVD mortality persisted, and for early onset VMS strengthened, when adjusted 
for multiple covariates (Table 3), even as the overall sample size and number of events was 
reduced due to missing values in covariates (e.g., from 254 women/56 events to 216 
women/44 events).
Women with early onset VMS also had a lower FMD [M(SD) = -2.6% (5.7%)] than either 
the women who never had VMS [M(SD) = 3.0% (6.8%)] or who had later onset VMS 
[M(SD) = 1.8% (7.7%), p’s<0.05]. Notably, the average FMD was negative in the early 
onset VMS group, indicating that on average these women had constriction, instead of 
dilation as expected in response to release of occlusion in response to shear-mediated nitric 
oxide release. Associations persisted when adjusted for covariates (Table 4, Figure 2).
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we excluded women who ever had a history 
of HT use, reducing our analytic sample to N=198; despite the reduced sample size, 
conclusions on the relationship of VMS to CVD mortality remained unchanged (data not 
shown). Second, we restricted all models to women non-missing on all covariates (N=216) 
and findings were unchanged (data not shown). Finally, we considered the additional 
covariates endogenous estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, education, age at menopause, 
and hysterectomy status in primary multivariable models and findings were unchanged (data 
not shown).
Discussion
We found that women with a history of early onset VMS (first VMS occurring before age 42 
years) and to a lesser extent women who never had VMS had higher CVD mortality than 
women who had later onset VMS. Women with early onset VMS also had lower FMD, 
indicating reduced endothelial function, relative to women with later onset VMS. 
Associations were not explained by demographic factors or by standard CVD risk factors.
Emerging data suggests links between VMS and CVD risk. Initial investigations were 
motivated by posthoc findings from large trials of HT showing that the CVD impact of HT 
use may vary as a function of VMS presence.25,26 Subsequent findings from observational 
cohort studies indicated that VMS were associated with a poorer CVD risk factor profile8-10 
and higher subclinical CVD controlling for CVD risk factors.11-13 However, few 
observational studies have included adverse clinical CVD events, in part due to the long 
latency between the onset of VMS, which typically occur at midlife, and the emergence of 
clinical events in women, that typically occur decades later. The few studies examining 
clinical events or mortality have produced mixed findings, some showing positive 
associations,14 others showing inverse associations largely explained by CVD risk factors,16 
and still others showed VMS-CVD relations depending on when in a woman’s lifespan the 
VMS occurred.15
In the present study, VMS showed differential relations with CVD mortality depending on 
the age at which the VMS first occurred. The women who experienced early onset VMS 
were at the highest CVD mortality risk. Notably, several cohort studies indicate that many

 women start their VMS earlier than previously thought. In the Penn Ovarian Aging Study 
over 30% of women reported having VMS at study entry, in their late reproductive years 
when they were still cycling regularly.3 In the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation 
(SWAN), VMS trajectories constructed from VMS assessed prospectively over 13 years of 
the menopause transition were examined in relation to subclinical CVD,17 finding similar to 
the present results, that it was women with early onset VMS who had the highest subclinical 
CVD. Conversely, in the WHI observational study, it was the women with later onset VMS 
(reported at entry) who showed the highest risk.15 The precise nature of the age dependence 
of VMS and the emergence of CVD risk in midlife women requires further investigation. 
However, there is increasing appreciation that the impact of related phenomena (e.g., 
exogenous hormones) on CVD risk may vary by the age or the stage of the woman.27,28
We additionally studied the outcome of brachial artery FMD, a marker of endothelial 
function. Similar to the findings for CVD mortality, the women experiencing early onset 
menopausal symptoms also showed lower FMD, or poorer endothelial function, than women 
with later onset symptoms. Several other reports have found that VMS are associated with 
lower FMD12,13 yet generally did not test an age dependence of these associations and 
largely studied women early in the transition. Similar to clinical events, the impact of 
exogenous hormones on the endothelium appears to vary by age.29 The endothelium is 
critical to multiple aspects of vascular tone and function and has long been known to be 
affected by reproductive factors (e.g., hormones, pregnancy events) in women.30,31 Its 
potential role in VMS and the implications of VMS for vascular health offers an important 
and understudied area of future investigation.
Several additional findings deserved mention. Women who never experienced VMS showed 
elevated CVD mortality risk relative to women who had later onset VMS. Although the 
reason for this finding is not immediately clear, in the present study women who never had 
VMS were older than the other groups, either decreasing the precision in their recall of VMS 
or increasing the opportunity for these women to die of CVD during the follow up period 
(although age was controlled in all analyses). Other studies indicate that women never 
experiencing VMS are a small minority,2 although in the present investigation these women 
comprised 38% of the sample, differences that may be due to the specific characteristics of 
the target cohort or the retrospective nature of the symptom reporting, with the recall of 
symptoms over long periods of time vulnerable to memory biases. The present findings of 
increased risk among women never having menopausal symptoms do point to the potential 
value in better understanding characteristics of the women who do not experience this highly 
prevalent symptom. Further, findings were observed for CVD mortality but not non-fatal 
CVD events. The reason for this difference is not clear, but non-fatal CVD events were 
collected over a shorter follow up period than fatal events, with correspondingly smaller 
numbers of these events.
The mechanisms that might underlie associations between early onset symptoms and 
increased mortality risk require elucidation. In the present study, women with earlier onset 
VMS had a higher BMI than their later onset counterparts. This finding is consistent with 
other studies, such as the Penn Ovarian Aging Study or the Study of Women’s Health 
Across the Nation that show a higher BMI with VMS among younger midlife women.3,32 
Thurston et al.

 Women with VMS also had a greater history of hypertension, consistent with other 
reports.8,33 However, BMI, hypertension history, and other key covariates such as race/
ethnicity or history of HT use were all controlled in the present investigation. Reproductive 
hormones did not significantly differ between VMS onset groups and did not explain these 
associations. Other potential pathways such as the autonomic nervous system34 or 
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis35 should be investigated.
Several limitations deserve mention. First, as noted above, our symptom measure asked 
women to recall their symptoms over many years, reports that may be influenced by recall 
biases. The symptom question specified menopausal symptoms more generically, with VMS 
provided as an example. Although VMS are the classic and most prevalent menopausal 
symptom, it is possible that some participants were recalling symptoms other than VMS. 
The sample size was relatively modest, particularly for the women with early onset 
symptoms and for FMD models. The sample was comprised of women with signs and 
symptoms of ischemia sufficient to be referred for coronary angiography and primarily 
white women, and thereby findings may not generalize to other groups.
This study had several strengths. Clinical CVD events, the focus here, are under-studied in 
the VMS-CVD risk literature. The cardiovascular health of the sample was rigorously 
quantified. Evaluating the age at which their symptoms first occurred, a factor rarely 
considered with respect to VMS, is important as aging effects are increasingly understood to 
be important for reproductive factors in relation to women’s cardiovascular health.27,28 
Finally, FMD was assessed, showing parallel results as those for CVD and further 
supporting the validity of study findings.
Conclusions
In conclusion, among women with symptoms and signs of ischemic heart disease referred 
for coronary angiography, early onset VMS (before age 42) had elevated CVD mortality 
compared to women with later onset VMS. These associations were not explained by CVD 
risk factors or by demographic factors. Viewed in concert with findings from other cohorts, 
the present findings emphasize the need for further investigation of the cardiovascular health 
of women experiencing menopausal symptoms early in midlife.
