Abstract
Stress is a potentially remediable risk factor for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). Our 
objective is to determine whether perceived stress predicts incident aMCI and to determine the 
influence of stress on aMCI is independent of known aMCI risk factors, particularly demographic 
variables, depression and apolipoprotein (APOE) genotype. The Einstein Aging Study (EAS) is a 
longitudinal community based study of older adults. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was 
administered annually in the EAS to participants (N=507; 71 developed incident aMCI; mean 
follow-up time = 3.6 years S.D. = 2.0) who were aged ≥ 70 years, free of aMCI and dementia at 
baseline PSS administration and had at least one subsequent annual follow-up. Cox hazard models 
were used to examine time to aMCI onset adjusting for covariates. High levels of perceived stress 
are associated with a 30% greater risk of incident aMCI (per 5 point increase in PSS: HR=1.30; 
95% CI: 1.08–1.58) independent of covariates. The consistency of results after covariate 
adjustment and the lack of evidence for reverse causation in longitudinal analyses suggest that 
these findings are robust. Understanding of the effect of perceived stress on cognition may lead to 
intervention strategies that prevention the onset of aMCI and AD.

 population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) and the pre-dementia states 
which precede it, such as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), are expected to rise.3 
Given the lack of effective disease modifying treatments for AD, there is increasing 
emphasis on early intervention through identification of remediable risk factors and 
development of preventive strategies.4,5 Some studies have linked stress, a potentially 
remediable risk factor, to increased rates of AD6,7, however few have investigated the 
relation of stress to aMCI onset in community based samples.8
Most theories stipulate that chronic or sustained exposure is required for stress to induce 
physiological harmful effects.9,10 Work in animal models have demonstrated that chronic 
stress plays an important role in Alzheimer’s related neuropathology, including hippocampal 
vulnerability11, accumulation12 and sustained elevations in tau phosphorylation.13 This 
implies that stress measures reflecting chronic influences will exhibit stronger relationships 
with cognitive outcomes than measures which reflect the frequency of stressful events which 
may be transient. Therefore, we used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure global life 
stress during a 30 day period. The PSS was an instrument designed to be sensitive to chronic 
stress resulting from ongoing life circumstances, possible future events, as well as events not 
typically listed on event check-lists.14,15 We have shown the PSS to have relatively high 2-
year stability (Intraclass correlation=0.68) in older adults.16 The PSS is a widely used index 
of psychological stress that is robustly associated with a broad range of biological outcomes 
hypothesized to be influenced by chronic stress, such as compromised immune function17 
and dysregulated endocrine function.18 Additionally, the PSS exhibits associations with 
biological markers of aging (e.g., telomere length) that are highly consistent with objective 
markers of chronic stress (e.g., caregiving).19
To understand the association of stress with cognitive decline, the analyses must address the 
potential confounding by depression. Depression is a risk factor known to be related to both 
cognitive decline and AD and to stress.20,21 In addition, carriers of the APOE ε4 allele are at 
increased risk for the onset of aMCI and AD and many studies consider the influence of risk 
factors in the context of APOE genotype.22 Whether APOE status is related to stress and the 
ability to cope has not been fully explored.23,24
The Einstein Aging Study (EAS) provided the opportunity to examine the relation of the 
PSS to development of aMCI. Our goals were to determine: a) whether chronic stress, as 
assessed by the PSS, predicts incident aMCI, and b) whether the influence of PSS on aMCI 
is independent of demographic factors, depressive symptoms and the APOE genotype.
Methods
Overview
This study is based on data from the EAS, a longitudinal study of a community based cohort 
of adults aged 70 years or older who were systematically recruited from Bronx County, NY 
beginning in 1993. Participants undergo annual assessments including clinical evaluations, a 
neuropsychological battery, psychosocial measures, medical histories, demographics, 
standardized assessments of activities of daily living, and self- and informant reports of 
memory and cognitive complaints. Study details are described elsewhere.25 The EAS began

 assessing perceived stress in 2005. The present analyses are based on data from individuals 
free of aMCI or dementia at the initial PSS assessment and who had at least one subsequent 
annual follow-up. Written informed consent was obtained according to a protocol approved 
by the local institutional review board.
Measures for analyses
The PSS has been validated for use in older adults.26 It consists of 14 items, seven 
negatively worded and seven positively worded that tap the extent to which respondents 
appraise their lives over the past month as having been unpredictable, uncontrollable and 
overloaded. Item responses are based on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, ranging from ‘never’ to 
‘very often’.14 Positive items are reverse scored. All items are then summed to produce a 
total PSS score, where higher scores indicate greater perceived stress (range: 0 to 56). The 
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.82 in the EAS sample, consistent with other aging studies.15 The 
initial PSS assessment was used in these analyses. In addition to the continuous score, 
quintiles of the PSS were used to evaluate non-linear (e.g., threshold) effects of stress on 
aMCI risk.
Cognitive status outcomes
aMCI was diagnosed according to updated criteria27 and required objective memory 
impairment, subjective memory impairment indicated by responses to self or informant 
reports (self: CERAD28, informant: CERAD28 or IQ CODE29), absence of functional 
decline (based on the self or informant report, or absence of impairment on any domain 
measured in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton Brody scale30), and 
absence of a dementia diagnosis. Dementia diagnosis was based on standardized clinical 
criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition31, assigned at consensus 
case conferences blinded to PSS data. DSM-5 criteria were not available at the time of data 
collection. aMCI included both multiple and single domain aMCI, therefore, anyone who 
met the memory impairment criterion was defined as aMCI regardless of whether cognitive 
impairments existed in other domains.
Assessment of covariates
Demographics and health status were obtained through self-reports. Activities of daily living 
and information regarding subjective cognitive decline were obtained from self-reports and 
informant questionnaires. Global cognition was measured by the Blessed Information 
Memory Concentration test (BIMC)32 which is comparable to the Mini Mental State 
Examination. The BIMC ranges from 0 to 33, with higher scores indicating more severe 
impairment. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to measure depression 
symptoms.33 GDS scores range from 0 to15, with higher values indicating depressive 
symptoms.
DNA was extracted from whole blood, or was isolated from buffy coat stored at −70° using 
the Puregene DNA Purification System (Gentra System, Minneapolis, Minnesota). 
Amplification and sequencing primers for genotyping of the target APOE SNPs, rs429358 
(position 112) and rs7412 (position 158), were designed using PSQ version 1.0.6 software 
(Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden); in each case the reverse primer was biotinylated. Genotyping

 was performed using a Pyrosequencing PSQ HS 96A system (http://
www.pyrosequencing.com). Individuals were classified as APOE ε4 carriers if they had at 
least one ε4 allele.
Statistical Methods
For our primary analyses, we assessed PSS as a continuous variable. The assumption of 
linearity was confirmed by modeling the log hazard ratio for incident aMCI as a function of 
PSS score using the Pspline method.34 Because prior research suggests that measures 
associated with perceived stress, such as neuroticism, show a non-linear relationship to the 
onset of cognitive events7, we performed secondary analyses examining the hazard ratios for 
aMCI for the lowest quintile of PSS compared to each of the other quintiles. In comparison 
with the first quintile, results were marginally significant or not significant for quintiles 2 to 
4 and highly significant for quintile 5 (Supplementary Table s1). We therefore defined high 
stress as the top quintile and low stress as the remaining 4 quintiles for our secondary 
analyses.
The Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical 
variables were used for descriptive analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were applied 
to examine the effect of PSS on incident aMCI adjusting for gender, race, education and age. 
Additional models adjusting for depression and APOE ε4 status were included. A Kaplan 
Meier survival curve for aMCI is presented by severity of perceived stress. The proportional 
hazards assumptions were adequately met according to methods based on scaled Schoenfeld 
residuals.35
Results
PSS was completed by 507 participants who were free of both aMCI and dementia at the 
time of assessment, and completed at least one subsequent annual follow-up. Table 1 shows 
descriptive characteristics at baseline PSS stratified by high and low stress level. Average 
follow-up time was 3.6 years (S.D. 2.0; range 0.93 - 7.3 years). The highest stress group was 
more likely to be female (76% vs. 61%), had less education, and higher levels of depression. 
There was no significant difference in global cognition (BIMC), by level of stress.
Of the 507 individuals initially free of aMCI, 71 developed incident aMCI. Table 2 presents 
a series of nested Cox proportional hazard models for the association of continuous PSS to 
incident aMCI. Model 1 is adjusted for demographics. Model 2 added depression to Model 1 
and Model 3 added APOE ε4 status. In all three models, PSS has a statistically significant 
hazard ratio while demographic factors and GDS were not significant with the exception of 
age. APOE ε4 status strengthened the PSS hazard ratio in the final model. For every 5 point 
increase in PSS, risk of aMCI increased by 30% in the fully adjusted model (p-value = .007).
Findings were similar when PSS was examined categorically (Table 3). The Kaplan Meier 
curve comparing the risk of aMCI for those in the top quintile of PSS and all others is shown 
in Figure 1. In Model 1, adjusting for demographics, those in the highest quintile of PSS had 
more than double the risk of developing aMCI compared to all others (HR=2.00, p=0.001). 
Adjustment for GDS score slightly attenuated the magnitude of the HR for PSS (Model 2).

 In Model 3, further adjustment for APOE ε4 status strengthened the relationship of PSS 
(HR=2.44, p=0.005) to incidence of aMCI. Those with the highest level of PSS are almost 
2.5 times more likely to develop aMCI based on the fully adjusted model.
Discussion
High levels of perceived chronic stress are associated with increased risk of incident aMCI 
in this community based sample of older adults. Results suggest that the effects of PSS on 
aMCI onset are independent of demographic features, depression and APOE ε4 allele status. 
The magnitude of the hazard ratios, the consistency of results after adjusting for multiple 
covariates and the stability of results when perceived stress is modeled as either a categorical 
or continuous variable suggests that these findings are robust. There have been few 
longitudinal, community-based studies that have focused on perceived stress as a risk factor 
for incident aMCI or dementia. None have examined perceived stress in relation to the 
incidence of aMCI. Since aMCI is often viewed as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s 
dementia and perceived stress is a remediable risk factor, a better understanding of this 
relationship could lead to preventive interventions.4,5
Measures of stress and progression to aMCI and dementia
Several studies7, 23,36,37 found that that stressful life events, and measures of psychological 
distress and biological markers of stress, including cortisol dysregulation, are associated 
with an increased risk of cognitive decline. In the Chicago Health and Aging Project 
(CHAP) cognitive decline was associated with levels of perceived stress though aMCI was 
not reported.36 In an earlier study from the same cohort, proneness to distress as measured 
by the neuroticism scale of the NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory was linked to 
cognitive decline over approximately a five year period.37 In the Cache County Memory 
Study, those with fewer years of education and greater numbers of stressful events had more 
rapid cognitive decline.23 These studies have long follow-up periods but do not examine the 
influence of stress/distress on the presumably long period preceding clinically diagnosed 
aMCI or dementia. The design of clinically relevant interventions requires an understanding 
of the influence of risk factors on the onset of cognitive states such as aMCI or dementia.
Peavy and colleagues38 examined the influence of chronic stress on the transition from 
cognitively normal to MCI and from MCI to dementia. Chronic stress was measured in two 
ways: saliva cortisol was used to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis and the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) was used to measure life 
events. Despite the modest sample size (n=62), cortisol levels were associated with 
progression to MCI but not from MCI to dementia. Conversely, stressful life events were 
related to transition from MCI to dementia and not from cognitive normality to MCI. This 
study implies different mechanisms may be operative at different stages of the AD process.
Perceived Stress as a Measure of Stress
Much research examining the link between stress and cognitive health has operationalized 
stress by measuring significant life events. Cumulative exposure to major stressful events 
and circumstances has been associated with an increased risk of dementia onset in some

 studies6,39 but not in others.40,41 The inconsistency in results may be due, in part, to the 
limitations of life event measures. Life event stress measures, which take into account 
frequency of positive and negative life events are influenced by the degree of social 
engagement; those with narrow networks may have fewer stressors than more engaged peers. 
Yet the engagement that increases exposure may itself buffer the influence of stress and the 
lack of engagement may be a stressor in its own right. Frequency counts of discrete life 
events, even major events, do not reflect the extent to which an individual experiences 
chronic or prolonged states of stress. In contrast, measures of global subjective stress, like 
the PSS, may be a more robust predictor of cognitive health outcomes since it was designed 
to be sensitive to chronic stress resulting from ongoing life circumstances, possible future 
events, as well as from events not listed on a specific event checklist. This view is consistent 
with stress theories42 which postulate that an individual’s level of appraised stress is a 
stronger determinant of health outcomes than objective occurrence of events.
Mechanistic Pathways
Effect of stress on cognition may be mediated through multiple physiological pathways 
involving the central nervous, neuroendocrine, immune and cardiovascular systems. 
Neuroendocrine effects are thought to be primarily mediated through the activation of the 
HPA axis, marked by increased levels of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids. These neuroendocrine changes 
lead to alteration of brain structure and function in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, 
among other brain regions.43 Furthermore, studies in animal models of AD have suggested 
that stress and increased glucocorticoids, may lead to increased levels of β-amyloid and 
phosphorylated tau, the pathologic hallmarks of AD.44 It is possible that a similar 
mechanism in humans, cause more rapid development of AD pathology with incident aMCI 
as its clinical correlate.45 Stress is also associated with increased production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in the brain, which play a critical role in predisposing humans to 
anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.46 In addition, stress might affect memory and 
cognition indirectly and through increased incidence of cardiovascular disease47 or 
psychopathologies.
Influence of Covariates: Depression and APOE ε4 Allele Status
We evaluated the influence of depression, a potential confounder, on the relationship of 
stress to aMCI onset and found no significant relationship, similar to Wilson et al 2007.8 
Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele are at increased risk for the onset of aMCI and AD, therefore, 
many studies consider the influence of risk factors in the context of this genotype. APOE 
may also influence stress and the ability to cope. There is a paucity of data examining the 
interaction of genetic and environmental factors relating to stress.23,24 Our results show that 
the impact of stress on cognitive status is independent of the effects of APOE. Further 
understanding the effects of stress during the preclinical phase of aMCI may lead to 
innovative prevention and treatment efforts.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study shows that higher stress as measured by the PSS is associated with an increased 
risk of incident aMCI. This study has several strengths. The EAS is a longitudinal study of a

 systematically recruited, racially/ethically and educationally diverse community-based 
elderly cohort. This large cohort is representative of older adults in our Bronx community. In 
contrast with clinic-based samples, our participants are not selected based on medical care 
seeking. Our results establish a prospective association between high levels of subjective 
chronic stress and increased risk for aMCI, which suggests that psychological stress may be 
a viable target for preventive interventions designed to promote cognitive health and delay 
impairment among older adults.
A potential limitation of this study is that stress may increase in response to incipient 
cognitive impairment rather than serving as a risk factor for it. However, it is unlikely that 
reverse causality explains the observed observations for several reasons. First, PSS was 
assessed at baseline in persons demonstrated not to have aMCI or dementia. Second, under 
the reverse causality hypothesis, we predicted that the association of PSS score to aMCI 
onset would be greatest for times closest to the PSS assessment. Using stratified analysis, we 
assessed the HR for aMCI within 3 years and after 3 years from the baseline PSS assessment 
(median length of follow-up: Supplementary Tables s2a. and s2b). PSS does not predict 
incident aMCI within 3 years, but does so for aMCI onset after 3 years of follow-up (< 3 
years: HR=1.64, CI= 0.78, 3.43; >= 3 years: HR=3.61, CI=1.64, 7.95). This result is the 
opposite of the prediction that would be made under a reverse causality hypothesis. Third, 
this hypothesis predicts that PSS scores should increase during the time prior to the onset of 
aMCI. We examined the change in PSS over time and found that overall change in linear 
slope for PSS score was not significantly different from zero and that the PSS slopes among 
those who developed aMCI and those who did not were not significantly different from 
each. In addition, a paired t-test was performed for those with incident aMCI. There was no 
significant difference between baseline PSS and scores at the time of incident aMCI, 
indicating no change in PSS.
A second limitation of our results pertains to our use of the PSS to operationalize chronic 
stress. Although it is likely that the predictive power of the PSS derives from its sensitivity 
to chronic sources of stress, the PSS is a global index that cannot distinguish among other 
stress effects such as specific major life events in the elderly (e.g., residential transitions), 
appraisal processes, role stressors (e.g., caregiving), heightened stressor reactivity, and 
dispositional traits (e.g., tendencies toward worry or rumination). Future research is needed 
to isolate the specific psychological and biological elements of the stress process that drive 
the relationship between PSS and cognitive impairment to better understand the underlying 
mechanistic pathways and inform intervention strategies.
Our study of community residing older adults demonstrates that perceived stress is an 
independent predictor of aMCI, the preclinical stage of AD. As a modifiable risk factor, 
perceived stress should be considered to be targeted in preventive interventions including 
mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive–behavioral therapies, and pharmacologic 
interventions that aim to reduce cognitive decline. Perceived stress can be easily measured 
using self-report instruments which can be easily implemented in a clinical setting.
