Summary
Background The population effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) catch-up vaccination, defined in the USA 
as first vaccination at ages 13–26 years, has not been studied extensively. We aimed to assess the risk of cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer (CIN2+ and CIN3+) by prior HPV 
vaccination status, age at first dose, and number of doses in women participating in a screening programme within a 
large integrated health-care system.
Methods We performed a nested case-control study of women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (an 
integrated health-care delivery system in California, USA). Cases were women with CIN2+ or CIN3+ confirmed by 
histology between Jan 1, 1995, and June 30, 2014, and incidence density-selected controls were age-matched women 
without CIN2+ or CIN3+ at the time each case occurred. For each case, we randomly selected five controls. Cases and 
controls were aged 26 years or younger when the HPV quadrivalent vaccine became available in 2006. Rate ratios 
(RRs) from conditional logistic regression were estimated by age at time of first HPV quadrivalent vaccine dose 
(14–17 years, 18–20 years, and ≥21 years), and number of doses (one, two, and three or more doses) compared with no 
prior vaccination, with adjustment for smoking, hormonal contraceptive prescription, race or ethnicity, sexually 
transmitted infections, immunosuppression, parity, and number of outpatient visits.
Findings 4357 incident CIN2+ cases and 21 773 matched controls were included in the study. Of these, 1849 were incident 
CIN3+ cases with 9242 matched controls. The youngest age at time of first vaccination was 14 years. One or more 
HPV vaccine doses conferred protection against CIN2+ (RR 0·82, 95% CI 0·73–0·93) and CIN3+ (0·77, 0·64–0·94). 
We found the strongest protection against CIN2+ in women who had received at least three vaccine doses and had 
received their first dose aged 14–17 years (0·52, 0·36–0·74) or aged 18–20 years (0·65, 0·49–0·88). No significant 
protection was found in women aged 21 years or older at time of first dose (0·94, 0·81–1·09). Inferences were similar 
for CIN3+, but with stronger effects for women who received at least three vaccine doses and had received their first 
dose aged 14–17 years (0·27, 0·13–0·56) or aged 18–20 years (0·59, 0·36–0·97).
Interpretation Catch-up quadrivalent HPV vaccination with three doses was effective against CIN2+ and CIN3+ in 
girls and women aged 14–20 years at time of first vaccine dose but not for women aged 21 years and older at first dose.

Introduction
In the USA, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
is recommended for girls aged 11–12 years, with 
catch-up vaccination for girls and women aged 
13–26 years. Although originally approved as a 
three-dose series, recommendations from the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016 
allow for a two-dose series for girls who initiate the 
vaccine series aged 9–14 years.1 The potential protection 
against cervical neoplasia afforded by the available 
HPV vaccines is substantial, but the actual vaccine 
effect has yet to be fully observed because girls 
vaccinated in early adolescence have only recently 
reached the recommended age for cervical cancer 
screening. However, vaccine effectiveness can be 
evaluated in girls and women who initiated the vaccine 
series at older ages.
Evidence 
suggests 
vaccination 
has 
population 
effectiveness, which includes reduced prevalence of 
abnor 
mal cervical cytology or HPV vaccine-type specific 
infections.2–9 Data from a randomised clinical trial10 of 
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in India suggested that 
catch-up vaccination with fewer than three doses was 
both immuno 
genic and protective against HPV. 
Evidence in support of a vaccine effect on high-grade 
precancerous lesions, including cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) grades 2, 2/3, 3, adenocarcinoma in 
situ, or cancer (CIN2+ or CIN3+), is limited and 
consists mainly of study findings showing ecological 
decreases in CIN2+ incidence over time,11–18 with most

data showing no change for older women.11,13,14,16,17 In 
randomised clinical trials the quad 
rivalent HPV vaccine 
has been found to decrease the risk of CIN2+ in women 
who initiated vaccination aged 15–26 years,19 but in 
another trial20 with women initiating vaccination aged 
24–45 years, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine had no 
effect on CIN2+ incidence. Vaccine effectiveness 
against CIN2+ was shown in studies in Australia and 
Scotland,21–24 where vaccin 
 
 
ation coverage in school 
programmes reached 70–90%, although few studies23,24 
included women who initiated vaccination aged 17 years 
or older.
In this study, we aimed to estimate the effectiveness of 
catch-up quadrivalent HPV vaccination to prevent CIN2+ 
and CIN3+, by age at first dose and by number of doses.
Methods
Study design and data source
This nested case-control study included women enrolled 
in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a 
large integrated health-care system in California, USA, 
providing comprehensive care for more than 3·9 million 
members in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, which 
represent 28% of insured Californians in the same 
region.25 The institutional review board at KPNC 
approved this study with a waiver of written informed 
consent.
The study population was a subset of participants in a 
previous nested case-control study26 in which cases were 
women with a new diagnosis of CIN2+ or CIN3+ and 
incidence density-selected controls were women without 
CIN2+ or CIN3+ at the time each case occurred. The 
source population for the parent case-control study26 
included more than 2 million women who had cytology 
between Jan 1, 1995, and June 30, 2014. We focused on 
women targeted for screening by excluding girls younger 
than 18 years, women older than 70 years, and all women 
with prior hysterectomy. For each case, we randomly 
selected five controls who met these same eligibility 
criteria and matched them by age (within 1 year), time 
since first cytology in the health system (within 1 year), 
and years of continuous prior health plan membership 
(within 1 year). The 5:1 sampling scheme provided 
adequate power for rare exposures, as described 
previously.26 The index date for cases was the diagnosis 
date, and controls were assigned the same index date as 
the case to which they were matched. Cases and controls 
were also required to have a cytology test within 
12 months before their assigned index date. The study 
was limited to women eligible for the HPV vaccine since 
its introduction in 2006, and who were old enough to 
participate in the cervical cancer screening programme, 
corresponding to women aged 18–26 years between 2006 
and 2014.
Although a cohort study design was a viable alternative 
approach, we used the nested case-control design to 
enhance computational efficiency because a cohort study 
would have involved a multivariable analysis of more than 
2 million women and relies on covariate adjustment, 
instead of precise matching of risk factors between cases 
and controls.
Electronic medical records were used as the primary 
data source, including vaccination data. Histopathology 
results of cervical biopsies were ascertained by 
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine topology and 
morphology codes. Text-based natural language pro-
cessing of the corresponding pathology reports was used 
to more accurately assign the diagnosis (eg, CIN2, CIN3). 
KPNC has offered the quadrivalent HPV vaccine since 
2006; the nonavalent HPV vaccine was introduced in 
August, 2015, after the end of the study period. Other 
clinical risk factors ascertained included recent (within 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In the USA, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is 
recommended for girls aged 11–12 years, with catch-up 
vaccination for girls and women aged 13–26 years who have not 
started the vaccine series. We searched PubMed, without 
language restrictions, for studies of cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer 
(CIN2+ and CIN3+) in HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women 
with a combination of the terms “papillomavirus vaccine”, 
“papillomavirus vaccination”, “HPV vaccine”, “HPV vaccination”, 
“effectiveness”, “papillomavirus infection”, “cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia”, “cervical dysplasia”, “cervical neoplasm”, “HPV related 
diseases”, “histology”, “biopsy”, and “colposcopy”. The search was 
limited to articles published before March 21, 2018. We found 
few epidemiological studies in which the effectiveness of HPV 
vaccination in reducing the risk of CIN2+ or CIN3+ had been 
assessed, especially in girls and women vaccinated at older ages. 
Added value of this study
In a large sample of women with uniform access to 
comprehensive care and who were engaged in a robust cervical 
cancer screening programme, we found that catch-up HPV 
vaccination with three doses was effective against CIN2+ and 
CIN3+ in women aged 14–20 years at time of first dose. 
However, we found no significant effectiveness in women who 
initiated vaccination aged 21–26 years or in women who 
received fewer than the full three doses.
Implications of all the available evidence
These results support existing guidelines recommending the 
full three-dose HPV vaccination series for girls and women who 
start the series after their 15th birthday. Additional research is 
needed to confirm the limited effectiveness of catch-up 
vaccination for women aged 21–26 years.

18 months) history of smoking and high parity (defined as 
three or more livebirths). We also identified factors 
potentially associated with increased screening frequency, 
including number of recent outpatient visits (within the 
previous 18 months) and race or ethnicity. Finally, factors 
(within the previous 18 months) that were both clinical 
risk factors and associated with screening frequency 
included documented sexually transmitted infections 
(herpes, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and chlamydia), prescription 
of hormonal contra 
ceptives, and immunosuppression 
(HIV infection, previous solid organ transplantation, and 
pre 
scription of immunosuppressive medication), defined 
in detail previously.26
Statistical analysis
HPV vaccination history before the index date was 
obtained for all women. We only ascertained vaccine 
doses received at least 6 months before index because 
more proximal vaccine doses are not likely to have an 
effect on disease risk. The following comparisons by 
vaccination status were made: first, prior HPV 
vaccination (ie, at least one HPV vaccine doses) versus 
no prior HPV vaccination; second, age at first dose 
(14–17 years, 18–20 years, and ≥21 years) versus no prior 
HPV vaccination; third, number of doses received 
(one, two, and three or more doses) versus no prior HPV 
vaccination; and fourth, various combinations of age at 
first dose and number of doses received, including 
six categories for three age strata (ie, 14–17 years, 
18–20 years, and ≥21 years) and two dose strata (ie, at least 
three doses and fewer than three doses), each compared 
with women with no prior HPV vaccination. Conditional 
logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, 
which represent unbiased estimates of rate ratios (RRs) 
in a nested case-control study with incidence density 
sampling.27
Adjusted models included covariates representing 
recent smoking (yes or no), recent hormonal contra-
ceptive use (yes or no), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other, unknown), 
recent sexually transmitted infections (yes or no), three 
or more livebirths (yes or no), prior outpatient visits 
(continuous), and immunosuppression status (yes or 
no). For the model including the combined variable of 
age at first dose and number of doses, a custom contrast 
tested the interaction of whether the effects of age at first 
dose (14–17 years, 18–20 years, and ≥21 years, each 
compared with no prior HPV vaccination) significantly 
differed by number of doses (fewer than three doses 
vs three or more doses).
We performed several sensitivity analyses: first, we 
limited to cases and controls with continuous health plan 
member 
ship since 2006, to minimise misclassification 
of HPV vaccine history. In the second analysis, we 
excluded controls with abnormal cytology from recent 
cytology to minimise misclassification of outcome status 
(ie, mis 
classification might have occurred if controls with 
abnormal cytology had not yet been followed up with 
colposcopy to identify CIN2+). Finally, we replaced all 
versions of covariates categorised as recent with versions 
categorised as ever (ie, any time in the past as a proxy for 
lifetime exposure) to minimise potential for residual 
confounding.
We used the LOGISTIC procedure in SAS, version 9.3, 
for all statistical analyses.

Results
The study population included 4357 CIN2+ cases 
and 21 773 matched controls, including a subset of 
1849 CIN3+ cases with 9242 matched controls. 4348 of 
4357 CIN2+ cases had five matched women in the 
control group, eight women in the case group had four 
matched women in the control group, and one woman 
in the case group had one matched woman in the control 
group. 1599 women in the control group matched to 
more than one woman in the case group, and 211 women 
in the control group became cases at a later date. Cases 
and controls were similar with respect to matching 
parameters of age, index year, and mean number of 
years with health plan membership (table 1). Compared 
with controls, cases (both CIN2+ and CIN3+) were more 
likely to be non-Hispanic white, had a higher mean 
number of outpatient visits per year, and were more 
likely to have a history of smoking, recent hormonal 
contraceptive use, and recent sexually transmitted 
infections. Of 4357 CIN2+ cases, 874 (20%) were CIN2, 
1634 (38%) were CIN2/3, 1744 (40%) were CIN3, 82 (2%) 
were adenocarcinoma in situ, and 23 (<1%) were cancer 
(nine adenocarcinoma, 13 squamous cell carcinoma, 
and one other cancer).
429 (10%) of 4357 CIN2+ cases and 2408 (11%) of 
21 773 controls had any prior HPV vaccination (table 2). 
Women aged 14–17 years and 18–20 years at time of first 
vaccination had protection against CIN2+ compared 
with women with no prior vaccination, whereas women 
aged 21 years or older at time of first vaccination were 
not protected (table 2). Receipt of at least three HPV 
vaccine was associated with CIN2+ protection, whereas 
receipt of one or two doses was not. For analyses that 
considered the combined association of age at first dose 
and number of doses, CIN2+ protection was only seen 
in women with at least three HPV vaccine doses and 
who were aged 14–17 years or 18–20 years at time of first 
dose (table 2).
After adjustment for covariates, women with at least 
one HPV vaccine dose were at an overall decreased risk 
for CIN2+ compared with women with no prior 
vaccination (figure 1). A significantly reduced CIN2+ 
risk was also found for women who received their first 
HPV vaccine dose at ages 14–17 years and 18–20 years, 
but not in women who received their first HPV vaccine 
dose aged 21 years or older. A significantly reduced 
CIN2+ risk was found for women who received at least 
three HPV vaccine doses but not in women who received 
one or two doses. In adjusted models that considered the 
combined association of age at first dose and number of 
doses, we only found protection against CIN2+ in 
women who received at least three HPV vaccine doses 
and were aged either 14–17 years or 18–20 years at time 
of first dose, compared with no prior vaccination 
(figure 1). No statistically significant protection against 
CIN2+ was found in women who received fewer than 
three vaccine doses, although point estimates were 
CIN2+ cases

protective for those aged 14–17 years and 18–20 years at 
time of first dose. Finally, although the associations of 
age at first dose with CIN2+ appeared stronger for 
women who received at least three HPV vaccine doses, 
the test for interaction between age at first dose and 
number of doses in vaccinated women was not 
statistically significant (p=0·41).
154 (8%) of 1849 CIN3+ cases and 893 (10%) of 
9242 controls had prior HPV vaccination (table 3). 
Receipt of a first dose when aged 14–17 years conferred 
protection against CIN3+ compared with no prior 
vaccination, whereas women who received their 
first dose aged 18–20 years or 21 years or older had no 
protection. Receipt of at least three HPV vaccine doses 
was associated with CIN3+ protection, whereas receipt 
of one or two doses was not. For analyses that considered 
the combined association of age at first dose and 
number of doses, CIN3+ protection was only found for 
women who received at least three HPV vaccine doses 
and received their first dose aged 14–17 years. Of the 
23 CIN3+ cases with cancers, only three had prior HPV 
vaccination; all three women had received at least 
three doses, and all were 21 years or older at time of 
first dose.
After adjustment for covariates, women with at least 
one HPV vaccine dose were at an overall decreased risk 
for CIN3+ compared with women with no prior 
vaccination (figure 2). Protection against CIN3+ was also 
found in women who received their first HPV vaccine 
dose aged 14–17 years but not in women who received 
their first dose aged 18–20 years or 21 years or older. 
Significant protection against CIN3+ was found in 
women with at least three HPV vaccine doses but not in 
women who received one or two doses. In adjusted 
models that considered the combined association of age 
at first dose and number of doses, we found protection 
against CIN3+ in women with at least three HPV vaccine 
doses and who received their first dose aged 14–17 years 
and, by contrast with unadjusted results, in women with 
at least three HPV vaccine doses and who received their 
first dose aged 18–20 years (figure 2). No statistically 
significant protection against CIN3+ was found within 
any of the age strata for women who received fewer than 
three vaccine doses, although point estimates were 
protective for those aged 14–17 years at time of first dose. 
Finally, although the associations of age at first dose with 
CIN3+ appeared stronger for women with at least 
three HPV vaccine doses, the test for interaction between 
age at first dose and number of doses in vaccinated 
women was not statistically significant (p=0·13).
Sensitivity analyses limiting to cases and controls with 
continuous health plan membership since 2006 did not 
change inferences for association with at least one HPV 
vaccine dose, although the association strengthened 
for CIN2+ (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·59–0·81) and CIN3+ 
(0·70, 0·54–0·90). Other sensitivity analyses had 
negligible changes in inferences (data not shown).

Discussion
In this large population-based case-control study in an 
integrated health-care system, catch-up HPV vaccination 
with three doses was effective against CIN2+ and CIN3+ 
in women younger than 21 years at time of first dose. We 
found no significant effectiveness, however, in women 
who initiated vaccination aged 21–26 years or in women 
who received fewer than the full three doses in the series. 
These results support existing guidelines recommending 
the full three-dose series for girls and women who start 
the series after their 15th birthday. The finding that catch-
up vaccination had limited effectiveness in women aged 
21–26 years should be confirmed in other settings.
The 18% reduction (1·00 – 0·82 RR)  in CIN2+ incidence 
in women who received at least one dose of the vaccine is 
similar to findings from randomised clinical trials of the 
quadrivalent vaccine19 showing a 19% reduction in the 
intention-to-treat analysis for CIN2+ in girls and women 
aged 15–26 years who received at least one vaccine dose. In 
a trial20 with women aged 24–45 years who were randomised 
to the quadrivalent vaccine or placebo, the quadrivalent 
vaccine had 89% efficacy against the combined outcome of 
persistent infection, CIN, and external genital lesions 
related to HPV vaccine types; although not powered 
for CIN2+, the trial investigators also noted no decrease in 
CIN2+ incidence. The 23% reduction we noted in CIN3+ 
incidence is similar to the 18% reduction for CIN3 or 
adenocarcinoma in situ reported in these trials.
Few epidemiological studies have been done to evalu 
ate 
the 
population 
effectiveness 
of 
HPV 
vaccination 
for CIN2+.21–24,28 The effectiveness of the bivalent HPV 
vaccine was assessed in a large study in Scotland,22 where 
vaccination of girls aged 13–17 years with three doses was 
associated with a 50% reduction in CIN2 incidence and a 
55% reduction in CIN3 incidence compared with girls who 
were not vaccinated; these effects attenuated with 
increasing age. In an Australian study with girls aged 
12–17 years (mean age 16 years),21 vaccination with at least 
one dose was associated with a 28% reduction in CIN2+ 
and 36% reduction in CIN3 or adenocarcinoma in situ 
incidence, which is stronger in magnitude than our 
findings, whereas girls vaccinated at older ages had reduced 
protection. Protection was only found in girls who were 
fully vaccinated. In a follow-up Australian case-control 
study23 with girls and women aged 11–27 years at first dose 
who were just entering the cervical cancer screening pro-
gramme, effectiveness against CIN2+ was 46% with three 
vaccine doses and 21% with two doses. CIN3+ was not 
evaluated. The investigators also reported 26% effectiveness 
for at least one vaccine dose compared with those receiving 
no vaccine, but no evidence was found of any vaccine 
effectiveness in women aged 23–27 years. Vaccine 
effectiveness for CIN2+ (but again not for CIN3+) by age 
and number of doses was compared before and after 
cervical cancer screening initiation in another Australian 
study with girls and women aged 11–27 years.24 Vaccination 
was associated with a 29% effectiveness against CIN2+ for 
girls and women fully vaccinated before screening initiation 
and a 13% effectiveness for girls and women fully 
vaccinated after screening initiation, but those receiving 
fewer than three doses had no protection. Results were 
similar for the outcome of CIN3/adenomacarcinoma in 
situ. Effectiveness was reduced but remained significant 
for women aged 20–23 years and 24–26 years but only for 
those who were vaccinated after screening initiation.
The study has several key strengths. First, we are among 
the first to evaluate vaccine effectiveness in a large sample 
in the USA where HPV vaccine uptake has been lower 
than in other countries. This study is one of few to evaluate 
effectiveness in women vaccinated after age 17 years and is 
one of the largest to do so; compared with a study in 
Australia,23 our study had four times the number of cases 
overall (n=4357 vs n=1062), enhancing our ability to detect 
small differences between cases and controls. In the 
randomised trial20 in which vaccine efficacy was assessed 
in women initiating vaccination at ages 24–45 years, only 
62 CIN2+ cases were identified in the vaccinated group 
and 51 CIN2+ cases were identified in the placebo group. 
We also adjusted for clinical risk factors such as smoking, 
hormonal contraceptive use, and sexually transmitted 
infections, which was not done in previous studies.21–24 An 
additional strength was the comprehensive database 
allowing for complete ascertainment of clinical data and 
the ability to precisely match controls on factors associated 
with engagement with the health-care system.
Some study limitations should be acknowledged. First, 
clinically ascertained study measurements such as smoking 
might have been subject to misclassification. Other 
measurements based on pharmacy or laboratory data 
(ie, hormonal contraceptive use, sexually transmitted 
infections) were more accurately ascer 
tained. Replacing 
recent exposure to covariates with ever exposure (with 
potentially more complete data) in the sensitivity analyses 
had no effect on results. Second, results of the sensitivity 
analysis was limited to women with continuous 
membership since the introduction of the vaccine showed 
moderately stronger results, suggesting there might have 
been some misclassification of vaccination status. Third, 
residual confounding related to screening vigilance might 
have affected the results. Cases and controls, however, were 
carefully matched to reflect similar engagement in the 
health plan. Fourth, although the case-control design 
offered advantages with respect to analytical efficiency and 
careful adjustment for confounders, the design precluded 
the calculation of absolute rates. Fifth, the increased HPV 
type vaccine coverage of the recently introduced nonavalent 
HPV vaccine is anticipated to prevent more CIN2+ cases 
than the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is, thus requiring future 
investigation. Sixth, despite the large sample size, the low 
uptake of catch-up vaccination resulted in limited statistical 
power and wide CIs for some comparisons (eg, fewer than 
three doses). Seventh, given the observational design, 
vaccinated and unvaccinated women might have differed 
in ways that we could not fully measure. Finally, the results

might have limited generalisability given the single health-
care setting. However, the results are generalisable to other 
integrat 
ed health-care settings and insured women in the 
San Francisco Bay Area, given the current membership of 
more than 2 million members, representing a quarter of all 
insured women in the region.25
In summary, our findings support existing US guidelines 
recommending three HPV vaccine doses for girls and 
women initiating vaccination at ages 15–20 years. 
Consistent with some,20,23 but not all studies,24 our findings 
do not support catch-up vaccination of women aged 
21–26 years. Because this finding conflicts with recent calls 
to extend HPV vaccination to women of older ages,29 our 
results should be confirmed in other settings, especially 
those that have adopted the  nonavalent HPV vaccine.
