ABSTRACT
Objective: Dietary supplementation with fermentable carbohydrate protects against body weight gain. Fermentation by the resident gut
microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids, which act at free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2). Our aim was to test the hypothesis that FFAR2 is
important in regulating the beneficial effects of fermentable carbohydrate on body weight and to understand the role of gut hormones PYY and
GLP-1.
Methods: Wild-type or Ffar2�/� mice were fed an inulin supplemented or control diet. Mice were metabolically characterized and gut hormone
concentrations, enteroendocrine cell density measurements were carried out. Intestinal organoids and colonic cultures were utilized to sub-
stantiate the in vivo findings.
Results: We provide new mechanistic insight into how fermentable carbohydrate regulates metabolism. Using mice that lack FFAR2, we
demonstrate that the fermentable carbohydrate inulin acts via this receptor to drive an 87% increase in the density of cells that produce the
appetite-suppressing hormone peptide YY (PYY), reduce food intake, and prevent diet-induced obesity.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that FFAR2 is predominantly involved in regulating the effects of fermentable carbohydrate on metabolism
and does so, in part, by enhancing PYY cell density and release. This highlights the potential for targeting enteroendocrine cell differentiation to
treat obesity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Obesity is currently one of the most serious global threats to human
health and an important modifiable risk factor for type-2 diabetes,
hypertension, and certain cancers [1e3]. Susceptibility to obesity is
determined by genetic background, diet, and lifestyle. Additionally,
over the past decade, it has become apparent that the resident in-
testinal microbiota also plays an important role in determining sus-
ceptibility to obesity [4e7]. This is partly due to the production of
physiologically active metabolites during the process of microbial
fermentation, which serve to harvest energy from dietary substrates
that would otherwise be lost in the feces [8,9]. This is typified by the
fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, which, when supple-
mented into the diet, reduce appetite and body weight gain and
improve glucose homeostasis in rodents and humans [10e12]. Key
metabolites involved in transducing these beneficial metabolic effects
are the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate and buty-
rate [8]. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that the increased pro-
duction of propionate following gastric bypass surgery for obesity is
related to weight loss [13].

 While SCFAs can be utilized for de novo synthesis of lipids and glucose
[14] and serve as an energy source, they also act as signaling mol-
ecules at the recently de-orphaned G-protein coupled receptors, free
fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2, also known as GPR43) and FFAR3 (also
known as GPR41) [15,16]. Both receptors are expressed in various
peripheral tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, bone
marrow, spleen, thymus, lung, breast, and white adipose tissue;
therefore, SCFAs may have widespread effects [15,17e20].
Within the gastrointestinal tract, FFAR2 and 3 have been localized to
enteroendocrine L cells [17]. These specialized gut cells secrete the
anorectic hormone peptide YY (PYY) and the incretin glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) in response to luminal nutrients, such as sugars,
amino acids, and long-chain fatty acids [17,21,22]. The highest
density of L cells is found in the colon where these nutrients are
unlikely to reach significant concentrations, but where SCFAs are
most concentrated [23]. This suggests that gut hormone release may
be an important host response to microbial fermentation and the
consequent production of SCFAs. In support of this, acetate and
propionate have been shown to stimulate the secretion of GLP-1
in vitro, an effect which was attenuated by FFAR2 deletion [24].
We therefore hypothesize that SCFA activation of L cell-expressed
FFAR2, contributes to the effects of microbial fermentation on host
metabolism.
To determine if the beneficial metabolic effects of fermentable car-
bohydrate are mediated by FFAR2 signaling, we used mice with tar-
geted deletion of this receptor. We demonstrate for the first time that
this receptor is essential for mediating inulin’s ability to reduce food
intake and protect against diet-induced obesity. FFAR2 signaling was
found to drive an expansion of the PYY cell population within the colon,
leading to increased circulating PYY, thus potentiating anorectic
signaling by the gut. Our findings suggest that the fermentable car-
bohydrate stimulated expansion of PYY-expressing cells within the
proximal colon is a physiologically important pathway linking diet, gut
microbiota, and host metabolism.
2. METHODS AND MATERIALS
2.1. Study approval
All animal procedures were approved by the local ethical review pro-
cess and the British Home Office Animals Scientific Procedures Act
1986 and carried out at Imperial College London (project license
numbers: 70/7096, 70/7236 and 70/7595) or the Garvan Institute of
Medical Research (12_22).
2.2. Animals and diets
Male Ffar2�/� C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Deltagen (http://
wwww.deltagen.com). The Ffar2 gene was deleted by homologous
recombination, which substitutes 55 bp of Ffar2 exon 1 with the b-
gal-neo cassette, shifting the downstream amino acid sequence out
of the reading frame [25]. Mice were maintained in cages under
controlled temperature (21e23 �C) and light (12 h light/12 h dark)
with ad libitum access to food and water. Ffar2�/� and WT litter-
mates at 9 weeks of age were fed a high-fat “Western” diet con-
taining 21% anhydrous milk-fat and 34% sucrose, supplemented
with 7.5% inulin (HFI) or an isocaloric control diet supplemented with
3.3% cellulose þ 4.2% corn starch (HFC) for 14 or 2 weeks. For
analysis of proliferation, Bromodeoxyuridine (2.6 mM) was adminis-
tered in the drinking water for the second week of the 2-week
intervention. Investigators were blinded to the sample group alloca-
tion during the experiment and analysis.
2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging
Adiposity was quantified by MRI following 13 weeks dietary inter-
vention. Mice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane in oxygen at a
flow-rate of 2 L/min and scans acquired on a 4.7 T Varian INOVA
imaging system (Varian) using a quadrature birdcage coil [26].
2.4. Intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed immediately prior
to dietary intervention and following 11 and 12 weeks intervention,
respectively. For glucose tolerance tests Ffar2�/� and WT C57BL/6
mice were fasted for 14 h then injected intra-peritoneally (i.p.) with 2 g/
kg glucose. For insulin tolerance tests, mice were fasted for 5 h then
i.p. injected with 1 IUkg�1 insulin (Humulin 100 IUml�1). Blood glucose
measurements were taken via tail bleed using a glucometer (Bayer
contour�).
2.5. Energy expenditure and physical activity
Energy expenditure and physical activity were determined in 14-
week old Ffar2�/� and WT C57BL/6 mice fed HFC or HFI diet for
4 weeks. Animals were transferred to individual cages in an open-
circuit calorimeter (Oxymax Series; Columbus Instruments, Colum-
bus, OH, USA). Temperature was maintained at 22 �C, with airflow
of 0.6 L/min. Mice were acclimatized to the cages for 24 h before
beginning 24-h recording of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon
dioxide production (VCO2). Energy expenditure (kilocalories of heat
produced) was calculated as calorific value (CV) � VO2, where
CV ¼ 3.815 þ 1.232 � RER as previously published [27]. Physical
activity was also measured, using an OPTO-M3 sensor system
(Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA), whereby ambulatory
counts were a record of consecutive adjacent photo beam breaks in
the horizontal space (X and Y axis). Data were presented as hourly
averages for energy expenditure as well as hourly summation for
ambulatory activities. The calorimeter was calibrated before each
use using highly pure primary gas standards (O2 and CO2).
2.6. Fecal mass and energy content
Fecal matter was collected over four days. Energy content in the feces
was determined in duplicate using a bomb calorimeter (PARR 1356;
John Morris Scientific Pty Limited, Australia). Briefly, feces was
compressed, pelleted (PARR Instrument Company; Moline, IL, USA),
and weighed. Pellets were frozen and then freeze-dried (Telstar
Cryodos �80 �C freeze dryer, Progen Scientific, UK) for 24 h. Each
pellet was re-weighed to determine moisture content, placed in the
bomb calorimeter for combustion, and energy content determined
against a standard (benzoic acid).
2.7. Quantitative enzymatic determination of glycerol
Quantitative enzymatic determination of glycerol was carried out using
Free Glycerol Reagent (SigmaeAldrich) following alkaline hydrolysis of
triglycerides to glycerol and free fatty acids. Triplicate samples were
diluted 1/5 and 10 ml was used for analysis.
2.8. Tissue collection
Anesthetized mice were sacrificed by decapitation following a 4 h fast.
Blood was collected into heparinized syringes and transferred to tubes
containing 15 ml Trasylol (10,000 K IUml�1) (Nordic Pharma) and 10 ml
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor KR-62436 hydrate (2.7 mM)
(Sigma). Colonic tissue for immunohistochemistry was fixed in Bouin’s
solution overnight at 4 �C and then paraffin embedded. Tissue samples
for protein or triglyceride analysis were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen

 and stored at �80 �C. Samples for RNA analysis were stored in
RNAlater� (QIAGEN).
2.9. Biochemical analyses
LPS concentration in portal vein blood collected under terminal
anesthesia was measured by using Endosafe-MCS (Charles River
Laboratories) based on the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) kinetic
chromogenic methodology as previously described [28].
2.10. DNA isolation from mouse colonic samples
The colonic content of mice collected post mortem was stored
at �80 �C. Metagenomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp-DNA
stool mini-kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The
primers and probes used to detect total bacteria, Bifidobacterium and
Lactobacillus spp., were based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (Table 1)
Detection was achieved with a STEP one PLUS instrument and soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems) using MESA FAST qPCR MasterMix Plus for
SYBR Assay (Eurogentec). Each assay was performed in duplicate in
the same run. The cycle threshold of each sample was then compared
to a standard curve (performed in triplicate) made by diluting genomic
DNA (five-fold serial dilution) (BCCM/LMG and DSMZ). The data were
expressed as Log bacteria/g of colonic content.
2.11. Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma). Quantification
and integrity analysis of total RNA was performed by running 1 ml of
each sample on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000
Nano Kit, Agilent). RNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA
reverse transcription kit (Life technologies). Gene expression of
POMC, NPY, AgRP, Pax4, Pax6, Foxa1, and Foxa2 was quantified
using 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System and TaqMan fluorogenic
detection system (Applied Biosystems). Validated primers were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. Comparative real-time PCR
was performed in triplicate and data was analyzed according to the
2�DCT method normalized to 18S.
Real-time PCRs of ZO1 and Occludin were performed with the
StepOnePlus� real-time PCR system and software (Applied Bio-
systems) using Mesa Fast qPCR� (Eurogentec) for detection ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. RPL19 RNA was chosen as
the housekeeping gene. All samples were run in duplicate and data
were analyzed according to the 2�DCT method. The identity and purity
of the amplified product was checked through analysis of the melting
curve carried out at the end of amplification. Primer sequences for the
targeted mouse genes are presented.
2.12. Organ culture
Fresh perigonadal WAT and subcutaneous WAT fat pads (w100 mg)
were cultured in 1 ml of RPMI serum free medium for 24 h as pre-
viously described [29]. Cytokines secreted were measured after 24 h
by specific TNF-a ELISA (DuoSet ELISA Development kit, R&D, and
ELISA Ready-SET-Go, eBioscience). Data are shown as the concen-
tration of cytokines secreted in 1 ml of culture medium per gram of fat.
2.13. Isolation of mononuclear cells and flow cytometry
The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) containing mononuclear cells and
pre-adipocytes was extracted from adipose tissue as previously
described [29] and cells were stained with antibodies conjugated to
fluorochromes, CD45 (30-F1), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8
(53e6.7), NKp46 (29A1.4), B220 (RA3-6B2), CD11b (M1/70), F4/80
(BM8) (eBiosciences). 7-Amino-actinomycin D (eBiosciences) or LIVE/
DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen) were utilized to discriminate
between live and dead cells. Samples were acquired using a LSRII
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and data were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star).
2.14. Quantification of gut hormone concentrations
Peptides were extracted from colonic tissue in boiling 0.5 mol L�1
acetic acid for 15 min. Colonic PYY, GLP-1, and substance P con-
centrations were determined using established in-house radioimmu-
noassays [30]. The concentration of glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIP) was measured using a commercially available kit
(Merck Millipore). Similar to colonic peptide levels, circulating and
portal vein GLP-1 and PYY concentrations were determined using in-
house radioimmunoassays. Circulating leptin was measured using a
commercially available kit (Merck Millipore).
2.15. Primary mixed colonic culture secretion experiments
WT and Ffar2�/� mice aged 8e10 weeks were killed by CO2. Colons
were collected and cleaned in ice-cold Leibovitz-15 medium (PAA).
Tissue was digested with 0.4 mgml�1 Collagenase-XI (Sigma) in high
glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (10% fetal calf
serum, 100 Uml�1 penicillin, and 0.1 mgml�1 streptomycin) at 37 �C
as previously described [31]. Cell suspensions were centrifuged
(5 min, 300 �g) and the pellets re-suspended in DMEM. Cell sus-
pensions were filtered through a nylon mesh (pore size w250 mm) and
plated onto 24-well, 1% Matrigel-coated plates and incubated over-
night at 37 �C in 95% O2 and 5% CO2.
Secretion studies were performed 24 h after culture preparation.
Cultures were washed with secretion buffer (4.5 mM KCl, 138 mM
NaCl, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4$2H2O, 2.6 mM CaCl2,
1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) and
incubated with 50 mM SCFA (acetate:propionate:butyrate 60:25:15)
in secretion buffer for 2 h at 37 �C. Supernatants were collected and
centrifuged. Cells were treated with lysis buffer containing: 50 mM
TriseHCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA 630, 0.5% deoxycholic
acid, and one tablet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). PYY and GLP-1 were assayed in supernatants and
cell extracts by radioimmunoassay as previously described [32,33].
Hormone secretion was expressed as a fraction of the total of that
hormone.
2.16. Immunofluorescence and microscopy
7 mm wax embedded sections were stained for PYY using primary
polyclonal rabbit anti-PYY (1:1000, Abcam, ab22663), with secondary
FITC-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Abcam, ab6825).
Staining for GLP-1 was carried out using primary polyclonal mouse
anti-GLP-1 with secondary TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:200,
Abcam, ab5867). BrdU was stained for using primary monoclonal
mouse anti-BrdU (1:100, Sigma, 13843420001) with secondary
TRITC-conjugated polyclonal goat F(Ab) anti-mouse (1:200). 5HT was
stained for using primary goat anti-5HT (1:500 Abcam, ab66047) with
polyclonal donkey anti-goat (1:50, Abcam, ab6566). Nuclei were
stained with DAPI (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in Fluroshield
(Abcam). Immunofluorescent images were acquired on a Carl Zeiss
Axiovert 100S TV microscope. The operator performing the cell-
counting was blinded to the groupings.
2.17. PYY-GFP organoid culture and treatments
Mouse intestinal crypts from transgenic PYY-GFP mice (a kind gift
from Prof. Rodger Liddle, Duke University) [34] were isolated,
cultured, and grown into organoids as described previously [35].

 Crypts were cultured in advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me-
dium/F12 containing 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM
HEPES, 2 mM Glutamax, supplements N2 (1�) and B27 (1�), and
50 ng/mL mouse epidermal growth factor (all from Life Technologies);
and 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (SigmaeAldrich) and mouse Noggin and
mouse R-spondin-1, both as 10% conditioned medium. Medium was
changed every 2 days. On day 2 after splitting, either 10 mM CFMB or
10 mM AR420626 was added to the medium. For control mouse
organoids, regular medium without CFMB or AR420626 was used.
Organoids were imaged on day 6, after 96 h of treatment, using a
Nikon Inverted Spinning Disk confocal equipped with a humidified,
temperature control environmental chamber. Images were obtained
using NIS Elements AR software. To count the number of PYY positive
cells in each organoid we obtained a continuous z-dimension stack
(step size: 5 mM).
2.18. Wholemount immunostaining of organoids
Organoids were isolated from Matrigel, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 4%
PFA. After permeabilization for 30 min, organoids were blocked with
3% BSA. Organoids were incubated overnight with a primary antibody
against GLP-1 (Abcam). Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse (Jackson
Laboratories) was used as secondary antibody. To count the number of
GLP-1 positive cells in each organoid, we obtained a continuous z-
dimension stack (step size: 5 mM) using a Nikon Inverted Spinning Disk
confocal.
2.19. Statistics
Data are presented as the mean � SEM. Most of the experiments were
evaluated by a two-way ANOVA. A generalized estimating equation
was applied for analysis of food intake and body weight. Comparisons
were considered statistically significant when P was less than 0.05.
3. RESULTS
3.1. FFAR2 is required for the beneficial effects of fermentable
carbohydrate supplementation on body weight
Inulin supplementation protects against body weight gain in humans
and animals [10e12]. We hypothesized that this is due to FFAR2
activation by SCFAs following microbial fermentation. To investigate
the contribution of FFAR2, Ffar2�/� mice and WT littermates were fed
a HFD supplemented with inulin or a non-fermentable isocaloric control
diet for 14 weeks. We have previously found that this diet results in a
doubling of colonic SCFA concentration following 8 weeks supple-
mentation in mice with the same genetic background [26].
Body weight was not affected by genotype at age 8e10 weeks when
mice were fed standard chow (WT: 24.89 � 0.34 g, Ffar2�/�:
25.70 � 0.42 g) (Supplementary Figure 1a). However, inulin supple-
mentation exerted a protective effect against diet-induced obesity over
the following 14 weeks, dependent on FFAR2 expression (percentage

2.83%,

HFI:
20.38 � 1.25%; Ffar2�/� HFC: 30.49 � 2.38%, Ffar2�/� HFI:
30.67 � 3.65%, p < 0.001) (Figure 1A). MRI analysis revealed that
differences in body weight were due to decreased adiposity (p < 0.05)
(Figure 1B). As expected, inulin supplementation also reduced liver
triglyceride (p < 0.05) and leptin concentrations (p < 0.05) in WT
mice, corresponding to lower fat mass (Figure 1CeD). Taken together,
these data demonstrate that the ability of inulin to prevent weight gain
in response to HFD is FFAR2-dependent.
The reduction in body weight observed in WT mice supplemented with
inulin was associated with decreased food intake (WT HFC:
190.1 � 5.9 g; WT HFI: 181.9 � 5.7 g, Ffar2�/� HFC: 190.5 � 3.7 g,
Ffar2�/� HFI: 193.6 � 4.3 g (p < 0.05)) (Figure 1E). As appetite is
regulated via appetite-inhibiting (anorexigenic) pro-opiomelanocortin
(POMC) neurons and appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) neuropeptide Y
(NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) co-expressing neurons within
the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, we measured gene expression of
these neuropeptides. Expression of all three hypothalamic neuropep-
tides has previously been demonstrated to be sensitive to nutritional
status, such that orexigenic neuropeptides Npy and Agrp are elevated
following fasting [36,37], while anorexigenic neuropeptide Pomc
expression is reduced [38]. As such gene expression of these neu-
ropeptides serves as an indicator of anorectic drive. While we found
that inulin supplementation did not alter Pomc or Npy expression
(Figure 1FeG), Agrp expression was decreased in WT but not Ffar2�/�
mice (p < 0.05) (Figure 1H), suggesting that inulin acts via FFAR2 to
decrease hypothalamic orexigenic drive.
Body weight is not only a function of food intake, it is also governed by
energy absorption and expenditure. To determine whether the
reduction in body weight was associated with alterations in energy
expenditure, we measured locomotor activity and basal metabolic rate,
both of which were unaffected by diet or genotype (Figure 1IeJ). As
energy expenditure is influenced by brown adipose tissue thermo-
genesis, gene expression of the thermogenic protein Ucp1 was
measured. In agreement with recently published data, gene expression
of Ucp1 was unchanged following inulin supplementation (Figure 1K)
[39]. To assess energy absorption, fecal energy content was
measured. Inulin supplementation modestly reduced fecal energy loss
in WT and Ffar2�/� mice (p < 0.05) (Figure 1L). Collectively, these
data demonstrate the effect of inulin on body weight was not due to
increased energy expenditure or fecal energy loss but was likely a
result of the decrease in food intake.
3.2. Glucose homeostasis improvement following fermentable
carbohydrate supplementation is dependent on FFAR2
Fermentable carbohydrate consumption has previously been shown to
be associated with an improvement in glucose homeostasis [11]. Prior
to dietary intervention, all groups were equally glucose tolerant and
insulin sensitive (Supplementary Figure 2). After 13 weeks, WT mice
given inulin exhibited improved glucose tolerance (p < 0.05). However,
insulin tolerance was unchanged (Supplementary Figure 2). Interest-
ingly, inulin lowered fasted glucose levels in WT and Ffar2�/� mice via
a non-FFAR2 mediated mechanism (p < 0.01) (Supplementary
Figure 2).
3.3. Deletion of FFAR2 does not alter the microbial density of
Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., or total bacteria within the
colon
Colonic microbial density and species composition influence inulin
fermentation and SCFA production. Therefore, it was possible that
FFAR2 could drive alterations in microbial diversity and account for
the metabolic benefits we observed. To address this, we carried out
targeted enquiry of bacterial species that are important for inulin
fermentation and that are increased by fermentable carbohydrate
supplementation. Total bacterial numbers were increased by inulin
supplementation (p < 0.001), consistent with previous studies [40].
Additionally, species belonging to the Bifidobacterium spp., which
play a key role in fermenting inulin, were also increased (p < 0.05),
while the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. was unaltered. Impor-
tantly, there were no effects of genotype on microbial number or
species-specific density (Figure 2); hence, the FFAR2-dependent
effects of inulin on body weight are not driven by alterations in
bacterial cell density.

 3.4. Improvements in glucose homeostasis were not associated
with adipose tissue immune cell infiltration
Obesity-associated inflammation impairs glucose homeostasis. As
FFAR2 is involved in immune cell chemotaxis [41], we examined the
white adipose tissue (WAT) immune cell phenotype (Supplementary
Figure 3). FFAR2 deletion reduced the infiltration of subcutaneous
WAT immune cells (CD45þ) and visceral WAT macrophages (CD11bþ
F4/80þ) as previously described [42] (p < 0.05). Inulin supplemen-
tation reduced CD4þ T-cell infiltration in subcutaneous WAT of WT

(Supplementary Figure 2d) (p < 0.01). However, it is unlikely that
reduced CD4þ T-cell infiltration directly influenced glucose homeo-
stasis as immune cell populations were also decreased by Ffar2
deletion, which was not associated with such improvements.
Conversely, one observation, which could account for improved
glucose homeostasis, was that spontaneous TNF-a release from
visceral WAT decreased following inulin supplementation in WT ani-
mals (p < 0.01) (Supplementary Figure 3j).
3.5. Improvements in glucose homeostasis were not associated
with alterations in markers of intestinal barrier function
Systemic inflammation is also influenced by intestinal leakage of pro-
inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As microbiota influence intes-
tinal barrier function [43], we measured gene expression of intestinal
tight junction proteins as a marker of barrier integrity. Inulin supple-
mentation caused a trend towards an increase in gene expression of
tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin independently of genotype
(Supplementary Figure 4aec). Portal vein LPS was also measured as
an indicator of barrier function. Inulin did not influence circulating LPS
concentrations, indicating that alterations in intestinal barrier function
are also unlikely to contribute to the observed metabolic improvements
(Supplementary Figure 4d).
3.6. Fermentable carbohydrate supplementation stimulates FFAR2-
dependent release of PYY
Increased PYY and GLP-1 secretion has been implicated in mediating
the effects of fermentable carbohydrate on body composition and
glucose homeostasis [44,45]. To investigate whether changes in body
weight were associated with release of these hormones, we measured
portal vein PYY and GLP-1 concentrations following 2 weeks dietary
intervention before significant differences in body weight between
groups are apparent. Inulin supplementation significantly increased
circulating PYY in WT (p < 0.05) but not in Ffar2�/� mice (p ¼ 0.39)
(WT HFC: 54.7 � 17.0 pmol L�1, WT HFI: 84.9 � 19.3 pmol L�1,

�
22.2

L�1,
Ffar2�/�
HFI:

portal vein PYY appears to be reduced and not completely abolished by
FFAR2 deletion, as the difference between WT HFI and Ffar2�/� HFI
groups was not significant. In contrast to PYY, GLP-1 release was
increased independently of FFAR2 following inulin supplementation
(WT: p < 0.05, Ffar2�/�: 0.0548) (Figure 3B), demonstrating that
inulin differentially regulates PYY and GLP-1 secretion via FFAR2-
dependent and independent mechanisms respectively.
While SCFAs are implicated in mediating the effects of inulin due to the
selectivity of FFAR2 for these metabolites, we confirmed their role in a
primary colonic cell model [31]. Exposure to mixed SCFAs, in the same
ratio as found in the gut following inulin fermentation [46], increased
secretion of PYY by 127% (p < 0.0001) and GLP-1 by 54%
(p < 0.001) compared to baseline. This effect was not observed in
Ffar2�/� tissue (PYY: p ¼ 0.07, GLP-1: p ¼ 0.42), indicating SCFAs
act via FFAR2 to stimulate both PYY and GLP-1 secretion (Figure 3Ce
D). These findings are similar to the results of Tolhurst et al., who
demonstrated FFAR2-dependent GLP-1 release in response to mixed
SCFAs [24]. The dependence of SCFA-induced GLP-1 secretion on
FFAR2 expression is contrary to the receptor-independent effects
observed in vivo. This may be due to SCFAs acting via different acute
vs. chronic mechanisms. Alternatively, other fermentation products
present in vivo could influence GLP-1 secretion.
3.7. Fermentable carbohydrate acts via FFAR2 to specifically
increase colonic PYY
Increased concentrations of circulating PYY and GLP-1 following inulin
supplementation may reflect an increased capacity of the gut to
secrete these hormones due to increased colonic hormone content. To
address this, we measured colonic PYY and GLP-1 concentrations.
Following inulin supplementation, colonic PYY was increased by 130%,
(p < 0.05) an effect that was abolished in Ffar2�/� animals (p ¼ 0.65)
(Figure 3E). In contrast, inulin significantly increased colonic GLP-1
regardless of genotype and thus was not receptor dependent (WT:
p < 0.01, Ffar2�/�: p < 0.01) (Figure 3F). These effects were specific
to L cells as hormones expressed in developmentally distinct enter-
oendocrine cell types such as GIP and Substance P were unchanged.
Crypt length as well as goblet and enterochromaffin cell densities were
also unaffected (Supplementary Figure 5). Colonic PYY and GLP-1
concentrations reflected the circulating concentrations, indicating
that inulin increases gut hormone release by increasing the amount of
PYY and GLP-1 within the colon.
3.8. Fermentable carbohydrate supplementation increases PYY cell
density in the proximal colon via FFAR2
To determine whether the increased colonic PYY and GLP-1 concen-
trations were due to an increase in L cell density, we used

 immunofluorescent staining to quantify PYY- and GLP-1-expressing
cells. Body weight at the time of tissue collection was not signifi-
cantly different between groups (2 weeks on inulin supplemented diet)
(Supplementary Figure 6). In WT mice, inulin supplementation caused
an 87% increase in PYY (p < 0.05) and 73% increase in GLP-1 cell
density (p < 0.05). Whereas, in Ffar2�/� mice, GLP-1 cell density was
increased by 60% (p < 0.05), and PYY cell-density was unchanged
(p ¼ 0.23) (Figure 4). While the expansion of the PYY-expressing cell
population is dependent on FFAR2, the expansion of the GLP-1-
expressing cell population occurs independently of FFAR2. We also
observed an increase in the density of cells that co-express both
hormones (Figure 4C). Therefore, the increase in GLP-1 cell density
appears to be due to GLP-1 being expressed in cells that would
otherwise have been PYY singly labeled cells. Conversely, the increase
in PYY cell density was due to an expansion of L cells that did not
express GLP-1. These data demonstrate that inulin increases colonic
gut hormone concentrations by increasing the density of specific
enteroendocrine cell types in the colon.
To assess whether increased PYY cell density was due to an increase
in the rate of PYY cell formation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was
administered to mice for the second week of a 2-week intervention.
BrdU incorporates into the DNA of dividing cells, allowing identification
of newly formed cells. PYY-expressing cells, which stained positive for
BrdU, were 129% more abundant in WT (p ¼ 0.0003) but not Ffar2�/�
mice (p ¼ 0.53) following inulin supplementation (Figure 4D), con-
firming that inulin promotes formation of new PYY cells in a FFAR2-
dependent manner.
In rodents, the intestinal epithelium is replaced every 4e5 days [47].
Newly formed colonic cells are generated from multipotent stem cells
through progressive restrictions in developmental potential. The fate of
a cell is the result of the expression of specific transcription factors,
which orchestrate intricate differentiation pathways by regulating the
transcription of various genes. While it is currently unclear which
factors direct expression of each specific gut hormone, transcription
factors known to function in terminal differentiation of GLP-1 and PYY
cells include Pax4, Pax6, Foxa1, and Foxa2 [48e51]. To further

 elucidate the mechanism by which inulin regulates the expansion of
PYY cells, we measured gene expression of these transcription factors.
While Pax6, Foxa1 and Foxa2 were unaltered following inulin feeding,
Pax4 was significantly and receptor-dependently increased (WT:
p ¼ 0.017, Ffar2�/�: p ¼ 0.69) (Figure 5). This suggests that Pax4
may link FFAR2 activation to the expansion of the PYY cell population.
3.9. FFAR2 but not FFAR3 activation increases PYY cell density
in vitro
To determine the relative roles of FFAR2 and FFAR3 on PYY and GLP-1
cell density, we used selective agonists for FFAR2 (CFMB) [52] and
FFAR3 (AR420626) [35] in an in vitro organoid culture. The doses of
each agonist were chosen based on previous reports in the literature
and because they did not result in cellular toxicity in our organoid model.
Tolhurst et al. demonstrate that a dose of 30 mM of CFMB increases
calcium flux in isolated colonic cultures [45]. Whilst Nohr et al. [46] used
doses of 10 mM and 30 mM of both agonists based on their potencies.
CFMB is reported to have an IC50 of 4.7 mM at FFAR2 but displays no
activity at FFAR3 up to 1 mM, while AR420626 is reported to have an
IC50 value of 117 nM for FFAR3 and does not activate FFAR2 at con-
centrations up to 100 mM in cAMP accumulation assays [52].
Primary intestinal crypts from PYY-GFP mice were cultured in a three-
dimensional, growth-factor rich environment, recapitulating in vivo
colonic multi-lineage differentiation [35,53]. Exposure of colonic
organoids to FFAR2 agonist CFMB led to increased PYY, but not GLP-1
cell density (p < 0.001) (Figure 6). In contrast, the FFAR3 agonist had
no effect on PYY or GLP-1 cell density. It therefore appears that SCFAs
act via FFAR2 but not FFAR3 to increase PYY cell density.
4. DISCUSSION
The discovery that gut microbiota influences physiology and, in certain
circumstances, may cause disease pathologies has led to an intensive
research effort to unravel microbiotaehost interactions. Understanding
the effects of microbial fermentation on host metabolism has been of
particular interest, because consumption of fermentable carbohydrate
reduces appetite and prevents body weight gain [10e12,20]. Evidence
points to the production of SCFAs by the gut microbiota as an important
appetite regulatory signal. In this study, we report for the first time that
FFAR2 expression is essential for inulin to exert these beneficial ef-
fects. As such, targeting this pathway in man could be a viable means
of preventing obesity.
Our key finding is that fermentable carbohydrate drives an increase in
PYY-cell density within the colon, which is mediated via FFAR2 and
results in increased circulating PYY concentrations. This is associated
with a reduction in food intake and protection against diet-induced
obesity. Furthermore, FFAR2 but not FFAR3 activation at the level of
the intestinal epithelium is sufficient to increase PYY cell density in
isolated organoids. We also demonstrate that inulin, acting via FFAR2,
stimulates the expression of Pax4, a transcription factor that has
previously been shown to be essential for differentiation of PYY cells in
the fetal mouse colon [54]. We therefore propose that inulin, following
microbial fermentation to SCFAs, acts via FFAR2 to influence cellular
differentiation pathways and promote PYY cell fate. Increasing the
density of PYY cells provides the colon with a greater potential for
release of PYY, which is known to reduce food intake.
A number of interesting questions remain to be answered. As FFAR2
activation drives changes in enteroendocrine cell fate, is it expressed by
progenitor cells, either by epithelial LgR5þ stem cells or by endocrine
NGN3þ progenitors, or does FFAR2 act later in the enteroendocrine
development pathway? Lineage tracing experiments could allow the
determination of the origin of newly generated PYY singly labeled cells.
Furthermore, it will be important in the future to determine the intra-
cellular pathways triggered by FFAR2 activation that lead to altered
endocrine cell fate. Understanding these processes could identify tar-
gets for manipulation of endocrine cell fate in order to treat disease.

 While we describe an important role for FFAR2 in driving increased PYY
secretion, FFAR2 signaling has previously been reported to influence
food intake and body weight via the inhibition of ghrelin secretion [52]
and the suppression of insulin signaling in adipocytes [55]. As such, it
is likely that SCFAs exert their effects on metabolism via multiple
complementary pathways. However, fermentation occurs primarily in
the colon where there is a high density of L cells, suggesting that the
mechanism described here plays a critical role in transducing the
effects of SCFAs on appetite.
The luminal concentrations of SCFAs within the colon have been
estimated to be 70e130 mmol [56]. This exceeds the concentration
range to which FFAR2 is sensitive and would suggest that colonic
FFAR2 is constantly active. However, due to a number of factors, it is
unlikely that FFA receptors are exposed to these concentrations.
Firstly, in the colon, the microbiota are compartmentalized to the outer
mucus layer; the inner mucus layer contains almost no microbiota and
serves to protect the epithelium. Therefore, there is a separation be-
tween the bacteria and the epithelium, through which a concentration
gradient would form. In the distal colon, the w50 mm inner mucus
layer has been shown to be replaced every hour [57]. Secondly, the
crypt opening is narrow, creating further impediment to the diffusion of
SCFAs. Finally, SCFAs are rapidly absorbed by the epithelial cells,
thereby depleting the concentration of SCFAs in the immediate envi-
ronment. The precise concentration of the different SCFAs at the level
of the colonic epithelium is not known. However, based on the EC50
values of SCFAs for FFAR2 one might imagine that the local SCFA
concentration would be in the micromolar range [15].
Additionally, there are likely to be non-receptor mediated actions of
SCFAs following dietary fermentable carbohydrate supplementation.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that acetate alters hypothalamic
neuronal activity [58]. However, the central actions of SCFAs on food
intake, to date, have only been observed acutely following intra-
cerebroventricular administration [58]. In contrast, our data describe
long-term FFAR2-dependent adaptations, which may underlie the
ability of fermentable carbohydrates to exert sustained reductions in
body weight. SCFA also have been reported to act via a non-receptor
mediated mechanism within the liver and adipose tissue to reduce
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-g) expres-
sion, thereby preventing body weight gain and improving insulin
sensitivity [59]. These observations are described following dietary
supplementation with SCFAs as opposed to fermentable carbohydrate.
In contrast to the microbiota-dependant production of SCFAs from
fermentable carbohydrate, dietary SCFAs can be absorbed earlier in
the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore colonic mechanisms would be
largely evaded. Collectively, the accumulating data within this field
reveal a complex system of intertwined receptor- and non-receptor
mediated mechanisms that act together to prevent body weight gain.
In agreement with previous studies, we also find that fermentable
carbohydrate increased GLP-1 secretion [44,45]. This could explain the
decreased fasted plasma glucose observed with inulin supplementa-
tion due to the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1 [60]. In support of this, it
has recently been demonstrated that dibenzapine administration,
which blocks the Notch signaling pathway, increases intestinal GLP-1
cell numbers in a HFD model of impaired glucose tolerance and

 improves insulin responses to glucose and glucose tolerance [61].
Alternatively, recently published data suggest that the improvements in
glucose homeostasis could be associated with FFAR3-dependant al-
terations in intestinal gluconeogenesis [62,63]. Propionate signals via
FFAR3 expressed on periportal afferent neurons and via a gut-brain
neural circuit to induce intestinal gluconeogenesis, which results in
improved glucose homeostasis [63].
Similar to the increase in PYY, the increase in circulating GLP-1 was
associated with a greater cell density. Previously Cani et al. have
demonstrated that fermentable carbohydrate increases colonic GLP-1
cell density in association with increased expression of the tran-
scription factor Neurogenin3 (NGN3) [44,64]. NGN3 acts upstream of
Pax4, Pax6, Foxa1, and Foxa2 and is responsible for determining an
enteroendocrine cell fate. This suggests that fermentable carbohydrate
increases production of new enteroendocrine cells. However, the
observed increase in GLP-1 cell density was not associated with al-
terations in Pax4, Pax6, Foxa1, and Foxa2 expression, indicating that
these transcription factors are not responsible for driving increases in
GLP-1 cell density in response to inulin.
Contrary to the increase in PYY cell density, the increase in GLP-1 cell
density occurred independently of FFAR2. In agreement with a number
of other studies, we found only partial co-localization of PYY and GLP-1
[23,65e69], despite the prevailing view that GLP-1 and PYY are co-
expressed in L cells and co-stored in secretory vesicles. This may
be because the degree of co-localization varies depending on location
along the proximaledistal axis, between species, with metabolic state,
and between studies [66,67]. It is therefore of great interest to identify
factors that differentially modulate the expression of these two gut
hormones.
The mechanism underlying the increase in GLP-1 cell density does not
appear to be FFAR3 activation, as FFAR3 agonism did not alter the
density of GLP-1 cells in organoids. Furthermore, Ffar2 deletion has
previously been shown to prevent SCFA-induced GLP-1 release in vitro
to a greater degree than FFAR3 deletion [24], suggesting that FFAR3
may be less important in mediating SCFA signaling in L cells. One
possibility is that SCFAs cross the cell membrane via non-ionic
diffusion and may act intracellularly to increase GLP-1 cell density
[70]. However, such a mechanism perhaps would be associated with a
more generalized proliferative effect compared to the very specific
effects that we observed. Finally, and more plausibly, additional
bioactive fermentation products may stimulate an expansion of the
GLP-1 cell population. Undoubtedly, elucidation of this mechanism will

 be an important discovery that could improve treatment options for
diabetes.
5. CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that FFAR2 is pivotal for transducing the
beneficial metabolic effects of fermentable carbohydrate. By stimu-
lating microbial SCFA production using inulin, we demonstrate that
these fermentation products act via FFAR2 to drive an expansion of the
PYY cell population within the proximal colon. The resulting increase in
cell density leads to increased circulating PYY, which previously has
been shown to reduce appetite [71]. This presents a new under-
standing of gut physiology whereby the gut exhibits cellular plasticity,
allowing it to respond to alterations in dietary composition. Such
changes alter the capacity for anorectic signaling (Figure 7). This
paradigm likely represents a more general physiological mechanism
and, if true, begs the question as to whether other nutrients or mi-
crobial metabolites influence enteroendocrine plasticity in order to alter
host physiology. By targeting this pathway with drugs or nutraceut-
icals, it may be possible to prime the colon to produce a greater
anorectic signal in response to nutrients to treat or prevent obesity.
