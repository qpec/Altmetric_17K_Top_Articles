Microglia are highly motile glial cells that are proposed to mediate synaptic pruning during
neuronal circuit formation. Disruption of signaling between microglia and neurons leads to an
excess of immature synaptic connections, thought to be the result of impaired phagocytosis
of synapses by microglia. However, until now the direct phagocytosis of synapses by
microglia has not been reported and fundamental questions remain about the precise
synaptic structures and phagocytic mechanisms involved. Here we used light sheet fluor-
escence microscopy to follow microglia–synapse interactions in developing organotypic
hippocampal cultures, complemented by a 3D ultrastructural characterization using corre-
lative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Our findings define a set of dynamic
microglia–synapse interactions, including the selective partial phagocytosis, or trogocytosis
(trogo-: nibble), of presynaptic structures and the induction of postsynaptic spine head
filopodia by microglia. These findings allow us to propose a mechanism for the facilitatory
role of microglia in synaptic circuit remodeling and maturation.

icroglia are glial cells that derive from the myeloid
hematopoietic lineage and take up long-lived residence
in the developing brain. In response to brain injury,
microglia migrate to the site of damage and participate in the
phagocytic removal of cellular debris1. The recent discovery that
microglia are also highly motile in the uninjured brain2,3, con-
tinuously extending and retracting processes through the extra-
cellular space, suggests that they may monitor and contribute to
synaptic maturation and function. Clues to this activity come
from observations that during early postnatal development
microglia
undergo
morphological
maturation
that matches
synaptic maturation4, and that they express receptors for neu-
ronal signaling factors that are upregulated during this period5.
These data, combined with the known phagocytic capacity of
myeloid cells, led to the hypothesis that microglia may have a role
in the phagocytic elimination of synapses as part of the wide-
spread pruning of exuberant synaptic connections during devel-
opment6,7. This hypothesis was supported by two studies that
reported the selective engulfment of synaptic structures by
microglia and the appearance of excess immature synapses in
mice lacking either the fractalkine8 (Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1) or comple-
ment component9 (C1q/C3/CR3) microglia signaling pathways.
Numerous studies have confirmed an important role for
microglia in promoting synapse and circuit maturation. Knock-
out (KO) mice lacking complement factors show cortical excita-
tory hyperconnectivity10, supporting a role for microglia in the
elimination of excess synapses in the mammalian neocortex. KO
mice lacking fractalkine receptor show transient excitatory
hyperconnectivity followed by weak synaptic multiplicity and
reduced functional brain connectivity in adulthood11,12, sug-
gesting that a failure to eliminate synapses at the correct devel-
opmental time prevents the normal strengthening of synaptic
connections. Notably, inhibitory synapses in hippocampus appear
to be unaffected by disruptions of neuron–microglia signaling11
(but see ref. 13). Microglia are also likely to be required for
environment-induced brain plasticity as mice lacking microglia
P2Y12 receptors show deficits in early monocular deprivation-
associated visual cortical plasticity14. At the same time, studies
have pointed to a role for microglia in synapse formation in the
adult brain, showing that they can elicit calcium transients and
the formation of filopodia from dendritic branches15, and that
they are required for learning-induced synapse formation16.
Together, these studies suggest that microglia have a complex role
in shaping maturing circuits.
An important question raised by these studies is whether synaptic
phagocytosis by microglia underlies some or all of these phenotypes.
Unfortunately, support for a role of microglia in the phagocytic
elimination of synapses is based entirely on indirect evidence—
localization of synaptic material within microglia in fixed specimens
and increased synapse density following the disruption of microglia
function. In this study, we set out to test the hypothesis that
microglia engulf and eliminate synapses during mouse hippocampal
development. First, we carried out quantitative confocal microscopy
analysis of microglia–synapse interactions in fixed hippocampal
tissue. Microglia were found to contact dendritic spines, but contrary
to previous reports we found no evidence for the elimination of
postsynaptic material. Second, we confirmed these data at the
ultrastructural level by correlative light and electron microscopy
(CLEM) using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy
(FIB-SEM) and discovered evidence for the partial elimination, or
trogocytosis, of presynaptic boutons and axons by microglia. Tro-
gocytosis has been described in the immune system as a non-
apoptotic mechanism for the rapid capture of membrane compo-
nents and differs from phagocytosis, which involves the engulfment
and elimination of larger cellular structures (> 1 µm)17–19. Third, we
carried out time-lapse light sheet microscopy of microglia–synapse
interactions in organotypic hippocampal cultures and observed the
trogocytosis of exclusively presynaptic material. Time-lapse micro-
scopy also revealed the frequent induction of spine head filopodia at
sites of microglia–synapse contacts and these were confirmed at the
ultrastructural level. Our findings provide the first direct evidence
for the elimination of synaptic material by microglia in living brain
tissue and suggest that microglia facilitate circuit maturation by a
combination of trogocytosis of the axonal compartment and the
remodeling of postsynaptic sites.
Results
No evidence for phagocytosis of spines by microglia. To iden-
tify the period of maximal microglia phagocytic activity in post-
natal
hippocampal
development,
we
performed
immuno-
colocalization analysis of Iba1-labelled microglia with CD68, a
phagosomal marker, in fixed sections at postnatal day 8 (P8), P15,
P28, and P40 (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). CD68 immunoreactivity
was high at P8–P15 with a peak at P15 and a gradual decrease in
the following weeks. The CD68 immunoreactivity pattern at P15
was confirmed in genetically labeled microglia (Supplementary
Fig. 1c, d). These findings indicate that the second postnatal week
of mouse hippocampal development is likely to be a period of
active microglia phagocytosis and suggested that this period may
be most relevant to search for evidence of phagocytic elimination
of synapses by microglia.
Previous studies have presented indirect evidence for the
phagocytic engulfment of dendritic spines in hippocampus and
visual cortex8,14,20. For example, immunoreactivity for postsy-
naptic density 95 (PSD95) protein was found to be localized
inside microglia by confocal, super-resolution, and electron
microscopy8. We attempted to confirm these findings using
cytoplasmic neuronal and microglia markers, in triple transgenic
mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in sparse
excitatory neurons (Thy1::EGFP21) and tdTomato in microglia
(Cx3cr1::CreER16;
RC::LSL-tdTomato22).
We
analyzed
over
8900 spines from secondary dendrites of GFP + neurons in the
CA1 stratum radiatum of fixed hippocampal tissue at P15 and
found that about 3% of spines were contacted by microglia (n =
294). The majority of these contacts presented a relatively minor
colocalization of spine and microglia fluorescence (apposition,
Fig. 1a, c; n = 171, 1.9% of spines), whereas others were
characterized by more extensive colocalization as defined by >
70% of the spine surface contacted by microglia (encapsulation,
Fig. 1b, c; n = 123, 1.4% of spines). For each encapsulation event
we carefully examined the integrity of the spine head, neck, and
dendritic shaft, and found that in all cases, even in those where
the entire spine surface appeared to be contacted by microglia, an
intact GFP + spine neck remained visible (Fig. 1b–d). Thus, using
cytoplasmic markers to visualize neuronal and microglia material,
we were not able to confirm earlier evidence suggesting the
phagocytic engulfment of dendritic spines. To explore whether
phagocytic
activity
might
nevertheless
be
associated
with
microglia–spine contacts, we performed immunofluorescence
colocalization
of
the
phagosomal
marker
CD68
and
microglia–spine contacts. Approximately 15% of microglia–spine
contacts (apposition or encapsulation) showed apposed CD68
immunoreactivity (Fig. 1d), suggesting an involvement of local
phagocytic activity in the microglia–neuron contact event.
To test this hypothesis we developed a CLEM approach based
on previously published methods24,2523, to first identify rare
microglia–spine contact events by fluorescence microscopy and
then reconstruct in three dimensions the surrounding ultra-
structure by electron microscopy (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Movie 1). Following fixation of hippocampal tissue in a manner
compatible with electron microscopy, interaction events were

 identified by confocal microscopy. Once a region of interest
(ROI) was identified, concentric brands were etched into the
surface of the fixed tissue with a UV-laser microdissector
microscope and the tissue was embedded and prepared for
electron microscopy. The resulting trimmed block of tissue was
then subjected to X-ray imaging to identify vasculature and
nuclear landmarks, and align these with the branding. The block
was then subjected to FIB-SEM at 5 nm lateral pixel size and 8 nm
section thickness using the landmarks as guides to capture the
ROI. Four ultrastructural image stacks (up to 35 × 20 µm area;
2300 images) were obtained containing a total of 8 appositions
and 5 encapsulations. Three-dimensional ultrastructural recon-
struction confirmed microglia–spine apposition events where
microglia and spine membranes were in contact or juxtaposed (7/
8 apposed; Fig. 2f). However, most encapsulations appeared as
simple appositions (3/5) with only one ROI showing > 50% of the
spine surface contacted by microglia (Fig. 2b–f). These findings
show
that
caution
must
be
exercised
when
interpreting
colocalization of synaptic material with microglia using light
microscopy. Moreover, these data do not support the hypothesis
that microglia phagocytose dendritic spine material.
Microglia trogocytose presynaptic elements. Previous studies
have argued for the phagocytosis of presynaptic material by micro-
glia8,9,14,20 and we re-examined our electron microscopy datasets for
evidence of microglia engulfment of identified presynaptic structures.
We examined over 56 µm3 of microglial material for a total surface of
560 µm2 from eight reconstructed cells. We found 17 confirmed
double-membrane inclusion bodies (Fig. 3c). Two of these contained
putative presynaptic vesicles as indicated by their 40 nm diameter
(Fig. 3a, c and Supplementary Movie 2), suggesting that presynaptic
material is a substrate for elimination by microglia. In addition, we
found 20 double-membrane structures that appeared to be in the
process of engulfment. Many involved axonal shafts (8/20; Fig. 3b, c
and Supplementary Movie 3) and a smaller number involved pre-
synaptic boutons (3/20). We also frequently observed microglia self-
engulfment in which a microglial process was enwrapped and pin-
ched by another process from the same cell (9/20; Fig. 3c and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis of the size distribution of inclusions
revealed that the material being engulfed from boutons and axons
typically ranged between 0.01 and 0.05 µm3 (Fig. 3d) with an average
diameter of 253 ± 24 nm. This shows that presynaptic structures are
not entirely phagocytosed by microglia but rather “trogocytosed,” a
term originally coined to describe membrane transfer in immune
cells19 and later extended to refer to partial phagocytosis by various
cell types, including macrophages18,26,27. We also observed numer-
ous invaginations of microglia facing boutons or axons that allowed
us to reconstruct the putative sequence of events leading to the
microglial digestion of these structures (Fig. 3e). Engulfment did not
appear to be mediated by the formation of phagocytic cups, as no
microglial pseudopodia were observed at the contact site. Instead,
boutons or axonal pinches appear to sink into microglial cytoplasm
before closure of the membrane and subsequent trafficking. These
findings argue for the specific trogocytosis of presynaptic structures
by microglia and suggest that this activity may be oriented indis-
criminately toward axons and synaptic boutons rather than selec-
tively targeting the presynaptic active zone.
To explore the dynamics of interaction between synapses and
microglia, we developed a time-lapse fluorescence imaging
method in brain explant cultures (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures are known to undergo
key developmental steps similar to those observed in vivo,
including synapse maturation28–31, and have been previously

 used to study ramified microglia function32. As shown previously,
microglia initially respond to culturing by retracting their
processes and assuming an activated phenotype33 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3b). Following 1 week in culture, however, microglia
morphology resembles that found in vivo34 (Supplementary
Fig. 3b, c). Time-lapse imaging of hippocampal cultures was
performed using light sheet fluorescence microscopy, in order to
minimize light toxicity common to point-source beam scanning
microscopes and to allow for the visualization of multiple
fluorophores across very large fields of view (up to 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.2
mm) at relatively high frame rates (up to 1 frame/45 s) for
protracted periods (up to 3 h). To validate the technique and
determine whether microglia in hippocampal explants showed in
vivo-like physiology, we quantified the number and speed of
process extension and retraction events (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e
and Supplementary Movie 4). No significant difference was

average of 26 extension and 21 retraction events per cell per

 engulfment of presynaptic material (Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary
Movie 5). Surprisingly, presynaptic engulfment events (n = 11 from
8 microglia analyzed) were rapid, frequently occurring in < 3 min
(Fig. 4c), raising the possibility that some events occurring within
our frame rate (1 frame/90 s) went unnoticed. Notably, even in
those cases where microglia were seen to eliminate most of the
synaptic bouton (2/11 events), presynaptic material remained at the
initial site, confirming that microglia engage in partial elimination,
or trogocytosis, of presynaptic boutons.
Trogocytosis does not require CR3 signaling. The complement
system has been shown to be required for the engulfment of
apoptotic cells by microglia in developing hippocampus35, for the
efficient pruning of synapses during retinothalamic develop-
ment6,9,36, and for the loss of synaptic structures during neurode-
generation and aging37–40. We therefore tested whether microglia
trogocytosis of presynaptic elements was compromised in mice
lacking the complement receptor CR3, an essential component of the
complement signaling pathway expressed on microglia. Using the

deficit in microglia trogocytosis in KO when compared with wild-
type (WT) slices (2.3 ± 0.7 vs 1.5 ± 0.6 trogocytosis events/cell for 3 h,
respectively; p = 0.37, t-test; six and eight cells analyzed from three
cultures, Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Movie 6). There was also no
difference in the latency of elimination (WT: 6.0 ± 1.6, KO: 3.9 ± 1.1,
p = 0.28, t-test; Fig. 5d) or in the number of iRFP inclusions found in
microglia soma (WT: 2.6 ± 0.4, KO: 2.2 ± 0.6 min, p = 0.51, t-test;
Fig. 5e). These data suggest that the complement signaling pathway is
not required for microglial trogocytosis of presynaptic elements.

whether microglia might indirectly induce the elimination of

 trogocytosis, we investigated microglia interactions with the
postsynaptic compartment by time-lapse imaging in organotypic
cultures. Putative contacts between microglia processes and
spines were identified and analyzed over time (Fig. 6a).
Microglia–spine contacts were brief (4.2 ± 0.85 min) and micro-
glia frequently re-contacted the same spine, suggesting that the
contacts were non-random. Ten percent of microglia-contacted
spines (3/31) disappeared during the imaging session (Fig. 6b),
and 13% both appeared and disappeared (4/31), and were clas-
sified as transient spines. However, none of these spines were in
contact with microglia at the time of disappearance, arguing for a
microglia-independent spine elimination process. Importantly,
the frequency of disappearance of spines that had been contacted
during the imaging session by microglia was not different from
that of nearby (< 4 μm away), non-contacted spines (10% vs 11%,
respectively, n = 28; Fig. 6c). Transient spines, on the other hand,
were found exclusively among contacted spines when compared
with nearby, non-contacted spines (13% vs. 0%). Closer, high-
resolution inspection of these microglia-transient spine contact
events revealed that these spines formed from filopodia that
appeared at the microglia contact point or in proximity to the
dendritic shaft (4/31; Fig. 6a, d, i and Supplementary Movie 7)
similar to a phenomenon recently observed in the mouse cortex
using in vivo imaging15. Intriguingly, 39% (13/31) of the persis-
tent, mature spines contacted by microglia formed a filopodium
protruding from the head (spine head filopodia) and extending
toward the microglia process (Fig. 6a, e, i and Supplementary
movie 8), thus making spines a preferential substrate for
microglia-induced filopodia compared to dendritic shaft (13 spine
head filopodia vs. 4 shaft filopodia). Occasionally, we noted
stretching of the entire spine during microglial contact, suggest-
ing that the microglia process was able to induce profound
changes in spine morphology (2/31; Fig. 6a, f, i). Systematic,
morphometric analysis of microglia–spine contact events across
the imaging session was used to perform a cross-correlation
analysis that revealed a significant increase in spine length that
peaked just after microglia contact (n = 13 spines analyzed,

 microglia process movement direction confirmed that filopodia
extended toward the microglia process, and varied in length from
0.4 to 3.1 µm with an average of 1.5 µm (n = 21 spine head filo-
podia formations analyzed, Fig. 6h). Notably, spine head filopodia
were rarely found on nearby, non-contacted spines (7% on non-
contacted spines vs 39% on contacted spines, n = 28 and
31 spines analyzed, respectively; Fig. 6i).
Spine head filopodia have been shown to contribute to the
formation of new spine-bouton contacts41 and proposed to be a
mechanism for the movement, or “switching,” of spines from one
bouton to another, possibly in response to changing synaptic
activity or plasticity41,42. Although our approach did not allow for
a systematic assessment of such switching events, we did find that
27% (5/21) of microglia-induced spine head filopodia were
associated with spine head relocation, as identified by the
displacement of the head from its original site to the tip of the
filopodia (Fig. 7a). Interestingly, spine head filopodia that
underwent relocation showed a tendency for longer lifetimes
than those that did not (27 vs 12 min, n = 5 and 16, respectively;
Fig. 7b), suggesting that this relocation might be associated with
stabilizing synapse formation. This hypothesis was supported by
two cases in which we were able to simultaneously image GFP +
spines and iRFP + presynaptic boutons, and we could confirm
that the induced spine head filopodia made stable contact with a
different, neighboring bouton (Fig. 7c, d).
A systematic analysis of our FIB-SEM datasets allowed us to
confirm the frequent presence of microglia-associated spine head
filopodia in fixed brain tissue and rule out that this phenomenon
was an artifact of the organotypic culture. Remarkably, over 28% (5/
18) of mature, PSD-containing spines found in contact with
microglia processes presented a filopodium extending toward
microglia. In one particularly striking case (Fig. 7e), a microglial
end process contacting a presynaptic bouton was found surrounded
by converging filopodia (15 filopodia originating from 9 dendrites;
Fig. 7f). Consistent with our live-imaging data, the majority (9/15)
were spine head filopodia originating from mature, PSD-containing
spines (Fig. 7h), whereas the rest were filopodia extending from
dendritic shaft structures (6/15; Fig. 7g). Intriguingly, a few of these
spine head filopodia extended alongside the microglia-contacted
presynaptic bouton (Fig. 7i) and one appeared to initiate a synapse
as indicated by the presence of a PSD but no clustering of
presynaptic vesicles, resulting in the formation of a multiple-
synapse bouton (MSB, Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 5). We also
noted that 12/15 of the converging filopodia shared their dendrite of
origin, suggesting that they could facilitate the formation of class I
MSBs in which one bouton synapses with several spines originating
from a common neuron, a form of synaptic contact that conveys
increased efficacy43. MSB1s have previously been shown to depend
on microglia–neuron signaling and contribute to the strengthening
of developing hippocampal circuits and the establishment of normal
brain connectivity11. Together, these data suggest that microglia are
broadly involved in structural synaptic plasticity and circuit
maturation, both by the trogocytosis of presynaptic boutons and
axons, as well as by the induction of filopodia from postsynaptic
sites (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Discussion
Our findings confirm the hypothesis that microglia directly engulf
and eliminate synaptic material. However, contrary to previous
assumptions, we found no evidence for the phagocytosis of entire
synapses. Instead, we observed microglia trogocytosis—or nibbling
—of synaptic structures. Importantly, microglia trogocytosis was
restricted to presynaptic boutons and axons, with no evidence for
elimination of postsynaptic material. Intriguingly, microglia con-
tacts at postsynaptic sites frequently elicited transient filopodia,
most of which originated from mature spines. These data support
the current hypothesis that microglia can “eat” synaptic material,
but point to a more nuanced role for microglia in synapse remo-
deling that may explain the diverse synaptic alterations observed
following the disruption of microglial function.
Our observation of microglia engulfment of presynaptic
material is consistent with published reports showing the locali-
zation of material deriving from axonal projections inside
microglia9. To the best of our knowledge, our data are the first
time-lapse images to directly demonstrate the active engulfment
of synaptic material by microglia. Our extensive characterization
of microglial content from three-dimensional (3D) FIB-SEM
reconstructions validate previous data from single section elec-
tron microscopy that showed putative double-membrane inclu-
sions of presynaptic material in microglia9. Moreover, our
observation of intermediates such as invaginations, pinching of
presynaptic boutons and axons, and complete inclusions sheds
light on the cellular mechanism involved. Synapses were pre-
viously proposed to be eliminated by microglia through phago-
cytosis, a process traditionally defined as the cellular uptake of
particles over 0.5 µm in size44. Instead, our data show that only
small fragments (250 nm average diameter, Fig. 3) of the pre-
synaptic compartment are engulfed by microglia. This partial
elimination, or trogocytosis (from the Greek trogo: to nibble) has
been previously described in immune and amoeboid cells18,26,27
that ingest small parts (< 1 µm) of their targets within a few
minutes, a timeframe compatible with our observations (Fig. 4).
Although phagocytosis and trogocytosis likely share common
endocytic machinery, they potentially differ in their uptake path-
ways. In fact, we found that CR3, a microglia-expressed comple-
ment receptor involved in phagocytosis and previously proposed to
mediate synapse elimination in the retinogeniculate pathway9, is
not necessary for the trogocytosis of presynaptic structures. How-
ever, other components of the complement pathway could be
involved and it is possible that different brain regions recruit dif-
ferent pruning pathways. One possible candidate “eat me” signal is
phosphatidylserine (PS), a phospholipid known to elicit engulfment
by macrophages following its exposure on the outer leaflet of the
cell membrane45 and recently suggested to mediate trogocytosis27.
The known capacity of PS to laterally diffuse within the membrane
could explain our observation that microglia indiscriminately tro-
gocytose presynaptic boutons and axonal shafts. It should also be
noted that the elimination of presynaptic material does not
necessarily imply elimination of functional synaptic structures, and
our observation that microglia trogocytosed primarily axonal shafts
rather than boutons suggests that this process may be relatively
nonspecific. Presynaptic trogocytosis may be aimed at an overall
reduction in axonal processes or, alternatively, it may mediate a
remodeling of axons by eliminating, e.g., specific surface-associated
factors that inhibit presynaptic site formation.
Second, several data argue against a major role for microglia in
the elimination of postsynaptic material in the developing hip-
pocampus, including the following: (1) absence of phagocytosis/
trogocytosis of postsynaptic material by microglia, as assessed by
confocal microscopy in fixed brain sections (Figs. 1–2), (2) the
presence of frequent and intimate partial inclusion events
(“pinched” material) of exclusively presynaptic boutons and
axons as assessed by 3D volume EM (Fig. 3), and (3) intake of
presynaptic (Fig. 4) but not postsynaptic (Fig. 6) material by
microglia as assessed by time-lapse fluorescence imaging. The fact
that microglia do not eliminate postsynaptic structures in the
developing hippocampus has implications for the interpretation
of previous data in the field. For example, we and others have
published data showing localization of postsynaptic proteins
inside microglia8,14,20,46. In our current confocal microscopy
data, we observed the intimate encapsulation of spines by

 microglia, a phenomenon that likely explains the previously
described colocalization of immunolabeled postsynaptic proteins
with microglia. However, using cytoplasmic labeling we noted
that all contacted spines were still attached to the dendritic shaft
via a spine neck and our 3D FIB-SEM reconstructions did not
support the phagocytic engulfment of postsynaptic material by
microglia. Previous evidence for the localization of postsynaptic
material inside microglia by single-section electron microscopy,
either by contrast agent-enhanced visualization of PSD-like
material20 or its immunodetection8, are potentially more diffi-
cult to counter, but might reflect the limitations inherent to two-
dimensional electron microscopy. In addition, it should be noted
that PSD95 has been found to be expressed by microglia47 (but
see ref. 48), and that immunocolocalization of synaptic proteins
with microglia might derive from non-phagocytic membrane
exchange49. Although it remains possible that elimination of
postsynaptic material by microglia might occur in other brain
regions, at other developmental stages, or alternatively at such a low
frequency that it went unnoticed in our experiments, our data argue
that immunofluorescent colocalization of postsynaptic proteins and
microglia, even by super-resolution methods (e.g., stimulated-
emission depletion), should be interpreted with caution.
Lastly, a major observation from our time-lapse imaging data
was the induction of transient filopodia following microglia
contacts. This observation is in line with a recent in vivo imaging
study reporting that microglia contacts can induce local calcium
transients in dendritic shafts followed by filopodia formation15. It
is also consistent with a report showing that microglia participate
in the learning-dependent formation of functional synapses via
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor
TrkB16. Together, these observations argue that filopodia induc-
tion by microglia may be a widespread phenomenon and a pos-
sible trigger mechanism for the formation of functional synapses.
Intriguingly, we observed that the majority of filopodia induced
by microglia originate from mature spine heads (Fig. 6), a finding
confirmed in our electron microscopy datasets. Protrusions from
spine heads have been previously described in the hippo-
campus41,50–55, in the visual cortex56, and in the olfactory bulb42,
where they have been referred to as spinules, spine head pro-
trusions, or spine head filopodia, depending on the length of the
extension measured. Spine-emerging spinules54 were considered
trans-endocytic and surrounded either by axonal material or
astrocytes, the later of which might relate to astrocyte-mediated
synaptic pruning described in the thalamic system57. On the
other hand, spine head filopodia or protrusions were found in the
extracellular space between cells, and associated with microtubule
invasion of the spine58 and synaptopodin-dependent actin
bundling51. The mechanism for spine head filopodia induction by
microglia in our preparations is not clear, but might involve the
application of tension to “pull” the filopodia, a loosening up of the
extracellular matrix by microglia invasion, or a release of che-
motactic factors. Intriguingly, BDNF has been shown to induce
spine head filopodia42, as well as synapse formation upon
expression by microglia16, suggesting a role for this factor in
microglia-dependent circuit remodeling during development.
Our time-lapse imaging study revealed that microglia-induced
spine head filopodia formation was frequently followed by a relo-
cation of the spine head to the tip of the filopodium and occa-
sionally resulted in a new bouton contact (Fig. 7). These
observations confirm that spine head filopodia induction might
trigger spine switching and potentially the replacement of ineffi-
cient with more efficient synapses41,42,53. Spine head filopodia can
be induced by neurotransmitter such as acetylcholine53 and glu-
tamate via the activation of AMPA receptors41,42,55. Moderate, but
not high, levels of glutamate induce spine head filopodia forma-
tion41,52, opening the possibility that microglia-mediated spine
head switching may be moderated by glutamatergic neuro-
transmission and presynaptic release probability, a hypothesis
supported by observation that blockade of evoked neurotransmitter
release by the application of tetrodotoxin increased the incidence of
spine head filopodia41. Spine switching has the potential to trans-
form single-synapse boutons into MSBs41,59 and if these occur on
spines emerging from the same dendrite they might generate so
called class I MSBs, a subclass of excitatory connections that
increase during postnatal development and mediate the strength-
ening of excitatory connectivity11,43,50. Further evidence to support
a role for microglia-induced spine head filopodia in MSB formation
comes from our anecdotal observation of a dozen spine head
filopodia converging toward a single microglia process in intimate
contact with a presynaptic bouton on which they formed a nascent
MSB (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Although caution must be
exercised when extrapolating such anecdotal electron microscopy
data, the architecture of this particular case where most of the
filopodia shared their dendrite of origin supports the hypothesis
that microglia might promote the formation of class I MSBs. Such a
hypothesis is consistent with previous observations that mice
lacking the microglia–neuron signaling factor fractalkine (Cx3cl1)
are associated with a deficiency in class I MSBs and impaired
maturation of functional circuit connectivity11. Overall, our data
argue that the prevailing view of microglia as phagocytic cells
eliminating synapses during neural circuit development may be
overly simplified. Instead, they suggest a broad role for microglia in
synaptic remodeling via the trogocytosis of axonal structures, and
the induction and reorganization of postsynaptic sites, so as to
achieve an appropriate maturation of circuits.
Materials and methods
Animals. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from local EMBL colonies. Thy1::EGFP;
Cx3cr1::CreER; RC::LSL-tdTomato triple transgenic mice were obtained by crossing
Thy1::EGFP-M21 (Jackson Laboratory stock 007788) with Cx3cr1::creER-YFP16
(Jackson Laboratory stock 021160) and Rosa26-CAG::loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato-
WPRE22 (Jackson Laboratory stock 007905). Mice were used in homozygous state
for Thy1::EGFP and in heterozygous state for Cx3cr1::CreER and RC::LSL-tdTo-
mato. Cre-mediated recombination was induced by a single injection of 98% Z-
isomers hydroxy-tamoxifen diluted in corn oil at 10 mg/mL (Sigma, 1 mg injected
per 20 g of mouse weight) at P10. Residual yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
expression in microglia yielded a faint signal in GFP channel that was thresholded
out in all analysis. For CR3-KO experiments, triple transgenic mice were addi-
tionally crossed with CD11b-deficient mice60 (Jackson Laboratory stock 003991)
and used in homozygous state. Cx3cr1::GFP mice61 (Jackson Laboratory stock
005582) were used in heterozygous state. All mice were on a C57BL/6J congenic
background. Mice were bred, genotyped, and tested at EMBL following protocols
approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.
Analysis of microglia phagocytic capacity. C57BL/6J WT mice were anesthetized
intraperitoneally with 2.5% Avertin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis) and perfused trans-
cardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at P8, P15, P28, and P40. Brains were
removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight (ON) at 4 °C. Coronal 50 µm sections
were cut on a vibratom (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and blocked in 20%
normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h
at room temperature. CD68 and Iba1 were immunodetected by ON incubation at 4 °
C with primary antibodies (rat anti-CD68 1:500, Serotec; rabbit anti-Iba1 1:200,
Wako) followed by secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit A647 and goat anti-rat
A546, 1:400, Life Technologies) incubation in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X100 and 5%
goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were imaged on a TCS SP5 reso-
nant scanner confocal microscope (TCS Leica Microsystems, Mannheim) with a ×
63/1.4 oil-immersion objective at 48 nm lateral pixel size with an axial step of 130 nm.
Iba1-positive microglia were 3D reconstructed using local contrast on Imaris software
and CD68 signal intensity was measured in each individual reconstructed cell. CD68
expression pattern observed in Iba1-labeled microglia was confirmed in genetically
labeled microglia (Cx3cr1::CreER; RC::LSL-tdTomato).
Characterization of microglia–spine interactions. Brain tissue was collected at
P15 as previously described. Sections were permeabilized with PBS and 0.5% Triton
X-100 for 30 min, and blocked with PBS, 0.3% Triton, and 5% goat serum for 30 min
at room temperature. CD68 was immunodetected by ON incubation at 4 °C with
primary antibodies (rat anti-CD68 1:500, Serotec) followed by secondary antibodies
(goat anti-rat A647, 1:600, Life Technologies) incubation in PBS with 0.3% Triton
and 10% goat serum at 4 °C ON. Secondary dendrites of bright GFP + neurons were

 imaged in medial stratum radiatum of CA1 using Leica SP5 confocal resonant
scanner microscope with a × 63/1.4 oil-immersion objective, at a lateral pixel size of
40 nm and an axial step of 130 nm. Images were deconvolved using Huygens software
(40 iterations, 0.1 of quality change, theoretical point spread function) and sharpened
using Image J software (NIH). Interactions were determined after 3D visualization in
Imaris as follows: appositions were considered when 20–50% of the spine head
surface was covered by microglia, encapsulation when > 70% was covered.
Imaging microglia–spine interactions for CLEM. Mice were perfused transcar-
dially with PBS and fixed with 2% (w/v) PFA, 2.5% (w/v) Glutaraldehyde (TAAB)
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) at P15. After perfusion brains were dissected and
postfixed in 4% PFA in PB 0.1 M ON at 4 °C. Subsequently, 60 µm-thick vibratome
(Leica Microsystems) coronal sections were cut and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) stained. Hippocampal areas were trimmed and mounted with 1% Low
Melting Agarose (Sigma) in PB 0.1 M on glass-bottom dishes with alpha numeric
grid (Ibidi). ROIs containing microglia–spine interactions were imaged at high
magnification with TCS SP5 resonant scanner confocal microscope with a × 63/1.2
water-immersion objective, at a pixel size of 48 nm and a step size of 300 nm. Low-
magnification stacks containing the ROI were acquired in bright field, GFP, RFP,
and DAPI channels to visualize neurons and microglia together with fiducial
capillaries and cell nuclei. A UV-diode laser operating at 405 nm, an Argon laser at
488 nm, and a diode-pumped solid-state laser at 561 nm were used as excitation
sources. Subsequent to confocal imaging, the grid-glass bottom was separated from
the plastic dish and placed onto Laser capture system microdissector microscope
(Leica LMD7000) for laser etching of the ROI. The etched sections were retrieved
and stored in 4% PFA in PB 0.1 M at 4 °C. Apposition/encapsulation events in
Fig. 2 derive from four ROIs containing four neurons from a total of two animals.
Microglial content analysis in Fig. 3, on the other hand, derives from seven ROIs
containing end processes from eight microglia from a total of four animals.
Sample preparation for FIB-SEM. The sections were processed as described in
Maco et al.24. Briefly, the sections previously imaged on confocal were washed in
cold sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.4, postfixed with 1% OsO4/1.5%
potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h on ice, followed by a second step of 1 h in 1% OsO4
in sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.4 on ice. Samples were then rinsed care-
fully in water and stained “en block” with 1% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate
ON at 4 °C, dehydrated with raising concentration of ethanol and infiltrated in
propylene oxide/Durcupan mixture with increasing concentration of resin. Dur-
cupan embedding was carried out in a flat orientation within a sandwich of
ACLAR® 33 C Films (Electron Microscopy Science) for 72 h at 60 °C. Sections were
washed in cold sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.4, postfixed with 2% OsO4/
1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h on ice, followed by a step with thiocarbohy-
drazide for 20 min at room temperature and then a second step of 30 min in 2%
aqueous OsO4 on ice. Samples were then rinsed carefully in water and stained “en
block” first with 1% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate ON at 4 °C and then with
lead aspartate at 60 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, sections were dehydrated with
increasing concentration acetone and infiltrated in Durcupan resin ON followed by
2 h embedding step with fresh resin. As a pilote experiment, one of the samples
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Fig. 2) was processed using a slightly modified protocol based
on the application of heavy metal fixatives, stains, and mordanting agents62 pro-
ducing slightly more contrast compared with the other samples.
Flat embedded samples were then trimmed to about 1 mm width to fit on the
pin for microscopic X-ray computed tomography (MicroCT). Samples were
attached to the pin with either double sided tape or dental wax and mounted into
the Brukker Skyscan 1272 for microCT imaging. Data were acquired over 180° at a
pixel resolution of 1.5–2 µm. Karreman et al.25 thoroughly details the process of
how the MicroCT data enable the correlation of fluorescent imaging to 3D electron
microscopy of voluminous samples. In this experiment, MicroCT revealed laser
etched markings performed at the microdissector microscope, and vasculature.
This vasculature, which could also be seen by negative contrast in confocal datasets,
acted as fiducial features to register the various microscopy modalities (MicroCT,
and low- and high-magnification confocal data). Using Amira software (FEI
Company), 3D models were generated from these microscopy modalities by
thresholding and manual segmentation. These volumes could then be registered
together by a manual fit to reveal the position of the event visualized by fluorescent
confocal microscopy despite the loss of fluorescence during processing for EM. The
registered volumes also allowed precise trimming of the sample for FIB-SEM,
where it is necessary for the ROI to be at the surface of the sample or within 5 µm
(for trimming procedure see Karreman et al.25). Each sample was trimmed
according to the available features that would assist with later steps of FIB-SEM
acquisition, such as to position the platinum deposition on the trimmed sample
surface over the ROI and to position the imaging area on the cross-section face. For
example, the laser markings that were made on one surface of the brain slice gave
us only the ROI position in x but not over the thickness of 60 µm brain slice. For
this axis, patterns made by the distribution of the vasculature were necessary to
pin-point the position of the protective platinum coat over the ROI.
FIB-SEM imaging. Registered and trimmed samples were then mounted onto the
edge of an SEM stub (Agar Scientific) with silver conductive epoxy (CircuitWorks)
with the trimmed surface facing up so that it will be perpendicular to the focused ion
beam (FIB). The sample was then sputter coated with gold (180 s at 30 mA) in a
Quorum Q150RS coater before being placed in the Zeiss Crossbeam 540 focused ion
beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). Once the ROI was located in the
sample, Atlas3D software (Fibics Inc. and Zeiss) was used to perform sample pre-
paration and 3D acquisitions. First, a platinum protective coat of 20 × 20 µm was
deposited with 1.5 nA FIB current. The rough trench was then milled to expose the
imaging cross-section with 15 nA FIB current, followed with a polish at 7 nA. Now
that the imaging cross-section was exposed, the features visible here including vessels
and nuclei were used to correlate with the registered 3D volumes in Amira and
confirm the current position relative to the ROI. During the acquisition, lower
resolution keyframes with a large field of view (FOV) from 40 × 40 to 70 × 70 µm
were acquired, in order to have this broader context of the sample. Provided there
were enough features close to the ROI, this information helped to position the high-
resolution imaging FOV (typically 10 × 10 µm). The 3D acquisition milling was done
with 3 nA FIB current. For SEM imaging, the beam was operated at 1.5 kV/700 pA in
analytic mode using the EsB detector (1.1 kV collector voltage) at a dwell time from 6
to 8 µs with no line averaging over a pixel size of 5 × 5 nm and slice thickness 8 nm.
For the pilot acquisition run at Zeiss, Oberkochen, a large volume was first acquired
at low magnification without prior MicroCT, while correlating with the confocal
dataset to detect the ROI, which was subsequently imaged at 5 nm isotropic pixel size.
FIB-SEM stack segmentation and correlation. A single stack file containing
individual FIB images was aligned on ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)
with the help of the linear stack registration plugin (SIFT). Grayscale look up table
was inverted and the stack was binned 2 × in both lateral and axial planes.
Microglia and dendrites of interest were located based on their xyz coordinates
within the ROI and from fiducials correlated between electron and confocal
microscopy datasets. The segmentation was carried out manually using iMOD
software (http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) and 3D model was generated and
matched to the confocal dataset to confirm perfect correlation. Thy1::EGFP neuron
and microglia were identified upon correlation of light and electron microscopy
datasets. Complete presynaptic bouton inclusions were identified by the presence of
40 nm vesicles typical of presynaptic machinery. Partial presynaptic bouton and
axonal material inclusions were identified after 3D reconstruction of the belonging
axon, based on the presence of presynaptic machinery: clusters of 40 nm pre-
synaptic vesicles and apposition on a PSD. Blender software (https://www.blender.
org/) was used to generate animation of the FIB-SEM dataset segmentation and 3D
reconstruction.
Preparation of hippocampal slice culture. Organotypic hippocampal slice cul-
tures were prepared using the air/medium interface method63. Briefly, mice were
decapitated at P4 and hippocampi were dissected out in cold dissecting medium
(Hank’s buffered salt solution 1 × (Gibco), penicillin/streptomycin 1 ×, HEPES
(Gibco) 15 mM, glucose (Sigma) 0.5%)). Transverse sections of 300 µm thickness
were cut using a tissue chopper. Slices were laid on culture-inserts (Millipore) in
pre-warmed six-well plates containing 1.2 mL of maintaining medium (minimal
essential medium (MEM) 0.5 × (Gibco), Basal Medium Eagle 25%, horse serum
25%, penicillin/streptomycin 1 × , GlutaMAX 2 mM, glucose 0.65%, sodium
bicarbonate 7.5%, ddH2O qsp). Medium was replaced after 24 h and then every
2 days. For culture of Thy1::EGFP; Cx3cr1::CreER; RC::LSL-tdTomato brain slices,
98% Z isomers-OHT was added to the maintaining medium at 0.1 µM during the
first 24 h. After preparation, cultures were maintained for up to 21 days in vitro
(DIV21) in incubator at 35 °C and 5% CO2. The morphology of microglia was
inspected in Cx3cr1::GFP slices at the indicated time-points upon fixation in PFA
4% for 1 h at room temperature, PBS-washed, mounted with mowiol, and imaged
on a Leica SP5 confocal resonant scanner microscope with a 63 × /1.4 oil-
immersion objective.
Light sheet live imaging. Live imaging of microglia and synapses in hippocampal
slice cultures (DIV10–19) was performed using a Z1 light sheet microscope (Zeiss).
The imaging chamber was set at 35 °C and 5% CO2, and filled with imaging
medium (MEM without phenol red 0.5 × , horse serum 25%, penicillin/strepto-
mycin 1 × , GlutaMAX 2 mM, glucose 0.65%, sodium bicarbonate 7.5%, ddH2O
qsp) 2 h before the imaging session, to allow the system to equilibrate and the
medium to reach pH7. Low melting point agarose was prepared at 2% with ima-
ging medium and incubated at 35 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min, for reaching proper
pH. The membrane of the Millipore insert containing the slice of interest was cut
around the slice and laid onto the equilibrated liquid agarose before polymerization
at 4 °C for 1 min. Although it is very unlikely that the tissue temperature dropped
to this temperature, it has been reported that following incubation at 4 °C for
longer periods of time (> 30 min) microglia soma enlarged, but recovered normal
morphology within 2 h64. Therefore, we waited 2 h for the slice to recover before
imaging and carried out control experiments showing that microglia motility
(Supplementary Fig. 3) was similar to that found by two-photon imaging in vivo.
The slice mounted on agarose was then placed in incubation at 35 °C and 5% CO2
for further 30 min. The polymerized agarose containing the slice was then inserted
into a FEP tube adapted on a glass capillary and the slice was gently pushed to be
exposed 1 mm outside the FEP tube. The capillary was then placed on the
microscope holder and the slice was immersed in the imaging medium of the
chamber 1 h before imaging for stabilization. For all imaging sessions, microglia

 and neurons were selected for their brightness and position in the stratum radia-
tum of CA1, 2 to 30 µm from the slice surface. Imaging was performed for 2–3 h
using a 60 × /NA1 water-immersion objective, with a lateral pixel size of 130 nm
and an axial step of 480 nm. For microglia–postsynaptic structures interactions (2-
colors imaging), 488 and 561 lasers were used for simultaneous acquisition of GFP
and tdTomato signal using 505–545 and 575–615 band-pass filters on two cameras,
at a rate of one frame/45–60 s. For microglia-pre/postsynaptic structures interac-
tions (3-colors imaging), two channels were fast switching between frames: 488 and
561 lasers were used for simultaneous acquisition of GFP and tdTomato signal
using a 505–545 band-pass filter and a 585 long-pass filter, and iRFP was imaged
using a 638 laser line and the 585 long-pass filter, at a rate of 1 frame/90 s. The
emission spectra of tdTomato and iRFP overlap significantly and are both effi-
ciently detected in the presence of the 585 nm long-pass filter. However, we were
able to image them separately, because their excitation spectra are distinct, with the
561 nm laser exciting primarily tdTomato (< 20% iRFP peak excitation) and the
638 nm laser exciting exclusively iRFP. This allowed us to image iRFP and tdTo-
mato separately by alternating exposure to 561 and 638 nm light sources with a
fixed 585 nm long-pass filter detection system. Notably, no detectable iRFP signal
was seen during 561 nm illumination, most likely to be because iRFP is significantly
more dim than tdTomato. All datasets were deconvolved using Zen software, and
corrected for drifts on Image J using a script created by Albert Cardona and Robert
Bryson-Richardson65, and modified by Cristian Tischer (EMBL Heidelberg).
Analysis of microglia motility. TdTomato signal intensity was measured in
microglial processes and normalized across all datasets. Noise was measured out-
side microglia, and removed by thresholding to the measured value + 40%. Motility
was assessed by analyzing protrusions over 1 min interval. Extending and retracting
protrusions were counted and measured at 0, 60, and 120 min after the beginning
of the session to confirm imaging.
Labeling of presynaptic structures. AAV-rSyn::iRFP670 virus was generated by
cloning AAV vector serotype 2 ITRs with a rat Synapsin promoter (a gift from
Hirai and colleagues66), a iRFP670 coding sequence (a gift from Shcherbakova and
Verkhusha67, Addgene plasmid 45457), WPRE, and human growth hormone
polyA sequence. Viral production and purification was performed according to
McClure et al.68 with minor modifications. Briefly, 15 × 15 cm dishes of
HEK293T cells were transfected with the pAAV-rSyn::iRFP670 plasmid, together
with pAAV1, pAAV2, and the helper plasmid pFdelta6 using PEI (Sigma, 408727).
Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were collected and lysed according to
the protocol and the virus containing cell lysate was loaded onto HiTrap Heparin
columns (GE Biosciences 17-0406-01). After a series of washes, the virus was eluted
from the heparin column to a final concentration of 450 mM NaCl. Finally, the
virus was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore
UFC910024) and semi-quantitative titering of viral particles was executed by
Coomassie staining versus standards. CA3 neurons of hippocampal slices were
infected with AAV-rSyn::iRFP670 the day following the preparation of the culture,
by a local injection of 0.1 µL of virus in the pyramidal layer of CA3 using a glass
capillary under a stereomicroscope. Expression of iRFP was observed in CA3
neurons exclusively as early as 5 days post infection, and expression in CA3-CA1
Schaffer collaterals reached satisfactory expression level 10 days after infection.
Analysis of microglia–presynaptic compartment interactions. Contacts between
microglia and boutons were detected by scouring iRFP + axons in three dimensions
for the entire duration of the imaging session. Elimination events were defined as
clear engulfment of iRFP + material by microglia from an iRFP + bouton. Latency
before engulfment was measured as the time of contact between microglia and the
bouton before any iRFP + material was seen internalized. Inclusions were defined as
iRFP + structures within microglia for which the origin could not be defined, as they
were present from the beginning of the imaging session.
Analysis of microglia–postsynaptic compartment interactions. Contacts
between microglia and the postsynaptic compartment were detected by scouring
dendritic shafts of GFP + neurons in three-dimensions for the entire duration of the
imaging session. All z-planes containing the contacted spine over time were axially
projected. GFP intensity was measured in the dendritic shaft and normalized across
all the datasets. GFP signal noise and residual microglial YFP signal were measured in
microglial processes, and thresholded out to the measured value + 40%. For all spines
that were seen to be contacted at least once by microglia, we measured the spine
length, the size of the head, and the extent of contact between the spine and microglia
for each timepoint of the entire imaging session. The length of the spine was mea-
sured from the dendritic shaft to the tip of the spine head, the change in head size was
measured as variation in GFP signal at the spine head, and the extent of contact was
measured as the percentage of GFP signal at the spine head colocalizing with
tdTomato signal. We then performed cross-correlation analysis over time of the
extent of contact, with the spine length variation (correlation with the head size not
shown) using bootstrap resampling on MATLAB.
Statistical analysis. All data are represented as mean ± SEM. To determine sta-
tistical significance, data distribution was first tested for variance and normality,
and the corresponding t-test (parametric or non-parametric) was performed using
the Graphpad Prism software. For multiple group analysis (motility analysis over
time) two-way ANOVA was performed using Graphpad Prism software. Cross-
correlation analysis was made using MATLAB software.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors.
