Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex disease characterized by emotional, physical and
cognitive symptoms. We explored the efficacy of vortioxetine versus placebo on outcomes of cognition, func-
tioning and mood symptoms in working patients with depression, using paroxetine as an active reference.
Methods: Gainfully employed patients (18–65 years, N = 152) with MDD were randomized 1:1:1 to 8 weeks’
double-blind, parallel treatment either with vortioxetine (10 mg/day) or paroxetine (20 mg/day), or with pla-
cebo. The primary efficacy measure was the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), analyzed using a mixed
model for repeated measurements, and the key secondary efficacy measure was the University of San Diego
Performance-based Skills Assessment – Brief (UPSA-B), analyzed using analysis of covariance (last observation
carried forward).
Results: At week 8, DSST and UPSA-B performance had improved relative to baseline in all treatment groups,
with no statistically significant differences between treatment groups. While improvements in mood were
comparable for vortioxetine and paroxetine, numerical improvements in cognitive performance (DSST) were
larger with vortioxetine. Vortioxetine significantly improved overall cognitive performance and clinician-rated
functioning relative to placebo. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, with nausea being the
most common adverse event for vortioxetine.
Limitations: Small sample sizes implied limited statistical power.
Conclusion: This explorative study showed no significant differences versus placebo in DSST or UPSA-B per-
formance at week 8. However, secondary results support vortioxetine as an effective and well-tolerated anti-
depressant, supporting an added benefit for cognition and functioning, which could have particular therapeutic
relevance for the working patient population.
1. Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a burdensome condition com-
prising symptoms within emotional, physical and cognitive domains.
The point prevalence of MDD is 1.8–3.2% for men and 2.0–9.3% for
women (Puri et al., 2014), and it is a leading cause of disability
worldwide (Kessler and Bromet, 2013). In addition to negatively im-
pacting patients’ quality of life (Ishak et al., 2013), the socioeconomic
burden associated with depression is substantial (Birnbaum et al., 2010;
Olesen et al., 2012), driven primarily by workplace productivity losses
among depressed individuals of working age (Gasse et al., 2013; Krol
et al., 2011; Thomas and Morris, 2003). A previous study thus found
that approximately half of the indirect costs of managing depression
(constituting approximately 80% of total costs) were associated with
loss of productivity and unemployment (Ho et al., 2013).

T
 symptoms or objectively assessed cognitive performance is highly pre-
valent in depressed patients (Papakostas, 2014) and often persists be-
yond the depressive episode (Hasselbalch et al., 2011). This typically
affects the ability to concentrate, remember, plan and make decisions
(Lee et al., 2012), and may thus directly compromise work performance
(Maruff and Jaeger, 2016). Individual symptoms of depressive disorder
such as insomnia and recurrent negative thoughts may worsen cogni-
tive impairment (Ling et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2014).
Further, emerging evidence suggests that persistently impaired
cognitive performance may play a key role in the inability for func-
tional recovery for many patients (Baune and Air, 2016; Jaeger et al.,
2006). The notion that cognitive dysfunction mediates patient func-
tioning in depression (Lam et al., 2014; McIntyre et al., 2013; Rock
et al., 2014) is supported by evidence such as the inability for depres-
sive symptomatology to fully account for poor functional outcomes
(Gupta et al., 2013; Rock et al., 2014), and the lag in improvement of
psychosocial functioning relative to clinical remission, which is often
seen among depressed patients (Kennedy et al., 2007).
A systematic analysis by Evans et al. (2014) provides a summary of
the evidence for the role of cognitive performance for psychosocial
functioning, reporting that test performance in at least one cognitive
domain was associated with a predicted functional outcome in each of
the included studies. Further, despite large variety in study designs, a
range of studies have consistently demonstrated the negative impact
that subjectively as well as objectively measured cognitive impairment
has on work productivity and occupational functioning (Clark et al.,
2016; Godard et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; McIntyre et al., 2015).
Despite this emerging evidence of the mediating role of cognitive
impairment for occupational functioning as well as for psychosocial
functioning broadly, significantly less research has focused on the long-
term functional outcome in depressed patients experiencing cognitive
impairment (Kennedy et al., 2007). Thus, the relation between cogni-
tive impairment and functional outcomes is not well described
(McIntyre et al., 2013). Improving understanding of the association
between cognitive impairments and occupational functioning, and
minimizing their negative impact on this outcome is an important
target in order to help depressed patients maintain their role as working
individuals, and thus reduce the individual and socioeconomic burden
associated with MDD.
Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant combining direct
modulation of serotonin receptor activity and inhibition of the ser-
otonin transporter as its primary mode of action (Mork et al., 2012;
Sanchez et al., 2015) by acting as a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor
antagonist, a 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, a 5-HT1A receptor ago-
nist and an inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter (Bang-Andersen et al.,
2011; Mork et al., 2012). In addition to robust antidepressant efficacy
broadly across diverse MDD populations (Baldwin et al., 2016a, 2016b;
Katona et al., 2012; Nomikos et al., 2017; Thase et al., 2016), vor-
tioxetine has demonstrated possible cognitive effects in preclinical
studies (Bang-Andersen et al., 2011; Mork et al., 2012) as well as im-
proved cognitive performance in depressed patients, as established in
three large-scale, placebo-controlled clinical studies that showed cog-
nitive improvements versus placebo of clinically relevant magnitudes
(standardized effect sizes above 0.2) among elderly (≥ 65 years of age)
(Katona
et
al.,
2012)
and
adult
MDD
patient
populations
(Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015; McIntyre et al., 2014). Further, a recent
meta-analysis, which included a broad range of antidepressants, found
that vortioxetine was the only antidepressant to improve cognitive
performance, as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, versus
placebo (Baune et al., 2017). In path analyses, such improvements of
vortioxetine on cognitive performance were largely independent of the
improvement
in
mood
symptoms
(Katona
et
al.,
2012;
Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015; McIntyre et al., 2014). Finally, post-hoc
analyses showed more pronounced effects among a subgroup of
working patients, indicating that the potential of vortioxetine to miti-
gate cognitive dysfunction and improve functional capacity in MDD
may provide additional gain for the working patient population
(McIntyre et al., 2017).
The objective of this study was to explore the effects of vortioxetine
versus placebo on cognitive performance and functional capacity, as
well as on mood symptoms in a natural working population of patients
with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode. To our knowledge,
this is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study dedicated to in-
vestigate the treatment effects on cognitive function among working
patients with MDD. Paroxetine was included as an active reference
because it is a commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitor (SSRI) with prominent anticholinergic properties and a me-
chanism of action different to that of vortioxetine.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This study (ReMind WORK) was a multi-site, randomized, parallel-
group, placebo-controlled, active-referenced clinical trial in which
working patients with MDD were randomized 1:1:1 to 8 weeks of
double-blind treatment with fixed doses of either vortioxetine 10 mg/
day, paroxetine 20 mg/day, or placebo, followed by a blinded 1-week
taper-down period for paroxetine. Patients were seen at weeks 1, 4, and
8, with a safety follow-up approximately 4 weeks after the last visit.
The study was conducted between October 2014 and February 2016
at a total of 18 sites in Estonia, Finland, Germany, and Lithuania, in
accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good
Clinical Practices guidelines and with the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients. Study protocols and amendments were approved by the
independent ethics committee of each study site. The study is registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02279966).
2.2. Patients
The study included outpatients aged 18–65 years with a primary
diagnosis
of
MDD
(DSM-IV-TR
classification
296.3×)
and
a
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score ≥ 26, with the
current depressive episode lasting ≥ 3 months. Eligible patients were
employed full or part-time (defined as ≥ 50% full-time working hours
per week) and had been in their current position for ≥ 3 months at
study entry.
Patients with current psychiatric disorders other than MDD or
physical, cognitive, or language impairment likely to compromise the
ability to perform the cognitive tests were excluded from the study, as
were patients at risk of suicide and patients who did not respond to
previous treatment with paroxetine. Patients with a baseline score of ≥
70 on the primary outcome measure, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test
(see below), were excluded to preserve assay sensitivity and avoid
ceiling performance.
2.3. Assessments and outcome variables
The primary efficacy measure was the Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST, 90 s test period) (Wechsler, 1997) a performance-based
measure of cognitive processing skills involving attention, processing
speed, and executive function, which has shown sensitivity-to-change
in MDD populations (McIntyre et al., 2016). The key secondary efficacy
measure was the University of San Diego Performance-based Skills
Assessment – Brief (UPSA-B) (Mausbach et al., 2007), a role-play based
performance test of functional capacity comprising two subscales
(Managing finances and Communication). The full-length version of the
UPSA-B has demonstrated good psychometric properties among pa-
tients with MDD (Harvey et al., 2017). Both measures were assessed at
baseline and at week 8; the DSST in addition at week 1.
Secondary efficacy assessments comprised the following cognitive

422
 performance tests obtained at baseline and at weeks 1 and 8: the Trail
Making Test-A and B (TMT-A, TMT-B) (Lezak, 1983), the Stroop Color
Naming Test (STROOP) Congruent and Incongruent (Stroop, 1992),
Simple Reaction Time (SRT), and Choice Reaction Time (CRT) (Collie
et al., 2007). All cognitive tests were administered using paper and
pencil except the computerized tests of SRT and CRT. Further, patient-
reported cognitive symptoms were assessed (at baseline, week 1 and
week 8) using the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire - Depression (PDQ-
D) (Lam et al., 2013).
Additional secondary efficacy outcomes assessed at baseline and at
weeks 1, 4, and 8 comprised mood symptoms as measured by the
clinician-rated Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
(Montgomery and Asberg, 1979), severity and improvement/worsening
of MDD evaluated by clinicians using the Clinical Global Impression –
Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and the CGI – Global Improvement (CGI-I, not
assessed at baseline) (Guy, 1976), and patients’ functioning assessed by
clinicians at baseline and at weeks 1 and 8 using the Functioning As-
sessment Short Test (FAST) (Rosa et al., 2007).
The DSST score was calculated as the number of correct symbols
(possible range 0–133). The UPSA-B total score was derived by con-
verting the raw score to a scaled score ranging from 0 to 100. To obtain
a measure of overall cognitive performance, the raw scores from all the
cognitive
tests
(DSST,
TMT-A,
TMT-B,
STROOP
Congruent
and
Incongruent, SRT and CRT) were standardized to z-scores, then
weighted equally into an average, composite z-score. For these scales,
higher z-scores reflect better cognitive performance.
For the rating scales [possible score ranges in parentheses] PDQ-D
(0–80), MADRS (0–60), and FAST (0–72), total scores were calculated
as the sum of scores on single items, with higher scores reflecting more
pronounced symptoms. For CGI-S (1–7) higher scores indicate greater
severity of MDD, and correspondingly for CGI-I (1–7), worsening of
MDD, with a CGI-I score of 4 reflecting neither improvement nor
worsening relative to baseline.
Safety and tolerability was assessed by reported adverse events.
Suicidality was rated and monitored using the Columbia Suicide
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner et al., 2011).
2.4. Sample size determination
Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 7 points in DSST change from
baseline to week 8 and a withdrawal rate of 15%, 50 patients in each
treatment arm would provide a power of approximately 80% for de-
tecting a pairwise treatment difference of 4.3 points based on a t-test
comparison at a 5% significance level.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Safety analyses included all randomized patients who were treated
with at least one dose of study medication. Efficacy analyses comprised
all treated patients with a valid baseline assessment and at least one
valid post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy variable, the
DSST (the full-analysis set, FAS). All statistical tests are two-sided. Data
was analyzed using SAS®, Version 9.4 statistical software.
The primary endpoint – the mean change from baseline at week 8 in
DSST score – was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated mea-
surements (MMRM), including study site, treatment and week (1 and 8)
as factors, baseline DSST score as a covariate, and treatment-by-week
and baseline score-by-week interactions. The key secondary endpoint,
the mean change from baseline at week 8 in UPSA-B total score, was
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and last ob-
servation carried forward (LOCF) method, including study site, and
treatment as factors, and baseline UPSA-B total score as a covariate. The
mean differences between the treatments were estimated based on the
least squares means for the treatment-by-week interaction in the
MMRM model and for the treatment factor in the ANCOVA model.
Other secondary endpoints, comprising the changes from baseline to
week 8 in PDQ-D, MADRS, CGI-S, and FAST scores, were analyzed using
MMRM models similar to that specified for the primary endpoint.
To account for multiplicity, the primary and key secondary efficacy
endpoints (the DSST number of correct symbols and UPSA-B total score,
respectively) were tested according to a pre-defined hierarchy at an
alpha-level of 5%. In case these endpoints did not reach statistical
significance, the testing strategy was stopped and p-values considered
nominal.
For endpoints assessing cognitive performance (composite cogni-
tion, DSST, TMT-A, TMT-B, STROOP Congruent and Incongruent, SRT,
CRT), standardized effect sizes (SES) versus placebo and accompanying
standard errors (SE) are reported; positive standardized effect sizes
favor the active treatment (vortioxetine or paroxetine) over placebo.
For all other efficacy endpoints, absolute mean differences (SE) versus
placebo are reported.
The associations between changes from baseline to week 8 in as-
sessments of cognition (composite cognition z-score, PDQ-D total
score), functioning (UPSA-B and FAST total scores), and depressive
symptoms (MADRS total scores) were estimated by partial correlations,
adjusted for treatment, site and baseline scores for the relevant vari-
ables (observed cases, OC).
Further, a post hoc path analysis was performed, following the ap-
proach described in Mahableshwarkar et al. (2015), to assess the extent
to which improvement at week 8 in overall cognitive functioning as
measured by the composite cognition z-score, was a direct effect of the
treatment, or an indirect effect mediated by improvement of depressive
symptoms as measured by the MADRS. The direct and indirect effects
are presented as proportions of the total effect (direct + indirect ef-
fects). A more detailed description of the methodology is provided in
Ditlevsen et al. (2005).

3. Results
Of a total of 152 patients randomized, 48 patients were treated with
placebo, 48 with vortioxetine and 54 with paroxetine (Fig. 1). Two-
thirds were women and all except two were Caucasian (Table 1).
Overall, the treatment groups were comparable in demographic and
clinical baseline characteristics.
Two patients (4%) treated with placebo withdrew from the study
while this was the case for 7 (15%) patients treated with vortioxetine
and 7 (13%) treated with paroxetine. The most frequent primary rea-
sons for withdrawal were adverse events and lack of efficacy (Fig. 1).
3.1. DSST (primary efficacy endpoint)
In all treatment groups, the mean DSST scores increased (improved)
from baseline to week 8 (Fig. 2). Neither vortioxetine nor paroxetine
separated from placebo (the mean difference versus placebo was 0.2; p
= 0.885 for vortioxetine, and −0.8; p = 0.609) for paroxetine (FAS,
MMRM). As the p-value for vortioxetine was > 0.05, the testing
strategy was stopped and subsequent p-values considered nominal.
3.2. Secondary efficacy endpoints
3.2.1. UPSA-B (key secondary efficacy endpoint)
At week 8 post-baseline, UPSA-B total scores had increased (im-
proved) for all groups (Table 2). No statistically significant differences
were seen versus placebo for vortioxetine or paroxetine.
3.2.2. Cognitive performance
At week 8, improvements relative to baseline were seen across the

423
 cognitive performance tests in all treatment groups, with numerical
differences versus placebo generally in favor of the active treatments
(Fig. 3). Only vortioxetine, not paroxetine, separated from placebo in
improving the composite cognition z-score, with standardized effect
sizes for vortioxetine versus placebo of 0.49 (p = 0.024; FAS, MMRM;
Fig. 3). The post-hoc path analysis showed that 71.9% (SE = 14.3; FAS,
LOCF) of this total effect was direct, i.e., not mediated by change in
MADRS total score. A similar result was not seen for paroxetine (direct
effect = −6.4%, SE = 112.5; FAS, LOCF).
3.2.3. Patient-reported cognitive symptoms
Patients treated with vortioxetine or paroxetine reported larger
improvements in self-reported cognitive symptoms as assessed by the
PDQ-D, with a mean difference of approximately 7 points relative to
those treated with placebo (p = 0.012 for vortioxetine and p = 0.010
for paroxetine at week 8 (FAS, MMRM; Table 2)).
3.2.4. Clinician-rated functioning
Improvements in FAST total score were seen in all treatment groups
at week 8 (Fig. 4), with a between-treatment difference that separated
from placebo only for vortioxetine (the mean difference versus placebo
was −4.71 (p = 0.028)) for vortioxetine and −2.71 (p = 0.195) for
paroxetine (FAS, MMRM; Table 2).
3.2.5. Mood symptoms
Mean MADRS total scores decreased (improved) during the treat-
ment period in all treatment groups, with both vortioxetine and par-
oxetine showing improvements versus placebo at week 8 (Table 2).
Similar patterns were seen for changes in CGI-S and CGI-I scores
(Table 2).
3.2.6. Partial correlations among cognition and functioning assessments
As shown in Table 3, the change from baseline at week 8 in cog-
nitive performance (composite cognition z-score) was positively cor-
related with changes in performance-based functional capacity (UPSA-B
total score, partial r = 0.213, p = 0.024) and negatively correlated
with changes in clinician-rated functioning (FAST total score, partial r
= −0.287, p = 0.002) and MADRS total score (partial r = −0.240; p
= 0.014). The change from baseline in patient-reported cognitive
symptoms (PDQ-D) was positively correlated with changes both in
FAST and MADRS total scores (with partial r's of 0.585, p < 0.001, and
0.609, p < 0.001, for the respective pairwise associations) but not with
changes in UPSA-B total score.
3.3. Safety endpoints
The number of patients reporting treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) were 18 (58%) for vortioxetine and 23 (43%) for
Fig. 1. Patient disposition. FAS: Full-analysis set.

 paroxetine versus 17 (35%) for placebo (Table 4). Nausea was the most
frequently reported adverse event after vortioxetine treatment (38%); 2
patients (4%) discontinued due to nausea. Serious adverse events were
reported for 1 patient treated with placebo, and for 0 and 2 treated with
vortioxetine and paroxetine, respectively. A total of 4 patients in the
placebo group and 2 in each of the active treatment groups reported
suicidal ideation; the majority these were classified in the mildest ca-
tegory (wish to be dead) and none with intent to act. No deaths oc-
curred during the study.
4. Discussion
This small-scale, explorative study showed no statistically sig-
nificant effects versus placebo after 8 weeks of treatment with vor-
tioxetine on cognitive performance or functional capacity as measured
by the DSST and the UPSA-B, respectively. Similarly, no significant
effects for these outcomes were seen for the active reference, parox-
etine.
However, patients allocated to vortioxetine showed numerically
larger improvements at week 8 consistently across the cognitive test
battery compared to those who received placebo, with a standardized
effect size (SES) for the overall cognition composite of 0.5, which is well
above the cut-point for clinical relevance of 0.2 SES regarded as stan-
dard in this field of research (Cohen, 1988). Consistent with results
from the pivotal studies (Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015; McIntyre et al.,
2014), the path-analysis further supported changes to be largely in-
dependent of improved depressive symptoms. A similar pattern was not
seen for paroxetine, for which numerical improvements versus placebo
were seen for only 4 of the 7 cognitive tests (DSST, TMT-A, TMT-B,
STROOP Congruent and Incongruent, SRT, CRT). Similarly, only vor-
tioxetine separated from placebo in improving clinician-rated overall
functioning as measured by the FAST. This advantage of vortioxetine
for cognitive performance as well as for clinician-rated functioning was
supported by the correlation between the composite cognitive score and
the FAST, which further support the psychometric and clinical utility of
the FAST among patients with MDD.
The finding that improvements in overall cognitive performance
were associated with improvements in both performance-based and
clinician-rated functioning is in line with previous studies that have
shown correlations between cognitive dysfunction and poor psychoso-
cial function (Buist-Bouwman et al., 2008; Godard et al., 2011; Kiosses
and Alexopoulos, 2005). Moreover, it has been proposed that im-
provement in cognitive performance could significantly predict func-
tional recovery after a major depressive episode (Jaeger et al., 2006;
Withall et al., 2009). Altogether, such findings underscore the key role
of cognitive performance for the functional status and functional re-
covery of depressed patients.
Further, differential patterns of correlations were seen for the sub-
jective and objective measures of cognition, with patient-reported PDQ-
D scores being associated with clinician-rated but not with perfor-
mance-based functioning, whereas global cognitive performance as
reflected by the composite cognition score was associated with both
measures. This might indicate that different assessment methods tap
into different processes, as supported by consistent findings across
various clinical and non-clinical populations of weak or no associations
between objective and subjective measures of cognition (Binder et al.,
1999; Buchanan, 2016; Crumley et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2001;
Srisurapanont et al., 2017). It has thus been suggested that subjective
cognitive complaints in MDD are related to mood symptoms more so
than to objective cognitive performance ( Binder et al., 1999; Marino
et al., 2009). Consistent with this notion, in our data improvements in
subjective cognitive symptoms (PDQ-D) at week 8 were more strongly
associated with improvements in mood symptoms than with improve-
ments in objective cognitive performance. Further, vortioxetine showed
more pronounced effects compared with paroxetine for objective cog-
nitive performance (composite cognition) and clinician-rated func-
tioning (FAST), whereas the treatments were comparable in improving
depressive symptoms and subjective cognitive complaints. Vortioxetine
has previously demonstrated specific improvements on measures of

 objective cognition and functioning in a large-scale study in which a
different antidepressant (duloxetine) did not (Mahableshwarkar et al.,
2015).
There may be several explanations as to why the study did not
replicate previously reported effects of vortioxetine on DSST perfor-
mance (Katona et al., 2012; Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015; McIntyre
et al., 2014). This study had smaller sample size (50 patients in each
treatment arm versus approximately 200 in the pivotal studies), and
consequently lower statistical power to detect treatment differences.
Further, the substantial improvement of approximately 7 DSST points
seen in the placebo group is associated with decreased assay sensitivity.
This large placebo-response exceeded those seen in the pivotal studies,
among which the largest DSST placebo-response was approximately 5
points in the study by McIntyre et al. (2014). This is likely to be

 explained as a practice effect, which may be particularly pronounced in
this study population of depressed patients who maintained their oc-
cupational functioning (approximately 90% of the sample had full-time
employment), which may potentially be associated with a larger cog-
nitive reserve and consequently higher learning capacity. This hy-
pothesis is supported by the overall higher baseline scores in cognitive
performance and functional capacity among this study sample relative
to
those
observed
in
previous
studies
of
adult
patients
(Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015; McIntyre et al., 2014).
Further, simple reaction time, for which vortioxetine substantially
separated from placebo, may be more robust against practice effects
than more complex tasks such as the DSST (Salinsky et al., 2001). In
addition, SRT was assessed using a computerized test which could be
more sensitive to effects of treatment in this study, e.g., due to poten-
tially higher interrater-reliability, than a paper-and-pencil test. Also,
because the study focused on a natural working population of patients
with MDD, the sample was not enriched for cognitive symptoms. This
may have decreased sensitivity to detect cognitive improvements.
Finally, it cannot be excluded that a higher dose than 10 mg/day of
vortioxetine could have generated results that were more favorable for
vortioxetine compared with paroxetine; however, based on the current
data, this remains a speculation. Vortioxetine was well-tolerated with
nausea being the most common adverse event. The safety and toler-
ability profile was similar to those observed in comparable patient
populations in the pivotal studies (Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015;
McIntyre et al., 2014; Orsolini et al., 2017).
4.1. Limitations
Results beyond the primary and key secondary endpoints in this
explorative study were derived from statistical tests that were not
controlled for multiplicity. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity were
excluded from the study as were patients at risk of suicide and the re-
sults can therefore not be generalized beyond this subpopulation of
patients with MDD. Further, the study did not include information on
premorbid cognitive performance levels and it can therefore not be
determined if the higher performance seen at baseline relative to pre-
vious studies reflected higher cognitive function relative to the clinical
background population, or higher cognitive abilities relative to the
general population. Finally, this short-term (8 weeks) study does not
allow for conclusions regarding long-term effects of improvements in
cognitive function. The improvement in functional status seen over this
short study period, which was linked to cognitive improvement, sug-
gests a potential for functional recovery over time; however, long-term
studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.
5. Conclusion
Although this explorative, small-scale study did not show significant
differences versus placebo in DSST or UPSA-B performance, the results
across MDD symptom domains add evidence for a broad antidepressant
effect of 8 weeks of vortioxetine 10 mg/day versus placebo. In addition
to vortioxetine performing at a comparable level as the active reference
(paroxetine) in improving mood symptoms, the numerical results in-
dicate an added benefit for overall cognitive performance that is spe-
cific for vortioxetine. Associations between cognitive and functional
improvements further underline that targeting cognitive function in
depression may be of particular relevance for the population of working
patients, for whom improved cognitive performance can help promote
occupational performance in addition to overall psychosocial func-
tioning. Vortioxetine 10 mg/day was safe and well tolerated in this
study.
