Dyslipidemia is exemplified by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and represents a risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases and requires therapeutic intervention. Several experimental studies suggest that bitter melon (Momordica
charantia) improves lipid metabolism in animal models of dyslipidemia and diabetes. This study evaluated the effects of bitter melon
extracts on lipid metabolism following a 30-day treatment period in Japanese adults. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial included 43 adult volunteers who received either 100 mg of hot-water extracts of bitter melon (n = 23) or a placebo
(n = 20) three times daily for 30 days. The body weight, blood pressure, and levels of LDL-C and other blood parameters of each
subject were measured before and after the study period. The results showed that the intervention group exhibited significantly lower
LDL-C levels (P = 0.02) as compared with the control group, and there were no significant changes in either group in terms of body
weight, body mass index, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides,
or blood glucose. These results suggested that bitter melon extracts might effectively lower LDL-C levels in humans and exhibit
potential therapeutic value for the management of dyslipidemic conditions.
1. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading global
cause of death, with the World Health Organization project-
ing that 8,760,000 people died due to ischemic heart disease
in 2015 [1]. Various studies demonstrated that dyslipidemia
is a risk factor for CVD [2], with low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) having a greater effect than high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or triglycerides (TGs). The
US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel III guidelines found that high LDL-C levels
constitute a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and
require clinical intervention [3].
Lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, are used along
with lifestyle interventions to treat high LDL-C levels,
although the absence of clear symptoms is associated with
poor drug adherence [4]. Furthermore, many patients have
dyslipidemia and borderline dyslipidemia, which results in
large numbers of patients with inadequately managed high
LDL-C levels. Improvements in diet and exercise can be
enhanced by avoiding saturated fats and cholesterol, as well
as consuming greater proportions of plant stanols/sterols
and soluble fiber [3]. Moreover, lower LDL-C levels can be
achieved by consuming greater proportions of oats, avocados,
nuts, soybeans, tomatoes, apples, and prunes [5‚Äì11].
Several studies report that bitter melon (Momordica
charantia) can improve blood glucose levels and lipid
metabolism in animal models of dyslipidemia and diabetes
[12, 13]. Bitter melon belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family
and is commonly eaten as a vegetable in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. Additionally, it has been used as a traditional
herbal medicine for treating diabetes in India and China
for ages [12]. Studies using mouse models suggest that bitter
melon improves glucose and lipid metabolism by activating
the translocation of GLUT4 to cell membranes in mouse
L6 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, skeletal muscle tissue, and
the liver, as well as promoting AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) function [13‚Äì15]. Moreover, bitter melon reduces

the mRNA levels of 11ùõΩ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type
1 (11ùõΩ-HSD1) in the mouse liver, which reduces its excessive
glucocorticoid activity and involvement in the development
of obesity and insulin resistance [15]. Furthermore, patients
with recently diagnosed diabetes and who consumed bitter
melon in herbal supplements exhibited decreased plasma
glycated hemoglobin levels and improved TG levels (vs.
baseline) along with a modest effect on hypoglycemia [16].
Therefore, the authors of that report concluded that bitter
melon helps ameliorate the diabetes-associated risk of CVD.
Several research groups evaluated the lipid-lowering
effect of bitter melon in mouse and rat models of obesity and
diabetes, providing evidence that its use can improve dyslipi-
demia (e.g., levels of TGs and LDL-C) and hyperglycemia [17,
18]. Additionally, bitter melon extract suppresses SREBP1c
[18], which is thought to play an important role in the
expression of lipid- constituting enzymes, synthesis of fatty
acids, and accumulation of TGs. Furthermore, pretreatment
of rats with a bitter melon polysaccharide extract reduced
the size of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction, as
well as serum levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and LDL-C.
However, this treatment increased the activity of superoxide
dismutase and catalase along with concomitant increases in
proinflammatory cytokines and decreases in inflammatory
markers, such as nitric oxide [12, 19]. These observations
suggest that bitter melon might have a myocardial-protective
effect, although no human study has examined the effects
of bitter melon on human lipid metabolism. Therefore, the
present randomized controlled study examined the effect
of bitter melon extract on lipid metabolism in a group of
Japanese adults.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials. This study used capsules containing bitter
melon extract from Okinawa prefecture or placebo. The bitter
melons were subjected to hot-water extraction and filtration
along with the addition of starch hydrolysate as an excipient
before being autoclaved and dried. Based on our research,
the constituent (derived from bitter gourd) extracted with
this method is considered a type of pectin (a plant cell-wall
constituent). Because the extract has a unique appearance
and taste, the study dose (100 mg of extract, approximately
equivalent to 3 g of melon) was placed in white capsules that
also contained microcrystalline cellulose, calcium stearate,
and fine silicon dioxide as fillers. The placebo capsules were
filled with starch hydrolysate.
2.2. Subjects. For this randomized controlled trial, 47 healthy
Japanese adults (19 men and 28 women) were recruited
according to the method described by Ursoniu et al. [20].
Subject recruitment was coordinated by Huma Corporation
(Minato Ward, Tokyo, Japan). The inclusion criteria were (1)
age between 40 and 74 years and (2) willingness to provide
written informed consent to participate after receiving a
sufficient explanation regarding the purpose and procedures
of the study. The exclusion criteria were (1) receiving contin-
uous drug therapy (e.g., pranlukast hydrate, metformin, and
lipid-lowering drugs), (2) exhibiting an allergic response to
the study materials, (3) consuming supplements that might
affect the study parameters (based on the discretion of the
attending physician), (4) having had digestive organs surgi-
cally removed, (5) having had the presence or possibility of
pregnancy and/or breast feeding, and (6) having participated
in another clinical study within the previous 3 months.
2.3. Study Design and Parameters. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethics committee of Imagine Global Care
Corporation and was pre-registered in the University Hos-
pital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Reg-
istry (UMIN000026636). All participants provided written
informed consent, and the study was performed in accor-
dance with the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki.
The subjects were randomly assigned. This was specif-
ically done by placing participants in either the control
group or the intervention group using a computer-generated
randomized number table. The subjects, study doctor, and
data analyzer were blinded to subject assignments. Starting
on day 1, the subjects consumed three capsules daily (100 mg)
for 30 days, with each capsule containing either bitter melon
extract or placebo. Blood testing and measurements of weight
and blood pressure were performed on days 1 (the first visit)
and 30 (the second visit).
Subjects were instructed to not consume sweet food or
drinks after 22:00 on the night before blood testing. The
values of total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, TGs, glucose, and
glycated hemoglobin were also determined. All biochemical
tests were conducted by LSI Medience Corporation (Tokyo,
Japan) using Stacia, an automated clinical testing machine.
2.4. Statistical Analysis. Pearson's chi-square test was used
to compare the male: female ratios between the control and
intervention groups. An unpaired t test was used to compare
baseline and post intervention body weight, blood pressure,
and biochemical parameters between the control and inter-
vention groups as well as the changes in these values for each
group. Confounding effects were evaluated using multiple
regression analysis (forced entry method), with the change
in LDL-C levels used as the dependent variable, and sex, age,
and baseline body mass index used as independent variables.
The Japan Atherosclerosis Society defines hypercholes-
terolemia as ‚â•140 mg/dL LDL-C and borderline hypercholes-
terolemia as 120‚Äì139 mg/dL LDL-C. Therefore, we addition-
ally analyzed subjects whose baseline LDL-C was equal to
or exceeded 120 mg/dL and determined the difference in
changes in LDL-C between the control and intervention
subjects. Differences were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05, and all analyses were performed using SPSS
software (v17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
3. Results
Among the 47 recruited subjects, two were excluded because
they were receiving continuous drug therapy (pranlukast
hydrate and metformin), and two other were excluded after
failing to attend the second visit. There was no significant
difference in the male: female ratios of the control (n = 20)
and intervention (n = 23) groups (Table 1). Table 2 shows the

changes in metabolic parameters of the subjects from baseline
to post intervention. No significant differences were observed
between the control and intervention groups at baseline. The
intervention group showed significantly decreased LDL-C
levels at the second visit (-5.7 ¬± 18.5 mg/dL) as compared
with the control group (+12 ¬± 27.3, P = 0.02). There was
no significant difference in changes in body weight, BMI,
blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL-C, TGs, glucose, and
glycated hemoglobin between the control and intervention
groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the inter-
vention group had a significantly increased likelihood of
lower LDL-C levels after adjusting for sex, age, and baseline
body mass index (Table 3). Baseline LDL-C ‚â•140 mg/dL was
observed for 6 subjects in the control group and 9 subjects
in the intervention group compared with 7 subjects in each
group at the second visit. Furthermore, baseline LDL-C ‚â•120
mg/dL was observed for 10 subjects in the control group
and 14 subjects in the intervention group compared with 11
subjects in each group at the second visit. Among the subjects
with baseline LDL-C equal to or exceeding 120 mg/dL, the
mean changes were +12.6 ¬± 25.8 mg/dL in the control group
and -9.3 ¬± 17.9 mg/dL in the intervention group (P = 0.02).
Figure 1 shows the changes in LDL-C levels in all subjects in
the control and intervention groups and those with baseline
LDL-C ‚â•120 mg/dL.

ailments, including gastrointestinal complaints, constipation,
dermatitis, cough, and diabetes [21]. However, several clinical
studies have failed to show clear pharmacological effects.
Our research revealed that the component extracted from
bitter melon in this study was one form of pectin. It has long
been known that soluble fiber, including pectin, effectively
lowers LDL-C. Brown et al. conducted a meta-analysis of
four types of soluble fiber (pectin, oat bran, guar gum, and
psyllium) and found that all reduce LDL-C to the same extent
[22]. Namely, intake of 3 g of soluble fiber per day reduced
LDL-C by roughly 5 mg/dL. Though soluble fiber also lowers
HDL- C, the decrease is extremely slight, and there is no effect
on TGs. This study was consistent with the results of previous
research on soluble fiber, demonstrating that although bitter
melon extract reduced LDL-C, there was no effect on HDL-
C or TGs. The daily dose of bitter melon extract used in
the present study was 300 mg‚Äîa small amount compared
with that in most previous studies, in which quantities were
in grams‚Äîsuggesting that soluble fiber from bitter melon
extract is effective at reducing LDL-C even at a lower dose.
There are several possible mechanisms involved in the
reduction in HDL-C by soluble fiber. First, the theory that
fiber promotes bile acid excretion, thereby reducing choles-
terol, has been advocated for years [23]. The idea is that
because blood cholesterol is used in the synthesis of bile
acid, highly viscous soluble fiber adheres to and helps excrete
bile acid enveloping cholesterol. However, some scholars
argue that the amount of bile acid excretion is insufficient
to explain the reduction in cholesterol [24]. It was further
reported that soluble fiber increases the number of apo B/E
receptors, which bind to LDL-C and accelerate the LDL-
C metabolic turnover rate [25, 26]. Effects from improved
insulin sensitivity [27] and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis
in the liver due to the formation of short-chain fatty acids
through fermentation of fiber in the large intestine have also
been indicated [28, 29]. Although we observed significant
decrease in LDL-C levels in the present study, there was no
change in blood glucose levels, suggesting that reduced LDL-
C levels might not be mediated by insulin resistance.
Previous studies evaluated the effects of bitter melon on
dyslipidemia using rats. Bitter melon treatment of diabetic
rats normalized the increase in nonesterified cholesterol,
TGs, LDL, and phospholipids [18, 30, 31]. Additionally,
increased mitochondrial biogenesis could be a pathway
associated with increased lipid metabolism and utilization,
with several genes, including PPARùõæ, involved in the reg-
ulation of this process [32, 33]. Bitter melon treatment of
rats increased the expression of PPARùõæ coactivator (PGC1ùõº)
and fatty acid-binding protein 1, and in this context, PGC1
family members influence hepatic metabolism by stimulating
mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in several types
of cells while also altering biological pathways involved in
oxidative metabolism [33]. In rat-based studies, test animals
that received a high-fat diet and bitter melon extract displayed
reduced levels of plasma TGs, cholesterol, and free fatty acids
[34]. These results suggest that bitter melon extract might
improve dyslipidemia in humans.
This study had several limitations. First, the small sample
size of the study suggests that caution is needed in gener-
alizing the applicability of the study results. Using purified
 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
5
samples of bitter melon extract might improve the interest
of volunteers in enrolling in follow-up studies. Second, the
dose of 300 mg per day used in this study may be too low
compared with that in previous studies, in which several
grams were administered daily. In addition, the administered
dose in this study was not adjusted for individual body weight
and was unrelated to the dose used in tradomedical use of
bitter melon. Previous studies used doses of ‚àº150 mg/kg [12]
and between 500 mg/kg and 2,000 mg/kg [16, 35].
Therefore, it is important to perform additional studies
to determine the mechanisms through which bitter melon
lowers LDL-C levels, as well as its effects on other indices
related to the lipid profile.
5. Conclusion
The water-soluble extract of bitter melon significantly
decreased LDL-C levels as compared with the control
(placebo) group in humans. Therefore, bitter melon might be
useful in reducing the risks of cholesterol-mediated diseases,
including CVDs.
