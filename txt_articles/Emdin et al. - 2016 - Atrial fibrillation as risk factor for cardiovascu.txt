ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether atrial fibrillation is a stronger 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in 
women compared with men.
Design
Meta-analysis of cohort studies.
Data sOurCes
Studies published between January 1966 and March 
2015, identified through a systematic search of 
Medline and Embase and review of references.
eligibility fOr seleCting stuDies
Cohort studies with a minimum of 50 participants 
with and 50 without atrial fibrillation that reported sex 
specific associations between atrial fibrillation and all 
cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, 
cardiac events (cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial 
infarction), and heart failure.
Data extraCtiOn
Two independent reviewers extracted study 
characteristics and maximally adjusted sex specific 
relative risks. Inverse variance weighted random 
effects meta-analysis was used to pool sex specific 
relative risks and their ratio.
results
30 studies with 4 371 714 participants were 
identified. Atrial fibrillation was associated with a 
higher risk of all cause mortality in women (ratio of 
relative risks for women compared with men 1.12, 
95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.17) and a 
significantly stronger risk of stroke (1.99, 1.46 to 
2.71), cardiovascular mortality (1.93, 1.44 to 2.60), 
cardiac events (1.55, 1.15 to 2.08), and heart failure 
(1.16, 1.07 to 1.27). Results were broadly consistent 
in sensitivity analyses.
COnClusiOn
Atrial fibrillation is a stronger risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and death in women compared 
with men, though further research would be needed to 
determine any causality.
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading cause of cardiovascu-
lar disease worldwide,1  with an estimated 33.5 million 
people affected in 2010.2  Recent estimates from the 
Global Burden of Disease study indicated that AF was 
associated with an age adjusted mortality rate of 1.7 per 
100 000 people (95% uncertainty interval 1.4 to 2.1) in 
20103  and that the prevalence is increasing in both 
developed and developing countries.2
Although AF is associated with an increased risk of 
stroke4  and death5  in men and women, a growing 
body of literature suggests that women and men expe-
rience risk factors for cardiovascular disease differ-
ently. Previous analyses have shown that smoking and 
diabetes are associated with greater proportional risks 
of coronary heart disease in women than in men.6 7 
Diabetes is also associated with a greater relative risk 
of stroke in women.8  It is currently unclear, however, 
whether such sex differences exist for AF. While being 
female is a risk factor for stroke among individuals 
with AF,9  this could reflect differences in the multi-
variable adjusted risk of stroke by sex in the general 
population rather than differential effects of AF by 
sex. To explore sex differences in the effect of AF, it is 
necessary to compare sex specific estimates of the 
effect of AF on risk of death and cardiovascular dis-
ease. While some studies have suggested that AF is 
more strongly associated with the risk of stroke10 and 
death11 in women than men, others have suggested 
not.12-14 Sex differences in the association between AF 
and death and cardiovascular disease would have sub-
stantial implications for the estimation of the global 
and regional burden, for the targeting of treatment to 
manage it, and for future research into causes of sex 
differences.
Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis of cohort 
studies to estimate the association between AF and car-
diovascular disease and death in women and men and 
to compare the sexes.

done in accordance with the MOOSE (meta-analysis of 
observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines.15 
An experienced research librarian designed and con-
ducted the search strategy. Medline and Embase were 
searched from 1966 to March 2015 with a combined 
text and MeSH subheading search with the following 
terms: “atrial fibrillation”, “mortality”, “death”, “car-
diovascular disease”, “heart failure”, “myocardial 
infarction”, “death, sudden, cardiac”, “stroke”, “kid-
ney”, “renal”, “peripheral”, and “risk factors”. We 
conducted a review of the references of identified 
studies.
We included any study that reported sex specific 
associations between AF and any of the following out-
comes: all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, 
stroke (fatal and non-fatal), cardiac events (a compos-
ite of cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarc-
tion, excluding heart failure), heart failure, peripheral 
arterial disease, and chronic kidney disease. For 
inclusion in the analysis, studies were required to 
have a minimum of 50 participants with AF, a mini-
mum of 50 participants without AF, and a median fol-
low-up of at least six months. Importantly, we 
included only studies that reported associations for 
both men and women to restrict our analysis to com-
parisons of men and women within studies and to 
reduce the risk of heterogeneity between studies 
influencing our results. Additionally, we required all 
studies to adjust for, at a minimum, age and the pres-
ence of cardiovascular disease at baseline. We 
excluded studies that examined postoperative atrial 
fibrillation because the differing epidemiology and 
duration of postoperative atrial fibrillation relative to 
chronic atrial fibrillation.16 There were no language 
restrictions, and an investigator with extensive expe-
rience in epidemiological study translation (AJH) 
translated non-English studies. We contacted authors 
of studies that did not report separate associations for 
women and men to provide any unpublished data on 
adjusted sex specific associations.
Data extraction
Data were extracted, in duplicate, from studies 
deemed to meet the eligibility criteria. These included 
details on general study characteristics (study name, 
duration of follow-up, year of publication), informa-
tion about the studied population (number of partici-
pants with and without AF, mean age, number of men 
and women, number of participants with a history of 
coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure), and 
information on the outcomes in the study (all cause 
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, cardiac 
events, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and 
chronic kidney disease). We extracted sex specific 
adjusted measures of relative risk (hazard ratios, rela-
tive risks, and odds ratio) and 95% confidence inter-
vals. We used the maximally adjusted relative risk that 
was available and risk estimates corresponding to the 
longest period of follow-up. For cohorts that had mul-
tiple reports of the same outcome, we used the report 
with the largest number of events. Study quality was 
assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort 
studies.17
statistical analysis
For the primary analysis, we derived a ratio of relative 
risks with 95% confidence intervals of AF for each out-
come in women compared with men, as previously 
described.8  This relative risk ratio for each study was 
then pooled with inverse variance weighted random 
effects meta-analysis. We also pooled relative risks for 
men and women separately. For one study, which 
reported separate hazard ratios for men and women in 
different age groups, we first used inverse variance 
weighted fixed effects meta-analysis to generate a sum-
mary hazard ratio for men and for women.18  We used 
funnel plots to examine if publication bias seemed to be 
present for outcomes that had at least 10 studies pres-
ent (all cause mortality and stroke).19  If publication bias 
was present, we used the trim and fill method to adjust 
for publication bias.20 Heterogeneity was quantified 
with the I2 statistic and the Q test. P<0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
To estimate the difference in absolute risks associ-
ated with AF between women and men, we multiplied 
estimated sex specific excess incidence rates for all 
cause mortality,21  cardiovascular mortality,21  coronary 
heart disease21  (restricted to coronary heart disease 
mortality as an incidence rate for the composite of cor-
onary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial 
infarction could not be obtained), stroke,22  and heart 
failure23 in the United Kingdom general population by 
sex specific associations of each outcome with AF. The 
relative risk associated with each outcome in women 
was calculated by multiplying the pooled ratio of rela-
tive risks by the relative risk in men. We then subtracted 
the excess risk in men from the excess risk in women to 
estimate the difference in absolute risks associated with 
AF between men and women. Confidence intervals 
were derived through simulation with 10 000 draws 
from the distribution of the men’s relative risk and ratio 
of relative risks performed.
sensitivity analyses
We undertook seven sensitivity analyses to determine if 
the ratio of relative risks in women versus men for mor-
tality and stroke differed by methodological and study 
characteristics. Firstly, we stratified studies by whether 
AF was ascertained through electrocardiography at base-
line or through medical records. Secondly, we stratified 
by region (Europe versus non-Europe). For these two 
stratified analyses (which stratified on categorical vari-
ables), we performed tests for interactions between sub-
groups. Thirdly, we stratified by size of the study 
(>100 000 versus <100 000 participants) to examine 
whether the results were consistent we excluded two 
large studies24 
25 (each with more than 100 000 partici-
pants). Fourthly, we stratified by baseline year of enrol-
ment of each cohort (1990 and before versus 1991 or 
later). Fifthly, we stratified by length of follow-up (≤10 
versus >10 years). Sixthly, we stratified by median age 
(≤65 versus >65 at baseline). Finally, we stratified studies

by the ratio of the event rate in women to men to examine 
whether our results were influenced by potentially lower 
absolute risk of outcomes in women than men. For the 
five analyses that stratified on continuous variables we 
performed tests for trend using meta-regression. The 
seven sensitivity analyses were restricted to stroke and 
all cause mortality because there were too few studies to 
conduct sensitivity analyses for other outcomes. All sta-
tistical analyses were conducted with R version 3.0.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
the design and implementation of the study. There are 
no plans to involve patients in dissemination.
Results
The systematic search identified 3635 studies, of which 
268 were examined in the full text review (fig 1) and 238 
were excluded. Accordingly, we included 30 cohort 
studies. None of these studies reported sex specific 
associations for either peripheral arterial disease or 
chronic kidney disease. Twenty studies provided pub-
lished sex specific associations, while 10 studies pro-
vided unpublished associations.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included 
studies. Ascertainment of AF status was through elec-
trocardiography or continuous monitoring in 15  
studies, 
medical records in eight studies, and a combination in 
six studies. One study did not report the method of 
ascertainment. Quality of included studies, as assessed 
by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was high (appendix 
table A).
Studies included a total of 4 371 714 participants, 
66 511 with AF (not counting one study34  with an over-
lapping cohort as a second study24). Twenty six studies 
reported the number of events. Of these, 14 studies 
reported on all cause mortality (18 563 events), four 
studies on cardiovascular mortality (7702 events), 11 
studies reported on stroke (83 030 events), six studies 
on cardiac events (3583 events), and three studies on 
heart failure (27 468 events). Four additional studies 
reported relative risks for all cause mortality, cardiovas-
cular mortality, and stroke associated with AF but did 
not report the number of events. Appendix table B 
shows pooled incidence rates for studies that reported 
number of events for men and women separately are 
provided.
risk of cardiovascular disease and all cause 
mortality in women versus men
The pooled relative risk of all cause mortality for indi-
viduals with AF compared with those without AF was 
higher in women than in men (relative risk 1.69 (95% 
confidence interval 1.50 to 1.90) v 1.47 (1.32 to 1.65); 
fig 2 ). The pooled ratio of relative risks for women ver-
sus men showed a 12% greater risk of all cause mortal-
ity associated with AF in women than in men (relative 
risk ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.17l; 
fig 3). Although heterogeneity was observed in the rela-
tive risk of all cause mortality associated with AF in 
both women and men (I2=91% and I2=89%, respectively, 
P<0.001; fig 2), no significant heterogeneity was 
observed in the pooled ratio of relative risks (I2=2%, 
P=0.43; fig 3).
The relative risk of stroke was also greater in women 
than in men (relative risk 4.05 (95% confidence interval 
2.52 to 6.50) v 1.77 (1.40 to 2.24); fig 4 ). When we pooled 
the ratios of relative risks, AF was observed to be asso-
ciated with twice the relative risk of stroke in women 
than in men (relative risk ratio 1.99, 95% confidence 
interval 1.46 to 2.71; fig 5). There was significant hetero-
geneity between studies (I2=73%, P<0.001).
AF was associated with a higher relative risk of car-
diovascular mortality in women than in men (relative 
risk ratio 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 2.60; 
fig 6; appendix fig A), with little heterogeneity observed 
between studies (I2=8%), and was associated with a 
55% higher relative risk of cardiac events (cardiac death 
or non-fatal myocardial infarction) in women versus 
men (1.55, 1.15 to 2.08; fig 6 ; appendix fig B). This was 
consistent when we restricted our analysis to three 
studies that reported only myocardial infarction, 
excluding the one study that reported sudden cardiac 
death30 (1.64, 1.15 to 2.34). AF was also associated with 
an increased risk of heart failure in women compared 
with men (1.16, 1.07 to 1.27; appendix fig C).
When we looked at events per 1000 patient years, 
corresponding absolute risk increases in outcomes 
associated with AF in women compared with men were 
1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.6) for all cause

(1.1 to 6.1) for stroke, 0.6 (0.03 to 1.3) for cardiac events, 
and 6.1 (2.1 to 12.7) for heart failure.
sensitivity analyses
Ratios of relative risk for all cause mortality were 
broadly consistent in seven sensitivity analyses (appen-
dix fig D). Results of tests of interaction were non-signif-
icant when we stratified studies by ascertainment of AF 
through electrocardiography versus use of medical 
records/self reported history and region (Europe, 
non-Europe; all P>0.05 for interaction). Results of tests 
for trend by number of participants, baseline year, and 
ratio of mortality rate in women to men were also 
non-significant. Ratios of relative risk, however, 
declined with increasing length of follow-up and 
increasing age (appendix fig D).
For ratios of relative risks for stroke, results of tests 
of interaction by ascertainment method and region 
were non-significant (appendix fig E). Results of tests 
for trend by number of participants, baseline year, 
length of follow-up, and median age were also 
non-significant. Relative risks were significantly 
higher in studies with a lower ratio of absolute rate of 
stroke in women compared with men (P=0.027 for 
trend for ratio of stroke rate in women to men). When 
we restricted the meta-analysis to three studies with 
a ratio of stroke rate in women to men greater than 1 
(that is, a greater absolute rate of stroke in women 
than men), however, atrial fibrillation continued to 
be associated with a higher relative risk of stroke in 
women than men (1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.18 
to 1.83).
We found no evidence of publication bias for all 
cause mortality (appendix fig F), though we observed 
significant publication bias for stroke (appendix fig G; 
P=0.002). When we used the trim and fill method to 
control for publication bias, AF was associated with a 
non-significantly higher risk of stroke in women than in 
men (relative risk ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 
0.94 to 1.73).
discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 stud-
ies with 4 371 714 participants, we observed atrial fibril-
lation (AF) to be a significantly greater risk factor for 
death and cardiovascular disease in women than in 
men. AF was associated with a higher relative risk of 
all cause mortality, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, 
cardiac events, and heart failure in women compared 
with men.
Comparison with previous individual studies
Previous studies have presented conflicting evidence 
on the effect of AF on the risk of death and cardiovascu-
lar disease in women. Of the 19 studies on the associa-
tion of AF with the risk of all cause mortality (fig 2 ) we 
included in our analysis, the ratio of relative risks was 
greater than one but not significant for 11 studies. When 
we pooled these studies using random effects 
meta-analysis, the estimate for all cause mortality was 
significant, indicating that individual studies were 
underpowered to detect a differential effect of AF on 
risk of all cause mortality in women compared with 
men. Similarly, six of the 13 studies that reported a sex 
specific association of AF with stroke did not detect a 
significant interaction between women and men (fig 3). 
When we pooled these studies, however, we observed a 
significant ratio of relative risks, again indicating a lack 
of power of some previous individual studies to detect 
an interaction by sex.

Recent meta-analyses have shown that type 2 diabe-
tes is a greater risk factor for coronary heart disease7 47 
 
(ratio of relative risk 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.27 
to 1.63) and for stroke8  (1.27
, 1.10 to 1.46) in women than 
in men and that type 1 diabetes is also a greater risk 
factor for death and cardiovascular disease in 
women.48  Evidence of an increased risk of coronary 
heart disease associated with type 2 diabetes in women 
has been cited in European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
in patients with type 2 diabetes.49  Similarly, evidence 
of an increased risk of stroke associated with type 2 
diabetes in women has been included in American 
Heart Association/American Stroke Association guide-
lines for stroke prevention in women.50 Our results 
show that AF is also a greater risk factor for death and 
cardiovascular disease in women than in men and 
extend these previous works showing that women 
experience the effects of some key risk factors for car-
diovascular disease differently to men.
It is unclear what could cause the observed differ-
ences in risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease 
associated with AF between women and men. One pos-
sibility is that women with AF are undertreated relative 
to men. The results of a cohort study of Canadian 
patients with AF enrolled in 1990-94 support this 
hypothesis. Canadian women were half as likely as 
Canadian men to receive warfarin.51  Analyses of more 
contemporary cohorts, including a global registry of 
17 814 patients with AF52  and an analysis of 83 513 
patients with AF in Quebec,53  however, showed no dif-
ferences in use of anticoagulants between men and 
women with AF.53  It is therefore unlikely that broad 
 
differences in treatment between the sexes are respon-
sible for the increased relative risks we observed in 
women. Physiological or psychosocial differences 
between women and men could result in differential 
effects of AF on cardiovascular risk. For example, 
women are at a higher risk of torsade de pointes, an 
often lethal adverse event of antiarrhythmic drugs pre-
scribed for AF.54  Response to oral anticoagulants could 
also differ between the sexes, with a higher risk of 
bleeding observed among women.55 Future research is 
needed to distinguish if one or many of these potential 
mechanisms underlie the differential effects of AF 
observed in our analysis.
strengths and limitations
This analysis has several strengths. Firstly, as a system-
atic review and meta-analysis of all available studies of 
AF and risk of death and cardiovascular disease in 
women compared with men, it has greater power than 
any of the included individual studies to detect differ-
ences. This is evident in the meta-analysis of all cause 
mortality, in which 16 of the included 19 studies did not 
detect a difference. Secondly, we included only studies 
that reported the effect of AF on risk of cardiovascular 
disease and death separately in men and women. This 
ensured that our primary analysis (the ratio of relative 
risks) was a within study comparison, minimising the 
effect of heterogeneity between studies. Thirdly, we 
included only cohort studies that were adequately 
adjusted (prespecified requirement to adjust by at least 
age and history of cardiovascular disease) and that had 
a minimum of 100 participants with six months’ fol-
low-up to reduce the risk of confounding and small 
study effects. Fourthly, pooled ratios of relative risk for 
all cause mortality or stroke were broadly consistent in 
several different sensitivity analyses.
This analysis also has several limitations. Firstly, 
while we attempted to contact and acquire unpublished 
data from eligible cohorts, our results might be influ-
enced by publication bias because studies that detect 
an interaction between AF and risk of death and cardio-
vascular disease by sex might be more likely to be pub-
lished. While there was evidence of publication bias for 
stroke, however, we found no evidence of this for all 
cause mortality. Furthermore, use of trim and fill proce-
dures resulted in a non-significantly increased effect of 
AF on risk of stroke in women compared with in men 
similar in magnitude to other outcomes. Secondly, as a 
meta-analysis of observational studies, sex differences 
in the association of AF with risk of death and cardio-
vascular disease might be caused by unobserved con-
founding between sexes. For example, women might 
have had a greater number of comorbidities at the time 
of diagnosis of AF, which could not be fully adjusted for. 
However, we required included studies to adjust for, at 
minimum, age and presence of cardiovascular comor-
bidities, and we used the maximally adjusted model 
available. Thirdly, many of the studies had differences 
in design, duration of follow-up, outcome ascertain-
ment, and populations. Indeed, we observed a greater 
absolute increase in cardiovascular death than all

cause death because of differing studies contributing to 
either outcome. Because our primary analysis was 
focused on comparisons within studies (the ratio of rel-
ative risks between women and men), however, hetero-
geneity was low for outcomes other than stroke. 
Fourthly, our primary analysis focused on the ratio of 
relative risks, which might not reflect absolute differ-
ences in risk of death and cardiovascular disease asso-
ciated with AF between sexes. We found no evidence of 
a difference in ratios of relative risk in studies in which 
the absolute risk of all cause mortality was higher in 
men (appendix fig D), and a higher ratio of relative risks 
continued to be observed in studies in which women 
had a higher absolute rate of stroke than men (appendix 
fig E). Finally, we were unable to ascertain the underly-
ing cause of the sex differences in the association of AF 
with risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease.
implications for clinicians, policy makers, and 
future research
This analysis has several implications. With respect to 
clinical care, our results indicate that AF is associated 
with worse outcomes in women than in men. Although 
female sex is incorporated as a risk factor for stroke in 
the widely used CHA2DS2-VASc score,56  AF seems to 
affect women and men differently. The American Heart 
Association recently recommended the development of 
a specific risk score for stroke in women as some risk 
factors for stroke are unique to women, others are more 
prevalent in women, and others differentially increase 
the risk of stroke in women.57 These results support the 
development of such a score. They also, however, show 
that AF is associated with an increased risk of all cause 
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiac events 
in women relative to men. Therefore, it might be appro-
priate for clinicians to consider more aggressive treat-
ment of risk factors in women with AF as they seem to 
be at higher proportional risk of death and cardiovascu-
lar disease.
With regard to public health policy, these results 
indicate that sex differences in the effect of AF on risk 
of death and cardiovascular disease exist. Conse-
quently, estimation of the global and regional burden 
of AF should be independent of sex. Allocation of
