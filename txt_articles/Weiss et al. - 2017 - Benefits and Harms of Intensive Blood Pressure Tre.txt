Background: Recent guidelines recommend a systolic blood
pressure (SBP) goal of less than 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60
years or older, but the balance of benefits and harms is unclear
in light of newer evidence.
Purpose: To systematically review the effects of more versus less
intensive BP control in older adults.
Data Sources: Multiple databases through January 2015 and
MEDLINE to September 2016.
Study Selection: 21 randomized, controlled trials comparing
BP targets or treatment intensity, and 3 observational studies
that assessed harms.
Data Extraction: Two investigators extracted data, assessed
study quality, and graded the evidence using published criteria.
Data Synthesis: Nine trials provided moderate- to high-
strength evidence that BP control to less than 150/90 mm Hg
reduces mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]
cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]), and stroke (RR, 0.77
[CI, 0.65 to 0.91]). Six trials overall provide low-strength evidence
that lower targets (≤140/85) do not reduce mortality (RR, 0.93
[CI, 0.75 to 1.14]), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]), or
stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 1.07]). However, there were impor-
tant inconsistencies across these studies, and one large trial
showed targeting SBP less than 120 mm Hg in patients at high
cardiovascular risk reduced mortality and cardiac events.
Limitation: Data relevant to frail elderly adults and the effect of
multimorbidity are limited.
Conclusion: Treatment to at least current guideline standards
for BP (<150/90 mm Hg) substantially improves health outcomes
in older adults. There is less consistent evidence, largely from 1
trial targeting SBP less than 120 mm Hg, that lower BP targets
are beneficial for high-risk patients. Lower BP targets did not
increase falls or cognitive decline but are associated with hypo-
tension, syncope, and greater medication burden.

H
ypertension is a very common modifiable risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, af-
fecting up to two thirds of adults older than 60 years
(1). Older adults might also be more susceptible to ad-
verse effects from blood pressure (BP) lowering, includ-
ing falls, fractures, and cognitive impairment. In 2014,
new guidelines increased the treatment goal for adults
aged 60 years or older to a systolic BP (SBP) less than
150 mm Hg (2), but the change was controversial and a
newer trial has further fueled debate (3). We conducted
a systematic review to examine the balance of benefits
and harms of more versus less intensive BP lowering in
adults aged 60 years or older.
METHODS
This article was developed to inform guideline de-
velopment and is part of a larger report commissioned
by the Veterans Health Administration (4). A protocol
describing the review plan was posted to a publicly
accessible Web site before the study was initiated (5).
Data Sources and Searches
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov
from database inception (Appendix A of the Supple-
ment, available at Annals.org). The end search date for
the larger report for the Veterans Health Administration
was January 2015; we updated the MEDLINE search in
September 2016. We also examined the full text of all
studies included in the Joint National Committee on
the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure (2) and the Blood Pressure Lower-
ing Treatment Trialists'Collaboration (6).
Study Selection
We reviewed titles and abstracts, and 2 indepen-
dent reviewers evaluated the full articles for inclusion;
disagreements were resolved through consensus. We
included randomized trials of adults with a diagnosis of
hypertension and mean age of at least 60 years that
directly compared either 2 or more BP targets or more
versus less intensive antihypertensive therapy and that
included 1 or more outcomes of interest (detailed cri-
teria in Appendix B of the Supplement). We excluded
trials directly comparing antihypertensive drugs with

 one another and studies in populations with specific
diagnoses in which medications were used primarily for
effects other than BP lowering (for example, studies of
�-blockade in patients with systolic heart failure or stud-
ies of acute myocardial infarction). We included cohort
studies that reported adverse effects associated with
reductions in BP among patients receiving antihyper-
tensive therapy.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One investigator abstracted data elements from
each study, and a second investigator reviewed entries
for accuracy. Two reviewers independently assessed
the quality of each trial using a tool developed by the
Cochrane Collaboration (7). Disagreements were re-
solved through discussion. Each trial was given an over-
all summary assessment of low, high, or unclear risk of
bias (Appendix C of the Supplement).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Our primary effectiveness outcomes of interest
were all-cause mortality, stroke (fatal or nonfatal), and
cardiac events (myocardial infarction and sudden car-
diac death), all after at least 6 months of treatment. We
examined the following harms: cognitive impairment,
quality of life, falls, fractures, syncope, functional status,
hypotension, acute kidney injury (defined as doubling
of serum creatinine level or need for renal replacement
therapy), medication burden, and withdrawal due to
adverse events. We did not specifically search for
studies reporting well-known drug-specific adverse ef-
fects, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
(ACEI)–induced cough or thiazide diuretic–induced hy-
pokalemia, but we described common adverse events
of intensive therapy leading to higher rates of with-
drawal among trials. The overall strength of evidence
for each outcome was classified after group discussion
as high, moderate, low, or insufficient based on the
consistency, coherence, and applicability of the body
of evidence as well as the internal validity of individual
studies (8).
We conducted study-level meta-analyses to gener-
ate pooled estimates for each outcome after consider-
ing clinical and methodological diversity among stud-
ies. The profile-likelihood random-effects model (9)
was used to combine relative risks (RRs). We assessed
the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity among stud-
ies using the standard Cochran chi-square test, the
I2 statistic (10). All analyses were performed using
Stata/IC 13.1 (StataCorp).
We performed several sensitivity analyses to help
address the heterogeneity of study design and patient
populations. Because studies with a lower mean age
were likely to include patients younger than 60 years,
we conducted separate analyses of studies with a mean
population age of at least 70 years and studies with
inclusion criteria stipulating entry age of at least 60
years to ensure that results were consistent. We ana-
lyzed studies according to baseline BP to compare
treatment effects among patients with moderate to se-
vere hypertension (SBP ≥160 mm Hg) versus those with
mild hypertension (SBP <160 mm Hg), and we analyzed
studies according to achieved BP (SBP <140 mm Hg).
We also conducted analyses with and without trials that
achieved minimal between-group differences in SBP
(≤3 mm Hg).
We examined trials specifically comparing blood
pressure targets of SBP less than 140 mm Hg or dia-
stolic BP (DBP) of 85 mm Hg or lower versus higher
targets because these trials most directly address the
incremental benefit of treatment intensification in mild
hypertension. Finally, we examined secondary preven-
tion of stroke by examining BP treatment effects in
studies of patients with prior stroke, but we excluded
those of acute management of stroke (<1 week).
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Of-
fice of Research and Development, Quality Enhance-
ment Research Initiative. The funding source had no
role in study design, conduct, data collection, data
analysis, preparation of the manuscript, or the decision
to submit the manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
From 11 268 titles and abstracts, we identified 330
articles for full-text review. We included 46 publications
representing 21 randomized, controlled trials and 3 co-
hort studies that contained primary data relevant to the
key questions. A flow diagram of the literature yield
and the disposition of included studies is presented in
the Appendix Figure (available at Annals.org).
Eight trials compared BP targets (3, 11–17), and 13
trials randomly assigned patients to more versus less
intensive antihypertensive therapy (18–30). Two of the
trials included only patients with prior stroke and are
considered separately for secondary stroke prevention
(15, 23). Three trials had serious methodological flaws
that placed them at high risk of bias (17, 27, 28),
whereas the other 18 trials were judged to have low
risk of bias. Because we focused primarily on compar-
ing the effects of more versus less aggressive BP low-
ering, we conducted sensitivity analyses without 3 trials
(2 achieved minimal between-group differences in SBP
[≤3 mm Hg], and a third did not report achieved BP)
and found similar results (19, 24, 30). In the following
sections on health outcome effects, we present results
from the remaining 15 trials (Appendix Table 1, avail-
able at Annals.org). The characteristics of the 6 trials
excluded from meta-analysis and the results of the sen-
sitivity analyses are presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the
Supplement.
Treatment of Moderate to Severe Versus Mild
Hypertension
A large body of evidence from 9 trials showed that
intensive BP treatment substantially improved out-
comes in patients with moderate to severe hyperten-
sion (SBP ≥160 mm Hg) (Figure 1). Of the trials of pa-
tients with baseline SBP less than 160 mm Hg, 2 were
treat-to-target trials of patients with well-controlled hy-
pertension that produced discrepant results (3, 11). An-

 other trial (FEVER [Felodipine Event Reduction]), which
tested the effects of felodipine in patients with a base-
line SBP of 158 mm Hg, found substantial reductions in
all 3 outcomes of interest (21). The fourth trial (AD-
VANCE [Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Pre-
terax and Diamicron–MR Controlled Evaluation]) tested
the effects of a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and
a calcium-channel blocker in diabetic patients and
found a reduction in mortality but not in other out-
comes (18).
Achievement of SBP Less Than 140 mm Hg
Overall, studies of patients achieving SBP of above
140 mm Hg had effects similar to those of patients
achieving SBP less than 140 mm Hg, though the reduc-
tion in stroke risk was larger among studies of patients
achieving higher SBP (Figure 1 of the Supplement).
Baseline SBP was at least 160 mm Hg in all 5 studies of
patients achieving the higher SBP. Among the 8 studies
of patients achieving lower SBP, 6 were treat-to-target
studies that are discussed later (3, 11–14, 16). The other
2 studies were the aforementioned FEVER and AD-
VANCE studies that produced discrepant results (18,
21).
Trials Comparing Treatment Targets
Six trials evaluated a total of 41 491 patients and
found that treatment targets of SBP less than 140 mm
Hg or DBP of 85 mm Hg or lower did not reduce mor-
tality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]), cardiac events (RR,
0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]), or stroke (RR Figure 2). Even
though these are large trials with low risk of bias, the
evidence should be considered low-strength because
the results have important inconsistencies, and be-
cause the CIs are relatively wide encompassing the
possibility of both marked benefit and harm.
It is important to consider the individual trials to
better understand the source of inconsistencies. SPRINT
(Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) and the
ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Di-
abetes) trial contribute the most weight to these analy-
ses because of their size and the event rates (3, 11).
Mortality rates were very low in the other 4 trials (12–14,
16), and cardiac event rates were very low in 3 of them
(12, 14, 16).
When we removed SPRINT in additional sensitivity
analyses, effects on mortality (RR, 0.96 [CI, 0.80 to
1.15]; I2 = 0%) were reduced and effects on cardiac

 events (RR, 0.88 [CI, 0.74 to 1.04]; I2 = 4.0%) were no
longer significant, but effects on stroke remained
largely unchanged (RR, 0.74 [CI, 0.56 to 0.99]; I2 =
25.8%). Taken together, SPRINT and the ACCORD trial
contribute the most to the uncertainty about the true
effect of more intensive BP lowering because of their
discrepant results. Both trials compared an SBP target
of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg in
patients with well-controlled hypertension and high
cardiovascular risk, but SPRINT found marked reduc-
tions in mortality and cardiac events, whereas the AC-
CORD trial did not. There are several potential reasons
that the trials produced different results. The ACCORD
trial included only diabetic patients, whereas SPRINT
excluded them; the mean age of participants in the
ACCORD trial was lower (62 vs. 68 years, though the
event rates in both trials were similar); the ACCORD
trial was smaller; and SPRINT was stopped early for ben-
efit, which could have exaggerated treatment effects.
Blood Pressure Targets for Secondary Stroke
Prevention
One trial included only patients with lacunar stroke
and compared SBP targets of less than 130 mm Hg
versus 130 to 140 mm Hg (15). The other trial included
patients with prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or
transient ischemic attack and randomly assigned them
to the addition of an ACEI with or without a diuretic or
to placebo (23). Achieved SBP in both trials was 130 to
140 mm Hg. Pooled analyses showed that more inten-
sive BP management decreased the risk for recurrent
stroke (RR, 0.76 [CI, 0.66 to 0.92]; I2 = 0%) but not car-
diac events (RR, 0.78 [CI, 0.61 to 1.08]) or mortality (RR,
0.98 [CI, 0.85 to 1.19]) (Figure 2 of the Supplement).
Harms
General Adverse Effects and Medication Burden
Ten trials reported withdrawals due to adverse
events: 4 found a significant increase in the intervention
group (most commonly due to cough or hypotension)
(18, 23, 26, 30), whereas 6 did not find an increase (14,
16, 19, 20, 24, 25). Meta-analysis was not possible be-
cause of excess heterogeneity (I2 = 92.1%). In general,
the mean number of medications or the proportion of
participants taking multiple medications was higher in
the intervention groups, though variation in reporting
precludes precise estimates (Appendix Table and Ta-
ble 1 of the Supplement).
Renal Outcomes
We found low-strength evidence from 13 trials that
more intensive BP treatment was not associated with
worse renal outcomes, although outcome definitions
varied across trials; results were inconsistent; and the
rate of significant outcomes, such as end-stage renal
disease, was low (Table 3 of the Supplement). Two tri-
als found an increased risk for acute renal failure with
more aggressive BP lowering (3, 31).
Cognitive Outcomes
We found moderate-strength evidence from 7 ran-
domized, controlled trials that use of antihypertensive
treatment to achieve moderate BP control for up to 5
years does not worsen cognitive outcomes compared
with less strict BP control (Table 4 of the Supplement).
The mean age of trial participants ranged from 62 to 83
years, baseline cognitive function was generally nor-
mal, and patients in all but 1 trial had achieved SBP of
140 to 150 mm Hg (those in 1 trial had achieved SBP of
119 mm Hg). In 4 trials of patients without a history
of cerebrovascular disease, there was no effect on rates
of incident dementia (odds ratio, 0.89 [CI, 0.74 to 1.07])
(32–35). Another trial of patients with a history of stroke
also found no difference in rates of incident dementia
(RR, 0.88 [CI, 0.72 to 1.08]) (34). Among the observa-
tional studies, 2 found that the lowest rates of cognitive
decline were associated with achievement of an SBP of
135 to 150 mm Hg (36, 37) and 140 to 160 mm Hg (38).
Quality of Life and Functional Status
Overall, we found moderate-strength evidence
from prospective substudies of 4 large trials with low
risk of bias that use of antihypertensive therapy to
achieve moderate BP control (SBP of 140 to 150 mm
Hg) was not associated with a deterioration in quality of
life compared with less intensive BP control (39–42).
We found low-strength evidence from 1 large trial with
low risk of bias that moderate BP control was not asso-
ciated with deterioration in functional status compared
with less intensive control (39).
Falls, Fractures, and Syncope
We found moderate-strength evidence from 3
large trials with low risk of bias that more intensive BP
treatment (SBP targets <120 and <150 mm Hg and
achieved SBP <150 mm Hg) did not increase risk for
fracture (43, 44). We found low-strength evidence that
more aggressive BP control did not consistently in-
crease risk for falls. Two of the trials found that very
aggressive BP lowering (SBP <120 mm Hg) did not in-
crease risk for falls (3, 43), whereas a third trial found
that moderate BP control (SBP <150 mm Hg) was asso-
ciated with a small increase in risk for falls (26). We
found low-strength evidence of increased risk for
syncope from more aggressive BP control across 3
trials with achieved SBP ranging from 121.5 to 143 mm
Hg (RR, 1.52 [CI, 1.22 to 2.07]) (Figure 3 of the
Supplement).
The Role of DBP
In 15 trials, patients had isolated systolic hyperten-
sion (SBP >140 mm Hg with DBP ≤90 mm Hg); there
were no trials in which patients had isolated diastolic
hypertension (mean DBP >90 mm Hg and mean
SBP <140 mm Hg). The achieved DBP was less than 90
mm Hg in all trials. The HOT (Hypertension Optimal
Treatment) trial enrolled patients with high DBP (>100
mm Hg) and compared 3 DBP targets (≤80, ≤85, and
≤90 mm Hg) (13). Compared with patients assigned to

 the target of 90 mm Hg or lower, patients assigned to
lower targets had reduced risk for cardiac events (RR,
0.62 [CI, 0.42 to 0.92]) but not for stroke (RR, 0.74 [CI,
0.40 to 1.36]) or death (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.48 to 1.21]). Of
note, achieved DBP was still greater than 80 mm Hg in
each group in the HOT trial. Overall, patients with DBP
greater than 90 mm Hg seem to benefit from BP-
lowering treatment, but these patients also had marked
systolic hypertension at baseline (13, 20–22, 25, 27).
There was no evidence to assess whether treatment of
diastolic hypertension in the absence of systolic hyper-
tension is beneficial.
The only 2 studies of patients with an achieved DBP
less than 70 mm Hg found no increased risk for falls,
fractures, or cognitive impairment. However, risk for
symptomatic hypotension was increased in both trials
(3, 11) and for syncope in 1 trial (3). Whether these
effects were seen primarily in patients with very low
DBP, SBP, or both is unclear.
Modifications by Age and Comorbidity
We found no evidence that age modifies treatment
effects: 12 trials found no age–treatment interactions
on health outcome effects, and 3 trials found that the
rate of harms from more intensive treatment was similar
in persons aged 75 years or older and those younger
than 75 years (Table 5 of the Supplement). One study
found that the direction of association with age varied
by outcome (45).
We found low-strength evidence of greater abso-
lute treatment effects among patients with high cardio-
vascular risk and similar relative treatment effects
across risk groups. Three of 4 studies reported out-
comes according to cardiovascular risk strata and
found higher absolute risk reduction in patients in the
highest-risk strata (46–48). A fourth study found no in-
teraction between risk profile and treatment effect (3).
It is difficult to draw conclusions about treatment
effects in diabetic and nondiabetic patients by using
study-level comparisons because relatively few studies
included only diabetic patients or excluded them and
because there are major differences among these stud-
ies other than diabetes status. Subgroup analyses from
7 studies suggest that diabetic patients are at least
as likely to benefit from BP lowering (Table 6 of the
Supplement).
No studies examined how comorbidity burden
modifies BP treatment effects. Patients with a high bur-
den of comorbidity were probably not included in the
overall group of studies (Table 7 of the Supplement).
Because we excluded trials examining BP medications
for treatment of systolic heart failure or acute myocar-
dial infarction, it is not surprising that 14 trials excluded
patients with heart failure and 11 excluded patients
with recent cardiovascular events. However, 17 trials
excluded patients on the basis of abnormal renal func-
tion criteria; 12 excluded patients with cancer or other
life-limiting illness; 9 excluded patients according to
presence or severity of diabetes; and 15 used criteria
that would implicitly or explicitly exclude patients with
dementia, diminished functional status, or both. In 2
trials (49, 50), treatment effects did not differ according
to frailty status, but these were post hoc analyses and a
large amount of data were missing in 1 of the trials (49).
DISCUSSION
Overall, we found moderate- to high-strength evi-
dence that treatment to current BP targets (<150/90
mm Hg) in patients older than 60 years substantially
reduces mortality, stroke, and cardiac events (Table).
Many of these data come from trials in which the mean
baseline SBP was greater than 160 mm Hg. Lower tar-
gets (SBP <140 mm Hg or DBP ≤85 mm Hg) did not
reduce mortality, cardiac events, or stroke compared
with higher targets (low-strength evidence). There are
few data to directly help distinguish benefits of SBP of
140 versus 150 mm Hg. Most of the trials of patients
achieving SBP less than 140 mm Hg were treat-to-
target trials. Only 1 trial included patients with baseline
SBP of 140 to 150 mm Hg, and it found an improve-
ment in mortality but not in other outcomes (18). We
found moderate-strength evidence that more aggres-
sive BP control (SBP <140 mm Hg) in patients with prior
stroke substantially reduced rates of recurrent stroke.
The treat to target trials do not collectively support
a lower BP target in the general older adult population.
However, there are important differences among these
trials, most notably the SPRINT trial which suggests a
lower target may be beneficial in select patients. Sev-
eral issues must be considered in the choice of a lower
target. First, there are tradeoffs that patients may weigh
differently based on their values and preferences.
Tighter control may prevent, on average, roughly 10
events for every 1000 high-risk patients treated over 5
years across a population (Table). However, more ag-
gressive treatment is likely associated with greater
medication burden and higher risk for adverse effects,
such as hypotension and syncope. On the other hand,
we found that lower targets are unlikely to increase the
risk for dementia, fractures, and falls or reduce quality
of life.
Second, inconsistent findings make it more difficult
to apply trial results broadly. The most important incon-
sistencies are between the ACCORD trial and SPRINT,
both of which enrolled patients at high cardiovascular
risk and targeted SBP less than 120 mm Hg but
reached different conclusions (3, 11). It is unclear which
differences in study design or patient population are
responsible for the discrepant findings: The ACCORD
trial included only diabetic patients whereas SPRINT ex-
cluded them, and SPRINT was a larger study with older
patients but was stopped early for benefit.
Third, there is little direct evidence to guide choice
of target within the SBP range of 120 to 140 mm Hg.
A substantial proportion of intervention patients in
SPRINT achieved an SBP of 120 to 130 mm Hg, though
the target was less than 120 mm Hg and the mean
achieved SBP was 121.4 mm Hg.
Fourth, the evidence for lower treatment targets
applies to patients at high cardiovascular risk. SPRINT
enrolled only patients with known cardiovascular dis-

 ease or a 10-year Framingham risk score of at least
15%. Individual patient–level data suggest that the ab-
solute treatment benefits are substantially larger in
those with higher cardiovascular risk (6, 51). The de-
gree to which an individual patient will benefit from
more intensive treatment likely depends on their risk
profile, but existing risk calculators may substantially
overestimate risk and, therefore, the absolute expected
benefit (52).
Finally, it is critical to consider that small variations
in BP measurement technique can have large effects,
though the degree to which these variations change BP
for an individual patient is impossible to predict (53).
Most trial protocols specified measurement of BP while
the patient was seated after 5 minutes of rest; clinicians
should follow similar procedures.

* We estimated events prevented by applying the summary RR from meta-analyses to observed control group event rates that were standardized

contemporary trials for each set of analyses. We used data from HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) (22) to estimate event rates in the
higher baseline BP analyses and from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) (the older age subgroup, because the mean age was
comparable to that in HYVET) for the treat-to-target analyses (50).

 regimens and adverse medication interactions) modify
BP treatment effects. Although recent substudies from
SPRINT and HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly
Trial) suggest that patient frailty does not modify treat-
ment effects (49, 50), few data remain to apply to pa-
tients who are institutionalized, have dementia, or have
significant multimorbidity.
Our review adds to the literature by focusing on
older adults, comprehensively examining short- and
long-term harms, and analyzing studies that directly
compared treatment targets. Prior meta-analyses have
focused on other populations and have not included
newer studies (54, 55). Although these analyses have
found benefit from more aggressive BP treatment, they
also found that most of the benefit was seen in higher-
risk patients or those with higher baseline BPs. A more
recent meta-analysis found that treatment with antihy-
pertensive medication improved outcomes down to an
SBP less than 130 mm Hg and effects did not differ on
the basis of cardiovascular risk, but it included a broad
array of studies, including studies of normotensive pa-
tients (56).
Several
limitations
must
be
considered.
Most
important, the differences among trials in treatment,
patient
population,
and
secular
changes
in
co-
interventions should temper the use of meta-analytic
estimates alone to understand treatment effects; it is
important to consider summary estimates in addition to
a qualitative consideration of trial differences. We em-
phasized analyses based on baseline BP and treatment
target comparisons because we felt that these paral-
leled clinical treatment choices and reliance on analy-
ses based solely on achieved BP can be misleading
(57), but we acknowledge differences of opinion with
regard to these choices. Finally, we were unable to de-
termine how choice of medication class influenced re-
sults, though we did not find a pattern of differential
results according to medication type, which is consis-
tent with a prior individual patient–level meta-analysis
of BP treatment trials (not confined to older adults) (51).
In conclusion, lowering BP in adults older than 60
years reduces mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. The
most consistent and largest effects were seen in studies
of patients with higher baseline BP (SBP ≥160 mm Hg)
achieving moderate BP control (<150/90 mm Hg).
Lower treatment targets (<140/85 mm Hg) may be ben-
eficial for some patients at high cardiovascular risk
based on the findings from 1 trial that targeted SBP less
than 120 mm Hg and in which most intervention pa-
tients achieved SBP less than 130 mm Hg. In patients
with cerebrovascular disease, more aggressive BP low-
ering (SBP <140 mm Hg) likely reduces recurrent
stroke. Lower treatment targets are associated with
higher medication burden and an increased risk for
short-term harms, such as hypotension. On the other
hand, evidence that there is not an increased risk for
cognitive impairment, falls, and reduced quality of life
may provide flexibility for providers in crafting an indi-
vidualized antihypertensive treatment plan. There are
few data to assess the risks and benefits of antihyper-
tensive treatment among institutionalized elderly pa-
tients or those with multiple comorbidities.

 CORRECTION: BENEFITS AND HARMS OF INTENSIVE BLOOD
PRESSURE TREATMENT IN ADULTS AGED 60 YEARS OR OLDER
In a recent review (1), an error in data abstraction affected
some of the meta-analyses’ summary estimates. The numera-
tor from the diabetes subgroup analyses and the denomina-
tor from the total study population in HOT were inadvertently
used. Because more intensive treatment tended to reduce
events in the diabetes subgroup but not in the overall popu-
lation, the net result was that the summary estimates for car-
diovascular, stroke, and mortality event rates were lower (i.e.,
more favorable towards intensive treatment) in the original
analyses including the HOT trial than in the corrected analy-
ses. The summary estimates have been updated; however,
the overall conclusions are largely unchanged except as
noted below.
For the analyses of trials with baseline SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg,
the relative risk (95% CI) of each outcome comparing more to
less intensive treatment changed as follows:
• Mortality changed from 0.90 (0.83–0.98) to 0.93 (0.85–
1.00).
• Stroke changed from 0.74 (0.65–0.84) to 0.77 (0.64–
0.91).
• Cardiac events changed from 0.77 (0.68–0.89) to 0.83
(0.71–0.96).
For the analyses of the treat-to-target trials comparing tar-
gets below 140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 85
mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the relative risk (95%
CI) of each outcome comparing more to less intensive treat-
ment changed as follows:
• Mortality changed from 0.86 (0.69–1.06) to 0.93 (0.75–
1.14)
• Stroke changed from 0.79 (0.59–0.99) to 0.86 (0.64–
1.07)
• Cardiac events changed from 0.82 (0.64–1.00) to 0.91
(0.77–1.04)
The upper bound of the CI increased in the corrected
analyses in all cases. In the analyses examining mortality ef-
fects in trials with higher baseline SBP, the upper bound of the
CI changed from 0.98 to 1.00 in the corrected estimate. As a
result, the strength of evidence for this finding was changed
from “high” to “moderate”. In the treat-to-target trial analyses,
the upper bound of the CI for the stroke outcome increased
from 0.99 to 1.07, so the strength of the evidence for this
finding was changed from “moderate” to “low”.
The original estimates suggested that lower treatment
targets were associated with marginally significant benefits in
cardiovascular events and stroke but not mortality in the treat-
to-target trials. The corrected estimates show no significant
effects for all three outcomes. The strength of evidence for the
treat-to-target trials was assessed as “low”primarily because
there were important differences in results among the trials
and there was a lack of precision in the summary estimate
(with a relatively wide CI spanning both the possibility of large
benefit and potential harm). This uncertainty and inconsis-
tency remains true in the corrected analyses, as does the low
strength evidence rating. The SPRINT trial was originally high-
lighted as the main source of evidence supporting the bene-
ficial effects of lower treatment targets in reducing cardiovas-
cular events and death in patients at high cardiovascular risk;
that also remains true in the corrected manuscript.
In summary, the revised manuscript continues to find
high-strength evidence that treating patients with moderate
to severe hypertension to SBP of at least < 150 mm Hg im-
proves cardiovascular events and stroke and moderate-
strength evidence that it reduces mortality. Analyses of trials
examining the low 140 mm Hg or DBP targets below 85 mm
Hg compared with higher targets show that, overall, there
does not seem to be a significant effect on cardiovascular
events, stroke, or mortality. However, the trial designs and
results are heterogeneous, and the SPRINT trial does suggest
that some patients at high cardiovascular risk benefit from
lower rather than higher targets.
