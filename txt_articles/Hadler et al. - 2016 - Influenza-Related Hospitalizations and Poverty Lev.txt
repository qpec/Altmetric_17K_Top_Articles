Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons 
aged ≥6 months in the United States, with recognition that 
some persons are at risk for more severe disease (1). However, 
there might be previously unrecognized demographic groups 
that also experience higher rates of serious influenza-related 
disease that could benefit from enhanced vaccination efforts. 
Socioeconomic status (SES) measures that are area-based can 
be used to define demographic groups when individual SES 
data are not available (2). Previous surveillance data analyses 
in limited geographic areas indicated that influenza-related 
hospitalization incidence was higher for persons residing in 
census tracts that included a higher percentage of persons living 
below the federal poverty level (3–5). To determine whether 
this association occurs elsewhere, influenza hospitalization 
data collected in 14 FluSurv-NET sites covering 27 million 
persons during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 influenza seasons 
were analyzed. The age-adjusted incidence of influenza-related 
hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years in high poverty 
(≥20% of persons living below the federal poverty level) census 
tracts was 21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7–22.4), 
nearly twice the incidence in low poverty (<5% of persons 
living below the federal poverty level) census tracts (10.9, 95% 
CI: 10.3–11.4). This relationship was observed in each surveil-
lance site, among children and adults, and across racial/ethnic 
groups. These findings suggest that persons living in poorer 
census tracts should be targeted for enhanced influenza vac-
cination outreach and clinicians serving these persons should 
be made aware of current recommendations for use of antiviral 
agents to treat influenza (6).
Influenza causes annual epidemics in the United States 
resulting in an estimated 4,900–27,000 deaths and 114,000–
624,000 hospitalizations per year (7). Influenza vaccination 
recommendations have evolved from focusing on persons at 
higher risk for severe disease and influenza-associated com-
plications to a recommendation for vaccination of all persons 
aged ≥6 months (1). In addition to the recommendation for 
universal influenza vaccination, enhancing vaccination efforts 
in specific demographic groups that experience higher rates of 
serious influenza-related disease can reduce their vulnerability 
and minimize disparities.
Influenza surveillance data have generally not included 
individual measures of SES. Thus, any potential association

between influenza, particularly severe disease, and SES was 
unmeasured until area-based SES measures began to be used. 
During 1998–2005, the Public Health Disparities Geocoding 
Project recognized the potential for using area-based SES mea-
sures to describe and monitor the association between SES and 
reportable disease incidence. After comparing numerous pos-
sible area-based SES measures to describe SES disparities for 
selected health outcomes, the census tract poverty level of case 
residence was recommended to be used as a variable in addi-
tion to age, sex, and race/ethnicity in routine surveillance data 
analyses (2). During 2003–2005, the 10 Emerging Infections 
Programs (EIP)* established active surveillance for influenza-
related hospitalizations. Analyses of data from New Haven 
County, Connecticut, and eight counties in Tennessee indicated 
that, during multiple influenza seasons, including those when 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated, influenza-related 
hospitalization incidence was consistently higher for children 
and adults residing in census tracts with higher percentages of 
persons living below the federal poverty level (3–5).
To assess the association between census tract-level poverty 
and influenza hospitalization at a national level, participating 
sites in the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network 
(FluSurv-NET), including all 10 EIP sites, participated 
in a multisite analysis. FluSurv-NET is a national sentinel 
surveillance system established in 2009 that conducts popu-
lation-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-
associated hospitalizations annually during October–April. 
For this analysis, data were gathered from 78 counties in 14 
FluSurv-NET states† representing approximately 9% of the 
U.S. population. Each site geocoded the residential address 
of all influenza-associated hospitalizations for the 2010–11 
and 2011–12 influenza seasons. Geocoded addresses were 
assigned to census tracts. Census tract poverty level, defined as 
the percentage of households in the census tract living below 
the federal poverty level, was determined from the 2008–2012 
American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.§ Census tracts 
were categorized by their percentage of households living below 
the poverty level (<5%, 5%–9%, 10%–19%, ≥20%), and age-
adjusted (2000 U.S. Standard Population) influenza-related 
hospitalization incidence overall and for each FluSurv-NET site 
was calculated, stratified by census tract poverty status. County 
and census tract-specific denominators were determined from 
the 2010 U.S. Census.
In total, 7,936 (96%) of 8,304 influenza-related hospitaliza-
tions were coded to census tract, including 5,624 in 2010–
2011 and 2,312 in 2011–2012. For both seasons combined, 
the age-adjusted incidence of influenza-related hospitalizations

living below the federal poverty level) neighborhoods was 
21.5 (95% CI: 20.7–22.4), nearly twice the incidence in low 
poverty (<5% of persons living below the federal poverty level) 
neighborhoods (10.9, 95% CI: 10.3–11.4), with a gradient of 
increasing incidence as census tract poverty category increased 
(Figure 1). This relationship was observed in all 14 surveil-
lance sites (Table), within groups defined by age (0–4 years, 
5–17 years, 18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥65 years), within 
each racial/ethnic group (Figure 2) and during each influenza 
season. The relationship also was observed for age-adjusted 
rates for hospitalizations requiring intensive care, for those 
requiring mechanical ventilation, and for deaths during or 
within 30 days of hospitalization. The incidence rate ratios 
for census tracts with ≥20% versus <5% of households living 
below the federal poverty level were 1.96 [95% CI: 1.7–2.3] 
for hospitalizations requiring intensive care; 2.03 [95% CI: 
1.6–2.5] for hospitalizations requiring mechanical ventilation; 
and 1.82 [95%CI: 1.3–2.7] for deaths occurring within 30 days 
of hospitalization. The overall percentage of hospitalized 
influenza patients who were vaccinated was inversely associ-
ated with census tract poverty level, from a high of 48% in the 
census tracts with the lowest poverty levels to a low of 35% 
in the census tracts with the highest poverty levels, a finding 
driven by differences in vaccination rates among persons aged 
≥65 years, who accounted for 94% of hospitalized cases in the 
lowest poverty census tracts compared with 80% in the highest.
Discussion
The association of higher census tract-level poverty with higher 
influenza-related hospitalization rates appears to be robust, occur-
ring across counties in 14 states, within pediatric and adult age 
groups, and across racial/ethnic groups. Possible contributing 
factors are lower vaccination rates in residents of poorer census 
tracts, poverty-related crowding with higher rates of influenza 
transmission, and higher prevalence of medical conditions pre-
disposing persons to influenza complications in poorer areas. 
However, differences in vaccination rates cannot fully explain 
all the age-specific differences by census tract poverty observed: 
only hospitalized influenza patients aged ≥65 years had a large 
enough difference in vaccination rates to fully explain the findings. 
Regardless of the causes, to reduce poverty-associated disparities 
in influenza-related hospitalizations, there is a need to increase 
influenza vaccination levels in higher poverty neighborhoods and 
to more fully implement recommendations on the use of antivirals 
in the outpatient setting (6). This will require enhanced efforts by 
public health agencies and health care providers to address missed 
opportunities for vaccination and system barriers (8), as well as a 
better understanding of personal barriers (9) to influenza vaccina-
tion in these neighborhoods. In addition, it will require evaluation 
of use of antivirals and efforts to improve them.
Healthy People 2020 includes a public health infrastructure 
objective (PHI 7.3) to increase the percentage of population-based 
health objectives for which national data are available by socio-
economic status (10). Public heath surveillance data often lack 
information on the SES of individual persons, making it difficult 
to describe and monitor health disparities based on SES. When 
residential address data are available, it is possible to geocode the 
address, link it to census tract SES data and conduct analyses. 
The EIP
, recognizing the potential to use geocoded addresses to 
examine possible SES-related disparities at a broad interstate level, 
formed a health equity workgroup to explore standardizing its use 
in all EIP states (11). This analysis demonstrates that multisite 
analyses using census tract SES can provide national-level data 
that are relevant to prevention efforts.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. 
First, a total of 4% of cases were unable to be geocoded and thus 
were not included in the analysis. Second, the data in the report 
were from two influenza seasons during which influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses predominated. The findings could be different during an 
A(H1N1) season or during an influenza pandemic. However, 
in the single site studies that stimulated this analysis (3–5), the 
association of higher census tract poverty with higher influenza-
related hospitalization incidence was consistent throughout all 
seasons examined, regardless of the dominant circulating strain.

study across FluSurv-NET sites, persons who live in high pov-
erty census tracts are one such demographic group. Enhanced 
influenza outreach to improve influenza vaccination coverage for 
persons living in poorer neighborhoods and efforts to increase 
use of antivirals by clinicians serving these neighborhoods could 
reduce poverty-related disparities in severe influenza outcomes.

Summary
What is already known on this topic?
Measures of socioeconomic status are infrequently used in 
public health surveillance. Several studies in small U.S. geo-
graphic areas found that higher census tract-level poverty is 
associated with higher population-level rates of influenza-
related hospitalization, a finding with possible implications for 
influenza control efforts.
What is added by this report?
A collaborative initiative among 14 states that examined the 
association between census tract-level poverty and incidence of 
influenza-related hospitalization found increasing rates of 
influenza-related hospitalization with increasing census tract 
poverty. This finding was present during two influenza seasons, 
among all 14 sites, all age and racial/ethnic groups, and for 
more severe outcomes of hospitalization (intensive care, 
respiratory support, and death).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Persons who live in high poverty census tracts represent a 
demographic group at higher risk for severe influenza out-
comes. Persons in poorer neighborhoods should be a focus for 
enhanced influenza vaccination outreach and early use of 
antiviral treatment. Analysis of surveillance data using census 
tract-level measures of socioeconomic status can provide new 
perspectives and directions for prevention of diseases of public 
health importance.
