IMPORTANCE Rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) currently
constitutes an unmet need.
OBJECTIVE To test a 1-hour diagnostic algorithm to diagnose AMI using a high-sensitivity
troponin I assay with a new cutoff level of 6 ng/L.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Biomarkers in Acute Cardiac Care study is a
prospective study that investigated the application of the troponin I assay for the diagnosis of
AMI in 1040 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain from
July 19, 2013, to December 31, 2014. Results were validated in 2 independent cohorts of
4009 patients. Final follow-up was completed on July 1, 2015, and data were assessed from
July 2 to December 15, 2015.
EXPOSURE Acute chest pain suggestive of AMI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Accurate diagnosis or exclusion of AMI and 12-month
mortality in patients with acute chest pain.
RESULTS Of the 1040 patients included from the study cohort, 673 (64.7%) were male and
had a median age of 65 (interquartile range, 52-75) years. With application of a low troponin I
cutoff value of 6 ng/L, the rule-out algorithm showed a high negative predictive value of
99.8% (95% CI, 98.6%-100.0%) after 1 hour for non–ST-segment elevation MI type 1. The
1-hour approach was comparable to a 3-hour approach. Similarly, a rule-in algorithm based on
troponin I levels provided a high positive predictive value with 82.8% (95% CI,
73.2%-90.0%). Moreover, application of the cutoff of 6 ng/L resulted in lower follow-up
mortality (1.0%) compared with the routinely used 99th percentile (3.7%) for this assay. Two
independent cohorts further validated the performance of this algorithm with high negative
and positive predictive values.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with possible AMI can be triaged within 1 hour after
admission with no loss of safety compared with a 3-hour approach, when a low and sensitive
cutoff is applied. This concept enables safe discharge or rapid treatment initiation after 1 hour.

E
arly diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in
patientspresentingwithacutechestpainimprovesclini-
cal outcome. Moreover, rapid exclusion of AMI is im-
portant to triage patients in view of limited resources in the
emergency department. Measurement of cardiac troponin lev-
els, as a marker of myocyte necrosis, is essential for diagnos-
ing AMI.1 Compared with sensitive troponin assays, high-
sensitivity troponin assays enhance the accuracy and speed
of the diagnosis,1-4 improve outcome, and are cost-effective.5
Therefore, current European Society of Cardiology guide-
lines recommend the use of high-sensitivity troponin assays
on admission and after 3 hours. A value above the 99th per-
centile of the specific assay and a relative rise or fall is the rec-
ommended cutoff for a diagnosis of non–ST-segment eleva-
tion myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).6,7 Recent studies suggest
that AMI can be diagnosed earlier than 3 hours, when values
below the 99th percentile are used as cutoff values. This con-
cept was incorporated into the 2015 European Society of Car-
diology guidelines for NSTEMI as an alternative to the stan-
dardapproach.8Weaimedtodevelopanalgorithmforaccurate
and rapid exclusion and diagnosis of AMI after 1 hour using a
cutoff below the 99th percentile and compare it with the rec-
ommended 3-hour approach.
Methods
Study Overview
The present study investigates the application of a high-
sensitivity troponin I assay in 3 cohorts of patients with acute
chest pain. We aimed to identify an optimal cutoff using tro-
ponin I levels for diagnosing NSTEMI in a cohort of 1040 pa-
tients with acute chest pain suggestive of AMI (the Biomark-
ers in Acute Cardiac Care [BACC] cohort).9 With this cutoff, we
identified or excluded AMI in patients with acute chest pain.
We tested a 1-hour vs a 3-hour algorithm and compared the di-
agnostic accuracy of the calculated lower cutoff vs the 99th
percentile and evaluated follow-up mortality. We then vali-
dated this lower troponin cutoff level in 2 independent co-
horts, including the 2-Hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to
Assess Patients With Chest Pain Symptoms Using Contempo-
rary Troponins as the Only Biomarker trial (ADAPT)10 and Ad-
vantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndrome Evalua-
tion Study (APACE)11 with 1748 and 2261 patients, respectively.
The current analysis was prespecified in the BACC study pro-
tocol. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki,12
and the ethics committee of the University Medical Center
Hamburg-Eppendorf approved the study protocol. All pa-
tients provided written informed consent.
BACC Cohort
Study Population and Design
Thisstudyprospectivelyrecruited1040patientspresentingwith
acute chest pain in the emergency department of the Univer-
sity Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from July 19, 2013, to
December 31, 2014. Patients were included if they presented
withacutechestpainand/orothersymptomssuggestiveofAMI,
wereolderthan18years,werewillingtoparticipateinthestudy,
andwereabletogivewritteninformedconsent.Allpatientsun-
derwent a routine clinical assessment as described in the cur-
rent European Society of Cardiology guidelines.6 Blood was
drawn directly at admission, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours. A
primary diagnosis of AMI was adjudicated according to cur-
rent guidelines6 based on a high-sensitivity troponin T assay
(Elecsys;RocheDiagnostics).Thefinaldischargediagnosisused
fortheindexeventwasadditionallybasedonallavailableclini-
cal, laboratory, and imaging findings in the course of the hos-
pital stay. Two cardiologists (J.T.N. and N.A.S.) who were un-
aware of the study troponin I data adjudicated the diagnosis
independently. If the adjudicators disagreed about the diagno-
sis, a third cardiologist (D.W.) refereed. Moreover, NSTEMI type
1 or 2 was diagnosed based on the third universal definition of
myocardial infarction.7 More detailed study-specific assess-
ment is available in eMethods in the Supplement.
Definition of the Best-Performing Troponin I Cutoff
The troponin I level was determined using a high-sensitivity
troponin I immunoassay (ARCHITECT i2000SR; Abbott Diag-
nostics). The limit of detection for the assay was 1.9 (range,
0-50 000) ng/L. The assay had a 10% coefficient of variation
at a concentration of 5.2 ng/L. Intra-assay and interassay co-
efficientsofvariationofthisassaywere4.26%and6.29%.13The
99th percentile was 27 ng/L in the general population.14 This
assay was used in all 3 studies (BACC, ADAPT,10 and APACE11).
We defined the optimal troponin I cutoff level to exclude
NSTEMI using values of 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.2 (for the 10% coefficient
of variation), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, and 27 (as the 99th percen-
tile of this assay) ng/L. The cutoff level with the combination
ofthehighestnegativepredictivevalue(NPV),maximumnum-
ber of individuals with AMI excluded, exceeding the 10% co-
efficient of variation of 5.2 ng/L, and being an integral num-
ber was considered optimal.
Troponin I Algorithm
ExclusionofNSTEMIwasdefinedbyatroponinIlevellessthan
6 ng/L (defined as the optimal cutoff in the BACC study) at ad-
mission and after 1 hour or at admission and after 3 hours. For
comparison, we calculated exclusion of NSTEMI using only the
admission value.

ponin I levels were considered: 1 hour after admission a value
Key Points
Question Is it possible to rule out myocardial infarction (MI) after
1 hour using a high-sensitivity troponin I assay with a low cutoff
concentration?
Findings In this diagnostic-test study, a low troponin I cutoff level
of 6 ng/L showed a high negative predictive value of 99.8% after
1 hour for non–ST-segment elevation MI type 1, which was
comparable to a 3-hour approach. Two independent cohorts
further validated the performance of this algorithm.
Meaning Patients with suspected acute MI can be triaged within
1 hour after admission and with no loss of safety compared with a
3-hour approach, when a low and sensitive cutoff was applied.

evated but nondynamic troponin I values.
Follow-up
Follow-upmortalityisreported12monthsafteradmission.The
median follow-up time for mortality was 313 days. Final fol-
low-up was completed on July 1, 2015.
Independent Validation Cohorts for the Algorithm
TheBACCstudyderivedthe1-houralgorithmtoexcludeand/or
identify AMI, which was validated in 2 independent cohorts.
The first cohort is from the ADAPT study10 and consists of 1748
patients with suspected AMI who presented at the emer-
gency department. Troponin I levels were measured on ad-
mission and after 2 hours, which was not the same time point
as in our study. Moreover, we used a second validation cohort
of2261patientswithsuspectedAMI.Thiscohort(APACE)11was
described recently, and troponin I levels were measured at ad-
mission and 1 hour.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from July 2 to December 16, 2015. Con-
tinuous variables are described by quartiles; categorical vari-
ables, as absolute numbers and percentages. Different binary
diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of NSTEMI or NSTEMI type
1wereconsideredasdescribedabove.Fifty-sevenpatientswith
STEMI were excluded, because biomarker measurements are
not relevant for this diagnosis. The diagnoses compared were
NSTEMI (or NSTEMI type 1) vs non-AMI, the latter consisting
of cardiac noncoronary chest pain, noncardiac chest pain, un-
stable angina pectoris, and stable angina. For the binary tests,
sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were computed, to-
gether with exact binomial 95% CIs. The analyses were addi-
tionally performed for different subgroups. We separated pa-
tients by age (<75 or ≥75 years), hypertension (yes or no), heart
failure (yes or no), atrial fibrillation (yes or no), sex (male or
female), history of coronary artery disease (yes or no), his-
tory of AMI (yes or no), and renal function (estimated glomer-
ularfiltrationrate<45or≥45mL/min/1.73m2).Totestforequal-
ity of predictive values, we used the methods of Kosinski.16

Results
Baseline Demographics
We included 1040 patients with a median age of 65 (interquar-
tile range, 52-75) years; 673 patients (64.7%) were male and
367(35.3%)werefemale(Table1).Ofallpatients,184wereclas-
sified as having NSTEMI, 57 as having STEMI, and 799 as hav-
ing non-AMI. Patients with STEMI were excluded from the
cutoff definition. The median time from admission to the first
troponin I assay was 22 minutes; to the 1-hour measurement,
84 minutes.
Cutoff Definition
The best performing cutoff value was calculated to be 6 ng/L.
The NPV was 99.8% (95% CI, 98.6%-100.0%) with only 1 false-
negative finding for NSTEMI type 1; the NPV was 99.0% (95%
CI, 97.5%-99.7%) with 4 false-negative findings for all pa-
tients with NSTEMI. This cutoff value exceeds the level for the
10% coefficient of variation of 5.2 ng/L, which is an impor-
tant measure of assay precision (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Using the Troponin I Cutoff Level to Exclude AMI
When we used the 1-hour algorithm with 2 consecutive mea-
surements of troponin I levels, the NPV for NSTEMI type 1 af-
ter 1 hour was 99.8% (95% CI, 98.6%-100.0%); after 3 hours,
100.0% (95% CI, 98.5%-100.0%) (Table 2). When all patients
with NSTEMI underwent analysis (not stratified according to
type 1 or 2), 406 patients (39.0%) could be discharged; of these,
4 (1.0%) had false-negative findings, resulting in an NPV of
99.0% (95% CI, 97.5%-99.7%). For comparison, when only the
first measurement of troponin I levels directly after admis-
sion was used to rule out AMI, the NPV was 97.1% (95% CI,
95.2%-98.4%). However, 14 of 489 patients (2.9%) had false-
negative findings. The application of the 99th percentile as a
cutoff (27 ng/L) for exclusion resulted in substantially lower
NPVs after 1 hour (94.8%; 95% CI, 93.0%-96.3%) and after 3
hours (97.0%; 95% CI, 95.5%-98.1%) compared with 6 ng/L.
Confounding Factors to Exclude AMI
Different subgroups underwent analysis to assess the effect of
sex (eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement), age, kidney function,

coronary artery disease, history of AMI, and hypertension on
the outcome (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). We found no sig-
nificant differences between most subgroups when compar-
ing the NPV and PPV. Only the presence of atrial fibrillation re-
sulted in a significantly reduced PPV after 1 and 3 hours.
Nevertheless, the NPV was still relatively high, at 96.1% and
97.8%, respectively. The presence of reduced kidney func-
tion, history of coronary artery disease, AMI, heart failure, and
hypertension and being older had no significant effect on the
NPV or the PPV.
Using the Troponin I Cutoff Level to Diagnose AMI
The PPV was 82.8% (95% CI, 73.2%-90.0%) using the 1-hour
algorithm and 78.6% (95% CI, 69.8%-85.8%) after 3 hours for
patients with NSTEMI type 1 (Table 3). For all patients with
NSTEMI, application of this algorithm achieved a PPV of 87.1%
(95% CI, 79.6%-92.6%) after 1 hour and 84.6% (95% CI, 78.0%-
89.9%) after 3 hours. When a relative delta of 20% was used,
the PPV for patients with NSTEMI was 39.9% (95% CI, 33.4%-
46.7%) after 1 hour and 40.1% (95% CI, 34.4%-46.0%) after 3
hours (eTable 4 in the Supplement). With a higher absolute
delta of 18 ng/L, the PPV was 88.2% (95% CI, 80.4%-93.8%)
after 1 hour and 88.7% (95% CI, 82.2%-93.4%) after 3 hours.
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is
shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.
Validation of the Algorithm in 2 Independent Cohorts
In the first validation cohort (ADAPT10), which included a
2-hourdiagnosticalgorithmfor1748individuals,249NSTEMIs
were observed (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement). The NPV
directly after admission was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.1%-99.9%) and
improved to 99.7% (95% CI, 99.2%-99.4%) after 2 hours. Using

The second validation cohort (APACE11) included 2261
patients with 429 NSTEMIs and used a comparable 1- and
3-hour algorithm. The NPV at baseline was 98.6% (95% CI,
98.6%-99.2%) and improved to 99.2% (95% CI, 98.4%-
99.2%) and 99.1% (95% CI, 97.1%-99.8%) after 1 and 3 hours,
respectively. The PPV after 1 hour was 80.4% (95% CI, 75.1%-
84.9%); after 3 hours, 68.8% (95% CI, 59.2%-77.3%). Both
cohorts analyzed NSTEMI as the final diagnosis and did not
differentiate between NSTEMI types 1 and 2.
Secondary Events During Follow up
Patients in the BACC cohort were followed up for 12 months
(Figure 1A). During the follow-up period, 4.2% of the overall
population died. The 12-month mortality rate among the rule-
out population was 1.0% (4 patients). The mortality rate was
significantlyhigherinpatientswithNSTEMI(7patients[6.7%])
andinthegray-zonegroup(31[8.2%];eachP < .001)(Figure2).
The difference between rule-in and gray-zone groups did not
reach statistical significance. We found no change in mortal-
itywhenexclusionofAMIwascalculatedbya1-comparedwith
a 3-hour approach. When we used the 99th percentile cutoff,
mortality in the rule-out group was significantly higher, at 22
patients (3.7%) compared with the suggested troponin I level
cutoff of 6 ng/L after 1 hour (P = .001) (Figure 1B).
Discussion
The primary finding of this study is that a rapid 1-hour algo-
rithm with a troponin I level cutoff lower than the routinely
used 99th percentile enables safe diagnosis of AMI. This cut-
off enables a rapid triage that excludes AMI and a faster ini-
tiation of evidence-based treatment for patients diagnosed as
having AMI. Results using the 1-hour algorithm were compa-
rable (ie, not inferior) to those of the 3-hour algorithm. The tro-
ponin I cutoff level of 6 ng/L performed significantly better
compared with the 99th percentile in view of increased accu-
racy and a lower rate of mortality during follow-up.
Diagnosing AMI
Patients presenting with acute chest pain at the emergency de-
partment make heavy use of limited medical resources. There-
fore,theneedforfastbutsafedecisionmakingisurgent.Arapid
discharge might result from a single high-sensitivity tro-
ponin I assay finding.18-20 As recently shown by Shah et al,19
this single-measurement approach enables a safe exclusion of
AMIwithonly0.4%false-negativefindings.Inthatstudy,how-
ever,themediantimefromadmissionuntilbloodsamplingwas
54minutes,whichmightexplainwhypatientswithaveryearly
presentation were still detected. To prevent a premature dis-
charge of patients at high risk for future ischemic episodes, es-
pecially when patients with recent onset of chest pain (within
2 hours) are taken into account, consecutive measurements
might be crucial.21 An approach using 2 consecutive measure-
ments increases sensitivity and specificity, although prolong-
ing the time until the final diagnosis can be made. Herein we
show that the accuracy of the 1-hour approach was compa-
rable to the 3-hour approach. Both approaches were superior
to a single on-admission determination. The 1-hour approach
doesnotyetintegrateanyclinicalmeasurementsuchaselectro-
cardiography,whichwillfurtherincreasethesafetyofthisrule-
out strategy.
The rule-in algorithm identified patients with a high ac-
curacy after 1 hour, comparable to a 3-hour approach with pre-
served specificity. This approach prevents inappropriate cost-
intensive management, which includes possibly harmful
coronary angiographies. The algorithm performed evenly well
in clinically important subgroups, whereas only atrial fibril-
lation had an effect on the PPV.
The validation of our algorithm in other cohorts (ADAPT
and APACE) demonstrated similar high performance by inte-
grating all available cohorts with shorter than the guideline-
recommended rule-out window with this specific troponin I
assay. Results of this validation testing strengthen the con-
cept of a rapid rule out after 1 hour only, which is now recom-
mended by the NSTEMI European Society of Cardiology guide-
lines as an alternative to the standard 3-hour approach.8
Cutoff Definition
Guideline-based cutoff values to rule out AMI were derived
from the 99th percentile of a specific troponin assay mea-
sured in the healthy population. These assays were character-
ized as sensitive assays, defined by a coefficient of variation
near the 99th percentile. Imprecision was relatively high with
values below the coefficient of variation. The current high-
sensitivity assays, in which precision is high at low cutoff val-
ues, are different.
Todetermineavalidalgorithm,wecalculateddifferentcut-
off values to identify the best-performing one. These calcula-
tions resulted in a troponin I cutoff level of 6 ng/L. This cutoff
value was higher than that for the 10% coefficient of varia-
tion as a marker of imprecision of this specific troponin assay.
For comparison we used a cutoff based on the 99th percentile
of the troponin I assay. Many patients with the final diagnosis

of AMI were not identified by the 99th percentile cutoff and
would have been discharged without the correct diagnosis in
our study.
Secondary Events During Follow-up
The 1- and 3-hour algorithms using a cutoff value of 6 ng/L re-
sulted in lower mortality than the 99th percentile cutoff, and
mortality using the 1-hour algorithm was identical to that of
the 3-hour algorithm. Patients diagnosed as having NSTEMI
by our algorithm had a significantly higher mortality. Highest
mortality was observed in the gray-zone group. This group of
patients with continuously elevated but stable troponin lev-
els, which are not necessarily related to coronary disease, re-
quires thorough monitoring and reevaluation.
Strengths and Limitations
An important strength of this study is the application of 2
contemporary high-sensitivity troponin assays. The tro-
ponin T assay was used for the final diagnosis with other
available and recommended tools, such as electrocardiog-
raphy, cardiac imaging, and coronary angiography, as well as
clinical judgement. In contrast, only the troponin I assay was
used for the rule-out and rule-in algorithms. Furthermore,
the algorithm was extensively validated using 4009 patients
from different geographical regions in other diseases
cohorts. Nevertheless, the values presented herein are assay
specific and cannot be applied to other assays without addi-
tional studies.
Conclusions
The application of a 1-hour algorithm with a troponin I cutoff
level of 6 ng/L in patients with suspected AMI allows for ac-
curate and rapid exclusion and identification of AMI. The 1-
and 3-hour approaches yielded results that were not statisti-
callydifferent,whereasthe1-hourapproachwouldallowfaster
diagnosis or discharge. A low cutoff performed significantly
better than the 99th percentile as cutoff in view of follow-up
mortality.
