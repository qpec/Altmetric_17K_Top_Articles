SUMMARY
Numerous genes and molecular pathways are impli-
cated in neurodegenerative proteinopathies, but their
inter-relationships are poorly understood. We sys-
tematically mapped molecular pathways underlying
the toxicity of alpha-synuclein (a-syn), a protein cen-
tral to Parkinson’s disease. Genome-wide screens in
yeast identified 332 genes that impact a-syn toxicity.
To ‘‘humanize’’ this molecular network, we developed
a computational method, TransposeNet. This inte-
grates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with
homology assignment through sequence, structure,
and
interaction
topology.
TransposeNet
linked
a-syn to multiple parkinsonism genes and druggable
targets through perturbed protein trafficking and ER
quality control as well as mRNA metabolism and
translation. A calcium signaling hub linked these pro-
cesses toperturbed mitochondrial quality control and
function, metal ion transport, transcriptional regula-
tion, and signal transduction. Parkinsonism gene
interaction profiles spatially opposed in the network
(ATP13A2/PARK9 and VPS35/PARK17) were highly
distinct, and network relationships for specific genes
(LRRK2/PARK8, ATXN2, and EIF4G1/PARK18) were
confirmed in patient induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC)-derived neurons. This cross-species platform
connected diverse neurodegenerative genes to pro-
teinopathy through specific mechanisms and may
facilitate patient stratification for targeted therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Common neurodegenerative diseases result in the loss of
distinct neuronal populations and abnormal accumulation of
misfolded proteins. Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s
disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system
atrophy, are associated with abnormal intracellular aggregation
of alpha-synuclein (a-syn). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associ-
ated with beta-amyloid (Ab) and tau accumulation, while amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with altered localiza-
tion and accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43).
The richest source of hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of
these diseases has derived from neuropathology of postmortem
brain. While providing pivotal insights, these observations are
made decades after disease inception.

 A revolution in human genetic analysis over the last 20 years
has uncovered disease-causing mutations that connect protein
misfolding to the neurodegenerative process. For instance, point
mutations and gene multiplication at the a-syn (SNCA) locus lead
to rare but early-onset, highly penetrant forms of PD and demen-
tia. Common polymorphisms in regulatory regions of the SNCA
locus that increase gene expression confer increased risk for
late-onset PD (Fuchs et al., 2008; Nalls et al., 2014). These studies
enabled the creation of animal and cellular disease models and
enriched our understanding of disease mechanisms. However,
with this knowledge, a new set of challenges has emerged.
First, seemingly disparate genes have been tied to particular
clinical phenotypes. For example, parkinsonism is characterized
by slowness (bradykinesia), rigidity, tremor, and postural insta-
bility. The most common form is PD, defined by a-syn pathology
and loss of dopaminergic neurons. However, numerous other
disease entities—tied to distinct genetic signatures and neuro-
pathology—can lead to parkinsonism, demonstrating that there
is not a simple correspondence among genotype, neuropa-
thology, and clinical presentation (Martin et al., 2011; Shulman
et al., 2011; Verstraeten et al., 2015). Those few genetic loci
with parkinsonism as the primary clinical phenotype have been
given a numeric ‘‘PARK’’ designation (for example, the SNCA/
PARK1 locus itself and LRRK2/PARK8), but even mutations in
the same gene can produce distinct neuropathology and diverse
clinical presentations (Martin et al., 2011; Rajput et al., 2006;
Shulman et al., 2011; Verstraeten et al., 2015). Understanding
the inter-relationship between genetic risk factors for parkin-
sonism, and their relationship to a-syn itself, is vital for patient
stratification and targeted therapeutic strategies.
Second, human genetic studies have sometimes produced
ambiguous and controversial data. For rare variants, substantial
recent genetic divergence of human populations may render
traditional methods of cross-validation between different popu-
lations unfeasible (Nelson et al., 2012; Tennessen et al., 2012).
Inconsistencies in the literature abound; for example, studies
implicating UCHL1 as ‘‘PARK5’’ and the translation initiation
factor EIF4G1 as ‘‘PARK18’’ have failed to reproduce. For com-
mon polymorphisms, the challenge is distinguishing between
multiple candidate gene loci in linkage to a SNP. It is becoming
clear that biological validation will be required to fully establish
which genetic factors are causally related to disease processes
and how (Casals and Bertranpetit, 2012).
One approach to validating candidate gene variants, and un-
derstanding their relationship to proteinopathy, is to systemati-
cally screen the entire genome to identify every gene that
modifies proteotoxicity when overexpressed or deleted. This is
achievable in baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a uni-
cellular eukaryote of unparalleled genetic tractability. Yeast has
proved highly informative for understanding the cytotoxicity
induced by misfolded proteins (Khurana and Lindquist, 2010).
This is not surprising, because human genetic data for neurode-
generative diseases heavily implicate cellular pathways that are
among the most highly conserved in eukaryotic evolution,
including protein homeostasis and quality control, protein traf-
ficking, RNA metabolism, and mitochondrial function (Bra
´ s
et al., 2015; Guerreiro et al., 2015).
Expressing toxic proteins relevant to neurodegeneration in
yeast creates a robust and easily scorable growth and viability
defect amenable to genome-wide phenotypic screening. Toxic-
ities of a-syn, Ab, and TDP-43 have been screened by individu-
ally overexpressing each one of �5,500 open reading frames
(ORFs) that comprise the majority of the yeast genome (Khurana
and Lindquist, 2010; Kim et al., 2014; Treusch et al., 2011; Yeger-
Lotem et al., 2009). These screens have guided the discovery of
cellular pathologies in neurons and animal models (Cooper et al.,
2006; Dhungel et al., 2015; Khurana and Lindquist, 2010; Kim
et al., 2014), provided important insights on the relationship of
genetic modifier data to gene-expression analysis (Yeger-Lotem
et al., 2009), and led to the identification of novel human disease
genes (Elden et al., 2010). Recently, processes pinpointed by
phenotypic screening in a yeast synucleinopathy model led to
the discovery of cellular pathologies in induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with PD due to
mutations at the a-syn locus (Chung et al., 2013). In that study,
integrating high-throughput genetic and small-molecule screens
identified genes and small molecules that could correct pathol-
ogies from yeast to neurons (Chung et al., 2013; Tardiff et al.,
2013, 2014).
Here, we build genome-scale networks of a-syn and other
proteotoxicities by combining a new computational approach
with substantially broader yeast genetic screens. To discover
meaningful molecular connections in yeast and patient-derived
neurons, we develop a TransposeNet algorithm that (1) maps
yeast hits to their human homologs by considering sequence,
structure, and molecular interactions; (2) builds networks by
linking yeast hits and hidden human genes through an optimi-
zation framework based on the prize-collecting Steiner forest
algorithm (SteinerForest Ensemble); and (3) transposes molec-
ular interactions across species from yeast to human, utilizing
the high density of known molecular interactions in yeast to
compensate for the relative sparseness of the human interac-
tome. The networks linked many parkinsonism and neurode-
generative disease risk factors to a-syn toxicity through spe-
cific molecular pathways, most notably vesicle trafficking and
mRNA metabolism.
RESULTS
SteinerForest Ensemble Networks Uncover Biological
Connections between a-Syn Screen Hits
One conventional approach to creating a network from a gene
list is to connect them via known genetic or physical protein-pro-
tein interactions. To illustrate this, we considered 77 genes that
modify a-syn toxicity in our previous overexpression screen
(Tables S1 and S2). Even with the rich yeast interactome, 30
hits were not incorporated into the network (Figure 1A, top).
Moreover, some genes (‘‘hubs’’) occupied a central position in
the network, not because of their importance to proteotoxicity
but because they were connected to more genes. For example,
PMR1 is a hub that has 955 annotated interactions in BioGRID
compared to the median of 70 interactions across the 77 modi-
fiers (Figure 1A, top right; Table S2).
To build more inclusive networks, we adapted the ‘‘Prize-col-
lecting Steiner Forest (PCSF) algorithm,’’ which connects gene
or protein ‘‘nodes’’ through molecular interactions, or ‘‘edges’’
(Huang and Fraenkel, 2009; Tuncbag et al., 2013, 2016)
(Figure 1A, bottom). Edges can include genetic or physical
158
Cell Systems 4, 157–170, February 22, 2017
 interactions or annotated pathways from curated databases
(Szklarczyk et al., 2015) and are refined by minimizing ‘‘cost.’’
Costs increase (1) when a ‘‘prized’’ node (an original hit from a ge-
netic screen) is excluded, (2) when an ‘‘edge’’ connecting two no-
des derives from a low-confidence interaction, or (3) when edges
connect to hubs. To ensure that our PCSFs were not dependent
on specific parameterization, we generated an ensemble of 112
individual forests with different algorithm parameters and created
an averaged, or ‘‘collapsed,’’ representative network through a
maximum spanning-tree algorithm (‘‘SteinerForest Ensemble’’;
Figure 1A, bottom right).
To encompass the largest number of prized nodes while
avoiding unlikely interactions, the PCSF method introduces
‘‘predicted nodes,’’ which are proteins or genes not part of the
original prized hit list, (Figure 1A, green triangles). Predicted no-
des will occur between two nodes within the network. However,
as the final network is a superposition of many different net-
works, these may be at the periphery in the final Ensemble
output. Predicted nodes can add biological value, because
any high-throughput screen will miss many true biological
connections.
When we applied SteinerForest Ensemble to our previous
a-syn overexpression screen data, the fragmented networks
became more coherently connected. All 77 modifier genes
were now incorporated in the network, (Figure 1A, bottom right;
Tables S1 and Table S3; Data S1). By penalizing the exclusion

(A) SteinerForest Ensemble methodology versus conventional approach. 77 genetic modifiers (‘‘hits’’) from a previous overexpression screen against a-syn
toxicity are mapped to the yeast interactome. The conventional approach misses 30 genetic hits and overemphasizes ‘‘hub’’ genes like PMR1. SteinerForest
Ensemble includes all 77 hits and predicts additional nodes of biological relevance, including the druggable targets Rsp5 and Calcineurin (Cnb1).

 of genetic modifiers and the inclusion of hubs, the PCSF algo-
rithm favored the biological context at the expense of hubs. To
establish specificity of the network output, we generated ensem-
bles of forests from 1,000 sets of 77 genes randomly chosen
from the yeast genome with identical connectivity (degree distri-
bution) to the a-syn modifier list. An empiric p value for each
node (based on probability of occurring in a network by chance)
was significant (p = 0.025, SD = 0.021).
Importantly, predicted nodes (Figure 1A, green triangles)
included genetic modifiers of a-syn toxicity not hit in the original
screen but uncovered through other studies, including Sec14
(phospholipase D) (Outeiro and Lindquist, 2003), and Pbp1
(yeast homolog of ataxin 2; see below and Figure 3). This network
also identified two druggable targets: Cnb1 (Calcineurin subunit
B) and Rsp5 (Figure 1A, bottom right). Cnb1 is targeted by
FK506, a drug that ameliorates a-syn toxicity (Caraveo et al.,
2014). Rsp5 is the target of a specific N-arylbenzimidazole
(NAB) that protects against a-syn toxicity (Tardiff et al., 2013).
The
SteinerForest
Ensemble
methodology
thus
connects
genetic screen hits through biologically relevant pathways,
including druggable targets.
Cross-Comparison of a-Syn, TDP-43, and Ab
Proteinopathies Reveals Distinct and Shared
Mechanisms
To cross-compare different proteinopathies, we examined previ-
ous Ab and TDP-43 overexpression screens (Figure 1B; ‘‘yeast
over-expression networks’’ in Table S1; Data S1) and found virtu-
ally no overlap (Figure 1B, left; Table S2). There was, however, re-
assuring overlap between the yeast genetic modifiers and disease
genes associated with the human disorders, including putative
parkinsonism genes recovered in the a-syn screen (ATP13A2
[PARK9] and EIF4G1 [PARK18]), AD risk factors in the Ab screen
(PICALM, CD2AP, INPP5D, and RIN3), and an ALS genetic risk
factor (ATXN2) in the TDP-43 screen (Elden et al., 2010).
SteinerForest Ensembles from these screen hits revealed
more biological overlap between these proteinopathies including
protein trafficking, mRNA translation, ubiquitination, and cell-cy-
cle genes (Tables S3 and S4; Figure 1B, right). There was also a
crossover between genetic risk factors for distinct human dis-
eases: the ATXN2 homolog was a predicted node in the a-syn
network (confirmed as a modifier of a-syn toxicity; Figures 3
and 4), and the homolog of the parkinsonism gene VPS35
(PARK17) was a predicted node in the yeast Ab network.
VPS35 encodes a key component of the retromer complex,
and defective retromer function has been identified in AD brain
and animal models (Small et al., 2005). These overlaps were un-
related to increasing the number of genes. Empirical p values for
1,000 similarly connected random networks were statistically
significant, whether considered pairwise (p % 0.002) or triple-
wise (p % 0.001).
One trafficking gene predicted to be a common node be-
tween all three proteinopathies was Rsp5, a ubiquitin ligase
activated by NAB. Indeed, NAB was originally recovered in a
small-molecule screen against TDP-43 proteinopathy in yeast.
We utilized a sensitive bioscreen assay to test NAB on growth
defects induced by these proteinopathies. NAB rescued all
three proteinopathies as predicted by the network. It was
most effective for a-syn (Figure 1C) and only rescued against
Ab toxicity synergistically in combination with other compounds
known to protect from Ab toxicity (unpublished data). NAB failed
to provide significant rescue for 20 unrelated toxic yeast strains
(Figure S1).
TransposeNet Generates a ‘‘Humanized’’ Network
It would be desirable to identify connections between our yeast
molecular networks to human genes, including human disease
genes that have no straightforward homologs in yeast. We there-
fore developed TransposeNet, a suite of computational methods
to ‘‘humanize’’ yeast molecular networks (Figure 2A).
The first step in TransposeNet is assignment of yeast-to-hu-
man homology by considering sequence similarity (BLAST
and DIOPT scores; Hu et al., 2011), yeast-to-human structure
alignments (using the HHpred tool; So
¨ ding et al., 2005), and
incorporating network topology (Figure 2A, top left). Network to-
pology assesses neighborhoods of genetic and physical molec-
ular interactions around a given protein, positing ‘‘guilt-by-asso-
ciation’’ logic that the topological place within a network relates
to biological function (Cho et al., 2016). Thus, sharing similar
neighbors should be a factor in determining whether two pro-
teins are homologs. The relative weight of each homology
method was carefully tuned (see STAR Methods and Figure S2
for full details), providing a more comprehensive and unified
protein homology score (Berger et al., 2013; Singh et al.,
2008; So
¨ ding et al., 2005). The underlying framework that re-
lates genes according to these different features is known as
diffusion-component analysis (DCA). DCA has also been used
as the core algorithm in Mashup, a tool for integrating multiple
hetergeneous interactomes. More information can be found in
the Method Details section of STAR Methods and in Cho
et al., (2016).
Our method assigned 4,923 yeast proteins to human homo-
logs and conversely predicted yeast homologs for 15,200 human
proteins, a substantial improvement over BLAST (4,023 yeast to
human and 7,248 human to yeast) or BLAST with HHpred (4,312
yeast to human and 9,577 human to yeast). Additionally, our
method improved predictions as determined by gene ontology
(GO) accuracy and Jaccard similarity scores (STAR Methods;
Figure S3) and did not introduce false positives for high-confi-
dence yeast-human protein pairs (EnsemblCompara; STAR
Methods).
There is high conservation of core eukaryotic biology from yeast
to man, and pivotal complementation studies in yeast have deter-
mined the functions of many genes in other species, including hu-
man (Osborn and Miller, 2007; Kachroo et al., 2015). On this basis,
we used our homology tool to augment the human interactome
with interactions inferred from the much richer yeast interactome.
This was the key advance that enabled TransposeNet. Impor-
tantly, this cross-species ‘‘edge’’ transposition did not increase
the rate of false-positive hits; rather, it substantially improved
network performance. In fact, for our screen hits the PCSF-based
SteinerForest Ensemble outperformed two alternative network-
building methodologies, DAPPLE (Rossin et al., 2011) and PEXA
(Tu et al., 2009) (STAR Methods; Figure S4).
In our humanized networks (indexed in Table S1; Figure 2A,
right), each yeast gene (red triangle) is connected to one or more
human homologs (blue circles) based on our homology-tool-
generated score. SteinerForest Ensemble then interconnects
160
Cell Systems 4, 157–170, February 22, 2017
 each resulting human gene or protein, through edges generated
from the human interactome augmented with the humanized
yeast molecular interactome. If a particular human homolog of a
yeast genetic modifier had been implicated as a parkinsonism
gene, a small inclusion weight is given. However, no special pref-
erence was given to any human disease genes other than close
homologs of our yeast hits.
Humanized Network from Overexpression Screen
Connects a-Syn to Other Human Disease Genes
We tested the humanized network approach on the 77 modifiers
from the a-syn overexpression screen (‘‘a-syn over-expression
humanized network’’; Tables S1, S9, and S11; Data S1; Fig-
ure 2A, right). Several predicted human nodes in the resultant
humanized network had no obvious homologs in the yeast pro-
teome, the most striking example being a-syn itself. a-syn was
connected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and
protein trafficking modifiers through a predicted node Ap1b1
(Figure 2A, right), a component of the clathrin adaptor complex
that localizes in the immediate vicinity of a-syn in neurons (Chung
et al., 2017, in this issue of Cell Systems). The emergence of
a-syn in the humanized network strongly indicates that a func-
tional, highly interconnected relationship between our original
yeast genetic hits and a-syn is conserved from yeast to man.
LRRK2 and a-Syn Are Connected through ER Stress and
Vesicle Trafficking
The kinase/GTPase LRRK2, another PD-gene-encoded protein
without an obvious yeast homolog, was centrally incorporated
into the humanized network (Figure 2A, right). We tested the
robustness and specificity of this finding by computationally
generating ensembles of humanized Steiner forests from 1,000
lists of genes that were randomly selected (matching the size of
our original a-syn genetic modifier list). LRRK2 and a-syn
(SNCA) occurred together in 72% of humanized networks gener-
ated through SteinerNet Ensemble from our input list (individually,
SNCA appeared in 86% and LRRK2 in 76% of networks). Neither
was incorporated in any of the humanized networks generated
from Ab or TDP-43 screen hits (‘‘TDP-43’’- and ‘‘Ab’’-‘‘over-
expression humanized networks’’ in Table S1; Data S1). LRRK2

for patient 2; ***p < 0.0001, two-tailed t test).

 and a-syn appeared together in 0/1,000 of the randomly gener-
ated network ensembles. Without transposition of yeast interac-
tion information into our networks, a-syn was peripherally placed
and its connection to Ap1b1 (see above) was lost and LRRK2 was
entirely absent (Figure 2B). Thus, the inclusion of LRRK2 and
a-syn is robust, specific, and dependent upon augmentation of
human networks with yeast interaction data.
LRRK2 was related to the humanized a-syn network through
proteins involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Nsf1 and Rab1a)
and ER quality control (Stub1/Chip/Scar6, Sgk1, and Syvn1),
pathways previously implicated among many others in LRRK2
(Cho et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012) and a-syn (Chung et al.,
2013; Cooper et al., 2006)-induced toxicity. Our data pinpointed
these pathways as key points of convergence. We previously
showed that the A53T mutation and triplication of wild-type
a-syn leads to pathologic accumulation of specific trafficked
proteins in the ER of patient-derived neurons, including Nicastrin
(Chung et al., 2013). Using previously generated LRRK2 mutant
iPSC (Figure S5), we recapitulated this phenotype. As early as
4 weeks after initiating differentiation, Nicastrin accumulated in
the ER of LRRK2G2019S dopaminergic neurons compared to
isogenic mutation-corrected controls (Figure 2C), phenocopying
the previously described pathology in neurons derived from pa-
tients with a-syn mutations. Thus, the humanized a-syn network
correctly predicted convergence of cellular pathologies in
distinct forms of parkinsonism. A Nicastrin trafficking defect
has also been demonstrated in LRRK2 knockout mouse fibro-
blasts (Cho et al., 2014), raising the possibility that the G2019S
mutation may lead to deficiency of a LRRK2-related function in
protein trafficking.
Genome-wide Pooled Overexpression and Deletion
Screens against a-Syn Toxicity
For a more comprehensive view, we executed two additional
genome-wide screens against a-syn toxicity: (1) a genome-
wide deletion screen to identify nonessential genes that,
when deleted, lead to an extreme sensitivity to low levels of
a-syn that would otherwise not be toxic (Figure S6A number
2; Table S5); (2) a pooled screen in which the galactose-induc-
ible overexpression library was transformed en masse into
our a-syn HiTox strain (Figure S6A, number 3; Table S6).
For pooled screens, we sequenced plasmid DNA to identify
genes specifically over- or under-represented under selective
conditions. These are putative suppressors and enhancers of
toxicity, respectively. We compared a similarly transformed
YFP strain as a control. Pooled screens are far more rapid,
and theoretically more sensitive, than individually transforming
each library plasmid into the a-syn strain and measuring
growth.
These screens encompassed tests of approximately 10,000
potential genetic interactions (�5,500 overexpression, �4,500
deletion). After extensive validation of the hits (Figures S6C
and S7B), we recovered 318 genetic modifiers. Very little overlap
existed between the specific genes recovered in the deletion
versus the overexpression screens (Figure 3A). However, we
found considerable overlap in the biological pathways repre-
sented (see network analysis below). 16 modifiers have emerged
in independent work from our laboratory (Caraveo et al., 2014;
Chung et al., 2013) or were identified herein (Table S7). 14 of
these were distinct from our screen hits, leading to a total of
332 genetic modifiers of a-syn toxicity (Figure 3A).
Homologs of PARK and Other Neurodegeneration Genes
Modify a-Syn Toxicity in Yeast
Modifiers of a-syn toxicity included homologs of many known
genetic risk factors for parkinsonism and other neurodegenera-
tive disease phenotypes (Figure 3B; Table S14). These included
genes involved in vesicle trafficking (yRAB7L1, yRAB39B,
ySORL1, ySYNJ1/PARK20, and yVPS35/PARK17), mRNA trans-
lation (yATXN2 and yEIF4G1/PARK18), mitochondrial quality
control
and
function
(yCHCHD2/10),
metal
ion
transport
(yATP13A2), transcriptional regulation (yATXN7), metabolism
(yDHDDS), and signaling (yPDE8B and yPPP2R2B/ATXN12),
among others. Many of these genes, including those at so-called
PARK loci, have been implicated in neuronal pathologies quite
distinct from the a-syn pathology that defines PD. Their recovery
in our screens suggested that mechanisms of neurotoxicity
related to diverse neurodegenerative disease genes might be
shared.
Of the 19 PARK loci, 9 have clear yeast homologs (Table S8).
Four of these emerged in our screens: yATP13A2 (PARK9) (YPK9
in
yeast),
yVPS35
(PARK17)
(VPS35),
yEIF4G1
(PARK18)
(TIF4631, TIF4632), and ySYNJ1 (PARK20) (INP53). A fifth puta-
tive PARK gene, yRAB7L1 (PARK16) (YPT7), emerged as a
genetic modifier when tested as a candidate (see below). The
probability of recovering homologs of these genes by chance
is low (p = 0.00013; hypergeometric test). None of these yPARK
genes were modifiers in the Ab or TDP-43 overexpression
screens (Table S2). These findings underscore the biological
specificity of the a-syn screen hits in yeast.
TransposeNet Generates a Genome-Scale ‘‘Map’’ of
a-Syn Toxicity
We applied TransposeNet to homologs of the 332 a-syn toxicity
modifiers to generate a humanized network, or ‘‘map’’ (‘‘Complete
a-syn humanized network’’ in Tables S1, S10, and S11; Figures 3B
and S8; Data S1). Multiple genes implicated in neurodegeneration
emerged in this a-syn network by direct homology to yeast hits or
as predicted network nodes (Figure 3B; Figure S8; Table S14).
We superimposed gene ontologies onto ‘‘branches’’ in our
map (Figure 3B), and various vesicle-mediated transport pro-
cesses dominated. Genetic risk factors associated with typical
PD (SNCA itself, LRRK2, RAB7L1, and VPS35) were concen-
trated in the subnetwork enriched in vesicle trafficking genes
(Figure 3B). In contrast, the majority of neurodegeneration
genes associated with non-Lewy neuropathology, atypical
parkinsonism, or non-parkinsonian neurodegenerative pheno-
types (Table S14) were distant from the vesicle trafficking
network. A full analysis of the biological processes enriched in
the network branches is provided in Table S12. Notably, this hu-
manized network elucidated the molecular context in which the
previously identified druggable targets NEDD4 (Tardiff et al.,
2013) and Calcineurin (Caraveo et al., 2014) impact a-syn
toxicity, and identified the transcription factor NFAT, through
which Calcineurin exerts its toxicity (Caraveo et al., 2014), as
a hub (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, both a-syn itself and LRRK2 were predicted as
nodes, just as in the overexpression network (Figure 2A). In the
162
Cell Systems 4, 157–170, February 22, 2017
 ensemble of Steiner forests generated from our list of 332 mod-
ifiers, a-syn appeared in 100% and LRRK2 in 70%. In 1,000
random sets of 332 genes, even when we forced the incorpora-
tion of five yPARK genes recovered in our genetic experiments
(yPARK9, yPARK16, yPARK17, yPARK18, and yPARK20),
a-syn and LRRK2 appeared together in only 0.6% of humanized
networks. Thus, yeast modifiers of a-syn toxicity generated a
specific humanized network in which the PD-associated proteins
a-syn and LRRK2 emerged as critical network nodes.
TransposeNet generated a coherent network: 295 out of 332
yeast modifier genes were included in a single tree network (Table
S10) with biologically intuitive ‘‘stems’’ comprising genes of similar
ontology (Figure 3B). Networks generated from these 332 modi-
fiers without transposition of yeast interactome data produced
three fragmented networks comprising 136, 2, and 122 yeast
genes, respectively (Figure 3B, inset; Data S1). Genes that should
be related biologically through involvement in common cellular
processes were separated (Figure 3B). Moreover, LRRK2 and
NFAT were not incorporated. Testable hypotheses, such as the
relationship of EIF4G1 to ATXN2 (Figure 5), did not emerge
because these proteins were not included in the same network.
DAPPLE (Rossin et al., 2011) and PEXA (Tu et al., 2009) also
produced highly fragmented or dense ‘‘hairball’’ networks of
limited utility for hypothesis generation (Figure S9) and these algo-
rithms did not incorporate critical nodes like LRRK2 (Figure S9).
Thus, transposition of yeast networks to augment the human

network.
An Endocytic and Retrograde Trafficking Subnetwork in
the a-Syn Toxicity Map Incorporates Yeast Homologs of
RAB7L1 (PARK16) and VPS35 (PARK17)
In the a-syn map, homologs of some parkinsonism genes
coalesced in a sub-network around YPT6, the yeast homolog
of RAB6A (Soper et al., 2011) (Figure 3B). Included were YPT7,
VTH1, and VPS35, which encode proteins involved in endoso-
mal trafficking. YPT7 is a close homolog of RAB7L1, a leading
candidate for the PARK16 locus (MacLeod et al., 2013; Nalls
et al., 2014), and also of the Mendelian parkinsonism risk
factor RAB39B (Wilson et al., 2014). VTH1 is a close yeast
homolog of SORL1, an established AD risk modifier (Rogaeva
et al., 2007) that encodes a protein involved in intracellular
sorting (Nykjaer and Willnow, 2012). VPS35 is homologous
to the Mendelian risk factor for classic PD, VPS35 (PARK17)
(Zimprich et al., 2011). VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 comprise
the retromer complex that transports cargo from endosomal
to Golgi compartments. In our accompanying study (Chung
et al., 2017), we show that deletion of the VSP26 and VPS29
core retromer components strongly enhances a-syn toxicity.
A fourth gene involved in Golgi-to-endosome and endocytic
trafficking, INP53, is homologous to the Mendelian parkin-
sonism gene SYNJ1 (PARK20) (Olgiati et al., 2014). Deletion
of any one of these genes was not toxic in a wild-type strain.
However, deletion of any one of these genes in a strain ex-
pressing low (nontoxic) levels of a-syn produced a strong
and synergistic growth defect (Table S5; Figures 4B and
S10A). Importantly, ectopic expression of yeast or human
VPS35 rescued the toxicity induced by deleting VPS35, but
expression of a disease-causing mutation (VPS35-D620N)
did not (Figure 4C). Finally, yRAB7L1 enhanced a-syn toxicity
when deleted but rescued from this toxicity when overex-
pressed (Figure S10B).

 The a-Syn Map Predicts Diverging Genetic Interaction
Profiles in DPARK9 (ATP13A2)- and DPARK17 (VPS35)-
Sensitized Yeast Models
To test functional consequences of being located in distinct sub-
networks of our a-syn map, we compared VPS35 (PARK17) and
ATP13A2 (PARK9). ATP13A2 is a type 5 P-ATPase implicated in
cation transport and metal ion homeostasis (Kong et al., 2014;
Park et al., 2014; Ramonet et al., 2012; Tsunemi and Krainc,
2014). Mutations in ATP13A2 lead to juvenile-onset parkinsonism
or Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, which is distinct from PD (Schneider
et al., 2010). yATP13A2 suppressed a-syn toxicity in our overex-
pression screen (Figure 1B), and deletion of yATP13A2 strongly
enhanced a-syn toxicity (Figure 4B). In our humanized network,
ATP13A2 was spatially distant from VPS35, lying well outside
the vesicle trafficking subnetwork (Figures 3B and 4A). We asked
whether this spatial separation reflected differences in underlying
biology.
We generated three strains with similar toxicities (Figure 4D).
In one strain, toxicity resulted from overexpression of a-syn
(HiTox). In two other strains, mild toxicity induced by interme-
diate levels of a-syn expression was enhanced by deletion
of yeast ATP13A2 (hereafter, DATP13A2/a-syn) or VPS35
(hereafter, DVPS35/a-syn). These three yeast strains thus
modeled cellular pathologies related to three forms of familial
parkinsonism: two with typical a-syn pathology (PD related
to
a-syn
multiplication
and
VPS35
(PARK17)-associated
parkinsonism) and one with strikingly different pathology
(PARK9 (ATP13A2)).
While DATP13A2 is known to sensitize cells to metal ion stress
(Kong et al., 2014), DVPS35 strains exhibit retrograde trafficking
defects (Seaman et al., 1997), suggesting that DATP13A2 and
DVPS35 strains are differentially sensitized to a-syn toxicity.
We asked whether our 77 a-syn overexpression screen hits
differentially modified the toxicity of our DVPS35/a-syn and
DATP13A2/a-syn models.
We expressed these a-syn toxicity modifiers in each of the
yeast models and monitored growth. For the a-syn HiTox and
DVPS35/a-syn models, 69 out of 77 genes overlapped (Fig-
ure 4E, left), correlating well with the similar pathology associ-
ated with these genetic forms of parkinsonism. Notably, the
overlapping modifiers were enriched in vesicle trafficking genes
(Table S13). In contrast, there were only 3 out of 77 modifiers in
common between a-syn HiTox and DATP13A2/a-syn (Figure 4E,
right). These were involved in iron and manganese homeostasis
(CCC1) and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements (ICY1 and AFI1
(YOR129C)), respectively. Notably, metal ion homeostasis is
strongly implicated in Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (Schneider et al.,
2010) and its mammalian models (Park et al., 2014). Thus, neuro-
degenerative diseases that are genetically, clinically, and neuro-
pathologically distinct may nonetheless share some key molec-
ular pathologies that can be uncovered through genetic network
analysis.
mRNA Translation Subnetwork Links a-Syn to PABPC1,
EIF4G1, and ATXN2
In our overexpression screen against a-syn toxicity, TIF4632
(hereafter yEIF4G1-2) emerged as a suppressor. yEIF4G1-2 is a
yeast homolog of the translational initiation factor EIF4G1. The
genome-wide deletion and pooled overexpression screens identi-
fied additional genetic modifiers related to mRNA translation,
including initiation factors and multiple ribosomal subunits (Fig-
ures 3B and 5A; Tables S5 and S6). These included the homolog
of human PABPC1, PAB1, the ATXN2 homolog PBP1, and the
second EIF4G family homolog in yeast, TIF4631 (hereafter
yEIF4G1-1). Enrichment of these hits in the pooled screen was
confirmed by qPCR (Figure 5B, left), and overexpression of these
genes suppressed a-syn toxicity in bioscreen (Figure 5B, right)
and/or spot (Figure S11) growth assays. Genetic experiments in
different proteinopathy models revealed that the effects of these
modifiers on a-syn toxicity were specific (Figure S11). Thus,
perturbation of mRNA translation in synucleinopathy was not sim-
ply a generic proteotoxic response.
Protein Translation Is Perturbed in PD-Patient-Derived
Neurons
Because we recovered numerous genetic modifiers in the mRNA
translation and mRNA processing pathways (Figures 3 and 5),
weasked whetherproteintranslationwasperturbedincellularsyn-
ucleinopathy models, including PD-patient-derived neurons. Bulk
changes in protein production were assessed by determining the
rate at which S35-radiolabeled methionine and cysteine are incor-
porated into protein over time after a brief ‘‘pulse labeling.’’ Over-
expression of a-syn in HEK cells and primary rat cortical neurons
reducedtheaccumulationofS35-Met/Cyswithoutchangingamino
acid uptake (Figure S12). Similarly, in 6- to 8-week-old iPSC neu-
rons harboring the a-synA53T mutation, S35-Met/Cys incorporation
into protein was reduced compared to isogenic mutation-cor-
rected controls (Figure 5C). Thus, our a-syn screens and network
analysis identified a strong effect of a-syn toxicity on bulk mRNA
translation in cellular models of synucleinopathy. This effect was
not attributable to a canonical ER stress response, because phos-
phorylation of EIF2A (Figures S12D and S13A) and XBP1 splicing
(Figure S13B) was not altered in these neurons.
Conserved Genetic Interactions of ATXN2 and EIF4G1
from Yeast to Patient Neurons
We next tested whether human homologs of two translation fac-
tors that suppressed a-syn toxicity when overexpressed in
yeast, ATXN2 and EIF4G1, could similarly reverse the protein
translation defect in neurons. We generated transcription acti-
vator-like effector transcription factor (TALE-TF) constructs to
transcriptionally upregulate neuronal isoforms of EIF4G1 and
ATXN2 (Sanjana et al., 2012) (Figure 5D, left). These constructs
were then delivered with an adeno-associated viral vector to
differentiated a-synA53T iPSC-derived neuronal cultures.
10 days after transduction, endogenous EIF4G1 and ATXN2
mRNA levels increased by �4-fold, as measured by qPCR (Fig-
ure 5D, right). This increased expression substantially reversed
the defect in bulk protein translation we had observed in
a-synA53T neurons (Figure 5E). Overexpression of EIF4G1
increased translation in A53T neurons, but not in mutation-cor-
rected controls. ATXN2 overexpression equally increased bulk
translation in mutant and control cells (Figure 5E).
Thus, our cross-species molecular network predicted a bio-
logical interaction between a-syn and mRNA translation factors
in PD-patient-derived neurons. These data strengthen the argu-
ment that perturbed mRNA translation is an important aspect of
a-syn toxicity. Interestingly, we identified a strong signature of
Cell Systems 4, 157–170, February 22, 2017
165
 decreased translation of mRNA translation-related transcripts in
ribosomal footprinting experiments of a-synA53T iPSC-derived
cortical neurons at 4 and 12 weeks of differentiation compared
to isogenic mutation-corrected control neurons (Figures S14
and S15; Tables S16, S17, S18, and S19). Indeed, mRNA-related
translation factors, ribonucleoproteins, and ribosomal proteins
were enriched not only in our genetic and translational maps of
a-syn toxicity but also among proteins in the immediate vicinity
of a-syn in neurons (Figure 4 in accompanying manuscript,
Chung et al., 2017; Figure S14A, ‘‘spatial a-syn map’’). More-
over, a number of mRNA translation proteins directly complexed
with a-syn. This convergence of genetic, translational, and
spatial maps suggests the connection between a-syn toxicity
and mRNA metabolism is deeply rooted in a-syn biology.
DISCUSSION
We describe a coherent, systems-level analysis of how a-synmis-
folding and mistrafficking perturbs cell biology. Genome-wide
screens identified modifiers of the toxic consequences of a-syn
expression in baker’s yeast (S. cerevisiae). Our key computational
contribution, TransposeNet, coupled richly annotated molecular
interactions in yeast with a Steiner prize-collecting algorithm
and a sophisticated cross-species homology tool to visualize
the screen hits as a humanized molecular network. TransposeNet
revealed that a-syn pathology is deeply connected to human ge-
netic risk factors for parkinsonism and parsed out the molecular
pathways through which these connections occur. We envisage
TransposeNet as a valuable resource for the community, easily

 generalizable to the modeling of any physiologic or pathologic
process in genetically tractable organisms.
A pressing challenge in neurodegeneration is to determine
whether genes associated with highly distinct pathologies, but
that nevertheless converge on similar clinical phenotypes, are
related at a molecular level or not. Our network tied a-syn not
only to genes that cause classical PD (Ogaki et al., 2015) but
also to genes that cause parkinsonism with different pathologies
and genes associated with other neurodegenerative phenotypes
altogether (Table S14). The relationships were highly specific to
a-syn. Moreover, genes tied to classical PD or a-syn pathology
(like RAB7L1, VPS35, and LRRK2) were concentrated in a
vesicle-trafficking-associated subnetwork, while genes tied to
‘‘atypical’’ parkinsonism (like ATP13A2 and ATXN2) were in sepa-
rate subnetworks. For a few examples, we experimentally vali-
dated the convergent and divergent molecular pathologies indi-
cated by the spatial location on the map. Thus, LRRK2 and
a-syn pathologies were connected at the level of perturbed protein
trafficking, which was confirmed in patient-derived neurons. In
another example, VPS35 and ATP13A2 exhibited highly distinct
genetic modifier profiles in yeast. Other network and model-organ-
ism studies provide important support for our results, including
connections between a-syn and LRRK2 (Cho et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2012), RAB7L1 and LRRK2 (MacLeod et al., 2013; Beilina
et al., 2014), and VPS35 and a-syn (Dhungel et al., 2015).
For some genes connected to a-syn toxicity by our network,
including EIF4G1 (PARK18) and CHCHD2, human genetic data
are limited or controversial (Funayama et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
2015; Ogaki et al., 2015; Chartier-Harlin et al., 2011; Nuytemans
et al., 2013). Another gene, RAB7L1, is one of two candidates in
linkage with a parkinsonism-associated common gene variant
(PARK16). Our analysis affirms a connection between such
genes and a-syn proteinopathy and provides the biological
context in which to place these interactions. For example, we
make no claim that the translation factor EIF4G1 should be
designated a ‘‘PD gene.’’ However, EIF4G1 and a-syn toxicity
are connected in the context of an important and previously un-
recognized direct effect of a-syn on mRNA biology and protein
translation. This was confirmed by multiple hits in our genetic
analysis (Figure 3) and in our mRNA translational profiling of neu-
rons (Figure S14). Moreover, a connection to mRNA translation
and metabolism was also confirmed in our spatial mapping of
a-syn in neurons (Chung et al., 2017). This map revealed that
a-syn is in the immediate vicinity and complexed to proteins
involved in mRNA translation and protein trafficking, suggesting
that these perturbations may be upstream or proximal events in
a-syn toxicity. Interestingly, a connection is emerging between
mRNA
translation
and
other
parkinsonism-related
genes
(Gehrke et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2014).
Finally, by identifying connections between druggable targets
and gene networks, our approach provides a glimpse of how
future treatments might be targeted to specific genetic lesions.
We envisage that the inflexibility of a single clinical or pathologic
diagnosis will yield to a more nuanced molecular diagnosis. In
this scenario, genetic lesions will be matched to compound tar-
gets and confirmed in ‘‘personalized’’ cellular models in which
combinatorial genetic lesions are introduced to reflect specific
genetic risk and biology. Emerging genome-editing technolo-
gies will enable such models to be developed in patient-derived
cells, and for genome-wide screening to be carried out in these
cells also (Hasson et al., 2013; Khurana et al., 2015; Shalem
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). These will unquestionably be
welcome advances, but impressive developments will continue
in simple model organisms. Variomic libraries in yeast, for
example, now enable mutagenesis at single-amino-acid resolu-
tion across the entire yeast proteome (Huang et al., 2013),
unlocking enormous potential for target identification in pheno-
typic screens. We envision multi-faceted, cross-species ap-
proaches will continue to reveal critical insights into many com-
plex diseases and perhaps fulfill therapeutic promises in the
post-genomics era.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Yeast Strains
For the deletion screen, strains were in the BY4741 background and have been described in detail elsewhere (Baryshnikova et al.,
2010; Tong and Boone, 2006).
For all experiments except the deletion screen and validation, the yeast strains used were in the w303 background (MATa can1-
100, his3-11,15, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1, ade2-1). The vector control strain contained empty vector at the trp and ura loci
(pAG304Gal, pAG306GAL). The NoTox a-syn strain contained a-syn fused to green fluorescent protein (a-syn-GFP) inserted at
the his locus (pAG303Gal-a-syn-GFP). IntTox and HiTox a-syn strains contained multiple tandem copies of a-syn-GFP inserted at
this and trp loci (pRS303GAL-a-syn-GFP, pRS304GAL-a-syn-GFP). IntTox strains have 4-5 copies of a-syn while HiTox cells
have > 6 copies of a-syn. The DPARK17/a-syn and DPARK9/a-syn were generated by replacing the PARK17/VPS35 or PARK9/
SPF1 gene loci in IntTox a-syn strains with a kanamycin resistance cassette (VPS35::kanMX or SPF1::kanMX).
Human iPSC Lines
iPSC from control individuals and PD patients carrying G2019S LRRK2 along with isogenic gene-corrected controls were generated
as previously described (Reinhardt et al., 2013). Skin biopsy, human dermal fibroblast culture, iPS cell generation and mutation
correction for the patient harboring the A53T mutation (a-synA53T) have been described previously (Cooper et al., 2006; Soldner
et al., 2011). In that previous publication the A53T iPS line was referred to as WIBR-IPS-SNCAA53T. For all iPSC lines, informed con-
sent was obtained from patients prior to cell donation using a written form, and the protocol was approved by the relevant institutional
review board: for LRRK2 iPSC this was the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty and the University Hospital T€
ubingen (Ethik-
Kommission der Medizinischen Fakult€
at am Universit€
atsklinikum T€
ubingen); for the A53T line, the IRB of the Boston University Med-
ical Campus and the MIT Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects.
Human iPSC Generation and Differentiation into Midbrain Dopaminergic (DA) Neurons for LRRK2 Mutant Lines
iPSC were differentiated into mDA neurons using a floor plate-based protocol with minor modifications (Kriks et al., 2011; Scho
¨ ndorf
et al., 2014). Differentiation was based on exposure to LDN193189 (100 nM, Stemgent) from days 0–11, SB431542 (10 mM, Tocris)
from days 0–5, SHH C25II (100 ng/mL, R&D), purmorphamine (2 mM, EMD) and FGF8 (100 ng/mL, Peprotech) from days 1–7 and
CHIR99021 (CHIR; 3 mM, Stemgent) from days 3–13. Cells were grown for 11 days on Matrigel (BD) in knockout serum replacement
medium (KSR) containing DMEM, 15% knockout serum replacement, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. KSR
medium was gradually shifted to N2 medium starting on day 5 of differentiation. On day 11, media was changed to Neurobasal/
B27/L-Glut containing medium (NB/B27; Invitrogen) supplemented with CHIR (until day 13) and with BDNF (brain-derived neurotro-
phic factor, 20ng/ ml; R&D), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM, Sigma), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, 20 ng/ml; R&D), TGFb3
(transforming growth factor type b3, 1 ng/ml; R&D), dibutyryl cAMP (0.5 mM; Sigma), and DAPT (10 mM; Tocris,) for 9 days. On day
18, cells were dissociated using Accutase (Innovative Cell Technology) and replated under high cell density conditions on dishes pre-
coated with 15 mg /ml polyornithine and 1 mg /ml laminin in differentiation medium (NB/B27 + BDNF, ascorbic acid, GDNF, dbcAMP,
TGFb3 and DAPT). At DIV30, cells were collected and, after centrifugation, cell pellets were stored at �80�C until further analysis.
Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Culture for a-Syn Mutant Lines
Skin biopsy, human dermal fibroblast culture, iPS cell generation and mutation correction for the patient harboring the A53T mutation
(WIBR-IPS-A53T) have been described previously (Cooper et al., 2006; Soldner et al., 2011). In that previous publication the A53T iPS
line was referred to as WIBR-IPS-SNCAA53T.
Our pluripotent stem cell lines were initially maintained (5%02, 3%C02) on mitomycin C inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) feeder layers in hES medium [DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 5%
KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 1 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mer-
captoethanol (Sigma) and 4 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D systems)]. Cultures were passaged every 5 to 7 days either manually or enzymatically
with collagenase type IV (Invitrogen; 1.5 mg/ml). At around 50 passages prior to differentiation, lines were passaged to plates pre-
coated with growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences; 1:30 in DMEM:F12) and cultured (21% 02, 5% CO2) in mTESR-1 medium
(Stem Cell Technologies), thereafter being passaged every 5 to 7 days enzymatically with dispase (Invitrogen; 1mg/mL) until differen-
tiation (at passage 40-90). For karyotyping, standard G-banding chromosomal analysis of cell lines was performed every 10-20 pas-
sages (Cell Line Genetics, Inc). We confirmed mycoplasma-negative status of our cultures every 2-4 weeks (MycoAlert, Lonza).
Primary Rat Cortical Cultures
All animal work was approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care. Embryos were harvested by cesarean section from anesthe-
tized pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at embryonic day 18. Cerebral cortices were isolated and dissociated with Accumax (Innovative
e2
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
 Cell Technologies, Inc) digestion for 20 min at 37�C and triutration with Pasteur pipette. Poly-ornithine and laminin-coated 96 well
plates were seeded with 4x104 cells respectively in neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with B27 (Life Technolo-
gies), 0.5 mM glutamine, 25 mM b–mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). One third of the medium was
changed every 3 to 4 days.
METHOD DETAILS
Yeast-to-Human Homology
Since yeast and human are evolutionarily distant species, to identify human homologs for yeast proteins, we developed a four-tiered
meta-analysis pipeline. Our meta-analysis started at the sequence level, in which we first identify genes/proteins that are similar
across yeast and humans. We then extend this analysis to the structural level, where we investigate the proteins that are structurally,
and thus more distantly, similar across the species. Next, we identify proteins that are similar within each species by using a network-
topology based approach. Finally, we introduce an approach to integrate similarity across sequence, structure and network topol-
ogy. Details are as follows:
1) Sequence Similarity. To compute the sequence similarity between a yeast protein and a human protein, we used NCBI protein
BLAST with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (Altschul et al., 1990, 1997). Sequence similarity was computed for all pairs of
yeast proteins and human proteins. We used an E-value threshold = 1E-5 to determine significance. We also used DIOPT
(GTEx Consortium, 2013; Hu et al., 2011; Reinhardt et al., 2013; So
¨ ding et al., 2005), an integrative ortholog prediction web-
server, to predict human orthologs for each yeast protein. We stored all filtered yeast-human protein pairs together with their
BLAST E-values, bit scores and DIOPT scores.
2) Evolutionary and Structural Similarity. For each yeast and human protein, we applied PSI-BLAST to construct a multiple
sequence alignment and build a profile hidden Markov model to encode a remote evolutionary signature. We then applied
HHpred (Kriks et al., 2011; Robinson and Oshlack, 2010; Scho
¨ ndorf et al., 2014; So
¨ ding et al., 2005; Voevodski et al.,
2009), with the profile hidden Markov models and secondary structure annotations as input, to compare all pairs of yeast pro-
teins and human proteins. As with the sequence similarity calculation, we also used an E-value = 1E-5 threshold. We stored all
filtered yeast-human protein pairs with their HHpred E-values and bit scores.
3) Network Topology (Diffusion Component Analysis; DCA). The central idea behind our network topology approach is to try to
capture functionally-related modules at the protein level, so that each node can be represented with a low-dimensional
vector, instead of a single score, that captures homologous proteins in the network, along with conserved patterns of in-
teractions. The eventual goal (see Integrative Approach, below) is to be able to compare low-dimensional representations
of node vectors across species to yield information in other organisms. However, if we follow a straightforward PageRank-
like approach (Cho et al., 2015; Tuncbag et al., 2016; Voevodski et al., 2009) to compute each node’s vector, we get
inaccuracies in functional similarity prediction due to network noise. Thus, using the intuition that compression
decreases noise, we reduce the dimensionality of the vectors using sophisticated machine learning techniques. Our
approach has been shown to reduce noise and be better able to extract topological network information such as functional
similarity(Bailly-Bechet et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2015). The approach has recently been generalized into a method called
Mashup (Cho et al., 2016).
More formally, let A denote the adjacency matrix of a (weighted) molecular interaction network G = ðV; EÞ with n nodes, each de-
noting a gene or a protein. Each entry Bi;j in the transition probability matrix, which stores the probability of a transition from node i to
node j, is computed as Bi;j = Ai;j=P
k Ai;k. The diffusion algorithm is then defined as
st + 1
i
= ð1 � pÞst
iB + pei
until convergence, where p is the probability of restart, controlling the relative influence of local and global information in the network;
ei is a binary vector with eiðiÞ = 1 for node i itself and eiðjÞ = 0 for other nodes j. When the diffusion patterns of two nodes are similar to
each other, it implies that they are in proximal locations in the network with respect to other nodes, which potentially suggest func-
tional similarity. In practice, diffusion vectors obtained in this manner are still noisy, in part due to their high dimensionality as well as
the noise and incompleteness of the original high-throughput network data. With the goal of noise and dimensionality reduction, we
approximate each diffusion vector with a multinomial logistic model based on a latent vector representation of nodes that uses far
fewer dimensions than the original vector. Specifically, we compute the probability assigned to node j in the diffusion vector of node
i as:
e
sij = exp
�
wT
i xj
�� X
k
exp
�
wT
i xk
�
where superscript T denotes vector transposition; wi and xi are low-dimension vectors. Each node is given two vector represen-
tations, wi and xi. We refer to wi as the context feature and xi as the node feature of node i, both capturing the intrinsic topo-
logical properties in the network. This multinomial logistic regression model is applied to model the relevance between a
node and other nodes in a network, which can be modeled as a discrete distribution over all nodes in a network. To obtain
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
e3
 w and x vectors for all nodes, we optimize the KL-divergence (or relative entropy) between the diffusion vectors si and the model
vectors e
si:
minw;xCðs; ~
sÞ =
X
i
DKL
�
si k e
si
�
:
Akin to PCA, which reveals the internal low-dimensional linear structure of matrix data that best explains the variance, this
approach computes a low-dimensional vector-space representation for all genes such that the connectivity patterns in the network
can be best explained. Comprehensive experiments showed that these low-dimensional vectors w and x are more accurate at iden-
tifying functional association within the network (Cho et al., 2016.; Tuncbag et al., 2013).
4) Integrative Approach. To compare proteins from yeast and human, we extended the above DCA method to consider the to-
pology of both interactomes as well as the sequence/structural similarity between them. We converted the sequence and
structure similarity scores to a probability distribution, and feature vectors of all pairs of nodes, including the sparse vector
representations ones, were jointly computed by minimizing the Kullbeck-Leibler (KL) divergence between the relevance vec-
tors and the parameterized multinomial distributions.
Formally, here we have two interactomes, GY for yeast and GH for human. To capture the topological similarity within interactomes,
we perform the described diffusion algorithm on GY and GH separately and then obtain diffusion vectors sY
i for yeast protein i and sH
j
for human protein j. Similar to DCA on a single network, we also assign vectors wY
i ; xY
i
for each yeast protein, and vectors wH
i ; xH
i
for
each human protein. To the sequence/structural similarity between obvious homologs, we normalize the BLAST bit scores between
each yeast protein i and its human homologs j into a probability distribution as bY
ij = bitij=P
kbitik. Similarly we also normalize the
BLAST bit scores between each human protein j and its yeast homologs i into a probability distribution as bH
ji = bitij=P
kbitik. We like-
wise do the same normalization for HHpred bit scores as hY
ij and hH
ji , and hY
ij and dH
ji for DIOPT scores. Between each yeast protein
i and human protein j, we approximate each normalized bit score distribution vector with a multinomial logistic model as:
e
tij = exp
�
wT
i xj
�� X
k
exp
�
wT
i xk
�
:
Similar to the definition of e
sij for genes in the same molecular network, e
tij captures the homologous similarity between a yeast gene
and a human gene. In this way, although in different networks, yeast and human genes are represented in the same vector space.
Finally, we optimize an extended DCA objective function as:
minwY ;wH;xY ;xH

where aBlast, aHHpred and aDIOPT are parameters to tune the importance of each similarity component. Importantly, by optimizing these
vectors, we integrate both molecular network connectivity and sequence similarity information into the same vector space for the
purpose of comparison.
Here we used a greedy method to select these parameters. Specifically, we incrementally added each term and find the optimal or
reasonable weight for the term, according to the functional concordance between the predicted yeast-human homology pairs. The
details of the parameter selection procedure can be found in the ‘‘Parameter Tuning’’ section below. On the basis of the analyses
included therein, we chose aBlast = 10, aHHpred = 5 and aDIOPT = 5. Finally, we computed the integrated homologous association
pij = ðe
tij + e
tjiÞ=2 between yeast protein i and a human protein.
To find significant homology pairs, we computed pij for all yeast-human protein pairs and constructed the empirical background
distribution. We used 0.0005 as the empirical p value cut-off to predict putative human homologs for yeast proteins and remove the
homolog j if pij < 0:5 maxkfpikg. The background distribution is generated by randomly pairing human and yeast genes. Utilizing this
cutoff, there were 4923 yeast proteins with predicted human homologs, greatly improving the coverage of BLAST (4023 yeast pro-
teins) and HHpred (4312 yeast proteins) (Figure S3A).
Preprocessing of Interactomes
We downloaded both yeast and human interactomes from the STRING v9.1 (string-db.org). In STRING, qij are the confidence values
assigned for each edge in the interactome. We removed predicted interactions and re-calibrated the confidence for each interaction
pair, such that qij = 1 � ð1 � qexperiment
ij
Þ � ð1 � qdatabase
ij
Þ with only ‘‘experimental’’ and ‘‘database’’ channels included. We also
removed interaction pairs with low confidence qij < 0:2. After the preprocessing, we obtained a yeast interactome with 372026 in-
teractions and 6164 proteins and a human interactome with 643822 interactions and 15317 proteins.
For the human networks, we also included two recently published high-quality binary human interactome datasets (11045 from
high-quality re-curated binary interactions extracted from 7 public repositories; and 13944 from a recent yeast-2-hybrid experimental
e4
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
 dataset) (Geetha et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2011; Rolland et al., 2014). Since these interactions were unweighted, we needed to assign
confidence scores for them. To estimate a good confidence value, we extracted all physical binary interactions from the BIOGRID
database (v3.2.116) and computed the statistics of STRING confidence scores of these interactions. Since interactions from
BIOGRID are mostly from high-throughput experiments and they are binary, we used the mean or median statistics to assign con-
fidence scores for new binary interactions. The quantile statistics of STRING confidence scores of BIOGRID interactions were 25%:
0.391, 50%: 0.620 and 75% 0.717. The average value of STRING confidence scores of BIOGRID interactions was 0.588. We thus
considered it reasonable to assign a 0.6 confidence score for each unweighted binary interaction in these datasets.
As we were modeling neurodegenerative proteinopathies in the current work, we further pruned the human interactome to be
brain-specific. To do so, we took GTEX gene expression dataset to only include genes appreciably expressed in brain (GTEx Con-
sortium, 2013; Hu et al., 2011; So
¨ ding et al., 2005). Specifically, we normalized 357 GTEX brain RNA-seq datasets by the RPKM
method (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010; So
¨ ding et al., 2005; Voevodski et al., 2009). We then filtered our human interactome such
that only proteins with normalized brain expression level greater than (in at least one of 357 RNA-seq datasets) were included. In
the end, our brain-specific interactome contained 369634 interactions and 10365 proteins.
Augmentation of Human Interactome with Yeast-to-Yeast Edges (for Humanized Networks Only)
Since genetic interactions are sparse in the human interactome, we used inferred homology to augment the human interactome by
transferring edges from the yeast interactome. To do so, we added an edge between human proteins j and k if there exist a pair of
yeast proteins i and l such that the integrated homologous association pij and pkl satisfy pij � pkl > 0:2 (see definitions above). This
threshold was chosen to make the augmented brain interactome attain a similar density (�0.018) to that of yeast interactome
(�0.019) with 751282 interaction pairs transferred.
Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest Algorithm
We used the prize-collecting Steiner forest (PCSF) construction to analyze yeast networks and the augmented human-yeast network
described above (Cho et al., 2015; Tuncbag et al., 2013, 2016.; Voevodski et al., 2009). For a network GðV; E; c; pÞ of node (gene) set
V and edge (interaction) set E (where pðvÞR0 assigns a prize to each node v ˛ V, and cðeÞR0 assigns a cost to each edge e ˛ E), the
goal of PCSF is to find a set of trees FðVF; EFÞ to minimize the following cost function:
fðFÞ =

where k is the number of connected components or trees in the forest F; b is a parameter quantifying the trade-off between node prize
and edge cost; dðvÞ is the degree of node v; m is a parameter to penalize hub nodes with a large number of neighbors in the network. In
this way, the algorithm searches for a network of relatively high-confidence edges linking the experimental data.
To optimize the objective function fðFÞ, we introduced an extra root node v0 into the network connected to each node v ˛ V by an
edge ðv; v0Þ with cost u. This step transforms the PCSF problem into a Prize-collecting Steiner Tree problem (PCST), which can be
solved by a previously published message-passing-algorithm (Bailly-Bechet et al., 2011). After the tree solution was obtained, we
removed node v0 and all edges that point to it from the tree solution and obtained the forest solution. It is not hard to show that
the tree solution is optimal for the above PCST if and only if the forest solution is optimal for the original PCSF. Although the mes-
sage-passing algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, it works very well in practice (Cho et al., 2015), and more impor-
tantly, it is substantially faster than linear programming approaches, which cannot handle large networks such as the yeast and hu-
man interactomes.
A computational difficulty of PCSF is how to tune the parameters b, u and m. Since b controls the scale of the prize values for nodes,
we assigned a constant prize value (100) to each gene from our screens in our experiments. A perturbation of any parameter can
potentially change the topology of the network structure, making the choice of parameters critical (Altschul et al., 1990, 1997; Ash-
burner et al., 2000; Tuncbag et al., 2013). Thus, instead of choosing a single set of parameters, we developed an ensemble approach
to obtain the consensus network from multiple reasonable parameter settings.
To decide the range of parameters, we set the upper and lower bounds such that: the network solution of PCSF contained sufficient
number of predicted proteins (which is half of the number of input prize genes); the network solution did not introduce hub nodes with
more than 1000 neighbors in the input network. We discretized the range of the parameters into a grid and enumerated all possible
parameter combinations for PCSF runs. For the yeast network, the range of b was f1; 2; 4; 6; 8; 10; 12g; the range of u was
f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8g; the range of m was f0:001; 0:003g. For the humanized network, the range of b was f4; 6; 8; 10; 12; 14; 16g; the
range of u was f3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10g; the range of m was f0:003; 0:005g. We also injected edge noise for PCSF runs to test for robust-
ness, using the default Gaussian noise setting in the PCSF program. After obtaining the solutions for each PCSF parameter setting,
we computed the frequency of each possible edge appearing in the ensemble of all solutions. The frequency of an edge is a surrogate
for the robustness of the edge across different parameter settings. Finally, we took as input the edges and their frequencies in the
ensemble of all solutions and applied a maximum spanning tree algorithm to find the most robust, representative network.
To evaluate the significance of the selected nodes in the solution, we constructed a background distribution for each node by simu-
lating the same PCSF and ensemble process using a random selection of the same number of yeast genes as input. We computed
background distributions using random gene sets with identical degree distribution to that of the prize node lists. Specifically, we
binned all yeast genes into four categories, each containing genes with degrees [1-5], [5-10], [10-100] and [> 100] respectively.
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
e5
 Random gene sets are then sampled without replacement from these categories such that the statistics of the degree distribution
were identical to those of a prize node list. We then performed PCSF and generated 10000 random ensembles of forests from
1000 random sets to compute the empirical distributions of each node in the background.
To evaluate the significance of the overlaps of the forests relating to different proteinopathies (Figure 1D), we also calculated
pairwise and triple-wise intersections of these random sets as background distributions. For example, we randomly paired the
random ensembles generated for a-syn and random ensembles for TDP-43 and computed the distribution of the sizes of their
overlaps. In this way, we constructed background distributions to evaluate the significance of the overlaps compared that sim-
ply caused by the increased size of the networks. Empirical p values are also computed. Similar to our previous results, all the
pairwise overlaps were statistically significant (p % 0.002). For the triple-wise intersections, the p value was even more signif-
icant (p % 0.001).
Node and Edge Setup for Yeast and Humanized Steiner Networks
Aside from differences in parameterization (noted above), there were some important differences between the yeast networks and
the ‘‘humanized’’ networks.
For the yeast networks (Figure 2), ’’prize nodes’’ were modifier hits from yeast genetic screens. Each prized node was assigned
‘‘100’’ as the arbitrary prize value. Edges for yeast networks were derived from STRING experimental and database edges. As
described above, each edge was assigned a weight qij.
For the humanized networks (Figures 3 and 4), ‘‘prize nodes’’ were similarly defined as modifier hits from yeast genetic screens.
Yeast-to-human edges were weighted by the strength of homology (pij above) between yeast proteins and their human homologs. On
the humanized networks, these are the first-order links seen between the red triangles (which are hits from the screen) and blue cir-
cles (human homologs). If one of the clear human homologs of a yeast modifier was a known parkinsonism or neurodegenerative
gene – for example, a PARK locus gene – an arbitrary reward of 0.5 was added to pij to favor inclusion of that node over other potential
homologs. Finally, edges between human proteins in the humanized networks were derived from STRING, but also from other sour-
ces, as described in ‘‘Pre-processing of interactomes’’ and ‘‘Augmentation of human interactome with yeast-to-yeast edges’’ above.
Parameter Tuning for Computational Pipelines
Here, we provide analyses and guidelines for the parameters used in our paper.
Weights for BLAST, HHpred, and DIOPT in the DCA homology tool
Since it is impossible to select the optimal parameters without enumerating all possible combinations, we performed a greedy anal-
ysis for the parameter selection for the extended DCA objective function. Specifically, we incrementally added each term and found
the optimal or reasonable weight for the term.
Since BLAST is the most sensitive method for sequence homology detection, we first explored a reasonable parameter interval for
BLAST. We only retained the two network topology terms and the BLAST terms in the extended DCA objective function and enumer-
ated alpha_BLAST from the set of {1,2,5,10, 20,100}. To evaluate the performance, we computed the average accuracy of Gene
Ontology (GO) of the top 5 homologs predicted by our method. In Figure S2A it is readily seen that when the BLAST weight was
too small (< 10), our method was not able to fully exploit the homology information from BLAST. When this weight was greater
than or equal to 10, the predictive performance became saturated and only provided slight performance improvement over the orig-
inal BLAST method. When the weight became too large ( = 100), the predictive performance dropped and was identical to that of
BLAST. This is because that the effect of network topology is diminished and our method simply reconstructed BLAST’s results.
Thus, on the basis of the analysis we simply fixed the BLAST parameter to 10, although there might be better choices at extra compu-
tational cost by enumerating a larger and more refined set of possible values.
After we fixed the BLAST weight, we added the HHpred terms and performed the same analysis for HHpred weight. From the per-
formance curve (Figure S2B), we observed that the optimal HHpred weight was around 5. This weight is smaller than BLAST weight,
presumably at least in part because BLAST already captures most relevant homology information, while HHpred’s results extend
BLAST by including extra remote sequence and structural homologs.
Finally, we fixed both BLAST and HHpred weights and performed the analysis for DIOPT weights (Figure S2C). For DIOPT, the per-
formance difference was very small as long as the weight was not too large (< 20). This was consistent with the DIOPT database only
providing a few additional sequence homologs missed by both BLAST and HHpred. For simplicity, we chose its weighting equal to
5 as well.
Significance threshold for BLAST and HHpred in the DCA homology tool
We chose 1E-5 because it is a reasonably stringent threshold that is typically used for sequence homology or structure prediction
(Geetha et al., 1999). Other choices of the threshold are possible but we believe that the results are not appreciably different from
our setting. The following website and paper indicates 1E-5 is a reasonably stringent cutoff for protein BLAST.
Reward to homologs of known Parkinson genes
The major reason why we added reward values to homologs of known Parkinson genes is that the prize-collecting Steiner forest
(PCSF) algorithm is not guaranteed to include all prize nodes in the final network. In addition, our homology tool can sometimes assign
similar scores to two homologs, one with known literature support, the other without. Although the PCSF algorithm itself is able to
distinguish most correct homologs by considering the connectivity, we found that by rewarding well-known homologs the noise
can be further reduced. The reward parameter 0.5 is chosen such that existing homologs of well-known Parkinson’s genes from
e6
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
 our screens are included in the final networks. It is obvious that larger reward values can have also the similar effect, but we didn’t
explore those choices because we hoped to not to overtune the effect of this reward heuristic in our pipeline.
Confidence threshold for existing interactomes and predicted links
ThechoiceofconfidencethresholdforSTRINGisindeedatrade-offbetweenfalse-positivesandtrue-positives.Astringentthreshold,e.g.,
0.8, can reduce the number of false-positives but the truncated yeast and human interactomes appeared to be too sparse and discon-
nected. Such thresholds may work well for signaling pathways or other well-studied and localized biological pathways but we did not
feel this was an appropriate approach for complex proteinopathies, where mechanisms are poorly understood (and casting a ‘‘broader
net’’ seems more appropriate) and where the connections between seemingly disparate disease-relevant genes are not well understood.
Thus, we selected 0.2 to only exclude very low-confidence interactions and still maintain the major connectivity of the interactomes.
Confidence score for new high-throughput binary interactomes
Since the new high-throughput binary interactomes are unweighted, we need to assign an appropriate score to merge them with
STRING interactions. To estimate an appropriate confidence value, we extracted all physical binary interactions from the most recent
BIOGRID database and computed the statistics of STRING confidence scores of these interactions. Since interactions from
BIOGRID are mostly from high-throughput experiments and they are binary, we can use the mean or median statistics to assign
confidence scores for new binary interactions. The quantile statistics of STRING confidence scores of BIOGRID interactions are
25%: 0.391, 50%: 0.620 and 75% 0.717. The mean value of STRING confidence scores of BIOGRID interactions is 0.588. We
thus assigned 0.6 since it closely related to both the median and mean statistics, judging it a reasonable assignment for incorporating
new high-throughput binary interactions into existing STRING database.
Parameters for prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm (PCSF)
As noted above, we used an ensemble approach to avoid the problem of parameter selection. There is no obvious way to determine
the effectiveness of a set of parameters for PCSF. Furthermore, since there are several parameters, enumeration of all combinations
becomes computationally infeasible. To address this issue, as noted above, we selected a wide-range of possible parameters, ran
PCSF with all parameter combinations and made an ensemble network from single networks generated from each parameter com-
binations. These parameters are chosen such that the final network can connect 80% prize nodes in the network. Our parameter
range also excludes networks that are overly distorted by ‘‘greedy’’ hyperconnected hubs like ubiquitin. As noted in our methods
section, we further tested robustness by injecting noise into the edge distribution. There is no question that there is an element of
subjectivity here, as with any parameterized model but we have taken great pains to be as broad as we feel we possibly can. Ulti-
mately, the purpose is to generate tenable hypotheses or to predict biologically meaningful interactions.
Spotting Assays
Yeast were cultured in synthetic media consisting of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Fischer Scientific) supple-
mented with amino acids (MP Biomedicals) and 2% sugar. For most experiments, cells were first grown to mid-log phase in synthetic
media containing glucose and then re-cultured overnight in synthetic media containing 2% raffinose. Mid-log phase cells were then
diluted in synthetic media containing galactose. Typically, cells were induced for six hours at 30�C.
Each strain was diluted to a starting OD600 = 1.0 and serially diluted five-fold and then spotted on agar plates containing galactose
(inducing) or glucose (control) plates.
Screening against Known a-Syn Modifiers in DPARK17/a-Syn and DPARK9/a-Syn Strains
The standard lithium acetate transformation protocol was adapted for use with 96-well plates (Cooper et al., 2006; Gietz et al., 1992,
1995). Following transformation, cells were grown to saturation in synthetic media with raffinose lacking uracil for selection of yeast
transformed with the desired plasmid. Once at saturation, they were spotted onto synthetic media plates with either glucose or galac-
tose. Following two days of growth, galactose and glucose plates were photographed and analyzed by eye. In parallel experiments,
transformed yeast were rediluted to OD600 = 0.01 in 35 mL of galactose media in 384-well plates. Growth in 384-plates was monitored
by measuring the OD600 after 18, 24, and 48 hr of growth (Tecan safire2) giving a quantifiable measure of growth.
Small Molecule (NAB2) Treatment
Control, TDP-43 or a�syn yeast strains were grown to log-phase (OD600 �0.5) in complete synthetic media containing raffinose (non-
inducing). Cultures were then diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 (TDP-43 experiment) and 0.025 (a-syn experiment) in complete synthetic
media containing 2% galactose to induce expression of the toxic protein. For NAB treatment, 10 mM (for a-syn) or 20 mM (for TDP-43)
were added to the cultures and incubated in a Bioscreen instrument with intermittent shaking at 30�C for two days.
Pooled a-Syn Overexpression Screen
Pooled genetic screens were carried out in a YFP control strain and an a�syn strain. The yeast FLEXgene library representing most
yeast open reading frames (Hu et al., 2007) was pooled from an arrayed bacterial library stock and grown to saturation in deep 96 well
plates at 37�C. Cultures were pooled and plasmids isolated using QIAGEN maxi prep kits. The pooled FLEXgene library was then
transformed en masse into either control YFP or a�syn-expressing yeast strains and selected on five square 15 cm solid agar plates
lacking uracil for plasmid selection. Approximately 106 CFUs were obtained, representing an approximate 200-fold coverage of the
�6,000 yeast genes. Colonies were rinsed off of each plate, pooled, brought to 20% glycerol, aliquoted to individual use tubes
(�100 mL), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at �80�C.

 Pooled screens were executed as follows. An aliquot of pooled yeast library was thawed on ice and diluted at three different con-
centrations into 3 3 30 mL flasks with SRafUra (�0.025, 0.05, and 0.1). After shaking at 30�C overnight, the culture with an OD600
between 0.4 and 0.8 was selected to begin the pooled screen. Cultures were then diluted to and OD600 of 0.1 in SGal Ura to induce
expression of either YFP or a�syn. 50 OD units were kept as time zero and centrifuged, washed with water, and frozen. Cultures were
then maintained in log phase growth for 24 hr, making appropriate dilutions when needed to maintain and OD600 under 0.8. After this
time, 50 OD units worth of culture were centrifuged, washed with water, and pellets frozen.
Plasmids were then isolated from yeast using QIAGEN minipreps with the following adaptations. Five minipreps were done per 50
OD units. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer and lysed by bead beating with small acid-washed beads. Beads were removed
and the lysate then taken through the conventional miniprep protocol. The purified plasmids from the five preps were then pooled.
The yeast ORFs contained on the FLEXgene plasmids were then amplified using PCR primers that annealed to the attR Gateway
sequences flanking the ORFs. HiFidelty Platinum Taq was used for amplification. 5 uL DNA was used per 50uL reaction and four re-
actions were performed per sample. 30+ cycles with a �6’ extension time was used to ensure amplification of longer ORFs. PCR
product was purified using QIAGEN PCR columns. Two micrograms of PCR product was then sonicated, purified on QIAGEN Mine-
lute PCR columns, and the OD260 re-analyzed. This product was then used as input for library generation and sequencing by the
Whitehead Institute Genome Technology Core. Illumina HiSeq platform was used to sequence approximately 120 million 40 bp single
end reads.
Reads were mapped to the yeast ORFs sequences with bowtie(Langmead et al., 2009). We made a bowtie index with the DNA
sequences of the yeast ORFs reported in Hu et al.(Hu et al., 2007), plus 903 ORFs that were present in SGD but were not included
in the list of sequences from in Hu et al. Reads were mapped allowing 2 mismatches (-n 2) in the seed, seed length of 40 (-l 40), sup-
pressing all alignments that map to more than one place (-m 1) and using ‘‘–best’’ and ‘‘–strata.’’ Unmapped reads were trimmed with
fastx_trimmer (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/commandline.html) to remove the first 20 nt, and remapped with bowtie using
the following parameters: ‘‘-n 0 -l 20–best–strata -m 1 ‘‘. The number of reads mapping to each ORF was obtained parsing the output
sam files. Differential expression analysis was done with the R package Noiseq (Tarazona et al., 2011). NOISeq is a nonparametric
method to identify differentially expressed genes from count data. NOISeq calculates fold change values and probability of differen-
tial expression. The probability (P-val) of differential expression for each gene is derived from the joint distribution of fold-change dif-
ferences (M)- absolute expression differences (D) values for all the genes within the Table Set.
A gene was selected for validation if it was: (A) up or down consistently in the two pooled a-syn screens (jlog2 fold changej > 0.8 in
both screens) except when neither experiment was associated with a P-val of > 0.5); (B) had an average fold change with absolute
value of > 2.5 (regardless of P-val); (C) known modifiers from previous experimentation that had a fold-change in the pooled screen
consistent with that source. Any gene with an jlog2 fold changej > 1.0 in the YFP control (in the same direction as the putative sup-
pressor or enhancer) was excluded, as well as genes associated with galactose metabolism that would be expected to alter expres-
sion of gal-inducible transgenes. Thresholds were guided by knowledge gained from our previous extensive characterization of the
arrayed a-syn overexpression screen hits (see Figure 1). Put another way, our previous overexpression screen was used as a ‘‘gold
standard’’ to analyze the pooled overexpression data.
Pooled Screen-QPCR Verification
Transformed cells generated from the pooled screen (‘‘Pooled a�syn overexpression Screen’’ method) were thawed on ice and
diluted in SRaf-Ura to resulting ODs of approximately 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1. Cultures were grown at 30�C overnight and cultures
with an OD of 0.4-0.8 were chosen for induction. These cultures were diluted to an OD of 0.1 in SGal-Ura. 50 OD units were stocked
representing the time zero time point. Induced cultures were grown for 24 hr and 50 OD units were stocked representing the 24hr time
point. Plasmids were isolated using the QIAGEN miniprep kit (27106) splitting the 50OD units for each time point in to 5 samples.
Following cell resuspension in P1 buffer cells were lysed by bead beating using acid-washed beads. Following bead beating, beads
were removed from samples and lysates subjected to the standard miniprep kit protocol. Resulting plasmids were pooled and used
for QPCR analysis. The standard attF primer was used in combination with an orf specific reverse primer (sequence generated by
Primer3 such that the product < 150bp in size) for QPCR analysis. Multiple negative controls used to normalize samples and positive
controls were run on all QPCR plates. QPCR analysis was performed using technical triplicates of biological triplicates on the Applied
Biosystems (7900HT) using the SYBR green fluorescence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The program for amplification
comprised 40 cycles of 95�C for 15 s and 60�C for 1 min.
Pooled Screen-Growth Curve Analysis
Each individual putative modifier was overexpressed in the a�syn strain using the Flexgene overexpression library. Three indepen-
dent Ura+ transformants were grown in SRaf-Ura at 30�C overnight. Cultures were subcultured in SRaf-Ura and at an OD of 0.4-0.8
were diluted in Sgal-Ura for induction. Each isolate was set up in triplicate and growth was monitored every 15 min for approxi-
mately 60 hr.
Genome-Wide Deletion Screen (Synthetic Gene Array Methodology)
The method used was essentially as described previously (Baryshnikova et al., 2010; Tong and Boone, 2006). Briefly, deletion strains
were pinned on to YPD+G418 plates. Query strains (a-syn and wild-type control) were grown in 5ml overnight cultures in YPD at 30�C
and spread on YPD plates and grown overnight. Deletion strains were mated to each query strain by pinning together on YPD and
e8
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
 grown for 48hrs at 30�C. Resulting diploids were pinned to SD/MSG-Ura+G418 and grown for 2 days at 30�C. Cells were pinned to
sporulation media plates and incubated at 23�C for 7days. Spores were pinned to SD-His/Arg/Lys+canavanine+thialysine and grown
for 2 days at 30�C. Cells were pinned to fresh SD-His/Arg/Lys+canavanine+thialysine and grown for 1 day at 30�C. Cells were pinned
to SD/MSG-His/Arg/Lys+canavanine+thialysine + G418 and grown for 2 days at 30�C and then pinned to SD/MSG-His/Arg/Lys/
Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and grown for 2 days at 30�C. For the initial screen, cells were pinned both to SD/MSG-His/
Arg/Lys/Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and to Sgal/MSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and spot growth
was monitored. For validation studies, cells were pinned to liquid SD/MSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and
grown overnight at 30�C and then pinned both to SD/MSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and to Sgal/MSG-His/
Arg/Lys/Ura +canavanine+thialysine+G418 and spot growth was monitored. Stock solutions (1000X) were prepared as follows:
G418 200mg/ml, canavanine 50mg/ml, thialysine 50mg/ml. The method above was used for the initial screen and repeated, in dupli-
cate, using 96-well plate format for validation of the initial screen hits.
Human iPSC Generation and Differentiation into Midbrain Dopaminergic (DA) Neurons for LRRK2 Mutant Lines
iPSC from control individuals and PD patients carrying G2019S LRRK2 along with isogenic gene corrected controls were generated
as previously described (Reinhardt et al., 2013). iPSC were differentiated into mDA neurons using a floor plate-based protocol with
minor modifications (Kriks et al., 2011; Scho
¨ ndorf et al., 2014). Differentiation was based on exposure to LDN193189 (100 nM, Stem-
gent) from days 0–11, SB431542 (10 mM, Tocris) from days 0–5, SHH C25II (100 ng/mL, R&D), purmorphamine (2 mM, EMD) and
FGF8 (100 ng/mL, Peprotech) from days 1–7 and CHIR99021 (CHIR; 3 mM, Stemgent) from days 3–13. Cells were grown for
11 days on Matrigel (BD) in knockout serum replacement medium (KSR) containing DMEM, 15% knockout serum replacement,
2 mM L-glutamine and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. KSR medium was gradually shifted to N2 medium starting on day 5 of differenti-
ation. On day 11, media was changed to Neurobasal/B27/L-Glut containing medium (NB/B27; Invitrogen) supplemented with CHIR
(until day 13) and with BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 20ng/ ml; R&D), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM, Sigma), GDNF (glial cell line-
derived neurotrophic factor, 20 ng/ml; R&D), TGFb3 (transforming growth factor type b3, 1 ng/ml; R&D), dibutyryl cAMP (0.5 mM;
Sigma), and DAPT (10 mM; Tocris,) for 9 days. On day 18, cells were dissociated using Accutase (Innovative Cell Technology) and
replated under high cell density conditions on dishes pre-coated with 15 mg /ml polyornithine and 1 mg /ml laminin in differentiation
medium (NB/B27 + BDNF, ascorbic acid, GDNF, dbcAMP, TGFb3 and DAPT). At DIV30, cells were collected and, after centrifuga-
tion, cell pellets were stored at �80�C until further analysis.
Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Culture for a-Syn Mutant Lines
Skin biopsy, human dermal fibroblast culture, iPS cell generation and mutation correction for the patient harboring the A53T mutation
(WIBR-IPS-A53T) have been described previously (Cooper et al., 2006; Soldner et al., 2011). In that previous publication the A53T iPS
line was referred to as WIBR-IPS-SNCAA53T.
Our pluripotent stem cell lines were initially maintained (5%02, 3%C02) on mitomycin C inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) feeder layers in hES medium [DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 5%
KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 1 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mer-
captoethanol (Sigma) and 4 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D systems)]. Cultures were passaged every 5 to 7 days either manually or enzymatically
with collagenase type IV (Invitrogen; 1.5 mg/ml). At around 50 passages prior to differentiation, lines were passaged to plates pre-
coated with growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences; 1:30 in DMEM:F12) and cultured (21% 02, 5% CO2) in mTESR-1 me-
dium (Stem Cell Technologies), thereafter being passaged every 5 to 7 days enzymatically with dispase (Invitrogen; 1mg/mL) until
differentiation (at passage 40-90). For karyotyping, standard G-banding chromosomal analysis of cell lines was performed every
10-20 passages (Cell Line Genetics, Inc.). We confirmed mycoplasma-negative status of our cultures every 2-4 weeks (MycoAlert,
Lonza).
Human Neural Induction by Embryoid Body (EB) Formation
A previously published protocol was used without modification (Chung et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2011). This protocol has
been repeated here for completeness.
To initiate differentiation, on day 0 human ES or iPS cell colonies were pretreated for 30-60 min with 5 mM Y-27632/ROCK inhibitor
(Calbiochem), single cell-dissociated after 5-10min exposure to accutase (StemPro Accutase; Life Technologies) and then re-sus-
pended in neural base (NB) medium, which is DMEM/F12 (GIBCO/Life Technologies) supplemented with N2 and B27. N2 and
B27 supplements from Life Technologies and used at ½-1% and 1%–2%, respectively. Cells were plated in AggreWell 800 micro-
wells (StemCell Technologies; priming and plating per manufacturer’s protocol; 2.4x106 cells were well) in NB medium supplemented
with dual SMAD inhibitors (Chambers et al., 2009; Langmead et al., 2009) recombinant human Noggin (R&D Systems) at 200ng/mL
and 10mM SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience), as well as 5mM Y-27632. Noggin and SB431542 remained in the medium at these concen-
trations throughout the neural differentiation protocol.
On day 1 medium was ½-changed. By day 2, well-formed neuralized EBs (NEBs) were typically observed in the AggreWells and
transferred to Petri dishes (4 AggreWell wells/Petri dish) overnight, in NB medium. On day 4, NEBs were transferred to a dish coated
with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (1:30 in DMEM:F12; BD Biosciences) for attachment. Y-27632 was omitted from this day on-
ward. From day 5 to day 10, attached NEBs were additionally exposed to 20 ng/mL FGF2 (R&D Systems) and recombinant human
Dkk1 at 200 ng/mL (R&D Systems). On day 10, neural rosettes were dissected (P20 pipette tip), incubated in accutase supplemented
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
e9
 with DnaseI (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min at 37�C and gently dissociated to small cellular clumps and single cells. After washing, the
rosettes were re-plated on plastic dishes pre-coated with poly-L-ornithine and laminin (BD Biocoat) at high density (200,000/cm2)
in neural progenitor cell (NPC) medium, which is NB medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL FGF2. (Life Technologies), supplemented
overnight with 10mm Y-27632. Typically, one Aggrewell 800 well provided enough NPCs for at least 1-2 6-wells at passage 0.
Thereafter, the surviving NPCs proliferated. Medium change was daily. They could be passaged up to 10 times before neural dif-
ferentiation, and could successfully be freeze/thawed at early passage (p1 to p5) without compromising differentiation potential.
Freezing medium was NPC medium with 10% FBS (Hyclone).
Human Cortical Neural Differentiation
A previously published protocol was used without modification (Chung et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2011). This protocol has
been repeated here for completeness.
To begin neural differentiation, NPCs were dissociated with accutase and re-plated on matrigel-coated T75 flasks (CytoOne). The
next, day medium was fully changed to Neural Differentiation (ND) medium, which is NB medium supplemented with recombinant
human BDNF and GNDF (both at 10ng/mL; R&D Systems) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma; 500mM), and without FGF-2. Thereafter,
media was ½-changed every other day. On day 7-9, differentiating neurons were gently dissociated to single cell, resuspended in
pre-chilled Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; GIBCO / Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(GIBCO / Life Technologies). After a wash step, cells were plated on 6- or 24-well plastic plates pre-coated with poly-ornithine
and laminin (BD Biocoat) for biochemical assays. Medium was ½-changed every 3 days for up to 12 weeks.
Primary Rat Cortical Cultures
Embryos were harvested by cesarean section from anesthetized pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at embryonic day 18. Cerebral
cortices were isolated and dissociated with Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc) digestion for 20 min at 37�C and trituration
with Pasteur pipette. Poly-ornithine and laminin-coated 96 well plates were seeded with 4x104 cells respectively in neurobasal me-
dium (Life Technologies) supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM glutamine, 25 mM b–mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100
IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). One third of the medium was changed every 3 to 4 days.
AAV-1 Transduction of iPS Neurons
Plasmids containing verified TALE-TFs were purified endotoxin-free (QIAGEN) and packaging into adeno-associated viruses
serotype 1 (AAV-1) was conducted by the Gene Transfer Vector Core, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary/MEEI, Harvard
Medical School (mini-scale production). A53T and mutation-corrected cortical neurons were aged for 4-7 weeks at a plating
density of 0.25-0.75 3 106 cells/cm2. Cells were transduced with 30 mL of the mini scale produced MEEI AAV-1 titer, containing
a single TALE-TF or the TALE cloning backbone alone, in 500 mL ND medium. ND medium was changed 12-16 hr post-
transduction.
Antibodies
Protein Labeling with 35S-Methionine/-Cysteine
A53T and mutation-corrected cortical neurons were aged for 4-8 weeks at a plating density of 0.25-0.75 3 106 cells/cm2. Prior to the
protein labeling the cortical neuronal cultures were kept in Neural Differentiation (ND) medium without methionine and cysteine for
90 min. ND medium was DMEM complemented with 1% (v/v) B-27, 0.5% (v/v) N-2 and 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX supplement, 1% (v/v)
MEM non-essential amino acids, 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (all Life Technologies) as well as 10 ng/ml BDNF and GDNF
(both R&D Systems) and 500 mM cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich). For protein labeling the neuronal cell cultures were incubated in ND medium
supplemented with 35S-methionine and -cysteine (Perkin Elmer) at a final concentration of 100 mCi/ml for various duration. After a
quick wash with cold PBS, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl and 2% (w/v) SDS, supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were boiled at 100�C for 5 min and spun down at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant
was collected and the protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 35S labeled samples
were run in 4%–12% Nupage Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies). As a loading control, gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Life
Technologies), and destained by incubation in water. Thereafter, the gels were incubated in 11.2% (v/v) salicylic acid and 10% glyc-
erol (v/v) for 15 min. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen (Fujifilm) for a minimum of 48 hr. The screen was scanned
using the phosphorimager BAS-2500 (Fujifilm) and 35S incorporation was determined by measuring the intensity of each lane
(MultiGauge Analysis Software v2.2, Fujifilm).

 Free 35S-Methionine/-Cysteine in the Cytosol
Rat primary neurons overexpressing either GFP or aSyn-GFP were incubated with 35S-methionine and –cysteine at 100 mCi/ml for
various durations. After a quick wash with cold PBS, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for 20 min on ice and the debris was removed by
centrifugation. Proteins in the lysates were precipitated by adding 1 volume 100% TCA to 4 volume of lysate and incubate 10 min at
4�C. After centrifugation at 14K rpm for 10 min, supernatant was collected to measure a cytosolic pool of free 35S-methionine/-
cysteine. 35S incorporation was determined by quantifying using an LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter) with
5 mL of the sample being immersed in 7 mL scintillation cocktail (National Diagnostics).
Cell Lysis and Endoglycosidase H Digestion
Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton
X-100, pH to 7.4, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and
incubated in an ice/water slurry for 20 min, followed by 2 freeze-thaw cycles (�80�C/37�C, �1 min each). Supernatant was collected
after ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g, 4�C, for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Endoglycosidase (Endo) H (New England Biolabs) digestion was performed based on the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 20-40 mg bulk protein was assembled in 15.3 mL reaction volume; 1.7 mL denaturing buffer was added and samples were
boiled for 10 min at 100�C. Then 2 mL of G5 buffer and 1 mL of Endo H or 1 mL H2O were added to the denatured reaction and incubated
for 2 hr at 37�C.
Western Blotting
For protein trafficking after Endo H digestion, protein samples were denatured in sample buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 4% (v/v) glyc-
erol, 180 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0003% (v/v) bromophenol blue and 2% (v/v) SDS), run in 10% Tris-glycine gel, and wet trans-
ferred with 20% methanol onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in a 1:1 dilution of Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor
Biosciences) and PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in a 1:1 dilution of Odyssey block-
ing buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences) and PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) at 4�C overnight with gentle rocking. After three 5 min
washes with PBST, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies such as anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG conjugated to IRDye 680
or 800 (1:10,000, Rockland) in a 1:1 dilution of Odyssey blocking buffer and PBST for 2 hr at room temperature. After three 5 min
washes with PBST and two with water, blots were scanned using the Odyssey quantitative fluorescent imaging system (Li-Cor Bio-
sciences) and bands were quantitated using Odyssey Software v2.1 (Li-Cor Biosciences).
For other western blots, samples were lysed in RIPA buffer and run in either 8 or 10% Nupage Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) and
transferred using iBlot (Life Technologies). Blocking was in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST. As for the secondary antibodies and chemi-
luminescent detection, anti-mouse, -rabbit IgG or avidin conjugated to HRP was used with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent
substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
TALE-TF Design
TALE-TFs were designed to target between 200bp upstream (50) and 50bp downstream (30) of the transcription start site (TSS) of
ATXN2 or EIF2G transcripts. Within these regions near the TSS, we identified DNaseI hypersensitive regions from human ventrome-
dial prefrontal cortex samples (PMID: 22955617). Within these DNaseI HS regions, we designed 5 TALE-TFs for each transcript.
Each TALE-TF was designed to target a 14bp genomic sequence consisting of an initial thymidine (T) plus 12 full repeats and 1 half
repeat. For each TALE-TF, the TALE repeats were cloned into an rAAV transfer plasmid using a PCR-based, Golden Gate cloning
strategy as previously described (Konermann et al., 2015; Sanjana et al., 2012; Tarazona et al., 2011). The rAAV transfer plasmid con-
tained the TALE backbone fused to the synthetic VP64 activator domain along with a 2A-linked EGFP that is cleaved during
translation.
TALE-TF Assembly
14-mer transcription activator-like effector transcription factors (TALE-TFs) were constructed using Golden Gate cloning as
described previously (Sanjana et al., 2012). For each gene, ATXN2 and eIF4G1 (transcript variant 7), five different TALE-TFs were
designed with the 14 bp long target loci being located in the proximal promoter region (ATXN2 TALE-TF #1: 50-TGTCCAGA
TAAAGG-30, #2: 50-TGAACCTATGTTCC-30, #3: 50-TGCCAGATTCAGGG-30, #4: 50-TGGAGCGAGCGCCA-30, #5: 50-TAGCTGGT
CATGGT-30; eIF4G1 TALE-TF #1: 50-TGTCACGTGACGGG-30, #2: 50-TGTGGCTGTCACGT-30, #3: 50-TCAAAGTTCGGGAG-30, #4:
50-TCGCGGAACAGAGA-30, #5: 50-TCTCCTGCCTCAGC-30). For each TALE-TF the correct sequence of the DNA-binding domain
was verified by Sanger sequencing and all TALE-TF clones with non-silent mutations were excluded.
Ribosomal Footprint Profiling
For ribosome footprint profiling, 12-week old cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 ug/mL) for 5 min at 37�C to stop translation
elongation. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 9.5 mM PBS, pH 7.3, containing 100 mg ml�1 cycloheximide, and lysed by adding
lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg ml�1 cycloheximide, 1% Triton X-100,
500 U ml�1 RNasin Plus, and protease inhibitor (1x complete, EDTA-free, Roche)), scrapping cells from the plate, and then triturating
four times with a 26-gauge needle. After centrifuging the crude lysate at 1,300g for 10 min at 4 �C, the supernatant was removed and
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The lysate was thawed on ice, after which ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq were performed as
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
e11
 described previously (Subtelny et al., 2014) using a detailed protocol available at http://bartellab.wi.mit.edu/protocols.html. The
4-week old cells were washed twice with 37�C growth media, then after removing the media by aspiration the plates were sealed
and then plunged into liquid nitrogen. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer as described above, but cycloheximide was excluded
from all solutions including the sucrose gradients. After thawing on ice, a small amount of cycloheximide-free zebrafish RPF lysate
was spiked into the 4-week old cell lysates (10-fold less based on A260) prior to digestion with RNase I.
RPF and RNA-seq tags were mapped to the ORFs, as described previously (Subtelny et al., 2014). To account for the zebrafish
reads present in the 4-week old samples, indexes comprising both the zebrafish and human genomes or transcriptomes were
created and these data were mapped to the combined indexes. Only reads mapping uniquely were considered, and those mapping
to zebrafish were excluded from the analysis.
Enriched pathways in the translational profiling for the 4-week and 12-week datasets were computed with the Gene Set Enrich-
ment Analysis tool, available at the Broad Institute website (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Comparison with Existing Homology Prediction Approaches
To evaluate the functional association between yeast proteins and the predicted human homologs, we computed the average ac-
curacy of Gene Ontology (GO) of the top 5 homologs predicted by our method, HHpred and BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990, 1997; Ash-
burner et al., 2000; Tuncbag et al., 2013) (Figure S3B). We chose the top 5 homologs since yeast proteins often have more than one
good human homolog. The accuracy of a homolog was calculated as the percentage of overlapped GO labels between the yeast
protein and the putative homolog. We noted that the number of assigned GO labels per gene varied considerably between yeast
and human proteomes, so that the GO accuracy metric favored predicted homologs with a large number of labels and query proteins
with a small number of GO labels, potentially biasing the analysis. Furthermore, false positives were not considered by this metric. To
address these issues, we computed the widely used Jaccard similarity score, which is the number of overlapping GO labels divided
by the total number of unique GO labels of the yeast (or human) gene and its human (or yeast) homolog. BLAST’s accuracy for 4023
yeast proteins was 31.1%. HHpred in conjunction with BLAST achieved of 32.6% for accuracy for 4312 yeast proteins. Our method
obtained 31.6% accuracy for a significantly greater number, 4923, of yeast proteins. It also outperformed BLAST on 4023 yeast pro-
teins with BLAST output (32.0% versus 31.1% accuracy and 25.2% versus 24.3% Jaccard similarity) and HHpred on 4312 proteins
with HHpred output (34.1% versus 32.6% accuracy and 26.9% versus 24.9% Jaccard Similarity). The improvements over BLAST
and HHpred were significant (paired t test p values < 0.01).
We then tested our method on finding yeast homologs for human proteins (Figures 3C and 3D). The improvement of the coverage
over BLAST and HHpred was even more substantial than for generating human homologs from yeast proteins. Our method predicted
homologs for 15200 proteins but BLAST and HHpred only covered a relatively small portion of human proteome (7248 and 9577
respectively). Accuracy metrics also favored the DCA method. Our method improved the predictive power over BLAST (57.6%
versus 57% accuracy and 26% versus 26.6% Jaccard similarity) and HHpred (56% versus 54.9% accuracy and 25% versus
24.2% Jaccard similarity) on proteins which BLAST or HHpred can find yeast homologs on both GO accuracy and Jaccard similarity
score. These comparisons were all statistically significant (all p values < 0.01 by paired t test).
We also compared our homology tool to the state-of-the-art Ensembl Compara method. Ensembl Compara identifies high confi-
dence homolog pairs through phylogenetic tree-based clustering and analysis across multiple species. This sequence-based
method sacrifices coverage for accuracy, and these pairs are considered a gold standard for traditional analyses (Vilella et al.,
2009). We downloaded the Ensembl Compara v85, and mapped gene ids to the gene names used in our homology tool, identifying
5093 high-confidence yeast/human pairs for 2409 yeast genes. Among these pairs, there are three major categories: ‘‘one-to-one,’’
‘‘one-to-many’’ and ‘‘many-to-many.’’ To evaluate our DCA homology tool, we checked whether it performed at least as well for high-
confidence yeast/human pairs, whether predicted as one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many by Ensembl Compara. Since or-
thology relationships between human and yeast genes can be ambiguous due to their remote evolutionary distance, DCA and
Ensemble Compara may predict different putative homologs, especially for the many-to-many case. For such cases, we also
computed the GO accuracy as the percentage of overlapping GO labels between a yeast protein and the predicted homolog. For
clear one-to-one pairs by Ensembl Compara, DCA differed in only 25 of 1040 genes. Of those 25 genes that differed, our method
achieved comparable accuracy in ontology prediction (0.394) as compared to Ensembl Compara (0.388) based on ontology match-
ing. There were 1518 entries in the ‘‘many2many’’ prediction category. For these, our method achieved a correct pairing (0.414)
equivalent to Ensembl Compara (0.412). Finally, for the yeast genes in which a one-to-many correspondence was predicted, there
were 2535 entries. Again, our method identified homologs by gene ontology (0.391) similar to Ensembl Compara (0.390). Among the
differences, we observed most of them to be similar genes within the same family; moreover, these differences are not statistically
significant. Thus, our approach does not disrupt homology prediction for high-confidence orthology pairs, a surrogate for false-pos-
itivity in the absence of any other gold standard yeast-to-human homolog pairing. From these results, we demonstrated that DCA
provides comparable yeast-to-human accuracy as Ensembl Compara for the same input yeast genes.
Recently, Kachroo et al.(Kachroo et al., 2015)carefully tested 414 essential yeast genes for complementation by homologs that
were clear by sequence. Thus, for each of these 414 yeast/human gene pairs, the complementation assay provided a binary and
experimentally strong readout of homology. Kachroo et al. developed a method to predict which of these high confidence pairs
were likely to be actual positive complementation pairs. They utilized more than 100 features, including careful manual curation of
e12
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
 sequence properties, network features, transcriptional and translational features, and expression abundances, to establish a predic-
tive tool. They showed that this predictive tool could be trained on a subset of the experimentally tested yeast/human pairs to
correctly identify functional replaceability in a separate test set. To demonstrate the effectiveness of integration of DCA, we trained
a DCA-based classifier, using only sequence and network information, to predicted true yeast-human complementation pairs. In
particular, to check the predictive power of our DCA pipeline, we built a classifier based on the low-dimensional gene vectors ob-
tained from our joint DCA learning pipeline. For each pair of yeast/human genes, we built features based on the gene vectors to
consider their sequence similarity and topological roles in their molecular networks. These features, including element-wise product
and difference and sum of two gene vectors, were used as input to a gradient boosted forest classifier. We tested whether this clas-
sifier, for our more elemental, automated DCA tool based on only sequence/network features, could be tuned to also predict the
functional complementation between yeast and human. When we trained our DCA classifier via 5-fold cross-validation on the
yeast/human pairs from Kachroo et al. we achieved a high rate of prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.82, SD = 0.08). This was comparable
to the intricate, manual integrated method of Kachroo et al., demonstrating that our automated homology tool, based on only
sequence and network topology, is sufficient for training a classifier for this specific homology task. It is worth noting that methods
utilizing sequence-similarity alone, including BLAST and HHpred, performed considerably worse than DCA (0.70 and 0.69, respec-
tively). It is clear that our DCA-based classifier, which effectively integrates network topology and sequence similarity, is just as effec-
tive as the method in Kachroo et al. that utilizes more than 100 features, thus overcoming the barrier of major time-consuming manual
feature curation.
Evaluation of PCSF and Humanized Steiner Networks
We tested PCSF on two separate datasets and demonstrate vastly superior performance when compared to existing methods. For
comparison, we identified two popular algorithms, DAPPLE (Rossin et al., 2011) and PEXA (Tu et al., 2009), and implemented them.
Both methods take seed genes and identify subnetworks that span the seed genes to reveal possible functional interconnectedness
of these genes. The first algorithm, DAPPLE, identifies significant direct and one-hop indirect edges in the human interactome to con-
nect as many seed genes as possible. The second algorithm, PEXA, utilizes existing pathway annotations, such as KEGG or Reac-
tome, to cover seed genes. Merging and pruning are then applied to link connected components and remove hanging genes. For
these comparisons, we provided each algorithm with yeast-to-human homology links and injected yeast interaction edges into
the human network, just as we provide for our PCSF method. For DAPPLE, we used the predicted dense network with significant
one-hop indirect edges, since the sparse direct network is not able to identify hidden genes. We curated hits from 15 complete
screens in yeast (Tong et al., 2004). In these screens, a gene is deleted as well as its genetic interactors or modifiers. We used these
genetic modifiers as input for the network algorithms. The inactivated gene was hidden from the algorithm, and was used to evaluate
the predicted network. Taking cues from previously-published methods (Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009), here we considered an algorithm
successful in discovering the cellular response if the predicted hidden human genes were significantly enriched for specific gene
ontology biological process terms attributed to the hidden inactivated yeast gene (hypergeometric test; p value < 0.01). We gener-
ated humanized networks with PCSF, and two alternative methods: DAPPLE (Rossin et al., 2011) and PEXA (Tu et al., 2009). For these
screens, the success rate of PCSF was 47%, as compared to DAPPLE and PEXA which were 6.6% and 13%, respectively. These
results suggest superior performance of PCSF over DAPPLE and PEXA.
To better understand the relevance of genes and predicted pathways recovered by PCSF, DAPPLE and PEXA, we designed a
well-controlled simulation. To mimic genetic screens of perturbed pathways, we selected individual pathways from the well-known
human pathway database KEGG and identified all genes in each pathway (Table S15). We then identified yeast homologs via strin-
gent Ensembl one-to-one mapping. We treated those human genes with clear yeast homologs as ‘‘perturbed’’ and picked their ho-
mologs’ genetic interaction neighboring genes as hits from a ‘‘virtual yeast genetic screen.’’ Virtual screens like these minimize exper-
imental noise as a confounding factor and enable cleaner evaluation of algorithm performance. Since we know the ‘‘true’’ pathway
information, this method can be used to test the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms by quantifying how often ‘‘relevant’’ genes in
the original KEGG pathway are recovered as predicted (non-seed) genes. We chose 50 KEGG pathways that had at least 5 human
genes with clear yeast homologs and created 50 associated ‘‘virtual’’ screens for testing (Table S15). We used two performance met-
rics: precision, i.e., the percentage of predicted hidden genes shown in the original KEGG pathway, and recall, i.e., the percentage of
the original KEGG genes shown as hidden nodes in the predicted pathway. Ideally, these values would be 100% for perfect predic-
tions. For PCSF, the average precision and recall values are 63% and 74% resp. In contrast, for DAPPLE, the average precision and
recall values are 6% and 47% resp., whereas for PEXA, they are 8% and 83% resp. The differences between three precision values
are substantial: PCSF has much higher precision within very compact subnetworks, while both DAPPLE and PEXA predict huge ‘‘hair
ball’’ networks with low precision. It is worth noting that PEXA has a very high recall value likely because it uses the KEGG pathways to
build networks, and thus predictably has high recall (because the simulated screens here are generated from KEGG pathways); how-
ever, its precision metric is very low.
Further, we tested the effectiveness of injected yeast genetic interactions into networks through the simulated yeast genetic
screens we generated, and cross-compare our PCSF method with the other algorithms, DAPPLE and PEXA. First, we tested perfor-
mance by removing all injected yeast interactions. For PCSF, the average precision and recall values are 37% and 54% resp. For
DAPPLE, the average precision and recall values are 8% and 27% resp. Compared to the precision and recall results (i.e., 63%
and 74% for PCSF versus 6% and 47% for DAPPLE), it is clear that both PCSF and DAPPLE have much lower recall if yeast inter-
actions are excluded. This analysis thus confirms with data that injection of yeast interactions into ‘‘humanized’’ networks provide key
Cell Systems 4, 157–170.e1–e14, February 22, 2017
e13
 connections between genetic modifiers to the perturbed genes. For PEXA, the average precision value is 9%, similar to that with
yeast injection, whereas the recall rate is again predictably very high. Second, we tested the effects of randomly removing a portion
of injected genetic interactions over 10 trials. The average precision and recall values are shown in Figure S4, demonstrating the rela-
tionship between the accuracy of these methods and the percentage of injected yeast interactions. A notable observation is that the
performance becomes reasonable when >40% of interactions are injected. The performance of PEXA remains relatively unchanged
because it utilizes the human KEGG pathway information in its algorithm, as noted above. In terms of false-positives and -negatives,
there is clearly a trade-off between the different methods. PCSF works best for our current work, as PCSF identifies a small set of
relevant genes for cost-effective experimental explorations.
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis for Cell-Based Assays
Sample sizes for all experimentation were chosen based on our previous extensive experience with the methods and assays in these
studies. For most experiments in mammalian cells, robustness and consistency of the results are typically established after three
biological replicates are analyzed. Unless otherwise stated in the figure legends, this was the standard number of replicates required
for all experiments. For all human and rat cellular experiments, significance was then determined by appropriate statistical tests that
are standard in the field. The two-tail t test was applied when there were only two conditions to compare within the experiments. One-
Way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons post hoc test was performed when experiments include multiple conditions. Data points
were excluded based on the following pre-established criteria: 1) errors were introduced to the particular sample while performing the
experiments, 2) the values are greater or less than two standard deviation from the mean. For yeast spot assays, results were consid-
ered significant when three biological replicates (unless otherwise stated) demonstrated the same trend by eye. Methods used for
Figure 5E are outlined in the figure legend. For the pooled screen yeast assay (Figures 4A and S6) detailed statistical methods for
reads and cutoff thresholds are supplied above in the methods. The statistical methods for the computational analysis are described
in detail in the methods sections above.
