Abstract
Importance—Marijuana use is increasingly common in the US. It is unclear whether it has long 
term effects on memory and other domains of cognitive function.
Objective—To study the association between cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana use and 
cognitive performance in mid-life.
Design, Setting and Participants—We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a cohort of black and white men and women 18 
to 30 years of age at baseline in 1986 (Year 0) and followed over 25 years, to estimate cumulative 
years of exposure to marijuana (=365 days of marijuana use) using repeated measures and to

 assess associations with cognitive function at Year 25. Linear regression was used to adjust for 
demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, tobacco smoking and alcohol, illicit drugs, 
physical activity, depression, and Mirror Star Tracing Test (a measure of cognitive function) at 
Year 2.
Main Outcome Measures—Three domains of cognitive function were assessed at Year 25 
using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory), the Digital Symbol Substitution 
Test (processing speed) and the Stroop Interference Test (executive function).
Results—Among 3385 Year 25 CARDIA participants with cognitive function measurements, 
2852 (84%) reported past marijuana use, but only 392 (9%) continued to use marijuana into 
middle age. Current use of marijuana was associated with worse verbal memory and processing 
speed; cumulative lifetime exposure was associated with all three domains of cognitive function. 
After excluding current users and adjusting for potential confounders, cumulative lifetime 
exposure to marijuana remained strongly associated with verbal memory. For each 5 years of past 
exposure, verbal memory was 0.13 standardized units lower (95% confidence interval (CI):−0.24 
to −0.02, p=0.02), corresponding to 1 of 2 participants on average remembering one word less 
from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use. After adjustment, we found no associations with 
lower executive function (−0.03, 95%CI: −0.12 to 0.07) or processing speed (−0.04, 95%CI: −0.16 
to 0.08).
Conclusion and Relevance—Past exposure to marijuana is associated with worse verbal 
memory, but does not appear to impact other domains of cognitive function.
Marijuana use is common among adolescents and young adults. Data from the US in 2012 
indicate that among 12th graders (aged 17–18 years old), 37% had used marijuana within the 
last year, 23% within the last 30 days and 6.5% daily.1 If marijuana has significant adverse 
long-term effects, marijuana use early in life may have important public health 
consequences. Long-term effects from marijuana use, however, can be difficult to detect.
Impaired cognitive function (CF) is an acute effect of marijuana use,2 and there is increasing 
evidence that those effects may persist later in life.3–5 Heavy, long term use of marijuana has 
been associated with cognitive impairment, particularly in learning and remembering new 
information.3,6 Evidence from population-based studies, however, is scarce and it remains 
unclear whether there are long-term effects from low intensity or occasional marijuana use 
earlier in life3, and whether the magnitude and persistence of impairment depends on the 
duration of cannabis use or the age of exposure.4,5
With 25 years of repeated measurements of marijuana exposure starting in early adulthood, 
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study provides a 
unique opportunity to study the long-term effects of marijuana exposure among community-
based adults. In Year 25, CARDIA measured cognitive performance using standardized tests 
of verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. We used these measurements to 
study the association between cumulative years of exposure to marijuana use and cognitive 
performance in mid-life among CARDIA participants with marijuana exposures typical of 
the communities in which they live

 METHODS
Study Design and Sample
We used data collected over 25 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young 
Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based epidemiological study of 5115 adults aged 18 
to 35 years at baseline.7 Participants were recruited in 1985 and 1986 by random selection of 
telephone numbers from designated census tracts in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; 
Minneapolis, MN; and by random selection from the membership list of a health care plan in 
Oakland, CA. The sampling scheme was designed to achieve a balance at each of the 4 sites 
by race (self-identified “black, not Hispanic” and “white, not Hispanic”), sex, education 
(high school degree or less, more than high school), and age (18–24 years, 25–30 years). All 
subjects gave informed consent before entering the study and at each visit and the approval 
of institutional review boards was obtained at each site.
Marijuana Exposure: Current and Cumulative
Current marijuana use was assessed at each in-person CARDIA visit (at baseline and after 
2,5,7,10,15,20 and 25 years of follow up) using the following survey question: “During the 
last 30 days, on how many days did you use marijuana?” Direct self-reported lifetime 
exposure was assessed using the question: “About how many times in your lifetime have you 
used marijuana?”. We used current and lifetime use to compute marijuana-years, with one 
year of exposure equivalent to 365 days of marijuana use (see example in eMethods in 
Supplement).8 We assumed that current use at each visit (i.e. the number of days of using 
marijuana during the month before each visit) reflected the average number of days of use 
during the months before and after each visit. We estimated the cumulative lifetime use by 
adding up the total number of days using marijuana over follow-up. We adjusted our 
estimate upwards whenever directly self-reported lifetime use was higher than our computed 
estimates.8
Outcome Measure
CF was assessed by trained and certified CARDIA technicians who administered a battery 
of three cognitive tests at the Year 25 visit.9 The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) mainly assesses verbal memory through the ability to memorize and retrieve lists 
of 15 words. The RAVLT yields three separate scores; in the main analyses we used the 
delayed (25 min) free recall score only (and tested the other two in sensitivity, 
Supplement).10 The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) assesses visual motor speed, 
executive function, sustained attention, and working memory; we refer to this domain as 
processing speed.11 The Stroop Interference Test evaluates the ability to view complex 
visual stimuli and to respond to one stimulus dimension while suppressing the response to 
another dimension; we refer to this domain as executive function.12,13 The resulting 
interference score provides a measure of how much additional executive processing is 
needed to respond to an incongruent trial; thus, a higher interference score indicates worse 
performance on the task. The inverse of this score was used in the present analyses such that 
increasing scores indicate better performance. Each measure was standardized by dividing 
the score by the within-CARDIA standard deviation and subtracting the mean such that 
absolute and relative differences in these standardized measures are comparable.

 Other Covariates
Cigarette smoking behavior was evaluated during each in-person CARDIA visit and at 
yearly contacts over the phone between CARDIA visits. These data were used to estimate 
cumulative lifetime exposure to cigarettes in terms of pack-years, with 1 pack-year of 
exposure equivalent to smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for a year.8 We estimated 
lifetime alcohol consumption in “drink-years,” defining 1 drink-year as the amount of 
alcohol consumed in 1 year by a person consuming 1 drink/day (eMethods in 
Supplement).14 Acute heavy exposure to alcohol (bingeing) was defined as reporting 5 or 
more drinks on one occasion, and we estimated total lifetime episodes. We estimated total 
number of lifetime exposures to cocaine (including other forms of cocaine such as crack, 
powder, free base), amphetamines (speed, uppers, methamphetamines) and heroin 
(eMethods in Supplement).15,16 Education was measured as the maximum educational grade 
attained for each participant across reports at each visit. Physical activity was measured with 
the CARDIA Physical Activity History questionnaire, which queries the amount of time per 
week spent in 13 categories of leisure, occupational, and household physical activities over 
the past 12 months.17 Self-reported depression was measured every five years starting at the 
Year 5 visit using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D).18 We 
used cardiovascular risk factor measurements including blood pressure, blood cholesterol 
(total-, LDL-,HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides), fasting glucose and body mass index 
(BMI), and calculated cumulative exposures to these and for physical activity and depression 
(area under the curve for continuous measurements, see eMethods in Supplement).19 The 
number of years using antidepressant medication was computed by adding the number of 
years reporting the use of one or more antidepressant medication (eMethods in Supplement). 
Self-reported schizophrenia was based on self-reported mental disease, reasons for 
hospitalizations and reasons for taking a psychoactive medication (eMethods in 
Supplement). At Year 2, the mirror star tracing test was conducted to elicit reactive blood 
pressure. In the mirror star-tracing test, participants had to trace the outline of a star from a 
reversed image displayed in a mirror while staying within narrow limits.20,21 Study 
participants were instructed to draw stars as quickly as possible with the fewest possible 
errors. If they moved out of the limits of the star, an error was scored. Total stars completed 
and total numbers of errors over three minutes were recorded. Although initially intended as 
a stressor to measure blood pressure reactivity and not as a cognitive test,20,22 some have 
suggested that the mirror star tracing test measures aspects of executive function.21,23
Statistical analyses
We used descriptive statistics to compare participants with different levels of exposure to 
marijuana at the Year 25 visit. We then described unadjusted associations between marijuana 
use (current and lifetime) and each CF measure, before and after standardization. Current 
and lifetime marijuana exposure were strongly associated with each other, and their potential 
effects on CF were difficult to tease apart due to co-linearity and potential interactions in 
their effects on CF. Given our primary goal of assessing potential effects of cumulative 
exposure, we eliminated the obscuring influence of current marijuana uses by excluding the 
minority of CARDIA participants who were currently using marijuana at the Year 25 visit in 
our primary analyses. We used linear regression to assess independent associations between 
years of exposure to marijuana and CF outcomes. We estimated a sequence of models: the

 first model was unadjusted; the second model controlled for the covariates used to achieve a 
balance of sampling in CARDIA: age, race/ethnicity, sex, study center and years of 
education. The third additionally controlled for covariates potentially associated with both 
marijuana and cognition: alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines and heroin, age participants 
started smoking cigarettes, cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, BMI, depression, 
and diabetes at the Year 25 visit. Education, drink-years of alcohol, physical activity and 
BMI were flexibly modeled using restricted cubic splines with three knots at the quartiles of 
their distributions. To minimize potential bias due to informative censoring, we used inverse 
probability of censoring weights (IPCW) (eMethods in Supplement).24 We adjusted for the 
mirror star tracing score at Year 2 (near baseline) to minimize reverse causation as an 
explanation for any associations between marijuana use, and we also assessed correlations 
between mirror star tracing and Year 25 cognition and marijuana use to further investigate 
this potential issue (see eMethods and eResults in Supplement for details). Schizophrenia 
and psychotropic medication have been associated with both cognitive impairment and 
marijuana use and could therefore act as confounder of the association between marijuana 
and CF.25,26 We evaluated the sensitivity of the analyses to inclusion of self-reported 
schizophrenia (see eMethods) as a covariate in the multivariate adjusted models and by 
exclusion of participants with self-reported schizophrenia. We also tested the sensitivity of 
the results by inclusion of psychoactive medications in the main multivariate model. We also 
tested the association between cumulative years of exposure to marijuana with the 
components of the RAVLT (eResults and eFigure 1 in Supplement). Tests of statistical 
significance were 2-tailed, with an alpha level of 0.05. All analyses were conducted using 
STATA 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Of the 3,499 participants re-assessed at the Year 25 visit, 3,385 (97%) had data on CF and 
3,326 (95%) had complete data on all three cognitive outcomes. Attrition was more common 
among men, blacks, heavy marijuana users, tobacco smokers and cocaine users (eResults in 
Supplement). Most participants (n=2852, 84%) reported having used marijuana before or 
during the 25 years of follow-up, but most had relatively few cumulative years of exposure 
(Table 1). Total years of marijuana exposure was strongly associated with other participant 
characteristics including race/sex, education, study site, other substance use, physical 
activity, BMI, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, total number of stars completed and errors 
on the mirror star tracing test and weakly associated with depressive symptoms and 
antidepressant medication use (Table 1).
In unadjusted analyses, current marijuana use at the Year 25 visit was associated with worse 
verbal memory (RAVLT) and processing speed (DSST) (eTable 1), while lifetime exposure 
was associated with worse performance on all three CF measures (Table 2). In preliminary 
analyses, we found evidence of a negative interaction between years of marijuana use and 
current use at the Year 25 visit in both unadjusted (p<0.001) and multivariate adjusted 
models (p=0.03) for the RAVLT, such that past marijuana use appeared to be less important 
as a predictor of verbal memory among participants who were currently using marijuana 
(eResults in Supplement). With or without exclusion of current users, lifetime exposure to 
marijuana was associated with reductions in all three CF measures (Table 2).

 In fully adjusted analyses excluding current users, lifetime exposure to marijuana remained 
strongly associated with worse verbal memory (RAVLT), even after extensive adjustment for 
other factors associated with marijuana use and mirror star tracing scores at the Year 2 visit 
(Table 3). The association was dose-dependent, with no evidence of non-linearity (Figure); 
each additional 5 years of exposure to marijuana was associated with 0.13 lower standard 
deviations in the verbal memory test (RAVLT, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02–0.24, 
p=0.02; Table 3). In contrast, adjusted models demonstrated no association of cumulative 
marijuana exposure with processing speed and executive function (DSST and Stroop, Table 
3). In multivariate adjusted analyses, total number of stars completed and errors were not 
associated with higher marijuana use at the Year 2 visit and over 25 years of follow-up 
(eMethods and eResults in Supplement). Total number of stars completed and errors were 
associated with CF scores at the Year 25 visit in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses 
(eMethods and eResults in Supplement). In exploratory analyses, the attenuation of the 
association between marijuana exposure and all three measures of CF was mostly seen after 
adjustment for race-sex strata and education. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no evidence 
of significant interactions by race or sex (p>0.10 for all tests).
Our method of identifying participants with a potential diagnosis of schizophrenia through 
self-reported mental disease, reasons for hospitalizations and reasons for taking 
psychoactive medication identified 28 participants in the entire CARDIA cohort (0.6%; 
28/5114). Of those, 14 attended the Year 25 visit (0.4%; 14/3371) compared to 14 not 
attending (0.8%; 14/1716; P=0.07 for not attending the Year 25 visit). Results were virtually 
unchanged when including this covariate in the main multivariate adjusted model and the 
IPCWs or excluding these participants from the main analyses. Similarly, inclusion of the 
predictor of anti-depressant medication led to similar results.
COMMENT
In this large, community-based cohort of white and black young adults followed over 25 
years, we found a dose-dependent independent association between cumulative lifetime 
exposure to marijuana and worsening verbal memory in middle age. For each additional 5 
marijuana-years of exposure (1825 days of use), verbal memory was 0.13 standard 
deviations lower than for never users after full adjustment, corresponding to less than 1 of 2 
participants remembering one word less from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use, on 
average. We found no significant associations of cumulative exposure with executive 
function or processing speed.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating associations between heavy 
marijuana exposure and CF, but the association with lower levels of marijuana exposure has 
not previously been demonstrated.3–5,27,28 In one study, for example, the association with 
verbal memory was only apparent among heavy long-term marijuana users (N=51),4 defined 
as using marijuana every day or nearly every day for over 20 years (23.9 years of use) 
compared to more recent use (10.2 years of use, N=51) or non-users (N=33). In another, 
investigators used 38-years of follow-up data from 1037 participants in a birth cohort in New 
Zealand and found that persistent regular cannabis use (4 days/week or more) was associated 
with neuropsychological decline, while those who reported non-regular use (50.6% of the

 total) showed no decline in IQ or neuropsychological performance.5 Similarly, a longitudinal 
study with 10 years of follow-up found evidence of a cognitive decline with heavy marijuana 
use,28 but those who stopped using during follow-up did not show a decline in IQ score. In 
contrast, with more detailed measurement of lifetime marijuana exposure in a larger sample, 
we were able to detect a negative association at lower levels of cumulative use and among 
persons with remote past exposure to marijuana.
The extent of association between worse verbal memory and cumulative marijuana use is of 
uncertain clinical significance. In the context of cognitive decline after stroke, Levine et al 
used a 0.5 SD cut-off for defining a clinically meaningful decline in global cognition.29 The 
point estimate for verbal memory in our study for those with 5 marijuana-years of exposure 
(0.13 SD; 95% CI: −0.24 to −0.02) is of lesser magnitude than the decline found in the study 
by Levine et al. and the confidence intervals excludes the 0.5 SD cut-off. However, 
participants with up to 10 marijuana-years of exposure might have a significant decline in 
verbal memory given the lower bound of the 95% CI. Similarly, participants with current 
daily marijuana in the month before the Year 25 visit might have a clinically significant 
decrease in verbal memory and other measures of CF (eResults in Supplement).
The mechanism by which marijuana exposure might impact verbal memory is unclear, but 
might be explained by the potential effect of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on how 
information is processed in the hippocampus.30 Marijuana use has been associated with 
functional changes in the activation brain regions involved in associative learning,31 
particularly in the para-hippocampal regions and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.31–33 
Some have found suggestions of lower hippocampal and amygdala volumes in heavy, long-
term users (>5 joints daily for more than 10 years),34 as well as alterations in the cerebellum, 
the frontal cortex,31 and medial temporal cortex33, though other researchers were unable to 
confirm these findings.30,35 Numerous methodological issues such as variation in imaging 
techniques and in measurement of exposures, dose-threshold effects and small sample sizes 
limit the possibility for drawing strong conclusions on the published findings.31,33
Our study has important limitations. We constructed a marijuana exposure measurement 
from self-reported information collected prospectively and periodically over 25 years, but 
self-report is not always reliable,36 measurements were infrequent, and age of exposure, 
especially during adolescence and young adulthood was not queried. However, even if 
imprecise, the repeated question over the 25 years was prospectively obtained and allowed 
us to demonstrate a potential deleterious association, one that is not easily studied without a 
large, well-characterized cohort with long-term follow-up such as CARDIA. Another 
limitation is the availability of CF measurements at only 1 time point, which limits our 
ability to pinpoint when a change in the outcome might have occurred and relate it in time to 
a change in exposure. We found no significant change in the measure of association between 
cumulative marijuana exposure and measures of CF after inclusion of mirror star tracing 
score measured early in life (Year 2 visit). Even with this adjustment, we cannot rule out 
reverse causation as an explanation for our results.5 While some have suggested that the 
mirror star tracing test measures aspects of executive function,21,23 no study has compared 
the CF domains measured in the mirror star tracing test and those measured in the other tests 
used at the Year 25 visit. Factors strongly associated with marijuana use could confound the

 association between marijuana and CF. The New Zealand study, for example, has been 
criticized for lack of adequate control over socio-economic status (SES), even though 
additional analyses have shown that controlling for SES did not attenuate the association 
between sustained daily marijuana use and worse intellectual quotient (IQ).38 In our study, 
the observed associations were substantially attenuated by control for core demographic 
variables, including education, race and gender. However, adjustment for a host of additional 
behavioral, psychosocial, and cardiovascular risk factors available, including self-reported 
schizophrenia and psychoactive medication, did not further attenuate the estimates.
We found past exposure to marijuana use to be significantly associated with worse verbal 
memory in middle age. Future studies with multiple assessments of cognition, brain 
imaging, and other functional outcomes should further explore these associations and their 
potential clinical and public health implications. In the meantime, with recent changes in 
legislation and the potential for increasing marijuana use in the US,39 continuing to warn 
potential users about the possible harm from exposure to marijuana seems reasonable.40

 Figure. Associations between lifetime exposure to marijuana and cognitive function (CF)
Years of marijuana modeled flexibly and current marijuana users at the Year 25 visit 
excluded (N=392). Results are adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, study site, education, 
cigarette smoking, alcohol, illicit drug use, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, mirror 
star tracing at the Year 2 visit and differential likelihood of follow up (see Methods). All test 
results standardized, such that a 1 unit negative deviation indicates a standard deviation 
worse CF than the mean. Histograms describe the distribution of marijuana-years in 
CARDIA participants with any exposure to marijuana by presenting the frequency of

bRow percent are presented for binary variables and column percents for variables with more than one category.
cP values are from 1-way analyses of variance for age, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides; from a χ2 test for race-sex, college education, center, 
income, and alcohol use category; and from a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for pack-years, years of education, cigarettes smoked per day, drink-years, binge-drinking days and physical activity. All P 
values are two sided.
dBy design, the CARDIA study sampled self-identified white men, white women, black men and black women in roughly equal numbers for participation in the study.42
eCategories based on the answer to the question: “During the last 30 days, on how many days did you use marijuana?”
fCumulative lifetime exposure to cigarettes in terms of pack-years, with 1 pack-year of exposure equivalent to 7300 cigarettes (1 year × 365 days/y × 1 pack/d × 20 cigarettes/pack)(Methods).8
gCategories of alcohol consumption were based on the sex-specific weekly maximum drinking limits published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [for men >14 (women >7) 
standard drinks/week or >4 (>3) drinks/day].43
hDrink-years in those reporting ever drinking alcohol. A drink-year was defined as the total amount of ethanol consumed by a person who had one alcoholic drink per day for 1 year (1 drink-year = 17.24 ml 
of ethanol/drink × 1 drink/day × 365 days/year = 6,292.6 ml of ethanol).
iBinge-drinking days defined as >4 drinks per episode (eMethods in Supplement). If bingeing were to be constant over 25 years in one individual, 250 binge drinking days would correspond to 10 episodes 
of bingeing per year over 25 years.
jCurrent use defined as any use within the last 30 days. The number of days on the illicit drug listed over the study duration was computed using current exposure at each visit and replaced by lifetime 
exposure when the latter was higher. Cocaine included other forms of cocaine such as crack, powder, free base; amphetamines included speed, uppers and metamphetamines (Methods and eMethods in 
Supplement).
kPhysical activity measured with the CARDIA Physical Activity History questionnaire, which queries the amount of time per week spent in 13 categories of leisure, occupational, and household physical 
activities over the past 12 months.17
lCalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
mSelf-reported depression was measured every five years starting at the Year 5 visit by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D).18 A score of ≥16 used as the cut-off value for 
both sexes as an indication of the clinically significant depressive symptoms.44
nAntidepressant and mood stabilizing medications recorded at each clinical visits (eMethods in Supplement).
oSelf-reported schizophrenia based on self-reported mental disease, reasons for hospitalizations and reasons for taking an psychoactive medication (eMethods in Supplement)
pMirror star tracing performed at the Year 2 visit to test blood pressure reactivity which tests cognitive domains similar to the Stroop test (see Methods). 280 out of 3,385 participants (8%) with missing data 
on mirror star tracing.

aCumulative exposure to marijuana expressed in ‘marijuana-years’, with 1 marijuana-year of exposure equivalent to 365 days of marijuana use (see 
Methods). Current marijuana users within the 30 days prior of the Year 25 visit excluded (N=392).
bYears of marijuana exposure was modeled first as a 5-level categorical predictor, and then as a continuous linear predictor, per 5 marijuana-years 
(separate models).
cLinear regression models used to determine the association between CF scores and cumulative exposure to marijuana use. Negative standardized 
scores indicate worse CF.
dThe inverse of the Stroop score used in the present analyses to allow interpretation of worse CF with negative standardized scores for all three CF 
tests.
fAdjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, study site and years of education. Analyses weighted by the inverse probability of censoring (IPCW) to 
address potential bias by informative censoring (eMethods).
gModel described in f additionally adjusted for cumulative and current exposure to licit and illicit substances and other covariates (see Methods).
hModel described in g additionally adjusted for total number of stars completed and errors made drawing the stars. Participants with missing data 
on mirror star tracing excluded (N=280).
