Abstract
Objective: To study the salt and sugars content of breakfast cereals sold in the UK
between 1992 and 2015.
Design: Cross-sectional surveys on salt and sugars content collected from the
nutrition information panel of breakfast cereals in 1992, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2012
and 2015.
Setting: All major UK retailers operating at that moment in time (approximately ten).
Subjects: The salt and sugars content was collected from product packaging and
the nutrition information panels.
Results: Cereals consistently surveyed across all five years (n 22) showed a
significant reduction in salt content of 47 % (P < 0·001). Sugars content of breakfast
cereals (n 15), however, did not show a significant change; 25·65 g/100 g in 1992
and 22·45 g/100 g in 2015 (P = 0·170). There was a large variation in salt and sugars
content between different categories and within the same type of category.
Conclusions: The study shows the progressive reduction in salt content of breakfast
cereals in the UK since 2004 as a result of the successful salt reduction programme,
particularly the setting of incremental salt targets. Further reductions in salt content
need to be made as cereals remain a major contributor to salt intake. Sugars content,
however, has been consistently high due to the lack of a sugar reduction strategy. The
research demonstrates that the sugars content of breakfast cereals in the UK is of
concern, particularly in children’s breakfast cereals, with a typical serving (30g)
containing a third of a 4–6-year-old’s maximum daily recommendation (19g/d) for
free sugars intake in the UK. More can and should be done to reformulate, with an
urgent need to set incremental sugar reduction targets.

Reformulation
The food and drink we consume is now the biggest cause
of death and ill health, owing to the excessive amounts of
salt, saturated fat and sugars in our diet(1,2). A diet high in
salt has long been shown to increase blood pressure
and consequently put one at increased risk of CVD(3,4).
Populations around the world are consuming salt in quantities
that far exceed physiological requirements(5). As such, the
WHO has recommended salt reduction as one of the top
three priority actions to tackle the non-communicable disease
crisis(6), with a global aim to limit daily salt intake by at least
30% towards a target of less than 5g/d, by 2025(7).
Obesity(8,9), type 2 diabetes(10,11) and dental caries(12–15)
are also major public health problems in the UK, with sig-
nificant costs to the health service(16). It is now recognised
that
excessive
free
sugars
consumption
is
associated
with
these
conditions(17–21).
‘Free
sugars’
includes
all
monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the
manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally pre-
sent in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices. Under
this definition, lactose (milk sugar) when naturally present in
milk and milk products and sugars contained within the
cellular structure of foods (particularly fruits and vegetables)
are excluded.
In July 2015, the Scientific Advisory Committee on
Nutrition recommended the average intake of free sugars
across the UK population should not exceed 5 % of total
energy intake (19 g/d for children aged 4–6 years, 24 g/d
for children aged 7–10 years and 30 g/d for those aged
11 years or above, including adults). This is in line with
the WHO’s new guidelines on free sugars intake(19,22).
According to the latest figures from the National Diet and
Nutrition Survey, current average intakes of free sugars
exceed recommendations in all age groups(23), with an
average sugars intake of 59·0g/d among 19–64-year-olds,

 equivalent to 987kJ/d (236kcal/d) and 12·1% of total energy
intake. Children have a higher sugars intake; the average
intake was 60·3 and 74·2g/d in 4–10- and 11–18-year-olds,
respectively. These figures are likely to be an underestimate
of how much free sugars is consumed(24) due to a high
prevalence of under-reporting in this survey(25–28).
The main sources of salt and free sugars in our diet are
manufactured foods(21,23,29–31). With this in mind, the most
cost-effective strategy to improve public health would be for
manufacturers to gradually reduce levels of salt and free
sugars in their foods through reformulation efforts. The UK
was one of the first countries to develop a voluntary salt
reduction strategy in 2003, with a primary focus on refor-
mulation. To date, significant progress has been made by
many food manufacturers and retailers in the UK, with salt
content being reduced across the board, including by up to
25 % in pasta sauces(32) and 20% in bread(33). The average
salt intake in the UK population is decreasing steadily in
parallel, with intake currently estimated at 8·1g/d(23), one of
the lowest known accurate figures of any developed coun-
try(5). This represents a 15% reduction from 2003(34) and was
accompanied by a fall in population blood pressure and
mortality from stroke and IHD(35). Nevertheless, average salt
intake in the UK continues to exceed the maximum
recommended limit of 6 g/d set by the UK Government, with
greater efforts needed across the board. With increasing
evidence now linking increased intake of free sugars to ill
health, a similar strategy must be explored to reduce the
amount of added free sugars in the diet.
Breakfast cereals were included within the approximately
eighty categories of food targeted for reformulation. Break-
fast is widely recommended as part of a healthy diet(36,37),
with breakfast cereals in particular being a popular breakfast
choice especially for children, due to its variety and ease(38).
A study looking at breakfast consumption in a UK popula-
tion sample(39) showed those who ate breakfast cereals were
associated with a significantly better macronutrient and
micronutrient composition, suggesting that cereals should be
encouraged as part of a healthy balanced diet(38). However,
with that said, the majority of breakfast cereals contribute to
salt and sugars intakes in all groups of the population.
Cereals and cereal products are the main contributor
of salt in children’s diets, with breakfast cereals alone
accounting for 4, 3 and 2% of the salt intake in children
(4–10
years),
teenagers
(11–18
years)
and
adults
(18–64 years), respectively(23). Cereals and cereal products
are also the second main contributor of free sugars in chil-
dren’s diets, with breakfast cereals accounting for 8, 7 and 6%
of the free sugars intake in children (4–10 years), teenagers
(11–18 years) and adults (18–64 years), respectively(23). In
2015, retail sales volume reached 520 500 tonnes, of which
104 100 tonnes were children’s breakfast cereals, a significant
proportion of total sales(40).
Despite this, very little has been documented on the salt
or sugars content of breakfast cereals in the UK. Therefore
the present research was conducted to: (i) evaluate the salt
and sugars content listed on the labels of breakfast cereal
products sold in the UK since 2004 (for salt) and 1992 (for
sugars); (ii) compare the salt and sugar content of break-
fast cereals over the years; (iii) report the variability of
both salt and sugars within the different categories of
breakfast cereal; and (iv) assess their levels in relation to
the salt reduction targets and the UK’s new daily recom-
mendation for free sugars intake.
Methods
Data collection
The salt and sugars content of breakfast cereals was assessed
in five separate surveys carried out in 2004 (salt only), 2006,
2009, 2012 and 2015. The survey data were obtained from a
number of different sources: Consensus Action on Salt and
Health (CASH) carried out surveys in 2004(41) and 2015; and
the consumer group Which? carried out surveys in 2006(42),
2009(43) and 2012(44). In all the surveys, data were collected
from product packaging and the nutrition information
panels. The surveys carried out in 2004 and 2015 were
designed as a comprehensive survey of all breakfast cereals
available in a snapshot in time, using one large outlet for
each of the main UK retailers. The 2012 survey carried out by
Which? consisted of top-selling branded breakfast cereals
and their own-brand equivalents, while the 2009 survey by
Which? was based on market share at the time. While not
comprehensive (i.e. did not look at all available breakfast
cereals in all major supermarkets at that moment in time), the
data for 2009 and 2012 are based on popular products sold at
the time, with a mixture of both branded and supermarket
own-brand products, so the data are likely an accurate
reflection of the situation at that point in time. The survey
from 2006 was a more comprehensive survey from Which?
looking at a larger number of popular breakfast cereals
across all major retailers in the UK. The sugars content data
from 1992 were obtained from a booklet published in 1992
by Octavo called A–Z of Shopping; Guide to Good Health.
What’s in your shopping basket?(45). For each breakfast
cereal, the data included the company name, product name,
salt per 100g and sugars per 100g. Data obtained from
CASH surveys were double checked after entry, and a further
5% of entries were checked against the original source in a
random selection of products.
Under EU labelling legislation, nutritional information for
products where a nutrient is negligible is allowed to be
labelled as ‘trace’ or provided with ‘<’. In these circum-
stances, where the salt content of a breakfast cereal was dis-
played as ‘trace’, this was replaced with 0·0. Similarly where
the salt content was <0·01, this was replaced with 0·01, <0·1
was replaced with 0·1, and <0·25 was replaced with 0·25(46).
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Nutritional information of breakfast cereals was collected
from each of the major UK supermarkets operating at
UK salt & sugars content of breakfast cereals
1501
 that time: Aldi (supermarket not operating prior to 2012),
Asda, Iceland (data available only for 2004), Kwik Save
(data available for only 2004), Lidl, Marks and Spencer,
Morrisons,
The
Co-operative,
Tesco,
Safeway
(data
available only for 2004), Sainsbury’s, Somerfield (data
available only for 2004) and Waitrose, to represent the
levels
of
sugars
and
salt
in
breakfast
cereals
in
the UK. Packaged breakfast cereals with labelled salt
and/or sugars information were included. As the study
focus is on product reformulation, plain oats and muesli
with no added salt and/or sugar were excluded. Some
products were also excluded because they did not fit into
the proposed categories. Table 1 shows the details about
the products excluded and the reasons for exclusion.
Product categories
Products were categorised into the categories described in
Table 2. The data were also categorised separately into
supermarket own brand and branded.
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as mean, standard deviation and range, as
indicated. In all tests carried out, significance was deemed at
P<0·05. All data were analysed using the statistical software
package IBM SPSS Statistics Version 22.0.
Comparison among products within each year
The independent-samples t test was used to compare the
levels of salt and sugars between supermarket own-brand
and branded products.
Comparison of the same products over the years
For the purpose of this comparison, only the products with
data available in all five surveys were included in the
analysis. Because the sample size was small, we used a
non-parametric test (i.e. Friedman’s test) to examine
whether there was a significant change in the salt and
the sugars content of breakfast cereals over the years.
Targets
The total number of products and percentage that met
the Department of Health’s 2017 average salt target(47) for
breakfast cereals (≤0·59g/100 g) were calculated. As targets
for sugars have not yet been set, we have compared the
sugars (2015) content with the UK’s new recommendation
for free sugars intake for children aged 4–6 years (19 g/d),
7–10 years (24 g/d) and above 11 years and adults (30 g/d).
Results
Salt
A total of 295 (2004), 246 (2006), ninety-four (2009), forty-
nine (2012) and 270 (2015) products met the inclusion
criteria and were included in the analysis (Table 3). Table 3
shows the levels of salt in breakfast cereals for all five
surveys. Across all years, the salt content varied between
different types of breakfast cereals and within the same type
of cereal. Differences in salt content were observed between
branded cereals and supermarket own brands, but these
differences were not statistically significant for all five years;
2004 (P=0·852), 2006 (P=0·587), 2009 (P=0·113), 2012
(P=0·346), 2015 (P=0·330). Flakes with additions were
among those with the highest salt levels per 100g across four
surveys; in 2004 (1·31 (SD 0·41) g), 2006 (1·36 (SD 0·37) g),
2009 (0·80 (SD 0·47) g) and 2015 (0·81 (SD 0·17) g). Cornflakes
were also among those with the highest salt levels per 100g
across all five surveys; in 2004 (2·28 (SD 0·24) g), 2006 (1·77
(SD 0·31) g), 2009 (1·21 (SD 0·51) g), 2012 (1·03 (SD 0·35) g)
and 2015 (0·80 (SD 0·25) g). In 2015 the average salt level per
100g for all breakfast cereals was 0·46 (SD 0·34) g.
Figure 1 shows the salt content in each category of
breakfast cereal per 100 g in 2015. There was a large
variation in salt content between different categories and
within the same type of category, ranging from 0·00 to
1·25 g/100 g. On average, flakes with additions (0·81 g)
contained the most salt per 100 g, followed by cornflakes
(0·80 g) and wheat, corn, rice and oat flakes, e.g. Special
K style (0·74 g), with the lowest being granola and muesli
(0·05 and 0·11 g/100 g, respectively). Overall, a gradual

 reduction in the salt content of breakfast cereals can be
observed over time, with an average salt content of 0·96 g/
100 g in 2004 down to 0·46 g/100 g in 2015. This represents
an average reduction of 52 %.
Within the data, there were twenty-two products from
seven different companies (four own brand and three
branded) that were surveyed repeatedly over the five
years (Fig. 2). Ten products were supermarket own-brand
breakfast cereals and twelve were branded. The majority
of the products were children’s cereals (n 6) and
cornflakes (n 5). The average salt level for these twenty-
two products was 1·57 (SD 0·59) g/100 g in 2004, 1·38
(SD 0·52) g/100 g in 2006, 1·03 (SD 0·41) g/100 g in 2009,
0·86 (SD 0·28) g/100 g in 2012 and 0·83 (SD 0·27) g/100 g
in 2015. This represents a reduction of 47 % from 2004
to 2015 (P < 0·001 for trend). Note that these averages are
slightly different from those when all products were
included in each year and this trend analysis reflects
reductions made in the same products rather than the
overall products available.
2017 salt target
The Department of Health’s average salt target for
breakfast cereals, as part of its Responsibility Deal’s 2017
Salt Pledge, is <0·59 g/100 g. Our analysis showed 53 %
(143/270) of products surveyed in 2015 met this target.
Sugars
A total of ninety-three (1992), 246 (2006), ninety-four
(2009), forty-nine (2012) and 270 (2015) products met
the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis
(Table 4). Table 4 shows the levels of sugars in breakfast
cereals for all five surveys. The sugars level was slightly
higher in branded compared with supermarket own-brand
products, but this difference was not statistically significant
for all surveys; 1992 (P = 0·062), 2006 (P = 0·374), 2009
(P = 0·113), 2012 (P = 0·697) and 2015 (P = 0·239).
Crunchy nut-style were among those with highest sugars
levels per 100g for all five years in 1992 (32·22 (SD 2·55) g),
2006 (33·77 (SD 0·69) g), 2009 (33·73 (SD 0·67) g), 2012 (32·42
(SD 4·39) g) and 2015 (32·22 (SD 4·95) g), followed by bran
with additions and children’s cereals (Table 4).
Overall, in 2015, the average sugars level per 100g was
20·83 (SD 8·68) g with a range of 0·60–40·00g/100g for all
cereals. Figure 3 shows the sugars content in each category
of breakfast cereal per 100g in 2015. There was a large
variation in sugars content between different categories and
within the same type of category. On average, biscuit
wheats-style and shredded wheat were among those with
the lowest amount of sugars (3·37 (SD 1·86) g/100g).
Figure 4 shows the average levels of sugars in breakfast
cereals for all five years. However, within the data, there were
fifteen products from five different companies (two own
brand and three branded) that were surveyed repeatedly over

 Comparing sugars content (2015) to the maximum
daily recommendation for sugars intake
On average, a typical serving size (30 g) of breakfast cereal
contained 6·25 (SD 2·60) g sugars, almost a quarter of an
adult’s (30 g/d) and a third of a 4–6-year-old’s (19 g/d)
maximum daily recommendation for free sugars intake in
the UK.
Among the sixty-three children’s breakfast cereal products
(sugars content 8·07 (SD 2·50) g/30g), 79% contained
more than a third of a 4–6-year-old’s maximum daily
recommendation for free sugars (19g/d) per 30g serving.
Moreover, 58% of the products contained more than a
third of a 7–10-year-old’s maximum daily recommendation
for free sugars intake (24g/d).
Discussion
Salt; a success story
The UK has long been known as a world leader in salt
reduction, using a well-thought-out and coherent plan
developed by the Food Standards Agency and CASH. The
salt reduction strategy, predominantly based on the setting
of a robust set of targets for over eighty different food
categories(48), was brought about to promote the gradual
reduction in the amount of salt added to processed
foods so as to reduce UK population salt intakes to the
recommended level of 6 g/d(48). This work has now been
incorporated as part of the Government’s Public Health
Responsibility Salt Reduction Pledge, with the latest and
more challenging targets set in 2014 with a deadline
of 2017 to achieve them(5,47,49). As such, significant
reductions in the salt content of foods have been made by
many food manufacturers and retailers in the UK(32,33), with
corresponding decreases in population salt intakes(23). The
present paper adds to previous publications(32,33) suggesting
that a national target-based approach to reformulation can
be a successful method for reducing the salt content in foods
such as bread(33) and pasta sauces(32).
The repeated surveys of the same breakfast cereal
products over time demonstrate that significant reductions
have been made in the salt content of breakfast cereals.
Further analysis of all the cereals surveyed in each survey
shows that cereals contain on average 53 % less salt in 2015
than the cereals surveyed in 2004. The reductions that have
been made since 2004 have gone unnoticed by the general
public, with no impact on sales or consumer behaviour(50).
The supermarkets have historically been known to produce
foods (supermarket own brand) with lower salt levels
compared with their branded competitors(33,51); however,
our survey highlights very little difference for breakfast
cereals in 2015 (0·46 v. 0·49 g/100g, P =0·330).
A large variation can be seen in the salt content of
different breakfast cereals. The salt content of cornflakes,
for example, ranges from 0·40 to 1·25 g/100 g, and in
children’s cereals from 0·01 to 1·20 g/100 g (Table 3).
The fact that cereals have been produced with lower levels
of salt across all of the different cereal categories shows
that such reductions can be achieved. Evidence suggests
that where reductions in salt are made gradually over time,
no reduction in consumer preference is reported(52).
As such, the UK salt reduction programme has been
hailed as one of ‘the most successful nutrition policies in
the UK since the Second World War’ and is estimated to be
saving approximately 9000 lives every year, resulting in
major cost savings to the UK economy of over £1·5 billion
per year(53). Following its success, many other countries
have developed similar programmes based on the UK’s
model, with a reported thirty-eight countries now setting
targets for salt in certain food categories, nine of which
have introduced legislation(54,55).
Can the same be said for sugar?
The repeated surveys of the same breakfast cereals over
time demonstrate that minimal and insignificant reductions
have been made in the sugars content. There continues
to be a significant amount of sugars in breakfast cereals,
particularly children’s breakfast cereals. The average
sugars content in breakfast cereal products is 20·83
(SD 8·68) g/100 g in 2015. There is a large variation in
sugars content between different types and within the
same type of breakfast cereal. Among the sixty-three
children’s breakfast cereal products (8·07 (SD 2·50) g/30 g),
79 % contain more than a third of a 4–6-year-old’s max-
imum daily recommendation for free sugars (19 g/d) per
30 g serving. Moreover, 58 % of the products contain more
than a third of a 7–10-year-old’s maximum daily recom-
mendation for free sugars intake (24 g/d).
Breakfast cereals also contribute to sugars intake in
many other countries(56–59), showing that high levels of
sugars in breakfast cereals, particularly children’s breakfast
cereals, is a global challenge. Many breakfast cereals are
produced by multinational manufacturers, so gradually
reducing the amount of sugars in their products sold
internationally and across the board can have a significant
impact on global health.
There is evidence that free sugars are an important
contributor to obesity, type 2 diabetes and dental caries,
contributing to huge health-care costs(60–62). Since sweetened
breakfast cereals can be highly palatable, it is plausible that
overconsumption of palatable cereals may contribute to
positive energy balance(63). Indeed, Harris et al. reported
greater liking of the high-sugar cereals among children, who
consumed almost twice the amount per eating occasion
compared with those served the low-sugar cereals (61·3 v.
34·6g)(64). However, children offered low-sugar cereals
added more table sugar than those eating high-sugar cereals.
This is likely to be due to children having a stronger
sweet preference than adults and also being habituated to
eating high-sugar cereals(65). Nevertheless, gradual reduction
in the amount of sugars will allow their taste preferences
1508
S Pombo-Rodrigues et al.
 to adjust accordingly. Also, these poor practices can be
discouraged by not giving children the option of adding sugar
to their cereal. Instead, natural sweetness from fruit should be
encouraged. Indeed the children in the low-sugar group
were more likely to put fresh fruit on their breakfast cereal
compared with the high-sugar cereal group (54 v. 8%;
P=0·01). Also, data suggest that exposure to foods during
early development can effect food choices and preferences
that persist throughout life(66). Therefore, reducing the sugars
content of children’s cereals is of utmost importance in order
to instil food preferences that are in line with dietary
recommendations. There is therefore an urgent need to
reduce the amount of free sugars in breakfast cereals, among
other food and drink categories.
Breakfast cereals have the potential to improve health
due to the whole grain and high fibre content that are
associated with weight loss, reduced cardiovascular and
diabetes risk(67,68). So reducing the free sugars content and
increasing the fibre content can have huge health benefits.
Free sugars are claimed to be important in the flavour,
texture, bulk and acceptability of breakfast cereals(69–72).
However, with increasing attention around the sugars
content, some studies have described possible ways of
reducing the free sugars content of breakfast cereals(73–75)
and increasing the fibre content(76), particularly in extruded
products where the majority are now derived from flour
components rather than being whole grain in nature(77–79).
Traditionally the majority of breakfast cereals were derived
from whole-grain sources and were predominantly flaked
from steamed grains (the steam making the grains pliable
to be reformed by the flaking process)(80). However,
with the arrival of more flour separation techniques and
refining processing, cereals have since been derived from
mixtures of flour components rather than being whole
grain in nature(80). This has had an obvious impact on the
composition of the raw material and hence the nutritional
content of the product.
Reducing the free sugars content while increasing the
fibre content allows the food industry to produce products
from relatively inexpensive cereal-based ingredients that
will be accepted by the consumer. There exists a great
potential for the global food industry to manipulate the
nutritional status of these products so as to offer the
consumer potentially nutritious products, which can be
appealing to children since use of extruders in the food
industry allows blending of diverse ingredients into novel
food structures(80).
Reformulation is key
Given the progress made with the salt reduction programme
in the UK, it has been proposed that free sugars can be
reduced through a similar systematic, unobtrusive and
gradual reformulation programme for manufacturers. This
would be achieved by setting progressive targets for each
food and drink category, which would allow for an
incremental reduction of free sugars and provide a level
playing field to industry, which is vital for a voluntary policy.
Importantly, there would be no substitution with artificial
sweeteners, so that the taste receptors would adjust, and, in
solid foods, no addition of other calorific ingredients to
make up for the reduction in free sugars content.
Limitations
The present study was based on salt and sugars content data
provided on breakfast cereal packaging labels in store;
hence we relied on the accuracy of the data provided on the
label. It is assumed that manufacturers provided accurate
and up-to-date information in line with EU regulations. Also
some products contained added dried fruit. However, we
could not identify from the label what percentage of total
sugars came from the dried fruit in these products. Further
studies
should
include

and

content
determined through laboratory analysis to achieve a better
understanding of the true salt, free sugars and breakdown
of free sugars composition.
The different surveys across the different years generally
include
different
products,
meaning
the
like-with-like
comparisons are very limited in size and scope. However,
each of the surveys represented the breakfast cereals
available in major supermarkets at that moment in time,
and contained a variety of different categories, so can be
comparable. Also, we were able to directly compare a
number of the same products over the five different surveys
which, albeit a small sample, provided a similar result to the
overall picture.
When analysing data we did not capture the ingredients
list; this means we are unable to ascertain if salt has
been replaced with any other ingredients/additives in the
breakfast cereals that came out lowest. Such data should
be analysed in future surveys. Also we were unable to
distinguish if sugars labelled on the packaging are all free
sugars or if some are from milk, fruit and vegetables.
The surveys do not take into account sales, and so
conclusions about public health impact are difficult to
draw. However, the current study does look into the
topic of product reformulation and suggests reformulation
of products across a category is doable and has been
successful, at least in terms of salt reduction.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that salt content in breakfast cereals
has decreased by approximately 50% over the past 10 years,
owing to the successful salt reduction programme, particu-
larly the target-based approach to gradually reduce salt added
to food. Despite the significant progress, further reductions
are possible as demonstrated in the large variations in the
present study. The fact that 53% of breakfast cereals already
met the 2017 target by 2015 clearly indicates that lower salt
UK salt & sugars content of breakfast cereals
1509
 targets are urgently needed to ensure continuing reductions
of salt levels in breakfast cereals.
In contrast to salt, sugars content in breakfast cereals
has been steadily high since 1992. This is not surprising as
there has not yet been a national sugar reduction strategy.
In view of the compelling evidence for a population-wide
sugar reduction, it is imperative to adapt the successful salt
reduction programme, in particular setting sugar targets for
different categories of food and drink. This will reduce
sugars intake across the whole population and will help
prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes.
