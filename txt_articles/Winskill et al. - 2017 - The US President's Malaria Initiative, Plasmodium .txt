Abstract
Background
Although significant progress has been made in reducing malaria transmission globally in
recent years, a large number of people remain at risk and hence the gains made are fragile.
Funding lags well behind amounts needed to protect all those at risk and ongoing contribu-
tions from major donors, such as the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), are vital to maintain
progress and pursue further reductions in burden. We use a mathematical modelling
approach to estimate the impact of PMI investments to date in reducing malaria burden and
to explore the potential negative impact on malaria burden should a proposed 44% reduction
in PMI funding occur.
Methods and findings
We combined an established mathematical model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission
dynamics with epidemiological, intervention, and PMI-financing data to estimate the contri-
bution PMI has made to malaria control via funding for long-lasting insecticide treated nets
(LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). We
estimate that PMI has prevented 185 million (95% CrI: 138 million, 230 million) malaria
cases and saved 940,049 (95% CrI: 545,228, 1.4 million) lives since 2005. If funding is main-
tained, PMI-funded interventions are estimated to avert a further 162 million (95% CrI: 116
million, 194 million) cases, saving a further 692,589 (95% CrI: 392,694, 955,653) lives
between 2017 and 2020. With an estimate of US$94 (95% CrI: US$51, US$166) per Disabil-
ity Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted, PMI-funded interventions are highly cost-effective.
We also demonstrate the further impact of this investment by reducing caseloads on health
systems. If a 44% reduction in PMI funding were to occur, we predict that this loss of direct
aid could result in an additional 67 million (95% CrI: 49 million, 82 million) cases and
290,649 (95% CrI: 167,208, 395,263) deaths between 2017 and 2020. We have not mod-
elled indirect impacts of PMI funding (such as health systems strengthening) in this
analysis.

 Conclusions
Our model estimates that PMI has played a significant role in reducing malaria cases and
deaths since its inception. Reductions in funding to PMI could lead to large increases in the
number of malaria cases and deaths, damaging global goals of malaria control and
elimination.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• The United States contributes a significant proportion of the global budget for malaria
control in the form of foreign aid through the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI).
• Due to proposed cuts to US foreign aid and PMI funding, it is important to demonstrate
the impact and cost-effectiveness of PMI.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used an established malaria transmission model to investigate the impact of PMI
funding for malaria control.
• We estimated the past impact of PMI funding on malaria-related cases and deaths and
the potential future impact if PMI funding were to be cut.
• PMI funding is highly cost-effective, averting an estimated 185 million cases and saving
940,049 lives since it was set up in 2005.
• A reduction in funding of 44% would lead to an additional 67 million cases and 290,649
deaths over the next 4 years.
What do these findings mean?
• Ongoing support from PMI is critical to maintain recent advances in malaria control
and progress towards malaria elimination goals.
• PMI has proven to be a highly cost-effective means by which US foreign aid can be
invested to reduce malaria burden.
Introduction
Unprecedented effort has seen the global burden of malaria halve since the turn of the 21st
century due to the widespread distribution of highly effective preventative interventions such
as long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the pro-
vision of highly efficacious treatment with artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) [1].
However, funding for malaria control has plateaued, falling well behind what is necessary to

 expand protection to all those in need [2,3]. The continued high level of support for foreign
aid contributions in a fluid global political landscape is not guaranteed and gains in malaria
control can be fragile if intervention coverage, which is largely dependent on donor funding, is
not maintained [4].
The US is the world’s largest donor of foreign aid for malaria control [5] and therefore a
mainstay in global malaria efforts. The President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), established in
2005 and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has
been particularly influential in investing in malaria control over the past 12 years [6]. PMI pro-
vides support to malaria control programmes in 19 African focus countries and the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) and is the largest bilateral funder of malaria prevention and treat-
ment [5,7]. In the 12 years since its inception, PMI has procured 197 million LLINs and 378
million courses of ACTs, provided over 215 million person-years of protection with IRS, and
distributed 35.7 million courses of preventative therapy for pregnant women [6]. In 2015, PMI
funding represented over one-fifth of the global malaria budget envelope [5,6]. In a recent sta-
tistical analysis, the influence of PMI funding has been estimated to have had significant
impact on under-5 mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated reduction of 16% [8].
The US’s commitment to overseas aid has been threatened in recent months [9], highlighting
the fragility of global funding for malaria control and a reliance on global political stability. In
May 2017, Congress published the Congressional Budget Justification [9], which outlined a
commitment to malaria control for 2018 of US$424 million. This is equivalent to a 44% reduc-
tion relative to commitments reported for 2017 [10].
To quantify the importance of the PMI contribution to global malaria efforts, we combined
data on PMI commodity contributions over time and by country [6] with a mathematical
model of the impact of interventions on malaria transmission, morbidity, and mortality para-
meterised at the subnational level [11] and previously used to inform the Global Technical
Strategy (GTS) for malaria [5]. We used this to estimate the global health impact of past PMI
funding and the potential implications that a reduction in funding from a key stakeholder and
donor in the near term could have on malaria globally.
Methods
We linked data on PMI financing, historical intervention coverage, and the underlying epide-
miology in modelled countries with estimates of the potential effect of reduction in PMI fund-
ing on the coverage of interventions nationally. These estimates were then used as inputs for
an established transmission model of P. falciparum malaria [11,12] to project the impact of
reductions in funding on cases, deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) (Fig 1).
Mathematical model
We used an established individual-based malaria transmission model that incorporates a full
dynamic mosquito-vector element to allow vector-control interventions to be accurately repre-
sented [13]. We briefly describe the model structure below. Full mathematical details can be
found in S1 Appendix, Text A-I, and associated references [11,12].
Modelled humans are initially susceptible and may become infected, with a given probabil-
ity, via the bite of an infectious mosquito. Upon infection, following a period reflecting liver-
stage infection, an individual may become symptomatic and seek treatment. Successfully
treated individuals benefit from a period of drug-dependent prophylaxis before returning to
the susceptible compartment. Symptomatic individuals who do not receive treatment experi-
ence a period of symptomatic disease (which has high onward infectivity) before recovering to
an asymptomatic state. These individuals, along with those who experience asymptomatic

 infection, move from being patently asymptomatic to subpatent before natural clearance
moves them back into the susceptible compartment. Superinfection can occur from all asymp-
tomatic and subpatent states. Those who experience clinical disease are considered at risk
from severe disease and its associated mortality [14].
Naturally acquired immunity is incorporated at several stages of the infection process [12].
Clinical immunity is developed earliest, protecting individuals against severe disease and then
clinical disease, and is exposure driven with an age-dependent component to the severe disease
pathology and associated mortality rate. Antiparasite immunity develops later, driven by both
age and exposure to infection, and reduces the detectability of infections through the control
of parasite density. A degree of anti-infection immunity develops later in life, reducing the
probability that an infectious bite results in patent infection. The parameters determining the
acquisition of immunity were estimated through fitting to severe disease incidence, clinical
incidence, and parasite prevalence data stratified by age across a range of transmission settings
[12,15].
All infection states are assumed to be onwardly infectious to mosquitoes, with infectivity
correlated with parasite density (i.e., highest for clinical disease, intermediate for patent
asymptomatic infection, and lowest for subpatent infection), with the parameters estimated by
fitting to mosquito feeding studies [12,14,15].
Vectors are modelled as a stochastic compartmental formulation incorporating the larval
stages of infection and adult female infection stages [10, 13].
Geographically specific data inputs
We modelled each first administrative unit (first administrative level below national) in all
countries with stable malaria transmission, totalling 1,020 administrative units. Prior scale-up
of interventions (LLINs and IRS) was estimated from World Malaria Report data [16], which
are based on reports from National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs). Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) for within Africa

 [17] and World Malaria Report [18] estimates for elsewhere were used to estimate treatment
coverage. It was assumed there was no prior scale-up of seasonal malaria chemoprevention
(SMC). Each administrative unit was assigned a seasonal pattern that determined the seasonal
fluctuation in the carrying capacity of the environment. Seasonality was estimated using Fou-
rier transformations of daily rainfall data from 2002–2009 from Garske et al. (2013) [19]. The
carrying capacity was then fitted to 2015 estimates of prevalence (within Africa) [1] or cases
(outside of Africa) [16,20] using a root-finding algorithm. Data on populations were compiled
from the Gridded Population of the World dataset, adjusted for United Nations estimates of
country-level populations [21]. Estimates of the spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission
[20] were used to delimit populations at risk.
PMI intervention data
To estimate the impact of PMI funding, we firstly estimate the proportion of intervention cov-
erage that is attributable to PMI funding in each location. This is then subtracted from the
total intervention coverage estimated. The number of LLINs procured and distributed, the
number of people protected by IRS, and the number of ACTs procured and distributed strati-
fied by year and country were all obtained from PMI’s 10th Annual Report to Congress [6].
Absolute numbers were converted to coverage using the appropriate denominators: the esti-
mated population at risk for LLINs and IRS and estimates of the total number of ACT treat-
ment courses delivered [5] for ACT in each country. Examples of this process are detailed in
Box 1 (and S1 Table). Throughout, we assumed that 1 LLIN covered 1.8 people (in line with
WHO methodology [5]). To estimate the relationships between net delivery, coverage, and
usage, we follow an approach by Bhatt et al. (2015) relating distribution data (i.e., procurement
as reported by PMI) to household ownership and usage, accounting for household size [22].

 The coverage estimates in the model relate to usage and also incorporate wear and tear and
decay of insecticide over time. We make an optimistic assumption that ACTs delivered are
efficiently used (i.e., reach the health clinics and are effectively employed to treat malaria). In
Senegal and Mali, where PMI funds support SMC, we assumed that SMC coverage attributable
to PMI was 20%, supporting and complementing SMC implementation by NMCPs and other
nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in these countries [6]. These estimates are then used
to simulate malaria trajectories, both retrospectively and prospectively, assuming varying levels
of PMI funding.
Budget scenarios for 2017 onwards
We considered 3 budget scenarios, one in which PMI funding was kept constant to 2017 levels,
one in which 100% of the PMI budget was removed, and a third in which the budget was
reduced by 44% (applied uniformly across PMI-supported countries) to reflect the difference
in budget attributed to malaria control detailed in the 2017 financial omnibus [10] and the
proposed budget for 2018 onwards [9]. The relationship between PMI’s budget and interven-
tion coverage was assumed to be linear, whereby an assumed budget cut of 44% was associated
with a proportional decrease in the PMI-attributable intervention coverage. We also ran a sce-
nario with a less drastic reduction in funding of 20%. We assume no mitigation through alter-
native funding routes or reallocation of reduced budgets. Extra savings and benefits to the
health system of PMI funding were also estimated. The savings to the health system of cases
averted due to PMI-funded interventions were calculated as the costs of case management and
drug commodity costs of the cases averted. In addition, we calculated the additional deaths
that may occur if PMI-funded interventions were removed and a national health system did
not have the capacity to absorb and adequately treat the additional severe cases.
All scenarios were run multiple times in a sensitivity analysis using 20 separate sets of
parameters drawn from the posterior of the modelling fitting [15]. Associated outputs are pre-
sented as the median and 95% credible intervals.
Results
To date, PMI has allocated over US$5 billion to 19 PMI focus countries in sub-Saharan Africa
as well as the GMS [23] (Fig 2). We attribute increases in coverage of 8.13% for LLINs, 4.18%
for IRS, and 12.9% for ACTs to PMI funding in supported countries in 2015. We estimate that
in the 12 years since its inception, PMI has prevented 185 million malaria cases (95% CrI: 138
million, 230 million) (Fig 3A) and saved 940,049 lives (95% CrI: 545,228, 1.4 million) (Fig 3B),
the majority of which (77%, 95% CrI: 75%, 81%) would have occurred in children under the
age of 5. In sub-Saharan Africa, we estimate that PMI investment has led to an 11.6% (95%
CrI: 9.5%, 13.0%) reduction in incidence and an 18.3% (95% CrI: 16.3%, 20.4%) reduction in
under-5 malaria-mortality rates in 2015. We estimate the biggest impact in terms of absolute
cases averted to have occurred in long-term supported countries with the highest burden. For
example, Nigeria, the country with the highest burden globally [5], has received approximately
US$345 million from PMI since 2010 [6], leading to an estimated 13.8 million cases (95% CrI:
8.7 million, 17.0 million) averted and 128,861 lives (95% CrI: 75,852, 200,075) saved. Angola
has benefitted from continuous support since 2005, seeing investments totalling US$248 mil-
lion dollars [6], leading to an estimated 8.7 million cases (95% CrI: 6.3 million, 10.4 million)
averted and 43,752 lives (95% CrI: 24,946, 61,433) saved.
We estimate that a 44% cut in PMI funding would lead to an additional 67 million cases
(95% CrI: 49 million, 82 million) (Fig 3B) and 290,649 deaths (95% CrI: 167,208, 395,263) (Fig
3C; S1 Appendix, Table F) from malaria compared to maintaining current levels of funding

 from 2017 to 2020. A 20% reduction in funding was associated with an additional 31 million
cases (95% CrI: 21 million, 38 million) and 127,799 deaths (95% CrI: 73,313, 178,234) over the
same period. If PMI-funded coverage of interventions can be maintained over the next 4 years,
PMI support will be responsible for averting an estimated total of 162 million cases (95% CrI:
116 million, 194 million) (Fig 3B) and 692,589 deaths (95% CrI: 392,694, 955,653) (Fig 3C) in
the 4-year period from 2017 to 2020, compared to no PMI support.
The impact on malaria burden will be focussed in high-burden countries receiving signifi-
cant financial support in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, with ongoing concern surrounding
the emergence and spread of ACT drug resistance [24], support for the GMS is also contribut-
ing to the malaria elimination goals in that region.
We estimate that PMI support would avert an additional US$174 million dollars (95% CrI:
121 million, 224 million) of national health system spending through averted malaria cases
from 2017 to 2020 (Fig 4A). In the absence of PMI funding, a failure of health systems to
absorb the extra caseload (through lack of capacity, finances, or both) would lead to an esti-
mated 69,314 extra deaths (95% CrI: 39,102, 94,888) over this period (Fig 4B), in addition to

is US$9.5 million. Estimated funding per population at risk over this period ranged from US$0.54 (Myanmar) to US$8.08 (Liberia). GMS, Greater Mekong

 the 692,589 deaths estimated to be directly caused by reductions in intervention coverage.
These impact estimates are likely conservative, not accounting for the indirect impacts of
increased transmission.
Over the period 2013–2015, when the PMI programme was fully scaled to current levels,
PMI reported that spending in the 19 focus countries in sub-Saharan Africa was approximately
US$1.7 billion. Translating the modelled epidemiological impact into system-wide cost-effec-
tiveness, we estimate a cost of US$20.6 per malaria case averted (95% CrI: US$15.2, US$31.4),
US$4,081 per death averted (95% CrI: US$2,084, US$7,435), and US$94 per DALY averted
(95% CrI: US$51, US$166) (Table 1). This represents a range of 2%–57% as a proportion of
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) in these countries. Cost-effectiveness estimates are
driven by the intervention mix and national-level differences in the cost of treating clinical
and severe cases. Differences between cases and deaths averted are primarily driven by the
intervention mix, especially the proportion of funding that went towards treatment (treatment
contribution is positively associated with the proportion of deaths to cases averted, linear
model coefficient = 0.012, p = 0.035).
Discussion
Here, we have produced modelled estimates of the programme-wide effectiveness of PMI in
terms of the impact it has had upon malaria morbidity and mortality since its inception in
2005. We estimate that PMI has averted 185 million cases and 940,049 deaths to date. If fund-
ing for PMI is maintained, we predict that a further 162 million cases and 692,589 deaths
could be averted over the next 4 years, compared to no PMI funding. However, in comparison
to continued full PMI support, a 44% cut in the PMI budget, as indicated in the May 2017
Congressional Budget Justification, could result in an additional 67 million cases and 290,649
deaths in the next 4 years.
Our results highlight the fragility of the gains in malaria control that have been made to
date, particularly given the changing geopolitical landscape [25]. International funding,
including that from governments, such as from PMI, the United Kingdom’s Department for
International Development (DFID), the Global Fund, and others, accounts for a large propor-
tion (approximately 68% [5]) of the funds available for malaria control worldwide. Malaria
control is therefore reliant on sustained long-term investment from foreign donors. Without
continued commitment to support programmes, recent gains in the control of malaria will be
difficult to sustain and potential rebound epidemics likely [4].
Prudent investment of foreign aid relies on being able to effectively implement cost-effec-
tive interventions to maximise health gains. PMI has proven to be a capable mediator of this
process for malaria. The estimates of cost per DALY averted here are significantly below the
WHO threshold for cost-effectiveness of less than 300% of a country’s per-capita GDP [26].
Even among highly cost-effective interventions, malaria control compares favourably as a
means by which to improve global health [27]. Between-country variation in cost-effectiveness
is pronounced. The effect is driven by the intervention mix and underlying epidemiological
variation (such as the intrinsic transmission potential). Costs are driven by the intervention
mix and, specifically, the impact of PMI support on treatment costs, which varies between
countries. Whilst the past and current positive health impacts of PMI-funded interventions is
very apparent, there remains much debate as to the impact that foreign aid has on recipient
countries [28].
In addition to its direct impact on cases and malaria-attributable mortality, investment in
malaria control brings about substantial further potential health gains by alleviating the burden
that malaria places on health systems in affected countries [29]. Supporting vector control

 interventions is expected to decrease caseloads, freeing up health system capacity and reducing
costs incurred from treating clinical and severe cases of malaria. A recent PMI-supported
study demonstrated reductions in malaria-related inpatient and outpatient admissions and
hospital costs after the scale-up of interventions in Southern Province in Zambia [30]. Funding
cuts lead to increased caseloads due to the negative impacts of reduced intervention coverage,
the stress of which will be borne by the national health systems of malaria-endemic countries.
Lack of health-system capacity was a critical factor in the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa

 [31], the impact of which reverberated globally. Those countries worst affected are highly
malaria endemic and had health systems already dealing with the challenges of a high malaria
burden [32,33]. A redistribution of emergency funds earmarked for the Ebola epidemic [9]
could potentially help to mitigate budget cuts for malaria control. However, this is a finite fund
that would only serve as a very near-term solution to budget reductions.
Our results provide a conservative estimate of the overall impact of PMI funding, as we do
not capture the impact of all PMI-associated activities, notably intermittent preventive treat-
ment in pregnancy (IPTp), which we have not modelled but is one of the most cost-effective
malaria interventions [34,35]. PMI presence in a country further catalyses and facilitates the
procurement, distribution, and implementation of interventions from other funders with the
initiative distributing 80 million LLINs and 34 million ACT courses procured by other donors
in the period 2006–2015 [6]. Furthermore, PMI is involved with a number of capacity and
health system-strengthening initiatives, such as training health workers in malaria diagnosis
and treatment [6], the loss of which would compound issues of increased caseload if PMI sup-
port were reduced. Our estimates of reductions in under-5 mortality attributable to PMI fund-
ing are lower when compared with estimated reductions of a similar magnitude in all-cause
mortality in a recently published difference-in-differences analysis of PMI impact [7]. Whilst
our estimates of intervention coverage attributable to PMI funding are similar, the additional
impact estimated by Jakubowski et al. may be ascribed to indirect impacts of PMI funding on
nonmalaria outcomes (through, for example, health systems strengthening), although consid-
erable uncertainties also impact both analyses. We also do not capture the wider societal costs
of the disease, such as missed workdays by carers, reduced education, or impact on future life-
time earnings, nor the economic effects of endemic malaria on factors such as migration,
trade, tourism, or foreign investment within a country [36]. It is likely that, when facing cuts,
PMI and NMCPs would reallocate existing funds to cover those interventions seen as vital.
However, in an already budget-restricted environment, a limit to the potentially mitigating
effects of such reallocations would quickly be reached. There are a number of difficulties asso-
ciated with estimating accurate coverage estimates and uptake for interventions with a wide
range of definitions and methodologies adopted. We have assumed that PMI-reported contri-
bution and interventions figures, taken from their 10th Annual Report to Congress [6] and
building upon a well-established monitoring and evaluation strategy, are representative and
accurate. We also are including assumptions that the PMI-delivered interventions are reaching
required recipients in an efficient manner. Whilst we know inefficiencies do exist, for example
in LLIN distribution [22], these are difficult to attribute to specific sources. Furthermore, due
to the nonlinear impact of interventions such as LLINs, it is difficult to split contributions
from different funding sources (i.e., should an X% funding contribution be linked to the first
N% or last N% of observed LLIN coverage?). We do account for falloff between coverage and
usage as well as deterioration of insecticide and wear and tear of LLINs in this analysis. Simi-
larities to empirical estimates [8] indicate that we are accurately capturing broad trends in
intervention coverage due to PMI funding.
As malaria transmission is brought to low levels, increased efforts are needed to target
hard-to-reach populations as well as increase surveillance efforts, and hence the programmatic
costs are likely to increase [7]. In such circumstances, investment decisions need to take into
account the potential for permanent gains that would be accrued if an area or country can
achieve elimination. However, there still remain large, extremely cost-effective gains that can
be obtained by investing further to reduce the burden of malaria in areas of high endemicity.
WHO GTS for malaria has set targets of achieving of at least 90% reductions in global case
incidence and mortality rates by 2030 compared to levels in 2015, with vector control, chemo-
prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and surveillance being key pillars of the outlined strategy

 [37]. Based on the estimates of our model, PMI’s ongoing support of these activities in coun-
tries of high burden or strategic importance is vital in order to avoid a rapid erosion of the
progress made in the last 15 years on the road towards malaria eradication.
