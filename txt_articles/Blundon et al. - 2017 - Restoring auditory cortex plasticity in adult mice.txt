Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to acoustic influences during an early
postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of
enriched acoustic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack
this plasticity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile plasticity can be
reestablished in adulthood if acoustic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–
dependent adenosine production or A1–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus.
This plasticity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex
of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination
abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus
rejuvenates plasticity in the auditory cortex and improves auditory perception.
A
coustic experiences change cortical repre-
sentations in the auditory cortex. These
changes are a substrate for auditory cog-
nition (1, 2). During a postnatal critical
period in rodents [postnatal day 11 (P11)
to P15], passive exposure to an acoustic tone
expands the cortical representation of that fre-
quency in the primary auditory cortex (3–7). In
adulthood, passive exposure is insufficient to
induce plasticity. Cortical map plasticity during
the critical period helps construct a stable, adapted
representation of the auditory world. Similar
phenomena in humans are likely necessary for
language acquisition (8, 9). The mechanism by
which cortical plasticity becomes restricted in
adults has been extensively debated (2, 3, 10–17).
Long-term synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term poten-
tiation and long-term depression) at excitatory
thalamocortical projections is restricted to the
same critical period as cortical map plasticity in
auditory cortex (18–20). In adults, both auditory
cortex map plasticity (11, 12, 21) and thalamo-
cortical long-term potentiation and long-term
depression are restored when thalamocortical ac-
tivation is paired with activation of cholinergic
input from the nucleus basalis (18, 19). This
cholinergic modulation of thalamocortical syn-
aptic plasticity is mediated by adenosine, which
inhibits neurotransmitter release via presynaptic
A1 adenosine receptors (A1Rs) (22, 23). Blocking or
deleting A1Rs removes this inhibition of neuro-
transmitter release and thus enables the expression
of thalamocortical long-term potentiation and long-
term depression in the auditory cortex of mice ma-
tured beyond the early critical period in vitro (18, 19).
Thalamic adenosine signaling restricts
auditory cortex map plasticity
We tested whether auditory cortex map plasticity
can be reestablished after the early postnatal critical
periodbyrestrictingA1R-adenosinesignalinginvivo.
We compared auditory cortex map plasticity in
mature (P45 to P56) wild-type (WT) mice and mice
lacking A1Rs (A1R–/–) exposed to pure tones for 5 to
14 days (fig. S1). We mapped auditory cortex by
recording sound-evoked responses of neurons
situated 300 to 400 mm from the pial surface
[corresponding to layer (L) 3/4 thalamorecipient
neurons] in anesthetized mice. The characteristic
frequency (the frequency that evokes the maximal
response at the lowest intensity) of each recording
site was determined from responses to a range of
tone frequencies and intensities. Auditory cortex
maps in mature WT mice were unaffected by tone
exposure; however, the percentage of sites with a
characteristic frequency equal to the exposure
frequency increased in sound-exposed A1R–/– mice
(Fig. 1, A and B). This increase was specific to the
exposure tone frequency: A1R–/– mice exposed to
7.9 or 16.4 kHz showed a 2.6- or 2.9-fold increase
in the percentage of recording sites with char-
acteristic frequencies of 7.9 or 16.4 kHz, respec-
tively, compared to naïve (not exposed to tone)
A1R–/– mice (Fig. 1B). We found no effect of tone
exposure on tonotopic maps in the auditory
thalamus [i.e., the ventral division of the medial
geniculate body of the thalamus (MGv)] of mature
A1R–/– mice (fig. S2).
We tested multiple methods of reducing A1R
signaling and found that each enabled cortical
map plasticity in adult mice when paired with
tone exposure. First, we injected lentiviruses con-
taining small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against
the Adora1 gene, which encodes A1Rs, into MGv
or auditory cortex of P45 to P56 mice. Knocking
down A1Rs in MGv only (figs. S3 and S4) was
sufficient to induce auditory cortex map plas-
ticity in mice exposed to a 9.8-kHz tone (Fig. 1,
C to E). Neither naïve mice injected with these
siRNAs in MGv nor tone-exposed mice injected
with control (scrambled) siRNA showed cortical
map plasticity (Fig. 1, C to E). By contrast, tone
exposure produced no cortical map plasticity
in mice injected with the same Adora1 siRNAs
into auditory cortex (fig. S5), suggesting that
plasticity at thalamocortical synapses, but not
corticocortical synapses, is essential for the au-
ditory cortex map plasticity that we observed.
Auditory cortex map plasticity could also be
induced in aged (7- to 8-month-old) mice after
knocking down A1Rs in MGv (fig. S6).
Second, we conditionally deleted Adora1 in
thalamic excitatory neurons of mature (10- to
13-week-old) mice by injecting an adeno-associated
virus (AAV) encoding Cre-GFP (AAV-CamKIIa-
Cre-GFP) into MGv of newly generated Adora1 fl/fl
mice (GFP, green fluorescent protein) (fig. S7).
After exposure to 9.8 kHz, the number of sites
with a 9.8-kHz characteristic frequency increased
in auditory cortex of Adora1 f l/fl mice injected
with Cre-GFP (Adora1 f l/f l;Cre mice), compared
to Adora1 f l/f l mice injected with GFP alone
(Adora1 f l/f l;GFP mice) (Fig. 1F). Adora1 f l/f l;Cre
mice exposed to the 9.8-kHz tone were better
at distinguishing changes in sound frequencies
around 9.8 kHz than were Adora1 fl/fl;GFP mice
(Fig. 1G). This improvement in auditory perception
was tone specific, as Adora1fl/fl;Cre mice exposed to
another tone did not show improved performance
around 9.8 kHz (fig. S8). Exposure to 9.8 kHz did
not affect frequency-discrimination performance
in WT mice (fig. S9). Neither exposure to 9.8 kHz
nor in vivo injection of Cre-GFP into MGv affected
hearing, as measured by auditory brain stem
responses or startle response (fig. S10).
Third, we crossed Adora1 fl/fl and Gbx2creER mice
to produce a line of mice with an inducible
Adora1 deletion in thalamocortical neurons.
Tamoxifen injection reduced Adora1 mRNA
in Gbx2creER;Adora1 f l/f l mice (fig. S11). In situ
hybridization in WT mice showed that Adora1
is enriched in MGv (fig. S11), suggesting that
thalamocortical neurons are especially sensitive
to adenosine. Tone exposure produced cortical
map plasticity in Gbx2creER;Adora1 fl/fl mice. The

 number of sites with a 9.8-kHz characteristic
frequency was increased in these mice, but not in
control mice (fig. S12).
Fourth, pharmacologic inhibition of A1R signaling
enabled long-lasting auditory cortex map plasticity.
We paired tone exposure with a selective, blood-
brain barrier–permeable A1R antagonist FR194921
{2-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-6-[2-phenylpyrazolo
(1,5-a)pyridin-3-yl]-3(2H)-pyridazinone}, which,
after intraperitoneal injection, persists in the brain
for several hours (fig. S13). Pairing tone exposure
with FR194921 for 5 to 9 days induced auditory
cortex map plasticity when measured the following
day (fig. S14A). Replacing FR194921 with vehicle
or injecting naïve mice with the drug did not induce
auditory cortex map plasticity (fig. S14A). Auditory
cortex map plasticity induced by pairing tone ex-
posure with FR194921 persisted for weeks after
pairing (fig. S14, B and C), as did improved auditory
perception (fig. S14, D to F). Cortical map plasticity
was malleable. Mice exposed to a second week of
FR194921 treatment, paired with a different fre-
quency, exhibited an increased number of auditory
cortex sites responding to the second frequency
and showed no residual increase in cortical sites
responding to the first frequency (fig. S14G).
NT5E and adenosine are increased in
adult mice
We then tested auditory cortex map plasticity
after reducing thalamic adenosine production.
Of the ectonucleotidases that produce adenosine
in the brain (24), only ecto-5′-nucleotidase (Nt5e)
mRNA was increased in mature versus neonatal
thalamus (Fig. 2A). NT5E protein expression was
higher in the thalamus and, to a lesser degree, in
auditory cortex of adults versus neonates (Fig. 2B).
Consistent with this developmental NT5E increase,
total (intracellular and extracellular) adenosine was
higher in the thalamus and auditory cortex of
adults than of neonates (Fig. 2C). In Nt5e–/– mice,
this age-dependent increase of adenosine was ab-
sent in the thalamus but evident in auditory cortex
(Fig. 2C). Auditory cortex map plasticity was
induced in mature Nt5e–/– mice, but not in WT
littermates exposed to a pure tone (Fig. 2, D and
E). Mature tone-exposed Nt5e–/– mice distinguished
frequencies better than naïve Nt5e–/– mice (Fig. 2F),
without any effect on the auditory brain stem
response or startle response (fig. S15). We also
knocked down Nt5e in the MGv by injecting
two different Nt5e siRNAs that reduced thalamic
Nt5e (fig. S16) and produced auditory cortex map
plasticity after tone exposure (Fig. 2, G and H).
Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antag-
onists inhibit synaptic plasticity at mature thal-
amocortical synapses (18, 19). CTEP, an mGluR5
inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier (25),
blocked auditory cortex map plasticity in tone-
exposed Nt5e–/– mice (fig. S17).
A1R agonist inhibits cortical map
plasticity in juvenile mice
In a reverse experiment, we exposed pups to
9.8 kHz during the critical period (P11 to P15), while
treatingthemwiththeblood-brainbarrier–permeable
A1R agonist 2-chloro-N 6-cyclopentyladenosine
(CCPA) or vehicle. We mapped auditory cortex 6 to
10 weeks later (fig. S18A). Tone exposure in these
pups produced auditory cortex map plasticity when
paired with vehicle, but not when paired with
CCPA (fig. S18B).
Auditory plasticity can be reestablished
in individual neurons
To test for auditory cortex map plasticity in
individual neurons, we used two-photon im-
aging of sound-evoked calcium transients in

Downloaded from 
 thalamorecipient neurons of auditory cortex
in mature awake mice before and after tone ex-
posure. We infected L3/4 excitatory neurons in
auditory cortex (fig. S19) with a recombinant AAV
expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator
GCaMP6f (26) under control of the excitatory
neuron–specific promoter CamKIIa (AAV-CamKIIa-
GCaMP6f) (Fig. 3A). We determined each neuron’s
best frequency (i.e., the frequency that evokes
the greatest response across all intensities) from
calcium transients (fig. S20) evoked by a range
of tone frequencies and intensities (Fig. 3, B and
C). We measured tuning changes by repeatedly
imaging the same auditory cortex neurons be-
fore and after as many as 5 days of exposure to
9.8 kHz (Fig. 3D and figs. S21 to S23).
All tested approaches that reduced adenosine
signaling or production in MGv enabled plastic-
ity in individual neurons when paired with tone
exposure. A1R knockdown in MGv with Adora1
siRNA paired with 9.8-kHz exposure shifted best
frequencies of individual L3/4 neurons toward
9.8 kHz but not in naïve mice with A1R knockdown
or when control siRNA was paired with 9.8-kHz
exposure (Fig. 3, D to J). Nt5e siRNA injected
into MGv also shifted best frequencies of indi-
vidual neurons toward 9.8 kHz in mice exposed
to this frequency but not in naïve mice (Fig. 3, K
to N). Pairing tone exposure with pharmacologic
blockade of A1Rs also caused L3/4 neurons to
shift best frequencies toward the exposure fre-
quency. We measured receptive fields in the same
population of neurons at days 0, 1, 3, and 5 during
the 9.8-kHz tone exposure combined with FR194921
administration. L3/4 neurons in auditory cortex
shifted their best frequencies toward 9.8 kHz
starting at day 1 and maintained this shift dur-
ing all the days of tone exposure (fig. S24, A to
F). By contrast, pairing 9.8-kHz exposure with
vehicle did not shift best frequencies of L3/4
neurons toward 9.8 kHz on any tested day (fig.
S24, G to L).
Similar experiments in Adora1 f l/f l;Cre mice
(lacking A1Rs in MGv neurons) showed that
L3/4 neurons in auditory cortex also shifted best
frequencies toward the exposure frequency. Cor-
tical neurons of Adora1 fl/fl mice, which received
MGv injections of Cre-tdTomato (AAV-CamKIIa-
Cre-tdTomato) (fig. S25) and were exposed to
9.8 kHz, shifted best frequencies toward 9.8 kHz
at day 1 and maintained this shift at days 3 and 5
of tone exposure (fig. S24, M to R). By contrast,
this best frequency shift was not seen in L3/4
neurons of WT littermates injected with Cre-
tdTomato into MGv and exposed to 9.8 kHz for
the same periods of time (fig. S24, S to X). A
switch in best frequency after tone exposure did
not depend on a neuron’s receptive field proper-
ties or GCaMP6f-response amplitudes (fig. S26).
These findings suggest that an NT5E-mediated,
age-dependent increase in adenosine production
in the auditory thalamus terminates the juvenile
critical period of auditory cortex map plasticity
via A1R activation. A1R activation inhibits virtually
every neurotransmitter in the brain, and its strongest
inhibitory action is on excitatory glutamatergic
synapses (22). A1R activation reduces presynaptic
Ca2+ influx and hyperpolarizes presynaptic mem-
brane potential by activating inwardly rectify-
ing K+ channels (22). During the critical period,
when adenosine levels are low, sustained activity
in auditory thalamocortical synapses triggers
enough glutamate release to activate mGluRs and
produce long-term potentiation or long-term de-
pression. In adults, higher NT5E expression leads
to increased production of adenosine, which limits
sustained glutamate release via A1R activation,
blocking thalamocortical synaptic plasticity and
thereby preventing cortical map plasticity. Re-
stricting thalamic adenosine signaling is suffi-
cient to restore higher levels of glutamate release
and synaptic plasticity at thalamocortical synap-
ses in brain slices from adult mice (18, 19, 27)
and reestablish cortical map plasticity in adult
mice in vivo.
Experimental manipulations in adult mice
that were expected to enable thalamocortical
synaptic plasticity (i.e., knockdown or deletion
of A1Rs or knockdown of NT5E in thalamic
neurons) also facilitated auditory cortex map
plasticity. Manipulations expected to inhibit
thalamocortical synaptic plasticity (i.e., mGluR5
antagonist treatment in Nt5e–/– adult mice and

 A1R agonist treatment during the postnatal critical
period) blocked cortical map plasticity. Knockdown
of A1Rs in cortical neurons failed to potentiate
cortical map plasticity in adult mice. These re-
sults point to thalamocortical long-term plas-
ticity as the necessary step that leads to cortical
map plasticity and enhanced auditory percep-
tion. However, our results do not exclude the
possibility that the improvement in auditory
perception may result from additional changes
at other synapses in the auditory cortex as a
downstream consequence triggered by thalamo-
cortical synaptic plasticity.
Implications for the human context
Pairing tone exposure with administration of the
specific A1R antagonist FR194921 resulted in
cortical map plasticity and improved auditory
perception in adult mice. These results imply
that other A1R inhibitors, such as caffeine, could
be used to improve auditory perception in adult
humans. However, because caffeine, especially
at high concentrations, inhibits other adenosine
receptors and affects intracellular cyclic adeno-
sine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium
levels (28), its effectiveness at improving auditory
perception could be limited, compared to that of
FR194921 or other specific A1R inhibitors.

best frequencies of recorded neurons in
auditory cortex before (black solid lines) and
after 9.8-kHz exposure (green lines) under
the same three experimental conditions as in
(D) (three mice per condition) [(E): 19 neurons,
P > 0.05; (F): 34 neurons, *P < 0.05; (G):
25 neurons, P > 0.05]. (H to J) Heat maps (DBF
maps) depicting shifts in neuron numbers
(normalized to percent sampled) as a function
of best frequencies between days 0 and
5, under three experimental conditions as in
(D), from data in (E) to (G) [(H): P > 0.05;
(I): *P < 0.001; (J): P > 0.05). Diagonal lines
represent no change in best frequencies.
Vertical lines represent 9.8 kHz. (K to N) As
described above for (E) to (J), under two
experimental conditions (three mice per
condition): Nt5e siRNA1 (1264) in MGv with
no tone exposure [(K) and (M): 24 neurons,

Downloaded from 
 in patients with neurological diseases, such as
tinnitus and stroke (29–32). One current method
for inducing therapeutic targeted cortical map
plasticity in patients is the pairing of sensory
stimulation (i.e., a sound) or motor training with
repeated electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve
by using surgically implanted electrodes. Our work
offers an alternative, noninvasive method for
inducing lasting cortical map plasticity, namely,
by pairing a sound with administration of a spe-
cific A1R inhibitor that has a short half-life.
Adult cortical plasticity is associated with im-
provedtone-frequency discrimination. In humans,
tone discrimination is required for acquiring lan-
guage and musical skills. Tonal representation in
auditory cortex is larger in musicians than in
nonmusicians (33). This difference is observed pri-
marily in musicians who began practicing their
instruments before 9 years of age (34); it is also
associated with improved linguistic skills (35, 36).
Here we show that disruption of thalamic ade-
nosine signaling in the adult mouse that restores
auditory cortex map plasticity also improves au-
ditory perception. A similar mechanism may
improve the ability of adult humans to learn
linguistic, musical, and other auditory skills.
