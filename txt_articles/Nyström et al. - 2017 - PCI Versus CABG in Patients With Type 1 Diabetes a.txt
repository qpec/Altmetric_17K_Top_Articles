ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND It is unknown if coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
may offer a survival benefit in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in need of multivessel revascularization.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine if patients with T1D and multivessel disease may benefit from CABG
compared with PCI.
METHODS In an observational cohort study, the authors included all patients with T1D who underwent a first multi-
vessel revascularization in Sweden from 1995 to 2013. The authors used the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for
Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Thera-
pies) register, the Swedish National Diabetes Register, and the Swedish National Patient Register to retrieve information
about patient characteristics and outcomes. They estimated hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revasculari-
zation, stroke, and heart failure using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores.
RESULTS In total, 683 patients who underwent CABG and 1,863 patients who underwent PCI were included. During a mean
follow-up of 10.6 years, 53% of patients in the CABG group and 45% in the PCI group died. PCI, compared with CABG, was
associated with a similar risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.32), but higher risks of death from coronary
heart disease (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.74), myocardial infarction (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.78), and repeat revascu-
larization (HR: 5.64; 95% CI: 4.67 to 6.82). No differences in risks of stroke or heart failure were found.
CONCLUSIONS Notwithstanding the inclusion of patients with T1D who might not have been able to undergo CABG
in the PCI group we found that PCI, compared with CABG, was associated with higher rates and risks of coronary
heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularizations. Our findings indicate that CABG may be
the preferred strategy in patients with T1D in need of multivessel revascularization. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:1441–51)

A
mong
patients
who
undergo
multivessel
revascularization
with
coronary
artery
bypass grafting (CABG), or percutaneous cor-
onary intervention (PCI), 25% have diabetes. A mor-
tality
benefit
favoring
CABG
over
PCI
has
been
proven
for
patients
with
diabetes.
In
the
BARI
(Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation)
study, patients with diabetes who underwent PCI
had almost double the 5-year mortality of those
who
underwent
CABG
(1).
Later,
the
FREEDOM
(Future
REvascularization
Evaluation
in
patients
with Diabetes Mellitus) study, where 1,900 patients
with diabetes and multivessel disease were random-
ized to undergo either PCI or CABG, demonstrated a
reduction in the composite outcome of death from
any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal
stroke in favor of CABG over PCI (2). Similarly, in a
subgroup analysis of 452 patients with diabetes who
were randomized to either PCI or CABG in the SYN-
TAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Inter-
vention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) trial, a
survival benefit was found for patients treated with
CABG (3). For this reason, current guidelines support
CABG over PCI as the preferred treatment of multi-
vessel disease in patients with diabetes (4,5).
None of the abovementioned studies reported the
proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
included. However, type of diabetes may also be of
great importance because the long-term prognosis
after CABG is dire in patients with T1D (6), compared
with patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) whose long-
term prognosis is similar to that of patients without

 diabetes (3,6). The reason for the poor prognosis in
patients with T1D after CABG is not fully understood;
however, factors such as diabetes duration and glyce-
mic control may be of great importance (7). Therefore,
the recommendation that all diabetes patients in need
of multivessel revascularization should undergo CABG
cannot easily be translated to patients with T1D.
Thus, it is unknown whether patients with T1D
have the same benefit as patients with T2D from
CABG compared with PCI. Therefore, we performed a
nationwide, population-based cohort study in all
patients with T1D who underwent a first multivessel
revascularization with either CABG or PCI over a
period of 19 years in Sweden.
METHODS
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY POPULATION. The study
database was created by using the unique personal
identity number assigned to every Swedish resident
as the identifier to crosslink a number of Swedish
national health care registries. The records linkage
procedure was performed at the Swedish National
Board of Health and Welfare, which anonymized the
database before it was returned to the research group.
All patients with T1D who underwent a first iso-
lated multivessel (defined as involving at least 2
significantly
stenosed
coronary
arteries)
cardiac
revascularization with PCI or isolated CABG from 1995
to 2013 in Sweden were included. Exclusion criteria
were prior cardiothoracic surgery; prior or current left
main coronary artery revascularization; emergency
procedure; valvular heart surgery or vascular surgery
concurrently
with
CABG,
or
PCI
for
ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction; prior single-vessel
PCI in the PCI group; and T1D diagnosed after the
index date. The study population was identified and
baseline characteristics obtained from the SWEDE-
HEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and
Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease
Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies)
register (8) and the NDR (Swedish National Diabetes
Register) register (9), and further expanded with in-
formation about comorbidities and outcomes from
the National Patient Register (10), date and cause of
death from the Cause-of-Death register, and socio-
economic data from Statistics Sweden. Data sources
are described in detail in the Online Appendix. How
data from different sources was retrieved is described
in Online Figure 1.
DEFINITION OF T1D. Data from all patients with T1D,
according to either an epidemiological or clinical
definition, were obtained from the NDR reg-
ister (Online Appendix). The epidemiological
definition of T1D was onset of diabetes before
the age of 30 years and treatment with insulin
only (9). The clinical definition of T1D in the
NDR register was decided at an outpatient
visit, normally to an endocrinologist, and
registered in the NDR register. The coverage
of T1D patients in the NDR register is virtually
complete for the whole country of Sweden (9).
FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOMES. The primary
outcome
was
all-cause
mortality,
and
secondary
outcomes were death from coronary heart disease,
myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascular-
ization. Follow-up started when the first multivessel
PCI or CABG was performed for all-cause mortality,
and stroke. For repeat revascularization follow-up
started at 8 days after revascularization, and for
myocardial infarction, and heart failure 31 days after
revascularization. Follow-up ended for all outcomes
when the patient died, was hospitalized for each
outcome, or on December 31, 2014. Data on rehospi-
talizations for myocardial infarction, heart failure,
stroke, or repeat revascularization was obtained from
the National Patient Register or the SWEDEHEART
register. International Classification of Diseases codes
for the outcome measures and comorbidities are
shown in Online Table 1.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Missing baseline values were
imputed using multiple chained equations imputa-
tion, as implemented in the MICE package in R, version
3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria), creating 10 imputed datasets. The percentage
of missing values ranged from 61.1% for low-density
lipoprotein to 0% for age, sex, and comorbidities
(Online Table 2). The imputation worked well accord-
ing to the convergence and distribution of the imputed
variables. Observed and imputed values of missing
data are shown in Online Figure 2.
Descriptive statistics are presented in terms of
averages and percentages, together with the stan-
dardized difference before weighting. Comparisons
between CABG and PCI with respect to health out-
comes were made using weighted Cox regressions
where the weights were derived as the average weights
from
propensity
scores
estimated
using
gradient
boosting. The balance before and after weighting for
patient characteristics is shown in Online Figure 3. The
assumption of proportional hazards was evaluated by
plotting the log(log[S(t)]), where S(t) is the estimated
survival function. Although the assumption of pro-
portional hazards was not exactly met, as it rarely is in
practice, the hazard ratio (HR) was judged a reasonably

models contained age, prior coronary heart disease,
and index year.
Statistical hypothesis tests were evaluated using
the 5% significance level without any adjustment for
multiple comparisons. The analysis was implemented
using R and SAS statistical analysis software, version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
STUDY GROUP. During the study period, 2,546 pa-
tients with T1D underwent a first multivessel revas-
cularization,
of
which
73%
underwent
PCI.
The
selection of the study group is described in Figure 1.
Patients treated with PCI were older, more often
women, had a longer duration of diabetes, and were
more likely to have had previous myocardial in-
farctions and strokes (Table 1). Three-vessel disease
was more common in the CABG group compared
with the PCI group (84% vs. 58%). From 1995 to
1999,
the
predominant
strategy
for
multivessel
revascularization was CABG (62% vs. 38%). There-
after, there was a steady decline in the proportion of
CABG compared with PCI, with 2% CABG versus 98%
PCI from 2010 to 2013 (Table 1, Online Table 3).
MORTALITY. During a mean 10.6 � 5.1 years (22,386
person-years) of follow-up, 44.6% patients in the PCI
group and 53.3% in the CABG group died (Table 2).
The absolute risk of death was higher at 1 year
(5.0% vs. 0.7%), 2 years (8.3% vs. 1.2%), and 5 years
(18.6% vs. 6.4%) after revascularization in patients
who underwent PCI compared with CABG (Table 3,
Central Illustration). The rate of death per 100 person-
years was higher in the PCI group than in the CABG
group (6.0/100 person-years vs. 4.3/100 person-years).

 The risk of death after adjustment for differences
between groups was similar in the PCI group compared
to the CABG group (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.32).
Cause-specific mortality showed that patients who
underwent PCI were more likely to die from coronary
heart disease than were patients who underwent CABG
(HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.74) (Table 2, Figure 2A).
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, HEART FAILURE, STROKE,
AND
REPEAT
REVASCULARIZATION. The
absolute
risks at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after revasculari-
zation for myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke,
and repeat revascularizations were consistently higher
in patients who underwent PCI compared with those
who underwent CABG, with the largest difference
found for repeat revascularizations (Table 3, Figures 2B
to 2E). The rate and adjusted risk of myocardial
infarction in the PCI group was higher than in the CABG
group (4.6/100 person-years vs. 2.7/100 person-years;
adjusted HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.77) (Table 2). Simi-
larly, the adjusted risk for and the frequency of repeat
revascularization was higher in the PCI group than in
the CABG group (20.1/100 person-years vs. 1.9/100
person-years; adjusted HR: 5.64; 95% CI: 4.67 to 6.82).
Repeat revascularization was performed using CABG
in 64% of the cases in the PCI group, compared with 1%

 in the CABG group. The 30-day rate of stroke was
higher in the CABG group than in the PCI group (1.9%
vs. 0.8%), but there was no difference in the long-term
adjusted risk of stroke between the PCI and CABG
groups. The adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart
failure was similar in the PCI and CABG groups.
DISCUSSION
In this nationwide cohort study including all patients
with T1D who underwent a first multivessel revascu-
larization in Sweden from 1995 to 2013, we found a
benefit favoring CABG over PCI, with lower rates and
risks of coronary heart disease mortality, myocardial
infarction, and repeat revascularization, with no such
differences found for all-cause mortality, stroke, and
heart failure.
Earlier studies have provided evidence of a benefit
for CABG compared with PCI in terms of prognosis in
patients with diabetes in need of multivessel revas-
cularization (1–3,11). The strongest evidence for using
CABG over PCI as the preferred strategy for multi-
vessel revascularization in patients with diabetes
comes from the FREEDOM study (2); however, none
of the previously mentioned studies reported the
proportion
of
included
T1D
compared
with
T2D
patients. Because 85% to 90% of all patients with
diabetes have T2D (12), it is likely that the proportion
of T1D patients included was very small. To the best
of
our
knowledge,
only
1
previous
study
that
compared PCI with CABG for multivessel revascular-
ization in patients with diabetes sorted patients into
T1D and T2D subgroups (13). This study was prema-
turely stopped due to slow enrollment, comprising a
total of 510 diabetes patients, of whom only 5% had
T1D.
Due
to
the
small
number
of
T1D
patients
involved, no interpretation could be drawn from this
group. As patients with T1D have a significantly
increased
long-term
risk
of
death
after
CABG
compared with patients with T2D (6), and patients
without
diabetes
and
with

 knowledge gap regarding strategies for multivessel
revascularization in patients with T1D.
In the present study, we found increased coronary
heart disease mortality in the PCI group. This finding
was first reported in the BARI study, which enrolled
patients between 1988 and 1991 (1). Similarly, pa-
tients treated with PCI in the FREEDOM study (2),
which was conducted more than 10 years after the
BARI study (1), had increased all-cause mortality.
Similar to the findings in our study, in the subgroup
analyses of patients with diabetes in the SYNTAX
study,
there
was
a
trend
towards
an
increased
all-cause
mortality,
and
a
significantly
increased
cardiac-specific mortality in patients who underwent
PCI compared to those who underwent CABG (2). We
found the largest differences in risk between CABG-
and PCI-treated patients for myocardial infarction
and repeat revascularization. In the FREEDOM study,
a similar association was found, with more than
double the rate of myocardial infarction in the PCI
group 5 years after randomization (2).
The FREEDOM study, which included patients
between 2005 and 2010, reported 5-year event rates
similar
to those
in
our
study
for
all
outcomes,
except for a higher rate of death. This may partly be
related to an older study population included in
the FREEDOM study (2). In the current study, the
30-day risk of stroke was higher in the CABG group,
with event rates similar to those in the FREEDOM
study, but the absolute risk was small, and the
difference between patients treated with PCI and
those treated with CABG had disappeared after 2
years of follow-up. Furthermore, in the BARI 2D
study, patients with T2D were randomized to med-
ical treatment or revascularization in 2 groups: one
where patients were treated with PCI, and the other
where they were treated with CABG (14). Revascu-
larization was not associated with reduced mortality

 in either group, but patients who underwent CABG
had a significantly reduced risk of major cardio-
vascular events compared with patients who were
treated only with medical therapy during follow-up.
There was no difference in major cardiovascular
events in patients treated with PCI compared with
those treated medically.
Patients with diabetes have an accelerated athe-
rothrombosis (15) with an early onset of atheroscle-
rosis, suggested to be more diffuse, more extensively
involved, and with more distal coronary lesions
compared
with
patients
without
diabetes
(16).
Therefore, the target vessel for a bypass graft in pa-
tients with diabetes is often in an inferior condition
compared
with
the
target
vessel
from
patients
without diabetes. Despite this, cardiovascular com-
plications differ between T1D and T2D, not only in
that T1D presents at younger age, but also in that
women are affected to the same degree and at the
same age as men (7). Also, poor glycemic control
before CABG is associated with increased risk of death
in patients with T1D (17), an association that is not as
pronounced
in
patients
with
T2D
(18).
Previous
studies have demonstrated that both glycemic control
and insulin treatment are predictors of long-term
outcomes
after
CABG
(19–21).
Recently,
it
was
demonstrated, in a substudy of the FREEDOM study,
that the clinical event rate was higher in patients with
diabetes treated with insulin compared to those
without insulin treatment; however, no interaction
was demonstrated between groups, suggesting that
insulin treatment in itself is not a risk factor for the
prognosis in patients with diabetes undergoing PCI or
CABG (22). In the current study, patients who un-
derwent PCI were older, were more often female, had
a longer duration of diabetes, lower GFR, and were
more likely to have heart failure, active cancer, end-
stage renal disease, and prior stroke compared with
patients who underwent CABG. After adjustment for
these and a number of other differences, there was
still an excess risk and rate of coronary heart disease
mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revas-
cularization in patients with T1D who underwent PCI
compared with those who underwent CABG.
Based on data from the BARI study, the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute released a clinical
alert in 1995 recommending CABG as the preferred
method for multivessel revascularization in patients
with diabetes. However, this alert had no measurable
effect on the choice of revascularization method
for patients with diabetes in the United States (23).
Thereafter, results from both the FREEDOM and
SYNTAX studies confirmed the early findings from the
BARI study, leading to strong recommendations,
in both Europe and the United States, to use CABG over
PCI for multivessel revascularization in patients with
diabetes (4,5). In the present study, more patients with
T1D underwent CABG than PCI each year from 1995 to
1999. Thereafter, there was a steady decline in number
of CABGs performed. From 2008 to 2013, the preferred
strategy for multivessel revascularization was CABG in
only 24 patients compared with PCI in 655 patients.
The reason why guideline recommendations were not
followed, and PCI was chosen over CABG to such a large
extent in our observational study, remains elusive.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The main limitation was the
large differences in risks of outcomes during the first
year of follow-up. This indicates that there was sig-
nificant confounding by indication present, meaning
that some patients who underwent PCI did so because
they were too sick to undergo CABG. Indeed, there
were major differences in patient characteristics be-
tween the 2 groups, with more patients with prior
stroke, heart failure, active cancer, and end-stage
renal disease, all strong predictors of early and late
outcomes after cardiac revascularization, in the PCI
group. Moreover, there was also most likely unmea-
sured confounders present that we had no informa-
tion about, such as frailty, which might have been a
reason to choose PCI over CABG. In addition, the vast
majority of patients who underwent CABG had their
procedures performed within the first few years of the
study period. This may explain some of the differ-
ences in patient characteristics, between groups.
However, by using inverse probability of treatment
weighting based on propensity scores, we adjusted
for these differences, but cannot exclude that there
was
residual
confounding
present,
even
after
adjustment. We had no information about cardio-
vascular medications aimed at secondary prevention.
This most likely diluted the finding of an increased
risk associated with PCI treatment compared with
CABG
treatment
because
secondary
prevention
became more aggressive during the study period,
specifically in diabetes patients. Moreover, we had no
information on the types of stents used, which varied
between bare-metal stents and different types of
drug-eluting stents due to the long study period.
However,
in
previous
studies,
the
benefit
of
CABG over PCI in patients with diabetes has been
independent of whether bare-metal stents (1), or
drug-eluting stents (2,3) have been used. Another
limitation was that we were not able to adjust for
changes
in
the
epidemiology
of
coronary
heart
disease,
with
a
significantly
reduced
incidence
of
myocardial
infarction
and
reduced
long-term
mortality following myocardial infarction during the

 study period (24). As CABG was the preferred method
for multivessel revascularization during the early
years of the study period, with higher risks associated
with coronary heart disease, we believe that this may
have, if anything, diluted our findings. The largest
differences in risk were found for repeat revascular-
ization, and myocardial infarction, which is related to
the completeness of revascularization among PCI
patients
(25).
These
differences
may
have
been
attenuated if we would have been able to adjust for
complete or incomplete revascularization in the PCI
group (25). As our study was an observational cohort
study, the results may not be completely comparable
to the findings in the BARI, FREEDOM, or SYNTAX
studies, where patients with diabetes were random-
ized to treatment with either PCI or CABG (1–3).
The main strength of our study was the size of this
unique study population of T1D patients and the
large number of events, with 1,195 deaths, and 726
myocardial infarctions during a mean follow-up of
more than 10 years. This allowed us to report risks
for each outcome separately, and with high precision
in
our
estimates.
We
used high-quality
national
health care registers to obtain information, all of
which
were
previously
evaluated
and
found
to
have
high
validity
(8–10).
The
Patient
and
the
Cause-of-Death register used to retrieve outcomes
has complete coverage of the country, and therefore
we had no loss to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS
Notwithstanding
the
inclusion
of
patients
who
might not have been able to undergo CABG in the
PCI group, in this nationwide cohort of T1D patients
with multivessel coronary artery disease, we found
that CABG was associated with a lower risk of cor-
onary heart disease mortality, myocardial infarction,
and repeat revascularization compared with PCI.
Even if our findings indicate that CABG should be
the preferred strategy for multivessel revasculari-
zation in patients with T1D, our findings should
be interpreted with some caution because of the
observational
nature
of
the
study,
and
maybe
more importantly, the large differences in risks in
the first year of follow-up, indicating that there
were large inherent differences in risk at baseline
between the PCI and CABG groups.
