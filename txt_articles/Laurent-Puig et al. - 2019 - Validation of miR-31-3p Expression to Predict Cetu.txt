Abstract
Purpose: MiR-31-3p expression has been shown to be
associated with response to anti-EGFR therapy. We investi-
gated the predictive role of this biomarker in the FIRE-3
study population, including its ability to differentiate out-
comes between patients receiving anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF
therapy.
Experimental Design: MiR-31-3p expression was measured
in primary tumors obtained from 340 patients with RAS WT
mCRC enrolled in the FIRE-3 Trial. This included 164 patients
randomized to receive FOLFIRI plus cetuximab (FOLFIR-
IþCetux) and 176 to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (FOLFIR-
IþBeva). Patients were divided into subgroups defined by low
or high miR-31-3p expression using a prespecified cut-off and
by treatment arm. Analyses were performed to assess treatment
efficacy by subgroup. Overall survival (OS) and progression-
free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves
and Cox regression models. Investigator-assessed objective
response (iOR), early tumor shrinkage at 6 weeks (ETS), and
centrally reviewed objective response (cOR) were analyzed
using logistic regression models. The predictive value of
miR-31-3p expression level was assessed through a treatment
interaction test using multivariate models adjusted for poten-
tial confounding factors.
Results: Low miR-31-3p expressers benefited from cetux-
imab compared with bevacizumab for PFS [HR, 0.74; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 0.55–1.00; P ¼ 0.05], OS (HR, 0.61;
95% CI, 0.41–0.88; P < 0.01), iOR (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.9–8.2;
P < 0.01), ETS (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.1–7.7; P < 0.01 and cOR
(OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.3–10.5; P < 0.01) in multivariate analyses.
There was no difference in outcomes for high expressers
between treatment arms. MiR-31-3p expression level was
predictive of treatment effect for PFS (P ¼ 0.03), OS (P ¼
0.05), iOR (P ¼ 0.02), ETS (P ¼ 0.04), and cOR (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: MiR-31-3p expression level was validated as
a predictive biomarker of cetuximab therapy efficacy for pati-
ents with RAS WT mCRC.
Introduction
The use of the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitu-
mumab in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
is restricted to patients with extended RAS wild-type (WT) tumors
because no clinical benefit is derived from either therapy in
patients with RAS mutant tumors (1). Unfortunately, patients
with RAS WT treated with anti-EGFR therapy only experience an
up to 70% objective response rate, correlating to approximately
30% of patients not responding to treatment (2, 3). Because the
side-effect profile for anti-EGFR therapy, especially skin toxicity,
is significant, further personalization of treatment is needed to
maximize benefit-to-risk ratio for these drugs.
MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that are key
regulators of gene expression and have been shown to play a
critical role in many cancers (4). MicroRNA expression levels
can serve as biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic or predictive
purposes in CRC (5, 6). Mir-31 is frequently upregulated in
CRC tumors compared with normal corresponding tissue (7).
Upregulation of the mature forms of mir-31, miR-31-3p, and
miR-31-5p is associated with advanced disease and poor
response to anti-EGFR therapy based on several small retro-
spective studies (8–12).
The current study was planned using the REporting recommen-
dations for tumor MARKer prognostic studies (REMARK; ref. 13)
with the aim to validate the predictive role of miR-31-3p expres-
sion level for the efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in
first-line treatment of mCRC.

 Materials and Methods
Study design and participants
The FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306; NCT00433927) prospective, ran-
domized trial investigated the efficacy of first-line treatment with
FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in 592 patients
with KRAS Exon-2 WT mCRC (14). Although progression-free
survival (PFS) was comparable between treatment arms, a statis-
tically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) was
demonstrated for the cetuximab arm compared with the bevaci-
zumab arm. Extended RAS analysis performed retrospectively on
patients treated in the FIRE-3 study revealed 400 subjects
bearing a RAS WT tumor (2). Tumor material was available for
343 subjects with miR-31-3p expression measurable for 340
patients (miR-population or "miR-pop"; Fig. 1). The retrospective
analysis
of
tumor
material
was
approved
by
the
ethics
committee of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (IRB
No. 186-15).
MiR-31-3p expression analyses
A pathologist (D. Neureiter) reviewed all samples and the
area of tumor was marked for subsequent macrodissection. For
each sample, 5 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides
of 5-mm thickness were scratched in the tumor area and total RNAs
were extracted using the FFPE miRNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific quantifica-
tion of microRNA miR-31-3p expression was performed on retro-
transcribed RNA using specific TaqMan predesigned assays on
ABI7900HT Real-Time PCR System as described by Ramon
and colleagues (15). A previously reported cutoff value (1.36)
for miR-31-3p expression level was used to define patients as
being either low or high expressers (15).
Statistical methodology
The primary objective of the predefined statistical analysis plan
was to demonstrate the superiority of FOLFIRIþCetux versus
FOLFIRIþBeva regarding OS and PFS in the low-expressers sub-
group, defined as patients with miR-31-3p expression level below
the prespecified cutoff value. If the primary objective was
achieved, miR-31-3p expression predictivity of treatment efficacy
would then be tested. Secondary endpoints were: (i) investigator-
assessed objective response (iOR), (ii) centrally-reviewed early
tumor shrinkage (ETS) at 6 weeks, and (iii) centrally reviewed
objective response (cOR), as binary variables. The cut-off to define
response for iOR, ETS, and cOR was tumor shrinkage equal or
higher than 30% from baseline, evaluated according to RECIST
1.0 (16). Patients with missing data were excluded from second-
ary endpoints analyses.
OS and PFS time to first event were analyzed using Kaplan–
Meier curves. Treatment effect on survival outcomes was estimat-
ed with hazard ratios with their confidence intervals computed
through Cox regression model. iOR, ETS, and cOR treatment odds
ratios were calculated using logistic regression models.

Translational Relevance
The current standard of care for first-line treatment options
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) includes
the combination of chemotherapy with an anti-EGFR or anti-
VEGF monoclonal antibody. The presence of a RAS mutation
in the primary tumor precludes the use of anti-EGFR anti-
bodies in this patient population. By measuring miR-31-3p
expression in tumors in the RAS wild-type population of the
FIRE-3 trial, the present study was designed to examine if this
biomarker enables the identification of patients more likely to
benefit from cetuximab compared with bevacizumab in regard
to survival outcomes and objective response to therapy in
mCRC. Our analysis demonstrated that the expression level of
miR-31-3p is predictive of cetuximab efficacy for patient
survival and response-related outcomes as compared with
bevacizumab when both are combined with chemotherapy
for the treatment of mCRC.

 Each baseline characteristic was tested in a univariate anal-
ysis, using biologic treatment as the only covariate, to assess its
prognostic value on survival outcomes. A multivariate model
was then developed using all variables found to be significant
in univariate analyses (threshold of P ¼ 0.01 in miR-pop
and P ¼ 0.05 in subpopulations), removing variables which
were not significant (P � 0.05) in the multivariate model.
MiR-31-3p expression as a quantitative variable (log of expres-
sion level) was tested in univariate analyses only. Mir-31-3p
expression level as a binary variable (low vs. high expression)
was tested alone and with adjustment for selected confound-
ing factors.
The predictivity of miR-31-3p expression level on treatment
efficacy was tested by adding an interaction term with treatment in
the final multivariate prognostic model. Prognostic effect was
considered significant at the threshold of P < 5% and predictive
effect at the threshold of P < 10% as specified in the Statistical
Analysis Plan. The other significant prognostic variables were also
tested for predictivity.
Analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2 and SAS
version 9.4.
Results
Out of 515 subjects with available biological samples, 343
subjects were WT for KRAS and NRAS exons 2 (codons 12 and
13), 3 (codons 59 and 61), and 4 (codons 117 and 146)
(ref. 2). Among the 340 subjects composing the miR-pop,
176 were treated with FOLFIRIþBeva and 164 with FOLFIR-
IþCetux (Fig. 1).
Distributions of baseline characteristics in the miR-pop were
comparable by treatment arms and homogeneous with distri-
butions observed in the FIRE-3 final RAS WT population (2)
(Table 1). One-third of the miR-pop were high expressers
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Although high expressers more often
had right-sided and BRAF V600E mutated tumors compared
with low expressers, both subgroups were comparable for other
characteristics (Table 2). In low and high miR-31-3p expresser
subgroups, treatment arms were balanced for all baseline
characteristics (Supplementary Table S1).
Although OS was significantly longer in subjects treated with
FOLFIRIþCetux [HR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53–
0.93; P ¼ 0.01] in miR-pop (Supplementary Fig. S2), there was no
difference in PFS between the 2 treatment arms (HR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.73–1.16; P ¼ 0.47; Supplementary Fig. S3). This finding is
consistent with results obtained on FIRE-3 final RAS WT
population (PFS: HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78–1.20; P ¼ 0.77 and
OS: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54–0.90; P ¼ 0.006; ref. 2).
Prognostic value of miR-31-3p expression on OS and PFS
MiR-31-3p expression level (quantitative and binary), BRAF
mutational status, ECOG score, tumor sidedness, and number of
metastatic sites were prognostic for PFS and OS (Supplementary
Figs. S4 and S5, respectively) in univariate analyses after adjust-
ment for treatment effect.
MiR-31-3p low expressers had a longer PFS and OS com-
pared with high expressers (median PFS in months: 11.1; 95%
CI, 10.1–12.2 vs. 7.8; 95% CI, 6.9–9.3; HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11–
1.83; P < 0.01; median OS in months: 30.3; 95% CI, 26.1–36.4
vs. 20.3; 95% CI, 14.8–23.8; HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.32–2.34;

 P < 0.01). MiR-31-3p expression as a quantitative variable was
also prognostic of OS and PFS (P < 0.01).
In the multivariate model that included BRAF mutational
status, sidedness, number of metastatic sites and ECOG score as
additional variables to miR-31-3p and treatment arm, the prog-
nostic value of miR-31-3p was still significant for OS (HR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.05–1.96; P ¼ 0.02) but not for PFS (HR, 1.11; 95% CI,
0.85–1.45; P ¼ 0.43).
Differential treatment benefit in low versus high miR-31-3p
subgroups and miR-31-3p expression level predictivity of
treatment effect on OS and PFS
In the low-expressers subpopulation (Fig. 2), a benefit of
FOLFIRIþCetux was observed for PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.55–1.00; P ¼ 0.05) and OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41;0.88;
P < 0.01) in the multivariate model. Median PFS was increased
by 1.3 months and median OS by 12 months in patients treated
with FOLFIRIþCetux compared with patients treated with
FOLFIRIþBeva. Except for female patients for PFS (HR, 1.07,
NS), and patients with right-sided tumor for OS (HR, 1.11; NS),
all subgroups benefitted from FOLFIRIþCetux compared with
FOLFIRIþBeva (HR < 1) for PFS and OS, and the only significant
treatment interaction was the number of metastatic sites for
PFS (P ¼ 0.08; Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7 for PFS and OS,
respectively).
Conversely,
in
the
high-expressers
subgroup
(Fig. 2), no statistically significant benefit of FOLFIRIþCetux was
observed for OS (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.69–1.79; P ¼ 0.65) and
median PFS was increased by 1.7 months in patients treated
with FOLFIRIþBeva compared with patients treated
with
FOLFIRIþCetux. This benefit of FOLFIRIþBeva for PFS in high
expressors was not statistically significant (HR, 1.32; 95% CI,
0.87–2.02; P ¼ 0.19). Significant (P < 0.10) treatment interactions
were observed for BRAF status and number of metastatic sites for
OS, and tumor sidedness for both PFS and OS (Supplementary
Figs. S8 and S9 for PFS and OS, respectively).
In multivariate analyses, a significant interaction was found in
miR-pop between miR-31-3p expression level and treatment arm
for both PFS (interaction test P ¼ 0.03) and OS (interaction test
P ¼ 0.05) demonstrating miR-31-3p expression level was predic-
tive of treatment effect for PFS and OS. With the exception of
tumor sidedness (P < 0.01) and BRAF status (P ¼ 0.08) for OS, no
other predictive factors were found in these analyses (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4 for PFS and Supplementary Fig. S5 for OS).
Analysis of secondary endpoints
The predictive value of miR-31-3p expression level on treat-
ment response was investigated for iOR, ETS at 6 weeks and cOR
(Table 3). MiR-31-3p expression level was predictive of treatment
effect for all 3 endpoints (interaction tests: P ¼ 0.02 for iOR, P ¼
0.04 for ETS and P < 0.01 for cOR). In low expressers, iOR was
86.7% in the FOLFIRIþCetux arm compared with 62.5% for
patients in the FOLFIRIþBeva arm (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.9–8.2;
P < 0.01). In high expressers, there was no significant difference
for iOR between either the FOLFIRIþBeva arm and the
FOLFIRIþCetux arm (iOR, 55.8% and 63.5% respectively, OR,
1.3; 95% CI, 0.6–2.9; P ¼ 0.57).Similar patterns were observed for
cOR and ETS at 6 weeks, with an improved treatment observed in
low expressers treated with FOLFIRIþCetux compared with
FOLFIRIþBeva (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.3;10.5; P < 0.01 for cOR and
OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.1;7.7; P < 0.01 for ETS at 6 weeks), and no
difference in high expressers (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3–1.9; P ¼ 0.56
for cOR, and OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5–3.2; P ¼ 0.60 for ETS at
6 weeks). In patients treated with FOLFIRIþCetux, a linear cor-
relation was found between miR-31-3p expression and tumor
shrinkage
considered
as
continuous
variables
(correlation
coefficient ¼ 0.28, P ¼ 0.002), whereas no correlation was
observed in the FOLFIRIþBeva arm (Supplementary Fig. S10).
The interaction between treatment arm and miR-31-3p expression
level for tumor shrinkage was statistically significant (P ¼ 0.03).
Analysis of the interaction between miR-31-3p expression and
tumor sidedness
Because tumor sidedness has been recently proposed as a
predictive factor of anti-EGFR antibody efficacy in mCRC, we
performed analyses of PFS, OS and iOR by miR-31-3p expression
level and tumor sidedness (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
MiR-31-3p expression was found to be higher in right-sided
tumors than in tumors located in the left colon or rectum (P <
0.05; Table 2). In right-sided tumor subjects, miR-31-3p expres-
sion level was predictive of PFS and OS (interaction miR-31-3p
with treatment: P ¼ 0.04 for PFS and P ¼ 0.06 for OS). In left-sided
tumors, no predictive effect of miR-31-3p on PFS and OS could be
detected. Regarding iOR, the benefit of adding cetuximab to
FOLFIRI as compared with bevacizumab was restricted to low
expressers, regardless of the tumor sidedness. Response rates in
low-expresser patients treated with FOLFIRIþCetux were 89.3%
for left-sided and 72.7% for right-sided tumors, compared with
63.0% and 53.9%, respectively, for patients treated with
FOLFIRIþBeva. In high expressers, response rates were similar
for patients treated with FOLFIRIþCetux and FOLFIRIþBeva in
both left-sided (67.6% vs. 61.3%) and right-sided tumors (53.3%
vs. 50.0%).
Discussion
Precision medicine requires robust biomarkers that identify
patients with a high probability of benefiting from a specific
therapy. This is important for first-line decisions in mCRC because

 20% to 45% of patients do not receive second-line treatment due
to early death or deterioration (17, 18). The FIRE-3 phase-III study
is an optimal trial for the validation of a biomarker for first-line
anti-EGFR therapy in patients with RAS WT mCRC since the anti-
EGFR arm was tested against an anti-VEGF arm in a prospective,
randomized fashion with both arms using the same chemother-
apeutic backbones.
Consistent with previous reports (10–12), we demonstrated
that miR-31-3p expression level within the RAS WT population is
predictive of anti-EGFR therapy efficacy relative to tumor

 response, PFS and OS, after adjustment for confounding factors
such as BRAF mutational status and tumor sidedness. Patients
with RAS WT tumors that had low miR-31-3p expression levels
experienced a significant benefit from FOLFIRIþCetux with a
significantly longer PFS and OS compared with patients receiv-
ing FOLFIRIþBeva. On the contrary, there was no significant
benefit of FOLFIRIþCetux versus FOLFIRIþBeva in patients
with high miR-31-3p expression levels. Although the 1.3 month
PFS difference in favor of FOLFIRIþCetux versus FOLFIRIþBeva
in low miR-31-3p expressors was significant, the 1.7-month
difference in PFS in the opposite direction favoring FOLFIR-
IþBeva in high expressors was not statistically significant due to
the lesser number of patients in the high-expressor subgroup
compared with the low-expressor subgroup. The above results
suggest a potential benefit of using anti-EGFR therapy as first-
line treatment in patients whose tumors have low miR-31-3p
expression level. The results of our study also validate the pre-
specified cutoff value used to define low and high miR-31-3p
expressers.
We also found that miR-31-3p expression level was associated
with early treatment efficacy such as ETS and OR. Patients with
low miR-31-3p expression level had an ETS rate of 56% and a cOR
of 86%. These findings open the possibility of identifying patients
with borderline resectable metastases who may have a higher
likelihood of benefiting from surgery since higher tumor response
has been shown to be correlated with higher secondary resection
rates (19).
Primary tumor sidedness has recently been discussed as a
marker for clinical decision making in metastatic colorectal cancer
since patients with right colon tumors have a worse prognosis
than those with tumors in the left colon (20). Our analyses
revealed that patients with low miR-31-3p expression and left-
sided tumors benefited the most from FOLFIRIþCetux compared
with FOLFIRIþBeva. Although high miR-31-3p expressors with
right-sided tumors benefited more from FOLFIRIþBeva in regard
to OS and PFS, low miR-31-3p expression level was predictive of
an improved response rate for FOLFIRIþCetux compared with
FOLFIRIþBeva, regardless of sidedness. This suggests that if
response is the primary goal of first-line treatment, miR-31-3p
levels may provide a tool for identifying patients with right-sided
tumors who would respond more favorably to FOLFIRIþCetux
versus FOLFIRIþBeva. Conversely, patients with left-sided tumors
benefited from FOLFIRIþCetux vs. FOLFIRIþBeva regardless of
their level of miR-31-3p expression, although the response rate
was higher in low expressors. Because the analysis of tumor
sidedness as a part of the present study was done on a post-hoc
basis, additional studies are needed to better define the impact of
tumor sidedness on the predictive effect of miR-31-3p, especially
in patients with left-sided tumors.
Mir-31 has been shown to promote CRC progression and
mir-31 plays a significant role in activating the RAS signaling
pathway through the inhibition of RAS p21 GTPase activating
protein 1 (RASA1) translation, thereby improving colorectal
cancer cell growth and stimulating tumorigenesis (8, 9). More-
over, different studies have shown that high miR-31 expression
is associated with KRAS and BRAF mutational status in pan-
creatic cancer cells (21). MiR-31 host gene transcription and
mature miR-31 expression have been shown to be induced by
the RAS oncogenic pathway (22, 23). In our study, we indeed
confirmed that miR-31-3p expression level was higher in BRAF
mutant (mean � SD ¼ 2.51 � 3.02 vs. 0.53 � 3.95, Student t
test P < 0.01) and in RAS mutant (data not shown) populations
compared with the RAS/BRAF WT population (24). Further-
more, it has been shown that EGFR suppresses the maturation
process of pre-mir-31 via the phosphorylation of AGO2, in
response to hypoxic stress (Supplementary Fig. S11). Low miR-
31-3p expression could be a consequence of the regulation of
pre-mir-31 maturation by an EGFR activated pathway, driving
tumor sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Contrary to this, high
miR-31-3p expression could be the witness of the tumor's
EGFR independency and subsequently to its resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy.
Following REMARK criteria (13), the predictive value of a pre-
specified cut-off for miR-31-3p expression level was validated
during the present study. On the basis of these results, we propose
performing miR-31-3p testing in conjunction with RAS muta-
tional analyses would add information useful to clinicians for
aiding in the identification of the optimal treatment selection and
maximizing the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of first line anti-
EGFR in their patients with mCRC.
There are several potential limitations for our study. The use
of FOLFIRI as the only backbone chemotherapy in FIRE-3 trial

 and the potential for an interaction between cetuximab and
irinotecan impacting the predictive value of miR-31-3p regard-
ing anti-EGFR agent efficacy cannot be excluded. Also, although
baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment
arms and analyses were conducted according to a prespecified
plan, a potential bias due to the retrospective nature of the
study could exist. The extension of these analyses to other
chemotherapy backbones and/or other anti-EGFR molecules
remains to be studied. Demonstrating similar findings follow-
ing the analysis of tumor samples from other randomized
controlled trials, or from real-life cohorts would enable the
possibility to generalize our conclusions to all patients with
mCRC treated in first line.
In conclusion, using a prespecified cutoff, miR-31-3p expres-
sion level was validated as a predictive biomarker of the efficacy of
first-line cetuximab therapy when use in the treatment of mCRC
patients. Patients with low miR-31-3p–expressing tumors had a
significantly greater benefit from FOLFIRI plus cetuximab when
compared with patients treated FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. This
suggests that miR-31-3p expression level is a useful biomarker to
further personalize the treatment of mCRC. Additional studies are
warranted to determine whether similar findings would be
observed in patients with mCRC treated in first line with FOLFOX
plus EGFR-antibody therapy.
