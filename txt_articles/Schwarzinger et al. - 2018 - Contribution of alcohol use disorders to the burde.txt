dementia in France 2008–13: a nationwide retrospective 
cohort study

Summary
Background Dementia is a prevalent condition, affecting 5–7% of people aged 60 years and older, and a leading cause 
of disability in people aged 60 years and older globally. We aimed to examine the association between alcohol use 
disorders and dementia risk, with an emphasis on early-onset dementia (<65 years).
Methods We analysed a nationwide retrospective cohort of all adult (≥20 years) patients admitted to hospital in 
metropolitan France between 2008 and 2013. The primary exposure was alcohol use disorders and the main outcome 
was dementia, both defined by International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision discharge diagnosis codes. 
Characteristics of early-onset dementia were studied among prevalent cases in 2008–13. Associations of alcohol use 
disorders and other risk factors with dementia onset were analysed in multivariate Cox models among patients 
admitted to hospital in 2011–13 with no record of dementia in 2008–10.
Findings Of 31 624 156 adults discharged from French hospitals between 2008 and 2013, 1 109 343 were diagnosed with 
dementia and were included in the analyses. Of the 57 353 (5·2%) cases of early-onset dementia, most were either 
alcohol-related by definition (22 338 [38·9%]) or had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders (10 115 [17·6%]). 
Alcohol use disorders were the strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 
3·34 (95% CI 3·28–3·41) for women and 3·36 (3·31–3·41) for men. Alcohol use disorders remained associated with 
dementia onset for both sexes (adjusted hazard ratios >1·7) in sensitivity analyses on dementia case definition 
(including Alzheimer’s disease) or older study populations. Also, alcohol use disorders were significantly associated 
with all other risk factors for dementia onset (all p<0·0001).
Interpretation Alcohol use disorders were a major risk factor for onset of all types of dementia, and especially early-
onset dementia. Thus, screening for heavy drinking should be part of regular medical care, with intervention or 
treatment being offered when necessary. Additionally, other alcohol policies should be considered to reduce heavy 
drinking in the general population.

Background
Dementia is a clinical syndrome caused by brain damage 
and characterised by progressive deterioration in 
cognitive ability and capacity for independent living and 
functioning.1 It is a common condition, affecting 5–7% of 
people aged 60 years and older worldwide,2 and is a 
leading cause of disability in people aged 60 years and 
older.3 Several types of dementia exist; Alzheimer’s 
disease is the most common, followed by vascular 
dementia and rarer types of dementia, although mixed 
types of dementia often coexist.
Alcohol use has been associated with changes in 
cognitive health and dementia (appendix p 3). Briefly, 
the relationships between alcohol use and cognitive 
health in general and dementia in particular are 
complex.4 Most reviews point to a possible beneficial 
effect of light-to-moderate drinking on cognitive health. 
However, moderate drinking has been consistently 
associated with detrimental effects on brain structure,5,6 
and nearly every review describes methodological 
problems of underlying studies, such as inconsistent 
measurement of alcohol use or dementia, or both, and 
insufficient control of potential confounders.
By contrast, heavy drinking seems detrimentally 
related to dementia risk, whatever the dementia type. 
First, ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde have a 
direct neurotoxic effect, leading to permanent structural 
and functional brain damage. Second, heavy drinking 
is associated with thiamine deficiency, leading to 
Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Third, heavy drinking is 
a risk factor for other conditions that can also damage the 
brain, such as epilepsy, head injury, and hepatic 
encephalopathy in patients with cirrhotic liver disease. 
Fourth, heavy drinking is indirectly associated with 
vascular dementia because of the associations of heavy 
drinking with vascular risk factors such as high blood 
pressure, haemorrhagic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and

heart failure. Finally, heavy drinking is associated with 
tobacco smoking, depression, and low educational 
attainment, which are possible risk factors for dementia. 
This combined evidence has led to a discussion about 
establishing a specific diagnosis of alcohol-related 
dementia;7–9 however, alcohol use was not included in the 
life-course model of risk factors for dementia in the 
recent Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, 
intervention, and care.1
This study explores the effects of alcohol use disorders 
on dementia onset in France. Alcohol use disorders are 
defined by the chronic harmful use of alcohol or alcohol 
dependence.10 The prevalence of alcohol use disorders 
in France is close to the European Union mean and 
markedly higher than global means.11 We examined the 
sex-specific effects of alcohol use disorders on early-onset 
dementia (<65 years),9,12 and investigated possible effect 
modification by dementia type.
Methods
Study design
The data source for this study was the French 
National Hospital Discharge database (Programme de 
Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information), which 
contains all public and private claims for acute inpatient 
and day-case hospital admissions, post-acute care, and 
psychiatric care since 2008. The standardised discharge 
summary includes patient demographics (sex, age at 
entry, and postal code of residency); primary and 
associated discharge diagnosis codes according to the 
WHO International Classification of Diseases, tenth 
revision (ICD-10); medical procedures received; length of 
stay; and discharge modes (including in-hospital death). 
Using unique anonymous identifiers, the hospital 
trajectory of each patient could be traced from 
2008 to 2013.13
We included all patients aged 20 years and older residing 
in metropolitan France who were discharged in the 
years 2008–13. Following ICD-10 taxonomy, we excluded all 
patients discharged with diseases that can lead to rare types 
of dementia (F02): infectious diseases including HIV
/AIDS, 
hereditary metabolic disorders, hereditary neurological 
disorders including Huntington’s disease, other neuro-
logical disorders including Parkinson’s disease, and 
systemic connective tissue disorders. We also excluded 
patients with early-life mental disorders that could increase 
or confound dementia diagnosis, including cerebral palsy, 
Down’s syndrome and other learning disabilities, and 
schizophrenia. The full coding dictionary of exclusion 
criteria, dementia case definitions, and risk factors assessed 
before dementia onset is provided in the appendix (p 14–18).
The study was approved by the French National 
Commission for Data Protection (CNIL DE-2015-025), 
who granted access to the French National Hospital 
Discharge database for the years 2008 to 2013. The 
requirement for informed consent was waived because 
the study used de-identified data.
Procedures
The primary exposure was alcohol use disorders and the 
main outcome was dementia. Dementia was defined by 
any primary or associated discharge diagnosis (ICD-10) 
codes labelling dementia (F00-F03, F05.1, F1x.73, or G30) 
or related to dementia (other degenerative diseases 
of the nervous system [G31], progressive vascular 
leukoencephalopathy [I67
.3], or senility [R54]).14,15
Dementia onset was defined by the age at first dementia 
diagnosis recorded from 2008 to 2013; diagnoses made 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was done 
using OVID to identify all work published from 2000 to 
Oct 3, 2017, on MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. Reviews on 
the effects of alcohol use on cognitive health were identified 
using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings 
terms related to alcohol use, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, 
brain function, memory, and cognitive health (appendix 
pp 3–7). 23 relevant systematic reviews were identified. For 
light-to-moderate drinking, most reviews reported some 
beneficial relationships, even though alcohol use seemed to be 
associated with structural brain damage at moderate levels of 
drinking. For heavy drinking, defined by WHO and the European 
Medicines Agency as drinking at least 60 g of pure alcohol per 
day for men and at least 40 g for women, most research 
pointed towards a detrimental effect of alcohol on cognitive 
health and an increased risk of dementia. Nearly every review 
describes methodological problems of underlying studies, such 
as under-representation of heavy drinkers in population-based 
cohorts; inconsistent measurement of alcohol use or dementia, 
or both; insufficient control of potential confounders; and 
insufficient consideration of sample attrition in patients with 
alcohol use disorders.
Added value of this study
Using a representative large cohort of all patients admitted to 
French hospitals between 2008 and 2013, we found a strong 
association between alcohol use disorders and dementia. 
Under the age of 65 years, most prevalent cases of dementia 
were either alcohol related by definition, or patients qualified 
for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders. Alcohol use disorders 
contributed markedly to dementia incidence, and were 
associated with all types of dementia over the lifetime. Thus, 
heavy drinking should be considered as one of the major risk 
factors for this cluster of diseases. Screening, brief 
interventions for heavy drinking, and treatment for alcohol use 
disorders should be implemented to reduce the 
alcohol-attributable burden of dementia.

before age 65 years were classed as early-onset dementia. 
Dementia onset was separated into three categories: 
alcohol-related brain damage (F10.73, G31.2); vascular 
dementia; and other dementia, including Alzheimer’s 
disease. Vascular dementia was broadly defined by any 
record of vascular dementia, mixed dementia, or 
progressive vascular leukoencephalopathy as well as 
any dementia with a history of stroke or transient 
ischaemic attack.16
Alcohol use disorders were identified by two categories 
of discharge diagnosis (ICD-10) codes: mental and 
behavioural disorders due to former or current chronic 
harmful use of alcohol (F10.1–F10.9, Z50.2), including 
alcohol abstinence (F10.20–F10.23); or chronic diseases 
attributable to alcohol use disorders (eg, K70 for alcoholic 
liver disease).10 Alcohol-related conditions were Wernicke-
Korsakoff syndrome, end-stage liver disease and other 
forms of liver cirrhosis, epilepsy, and head injury.
Vascular risk factors were tobacco smoking, obesity 
(body-mass index ≥30 kg/m²), high blood pressure, 
hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes.1 Cerebrovascular diseases 
included haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, a history 
of stroke, a history of transient ischaemic attack, and 
cerebrovascular diseases other than stroke, all assessed 
before stroke. Other cardiovascular diseases were 
ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, atrial 
fibrillation, and heart failure.
Educational level is not recorded in the standardised 
discharge summary. We used 5645 postal codes of 
residency as a proxy of educational level and for each 
geographical area compared the proportion of adults 
with no high school diploma in the fourth (≥67·9%) or 
third (61·3–67·8%) quartiles with others (Institut 
National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques, 
French census on Jan 1, 2011). Other established risk 
factors for dementia included depression and hearing 
loss.1 Additionally, we controlled for possible risk factors 
for dementia, including visual impairment that might 
result from retinopathy or glaucoma,1 sleep apnoea,1 and 
other diseases that might lead to rare types of dementia 
(ie, 
chronic 
kidney 
disease 
including 
uraemia, 
hypothyroidism including myxoedema, and infectious 
diseases of the CNS including encephalitis).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were stratified by sex because men have 
shorter life expectancy and higher incidence of almost all 
risk factors considered. We initially studied prevalent 
dementia cases in 2008–13 and the distribution of 
alcohol-related brain damage and other alcohol use 
disorders by age at dementia onset. Because dementia is 
often associated with long diagnosis delays and 
associations of risk factors with dementia could be 
confounded by reverse causation,17 we conservatively 
studied risk factors for incident dementia among patients 
admitted to hospital from 2011 to 2013 who had no record 
of dementia from 2008 to 2010.18 The effects of alcohol 
use disorders and other risk factors on dementia onset, 
overall and by type, were estimated in multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models without variable selection. 
Age was used as the timescale to estimate adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs, with follow-up starting 
from Jan 1, 2011 (with independent left truncation on 
Jan 1, 2011) until dementia onset, in-hospital death, or 
right-censoring at last hospital discharge from 2011 to 
2013.17,19,20 Observed non-proportional hazards were 
accounted for by including all risk factors as age-varying 
variables; alcohol use disorders, tobacco smoking, and 
personal histories of conditions (head injury, stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, or myocardial infarction) were 
considered in the risk set starting from Jan 1, 2011, and 
other risk factors were conservatively identified at first 
hospital record.17 All Cox models were stratified by patient 
residency area across 21 French administrative regions 
(Corsica was included in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur 
region), having received care in a teaching hospital, and 
the first year of hospital admission from 2008 to 2013 to 
account for geographical and temporal variations in 
alcohol use exposure and dementia diagnosis as well as 
possible levels of misclassification for all variables.
We did several sensitivity analyses to ascertain the 
effects of alcohol use disorders on dementia onset. 
First, we used definitions of dementia restricted to 
primary discharge diagnosis codes of dementia; ICD-10 
codes labelling dementia, overall or by dementia type 
(vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease); and severity 
level (first diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment 
without or before dementia, first diagnosis of dementia 
at a severe stage). Second, we considered the full 
sample, while all exclusion criteria were introduced 
among previous covariates. Third, we selected study 
populations at older landmark ages on Jan 1, 2011 
(≥45 years, ≥55 years, ≥65 years, ≥75 years, or ≥85 years). 
Finally, the effects of alcohol abstinence (in people with 
previous alcohol use disorders) and other uncontrolled 
alcohol use disorders on the risks for dementia onset 
and in-hospital death were contrasted over the lifetime 
by use of a third-order polynomial of age on Jan 1, 2011, 
in Cox models adjusted for proxy of educational level 
and vascular risk factors, and stratified by previous 
variables. 
We did a falsification analysis in all Cox multivariate 
models, which relies on disease controls selected for 
their unknown and therefore unlikely association with 
an outcome.21 If no association is found for the disease 
controls in a large dataset such as a national hospital 
discharge database, it supports the validity of the 
associations found for the risk factors under study. We 
used cancer as a control, separated into three disease 
categories in relation to prognosis and possible 
association with dementia onset: cancer or metastasis of 
the CNS, other non-melanoma skin cancer assessed 
before brain metastasis, and non-melanoma skin cancer. 
All analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4).

Results
Of 31 624 156 adults discharged from French hospitals 
from 2008 to 2013, 1 328 191 (4·2%) were diagnosed with 
dementia (appendix p 20). We excluded 1 066 019 patients 
(3·4%) with diseases that can lead to rare types of 
dementia or with early-life mental disorders that can 
increase or confound dementia diagnosis (218 848 [20·5%] 
dementia cases; appendix p 20).
720 215 (64·9%) of the 1 109 343 dementia cases were 
women (figure 1). The proportion of women increased 
with age at dementia onset. Conversely, 37 233 (64·9%) of 
the 57 353 (5·2% of total) early-onset dementia cases 
were men.
945 512 (3·1%) of 30 558 137 adults were discharged with 
alcohol use disorders (712 583 [5·5%] of 12 941 788 men and 
232 929 [1·3%] of 17 616 349 women), of whom 816 160 
(86·3%) qualified for alcohol dependency and 140 312 
(14·8%) had at least one period of alcohol abstinence 
in 2008–13. Alcohol-related brain damage was recorded in 
35 034 dementia cases and other alcohol use disorders in 
52 625 (figure 1). Both conditions were more frequently 
recorded in men (26 084 [74·5%] and 35 006 [66·5%], 
respectively; p<0·0001) and accounted for 32 453 (56·6%) 
of 57 353 early-onset dementia cases (22 338 [38·9%] and 
10 115 [17·6%], respectively).
Of 8 295 081 men discharged from 2011 to 2013, 
181 255 (2·2%) were newly diagnosed with dementia at a 
median age of 82 years (IQR 75–87; table). Alcohol use 
disorders were recorded in 512 473 (6·2%) men and 
29 944 (16·5%) of men with dementia. Alcohol use 
disorders were associated with an increased risk for 
dementia onset among men (HR 3·36, 95% CI 
3·31–3·41). Alcohol use disorders were the strongest 
modifiable risk factor for dementia onset in men 
(figure 2).
Regarding dementia type, 12 435 (6·9%) of 181 255 men 
with newly diagnosed dementia had alcohol-related 
brain damage at a median age of 60 years (IQR 53–69; 
appendix p 23). The strongest association with alcohol-
related brain damage was with end-stage liver disease 
(3593 [28·9%], HR 27·28, 95% CI 26·00–28·61) followed 
by liver cirrhosis (2491 [20·0%], 23·50, 22·29–24·78). 
Several risk factors independently contributed to alcohol-
related brain damage, in particular all alcohol-related 
conditions and tobacco smoking (HR >2 for all; 
appendix p 23).
Compared with alcohol-related brain damage, dementia 
onset was significantly delayed in other dementia types 
(p<0·0001). Of 181 255 men with newly diagnosed 
dementia, 69 700 (38·5%; median age 82 years, 
IQR 77–87) had vascular dementia (appendix p 24) and 
99 120 (54·7%; 83 years, 77–87) had other dementia 
(appendix p 25). Alcohol use disorders were more 
frequently recorded in vascular dementia (11·2%) than in 
other dementia (9·8%; p<0·0001). In multivariate Cox 
analyses, alcohol use disorders remained associated with 
an increased risk for each dementia type (vascular 
dementia HR 2·30, 95% CI 2·24–2·36; other dementia 
2·36, 2·31–2·42).
Of 11 474 359 women discharged from 2011 to 2013, 
322 261 (2·8%) were newly diagnosed with dementia 
(table). Incidence of dementia was lower in women than

men up to age 80 years (appendix p 19). Collectively, the 
median age at dementia onset was significantly delayed 
in women compared with men (85 years, IQR 80–89 vs 
82 years, 75–87; p<0·0001), with significantly fewer 
reports of alcohol-related brain damage (4281 [1·3%] and 
12 435 [6·8%], respectively) and vascular dementia 
(104 113 [32·3%] and 69 700 [38·5%], respectively; 
p<0·0001).
Alcohol use disorders in women were similarly 
associated as in men, with an increased risk for dementia 
onset (HR 3·34, 95% CI 3·28–3·41) and were the 
strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset in 
women (figure 2). About the same independent risk 
factors for dementia onset were identified for both sexes 
(adjusted HRs >1): all alcohol-related conditions; tobacco 
smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes among 
vascular risk factors; haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic 
stroke, a history of stroke, peripheral arterial diseases 
(in men), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure among 
cardiovascular diseases; and patient residency area with 
less education, depression, hearing loss, chronic kidney 
failure, hypothyroidism, and infectious disease of the 
CNS among other risk factors (table).
However, except for depression and hypothyroidism, 
alcohol use disorders and all other independent risk 
factors for dementia were significantly less frequently 
recorded in women than in men (appendix p 21). 
In addition, except for alcohol use disorders, atrial 
fibrillation, lower education attainment, and hypo-
thyroidism, strengths of association of the risk factors 
with dementia onset were significantly different between 
the sexes: higher in men for alcohol-related conditions, 
stroke, heart failure, depression, hearing loss, and 
infectious diseases of the CNS; and higher in women for 
vascular risk factors and chronic kidney failure (table; 
p<0·05 for all).
The main study results were generally supported by 
sensitivity and falsification analyses. Alcohol use 
disorders were strongly associated with dementia onset 
for any case definition of dementia (figure 3; appendix 
pp 27–32), and when the full sample was considered with 
all exclusion criteria introduced among previous 
covariates (appendix pp 33–34). In other sensitivity 
analyses in older study populations selected on Jan 1, 
2011, alcohol use disorders remained strongly associated 
with late-onset dementia (appendix pp 35–39). Compared 
with uncontrolled alcohol use disorders (appendix p 40), 
alcohol abstinence was significantly associated with lower 
risks of competing mortality over the lifespan, although 
no risk reduction was observed for dementia onset 
(appendix pp 41–44). Finally, regarding the falsification 
analysis, none of the cancer categories was associated 
with dementia onset, irrespective of cancer site (table) 
and prognosis (appendix p 26).
Discussion
In this nationwide study, we found a marked association 
of alcohol use disorders with all types of dementia, even 
after controlling for potential confounding risk factors.1 
The overall HR for onset of all types of dementia was 
above 3·3, and for vascular and other dementia remained 
above 2·3 for both sexes. The association with alcohol 
use disorders was especially important in those with 
early-onset dementia, with most patients having alcohol-
related brain damage or an additional diagnosis of 
alcohol use disorders. This finding corroborates other 
results, which suggested alcohol is a risk factor for early-
onset dementia in men.12
The French health-care system provides not only 
universal, but also liberal access to hospital care with 
minimal out-of-pocket expenses. Consequently, more 
than 80% of French adults older than 65 years (50% before 
that age) were admitted to hospital over the 6-year study 
period (appendix p 45), supporting a high generalisability

of the study findings to the French population18 as well as 
populations with similar exposure to the risk factors in 
general, and to alcohol use disorders in particular.11
However, several potential limitations of our study 
should be acknowledged, including misclassified and 
missing variables due to the administrative recording 
of data. One limitation relates to the assessment of 
dementia, overall and by type. Although the French 
claims database is subject to high levels of quality control, 
all ICD-10 codes of dementia recorded as secondary 
discharge diagnoses (except senility) would be associated 
with better hospital reimbursement. Indeed, only 
188 841 (37·5%) of 503 516 new dementia cases were 
identified as the primary discharge diagnosis for both 
sexes (appendix p 27). However, an opportunistic, up-
coding bias seems equivocal because the comparison of 
incidence by sex and age with the reference cohort study 
done in the southwest of France showed no clear 
differences (appendix p 19) and differences are likely to 
be attributed to unstable estimates caused by the small 
sample size in the reference cohort study (190 new 
dementia cases over 5 years).22
Diagnosis of dementia type remains probabilistic 
without brain autopsy, as is the case in most 
epidemiological studies. Accordingly, we included 
122 903 new patients identified with ICD-10 codes related 
to dementia, because 37 951 (30·9%) were eventually 
diagnosed with ICD-10 codes labelling dementia in the 
follow-up.15 Because of our study aim, we unconventionally 
prioritised alcohol-related brain damage and vascular 
dementia over Alzheimer’s disease. Accordingly, the 
proportion of vascular dementia cases recorded of the 
503 516 new dementia cases almost doubled from 96 252 
(19·1%) with use of ICD-10 codes for vascular dementia, a 
rate usually reported,23 to 173 813 (34·5%) with additional 
use of any record of mixed dementia or dementia with a 
history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.16 However, 
the main study findings were corroborated in all sensitivity 
analyses done on dementia case definition.
A second limitation relates to the identification of 
alcohol use disorders and other risk factors for dementia. 
Even though alcohol use disorders were identified by 
several sources of medical information including post-
acute rehabilitation over 6 years, alcohol use disorders 
were most likely underestimated compared with 
prevalence estimates for France (16·7% for men and 
5·4% for women).11 Alcohol use disorders are highly 
stigmatised,24 with low treatment rates of around 10% in 
Europe;25 thus, probably only the more severe cases with 
alcohol dependence were recorded at hospital. However, 
such a bias would translate into a potential under-
estimation of the effect of alcohol use disorders on 
dementia onset.26
Similarly, 
vascular 
risk 
factors 
were 
probably 
underestimated. However, except high blood pressure,1 
the effects of vascular risk factors on dementia onset are 
probably mediated by cerebrovascular diseases that are 
measured exhaustively at hospital and were adjusted for 
in all multivariate analyses. In this regard, we found that 
obesity and hyperlipidaemia were not independently 
associated with dementia onset, in agreement with 
recent reviews.27,28
A final limitation concerns the fact that assessments 
using large-scale administrative databases are typically 
overpowered to find statistical differences,21 which is true 
for the French National Hospital Discharge database. 
However, we did a falsification analysis by adding cancer 
controls to all analyses. None of the cancer controls were 
associated with dementia onset, supporting the main 
study findings. Additionally, the effect sizes of alcohol

use disorders on dementia onset were substantial and 
would have probably been significant in epidemiological 
studies with smaller sample sizes if patients with alcohol 
use disorders were included and alcohol exposure 
was assessed. Overall, although misclassification and 
missing variables might have biased our findings, these 
biases would have been mainly in the direction of 
underestimation.
Findings from this nationwide study suggest that the 
burden of dementia attributable to alcohol is much larger 
than previously thought. In multivariate analyses, alcohol 
use disorders were the strongest modifiable risk factor 
for dementia onset. Additionally, although alcohol 
abstinence was expectedly associated with a lower risk of 
competing death compared with uncontrolled alcohol 
use disorders, the study findings show that the risk for 
dementia onset remained unchanged after abstinence. 
This finding corroborates recent results showing that 
alcohol use directly exerts lifelong brain damage.5,6 
Finally, alcohol use disorders were associated with all 
other independent risk factors for dementia onset, 
suggesting that alcohol use disorders contribute in many 
ways to the risk of dementia.
In summary, our study findings support that alcohol 
use disorders should be recognised as a major risk factor 
for all types of dementia. Alcohol-related dementia 
should be recognised as one of the main causes of early-
onset dementia.7–9 Additionally, clinicians should be 
better aware of the role of alcohol use disorders in 
dementia onset over the lifetime, which seems to be a 
risk factor often omitted.1 Early detection, brief 
interventions 
(ie, 
short, 
structured 
motivational 
interviews to support individuals to change alcohol-
related behaviour), and treatment for alcohol dependence 
or less severe alcohol use disorders are effective and 
even cost-effective measures in primary care.29 Alcohol 
policy measures, such as reduction of availability, 
increase of taxation, and ban on advertising and 
marketing, have also proven to be effective and cost-
effective,30 although these measures have tended not to 
be popular with governments. For instance, the ban on 
alcohol advertisements was recently repealed in France.31 
If all these measures are implemented widely, they could 
not only reduce dementia incidence or delay dementia 
onset, but also reduce all alcohol-attributable morbidity 
and mortality.25
