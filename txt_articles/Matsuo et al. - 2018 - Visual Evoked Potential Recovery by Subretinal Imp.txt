Abstract: Retinal prosthesis or artificial retina is a promis-
ing modality of treatment for outer retinal degeneration,
caused by primary and secondary loss of photoreceptor
cells, in hereditary retinal dystrophy and age-related macu-
lar degeneration, respectively. Okayama University-type
retinal prosthesis (OUReP) is a photoelectric dye-coupled
polyethylene film which generates electric potential in
response to light and stimulates nearby neurons. The dye-
coupled films were implanted by vitreous surgery in the
subretinal space of monkey eyes with macular degenera-
tion which had been induced by cobalt chloride injection
from the scleral side. A pilot 1-month observation study
involved 6 monkeys and a pivotal 6-month observation
study involved 8 monkeys. Of 8 monkeys in 6-month
group, 3 monkeys underwent dye-coupled film removal at
5 months and were observed further for 1 month. The
amplitude of visual evoked potential which had been
reduced by macular degeneration did recover at 1 month
after film implantation and maintained the level at 6
months. Optical coherence tomography showed no retinal
detachment, and full-field electroretinograms maintained
a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, indicative of no retinal tox-
icity. Pathological examinations after 6-month implanta-
tion showed structural integrity of the inner retinal layer in
close apposition to dye-coupled films. The implanted films
which were removed by vitrectomy 5 months later showed
light-evoked surface electric potentials by scanning Kelvin
probe measurement. The photoelectric dye-coupled film
(OUReP), which serves as a light-receiver and a displace-
ment current generator in the subretinal space of the eye,
has a potential for recovering vision in diseases with photo-
receptor cell loss, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-
related macular degeneration.

Blind patients with hereditary retinal diseases,
such as retinitis pigmentosa (1,2), have dead photo-
receptor cells, but the other retinal neurons which
send axons to the brain remain alive (3). The basic
concept of retinal prostheses is to stimulate surviv-
ing retinal neurons such as ganglion cells and bipo-
lar cells with artificial devices and to exploit the
function of these living neurons, and finally to send
messages to the brain, following artificial stimula-
tion in response to light (4).
At the clinical level, the main stream of retinal
prosthesis which has been approved by US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) utilizes a multi-
electrode array (4–6). Camera-captured images are
collapsed to 60 pixels, and the electric current,
corresponding to grayscale tone in each pixel, is

 outputted from 60 electrodes to stimulate retinal liv-
ing neurons in the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Sys-
tem (Second Sight Medical Products, Sylmar, CA,
USA). In addition to the Argus II, Retina Implant
Alpha AMS (preceding Alpha IMS, Retina Implant
AG, Aachen, Germany) and Epi-retinal IRIS II
Bionic Vision System (Pixium Vision, Paris, France)
have obtained CE marks in the European market
(7–9). Surgical implantation of these multielectrode
arrays requires sophisticated techniques. At the level
of animal studies, several different types of retinal
prostheses are designed to be cableless (10,11), and,
for example, utilize a wireless subretinal neurostimu-
lator (12) or photovoltaic systems (13,14).
Okayama
University-type
retinal
prosthesis
(OUReP) is a new type of retinal prosthesis, so-
called photoelectric dye-coupled thin film retinal
prosthesis (15–20). Stable photoelectric dye mole-
cules with absorption spectrum of visible light (21,22)
are chemically coupled to polyethylene film surface.
The dye-coupled film generates electric potential in
response to light and stimulates nearby neuronal cells
to induce action potential (23). The dye-coupled
film, implanted in subretinal space of the eye, serves
as a light receiver and an electric potential generator,
and thus, replaces the function of dead photorecep-
tor cells in retinal dystrophy to send the signal to the
brain through living retinal bipolar cells, ganglion
cells and their axons as optic nerve fibers. From a
surgical viewpoint, the dye-coupled film is a soft and
thin sheet which can be rolled up and inserted in the
subretinal space of the eyes by standard vitreous sur-
gery (vitrectomy) (24,25).
In our previous studies, we showed vision recov-
ery in retinal dystrophic rats (RCS rats) with dye-
coupled film implantation (26–28). In this study,
the dye-coupled films were implanted by vitreous
surgery in the subretinal space of monkey eyes with
cobalt chloride-induced macular degeneration. The
monkeys underwent ophthalmic examinations such
as optical coherence tomography, electroretinogra-
phy, and visual evoked potential for 6 months to
test the safety and efficacy of dye-coupled films. In
addition, spectrophotometric absorbance and light-
evoked surface electric potential were measured on
the removed dye-coupled films which had been
implanted for 5 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of dye-coupled polyethylene film
Thin films were made from purified polyethylene
powder and exposed to fuming nitric acid to introduce
carboxyl moieties on the film surface. Photoelectric
dye molecules, 2-[2-[4-(dibutylamino)phenyl]ethenyl]-
3-carboxymethylbenzothiazolium bromide (NK-5962,
Hayashibara, Inc., Okayama, Japan), were coupled to
carboxyl moieties of the polyethylene film surface via
ethylenediamine, as described previously (16,18,26).
The dye-coupled films were manufactured under a
quality management system at a clean-room facility in
the Okayama University Incubator.
Animals
Cynomolgus
monkeys
(purpose-bred,
anti-B
virus antibody-negative) were used in this study
(Table 1): six monkeys for 1-month observation in
a pilot study and eight monkeys for 6-month obser-
vation in a pivotal study. Dye-coupled films were
implanted for 1 month in six monkeys and for 6
months in eight monkeys. Of these eight monkeys
in the 6-month observation group, three monkeys
underwent film removal at the time point of 5
months after the implantation to analyze spectro-
photometric absorbance and light-evoked surface
electric potential of the implanted films. Schedules
for surgeries and examinations (optical coherence
tomography, full-field and focal electroretinogra-
phy, and visual evoked potential) are summarized
in Table 1. All surgeries were done only in the right
eye and the left eye served as control.
Before dye-coupled film implantation, macular
degeneration
extending
to
the
temporal
mid-
peripheral retina was induced in the right eye of
each monkey by subretinal injection of cobalt chlo-
ride solution (cobalt chloride hexahydrate solution
30 lL, 0.4 mg/mL) from scleral incision (29), and
was confirmed by extinguished recordings of focal
electroretinography. From the viewpoint of surgical
intervention, monkey eyes are smaller in size, com-
pared with human eyes. Lateral canthotomy was,
therefore, performed to expose the entire circum-
ference of the bulbar conjunctiva around the cor-
nea with a lid speculum, and to allow 25G trocars
for vitrectomy to be placed as usual as in human
eyes (Fig. 1c).
At cataract surgery (Fig. 1a,b), anterior capsulec-
tomy was accomplished by cutting with a 25G vitre-
ous cutter inserted from a corneal limbal side-port
under continuous irrigation with a 25G infusion
cannula also inserted from another limbal side-port,
as done in congenital cataract surgery in human
eyes (30). At vitrectomy (25), retinal detachment
(retinal bleb) was successfully induced in the area
with retinal degeneration by subretinal injection of
intraocular irrigating solution with a 38G polyimide
tip (Fig. 1d,e). A sheet of dye-coupled film in 2.5 3

square
size
was

 procedures for surgeries and ophthalmic examina-
tions are given in the Appendix.
All monkeys were sacrificed by bleeding with
overdose of intravenous thiopental (sodium pento-
barbital 64.8 mg/mL, 0.4 mL/kg of body weight,
Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan), and both eyes
were enucleated. After the cornea and iris were
removed by circumferential incision of the eye ball,
the posterior segment was cut meridionally to view
the entire retina. The posterior segment was then
fixed with phosphate buffered 2.5% formaldehyde
and 3% glutaraldehyde, stored in 10% neutral pH
formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sec-
tions were cut and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin for pathological examinations.
This study was approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee at Okayama University and
also by the Committee at Shin Nippon Biomedical
Laboratories, Inc., based on the Animal Welfare
and Management
Act in Japan.
The 6-month
implantation study was based on the Good Labora-
tory Practice in Japan. All experimental procedures
were in accordance with the ARVO Statement for
the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision
Research.
Visual evoked potential and statistical analysis
Recordings with 128-time summation from the
right visual cortex (Channel 1) in response to repet-
itive photic stimuli to the right eye were used for
the right eye amplitude while recordings from the
left visual cortex (Channel 2) in response to left
eye stimuli were used for the left eye amplitude.
This is based on the fact that the uncrossed retinal
nerve fibers, temporal to the macula, go to the right
visual cortex while the crossed retinal nerve fibers,
nasal to the macula, go to the left visual cortex.
In statistical analyses, two monkeys, one each in
1-month study (No. 1–1) and in 6-month study (No.
2–3)
were
excluded
because
the
films
were
implanted at the normal retinal site, but not at the
site of retinal degeneration. One monkey in 1-
month study (No. 1–2) was excluded because the
film was found by pathology to be implanted in the
choroid (Fig. 5). One monkey in 6-month group
(No. 2–1) was also excluded because the amplitude
of visual evoked potential was not reduced after
retinal degeneration had been induced by cobalt
chloride injection. Thus, the analysis set for 1-
month observation included four monkeys and the
analysis set for 6-month observation included three
monkeys with continuous film implantation and
three monkeys with film removal on Day 133.
The amplitude of the first positive peak (P1) and
the amplitude of the first negative peak (N1) were
summed to obtain the P1-N1 amplitude, and the
amplitude of N1 and the amplitude of the second
positive peak (P2) were summed to obtain the N1-
P2 amplitude (Fig. 7a). These P1-N1 and N1-P2
amplitudes were compared between time points
before and after dye-coupled film implantation by
repeat-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
paired t-test. Statistical analyses were also done for
the percent ratio of right-eye-stimulated and right-
lobe-recorded amplitudes over left-eye-stimulated
and left-lobe-recorded amplitudes. The right eyes
underwent surgeries while the left eyes had no
intervention to serve as controls.
Spectrophotometry and light-evoked surface
potential measurement
Absorbance spectra of dye-coupled films were
measured by an ultraviolet and visible light spectro-
photometer with an integrating sphere unit (V-750
and PIV-756, JASCO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Plain polyethylene films were used to obtain base-
line absorbance. Absorbance was measured in the
wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 800 nm at 1 nm
spectral bandwidth. Absorbance values at 508 nm
were used for comparison between the implanted
film and the nonimplanted same lot.
Light-evoked surface electric potential on dye-
coupled films in the dry condition was measured by
the scanning Kelvin Probe system (SKP5050, KP
Technology, Ltd., Highlands and Islands, UK) in
the surface photovoltage mode (25). The entire
measuring
system
was
placed
in
a
humidity-
controlling large box. The dye-coupled film was fix-
ated on a sample device. The surface potential was
measured at changing light intensity with a light
source (Surface Photovoltage Spectroscopy SPS040,
KP Technology). The slope of surface potential
changes in response to increase of light intensity as
well as the surface potential in light intensity of
dial setting at 2500 (300 lux equivalent) and at 5000
were used as the outcome.
RESULTS
Surgical feasibility and outcome
All monkeys in the 1-month study and 6-month
study were healthy in the observation period. Rheg-
matogenous retinal detachment, as a surgical com-
plication, was found only in one monkey (No. 1–1)
in the 1-month study. All six monkeys for 1-month
observation developed small pupillary areas by
anterior capsular contraction with iris adhesion 2

 weeks after lensectomy and vitrectomy, and under-
went anterior and posterior capsulectomy with iris
synechialysis to enlarge the pupillary areas. Based
on this experience in the 1-month study, anterior
and posterior capsules were resected to the periph-
ery as far as possible (Fig. 1c) at the initial surgery
in eight monkeys for 6-month observation. Under
the circumstances, of these eight monkeys, only two
monkeys (No. 2–5 and 2–8) had to undergo anterior
and posterior capsulectomy, together with vitrec-
tomy to release vitreoretinal adhesion, 2 weeks
after the initial surgery.
The implanted films were at stable position in
subretinal space (Fig. 2) of all monkeys, except for
one monkey (No. 2–1) which showed apparent relo-
cation of the film in the subretinal space between
Day 25 and Day 81 after film implantation (Fig. 3).
On Day 133, dye-coupled films were removed by
vitrectomy in three monkeys (No. 2–6, 2–7, 2–8) to
prove the feasibility and safety of film-removing
surgical techniques (Fig. 4). The three removed
dye-coupled films which had been implanted for 5
months were submitted for spectrophotometric and
Kelvin probe surface potential measurements, as
described below.
Optical coherence tomography
All monkeys for 1-month and 6-month observa-
tion showed that the neuroretina was attached
closely to the dye-coupled films throughout the
course of observation (Figs. 2–4). The film was not
visualized by optical coherence tomography in one

 monkey (No. 1–2), and was later confirmed by
pathological examinations to be located in the cho-
roid (Fig. 5). The films were located not in the mac-
ular degenerative areas, but in the superior part of
the normal retina of two monkeys, one each in the
1-month study (No. 1–1) and in the 6-month study
(No. 2–3). Space with fluid was detected on the
choroidal side of dye-coupled films in two of six
monkeys for the 1-month observation and in four
of eight monkeys for the 6-month observation. In
6-month study, one monkey (No. 2–2) developed
the temporary fluid on Day 148 and another mon-
key (No. 2–3) developed the fluid on Day 130
which continued on Day 165. The other two mon-
keys (No. 2–7, 2–8) had the persistent fluid on Day
25, Day 81, and Day 130, and the fluid disappeared
on Day 148 and Day 165 after the film removal.
Electroretinography
Full-field
electroretinography
was
performed
only from Day 81 in eight monkeys for 6-month
observation to assess retinal toxicity caused by film
implantation. Amplitudes of a-wave and b-wave of
full-field
electroretinography
were
maintained
throughout the course (Fig. 6), indicative of no reti-
nal toxicity. Focal electroretinography at the degen-
eration site only was planned initially in 1-month
study and 6-month study. In the 1-month study,
apparent waves were not recorded by focal electro-
retinography in macular degenerative areas with
film implantation (Fig. 6). The aim of focal electro-
retinography was changed from the assessment of
efficacy to the assessment of safety for film implan-
tation in the 6-month study. Focal electroretinogra-
phy was recorded in the degenerative macular area

nal area on the nasal side of the fundus in the 6-
month
study.
All
monkeys
showed
positive
response of focal electroretinography in the normal
retinal area on the nasal side of the fundus, indica-
tive of no retinal toxicity.
Visual evoked potential
The P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes were signifi-
cantly larger at 1 month after film implantation
both in the 1-month study and in the 6-month
study, compared with the amplitudes before film
implantation (P < 0.05, paired t-test, Fig. 7b,c). In

 6-month study (Fig. 7c), the P1-N1 and N1-P2 ampli-
tudes were larger, although not significantly, 6
months after film implantation, compared with the
amplitudes before film implantation. The right eye/
left eye ratios for the P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes
changed significantly in the time course of 1 month
and 6 months in 1-month study and in 6-month
study,
respectively
(P 5 0.0002
and
P < 0.0001,
repeat-measure ANOVA). In other words, the right
eye/left eye ratios for the P1-N1 and N1-P2 ampli-
tudes which dropped at the development of macular
degeneration were returned to and maintained at
the value of 100% in the follow-up of 6 months.
Pathology
In six monkeys for 1-month observation, all films
were located in the subretinal space between the
neural retina and choroid, except for one monkey
(No. 1–2) which had the film implanted in the cho-
roid (Fig. 5b). This monkey corresponded to one
with no detection of the film by optical coherence
tomography (Fig. 5a). A few multinucleated giant
cells, derived probably from retinal pigment epithe-
lial cells, were found around the film (Fig. 5b). The
inner layer of the neural retina showed structural
integrity at the site of film implantation. No inflam-
matory cells were found in the choroid and retina.
In five monkeys for 6-month continuous film
implantation
in
6-month
study,
all
films
were
located in the subretinal space between the neural
retina and choroid (Figs. 2c, 3c, and 4c). A few
multinucleated giant cells, derived probably from
retinal pigment epithelial cells, were found around
the film. The inner layer of the neural retina

 showed structural integrity at the site of film
implantation even after 6 months. Three monkeys
with film removal at 5 months, followed by further
1-month observation in 6-month study, showed sub-
retinal osseous metaplasia (Fig. 4c) in the areas
where the films had been implanted.
Absorbance and light-evoked surface potential
Three pieces of dye-coupled films which had
been implanted for 133 days in three monkey eyes
and removed by vitrectomy were assessed by spec-
trophotometric absorbance and Kelvin probe meas-
urements of light-evoked surface electric potentials.
The absorbance at 508 nm of the films removed
from monkeys (No. 2–6, No. 2–7, and No. 2–8) was
0.03205, 0.02156, and 0.02926, respectively (Fig. 8).
The percentage against the nonimplanted same lot
with the absorbance of 0.07905 was 40.5%, 27.3%,
and 37.0%, respectively. In Kelvin probe measure-
ments, all three implanted films showed propor-
tional
increase
of
light-evoked
surface
electric
potential in response to increasing light intensity
(Fig. 8). Potential values at light intensity of 2500
arbitrary units (which roughly equals to 300 lux)
were 25.3 mV (66% against 38.4 mV of the nonim-
planted same lot), 28.1 mV (73%), and 23.9 mV
(62%) for the implanted films from monkeys No.
2–6, No. 2–7, and No. 2–8, respectively. Potential
values at light intensity of 5000 arbitrary units were
232.7 mV (67% against 345.2 mV of the nonim-
planted same lot), 184.2 mV (53%), and 205.7 mV
(60%), respectively.
DISCUSSION
Cobalt chloride-induced macular degeneration in
monkeys has been developed as a primate model
for age-related macular degeneration (29). Age-
related macular degeneration is classified as outer
retinal degeneration in the macular area, secondary
to retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction, often
coupled with abnormal vessel formation (neovascu-
larization) from choroidal vasculature. The destruc-
tion of outer retinal layer with photoreceptor cell
loss in the macular area leads to reduced ampli-
tudes of visual evoked potentials as the macular
area sends a largest number of nerve fibers to the
brain. Indeed, visual evoked potentials in monkeys
were reduced in amplitudes after the development
of macular degeneration which extended to the
mid-peripheral retina on the temporal side of the
fundus. As the temporal retina, including the macu-
lar area, sends uncrossed nerve fibers to the right
visual cortex in monkeys, visual evoked potential
recordings on the right side of the brain were used
as the response to photic stimulation in the right
eye.
In this study, we showed surgical feasibility to
implant or remove the dye-coupled films by vitrec-
tomy. Optical coherence tomography, as a noninva-
sive clinical examination, confirmed the attachment
of dye-coupled films to the neural retina through-
out the course. Pathological examinations after the
sacrifice of animals revealed the absence of inflam-
mation and structural integrity of the inner retinal
layer which was in close contact with the dye-
coupled films for 6 months. Full-field electroretino-
graphic response in the entire retina and focal elec-
troretinographic response in the normal retinal
area on the nasal side of the fundus for 6 months
provide additional data for no toxicity to the retinal
tissue on a physiological basis.
As for the efficacy, the amplitudes of visual
evoked potentials increased significantly at 1 month
after the dye-coupled film implantation both in
pilot 1-month observation study and in pivotal 6-
month
observation
study.
The
amplitudes
also
showed increase, although not significant, at 6
months after the film implantation. It should be
noted that the right eye/left eye ratios for the P1-
N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes were kept at the value of
100% throughout the follow-up after the ratios

dye-coupled film implantation. Focal ERG is extinguished after the induction of macular degeneration (Day 25) and also not detected
at 1 month of film (white arrow in optical coherence tomography in a) implantation (Day 40). In contrast, reduced VEP amplitude at
Day 25 becomes larger at 1 month of film implantation (Day 39). Channel 1 (Ch 1) and Channel 2 (Ch 2) correspond to the right and
left visual cortex recordings, respectively, in photic stimuli to the right eye. (b) Focal ERG, flash VEP
, and full-field ERG in the right eye
of Monkey No. 2–2 with 6-month dye-coupled film (white arrows in optical coherence tomography) implantation. Focal ERG is noted
before the induction of macular degeneration (Day 216), extinguished after the development of macular degeneration (Day 25) and
also not detected throughout the 6-month course until Day 165. In contrast, reduced VEP amplitude on Day 25 becomes larger at 1
month and 6 months of film implantation (Day 26 and Day 166). Full-field ERG which was scheduled to measure only from Day 82
shows normal waves throughout the course (n.d., not determined). Right eye recordings (black lines) of VEP are from the right visual
cortex (Channel 1) in response to right eye photic stimuli while left eye recordings (green lines) are from the left visual cortex (Channel
2) in response to left eye stimuli. Vertical line (amplitude) and horizontal line (time) are 1 lV and 20 msec in focal ERG, 10 lV and 50
msec in flash VEP
, and 100 lV and 50 msec in full-field ERG, respectively. Note that space between film and retinal pigment epithelium
appears temporarily on Day 148 in optical coherence tomography.

ular degeneration become larger after film implantation (*P < 0.05, paired t-test). The left eyes had no intervention and served as con-
trols. Note that amplitudes (Pre 2) are reduced by the development of macular degeneration, compared with amplitudes (Pre 1) before
the induction of macular degeneration in 6-month study. The right eye/left eye ratios for P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes in 1-month study
and 6-month study (bottom graphs) change significantly in the time course of 1 month and 6 months, respectively (P 5 0.0002 and

 dropped in the induction of macular degeneration.
These facts indicate that photic stimuli to the
degenerative right eye resulted in the same level of
amplitudes as photic stimuli to the normal left eye.
In humans and monkeys, the amplitude and
latency of visual evoked potentials vary largely
from individual to individual and also are influ-
enced greatly by anesthetic levels. In this study,
visual evoked potentials were, of course, recorded
in monkeys under general anesthesia, and thus, the
recordings would have intrinsic limitations in their
interpretation. In monkeys, head skin moves well in
relation with the skull, and thus, plate electrodes
on the skin surface for visual evoked potential
recording would not be positioned exactly at the
same place at several time points of recording.
These limitations would explain variable ampli-
tudes of visual evoked potential in monkeys. Under
the circumstances, the right eye/left eye ratios for
visual evoked potential amplitudes were used to
assess the response in this study.
In the present study, monkeys were used because
they have macular structure of the retina. We did
not adopt cranial-fixed electrodes for visual evoked
potential recording from the viewpoint of animal
welfare. We induced macular degeneration and
implanted the dye-coupled films only in the right
eye, mainly due to consideration for animal wel-
fare. The macular degeneration in the right eye
induced
by
cobalt
chloride
injection
usually
extended to the mid-peripheral retina on the tem-
poral side in one quadrant of the fundus. Under the
circumstances, the monkeys maintained the visual
field corresponding to the remaining three quad-
rants of the fundus. Thus, we did not plan a behav-
ioral test in the present study.
Recently, government authorities, such as Phar-
maceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)
in Japan, tend to require monkey studies for safety
tests of novel pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
The present study was indeed designed to answer
questions, raised by PMDA, for long-term surgical
safety of the dye-coupled films. We basically advise
against using nonhuman primates only for surgical
implantation
studies.
Porcine
or
feline
models
would give just as much information in terms of
histopathology
if
behavioral
results
are
not
required. We, therefore, designed the present study
also to test visual evoked potential as part of effi-
cacy tests, after we had finished implantation stud-
ies in dogs (25) and rabbits (31).
It should be noted that three sheets of dye-
coupled films which had been implanted for 5
months showed decreases in absorbance to 35% as
a mean, compared with the nonimplanted same lot.
In contrast, light-evoked surface electric potential
on the 5-month implanted films maintained a 67%
level as a mean, compared with the nonimplanted
same lot. This discrepancy between the absorbance
and light-evoked surface electric potential would be
explained by the presence of noncovalently-bound
dye
molecules
on
the
film
surface.
These
noncovalently-bound dye molecules, which are only
attached to the film surface by ionic binding, would
leave the film surface during the period of implan-
tation. The noncovalently-bound dye molecules
do contribute to the absorbance of the film but do
not
contribute
to
light-evoked
surface
electric
potential (31).
In general, retinal prostheses are largely classi-
fied into epiretinal stimulation and subretinal stim-
ulation,
based
on
epiretinal
or
subretinal
positioning of the devices. In recent trends, subreti-
nal implants with different kinds of modalities are
emerging as subretinal stimulation can be directed
not only to retinal ganglion cells but also to remain-
ing bipolar cells (10,11). The photoelectric dye-
coupled polyethylene film is unique in that the
structure is simple and thus would escape mechani-
cal failure. In the present study, levels of light-
evoked surface electric potential of the 5-month
implanted dye-coupled films were reduced to about
two thirds of the nonimplanted same lot. The func-
tional durability of the dye-coupled films remains
to be determined in years after the subretinal
implantation.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study confirmed the safety and effi-
cacy of the photoelectric dye-coupled polyethylene
film as a retinal prosthesis in a monkey model of
age-related
macular
degeneration.
The
present
results could be also applicable in the treatment of
retinitis pigmentosa, as retinitis pigmentosa shares
the loss of photoreceptor cells with age-related
macular degeneration as a common pathological
background. The dye-coupled films would be dura-
ble at least for 6 months. All biological safety tests
for medical devices have been completed to prove
no toxicity for the dye-coupled film (data not
shown). The photoelectric dye in itself was also
proven to have no biological toxicity (data not
shown). The filing of a first-in-human clinical trial
for OUReP in patients who have lost vision by reti-
nitis pigmentosa is now negotiated at Pharmaceuti-
cals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in

APPENDIX FOR DETAILED METHODS IN
SURGERIES AND EXAMINATIONS
COBALT CHLORIDE INJECTION
Monkeys were anesthetized with intramuscular
injection of medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg of body
weight, Dormitor, Orion Pharma Animal Health,
Espoo, Finland), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg, Dormi-
cum, Astellas Pharma, Tokyo), and butorphanol
(0.4
mg/kg,
Betorphal,
Meiji
Seika
Pharma,
Tokyo). Instillation of 0.5% levofloxacin (0.5%
Cravit, Santen Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) and
1%
atropine
(Nitten
Pharmaceutical,
Nagoya,
Japan) was done once daily for 3 days before inter-
vention, and mydriasis was further obtained by
0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine eye
drops (Mydrin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical) on the
day of intervention. After instillation of 0.4% oxy-
buprocaine (Benoxil, Santen Pharmaceutical), the
bulbar conjunctiva was opened on the temporal
side, and the sclera was incised with a 20-gauge
knife (V-Lance Knife, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.,
Fort Worth, TX, USA). Cobalt chloride hexahy-
drate solution 30 lL (0.4 mg/mL, Nacalai tesque,
Kyoto) was injected to the subretinal space under
a surgical microscope with a fundus-viewing con-
tact lens placed on the cornea. The scleral incision
and the conjunctiva were sutured with 8-0 Vicryl
(polyglactin 910) suture (Ethicon, Johnson & John-
son, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Intramuscular ati-
pamezole (5 mg/mL, 0.02 mL/kg, Antisedan, Orion
Pharma Animal Health) were given to reverse
anesthesia. Monkeys received once daily instilla-
tion of 0.5% levofloxacine and 1% atropine, and
intramuscular injection of buprenorphine hydro-
chloride (0.2 mg/mL, 0.05 mL/kg, Lepetan, Otsuka
Pharmaceutical, Osaka) and dihydrostreptomycin
sulfate
procaine
benzylpenicillin
(0.05
mL/kg,
MycillinSol, Kyoritsu Pharmaceutical, Tokyo) for
3 days.
SURGICAL PROCEDURES
Before anesthesia, monkeys received intramuscu-
lar
injection
of
atropine
sulfate
(0.5
mg/mL,
0.02 mL/kg of body weight, Mitsubishi Tanabe
Pharma, Osaka, Japan) to suppress air way mucus
secretion, buprenorphine hydrochloride (Lepetan,
0.2 mg/mL, 0.05 mL/kg, Otsuka Pharmaceutical)
for
analgesia,
and
dihydrostreptomycin
sulfate
procaine
benzylpenicillin
mixture
(MycillinSol,
0.05 mL/kg, Kyoritsu Pharmaceutical) as antibiot-
ics. Monkeys were then sedated with intramuscular
ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg, 0.2 mL/kg,
Supriya Lifescience, Mumbai, India). After intuba-
tion, anesthesia was maintained with nitric oxide
gas
and
oxygen
(2:1
mixture)
with
isoflurane
(0.5–2.0%, DS Pharma Animal Health, Osaka).
Blood
pressure,
heart
rate,
electrocardiogram,
body temperature, and percutaneous oxygen satu-
ration were monitored with Animal Monitor Life
Scope (BSM-2391 or BSM-3592, Nihon Kohden,
Tokyo). Mydriasis in the right eye was induced by
0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine eye
drops (Mydrin-P) on the day of surgery.
After disinfection with 10% povidone iodine
(Negmin Solution, Pfizer Japan, Tokyo) on the
skin around the eye and then with 40-time saline-
diluted povidone iodine on the ocular surface, the
monkey’s head was positioned with the cornea
aligned in the horizontal plane, and covered with a
surgical
drape.
Topical
anesthesia
was
further
obtained with 4% lidocaine (Xylocaine Ophthalmic
Solution, AstraZeneka, London, UK). The surgery
was done under a surgical microscope (OPMI
VISU150, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Tokyo, Japan) with
an
ophthalmic
surgical
machine
(Constellation
Vision System, Alcon Laboratories). Anterior cap-
sulectomy (Fig. 1a) was done with a 25-gauge vit-
reous
cutter
under
irrigation
with
a
25-gauge
infusion cannula through two side ports which
were made at the corneal limbus with a 20-gauge
knife (V-Lance Knife, Alcon). Phacoemulsification
and aspiration of the lens in the capsular bag (Fig.
1b) was done through a 2.4 mm-wide corneal inci-
sion made on the superior side with a disposable
knife (Safety Knife, Kai Medical, Seki, Japan). The
corneal incision was sutured with 8-0 Vicryl suture.
Three 25-gauge trocars (Fig. 1c) were inserted into
the vitreous through the conjunctiva and sclera
2 mm from the corneal limbus in the superotempo-
ral and superonasal quadrant for instrument inser-
tion and in the inferotemporal quadrant to place
the infusion cannula.
The wide-field fundus was viewed with a 1128-
diopter front lens by Resight 500 fundus viewing
system (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Posterior capsulec-
tomy (Fig. 1c) and core vitrectomy was done. Reti-
nal
detachment
was
then
induced
by
infusing
irrigation solution (BSS-Plus Intraocular Irrigating
Solution, Alcon) into subretinal space with a 38-
gauge polyimide tip (PolyTip Cannula 25G/38G,

 attached to a 10-mL syringe for the viscous fluid
control (VFC) system at the setting of low intraoc-
ular pressure (Fig. 1d,e). A retinotomy was made
by
25-gauge
diathermy
(Grieshaber
Diathermy
Probe DSP 25Ga, Alcon) at the edge of retinal
detachment (Fig. 1f). The conjunctiva was opened,
3 mm-wide scleral incision was placed with a
microsurgery knife (Straight/Stab 22.58, Kai Medi-
cal), 2 mm posteriorly in parallel with the corneal
limbus
(Fig.
1g),
and
wound
hemostasis
was
accomplished with a wet-field hemostatic eraser
bipolar instrument (Beaver-Visitec International,
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). A sheet of the dye-
coupled film in 2.5 3 5 mm square size (Fig. 1h,i)
was grasped with a 20-gauge subretinal forceps
(Synergetics 39.21S, Bausch 1 Lomb Retina, St.
Louis, MO, USA), and inserted into the vitreous
(Fig. 1j) and then brought under the detached ret-
ina through a retinotomy (Fig. 1k). The scleral
incision for film insertion was sutured with 8-0
Vicryl suture (Fig. 1m). The subretinal fluid was
aspirated with a vitreous cutter, and the fluid in
vitreous cavity was exchanged with air to reattach
the retina (Fig. 1l). Laser photocoagulation (Fig.
1n) was applied around the retinal tear caused by
retinotomy,
and
30%
sulfur
hexafluoride
gas
(ISPAN, Alcon) with air was injected into vitreous
cavity from the infusion cannula. Trocars were
removed (Fig. 1o), and the conjunctiva was sutured
with 8-0 Vicryl suture (Fig. 1m).
At
surgery
to
remove
dye-coupled
films
implanted in the subretinal space, three 25-gauge
trocars were placed and retinal detachment was
induced by infusing irrigation fluid into the subreti-
nal space by a 38-gauge tip. A retinotomy was
made by diathermy and a subretinal dye-coupled
film was grasped with a 25-gauge forceps (Grie-
shaber
Revolution
DSP
25Ga
ILM
Forceps,
Alcon) and brought to vitreous cavity. The film
was brought out of the eye ball with a 25-gauge
forceps through a newly made 3-mm-wide scleral
incision 2 mm posterior to the corneal limbus. Ret-
inal
reattachment
was
obtained
by
fluid-air
exchange, laser photocoagulation, and gas injec-
tion. The films were immersed in distilled water
for material analyses. Microscopic surgical view
was recorded with a digital processor miniature

Co., Tokyo, Japan).
After the surgery, monkeys received intramuscu-
lar injection of dihydrostreptomycin sulfate pro-
caine benzylpenicillin (0.05 mL/kg, MycillinSol) for
3 days and intramuscular injection of ketoprofen
(2
mg/kg,
Capisten,
Kissei
Pharmaceutical,
Matsumoto, Japan) for 2 days. Postoperative instil-
lation of 0.5% levofloxacin (Cravit), 0.1% betame-
thasone
(Rinderon,
Shionogi
&
Co.,
Osaka,
Japan), and 1% atropine (Nitten) three times daily
were continued for postoperative one month.
ELECTRORETINOGRAPHY AND VISUAL
EVOKED POTENTIAL
Monkeys were sedated with intramuscular injec-
tion of a 7:1 mixture (0.2 mL/kg of body weight)
of ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/mL) and xyla-
sine
(20
mg/mL,
Celactal
2%,
Bayer
Animal
Health, Tokyo, Japan). Mydriasis was induced with
0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine eye
drops
(Mydrin-P),
and
dark
adaptation
was
obtained for at least 40 min. After ocular surface
anesthesia with 0.4% bupivacaine eye drops, a 13-
mm-diameter contact lens (base curve 6.0) with
ring electrodes for recording and reference (Kyoto
Contact Lens, Kyoto) was placed on the corneal
surface with hydroxyethylcellulose gel (Scopisol,
Senju Pharmaceutical, Osaka). A needle electrode
for ground was placed on the parietal skin. Maxi-
mal response of full-field electroretinography to
standard flash (3.0 cd 3 sec/m2) was recorded with
PuREC (PC-100A, Mayo Corporation, Inazawa
City, Japan) and SG-2002 Stand-Alone Ganzfeld
System (LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA).
Focal electroretinography at photopic condition
in the background of 1.5 cd/m2 was recorded with
the same contact lens electrode (Kyoto Contact
Lens),

15-degree
circular
light
stimulus (30 cd/m2, 5 Hz, 100 msec) in macular
degenerative

film
was placed, and also in the normal retinal area
on the nasal side of the fundus (Kowa ER-80,
Kowa,

Corporation).
Visual
evoked
potential
was
measured
by
PuREC (PC-100A Mayo) with plate electrodes
placed on the right upper and left upper side of
the occipital nodule, in combination with subcuta-
neous needle electrodes placed on the frontal cen-
ter for reference, and on the parietal center for
ground. After dark adaptation and mydriasis for at
least 15 min, flash light stimuli in the intensity of
3.082 cd 3 sec/m2 at the frequency of 60 Hz were
given by SG-2002 Stand-Alone Ganzfeld System
(LKC Technologies) to the right eye and then to
the left eye. The amplitude and latency of P1 N1,

ULTRASONOGRAPHY AND OPTICAL
COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY
Under anesthesia with intramuscular ketamine
and xylasine, the presence or the absence of retinal
detachment was screened by ultrasonography (SSD-
ALPHA7,
Hitachi-Aloka
Medical,
Tokyo).
The
anterior segments were observed by portable slit-
lamp biomicroscopy (SL-15, Kowa), and the fundus
examination was done with binocular funduscopy
(IO-alpha Small Pupil, Neitz Instruments, Tokyo).
The images of horizontal retinal sections in macular
degenerative area where the dye-coupled film was
implanted
were
obtained
by
optical
coherence
tomography (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT, Heidel-
berg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).
