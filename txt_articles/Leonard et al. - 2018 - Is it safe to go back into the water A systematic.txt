Abstract
Background: Numerous illnesses are associated with bathing in natural waters, although
it is assumed that the risk of illness among bathers exposed to relatively clean waters
found in high-income countries is negligible. A systematic review was carried out to
quantify the increased risk of experiencing a range of adverse health outcomes among
bathers exposed to coastal water compared with non-bathers.
Methods: In all 6919 potentially relevant titles and abstracts were screened, and from
these 40 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Odds ratios (OR) were extracted
from 19 of these reports and combined in random-effect meta-analyses for the following
adverse health outcomes: incident cases of any illness, ear infections, gastrointestinal
illness and infections caused by specific microorganisms.
Results: There is an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of any illness [OR ¼ 1.86,
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 2.64, P ¼ 0.001] and ear ailments (OR ¼ 2.05, 95% CI:
1.49 to 2.82, P < 0.001) in bathers compared with non-bathers. There is also an increased
risk of experiencing gastrointestinal ailments (OR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.49, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: This is the first systematic review to evaluate evidence on the increased
risk of acquiring illnesses from bathing in seawater compared with non-bathers. Our
results support the notion that infections are acquired from bathing in coastal waters,
and that bathers have a greater risk of experiencing a variety of illnesses compared with
non-bathers.
Key words: Bathing beaches, saline waters, waterborne diseases, sports

 Introduction
The association between bathing in recreational waters
and the risk of illness has been the subject of many epi-
demiological studies since the 1950s.1 A large number of
these investigations report that exposure to water contami-
nated with faecal material increases a person’s risk of ill-
ness, particularly symptoms of gastrointestinal illness.1,2
However, not all studies report such results,3 and the evi-
dence that bathing increases a person’s risk of illness is still
uncertain. There is a perception among policy-makers in
high-income countries that the risk of ill health associated
with bathing is negligible, since many high-income coun-
tries report high rates of compliance with bathing water
quality regulations.4–6
To develop evidence-based guidelines for ‘safe’ bathing
waters where bathers have a low risk of becoming ill,
many studies have examined the relationship between the
density of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in natural
waters and the risk of illness in bathers.1 In 2003, a system-
atic review and meta-analysis of 27 epidemiological studies
demonstrated that the FIOs, Escherichia coli and entero-
cocci, were more correlated with the risk of gastrointes-
tinal illness in bathers after exposure to natural waters
compared with other
FIOs
that had been
studied.2
Recently, a meta-analysis by Arnold et al. (2016) con-
firmed that elevated levels of enterococcus were associated
with an increased risk of diarrhoea among children.7
Many countries regularly monitor bathing waters for
these FIOs to ensure that levels of faecal contamination are
not high enough to pose an excess risk to bather health, as
recommended
by
the
World
Health
Organization.6
However, the cost of this activity restricts the agencies re-
sponsible for monitoring bathing waters to testing samples
taken from a limited number of bathing waters during peri-
ods of high use (commonly called ‘the bathing season’).8
Due to the large spatial and temporal fluctuations in FIO
densities that occur in natural waters, weekly measure-
ments are unlikely to capture high levels of faecal pollution
that occur in between samples.6,9 A number of recent
studies have reported that even in bathing waters that were
considered to be of good quality (containing low levels
of FIOs), bathers were still at an increased risk of experienc-
ing gastrointestinal illness, along with respiratory infec-
tions and ear and eye ailments.10–12 Therefore, it is useful
to know what risk of illness people face when they
bathe in natural waters, regardless of the timing or levels of
FIOs.
Current methods of assessing bathing water quality
thresholds are limited to an evidence base which has
largely focused on gastrointestinal illnesses among bathers.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most commonly investi-
gated adverse health outcome in epidemiological studies
conducted, but bathing in natural waters has been reported
to be associated with other illnesses and indicators of infec-
tion, including respiratory infections, skin ailments, eye in-
fections and ear infections.1,6,13,14 Furthermore, bathing is
an umbrella term for swimming or spending time in the
water, encompassing many different activities. Individuals
who enjoy high-exposure activities, such as surfing, may be
at greater risk of acquiring an infection, since they usually
have a greater number of unexpected head immersions and
ingest more water.6,15
In this systematic review, the aim was to gather, ap-
praise and synthesize the evidence to answer the following
research questions.
i. Do bathers have an increased risk of experiencing
symptoms of infections following recreational use of
coastal water, compared with non-bathers?
ii. Does the level of increased risk depend on the nature of
exposure to the water?
Having good quality evidence on the risks of infection
from using coastal waters for recreation is important for
communicating to the public the variety of illnesses they
might experience after bathing, and whether certain behav-
iours (such as doing water sports involving head immer-
sion) alter the risk of experiencing symptoms of ill health.
Understanding these risks will allow members of the public
to make informed decisions about their bathing habits in
coastal waters.
Methods
In August 2013 a protocol was registered with the Prospero
database (registration number CRD42013005307). The
characteristics of the studies (PECO, see below) to be
included in the review were defined and used to develop the
search strategy and selection criteria.
Key Messages
• Data from 19 studies were included in the meta-analyses.
• In high-income countries, bathers are at an increased risk of reporting a variety of illnesses compared with non-bathers.
• Head immersion has little effect on the risk to bathers of reporting illnesses.

 Inclusion criteria
The review included the following.
Populations (P). These comprise studies investigating
healthy human subjects.
Exposures (E). These comprise any recreational activity
done in or on water, involving contact with natural
waters. Natural waters are considered to be bodies of
water that are not disinfected, like the sea and lakes.
Comparators (C). The main comparator group in this re-
view are non-bathers (people who have not had contact
with natural waters). Comparator groups also considered
are water users exposed to unpolluted water bodies.
Outcomes (O). These include symptoms of infections
likely to be have been caused by infectious microorgan-
isms present in natural waters, particularly sewage-
associated microorganisms. Symptoms are not restricted
to those related to gastrointestinal illnesses and respira-
tory, skin, eye and ear infections. Additionally, we con-
sider papers reporting other indicators of infection such
as observing infective organisms in stool samples and
detecting antibodies against infective agents (serology).
Studies were restricted according to the selection criteria
(Table S1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Briefly, only studies published in English after 1961 were
included. Study designs included were limited to observa-
tional epidemiological studies and randomized exposure
trials, where the health outcome(s) under investigation had
been reported in a suitable comparator group. Studies that
were conducted in countries that were not members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD)16 were excluded, as were studies that did not
investigate health outcomes related to microbial pollution
of natural waters.
Information sources
The search strategy aimed to identify published and un-
published literature. This involved using Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms to search databases,
hand-searching pertinent journals, asking an expert in the
field to suggest articles that might have been missed, look-
ing for unpublished articles and forward- and reverse-
citation chasing. Each of these approaches is described in
more detail below.
In July 2013, six databases (Table S2, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online) were searched for art-
icles. Two of these, BIOSIS and MEDLINE, were searched
again in June 2015. The search strategy developed for use
in MEDLINE (Table S3) was modified for use in the other
databases. In July 2013, the peer-reviewed journal ‘Water
Quality, Exposure and Health was hand-searched for suit-
able articles. This journal was chosen for hand-searching
because in 2009 it published a systematic review on skin
ailments after recreational exposure to natural waters14
and was not indexed by any of the databases searched.
Results of unpublished studies were also included in the
review, and a variety of information sources providing un-
published results of studies were incorporated into the
search strategy to combat publication bias:17 In July 2013,
Dr Nick Ashbolt, a scientist who has published studies on
the topic of water quality and human health, was contacted
and asked for a list of key papers. Additionally, in August
2013, the websites of 11 environment and health authorities
(see Table S4, available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line) were searched using the phrases ‘bathing water quality’
and ‘human health’. Results were sorted by relevance and
the first 50 hits were evaluated for their suitability for the re-
view. The web-based search engine [www.google.com] was
used in a similar way to identify additional studies. Finally,
the reference lists of identified reports and reviews were
searched (reverse-citation chasing), along with the list of
papers that had cited included studies (forward-citation
chasing) to identify further relevant papers.
Study selection
After removing duplicate records, selection criteria were
used to screen titles and abstracts for inclusion in the re-
view. Independent double-screening was shared among
four members of the review team (A.L., R.G., A.S. and
W.G.). Disagreements about which records should be
retrieved for full-text review were discussed, and if a deci-
sion could not be reached, the record was discussed by all
members of the review team.
Full texts for the records identified in the first round of
screening were obtained and screened using these same se-
lection criteria. Independent double-screening was shared
among four members of the review team (A.L., R.G., A.S.
and W.G.). Any discrepancies were discussed, and if a deci-
sion could not be reached the record was discussed by all
members of the team.
Data extraction and quality appraisal
Data extraction forms for four different study designs were
drafted and piloted on a selection of different study designs:
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, cross-
sectional studies and case-control studies (Table S5, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online). The following
data were extracted, where available, from each record:
description of the study: the study location, year(s) of
study, study design and sample size;
study population: eligibility criteria and methods of
recruitment;

 exposure assessment: the recreational exposure and
how this was defined and assessed, and the comparator
groups’ exposure and how this was defined and
assessed;
outcome assessment: the health outcomes investigated
in the study, how this information was collected, and
how these outcomes were diagnosed.
The numbers of cases among exposed and unexposed indi-
viduals were extracted, or were calculated if enough data
were provided. This information was used to calculate an
odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
using STATA statistical analysis software.18 If fewer than
one case or control was reported in the exposed or unex-
posed group, 0.5 was added to each cell of the 2-by-2 table
to estimate crude ORs and 95% CI.19 If reported, adjusted
ORs and 95% CI were also extracted.
If articles had not provided enough information to ad-
equately appraise the quality of the study, authors of the
reports were contacted in order to get additional informa-
tion about their investigation. Final and technical reports,
as well as results from pilot studies, were obtained where
possible and used to fill in information where it was miss-
ing or unclear in published records.
Each study was assessed for quality and sources of bias
using a relevant version of the Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (CASP) tool. Studies were recorded as being of
good quality (the design and methods of the study were
sufficient to make the results reliable), moderate quality
(the design and methods of the study were sufficient to
make the results fairly reliable) or poor quality (the design
and methods of the study were insufficient to make the
results reliable). A quality appraisal tool interpretation in-
strument (Table S7, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online) was developed to ensure the same assessment crite-
ria were applied to all studies. Data extraction and quality
appraisal were conducted by one reviewer (A.L.) and were
double-checked by one of three members of the review
team (AS., R.G. and W.G.). Any disagreements were dis-
cussed and if a decision could not be made, the paper was
discussed as a team.
Data analysis
Given the scale of the evidence base and resource constraints,
the freshwater papers were not fully data-extracted or
quality-appraised, and have not been included in this review.
The results presented here focus on the risks of incident cases
of the following four health outcome categories among bath-
ers exposed to coastal waters compared with non-bathers
(beach-going non-bathers and people who had not been
to the beach): (i) cases of any illness; (ii) ear ailments;
(iii) gastrointestinal illness; and (iv) infections caused by
specific microorganisms. The selected outcome categories
were chosen after data extraction but before data analysis in
order to: (i) get a sensitive measure of the risk of illness by
meta-analysing the risk of experiencing any illness; (ii) inves-
tigate an outcome, ear ailments, for which there is intense
interest among water users but which has not been systemat-
ically reviewed before; (iii) compare these risks with an out-
come, gastrointestinal illness, that has been reviewed before;
and (iv) provide insight into some of the pathogens that
might be causing these symptoms. Data were synthesized in
order to answer the following research questions.
Do bathers have an increased risk of experiencing
symptoms of infections following recreational use of
coastal water, compared with non-bathers?
The OR comparing the risk of infection in bathers with the
risk of infection in non-bathers was pooled across studies.
If the adjusted OR was available, this were used in the
meta-analyses instead of the crude OR. Random-effects
meta-analyses were conducted using a single OR estimate
per included study.20 Two included studies estimated ef-
fects for separate subgroups (stratified analyses) but not an
overall effect. As the raw data in these papers were not
available, fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to combine
stratified results reported in a given paper into a single
overall estimate which was then subsequently pooled in the
main analyses with results from the other papers using ran-
dom-effects meta-analysis.21 For studies that stratified re-
sults by the extent of immersion in the water (for example,
any water contact, paddling, water up to the waist, head
immersion or swallowing water), the most inclusive defin-
ition was used (i.e. any water contact). Heterogeneity
among studies was quantified using the I-squared (I2) stat-
istic,22,23 and publication bias was assessed using funnel
plots. Meta-regression was used to investigate whether the
odds ratio for infection differed across three geographical
regions (Europe, North America and Oceania).
Does the level of increased risk depend on the nature of
exposure to the water?
Recreational exposures were categorized into two groups
based on how the authors defined exposure: (i) any water
contact, which was also considered to be exposures that
were not defined in the study, and those which encom-
passed many different exposures including getting the head
wet and not getting the head wet; and (ii) exposures where
bathers got their head or face wet. Whereas the meta-
analysis described above combined data from the most in-
clusive definitions of water contact (i.e. any water contact),
the impact of high levels of contact (head immersion) were
also assessed. The same methods as the first analysis were
used. The results of the head immersion meta-analyses are

 reported in the Supplementary material (available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Results
A total of 6919 titles and abstracts were screened for rele-
vance. Of the 285 selected for full text review, 148 were
excluded; 65 records for inclusion were put aside because
they reported the results of studies conducted in freshwater
environments (Table S9, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). This left 72 full texts pertaining to 40 separ-
ate studies for inclusion in the coastal water review
(Figure 1). A reference list of the articles reporting the 40
included studies is presented in Table S8 (available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Description of the included studies
Location. Nearly half of the all studies (19/40) included
in the coastal waters review were conducted in the
USA. Eight studies were in the UK, four in Australia,
two in New Zealand, two in Spain and one each
in
Denmark,
Greece,
Mexico,
Norway
and
Turkey
(Table 1).
Study size. The size of the 40 studies ranged from 25 sub-
jects to 26 686.
Study designs. Four major study designs were identified:
two RCTs, 25 cohort studies (24 prospective cohort and
one retrospective cohort), six cross-sectional studies and
seven case-control studies. Table 2 presents PECO descrip-
tions for each study, and these are summarized briefly here.
Populations. Nearly two-thirds of studies (25/40) recruited
beach-goers by approaching potential participants at the
beach. Four sourced participants from the local commun-
ity, three identified subjects from patients attending health
care facilities, three recruited participants at water sports
events and three recruited participants who self-identified
as being regular water users. The two studies investigating
outbreaks recruited holiday-makers who had visited the
same region. Twenty-four studies recruited both adults and
children, nine studies recruited adults only, four recruited
children only and three did not report this information.
Exposures. Definitions of bathing varied greatly among
the studies, from any kind of contact with seawater to
body immersion, head immersion and swallowing water.

 Six studies investigated people doing specific water sports,
including surfing, diving and rowing. The majority of stud-
ies (34/40) had participants self-report their exposure to
seawater during an interview with investigators or in a
questionnaire. The exceptions to this were: two RCTs
randomized
participants
into
bather
and
non-bather
groups, three studies recruited participants at water sports
events and one study had investigators observe the location
of bathers in the water.
Comparator groups. The comparator groups in 35 studies
were non-bathers. In 23 studies, these participants were
recruited at the beach, although in other studies non-
bathers were recruited from members of the community
who had not been to the beach, or who had not taken part
in a water sport event. The comparator groups in five of
the studies comprised bathers who had been exposed to
water with lower levels of pollution.
Outcomes. The outcome categories reported by each study
are presented in Table 1. The majority of studies (31/40)
relied upon participants self-reporting symptoms of illness.
This information was usually collected in a telephone inter-
view 3 to 15 days after exposure to seawater, although
people also reported symptoms in questionnaires or dia-
ries. Seven studies analysed specimens from subjects using
laboratory-based methods, and three studies had cases
diagnosed by health care professionals.
The quality of studies
The CASP tool was used to assess the presence of various
types of bias in the studies, such as misclassification bias.
The overall quality of a study was evaluated by posing the
question: ‘Are the results reliable?’, to which the answer
could be ‘yes’ (good quality), ‘partially’ (moderate quality)
or ‘no’ (poor quality). The overall quality of each study is
reported in Table 1. Few high quality studies were found,
and were found exclusively among the prospective cohort
studies and RCTs. Other study designs (cross-sectional and
case-control studies) were generally found to be of moder-
ate or poor quality.
The quality assessment tool also considered how well
each study was able to demonstrate a causal relationship
between exposure and the outcomes investigated. This was
based upon Hill’s considerations for causation.24 None of
the studies met all of the criteria, a major limitation among
all studies being lack of specificity (health outcomes spe-
cific to swimming in seawater or demonstrating that infec-
tious organisms are present in both the environment and
exposed individuals). One study analysed water samples
and human specimens (ear and throat swabs) for a variety
of bacteria to identify pathogenic organisms responsible
for the symptoms observed among bathers.25 However, the
authors were unable to identify specific pathogens in symp-
tomatic participants, and none of the studies succeeded in
identifying the microorganisms causing symptoms of ill
health as well as isolating the causal organisms from
seawater at the time of exposure.
Risk of illness or infection
Characteristics of the included studies have been summar-
ized as part of the quantitative synthesis for the four out-
comes: (i) any illness; (ii) ear ailments; (iii) gastrointestinal
illness; and (iv) infections caused by specific microorgan-
isms. Case definitions reported by studies included in the
meta-analysis have been provided in the Supplementary
materials (Table S10, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). Due to the size of the review, only the risks of
experiencing incident cases, as opposed to prevalent cases,
of these infections among bathers compared with non-
bathers were meta-analysed. Forest plots for each random-
effects analysis are available in the Supplementary material
(Figures S1 to S12, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). Additionally, the effects that head immersion spe-
cifically has on the risks of these infections were assessed,
and these results are presented in the Supplementary mate-
rial (Figures S11 to S18, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Estimates of association based on preva-
lence data were not pooled since any differences in the
occurrence of prevalent cases of illness between bathers
and non-bathers might not be due to exposure to coastal
waters.
Risk of experiencing symptoms of any illness
Ten studies reported the outcome ‘any illness’ (Table 1).
Four of these could not be included in this meta-analysis
because it was either not possible to obtain an OR and
95% CI from the data reported (Harrington 1993, Nelson
1997), or the comparator group were not non-bathers
(Dwight 2004, Fleming 2004). This left six studies that
were suitable for meta-analysis. The results show that
there is an increase in the risk to bathers of experiencing
any illness compared with non-bathers (OR ¼ 1.86,
95% CI: 1.31 to 2.64, P ¼ 0.001: Figure 2). Despite
considerable heterogeneity between the included studies
(I2 ¼ 91.8%), all the studies included in this analysis report
an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of any illness
compared with non-bathers (Figure S1). Meta-regression
findings indicated that there was little evidence to suggest
that the odds ratio differs across regional subgroups
(P ¼ 0.99) (Table S13, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online).

 Risk of experiencing ear ailments
A total of 21 studies reported on the risk of ear ailments
(Table 1). Eight studies could not be pooled in a meta-
analysis because the comparator group were not non-bathers
(Dwight 2004, Fleming 2004, Haile 1999, Yau 2014), or
prevalence was measured (Alexander 1992, Brown 1987,
Dwight 2004, Harding 2015). The nine remaining studies
reported data that were suitable for pooling.
Sensitive case definition. Among bathers there is an
increased risk of experiencing ear ailments compared with
non-bathers (OR ¼ 2.05, 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.82, P < 0.001:
Figure 2). The results reported by all studies were reasonably
consistent based on effect size, and heterogeneity was moder-
ate (I2 ¼ 41.6%: Figure S2).23 There was little evidence to
suggest that the odds ratio differs across regions (P ¼ 0.10)
(Table S13, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Single symptom case definitions. Bathers were at increased
risk of experiencing earache compared with non-bathers
(OR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.63, P ¼ 0.004: Figure 2).
The point estimates reported by all the included studies
were greater than one, with the exception of Colford 2005
(Figure S3), and the I2 value (66.5%) indicated moderate
heterogeneity. Conversely, there was little evidence of an
increase in the risk to bathers of experiencing ear discharge
(OR ¼ 1.16, 95% CI: 0.08 to 16.6, P ¼ 0.91: Figure 2).
Two studies were included in this analysis and the I2 value
indicates high heterogeneity (70.8%: Figure S4). There was
little evidence to suggest that differences in risk of earache
among bathers observed across regional subgroups was
due to region (P ¼ 0.31). There were too few studies to
conduct this analysis on ear discharge (Table S13).
Specific case definition. One study reported data for the
reporting of ear ailments which had a specific case definition
(Papastergiou 2011). This study reported an odds ratio of
8.6 (95% CI: 0.52 to 140.5, P ¼ 0.13), suggesting little evi-
dence of an association between bathing and ear ailments.
Case definition not reported. Five studies estimated the
risk of bathers experiencing undefined cases of ear ailments
compared with non-bathers (Figure S5).
Risk of reporting gastrointestinal illness
A total of 28 studies reported the risk of symptoms of gas-
trointestinal illness (Table 1). Nine of these could not be
included in the meta-analyses because the comparator
group were not non-bathers (Dwight 2004, Fleming 2004,
Haile 1999, Harder-Lauridsen 2013, Harding 2015),
prevalence was measured (Alexander 1992, Brown 1987,

 (Harrington 1993, Morens 1994). The 18 remaining stud-
ies reported data that were suitable for pooling.
Sensitive case definitions. There was an increased risk of
bathers experiencing gastrointestinal illness compared with
non-bathers (OR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.49, P < 0.001:
Figure 2). All but one of the pooled studies make the same
observation: bathers are at an increased risk of experiencing
gastrointestinal illness (Figure S6a). However, the results
reported in Bonilla 2007 are noticeably different from the
rest of the studies, reporting that bathers have a lower risk of
experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms compared with non-
bathers. This is most likely due to the comparator group
recruited in this study being members of the general popula-
tion who did not go to the beach, rather than (as is the case
with the other studies) being beach-goers who did not go in
the water. The comparator group in the Bonilla 2007 study
could consist of people with poorer health overall, experienc-
ing higher rates of illness than people who chose to go to the
beach. This could be responsible for the high heterogeneity
observed in this meta-analysis (I2 ¼ 77.4%). Removing
Bonilla 2007, as well as other studies where the comparator
group could include people who had not been to the beach
(Dale 2009 and Papastergiou 2011), from this meta-analysis
slightly increased the point estimate (OR ¼ 1.40, 95% CI:
1.29 to 1.52, P< 0.001), and reduced the heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 17.6%) (Figure S6b). There was little evidence that the
odds ratio differs across regions (P ¼ 0.19) (Table S13).
Single symptom case definitions. Compared with non-
bathers, bathers are at an increased risk of reporting
diarrhoea (OR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.63, P < 0.001:
Figure 2), and stomach ache (OR ¼ 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to
1.49, P ¼ 0.004: Figure 2). The results reported by all studies
for these two outcomes were reasonably consistent, in that
they generally report OR greater than one (Figures S7 and
S9). I2 values reported for these meta-analyses were low
( 21.3% and 21.1%). There was little evidence of an associa-
tion between sea bathing and the risk of experiencing nausea
(OR ¼ 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.23, P ¼ 0.85: Figure 2) or
vomiting (OR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.51, P ¼ 0.85:
Figure 2). I2 values reported for these meta-analyses were
low (7.7% for nausea) to moderate (56.6% for vomiting)
(Figures S8 and S10). There was little evidence to suggest
that differences in risk of diarrhoea, nausea, stomach ache or
vomiting among bathers observed across regional subgroups
were due to region (all P-values > 0.21) (Table S13).
Specific case definitions. There was no evidence of an asso-
ciation between sea bathing and the risk of experiencing
cases of gastrointestinal illnesses that require two or more
symptoms to be reported together (OR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI:
0.47 to 3.52, P ¼ 0.62: Figure 2). The results from the
studies included in this meta-analysis were inconsistent
based upon effect sizes (Figure S11), and statistical hetero-
geneity was moderate (I2 ¼ 47.6%). There was little evi-
dence to suggest that the odds ratios differ across regions
(Table S13).
Case definition not reported. Four studies reported the
odds ratios of bathers reporting undefined cases of gastro-
intestinal illness compared with non-bathers (Figure S12).

 Infections caused by specific microorganisms
The above results focused on the reporting of symptomatic
infections
without
identifying
the
causative
agent.
However, nine studies reported on the risks of infections
caused by specific microorganisms (Table 1), including
those caused by bacteria, viruses and protozoans (Table 3).
Due to the variety of infections reported, it was not sen-
sible to combine the results of any of these studies in a
meta-analysis. Instead, the quantitative results reported by
the individual papers are presented separately in a forest
plot (Figure 3). Point estimates for ORs were greater than
one (indicating an increase in risk), although the precision
of the ORs reported varied greatly. Two of these studies
reported a statistically significant increase in the odds of
acquiring bacterial infections among bathers compared
with non-bathers. These were staphylococcal skin infec-
tions (Charoenca 1995), and community-acquired (CA)
urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by the antibiotic-
resistant
bacteria,
extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumo-
niae (Soraas 2013).
Discussion
This is the first study that has systematically reviewed the
literature reporting on the association between recreational
exposure to coastal waters and the incidence of non-enteric
illnesses. Among bathers there is an increase in the risk of
experiencing any symptoms of illness (OR ¼ 1.86, 95% CI:
1.31 to 2.64, P ¼ 0.001) and ear ailments (OR ¼ 2.05,
95% CI: 1.49 to 2.82, P < 0.001), including symptoms like
earache (OR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.63, P ¼ 0.004). In
addition, the odds ratio of acquiring gastrointestinal
illness between bathers and non-bathers, which has been
systematically
reviewed
and
pooled
previously,
was
assessed. The results confirm that there is an increase in the
risk of experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms (OR ¼ 1.29,
95% CI: 1.12 to 1.49, P < 0.001), including diarrhoea
(OR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.63, P < 0.001) and stom-
ach ache (OR ¼ 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.49, P ¼ 0.004).
The risk of gastrointestinal illness among bathers has
received a lot of attention in the literature. Recently, a
meta-analysis has estimated the risk of gastroenteritis in
children reported by 13 cohort studies conducted in the
USA.7 Like our study, the Arnold paper indicates an
increased risk for diarrhoea among bathers compared with
non-bathers. In contrast, a recent rapid evidence assess-
ment of the epidemiological literature, conducted since
2003, reported that although most papers report an
increase in the odds of gastrointestinal illness among bath-
ers at marine beaches compared with non-bathers, there is
little evidence of a true difference.26 The most plausible
reason for the contradictory results of this review is that
the rapid evidence assessment conducted by King et al. was
limited to reviewing studies published in the previous 10
years (from 2003 to 2013), and a pooled estimate was not
produced as the authors considered their included studies
too heterogeneous to combine. In a sensitivity analysis,
studies conducted before 2006 were excluded from the
meta-analyses. This was done because one might assume
that water quality, as measured by FIOs, has improved
over the years to comply with water quality regulations,4
and therefore one might expect that the risk of illness
in recent years would be reduced since FIOs (such as
enterococci) are associated with increased risk of ill-
nesses.2,6,11,14,27 Pooling estimates only from studies con-
ducted since 2006 did not greatly reduce the risk estimates
for bathers experiencing ear ailments or gastrointestinal

 illnesses; the risk of ear ailments (including earache)
remained higher in bathers compared with non-bathers,
with small differences to the overall effect size (Table S12,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The risk of
experiencing gastrointestinal illness, including diarrhoea,
also remained elevated in bathers compared with non-
bathers (Table S12). However, after removing studies con-
ducted before 2006, the increase in the risk of stomach
ache was no longer statistically significant. While the
included studies reported similar effect sizes to studies con-
ducted before 2006, the small number of studies available
for this analysis meant that the confidence intervals around
the point estimates were wider. For the risk of nausea, no
association was found between bathing and this particular
outcome (OR ¼ 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.23, P ¼ 0.85).
Likewise, there was no association between bathing and
the incidence of vomiting (OR ¼ 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to
1.51, P ¼ 0.85).
This review also investigated the effect that head immer-
sion in seawater has upon the risk of experiencing illness. For
most of the outcomes investigated, there were only small
differences in the odds of reporting any of the illnesses investi-
gated by immersing heads in seawater, which did not alter the
interpretation of the results (Table S11). In the head immer-
sion meta-analyses, point estimates were increased for
any illness (OR ¼ 1.91, 95% CI: 1.40 to 2.60, P < 0.001:

(OR ¼ 1.37, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.72, P ¼ 0.006: Figure S17).
The OR point estimates were reduced for cases of ear ailments
(sensitive case definitions) (OR ¼ 1.79, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.72,
P ¼ 0.006: Figure S14), and earache (OR ¼ 1.64, 95% CI:
1.07 to 2.52, P ¼ 0.02: Figure S14). Regional analyses were
conducted to explore whether the odds ratios of the investi-
gated health outcomes are different across geographical
regions. The results indicated that there is little evidence of a
true difference in the risks of any of the various outcomes
investigated
across
regions
(Table
S13,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
This is also the first time that the literature reporting on
the association between infections caused by specific
microorganisms and sea bathing has been systematically
reviewed. All the included studies reported effect sizes
greater than one, although the precision of these risk esti-
mates varied greatly, with some of the 95% CIs reported
including a value of one (Figure 3). Although viruses, like
norovirus, are widely believed to be the most common
cause of gastrointestinal illness among bathers,3,28–30 none
of the studies included in this review assessed norovirus as
the causative agent of symptomatic illness. Among the
infections caused by specific microorganisms, the only
infections that were significantly increased in bathers com-
pared
with
non-bathers
were
caused
by
bacteria
(Charoenca 1995, Soraas 2013).
Most of the studies were limited by selection and con-
founding bias: beach-goers who elect to go into the sea
might comprise a different population of beach-goers to
those who choose to stay out of the sea (self-selection
bias), and people who volunteer in health studies might be
different from those who choose not to (volunteer bias).
Therefore, any observed health effects could be due to
some other, unmeasured factor, rather than exposure to
seawater (confounding bias).31 For these reasons, very few
of the studies were scored as being of good quality.
Differences in rates of attrition in the exposed and unex-
posed groups could be another source of bias in the
included studies, but this was rarely reported. The RCTs
go some way to reducing some of these biases. In a sepa-
rate set of meta-analyses, the effect estimates reported by
the RCTs were compared with those reported by observa-
tional studies. Observational studies reported smaller effect
sizes compared with the RCTs for all the outcomes investi-
gated (Table S14, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). Nevertheless, meta-analyses restricted to pooling
data from only observational studies produced similar
effect sizes and lead to the same conclusion being drawn:
that bathers are at a higher risk of experiencing symptoms
of illness compared with non-bathers.
Misclassification bias was another potential source of
bias identified in many of the studies. Most relied upon
participants to self-report their exposure and outcomes,
the accuracy of which may be influenced by interviewer
bias, recall bias and response bias.31 Many of the studies

 included in the meta-analyses conducted follow-up inter-
views several days after bathing (Table 2). Two of these
studies also conducted analyses to estimate the risk of ill-
ness in bathers 3 days after bathing.11,32 Using the risks of
illness experienced within 3 days of exposure in the rele-
vant meta-analyses increased the size of the effect estimate
slightly (Table S15, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). This is because the excess risk of illness is greatest
in the first few days after bathing, and the size of the effect
reduces as the risk period is extended further from the day
of exposure, during which time both bathers and non-
bathers might be exposed to other sources of pathogenic
microorganisms.
In our meta-analyses, data were combined from studies
regardless of the levels of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs)
or type of pollution to which bathers were likely to have
been exposed. Variations in FIOs (such as enterococci) and
exposure to different sources of pollution (like human fae-
cal contamination) might account for some of the hetero-
geneity observed in these meta-analyses, since the levels of
FIOs and the type of pollution impacting on coastal waters
are associated with the risk of illness in bathers.2,7,14,27,33
Another source of heterogeneity in the meta-analyses is
likely to be the age of the study participants. Young children
have been shown to be at greater risk of experiencing
gastrointestinal illnesses compared with adolescents and
adults.7 Whereas several included studies provided odds
ratios adjusted for confounders (like age and sex), few
report age-stratified effects and the ones that did used differ-
ent age categories, making it difficult to explore the extent
to which participants’ ages affected the effect sizes reported.
There are limitations inherent in this systematic review
that must be considered. First, our selection criteria for
studies excluded those conducted before 1961 and those
that were not published in English. One study identified by
our search was published before 1961, and three studies
were not written in English. Publication bias was assessed
using a funnel plot (Figure S19, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). There are few studies occupying the
southwest corner of the funnel plot, indicating an under-
representation of smaller studies reporting negative find-
ings. The potential for publication bias was anticipated,
therefore the search strategy was adapted to include
searches for grey literature, and there were no limits on the
size of the studies that could be included in the review.
One study included in the review was not reported in a
peer-reviewed journal (NJSDH 1988). Removing this study
from the relevant meta-analyses did not markedly alter the
odds ratio (Table S16, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). Moreover, studies that were conducted in
countries that were not members of the OECD were
excluded. This means that the results reported by this
systematic review are not applicable to coastal waters in
low- and middle-income countries, nor for landlocked
countries and states. The search strategy identified 65
freshwater studies (Table S9), which will be summarized in
a future systematic review.
Studies were excluded from the meta-analyses if they did
not report an odds ratio and 95% CI or sufficient raw data
for this summary statistic to be calculated. Therefore studies
reporting other relative effect measures (e.g. risk ratios)
were not included in the meta-analysis, as the necessary
statistics were not calculable if raw data were unavailable.
Conclusions
This is the first systematic review to evaluate the evidence
that bathers are at risk of getting sick from exposure to sea-
water, and to quantify this risk compared with non-
bathers. The findings indicate that bathers are at a higher
risk of experiencing a variety of symptoms of illness com-
pared with non-bathers, including ear ailments, gastroin-
testinal illness and symptoms of any illness. Recreational
exposure to coastal waters is likely to cause these illnesses,
although future epidemiological studies should aim to
identify the microorganisms responsible for observed
symptoms, to address the issue of specificity.
