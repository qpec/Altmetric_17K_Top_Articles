In Brief
Catania tests the dynamics of the
electrical circuit that develops when an
electric eel leaps to electrify a threat. Even
small eels use this strategy to direct the
majority of their electric current through a
target. Current levels and eel pulse rates
efficiently activate nociceptors, providing
a powerful deterrent to potential
predators.

SUMMARY
Electric eels have been the subject of investigation
and curiosity for centuries [1]. They use high voltage
to track [2] and control [3] prey, as well as to exhaust
prey by causing involuntary fatigue through remote
activation of prey muscles [4]. But their most aston-
ishing behavior is the leaping attack, during which
eels emerge from the water to directly electrify a
threat [5, 6]. This unique defense has reportedly
been used against both horses [7] and humans [8].
Yet the dynamics of the circuit that develops when
a living animal is contacted and the electrical power
transmitted to the target have not been directly
investigated. In this study, the electromotive force
and circuit resistances that develop during an eel’s
leaping behavior were determined. Next, the current
that passed through a human subject during the
attack was measured. The results allowed each var-
iable in the equivalent circuit to be estimated. Find-
ings can be extrapolated to a range of different eel
sizes that might be encountered in the wild. Despite
the comparatively small size of the eel used in this
study, electrical currents in the target peaked at
40–50 mA, greatly exceeding thresholds for noci-
ceptor activation reported for both humans [9] and
horses [10, 11]. No subjective sensation of involun-
tary tetanus was reported, and aversive sensations
were restricted to the affected limb. Results suggest
that the main purpose of the leaping attack is to
strongly deter potential eel predators by briefly
causing intense pain. Apparently a strong offense is
the eel’s best defense.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The first step in analyzing the circuit was to determine the
electromotive force (ε) and internal resistance (r) for the eel’s
summed electrocytes. For this study, a single relatively small
(40-cm-long) electric eel was used for all measurements. Mea-
surements from the eel are values taken from the peak of the
high-voltage discharge. Electromotive force and internal resis-
tance were determined using the same paradigm that is often
used for batteries and that has been previously used for electric
eels [12] and other electric fish [13, 14]. The method is illustrated
in Figure 1. The eel was raised from the water in a non-conduc-
tive net and contacted at the head and tail with conductive
gloves connected to wires. The wires led to a voltmeter and
ammeter, as well as to relays that were sequentially introduced
resistors into the circuit. Resistors had values of (approximately)
0 ohms, 200 ohms, 400 ohms, 800 ohms, 1,600 ohms, and
(lastly) open circuit conditions (each condition lasting 200 ms).
The resulting voltages and currents were simultaneously re-
corded (during the eel’s high-voltage discharges) for each condi-
tion and then plotted (Figure 1C). A straight line was obtained
(R squared 0.996, p < 0.0001). The y intercept in volts indicates
the electromotive force (ε), and the slope indicates the negative
of the internal resistance (r) for the summed electrocytes. The re-
sults show that the eel used in this study had an electromotive
force of 198 V and an internal resistance of 960 ohms.
The equivalent circuit that develops during the eel’s shocking
leap has recently been proposed [5] and investigated [6]. In wa-
ter, this circuit includes the electromotive force of the eel’s elec-
trocytes (ε), the internal resistance (r), and the water resistance
(Rw). The water resistance was recently measured and was esti-
mated to be approximately 400 ohms (for a 40 cm eel [6]) with
water conductivity of 100 mS at 25�C. When the eel emerges
from the water during a shocking leap, a new resistance de-
velops between the front pole of the animal and the main body
of water. As the eel ascends to greater heights, the resistance
of this return path from the head to the main body of water in-
creases. The voltage drop across this resistance, relative to eel
height, was measured using a split metal plate with one section
protruding above the water [6] and a separate section below the
water (Figure 1D). An insulator separated the plates, and voltage
was measured between the plates while high-speed video was
simultaneously recording at 1,000 frames per second. As the
eel ascended, potential increased to 127 V.
From the peak voltage recorded in the experiment above, the
range of the variable resistance for the return path to the water
can be estimated. The total voltage (ε) for this eel was 198 V.
Therefore, during the peak of the leap shown schematically in Fig-
ure 1D, the voltage drop across the summed internal resistance r
and water resistance Rw was 71 V (ε – 127 V). The current in the
circuit was then calculated as I = V/R or 71/1,360 = 0.0522 A.
The peak resistance for the return path from the head is therefore
estimated to be R = V/I or 127/0.0522 z 2,400 ohms.
Figure 1E illustrates the characteristics of the electric eel used
in this study during one of its shocking leaps (in water of 100 mS
conductivity at 25�C). The proposed circuit can be considered
an unloaded voltage divider. When the circuit is loaded by

 electrifying a target, an additional resistance is added in parallel
to the illustrated return path (Ro). Without knowing the value of
this added resistor in parallel with Ro, it is not possible to calcu-
late the total current in the circuit or the voltage drop at each
resistance when an eel electrifies a target.
So that the value of this resistance could be determined, an
apparatus was designed to measure current through the arm
of a human subject as the eel made shocking leaps (Figure 2A).
This apparatus consisted of a water-filled plastic chamber with a
handle. The posterior and bottom portion of the chamber were
covered with conductive aluminum tape such that no direct con-
tact could be made between hand and tape. This paradigm pre-
served the eel-arm interface and the hand-water interface that
normally exist. The chamber’s internal layer of conductive tape
was then connected, through insulated wire, to conductive
aluminum tape on the bottom and front of the plastic chamber
to complete the circuit. A hall-effect ammeter measured current
through the wire as the eel leapt on the subject’s arm (Figures
2B–2D; Movie S1). The trial in Figure 2 corresponds closely to
the behavior exhibited in the trial used to measure voltage
drop in the split-plate experiment and thus was used for analysis.
The peak current through the subject’s arm during this trial was
43 mA (Figure 2D).
From the peak current measured through the subject’s arm
at the top of the leap, combined with the estimation of an
approximately 2,400 ohms return path resistance along the
eel’s body at the top of the leap (Figures 1D and 1E), the target
resistance was determined to be approximately 2,100 ohms.
Figure 3 illustrates the complete circuit with corresponding
currents and resistances for the small eel and the human
arm used in this study. The values indicate that roughly
3.9 W of power was communicated to the arm during the
peak of each high voltage discharge. These values provide
a starting point for extrapolation to other eels, other target
animals, and variable water resistances that might be encoun-
tered in the Amazon.
A human subject’s arm was used in this study under the
premise that directly recording data was preferable to making
theoretical estimates of the complex interfaces between the
eel, the arm, and the water. Additionally, it is clear that humans
may be subjected to the eel’s defensive behavior (Figure 1).
For obvious reasons, a comparatively small electric eel was
used for these experiments. Despite its small size, the juvenile
eel was able to communicate 40–50 mA of current during each
leap. In the trial documented in Figure 2, the eel’s volley included
more than 20 pulses, imparting 40 mA, at a rate of roughly
175 Hz. Figure S1 illustrates additional trials with currents that
peaked closer to 50 mA.
Although 40–50 mA may not seem like much electrical current,
it is far above the levels usually used to study pain and reflexive
withdrawal reflexes. Most studies of withdrawal reflexes in hu-
mans stimulate with transcutaneous currents in the 5–10 mA
range [9]. Withdrawal reflexes of horse forelimbs can be elicited
with transcutaneous currents ranging from 1.7 to 5.5 mA [10, 11].
Likewise, in dogs, withdrawal reflexes are elicited with transcu-
taneous currents of 2–4 mA [15]. Moreover, trains of only five

 supra-threshold pulses are sufficient to elicit withdrawal reflexes
and nociceptor activation in humans [9, 16, 17], horses [10, 11],
dogs [15], and mice [18].
It is therefore not surprising that the subject reported that the
eel’s shocking leaps were strongly aversive. The subjective
report was that involuntary arm withdrawal occurred on every
trial during which a circuit was made by the eel (e.g., Movie
S1 and Figure S1). Although a reflexive response cannot be
confirmed without electromyogram (EMG) recordings and la-
tency measures, it would be unusual if the withdrawal reflex
had not been elicited. Greatly exceeding thresholds for the
withdrawal reflexes in diverse species provides a convenient
benchmark for rating the averseness of the eel’s attack, and
it is a testament to the potential effectiveness of the leaping
defense.
Despite the reported efficiency of nociceptor activation in the
present study, there was no subjective sensation of tetanus or
restricted movement. Although it is possible the hand muscles
were involuntarily activated, the biceps and shoulder were
mobile throughout the experiment. This can be contrasted with

the involuntary tetanus that occurs for
prey [3] and people immersed in water
(Figure 1) or when current from an electric
eel passes through the trunk [19]. The
eel used in this study invariably caused
tetanus in submerged prey (fish). The
lack of upper extremity tetanus in the
present investigation is consistent with
the more restricted, deeper, and proximal
distribution of motor efferents compared
to nociceptors. In one trial, the experi-
menter neglected to plug the leads from
the hand chamber into the ammeter to
complete the circuit. During this trial, the
eel’s discharges were completely unde-
tected by the subject, confirming that
the current path in this study was through
the chamber and that current does not flow through an un-
grounded target that does not complete the circuit to water.
Given the comparatively small size of the juvenile electric eel
used in this study, it is natural to wonder how the parameters
measured in this investigation might apply to larger specimens.
In a recent study, the electromotive force (EMF) and internal
resistance of four different electric eels were examined using
the methods described here [6]. The largest eel was 113 cm in
length and had an EMF of 382 V and an internal resistance of
450 ohms. A larger eel could easily reach an EMF of 500 V [12]
with a similar internal resistance. The return path resistance
from lower jaw to the water for a large eel has been measured
at over 5,000 ohms [6]. A human standing in water and contacted
on the trunk by the comparatively large surface area of a large
eel’s lower jaw would be expected to have a considerably lower
resistance (perhaps 1,000 ohms or less) than reported here. This
follows from the larger surface area of a large eel’s jaw, the much
larger conduction volume of the human trunk compared to an
arm, and the larger body-water interface that completes the cir-
cuit when a human stands in water. Electric eels in the Amazon

 have been found in water with a conductively of 95 mS/cm [20],
similar to the values used for the present experiments. With
these assumptions applied to the circuit in Figure 3, the human
target would experience a current of 0.25 A during each high-
voltage discharge for a peak power transfer of 63 W. This is
almost an order of magnitude greater than the 7.4 W imparted
by the pulses of a law-enforcement TASER [21]. Clearly, electric
eels can deliver substantial power directly to a threatening ani-
mal with this unique defensive behavior.
These findings raise a number of interesting questions for
future study. For example, the juvenile eel used in this investiga-
tion projected a larger proportion of its body from the water than
was observed for any of the large eels previously investigated
[5, 6]. Typical examples for the largest eel are illustrated in Fig-
ure S2, during which the eel ascends for only about a third of
its length. In contrast, the small eel often leapt to project almost
its entire body above the water. It is possible that small eels, with
greater internal resistance, shorter (absolute) leap heights, and
less electromotive force [6], must leap to greater relative heights
to divert sufficient current to their target. Alternately, any sized
eel might need to reach a minimum absolute height to divert
sufficient current to the target for deterrent effect. More study
of a range of specimens and targets might shed light on this
possibility. In addition, nothing is presently known about the
predominant predators that led to the evolution of this behavior.
It is possible that interposing fur or an epidermis of scales, typical
of mammalian or crocodilian predators, respectively, have sub-
stantially greater resistance than human skin. If so, this would
require the eel to reach greater heights to divert similar currents
to the target.
Finally, although electric eels have been the subject of hun-
dreds of years of ‘‘hands-on’’ study and there have been many
shocking encounters between humans and eels in South Amer-
ica, the author is unaware of any documented lethal encounters
from direct electrocution. Faraday famously conducted ‘‘hands-
on’’ experiments with electric eels with no reported ill effects [22].
Even Humboldt, who seemed to relish a good fish story [7],
attributed the death of two horses in 1800 to exhaustion followed
by drowning while trapped, rather than the direct result of electric
shock. On the other hand, the effect of tetanus while in water
would most likely pose a substantial danger; even an experi-
enced swimmer might drown. An account from the 1600s
describes a fisherman who was paralyzed by an eel and rescued
by boat just before drowning [1]. This is presumably why, in
Figure 1, the fisherman’s comrades had him tied to a rope, obvi-
ously a wise precaution.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by Vanderbilt’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All human
procedures were reviewed by Vanderbilt University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and permission for procedures was given
under IRB # 162051. The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) was a single 40 cm length specimen of unknown sex. The human
subject was a single male individual 51 years of age.
METHOD DETAILS
A single 40 cm length electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) was used for this study. It was housed in a custom-made Plexiglas aquar-
ium with aerated water, gravel bottom, plastic imitation branches and plants and fed earthworms and fish. Temperature was between
24 and 26�C and pH between 6.5 and 7.0, conductivity between 100-200 mS/cm on a 12/12 light-dark cycle. To record voltage and
current from the eel, it was lifted in a non-conductive net, and contacted at the head and tail with silver-thread conductive therapy
gloves (Conductive Therapy Shop) worn over rubber gloves. The conductive gloves were connected to 16 gage, braided copper
speaker wire to five relays controlled by a Master 8 stimulator (A.M.P.I Jerusalem, Israel) that sequentially activate the relays at
200 ms intervals (including 200 ms with no relay activated giving 6 conditions). The relays sequentially cycle through; open circuit,
then approximately 1600 ohms, 800 ohms, 400 ohms, 200 ohms, and zero ohms. Voltage and current were simultaneously
measured. The resistors were 5 W, 200 ohms ceramic resistors ± 5% accuracy that were added together by the relays to produce
the values listed above during the experiment. Voltage was recorded with both a PowerLab 8/35 data acquisition unit (ADInstru-
ments) through a P4100 100:1 probe (Sainsmart, Lenexa Kansas) using LabChart software (version 7, ADInstruments) and with a
Tektronix TBS 2000 digital oscilloscope through a tuned TPP0100, 10x attenuating probe. Current was measured with a Model
H1-ACDC-72 (hall effect) current sensor (BDW Enterprises). A known calibrating current (measured by a Fluke 115 True RMS
multimeter) was passed through the current sensor and recorded prior to every trial. For all experiments in water, conductivity
was 100 microseimens/cm (measured with a calibrated Ohaus Starter 300C conductivity meter accurate to ± 0.5%, Ohuas

 corporation, Parippany, NJ) and water temperature was 25�C. Current through the subject’s arm was measured from the wire con-
necting the hand chamber to the water using the same technique. For the split plate experiment, the electric organ discharges were
recorded from the leaping eel by connecting a split aluminum plate to wires connected to a PowerLab 8/35 data acquisition unit and
oscilloscope as illustrated in Figure 1. Video was collected with a MotionXtra NX7S1 camera (IDT Inc, Tallahassee, FL) with 2 RPS
Studio CooLED 100 RS-5610 for lighting at 1000 frames per second. The high-speed camera’s synchronization output was recorded
on a separate PowerLab channel allowing coordination of video plates and voltage recordings. To illustrate the eel’s output in rela-
tionship to eel behavior, data traces were copied at high-resolution from the LabChart 7 program into Adobe Illustrator and illustrated
with vector graphics to allow scaling to variable final figure sizes.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
To convert recorded voltages from the Model H1-ACDC-72 current sensor into current measures, the relevant area of the
LabChart 7 trace was selected, the ‘‘min-max’’ function was used to record the peak from each discharge using the Datapad func-
tion, and these values were exported to Microsoft Excel. The deflection from baseline was converted to current values (amps) based
on the previously recorded calibration current. These data, in addition to the corresponding voltages from the oscilloscope, were
imported into the JMP statistical program (SAS) to determine standard errors and standard deviations for each resistance value.
The means for each value were plotted and linear fit determined using the ‘‘fit line’’ function, which was used to produce the graph,
R squared value, and p value for the data illustrated in Figure 1 and described in the text. Note that the standard errors in Figure 1C
were too small to be visible on the figure and are instead listed in the figure legend.
