Abstract
Background: loneliness and social isolation have been associated with mortality and with functional decline in older people.
We investigated whether loneliness or social isolation are associated with progression of frailty.
Methods: participants were 2,817 people aged ≥60 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Loneliness was assessed
at Wave 2 using the Revised UCLA scale (short version). A social isolation score at Wave 2 was derived from data on living
alone, frequency of contact with friends, family and children, and participation in social organisations. Frailty was assessed
by the Fried phenotype of physical frailty at Waves 2 and 4, and by a frailty index at Waves 2–5.
Results: high levels of loneliness were associated with an increased risk of becoming physically frail or pre-frail around 4
years later: relative risk ratios (95% CI), adjusted for age, sex, level of frailty and other potential confounding factors at base-
line were 1.74 (1.29, 2.34) for pre-frailty, and 1.85 (1.14, 2.99) for frailty. High levels of loneliness were not associated with
change in the frailty index—a broadly based measure of general condition—over a mean period of 6 years. In the sample as
a whole, there was no association between social isolation and risk of becoming physically frail or pre-frail, but high social
isolation was associated with increased risk of becoming physically frail in men. Social isolation was not associated with
change in the frailty index.
Conclusion: older people who experience high levels of loneliness are at increased risk of becoming physically frail.
Keywords: loneliness, social isolation, frailty, longitudinal, cohort, older people
Introduction
Social relationships are important for health [1]. Most such
research has focused on social isolation or loneliness. Social
isolation is defined objectively using criteria such as having
few contacts, little involvement in social activities and living
alone. Loneliness is a subjective feeling of dissatisfaction
with one’s social relationships. Both social isolation and
loneliness have been linked with increased mortality [2–4],
incident heart disease [5, 6] and functional decline [7, 8].
Social isolation and loneliness tend to be correlated, albeit
weakly [9].
Frailty is a clinical syndrome whose main feature is heigh-
tened vulnerability to stressors due to lowered physiological
reserves, decline in the ability to maintain homoeostasis and
impairments in multiple systems [10]. There are two principal
models. In Fried’s phenotype model, frailty is based on three
or more components of poor grip strength, slow walking
speed, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional
weight loss [11]. The frailty index, or cumulative deficit mod-
el, defines frailty in terms of the accumulation of ‘deficits’
(symptoms, signs, diseases and disabilities). A frailty index
score reflects the proportion of potential deficits present
[12]. The phenotype model defines frailty in physical terms,
whereas the cumulative deficit model uses a broader defin-
ition of frailty.
Frailty—defined either using the Fried phenotype or a
frailty index—is associated with loneliness and social

 isolation [13–15]. The cause of these cross-sectional asso-
ciations is uncertain. One possibility is that being frail leads
to increases in loneliness and social isolation. There is some
prospective evidence in support of this, but only as regards
loneliness [15]. Another possibility is that greater loneliness
and social isolation leads to increases in frailty. To our
knowledge, no prospective study has investigated whether
loneliness is a risk factor for change in frailty status, and in
the only such study to examine social isolation’s relationship
with future frailty, no association was found after adjust-
ment for comorbidity [16]. Both loneliness and social isola-
tion have been associated prospectively with decline in gait
speed [7]. Gait speed is one of the five components of the
phenotype of physical frailty [11], but there is insufficient
evidence—or consensus—that it, or other single assess-
ments, can reliably identify the syndrome of frailty [10, 17].
We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA) to investigate whether social isolation and
loneliness were independent risk factors for change in frailty
status. Our secondary objective was to investigate whether
greater frailty increased the likelihood of high levels of lone-
liness or social isolation in the future. We characterised
frailty using both the Fried phenotype and a frailty index to
assess whether relationships with social isolation or loneli-
ness were consistent regardless of how frailty was defined.
Methods
For a full description of the methodology, see Appendix 1.
We provide a summary below.
Participants
The sample for ELSA was based on participants aged ≥50
years in the Health Survey for England [18]. The initial sur-
vey took place in 2002–3. Subsequent data collection has
taken place at 2-year intervals. The current study uses data
from Waves 2–5.
Measures
Loneliness
Participants completed the short version of the Revised
UCLA loneliness scale [19], which enquires about frequency
of feeling left out, isolated, and lacking companionship.
Scores range from 3 to 9. Higher values indicate greater
loneliness. Scores were positively skewed so for the regres-
sion analyses we categorised participants according to
whether their score was low (3) average (4 or 5) or high
(≥6).
Social isolation
We created a score for social isolation by giving one point
for each of: being unmarried or not cohabiting, having less
than monthly contact (whether face-to-face, written, or tele-
phone) with each of children, other members of the family,
and friends, and not being a member of organisations such
as religious groups, evening classes, social groups or resi-
dents associations. Scores ranged from 0 to 5. Higher
values indicate greater social isolation. Scores were posi-
tively skewed so for the regression analyses we categorised
participants according to whether their score was low (0)
average (1) or high (≥2).
Frailty
Frailty was assessed in two ways, as described previously
[20]. Data from Waves 2–5 were used to derive a frailty
index. A frailty index can be constructed from different
numbers of variables [12]. It is recommended that at least
30 deficits are included [21]. Our index was made up of 52
deficits. The number of deficits present is added and then
divided by the total number of deficits considered. Scores
range from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate greater frailty. We
used data from Waves 2 and 4 to derive the phenotype of
physical frailty [11].
Covariates
Age, socioeconomic position, educational attainment, depres-
sive symptoms and smoking at baseline were viewed as poten-
tial confounding variables. In models of the Fried phenotype
of frailty, we also adjusted for number of chronic physical dis-
eases at baseline.
Analytical sample
In total, 6,183 core cohort members aged ≥60 participated
in Wave 2. Of those, 3,505 were re-interviewed at Waves
3–5 and had sufficient data to allow the derivation of frailty
index scores. Analyses of social isolation and loneliness in
relation to change in the frailty index are based on 2,817
(80%) participants with complete data. Of the 6,183 core
cohort members aged ≥60 who participated in Wave 2,
2,824 were re-assessed by a nurse at Wave 4 and had data
on the frailty phenotype at both Waves. Analyses of social
isolation and loneliness in relation to change in the frailty
phenotype are based on 2,346 (83%) participants with com-
plete data.
Statistical analysis
Frailty index scores were positively skewed and were log-
transformed for analysis, after the addition of 0.01 to
avoid logarithms of zero. The frailty index change measure
was characterised by fitting sex-specific linear mixed
effects models with random intercepts and slopes for the
frailty index score over the four time points. Sex-specific
standard deviation scores for the random slopes were
used as the measure of change in the frailty index score.
This measure of change was weakly correlated with the
baseline frailty index score among men (r = −0.26) and
women (r = −0.20).
We used rank order correlations to examine loneliness
and social isolation in relation to other characteristics. We

 used linear regression to calculate regression coefficients
for change in frailty index score between Waves 2 and 5
according
to
baseline
social
isolation
and
loneliness.
Estimates are adjusted for age and sex, and further adjusted
for other covariates. We used multinomial logistic regres-
sion to derive relative risk ratios for becoming physically
frail or pre-frail by Wave 4, according to baseline social iso-
lation and loneliness. Estimates are shown adjusted for age,
sex and the number of components of the phenotype that
were present at baseline, and further adjusted for other
covariates.
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the sample and
their rank order correlation with social isolation and loneli-
ness. Being more socially isolated or lonelier was associated
with being older, less educated, less wealthy, having more
depressive symptoms, more chronic physical disease, being a
smoker, having more components of the phenotype of frailty
and a higher frailty index score. Being female was associated
with greater loneliness and with slightly greater social isola-
tion, though the latter relationship was of borderline signifi-
cance (P = 0.066). There was a modest correlation between
social isolation and loneliness (rho = 0.237) that did not differ
between the sexes (P = 0.184). Participants who were physic-
ally frailer at baseline tended to have a higher frailty index
score (rho = 0.40).
The baseline prevalence of physical frailty or pre-frailty
was 5.3% and 38.5%, respectively. By the Wave 4 follow-up,
around 4 years later, prevalence had increased to 11.2% and
41%, respectively. Overall change in the frailty index from
baseline to Wave 5, around 6 years later, was slight, with the
median (IQR) score changing from 0.146 (0.108–0.216) at
baseline to 0.142 (0.101–0.224), although there was consider-
able individual variation in change over time.
Table 2 shows relative risk ratios (RRR) (95% confi-
dence intervals) for becoming physically frail or pre-frail at
Wave 4, given level of frailty at baseline, according to social
isolation and loneliness at baseline. In the model adjusted

 had an increased risk of becoming physically frail compared
to those with low scores. High scores for social isolation
were also associated with an increased risk of becoming
pre-frail. These associations were attenuated and no longer
significant after further adjustment for other covariates.
We found significant differences in risk of physical frailty
and pre-frailty between those who gained high scores for loneli-
ness and those who gained low scores. These increases in risk
remained statistically significant, although attenuated, after full
adjustment for potential confounding factors: compared to
people who had a low score for loneliness, the multivariable-
adjusted relative risk ratios (95% CI) for pre-frailty and frailty
respectively among those with a high score for loneliness were
1.74 (1.29, 2.34) and 1.85 (1.14, 2.99) respectively.
As women tended to be lonelier and slightly more
socially isolated than men, we investigated whether associa-
tions between levels of social isolation or loneliness and
physical frailty differed between the sexes. The association
between high social isolation and risk of becoming physic-
ally frail, though not pre-frail, differed between the sexes
(p for interaction term = 0.01). No significant associations
were found in women, but men with high scores for social
isolation had an increased risk of becoming physically frail
that was of borderline significance: the RRR (95% CI)
adjusted for all covariates was 2.01 (1.00, 4.05). The asso-
ciations between loneliness and risk of becoming physically
frail or pre-frail did not differ between the sexes (p for
interaction terms all >0.13).
Table 3 shows regression coefficients for change in the
frailty index from baseline to Wave 5, around 6 years later,
according to social isolation and loneliness at baseline. There
were no significant associations between either social isolation
or loneliness and change in frailty index. These associations
did not differ by sex (p for interaction terms all >0.3).
We examined whether greater frailty at baseline increased
the likelihood of experiencing high levels of loneliness or
social isolation in the future. Greater physical frailty and hav-
ing a higher frailty index at baseline were each associated with
an increased risk of reporting high levels of loneliness in sub-
sequent follow-ups, after adjustment for age, sex, baseline
level of loneliness and other covariates (see Appendix 2).
Findings linking either measure of frailty with increases in
social isolation were slightly less consistent: after adjustment
for age, sex, baseline social isolation and other covariates,
baseline physical frailty was associated with an increased risk
of high levels of social isolation two years later at Wave 3, but
not at subsequent follow-ups, and baseline frailty index was
associated with increased risk of social isolation at Waves 4–5,
but not at Wave 3 (see Appendix 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies of
loneliness as a risk factor for frailty. However, prospective
findings linking high levels of loneliness with decline in gait
speed [7] or mobility [8], and increased difficulties with activ-
ities of daily life [7], or upper extremity tasks [8] suggest that
loneliness may increase the likelihood of sarcopenia, an age-
related syndrome characterised by loss of skeletal muscle mass
and strength [22]. Sarcopenia is a major contributor to risk of
functional decline and physical frailty [23]. The aetiology of
sarcopenia is multifactorial, involving comorbidity, inflamma-
tion, insulin resistance, changes in endocrine function, nutri-
tional deficiencies and low physical activity [24]. The latter
may be one mechanism underlying the association between
loneliness and progression of physical frailty. Lonely people
are more likely to be inactive [25, 26], and such inactivity
increases the risk of physical frailty [27, 28]. Another potential
mechanism may be diet. More socially engaged older people
tend to have a higher quality diet [29].
Studies of frailty risk factors usually use one model of
frailty only, most commonly a frailty index or the phenotype
of physical frailty [10]. Here, we used both models and
found that although loneliness was a significant predictor of
progression of physical frailty, it was not a risk factor for
change in the frailty index. We found a similar pattern in an
earlier study of this cohort in that having a more positive
attitude to ageing was associated with lower risk of becom-
ing physically frail, but was not associated with change in a
frailty index [20]. One explanation may lie in the broader

The frailty change measure was obtained by fitting sex-specific linear mixed effects models for the frailty index score over Waves 2, 3, 4 and 5. Standard deviation
scores for the random slopes were used as the measure of change. A positive regression coefficient indicates increase or reduced loss in frailty index and a negative
coefficient reflects accelerated loss.

 definition of frailty inherent in the cumulative deficit model
which describes the general state or condition of an individ-
ual rather than a specific medical syndrome [30]. Our find-
ings highlight the fact that the two principal models of
frailty do not have the same risk factors.
Evidence on whether social isolation increases risk of
frailty is sparse. One study found that persistent social isola-
tion over two to three waves of follow-up was associated
with an increased risk of being frail (defined as problems in
two or more domains: physical, cognitive, sensory or nutri-
tive) but numbers of cases were small and the association
became non-significant after adjustment for physical illness
[16]. Here, in the sample as a whole, high social isolation
was not associated with increased risk of becoming physic-
ally frail or pre-frail once we controlled for confounding
factors. Social isolation was not linked with progression of
frailty as measured by a frailty index. Our findings on social
isolation and physical frailty contrast with those of Shankar
et al. who found that high social isolation was a risk factor
for decline in gait speed [7]. This inconsistency is not unex-
pected given that change in physical frailty status is likely to
involve varying degrees of change in all five components of
the phenotype, not just gait speed.
We found evidence that the relationship between loneliness
and frailty is bidirectional. Greater frailty increased the likeli-
hood of high levels of loneliness in the future. This is consist-
ent with observations in the Longitudinal Ageing Study
Amsterdam [15]. In the Amsterdam study, frailty was not asso-
ciated with decline in social network size or in emotional or
instrumental support [15]. Here, we found indications that
greater frailty—as measured by the frailty index in particular—
was associated with increased risk of experiencing more social
isolation subsequently. Our findings suggest that frailty may
lead to increased social isolation, but not vice versa.
Strengths of our study include the large sample size and
the fact that ELSA is designed to be representative of the
community-dwelling English population aged ≥50. The study
has limitations. Those excluded tended to be frailer, lonelier
and more isolated than those who were included. Our findings
may underestimate the true associations between loneliness or
social isolation and change in frailty status. We may not have
controlled adequately for depressive symptoms. These were
assessed with the short version of the CES-D, three items of
which we excluded due to potential overlap with the loneliness
measure or because they were used as indicators of the
exhaustion component of the Fried phenotype.
In this prospective study, high levels of loneliness were asso-
ciated with increased risk of physical frailty. By contrast, loneliness
was not linked with the rate at which a frailty index—a broadly
based measure of general condition—changed over time.
Key Points
• Loneliness and social isolation have been linked with pre-
mature mortality and with functional decline in older
people.
• We found that high levels of loneliness, but not of social
isolation, increased the risk of becoming physically frail.
• Neither loneliness nor social isolation were associated with
the rate of change in a more broadly defined frailty index.
