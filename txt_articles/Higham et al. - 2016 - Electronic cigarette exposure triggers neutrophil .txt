Abstract
Background: The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) is increasing and there is widespread perception that e-cigs
are safe. E-cigs contain harmful chemicals; more research is needed to evaluate the safety of e-cig use. Our aim was
to investigate the effects of e-cigs on the inflammatory response of human neutrophils.
Methods: Neutrophils were exposed to e-cig vapour extract (ECVE) and the expression of CD11b and CD66b was
measured by flow cytometry and MMP-9 and CXCL8 by ELISA. We also measured the activity of neutrophil elastase
(NE) and MMP-9, along with the activation of inflammatory signalling pathways. Finally we analysed the biochemical
composition of ECVE by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
Results: ECVE caused an increase in the expression of CD11b and CD66b, and increased the release of MMP-9 and
CXCL8. Furthermore, there was an increase in NE and MMP-9 activity and an increase in p38 MAPK activation. We also
identified several harmful chemicals in ECVE, including known carcinogens.
Conclusions: ECVE causes a pro-inflammatory response from human neutrophils. This raises concerns over the safety
of e-cig use.

Background
There are an estimated 13 million users of electronic
cigarettes (e-cigs) worldwide [1]. E-cigs are used to help
reduce or stop tobacco smoking [2]. However, it has
been shown that toxic chemicals are present in e-cig
vapour, such as formaldehyde and acrolein [3–5], casting
doubt on the safety of using e-cigs.
Cigarette smoke extract increases the secretion of pro-
inflammatory mediators from a range of different cell
types including epithelial cells, macrophages and neutro-
phils [6–8]. Similarly, e-cig vapour exposure increases
the release of inflammatory mediators from keratinocyte
and alveolar epithelial cell lines [9]. Furthermore, e-liquid
increases interleukin-6 secretion from bronchial epithelial
cells [10]. This raises concerns over the potential of e-cigs
to promote pulmonary inflammation in a similar manner
to tobacco smoking.
Neutrophil numbers are increased in the lungs of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients
and increased numbers positively correlate with disease
severity [11, 12]. Chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 8
(CXCL8) is a key neutrophil chemoattractant [13] and
the levels of CXCL8 are increased in the lungs of COPD
patients [14]. Cigarette smoke exposed neutrophils secrete
CXCL8, which may lead to increased neutrophil recruit-
ment to the lungs.
Neutrophils are involved in many aspects of COPD patho-
physiology. For example, neutrophils release proteases such
as neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) which cause tissue destruction resulting in em-
physema [15]. Cigarette smoke stimulates NE and MMP-9
release from neutrophils [8, 16]. The levels of NE and
MMP-9 are increased in the airways of COPD patients and
the levels positively correlate with disease severity [17–19].
Moreover, COPD neutrophils demonstrate a higher level of
activation compared to controls {Wright, 2016 #132}.

 Upon exposure to cigarette smoke and the bacterial
peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenalanine (fMLP),
neutrophils increase the expression of CD11b and CD66b,
important for the migration and degranulation of neutro-
phils at sites of inflammation [20, 21]. There is increased
expression of the adhesion molecule CD11b on the
surface of blood and lung neutrophils of COPD patients
[22–25]. CD11b and CD66b can be regarded as markers
of neutrophil activation.
The effects of e-cigs on neutrophil activity are unknown.
Due to the complex mixture of chemicals present in
e-cigs, we hypothesised that exposure to e-cigs will induce
neutrophil activation. The aim of this study was to investi-
gate the effects of e-cig exposure on the inflammatory re-
sponse of human neutrophils. We examined the effects on
CD11b, CD66b and neutrophil shape change, and the re-
lease of MMP-9, NE and CXCL8, which are all implicated
in the pathogenesis of COPD [17, 26, 27].
Methods
Study subjects
Ten healthy never-smokers were recruited to donate per-
ipheral blood samples (demography shown in Additional
file 1). All subjects gave written informed consent. This
research was approved by Preston research ethics com-
mittee REC reference 10/H1016/25.
Electronic cigarette
Table 1 shows the three brands of e-cigs used for this
study; VIP® (brand 1), KIK® (brand 2) and Puritane®
(brand 3). All experiments were performed using brand
1 containing 24 mg nicotine unless otherwise stated.
E-cig vapour extract preparation
For brand 1 and brand 2, e-cig vapour extract (ECVE) was
prepared by bubbling e-cig vapour through RPMI-1640 cul-
ture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich)
using a Watson-Marlow 520R peristaltic pump (Watson-
Marlow Ltd, Falmouth, UK). Vapour was generated by
manual activation of the heating coil at a flow rate of
15 mL/min. For brand 3, vapour was generated automatic-
ally using a flow rate of 90 mL/min. Each cycle of vapour
lasted 10 s followed by a 30 s interval. In total for each
brand, e-cig vapour was bubbled through the media 20
times and the total time of preparation was approximately
13 mins.
For all experiments, ECVE optical density (OD) was
measured
using
a
spectrophotometer
(Eppendorf,
Stevenage, UK)) at the 320 nm wavelength, as is the
case for previous publications using cigarette smoke
extract [7, 28, 29]. Optical density is an arbitrary unit
used to find the concentration of ECVE which gives
the optimal response and to normalise preparations for
the purposes of obtaining reproducible data. The choice
of 320 nm wavelength was based upon the relative con-
tribution of this peak in all of the ECVE preparations
(Additional file 2) determined using a POLARstar Omega
microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Buckinghamshire, UK);
this was a major peak in the absorbance spectrum for all
ECVE preparations. It was important to avoid peaks at
260 nm for two reasons; 1) the absorbance spectra of
nicotine demonstrate a major peak at 260 nm [30, 31]; 2)
The quantification of nucleic acids utilises absorbance at
260 nm. Any contaminating nucleic acids may therefore
affect the results at this part of the spectrum. Foetal calf
serum (FCS; 10 %, Invitrogen) was then added and the
ECVE was filtered using a syringe driven 0.22 μm filter.
The ECVE was then adjusted to the desired OD using
culture medium.
Cigarette smoke extract preparation
Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared as previously
described [7]. Briefly, one 3R4F Kentucky research cigarette
(University of Kentucky, Kentucky, USA) was bubbled
through RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin using a Watson-Marlow 520R peristaltic
pump. 10 % FCS was then added and the CSE was filtered
using a syringe driven 0.22 μm filter. The CSE was then
adjusted to the desired OD using culture medium.
Neutrophil isolation and culture
Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood. Whole
blood was mixed with 4 % dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) in
1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and PBS at a ratio of
2:1:1 and the red blood cells were left to sediment on ice
for 30 mins. The remaining supernatant was removed,
layered over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,
UK) and centrifuged (400 g for 30 mins at room
temperature). The remaining red bloods cells were

 lysed by addition of sterile molecular grade water
(Sigma-Aldrich) and the suspension was quenched by
the addition of PBS. The suspension was then washed
(400 g for 10 mins at 4 °C) and the granulocyte number
was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Granulocytes were
re-suspended at a density of 1 × 106 per ml in supple-
mented RPMI-1640 media. The purity of the neutrophil
preparation was approximately 95 % (confirmed by
Rapi-diff staining as previously described [32]). Cytospin
preparations were air dried, fixed with methanol for ten
minutes and stained with Rapi-diff according to manufac-
turer’s instructions (Triangle, Skelmersdale, UK). A total
of 200 cells per slide were counted and the proportion of
neutrophils was calculated.
Neutrophil shape change, viability and CD11b and CD66b
expression
Neutrophils were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per polypropylene
tube and incubated with ECVE (0.001–0.1 OD) for 2, 4 or
6 h (shape change and CD11b and CD66b expression) or
6 h (viability) in a 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere at
37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and prepared for flow
cytometry. Details can be found in Additional file 3.
MMP-9 and CXCL8 release
Neutrophils were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in a flat
bottomed 96-well plate and incubated with ECVE, CSE
(0.001–0.1 OD) or acrolein (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h in a
5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Supernatants
were removed and analysed for MMP-9 and CXCL8 by
enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA; R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Supernatants were also used to measure MMP-9 activity by
zymography and MMP-9 levels by western blot. Details can
be found in Additional file 3.
For studies examining the effect of drug treatment on
ECVE (0.003 OD) induced MMP-9 release, neutrophils
were pre-treated with vehicle control (DMSO 0.005 %) the
p38 MAPK inhibitor BIRB-796 (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich),
the ERK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (1 μM; Stratech
Scientific Ltd, Newmarket, UK) or dexamethasone
(1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h prior to incubation with
ECVE. MMP-9 was measured by ELISA.
NE activity
Neutrophils were seeded at 1.4 × 105 cells per well in a
flat bottomed 96-well plate and incubated with ECVE
(0.001–0.1 OD) for 6 h in a 5 % CO2 humidified atmos-
phere at 37 °C. A rhodamine 110-based substrate (R6506
Invitrogen) was added 30 min prior to the endpoint after
which fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar
omega plate reader set at excitation 485 nm emission
520 nm (BMG Labtech, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Inflammatory pathway activation
Neutrophils were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per well in a flat
bottomed six-well plate and incubated with ECVE (0.003
and 0.01 OD) for 30 and 60 min in a 5 % CO2 humidi-
fied atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in RIPA
buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 % Nonidet P-40, 0.25 %] containing phosphatase
(Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem,
Nottingham, UK) and samples were prepared for Western
blot. Details can be found in Additional file 3.
Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis
UHPLC-MS was performed to analyse the chemical
composition of e-liquid and ECVE. Details can be found
in Additional file 3.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat
software (GraphPad Software Inc., California, USA). Experi-
ments with ECVE dose response curves were analysed using
a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett’s
post-test.
Results
Neutrophil activation
Neutrophils (n = 3) were exposed to ECVE for up to 6 h.
ECVE increased neutrophil shape change and the mean
fluorescence intensity of CD11b and CD66b expression
compared to untreated neutrophils (Fig. 1 and Additional
file 4); maximal changes were observed with 0.003 ECVE
for 4 h (p < 0.05). There was a bell shaped curve, as shape
change, CD11b and CD66b expression levels were not in-
creased at higher ECVE concentrations. Analysis using
the percentage of CD11b positive neutrophils followed a
similar trend but this did not reach statistical significance
(Additional file 5), while there was no change for the per-
centage of CD66b positive neutrophils (Additional file 5).
There was high baseline expression of both of these
markers when using percentage expression analysis.
Following ECVE treatment for 6 h, the percentage of
neutrophils undergoing early apoptosis or necrosis
were not increased compared to untreated neutrophils
(Additional file 6).
Protease and CXCL8 secretion
Neutrophils (n = 10) exposed to ECVE secreted increased
quantities of MMP-9 and CXCL8 with maximal release ob-
served at 0.003 ECVE (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively;
Fig. 2a and d). The secretion of MMP-9 and CXCL8
showed a bell shaped curve, with reduced secretion at
higher concentrations. We confirmed that there was no
contamination of the ECVE by the apparatus, by preparing

 a “mock” ECVE, bubbling air through the culture medium
(Additional file 7).
Gelatinase activity in neutrophil supernatants (n = 3)
was increased following exposure to 0.003 ECVE (Fig. 2b).
Activity was observed in the 90–150 kDa range, consistent
with different forms of MMP-9. Western blot analysis
confirmed MMP-9 was present within the 90–150 kDa
range (Fig. 2b), and densitometry confirmed a significant
increase in MMP-9 secretion upon exposure to 0.003
ECVE compared to untreated neutrophils (Fig. 2c).

 NE activity was significantly increased in the super-
natants of neutrophils (N = 6) exposed to 0.003 ECVE
compared to untreated neutrophils (p < 0.01; Fig. 2e).
A bell shaped curve was again observed, with a significant
reduction in NE activity at 0.03 and 0.1 ECVE (p < 0.05).
Cell signalling pathway activation
Cigarette smoke has previously been shown to activate the
p38 MAPK and ERK pathways in neutrophils [33–35]. In
addition, nicotine has been shown to activate the NF-κB
pathway ([36]. We therefore examined the effect of ECVE
on the activation of these pathways.
Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase
in p38 MAPK phosphorylation at 0.01 ECVE (p < 0.05)
and a numerical increase at 0.003 compared to un-
stimulated controls (n = 5; Fig. 3). There was a numer-
ical increase in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation that did not
reach statistical significance. There were no changes in
the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).
We further investigated the involvement of p38 MAPK
in ECVE induced neutrophil activation by studying the
effect of a p38 MAPK inhibitor, BIRB-796, on MMP-9
release in response to ECVE (n = 6). We used 0.003
ECVE as this concentration caused the greatest secretion
of MMP-9 (Fig. 2). Pre-treatment of neutrophils with
BIRB-796 (1 μM) for 1 h prior to incubation with 0.003
ECVE for 6 h significantly reduced MMP-9 release by
62 % (Fig. 4). The ERK inhibitor, selumetinib (1 μM),
and the corticosteroid dexamethasone (1 μM) had no
effect.
E-Cig brand and CSE comparisons
Nicotine has previously been shown to induce CXCL8
release from neutrophils [36]. We therefore sought to
evaluate the effects of different e-cig brands with and
without nicotine on MMP-9 and CXCL8 release (n = 10;
Figs. 5 and 6).
All the brands increased MMP-9 and CXCL8 secretion
(although the increase in MMP-9 secretion after expos-
ure to KIK 24 mg did not reach statistical significance),
with bell shaped curves observed for most brands. The
ECVE concentrations that caused the greatest inductions
of MMP-9 and CXCL8 secretion varied greatly between
brands. CSE caused significant increases in MMP-9 se-
cretion at 0.03 and 0.1 OD and CXCL8 secretion at 0.01
and 0.03 OD. The effects of the different e-cig brands
were often similar to, or greater than, CSE.
UHPLC-MS analysis
The labelling stating the constituents of brand 1 (24 mg)
e-cig liquid was as follows: nicotine, water, propylene
glycol, glycerol and flavours. We investigated the constit-
uents of e-cig liquid using UHPLC-MS. Chemicals were
putatively identified based on molecular weight, with
other constituents unidentified. Their chemical class and
potential hazards are documented within Table 2, along
with the associated chemical entities of biological interest
(ChEBI) code [37], which enables cross-referencing of
chemicals for biological relevance. Cyclohexane, isoquino-
line, diglyme and skatole were identified.
A similar analysis was carried out on ECVE prepared
using brand 1 (24 mg) e-cig liquid. Over 120 chemicals

and any changes were relative to total p38 MAPK. Data presented as mean ± SEM where * = significant increase compared to unstimulated
control (p < 0.05)

 were putatively identified (Table 3), with extra constitu-
ents potentially coming from e-cig liquid vaporisation by-
products. Known harmful chemicals including acrolein,
propanal, styrene and the carcinogens 2, 3-benzofuran
and allylthiourea were putatively identified.
We also performed pure standard analysis of acrolein
(Additional file 8). Inference of median ECVE ion count
levels of acrolein from the standard analysis indicates a
level of 4.81 μM present in ECVE.
Effect of acrolein on neutrophil response
The presence of high acrolein levels (4.81 μM) in ECVE
prepared with brand 1 (24 mg) led us to examine the ef-
fects of acrolein (0.1–1 μM) on the neutrophil inflamma-
tory response from six healthy subjects. Acrolein caused a
significant increase in MMP-9 release at a concentration of
1 μM (Fig. 7).
Discussion
ECVE causes activation of human neutrophils. ECVE
increased neutrophil CD11b and CD66b expression, and
induced neutrophil shape change; these are markers of
neutrophil activation. Furthermore, ECVE increased
MMP-9 and CXCL8 secretion by neutrophils, and upregu-
lated MMP-9 and NE activity. These pro-inflammatory
changes were accompanied by p38 MAPK activation.
Mass spectroscopy analysis of e-cig liquid and ECVE con-
firmed the presence of various compounds capable of
causing harm to humans. These findings challenge the
perception that e-cigs are safe.
It is known that acute exposure to cigarette smoke
extract increases CXCL8 and MMP-9 secretion from
alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, [7, 38] and NE
secretion from neutrophils [8, 16]. Here we show similar
findings for the effects of ECVE on neutrophils. Neutrophil
activation is a characteristic feature of COPD; indeed,

 COPD is often referred to as a “neutrophilic lung disease”.
We demonstrate that e-cigs cause neutrophil activation,
which raises concerns about the safety of these devices.
A proposed advantage of e-cigs is that they lack the
carcinogens within the tar present in cigarettes. However,
e-cigs may still contain compounds with carcinogenic
properties [5]. We now show that e-cigs also contain a
variety of other compounds, including carcinogens. These
include the saturated aldehyde propanal, the carcinogens
2, 3-benzofuran and allylthiourea and the respiratory toxin
styrene.
We observed acrolein in the vapour extract but not
the e-liquid itself. Acrolein can be produced by heating
glycerol [39], and our observations are likely attributable
to heating glycerol contained in e-liquid. Acrolein is also
a constituent of tobacco smoke. Acrolein induces in-
flammatory responses from macrophages and epithelial
cells [40, 41]. We now show that acrolein induces
MMP-9 release from neutrophils within the concentra-
tion found in ECVE. This confirms that acrolein is one
potential cause of the pro-inflammatory effects of e-cig
vapour. We have identified a number of chemicals
present in ECVE using UHPLC-MS, and the potential
for each of these to cause inflammation or other toxic
effects can now be investigated. Styrene has previously
been linked to airway inflammation present in people
with occupational asthma [42] and has also been shown
to induce monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and
CXCL8 release from an alveolar epithelial cell line [43, 44].
In addition, propanal has been shown to increase gene
expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines including IL-6 and CXCL8 in an alveolar
epithelial cell line [45].
We observed a bell shaped curve for the effect of
ECVE in all experiments of neutrophil function. This
was not due to a reduction in neutrophil viability. There
are other examples of bell shaped curves for neutrophil
biology, including CXCL8 induced chemotaxis, substance

 P induced adhesion and Staphylococcus aureus induced
CD11b, CD18 and CD66b expression [46–48]. It has been
suggested that the bell shaped curve for neutrophil func-
tion arises due to negative feedback mechanisms. For ex-
ample, CXCL8 causes a dose dependant reduction in
chemokine C-X-C motif receptor (CXCR) 1 and CXCR2
expression. Reducing the expression of these chemotactic
receptors regulates neutrophil inflammatory responses
and arrests these cells at the site of inflammation where
chemokine concentrations are highest.
CD66b
cross-linking
between
neutrophils
induces
CXCL8 release [49]. When neutrophils are exposed to
ECVE, CD66b expression may be driving the release of
inflammatory mediators through neutrophil cross-linkage.
However, at higher ECVE concentrations this CD66b
response diminishes. This may regulate neutrophil re-
sponses to avoid excessive inflammation, similar to the
suggestion of Schmidt et al in the case of neutrophils
exposed to bacteria [47]. However, neutrophils artificially
arrested in this state are less likely to exert their protective
innate immune functions and therefore the host may be
more susceptible to bacterial infection.
The analysis of CD11b and CD66b principally used
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) by flow cytometry
to provide a sensitive overall quantification of expression
in all neutrophils. The analysis of cell percentages is a
commonly used alternative, but in this case there were
high baseline expression levels which made it difficult to
observe any increase with ECVE.
MMP-9 levels are increased in the lungs of smokers
[50] and there is a positive correlation between MMP-9
levels, sputum neutrophils and COPD severity [17, 18, 51].
Similarly, NE levels are increased in the lungs of cigarette
smokers and NE activity is positively correlated with
COPD severity [19, 52]. MMP-9 and NE contribute to em-
physema through the destruction of the lung parenchyma.
Our results suggest that e-cig use increases the ability of
human neutrophils to secrete activated MMP-9 and NE,
which may contribute to lung parenchymal destruction.
NE degrades the antimicrobial peptide, short palate lung
and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1) [53]. E-liquid
inhibits SPLUNC1 expression in human airway epithe-
lial cells [10]. Both direct and indirect reductions in
SPLUNC1 levels by e-cigs in addition to reduced bacterial
phagocytic activity of e-cig exposed alveolar macrophages
[54], may result in a susceptibility to bacterial infections in
e-cig users. Mice exposed to e-cig vapour have been
shown to be more susceptible to viral and bacterial infec-
tions [54]. This is reminiscent of the effects of tobacco
smoking.
ECVE caused activation of the p38 MAPK pathway,
akin to tobacco smoke exposed alveolar macrophages
[7, 41]. P38 MAPK activation promotes inflammation and
activated p38 MAPK is increased in COPD lungs [52, 55].
We showed activation of the p38 MAPK pathway at 0.01
ECVE. The results at 0.003 ECVE were not statistically
significant, despite clear activation in some of the experi-
ments performed (Fig. 3). The 0.003 ECVE concentration
generally caused the greatest increases in cell activation
(Figs. 1 and 2), although there was evidence that 0.01
ECVE caused significant MMP-9 release and neutrophil
shape change. The p38 MAPK inhibitor BIRB-796 sup-
pressed 0.003 ECVE induced MMP-9 release by approxi-
mately 60 %, confirming the role of p38 MAPK signalling
in the neutrophil response to ECVE. However, approxi-
mately 40 % of ECVE induced MMP-9 release was in-
sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition suggesting ECVE can
also induce MMP-9 release by p38 MAPK independent
mechanisms.
The corticosteroid dexamethasone had no effect on
ECVE induced MMP-9 release. This may be relevant to
COPD patients using e-cigs and corticosteroids; these
drugs do not appear to suppress neutrophil activation
caused by e-cigs.
E-cig induced MMP-9 and CXCL8 release was demon-
strated using different brands of e-cigs with and without
nicotine. This demonstrates that the pro-inflammatory
effects are not restricted to one brand and are observed
using preparations with and without nicotine. There
were considerable differences in the magnitude of effects
between the brands, and the shape of the dose response
curves, which are likely attributable to differences in
chemical composition. The increased flow rate used to
produce ECVE with brand 3 did not result in an increased
magnitude of effect when compared to the other brands.
Our comparisons with cigarette smoke provide important
insights; MMP-9 and CXCL8 release caused by different
e-cig brands were often similar to, or in excess of, the CSE
response.
Nicotine has previously been shown to induce CXCL8
release from neutrophils [36]. We observed increased re-
lease of MMP-9 and CXCL8 upon exposure to ECVE
with and without nicotine, suggesting that these effects
are dependent on other pro-inflammatory constituents.
The primary aim of this paper was to examine the po-
tential of e-cigs to cause harm. We used neutrophils from
healthy never smokers to avoid any confounding variables
due to chronic exposure to tobacco cigarettes or the pres-
ence of chronic inflammation. Nevertheless, future studies
should examine the effect of e-cigs on immune cells iso-
lated from COPD patients, particularly those involved in
the pathogenesis of COPD, including neutrophils, alveolar
macrophages and CD8 T-cells. This will help us to under-
stand the impact of e-cigs on patients with established
chronic inflammation.
ECVE causes rapid activation of neutrophils which
continues up to 6 h. Although we do not know how
repeated exposure to e-cigs will affect neutrophils, the

 acute effects reported here are similar to those by
cigarette smoke extract. This suggests that chronic ex-
posure to e-cigs may induce similar chronic inflamma-
tory changes reported in cigarette smokers.
Conclusions
We have shown that ECVE causes pro-inflammatory re-
sponses from human neutrophils. E-cigs are often used to
avoid the unwanted effects of conventional cigarettes, such
as causing pulmonary inflammation. Our results raise
concerns over the safety of e-cig use.
