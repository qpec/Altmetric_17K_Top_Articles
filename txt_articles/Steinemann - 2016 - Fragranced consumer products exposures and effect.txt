Abstract Fragranced consumer products, such as cleaning
supplies, air fresheners, and personal care products, are a pri-
mary source of indoor air pollutants and personal exposure.
Previous research indicates that fragranced products can trig-
ger adverse health effects, with implications for workplaces
and public places. This is the first study to examine the mul-
tiple dimensions of exposures related to fragranced products
and effects in the US population. The study investigated the
prevalence and types of fragranced product exposures, asso-
ciated health effects, awareness of product emissions, and
preferences for fragrance-free policies and environments.
Data were collected using an online survey with a nationally
representative population (n = 1136) of adults in the USA.
Overall, 34.7 % of the population reported health problems,
such as migraine headaches and respiratory difficulties, when
exposed to fragranced products. Further, 15.1 % have lost
workdays or a job due to fragranced product exposure in the
workplace. Also, 20.2 % would enter a business but then leave
as quickly as possible if they smell air fresheners or some
fragranced product. Over 50 % of the population would prefer
that workplaces, health care facilities and professionals, ho-
tels, and airplanes were fragrance-free. While prior research
found that common fragranced products, even those called
green and organic, emitted hazardous air pollutants, more than
two thirds of the population were not aware of this, and over
60 % would not continue to use a fragranced product if they
knew it emitted such pollutants. Results from this study pro-
vide strong evidence that fragranced products can trigger ad-
verse health effects in the general population. The study also
indicates that reducing exposure to fragranced products, such
as through fragrance-free policies, can provide cost-effective
and relatively simple ways to reduce risks and improve air
quality and health.

Introduction
Society is suffused with fragranced consumer products: air
fresheners, cleaning products, soaps, hand sanitizers, laundry
supplies, and personal care products, to name a few out of
hundreds.1 Fragranced products emit a range of volatile or-
ganic compounds (VOCs), such as terpenes (e.g., limonene),
which often dominate pollutants found indoors, and generate
secondary pollutants such as formaldehyde (e.g., Nazaroff and
Weschler 2004).
Fragranced products have been associated with a range of
adverse health effects, such as migraine headaches, asthma
1 The term “fragranced consumer products,” or for brevity “fragranced
products,” as used in this article, refers to chemically formulated consum-
er products with a fragrance (Steinemann 2009). The phrase “fragranced
product emissions” refers to emissions from fragranced consumer prod-
ucts. Finally, the words “fragrance(d)” and “scent(ed)” are used inter-
changeably in this article.

 attacks, respiratory difficulties, neurological problems, muco-
sal symptoms, and contact dermatitis (Kim et al. 2015;
Elberling et al. 2005; Millqvist and Löwhagen 1996; Kumar
et al. 1995; Kelman 2004; Caress and Steinemann 2004, 2005;
Johansen 2003; Rastogi et al. 2007; Sealey et al. 2015). In two
previous national surveys of the US population, 19 % reported
breathing difficulties, headaches, or other health problems
when exposed to air fresheners and deodorizers, and 10.9 %
reported health problems from the scent of laundry products
vented outdoors (Caress and Steinemann 2009).
Despite numerous laws designed to protect human health
and the environment, no law in the US requires the disclosure
of all ingredients in fragranced consumer products
(Steinemann 2009). Protections on ingredient disclosure de-
pend on the product. First, for all fragranced consumer prod-
ucts, the general term “fragrance” can be listed on the label, or
a related term (such as “perfume”), rather than the specific
ingredients in a fragrance. Yet an individual “fragrance” in a
product is typically a complex mixture of several dozen to
several hundred chemicals (Bickers et al. 2003), primarily
synthetic compounds (Somogyi et al. 1998), among nearly
3000 compounds documented as fragrance ingredients
(IFRA 2011). Second, for products such as air fresheners,
laundry supplies, cleaning products, and others regulated by
the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, ingredients do
not need to be fully listed on either the product label or the
material safety data sheet (MSDS). Also, these products do
not need to list the presence of a “fragrance” on either the label
or MSDS. Third, for products such as personal care products,
cosmetics, and others regulated by the US Food and Drug
Administration, ingredients need to be listed on the product
label, but not on the MSDS. The general term “fragrance” can
be listed on the label instead of the specific ingredients in the
fragrance, but the fragrance term or ingredients do not need to
be listed on the MSDS.
Previous studies that analyzed fragranced product emis-
sions found that relatively few ingredients were disclosed to
the public (e.g., Uhde and Schulz 2015; Steinemann et al.
2011). For instance, Steinemann (2015) found more than
156 VOCs emitted from 37 fragranced consumer products,
the most common being limonene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene,
and other terpenes. Of these 156 VOCs, 42 VOCs were clas-
sified as toxic or hazardous under US federal laws, and each
product emitted at least one of these chemicals. Moreover,
emissions of carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants from so-
called green or organic fragranced products were not signifi-
cantly different from regular fragranced products. However, of
over 550 volatile ingredients emitted collectively, and over
230 classified as toxic or hazardous, fewer than 3 % were
disclosed on the product labels, MSDSs, or websites.
Product emissions can affect not only indoor environments
but also outdoor air quality. For instance, emissions from dry-
er vents, during the use of fragranced laundry products,
contain numerous VOCs that affect outdoor air quality, such
as acetaldehyde, a hazardous air pollutant (Steinemann et al.
2011). While these pollutants are regulated from outdoor
sources, they are unregulated when coming from indoor
sources (such as laundry dryer vents), even though emissions
can affect outdoor air quality and human health.
Individuals report health problems when exposed to
fragranced products in society, other than through intentional
use of products. Secondhand scents (as termed in this article)
refers to indirect or involuntary exposure to fragranced prod-
ucts (in an analogy to secondhand smoke). As a response,
fragrance-free policies (similar to smoke-free policies) have
been implemented by businesses, agencies, and institutions
in the USA and other countries (e.g., CDCP 2009; CCOHS
2015) to restrict the use of fragranced products within indoor
environments such as workplaces, schools, hospitals, and pub-
lic places.
This article reports results from the first national population
survey to investigate a range of exposures and effects associ-
ated with fragranced product emissions, preferences for
fragrance-free environments, and implications for air quality,
indoor environments, and health. Contributions include new
data and insights on the extent and impacts of the problem and
pathways for solutions.
Methods
To investigate the prevalence and types of exposures, health
effects, and societal impacts, an on-line survey was conducted
of the adult American population, using a national random
sample representative of age, gender, and region (n = 1136,
confidence limit = 95 %, confidence interval = 3 %). The
survey instrument was developed and tested over a 2-year
period, including cognitive testing with 10 individuals and
piloting with over 100 individuals, before full implementation
in June 2016. The survey drew upon participants from a large
web-based USA panel (over 5,000,000 people) held by
Survey Sampling International. Participant recruitment
followed a randomized process as detailed in SSI (2016). All
responses were anonymous. Survey completion time was ap-
proximately 10 min. The survey response rate was 94 %. The
research study received ethics approval from the University of
Melbourne. Details on the survey methodology are provided
as a supplemental document.
Survey questions investigated the following dimensions:
use and exposure to fragranced products, both from one’s
own use and from others’ use; health effects related to expo-
sures to certain products and exposure settings; impacts of
fragrance exposure in the workplace and in society; awareness
of fragranced product ingredients and labeling; preferences for
fragrance-free environments and policies; and demographic
information.

 Fragranced products were categorized as follows: (a) Air
fresheners and deodorizers (e.g., sprays, solids, oils, disks);
(b) Personal care products (e.g., soaps, hand sanitizer, lotions,
deodorant, sunscreen, shampoos); (c) Cleaning supplies (e.g.,
all-purpose cleaners, disinfectants, and dishwashing soap); (d)
Laundry products (e.g., detergents, fabric softeners, dryer
sheets); (e) Household products (e.g., scented candles, toilet
paper, trash bags, baby products); (f) Fragrance (e.g., perfume,
cologne, after-shave); and (g) Other.
Health effects were categorized as follows: (a) Migraine head-
aches; (b) Asthma attacks; (c) Neurological problems (e.g., diz-
ziness, seizures, head pain, fainting, loss of coordination); (d)
Respiratory problems (e.g., difficulty breathing, coughing, short-
ness of breath); (e) Skin problems (e.g., rashes, hives, red skin,
tingling skin, dermatitis); (f) Cognitive problems (e.g., difficulties
thinking, concentrating, or remembering); (g) Mucosal symp-
toms (e.g., watery or red eyes, nasal congestion, sneezing); (h)
Immune system problems (e.g., swollen lymph glands, fever,
fatigue); (i) Gastrointestinal problems (e.g., nausea, bloating,
cramping, diarrhea); (j) Cardiovascular problems (e.g., fast or
irregular heartbeat, jitteriness, chest discomfort); (k)
Musculoskeletal problems (e.g., muscle or joint pain, cramps,
weakness); (j) Other. The categories of health effects were de-
rived from prior surveys of fragranced products and health effects
(Caress and Steinemann 2004, 2005; Miller and Prihoda 1999)
and pre-tested and reviewed by a pilot group of individuals and
health care professionals.
In addition to products and health effects, specific exposure
contexts were investigated, which included the following: air
fresheners or deodorizers used in public toilets and other
places, scented laundry products vented outdoors, being in a
room after it was cleaned with scented cleaning products,
being near someone wearing a fragranced product, entering
a business with the scent of fragranced products, fragranced
soap used in public toilets, and ability to access environments
that used fragranced products. Questions also investigated
awareness of fragranced product emissions and ingredient dis-
closure, preferences for fragrance-free environments (e.g.,
workplaces, health care facilities, airplanes, and hotels), and
lost workdays due to fragranced product exposure.
Demographic questions were asked regarding age, gender,
household income, and zip code in the USA.
Results
Main findings are summarized in this section, with full results
provided as supplemental documentation.
Fragranced product use
Of the general population surveyed in America, 98.3 % are
exposed to fragranced products at least once a week, from
their own use: 72.8 % air fresheners and deodorizers;
88.8 % personal care products; 79.9 % cleaning supplies;
84.1 % laundry products; 77.0 % household products;
70.2 % fragrance; 3.0 % other.
Further, 92.1 % are exposed to fragranced product at least
once a week, from others’ use: 57.9 % air fresheners and
deodorizers; 66.1 % personal care products; 54.8 % cleaning
supplies; 47.4 % laundry products; 52.3 % household prod-
ucts; 68.7 % fragrance; 3.2 % other.
Collectively, 99.1 % of the population are exposed to
fragranced products at least once a week from their own use,
others’ use, or both.
Health effects
Overall, 34.7 % of the population reported one or more types
of adverse health effects from exposure to one or more types
of fragranced products. The most common types of adverse
effects were as follows: 18.6 % respiratory problems; 16.2 %
mucosal symptoms; 15.7 % migraine headaches; 10.6 % skin
problems; 8.0 % asthma attacks; 7.2 % neurological problems;
5.8 % cognitive problems; 5.5 % gastrointestinal problems;
4.4 % cardiovascular problems; 4.0 % immune system prob-
lems; 3.8 % musculoskeletal problems; and 1.7 % other.
Of the 34.7 % of the population reporting adverse health
effects, 56.1 % are female and 43.9 % are male. Thus, propor-
tionately more females report adverse effects than males, rel-
ative to the general population (female 53.8 %, male 46.2 %).
Products and exposure situations that trigger adverse health
effects include the following:
Air fresheners and deodorizers: 20.4 % reported health
problems when exposed to air fresheners or deodorizers
(9.5 %, respiratory problems, 7.6 % mucosal symptoms,
7.2 % migraine headaches, 5.7 % skin problems, 4.7 % asth-
ma attacks, 3.2 % neurological problems, and others). This
compares to previous studies (Caress and Steinemann 2009)
that found 17.5 and 20.5 % of the population (in 2002–2003
and 2005–2006, respectively) reported headaches, breathing
difficulties, or other health problems when exposed to air
fresheners or deodorizers.
Scented laundry products vented outdoors: 12.5 % reported
health problems from the scent of laundry products coming
from a dryer vent (4.2 % mucosal symptoms, 4.0 % respira-
tory problems, 3.6 % skin problems, 3.3 % migraine head-
aches, 2.6 % gastrointestinal problems, 2.5 % asthma attacks,
and others). This compares to previous studies (Caress and
Steinemann 2009) that found 10.9 % of the population (in
2005–2006) reported headaches, breathing difficulties, or oth-
er health problems when exposed to the scent of laundry prod-
ucts vented outside.
Proximity to fragranced person: 23.6 % reported health
problems from being near someone who is wearing a
fragranced product (10.4 % respiratory problems, 8.6 %

 mucosal symptoms, 8.5 % migraine headaches, 3.9 % asthma
attacks, 3.6 % neurological problems, 3.4 % skin problems,
and others). This compares to previous studies (Caress and
Steinemann 2009) that found 31.1 and 29.9 % of the popula-
tion in (2002–2003 and 2005–2006, respectively) reported
headaches, breathing difficulties, or other health problems
when next to someone wearing a scented product.
Cleaning products: 19.7 % reported health problems from
being in a room after it has been cleaned with scented products
(9.6 %, respiratory problems, 7.3 % mucosal symptoms, 6.6 %
migraine headaches, 4.1 % neurological problems, 4.0 % asth-
ma attacks, 4.0 % skin problems, and others).
Severity of the health problems resulting from exposure to
one or more types of fragranced products was investigated,
using the language from the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA 1990) to determine disability: “Do any of these health
problems substantially limit one or more major life activities,
such as seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing,
lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, con-
centrating, thinking, communicating, or working, for you per-
sonally?” Of the general population, 17.2 % reported yes,
indicating that the severity of effects from fragranced product
exposure was potentially disabling.
Ingredient disclosure and product claims
Fragranced products (even ones called green or organic) emit
a range of volatile organic compounds, including hazardous
air pollutants, but relatively few are disclosed to the public
(Steinemann 2015).
Of the general population surveyed, 46.4 % were not aware
that a “fragrance” in a product is typically a chemical mixture
of several dozen to several hundred chemicals, and 64.6 %
were not aware that fragrance chemicals do not need to be
fully disclosed on the product label or material safety data
sheet. Further, 67.3 % were not aware that fragranced products
typically emit hazardous air pollutants such as formaldehyde,
and 72.6 % were not aware that even so-called natural, green,
and organic fragranced products typically emit hazardous air
pollutants. However, 60.1 % would not still use a fragranced
product if they knew it emitted hazardous air pollutants.
Societal and workplace effects
Use of fragranced products in society can lead to a range of
perhaps unintended yet serious consequences. Of the general
population, 17.5 % are unable or reluctant to use the toilets in a
public place, because of the presence of an air freshener, de-
odorizer, or scented product. Also, 14.1 % are unable or re-
luctant to wash their hands with soap in a public place, be-
cause they know or suspect that the soap is fragranced.
Further, 22.7 % have been prevented from going to some
place because they would be exposed to a fragranced product
that would make them sick.
Significantly, 15.1 % of the general population reported
that exposure to fragranced products in their work environ-
ment has caused them to become sick, lose workdays, or lose a
job. Also, 20.2 % of the population reported that if they enter a
business, and smell air fresheners or some fragranced product,
they want to leave as quickly as possible.
Fragrance-free policies receive a strong majority of sup-
port. Of the population surveyed, 53.2 % would be supportive
of a fragrance-free policy in the workplace (compared to
19.7 % that would not). Thus, 2.7 times more people would
vote yes for a fragrance-free workplace than not. Also, 54.8 %
would prefer that health care facilities and health care profes-
sionals be fragrance-free (compared to 22.4 % that would not).
Thus, nearly 2.5 times more people would vote yes for
fragrance-free health care facilities and professionals than not.
Public venues and businesses such as airplanes and hotels
have been pursuing a trend of scent branding, or dispersing
fragranced air through their indoor environments. However,
customers may not necessarily prefer scented air.
If given a choice between flying on an airplane that
pumped scented air throughout the passenger cabin, or did
not pump scented air throughout the passenger cabin,
59.2 % would choose an airplane without scented air (com-
pared to 23.6 % with scented air). Thus, over 2.5 times more
passengers would prefer an airplane without scented air than
with scented air. Similarly, if given a choice between staying
in a hotel with fragranced air, or without fragranced air,
55.5 % would choose a hotel without fragranced air (com-
pared to 27.8 % with fragranced air). Thus, about two times
more hotel guests would choose a hotel without fragranced air
than with fragranced air.
Discussion
Fragranced product emissions can affect not only indoor air
quality but also human health, workplace productivity, and
societal wellbeing. Results from this study reveal that over
one third of Americans suffer adverse health effects, such as
respiratory difficulties and migraine headaches, from expo-
sure to fragranced products. Of those individuals, half report-
ed that the effects can be disabling. Yet over 99 % of
Americans are exposed to fragranced products at least once
a week, from their own or others’ use.
Many exposure situations are involuntary, such as air fresh-
eners and deodorizers used in public toilets and elsewhere
(20.4 % of the population reported health problems from ex-
posure), scented laundry products vented outdoors (12.5 %
reported health problems), being in a room after it was cleaned
with scented products (19.7 % reported health problems), be-
ing near someone wearing a fragranced product (23.6 %
864
Air Qual Atmos Health (2016) 9:861–866
 reported health problems), along with workplaces, health care
facilities, hotels and airplanes with fragranced air environ-
ments. A strong majority (at least twice as many individuals
in support than not, in all cases surveyed) prefer that indoor
environments and people would not be fragranced.
Fragranced products also restrict access in society. Of the
general population, 17.5 % were unable to use toilets in public
places because of air fresheners or deodorizers, 14.1 % were
unable to wash their hands with soap in public places because
of fragranced soap, and 22.7 % were unable to go someplace
because of the presence of a fragranced product.
Moreover, fragranced product exposures have economic
implications. Of those surveyed, 20.2 % would enter but then
leave a business as quickly as possible if they smell fragranced
products, and 15.1 % have lost workdays or a job due to
fragranced product exposures in the workplace.
Importantly, adverse effects resulting from exposure to
fragranced products, such as in workplaces and public places,
raise concerns about liability. For instance, individuals can
suffer acute health effects, such as an asthma attack, if they
enter a restroom that uses air fresheners. If they are unable to
access a restroom due to the presence of an air freshener, then
that poses a potential violation of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
Fragranced product manufacturers are not required to dis-
close all ingredients in their formulations. This lack of disclo-
sure can impede efforts to understand and reduce adverse ef-
fects associated with potentially harmful compounds, such as
certain volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic
compounds. Further, we lack knowledge on which specific
chemicals or mixtures of chemicals are associated with the
adverse effects, and this is an important area for research.
Limitations of the study include the following: (a) data
were based on self-reports, a standard method for survey re-
search with both strengths and shortcomings, (b) all possible
products and health effects were not included, although the
low percentages for responses in the “other” category indi-
cates the survey captured the primary products and effects,
and (c) given the nature of the survey, it was not possible to
measure emissions and exposures directly for each
respondent.
Results of this study provide compelling evidence that ev-
eryday fragranced products can impose serious risks to human
health, environmental quality, businesses, and society. Future
research can be directed to understanding the types of product
ingredients and emissions that are problematic for exposures
and health effects, and ways to reduce the impacts. In the
meantime, a solution to effectively reduce risks is to avoid,
restrict, or reduce the use of fragranced products.
