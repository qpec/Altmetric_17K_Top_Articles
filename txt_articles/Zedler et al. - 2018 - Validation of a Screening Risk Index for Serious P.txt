Abstract
Objective. To validate a risk index that estimates
the
likelihood
of
overdose
or
serious
opioid-
induced respiratory depression (OIRD) among med-
ical users of prescription opioids.
Subjects and Methods. A case-control analysis of
18,365,497 patients with an opioid prescription from
2009 to 2013 in the IMS PharMetrics Plus commercially
insured health plan claims database (CIP). An OIRD
event occurred in 7,234 cases. Four controls were se-
lected per case. Validity of the Risk Index for Overdose
or Serious Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression
(RIOSORD), developed previously using Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) patient data, was as-
sessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used
within the CIP study population to develop a slightly
refined RIOSORD. The composition and performance
of the CIP-based RIOSORD was evaluated and com-
pared with VHA-based RIOSORD.
Results. VHA-RIOSORD performed well in discrimi-
nating OIRD events in CIP (C-statistic 5 0.85).
Additionally, re-estimation of logistic model coeffi-
cients in CIP yielded a 0.90 C-statistic. The resulting
comorbidity and pharmacotherapy variables most
highly associated with OIRD and retained in the
CIP-RIOSORD were largely concordant with VHA-
RIOSORD. These variables included neuropsychi-
atric and cardiopulmonary disorders, impaired drug
excretion, opioid characteristics, and concurrent
psychoactive medications. The average predicted
probability of OIRD ranged from 2% to 83%, with ex-
cellent agreement between predicted and observed
incidence across risk classes.
Conclusions. RIOSORD had excellent predictive accur-
acy in a large population of US medical users of pre-
scription opioids, similar to its performance in VHA.
This practical risk index is designed to support clinical
decision-making for safer opioid prescribing, and its
clinical utility should be evaluated prospectively.

 Introduction
Prescription opioid sales and consumption have quad-
rupled in the United States since 1999, primarily due to
a substantial expansion in the prescription of opioid an-
algesics to manage diverse types of pain conditions
[1–5]. Deaths from prescription opioid poisoning or over-
dose have increased in near parallel proportions, from
4,030 in 1999 to more than 14,000 in 2014 and they
exceeded 15,000 in 2015 (US death statistics involving
prescription opioids exclude non-methadone synthetic
opioids [e.g., fentanyl, tramadol] from 2014 onwards
due to a sharp surge in deaths involving synthetic opi-
oids that is driven largely by illicitly manufactured fen-
tanyl,
which
is
indistinguishable
from
prescription
fentanyl as a cause of death on death certificates)
[6,7,8]. Approximately 80% of fatal overdoses are con-
sidered
unintentional
[9].
Morbidity
associated
with
increased opioid prescribing is reflected in increased
emergency department (ED) visits for serious opioid-
induced respiratory depression (OIRD) and subsequent
hospitalization [2,5,10–12].
The life-threatening manifestation of opioid overdose is
central respiratory depression, which can result in re-
spiratory arrest and be presaged by profound central
nervous system (CNS) depression [13,14]. No vali-
dated tools are currently available to estimate the risk
of
experiencing
the
most
serious
opioid-related
adverse
consequence,
life-threatening
OIRD
[3].
Therefore, in prior work, we developed a pilot screen-
ing risk index to predict a patient’s likelihood of experi-
encing overdose or serious opioid-induced respiratory
depression (RIOSORD) and to characterize their asso-
ciated risk factor profile [15,16]. This information, pro-
vided by a clinically practical, evidence-based risk
index,
can
support
personalized
clinical
decision-
making, including preventive interventions, for safer
opioid prescribing.
To develop the screening instrument, we conducted a
retrospective case-control study using administrative
health care data from almost 1.9 million US Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) patients who were dis-
pensed an opioid during 2010 to 2012 [15]. Risk fac-
tors during the previous six months were identified
among 817 cases who experienced an OIRD event and
8,170 controls who did not. Predictors included demo-
graphic variables, health conditions, and prescription
drug and health care utilization factors. The index was
then created with 15 of the variables most strongly
associated with experiencing a life-threatening opioid
emergency [16]. Risk classes determined from the pre-
dicted probability distribution indicated excellent pre-
dictive validity for OIRD in the VHA population. The
objective of the current study was to assess, validate,
and refine RIOSORD in a larger, non-VHA population
more representative of US medical users of prescription
opioids.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This
nested
case-control
study
utilized
a
limited
PharMetrics Plus data set from the IMS Health Real-
World
Data
Adjudicated
Claims–US
Database
(IMS
Health Incorporated, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). This
health plan claims database comprises fully adjudicated
medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment information
on over 115 million unique, de-identified individuals since
2006. The database’s health plans are largely commer-
cial and from self-insured employer groups; a small set of
commercial Medicare and Medicaid patients is also
included (communication with data vendor, December 5,
2016). This study, which used a limited data set, was re-
viewed by the Western Institutional Review Board (IRB)
and was determined to be exempt from full review.
Study Sample and Participants
The study population included 18,365,497 patients in
the commercially insured health plan (CIP) database
with at least one opioid pharmacy claim between
January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013, excluding
opioid-containing cough/cold products. Among patients
with nonmissing age and sex values, we identified a co-
hort of patients who experienced prescription OIRD as
determined by an algorithm developed in our prior work
(see Supplementary Table 1) [16]. Using codes in the
International Classification
of Disease, 9th Revision,
Clinical
Modification
(ICD-9-CM)
[17]
and
Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) for critical care proced-
ures [18], an OIRD event was defined by a listed code
for prescription opioid poisoning plus a code for either a
life-threatening respiratory or CNS adverse effect or
mechanical ventilation or critical care. OIRD events that
involved poisoning codes exclusively related to heroin
were excluded. In patients with more than one OIRD
event during the study period, only the first (index) event
was analyzed. Four controls were randomly selected
per case and assigned the case’s index date. Neither
matching nor control replacement was used. Eligible pa-
tients had nonmissing age and sex values and continu-
ous medical and pharmacy benefits for the six-month
baseline period before the index date. One case that
occurred near the beginning of the study period could
not be assigned controls due to insufficient six-month
baseline data. Among patients meeting eligibility criteria,
7,234 cases were identified and 28,932 controls were
thus assigned, for a total study sample of 36,166.
Variables
The dependent variable of interest was the index OIRD
event. Independent variables assessed during the six
months before the index date included demographic fac-
tors;
the
component
comorbidities
of
the
Charlson
Comorbidity Index [19–21]; other selected pain- and non-
pain-related health conditions [22,23]; prescription medi-
cation information, including opioid active ingredient,

 formulation, and maximum prescribed daily morphine
equivalent dose (MED) [24,25], as well as selected
nonopioid medications that may impact serious adverse
opioid effects (nonopioid analgesics, benzodiazepines,
antidepressants, muscle relaxants, other sedatives, anti-
psychotics, and stimulants); and metrics indicative of
health care utilization [15].
Variables in this CIP validation study were used exactly as
or constructed as closely as possible to those used in the
VHA development study [16]. Some modifications were
required to accommodate inherent differences between
the disparate data sources. For example, the CIP data
lacked
adequate
information
regarding
race/ethnicity,
marital status, body mass index, and motor vehicle acci-
dents, but included additional details on the route of opi-
oid administration. These additional routes (sublingual,
buccal, nasal, and rectal) were characterized for descrip-
tive purposes, but route was dichotomized for multivari-
able analysis (oral and nonoral). To facilitate clinical utility,
MED was collapsed into a dichotomous variable for the
CIP analysis (<100mg/day and �100 mg/day). The “opi-
oid dependence” and “substance abuse and nonopioid
dependence” variables were combined into a single “sub-
stance use disorder” (SUD) variable in CIP, consistent with
the updated definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) [26].
Statistical Methods
Characterization of the CIP Study Population
Univariate statistics were calculated to characterize the CIP
study population. Bivariate statistics assessed differences
between cases and controls. Continuous variables of inter-
est that were not normally distributed were compared
using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Chi-square tests were
used to compare proportions of categorical variables.
Validation of VHA-RIOSORD in the CIP Study
Population
The performance of the pilot RIOSORD, initially de-
veloped in the VHA study population, was then as-
sessed
in
the
CIP
study
population.
VHA-based
RIOSORD scores were calculated for all cases and con-
trols in the CIP sample, and a risk class model was fit
[27] to estimate the predicted probability of experiencing
an
OIRD
event
based
on
the
risk
index
scores.
Performance of the VHA-based RIOSORD was as-
sessed using the risk class model C-statistic and by
comparing the predicted probabilities of OIRD events
with observed occurrences in the CIP study population.
Refinement of VHA-RIOSORD Using CIP Data
Thereafter, given the inherent differences between the
VHA and CIP populations (e.g., sex, age distribution,
and
prevalence
of
certain
health
conditions
[see
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3], as detailed elsewhere
[28]) and relevant health care system practices (e.g.,
drug formularies and clinical management), the VHA-
based risk index was refined and evaluated using the
CIP data. Multiple logistic regression was used to exam-
ine predictors of OIRD using the CIP data, starting with
the variables included in the original VHA-RIOSORD lo-
gistic regression model. While clinical judgment was
used to guide initial variable inclusion, final variable se-
lection was determined by eliminating variables with
P values greater than 0.10 from the model sequentially
unless they were identified as confounders (i.e., removal
from the model resulted in a 20% or greater change in
parameter estimates for one or more of the other vari-
ables when compared with the original model). This final
model
developed
using
the
CIP
data
was
then
compared with the model initially developed using VHA
data; it is presented in the Results section.
The refined RIOSORD logistic regression model was
then used to select and assign point values for the
items included in a CIP-based RIOSORD. Items in the
final CIP-based risk index were selected from those ini-
tially included in VHA-RIOSORD and from the logistic
model variables clinically and statistically significantly
associated with an OIRD event in the CIP study popula-
tion.
Overarching
considerations
for
item
selection
included 1) statistical strength of association; 2) pub-
lished research reports of a consistent association be-
tween the variable and OIRD; and 3) feasibility of a
health care professional in a busy clinical setting readily
obtaining valid information for all index items from the
patient’s medical record or chart.
Le Gall’s methods were used to calculate point values
for items in the risk index [27]. Each item’s regression-
generated
b
coefficient
was
multiplied
by
10
and
rounded to the nearest integer. The item point values
were then summed for each patient, yielding the risk
index score [27,29]. A multiple logistic regression model
then used the patients’ RIOSORD scores, with OIRD as
the outcome variable, to produce predicted probabilities
of the
outcome occurring
during the following six
months [27,29]. A transformation was used in the logis-
tic regression model to reduce the skewness of the risk
index scores and improve model calibration [25,26]. The
logistic regression formula used was
Logit ¼ b0 þ b1X1 þ b2X2
with
X1¼ the
risk
index
score
and
X2 ¼ ln(risk
score þ 100), with ln indicating natural logarithm [27,29].
Model performance was assessed with the Hosmer-
Lemeshow test for overall model goodness of fit and re-
ceiver operating curves and corresponding C-statistics
for model discrimination between patients with and
without the outcome. Finally, to test the predictive valid-
ity of the risk index, the distribution of predicted proba-
bilities was compared by percentiles (risk classes) with
Zedler et al.

 the observed occurrence of OIRD in the CIP study
population. Patient count, average predicted probability
of the outcome, and observed incidence of events were
computed for each risk class. All statistical analyses
were conducted in SAS v. 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Characteristics of the CIP sample and comparisons be-
tween cases and controls are shown in Supplementary
Table 2 and described in detail elsewhere [28]. Given the
nature of the two data sources (commercial health insur-
ance vs an integrated governmental health care system),
it is not surprising that the CIP and VHA samples differed
substantially in proportions of many variables of interest
(see
Supplementary
Table
3).
Importantly,
CIP
had
greater representation of females and younger patients.
VHA-RIOSORD Performance in CIP Data
RIOSORD, as originally developed using VHA data, was
assessed in the CIP sample without modification except
as necessary to accommodate four variables that were
largely unavailable in CIP. VHA-based RIOSORD scores
were calculated for all cases and controls in the CIP sam-
ple, and a risk class model was fit [27] to estimate the pre-
dicted probability of an OIRD event based on the risk index
scores. The VHA-based risk class model’s C-statistic was
0.85 in CIP data compared with 0.88 in VHA data [16],
indicating consistently good discrimination between pa-
tients with and without an OIRD event in both study popu-
lations using the patients’ VHA-based RIOSORD scores.
Furthermore, when divided into risk classes based on pre-
dicted probabilities, the observed incidence of OIRD
events in each risk class agreed well with that expected
based on predicted probabilities (Table 1).
Multivariable Logistic Regression in CIP Data
Due to the inherent differences between the VHA and
CIP populations (e.g., demographics and prevalence of
comorbidities) and differences in drug formularies and
clinical management practices between the health care
systems, the VHA-based risk index was then refined
and evaluated using the CIP data. Starting with the
variables included in the original VHA risk index model,
modifications included collapsing four MED strata into
a dichotomous variable (<100 mg/day and �100 mg/
day) and combining “opioid dependence” and “sub-
stance abuse and nonopioid dependence” into a single
“substance use disorder” (SUD) variable [26]. Final vari-
ables were selected from the updated set, and corres-
ponding
coefficient
estimates
were
calculated
via
multivariable logistic regression to yield a model using
CIP data only (Table 2). OIRD predictors were largely
concordant between the VHA [16] and CIP study
populations.
The single factor most strongly associated with OIRD
in the CIP study population was a SUD diagnosis at a
health care encounter during the six months before
the index event. Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and
cerebrovascular
disease
were
strongly
associated
with increased odds of OIRD and recurrent headache
was a moderate predictor. Other strongly associated
comorbidities included renal disease, heart failure,
and nonmalignant pancreatic disease. Chronic pul-
monary disease and sleep apnea were moderate risk
factors.
The prescription opioids that were most strongly associ-
ated with OIRD (Table 2) were fentanyl, morphine, and
methadone. Hydromorphone, oxycodone, hydrocodone,

 and tramadol prescriptions, as well as maximum pre-
scribed daily MED of 100 mg or greater and extended-
release/long-acting (ER/LA) formulation, were moderate
predictors of an OIRD event. Concurrent benzodiazep-
ine or antidepressant prescription strongly increased the
likelihood of experiencing OIRD.
The likelihood of experiencing OIRD was greater in pa-
tients age 55 years or older and in those with increased
health care utilization in the six months before the index
date,

CIP-RIOSORD Performance in CIP Data
After refining the original VHA-based model using CIP
data (CIP-based model), the statistically significant cor-
relates remaining in the final model that were retained
as items in the CIP-RIOSORD are shown in Table 3.
Table 4 shows the CIP-based risk classes with corres-
ponding ranges of CIP-RIOSORD scores and com-
pares the average predicted probability for each risk
class with the corresponding observed incidence of
OIRD. Based on risk factors active during the six
months before the index date, the average predicted
probability of an event ranged from 2% in the lowest
risk class to 83% in the highest, and the actual occur-
rence of an event increased commensurately. The CIP-
based risk class model’s C-statistic in CIP data was 0.90,
indicating an excellent discrimination of 90% between pa-
tients with and without an event, and was similar to, al-
though somewhat better than, the VHA-based risk class
model’s performance in CIP data (C-statistic ¼ 0.85)
(Table 1).
Discussion
Validation of RIOSORD
RIOSORD had excellent predictive accuracy in a retro-
spective validation in a large commercial health plan
database, similar to its performance of nearly 90% ac-
curate discrimination in the VHA database in which it
was developed. RIOSORD is the first known screening
tool for the risk of opioid overdose. It is designed to
support clinical decision-making and safer opioid pre-
scribing. It provides an evidence-based, real-time, quan-
titative estimate of a patient’s likelihood of experiencing
a life-threatening opioid emergency in the next six
months and also characterizes the patient’s specific risk
factor profile.
This external validation study confirmed that several
well-accepted risk factors for fatal opioid overdose were
also strong predictors for largely nonfatal OIRD events.
The strongest OIRD predictors in the CIP sample were
selected
health
conditions
and
prescription
drug
characteristics. These factors were largely consistent

* A serious prescription opioid–related respiratory or central nervous system (CNS) depression event was defined as a listed opi-
oid poisoning or external cause code occurring within 61 day of a listed 1) CNS or respiratory adverse effect code or 2) mechan-
ical ventilation or critical care code. All primary and nonprimary codes were considered.
† The multivariable logistic regression model includes all variables retained at a P value of less than 0.10 as well as all variables
considered to be confounders (i.e., removal from the model resulted in a 20% or greater change in parameter estimates for one
or more of the other variables). All of these variables are presented in this table and summarize the output from the model in
which they were simultaneously tested.
‡ Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were combined into one variable, “bipolar disorder/schizophrenia,” for multivariable
modeling.
§ Missing opioid formulation (ER/LA), route, and MED information were analyzed in the reference group in regression modeling.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of this and found no appreciable difference between such models
relative to those in which the missing data were excluded.

 between the VHA and CIP samples despite substantial
differences between the source populations; both are
discussed in detail elsewhere [28]. Several of the differ-
ences between the two populations and health care
systems made it important to examine and refine the
risk model based on the CIP data, rather than stopping
with the VHA-derived model deployed in the CIP data.
This refinement enabled the development of a risk class
model based on the CIP population, which is more rep-
resentative than the VHA of US medical users of pre-
scription opioids, and allowed subsequent comparison
with the original VHA-derived model. There was modest
improvement in performance (C-statistic ¼ 0.90 vs 0.85)
between the CIP-based risk class model in the CIP data
and the original VHA-derived risk class model in the CIP
data. Thus, the CIP-RIOSORD is appropriate, and prob-
ably preferred, for general use, as it accounts for a
population more generalizable for US patients treated
with prescription opioids, more diverse drug formularies,
and a broader range of clinical practice than the VHA.
Nonetheless, additional evaluation will be required to de-
termine which model performs best in any specific clin-
ical setting.
Intended Use and Application of Results in the Clinical
Setting
RIOSORD was designed and intended to fill a practical
need for a relatively brief screening instrument with opti-
mum simplicity and predictive validity in a typically busy
clinical practice. Its excellent predictive accuracy is pre-
dicated, in part, on complete and accurate responses
to queries about active clinical conditions and details of
currently prescribed medications. RIOSORD is intended
for completion and interpretation by a health care

Question*
Points for “yes”
response
In the past 6 months, has the patient had a health care visit (outpatient, inpatient, or ED) involving any of the following
health conditions?†
• Substance use disorder (abuse or dependence)?
25
(This includes alcohol, amphetamines, antidepressants, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, opioids, and
sedatives/anxiolytics)
• Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?
10
• Stroke or other cerebrovascular disease?
9
• Kidney disease with clinically significant renal impairment?
8
• Heart failure?
7
• Nonmalignant pancreatic disease (e.g., acute or chronic pancreatitis)?
7
• Chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, pneumoconiosis,
asbestosis)?
5
• Recurrent headache (e.g., migraine)?
5
Does the patient consume:
• Fentanyl?
13
• Morphine?
11
• Methadone?
10
• Hydromorphone?
7
• An extended-release or long-acting formulation of any prescription opioid?‡
5
• A prescription benzodiazepine?
9
• A prescription antidepressant?
8
Is the patient’s current maximum prescribed opioid dose �100 mg morphine equivalents per day?
(Include all prescription opioids consumed on a regular basis)
7
Total point score (maximum ¼ 146)
* This questionnaire is intended to be completed and interpreted by a health care professional. It is not a replacement for clinical
judgment and is intended to guide and inform clinical decision-making in patients who are treated with opioids.
† The condition does not have to be the primary reason for the visit, but it should be entered in the chart or electronic health re-
cord as one of the reasons or diagnoses for the visit.
‡ Extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) formulation and certain opioid active ingredients were significantly and independently
associated with the likelihood of overdose in the model. As such, ER/LA and each active ingredient are included and scored as
independent factors in the risk index. For example, a fentanyl ER formulation or methadone receives RIOSORD risk points for
both the active ingredient and the ER/LA formulation. A short-acting fentanyl receives points for the active ingredient only. ER/LA
risk points are counted only once, regardless of the number of ER/LA opioid products that the patient consumes.

 professional familiar with the patient’s medical history or
using the patient’s medical record.
Risk calculators are commonly used in clinical practice
to estimate the likelihood of an adverse outcome asso-
ciated with an intervention [29–32]. An accurate, individ-
ualized risk estimate and risk factor profile can enhance
and simplify a patient-centered informed consent pro-
cess, which involves informing the patient about the
risks and benefits of a proposed treatment [33–35].
Valid risk stratification may facilitate more rational priori-
tization of preventive interventions and limited clinical re-
sources to patients identified as having elevated risk
who are likely to benefit most [36,37]. Modifiable elem-
ents identified in the RIOSORD risk factor profile can be
specifically targeted for mitigation. Improved control of
even chronic conditions such as pulmonary and mental
health disorders can reduce their impact on the likeli-
hood of experiencing OIRD. A baseline risk score can
be calculated before initiating opioid treatment and re-
assessed and tracked longitudinally during chronic opi-
oid treatment to evaluate fluctuations in risk level in
response to introducing interventions or changes in the
patient’s
clinical
condition
or
treatment
regimen.
Preventive and potentially life-saving interventions and
recommended precautions in all opioid-treated patients
include heightened caution when selecting opioids and
escalating dosage, comanagement with addiction, men-
tal health or pain specialists as indicated, patient and
caregiver education and awareness, high vigilance for
known risk factors and manifestations of OIRD, and, in
opioid emergencies, timely resuscitation and administra-
tion of the opioid reversal agent naloxone, such as the
take-home formulations that are approved for use in
nonmedical settings [13,34,38–40]. Primary care profes-
sionals express concern about opioid analgesic misuse
and iatrogenic addiction and find managing patients
with chronic pain to be stressful [41]. More than half feel
that they are inadequately trained in prescribing opioids
and treating/managing opioid use disorder [42]. Use of
RIOSORD creates a uniquely practical opportunity for
recurring education and reinforcement of evidence-
based best practices to frontline health care profes-
sionals regarding comprehensive pain management and
opioid prescribing.
Strengths and Limitations
An important strength of this validation study is use of
the largest known sample of prescription opioid-related
overdose cases and controls. Further, RIOSORD’s con-
sistently high level of predictive accuracy in two of the
largest national claims databases, which represent dis-
parate and independent populations (privately vs pub-
licly insured), reinforces its likely external generalizability
to other US populations.
Nonetheless,
some
important
limitations
should
be
noted. First, administrative health care data do not cap-
ture all known predictors, such as behavioral and social
characteristics, family history and genotype, medication
adherence, medications obtained from other sources, il-
licit substance use, and specifics regarding the indica-
tion
for
prescribing
an
opioid
(e.g.,
analgesia
vs
medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder) or
nonopioid medication. As such, RIOSORD may be sub-
ject to residual confounding. Additionally, administrative
data are subject to missing or incomplete data, coding
errors, and misclassification. Finally, the OIRD outcome
is defined by an administrative health care coding algo-
rithm whose clinical validation using linked medical re-
cords is planned but not yet completed. Of note, an
analysis of administrative database research studies
found that only 12% of studies using diagnostic codes

istical association of the coding definition with the clin-
ical concept that it was intended to represent (i.e.,
clinical validation) [43].
Conclusion
RIOSORD is a novel, evidence-based, statistically robust
decision support tool designed to provide an individual-
ized, quantitative estimate of the risk of and risk factor
profile
for
a
life-threatening
respiratory/CNS
opioid
emergency among patients prescribed opioids. The ex-
cellent predictive accuracy of the pilot (VHA) version of
RIOSORD was validated retrospectively in a US popula-
tion of approximately 18 million medical users of pre-
scription opioids. RIOSORD’s predictive accuracy and
clinical utility should be evaluated prospectively under
real-world conditions. Additional insights regarding the
mechanism(s) by which each identified risk factor en-
hances risk and refinements to improve RIOSORD’s
performance may result from its examination in clinically
important subgroups or by assessment of interactions
among risk factors. Examples include age groups, sex,
patients with certain concurrent health conditions (e.g.,
mental health disorders or SUD) or medications (e.g.,
benzodiazepines), overdose outcome (fatal vs nonfatal),
opioid indication (e.g., pain vs medication-assisted treat-
ment of opioid use disorder), and duration and regularity
of opioid use. Finally, integration of RIOSORD within the
electronic health record can facilitate automated risk cal-
culation and longitudinal tracking and provide individual-
ized information to support point-of-care decision-making
and recurring education of health care professionals re-
garding OIRD risk mitigation.
