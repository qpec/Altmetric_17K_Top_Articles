ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess the impact of communicating DNA based 
disease risk estimates on risk-reducing health 
behaviours and motivation to engage in such 
behaviours.
Design
Systematic review with meta-analysis, using Cochrane 
methods.
Data sOurCes
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 25 
February 2015. Backward and forward citation searches 
were also conducted.
stuDy seleCtiOn
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials 
involving adults in which one group received 
personalised DNA based estimates of disease risk for 
conditions where risk could be reduced by behaviour 
change. Eligible studies included a measure of 
risk-reducing behaviour.
results
We examined 10 515 abstracts and included 18 studies 
that reported on seven behavioural outcomes, 
including smoking cessation (six studies; n=2663), 
diet (seven studies; n=1784), and physical activity (six 
studies; n=1704). Meta-analysis revealed no 
significant effects of communicating DNA based risk 
estimates on smoking cessation (odds ratio 0.92, 95% 
confidence interval 0.63 to 1.35, P=0.67), diet 
(standardised mean difference 0.12, 95% confidence 
interval −0.00 to 0.24, P=0.05), or physical activity 
(standardised mean difference −0.03, 95% confidence 
interval −0.13 to 0.08, P=0.62). There were also no 
effects on any other behaviours (alcohol use, 
medication use, sun protection behaviours, and 
attendance at screening or behavioural support 
programmes) or on motivation to change behaviour, 
and no adverse effects, such as depression and 
anxiety. Subgroup analyses provided no clear evidence 
that communication of a risk-conferring genotype 
affected behaviour more than communication of the 
absence of such a genotype. However, studies were 
predominantly at high or unclear risk of bias, and 
evidence was typically of low quality.
COnClusiOns
Expectations that communicating DNA based risk 
estimates changes behaviour is not supported by 
existing evidence. These results do not support use of 
genetic testing or the search for risk-conferring gene 
variants for common complex diseases on the basis 
that they motivate risk-reducing behaviour.
systematiC review registratiOn
This is a revised and updated version of a Cochrane 
review from 2010, adding 11 studies to the seven 
previously identified.
Introduction
Searching for gene variants associated with risks of 
common complex conditions, including diabetes and 
various cancers, continues to receive considerable 
attention.1 
2 Although the main target of such research is 
more effective treatments, more precise prediction of 
disease has also been anticipated. Less attention has 
been given to evaluating whether health benefits, in 
particular risk-reducing changes in behaviour, can be 
realised through communicating the results of such 
predictions. For example, does communicating to 
smokers that they have an increased genetic risk of 
developing lung cancer motivate smoking cessation, or 
does telling middle aged people that they have an 
increased genetic risk of developing diabetes motivate 
increased physical activity to reduce this risk? These are 
particularly timely questions, given high levels of inter-
est in personalised medicine and in direct-to-consumer 
testing. More than 10 years ago, direct-to-consumer 
tests for a range of common complex disorders were 
rushed to market. These tests continue to be sold in 
Canada, the United Kingdom, and other European 
countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Nether-
lands, Sweden, and Ireland (www.23andme.com/
en-gb/health/; www.23andme.com/en-eu/), with con-
tinued international expansion likely. In the United 
States, expansion was tempered in 2013 when the Food 
and Drug Administration ordered the company 
23andme to stop selling its testing kits because of con-
cerns about their accuracy and usefulness, but as of 
October 2015 the company has resumed selling some

Genetic testing is being increasingly used in a growing number of healthcare 
settings and in direct-to-consumer testing for a range of common complex disorders
There is an expectation that communicating DNA based disease risk estimates will 
motivate changes in key health behaviours, including smoking, diet, and physical 
activity
There is a need for a rigorous systematic review to examine whether communicating 
genetic risks does indeed motivate risk-reducing behaviour change
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
The results of this updated systematic review with meta-analysis using Cochrane 
methods suggest that communicating DNA based disease risk estimates has little 
or no impact on risk-reducing health behaviour
Existing evidence does not support expectations that such interventions could play 
a major role in motivating behaviour change to improve population health

health related services. Regulatory systems in the USA 
are now being developed to ensure public protection in 
anticipation of rapid developments in precision medi-
cine, including increased commercial interests in 
direct-to-consumer genomic testing.3
As the science develops, it is increasingly possible to 
provide information about multiple single genes, each 
relating to different disease risks, and also to aggregate 
multiple risk loci and identify patterns of characteris-
tics across multiple genes that in combination confer 
increased risks of one or more diseases. However, DNA 
based disease risk estimates will only translate into 
health benefits if acting on them modifies disease 
 
outcomes, and if those informed of these genetic risks 
undertake the relevant actions.
Three competing predictions on the effect of commu-
nicating DNA based disease risks are evident in the lit-
erature. Firstly, communicating DNA based risk 
estimates, particularly if based on the detection of 
risk-conferring mutations, motivates behaviour change 
more strongly than does communicating risks of dis-
ease derived from other types of risk information.4-7 
 
This is consistent with theories of attitude change, 
which suggest that the greater the personal salience of 
information, such as that regarding one’s own DNA, the 
greater the impact.8  Secondly, communicating DNA 
based disease risk estimates demotivates behaviour 
change.9  This is based on the observation that diseases 
considered to have a genetic basis are perceived as less 
controllable,10  and using DNA to estimate disease risks 
may lead to a sense of fatalism or lack of control over 
the ability to improve outcomes.11  Finally, communicat-
ing such information is likely to have, at best, only a 
small effect on behaviour. This is based on review evi-
dence showing that perceptions of disease risk exert, at 
most, only a small influence on behaviour,12  and that 
communicating the results of a wide range of biomarker 
tests has no consistent effect on behaviour.13 
14
Several narrative reviews have been conducted 
assessing the emotional and behavioural outcomes of 
communicating DNA based disease risk estimates15-18 
 
and the outcomes of genetic health services for com-
mon adult onset conditions.19  However, these reviews 
identified few clinical studies using randomised 
designs to assess effects on behaviour and did not 
include quantitative syntheses of effects. Although sys-
tematic reviews have been conducted more recently, 
these have focused on single behaviours such as 
smoking cessation.20 21  We assessed the impact of 
communicating DNA based disease risk estimates on 
risk-reducing behaviours and motivation to undertake 
such behaviours. We also examined whether communi-
cating the presence of a risk-conferring genotype would 
elicit a stronger (and potentially counteractive) motiva-
tional response than communicating its absence.22
There are high expectations that advances in genetics 
will usher in a new era of personalised medicine, and 
that because communicating genetic risks will motivate 
risk-reducing behaviour changes, such communication 
has a role in risk reduction strategies aimed at improv-
ing population health.23  The results of this review will 
inform debates about the role of genetic testing in pub-
lic health policies. The findings will also contribute to 
the evidence base on the behavioural impact of commu-
nicating risks of disease based on a wide range of bio-
logical markers, of which DNA is but one.13

Methods
This is a revised and updated version of a Cochrane 
review from 2010,25  adding 11 studies to the seven previ-
ously identified. The methods are described in detail 
elsewhere.25
Data sources
We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 
25 February 2015. Backward and forward citation 
searches were also conducted from included studies. 
Appendix 1 details the Medline search strategy.
inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be eligible, studies had to be randomised controlled 
trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials (controlled 
trials using a non-random method of allocation to study 
arm, such as alternation or by date of birth), have 
recruited adult populations (≥18 years), and include 
one group that received personalised DNA based risk 
estimates for diseases for which behaviour change 
could reduce risk (including heart disease, cancers, and 
Alzheimer’s disease). We excluded studies that evalu-
ated the communication of DNA based risk estimates of 
diseases for which there is no known intervention to 
reduce that risk, such as Huntington’s disease.
The studies assessed the effects of the intervention 
relative to the effects of communicating non-DNA 
based disease risk estimates (assessment based on 
family history, biological markers of disease, personal 
characteristics, or a combination thereof) or of commu-
nicating no disease risk estimates. Included studies 
therefore formed three main groups, defined by differ-
ences in the intervention and comparison groups: dis-
ease risk estimates based on DNA versus non-DNA 
based disease risk estimates; disease risk estimates 
based on DNA plus non-DNA based disease risk esti-
mates versus only non-DNA based disease risk esti-
mates; or disease risk estimates based on DNA versus 
no disease risk estimates.
The primary outcome was performance of a 
behaviour that could reduce the risk of disease. 
Behaviours included smoking, alcohol consumption, 
diet, and physical activity. We only included studies 
that measured at least one of the primary outcomes. 
Secondary outcomes were motivation to change 
behaviour and levels of depression and anxiety.
Data extraction and synthesis
Two authors prescreened all search results (titles and 
abstracts) against the inclusion criteria. Studies selected 
by either or both authors were subjected to a full text 
assessment. Two authors independently assessed the 
selected full text articles for inclusion. Two authors 
independently extracted data on study participants,

study design, interventions, outcome measures, results, 
and risk of bias characteristics. One author entered 
extracted data into Review Manager software, and these 
were checked by a second author. We contacted study 
authors for additional information about included stud-
ies as required.
Studies were analysed by type of behaviour, with 
data across diseases and interventions combined. We 
summarised study effect sizes for each outcome using 
forest plots. Effect sizes for dichotomous data were odds 
ratios, with values greater than one favouring the inter-
vention group. Effect sizes for continuous outcomes 
were standardised mean differences, centred on zero, 
with values greater than zero favouring the intervention 
group and those less than zero favouring the compari-
son group. When different studies reported either 
dichotomous or continuous data for the same outcome, 
we combined these data using the generic inverse vari-
ance method, and we reported effect sizes as stan-
dardised mean differences. This involved following the 
methods outlined in the Cochrane handbook (sections 
7
.7
.7
. and 9.4.6)26: computing standard errors for these 
studies by entering the data separately as dichotomous 
and continuous outcome type data, as appropriate, and 
converting the confidence intervals for the resulting log 
odds ratios and standardised mean differences into 
standard errors. Log odds ratios were then converted to 
standardised mean differences by multiplying each by 
the required constant. We obtained pooled effect sizes 
with 95% confidence intervals using a random effects 
model applied on the scale of standardised mean differ-
ences and log odds ratios. We tested for heterogeneity 
using the χ2 test and quantified it using the I2 statistic, 
with a value of 50% or greater considered to represent 
substantial heterogeneity.26
If multiple indices of a given behavioural outcome 
were reported, we used the most stringent and valid 
measure of behaviour available (eg, an objective mea-
sure such as biochemically validated smoking cessa-
tion). When a study had more than one follow-up time 
point, we used data from the longest follow-up avail-
able. Final values were always used rather than changes 
from baseline. When there were multiple intervention 
and control arms, we chose to compare with that which 
allowed the purest isolation of the effect of the DNA risk 
communication component.
subgroup analysis
When data were available, we examined the effect of a 
genetic test result within those participants receiving 
DNA based disease risk estimates, comparing the effect 
of communicating the presence versus the absence of a 
risk-conferring genotype (in this context, a variant asso-
ciated with an increased likelihood of disease).
treatment of missing data
We analysed data according to participants’ ran-
domised groups, accounting for missing data where 
possible, using data as provided by authors or, for 
dichotomous outcomes when data were not provided, 
assuming that participants with missing outcomes were 
engaging in the risk increasing behaviour (eg, continu-
ing to smoke). When such analysis was not possible 
(due to missing data or outcomes reported as continu-
ous data) owing to the problematic nature of imputa-
tion without available individual level data, we 
analysed outcomes as reported.
assessments of risk of bias and quality of evidence
We assessed the methodological characteristics of 
included studies in accordance with Cochrane guid-
ance,26  including assessment of sequence generation, 
allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome 
data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. For 
each criterion, we determined whether this represented 
a low, unclear, or high risk of bias, and based on the 
individual domains we generated a summary risk of 
bias assessment. If the judgment in at least one domain 
was “high risk of bias” then we determined the sum-
mary risk of bias to be high. We judged the summary 
risk of bias to be low only if judgments in all domains 
were “low risk of bias.” The summary risk of bias con-
tributed to the GRADE assessment of the quality of evi-
dence, which was applied to each primary outcome in 
terms of the extent of our confidence in the estimates of 
effects. GRADE criteria for assessing quality of evidence 
encompass study limitations, inconsistency, impreci-
sion, indirectness, publication bias, and other consid-
erations.27
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Overall, 10 515 identified references were screened for 
possible inclusion. Eighteen studies met the inclusion 
criteria. Figure 1  outlines the search and screening pro-
cess and table 1 gives details of the included studies. 
Studies were excluded for several reasons: ineligible 
study design, not including a relevant outcome mea-
sure, no personalised DNA based disease risk esti-
mates, no eligible comparison, and an ongoing study 
yet to report its results.
The studies were principally carried out in outpatient 
or primary care clinics or various community popula-
tions. Five studies communicated the genetic risks for 
lung or oesophageal cancer to smokers28 36 39 42 46  and 
one study communicated the risks of Crohn’s disease to 
smokers.37  Two studies communicated the risks of 
oesophageal and other cancers with alcohol consump-
tion.34 40  One study communicated the risks of mela-
noma.31  One study communicated the risks of colorectal 
cancer.49  Three studies communicated the risk of type 2

ticipants, where reported, ranged from 30 to 56 years, 
and the sex mix of participants ranged between 0% and 
73% female.
Primary outcome analysis
In separate forest plots we show the results for dichoto-
mous outcome data only (fig 2 ), continuous outcome 
data only (fig 3 ), and combined dichotomous and con-
tinuous outcome data (fig 4).
Smoking cessation
Six studies assessed smoking cessation,28 36 37 39 42 46 all 
but one37  using self report measures. The genetic risks 
communicated were for lung or oesophageal can-
cer28 36 39 42 46 and Crohn’s disease.37  Comparisons were 
between DNA based risk estimates versus no risk esti-
mates for four of six studies,36 
39 
42 
46 with one study com-
paring DNA based plus non-DNA based risk estimates 
versus only non-DNA based risk estimates,28  and one 
study comparing DNA based versus non-DNA based 
risk estimates.37 Pooled analysis (n=2663) showed no 
significant effect of DNA based risk communication on 
smoking cessation (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence 
interval 0.63 to 1.35, P=0.67; I2=39%, fig 2 ). Within inter-
vention arm subgroup analysis, assessing the effect of 
the presence (versus absence) of a risk-conferring geno-
type, was possible for five of the six studies.36 37 39 42 46 
Pooling these data revealed no evidence of a benefit 
from communicating the presence of a risk-conferring 
genotype (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.81 
to 1.97
, P=0.30).
Medication use
One study (n=162) communicated the genetic risk of Alz-
heimer’s disease and assessed self reported medication 
use to reduce this risk, at 12 month follow-up.30  The 
comparison was between DNA based plus non-DNA 
based risk estimates versus only non-DNA based risk 
estimates. The odds ratio of 1.26 (95% confidence inter-
val 0.58 to 2.72, P=0.56) suggested no effect of DNA based 
risk communication (fig 2). In subgroup analysis com-
paring those receiving a positive versus a negative APOE 
e4 disclosure, the odds ratio was 2.61 (95% confidence 
interval 1.09 to 6.23, P=0.03), indicating a positive effect 
on medication use of information concerning the pres-
ence of a risk-conferring genotype.
Alcohol use
Three studies34 35 40  assessed self reported alcohol use, 
with genetic risks communicated for cancers34 40  and 
for cardiovascular disease.35 Comparisons were 
between DNA based risk estimates versus no risk esti-
mates. Pooled data (n=239) revealed no evidence of an 
effect of DNA based risk communication on reducing 
alcohol use (standardised mean difference 0.07
, 95% con-
fidence interval −0.20 to 0.35, P=0.61, I2=13%, fig 3 ). Sub-
group analysis of data from one study,35 showed no effect 
of communicating a high risk genotype (standardised 
mean difference 0.17
, 95% confidence interval −0.42 
to 0.76, P=0.57).
Sun protection behaviours
One study (n=73) communicated the risk of melanoma 
and assessed self reported sun protection behaviours.31 
 
The comparison was between DNA based risk estimates 
versus no risk estimates. The standardised mean differ-
ence was 0.43 (95% confidence interval −0.03 to 0.90, 
P=0.07), suggesting no effect of DNA based risk commu-
nication (fig 3). Subgroup analysis was not possible.
Diet
Seven studies assessed self reported dietary 
behaviour.30 
32 
35 
41 
43 
45 
47 The genetic risks communicated 
were for type 2 diabetes,32 47  obesity,43  familial hyper-
cholesterolaemia,41  Alzheimer’s disease,30  cardiovas-
cular disease,35  and hypertension.45   
Comparisons were 
between DNA based risk estimates versus no risk esti-
mates for three studies,35 
43 
45 with three studies compar-
ing DNA based plus non-DNA risk estimates versus only 
non-DNA based risk estimates,30 41 47 and one study 
comparing DNA based risk estimates versus non-DNA 
based risk estimates.32 Pooled data from these studies 
(n=1784) showed no significant evidence of a benefit 
from DNA based risk communication (standardised 
mean difference 0.12, 95% confidence interval −0.00 to 
0.24, P=0.05, I2=17%, fig 4 ). Pooled subgroup analysis 
of data from three studies,30 35 45 showed no effect of 
communicating a high risk genotype (standardised 
mean difference 0.18, 95% confidence interval −0.13 to 
0.50, P=0.25).

behaviour,30

these studies (n=1704) revealed no evidence of an effect 
of DNA based risk communication (standardised mean 
difference −0.03, 95% confidence interval −0.14 to 0.07
, 
P=0.54, I2=0%, fig 4 ). Pooled subgroup analysis of data 
from two studies30 35 showed no effect of communicat-
ing a high risk genotype (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.49 to 3.11, P=0.65).
Attendance at screening or behavioural support 
programmes
Two studies assessed attendance at screening or 
behavioural support programmes33 49  following com-
munication of genetic risks for type 2 diabetes33  and 
colorectal cancer.49 Comparisons were between DNA 
based risk estimates versus no risk estimates. Pooled 
analysis (n=891) suggested no effect of DNA based risk 
communication (standardised mean difference −0.04, 
95% confidence interval −0.20 to 0.11, P=0.59, I2=0%, 
fig 4). It was possible to conduct subgroup analysis with 
data from both studies, which showed no effect of com-
municating a high risk genotype (standardised mean 
difference −0.16, 95% confidence interval −0.47 to 0.16, 
P=0.33).
secondary outcomes
The few data reported on prespecified secondary out-
comes of motivation to change behaviour and of depres-
sion and anxiety provided no evidence of any 
intervention impact on these outcomes. Five studies 
assessed motivation or intention to change 
behaviour,32 33 34 36 46  two studies measured depres-
sion,41 
46  and three studies measured anxiety.32 
41 
46 In all 
cases, confidence intervals included no effect.
assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidence
Only four of the 18 studies were considered to have a 
low summary risk of bias, having met all of the specified 
criteria (fig 5 ).32 
33 
37 
49 The inability of 14 of 18 studies to 
meet criteria for low summary risk of bias reflected both 
a lack of clarity in reporting and a failure or inability to 
safeguard against risk of bias. In terms of GRADE 
assessment of the quality of the evidence across out-
comes, evidence was determined to be of low quality for 
all outcomes other than attendance at screening or 
behavioural support, meaning limited confidence is 
placed in the effect estimates. Evidence was down-
graded twice for these outcomes owing to study limita-
tions (with all or most information for the outcome from 
studies at high or unclear risk of bias) and imprecision 
(with sample sizes failing to meet the optimal 
 
information size and/or 95% confidence intervals for 
the summary effect estimate overlapping no effect and 
including appreciable benefit or harm). For the

evidence was downgraded only once owing to impreci-
sion (and not study limitations, as information came 
from studies at low risk of bias). Therefore, the evidence 
for this outcome was assessed to be of moderate quality.
discussion
The evidence in this review suggests that communicat-
ing DNA based disease risk estimates has little or no 
effect on health related behaviour. The evidence for 
concluding an absence of effect was strongest for smok-
ing cessation and physical activity, where for both, six 
studies contributed comparably consistent effects, with 
pooled point estimates of effect size close to unity, sup-
ported by relatively narrow 95% confidence intervals. 
The evidence concerning attendance at screening or 
behavioural support shared similar characteristics and 
indicated an absence of effect, although findings were 
based on only two studies (albeit both well conducted 
trials). The results from the seven studies on dietary 
behaviour are compatible with a small effect of genetic 
risk communication and with a narrow pooled 
 
confidence interval. For all other behaviours, data were 
considerably fewer. There were also no effects on 
 
motivation to change behaviour, and no adverse effects 
on depression or anxiety, although again there were few 
data for these secondary outcomes. Finally, the supple-
mentary subgroup analyses within participants in the 
intervention arms only, suggest that there is no clear 
effect of genetic test result. Only one of six analyses 
showed a statistically significant effect of communicat-
ing the presence versus absence of a risk conferring 
mutation, and this was derived from one study.
strengths and weaknesses of this review
We conducted the review using rigorous Cochrane 
methods to minimise the risk of bias. We included 
quantitative synthesis using meta-analysis and system-
atic assessment of risk of bias of included studies and of 
quality of the evidence by outcome, and we identified a 
substantive body of randomised studies able to inform 
our specified aims. Previous reviews had identified few 
clinical studies using randomised designs, did not 
include quantitative syntheses of effects on behaviour, 
or were focused on single behaviours.
However, our review does have several limitations, 
linked to limitations of the available evidence. Princi-
pally, we found that several studies were limited in their 
ability to address the review objective. They were often 
underpowered to detect plausible small effects of risk 
information on behaviour, and many of the studies (10 
of 18) were judged to have control groups of low rele-
vance because their content differed from the interven-
tion group in more than only the absence of DNA based 
information on disease risk. For example, one study 
that produced a medium sized effect on behaviour had 
an intervention group that differed from the control 
group both in the use of DNA based risk communication 
and in the provision of telephone counselling.42  Also, 
few included studies were determined to be at low sum-
mary risk of bias. In particular, the failure or inability to 
use valid measures of behaviour may have introduced 
error and bias. While we acknowledge that the use of 
self report measures is sometimes necessary, included 
studies typically used self report measures even when 
viable objective measures were available (for example, 
in relation to smoking cessation).51 Participants and 
providers are not blinded to the intervention and it is 
important that outcome assessors are blinded, but this

was rarely the case (at least as reported), and, where 
self report measures are used, is not possible. The 
potential for selective outcome reporting was also nota-
ble, with few instances of trial registration or published 
protocols. The substantive risk of bias and seemingly 
poor quality of many of the included studies, and the 
relative imprecision of the effect estimates, suggests 
caution in interpreting the results.
interpretation of study results
We outlined three possible competing hypotheses on 
the possible behavioural impact of DNA based disease 
risk information evident in the literature—that it 
strongly motivates risk-reducing behaviour change, 
that it demotivates risk-reducing behaviour change, 
and, finally that, at best, it has only a small effect on 
risk-reducing behaviour. Our results do not support the 
first two hypotheses, but are consistent with the third, 
suggesting that high expectations of the potency of 
such communications to change behaviour are 
unfounded. This is consistent with the results of a 
recent cohort study reporting no impact on diet or 
physical activity of direct-to-consumer genome-wide 
testing.52  It is also in accord with the results of a 
Cochrane review in which the authors concluded that 
the current evidence does not support the hypothesis 
that biomedical risk assessment increases smoking 
cessation.14  The theoretically oriented literature on 
behaviour change also highlights the typically small 
effect of risk communication on behaviour.12 While the 
results of the current review are strongly suggestive of, 
at most, small effects on health behaviours, high qual-
ity research evidence is currently insufficient to engen-
der confidence of this for each individual behaviour 
included in the review. However, given the overall pat-
tern of the combined evidence, any additional large 
scale trials, even if better designed and conducted, 
need a clear justification. Such justification would be 
based on incrementally developed evidence indicating 
that efficacy of a clinically important degree is possible 
(that is, higher than the priors based on this review) 
given the particular characteristics of the intervention 
and target population.
Previous reviews of the behavioural impact of genetic 
risk communication have included non-randomised 
studies, predominantly of those with family histories of 
breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, with the domi-
nant behaviours reported being screening or prophylac-
tic surgery. These indicate an increase in screening and 
prophylactic surgery, particularly among those found to 
be carriers—that is, those with an increased risk of dis-
ease.16-19 Such findings suggest that DNA based risk 
assessments are more likely to motivate clinical means 
of reducing risk (such as undergoing surgery or attend-
ing screening) than behavioural means (such as altering 
smoking, diet, or physical activity behaviours) that are

the main focus of this review.53  In spite of this, the one 
large and well conducted trial included in this review49 
that assessed the impact of DNA risk communication on 
colorectal screening found no effect on uptake.
implications for public health and research
The available evidence does not provide support for the 
expectations raised by researchers and proponents of 
personalised medicine as well as direct-to-consumer 
testing companies that the receipt of results from DNA 
based tests for gene variants that confer increased risk 
of common complex diseases motivates behaviour 
change. Concerns that communicating DNA based dis-
ease risk estimates may demotivate behaviour change 
are also unsupported by the results of this review. 
Where such tests exist, be it in public or private sector 
domains, their use warrants the collection of evidence 
on behaviour change as part of research protocols, 
thereby contributing to the limited existing evidence 
base. At present there is little evidence to suggest that 
simply communicating the results of DNA tests has a 
role in strategies aimed at improving population health 
by motivating risk-reducing behaviour change.54  Such 
tests may, however, have a role in such strategies if sup-
plemented by the offer of effective behaviour change 
interventions. DNA testing, alone or in combination 
with other assessments of disease risk, may have a role 
in stratifying populations by risk, to enable clinical and 
behavioural interventions—such as screening tests, sur-
gery, and drug treatments—to be targeted at those at 
increased risk.55
The communication of genetic information may differ 
in respect to how much it is framed as a “risk” to health, 
or used to inform recommendations for wellness (even if 
these are derived from associations with increased risk). 
For example, nutrigenomic information may not be pre-
sented or characterised as risk information but may be 
used to inform behavioural recommendations, which 
can be highly specific and targeted. This is demonstrated 
by one of the included studies,45 which used nutrige-
nomic testing to provide specific intake recommenda-
tions for foods. However, as yet there are too few trials to 
assess whether this type of genetic testing has a different 
impact from more traditional genetic testing providing 
information about the likelihood of a health harm.
Given the continued high expectations for the com-
munication of DNA based disease risk estimates to 
motivate risk-reducing behaviour change, it is import-
ant that any additional randomised controlled trials are 
conducted using methodologically robust designs. 
These would be powered to detect possible small effects 
on behaviour (that might have important population 
consequences), and conducted and reported cognisant 
of the risks of bias—for example, by incorporating pre-
specified outcomes, valid measures of behaviour, and 
the blinding of outcome assessors.
Conclusion
The results of this review suggest that communicating 
DNA based disease risk estimates has little or no effect 
on risk-reducing health behaviour. Existing evidence 
does not support expectations that such interventions 
could play a major role in motivating behaviour change 
to improve population health.
