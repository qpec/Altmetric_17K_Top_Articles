Effect of a Quality Improvement Intervention With Daily
Round Checklists, Goal Setting, and Clinician Prompting
on Mortality of Critically Ill Patients
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Writing Group for the CHECKLIST-ICU Investigators and the Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet)
IMPORTANCE The effectiveness of checklists, daily goal assessments, and clinician prompts as
quality improvement interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a multifaceted quality improvement intervention reduces
the mortality of critically ill adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study had 2 phases. Phase 1 was an observational
study to assess baseline data on work climate, care processes, and clinical outcomes,
conducted between August 2013 and March 2014 in 118 Brazilian ICUs. Phase 2 was a cluster
randomized trial conducted between April and November 2014 with the same ICUs. The first
60 admissions of longer than 48 hours per ICU were enrolled in each phase.
INTERVENTIONS Intensive care units were randomized to a quality improvement
intervention, including a daily checklist and goal setting during multidisciplinary rounds with
follow-up clinician prompting for 11 care processes, or to routine care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality truncated at 60 days (primary
outcome) was analyzed using a random-effects logistic regression model, adjusted for
patients’severity and the ICU’
s baseline standardized mortality ratio. Exploratory secondary
outcomes included adherence to care processes, safety climate, and clinical events.
RESULTS A total of 6877 patients (mean age, 59.7 years; 3218 [46.8%] women) were enrolled
in the baseline (observational) phase and 6761 (mean age, 59.6 years; 3098 [45.8%] women)
in the randomized phase, with 3327 patients enrolled in ICUs (n = 59) assigned to the
intervention group and 3434 patients in ICUs (n = 59) assigned to routine care. There was no
significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the intervention group and the usual
care group, with 1096 deaths (32.9%) and 1196 deaths (34.8%), respectively (odds ratio,
1.02; 95% CI, 0.82-1.26; P = .88). Among 20 prespecified secondary outcomes not adjusted
for multiple comparisons, 6 were significantly improved in the intervention group (use of low
tidal volumes, avoidance of heavy sedation, use of central venous catheters, use of urinary
catheters, perception of team work, and perception of patient safety climate), whereas there
were no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for 14
outcomes (ICU mortality, central line–associated bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated
pneumonia, urinary tract infection, mean ventilator-free days, mean ICU length of stay, mean
hospital length of stay, bed elevation to �30°, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, diet
administration, job satisfaction, stress reduction, perception of management, and perception
of working conditions).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients treated in ICUs in Brazil,
implementation of a multifaceted quality improvement intervention with daily checklists,
goal setting, and clinician prompting did not reduce in-hospital mortality.

hecklists have been proposed as tools to ensure
that essential components of care are not omitted.1-3
In intensive care units (ICUs), the use of checklists is
associated with increased adherence to guidelines,4 reduced
rates of central line–associated bloodstream infection,3,5
and earlier extubation.6 Using checklists combined with
daily goals assessment and clinician prompting may improve
communication, adherence to care processes, and clini-
cal outcomes.7,8 However, the evidence supporting the
use of checklists in critical care derives from before-after
studies,3,4,8 or studies aimed at specific conditions,5 all con-
ducted in high-income countries. Evidence from random-
ized trials is lacking,9 akin to that for quality improvement
(QI) interventions in general.10
Low- or middle-income countries such as Brazil sus-
tain 85% of the global burden of critical illness.11 In these
settings, staff tend to operate under vertical, rather than
horizontal, hierarchy, which contributes to a poor work cli-
mate and safety culture.12,13 Perhaps as a consequence,
adherence with guidelines is lower, and severity-adjusted
outcomes are worse than in high-income countries.14,15
Checklists, read out loud by team members, have success-
fully flattened hierarchy in a number of settings, improving
work climate and process adherence.7,8 We therefore
hypothesized that such an approach would improve work
climate, care processes, and mortality in Brazilian ICUs.
Thus, we conducted a cluster randomized trial to assess the
effect of a multifaceted QI intervention that promoted a
daily checklist, goal setting during multidisciplinary rounds,
and clinician prompts on in-hospital mortality of critically
ill patients.
Methods
Study Design
The CHECKLIST-ICU study was conducted in 2 phases
(Figure 1). Phase 1 was an observational study to assess base-
line data on work climate, care processes, and clinical out-
comes in Brazilian ICUs caring for adult patients. In phase 2,
the ICUs were randomized to receive the multifaceted QI in-
tervention or to routine care. The unit of concealed random-
ization was the ICU to minimize contamination, as we ap-
pliedtheinterventiontothewholeICUmultidisciplinaryteam.
As part of the agreement to be included in the study, all ICUs
randomizedtocontrolreceivedtheinterventionafterthestudy
was completed.
The ethics committees of all institutions approved the
study. The protocol and statistical analysis plan were pub-
lished previously (see trial protocol in Supplement 1 and sta-
tistical analysis plan in Supplement 2).16,17 To avoid selec-
tion bias, written consent was obtained at the cluster level
from the director of each institution.18 The funders had no
role in the analysis or publication decision. Nevertheless,
the funders and ICU leaders requested an intervention
period not longer than 6 months so that ICUs randomized to
the control group would also receive the intervention in a
timely fashion.
Participants
Adult ICUs were included from all Brazilian regions. Pediatric
ICUs, cardiac ICUs, step-down units, ICUs whose leadership
did not or would not implement multidisciplinary daily
rounds, and ICUs that already used checklists during rounds
were excluded. When 2 or more ICUs from a single institution
participated in the study, they were considered a single unit,
except for those with completely separate teams. Intensive
care units that successfully collected data in the observa-
tional phase (ie, inclusion of ≥30 patients within 6 months
and collection of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire [SAQ]
from >75% of their staff) were randomized.
In both phases, ICUs enrolled between 40 and 60 con-
secutive patients 18 years or older with an ICU stay longer than
48 hours. Patients in whom a high probability of early death
was anticipated (defined as death occurring between the 48th
and 72nd hours of the ICU stay), patients receiving exclusive
palliative care, and those with a suspected or confirmed diag-
nosis of brain death were excluded.
Randomization and Masking
The units of randomization were the ICUs. A statistician from
Research Institute HCor generated the randomization list
with random permuted blocks of 4 units using an appropriate
statistical package. Stratification was performed according to
the median in-hospital mortality determined in the observa-
tional phase. To ensure allocation concealment, the statisti-
cian who prepared the list received only the identification
code of the unit and was not aware of the identity of the ICU.
The allocation list was then sent to the research manager,
who informed the ICUs about their randomization status in
January 2014.
Caregivers were not blinded to group assignment. Re-
search coordinators and the statistician who analyzed the data
were also not blinded, because data regarding adherence to
checklist and clinician prompting were collected exclusively
for the intervention group ICUs. Ventilator-associated pneu-
monia and central line–associated bloodstream infection di-
agnoses were adjudicated by a blinded committee using stan-
dardized definitions.19,20
Procedures
The intervention consisted of modifying daily multidisci-
plinary rounds to include the use of a checklist and discus-
sion of goals of care, together with clinician prompting later
in the day to ensure follow-through with checklist adherence
and goals of care, for all patients during their entire ICU stay.
The checklist (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3) was developed
based on the clinical practice guideline development cycle.21
It targeted 11 care processes aimed at prevention of venous
thromboembolism (VTE), ventilator-associated pneumonia
(head-of-bed ≥30°), central line–associated bloodstream, and
urinary tract infection (removal of unnecessary urinary or
venous catheters); improvement in nutrition and analgesia;
reduction of sedation; assessment of readiness for extuba-
tion; detection of severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome; optimization of antibiotics (indication to start,
adjust, or stop); and reduction of tidal volume.

A strategy to leverage the potential of the checklist was
used, not only to avoid errors of omission, but also to pro-
mote a flat hierarchy by empowering the entire team to par-
ticipate in daily rounds. Thus, during weekday rounds, the
checklist was read aloud by a nurse and answered by partici-
pants. Daily goals were registered on a standardized form
(eFigure 2 in Supplement 3) and then read aloud to the team.
Every afternoon, a nurse reviewed the daily goals and
prompted the on-call physician when there were pending
items. The goal was that the intervention be applied at least
on weekdays (Monday through Friday).
The following actions were taken to ensure adherence to
the QI intervention (eTable 1 in Supplement 3): an investiga-
tors meeting; a visit of 1 member of the steering committee
to every ICU to train the multidisciplinary team and partici-
pate in the rounds; audit and feedback on adherence to care
processes; a study website; and dissemination of videos with
testimonials of opinion leaders that focused on the impor-
tance of the study, and successful QI experiences, with spe-
cial emphasis on the principle that the whole team works
better than isolated voices. In addition, electronic text mes-
sages were sent every 2 to 3 days to the multidisciplinary
team at the sites regarding adherence to the intervention,
and ICU medical and nursing directors were contacted if
adherence was low. Intensive care units started implement-
ing the study intervention soon after the investigators meet-
ing (March 14, 2014) and no later than March 31, 2014. Con-
trol group ICUs maintained routine care and received no
preintervention training.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, truncated at
60 days. Mortality was chosen as the primary outcome for
several reasons. First, it is the most important outcome for
critically ill patients and their relatives. Second, mortality is
high among patients admitted to ICUs in Brazil. Third, previ-

ous before-after studies have suggested decreased mortality
with the use of a surgical safety checklist2 and clinician
prompting in ICUs.8
Secondary exploratory outcomes were adherence to
care processes, ICU safety climate, and clinical outcomes
(eTable 2 in Supplement 3). Adherence to 7 care processes
targeted by the checklist was measured: patients receiving
enteral or parenteral feeding; head-of-bed elevated at 30° or
more; patients receiving moderate to light sedation or alert
and calm (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score −3 to
0); mechanical ventilation tidal volume 8 mL/kg of pre-
dicted body weight or less; VTE prophylaxis; central venous
catheter use; and indwelling urinary catheter use. Four
items targeted by the checklist were not assessed due to fea-
sibility constraints (timely screening of sepsis, adequacy of
antibiotics, adequacy of analgesia, and daily spontaneous
breathing trials). Six ICU safety climate domains (team work
climate, safety climate, job satisfaction, stress recognition,
perception of management, working conditions) were
evaluated using the validated Brazilian-Portuguese version
of the SAQ, administered anonymously to promote uninhib-
ited answers.22,23 Furthermore, the following clinical sec-
ondary outcomes were assessed: ICU mortality, mechanical
ventilation-free days within 28 days, central line–associated
bloodstream infection rate, ventilator-associated pneumo-
nia rate, urinary tract infection rate, length of ICU stay, and
length of hospital stay.
Trained research coordinators not involved in the care of
ICU patients collected data prospectively in a web-based data
capture system in both phases. Quality control was guaran-
teed by automated data entry checks, weekly contact with in-
vestigators, and central statistical checks.
Statistical Analysis
According to the sample size calculation, with 102 ICUs and
an average of 50 patients per unit, the study had 90% power
with a type I error rate of 5% to detect an absolute reduction
in in-hospital mortality of 6% (from 30% in the control
group to 24% in the intervention group), considering a coef-
ficient of variation K of 0.25.24 Baseline in-hospital mortal-
ity was estimated at 30% considering data of patients with
an ICU stay longer than 48 hours from a large administrative
database of Brazilian ICUs (Epimed Monitor System, Epimed
Solutions). A 20% relative (6% absolute) risk reduction in
mortality was considered to be a clinically relevant, biologi-
cally plausible, moderate effect size, and one typically
observed in health care interventions.25
All analyses were prespecified and followed the
intention-to-treat principle.17 Because ICUs were random-
ized rather than patients and we measured outcomes at
the patient level, the analyses were adjusted for clustering
of the data. The primary outcome was analyzed using a
prespecified random-effects logistic regression model,
with adjustment for patients’Simplified Acute Physiology
Score 3 (SAPS3) and for each ICU’
s standardized mortality
ratio (calculated as the observed hospital mortality di-
vided by that predicted from the SAPS3 observed in the
observational phase) to account for potential baseline
imbalances in patients’ severity and ICUs’ performance.
Multiple imputation with chained equations was used
for missing in-hospital vital status, assuming data were
missing at random (mice package in R, R Foundation for Sta-
tistical Computing).26 The imputation was conducted with 5
replicates using a logistic regression model with baseline
covariates for sex and in-hospital mortality at the observa-
tional phase.
For all other analyses, the effect estimate was generated
from a generalized linear mixed model that included a term
for the observed outcomes within each ICU during the
observational phase. Additional analyses included prespeci-
fied subgroups (2 strata of baseline in-hospital mortality [by
median] observed for ICUs in the observational phase, pub-
lic or private hospital, medical or surgical patient, 2 strata of
the Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score,
presence of sepsis at admission, and need for mechanical
ventilation at admission) and subgroups defined a posteriori
(academic or nonacademic hospitals, time of patients’
enrollment at or before 60 days or after 60 days) using for-
mal interaction tests.
All tests were 2-sided, and a P value lower than .05 de-
noted statistical significance. Prespecified secondary out-
come analyses and subgroup analyses were not adjusted for
multiple comparisons; thus, their results should be inter-
preted as exploratory. In post hoc sensitivity analyses, the sig-
nificance level for secondary outcomes was adjusted using a
Sidak correction, a method to control overall type I error when
thereareseveralindependenthypothesistests.27Analyseswere
performed with R version 2.10.1.
Results
Characteristics of Participants
The observational phase ran from September 2013 through
March 2014, and the randomization phase ran from April
2014 through November 2014. A total of 335 ICUs accepted
to participate; however, 149 were ineligible (120 were
already applying checklists during daily rounds, 12 did not
conduct and would not start multidisciplinary daily rounds,
6 were coronary care unit or step-down units, and 11 were
pediatric units), and 55 eventually declined to participate.
Thus, 131 ICUs were enrolled in the observational phase, of
which 118 collected the required data and were randomized
(59 in the intervention and 59 in the control group)
(Figure 1). There were 11 ICUs located in the same hospitals,
which were considered different units in the study. Only 1
hospital had ICUs allocated to different groups (2 ICUs
assigned to intervention and 4 to control). Characteristics of
the ICUs were similar between groups, although control
ICUs had more beds and were more often located in aca-
demic hospitals (Table 1). Characteristics of ICUs not
included in the randomized phase were similar to random-
ized ICUs (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).
A total of 13 638 patients in 118 ICUs were enrolled,
including 6877 patients (mean age, 59.7 years; 3218 [46.8%]
women) in the observational phase and 6761 in the random-

(Figure 1). The mean duration each ICU was enrolled in the
study was 4.4 months (median, 4.3; interquartile range
[IQR], 3.7-5.0) and 4.5 months (median, 4.5; IQR, 3.5-5.4) in
the control and intervention groups, respectively. The pri-
mary outcome was available for 6877 patients (100%) in the
observational phase and 6758 patients (99.9%) in the ran-
domized phase, although all patients were included in the
primary outcome analyses. Responses to the SAQ were
obtained from 6656 (85.3%) staff members in the observa-
tional phase and 6375 (78.8%) in the randomized phase,
with response rates 75% or greater for 99.2% and 92.4% of
ICUs, respectively, in both phases. Patient characteristics
were similar between groups in both phases (Table 2). A total
of 3435 (49.9%) and 3236 (47.9%) patients received mechani-
cal ventilation in the observational and randomized phases,
respectively.

whereas the SAPS3-predicted risk was 27.1%. Intensive care
unit mortality was 25.0%. Rates of central line–associated
bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and
urinary tract infection were 7.4, 4.3, and 10.6 cases per 1000
patient-days, respectively. The mean (SD) lengths of ICU stay
and hospital stay were 10.6 (11.2) days and 19.8 (16.6) days,
respectively. Among patients receiving mechanical ventila-
tion, the mean (SD) number of days receiving ventilator was
8.1 (9.3), and they had a mean (SD) 13.2 (7.7) ventilator-free
days in 28 days.
In the randomized phase, there were 1096 in-hospital
deaths among 3327 patients (32.9%) in the intervention group
and 1196 deaths among 3434 patients (34.8%) in the control
group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.26;
P = .88) (Figure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 3). The between-
group adjusted difference for in-hospital mortality was 0.39%
(95% CI, −3.70 to 4.47; P = .84).
Secondary Outcomes
Clinical Outcomes
The QI intervention had no effect on secondary exploratory
clinicaloutcomes:ICUmortality,centralline–associatedblood-
stream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary
tract infection, mean ventilator-free days, mean days receiv-
ing mechanical ventilation, and mean ICU or hospital length
of stay (Figure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 3).
Care Processes
Adherence varied across the 7 exploratory outcomes reflect-
ing care processes during the observational phase (eTable 4
in Supplement 3). For only 36.1% of the total patient-days,
patients received a moderate level of sedation or were alert
and calm, and on 54.1% of patient-days, patients received a
tidal volume of 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight or less.
Head-of-bed was elevated 30° or more on 90.3% and VTE
prophylaxis was adequate on 70.1% of patient-days. Central
venous lines and urinary catheters were used on 74.1% and
73.2% of patient-days, respectively.
The QI intervention improved adherence for the 4 care
processes that had poor baseline adherence: increased use
of low tidal volume (67.5% vs 58.9% of patient-days;
adjusted rate ratio [RR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26; P = .01) and

of patient-days; adjusted RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11;

RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89-1.20; P = .65]) (Figure 3 and eTable 4
in Supplement 3).
Safety Climate
At baseline, the percentages of positive answers for explor-
atory SAQ domains were 47.9% for teamwork climate, 32.5%
for safety climate, 72.5% for job satisfaction, 54.7% for stress
recognition, 20.7% for management perception, and 45.6% for
work conditions. There were significant differences between
groups in teamwork and safety climate by the end of the ran-
domization phase. In the intervention group, 53.8% of staff an-
swered that teamwork climate was positive, compared with
45.8% in the control group (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-
1.57; P = .01) (Table 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 3). In the in-
tervention group, 36.5% of staff answered that safety climate
was positive, compared with 31.9% in the control group (ad-
justed OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.57; P = .03). There were no dif-
ferences between groups in the other SAQ domains. The ef-
fects on all secondary outcomes were not significant after
adjustment for multiple comparisons, except for a reduction
in the use of urinary catheters (Sidak-corrected significance
level, .002).
Exploratory Subgroup and Ancillary Analyses
There was no significant heterogeneity in the intervention ef-
fect on in-hospital mortality in the predefined subgroups of
patients with higher or lower baseline in-hospital mortality;
public, private nonprofit, or private for-profit hospitals; need
for mechanical ventilation at admission or not; medical or sur-
gicaladmission;lowerorhigherSOFAscore;orpresenceofsep-
sis at admission or according to SAPS3 decile (eTable 5 in
Supplement 3). However, in exploratory analyses not ad-
justed for multiple comparisons, the effects of the QI inter-
vention on in-hospital mortality were significantly different

a Safety climate was assessed with the validated Brazilian-Portuguese version of
the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), which has 36 items divided into 6
domains (teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction, stress
recognition, perception of management, and working conditions). Each item is
measured on a 5-point Likert scale (disagree strongly, disagree slightly, neutral,
agree slightly, and agree strongly). For an answer to count as positive for a
given domain, the survey respondent must answer, on average, “
agree
slightly”or “
agree strongly”to all related items.

according to baseline levels of safety climate and perception
of management (eTable 5 in Supplement 3).
Because there was imbalance in the number of academic
hospitals between groups, a post hoc analysis was conducted
to assess the effect of the intervention on outcomes in the sub-
group of academic vs nonacademic ICUs. Effects on in-
hospitalmortality,careprocesses,andSAQdomainsweresimi-
lar (all P values for interaction >.05) between academic and
nonacademic hospitals. Additional post hoc analysis was con-
ducted to assess whether the effect on mortality might differ
among patients included earlier (within 60 days from the in-
clusion of the first patients in a given ICU) vs later in the ran-
domized phase (>60 days since the inclusion of the first pa-
tient in a given ICU). There was no interaction between
treatment effect on mortality and time of enrollment (en-
rolled ≤60 days: OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81-1.36; enrolled >60 days:
OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68-1.3; P value for interaction = .42).
Discussion
In this study of Brazilian ICUs, the introduction of daily check-
lists, goal setting, and clinician prompting did not decrease in-
hospital mortality or other clinical outcomes. The large num-
bers of clusters included and events observed allowed us to
reliably exclude a moderate to large effect on mortality (≥6%
absolute reduction). In addition, potential improvements were
observed in 4 of 7 care processes and 2 safety climate do-
mains, although except for 1 outcome, urinary catheter use,
these findings were not significant after adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons.
Several potential explanations were considered for the
lack of effect on mortality. First, although adherence to the
QI intervention was adequate, the effect on care processes
was modest and questionable due to the multiple unadjusted
comparisons. Second, it is possible that the intervention
needs time to work and our observation period was too short.
Although there was a signal suggesting improvement in care
processes and safety culture, a longer intervention period
might have led to a more horizontal hierarchy, greater trust
and teamwork, and ultimately demonstrable effects on
patient outcomes.3,5 However, both the government funder
and local clinical leaders stipulated the short duration so that
control ICUs could receive the intervention quickly. Third, it
is possible that the items on the checklist have very modest
or negligible effects on mortality. Although all the care pro-
cesses included in the checklist used in this study are recom-
mended by guidelines, most have uncertain effects on
mortality.28-32 For example, care processes such as semire-
cumbent position and VTE prophylaxis may decrease adverse
events but have no proven effect on mortality.33,34
Studies assessing checklists or clinician prompting
have found contradictory results. Some suggest marked
improvements on adherence to care processes and clinical
outcomes,2-5,8 while others found limited35 or no effect2,36
on care processes. A systematic review of 9 before-after
studies of safety checklists in acute care found inconsistent
improvements in patient safety.9 These studies differ in sev-
eral ways. Haynes et al2 showed reductions in complication
rates and mortality with the implementation of a checklist
during surgery, but the study involved a different popula-
tion. In addition, this and other studies involving critically
ill patients were simplistic before-after studies, subject to
bias by secular trends.2-4,8,9 Indeed, the replication of either
the safe surgery checklist in Ontario37 or the checklist to
prevent central line infections in England36 did not change
complications, infections, or deaths. Other studies using a
cluster randomized design similar to that of the current
study assessed different outcomes and interventions.5,35
Marsteller et al5 evaluated a multifaceted intervention
exclusively focused on preventing catheter-related blood-
stream infections. Scales et al35 tested the effectiveness of a
QI program to improve adherence to 6 care processes,
although checklists were used only during central line inser-
tion. Thus, the robust assessment of the effects of daily
round checklists and clinician prompting in a randomized
trial is a unique feature of the current study.
This study has several strengths. Over a relatively short
time frame, a countrywide government-sponsored initiative
with modest funding was able to successfully introduce and
assess the effects of a multifaceted QI intervention. The trial
was large, and the cluster randomization worked well, with a
good balance of baseline characteristics between the 2
groups. The intervention was effectively deployed, and all
relevant data were captured, including high response rates
from staff, both in the observational and randomized phases.
Bias was minimized through allocation concealment and
through independent data collection by staff uninvolved
with patient care. Furthermore, this study is one of the first
of this scale to be conducted in an intensive care setting in a
middle-income country, demonstrating important proof of
feasibility.
This study also has several limitations. The duration of in-
tervention was limited. In addition, restricting the sample to
patients with more than 48 hours of ICU stay may have lead
to a theoretical risk of imbalance between groups. Neverthe-
less,baselinecharacteristicswerewellbalanced.Moreover,the
care processes addressed in the checklist (eg, VTE prophy-
laxisorsemirecumbentposition)wereunlikelytobenefitthose
who were discharged early from the ICU or to prevent early
deaths. Information on excluded patients or on discharge lo-
cation for survivors was not collected, although hospital dis-
charge to locations other than home is rare in Brazil. Four items
targeted by the checklist were not assessed because of feasi-
bility constraints. Qualitative assessments of the root causes
of a suboptimal safety climate were not conducted. In addi-
tion, these results may not be applicable to settings with dif-
ferent baseline levels of safety climate.
Conclusions
Implementation of a multifaceted QI intervention with daily
checklists, goal setting, and clinician prompting did not re-
duce in-hospital mortality compared with routine care among
critically ill patients treated in ICUs in Brazil.
