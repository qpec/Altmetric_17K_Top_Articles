Background
Non-specific low back pain is a common, potentially disabling condition usually treated with self-care and non-prescription medication.
For chronic low back pain, current guidelines state that exercise therapy may be beneficial. Yoga is a mind-body exercise sometimes
used for non-specific low back pain.
Objectives
To assess the effects of yoga for treating chronic non-specific low back pain, compared to no specific treatment, a minimal intervention
(e.g. education), or another active treatment, with a focus on pain, function, and adverse events.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and four trials registers to 11 March 2016 without restriction of
language or publication status. We screened reference lists and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies.
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of yoga treatment in people with chronic non-specific low back pain. We included studies
comparing yoga to any other intervention or to no intervention. We also included studies comparing yoga as an adjunct to other
therapies, versus those other therapies alone.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors
to obtain missing or unclear information. We evaluated the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.
Main results
We included 12 trials (1080 participants) carried out in the USA (seven trials), India (three trials), and the UK (two trials). Studies were
unfunded (one trial), funded by a yoga institution (one trial), funded by non-profit or government sources (seven trials), or did not
report on funding (three trials). Most trials used Iyengar, Hatha, or Viniyoga forms of yoga. The trials compared yoga to no intervention
or a non-exercise intervention such as education (seven trials), an exercise intervention (three trials), or both exercise and non-exercise
interventions (two trials). All trials were at high risk of performance and detection bias because participants and providers were not
blinded to treatment assignment, and outcomes were self-assessed. Therefore, we downgraded all outcomes to ’moderate’ certainty

 evidence because of risk of bias, and when there was additional serious risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity between studies, or the
analyses were imprecise, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence further.
For yoga compared to non-exercise controls (9 trials; 810 participants), there was low-certainty evidence that yoga produced small to
moderate improvements in back-related function at three to four months (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.40, 95% confidence
interval (CI) -0.66 to -0.14; corresponding to a change in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire of mean difference (MD) -2.18,
95% -3.60 to -0.76), moderate-certainty evidence for small to moderate improvements at six months (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.66 to -
0.22; corresponding to a change in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD -2.15, 95% -3.23 to -1.08), and low-certainty
evidence for small improvements at 12 months (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.05; corresponding to a change in the Roland-Morris
Disability Questionnaire of MD -1.36, 95% -2.41 to -0.26). On a 0-100 scale there was very low- to moderate-certainty evidence that
yoga was slightly better for pain at three to four months (MD -4.55, 95% CI -7.04 to -2.06), six months (MD -7.81, 95% CI -13.37
to -2.25), and 12 months (MD -5.40, 95% CI -14.50 to -3.70), however we pre-defined clinically significant changes in pain as 15
points or greater and this threshold was not met. Based on information from six trials, there was moderate-certainty evidence that the
risk of adverse events, primarily increased back pain, was higher in yoga than in non-exercise controls (risk difference (RD) 5%, 95%
CI 2% to 8%).
For yoga compared to non-yoga exercise controls (4 trials; 394 participants), there was very-low-certainty evidence for little or no
difference in back-related function at three months (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.20; corresponding to a change in the Roland-
Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD -0.99, 95% -2.87 to 0.90) and six months (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.19; corresponding
to a change in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD -0.90, 95% -2.61 to 0.81), and no information on back-related
function after six months. There was very low-certainty evidence for lower pain on a 0-100 scale at seven months (MD -20.40, 95%
CI -25.48 to -15.32), and no information on pain at three months or after seven months. Based on information from three trials, there
was low-certainty evidence for no difference in the risk of adverse events between yoga and non-yoga exercise controls (RD 1%, 95%
CI -4% to 6%).
For yoga added to exercise compared to exercise alone (1 trial; 24 participants), there was very-low-certainty evidence for little or
no difference at 10 weeks in back-related function (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.42 to 0.22; corresponding to a change in the Oswestry
Disability Index of MD -17.05, 95% -22.96 to 11.14) or pain on a 0-100 scale (MD -3.20, 95% CI -13.76 to 7.36). There was no
information on outcomes at other time points. There was no information on adverse events.
Studies provided limited evidence on risk of clinical improvement, measures of quality of life, and depression. There was no evidence
on work-related disability.
Authors’ conclusions
There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that yoga compared to non-exercise controls results in small to moderate improvements
in back-related function at three and six months. Yoga may also be slightly more effective for pain at three and six months, however
the effect size did not meet predefined levels of minimum clinical importance. It is uncertain whether there is any difference between
yoga and other exercise for back-related function or pain, or whether yoga added to exercise is more effective than exercise alone. Yoga
is associated with more adverse events than non-exercise controls, but may have the same risk of adverse events as other back-focused
exercise. Yoga is not associated with serious adverse events. There is a need for additional high-quality research to improve confidence
in estimates of effect, to evaluate long-term outcomes, and to provide additional information on comparisons between yoga and other
exercise for chronic non-specific low back pain.

Background
Low back pain is a common health problem. For some people, it may last for three months or more and at this point it is termed
’chronic’. Yoga is sometimes used as a treatment for low back pain.

Yoga treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We searched medical databases for trials comparing yoga to any other treatment or to no treatment in adults (aged 18 years or greater).
We also included trials comparing yoga added to other treatments, versus those other treatments alone. The evidence is current to
March 2016.
Study characteristics
We included 12 trials with 1080 participants. Seven studies were carried out in the USA, three studies were carried out in India, and
two studies were carried out in the UK. All studies measured changes in back-related function or pain. Few studies reported on quality
of life or depression, and only about half of the studies said anything about harms.
Study funding sources
Three studies did not report the source of funding. One study reported not receiving any funding; one study was funded by a yoga
institution; and seven studies were funded by charity, university, or government sources.
Key results
Seven studies compared yoga to non-exercise, which included no treatment, delayed yoga treatment, or education (e.g. booklets and
lectures). Three studies compared yoga to back-focused exercise or similar exercise programmes. Two studies had three treatment groups
and compared yoga, non-exercise, and back-focused exercise. One of the studies comparing yoga to back-focused exercise compared
yoga plus back-focused exercise to back-focused exercise alone.
For yoga compared to non-exercise, there was low-certainty evidence that yoga was probably better in improving back function at three
months, moderate-certainty evidence that yoga was probably better at six months, and low-certainty evidence that yoga was probably
slightly better at 12 months. There was very-low- to moderate-certainty evidence for an improvement in pain at three, six, and 12
months, but the effects were not clinically important.
For yoga compared to back-focused exercise, there was very-low-certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between
yoga and non-yoga exercise in improving back function at three and six months and no information on back function at 12 months,
there was very-low-certainty evidence for an improvement in pain at seven months, and there was no information on pain at three or
12 months. For yoga plus back-focused exercise compared to back-focused exercise alone, there was very-low-certainty evidence from
one study (24 participants) and it is uncertain whether yoga added to exercise was better than exercise alone for back function or pain
at 10 weeks. Back function and pain were not measured after 10 weeks.
The most common harms reported in the trials were increased back pain. There was moderate-certainty evidence that the risk of harms
was higher in yoga than in non-exercise, and low-certainty that the risk of harms was similar between yoga and back-focused exercise.
Yoga was not associated with a risk of serious adverse events.
There was little information on clinical improvement, quality of life and depression, and no evidence on work-related disability.
Certainty of the evidence
Participants in all the studies were aware of whether they were practicing yoga or not, and this may have influenced their reporting of
changes in functioning, pain, and other measures. . In addition, some studies were very small, there were few studies in some comparisons,
and the studies in some comparisons had inconsistent results. Therefore, we graded the certainty of the evidence ’moderate’, ’low’, or
’very low’.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High certainty: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate certainty: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low certainty: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low certainty: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1 Downgraded one level for risk of bias (there was no blinding of participants or providers, and outcome was self-assessed
by participants).
2 Downgraded one level for imprecision (< 400 participants, or CI included both a null effect and either appreciable benefit or
appreciable harm).
3 Downgraded one additional level for risk of bias because the analysis relied heavily on one small study (Cox 2010) with
serious risks of bias in addition to lack of blinding.
4 Downgraded one level for heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 50%) that could not be explained.
5 Downgraded one level for heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 75%) that could be partly explained.

Description of the condition
Low back pain, defined as pain or discomfort in the area be-
tween the lower rib and the gluteal folds, is a common, potentially
disabling condition (Koes 2006). One systematic review on the
prevalence of low back pain reported adjusted summary estimates
for point prevalence of 11.9% (standard deviation (SD) 2.0%)
and one-month prevalence of 23.2% (SD 2.9%) (Hoy 2012).
The US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimated the
three-month prevalence of low back pain as 26.4% (Deyo 2006).
The unadjusted summary estimate from the systematic review for
one-year prevalence was 38.0% (SD 19.4%) (Hoy 2012). Esti-
mates of lifetime prevalence vary greatly in different regions of the
world, and mean estimates range from 38.9% (Hoy 2012) to 85%
(Balague 2012). Low back pain is associated with loss of work pro-
ductivity, poor quality of life, and high medical expenses, and is
a substantial economic burden on society (Deyo 2006; Dagenais
2008).
Back pain is sometimes associated with a likely aetiology (e.g.
radiculopathy or spinal stenosis), but most low back pain cases
are of unknown origin and are classified as non-specific (van
Tulder 1997). Low back pain may also be classified according
to the duration of pain as acute (less than four weeks), subacute
(between four weeks and three months), or chronic (three months
or greater) (van Tulder 2006; Chou 2007). Most episodes of low-
back pain are mild (Cassidy 2005), and activity limitations are rare
(Lawrence 2008). Symptoms often improve during the first six
weeks (Buchbinder 2012; Costa 2012). A small subset of chronic
and severe cases is responsible for much of the disability and related
medical costs due to low back pain (Luo 2004). Low back pain
is an intermittent and recurring condition. Among people with a
resolved episode of low back pain, it is estimated that between 24%
and 74% will have a recurrent episode within one year (Pengel
2003; Stanton 2008).
The usual treatment for low back pain is self-care and non-pre-
scription medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For chronic low back pain,
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guide-
lines, which are in the process of being updated as of September
2016, recommend exercise and some manual therapies in addi-
tion to non-prescription medication (NICE 2009). There are also
guidelines suggesting that there is good evidence of moderate ben-
efit for interdisciplinary rehabilitation (Chou 2009). The current
evidence does not provide guidance on selecting one treatment
approach over another or when specific treatments are warranted,
and the best treatment approaches remain unclear (Haldeman
2008), while many treatments are costly and of unclear effective-
ness (Deyo 2009).
Description of the intervention
Yoga is a mind-body practice originating from ancient India which
has also become popular in the West over the last century (Saper
2004). There are many branches and styles of yoga practice, with
varying philosophies and practices, but all may be characterized by
the integration of physical poses (asanas) and controlled breath-
ing (pranayama), and frequently also the incorporation of medita-
tion (dhyana) (Hewitt 2001; Hayes 2010). According to the 2007
NHIS, the use of yoga in the US increased between 2002 and
2007, and in 2007 over 13 million adults had used yoga during the
previous year (Barnes 2008; Birdee 2008). According to the 2012
NHIS, the use of yoga in the US increased further in subsequent
years and in 2012 over 21 million adults had used yoga during the
previous year (Cramer 2016a).
Therapeutic yoga is the use of yoga to help people with health
problems manage their condition and reduce their symptoms
(International Association of Yoga Therapists 2016). Yogahasbeen
suggested as being useful in managing pain and associated dis-
ability across a range of conditions, including back pain (McCall
2007; Bussing 2012). In the 2002 NHIS Alternative Medicine
Supplement survey over 10 million US adults described using yoga
for health reasons; 10.5% of yoga users said that their use was for
musculoskeletal conditions and 76% of these users reported that
the yoga was helpful (Birdee 2008). In the 2012 NHIS, 19.7%
of yoga users said their use was specifically for back pain (Cramer
2016a).
How the intervention might work
Several potential benefits have been proposed in relation to the
practice of yoga in persistent pain conditions, including changes in
physiological, behavioural and psychological factors (Wren 2011).
Potential mechanisms for these changes include improved flexi-
bility and muscular strength derived from practicing the physical
poses of yoga, increased mental and physical relaxation derived
from practicing controlled breathing or meditation exercises, and
improved body awareness gained through both the physical and
mental aspects of yoga (Sorosky 2008; Daubenmier 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
Yoga is one of several complementary therapies often used to treat
low back pain, and in surveys people frequently report that it
is helpful (Wolsko 2003; Birdee 2008). Several randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) have tested the effectiveness of yoga in reliev-
ing the symptoms of low back pain. Since yoga is a commonly used
therapy for a highly prevalent, recurrent, and bothersome health
problem for which there are no clearly satisfactory treatments, and
large RCTs are available, it is important to evaluate critically the
current evidence for yoga as a treatment for low back pain.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included RCTs. We excluded quasi-randomized trials. We did
not restrict study eligibility by language or publication status.
Types of participants
We included trials in adults (aged 18 years or greater) with cur-
rent chronic non-specific low back pain. We defined chronic low
back pain as pain with a duration of three months or more (van
Tulder 2006; Chou 2007). In our description of population and
setting, we specified whether the participants were recruited from
populations seeking medical care or from the community.
Types of interventions
We included studies of yoga as an intervention for low back pain.
The study was required to specify that the intervention was ’yoga’.
We excluded interventions based on yoga (e.g. stretching exercises
based on yoga) but not characterized as yoga. We did not restrict
studies according to the yoga tradition used, or according to the
dose, frequency, or duration of the yoga intervention. However,
we excluded studies examining yogic meditation or a yoga lifestyle
without a physical practice component.
We included studies comparing yoga to any other intervention or
to no intervention. We also included any studies comparing yoga
as an adjunct to other therapies, versus those other therapies alone.
The comparisons of interest were:
• yoga versus no treatment or a waiting list, a minimal
intervention (e.g. booklets, lectures, or other educational
interventions), or usual care (i.e. yoga compared to non-exercise
controls);
• yoga versus another active intervention (e.g. yoga versus
drugs), for which different types of active interventions were
considered separately (e.g. yoga versus drugs, yoga versus
manipulation) (i.e. yoga compared to exercise controls); and
• yoga plus any intervention versus that intervention alone,
for which different types of cointervention were considered
separately (e.g. yoga plus drugs versus drugs alone) (i.e. yoga as
an add-on intervention to an exercise intervention).
Studies with cointerventions were allowed, if the cointerventions
were comparable between intervention groups (e.g. both groups
were allowed the use of pain medications).
Types of outcome measures
We chose outcome measures that were important in assessment of
lowbackpain,sothatthisreviewmayproduce resultsthatare easily
compared to or combined with those of other systematic reviews
of treatment for low back pain. All outcomes were assessed at
short-term(closesttofourweeks), short-intermediate term(closest
to three months), intermediate-term (closest to six months), and
long-term (closest to one year) time points.
Primary outcomes
• Back-specific functional status (e.g. as measured by the
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire).
• Pain (e.g. as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS)
for pain).
Secondary outcomes
• Clinical improvement.
• Measures of mental or physical quality of life (e.g. as
measured on the 36-item Short Form (SF-36)).
• Measures of work disability.
• Adverse events.

The searches were previously run in 2013 and 2014. In 2014,
the ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP
, and a supplementary search
of the CBN Specialized Register in the CRS were added to the
search strategy. In 2016, the PubMed search was revised to capture
studies not in MEDLINE using the strategy recommended by
Duffy 2014. The Information Specialist of the CBN conducted all
searches except for the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field
Specialized Register, which we searched through the CRSO.
Searching other resources
We screened the reference lists of included studies and contacted
experts in the field (e.g. authors of included studies) for informa-
tion on additional trials, including unpublished or ongoing stud-
ies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors (LSW and NS, KP
, RV, or CD) independently
screened the titles and abstracts of references retrieved from
searches. We obtained the full text for references that either author
considered to be potentially relevant. Two authors (LSW and NS,
KP
, RV, or CD) independently assessed the full-text references for
inclusion according to the Criteria for considering studies for this
review. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulta-
tion with a third author.
Data extraction and management
One author (LSW) used a standardized and pilot-tested form to
extract data on study characteristics, and a second author (KP)
checked these data. Two authors (KP
, LSW) independently ex-
tracted data on funding or sponsorship.
Two authors (LSW, NS) used a standardized and pilot-tested form
to independently extract data on outcomes for each trial. If key
information was missing from the study report, we contacted the
report authors to obtain the information, and reported the results
of these contacts in the Notes section of the Characteristics of
included studies table. When back-related function was reported
using multiple scales, we extracted data from, in order of pref-
erence, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Os-
westry Disability Index. When pain data were reported on a scale
other than 0 to 100 (e.g. 0 to 5, 0 to 10) we transformed the data
into a 0 to 100 scale. When both endpoint and change data were
available, we used endpoint data in our primary analysis. In cases
where neither endpoint nor change data were available, one author
(RV) used Plot Digitizer to extract endpoint values from figures
(Jelicic 2016). We used these values together with the baseline SD
in our primary analysis. In cases where study participants were lost
to follow-up and intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using
imputation alongside available case analyses, we used the imputed
data for our primary analysis. In cases where both unadjusted and
adjusted data were available, we used the adjusted data for our
primary analysis. Disagreements on dually extracted information
were resolved by consensus.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two authors (LSW, KP) independently assessed the risk of bias for
each included study using the 13 ’Risk of bias’ items recommended
by the CBN (Furlan 2015a). These items are an adaptation of the
’Risk of bias’ criteria described in theCochrane Handbook of Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011b). The description
of each item and how to rate each item as ’low risk of bias’, ’high
risk of bias’, or ’unclear risk of bias’ are presented in Table 1 and
Table 2. For rating compliance, we considered trials to be at low
risk of bias if at least 50% of yoga participants were reported to
have attended at least 50% of classes. Disagreements on risk of
bias were resolved by consensus.
Lack of allocation concealment, failure to blind participants and
outcome assessors, and a high dropout rate or a marked difference
betweeninterventiongroupsinnumbersof dropouts orreasons for
dropout are all empirically associated with bias (Furlan 2015a). For
this review, we classified studies as having a high risk of bias if they
had a high or unclear risk of bias for random allocation, allocation
concealment, or incomplete outcome assessment, or a high risk of
bias under ’Other bias’. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the
primary outcomes to explore the effects of including and excluding
trials at high risk of bias (Sensitivity analysis).
Measures of treatment effect
We analyzed dichotomous outcomes (i.e. overall clinical improve-
ment) by calculating the risk ratio (RR). We analyzed continuous
outcomes (i.e. back-related function, pain, quality of life, depres-
sion) by calculating the mean difference (MD) or standardized
mean difference (SMD), and when combining outcomes mea-
sured on different scales by calculating the SMD we did not com-
bine endpoint and change values (Deeks 2011). We used the ab-
solute risk difference (RD) to report adverse events. We expressed
10

 the uncertainty with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all esti-
mates. We considered a minimum clinically important change on
the 0 to 100 pain scale to be 15 (Ostelo 2008). For non-pain out-
comes, we used Cohen’s three levels for the size of between-group
effects to classify the effect estimates as small (SMD less than 0.5),
medium (SMD from 0.5 to less than 0.8), or large (SMD 0.8 or
greater) (Cohen 1988). Measures of treatment effect are consid-
ered statistically significant when P is less than 0.05 or the 95%
CI excludes one (for the RR) or zero (for the MD, SMD, or RD).
Unit of analysis issues
We plannedtofollowthe guidance oncluster-randomizedorcross-
over trials in Chapters 16.3 and 16.4 of the Cochrane Handbook
of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a), but we did
not find any cluster-randomized or cross-over trials to include in
this review.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted the first author or primary investigator for trials in
which data for key study characteristics or primary outcomes were
missing or incomplete.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Clinical heterogeneity (i.e. differences in study populations, in-
terventions, and outcomes) between studies was assessed qualita-
tively. For studies that we judged to have sufficient clinical ho-
mogeneity to combine in a meta-analysis, we assessed statistical
heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, which describes the percentage
of the variability in the effect estimate that is due to clinical or
methodological heterogeneity rather than to chance. An I2 value
of 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, a value of
50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and a value
of 75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity (Deeks
2011).
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to use funnel plots to assess the potential for small-
study bias in meta-analyses in which at least 10 studies were in-
cluded; however, no meta-analyses included 10 or more studies.
We assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting for each
study as part of the ’Risk of bias’ assessment.
Data synthesis
When the population, interventions, outcomes, and time of as-
sessment were clinically comparable across trials, we carried out a
meta-analysis using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014). We used
a random-effects model because we expected some between-study
variation. When the data were considered not sufficiently clini-
cally similar to be combined in a meta-analysis, we described the
results from clinically comparable trials qualitatively.
Regardless of whether sufficient data were available to use quan-
titative analyses to summarize the data, we assessed the overall
certainty of the evidence for each comparison/outcome, using the
GRADE approach, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook of
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a), and adapted
in the updated CBN method guidelines (Furlan 2015a). Factors
that may decrease the certainty of the evidence are: study design
and risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness (not general-
izable), imprecision (sparse data), and other factors (e.g. reporting
bias). The certainty of the evidence for a specific outcome was
reduced by one level, according to the performance of the studies
against each of these five factors. The factors and criteria are out-
lined in Appendix 3 (Furlan 2015b). We reported the GRADE
certainty of the evidence in the Results.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We did not identify studies that tested yoga interventions without
a mind component (i.e. studies that tested only the physical prac-
tice component of yoga and did not include meditation, relax-
ation, or breathing exercises). Therefore, we were unable to con-
duct planned subgroup analyses to evaluate the differences in out-
comes between yoga interventions with and without a mind com-
ponent. We were unable to carry out subgroup analyses of trials
conducted in older (mean age 65 years or greater) versus younger
populations, and trials conducted with participants who had ma-
jor comorbidities (e.g. heart disease) versus trials conducted with
participants who did not have these major comorbidities, as data
for these subgroup analyses were not available. We planned to carry
out a subgroup analysis of trials conducted in a lower socioeco-
nomic status (SES) or lower-educated population versus a higher
SES or higher-educated populations, and identified one trial con-
ducted in a lower SES or lower-educated population (Saper 2009).
However, to use a significance test to investigate whether the sub-
group variable was associated with a statistically significant differ-
ence in outcomes between subgroups, it is necessary to have at
least two trials in each subgroup (Deeks 2001), thus, this test was
not appropriate.
Sensitivity analysis
For the primary outcomes, we compared analyses including and
excluding trials at high risk of bias (as defined in Assessment of
risk of bias in included studies) to explore the impact of risk of
bias on estimates of treatment effects. We also used sensitivity
analyses to explore the effects of using imputed versus available-
case data, and the effects of using endpoint versus change data.
For analyses that were carried out using endpoint data extracted
from figures and SDs estimated from baseline SDs, we conducted
generic inverse variance analyses using MDs and CIs, when such
data were available, to test the robustness of analyses carried out
using these different methods.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The searches retrieved 977 records. After deduplication, we
screened titles and abstracts of 486 records and the full text of
62 records. We identified records corresponding to 40 studies, of
which 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in
the review, 21 studies were excluded, four studies are awaiting
classification, and three studies are ongoing. Many studies were
associated with multiple reference records. In all cases the study
rather than the reference was the unit of interest in the review. The
flow of studies is presented in the PRISMA chart in Figure 1.

 Included studies
We included 12 parallel RCTs (1080 participants). Seven stud-
ies were conducted in the USA (Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004;
Sherman 2005; Williams 2005; Saper 2009; Williams 2009;
Sherman 2011: 583 participants), three were conducted in India
(Tekur 2008; Wattamwar 2013; Nambi 2014: 164 participants),
and two were conducted in the UK (Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011:
333participants). All studieswere clearlycarriedoutbetween2001
and 2012, except for two studies (Galantino 2004; Wattamwar
2013), which did not report the dates of study conduct. All trials
were published in English.
We have provided details about each included trial in the
Characteristics of included studies table. We have also provided
detailed information about the study populations, study interven-
tions and comparisons, and the intervention design and delivery
in additional tables (Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6).
Participants
In 10 studies, the mean age of participants was reported to be be-
tween 43 and 48 years old, in one study the mean age was reported
to be 34 years (Wattamwar 2013), and in one study the age of
participants was not reported (Galantino 2004). The percentage
of participants who were women was not reported in two studies
(Jacobs 2004; Wattamwar 2013). Among the remaining studies,
the percentage of women as 45% and 53% in the studies carried
out in India, and ranged from 64% to 83% in the studies con-
ducted outside India. Six trials reported race or ethnicity, and the
percentage of participants reported to be ’Caucasian’ or ’White’
ranged from a low of 24% in Saper 2009 to 63.5% in Jacobs 2004
to between 80% and 93% in the remaining trials (Sherman 2005;
Williams 2005; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011). Eight studies re-
ported education level, and the majority of participants had com-
pleted at least some college level of education in each of those
studies (Jacobs 2004; Sherman 2005; Williams 2005; Tekur 2008;
Saper 2009; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011).
One study did not describe the source and methods of re-
cruitment (Wattamwar 2013). In the other studies, participants
were recruited from clinical populations (Sherman 2005; Tekur
2008; Cox 2010), from both clinical and community popula-
tions (Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004; Nambi 2014; Saper 2009;
Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011; Williams 2005), or from the com-
munity (Williams 2009). For studies in which participants were
recruited through a mix of clinical and community outreach, the
majority of those screened appeared to be self-referred from the
community in Williams 2005 , and to be physician-referred poten-
tial participants in Tilbrook 2011; the mix of recruitment sources
for those screened was not described for the other studies. Most
studies were co-ordinated from a single clinical site; however, one
study was carried out at two community health centre sites (Saper
2009), one study was carried out through 39 general medical prac-
tices (Tilbrook 2011), and two studies were carried out at a co-
ordinated healthcare system with multiple clinical sites (Sherman
2005; Sherman 2011); the exact number of sites was not reported.
Interventions
Two of the studies had three comparison arms (Sherman 2005;
Sherman 2011), and all other studies had two arms. Studies com-
pared yoga to a waiting list or usual care (Galantino 2004; Jacobs
2004; Saper 2009; Williams 2009; Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011),
to a self-care book (Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011), to educa-
tional classes and written material (Williams 2005), or to exercise
(Sherman 2005; Tekur 2008; Sherman 2011; Wattamwar 2013;
Nambi 2014). Among the studies comparing yoga to a waiting
list or usual care, three studies provided supplementary written
advice or educational material to both intervention groups (Saper
2009; Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011), and one study provided sup-
plementary written material to the non-yoga intervention group
only (Jacobs 2004).
The types of yoga varied between trials. The most common type
of yoga was Iyengar yoga or a modification of Iyengar yoga. Study
authors reported using Hatha yoga (Galantino 2004; Saper 2009),
Iyengar yoga (Williams 2005; Williams 2009; Cox 2010; Nambi
2014), the ’Iyengar style of Hatha yoga’ (Jacobs 2004), a combina-
tion of Iyengar and British Wheel of Yoga (described as Hatha yoga
on the British Wheel of Yoga website) (Tilbrook 2011), a combina-
tion of Iyengar and ’traditional’ yoga (Wattamwar 2013), Viniyoga
(Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011), or ’Integrated Approach of Yoga
Therapy (IAYT)’ (Tekur 2008). All interventions included med-
itation, relaxation, or breathing exercises in addition to physical
yoga poses.
For all but one study (Tekur 2008), the yoga intervention was one
to three yoga classes per week, with each class lasting 45 to 90
minutes. In Tekur 2008, the study was carried out in a residential
setting, and the yoga group practiced approximately two hours
of yoga postures per day as well as practicing yogic meditation,
breathing, and chanting, and receiving yogic lifestyle lectures.
Outcomes
All but one of the included studies assessed back-specific func-
tion (Nambi 2014), and all but one of the included studies as-
sessed pain or pain-related outcomes (Galantino 2004). Back-
specific function was assessed using the Roland-Morris Disabil-
ity Questionnaire (Jacobs 2004; Sherman 2005; Saper 2009; Cox
2010; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011), the Oswestry Low Back
14

 Pain Questionnaire (Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004; Tekur 2008;
Williams 2009; Wattamwar 2013), or the Pain Disability Index
(Williams 2005). Pain was assessed using a 0 to 5 scale (Wattamwar
2013), a 0 to 10 scale (Jacobs 2004; Williams 2005; Tekur 2008;
Saper 2009; Nambi 2014), a 0 to 100 scale (Williams 2009), or
the Aberdeen Back Pain Scale (Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011). Two
studies did not report pain but instead reported the pain-related
outcome of ’symptom bothersomeness’ (Sherman 2005; Sherman
2011). This measures “the extent to which participants’ lives are
affected by whatever level of pain they felt”, a concept related to
but not the same as pain (Sherman 2010). Five studies reported
mental and physical quality of life (Jacobs 2004; Tekur 2008; Cox
2010; Tilbrook 2011; Nambi 2014), and three studies reported
depression (Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004; Williams 2009). Three
studies reported some measure of clinical improvement (Saper
2009; Cox 2010; Sherman 2011), and eight studies mentioned the
presence or absence of adverse events (Sherman 2005; Williams
2005; Tekur 2008; Saper 2009; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011;
Tilbrook 2011; Nambi 2014).
Excluded studies
We excluded three studies because they were not RCTs (Groessl
2012; Lee 2014; Patil 2015), and 10 studies because they were
not carried out in populations with chronic non-specific low-
back pain (Bindal 2007; Telles 2009; Pushpika 2010; Biggs 2012;
CTRI/2012/11/003094; Hartfiel 2012; Michalsen 2012; Sakuma
2012; Monro 2014; Aboagye 2015). We also excluded one study
because it compared different doses of yoga (Saper 2013), and one
study because it compared different yoga techniques (Haldavnekar
2014). Finally, we excluded six references because they were not
original study reports (Graves 2004; Borg-Olivier 2005; Anon
2006; Horng 2006; Anon 2009; Selfridge 2012). We have pro-
vided details about each of the excluded studies and the reasons
for exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

 Allocation
Seven studies were at low risk of selection bias (Jacobs 2004;
Sherman 2005; Tekur 2008; Saper 2009; Cox 2010; Sherman
2011; Tilbrook 2011). Three studiesreportedmethodsof random-
ization but allocation concealment was not reported (Galantino
2004; Williams 2005; Nambi 2014), and two studies did not re-
port details of randomization or allocation concealment (Williams
2009; Wattamwar 2013).
Blinding
No studies reported attempts to blind participants or providers.
This included the studies that compared yoga to an exercise in-
tervention, where there was no suggestion that the exercise in-
tervention was intended to appear similar to yoga. Several stud-
ies reported that the people collecting outcome information from
participants were blinded (Sherman 2005; Williams 2005; Tekur
2008; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011; Nambi 2014); however, the
measures of pain, function, and quality of life, and the clinical im-
provement outcomes deriving from those measures, were based on
self-reports by the participants, who were not themselves blinded.
Therefore, we considered all studies to be at high risk of perfor-
mance and detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Five studies were at low risk of attrition bias because they had lit-
tle or no attrition, and if they had attrition the reasons for drop-
out did not appear to differ across intervention groups (Sherman
2005; Tekur 2008; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011; Wattamwar
2013). Three studies were at unclear risk of attrition bias because
attrition was fairly low but reasons for attrition were unclear or
possibly related to outcomes, or it was unclear how missing data
were handled (Jacobs 2004; Saper 2009; Nambi 2014). Four stud-
ies were at high risk of attrition bias because attrition was at least
20% in one or both intervention groups and there were ques-
tions about relationships between attrition and the intervention or
about how missing data were handled (Galantino 2004; Williams
2005; Williams 2009; Cox 2010).
Selective reporting
When studies did not have registered or published protocols, we
rated them as at unclear risk of bias, unless we observed outcome
discrepancies between methods and results sections. The risk of
reporting bias was low in two studies because reported outcomes
were consistent with protocols (Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011),
and high in three studies due to discrepancies between methods
and results sections (Jacobs 2004; Cox 2010; Wattamwar 2013.
Group similarity at baseline
In five studies, comparison groups were similar in important prog-
nostic characteristics , and we rated these studies at low risk of bias
(Jacobs 2004; Sherman 2005; Tekur 2008; Saper 2009; Tilbrook
2011). There were important differences in baseline prognostic
indicators between groups in two studies, which we rated at high
risk of bias (Galantino 2004; Cox 2010). There were baseline dif-
ferences that were of unclear importance in three studies, which
we rated at unclear risk of bias (Williams 2005; Williams 2009;
Sherman 2011), together with the studies for which we were
unable to assess group similarity at baseline (Wattamwar 2013;
Nambi 2014).
Cointerventions
We were unable to assess cointerventions in six studies (Galantino
2004; Jacobs 2004; Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011; Wattamwar 2013;
Nambi 2014), and in six studies the cointerventions were clearly
similar between intervention groups (Sherman 2005; Williams
2005; Tekur 2008; Saper 2009; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011).
Compliance
Four studies did not report specific information on class atten-
dance, and we rated them as unclear with respect to risk of bias
related to compliance (Galantino 2004; Tekur 2008; Wattamwar
2013; Nambi 2014). Of the remaining studies, we rated one at
high risk of bias because only 50% of participants attended any
classes, and they attended fewer than 50% of available classes on
average (Cox 2010), and we rated seven at low risk of bias be-
cause they reported that between 60% and 100% of participants
attended at least 50% of classes on average (Jacobs 2004; Sherman
2005; Williams 2005; Saper2009; Williams2009; Sherman2011;
Tilbrook 2011).
Intention-to-treat analysis
We rated five studies that did not mention an intention-to-treat
analysis at unclear risk of bias (Jacobs 2004; Williams 2005; Tekur
2008; Wattamwar 2013; Nambi 2014), and studies that stated an
intention-to-treat analysis was carried out at low risk of bias. No
study clearly failed to analyze participants in the groups to which
they were randomized.
Timing of outcome assessments
Timing of outcome assessment was similar for all intervention
groups within all studies, and we rated all studies at low risk of
bias.

 Other potential sources of bias
We rated studies at unclear risk of bias from funding sources when
the trial report did not have any mention of funding (Galantino
2004; Jacobs 2004; Wattamwar 2013). We rated one study at
high risk of bias because the trial was funded by a yoga research
institution and college, the trial was carried out at the institu-
tion, and the authors were employees of the institution (Tekur
2008). All other studies were explicitly unfunded (Nambi 2014),
or funded by charity (Tilbrook 2011), university (Cox 2010;
Williams 2005), or government (Sherman 2005; Saper 2009;
Williams 2009; Sherman 2011) sources, and we rated them at low
risk of bias.
An additional potential source of bias in unblinded trials that may
be related to performance and detection bias is treatment prefer-
ence (McPherson 1997). If people who prefer to receive yoga con-
sent to be randomized, some of them will receive the non-preferred
treatment, and this may affect their willingness to continue in the
study and comply with treatment. Treatment preference may also
be related to expectations of treatment and may affect the partici-
pants’ subjective interpretationof whethertheyare benefitingfrom
the treatment. Therefore, it is possible that either through better
compliance or through placebo or other psychological processes,
participants in an unblinded trial who are allocated to a preferred
treatment for which they have good expectations of benefit may
experience better outcomes, particularly if those outcomes are self-
assessed.
A first step in assessing the impact of expectations and treatment
preference on treatment outcomes is to collect this information at
baseline. Among the studies included in this review, three studies
asked about treatment preference (Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011;
Tilbrook 2011), and five studies assessed treatment expectations
(Jacobs 2004; Sherman 2005; Williams 2009; Sherman 2011;
Tilbrook 2011). However, only one study examined whether there
was a relationship between expectations or treatment preference
and outcomes (Tilbrook 2011). The authors reported that “the
effect of treatment [on back-related function] did not vary by
baseline intervention preference (P for interaction = 0.39).”
Individual studies have limited power to detect interactions be-
tween participant preferences and treatment. To address this limi-
tation, researchers carried out an individual participant data meta-
analysis of participant preferences among people in musculoskele-
tal trials (Preference Collaborative Review Group 2008). The
meta-analysis did not show that participants allocated to non-pre-
ferred treatment were more likely to drop out. However, assess-
ment of outcomes among 1398 participants in the trials did show
that participants allocated to a preferred treatment had signifi-
cantly better outcomes than participants who were indifferent to
their treatment assignment, and non-significantly better outcomes
than participants who were allocated to a non-preferred treatment
(Preference Collaborative Review Group 2008). It appears that
preferences and expectations may play a role in participant-re-
ported outcomes, but further research on operationalizing prefer-
ences and expectations is necessary before the potential influence
of these factors in outcomes can be understood (Tran 2015).
Based on low risk of bias for the areas of allocation, attrition bias,
and other risk of bias, we classified three studies at a lower risk of
bias when carrying out sensitivity analyses by risk of bias (Sherman
2005; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011).
Effects of interventions

controls for chronic non-specific low back pain; Summary of
findings 3 Yoga compared with exercise controls for chronic

intervention; Summary of findings 4Yoga plus exercise compared
with exercise alone for chronic non-specific low back pain
We compared yoga to non-exercise controls (no treatment, a wait-
ing list, usual care, or an educational intervention), yoga to ex-
ercise controls, and yoga as an add on treatment to an exercise
intervention. See: Summary of findings for the main comparison;
Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 4.
Yoga compared to non-exercise controls
Three studies compared a yoga intervention to a waiting list
(Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004; Williams 2009); two studies com-
pared a yoga intervention to a self-care book (Sherman 2005;
Sherman 2011); three studies compared a yoga intervention plus
a self-care book to a self-care book alone (Saper 2009; Cox 2010;
Tilbrook 2011); and one study compared yoga plus newsletters,
handouts, and lectures to newsletters, handouts, and lectures alone
(Williams 2005). We analyzed these studies together (total 790
participants) because we believe that the yoga and control condi-
tions are clinically comparable across studies.
Primary outcomes
Back-specific functional status
Nine trials examined the effect of yoga compared with non-ex-
ercise controls on back-related function (Galantino 2004; Jacobs
2004; Sherman2005; Williams 2005; Saper2009; Williams2009;
Cox 2010; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011) (Analysis 1.1). There
was low-certainty evidence that yoga was better than non-exer-
cise controls at four to six weeks (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.71 to -
0.19; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 256 participants; Analysis 1.1.1), three
to four months (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.14; I2 = 54%; 7
studies, 667 participants; Analysis 1.1.2), and 12 months (SMD -
0.26, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.05; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 365 participants;
Analysis 1.1.4), and moderate-certainty evidence that yoga is bet-
ter at six months (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.22; I2 = 34%;
18

 6 studies, 630 participants; Analysis 1.1.3). The certainty of the
evidence was downgraded at four to six weeks for risk of bias and
imprecision, at three to four months for risk of bias and hetero-
geneity, at six months for risk of bias, and at 12 months for risk
of bias and imprecision. When the overall results for back-related
function at three to four months (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.66 to -
0.14; I2 = 54%; 7 studies, 667 participants; Analysis 1.1.2) were
compared to a sensitivity analysis including only studies at lower
risk of bias, the estimate of effect was slightly more beneficial and
there was no heterogeneity (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.31;
I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 480 participants; Analysis 4.3.2), suggesting
that the estimate of effect in the main analysis may be conservative.
The effect size at each time point was low to moderate, as Cohen’s
effect size of 0.50 or larger is considered moderate.
Pain
Six trials examined the effect of yoga compared with non-exer-
cise controls on pain (Jacobs 2004; Williams 2005; Saper 2009;
Williams 2009; Cox 2010; Tilbrook 2011) (Analysis 1.2). At four
to six weeks, three to four months, and six months, the effect of
yoga on pain was statistically significant but did not meet the pre-
defined criterion for clinical importance of 15 points on a 0 to 100
scale. There was very low-certainty evidence at four to six weeks
(MD -10.83, 95% CI -20.85 to -0.81; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 40 par-
ticipants; Analysis 1.2.1), moderate-certainty evidence at three to
four months (MD -4.55, 95% CI -7.04 to -2.06; I2 = 0%; 5 stud-
ies, 458 participants; Analysis 1.2.2), and low-certainty evidence
at six months (MD -7.81, 95% CI -13.37 to -2.25; I2 = 64%;
4 studies, 414 participants; Analysis 1.2.3). The certainty of the
evidence was downgraded at four to six weeks for very serious risk
of bias and imprecision, at three to four months for risk of bias,
and at six months for risk of bias and inconsistency. There is very
low-certainty evidence for no statistically or clinically significant
difference in pain between yoga and non-exercise controls at 12
months (MD -5.40, 95% CI -14.50 to 3.70; I2 = 79%; 2 studies,
355 participants; Analysis 1.2.4). The effect estimate at 12 months
was rated as very-low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias,
inconsistency, and imprecision.
Secondary outcomes
Clinical improvement
Compared to non-exercise controls, yoga participants were more
than twice as likely to experience clinical improvement at four to
six weeks (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.22 to 5.67; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 141
participants; Analysis 1.3.1), three to four months (RR 3.18, 95%
CI 1.86 to 5.44; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 168 participants; Analysis
1.3.2), and six months (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.71; 1 study,
128 participants; Analysis 1.3.3). Each estimate was statistically
significant; however, the evidence was low certainty because of
risk of bias and imprecision. We found no studies that looked at
clinical improvement at long term.
Quality of life
Evidence on physical quality of life, mental quality of life, and
depression was limited and of low or very-low certainty due to
risk of bias and imprecision. There was a small but statistically
significant increase in physical quality of life at six months (SMD
0.26, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.50; 1 study, 259 participants; Analysis
1.4.3) that was rated low certainty for risk of bias and imprecision.
A large and statistically significant decrease in depression at four
to six weeks (SMD -1.23, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.06; 1 study, 16
participants; Analysis 1.6.1) was rated very-low certainty because
of veryseriousriskof biasandimprecision. Low- tomoderate-sized
decreases in depression at six months (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.89
to -0.05; 1 study, 90 participants; Analysis 1.6.3) and 12 months
(SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.08; 1 study, 90 participants;
Analysis 1.6.4) were statistically significant but rated low certainty
because of risk of bias and imprecision. No other effects were
statistically significant.
Work-related disability
We found no studies that looked at work-related disability.
Adverse events
One study reported “no adverse events due to yoga” but also re-
ported that one yoga participant discontinued because yoga exac-
erbated low-back pain (Williams 2009). One study reported that
a yoga participant who had a history of severe pain in response
to physical activity developed severe back pain that was possi-
bly or probably related to yoga (Tilbrook 2011). This study, and
the remaining studies comparing yoga to non-exercise controls
(Sherman 2005; Williams 2005; Saper 2009; Sherman 2011), re-
ported several non-serious adverse events, primarily increased back
pain. Some of the adverse events were explicitly described as either
unrelated or perhaps related to yoga, but the relationship between
adverse events and yoga was not consistently assessed. People prac-
ticing yoga had a greater risk of adverse events than people in the
non-exercise groups (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08; I2 = 7%;
6 trials, 696 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis
1.7). The certainty of evidence for this estimate was downgraded
for risk of bias (lack of blinding).
Three studies did not report the presence or absence of adverse
events (Galantino 2004; Jacobs 2004; Cox 2010).
Yoga compared to exercise controls
Four studies compared a yoga intervention to an exercise interven-
tion (e.g. physical therapy) (Sherman 2005; Tekur 2008; Sherman
2011; Nambi 2014). The intervention in one study was four weeks
19

 of weekly yoga classes (Nambi 2014), and the intervention in
two studies was 12 weeks of weekly yoga classes (Sherman 2005;
Sherman 2011). The yoga intervention in the fourth study was a
one-week residential programme of daily yoga as part of a com-
prehensive back pain treatment programme (Tekur 2008). We an-
alyzed Tekur 2008 separately because of the brief duration, resi-
dential setting, and high intensity of the study interventions (see
’Yoga compared to exercise controls - brief and intensive residen-
tial intervention’).
Primary outcomes
Back-specific functional status
Two studies examined the effect of yoga compared with exercise on
back-related function (Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011) (Analysis
2.1). There was very low-certainty evidence showing little or no
difference between yoga and exercise at six weeks (SMD -0.02,
95% CI -0.41 to 0.37; I2 = 50%; 2 studies, 248 participants;
Analysis 2.1.1), three months (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.20;
I2 = 57%; 2 studies, 249 participants; Analysis 2.1.2), and six
months (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.19; I2 = 50%; 2 studies,
249participants; Analysis2.1.3). The certaintyof the evidence was
downgraded at each time point for risk of bias, imprecision, and
inconsistency that could not be explained. We found no studies
that looked at back-specific function at long term.
Pain
One study examined the effect of yoga compared with exercise on
pain (Nambi 2014) (Analysis 2.2). Although the reported effect of
yogaonpainwasclinicallyandstatisticallysignificant atfourweeks
(MD -15.00, 95% CI -19.90 to -10.10; 1 study, 54 participants;
Analysis 2.2.1) and seven months (MD -20.40, 95% CI -25.48
to -15.32; 1 study, 54 participants; Analysis 2.2.2), the evidence
was downgraded to very-low-certainty because of very serious risk
of bias and imprecision. We found no studies that looked at pain
at long term.
Secondary outcomes
Clinical improvement
One study compared clinical improvement with yoga versus exer-
cise (Sherman 2011). There was very-low-certainty evidence for
little or no effect of yoga on clinical improvement at six weeks (RR
1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57; 1 study, 164 participants; Analysis
2.3.1) and three months (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 1 study,
162 participants; Analysis 2.3.2), and low-certainty evidence at six
months (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.33; 1 study, 163 participants;
Analysis 2.3.3). The certainty of evidence at six weeks and three
months was downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision,
and the certainty of the evidence at six months was downgraded
for risk of bias and imprecision. We found no studies that looked
at clinical improvement at long term.
Quality of life
One study looked at physical and mental quality of life at four
weeks and seven months (Nambi 2014) (Analysis 2.4; Analysis
2.5). Although the reported effect of yoga on physical quality of
life was large and statistically significant at four weeks (SMD 1.68,
95% CI 1.06 to 2.31; 1 study, 54 participants; Analysis 2.4.1)
and seven months (SMD 1.34, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.94; 1 study, 54
participants; Analysis 2.4.2), as was the improvement in mental
quality of life at four weeks (SMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.35; 1
study, 54 participants; Analysis 2.5.1) and seven months (SMD
1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 1 study, 54 participants; Analysis
2.5.2), the evidence for each comparison was downgraded to very-
low certainty because of very serious risk of bias and imprecision.
We fund no studies that looked at depression.
Work-related disability
We found no studies that looked at work-related disability.
Adverse events
One study mentioned that one person withdrew from the yoga
group due to a herniated disc, and two people withdrew from the
yoga group due to fears that yoga would aggravate symptomatic
osteoarthritis (Nambi 2014). One study described one yoga par-
ticipant as discontinuing yoga because some postures precipitated
migraine headache (Sherman 2005), and one study described sev-
eral mild or moderate adverse events, primarily increased back
pain, in both the exercise and yoga groups (Sherman 2011). There
was low-certainty evidence that there may be little to no differ-
ence in risk of adverse events between people practicing yoga and
people practicing other exercise treatments (RD 0.01, 95% CI
0.04 to 0.06; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 314 participants; Analysis 2.6).
The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias and
imprecision.

 One trial compared the effects of brief and intensive yoga and
exercise interventions on back-related function (Tekur 2008). Al-
though the effect of yoga on back-related function at one week
was large and statistically significant, the certainty of the evidence
was downgraded to very low because of serious risk of bias and
imprecision (SMD -1.25, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.77; 1 study, 80 par-
ticipants; Analysis 2.1.4). There was no information on outcomes
beyond the end of the study at one week.
Pain
One trial compared the effects of brief and intensive yoga and
exercise interventions on pain (Tekur 2008). Although the effect
of yoga on pain at one week was large and statistically significant,
the certainty of the evidence for both effects was downgraded to
very low because of serious risk of bias and imprecision (MD -
14.50, 95% -22.92 to -6.08; 1 study, 80 participants; Analysis
2.2.3). There was no information on outcomes beyond the end of
the study at one week.
Secondary outcomes
Clinical improvement
Tekur 2008 did not report clinical improvement.
Quality of life
Although the effect of yoga was large and statistically significant
for both physical quality of life (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53;
1 study, 80 participants; Analysis 2.4.3) and mental quality of
life (SMD 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.33; 1 study, 80 participants,
Analysis 2.5.3) in Tekur 2008, the certainty of the evidence for
both effects was downgraded to very low because of very serious
risk of bias and imprecision. There was no information on clinical
improvement, depression, or work-related disability.
Work-related disability
Tekur 2008 did not report work-related disability.
Adverse events
Tekur 2008 reported that there were no adverse events in either
intervention group.
Yoga as an add-on intervention to an exercise
intervention
One study compared yoga plus exercise to exercise alone (
Wattamwar 2013). The studycomparedthree weeklyoccupational
therapy classes (characterized as back school therapy and mat and
exercise ball exercises) to two weekly occupational therapy classes
and one weekly yoga class. We analyzed this study (24 participants)
separately from the other yoga and exercise comparisons because
the combination of yoga and occupational therapy was unlike any
of the other yoga comparisons with exercise, in which only yoga
was provided to the intervention group and the non-yoga exercise
was only provided to the comparison group.
Primary outcomes
Back-specific functional status
There was no statistically significant benefit for back-specific func-
tion at 10 weeks (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.42 to 0.22; 1 study,
24 participants; Analysis 3.1). The certainty of the evidence was
downgraded to very low for very serious risk of bias and impreci-
sion. There was no information on outcomes beyond the end of
the study at 10 weeks.
Pain
There was no statistically significant benefit for pain at 10 weeks
(MD -3.20, 95% CI -13.76 to 7.36; 1 study, 24 participants;
Analysis 3.2). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded to
very low for very serious risk of bias and imprecision. There was
no information on outcomes beyond the end of the study at 10
weeks.

 Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
Our sensitivity analyses based on complete cases either did not
result in differences from our primary analyses or resulted in in-
creased benefits of yoga, which is consistent with participants who
benefit from yoga remaining in treatment and available for follow-
up (Analysis 4.1; Analysis 4.5; Analysis 4.12; Analysis 5.1).
Our sensitivity analyses by change scores did not reveal any marked
differences from our primary analyses (Analysis 4.2; Analysis 4.6;
Analysis 4.9; Analysis 4.11; Analysis 4.13).
Sensitivity analysis restricting included studies to those at lower
risk of bias did not reveal any marked differences between anal-
yses including and excluding studies at higher risk of bias, with
two exceptions (Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011; Tilbrook 2011)
(Analysis 4.3; Analysis 4.7; Analysis 4.10). In the comparison of
yoga and non-exercise controls, analyses of pain at intermedi-
ate term (Analysis 1.2.3) and long term (Analysis 1.2.4) showed
markedly lower effect estimates when included studies were re-
stricted to those at low risk of bias (intermediate term: Analysis
4.6.3, long term: Analysis 4.6.4). This may be due to the longer
duration of yoga treatment in the trials deemed to be higher risk of
bias (Williams 2005; Williams 2009), reflecting that the benefits
of 16 or 24 weeks of treatment are greater at six or 12 months af-
ter randomization than are any benefits of 12 weeks of treatment.
Otherwise, the effect estimates in the sensitivity analyses were sim-
ilar, indicating that the overall results for analyses including a mix
of studies at higher and lower risk of bias are robust to influence
from study risk of bias.
A sensitivity analysis of back-related function using generic inverse
variance was consistent with endpoint analyses for back-related
function, with one exception (Analysis 4.4; Analysis 5.2). In the
comparison of yoga and exercise controls, the endpoint analysis of
back-related function at short term (Analysis 2.1.1) included two
trials (Sherman 2005; Sherman 2011), but it was not possible to
include data from one of those trials in the generic inverse variance
analysis (Sherman 2005) (Analysis 5.2.1). Therefore, the analyses
were not comparable.
Sensitivity analyses of pain outcomes using SMDs (Analysis 4.8;
Analysis 5.3; Analysis 6.1) were broadly consistent with analyses
using MDs of pain outcomes rescaled to a 100-point scale and
compared to a minimum clinically important reduction of 15
points on that scale. In analyses with I2 values above zero, the I
2 statistic was slightly higher when the MD was used, but there
was no difference in statistical significance between the MD and
the SMD. When MDs were at an absolute value of 10.83 or less,
the absolute values of the SMDs ranged from 0.65 to 0.23. When
MDs were at an absolute value of 14.50 or more, the absolute
values of the SMDs ranged from 0.75 to 2.14. The cutoff point
of 15 for clinical significance therefore appears at the border of a
large effect size according to Cohen’s (SMD 0.8 or greater).
A subgroup analysis by SES status of trial participants reveal no
systematic differences between trials in higher and lower SES status
populations (Analysis 4.14). Outcomes were positive in all studies,
and it was not possible to determine whether the lack of statistical
significance for outcomes in the low SES trial was due to the small
sample size in that trial, to different effects of yoga in low SES
populations, or to chance.

Summary of main results
Yoga compared to non-exercise controls
We found evidence that yoga results in a small-to-moderate im-
provement in back-related function at short, short-to-intermedi-
ate, intermediate, and long term. The evidence was of moder-
ate certainty at intermediate term, but it was of low certainty at
earlier and later time points. We also found evidence that yoga
may result in small improvements in pain at short, short-to-in-
termediate, intermediate, and long term. The evidence on pain
was of moderate certainty at short-to-intermediate term, but low
certainty at intermediate term, and very-low certainty at short and
long term. Differences in pain were not clinically significant at any
time point. We found low-certainty evidence that overall clinical
improvement was more than twice as likely with yoga, but there
was very sparse evidence on mental and physical quality of life or
depression. There was moderate-certainty evidence that adverse
events, primarily exacerbation of back pain, were more common
in yoga than in non-exercise control groups, although not all stud-
ies reported assessing adverse events. Yoga was not associated with
serious adverse events.
Yoga compared to exercise controls
There may be little or no difference between yoga and non-yoga
exercise with regard to back-related function at short, short-to-
intermediate, and intermediate term. The available evidence was
of very-low certainty because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and im-
precision. We found one study reporting clinically and statistically
significant benefits for pain with yoga at intermediate term, but
the evidence on pain was very-low certainty because of serious risk
of bias and imprecision. The evidence on the comparison between
yoga and non-yoga exercise was sparse overall, and we found no
studies that looked at back-related function or pain at long term.
We found little information on overall clinical improvement or
quality of life. There was low-certainty evidence that the risk of
adverse events in yoga and non-yoga exercise groups was similar,
although not all studies assessed adverse events. No serious adverse
events were reported.
One small study (80 participants) compared an intensive one-
week residential yoga programme to an intensive one-week res-
idential exercise programme, and found a large improvement in
back-related function and pain for yoga compared to non-yoga
at the end of treatment (Tekur 2008). However, the certainty of
evidence on this comparison was very low due to serious risk of
bias and imprecision.
Yoga as an add-on intervention to an exercise
intervention
For yoga added to exercise compared to exercise alone, we found
one very small study (24 participants) that compared yoga plus
occupational therapy to occupational therapy alone for 10 weeks
(Wattamwar 2013). The evidence is very low certainty due to
serious risk of bias and imprecision, and we are uncertain about
the effects of yoga added to exercise. There was no mention of
other outcomes or adverse events and no follow-up of participants
beyond the 10 weeks of the intervention.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The trials included in this review were carried out in the US,
India, and the UK, with a mix of primary care and community
participants. The type of yoga was primarily Iyengar and some
other mixed Hatha yoga practices, and the yoga interventions were
specifically designed for people with low-back pain. The instruc-
tors had a range of yoga training backgrounds and experience with
people with low-back pain. The results of this review could be
generalized across multiple Hatha yoga practices and sources of
participants (primary care or community), however there is little
or no trial evidence from low SES populations, older populations,
or populations with serious comorbidities. We found inconsistent
reporting of adverse events, with some studies not mentioning sa-
fety outcomes, which makes it difficult to assess the balance of
benefits and harms for the practice of yoga. It should be noted that
the yoga interventions were designed specifically for people with
low-back pain and classes were supervised by instructors with good
levels of training, and therefore this evidence of benefit and lack
of serious harms would not necessarily apply to all yoga practices
or to yoga undertaken without trained guidance.
Quality of the evidence
None of the included studies blinded participants or providers to
treatment assignment, and all outcomes were self-reported.There-
fore, all studies were at high risk of performance and detection
bias, and we judged none of the evidence of ’high’ certainty. Some
comparisons between yoga and we judged non-exercise controls
for back-related function and pain produced estimates of moder-
ate certainty. However, most outcomes were downgraded for im-
precision (few participants) and some were downgraded for in-
consistency (heterogeneity between studies), and therefore most
comparisons between yoga and non-exercise controls were of low
or very low certainty.
The number of studies on yoga versus exercise controls was small
and some studies had serious risks of bias, and the evidence for
this comparison was therefore of low or very low certainty due to
imprecision and risk of bias. There was only one study on yoga
30

 as an add-on intervention to an exercise intervention, and the
certainty of the evidence for this comparison was very low because
of very serious risk of bias and imprecision.
Although some heterogeneity was expected, many analyses dis-
played unexplained heterogeneity that required downgrading the
evidence. Potential sources of heterogeneity, including the char-
acteristics of the yoga and control interventions, and the duration
of treatment and follow-up, were difficult to explore through sub-
group analysis because of the complex patterns of variation be-
tween the trials. We had planned to compare yoga interventions
with and without a mind component but found no interventions
clearly carried out without a mind component. Although the style
of yoga was most frequently characterized as Iyengar, most yoga
interventions were specially modified or developed for the trials
and we could not identify patterns of yoga postures to use for sub-
grouping. It should be noted that research indicates that random-
ized trials of yoga with different yoga styles do not differ in their
odds of reaching positive conclusions (Cramer 2016b). Regard-
ing the intensity of the yoga intervention, most studies provided
weekly yoga classes, and we analysed separately the yoga trial that
was very intensive and provided daily yoga. We considered sub-
group analyses by type of non-exercise intervention, but found this
difficult because, with the exception of Galantino 2004 for short
-term outcomes and Williams 2005 for longer-term outcomes, all
non-exercise control groups were provided with educational mate-
rials, which were not always well-described. Furthermore, in some
trials (e.g. Jacobs 2004; Saper 2009), the intervention group also
received educational materials, while in other trials they did not.
Finally, seven trials reported outcomes at long-term follow-up af-
ter the end of yoga classes: three months after treatment (Sherman
2005; Williams 2005; Saper 2009; Sherman 2011), six months
after treatment (Williams 2009; Nambi 2014), and nine months
after treatment (Tilbrook 2011). In all but one trial (Williams
2009), all outcomes at intermediate term were measured in par-
ticipants who were no longer on treatment. Although it is possible
that effects of interventions would decrease with increasing time
off treatment, and we hypothesized that this was one reason for
observing a smaller effect size for pain at six months in higher-
certainty studies that also had shorter treatment durations, we did
not observe the same relationship for back-related function. It was
not possible to separate the issue of treatment duration and study
quality, and we also could not discern any general relationship be-
tween effect size and time after end of treatment.
Potential biases in the review process
We did not examine comparisons for publication bias using funnel
plots because no comparison had the required minimum of 10
studies. Although we carried out extensive searches for studies,
and contacted authors of identified studies to obtain unpublished
information as well as clarifications of published data, we cannot
rule out the possibility of publication bias. Specifically, we found
one study that may have been completed over two years ago, but
for which we were unable to find any usable results (Saper 2015).
We cannot rule out the possibility that this and additional studies
that are unknown to us have not been published and that their
results might be less positive than the results we found in published
studies. We also note that the three studies carried out in India
were at high risk of bias, and that Indian trials of yoga have been
found to be more positive than non-Indian trials (Cramer 2015a).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Despite some differences in specific included studies, outcomes
assessed, and choices of outcome time points, our findings are in
broad agreement with other reviews of yoga treatment for low back
pain (Posadzki 2011; Cramer 2013; Hill 2013; Holtzman 2013;
Ward 2013; Crow 2015). Yoga appears to be more effective than
non-exercise interventions and either as effective or slightly more
effective than non-yoga exercise interventions. This review agrees
with previous reviews in finding that the evidence for comparisons
with non-exercise controls is clearer and the benefits of yoga are
larger, while any advantage of yoga over non-yoga exercise is rela-
tively uncertain.
Although RCTs are not good sources of information on rare ad-
verse events, our review was also consistent with a previous sys-
tematic review of the safety of yoga in finding that yoga results in
more adverse events than psychological or educational interven-
tions but the same number of adverse events as non-yoga exercise
(Cramer 2015b).

Implications for practice
We found moderate-certainty evidence that yoga is more effective
than non-exercise controls for back-related functioning at inter-
mediate term (six months) and for pain at short-to-intermediate
term (three to four months). We found low to very low-certainty
evidence that yoga may be more effective for back-related function
and pain at other time points. Differences for pain were not clin-
ically significant at any time point, and differences for back func-
tion were small to moderate. It is uncertain whether yoga might
be more effective than other exercises for back-related functioning
or pain. It appears that yoga is not associated with serious adverse
events. If yoga is more effective than a non-exercise intervention,
and as effective as other exercise interventions, the choice to use
yoga may depend on availability, cost, and participant or provider
preference. All yoga interventions that were tested were specifically
designed for treatment of low back pain, and were provided by ex-
perienced teachers, factors which may be related to both effective-
ness and safety. This review does not include studies comparing
31

 different types or doses of yoga, and does not provide information
on particular types or regimens of yoga practice.
Implications for research
There is a need for additional research testing yoga versus non-ex-
ercise controls to improve the confidence in the estimates of effect.
Current trials provide relatively little information on the effects
of yoga on pain, and on outcomes at long term. Also, most tri-
als testing yoga versus non-exercise controls have been carried out
in well-educated, middle and upper socioeconomic status (SES)
populations in the US or UK. Therefore, there is a need for fur-
ther trials in a range of populations, including low SES popula-
tions, older people, and populations with comorbidities. One of
the studies awaiting classification was carried out in a low SES
population (Saper 2015), and one was carried out in older people
(NCT01303588). Additional studies carried out in Europe, In-
dia, and East Asia might test the relevance of yoga in populations
in different healthcare settings and with different approaches to
yoga. Finally, there is limited evidence on the comparative effects
of yoga and non-yoga exercise regimens, and additional high-cer-
tainty studies testing yoga versus non-yoga exercise would be use-
ful in clarifying the comparative benefits of these therapies, what
elements of yoga might be of most benefit, and what types of
people might be most suited to using yoga to manage back pain.
These studies should be of low risk of bias and should include
reporting on adverse events. Trials should also include measure-
ment of depression and quality of life, to investigate whether the
mind component of yoga is effective in improving these patient-
important outcomes, and should include long-term follow-up to
demonstrate whether yoga is likely to be acceptable and effective in
usual clinical practice. There is also a need for additional method-
ological research in this field, particularly into the potential influ-
ence of people’s preferences and expectations on outcomes within
randomized trials of yoga.

practice handouts and encouraged to practice yoga at home, as well as taught to have
better awareness of posture, movement and correct breathing.” The frequency and du-
ration of suggested home practice was not described
Back Book group: control group received a booklet with advice on how to manage low-
back pain (The Back Book. London: The Stationery Office; 2007) and continued their
usual care
Common interventions: both the Back Book and the Yoga group received the booklet
and usual care
Cointerventions: no mention of included or excluded cointerventions
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 12 weeks and follow-up ended
directly after the end of the intervention
Outcomes
Back-specific function (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) reported at 4 and 12
weeks
Back pain (Aberdeen Back Pain Scale) reported at 4 and 12 weeks
Quality of life - mental (SF-12 Mental Component score) reported at 4 and 12 weeks
Quality of life - physical (SF-12 Physical Component score) reported at 4 and 12 weeks
Clinical improvement (number of participants reporting no low-back pain) reported at
4 and 12 weeks
Other outcomes collected: EQ-5D health index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, num-
ber of days spent in bed due to low-back pain, number of days with restricted activity
attributed to low-back pain, and whether medication was used for low-back pain over
the previous 4 weeks

Interventions
Yoga group: weekly 60-min Iyengar yoga classes for 4 weeks. A series of 29 postures were
used, including forward bends, twists, and inversions but excluding back bends. Poses
progressed from simpler to more challenging over time. “A variety of props were used
including sticks, mats, belts, blocks, chairs, wall ropes, benches, boxes, stools, trestle,
and weights.”
Home practice: requested 30 min, 5 days/week during the intervention
Exercise group: participants were asked to practice individually prescribed exercises
for strengthening and stretching the abdominal or back muscles (or both) for 4 weeks,
beginning with 5 repetitions for 3 days/week and increasing to 15 repetitions for 5 days/
week. Exercise sessions were preceded by warm-up exercises consisting of stretching and
relaxation
Common interventions: both groups received 1-hour lecture and handouts on physical
therapy for chronic low-back pain 2 weeks before the beginning of the intervention
Cointerventions: exercise group participants were asked not to participate in other exer-
cises for their low back
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 4 weeks and there was an ad-
ditional follow-up at 6 months after programme completion (7 months after random-
ization)

Mean days of mental distress in the previous 30 days at 4 weeks and 7 months
Mean days of physical distress in the previous 30 days at 4 weeks and 7 months
Other outcomes collected:
days of mental distress and physical distress were also dichotomized into frequent (≥
14 days) and infrequent (< 14 days) distress at 4 weeks and 7 months; days of activity
limitations (how many days did poor physical or mental health keeps you from doing
your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation?) was assessed for the previous
30 days at 4 weeks and 6 months and dichotomized into frequent (≥ 14 days) and
infrequent (< 14 days) limitations
Notes
Adverse events: there was no specific discussion of overall safety or adverse events. How-
ever, it was mentioned that 1 person withdrew from the yoga group due to a herniated
disc, and 2 people withdrew from the yoga group due to fears that yoga would aggravate

Methods
Randomized controlled parallel-group trial
Participants
101 participants with chronic non-specific low-back pain
Setting: trial run through an integrated healthcare system. Yoga classes were heldat health
system facilities (number of facilities not stated)
Country: USA.
Recruitment: invitations describing study sent by researchers to people with primary care
provider visits between 3 and 15 months before the study for treatment of back pain.
Self-referral through advertisements in a health plan consumer magazine
Inclusion criteria: men and women aged 20 to 64 years with a recent primary care visit
for low-back pain
Exclusion criteria: people with back pain that was complicated (e.g. sciatica), potentially
attributable to underlying disease or conditions (e.g. pregnancy), minimal (rating < 3 on
a ’bothersomeness’ scale of 0 to 10), had been treated with yoga or exercise in the past
year, or was currently being treated with other interventions. People were excluded if they
had a possible disincentive to improve (e.g. were receiving worker’s compensation), had
severe or unstable medical or psychiatric conditions or dementia, had contraindications
to the intervention (e.g. symptoms consistent with severe disc disease), were unable
to participate in classes or unwilling to practice at home, or were unable to speak or
understand English
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 12 weeks and there was an
additional follow-up at 26 weeks
Interventions
Yoga group: 12 weekly 75-min Viniyoga classes, each with a specific focus: “relaxation;
strength building, flexibility, and large-muscle movement; asymmetric poses; strength-
ening the hip muscles; lateral bending; integration; and customizing a personal practice.

” “[A]ll the sessions emphasized use of postures and breathing for managing low back
symptoms....” “[P]ostures were selected from a core of 17 relatively simple postures....”
“Each class included a question-and-answer period, an initial and final breathing exer-
cise, 5-12 postures, and a guided deep relaxation.”
Home practice: daily home practice was encouraged and yoga participants received CDs
“to guide them through the postures with the appropriate mental focus....”
Exercise group: 12 weekly 75-min exercise classes. The exercise intervention was de-
signed by a physiotherapist and was likely different from previous physiotherapy. The
exercise sessions began with an educational talk, then simple warm-ups and a series of
7 aerobic exercises and 10 strengthening exercises, ending with stretching exercises and
a short, unguided period of deep breathing. Daily home practice was encouraged and
exercise participants received a handout to assist them in home practice
Self-care group: a copy of an evidence-based book of self-care strategies (Moore 1999)
was mailed to participants.
Common interventions: all participants continued to have “access to all medical care
provided by their insurance plan.”
Cointerventions: no specific mention of allowed or restricted cointerventions
Outcomes
Back-specific function (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) reported at 6, 12, and
26 weeks
Other outcomes collected: Bothersomeness of pain during the previous week (0 = “not
at all bothersome” and 10 = “extremely bothersome”); SF-36 Mental Health component
(not reported in results); SF-36 Physical Health component (not reported in results);
changes in medication use at 6 and 12 months
Notes
Adverse events: “No serious adverse events were reported. One participant discontinued
yoga classes because postures that required her to move her head below her heart pre-
cipitated her migraine headaches. One participant in the exercise class strained her back
during class and sought care from a chiropractor.”
Measurement of expectations or treatment preferences at baseline: “Participants were
asked to describe their current pain and to rate their expectations for each intervention.
” Table 1 showed median expectation of helpfulness for each treatment in each group:
median of 8 for exercise and yoga in both the exercise and yoga groups, a median of
8.5 for exercise and 9 for yoga in the self-care group, and a median of 4 or 5 for self-
care in each intervention group. The preferred treatment was also shown in Table 1.
It was exercise for 26% to 33%, yoga for 27% to 44%, and other for 28% to 40%.
“They reported similar expectations of helpfulness from yoga or exercise but had lower
expectations for the book.”

Country: USA
Recruitment: invitations mailed to people with primary care visits for back pain, adver-
tisements in a health plan consumer magazine, and direct-mail postcards. For 4 cohorts,
augmentation of recruitment through outreach to general population (methods not de-
scribed)
Inclusion criteria: men and women aged 20 to 64 years with low-back pain
Exclusion criteria: people with back pain that was attributable to a specific cause (e.g.
spondylolisthesis), or an underlying condition (e.g. pregnancy), complex (e.g. sciatica)
, minimally painful (i.e. rating of < 3 on a ’bothersomeness’ scale of 0 to 10), or not
chronic (i.e. duration < 3 months). People were excluded if they had contraindications
to the interventions (e.g. severe disc disease), had major depression, were unable to give
informed consent or participate in interviews owing to mental or medical issues (e.g.
dementia) or an inability to speak English, or were unable to participate in classes or
unwilling to practice at home
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 12 weeks and there was an
additional follow-up at 26 weeks
Interventions
Yoga group: 12 weekly 75-min Viniyoga classes. The Viniyoga intervention was the
same as that used in an earlier trial (Sherman 2005). Classes included breathing exercises,
a set of 5 to 11 postures, and guided deep relaxation. “Six distinct and progressive classes
were taught in pairs.”
Home practice: encouraged for 20 min on non-class days. Yoga participants received a
handout and CD to assist them in home practice
Exercise group: 12 weekly 75-min exercise classes. The exercise intervention was adapted
from the intervention used in an earlier trial (Sherman 2005). Classes included aerobic
exercises, stretches, and strengthening exercises. Home practice was encouraged for 20
min on non-class days. Exercise participants received a handout and DVD to assist them
in home practice
Self-care group: participants received a copy of a book (Moore 1999) providing infor-
mation on causes of back pain and advice on how to manage pain

Notes
Adverse events: “Of the 87 yoga and 75 stretching class attendees, 13 in each group
reported a mild or moderate adverse experience possibly related to treatment (mostly
increased back pain), and 1 yoga attendee experienced a herniated disk. One of 45 persons
randomized to self-care reported increased pain after doing recommended exercises.”
Measurement of expectations or treatment preferences at baseline: “Before randomiza-
tion, information on sociodemographic characteristics, back pain history, and treatment-
related beliefs was collected.” Table 1 showed the median expectation of helpfulness for
each treatment in each group: it was a median of 8 for yoga and exercise for all groups
and a median of 4 for self-care for all groups. The preferred treatment was also shown
in Table 1. It was yoga for 26% to 32%, exercise for 17% to 22%, and other for 51% to

Methods
Randomized controlled parallel-group trial
Participants
313 participants with chronic non-specific low-back pain
Setting: 39 general practices. Yoga classes were held in 13 non-National Health Service
premises in 5 geographic areas
Country: England
Recruitment: “Participating general medical practices searched patient databases and
mailed out an invitation packet to all individuals aged 18 to 65 years who had a visit
for low back pain in the past 18 months; database searches were undertaken in 2 waves.
In addition, during the second wave of recruitment, advertisements were also placed in
local media.”
Inclusion criteria: men and women aged 18 to 65 years with low-back pain (i.e. muscu-
loskeletal pain bounded by the lowest ribs and gluteal folds) in the previous 18 months,
a score of ≥ 4 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and ability to attend 1
of the yoga classes
Exclusion criteria: “Patients were excluded if they 1) did not return a baseline question-
naire (second recruitment wave only), 2) had performed yoga in the previous 6 months,
3) could not get off the floor unaided, 4) could not use stairs, 5) were pregnant, 6) had
life-threatening comorbid conditions, 7) had previously undergone spinal surgery, 8) had
severe documented psychiatric problems or alcohol dependency, and 9) had indications
of serious spinal neurologic abnormality (1 or more of the following: difficulty passing
urine; numbness around their back passage, genitals, or inner thighs; numbness, pins
and needles, or weakness in both legs; or unsteadiness on feet).”
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 12 weeks and there was an
additional follow-up at 12 months
Interventions

the weekly theme; pain-relieving or settling-in relaxing poses; a programme of seated,
standing, prone, and supine poses; educative postural advice; and 5 to 15 minutes of
relaxation.”
Home practice: “Participants were encouraged to undertake yoga for 30 minutes daily
or to practice at least 2 times per week, and to use the [relaxation] compact disc.”
Usual care group: participants received a copy of a booklet on managing low-back pain
(Burton 2002), and continued to receive usual care.
Common interventions: both groups received a copy of the back pain booklet (Burton
2002), and continued to receive usual care.
Cointerventions: no specific mention of included or excluded cointerventions

Notes
Adverse events: “Twelve of 156 (8%) yoga participants and 2 of 157 (1%) usual care
participants reported adverse events. In the yoga group, 1 adverse event was classified by
the authorsasseriousandpossiblyorprobablyrelatedtoyoga(the participantexperienced
severe pain but had a history of severe pain after any physical activity); the remaining
11 were classified as nonserious and mostly related to increased pain. In the usual care
group, 2 serious adverse events
occurred.”
Measurement of expectations or treatment preferences at baseline: “Secondary outcomes
were … 8) beliefs, expectations, and preferences for treatment at baseline (22, 23).”
Table 1 showed that expectation that yoga works was 57% in yoga group and 55%
in usual care group. Belief that yoga works was 60% in yoga group and 52% in usual
care group. Intervention preference was 72% yoga, 3% usual care, and 25% indifferent
in yoga group, and 61% yoga, 4% usual care, and 35% indifferent in usual care. For
the primary outcome of back-related function, “the effect of treatment did not vary by
baseline intervention preference (P for interaction = 0.39).”
Unpublished data: Dr Helen Tilbrook and Dr Catherine Hewitt clarified the numbers
of participants for analyses in an e-mail to LSW on 3 March 3 2015 and sent endpoint
values for back-related function, pain, physical quality of life, and mental quality of life
to LSW by e-mail on 21 December 2015

Methods
Randomized controlled parallel-group trial
Participants
24 participants with chronic non-specific low-back pain
Setting: setting of trial was not described. Yoga classes were held at an Iyenger Yoga centre
Country: India
Recruitment: not described.
Inclusion criteria: ambulatory men and women aged 20 to 50 years with a history of
low-back pain and symptom duration > 3 months
Exclusion criteria: low-back pain attributable to any pathology, a history of trauma, or
any neurological condition
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 10 weeks and there was no
additional follow-up
Interventions
Yoga group: 1 × 45- to 60-min session of Iyengar-based yoga - using props - per week for
10 weeks. 2 × 45- to 60-min occupational therapy sessions were also received each week.
This was the same as the occupational therapy received by the control group, except that
some simple asanas and pranayamas were added to the occupational therapy sessions for
the yoga group
Home practice: back exercises with additional simple asanas and pranayamas was sug-
gested. Frequency and duration of this home practice was not described

of education, mat exercises, and Swiss ball exercises. A home programme of back exercises
was suggested
Common interventions: no additional interventions.
Cointerventions: no specific mention of included or excluded cointerventions
Outcomes
Back-specific function (Oswestry Disability Index) reported at 10 weeks. The Oswestry
Disability Index consists of 10 questions each rated on a 0 to 5 scale (higher score is worse
function). Usually the individual scores are summed and multiplied by 2 to produce an
overall rating on a 0 to 100 scale. The study authors provided each of the individual
mean differences and an overall mean difference, for each group. Based on these data, it
appears that the study authors did not multiply the total by 2 and the reported Oswestry
total is on a scale of 0 to 50. Therefore, we multiplied the totals by 2 for data entry in
this review
Back pain (pain intensity subscore of the Oswestry Disability Index, scale was 0 to 5;
higher values indicated greater pain) reported at 10 weeks
Other outcomes collected: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (outcome not ex-
tractable), changes in range of motion of thoraco-lumbar spine, and change in muscle
strength of abdominals and back extensors
Notes
Adverse events: no discussion of overall safety or adverse events
Measurement of expectations or treatment preferences at baseline: none
Unpublished data: Dr Ravi Wattamwar was contacted to clarify sample size and standard
deviations of change or confidence interval for Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
on 2 April 2015. He replied to the e-mail but did not forward the information

Methods
Randomized controlled parallel-group trial
Participants
60 participants with chronic non-specific low-back pain
Setting: setting of trial was not described. Yoga was delivered in a community yoga studio
Country: USA
Recruitment: “Subjects were recruited through physician and self-referral. Local physi-
cians were informed about the study through lectures and mailed announcements. The
project was announced to the public through flyers, public radio, and local university
list serve for faculty and staff.”
Inclusion criteria: ambulatory English-speaking men and women aged > 18 years with a
history of low-back pain and symptom duration > 3 months
Exclusion criteria: low-back pain attributable to “nerve root compression, disc prolapse,
spinal stenosis, tumor, spinal infection, alkylosing spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, kypho-
sis or structural scoliosis, or a widespread neurological disorder.” People were also ex-
cluded if they were “pre-surgical candidates, were involved in litigation or compensation,
displayed a compromised cardiopulmonary system, were pregnant, had a body mass in-
dex >35, were experiencing major depression or substance abuse and were practitioners
of yoga.” People were excluded if they would not agree to “forgo other forms of CAM
during the study”
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 16 weeks and there was an
additional follow-up at 3 months after end of treatment (7 months after randomization)
Interventions
Yoga group: 1 × 90-min Iyengar yoga class per week for 16 weeks. Classes used supine,
seated, and standing poses; forward bends, twists, and inversions; and progressed from
simple to more challenging poses. A range of props were used. The yoga group also
received 16 weekly newsletters, written by physiotherapy students, on back care
Home practice: encouraged to practice at home for 30 min/day, 5 days/week

Common interventions: all participants could continue usual medical care for low-back
pain. 2 weeks before the beginning of the 16-week study period, both groups received 2
× 1-hour lectures on low-back pain and were given instructional handouts
Cointerventions: participants were only eligible for the study if they agreed to “forgo
other forms of CAM during the study”
Outcomes
Back-specific function (Pain Disability Index) reported at 16 weeks and 7 months
Back pain (VAS from Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire) reported at 16 weeks and
7 months
Other outcomes collected: pain-related fears to movement, beliefs associated with ad-
justment to chronic pain, coping strategies, perception of self-efficacy, spinal range of
motion, and changes from baseline in medications reported at baseline
Notes
Adverse events: 1 adverse event in the yoga group, “a subject with symptomatic os-
teoarthritis who was diagnosed with a herniated disc during the study...” “Review of the
adverse event by a medical panel summoned by the Institutional Review Board deter-
mined that it was unrelated to the performance of yoga postures.” 1 older participant in
the educational control group died

Setting: setting of trial was not described. Yoga was delivered in a yoga studio
Country: USA
Recruitment: self-referral. Details of recruitment not described
Inclusion criteria: English-speaking men and women aged 18 to 70 years with a history
of low-back pain and symptom duration > 3 months. Participants were required to live
within a 1-hour drive of study site, to be insured by a participating provider, to have
a BMI < 37, and to be able to get up and down from the floor and rise to a standing
position without assistance. Back pain-related eligibility criteria were a score of 10 to
60 on the Oswestry Disability Index and a score of 3 cm to 8 cm on the VAS scale.
Participants were required to agree not to get chiropractic, massage, Pilates, acupuncture,
or any other yoga treatment during the study. Participants were required to agree that if
they were randomized to yoga therapy they would attend a minimum number of yoga
classes and practice at home

Exclusion criteria: low-back pain attributable to “spinal stenosis with pseudoclaudica-
tion, abdominal or spine tumors, spinal infection, osteoporosis with vertebral fractures,
ankylosing spondylitis, spondylolisthesis w/radiculopathy, structural kyphosis or scolio-
sis, radicular pain with weakness or loss of reflexes, failed back syndrome.” People were
also excluded if they were presurgical candidates, pregnant, undergoing cancer treatment,
had confirmed fibromyalgia, an abdominal hernia, a compromised cardiopulmonary
system, major depression, widespread neurological disorder, or substance abuse issues.
People were excluded if they were currently involved in back-related litigation or a work-
ers’ compensation case, or had practiced yoga once per week for at least 3 months within
the last year
Duration and follow-up: interventions were provided for 24 weeks and there was an
additional follow-up at 24 weeks after end of treatment (48 weeks after randomization)
Interventions
Yoga group: 2 × 90-min Iyengar yoga classes per week for 24 weeks.
Home practice: “Participants were also directed to practice 30 minutes of yoga at home
on nonclass days and were supplied with props, a DVD, and an Iyengar yoga instruction
manual with photographs and instructions.”
Self-directed standard medical care group: usual medical care.
Common interventions: none
Cointerventions: participants were only eligible for the study if they agreed to forgo
chiropractic, massage, Pilates, acupuncture, or any other yoga treatment during the study
Outcomes
Back-specific function (Oswestry Disability Index) reported at 12, 24, and 48 weeks
Back pain (VAS 0 to 100) reported at 12, 24, and 48 weeks.
Other outcomes collected: depression and self-reported medication usage
Notes
Adverse events: “One adverse event was reported during the 6-month follow-up period
in association with physical therapy, not the yoga intervention.” It is unclear which group
this adverse event occurred in. Figure 1 also shows that 1 yoga participant discontinued
because yoga exacerbated low-back pain
Measurement of expectations or treatment preferences at baseline: in Table 3 the means
(SEM) of treatment expectancy for yoga on an 11-point scale were 7.8 (0.23) for the
yoga group and 8.1 (0.21) for the standard medical care group, and the means (SEM)
of treatment expectancy for standard medical care were 4.8 (0.32) for the yoga group
and 4.7 (0.24) for the standard medical group (all scores were prerandomization but
postrandomization scores are also given). The study authors reported that “dropouts had
lower post randomization expectation for [standard medical care] treatment (P= 0.016)
than completers.”
Note that there were 12 yoga participants and 4 standard medical care participants who
dropped out

Table 2. Criteria for a judgement of ’Yes’ for the sources of risk of bias
1
A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are coin toss (for studies with 2 groups), rolling
a dice (for studies with 2 or more groups), drawing of balls of different colours, drawing of ballots with the study group labels
from a dark bag, computer-generated random sequence, preordered sealed envelopes, sequentially ordered vials, telephone call
to a central office, and preordered list of treatment assignments. Examples of inadequate methods are: alternation, birth date,
social insurance/security number, date in which they are invited to participate in the study, and hospital registration number
2
Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has
no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision
about eligibility of the patient
3
Index and control groups are indistinguishable for the patients or if the success of blinding was tested among the patients and
it was successful
4
Index and control groups are indistinguishable for the care providers or if the success of blinding was tested among the care
providers and it was successful
5
Adequacy of blinding should be assessed for each primary outcome separately. This item should be scored ’yes’ if the success of
blinding was tested among the outcome assessors and it was successful or:
• for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient is the outcome assessor (e.g., pain, disability): the blinding procedure
is adequate for outcome assessors if participant blinding is scored ’yes’;
• for outcome criteria assessed during scheduled visit and that supposes a contact between participants and outcome
assessors (e.g. clinical examination): the blinding procedure is adequate if patients are blinded, and the treatment or adverse
effects of the treatment cannot be noticed during clinical examination;
• for outcome criteria that do not suppose a contact with participants (e.g. radiography, magnetic resonance imaging): the
blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed when assessing the main
outcome;
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and
care providers (e.g. cointerventions, hospitalization length, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome
assessor: the blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if item ’4’ (caregivers) is scored ’yes’;
• for outcome criteria that are assessed from data of the medical forms: the blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment
or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed on the extracted data.

 Table 2. Criteria for a judgement of ’Yes’ for the sources of risk of bias
(Continued)
6
The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in
the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-
term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias a ’yes’ is scored. (note: these percentages
are arbitrary, not supported by literature.)
7
All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group they were allocated to by randomization for the most important
moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and cointerventions
8
All the results from all prespecified outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial. This information
is either obtained by comparing the protocol and the report, or in the absence of the protocol, assessing that the published
report includes enough information to make this judgement
9
Groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients
with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s)
10
If there were no cointerventions or they were similar between the index and control groups
11
The reviewer determines if the compliance with the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration,
number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s). For example, physiotherapy
treatment is usually administered for several sessions; therefore it is necessary to assess how many sessions each patient attended.
For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant
12
Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all primary outcome measures
13
Other types of biases. For example:
• when the outcome measures were not valid. There should be evidence from a previous or present scientific study that the
primary outcome can be considered valid in the context of the present;
• industry-sponsored trials. The conflict of interest (COI) statement should explicitly state that the researchers have had
full possession of the trial process from planning to reporting without funders with potential COI having any possibility to
interfere in the process. If, for example, the statistical analyses have been done by a funder with a potential COI, usually
’unsure’ is scored.

Appendix 3. The GRADE approach to evidence synthesis
We categorized the certainty of evidence as follows.
• High (⊕⊕⊕⊕): further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect.
• Moderate (⊕⊕⊕�): further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect.
• Low (⊕⊕��): further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is
likely to change the estimate.
• Very low (⊕���): any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
We graded the evidence available to answer each subquestion on the domains following criteria based on Ryan 2016.
1. Risk of bias
Confidence in the estimate of the effect decreases if studies have major limitations in design and conduct. We assessed five types of bias,
described in detail in Table 1 and Table 2:
• selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, group similarities at baseline);
• performance bias (blinding of participants, blinding of personnel or care providers, cointerventions, compliance);
• attrition bias (incomplete outcome data, intention-to-treat analysis);
• detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors, timing of outcome assessments);
• reporting bias (selective reporting).
The certainty of evidence was downgraded one level for an estimate of effect that relied on studies with a high risk of bias in one of
these domains. The certainty of evidence was downgraded by two levels for an estimate of effect that relied heavily (i.e. approximately
50% or greater weight in the meta-analysis) on studies with a high risk of bias in two or more of these domains.
2. Inconsistency
Inconsistency refers to heterogeneity between studies that does not have a plausible explanation. The I2 statistic is an estimate of the
percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to clinical or methodological heterogeneity rather than chance. An I2 statistic
of 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% may
136
Yoga treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 represent considerable heterogeneity (Deeks 2011). The design and conduct of yoga interventions for low-back pain are highly variable
and, therefore, heterogeneity is expected.
The certainty of evidence was downgraded by one level when heterogeneity was substantial (i.e. when I2 ≥ 50%), and by two levels
when heterogeneity was considerable (i.e. when I2 ≥ 75%), unless there was a plausible explanation for the heterogeneity.
3. Indirectness
Indirectness refers to a mismatch between the population, intervention, comparator, or outcomes for the studies included in the review
and the population, intervention, comparator, or outcomes for the research question being posed by the systematic review. The certainty
of evidence was downgraded by one level when there was indirectness for one element of the research question (e.g. population) and
by two levels when there was indirectness for two or more elements of the research question.
4. Imprecision
Imprecision refers to uncertainty in the results due to few participants or to wide confidence intervals.
We used the following guidance in judging imprecision.
For continuous outcomes
An outcome was downgraded one level for imprecision if:
• the total number of participants was fewer than 400; or
• the 95% confidence interval around the estimate of effect covered both no effect and a minimally important difference for that
outcome, or if a minimally important difference was not prespecified, no effect and a standardized mean difference (SMD) of ± 0.5.
An outcome was downgraded two levels for imprecision if both points above were true.
For dichotomous outcomes
An outcome was downgraded one level for imprecision if:
• the total number of events was less than 300; or
• the 95% confidence interval around the estimate of effect included both no effect and either appreciable benefit or appreciable
harm. The threshold for ’appreciable benefit’ or ’appreciable harm’ was a relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk increase (RRI)
greater than 25%.
An outcome was downgraded two levels for imprecision if both points above were true.
5. Publication bias
Publication bias refers to the selective publication of studies, which may bias the estimate of effect that is based on available studies.
The certainty of evidence was downgraded by one level if a funnel plot to assess the potential for small-study bias suggests that
publication bias was present, or there was any other reason to strongly suspect that publication bias was present.

We planned to examine outcomes at short-term (closest to four weeks), intermediate-term (closest to six months), and long-term (closest
to one year) time points. Several studies measured outcomes at six weeks and six months but also at three months. Therefore, we added
a short-to-intermediate term (closest to three months) time point to capture the changes over time in the effects of the intervention.
We listed yoga versus no treatment or waiting list, yoga versus minimal intervention (e.g. booklets), and yoga versus usual care as
separate comparisons in the protocol. We also listed yoga plus an intervention versus the intervention alone as a comparison for which
we would consider control conditions separately. However, in our analyses, we grouped together the studies in which yoga was compared
to no treatment or a waiting list, a minimal intervention, or usual care, because we believe that the control conditions were clinically
comparable. We also included in this grouping studies in which yoga plus education (such as a book or lectures) was compared to
education alone.
We clarified the definition of chronic low back pain under the ’Types of participants’ section.
We planned to have two authors use a standardized and pilot-tested form to independently extract data on study design, setting and
sponsorship, study participants, components of yoga and comparison interventions, and outcomes. We only had one author available
to extract data on study design, setting, study participants, components of yoga and comparison interventions, but a second author
checked all extracted data. We had two authors extract data on outcomes (as planned) and sponsorship (as planned, as part of the risk
of bias assessment).
We did not assess the inter-rater reliability of the ’Risk of bias’ assessment.
We initially planned to summarize outcome data using the mean difference (MD) when the studies used the same scale, and the
standardized mean difference (SMD) when studies used different scales for the same underlying concept. Most comparisons used
different scales and we used the SMD for those comparisons, then for consistency across time points and comparability with other
meta-analyses of yoga for low back pain we chose to use the SMD for all meta-analyses.
Instead of using the MD (when the same scale was used in individual studies) or the SMD (when different scales were used across
studies) for pain outcomes, we followed the suggestion of a peer reviewer to transform all pain outcomes to a 0 to 100 scale and use
the MD. The peer reviewer also suggested that we use a measure of clinically significant difference in pain that is measured on a 0- to
100-point scale, and we identified and used such a measure to report whether changes were clinically significant. Due to this change
from the protocol, we also added sensitivity analyses comparing the MD and SMD results for pain outcomes, and observed that they
were broadly consistent.
We did not specify in the protocol that we would use absolute risk difference (RD) to report adverse events.
We did not prespecify whether we preferred to use endpoint or change data in our data extraction and analyses. Most studies presented
only endpoint data, one presented only change data, and three contained both endpoint and change data (or both types of data were
138

 made available by the study authors). For our main analyses, we used endpoint data for the SMD, and we carried out separate sensitivity
analyses with change data when change data were available.
We did not prespecify whether we preferred to use adjusted or unadjusted outcome data in our data extraction and analyses. When
both adjusted and unadjusted outcome data were available, we used adjusted data.
We did not report an assessment of clinical relevance of individual studies, neither did we incorporate this assessment in the clinical
implications of the review, as the Cochrane Back and Neck group no longer recommends this assessment (Furlan 2015a).
