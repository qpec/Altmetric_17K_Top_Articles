The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic
assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable
epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We
generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify
16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG
methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we identified regulatory
elements with differential methylation across neuron types. Methylation signatures
identified a layer 6 excitatory neuron subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing
inhibitory neuron subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of
regulatory elements in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons. Single-nucleus
methylomes expand the atlas of brain cell types and identify regulatory elements that
drive conserved brain cell diversity.
M
ammalian neuron types are identified
by their structure, electrophysiology, and
connectivity (1). The difficulty of scaling
traditional cellular and molecular assays
to whole neuronal populations has pre-
vented comprehensive analysis of brain cell types.
Sequencing mRNA transcripts from single cells or
nuclei has identified cell types with unique tran-
scriptional profiles in the mouse brain (2, 3) and
human brain (4). However, these methods are re-
stricted to RNA signatures, which are influenced
by the environment. Epigenomic marks, such as
DNA methylation (mC), are cell type–specific and
developmentally regulated, yet stable across indi-
viduals and over the life span (5–7). We theorized
that epigenomic profiles using single-cell DNA
methylomes could enable the identification of neu-
ron subtypes in the mammalian brain.
During postnatal synaptogenesis, neurons ac-
cumulate substantial DNA methylation at non-CG
sites (mCH) and reconfigure patterns of CG meth-
ylation (mCG) (7). Patterns of mCG and mCH at
gene bodies, promoters, and enhancers are spe-
cific to neuronal types (5–8). Gene body mCH is
more predictive of gene expression than mCG or
chromatin accessibility (5). Because mCH is modu-
lated over large domains, single-neuron methylomes
with sparse coverage can be used to accurately es-
timate mCH levels for more than 90% of the ge-
nome by using coarse-grained bins (100 kb) (fig.
S1). Whereas single-cell RNA sequencing mainly
yields information about highly expressed tran-
scripts, single-neuron methylome sequencing assays
any gene or nongene region long enough to have
sufficient coverage.
We developed a protocol for single-nucleus
methylcytosine sequencing (snmC-seq) and applied
it to neurons from young adult mouse (age 8 weeks)
and human (age 25 years) frontal cortex (FC) (Fig.
1A) (9). snmC-seq provides a high rate of read
mapping relative to published protocols (10–12)
and allows multiplex reactions for large-scale cell
type classification (fig. S2) (9). Like other bisulfite
sequencing techniques (13), snmC-seq measures the
sum of 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethylcytosines.
Single neuronal nuclei labeled with antibody to
NeuN were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) from human FC and from dis-
sected superficial, middle, and deep layers of mouse
FC. We generated methylomes from 3377 mouse
neurons with an average of 1.4 million stringently
filtered reads, covering 4.7% of the mouse genome
per cell (Fig. 1, B and C, and table S1). We also

 generated methylomes from 2784 human neurons
with an average of 1.8 million stringently filtered
reads, covering5.7% of the humangenome per cell
(Fig. 1, B and C, and table S2).
We calculated the mCH level for each neuron
in nonoverlapping 100-kb bins across the genome,
followed by dimensionality reduction and visual-
ization using t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding [t-SNE (14)]. The two-dimensional
tSNE representation was largely invariant over a
wide range of experimental and analysis parameters
(fig. S3). A substantially similar tSNE representa-
tion was obtained using CG methylation levels in
100-kb bins, which suggests that snmC-seq could
be effective for cell type classification of nonbrain
tissues without high levels of mCH (fig. S3F).
The mammalian cortex arises from a conserved
developmental program that adds excitatory neu-
ron classes in an inside-out fashion, progress-
ing from deep layers (L5, L6) to middle (L4) and
superficial layers (L2/3) (1). Inhibitory interneurons
arise from distinct progenitors in the ganglionic
eminences and migrate transversely to their cor-
tical locations (15). We used mCH patterns to
identify a conservative and unbiased clustering
of nuclei for each species (9). Cluster robustness
was validated by shuffling, downsampling, and
comparison to density-based clustering (figs. S3
and S4) (9, 16). In addition, clustering was not sig-
nificantly associated with experimental factors (e.g.,
batches; false discovery rate > 0.1, c2 test; fig. S5).
We applied identical clustering parameters to
mouse and human cortical neuron mCH data and
identified 16 mouse and 21 human neuron clusters
(Fig. 2, A to D). Assuming an inverse relationship
between gene body mCH (average mCH across
the annotated genic region) and gene expression
(7), we annotated each cluster on the basis of de-
pletion of mCH at known cortical glutamatergic
or GABAergic neuron markers (e.g., Satb2, Gad1,
Slc6a1), cortical layer markers (e.g., Cux2, Rorb,
Deptor, Tle4), or inhibitory neuron subtype mark-
ers (e.g., Pvalb, Lhx6, Adarb2) (1, 15, 17) (Fig. 2,
E and F, and figs. S6 and S7). For most clusters,
mCH depletion at multiple marker genes (figs. S6
and S7) allowed us to assign cluster labels indi-
cating the putative cell type. For example, we found
a cluster of mouse neurons with ultralow mCH
at Rorb (Fig. 2E and fig. S6), a known marker of
L4 and L5a excitatory pyramidal cells (17). Com-
bining this information with markers such as
Deptor (fig. S6), which marks L5 but not L4 neu-
rons, we labeled the cluster by species and layer (e.g.,
mL4 for mouse L4). Similarly, we used classical
markers for inhibitory neurons such as Pvalb to
label corresponding clusters (e.g., mPv for puta-
tive mouse Pvalb+ fast-spiking interneurons) (15).
We confirmed the accuracy of these classifications
by comparison to layer-dissected cortical neu-
rons (fig. S8, A and B) and coclustering with

 high-coverage methylC-seq data from purified
populations of PV+ and VIP+ (5), as well as SST+
inhibitory neurons (fig. S8C). Aggregated single-
neuron methylomes showed consistent mCH and
mCG profiles relative to bulk methylomes of match-
ing cell populations (fig. S8, D and E, and fig. S15F).
Neuronal cluster classification for each of the major
cell subtypes in mouse and human cortex based on
single-nuclei methylomes (Fig. 2G and fig. S9, A
and B) was in good agreement with annotations
based on single-cell RNA sequencing (2–4). Gene

ing our mCH marker gene–based annotation.
We found a greater diversity of excitatory neu-
rons in deep layers than in superficial layers for
both mouse and human (Fig. 2). In both species,
we identified one neuronal cluster for cortical
L2/3 (mL2/3, hL2/3) and L4 (mL4, hL4), whereas
L5 and L6 contained seven clusters in mouse (mL5,
mL6, and mDL, where DL denotes deep-layer neu-
rons) and 10 clusters in human (hL5, hL6, and
hDL). Mouse L5 excitatory clusters (mL5-1, mL5-2)
were hypomethylated at Deptor and Bcl6, which
mark cortical L5a and L5b, respectively (fig. S6)
(18). L6 excitatory clusters included subtypes with
low mCH at the L6 excitatory neuron marker Tle4
[mL6-1, mL6-2; hL6-1, hL6-2, hL6-3 (1)]. Interest-
ingly, several deep-layer neuron clusters (mDL-2,
hDL-1, hDL-2, hDL-3) were not hypomethylated
at Tle4. We identified marker genes for each
neuron type on the basis of cell type–specific mCH
depletion (table S3) (9). Although many marker
genes were either classically established (1, 17) or
recently identified neuron type markers (fig. S10,
A and B) (2–4), we identified a number of markers
with no prior association to neuronal cell types
(fig. S10, D and E, and table S3). mCH signature
genes were hypomethylated in homologous clusters
in mouse and human, with a few notable excep-
tions. For example, the mouse L5a marker Deptor
showed no specificity for human L5 neurons (figs.
S6, S7, and S10, A and B).
Most clusters were associated with classical cell
type markers, butthe identity of some clusterssuch
as mDL-2 was less clear. We found that mDL-2
shares 24 marker genes with mL6-2, whereas
93 marker genes distinguish these clusters (table
S3). To validate the distinction between the two
cell types, we selected a shared marker (Sulf1)
and one unique to mL6-2 (Tle4) and performed
double in situ RNA hybridization experiments
in mouse FC (fig. S11). The result confirmed the
mCH-based prediction of a substantial proportion
of L6 neurons expressing Sulf1 but not Tle4; these
neurons likely correspond to mDL-2 (fig. S11, A to
D). The proportion of L6 neurons expressing both
Sulf1 and Tle4 likely represents a subset of mL6-2
(fig. S11, A to D). Tle4-expressing neurons in so-
matosensory cortex projectto the thalamus, where-
as Sulf1 is expressed by both corticothalamic and
corticocortical projecting neurons (18); hence, the
projection targets of neurons in cluster mDL-2
may be different from those of neurons in clusters
showing hypomethylation of Tle4 (e.g., mL6-2).
We also observed extensive overlap of in situ hy-
bridization signals when we used probes for a clas-
sical inhibitory neuron marker gene, Pvalb, and
Adgra3, a predicted mCH signature of PV inhibi-
tory neurons (fig. S11, E to G), further validating
the specificity of marker prediction using mCH.
We paired homologous mouse and human neu-
ron clusters by correlating mCH levels at homol-
ogous genes andfound expanded neuronaldiversity
in human FC relative to mouse FC (Fig. 2H and
fig. S12A) (19). Multiple human neuron clusters
showed homology to mouse L5a excitatory neu-
rons (mL5-1), L6a pyramidal neurons (mL6-2), or
VIP, PV, and SST inhibitory neurons (Fig. 2H).
We found a unique gene-specific mCH pattern
and superenhancer-like mCG signatures in a po-
tential human-specific inhibitory population (hPv-2;
figs. S12B and S16J) (9).
Although we detected substantial mCH in all
human and mouse neurons, cell types varied over
a wide range in terms of their genome-wide mCH
level (1.3 to 3.4% in mouse, 2.8 to 6.6% in human)
(fig. S13, A to F). The sequence context of mCH
was similar across all neuron types and consistent
with previous reports (fig. S13, I and J) (5, 7). In-
terestingly, global and gene-specific mCH differ-
ences were foundinPV andSSTinhibitoryneurons
located in different cortical layers (fig. S14) (9).
Genes with low mCH in superficial-layer PV+ neu-
rons are enriched in functional annotations includ-
ing neurogenesis, axon guidance functions, and
synaptic component (fig. S14, F to H) (9), suggesting
layer-specific epigenetic regulation of synaptic
functions in inhibitory neurons.

 A key advantage of single-cell methylome analy-
sis is the ability to obtain regulatory information
from the vast majority of the genome [>97% (19)]
not directly assessed by RNA sequencing. By pool-
ing reads from all neurons in each cluster, we
could find statistically significant differentially
methylated regions with low mCG in specific
neuronal populations (CG-DMRs), which are reli-
able markers for regulatory elements (5). We found
575,524 mouse (498,432 human) CG-DMRs with
average size of 263.6 bp (282.8 bp), covering 5.8%
(5.0%) of the genome (Fig. 3A, fig. S15A, and tables
S5 and S6). Most CG-DMRs (73.2% in mouse, 68.6%
in human) are located >10 kb from the nearest
annotated transcription start site (fig. S15, B to
E). mPv and mVip CG-DMRsshowedthestrongest
overlap with ATAC-seq peaks and putative enhanc-
ers identified from purified PV+ and VIP+ popu-
lations, respectively (fig. S15, G and H) (9, 20).
Hierarchical clustering of mCG levels at CG-DMRs
grouped neuron types by cortical layer and inhibi-
toryneuronsubtypes(fig.S15,IandJ).Thus,neuron
type classification is supported by the epigenomic
state of regulatory sequences.
We inferred transcription factors (TFs) that play
roles in neuron type specification by identifying
enriched TF-binding DNA sequence motifs in CG-
DMRs (Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S15K). We identified
known transcriptional regulators and observed that
several TF-binding motifs were enriched in human
but depleted in mouse CG-DMRs in homologous
clusters (Fig. 3C). The binding motif of NUCLEAR
FACTOR 1 (NF1) was enriched in CG-DMRs for two
human inhibitory neuron subtypes (hVip-2, hNdnf)
but was depleted in homologous mouse clusters
(mVip, mNdnf-2), suggesting a specific involve-
ment of NF1 in human inhibitory neuron speci-
fication. Thus, although the TF regulatory circuits
governing tissue types are conserved between
mouse and human (21), fine-grained distinctions
between neuronal cell types may be shaped by
species-specific TF activity.
Superenhancers are clusters of regulatory ele-
ments, marked by large domains of mediator bind-
ing and/or the enhancer histone mark H3K27ac,
that control genes with cell type–specific roles (22).
Extended regions of depleted mCG (large CG-
DMRs) are also reliable markers of superenhancers
(fig. S16, A to C) (9, 23). Therefore, we used our
neuron type–specific methylomes to predict super-
enhancers for each mouse and human neuron type
(fig. S16, D to I, and tables S7 and S8). For example,
superenhancer activity was indicated by a large
CG-DMRs at Bcl11b (Ctip2) in a subset of deep-layer
neurons (fig. S16, F and G) and broad H3K27ac
enrichment in mouse excitatory neurons (fig.
S16F). Superenhancersoverlapwith key regulatory
genes in the associated cell type, such as Prox1
in VIP+ and NDNF+ neurons (fig. S16, H and I).
Global mCH and mCG levels were correlated
between homologous clusters across mouse and
human (Pearson r = 0.698 for mCH, r = 0.803 for
mCG; P < 0.005), suggesting evolutionary conser-
vation of cell type–specific regulation of mC (Fig.
4A and fig. S13, G and H). Examining 12,157
orthologous gene pairs, we found stronger correla-
tion of gene body mCH between homologous clus-
ters in mouse and human (median Spearman r =
0.236; Fig. 4, B and C) than between different
cell types within the same species (r = –0.050,
mouse; r = –0.068, human). For homologous
clusters, we found shared and species-specific
CG-DMRs based on sequence conservation (lift-
over; fig. S17, A and B). Cross-species correlation
of mCG at CG-DMRs was significantly greater
for inhibitory than for excitatory neurons (P <
0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 4D and fig.
S17C) (9). Greater sequence conservation at in-
hibitory neuron CG-DMRs could partly explain
the greater regulatory conservation (P < 0.001,
Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 4E). Sequence con-
servation was observed only within 1 kb of the
center of inhibitory neuron CG-DMRs and did not
extend to the flanking regions (fig. S17G). These
results support conservation of neuron type–
specific DNA methylation, with greater conser-
vation of inhibitory than of excitatory neuron
regulatory elements.
Single-cell methylomes contain rich information
enabling high-throughput neuron type classifi-
cation, marker gene prediction, and identifica-
tion of regulatory elements. Applying a uniform
experimental and computational pipeline to mouse
and human allowed unbiased comparison of neu-
ronal epigenomic diversity in the two species. The
expanded neuronal diversity in human, revealed
by DNA methylation patterns, is consistent with
more complex human neurogenesis, such as the
presence of outer radial glia and the potential
