ABSTRACT
Background. To improve the management of advanced cancer
patients with delirium in an emergency department (ED) set-
ting, we compared outcomes between patients with delirium
positively diagnosed by both the Confusion Assessment
Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale
(MDAS), or group A (n5 22); by the MDAS only, or group B
(n5 22); and by neither CAM nor MDAS, or group C (n5 199).
Materials and Methods. In an oncologic ED, we assessed 243
randomly selected advanced cancer patients for delirium using the
CAM and the MDAS and for presence of advance directives. Out-
comes extracted from patients’ medical records included hospital
and intensive care unit admission rate and overall survival (OS).
Results. Hospitalization rates were 82%, 77%, and 49% for
groups A, B, and C, respectively (p 5 .0013). Intensive care unit
rates were 18%, 14%, and 2% for groups A, B, and C,
respectively (p5 .0004). Percentages with advance directives
were 52%, 27%, and 43% for groups A, B, and C, respectively
(p5 .2247). Median OS was 1.23 months (95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.46–3.55) for group A, 4.70 months (95% CI
0.89–7.85) for group B, and 10.45 months (95% CI 7.46–14.82)
for group C. Overall survival did not differ significantly between
groups A and B (p5 .6392), but OS in group C exceeded those
of the other groups (p< .0001 each).
Conclusion. Delirium assessed by either CAM or MDAS was
associated with worse survival and more hospitalization in
patients with advanced cancer in an oncologic ED. Many
advanced cancer patients with delirium in ED lack advance
directives. Delirium should be assessed regularly and should
trigger discussion of goals of care and advance directives. The

Implications for Practice: Delirium is a devastating condition among advanced cancer patients. Early diagnosis in the emergency
department (ED) should improve management of this life-threatening condition. However, delirium is frequently missed by ED
clinicians, and the outcome of patients with delirium is unknown. This study finds that delirium assessed by the Confusion
Assessment Method or the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale is associated with poor survival and more hospitalization among
advanced cancer patients visiting the ED of a major cancer center, many of whom lack advance directives.Therefore, delirium in ED
patients with cancer should trigger discussion about advance directives.
INTRODUCTION
Delirium in patients with cancer is associated with an increased
risk of mortality and morbidity, functional decline, falls, and
increased risk of institutionalization after discharge from the
hospital [1–3]. Most studies of delirium in cancer patients are
limited to patients in palliative care services [4–6] and intensive
care units (ICUs) [7]. In ICUs, delirium is associated with increased
mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital
stays, and cognitive impairment in patients discharged alive
[7]. In cancer patients receiving palliative care, delirium is
associated with shorter survival and high distress in patients,
families, and clinicians [2], and refractory agitated delirium is a
major reason for palliative sedation [8, 9]. Therefore, delirium
screening is an important component of tools developed to
estimate survival in patients receiving palliative care, such as

 the Palliative Prognostic Index and the Palliative Prognostic
Score [10–12].The addition of delirium to the latter tool signif-
icantly improved its accuracy [12].
A diagnosis ofdelirium in a hospitalized patient with advanced
cancer is an important reason to discuss goals of care, advance
care planning, and resuscitation preferences with the patient’s
surrogate to prevent unnecessary and costly interventions [13,
14]. These discussions should take place in the outpatient setting
and prior to the onset of delirium and an emergency department
(ED) visit [3, 14, 15]. Mack et al. [14] found that patients who
engage in such discussion are less likely to receive aggressive care
at the end of life. In a study about bereaved family members of
patients who died of advanced lung or colorectal cancer, most
family members perceived admission to hospice for more than
3 days, avoidance of ICU admission within 30 days of death, or
death outside the hospital as better end-of-life care [16].
In the ED setting [17, 18], a diagnosis of delirium in elderly
patients in ED was associated with an increased 6-month mor-
tality rate. Our group found that the presence of altered mental
status, although not delirium specifically, in an oncologic ED
was independently associated with increased ICU admission
and hospital mortality [19]. Previously, we determined the fre-
quency of delirium in advanced cancer patients visiting the ED
at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [20].
Our findings were of interest to many clinicians, including Vin-
cent et al. [21], who expressed the need to learn more about
events following the ED visit, as well as the navigation of the
complex decision-making process of ICU admission, prognosis,
and the role of advance directives [21]. In the present manu-
script, we address this need by reporting our outcome data
from the same cohort. To the best of our knowledge, the out-
comes of delirium in cancer patients in the ED setting are
unknown. We evaluated advance directive presence, overall
survival (OS), and hospitalization and ICU admission in patients
with delirium diagnosed by both the Confusion Assessment
Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale
(MDAS), or group A (n 5 22); those with delirium diagnosed by
the MDAS only, or group B (n5 22); and those without a delir-
ium diagnosis by either CAM or MDAS, or group C (n5 199).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
We performed a prospective cross-sectional observational
study of patients with advanced cancer who presented in the
ED of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Study enrollment occurred
from March 11, 2013 through July 21, 2014. Our primary aim
was to determine the frequency of delirium in these patients;
as reported previously, we found delirium in 9% (n5 22) using
CAM and in 18% (n5 44) using MDAS, the latter of which
included all the patients diagnosed by CAM [20]. Our secondary
aim was to compare hospital admission rate, ICU admission
rate, presence of advance directives, hospital mortality, and OS
between the patients with and without delirium.The study was
approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were described previously
[20]. Briefly, we included adults with advanced cancer who had
been in the ED for less than 12 hours, and who could provide
consent or had a legally authorized representative able to pro-
vide consent, and we excluded patients with unstable conditions
in need of emergent medical attention, patients with a history of
dementia, and patients with communication barriers. Of 1,832
patients screened for this study, 624 were eligible, and 243 were
enrolled. The main reasons for ineligibility were that the cancer
was not advanced, the patient was in the ED for >12 hours, the
presence of a language barrier, or that the patient was already
admitted to the hospital and waiting for bed.
As previously described [20], we used the CAM instrument,
a 4-item questionnaire that produces results expressed as a
dichotomous variable, to diagnose delirium, and we used the
MDAS instrument, a 10-item questionnaire, to measure delir-
ium severity. Although our palliative care team uses MDAS reg-
ularly to assess for delirium in both an outpatient and inpatient
setting, we did not use it primarily for the assessment of delir-
ium in our study because it is not validated in the ED setting.
However, because we found that all patients who were CAM-
positive were also MDAS-positive, and that an additional 22
patients were MDAS-positive but CAM-negative, we separately
assessed the outcomes of the patients diagnosed with delirium
by MDAS but not CAM. Therefore, we compared the outcome
of delirium between three groups: group A was patients with
delirium per both CAM and MDAS, group B was patients with
delirium per MDAS only, and group C was patients without
delirium per both instruments (Table 1).
The CAM has been validated in the ED, can differentiate
delirium from other cognitive conditions, and usually takes less
than 5 minutes to complete. The CAM has a sensitivity and
specificity of over 90% but has a false-positive rate of 10%. The
MDAS has been validated in hospitalized cancer patients and in
the palliative care setting but not in the ED. The scale has good
validity and inter-rater reliability. After a short training period,
one can administer the test easily and quickly [22].
Setting and Patient Selection
MD Anderson is a large comprehensive cancer center with
26,000 ED visits per year, and over 95% of patients seen in the
MD Anderson ED have cancer. In the ED, patients are seen first
in the triage area before they are assigned to a room.
Computer-generated random numbers were used to determine
which rooms the research assistant (RA) approached to recruit
participants and in what order.
Study Protocol
After rooms to be approached were randomly chosen, eligibil-
ity was determined and patients recruited as described previ-
ously [20]. After patients were enrolled, they were assessed for
delirium by the RA using CAM and MDAS. The RA then

performance status through a face-to-face interview with the
patient and legally authorized representative (if present). The
RA obtained demographic variables and clinical variables of tri-
age acuity from medical records. The RA also asked whether
the patient had advance directives, out-of-hospital Do-Not-
Resuscitate (DNR) orders, or prior enrollment in hospice. We
obtained rate of hospital admission related to the ED visit, rate
of ICU admission related to the ED visit, hospital mortality, and
median OS by reviewing the medical records of all patients
enrolled in the study.
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic regression to test the association between
delirium group and each of the two binary outcome variables:
ED-related hospitalizations and ED-related ICU admissions.
Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs)
are presented along with Nagelkerke’s r2 for assessing model
fit. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate OS, and we
used the log-rank test to compare survival between patients
grouped by delirium status and other variables. Survival was
calculated from the date of ED admission until death. Patients
who did not die during follow-up were censored at the date of
last known vital status. We conducted post hoc tests with �
Sid�
ak
correction for pairwise group comparisons. We also analyzed
the association of the presence of advance directives with hos-
pitalization and ICU admission using Fisher’s exact test. A multi-
variable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used
to investigate the effects of delirium group while controlling for
ECOG status. All p values less than .05 were considered statisti-
cally significant. All data analyses were conducted using SAS for
Windows (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, https://www.sas.
com/en_us/home.html).
RESULTS
Two hundred forty-three patients were enrolled, and all were
assessed for delirium using both CAM and MDAS except for
one participant, who was missing the MDAS assessment.
Twenty-two patients (9%) were diagnosed with delirium by
both CAM and MDAS (group A). No patients were both CAM-
positive and MDAS-negative. The MDAS alone diagnosed delir-
ium in 22 other patients (9%; group B). The patient missing the
MDAS assessment did not have delirium per CAM, and the
remaining 199 patients (group C) did not have delirium accord-
ing to both CAM and MDAS (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the presence of advance directives and out-
of-hospital DNR orders and whether the patient had been
enrolled in hospice before. There were no significant differen-
ces between delirium groups with respect to advance directives
or DNR orders. Although the delirium groups significantly dif-
fered in whether patients had been in hospice, only three
patients in all the groups had a history of hospice care.
Delirium diagnosis was significantly associated with admis-
sion to the hospital and admission to the ICU (Table 2). A total
of 133 patients were admitted to the hospital during the ED
visit (chi-square(2)5 11.888; p5 .0026), although the strength
of the association was relatively weak (Nagelkerke’s r25 .0762).
Based on a single-effect model, the odds of hospitalization for
group A were 4.6 times those for group C (OR 4.59, 95% CI
1.50–14.05; p5 .0076), and for group B patients, the odds of
hospitalization were 3.5 times those of group C (OR 3.47, 95%
CI 1.23–9.77; p5 .0185). Group C (the no-delirium group)
showed lower odds of hospitalization than did the other two
groups. In post hoc tests, a pairwise comparison of group A and
group B showed no statistically significant difference in the
odds of hospitalization (chi-square(1)5 0.1392; p5 .7091).
Overall, the predicted probability of hospitalization was
0.55 (95% CI 0.49–0.61). The predicted probability of hospitali-
zation was 0.82 (95% CI 0.60–0.93) for group A, 0.77 (95% CI
0.56–0.90) for group B (MDAS only), and 0.49 (95% CI 0.43–0.56)
for group C (no delirium).
Having advance directives was not associated with hospital-
ization. Of those hospitalized, 53.92% (n5 55/102) had
advance directives and 55.47% (n5 76/137) did not (Fisher’s
exact test p5 .90). Data were missing for four patients. Among
those hospitalized, 5.45% (n 5 3/55) of patients with advance
directives and 7.89% (n5 6/76) of patients without advance
directives were admitted to the ICU (Fisher’s exact test
p5 .73). Also, we did not detect a statistically significant

 association between DNR status and hospitalization (Fisher’s
exact test p5 .55), nor was there evidence of an association
between DNR status and ICU admission among those who
were hospitalized (Fisher’s exact test p5 .70).
In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, delirium
group remained a statistically significant predictor of OS (Wald
chi-square(2)5 10.93, p5 .0042) while controlling for baseline
ECOG status. The risk of death relative to the CAM-negative/
MDAS-negative group was higher for the CAM-positive/MDAS-
positive group (hazard ratio [HR]5 2.45; 95% CI 1.40–4.29;
p5 .0018) and for the CAM-negative/MDAS-positive group
(HR5 1.67; 95% CI 0.93–2.98; p5 .0856).The ECOG status was
statistically significant in the model (Wald chi-square(4)5 14.80,
p5 .0051).
Ten patients in the study population were admitted to the
ICU during the ED visit. Delirium (groups A and B) was signifi-
cantly associated with ICU admission (chi-square(2) 5 12.639;
p5 .0018), although the strength of the association was rela-
tively weak (Nagelkerke’s r2 at .1907). Based on the single-
effect model, the odds of ICU admission for group A were
greater than those of group C (no delirium; OR 14.45, 95% CI
3.00–69.63; p5 .0009). Group B also had greater odds of ICU
admission than did group C (OR 10.26, 95% CI 1.94–54.42;
p5 .0062). The point estimates are imprecise, as reflected by
the wide confidence intervals. Patients without delirium (group
C) showed lower odds of ICU admission than did the other two
groups. In post hoc tests, a pairwise comparison of group A and
group B showed no statistically significant difference in odds of
ICU admission (chi-square(1)5 0.1689; p5 .6811).
Among the 242 patients who were assessed by both CAM
and MDAS, 124 died during follow-up. For the 118 participants
who were alive at the end of follow-up, the median follow-up
from study triage was 9.13 months (range 0.07–18.7 months).
For the entire study cohort, the median OS from study triage
was 8.21 months (95% CI 5.82–10.87 months; Table 3). Overall
survival significantly differed between the three delirium
groups (log-rank chi-square(2)5 28.71; p< .0001; Fig. 1). The
�
Sid�
ak multiple-comparison results indicated no statistically sig-
nificant difference in OS between group A and group B
(p5 .6392), but the OS of group C was significantly longer than
that of each of the other two groups (p< .0001 for each).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study of patients with advanced cancer who
presented to the ED at MD Anderson and were assessed for
delirium using two different tools (CAM and MDAS), we found
that patients with delirium had higher rates of hospitalization
and ICU admission and worse OS, indicating that delirium in
this setting is associated with worse outcomes.Therefore, delir-
ium should be regularly assessed in advanced cancer patients
in the ED setting so that this life-threatening condition can be
diagnosed and managed early.
Patients who were CAM-negative but MDAS-positive had
similar outcomes to those of patients who were CAM- and
MDAS-positive, suggesting a higher sensitivity of MDAS in
assessing for delirium in the ED. However, MDAS is not vali-
dated in the ED setting, and it is significantly longer than the
CAM. Further research is needed to compare the two tools in
the ED setting, probably in addition to evaluation of all patients
with suspected delirium by a psychiatrist, as suggested by Law-
lor [24]. A short sensitive tool is needed to detect delirium in
the ED.
Most of the patients diagnosed with delirium per MDAS or
CAM were admitted to the hospital, and some of the CAM- and
MDAS-positive patients were admitted to the ICU; these hospi-
tal and ICU admission rates were significantly greater than
those of patients without delirium according to both tools. In
all cases, delirium should be promptly managed, safety should
be maintained at all times, and the culprit causes should be
identified and corrected if possible. Medications in particular
are associated with more delirium reversal [25], and symptom
management, including opioid switching, is associated with
resolution of delirium [26].
Overall, more than half of the patients did not have
advance directives or out-of-hospital DNR orders, and there
was no difference in these factors between patients with and
without delirium (Table 1). Given the lack of advance directives
and DNR orders, along with the poor survival of patients with
delirium in the ED, it might be prudent to start discussing goals

 of care and DNR orders with the legally authorized representa-
tives of patients with delirium in the ED if these directives have
not been established previously. End-of-life discussions are bet-
ter done by oncologists in the outpatient setting than in the
ED; however, these discussions are usually initiated in the last
33 days of life, in the inpatient hospital setting, and by pro-
viders other than oncologists [27]. Mack et al. [14] found that
early discussion of goals of care is associated with less aggres-
sive care, including fewer ICU and hospital deaths and more
hospice admissions [14]; notably, only a few patients in the
present study had been in hospice previously. Wright et al. [16]
found an association of aggressive end-of-life care with poor
quality of life in advanced cancer patients and with complicated
bereavement in their caregivers. Because of the relatively high
prevalence of delirium among advanced cancer patients in the
ED [20], and the high mortality we observed in this study, uni-
versal screening for delirium is justified.
We did not find statistically significant differences between
patients who had advance directives or out of hospital DNR
and those who did not regarding the rate of hospitalization or
ICU admission. However, whether these documents (advance
directives and DNR) were reviewed by ED physicians and played
a role in the decision-making process of hospitalization is not
clear. Although ED physicians value these documents, they
have difficulty finding and using them [28]. Moreover, the total
number of patients admitted to the ICU was small, limiting fur-
ther analysis. More research is needed to determine the impact
of advance directives and DNR discussion in the ED on the rate
and length of hospitalization, ICU admission, and hospice
referral.
In a survey about barriers to end-of-life discussion by You
et al. [29], respondents identified among the main barriers a
lack of understanding of the limitations of life-sustaining meas-
ures, difficulty in accepting a poor prognosis, and disagreement
between family members. Because patients with delirium are
unable to engage in meaningful discussion about goals of care
and DNR orders, such interaction is carried out with their surro-
gates and can be time-consuming. Having an interdisciplinary
team trained in communication and in addressing these issues
will significantly improve the care provided to these patients
and their family members. Further research should evaluate
the impact of such a team on the quality of end-of-life care.
We found that delirious patients had shorter survival than
patients without delirium. This survival could be even shorter
had we included unstable patients with life-threatening condi-
tions. These findings are similar to those in elderly patients
with and without delirium in the ED [30]. Interestingly, we
found that the median survival of advanced cancer patients
with delirium in the ED was only 1.2 months for patients who
were CAM-positive, and these survival outcomes are worse
than those of elderly patients with delirium but without cancer
in the ED, of whom only 6% died within 1 month in one study
[17] and 31%–37% died within 6 months in other studies [17,
30, 31]. Consequently, clinicians caring for advance cancer
patients with delirium in EDs should strongly consider focusing
on goals of care, resuscitation preferences, and quality of life
for patients and their family members.
Although poor performance status (ECOG 3 or 4) was found
in over 80% of patients with delirium in this cohort [20], further
analysis in this study using multivariable Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model revealed delirium to be an independent
predictor of OS, while controlling for ECOG performance status.
Moreover, the addition of delirium to the palliative prognostic
score
(which
includes
performance
status)
significantly
improved the accuracy of the score [12]. Further analysis of
data is needed to clarify the role of poor performance status,
delirium, and other symptoms such as dyspnea in predicting
mortality in ED patients with advanced cancer.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective
study to show the rate of hospitalization, advance care plan-
ning, and mortality among advanced cancer patients seeking
emergent medical care. Our study has some limitations. First, it
is a single-center study, and therefore, our findings need to be
confirmed in a multicenter study. Second, the total number of
patients was relatively small, in particular when comparing
groups A and B. A larger study is needed to confirm our find-
ings.Third, we did not adjust for comorbidities or severity of ill-
ness. Finally, we did not follow patients longitudinally to
evaluate whether further interventions were done during hos-
pitalization and whether patients were discharged to hospice
or to hospital follow-up.
CONCLUSION
Patients with delirium upon arrival to the ED have increased
hospitalization rates, increased ICU admission rates, and
shorter survival than those without delirium. In addition to
reversing the cause of delirium and control of symptoms, man-
agement of cancer patients with delirium in the ED should
include addressing goals of care and resuscitation preferences
with the patient’s legally authorized representative and the
