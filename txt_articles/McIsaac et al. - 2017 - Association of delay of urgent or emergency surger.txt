P
atients undergoing emergency surgery are at high risk of 
adverse outcomes.1 Although patient characteristics2,3 
and surgical indication4,5 are the most important risk 
factors, system factors, such as delayed access to the operat-
ing room, also affect outcomes. In hip fracture surgery, delay is 
associated with morbidity and mortality,6,7 but for other sur-
geries, the effect of delay on outcomes is unclear.8–13 Because it 
is very expensive to expand or reorganize operating room 
resources to improve access,14–16 understanding the relation 
between delay and outcomes for all types of emergency sur-
gery is needed.
The association between surgical delay and outcome may be 
obscured by confounding. The indication for surgery, comorbidi-
ties and physiologic disturbances may influence both the risk of 
delay and the risk of adverse outcomes. Furthermore, ascertain-
ment of delay is a challenge. Many studies measure surgical wait 
time as the time from admission to surgery, but this is mislead-
ing, because inpatient work-up is often required to determine 
the risks and potential benefits of surgery.
The purpose of this study was to determine the independent 
association of surgical delay with inpatient mortality, postopera-
tive length of stay and total costs of hospital care.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Delay of surgery for hip 
fracture is associated with increased risk 
of morbidity and mortality, but the effects 
of surgical delays on mortality and 
resource use in the context of other emer-
gency surgeries is poorly described. Our 
objective was to measure the indepen-
dent association between delay of emer-
gency surgery and in-hospital mortality, 
length of stay and costs.
METHODS: We identified all adult 
patients who underwent emergency 
noncardiac surgery between January 
2012 and October 2014 at a single ter-
tiary care centre. Delay of surgery was 
defined as the time from surgical book-
ing to operating room entry exceeding 
institutionally defined acceptable wait 
times, based on a standardized 5-level 
priority system that accounted for sur-
gery type and indication. Patients with 
delayed surgery were matched to those 
without delay using propensity scores 
derived from variables that accounted 
for details of admission and the hospital 
stay, patient characteristics, physiologic 
instability, and surgical urgency and risk.
RESULTS: Of 15 160 patients, 2820 
(18.6%) experienced a delay. The mor-
tality rates were 4.9% (138/2820) for 
those with delay and 3.2% (391/12 340) 
for those without delay (odds ratio [OR] 
1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–
1.93). Within the propensity-matched 
cohort, delay was significantly associ-
ated with mortality (OR 1.56, 95% CI 
1.18–2.06), increased length of stay 
(incident rate ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.01–
1.11) and higher total costs (incident 
rate ratio 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11).
INTERPRETATION: Delayed operating 
room access for emergency surgery was 
associated with increased risk of in-
hospital mortality, longer length of stay 
and higher costs. System issues appeared 
to underlie most delays and must be 
addressed to improve the outcomes of 
emergency surgery.

Methods
Design and setting
We performed a retrospective cohort study of emergency inpa-
tient surgery at The Ottawa Hospital, a 900-bed academic health 
sciences centre serving a population of 1.2 million people. With 
2 distinct campuses that perform emergency surgery, our institu-
tion is the regional cancer centre and the sole regional provider 
for trauma surgery, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery and vascular 
surgery. On weekdays, 5 or 6 of our 35 operating rooms are dedi-
cated to emergency surgery; 3 of these rooms are available until 
11 pm, and 2 are available between 11 pm to 7 am. All surgeons 
and anesthesiologists are paid on a fee-for-service basis. 
Using established methods,17 our hospital developed and 
adopted new wait time standards for emergency operating room 
access in January 2012 (described in detail in Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). 
All emergency cases were classified into 1 of 5 urgency catego-
ries (A , < 45 min; B, < 2 h; C, < 4 h; D, < 8 h; E, < 24 h), according to 
the surgical procedure and patient indication.18 The booking pro-
cess was also clarified: patients could not be booked unless they 
were appropriately prepared to come to the operating room at 
any time after booking. The urgency classification was applied by 
the surgeon and was documented in the Surgical Information 
Management System. If there was a change in patient status 
(such as acute deterioration), the urgency classification could be 
changed accordingly.
Data sources
All data used in this study were derived from the data warehouse of 
The Ottawa Hospital, which stores clinical and administrative data. 
We used the Can 
adian Institute for Health Information Discharge 
Abstract Database; the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System; 
the Surgical Information Management System, which records all 
details of surgical procedures performed in our hospital operating 
rooms; and the electronic health record database at The Ottawa 
Hospital. Data sources are described in Appendix 2 (available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1).
Study population
We identified all adults undergoing emergency noncardiac sur-
gery from January 2012 to October 2014. The study start date rep-
resents the implementation date of our 5-level prioritization sys-
tem, and October 2014 was the last date at which all data sets 
were complete. We included all patients who were scheduled for 
emergency surgery and who entered the operating room within 
3 multiples of the wait time for their assigned priority (represent-
ing the 95th percentile of wait times); we excluded patients who 
waited beyond this time frame because they may have been sub-
stantively different from those who waited less than 3 multiples of 
the accepted wait time (by virtue of their ability to survive this 
extended wait). All cases at The Ottawa Hospital are booked in 
the Surgical Information Management System as elective or 
emergent. Emergent cases are defined as those in which a patient 
is booked for surgery following evaluation and admission to hos-
pital; elective cases are planned before admission. For our analysis, 
we included only cases in which the patient’s clinical presentation 
necessitated operating room access within 24 hours. 
Exposure
The exposure was surgical delay, defined as a wait time from surgi-
cal booking to the patient entering the operating room in excess of 
the accepted wait time for the patient’s priority level. At the time 
of booking, each patient was assigned a priority level on the basis 
of our wait time standards (Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). For our pri-
mary analysis, the exposure was treated as binary (delayed v. non-
delayed). We classified each patient’s urgency status according to 
the status in effect at the time of entry into the operating room.
When the acceptable wait time was exceeded, the operating 
room manager could submit 1 of 8 prepopulated reasons into the 
Surgical Information Management System to capture the reason 
for delay.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, the accuracy of 
which has been validated.19 Length of stay was defined as the 
number of days from surgery to hospital discharge. Total hospi-
tal costs, calculated on a hospital-specific basis using standard-
ized methods, included both direct and indirect costs standard-
ized to 2014 Canadian dollars.20 This method accounts for an 
individual patient’s resource intensity weight and case-mix 
group, as well as fixed and indirect costs to the hospital based on 
the patient’s location of care and length of stay.
Covariables
We specified covariables a priori on the basis of their likely role 
as confounders, through a structured literature review guided by 
an information specialist, the surgical risk calculator of the 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (American Col-
lege of Surgeons)3 and existing systematic reviews.2 The full list 
of covariables and their representation in our models are avail-
able in Appendix 4 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). We used several risk indices: 
Procedural Index for Mortality Risk, an internally validated index 
that predicts the risk of in-hospital death according to surgical 
procedure;5 the Elixhauser Index,21 an internally validated score 
that assigns points to comorbidities to predict in-hospital mor-
tality;22 and the Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score, an 
externally validated score that predicts physiology-associated 
mortality risk on the basis of laboratory values.23
Missing data
No outcome or exposure data were missing. Not all laboratory 
tests were ordered for all patients; we used published methods 
to impute missing values for the laboratory tests used in the 
Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score.23
Statistical analysis
We compared patient characteristics between groups using stan-
dardized differences, with differences of less than 10% being 
thought to represent negligible correlations.24

The primary analysis consisted of unadjusted and propensity 
score–matched analyses to measure the association between sur-
gical delay and death. We used a nonparsimonious multivariable 
logistic regression model to estimate the propensity for delay for 
each patient. We included all variables postulated to act as con-
founders between delay and outcome (Appendix 4). We matched 
patients 1:1 without replacement based on a caliper (0.2 standard 
deviations of the propensity score logit) in a greedy matching 
algorithm (% gmatch).25 Match quality was assessed in terms of 
the covariable balance between exposure groups and the 
achievement of a high proportion of matched exposed patients.26 
We measured the association between delay and mortality using 
a χ2 test; the absolute risk difference and number needed to harm 
were also calculated. We tested an interaction between priority 
level and delay status to evaluate whether the effect of delay on 
mortality differed across priority levels.
For secondary analyses of length of stay and cost, we used the 
same matched cohort. Because the length of stay and cost distri-
butions were skewed, we used nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-
rank tests. We calculated relative associations using generalized 
linear models with log-link and gamma (cost) or negative bino-
mial (length of stay) distributed errors.
We conducted several prespecified sensitivity analyses. We 
used the propensity score to assign inverse probability of 
treatment weights. This allowed us to calculate the average 
treatment effect, as opposed to the average treatment effect 
for the treated patients from the matched analysis.27 We used 
prespecified inverse probability of treatment weight analyses 
based on subgroup-specific propensity scores to evaluate the 
robustness of our primary analysis with exclusion of hip frac-
tures and exclusion of individuals delayed for medical rea-
sons. We also performed a post hoc analysis restricted to 
patients with hip fracture.
Finally, we analyzed a continuous, but possibly nonlinear, 
relation between wait time and mortality, in contrast to the 
binary exposure used in our primary analysis. Wait times were 
standardized among priority levels by dividing the wait time in 
minutes by the accepted wait-time window. We used a general-
ized additive model, adjusting for procedural mortality risk (with 
the Procedural Index for Mortality Risk score) and patient comor-
bidity (with the Elixhauser Index) to analyze the continuous asso-
ciation between wait time and mortality. Splines with 3 degrees 
of freedom were used for each variable.
We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) for data manage-
ment and analysis.
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network 
Research Ethics Board.
Results
A total of 15 275 emergency surgery patients were identified (Fig-
ure 1). We excluded 115 patients because their wait times exceeded 
3 multiples of the accepted wait-time window. Of the 15 160 
included patients, 12 340 (81.4%) reached the operating room 
within an acceptable wait time, whereas 2820 (18.6%) did not 
(Table 1). The reasons for delay were documented in 1109 cases 
(39.3% of all delays; Table 2). Risk of mortality did not differ 
between patients with and without a documented reason for delay, 
and mean excess wait times are described in Appendix 5 (available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). In 
958 (86.4%) of the cases with a documented reason for delay, sys-
tem issues such as availability of human or physical resources were 
identified as the reason for delay. The most common surgical pro-
cedures for each priority level are shown in Table 3.

Crude mortality rate, length of stay and costs were higher in 
the group whose surgery was delayed (Table 4). We matched 
each of the 2820 delayed patients with a nondelayed patient 
using propensity scores, and achieved a balance of covariables 
(Table 1; Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). Within the matched cohort, 
the risk of in-hospital mortality, length of stay and costs were all 
significantly higher in the delayed group (Table 4). The number 
needed to harm for mortality was 60; the odds ratio (OR) was 
1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–2.06). An interaction 
term between priority level and delay status was not statistically 
significant (p = 0.4). 
Sensitivity analyses
Inverse probability of treatment weight groups were balanced 
across covariables (Appendix 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/DC1). In the full cohort, 
patients with delay were more likely to die (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08–
1.69). When hip fractures were excluded, patients with delay had 
a 28% increase in relative odds of mortality (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00–
1.65). When patient-specific delays were excluded, delay was 
associated with mortality (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14–2.00). Delay was 
also associated with mortality in the post hoc analysis of patients 
with hip fracture (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05–2.61). Appendix 8 (avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160576/-/
DC1) contains other post hoc analyses.
When we modelled the odds of mortality as a nonlinear 
continuous association with wait time, we found a signifi-
cant, biphasic association (p = 0.01). The shape of the spline 
suggested that as the wait increased up to 1.1 multiples of 
the accepted wait-time window, the odds of mortality 
increased; beyond 1.1 multiples of the accepted wait-time 
window, the odds of mortality decreased. At 0.4 multiples of 
the accepted wait-time window, the odds of death crossed 
the null value (odds = 1), suggesting that beyond this point, 
excess mortality was attributable to increasing wait time (up 
to the 1.1 multiples of the accepted wait-time window inflec-
tion point; Figure 2). 
Interpretation
Delay of operating room access for emergency surgery was inde-
pendently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mor-
tality, longer length of stay and higher total hospital costs. 
Importantly, system factors, such as the availability of clinicians 
and physical resources, appeared to be the main reasons for 
delay of emergency surgery. We used validated indices to adjust 
for physiologic disturbance, preoperative therapies and timing of 
the decision to operate; this approach allowed us to address the 
limitations of prior research, which was unable to account for 
many acute preoperative patient variables and relied upon the 
time from hospital admission to operating room entry,7 and to 
gain new insights into the implications of delay of surgery on use 
of health care resources.
Improving operating room access for patients needing 
emergency surgery will require careful consideration of the

perioperative health care system, in particular how to optimize 
utilization of currently available resources and how to balance 
the increased resources that may be needed to improve access 
with the expected benefit of improved outcomes. We found 
that many delays were due to physician unavailability. There-
fore, improving availability of personnel may improve access 
without increasing costs (at least from a hospital perspective). 
Furthermore, the increased resources required to have ade-
quate nursing personnel and physical resources should be par-
tially offset by decreased hospital costs independently attrib-
uted to surgical delay.
Considering the mechanisms underlying the delay–mortality 
relation, which in hip surgery may be attributable to hospital-
acquired complications, might also help to properly target 
resources.7 Unfortunately, our data do not contain validated mea-
sures of complications to support the generalizability of this mech-

anism. However, we did find a nonlinear association between wait 
time and mortality, which suggests opportunities to match patient 
need for rapid operating room access with scarce resources. The 
odds of dying increased for waits of up to 1.1 multiples of the 
accepted wait-time window, and decreased thereafter. This rela-
tion suggests that there may be 2 subgroups of patients. One 
group truly appears to need urgent surgical intervention; in these 
patients, longer waits may increase the risk of death. Decreasing 
mortality risk beyond 1.1 wait-time multiples may indicate a group 
experiencing survivorship bias, whose outcome is not as sensitive 
to longer wait times for surgery. Therefore, a more granular 
approach, considering both patient and procedural characteris-
tics, is needed to appropriately map wait-time standards to toler-
ance for waiting. Because the odds of death crossed the null value 
(odds = 1) at 0.4 wait-time multiples, the wait times established by 
our hospital may be too long. Prospective research that provides a 
clear understanding of the interaction between patient and proce-
dural risk is needed to inform stakeholders in the application of 
scarce health care resources aimed at improving emergency sur-
gery outcomes through more timely operating room access. Our 
findings that many emergency surgical cases are delayed, that 
delays are typically due to system issues and that delays are asso-
ciated with adverse outcomes are consistent with the existing lit-
erature. In the current study, about 20% of patients needing 
emergency surgery did not gain access to the operating room in a 
time frame compliant with our institutional guidelines, and 86.4% 
of delays were attributable to system factors, similar to the find-
ings of previous studies.28–30 In the United Kingdom, only 1% of 
emergency surgeries may be delayed because patient resuscita-
tion is needed, and the majority of cases with delay experience 
organizational problems.29 Among emergency laparotomies, 77% 
of delays were related to being bumped by higher-priority cases 
or unavailability of operating rooms.28 
Although our results support the known association between 
delay and mortality in patients with hip fracture,7 they also sup-
port the generalizability of the delay–outcome association to 
nonorthopedic surgery, where previous findings have both sup-
ported8,9 and refuted10,11 this association. There are about 100 000 
emergency general surgery operations,31 and 30 000 hip fracture 
operations annually in Canada.32 If 20% of these cases experience 
delays, we estimate that more than 410 deaths may be attribut-
able to surgical delay each year. A randomized trial of timing of 
hip fracture surgery is ongoing,33 but randomized data are also 
needed to evaluate the effect of timing of emergency surgery for 
other indications.
Limitations
A causal and generalizable relation between delay of surgery and 
death cannot be determined from a single-centre observational 
study; a randomized trial would be required. Despite our use of 
robust methods, confounding and unmeasured covariables are 
threats to the validity of our results. Our primary classification of 
delay was dichotomization of a continuous variable; our sensitiv-
ity analysis based on a generalized additive model was a second-
ary analysis, and must be interpreted as such. Our classification 
of delay was based on a prioritization system that has not been 
tested with regard to its effect on outcomes. The reported rea-
sons for noncompliance with timing of emergency surgery were 
missing for about 60% of patients. Finally, we cannot account for 
deaths that may have occurred outside our institution.
Conclusion
Delay in operating room access for emergency surgery is associ-
ated with increases in mortality risk, length of stay and costs. 
These findings are consistent with increasing evidence showing 
that delays in emergency surgery cause harm. Improving timely 
access to emergency surgery may require reallocation of scarce 
resources; however, such reallocation may be offset by savings 
derived from avoiding delays.
