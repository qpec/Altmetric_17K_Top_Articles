ABSTRACT
Objective: Few qualitative studies have explored women’s use of social egg freezing. Derived
from an interview study of 31 participants, this article explores the motivations of women using
this technology.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 users of social egg freezing resi-
dent in UK (n ¼ 23), USA (n ¼ 7) and Norway (n ¼ 1). Interviews were face to face (n ¼ 16),
through Skype and Facetime (n ¼ 9) or by telephone (n ¼ 6). Data were analyzed using interpret-
ive thematic analysis.
Results: Women’s use of egg freezing was shaped by fears of running out of time to form a
conventional family, difficulties in finding a partner and concerns about “panic partnering”,
together with a desire to avoid future regrets and blame. For some women, use of egg freezing
was influenced by recent fertility or health diagnoses as well as critical life events. A fifth of the
participants also disclosed an underlying fertility or health issue as affecting their decision.
Conclusion: The study provides new insights in to the complex motivations women have for
banking eggs. It identifies how women’s use of egg freezing was an attempt to “preserve fertil-
ity” in the absence of the particular set of “life conditions” they regarded as crucial for pursuing
parenthood. It also demonstrates that few women were motivated by a desire to enhance their
career and that the boundaries between egg freezing for medical and for social reasons may be
more porous than first anticipated.

Introduction
In
2016,
the
British
Human
Fertilisation
and
Embryology Authority (HFEA) reported for the first
time on the numbers of egg freezing cycles attempted
in UK clinics. While HFEA data cannot differentiate
between those undergoing egg freezing for medical or
social reasons, these data nevertheless show a 25–30%
increase year-on-year since 2013 in the number of
cycles of egg freezing performed, with the most not-
able increase following the development and use of
egg vitrification in the mid-2000s [1]. While the first
child born from a previously frozen egg was born in
1986 [2], the success rates of egg freezing have histor-
ically been much lower than its parent technology
(IVF). However, recent studies emerging from clinics
specializing in egg freezing have suggested that treat-
ment outcomes using autologous oocyte vitrification
and warming may be as good as cycles using fresh
oocytes [3]. Egg freezing has attracted considerable
media attention and, following the announcements by
Facebook and Apple to fund the procedure for their
female staff in 2014, the technology has taken center
stage in the social zeitgeist and public imagination.
Popular media reporting of women’s use of this tech-
nology suggests that women are freezing their eggs
to strategically delay motherhood to focus on develop-
ing their careers [4–6]. As a result, Sandor et al. (2017)
[7] have suggested that some fertility professionals
perceive women’s use of this technology to be due to
the egoistic choices women make in the pursuit of car-
eer advancement. However, contrary to such a repre-
sentation of women’s motives, a growing body of
research is now indicating how women’s use of this
technology is due to factors such as the lack of a suit-
able partner [8–12] and a fear of future regret [13,14].
Furthermore, factors such as the prohibitive cost of
the housing market, the desire to take pressure off
new relationships, and fears of entering in to “unwise”
relationships have also been identified as shaping
women’s use of social egg freezing [15,16].
However, while an increasing number of studies
have explored the phenomena of social egg freezing,
to date little empirical work has been undertaken
which examine in detail the accounts of women using
this technology. This article presents the findings of a

 qualitative exploratory study of social egg freezing
users drawn from the UK, USA and Norway. By draw-
ing on verbatim quotes from the research interviews,
this article explores in detail the factors and issues
which motivated these women to pursue egg freezing.
Materials and methods
The use of semi-structured interviews in reproduction
research is well-established, [17–21]. Interviews are
highly suitable for examining issues around planning
for motherhood, (in)fertility, and intimate relationships
which any discussion of the topic of egg freezing is
likely to raise. Interviews allow participants to give
detailed and often lengthy accounts of their experien-
ces and understandings, which is particularly useful in
a field where little research has been undertaken.
Their flexibility as a method also means that while
researchers have a predetermined set of questions
they expect to ask during an interview, new lines of
inquiry and questioning can be pursued when relevant
and appropriate, enabling the capture of additional
data
not
originally
considered
relevant
by
the
researcher [22]. As with much qualitative research, this
study was underpinned by an interpretivist epistemo-
logic position which views data not as a simple reflec-
tion of reality, but as a means through which it is
possible to understand a person’s experience of the
particular phenomenon under investigation [23].
In response to uncertainties about the size of the
potential research population, a diverse recruitment
strategy was employed, using purposive sampling [17].
Recruitment began in October 2012. Participants were
recruited through online fora (n ¼ 20), from two pri-
vate British fertility clinics (n ¼ 7) and through partici-
pant referrals (n ¼ 4). As the number of women who
had frozen their eggs for social reasons in UK was
unknown but assumed to be very small, the research
also recruited participants from USA where the pro-
cedure had been taken up by larger numbers of
women. The final sample comprised 31 women drawn
from UK (n ¼ 23), USA (n ¼ 7) and one further partici-
pant from Norway who was recruited due to her
engagement with a UK-based online forum where the
research was advertized. In-depth interviews were
undertaken, either face to face (n ¼ 16), through video-
enabled connections such as Skype and Facetime
(n ¼ 9) or by telephone (n ¼ 6). Prior to the interview
taking place, participants completed a short demo-
graphic questionnaire (Table 1).
At the time of undergoing the first round of egg
freezing, participants were aged between 32 and
44 years with a mean age of 37 years. For most
participants, several years had elapsed between under-
going the procedure and taking part in the study. At
the time of the interview the participants were aged
between 34 and 49 years and were on average
39 years of age. All participants identified as hetero-
sexual, and at the time of freezing their eggs the
majority
(84%),
were
unpartnered.
All
participants
were educated to degree level; 39% also had a post-
graduate degree and 29% held a professional qualifica-
tion. The majority (74%) were in professional and
managerial occupations (Table 1). The participant pro-
file reflected a high degree of homogeneity and was
made up of predominantly white, middle class women.
However, this is unlikely to be a reflection of insuffi-
cient sampling but instead reflective of the very spe-
cific demographic profile of women who make use of
egg freezing technology, as reflected in other data
sets [24–26].
The semi-structured interviews lasted on average
1 h and 40 min (range: 40 min to 3 h) and were audio-
recorded. Data were transcribed verbatim and ana-
lyzed using thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and
Clarke [27] assisted by Nvivo 10 (Victoria, Australia).
This process consists of six phases: data familiarization,
generation of initial codes, searching for themes,
reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and
producing the report. The analysis began with a pro-
cess of open coding coupled with the use and gener-
ation of in vivo concepts and codes. Additional a priori
concepts informed by published literature were also
used to aid the coding process and to develop
broader thematic categories [28]. Following an intense

Results
The following presents a discussion of the several
often-inter-related factors and issues which the partici-
pants described as shaping the complex process of
deciding to freeze eggs. Through the examination of
one theme “Motivations for social egg freezing” this
article explores how the feeling of “running out of
time”; the lack of a suitable partner and fear of panic
partnering; the fear of future regret and blame; the
existence of compromised fertility or health problems;
and a number of critical events shaped women’s use
of the technology. This discussion will also examine
the (in)significance of women’s careers in their deci-
sion to undergo the procedure.
Motivations for social egg freezing
“Running out of time”
Central to all participants’ accounts was the fear of or
perception that they were running out of time to pur-
sue motherhood in the way in which they desired:
conceiving, carrying and jointly parenting a child gen-
etically related to both partners in a committed
relationship.
When participants talked about running out of time
they did so with reference to two facets of their lives.
Firstly, running out of time to find a partner, and sec-
ondly running out of time to conceive naturally. When
discussing their concerns about running out of time to
find a partner, the participants would sometimes sug-
gest that they felt they had become “out of sync” with
their peer group some of whom had already formed
partnerships and had children.
I would say oh my biological clock is ticking you know
I need to meet someone. Anne, 36
This concern with “running out of time” due to
reproductive ageing was a major concern for all
participants.
I felt like the reason I was doing it was because I felt
like I was running out of time. Melanie, 36
While an understanding and concern about ageing
was at the center of women’s use of egg freezing, sev-
eral women reported that, prior to engaging with the
technology, they had known comparatively little about
fertility, its limits and its relationship to age. These
women described having some limited understanding
of the relationship between age and the ability to con-
ceive but stated that their knowledge was insufficient
or lacking in depth. In particular, some of these
women had overestimated their likelihood of conceiv-
ing at an older age or had overestimated the efficacy
of assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF.
It was shocking for me, my knowledge was very, very
minimal and I thought that anyone could really have a
baby until they were about 55. I knew that fertility
was affected because I had heard so much about it
but I didn’t realise how drastically your chances of
having a baby are reduced. Mary, 49
Lack of a suitable partner and fear of
“panic partnering”
At the time of undergoing egg freezing, most partici-
pants were not in a relationship (n ¼ 26). Of the five
women who were, two stated that their partner did
not want to have children, two were in a new relation-
ship which they believed needed time to develop
before considering having a child and one was unsure
about the potential longevity of their current partner-
ship. For all of the participants, it was their lack of a
suitable
partner
with
whom
they
could
pursue
motherhood
that
led
them
to
undergo
social
egg freezing.
I would like to have a family and I was about 38-39
and hadn’t met somebody. Ellen, 45
I had only just started in a relationship with a guy and
we hadn’t been together very long and I didn’t want
to wait two or three years to see if we were going to
be a couple. Mary, 49
Participants often had a clear idea about how they
wanted to go about mothering, under what circum-
stances; with whom and when and were committed to
a particular ideal of “proper” motherhood. This was
perceived as parenting with a committed partner who
had a strong desire to be a father and to be engaged
and
active
in
the
woman’s
pregnancy
and
the
upbringing
of
children.
However,
many
women
reported that they had found it difficult to find such a
partner and several reported that they had encoun-
tered negative attitudes from men with regards to
“settling down” and pursuing parenthood.
JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

 Most people down here [city], they don’t want to
commit. It's very difficult to find someone you know
that actually wants the same things as you want and I
think that is part of the struggle. Charlotte, 42
The strong desire to “do” motherhood in a certain
way meant that the women described feeling unwill-
ing to compromise on their ideals when considering
relationships. The time sensitive nature of this decision
to pursue motherhood meant that many women felt
under pressure to meet a partner as soon as possible.
However, several shared a fear that their concerns
about time running out would lead them to comprom-
ise their desires and expectations when choosing a
partner; egg freezing was one way of trying to avoid
making the wrong choice of partner as time ran out.
That takes an awful long time, so unless you are just
going to take the next man you meet there is a lot of
pressure on to try and find that person and it’s not
that easy thing to do and perhaps you end up trying
to compromise on what you are after which isn’t really
part of who I am. Holly, 38
This fear of “panic-partnering”, was expressed by
almost two-thirds (n ¼ 19) of the women. Several
stated that they had seen friends or family members
pursue relationships with men to avoid unwanted
childlessness, only to regret this later when the rela-
tionships broke down; the participants were keen not
to make the same “mistakes”.
I know that these days there are a lot of women that
just decide oh my god I am in my late thirties I am
just going to try and get pregnant with the next
person that I meet. Whereas I suppose I am a
conservative at heart and just didn’t want to do that.
Hayley, 38
Many participants held what might be considered
conventional views of family life: they sought to meet
and marry a partner prior to childbearing and often
described that at the time of undergoing egg freezing,
they were unwilling to consider alternative means of
family building such as through co-parenting, single
parenthood via sperm donation or motherhood via
egg donation. This was not only because they sought
to have a genetic connection with their future off-
spring but also because they placed significant import-
ance on their child also sharing a genetic relationship
with their partner. This helps explain why these
women sought to make use of egg freezing rather
than the more tested technology of embryo freezing
(e.g. by creating and freezing embryos using donor
sperm); they were seeking a genetic relationship, not
just between themselves and their child, but to create
a family where the child shares genetic relatedness
with both parents.
Fear of future regret and blame
In addition to the fear of entering into parenthood
with the “wrong” male partner, the participants also
reported fears that they may one day experience
unwanted childlessness. Over a third of the partici-
pants reported fearing that if they did not freeze eggs
they might one day come to regret this decision, espe-
cially if they were later unable to conceive.
If I had not had any eggs frozen but I had thought
about doing it I would have absolutely kicked myself. I
would probably never have forgiven myself. And that
was
one
of
the
motivating
factors
of
doing
it.
Emily, 44
Compromised fertility or health
While the above issues were suggested by women as
key motivating factors for seeking social egg freezing,
a smaller subset of women also discussed an existing
issue with their health or fertility as playing a role in
decision-making. While the concept of “social” egg
freezing is routinely interpreted as the decision to
freeze eggs for non-medical reasons, seven of the par-
ticipants in this research (over 20%) disclosed an
underlying fertility or health issue as affecting their
decision to freeze their eggs. These included endomet-
riosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, blocked fallopian
tubes, the loss of an ovary from a previous illness, and
perception of a risk of premature menopause or a
diagnosis of a serious illness. These participants had
self-identified as freezing their eggs for non-medical
reasons when volunteering for the study, yet in add-
ition to the reasons given above, for these women
there was also an underlying concern that their fertil-
ity, or general health, may be compromised and that
this would affect their ability to conceive.
Critical events
In addition to the factors and issues discussed above,
this study also identified that in 84% (n ¼ 26) of cases
a specific event or happening had prompted the par-
ticipants to take the step of banking their eggs. These
are referred to as “critical events” to distinguish them
from the motivations (defined as factors which inde-
pendently shaped the participant’s decision) described
above. These critical events included a relationship
breakdown, a recent birthday, a recent health scare, or
becoming aware for the first time about the efficacy
of egg freezing for older women.
I had been with somebody and then split up with
them and that kind of at the age of 36 going on 37
4
K. BALDWIN ET AL.
 that kind of triggered something in me which made
me think am I going to meet anyone, and at that
stage I thought I am going to look in to it and so I
contacted the institution that my GP had told me
about and just started that process. Kanta, 41
These critical events thus served as an impetus or
trigger for some of the participants to pursue the pro-
cedure which many of them had been considering for
several months and in some cases for several years.
The (in)significance of career
Much of the media representation of social egg freez-
ing
portrays
women
as
undertaking
this
process
because they have chosen to pursue their career and
“delay” motherhood. However, it is significant in this
study that several women explicitly rejected this repre-
sentation of their motives. Motherhood was on hold
until the right situation or right time and egg freezing
was seen as potentially facilitating this. In this post-
ponement,
career
was
not
the
key
issue
for
most women.
I have a good career and all, but I am not that type of
person that has been like working, working, working
and putting off being a mum or putting off being
married. I just have not met the right person to marry
yet and I don’t wanna just be with anybody you
know. Anne, 36
I think the media really misrepresent women who
have children later. I don’t know a single woman who
has put off having babies because of her career.
Patricia, 41
Only three women discussed employment issues as
of significance in their decision making and for these
women, this was not perceived as a “choice” of career
first, motherhood later, but a calculation that they
would not be able to make motherhood work in the
way they desired in their current employment context.
Discussion
Participants actively contested the idea that they were
making a simple choice to “delay” motherhood by
freezing their eggs. Instead the decision to undergo
this procedure was shaped by a fear of running out of
time to conceive a child due to the ticking “biologic
clock”; concerns about conceiving at an older age;
their current lack of a suitable partner with whom to
pursue a particular and conventional form of family
building or the reluctance of current partners to com-
mit to fatherhood, as well as a desire to avoid future
regrets. This confirms findings from social scientific
authors such as Waldby [15] as well as that from clinic
based research such as Nekkebroeck et al. [29] and
Hodes-Wertz et al. [30]. The present study also identi-
fied how, for some women, use of egg freezing was
influenced by recent fertility or health diagnoses.
While social egg freezing is routinely interpreted as
the decision to freeze eggs for non-medical reasons a
more nuanced interpretation may be needed given
that over 20% of participants in this research disclosed
an underlying fertility or health issue as implicated in
their
decision.
This
suggests
that
the
distinction
between egg freezing for medical and for social rea-
sons may be more porous than first anticipated.
It was very important for all the participants to
have what they perceived to be the full commitment
of a partner to parenthood. However, several women
reported a disjuncture between their expectations or
hopes of men in the procreative realm [31] and the
men with whom they met and formed relationships.
Several women expressed concerns to avoid making a
poor choice of partner in a time-limited context—
what we have termed “panic partnering”—and instead
wanted to parent with a male partner equally commit-
ted
to
childrearing.
In
particular,
the
participants
sought to parent with a male partner who exhibited
characteristics associated with “new fatherhood” [9,32].
These findings confirm previous research that suggests
the importance of relationship status and the nature
of intimate relations in women’s use of social egg
freezing [33]. These findings are also reflective of
broader social science research examining reproduct-
ive timing which has shown how the desire for a
secure and stable relationship is often the most
important precondition women and men consider
when planning for parenthood [34–37].
This study has also highlighted the role of fear and
regret in the decision to freeze eggs, noting how
women reported the avoidance of guilt and blame as
a reason for undergoing the procedure. This finding
also demonstrates how participants’ decision to freeze
eggs was strongly linked to the desire to avoid self-
blame or recrimination in the face of unwanted child-
lessness, as well as to the belief that undergoing egg
freezing was more responsible than doing nothing to
protect their fertility. This anticipation of future regret
has been identified in several studies examining med-
ical decision-making [38,39]. Furthermore, research by
Sandelowski [40] and Throsby [41] has shown how
anticipatory regret is a major motivating factor influ-
encing individuals to engage in, and persist with,
“hope technologies” such as assisted conception [42].
The desire reported by participants to take action
against the effects of age-related fertility decline and
to avoid future regrets arguably also reflects neoliberal

 values of individual responsibility and self-actualiza-
tion, wherein social actors are cast as responsible for
managing their own lives regardless of the constraints
on their behavior or choices [43,44]. As such, and as
has been argued in more detailed elsewhere [10], it is
possible to understand female users of social egg
freezing
as
reproductive
entrepreneurs
or
“repropreneurs” [11] whose privileged financial pos-
ition means they can access and afford elective treat-
ments and deploy them in their pursuit of their
individual life goals.
Limitations and strengths
The limitations of this study relate to the constitution
of the sample and to the self-selecting recruitment of
participants. The sample displays a high degree of
homogeneity with regards to the demographic profile
of the participants. However, participants’ accounts
demonstrated a diversity of experiences and timing of
undergoing social egg freezing; while some of the
women had only just completed the process others
had undergone the procedure as much as 5–7 years
earlier. As a result, participants were able to talk in
detail about different aspects of egg freezing and its
impact on their reproductive lives.
Conclusion
The accounts of women in this study provide a signifi-
cant challenge to popular media stereotypes which
have suggested that women are engaging with social
egg freezing to deliberately delay motherhood in
order to pursue career advancement. Despite the ubi-
quity of this impression, there is little empirical evi-
dence for this proposition. Instead, for women in this
study, age, relationship status, concerns about current
intimate relationships and fears of future regret were
key issues underpinning their decision to freeze their
eggs. Many participants felt they had not deliberately
chosen to “delay” motherhood, but that they had not
yet been in a position where motherhood was an
option, most often due to the lack of a partner who
they felt could commit to the parenting project. Men’s
roles as potential fathers, as well as intimate partners,
were thus critical to women’s perceptions about the
timing of motherhood.
Egg freezing was an attempt to preserve fertility in
the absence of specific life conditions deemed crucial
for pursuing parenthood. This research therefore dem-
onstrates the complex ways in which women’s and
men’s reproductive choices and desires are entwined
and constrain and influence one another. Thus, when
discussing egg freezing with potential users of this
technology clinicians need to be aware of how deci-
sions about the timing of parenthood, as well as use
of social egg freezing, are influenced by complex
structural and relational factors which contest the
description of this as a simple “lifestyle choice”. Finally,
women may perceive freezing as a “hope technology”
and as such clinicians should ensure that they provide
women with individualized information about poten-
tial future reproductive outcomes and ensure that
they are aware that IVF/ICSI and pregnancy at an older
age also carry risks.

 � Current knowledge on the subject
�
There have been few studies of motivations for social egg freezing. Existing small-scale studies identify the lack of a partner and concerns
about future regret as important in women’s decision making.
� What this study adds
�
Drawing on the accounts of 31 women, this study adds further detailed insight into the motivations of those who have undertaken social
egg freezing, identifying in particular the fear of running out of time to find a partner, concerns about “panic-partnering”, conventional views
of parenthood and the role of critical events. The article also suggests that health concerns may be a factor for some women and questions
the dominant media representation of women who freeze their eggs.
