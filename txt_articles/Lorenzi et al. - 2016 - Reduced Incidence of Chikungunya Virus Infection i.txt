On May 10, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Aedes species mosquitoes transmit chikungunya virus, as well 
as dengue and Zika viruses, and bite most often during the 
day.* Infectious mosquito bites frequently occur in and around 
homes (1,2). Caribbean countries first reported local transmis-
sion of chikungunya virus in December 2013, and soon after, 
chikungunya virus spread throughout the Americas (3). Puerto 
Rico reported its first laboratory-positive chikungunya case 
in May 2014 (4), and subsequently identified approximately 
29,000 suspected cases throughout the island by the end of 
2015.† Because conventional vector control approaches often 
fail to result in effective and sustainable prevention of infec-
tion with viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (5), and to 
improve surveillance of mosquito population densities, CDC 
developed an Autocidal Gravid Ovitrap (AGO) (6) to attract 
and capture the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes responsible 
for transmission of infectious agents to humans (Figure). The 
AGO trap is a simple, low-cost device that requires no use of 
pesticides and no servicing for an extended period of time (6).
Since 2012, four communities in two municipalities in 
southern Puerto Rico, Salinas and Guayama, have participated 
in an ongoing field trial of AGO traps to control Ae. aegypti 
mosquitoes. Two intervention communities used three AGO 
traps per home for vector control whereas the other two, 
nonintervention communities, used only surveillance traps to 
monitor mosquito population densities. With AGO control 
traps placed around approximately 85% of homes in inter-
vention communities in addition to randomly distributed 
surveillance traps, captures of adult Ae. aegypti mosquitos in 
the intervention communities decreased (6–8). From June 
2014 to December 2014, after the identification of the first 
laboratory-positive chikungunya case, the average densities of 
Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes were 1.1 and 11.6 per surveil-
lance trap per week in communities with and without AGO 
control traps, respectively (CDC, unpublished data), and this 
approximately tenfold difference in mosquito densities between 
the nonintervention and intervention areas remained relatively 
constant throughout 2015.
AGO traps have remained in place in the same configuration 
in the four communities from the start of the field trial to the 
present. Therefore, the introduction of chikungunya virus into 
the previously unexposed population of Puerto Rico provided 
a unique opportunity to assess whether the lower mosquito 
densities observed in areas with AGO traps were associated with 
reduced incidence of chikungunya virus infection through a 
serosurvey in these communities. A CDC Institutional Review 
Board approved a serosurvey for this purpose.
Stratified random sampling targeted 620 households from 
intervention and nonintervention communities, representing 
28.5% of residents of the communities participating in the 
AGO field trial. Field personnel visited the selected households 
up to three times each to recruit household members for par-
ticipation in the study. All residents of the selected households 
except children aged <5 years were eligible to participate. 
Participating household members provided a blood specimen 
and completed a questionnaire on household characteristics, 
demographics, history of recent illnesses, and personal mos-
quito bite prevention practices. Serum specimens were tested 
by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (9) to detect evidence of chikungunya virus infection. 
The prevalence of chikungunya virus IgG antibody after the 
introduction of chikungunya virus in a population without pre-
vious chikungunya virus exposure provides a valid estimate of 
chikungunya virus incidence in residents of these communities.
This report contains preliminary results from data collected 
during November 2015–February 2016. In the sampling frame, 
377 of 620 houses were occupied with a household member 
responding to field personnel visits. Of the 377 responding 
households from the two intervention and two nonintervention 
communities, 233 households (62%) participated in the study, 
and 327 (64%) of 511 eligible household members agreed to par-
ticipate. The proportion of female participants (63%) and mean 
age of participants (53 years) were somewhat greater than those 
measures for all eligible household members (55%; 49 years). 
The female/male distribution and mean age of participants from 
intervention communities were not significantly different from 
those of participants from nonintervention communities. After

adjustment for sample design, the proportion of chikungunya 
virus IgG antibody among participants from the two inter-
vention communities was one half that of participants from 
intervention communities (risk ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence 
interval = 0.38–0.71) (Table).
Lower incidence of chikungunya virus infection in the 
intervention compared with nonintervention communities 
occurred in the context of tenfold lower mosquito densities 
in the intervention areas with AGO traps. These preliminary 
findings suggest AGO traps might reduce virus transmission 
by reducing mosquito density. Additional data and statisti-
cal analyses are ongoing to account for nonresponse, adjust 
for age of participants and community characteristics, and 
evaluate associations between behaviors and chikungunya virus 
incidence. CDC produces AGO traps in limited numbers. To 
increase the availability of AGO traps for surveillance and for 
further studies of their use in control of Ae. aegypti mosqui-
toes in other settings and on a larger scale, efforts are under 
way for private sector companies to mass produce AGO traps 
of similar quality with comparable adult female Ae. aegypti 
mosquito capture rates.
