Key Points
• Characterization of the
kinetics and risk factors for
severe CRS after CD19
CAR T cells will facilitate
preemptive therapy and
management.
• Severe CRS is characterized
by endothelial activation.
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of CD19-specific chimeric antigen
receptor–modified (CAR) T cells has produced impressive antitumor responses in
patientswithrefractoryCD191B-cellmalignanciesbutisoftenassociatedwithcytokinerelease
syndrome (CRS). Our understanding of CRS continues to evolve, and identification of the
kinetics of CRS and predictive clinical and laboratory biomarkers of severity are needed to
evaluate strategies to mitigate toxicity. We report the clinical presentation of and
identify biomarkers of severe CRS in 133 adult patients who received CD19 CAR
T cells. CRS developed in 70% of patients, including 62.5% with grade 1 to 3 CRS
(grade 1, 26%; grade 2, 32%; grade 3, 4.5%), 3.8% with grade 4, and 3.8% with grade 5.
A majority of cases of grade ‡4 CRS occurred during CAR T-cell dose finding.
Multivariable analysis of baseline characteristics identified high marrow tumor
burden, lymphodepletion using cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, higher CAR
T-cell dose, thrombocytopenia before lymphodepletion, and manufacturing of CAR T cells without selection of CD81 central
memory T cells as independent predictors of CRS. Severe CRS was characterized by hemodynamic instability, capillary leak, and
consumptive coagulopathy. Angiopoietin-2 and von Willebrand factor, which are biomarkers of endothelial activation, were
increased during severe CRS and also before lymphodepletion in patients who subsequently developed CRS. We describe a
classification-tree algorithm to guide studies of early intervention after CAR T-cell infusion for patients at high risk of severe
CRS. These data provide a framework for early intervention studies to facilitate safer application of effective CD19 CAR T-cell
therapy. (Blood. 2017;130(21):2295-2306)
Introduction
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of T cells
that are engineered to express CD19-specific chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cells has shown remarkable efficacy in patients
with relapsed and/or refractory CD191 B-cell malignancies.
Reported complete response (CR) rates are as high as 93% in
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) along with overall
response rates of 77% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
82% in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).1-13 Durable CRs without
subsequent antitumor therapy have been observed in a subset of
patients who received CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, which demon-
strates the potential of this approach to improve survival in otherwise
refractory patients.1,2,8
After adoptivetransfer,CARTcellsare activated by encounterwith
CD191 tumor or normal B cells, which results in proliferation of CAR
T cells, lysis of the target cell, and cytokine secretion that can be as-
sociated with the clinical evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
and neurotoxicity. CRS after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy presents with
fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, and capillary leak and has been re-
portedtooccurin54%to91%ofpatients,includingsevereCRSin8.3%
to 43%.1,2,7-10,14-16 The increased availability of CD19 CAR T-cell
therapies in multicenter trials highlights the need to provide clinicians
whotreatpatientswithB-ALL,CLL,orNHLwithadetaileddescription
of the clinical symptoms of CRS.17,18
A comprehensive description of the time course of presentation
and biomarkers of CRS in a large cohort of patients has not been
reported. Here, we report the clinical and laboratory findings from
133 adult patients with CD191 relapsed/refractory B-ALL, CLL,
or NHL who received lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed
by infusion of CD19 CAR T cells. We identify risk factors before
and after CAR T-cell infusion that are associated with the
incidence and severity of subsequent CRS, which allows identifica-
tion of patients at high risk of severe toxicity who might be candidates
for early intervention studies. The data will facilitate recognition,
diagnosis, and treatment of CRS.

 Methods
Study design
We enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory CD191 B-cell malignancies in a
phase 1/2 clinical trial that evaluated lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed
by CD19 CAR T cells.1,2 The study titled “Phase I/II Study of Immunotherapy
for Advanced CD19+ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia/Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma with Defined Subsets of
Autologous T Cells Engineered to Express a CD19-Specific Chimeric Antigen
Receptor” (NCT01865617) was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki with approval by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center Institutional Review Board. This article reports clinical and laboratory
data from 133 consecutively treated patients in the study who received their first
cycle of lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell infusion.
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CD19 CAR T-cell infusion
ThedesignoftheCARtransgeneandCART-cellmanufacturingfromCD41Tcells
and either bulk or central memory–enriched CD81 T cells have been previously
described (supplemental Data available on the Blood Web site).1,2 A truncated
human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) was encoded in the lentiviral
vectortoallowpreciseenumerationoftransducedCARTcellsbyflowcytometry.19
Patients received lymphodepletion chemotherapy with a cyclophosphamide-based
regimen with or without fludarabine (supplemental Table 1), followed 2 to 4 days
later by infusion with CD19 CAR T cells formulated in a 1:1 ratio of CD41:CD81
andinfusedat1of3doselevels(DLs;DL1, 2 3 105 EGFRt1 cells per kg; DL2,
2 3 106 EGFRt1 cells per kg; DL3, 2 3 107 EGFRt1 cells per kg).
CRS grading and neurotoxicity
TheseverityofCRSwasgradedaccordingtoconsensuscriteria.20Neurologicadverse
events (AEs) were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events v4.0.3 and did not contribute to organ toxicity criteria for CRS grading.
Evaluation of clinical laboratory parameters, CAR T-cell counts,
and serum biomarkers
Blood was collected before lymphodepletion, on day 0 before CAR T-cell infusion,
and at intervals after CAR T-cell infusion for analysesof complete blood counts, renal
function,hepaticfunction,coagulation,andserumcytokineconcentrations.Inasubset
of patients, serum angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1), Ang-2, and von Willebrand factor (VWF)
concentrations were measured. CD41 and CD81 CAR T cells were identified by
flow cytometry as viable CD451CD31CD41CD8–EGFRt1 and CD451CD31
CD4–CD81EGFRt1 events, respectively, in a lymphocyte forward scatter/side
scatter gate. Additional details are provided in supplemental Data.
Statistical analyses
Statistical methods are reported in supplemental Data.
Results
Patient and treatment characteristics
One hundred thirty-three patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell
malignancies were included in the analyses (B-ALL, n 5 47; CLL,
n 5 24; NHL, n 5 62). The median age was 54 years (range, 20-73
years), and the median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 1-11
prior therapies; Table 1). Twenty-five patients (19%) had previously
undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT),
22 (17%) had undergone autologous HCT, and 3 (2%) had undergone
both allogeneic and autologous HCT. The lymphodepletion regimens
given before CAR T-cell infusion are shown in supplemental Table 1.
A majority of patients (78%) received a regimen containing both
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Thirty-five patients (26%) received
CAR T cells at DL1, 86 (65%) at DL2, and 12 (9%) at DL3.
The incidence and kinetics of CRS and neurotoxicity
CRS of any grade developed in 93 (70%) of 133 patients. The
incidence, severity, and clinical presentation of CRS in B-ALL, CLL,
and NHL patients were similar (Table 1; supplemental Figures 1-2).
Amajorityofpatients(123 [92.5%] of133)had eithernoCRS(grade0,
30%), or grade 1to3 CRS(grade 1,26%;grade 2, 32%; grade 3,4.5%).
Ten patients (7.5%) developed grade $4 CRS (grade 4, 3.8%; grade 5,
3.8%) (Figure 1). Five of these 10 patients died within the first 30 days
after CAR T-cell infusion as a result of complications associated with
CRS and/or neurotoxicity. One additional patient died 4 months after
CAR T-cell therapy as a result of irreversible neurotoxicity. Of the
10 patients (7.5%) with grade $4 CRS, 8 were enrolled and received
CAR T cells during the dose-escalation phase of the study. At the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CAR T cells, grade $4 CRS was
observed in 2 (2.5%) of 79 patients.
Fever $38°C was the firstobjective sign of CRS with the exception
of 1 patient who presented with hypotension without fever. Fever
occurred a median of 2.2 days (IQR, 0.9-5.6 days) after CAR T-cell
infusion and lasted for a median of 3.0 days (IQR, 1.2-4.8 days)
(Table 2). Compared with patients who had grade 1 to 3 CRS, patients
who had grade $4 CRS experienced fever earlier after CAR T-cell
infusion (P , .0001) and the fever peaked earlier (P 5 .001), reached
a higher maximum temperature (P , .0001), and was of longer
duration (P 5 .03; Table2; Figure 2A-B). All patients who ultimately
had grade $4 CRS were febrile within 25 hours after CAR T-cell
infusion, and only 4 patients (all with grade #3 CRS) developed their
first fever more than 12 days after CAR T-cell infusion (Figure 2A).
Fifty-three (40%) of 133 patients had 1 or more grade $1 neurologic
AEs (grade 1-2, 18%; grade $3, 21%), and the severity of
neurotoxicity was associated with the severity of CRS (P , .0001;
supplemental Table 2). All patients with grade $4 CRS also
developed grade $3 neurotoxicity (Figure 2C). Neurotoxicity typically
presented after CRS (P 5 .003), with the first neurologic AE of any
grade presenting a median of 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days) after CAR
T-cell infusion (Figure 2D). The first grade $3 neurologic AE
presented 4.5 days (IQR, 3.2-6.2 days) after the first fever.
One hundred nine patients (82%) received both the lymphodeple-
tion chemotherapy and CAR T-cell infusion in the outpatient setting.
Outpatients were admitted at the first fever $38°C. Because the
severity of CRS did not reach grade $3 until a median of 3.4 days after
onset of fever (range, 1.4-4.7 days), there was sufficient time for
hospital admission and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the
progression of CRS. The median duration of hospitalization for all
patients was 7 days (IQR, 3-14 days), and it was associated with the
maximum severity of CRS (grade 0, median 0 days; grade 1-3, 9 days;
grade $4, 18 days; P , .0001; supplemental Table 2). Twenty-six
patients (20%) with CRS and/or neurotoxicity received tocilizumab
and/or dexamethasone to treat CRS and/or neurotoxicity. Twenty
patients received dexamethasone and tocilizumab, 5 received dexa-
methasone alone, and one received tocilizumab alone. All patients who
received tocilizumab had grade $3 CRS and/or neurotoxicity, except
2patientswhohadprogressivegrade2CRS.Feverresolvedatamedian
of 0.4 days (IQR, 0.2-2.0 days) following the first dose of tocilizumab
or dexamethasone.
Severe CRS is associated with vascular instability and
organ dysfunction
After CAR T-cell infusion, patients with severe CRS exhibited
hemodynamic instability and capillary leak with hypotension,
tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, and

 weight gain (Figure 3). Seventeen of 133 patients (13%) required
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of CRS
and/or neurologic AEs, and the median duration of their stay in the
ICU was 3 days (IQR, 2-7 days). Eleven (8%) of 133 patients
received vasopressor support. Only 2 patients with grade #3 CRS
required vasopressor support. Ten patients (7.5%) required intubation
tomanagerespiratoryfailureassociatedwithsevereneurotoxicity(n55),
managementofpulmonarydysfunction(n53),ordiseaseprogression
(n 5 2).
All patients with grade $4 CRS also developed grade $3
nonneurologic organ toxicity, which resolved a median of 24 days
(range, 12-32 days) after resolution of fever. Nine of the 10 patients
with grade $4 CRS developed hepatic dysfunction, manifested
by elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, with 5 patients having grade $3
transaminase elevation (supplemental Figure 3A-D). The aspartate
aminotransferase peaked between days 2 and 5, whereas the alanine
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin peaked
later at day 6 to 8. One patient developed late hepatic dysfunction on
day 20 associated with severe hypotension as a result of gastrointes-
tinal hemorrhage. Three of the 10 patients with grade $4 CRS
developed grade $3 acute kidney injury, with 1 patient requiring
hemodialysis for 15 days until recovery of renal function (supple-
mental Figure 3E-F). Only 3 patients with grade #3 CRS developed
grade 3 nonneurologic organ toxicity (2 hepatic, 1 cardiac), and these
events resolved in 1 to 2 days.
Delayed hematopoietic recovery in patients with grade ‡4 CRS
We evaluated recovery of blood counts in all patients who had received
lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T-cell infusion. To ensure
that observed differences in hematopoietic toxicity in patients with
distinct grades of CRS were not the result of differences in inten-
sity of the lymphodepletion regimen, only patients who received
cyclophosphamide/fludarabinelymphodepletion(n5104)wereincluded
in this analysis. The absolute neutrophil count, hematocrit, hemoglobin
concentration, and platelet count declined after cyclophosphamide/
fludarabine chemotherapy, reaching nadirs between days 2 and 5 after
CAR T-cell infusion (Figure 4A-D). The absolute neutrophil count,
hematocrit, and platelet nadirs were lower in patients with more severe
CRS, and patients with grade $4 CRS received more platelet (P 5 .002)
and red cell (P 5 .04) transfusions than those with grade #3 CRS

From 
 (Figure 4E). Five of 10 patients with grade $4 CRS became
refractory to platelet transfusion. Marrow tumor burden (P , .0001),
the number of prior therapies (P 5 .02), and the occurrence of CRS
(P 5 .0002) were associated with longer hematologic recovery. The
time to hematologic recovery was longer than expected in most
patients with grade 4 CRS (supplemental Table 3) and was delayed in
patients with grade 1 to 3 CRS (median, 13.5 days [IQR, 6.5-18.1
days]) compared with those without CRS (median, 4.1 days [IQR,
2.9-7.5 days]; P 5 .0002).
CRS has been associated with macrophage activation syndrome.20,21
Consistent with this, we observed higher ferritin and C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels, and more prolonged monocytopenia in the blood of
patients with grade $4 CRS compared with those who had grade #3
CRS (supplemental Figure 3G-I). However, examination of bone
marrow biopsies from patients with grade $4 CRS showed no
evidence of increased hemophagocytosis that might contribute to
delayed hematopoietic recovery. Rather, in 5 of 7 patients with
grade $4 CRS and available marrow pathologic examination, the
bone marrow was hypocellular without morphologic evidence of
residual tumor, suggesting that there may be alternative mechanisms
for delayed recovery (supplemental Table 3).
Consumptive coagulopathy in grade ‡4 CRS
We examined the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thrombo-
plastin time (aPTT), D-dimer, and fibrinogen in patients at intervals
after CAR T-cell infusion. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagula-
tion were excluded from the analyses (n 5 9). In the first week after
CART-cellinfusion,patientswith grade #3 CRShadnormalormildly
elevated PT, aPTT, D-dimer, and fibrinogen. In contrast, those with
grade $4 CRS developed early prolongation of the PT and aPTT,
which peaked approximately 2 to 5 days after CAR T-cell infusion
(Figure 4F-G). Increasing D-dimer and falling fibrinogen concentra-
tions started on days 2 to 5, with hypofibrinogenemia occurring from
days 9 to 12, consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation
(Figure 4H-I). Compared with patients with grade 1 to 3 CRS, those
with grade $4 CRS received more cryoprecipitate transfusions to
correct coagulopathy (P , .0001; Figure 4E) and had more severe and
prolongedthrombocytopenia(Figure4D).Grade$3bleedingoccurred

fragmentation was not a prominent feature on analysis of blood film

 Biomarkers of endothelial activation are elevated in severe CRS
The presence of hemodynamic instability, capillary leak, and a con-
sumptive coagulopathy raised the possibility that endothelial activation
mightcontributetotheclinicalfindingsofsevereCRS.VWFisreleased
from Weibel-Palade bodies upon endothelial activation22 and plays a
key role in the initiation of coagulation. To determine whether in vivo
endothelial activation was present in patients with severe CRS, we
evaluated serum concentrations of VWF at the peak of CAR T-cell
expansion in blood in a subset of 60 patients with different severities of
CRS (grade 0, n 5 12; grade 1-3, n 5 39; grade $4, n 5 9). We found
that patients with grade $4 CRS had higher VWF concentrations
compared with those who had grade #3 CRS (Figure 4J). Serum
concentrations of Ang-2, which is also released from Weibel-Palade
bodies on endothelial activation and promotes capillary leak,23,24
were also higher in patients with grade $4 CRS (supplemental
Figure 4A). Ang-1promotesendothelialstability,andanincreaseinthe

From 
 sepsis and cerebral malaria.25-30 At the peak of CAR T-cell expansion in
blood, increasing severity of CRS was associated with lower Ang-1,
higher Ang-2, and an increased Ang-2:Ang-1 ratio (Figure 4K;
supplemental Figure 4A). Of note, before both lymphodepletion
and CAR T-cell infusion, and on day 1 after CAR T-cell infusion,
increasing serum VWF concentration was associated with increased
severity of subsequent CRS (supplemental Figure 4B). Furthermore,
before lymphodepletion and on day 1 after CAR T-cell infusion,
there was an association between increased Ang-2:Ang-1 and
severity of CRS (supplemental Figure 4C). Together, these data
indicate that biomarkers of endothelial activation are elevated during
severe CRS and that endothelial activation even prior to commenc-
ing lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell therapy may increase the risk
of subsequent development of severe CRS.
Patient and treatment characteristics associated with the
development and severity of CRS
To identify patients at risk of developing CRS, we performed
univariable analyses of the impact of baseline clinical and laboratory
characteristics on the development of any grade of CRS. Patients
with higher marrow tumor burden (P , .0001), a higher percentage
of CD191 cells in the marrow (P 5 .0001), and more severe
thrombocytopenia (P 5 .002) were at higher risk of developing
CRS (Table 1). Manufacturing of CAR T cells using bulk CD81
T cells without selection of the central memory subset (P 5 .001)
and the infused CAR T-cell dose (P 5 .002) were associated with
increased risk of CRS. Despite our previous observation that addition
of fludarabine to cyclophosphamide in lymphodepletion enhanced in
vivo CAR T-cell expansion,1,2 this was not associated with increased
occurrence of CRS in univariable analysis. However, analysis of the
interaction between CAR T-cell dose and cyclophosphamide/
fludarabine lymphodepletion showed that addition of fludarabine at
any given CAR T-cell dose increased the risk of CRS (P 5 .03).
Stepwise multivariable analysis showed that higher bone marrow
CD191 tumor burden (P , .0001), more severe thrombocytopenia
(P5.05),bulkCD81 T-cell selection (P 5 .03), cyclophosphamide/
fludarabine lymphodepletion (P 5 .02), higher CAR T-cell dose
(P 5 .003), and the interaction effect of CAR T-cell dose and
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion (P 5 .009) were
independently associated with development of CRS (Table 1). Risk
factorsforCRSwithineachdiseasecohortarepresentedinsupplemental
Tables 4A-C.
We then examined risk factors for the occurrence of any grade
of CRS that were identified in the multivariable model to see if these
factors also impacted the severity of CRS (Table 3). Univariable
pairwise analysis showed that only higher CAR T-cell dose
(P 5 .0003) and cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion
(P 5 .03) were associated with the development of grade $4
compared with grade 1 to 3 CRS.
Mitigation of toxicity by reduction in peak CAR T-cell counts in
blood will be associated with reduced response rates
Consistent with the observation that a high CAR T-cell dose and
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion were associated with
severity of CRS, our data found earlier and higher peaks in absolute
CART-cellnumbersinbloodofpatientswithgrade$4CRScompared
with grade 1 to 3 or no CRS (Figure 5A-D). To identify a therapeutic
window of absolute CAR T-cell numbers that would minimize the
risk of CRS and neurotoxicity while retaining a high probability of
antitumoractivityineachdisease,wemodeledtherelationshipbetween
the peak CAR T-cell counts in blood and the occurrence of toxicity or
disease response by using logistic regression (Figure 5E-H). B-ALL
patients who achieved a peak of 10 CD81 CAR T cells per mL had an
estimated probability of minimal residual disease (MRD)–negative
CR of 95%, and the estimated probabilities of grade $2 CRS and
grade $3 neurotoxicity were 37% and 15%, respectively. Similar
findings were noted for patients with 5 CD41 CAR T cells per mL
(MRD-negative CR, 94%; grade $2 CRS, 42%; grade $3
neurotoxicity, 19%). Reduction of the infused CAR T-cell dose
in B-ALL patients with high marrow tumor burden resulted in
consistent targeting of peak CAR T-cell counts in the ranges
associated with high efficacy without undue toxicity2 (supplemen-
tal Table 5); however, the therapeutic window was narrow. The
probabilities of marrow response and toxicity in CLL patients were
similar to those in patients with B-ALL. In NHL patients, a
therapeutic window with high efficacy and low toxicity could not
be established. These data suggest that CAR T-cell dose reduction
as a sole strategy to mitigate toxicity will reduce efficacy and that
early intervention approaches that do not involve reduction in the
peak CAR T-cell counts in blood should be investigated.
Early identification of patients at high risk of severe CRS
We investigated whether patients who would subsequently develop life-
threatening CRS could be identified early after CAR T-cell infusion so
that intervention strategies that might prevent progression of CRS could
bestarted.Allpatientswhodevelopedgrade$4CRShadfever$38.9°C

(sensitivity, 1.00; specificity, 0.84). Patients who developed grade $4
CRS also exhibited higher concentrations of interferon-g, interleukin-6
(IL-6),IL-8,IL-10,IL-15,monocytechemoattractantprotein-1(MCP-1),
tumor necrosis factor receptor p55 (TNFRp55), and macrophage in-
flammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b) within 36 hours after CAR T-cell
infusion compared with those with grade #3 CRS (P , .0001;
Figure 6A-H). These cytokines were elevated before the onset of
grade $3 CRS and demonstrated similar kinetics in B-ALL, CLL, and
NHLpatients(supplementalFigure5),suggestingthat1ormoreofthese
cytokines could be useful as predictive biomarkers for grade $4 CRS
(Figure 6A-H). We performed classification-tree modeling and found

better than CRP, ferritin, or other cytokines and enhanced identification

 Discussion
The success of CD19-specific CAR T-cell immunotherapy for treating
patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignances has resulted in an
increase in the number of clinicians who are required to manage the
novel toxicities associated with this therapy. We describe the clinical
presentation, laboratory findings, and correlative and predictive
biomarkers of CRS in a large cohort of patients who received
lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CD19 CAR T cells to guide
physicians caring for these patients. CRS was a frequent event after
CART-cellimmunotherapy,occurringin70%ofpatients;however,in
a majority ofpatients,itwasmildtomoderateandresolved withindays
without a requirement for tocilizumab or dexamethasone intervention.
Life-threatening CRS was uncommon (7.5%) and mainly occurred
during the CAR T-cell dose escalation phase of our study. At the CAR
T-cell MTD, grade $4 CRS was rare (2.5%). Despite the potential for
severe toxicity, a strategy of hospital admission at the first fever made
outpatient lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T-cell infusion a
feasible approach, even in heavily pretreated patients with advanced
B-cell malignancies.
The risk of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy could potentially be reduced
by identifying patients who are at high risk of developing severe CRS
before therapy and modifying the treatment regimen or recognizing
them early after CAR T-cell infusion when preventative interventions
could be instituted. Multivariable analysis identified baseline and
treatment-related risk factors for CRS, including those associated
with more robust CAR T-cell expansion, such as higher marrow
tumor burden, cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion,
and higher CAR T-cell dose. Other pretreatment factors that were
associated with CRS, such as thrombocytopenia and manufactur-
ing of CAR T cells from bulk CD81 T cells, may be a reflection of
the higher tumor burden in these patients; however, distinct
mechanisms cannot be excluded.
Because in vivo CAR T-cell expansion is driven by recognition of
cells expressing CD19, a logical approach to reducing the riskof severe
CRS is to reduce the CAR T-cell dose in patients with a high tumor
burden. This strategy was effective in mitigating toxicity in B-ALL
patients without impairing efficacy.2 However, our analyses indicate
that the therapeutic window is narrow and that a reduction in CAR
T-cell dose that results in peak CD81 CAR T-cells ,10 cells per mL
andCD41CARTcells,5permLwilllikelyresultinreducedefficacy.
This is particularly true in NHL, in which the probabilities of CR, grade
$2 CRS, and grade $3 neurotoxicity were similar at any given peak
CAR T-cell count.
The risk of impaired efficacy with CAR T-cell dose reduction
suggests that the optimal strategy might enable delivery of an adequate
CAR T-cell dose followed by early intervention in those patients who
exhibit clinical or laboratory findings associated with a high risk
of subsequent toxicity. We previously reported that increases in
distinct serum cytokines within the first day after CAR T-cell
infusion were associated with subsequent requirement for ICU
care.1,2 An association of these cytokines with subsequent grade
$4 CRS was confirmed in the current larger cohort of ALL, CLL,
and NHL patients. A predictive algorithm based on evaluating
multiple cytokine concentrations (as reported in pediatric ALL21)
may be complex and expensive to implement. Therefore, we used
classification-tree modeling to design a simple 2-step algorithm to
predict grade $4 CRS in which a single serum cytokine concentration
was measured only in the small subset of patients with fever $38.9°C
within 36 hours of infusion. The model was designed to identify
patients who would develop life-threatening CRS, despite appro-
priate intervention with tocilizumab and/or dexamethasone for
grade 2 to 3 CRS. The best sensitivity and specificity was obtained
by testing serum MCP-1 in patients with fever $38.9°C within
36 hours of infusion. Fever and CRP evaluation have previously been
used to identify those at risk of severe toxicity9; however, in our
study, MCP-1 evaluation was superior to CRP testing. The optimal
preemptive therapy of high-risk patients is unknown. Although
widely used approaches to treat severe CRS (eg, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg
intravenously and dexamethasone 8 mg/kg intravenously twice
per day) might be suitable, these and other strategies to modify
cytokine signaling should be studied in suitably designed clinical
trials.
The presentation of vascular instability, capillary leak, and con-
sumptive coagulopathy suggested that endothelial activation or dys-
function coincides with severe CRS. This was confirmed by
demonstrating that severe CRS was accompanied by high serum
concentrations of VWF and Ang-2, which are released from Weibel-
Palade bodies on endothelial activation. The mechanisms that lead
to endothelial activation in CRS have not been characterized;
however, the high serum concentrations of endothelium-activating
cytokines, such as IL-6 and interferon-g, observed in patients
with severe CRS suggest that these cytokines may contribute.
Additional studies will be required to determine whether regulation
of endothelial activation, for example by modification of the
Ang-1/2 axis, could be used to treat patients with severe CRS, as
proposed for patients with infection-related microvascular dys-
function.31 We also found that serum VWF and the Ang-2:Ang-1
ratio were higher before starting CAR T-cell immunotherapy
in patients who subsequently developed more severe CRS, suggest-
ing that preexisting endothelial activation might be a previously
unrecognized risk factor for severe CRS. It is noteworthy that
thrombocytopenia before lymphodepletion chemotherapy was also
associated with subsequent severe CRS. Platelets are one of the few
sources of the endothelial stabilizing cytokine Ang-1, suggesting that
patients with severe thrombocytopenia might be prone to endothelial
activation.26
CRS is a common AE after CAR T-cell therapy, but it is well
tolerated in most patients who receive an optimized lymphodepletion
regimen and dose of CAR T cells. The safety profile supports delivery
of this treatment in the outpatient setting, and effective therapies
are available for most patients who develop severe CRS. Additional
understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to severe
CRS will facilitate testing of interventions to prevent or reverse toxicity
and improve the safety of CD19 CAR T cells, and potentially of CAR
T cells targeting other malignancies.32
