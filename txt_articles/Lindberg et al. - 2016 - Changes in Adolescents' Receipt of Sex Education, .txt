Purpose: Updated estimates of adolescents’ receipt of sex education are needed to monitor
changing access to information.
Methods: Using nationally representative data from the 2006e2010 and 2011e2013 National
Survey of Family Growth, we estimated changes over time in adolescents’ receipt of sex education
from formal sources and from parents and differentials in these trends by adolescents’ gender,
race/ethnicity, age, and place of residence.
Results: Between 2006e2010 and 2011e2013, there were significant declines in adolescent fe-
males’ receipt of formal instruction about birth control (70% to 60%), saying no to sex (89% to 82%),
sexually transmitted disease (94% to 90%), and HIV/AIDS (89% to 86%). There was a significant
decline in males’ receipt of instruction about birth control (61% to 55%). Declines were concen-
trated among adolescents living in nonmetropolitan areas. The proportion of adolescents talking
with their parents about sex education topics did not change significantly. Twenty-one percent of
females and 35% of males did not receive instruction about methods of birth control from either
formal sources or a parent.
Conclusions: Declines in receipt of formal sex education and low rates of parental communication
may leave adolescents without instruction, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. More effort is
needed to understand this decline and to explore adolescents’ potential other sources of repro-
ductive health information.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
This
study
documents
recent declines in adoles-
cents’ receipt of formal sex
education about a range of
topics. Parents do not fill
these gaps. Further efforts
to
increase
access
to
comprehensive reproduc-
tive
health
information
are warranted.
Providing adolescents with sexual health information is an
important means of promoting healthy sexual development and
reducing negative outcomes of sexual behaviors [1e4]. National
public health goals [5] and numerous medical and public health
organizations [6,7] recommend that adolescents receive sex
education on a range of topics. However, past research has found
increasing gaps in sex education; analyses of data from the
National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG) indicate that from
1995 to 2006e2008, the proportion of U.S. teens who had
received formal instruction about birth control methods declined
(males, 81% to 62%; females, 87% to 70%) [8,9].
National public health goals call for increasing the share of
adolescents receiving formal instruction about abstinence, birth
control methods, and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs and
increasing the proportion of teens talking with their parents
about these same topics [5]. These goals also establish objectives
for reducing differentials in the receipt of sex education
by
gender,
race/ethnicity,
and
other
sociodemographic
characteristics.

 This analysis examines recent changes in adolescents’ reports
of receipt of formal sex education and instruction from parents,
using nationally representative data from both females and
males from the 2006e2010 and 2011e2013 NSFG. This extends
previous work monitoring national trends in sex education since
1995 [8e11]. We test for differential patterns of receipt of in-
struction by adolescents’ sociodemographic characteristics and
place of residence. We also consider how formal instruction and
the informal sex education provided by parents supplement each
other. These analyses are descriptive, with the objective of
providing ongoing national monitoring needed to inform related
research and policy.
Methods
Data
This analysis used data from the 2006e2010 and 2011e2013
NSFG, a continuous national probability household survey of
women and men aged 15e44 years in the United States (http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm) [12]. The surveys used a multi-
stage, stratified clustered sampling frame to collect interviews
continuously from June 2006 to December 2010 and from June
2011 to June 2013. The National Center for Health Statistics
Institutional Review Board approved data collection.
We limited the analyses to respondents aged 15e19 years at
the time of the interview, resulting in samples of 2,284 and 1,037
females
and
2,378
and
1,088
males
in
2006e2010
and
2011e2013, respectively.
Measures
Formal instruction: in both surveys, respondents were asked
“Before you were 18, did you ever have any formal instruction at
school, church, a community center or some other place about”
the following topics: “how to say no to sex,” “methods of birth
control,” “sexually transmitted diseases,” and “how to prevent
HIV/AIDS.” Additionally, in the 2011e2013 survey, respondents
were also asked about formal instruction on “waiting until
marriage to have sex,” “where to get birth control,” and “how to
use a condom.” The survey added these latter topics to address
concerns that the earlier survey’s measures did not provide
adequate information about the specific instructional content.
Respondents answering that they had received instruction in
a particular topic received follow-up questions about whether
instruction occurred before the first vaginal intercourse.
Informal instruction from parents: respondents were asked
whether they had talked with their parent or guardian about the
following six topics before they were aged 18 years: “how to say
no to sex,” “birth control methods,” “where to get birth control,”
“how to use a condom,” “sexually transmitted diseases,” and
“how to prevent HIV/AIDS.”
Analysis
To examine changes over time in adolescents’ receipt of
formal and informal instruction, the 2006e2010 and 2011e2013
NSFG data sets were merged, and each period was weighted
accordingly. For each period, we calculated the weighted prev-
alence of the receipt of formal instruction by topic, separately for
male and female adolescents; additional topics of instruction
measured in only the 2011e2013 survey were also examined. For
each gender, simple logistic regressions were estimated to test
for significant differences between the two periods in the prev-
alence of each topic by age (15e17 vs. 18e19), race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic), household
poverty status (<200% of poverty line vs. �200% of poverty),
place
of
residence
(central
city,
other
metropolitan
area,
nonmetropolitan area), and religious attendance at age 14 years
(often, sometimes, never); overall differences in receipt by
gender were also tested.1 We also used simple logistic regression
to test for significant differences between periods in the pro-
portion of adolescents who had received instruction in each topic
before the first sex and changes in the proportion of adolescents
talking with their parents about each of the six reproductive
health topics and differences by key demographic groups. Finally,
we estimated the proportion of teens receiving instruction on
each topic from both formal sources and parents, only one
source, or not at all. All analyses accounted for the complex
survey design of the NSFG data using the svy commands in Stata
13.0 [13], and we report only differences with a p value <5%.
Results
Sample characteristics
Among the weighted sample of respondents aged 15e19 years
in 2006e2010 and 2011e2013, the majority were non-Hispanic
white, aged 15e17 years and attended religious services often
when they were aged 14 years (Table 1). About one-third resided
in a central city, half in other metropolitan areas, and the
remaining share in nonmetropolitan statistical areas. There was no
significant change over time in any of these demographic traits for
either gender. In contrast, the share of teens living in households
with income <200% of the household poverty line increased
significantly over time for both females and males.
Formal instruction
Trends by gender. Between 2006e2010 and 2011e2013, there
were significant declines in adolescent females’ reports of the
receipt of formal instruction about birth control (70% to 60%),
saying no to sex (89% to 82%), sexually transmitted disease (STD,
94% to 90%), and HIV/AIDS (89% to 86%) (Table 2). There was a
significant decline in males’ reports of instruction about birth
control (61% to 55%). Both genders had significant increases in
the share reporting formal instruction in saying no to sex
without instruction about birth control (22% to 28% females, 29%
to 35% males).
In 2006e2010, there were significant gender differences in
multiple topics of formal instruction, but differential declines
resulted in no significant differences by gender in 2011e2013 for
the same topics. By 2011e2013, receipt of instruction about STDs
or HIV/AIDS was most common (near 90% for each gender), and
adolescents were less likely to receive instruction about birth
control than about saying no to sex.
Trends by other demographics. Among girls, declines over time in
instruction about saying no to sex and declines in instruction
1 Within each period, we also tested for differences between demographic
groups within each gender; these results are presented but not discussed as the
primary focus was on change over time.

 about birth control were concentrated among whites, with no
significant changes among black or Hispanic girls. Significant
declines between periods in instruction about how to say no to
sex, STDs, and HIV/AIDS occurred only among girls aged 18e19
years and not their younger peers. In contrast, significant de-
clines in instruction about birth control occurred only among the
younger teens for both genders. Adolescents who reported the
highest levels of religious attendance at age 14 years had sig-
nificant declines in receipt of instruction about methods of birth
control (both genders) and how to say no to sex (girls); there was
no change in instruction among teens with less or no religious
attendance. Among girls, there were declines in instruction
about saying no to sex among those living in households with
income <200%; in contrast, a decline in instruction about birth
control occurred only among girls living in households with in-
come �200%.
Both male and female adolescents living in nonmetropol-
itan statistical areas had significant declines in receipt of in-
struction in methods of birth control2, saying no to sex, STDs,
and HIV/AIDS, while there were few declines among teens
residing in central cities or other metropolitan areas (Table 2).
The consistency of these declines for teens in nonmetropolitan
areas across topics of instruction and gender is noteworthy,
especially given the stability across other characteristics among
males.
New
measures. The additional survey items added in the
2011e2013 NSFG allowed measurement of topics of instruction
with more specificity (final columns, Table 2). About three-
quarters of both females and males reported formal instruction
on waiting until marriage to have sex, close to the share reporting
receipt of instruction about how to say no to sex. Girls were
significantly more likely than boys to receive instruction about
where to get birth control (53% vs. 38%), whereas boys were
significantly more likely than girls to receive formal instruction
on how to use a condom (50% females, 58% males). Overall, about
one-quarter of teens reported not receiving instruction on any of
these birth control topics.
Timing of formal instruction. The share of girls receiving in-
struction about how to say no to sex before the first sex declined
significantly (78% to 70%), as did the share of boys receiving in-
struction about birth control methods before the first sex (52% to
43%; Table 3). There was no change over time in instruction about
STDs or HIV/AIDS before the first sex. In 2011e2013, sexually
experienced boys were significantly less likely than girls to
receive instruction before the first sex about methods of birth
control or where to get birth control.
Parents
Between 2006e2010 and 2011e2013, there was little change
in the share of adolescents reporting talking with their parents
about sexual and reproductive health topics. Of the six topics
examined, only the proportion talking with their parents about
how to use a condom increased (males 37% to 45%, females 30%
to 36%, not shown). Given this general stability, we present only
estimates for 2011e2013 (Table 4).
Overall, 22% of females and 30% of males did not talk with
their parents about any of these topics. Among female adoles-
cents, the most common topics discussed with parents were how
to say no to sex, STDs, and birth control methods; among male
adolescents, the most common topics discussed were STDs and
how to use a condom. Boys were more likely than girls to talk
with their parents about how to use a condom; for all the other
topics, girls reported more parental communication than did
boys.
For each of the six topics, there was little variation by age,
place of residence, religiosity, or household income (not shown).
Hispanic males (35%) were significantly less likely than their
black (48%) or white (48%) peers to talk with their parents about
saying no to sex, whereas white males (36%) were less likely to

 talk with their parents about HIV/AIDS than Hispanic (47%) or
black (50%) males. Additionally, black males (58%) were more
likely to talk with their parents about how to use a condom than
were other young men (43% white, 50% Hispanic). Among fe-
males, the only significant differences by race/ethnicity were
higher rates of talking about how to use a condom among His-
panic (46%) and black (45%) than white teens (33%) and higher
rates of talking about STDs among Hispanic (67%) than non-
Hispanic white girls (53%).
Combined sources of information
There was substantial variation by topic and gender in the
extent to which parents and formal instruction supplemented or
reinforced one another (Figure 1). Although many teens received
instruction on specific topics from both schools and parents
(ranging from a low of 13% of males in instruction on where to
get birth control to 54% of girls on STDs), there was a substantial
share of teens who reported receiving instruction on specific
topics only in school (ranging from 25% to 45% across topics).
In contrast, relatively few teens received instruction on a topic
only from a parent. Teens were most likely not to receive in-
struction from either source about birth control methods
generally (21% females, 34% males), where to get birth control
(34% females, 53% males), or how to use a condom (40% females,
30% males).
Discussion
The changes described in these analyses point to significant
reductions in adolescents’ receipt of formal sex education, across
topics addressing abstinence, birth control, and the prevention of
HIV/AIDS and other STDs. This decline in formal instruction has
been concentrated among girls, particularly non-Hispanic white
teens and those living in nonmetropolitan areas. The lack of
gender differences in formal instruction by 2011e2013 is a
consequence of a shift away from formal instruction for girls,
bringing them in line with the more limited instruction received

 by teen boys. Across both genders, many adolescents did not
receive formal instruction on specific topics until after they
became sexually active.
The declines in formal instruction about birth control iden-
tified in this study are part of a longer term trend. In 1995, 81% of
adolescent males and 87% of adolescent females reported
receiving formal instruction about birth control methods [8]; by
2011e2013, this had fallen to 55% of males and 60% of females.
Similarly, the share of teens reporting formal instruction about
“how to say no to sex” in these recent data is lower than previ-
ously estimated in the 1995 or 2002 NSFG. [8] In contrast, both
genders had significant increases in receipt of formal instruction
in saying no to sex without instruction about birth control, a
proxy measure for abstinence-only education. Even with modest
declines, 9 of 10 adolescents still report formal instruction about
STDs. This instruction is generally limited; among high schools
requiring instruction about STDs, only an average of 3.2 hours of
instruction was required and may not occur as part of a broader
sex education curriculum. [14].
These declines in formal instruction about birth control
occurred despite increases in federal funding for teen pregnancy
prevention programs and shifts in federal policy away from
abstinence-only-until-marriage
programs
toward
more
comprehensive programs since 2009 [15]. Still, a relatively small
number of youth are served by these federal programs, sug-
gesting that their overall impact would be small [16,17]. In
addition, significant funding for abstinence-only-until-marriage
programs remains. In Fiscal Year 2016, Congress provided $85
million for abstinence-until-marriage programs3 [18]. At the
state level, sex education requirements are still heavily weighted
toward stressing abstinence until marriage [19]. The increase in
abstinence-only education documented in this study shows the
continued salience of this approach to sex education, despite
criticism and concern from major public health and medical
groups [6,7].
Findings from both the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Youth Risk Behaviors Survey and their School Health
Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) generally corroborate the
findings from the NSFG. The Youth Risk Behaviors Survey shows
declines from 2001 to 2013 in the share of high school students
receiving school-based instruction about HIV/AIDS (the only
measure of school-based sex education available from this
data source) [20]. SHPPs has documented reductions from 2000
to 2014 in the share of schools requiring instruction about a
range of sexual health topics [14,21,22]. Unlike the NSFG,
however, these data sources exclude out-of-school youth and
do not permit examination of sociodemographic differences
in adolescents’ exposure to sex education across a range
of topics.
Among the sociodemographic differences of note found in this
analysisare declines informal sexeducation amongteensresiding
in nonmetropolitan areas, encompassing both genders and many
topics of instruction. (This occurred without contemporaneous
declines in parental communication among rural teens.) These
patterns are concerning as rural adolescents are a particularly
vulnerable group, with higher rates of teen childbearing, lower
rates of contraceptive use, and less access to sexual and repro-
ductive health care services than their nonrural peers [23].
With fewer resources, rural school districts may be particu-
larly vulnerable to the influence of national and state educational
policies emphasizing high-stakes testing in some subjects which
may leave reduced time and resources for other subjects such as
health education [24]. Similarly, within overall health education,
sexual health topics may be of reduced priority compared to
other topics. For example, SHPPS data show that from 2000 to
2012, declines in the share of school districts with policies about
teaching HIV or other STD prevention were paralleled by in-
creases in districts requiring instruction about other health
topics of increasing public health concern, such as suicide and
violence4 [25]. Research is needed to understand how different
subjects may compete for inclusion in the curriculum or class-
room, given limited time and other resources.
In contrast to the declines in formal sex education, the NSFG
data indicate that parents’ involvement in their teens’ sex edu-
cation have not changed over the period examined here or
compared to published estimates from the 2002 NSFG [11]. An
exception was the increase in adolescents reporting that their
parents talked with them about using condoms; it is unclear why

 this was the only topic with such increases. Parents did not fill
the gaps in education when formal instruction was lacking. In
particular, many adolescents did not receive instruction about
birth control from either source. With levels below national
public health goals and evidence that even when parental
communication occurs, its quality may be low, enhanced efforts
are needed to increase and improve parentechild communica-
tion about sexual health issues. [26].
Across both formal and informal instruction, this analysis
documented
significant
variations
by
race/ethnicity.
Non-
Hispanic black and Hispanic adolescents were generally more
likely to talk with their parents about condoms or STD/HIV
prevention than their white peers. Similarly, nonwhite teens
were more likely than others to receive formal instruction about
how to use a condom. These patterns may reflect concern with
the substantially higher rates of STDs and HIV among racial/
ethnic minority teens in the United States [27].
Also noteworthy are the differentials in formal instruction by
household poverty level, especially among young men. Com-
pounding these disparities, the share of teens residing in lower-
income households increased about 15% during the period under
study. The intersections of poverty, gender, race, and sexual health
are numerous [28]. Poor teens are more likely to live in impov-
erishedneighborhoods, with lowerschoolqualityandlessaccessto
health services, and to have higher rates of STDs, teen childbearing,
and early onset of sexual activity [29]. Improving both formal and
informalsexeducationrequiresnotonlyincreasingtheshareoflow
income teens receiving this instruction but developing approaches
that are responsive to the contexts of adolescents’ lives.
The declines in formal sex education found in this study
occurred contemporaneously with substantial declines in the
teen pregnancy and birth rates in the United States [30].
Although the underlying drivers of the recent declines in teen
pregnancy are not well understood, improvements in contra-
ceptive use have been identified as an important proximate
determinant [31]. Yet in a potential paradox, formal instruction
about birth control methods and sex education generally has
declined. A prior NSFG analysis found that health care providers
also did not fill the gaps; only 1 in 10 of sexually experienced
teens lacking birth control information from parents or schools
talked with a health care provider about birth control [32]. It is
possible that teens have turned to digital media, including the
Internet and social networking sites, for information. The
increased availability of Internet to teens, its ease of use, and
anonymity for searching sensitive or stigmatized topics make it a
likely source of sexual and reproductive health information [33].
In a 2015 national survey of teens aged 13e17 years, 92% of
American teens reported going online daily [34]. In a 2008e2009
national survey, among all 7the12th graders, more than half
(55%) say they have ever looked up health information online
[35]; we know of no recent study specifically measuring the
frequency of use of digital media for sexual and reproductive
health information. Further research is needed to document on
how and to what extent teens access and use sexual and repro-
ductive health information online, as well as evaluating the
quality of this information. Online resources are often inaccurate
and successfully navigating and evaluating competing sources of
online information can be challenging [36]. Efforts to develop the
scope and quality of online sex education may offer new op-
portunities to meet the sexual health needs of adolescents [37].
Despite these aggregate trends, individual-level analyses
using the NSFG data have found that receipt of formal sex ed-
ucation is associated with healthier sexual behaviors and out-
comes [3,4]. Evaluations of specific sex education programs,
particularly those taking a more comprehensive approach, have
also found evidence of impacts on teen pregnancy and related
sexual behaviors [1,2]. Quality sex education has as its objec-
tives much more than risk reduction and aims to promote
healthy sexual development more generally [38]. It seems un-
likely that adolescents’ nearly universal access to the Internet
means that other sources of formal and informal instruction are
no longer relevant.

 Limitations
This study has several limitations common to prior studies
using the NSFG (for a fuller discussion, see Lindberg et al.
2006 [8]). A central limitation is that the available measures of sex
education measured provide no information about the quality or
quantity of this instruction and few details about its content.
Additionally, there is no information about prevalence or changes
over time in other important sex education topics such as puberty,
dating and relationships, or sexual decision-making skills.
The NSFG provides no information on the location of the
formal instruction; the survey items ask about instruction
received in “school, church, or a community center or some other
place.” New data collection should consider how formal in-
struction outside schools may be supplementing or replacing
school-based sex education. In addition, adding survey items
that measure sources of information more broadly, including the
use of digital media, could fill a substantial gap in the literature.
