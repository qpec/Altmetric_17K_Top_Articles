Abstract
Rationale: The 2016 definitions of sepsis included the quick Sepsis-
related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score to identify high-
risk patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU).
Objectives: We sought to compare qSOFA with other commonly
used early warning scores.
Methods: All admitted patients who first met the criteria for
suspicion of infection in the emergency department (ED) or hospital
wards from November 2008 until January 2016 were included.
The qSOFA, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS),
Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the National Early
Warning Score (NEWS) were compared for predicting death and
ICU transfer.
Measurements and Main Results: Of the 30,677 included
patients, 1,649 (5.4%) died and 7,385 (24%) experienced the
composite outcome (death or ICU transfer). Sixty percent (n = 18,523)
first met the suspicion criteria in the ED. Discrimination for
in-hospital mortality was highest for NEWS (area under the curve
[AUC], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76–0.79), followed by
MEWS (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.71–0.74), qSOFA (AUC, 0.69; 95%
CI, 0.67–0.70), and SIRS (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.63–0.66) (P , 0.01
for all pairwise comparisons). Using the highest non-ICU score of
patients, >2 SIRS had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 13%
for the composite outcome compared with 54% and 67% for
qSOFA >2, 59% and 70% for MEWS >5, and 67% and 66% for
NEWS >8, respectively. Most patients met >2 SIRS criteria 17
hours before the combined outcome compared with 5 hours for >2
and 17 hours for >1 qSOFA criteria.
Conclusions: Commonly used early warning scores are more
accurate than the qSOFA score for predicting death and ICU transfer
in non-ICU patients. These results suggest that the qSOFA score
should not replace general early warning scores when risk-stratifying
patients with suspected infection.

 Sepsis contributes to up to one-half of hospital
deaths and is associated with more than $24
billion in costs in the United States annually
(1, 2). Previous consensus definitions included
the Systemic Inflammatory Response
Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which consisted of
temperature, white blood cell count, heart
rate, and respiratory rate (3, 4). However, SIRS
criteria have been criticized for their poor
specificity, with 90% of intensive care unit
(ICU) patients and 50% of general ward
patients meeting the criteria at some point
during their hospitalization (5–7). This led the
authors of the 2016 sepsis guidelines to use a
more data-driven approach to developing the
definition of sepsis (8, 9).
Because most cases of sepsis present in
the emergency department (ED) and on the
wards rather than the ICU (10), the 2016
guidelines included a new tool that was
derived specifically to prompt clinicians to
consider possible sepsis (9). This model,
called the quick Sepsis-related Organ
Failure Assessment (qSOFA), requires
derangements in systolic blood pressure,
mental status, and respiratory rate, and was
found to be more accurate than SIRS for
predicting adverse events (9). Although
supported by analyses of large data sets, the
new definitions have been criticized because
they identify patients too late in their course of
illness (11). Furthermore, qSOFA was not
compared with risk stratification tools that are
already commonly implemented in clinical
practice outside the ICU, such as the Modified
Early Warning Score (MEWS) (12) and the
National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (13).
There are substantial clinical and operational
benefits to using scores that are already in
place if they have similar performance
characteristics to novel scores. Therefore, the
aim of this study was to compare the accuracy
of qSOFA as an early warning score with
SIRS, MEWS, and NEWS in patients with
suspected infection on the wards and in the
ED for predicting adverse outcomes.
Methods
Study Population
All adult patients admitted to the University
of Chicago, an urban tertiary care medical
center with approximately 500 beds, from
November 2008 until January 2016 were
eligible for inclusion in this observational
study. Patients without vital sign or laboratory
data documented in the ED or wards were
excluded. In addition, patients who received
mechanical ventilation or vasopressor
medications before the first suspicion of
infection were excluded because a decision
support tool would not offer additional value
for these patients because they would be
admitted directly to the ICU. The protocol
was approved by the University of Chicago
Institutional Review Board (IRB #15-1705).
Data Collection
All time- and location-stamped vital signs,
laboratory, orders (e.g., blood cultures and
medications) and demographic data from the
electronic health record for all admitted
patients were collected by the University of
Chicago’s Clinical Research Data
Warehouse, de-identified, and then made
available on a secure SQL server for analysis.
Non-physiologic values were changed to
missing, as previously described (6).
Defining Infection
The definition from the original qSOFA
paper by Seymour and colleagues was used
to define the time of initial suspicion of
infection (9). Specifically, suspected
infection was defined as either (1) any
culture order followed by an intravenous
(IV) antibiotic within 72 hours or (2) an IV
antimicrobial followed by a culture order
within 24 hours. The time of the culture
order or IV antimicrobial administration
was denoted as the time of suspicion of
infection, whichever came first.
Medications were reviewed by three of the
authors (S.S., N.P., and X.H.) to exclude
prophylactic antibiotics. In addition, we
excluded oral medications from the
definition of suspicion of infection because
IV antibiotics are recommended as the
initial treatment of sepsis (14). Only
patients who first met the suspicion of
infection definition on the wards or ED
were included in the study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was
in-hospital mortality, and the secondary
outcome was the composite of death or ICU
stay at any point after a patient met the
suspicion of infection criteria. A sensitivity
analysis was performed by limiting the
patient population to patients who met
International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision, Clinical Modification criteria for
sepsis according to the criteria by Angus
and colleagues (15). A second sensitivity
analysis was performed by calculating
accuracy for presumed septic shock, as
defined by being both positive for the
criteria by Angus and colleagues and
receiving vasopressors after the time of
suspicion of infection.
Sepsis-focused Criteria and General
Early Warning Scores
The accuracy of two sepsis-focused criteria,
SIRS and qSOFA, and two general early
warning scores, MEWS and NEWS, were
investigated in this study. SIRS criteria were
defined as respiratory rate more than
20 breaths/min, temperature more than
388 C or less than 368 C, heart rate more
than 90 beats/min, and white blood cell
count more than 12,000/mm3, less than
4,000/mm3, or more than 10% bands (4).
The qSOFA criteria were defined as systolic
blood pressure <100 mm Hg, respiratory
rate >22 breaths/min, and altered mental
status (defined as either a Glasgow Coma
Scale score <13 or an Alert Voice Pain
Unresponsive scale other than “Alert”) (9).
MEWS and NEWS were calculated based
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: The quick Sepsis-related
Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA)
score is a bedside tool that was
recommended for use by the recent
Third International Consensus
Definitions Task Force to identify high-
risk patients outside of the intensive
care unit (ICU). qSOFA was found to
be more accurate than the Systemic
Inflammatory Response Syndrome
(SIRS) criteria for predicting mortality
and ICU transfer in patients outside
the ICU. However, the qSOFA score
has yet to be validated outside of the
original publication and has not been
compared with early warning scores
already in widespread use.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: We found that commonly used
early warning scores are more accurate
than the qSOFA score for predicting
in-hospital mortality and ICU transfer
among patients with suspected
infection outside the ICU. These results
suggest that the qSOFA score should
not replace previously developed early
warning scores already in use across
the United States and Europe.

 on previously published tables (12, 13). Of
note, our hospital has been collecting
Glasgow Coma Scale data on ward patients
since 2011, and before that period the
components of Alert Voice Pain
Unresponsive scale were documented.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were compared
between those who first met the suspicion of
infection definition on the wards versus ED
using t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and
x2 tests as necessary based on the
distribution of the data. The highest value
of each algorithm was calculated from the
same contiguous non-ICU location
segment (i.e., ED and ward) as when a
patient first met the suspicion of the
infection definition. Previous values were
pulled forward if they were missing, and if
no previous values were available, a median
(normal) value was imputed, as per
previous studies (9, 16, 17). Accuracy
comparisons were performed using
sensitivity, specificity, and the area under
the receiver-operating characteristic curve
was used to compare algorithm
discrimination. A two-tailed P , 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Analyses
were performed using Stata (version 14.1;
StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Study Population
A total of 445,073 patient records were
available during the study period, of which
150,288 admissions occurred that had vital
signs or laboratory values documented in
the ED or wards and were eligible for
inclusion in the study. Of these patients,
59,078 (39%) had at least one culture order,
and 54,367 (36%) received at least one dose
of IV antibiotics (see Figure E1 in the
online supplement). The final study cohort
consisted of 30,677 patients who met the
definition of suspicion of infection outside
the ICU, with both antibiotics and cultures
within the predefined time window. Sixty
percent (n = 18,523) first met this
definition in the ED and 40% (n = 12,154)
first met the definition on the wards.
Compared with patients with first
suspicion of infection in the wards, ED
patients were more likely to be female
(55% vs. 48%; P , 0.001), black (73% vs.
36%; P , 0.001), meet the Angus sepsis
criteria (29% vs. 28%; P , 0.01), and
be admitted to the ICU at any point
during their hospitalization (26% vs.
20%; P , 0.01). In addition, patients who
first met suspicion criteria on the wards
had higher in-hospital mortality (6% vs.
5%; P , 0.01) and length of stay after
suspicion of infection (8.3 days vs. 6.8
days; P , 0.01) (Table 1). A total of 1,649

 (5.4%) patients died, and 7,120 (23.2%)
experienced an ICU stay after meeting
suspicion of infection criteria. For those who
experienced the composite outcome (death
or ICU stay; n = 7,385), the median
time to the outcome after time of first
suspicion of infection was 14 hours
(interquartile range, 6–66 h), and 71% of
patients who experienced the composite
outcome did so within 48 hours.
Score Distributions
Distributions of the highest SIRS criteria,
qSOFA criteria, MEWS, and NEWS during
the same contiguous non-ICU segment
when a patient met suspicion of infection
criteria are shown in Figures E2 to E5.
Eighty-eight percent (n = 27,097) of patients
met at least two SIRS criteria, and 38%
(n = 11,729) met at least two qSOFA
criteria during this time period. At the time
of suspicion of infection, 51% of patients
had met >2 SIRS, 9% had met >2, and
48% had met >1 qSOFA criteria at least
once. The most common initial >2 qSOFA
combination met by this time point was
respiratory and blood pressure criteria in
5,016 (42.8%) patients, followed by
respiratory rate and mental status criteria in
3,249 (27.7%) patients, blood pressure and
mental status criteria in 1,993 (17.0%)
patients, and all three criteria in 1,471
(12.5%) patients.
Accuracy Comparisons
Using each patient’s highest score during
their non-ICU stay, algorithm discrimination
for in-hospital mortality in all non-ICU
patients was highest for NEWS (area
under the curve [AUC], 0.77; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.76–0.79]),
followed by MEWS (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.71–0.74), the qSOFA score (AUC, 0.69;
95% CI, 0.67–0.70), and lowest for SIRS
(AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.63–0.66) (P , 0.01
for all pairwise comparisons). The relationship
among the scores was consistent
when comparing the ward and ED
subgroups, with the AUCs being slightly
lower on the wards (Figure 1).
Furthermore, AUCs were similar but
slightly lower for the composite outcome
(see Figure E6). Using a patient’s highest
non-ICU score, NEWS >9 had a 72%
sensitivity for in-hospital mortality
compared with 71% for MEWS >5, 69%
for qSOFA >2, and 94% for >2 SIRS
(Table 2). Positive and negative predictive
values at different thresholds for each
score are found in Table E1 in the online
supplement. Using the NEWS at a cutoff
>9 would correctly reclassify 3% of
patients who died and 9% of patients who
did not die compared with using qSOFA >2.
Furthermore, NEWS >8 would correctly
reclassify 13% of patients who died or
were transferred to the ICU compared
with qSOFA >2 at a similar specificity.
MEWS >5 would correctly reclassify 5%
of patients who died or were transferred
to the ICU and 3% of patients who did
not experience the composite outcome
compared with qSOFA >2. Figures E7
and E8 show the percentage of positive
screens in the study population as
a function of sensitivity for each of the
four tools for each outcome, which
demonstrates the relative efficiency of
NEWS and lack of efficiency for SIRS
across the continuum.
Using a patient’s highest score up until
the time of first suspicion of infection, >9
NEWS had a sensitivity of 18% for the
combined outcome in all non-ICU patients
compared with 26% for >5 MEWS, 17%
for >2 qSOFA, 65% for >1 qSOFA, and
62% for >2 SIRS. Most patients met SIRS
criteria 17 hours before ICU transfer or
death, compared with 12 hours for NEWS
>7, and 5 hours for >2 and 17 hours for
>1 qSOFA criteria (Figure 2).

 Sensitivity Analyses
The ranking of the scores was similar in the
cohort of patients who met the Angus
International Classification of Diseases, 9th
edition criteria for sepsis (n = 8,744), with
AUCs for in-hospital mortality of 0.71
(95% CI, 0.69–0.72) for NEWS, 0.66 (95%
CI, 0.64–0.68) for MEWS, 0.63 (95% CI,
0.61–0.64) for qSOFA, and 0.60 (95% CI,
0.58–0.62) for SIRS (P , 0.01 for all
pairwise comparisons). In this population,
NEWS >7 had a sensitivity of 82% for the
composite outcome compared with a
sensitivity of 63% for qSOFA >2 and
93% for >2 SIRS criteria. Accuracy was
higher for the subset of patients who
also received vasopressor drugs after the
onset of infection, with a sensitivity of
87% for NEWS >7, 70% for >2 qSOFA,
and 93% for >2 SIRS criteria for the
composite outcome.
Discussion
In this observational cohort study, we
found that although qSOFA was more
accurate than SIRS for predicting in-
hospital mortality and ICU transfer in
both ward and ED patients, it was less
accurate than the general early warning
scores. NEWS was the most accurate tool
for predicting adverse outcomes in both
ED and ward patients. This is important
because early warning scores such as the
MEWS are in widespread use in Europe
and the United States, and the NEWS is now
mandated in the United Kingdom as a tool
to identify patients outside the ICU at high
risk of clinical deterioration (13, 18–20).
The SIRS criteria have been part of the
sepsis definition for more than two
decades, and have been criticized in the
literature for almost as long (3, 5). In
particular, they have been shown to have
poor specificity, with up to 90% of ICU
patients and almost one-half of ward
patients meeting at least two of four
criteria at some point in their stay (6, 7).
These findings and others led to the recent
update of the sepsis definitions in 2016 by
the Society of Critical Care Medicine/
European Society of Intensive Care
Medicine task force (8). The qSOFA score
was published with these updated sepsis
definitions as a tool that could be used
outside the ICU to prompt clinicians to
consider possible sepsis (9). Although the
new sepsis definitions were endorsed by
several societies, other societies, including
Chest and the American College of
Emergency Physicians, did not endorse
them (11). One criticism of these new
criteria has been that they will identify
patients too late in their course, after organ
dysfunction has already occurred (11).
Furthermore, some authors have
questioned the use of qSOFA as a clinical
decision tool because of how it was
developed (21).
We found that less than one in five
patients who later go on to die or be
transferred to the ICU will have met >2
qSOFA criteria by the time of infection
suspicion, which illustrates the importance
of score recalculation after the initiation of
therapy. Furthermore, most patients who
experienced the composite outcome met
>2 SIRS criteria more than 17 hours
before the composite outcome compared
with only 5 hours for >2 qSOFA, with
almost one-half of patients still not
meeting >2 qSOFA criteria at the time of
the outcome. The previous paradigm using
SIRS favored higher sensitivity at the cost
of specificity, whereas using a qSOFA
score cutoff of >2 increased specificity at
the cost of sensitivity. Interestingly, we
found that using >1 qSOFA criteria had
similar accuracy and timing compared with
>2 SIRS criteria, which suggests that this
lower threshold could be used if an earlier and
more sensitive cutoff were desired.
Our study found that general early
warning scores are more accurate than
qSOFA for predicting adverse outcomes in
the ED and on the wards. The MEWS, and
its derivatives, such as the NEWS, which
was endorsed by the Royal College of
Physicians for standard use across the
United Kingdom, are already used in
many hospitals for Rapid Response
System activation (13, 18, 19). We found
NEWS to be the most accurate score we
studied. qSOFA has the advantage of
simplicity, and errors in manually
calculating general early warning scores
have been described (22). However, the
NEWS and MEWS offer several more
thresholds to vary sensitivity and
specificity to resource availability. In
addition, these early warning scores are
increasingly becoming available for
automated calculation within the electronic
health record. Furthermore, data suggest
that general early warning scores such as
MEWS and the electronic Cardiac Arrest
Risk Triage model add useful predictive
information to clinical judgment (23–25).
Currently, it is unknown whether using >2
qSOFA criteria, which would identify a
patient with both mental status changes and
hypotension as a patient to pay more
attention to, offers additional value above
caregiver intuition. Overall, our study
provides evidence that hospitals already
using the NEWS or MEWS would not
benefit from switching to qSOFA for use as
an early warning score because of the costs

 and risks of retraining caregivers to use a
new scoring system.
Our study had several limitations.
First, this was a single-center investigation
in an academic U.S. hospital; therefore, the
results may not be generalizable to other
settings. In addition, there is no gold
standard to determine when a patient is
infected, so we might have excluded
patients who were infected and included
others who were not. However, we used the
same definition as the original qSOFA
study and also included only IV
medications, which should improve the
validity of our results. Finally, we only
studied 2 of the more than 100 published
early warning scores in the literature (26).
Because most of these scores are similar to
the MEWS and NEWS, and these are two
of the most highly cited scores in common
use, we believed that these results would be
of value for clinicians.
In conclusion, we found that general
early warning scores were more accurate
than the qSOFA score for predicting in-
hospital mortality and ICU transfer in
non-ICU patients with suspicion of
infection, with the NEWS being the most
accurate score in our study. These
findings have important implications for
clinicians at the bedside, hospitals, and
countries implementing these scoring
systems in practice. n
