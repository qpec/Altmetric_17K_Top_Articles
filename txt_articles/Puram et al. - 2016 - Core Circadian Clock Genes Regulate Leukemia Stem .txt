SUMMARY
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have the capacity to
self-renew and propagate disease upon serial trans-
plantation in animal models, and elimination of this
cell population is required for curative therapies.
Here, we describe a series of pooled, in vivo RNAi
screens to identify essential transcription factors
(TFs) in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with genetically and phenotypically defined
LSCs. These screens reveal the heterodimeric,
circadian rhythm TFs Clock and Bmal1 as genes
required for the growth of AML cells in vitro and
in vivo. Disruption of canonical circadian path-
way components produces anti-leukemic effects,
including impaired proliferation, enhanced myeloid
differentiation, and depletion of LSCs. We find that
both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells har-
bor an intact clock with robust circadian oscillations,
and genetic knockout models reveal a leukemia-
specific dependence on the pathway. Our findings
establish a role for the core circadian clock genes
in AML.
INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder of hemato-
poietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) characterized by
enhanced proliferation and impaired differentiation. Recurrent
mutations in transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic regulators
identified in AML (Do
¨ hner et al., 2015; Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2013) suggest that aberrant transcriptional
circuits are a common feature of leukemogenesis. Collectively,
these circuits drive oncogenic gene expression programs that
inhibit differentiation and activate self-renewal, generating leu-
kemia stem cells (LSCs) responsible for the initiation and propa-
gation of disease (Chao et al., 2008; Reya et al., 2001; Somer-
vaille and Cleary, 2006).
In leukemias with rearrangements of the Mixed Lineage
Leukemia (MLL) gene, activation of a self-renewal circuit
involving the Hox gene cluster is a key aspect in the transforma-
tion of committed myeloid progenitor cells (Krivtsov et al., 2009).
Studies have identified multiple transcription factor depen-
dencies within this circuitry, including HoxA9, Meis1, b-catenin,
Myc, and Myb, demonstrating that re-wired transcriptional cir-
cuits in LSCs may be targeted by blocking the activity of single
TFs (Faber et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2007;
Zuber et al., 2011a). Although both LSCs and normal hematopoi-
etic stem cells (HSCs) share the hallmark feature of self-renewal,
differences in their transcriptional wiring and the degree of
functional redundancy within their stemness circuits may offer
selective therapeutic opportunities (Huntly and Gilliland, 2005;
Novershtern et al., 2011).
Recent studies demonstrate that leukemia-specific targets
may be identified using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens to
interrogate multiple genes in primary AML cells in vivo (Ja
¨ ra
˚ s
et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; Zuber et al., 2011b). These
screens employ disease models that reflect the phenotypic
and functional cellular heterogeneity observed in human AML
(Lapidot et al., 1994) and aim to study leukemia cells in the
context of the niche (Lane et al., 2009; Schepers et al., 2015).
In vivo screening using primary cell models enables the identifi-
cation of both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mech-
anisms relevant to disease biology. We, therefore, used pooled,
in vivo shRNA screening to identify transcription factor depen-
dencies in leukemia stem cells.
RESULTS
Pooled In Vivo RNA Interference Screening in LSCs
To identify essential TFs in leukemia and to highlight transcrip-
tional mechanisms of self-renewal in LSCs, we performed an

 in vivo RNAi screen using a serial transplantation model of MLL-
AF9-driven, myelomonocytic AML derived from dsRed+ mice
(Figure S1A). LSCs in this model are aggressive, immunopheno-
typically defined, and may be enriched by prospectively sorting
dsRed-labeled cells with high expression of the c-Kit cell surface
marker (Hartwell et al., 2013) (Figure S1B). The short-latency,
high penetrance quaternary transplant leukemias are highly
enriched for LSCs and are suitable for in vivo screening (Miller
et al., 2013).
Given the limited number of genes that can be effectively
examined in such an in vivo screen, we first identified candi-
date TFs on the basis of gene expression (Bullinger et al.,
2004; Chen et al., 2008; Krivtsov et al., 2009; Metzeler et al.,
2008; Novershtern et al., 2011; Somervaille et al., 2009; Valk
et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2010). We selected DNA-binding pro-
teins that have higher expression in stem cells (LSCs or HSCs)
compared to myeloid progenitor cells and are co-expressed
with the canonical LSC regulators HoxA9 and Meis1. The top
152 genes, based on this analysis, were selected for the screen
(Table S1A).
To test the functional importance of these candidate genes,
we generated a custom pool of 770 lentiviral shRNAs (approxi-
mately five shRNAs per gene) and seven control shRNAs that
lack complementarity with any known murine genes. Freshly
sorted quaternary transplant leukemia cells were transduced
with six subpools of lentiviral shRNAs. An aliquot of these cells
was banked 24 hr later, and the remainder was transplanted to
sublethally irradiated mice (five replicate mice per subpool).
Two weeks after transplantation, leukemia cells were banked
from the bone marrow of moribund recipient mice (Figure S1C).
Genomic DNA was harvested from both banks of cells and
shRNAs were PCR amplified and sequenced on the Illumina
platform (Moffat et al., 2006).
We compared the quantitative representation of shRNAs in
the input and leukemic bone marrow samples and observed
strong concordance between biological replicates (Figures 1A
and S1D). We identified 35 transcriptional regulators targeted
by at least three shRNAs depleted >20-fold (Table S1B), indi-
cating that these genes are essential for AML cells in vivo. Top
hits from the screen are established regulators of LSC function,
including HoxA9, Meis1, b-catenin, Pbx1, and Myc (Figure 1B).
Other genes that scored are implicated in myeloid specification
(PU.1), Myc activity (Mlxip), PML bodies (Pml, Mzf1, Trim27,
Rere), Mef2c signaling (Mef2c, Foxj3), and the circadian rhythm
(Clock and Bmal1). For key hits, we validated that top scoring
shRNAs effectively decrease expression of their target gene
(Figure S1E).
Clock and Bmal1 Are Required for Leukemia Cell Growth
Two hits from our in vivo screen were Clock and Bmal1, encod-
ing basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing TFs that
regulate transcription as a heterodimer (Huang et al., 2012).
Multiple shRNAs targeting Clock or Bmal1 were depleted
>20-fold in vivo, with several shRNAs depleted up to 1,000-
fold (Figure 1B). Clock and Bmal1, and their Period (Per1,
Per2, Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1, Cry2) target genes, are
core components of a transcriptional-translational feedback
loop that drives rhythmic gene expression to regulate circadian
physiology (Partch et al., 2014; Wager-Smith and Kay, 2000).
Following activation of Per and Cry gene expression, Per:Cry
heterodimers feedback repress Clock:Bmal1 activity, resulting
in an autoregulatory loop that is completed in approximately
24 hr. In the hematopoietic system, the circadian clock regu-
lates HSC egress from the bone marrow microenvironment
(Me
´ ndez-Ferrer
et
al.,
2008),
hematopoietic
engraftment
(D’Hondt et al., 2004; Rolls et al., 2015), and bone marrow
mitotic activity (Clark and Korst, 1969; Smaaland et al., 1991).
Cell
autonomous
and
cell
non-autonomous
functions
of
the circadian rhythm in leukemia have not been rigorously
established.
We validated a role for Clock and Bmal1 in leukemia in vivo
with shRNAs co-expressed with GFP from single lentiviral vec-
tors. We transduced murine MLL-AF9 leukemia cells with indi-
vidual shRNAs, transplanted the cells to sublethally irradiated
recipient mice, and compared the percentage of GFP+ leuke-
mia cells before transplant and after 2 weeks in vivo. GFP+ cells
expressing Clock or Bmal1 shRNAs were strongly depleted
in vivo, while cells expressing the luciferase (Luc) control
shRNA were stable over time (Figure 1C). To evaluate whether
this effect is independent of the bone marrow microenviron-
ment or cell engraftment, we performed an equivalent experi-
ment in vitro with cytokine supplementation (IL3, IL6, and
SCF). Similar to the phenotype in vivo, GFP+ cells were
depleted over 12 days in culture following transduction with
Clock
or
Bmal1
shRNAs
but
not
with
the
Luc
control
(Figure 1D).
To account for possible off-target effects of the shRNAs, we
performed a cDNA rescue experiment. We generated a retro-
viral vector that co-expresses GFP and a mutant Bmal1
cDNA with silent point mutations in the shRNA binding sites.
We sequentially transduced murine leukemia cells with the
rescue vector and Bmal1 shRNAs, followed by puromycin se-
lection of shRNA-expressing cells. In this experiment, an in-
crease in the percentage of GFP+ cells reflects selection for
the shRNA-resistant Bmal1 cDNA and confirms on-target ef-
fects. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in the GFP+
fraction in vitro for two Bmal1 shRNAs (A1, A6) normalized to
the Luc control (Figure 1E).
As an added confirmation of specificity, we used CRISPR-
Cas9-based genome editing to introduce loss-of-function
mutations in the Bmal1 gene in primary murine leukemia cells.
We transduced quaternary transplant MLL-AF9 cells with
lentiviral SFFV-driven Cas9 followed by puromycin selection
of cells with stable Cas9 expression (Heckl et al., 2014).
Leukemia cells were then transduced with a separate lenti-
viral vector that co-expresses RFP657 and a single guide
RNA (sgRNA) targeting luciferase, Bmal1, or HoxA9 as a
positive control. Consistent with the shRNA results, an sgRNA
targeting Bmal1 was progressively depleted (Figures 1F, 1G,
and S1F).
These data demonstrate that Bmal1 and its heterodimeric
partner Clock are functionally required for LSCs. Accordingly,
we found that Bmal1 expression is induced by MLL-AF9 (Fig-
ure S1G) and is correlated with c-Kit, a marker of LSCs in our
serial transplantation model of AML (Figures 2A, S2A, and
S2B; Table S2).

 Circadian Disruption Induces Myeloid Differentiation
and Impaired Cell-Cycle Progression
We next examined the consequences of acute disruption of the
circadian rhythm in AML using a small molecule. SR9011 is a
potent and specific agonist of the nuclear hormone receptors
Rev-Erb a and Rev-Erb b, which inhibit Bmal1 transcription via
a feedback loop (Burris et al., 2013; Solt et al., 2012). Treatment

in vitro resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in cell viability (EC50 = 1.8 mM)
(Figure 2B). In agreement with known
roles of Rev-Erb a and Rev-Erb b within
the circadian pathway, short duration
treatment of leukemia cells with the drug
resulted
in
decreased
expression
of
Bmal1 and its target gene Per2 (Fig-

dependent suppression of key regulators
of

self-renewal
(HoxA9,

rhythm
circuitry
influences
functions
related to stemness (Figure 2D).
Consistent with these observations, we
found that Clock or Bmal1 shRNAs in leu-
kemia cells induce morphologic changes of monocytic differen-
tiation, including decreased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (Fig-
ure 2E). Using flow cytometry, we observed reduced cell
surface expression of stem cell marker, c-Kit, and increased
expression of myeloid differentiation markers, CD11b and Gr1
(Figures 2F, 2G, and S2C). Additionally, leukemia differentia-
tion following circadian gene knockdown is associated with a
reduction in the percentage of actively dividing cells (S/G2/M)

Murine Leukemia Cells Harbor a Functional Circadian
Clock
Our finding that AML cells are dependent on Clock and Bmal1
expression implies that leukemia cells, and perhaps their normal
hematopoietic counterparts, harbor an intact circadian clock
that regulates rhythmic gene expression. To test this possibility
in primary murine leukemia cells, we used circadian reporter
mice with an in-frame knockin of luciferase at the 30 end of the
Per2 gene (Yoo et al., 2004). We generated primary MLL-AF9
leukemias in the Per2::Luc genetic background, transplanted
these leukemias to wild-type (WT) recipients entrained to a
12 hr light/12 hr dark (LD12:12) schedule, and followed the
mice for 4 to 6 weeks for the development of disease (Figures
S2E and S2F). Continuous bioluminescence recordings of
leukemic spleen explants from moribund mice revealed oscilla-
tions with a period of �24 hr (Figure 3A). Thus, murine leukemia
cells have the capacity for circadian-dependent gene expression
independent of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the domi-
nant circadian pacemaker in the CNS. Additionally, continuous
bioluminescence measurements of purified Per2::Luc MLL-AF9
bone marrow cells suspended in liquid culture with cytokines
confirmed that these rhythms are not dependent on an intact
stromal microenvironment (Figure S2G).
Canonical Circadian Machinery Operates in Human
AML Cells
We next examined whether the circadian circuitry is intact in hu-
man AML, as it is in murine leukemia. We found that MLL-WT
(SKM-1) and MLL-rearranged (THP-1) leukemia cell lines are
highly sensitive to CLOCK and BMAL1 knockdown using multi-
ple shRNAs (Figures 3B, S2H, and S2I). In THP-1 cells, reciprocal
co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a physical asso-
ciation between CLOCK and BMAL1, as would be expected
for cells with an intact circadian mechanism (Figure 3C).
To define a set of CLOCK:BMAL1 targets in human AML, we
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-
seq) for both TFs. We called peaks individually for CLOCK (269
peaks) and BMAL1 (9,584 peaks) in THP-1 cells and defined a
high-confidence set of 140 regions associated with 229 genes
bound by both factors (Figure S2J; Table S3A). Pathway analysis
revealed that CLOCK:BMAL1 targets are significantly enriched
for genes involved in the circadian rhythm (‘‘Circadian Rhythm-
Mammal’’; MSigDB; Hyper FDR 2.09E-8), including BHLHE40/
41, CRY1/2, NR1D1, PER1/2, and DBP (Figure 3D; Table S3B).
Gene ontology (GO) analysis demonstrated that high-confidence
loci are involved in diverse cellular processes, including meta-
bolism, differentiation, immune function, cell-cycle regulation,
and proliferation, as reported in other tissue types (Miller et al.,
2007; Richards and Gumz, 2012) (Figure 3E). In addition, we
found CLOCK:BMAL1 binding to Wnt/b-Catenin pathway genes
(WNT11, FZD3, WISP1, CSNK2A3) and several genes associ-
ated with cancer (HRAS, CEBPA, ZEB1, EGLN2). E-Box sites
are among the most enriched motifs in the high-confidence
binding regions, consistent with the known specificity of these
TFs (Weirauch et al., 2014) (Figure 3F; Table S3C).
Identification of Additional Circadian Regulators in
Leukemia Cells
Given evidence for binding of CLOCK:BMAL1 to multiple
conserved circadian rhythm genes in human AML cells, we hy-
pothesized that additional components of the pathway are
required for LSC function. We evaluated this possibility by per-
forming an in vivo minipool screen in murine MLL-AF9 cells
with shRNAs targeting 22 genes in the canonical circadian
pathway, including Clock and Bmal1 and several key regulators.
This screen confirmed a role for Clock:Bmal1 and highlighted
additional pathway genes (Per1/3, Cry1, Csnk1e/2a1/2b), raising
the possibility that both positive and negative elements of the
circadian transcriptional-translational feedback loop impact
LSC function (Figure 3G; Table S4). Interestingly, a subset of
the hits from this screen (Per1, Cry1) are directly bound by the
Clock:Bmal1 complex and may represent essential mediators
of Clock and Bmal1 activity in AML (Figure 3G).
Role of the Circadian Rhythm Pathway in Normal
Hematopoiesis
Having established a functional requirement for Clock and Bmal1
in leukemia, we next examined their roles in normal hematopoi-
esis. Continuous bioluminescence studies with spleen explants
from healthy Per2::Luc knockin mice entrained to LD12:12 re-
vealed persistent oscillations with a period of �24 hr (Figure 4A).
The circadian activity observed in these mice could reflect either
rhythms in hematopoietic cells or oscillations in extra-hemato-
poietic cells within the spleen. We thus performed bone marrow
transplantation experiments to study the rhythm specifically in
HSPCs and their progeny. We harvested bone marrow from
healthy Per2::Luc mice and transplanted c-Kit-enriched cells to
lethally irradiated WT recipients. Continuous bioluminescence
recordings of spleen explants from these mice revealed robust
rhythms with a period of �24 hr (Figure 4B).
The presence of an intact clock in normal hematopoietic cells,
in conjunction with evidence that Clock and Bmal1 are more
highly expressed in HSPCs compared to differentiated cells (Fig-
ures 4C and 4D), raises the possibility that the circadian rhythm
impacts HSC function. We sought to determine the effect of
circadian gene disruption on normal hematopoiesis using germ-
line Bmal1 knockout mice that lack a functional circadian clock in
all tissues, including the SCN (Bunger et al., 2000). These mice
display premature death, infertility, organ shrinkage, age-related
pathologies such as cataracts, and increased reactive oxygen
species, indicating that Bmal1 may be required for normal tissue
stem cell homeostasis (Alvarez et al., 2008; Kondratov et al.,
2006; Kondratov et al., 2009).
We used multi-parameter flow cytometry (Figures S3A–S3D) to
assess Bmal1�/� mice (Figure S4A) for defects in hematopoietic
function and/or differentiation. We first gated lineage�, Scal+,
c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, with further separation based on the SLAM
markers CD48 and CD150, to examine the stem cell compartment
in these mice (Kiel et al., 2005). We identified a significant reduc-
tion in the percentage of both LSK cells and long-term HSCs
(LT-HSCs) in Bmal1�/� animals compared to age-matched
Bmal1+/� controls (Figures 4E–4G; Table S5). However, we did
not observe a corresponding reduction in the frequency of mature
myeloid or lymphoid cells in the bone marrow or spleens of
Cell 165, 303–316, April 7, 2016

 Bmal1�/� mice, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms (Fig-
ures 4H and S4B). Similarly, an evaluation of committed myeloid
progenitor cells within the lineage�, c-Kit+ (LK) fraction did not
reveal significant abnormalities in the common myeloid progenitor
(CMP), granulocyte monocyte progenitor (GMP), or megakaryo-
cyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) populations (Figure 4I; Table S5).
Because germline Bmal1�/� mice have disrupted central
pacemaker function, globally altered molecular and behavioral
rhythms, and diverse tissue phenotypes, the stem cell finding
in these mice may be related to either cell autonomous or cell
non-autonomous effects. Consequently, we sought to highlight
cell intrinsic mechanisms by inactivating Bmal1 in adult hemato-
poiesis with preservation of the circadian rhythm in the SCN and
non-hematopoietic peripheral tissues.
We examined the role of Bmal1 in hematopoietic cells in
competitive repopulation assays using conditional knockout
mice in which LoxP sites flank the critical bHLH domain of
Bmal1 (Storch et al., 2007). We mixed WT cells expressing
CD45.1 with equal numbers of either Bmal1f/f; MxCre+ or
Bmal1+/+; MxCre+ cells marked by CD45.2 and transplanted
the mix to lethally irradiated CD45.1+ recipient mice. Following
engraftment, we treated the full cohort of mice with polyino-
sinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), inducing Cre expression and
Bmal1 inactivation in Bmal1f/f; MxCre+ hematopoietic cells. We
serially measured the peripheral blood CD45.2 chimerism by
flow cytometry over 24 weeks in vivo and did not identify signif-
icant abnormalities in repopulating ability or multi-lineage differ-
entiation of Bmal1 knockout HSPCs compared to control HSPCs
(Figures 4J and S4C–S4F). Importantly, we did not detect differ-
ences in the frequencies of CD45.2-derived LSK cells or LT-
HSCs between the two groups, and no significant hematopoietic
phenotypes were observed with secondary transplantation (Fig-
ures 4K, 4L, S4G, and S4H).
Consistent with these data, we found that normal murine LSK
cells are resistant to Bmal1 knockdown with multiple shRNAs
(Figure S4I). In addition, analyses of non-competitive Bmalf/f;
MxCre+ mice and germline Per2 mutant (Per2m/m) mice (Zheng
et al., 1999) did not reveal gross hematopoietic deficits (Figures
S5A–S5I). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that loss of
Bmal1 (or Per2) in adult hematopoiesis is well tolerated.
Genetic Knockout Confirms a Leukemia-Specific
Dependence on Bmal1
We used the Bmal1 conditional knockout model to evaluate the
phenotypic consequences of complete loss of Bmal1 activity on
leukemia maintenance. We generated murine MLL-AF9 leuke-
mias in the Bmal1f/f background and retrovirally transduced the
cells with PIG-Cre, resulting in efficient excision (Figure 5A).
Consistent with our shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 results, homozy-
gous Bmal1 loss resulted in an in vitro leukemia growth defect
compared to the Bmal1+/+ control (Figure 5A).
We next evaluated the effect of Bmal1 inactivation on the initi-
ation and propagation of MLL-AF9 leukemia. We treated
Bmal1f/f; MxCre+ or Bmal1+/+; MxCre+ animals with poly(I:C),
harvested bone marrow from these mice, and confirmed exci-
sion (Figure S5J). C-Kit-enriched cells from both groups of
mice were retrovirally transduced with MIG-MLL-AF9 and trans-
planted to lethally irradiated WT recipients. Although we did not
observe differences in leukemia latency or overall survival be-
tween the primary transplant groups, secondary recipient mice
receiving Bmal1�/� MLL-AF9 cells lived significantly longer
than mice receiving Bmal1+/+ MLL-AF9 cells (Figure 5B). Thus,
Bmal1 is required for disease propagation.
Given these findings, in conjunction with the HSC knockout
studies, we reasoned that AML cells may be differentially sensi-
tive to circadian disruption with the Rev-Erb a/b agonist SR9011.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the viability of quaternary
transplant MLL-AF9 cells and normal murine LSK cells following
treatment with SR9011 for 3 days in vitro. We found that murine
leukemia cells are more sensitive than HSPCs to various concen-
trations of drug (Figure 5C). Similarly, SR9011 had greater activ-
ity in human AML cell lines (NOMO-1 and MOLM-13) compared
to CD34+ cord blood cells purified from healthy donors (Fig-
ure 5D). These data indicate that myeloid leukemia cells, in
contrast to normal hematopoietic cells, are highly sensitive to
circadian pathway perturbation.
Finally, we interrogated genomic data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine if central circadian compo-
nents (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER2) are somatically disrupted in hu-
man AML (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013). In
the 191 cases in the TCGA AML dataset, we did not identify mu-
tations or homozygous deletions in CLOCK, BMAL1, or PER2
(Figure S5K), indicating that key components of the circadian cir-
cuitry are intact in AML.
DISCUSSION
Cell non-autonomous roles for the circadian rhythm in hemato-
poiesis are well established (Casanova-Acebes et al., 2013; Lu-
cas et al., 2008; Me
´ ndez-Ferrer et al., 2008, 2010; Nguyen et al.,

 2013). Our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized role
for the core circadian clock genes in AML. We found that disrup-
tion of the circadian circuitry, mediated by shRNA knockdown,
targeted mutation, or genetic deletion of key TFs, impairs the
growth of murine leukemia cells in vivo and human cell lines
in vitro.
We evaluated the cellular mechanisms of leukemia depletion
and found that circadian perturbation induces myeloid differen-
tiation, including a reduction in cell surface expression of c-Kit,
a marker of LSCs. Using the Rev-Erb a/b small molecule agonist
SR9011, we identified a dose-dependent transcriptional down-
regulation of HoxA9, Meis1, and Ctnnb1; together, these self-
renewal TFs cooperate to induce myeloid leukemia in mice and
are broadly required in multiple AML models (Heidel et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2010). Similarly, in the skin, the circadian clock
regulates the expression of stem cell self-renewal genes,
including those in the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, and loss of
Bmal1 results in stem cell arrhythmia in squamous cell tumors
(Janich et al., 2011). Thus, links between the circadian rhythm
and self-renewal pathways may be conserved in multiple tissue
contexts.
We also found that Clock and Bmal1 regulate cellular prolifer-
ation and cell-cycle progression in AML cells, consistent with
phenotypes reported in other systems (Gre
´ chez-Cassiau et al.,
2008; Matsuo et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2007). Although some
studies indicate that specific clock genes may act as tumor sup-
pressors (Fu et al., 2002), other studies suggest a more complex
relationship between the circadian rhythm and cancer (Antoch
et al., 2013). Our finding that AML cells require Clock and
Bmal1 expression reinforces recent work demonstrating tu-
mor-maintaining roles for the core circadian rhythm genes in a
variety of cancers (Antoch et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2015; Elshazley
et al., 2012; Janich et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Ozturk et al., 2009;
Xiao et al., 2014).
Furthermore, targets and binding partners of CLOCK and
BMAL1 are relevant to the biology and survival of AML cells. A
previous study demonstrated that CLOCK and BMAL1 form a
complex with wild-type MLL1, a histone methyltransferase
required for MLL-AF9 leukemia (Katada and Sassone-Corsi,
2010; Thiel et al., 2010). This association results in cyclical
H3K4 trimethylation, establishing a permissive chromatin state
for genome-scale circadian transcription (Koike et al., 2012). If
the critical interaction domain of MLL1 is preserved in MLL
fusions, CLOCK and BMAL1 may physically bind the MLL-AF9
complex and target it to genomic loci required for leukemia sur-
vival (Bernt et al., 2011).
A critical feature of the circadian rhythm is oscillating gene
expression in both the SCN as well as peripheral tissues. Periph-
eral circadian rhythms are cell-autonomous and occur in the
absence of external input (Ko and Takahashi, 2006). Using
Per2::Luc knockin mice, we confirmed that MLL-AF9 leukemia
cells have the capacity for rhythmic gene expression. Contin-
uous bioluminescence recordings of leukemic tissue explants
cultured in isolation demonstrated oscillations with a period of
�24 hr, indicating the presence of an intact clock in primary
AML cells. Rhythms were maintained with serial transplantation,
and remarkably, were present in moribund mice with advanced
hematologic disease.
Consistent with cyclical gene expression patterns, canonical
circadian regulatory mechanisms are preserved in leukemia.
ChIP-seq studies demonstrated that the CLOCK:BMAL1 com-
plex binds to multiple known circadian pathway genes, and
binding occurrs with specificity to E-box regulatory elements
(Yu et al., 2006). The MYC:MAX complex also has specificity
for E-box motifs, indicating that MYC targets may display circa-
dian-dependent regulation and contribute to cancer pheno-
types. Given diverse outputs of the peripheral clock in most
tissues, it is likely that a set of targets, rather than a single
gene, modulates LSC function.
Although rhythmic, circadian-dependent gene expression was
present in both normal cells and in leukemia, murine genetic
knockout studies indicate that Bmal1 is not absolutely required
for normal hematopoietic function. Interestingly, in the setting
of germline loss of Bmal1, we observed a reduction in the fre-
quency of LSK cells and LT-HSCs. Despite altered stem cell
numbers, mature myeloid and lymphoid cells in both the bone
marrow and spleen were grossly normal and recent work indi-
cates that HSCs from these mice have preserved function
(Ieyasu et al., 2014). Additionally, we found that selective loss
of Bmal1 in adult hematopoiesis does not significantly alter
HSPC differentiation or multi-lineage repopulating activity in
competitive transplantation assays.
In contrast to normal cells, leukemia cells in the MLL-AF9
model depend on Bmal1 expression. Genetic deletion of
Bmal1 in established leukemias results in a competitive disad-
vantage. Leukemia initiation experiments demonstrated that

 primary leukemias may be derived from Bmal1-deficient HSPCs
transformed with MLL-AF9. However, serial transplantation re-
vealed that loss of Bmal1 increases leukemia latency and impairs
disease propagation. Consistent with the knockout studies, we
found that AML cells, as compared to normal HSPCs, are differ-
entially sensitive to circadian perturbation with SR9011.

similar in vivo. Differences in these rhythms could be exploited for
chronotherapy, in which chemoradiation is dosed at a time of day
when leukemia cells are selectively sensitive due to cell-cycle
status and/or expressionof specific clock output genes. Addition-
ally, drugs that alter the circadian rhythm may sensitize leukemia
cells to traditional anti-cancer therapies and facilitate targeting of
cancer stem cells to eliminate disease more effectively.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Maintenance, Transplants, and Genotyping
All mouse experiments were performed with an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC)-approved animal protocol at our facility (Boston Chil-
dren’s Hospital). Specific strains used in this study include C57BL/6J (Jackson
Labs), B6.SJL (Taconic), Actin-dsRed (006051, Jackson Labs), B6.129S4(Cg)-
Arntltm1Weit (007668, Jackson Labs), B6.129-Arntltm1Bra (009100, Jackson
Labs), B6.129S6-Per2tm1Jt (006852, Jackson Labs), and B6.Cg-Per2tm1Brd;
Tyrc�Brd/J (003819, Jackson Labs). CD45.1+ bone marrow cells isolated
from B6.SJL mice (Taconic) were used for the competitive transplantation
studies. For all other mouse experiments, C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs)
were used as controls. Prior to tail vein or retro-orbital transplantation, mice
were sublethally (1 3 6 Gy [600 rads]) or lethally (1 3 9.5 Gy [950 rads]) irradi-
ated as specified. A multiplexed PCR reaction was used to genotype Bmal1f/f
mice and to assess the efficiency of excision, as described previously (Storch
et al., 2007). Per2::Luc knockin mice were genotyped using primers
oIMR6588, oIMR6589, and oIMR6590 according to Jackson Labs protocols.
All mice used in this study were maintained on a standard LD12:12 schedule
with ad libitum access to food. Bone marrow and spleen harvests for murine
knockout and leukemia studies were generally performed between 1 and
5 hr after the initiation of light (Zeitgeber time, ZT1 to ZT5). Control and exper-
imental cohorts were harvested at the same time of day.
Quaternary Transplant MLL-AF9 Leukemia Model
GMPs were isolated from the bone marrow of Actin-dsRed mice, as described
previously (Krivtsov et al., 2006). GMPs were spinfected twice (2,500 rpm,
90 min, 37�C) with MSCV-MLL-AF9-Neo retrovirus in SFEM (Stem Cell Tech-
nologies) supplemented with murine IL3 (mIL3, 10 ng/ml, Peprotech), murine
IL6 (mIL6, 10 ng/ml, Peprotech), and murine SCF (mSCF, 10 ng/ml,
Peprotech), followed by transplantation to lethally irradiated WT recipients.
After disease onset, leukemic spleen cells were harvested and subsequently
transplanted to sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. Two additional
rounds of transplantation resulted in the generation of quaternary transplant
leukemias with high penetrance and short disease latency (Hartwell et al.,
2013). Flow cytometry was performed using antibodies for the lineage
markers CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, CD19, IL7R, and Ter119 (Caltag), c-Kit (17-
1172-83, eBioscience), Sca-1 (11-5981-82, eBioscience), CD34 (11-0341-
85, eBioscience), and CD16/32 (25-0161-82, eBioscience).
Isolation of Leukemia Stem Cells
The long bones and hips of moribund quaternary transplant leukemic mice
were harvested, cleaned, crushed, and sequentially passed through 100 mM
and 70 mM filters (Falcon). Following red blood cells lysis (QIAGEN), leukemic
bone marrow cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-c-Kit (clone 2B8;
eBioscience) and Hoechst 33258 (H21491, Invitrogen) in PBS with 2% FBS
(Omega). LSC-enriched populations were isolated by sorting Hoechst�,
dsRed+, c-Kithigh (top 10%–20%) cells (FACS Aria II, Becton Dickinson). In
the quaternary transplant MLL-AF9 model, the c-Kithigh fraction is suffi-
ciently-enriched for leukemia-initiating cells, as described previously (Hartwell
et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013). Quaternary transplant leukemia cells were used
for experiments presented in Figures 1A–1G, 2B–2H, 3G, and 5C.
ChIP-Seq
ChIP-seq was performed as previously described (Kowalczyk et al., 2012) with
minor modifications. Specifically, THP-1 cells were fixed in 2 mM EGS (Thermo
Scientific) for 30 or 60 min followed by 1% formaldehyde for 30 or 15 min
at room temperature (RT), respectively. Chromatin was sonicated to
a size <500 bp and then incubated overnight with either anti-Clock IgG
(ab3517, Abcam) or anti-Bmal1 IgG (ab3350, Abcam). ChIP-seq libraries
were prepared through the process of DNA end-repair (Epicenter), A-base
addition, and adaptor ligation using indexed Illumina adaptors followed by
enrichment PCR. All enzymatic steps were carried out using enzymes from
New England Biolabs. Final libraries were pooled, size selected, and
sequenced on HiSeq2500 with 25 paired-end reads.
ChIP-Seq Data Analysis
Paired-end reads for both ChIP and input samples were mapped to the hg19
version of the human genome using Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012),
only keeping read pairs that map uniquely to the genome. Peaks were called
using findPeaks from the Homer suite (v4.7.2) (Heinz et al., 2010) with ‘‘-style
factor -fdr 0.01 -LP 0.01 -P 0.1’’ parameters and using input data as back-
ground. The intersection of peaks for CLOCK and BMAL1 was used to define
a high-confidence set of binding sites. Identification of target genes associ-
ated with these binding sites and functional enrichment analysis were
completed using GREAT (v2.0.2) (McLean et al., 2010). H3K4me3 peaks
(Sequence Read Archive [SRA]: ERS148524) were set as background to con-
trol for activity/inactivity of genes. We identified 269 peaks associated with 406
genes for CLOCK and 9,584 peaks associated with 8,027 genes for BMAL1.
Focusing on the intersection of CLOCK and BMAL1 peaks, we identified 140
binding sites associated with 229 genes. Motif analysis of high-confidence
sites was performed using RSAT peak-motifs (Thomas-Chollier et al., 2012).
Gene ontology analysis (Ashburner et al., 2000) was completed using the
GO Slim web portal (http://go.princeton.edu). ChIP-seq data presented in
this study may be accessed on GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with
GEO: GSE70686.
Statistics
Kaplan Meyer analysis (Mantel-Cox test) and EC50 calculations were
completed using GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical analysis was completed using
R (http://www.r-project.org) or Excel (Microsoft) software. Mean values are
shown (unless otherwise specified) and error bars represent SEMs. Flow
cytometry gating and MFI analysis were completed using FlowJo 7.6.1
software. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided Student’s
t test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
Detailed descriptions of additional experimental and analytical methods are
included in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
