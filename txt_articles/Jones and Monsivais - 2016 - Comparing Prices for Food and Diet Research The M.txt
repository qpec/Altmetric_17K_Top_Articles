ABSTRACT
An important issue in research into access to healthy food is
how best to compare the price of foods. The appropriate metric
for comparison has been debated at length, with proponents
variously stating that food prices should be compared in terms
of their energy content, their edible mass, or their typical por-
tion size. In this article we assessed the impact of using different
food price metrics on the observed difference in price between
food groups and categories of healthiness, using United
Kingdom consumer price index data for 148 foods and bev-
erages in 2012. We found that the choice of metric had a marked
effect on the findings and conclude that this must be decided in
advance to suit the reason for comparing food prices.

Introduction
An essential component of food access and food security is the notion that
consumers have sufficient resources for a nutritious diet.1 Thus, it is impor-
tant to standardize methods for comparing the cost of different foods and
beverages (hereafter collectively referred to as foods) to examine how prices
may affect access to a nutritionally adequate diet. Having appropriate metrics
for comparison is also important for developing public health policies that
recommend substituting some foods for others, if they are to suitably account
for the potential limiting factor of cost.
Though food prices are currently monitored by governments, interna-
tional agencies, and private organizations, such tracking is usually not sui-
table for comparing the costs of different foods in relation to their nutritional
value.2 This has implications for monitoring food security, given that the
relationship between nutritional value and prices is a factor that will have a
large impact on food security. An inadequate understanding of how the
prices of different foods compare could also limit the effectiveness of food
assistance and nutrition programmes, such as the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program in the United States or the UK’s Healthy Start, because

 these programs are predicated on the assistance being large enough to
purchase foods that contribute to a healthy diet. As such, there is arguably
a requirement to be able to fairly compare food prices, but there is an
ongoing and vigorous debate as to the best way to make such comparisons,
with different researchers favoring different metrics and finding alternatives
to be misleading.3,4 Though this is ostensibly an economic issue, the purpose
of exploring it here is to improve the methodology available for research into
the economic determinants of food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition.
In this article we consider earlier arguments for the different metrics of food
price comparison and then apply these metrics to national food price data from
the UK, exploring how the choice of metric can influence the findings of
research on the question of whether healthier foods are more expensive. We
then make suggestions as to how future research should express food prices to
ensure that reported results are meaningful answers to the question being asked,
providing reasons for and against using different metrics and examples of each.
The debate so far
The need for a common metric by which foods can be assessed is due to the
different unit sizes of purchased goods, meaning that the price needs to be
divided by some quality of the food in question so that it is comparable to
others. For example, if we want to compare the price of an orange with the
price of a bag of apples there are numerous ways to do this: we could compare
the individual orange to the bag or in terms of mass, energy, typical portion
size, or perhaps other quantities of the foods. Comparisons have typically been
made by comparing the price divided by the energy content or mass of the food
in question.5 However, both of these approaches have received criticism3,4 and
neither has been adopted unanimously by researchers in this field.
One of the earliest published efforts to consider the price of food in terms
of its content was made by Atwater in 1894,6,7 who recognized that the
nutritive value of foods differed and that their cost ought to be framed in
terms of the energy or nutrients they provide. The price per unit of energy
metric has become a widely used approach for researchers interested in food
prices and nutrition, with a range of different authors using it in different
study designs and in different countries.8–10 Moreover, the costing of foods
in terms of price per unit energy in development economics suggests the
utility of this metric for understanding how food prices affect diet in low-
income populations.4,11,12
However, assessing price in terms of energy has been criticized on a
number of grounds, namely, that people do not purchase foods in forms
that are easily comparable in terms of calories, meaning that the price per
calorie may not be relevant to consumer behavior.13 Similarly, foods are not
necessarily eaten in isoenergetic quantities, so comparisons between foods
JOURNAL OF HUNGER & ENVIRONMENTAL NUTRITION
371
 typically eaten in quantities that do not provide equal amounts of energy—
for example, carrots and ice cream—is meaningless in practical terms.14
Finally, there has been criticism of attempting to assess the relationship
between how healthy a food is and its price when price is measured in
terms of energy and the healthiness of a food is measured by its energy
density, because this can lead to autocorrelation.3,5 The critics of an energy-
based metric instead often propose the use of mass as the most appropriate
metric.5 Proponents on both sides of the debate have engaged in studies
using randomly generated data to investigate the apparent mathematical
flaws in the other’s choice of metric, with opposing results.7,15
A third alternative, the use of portion size as a price metric, has also been
proposed on the grounds that comparisons of prices based on a fixed amount
of calories or mass of food may have little behavioral relevance. Portion sizes
are a better reflection of the quantities of foods that are typically consumed
and these can vary substantially among different types of foods.5 This
method would allow for a more realistic comparison of different foods and
for the cost figures to be more readily appraised. However, this metric
requires up-to-date and accurate data concerning the quantity typically
consumed, which may not always be available or appropriate for all popula-
tions, making it harder to adopt as a standard.
In summary, this debate is sharply polarized and does not appear to be
reaching a resolution. Accordingly, it is important to find common ground
and identify instances where there is agreement about what most appropriate
metric is the given the question being asked.
Empirical analysis
We analyzed government food price data from the UK to explore how the
choice of food price metric can have on the results produced by research
exploring which foods are more expensive.
Methods
Food price data
We obtained national food price data used to calculate the UK Consumer
Price Index (CPI) from the Office for National Statistics and matched them
to a range of appropriate items in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey
(NDNS),16 using a method described previously.17 Briefly, this was done by
matching each CPI item to a range of NDNS foods deemed to be a good
match. Following this, mean nutrient values were produced for each CPI
item by calculating the mean of the nutrient values listed for the NDNS
matches. To reflect the different ways in which a food may be prepared for
372
N. R. V. JONES AND P. MONSIVAIS
 consumption and the implications this would have for its nutrient content as
listed in NDNS (which lists foods as consumed, after adjustments made in
preparation), we weighted these mean values by the frequency with which
each preparation method is recorded in NDNS, intending to accurately
reflect the ways the foods are consumed by people in the UK. Prices were
then adjusted for edible portion of each food using United States Department
of Agriculture’s Handbook 10218 to account for the fact that the price data
were for foods as purchased and the NDNS data for foods as consumed. We
assigned a portion size to each food item using portion sizes typically
consumed in the UK, based on Wrieden and Barton.19 Items are included
in the CPI if they are frequently consumed by many households because the
index aims to sample goods and services that are typical of expenditure in the
UK.20 As such, the foods included in it can reasonably be expected to
represent those foods typically consumed.
Classification of foods
We determined which foods were more and less healthy using the Food
Standards Agency’s WXYfm nutrient profiling model (hereafter referred to as
the FSA Score), which provides a categorical definition of a food’s healthiness
based upon energy, saturated fat, total sugar, sodium, fiber, protein, and fruit,
vegetable, and nut content.21 We assigned foods to food groups in line with the
UK’s Eatwell Plate, a government-produced nutrition communication tool, using
a table in The Livewell Report, which matched NDNS food categories to Eatwell
food groups.22 These steps resulted in a data set of 148 foods and beverages with
information on their food groups, whether they are more or less healthy, and
their mean 2012 price per unit of energy, per unit of mass, and per portion.
Statistical analysis
Tests for a significant difference in mean prices by group were conducted
using a t test for comparing more and less healthy foods and analysis of
variance for comparing the Eatwell food groups. All analyses were conducted
using Stata (Ver SE 12.1).23 Figures were produced using R (version 3.0.2 for
Windows) and the ggplot2 package.24,25
Results
Table 1 reports the results of our analyses, containing the mean and standard
error for each price metric by FSA score–defined healthiness and by food
group. Prices were calculated on March 15, 2015, at an exchange rate of U.S.
$1.47 per £1.The overall mean price per 100 g was £0.57 ($0.84), £0.50 ($0.74)
per 100 kilocalories, and £0.47 ($0.69) per portion, with similar standard errors

 (0.05 for mass- and energy-based prices, 0.04 for portion-based prices). The
results by FSA category show the impact of the choice of denominator on the
observed relationship between how healthy a food is and its price: healthier
foods were significantly more expensive in terms of energy (0.65 £/100 kcal
($0.96) versus 0.28 £/100 kcal ($0.41), P < .001) and per portion (0.55 £/portion
($0.81) versus 0.35 £/portion ($0.52), P < .035) yet significantly less expensive in
terms of mass (0.46 £/100g ($0.68) versus 0.85 £/100g ($1.25), P < .001). When
prices were examined by Eatwell group, the choice of price metric also exerted
an effect on the results, with fruit and vegetables being the least expensive food
group by mass (0.28 £/100g ($0.41)) and second least by portion (0.25 £/portion
($0.37)) yet the most expensive in terms of calories (0.83 £/100 kcal ($1.22)).
Meat and other sources of a protein were the most expensive group by mass
(0.93 £/100 g ($1.37)) and portion size (0.94 £/portion ($1.39)), yet in the
middle of the price range given their energy content (0.52 £/100 kcal ($0.77)).
In summary, these results show that there is a considerable difference in the
cost of different foods depending on the price metric chosen.
Discussion
Our results show that the unit of comparison has an impact on which foods
were the most expensive. The effect of this can be to completely change the

 relationship observed, which has considerable implications for any research on
food costs or food security. This finding is in line with previous work,5,14 which
also found that fruits and vegetables went from being the most expensive to the
least expensive food group depending on the price metric. As has been pre-
viously stated,5 this finding is likely due to the low energy density of fruits and
vegetables, which results in a low price per gram and a high price per calorie.
Our findings have important implications for research comparing the
price of different foods, given the impact that choosing an inappropriate
metric would have on the results. Rather than promote any one food price
metric to the exclusion of others, here we will suggest guidance as to when it
is most appropriate to use the different metrics, given the research question
being asked. Such guidance would enable researchers to select price metrics
most appropriate for their research and also make the comparison of differ-
ent studies easier, thus allowing information to be better pooled and used to
inform food policy.
When to use mass as a metric
We now set out what we think are the circumstances in which each of the
three price metrics assessed in this article are the most salient. When the
research question makes a comparison between similar foods, the use of mass
as the price comparison metric may be the most appropriate given that this
allows the consumer to determine whether two products that will serve the
same purpose within their diet differ in price. An example of this is the
comparison between different packets of butter: both are nutritionally similar
and will be served in similar portions but there may be a price difference
between them. This metric seems most appropriate here because in some
countries, including the UK26 and Australia,27 this unit price (price per unit
weight) labeling is mandated and therefore is available to consumers when
making decisions. However, the mass of the product bears little relationship
to how it is consumed and the level of sustenance it provides, meaning that
this metric is unlikely to be a meaningful way to compare very different types
of food; for example, steak and lettuce. It should be noted that the price per
unit of mass will not be available in all food outlets and in many countries
and this should be taken into account by researchers deciding on a price
comparison metric if they want it to have any behavioral relevance.
When to use portions as a metric
Dietary guidelines often include recommendations for consuming a specific
number of portions of food per day or per week. Given the observed relation-
ship between the price of more and less healthy foods, concerns may exist that
the cost of recommended foods might prevent some groups from meeting
JOURNAL OF HUNGER & ENVIRONMENTAL NUTRITION
375
 these guidelines.17,28 In such circumstances, the price-per-portion metric may
be useful for estimating the likely impact on consumer costs, allowing guide-
lines to be adapted accordingly. For example, U.S. government analysis has
estimated the cost of meeting the recommended 5 portions of fruit and
vegetables per day.29
Alternatively, when researchers wish to determine the cost of directly
substituting one food for another, the use of portion sizes is appropriate
given that the foods may be of different quantities of both energy and mass.
This metric allows for a comparison to be made that is directly connected to
how people typically consume the foods being compared. For example, when
comparing the cost of serving of shepherd’s pie and a grilled cod fillet, the
portion size is probably the most appropriate way to compare these foods,
which differ in energy and nutrient contents but have a similar role in a meal.
Studies have used this approach to examine the cost of substituting healthier
foods for less-healthy foods in institutional settings28 and the cost and
nutritional effects of substituting fruit for fruit juice in the diets of children.30
This approach is also likely to lead to results that are more readily inter-
pretable, in contrast to prices being expressed in terms of energy or mass,
which has advantages when it comes to dissemination to a lay audience.
However, the use of a typical portion size relies on these data being available,
which will not always be the case.
When to use energy as a metric
When addressing questions of public health and nutrition, pricing food on
the basis of energy content appears to be the most appropriate approach
because the comparison is between the sustenance the foods can contribute.
This is based on the notion of physiological energy requirements for main-
taining energy balance, with foods varying in the extent to which they
contribute to achieving this energy target. In contrast, the mass and number
of portions have no physiological basis. To give an example, this metric
would be the best way to compare bread and apples, foods that are likely
to be very different in terms how much energy they can provide when
matched mass for mass or portion for portion. There are variations of this
approach that can also be used, such as estimating the cost of obtaining a
specified quantity of nutrients—for example, protein,6 potassium, or fiber31;
however, energy is the key component of food required to sustain life in the
short term, so for general questions concerning public health nutrition it will
be suitable. However, as with portion sizes, the data required to calculate the
price in terms of energy content will not always be available to researchers.
Table 2 summarizes our considerations when selecting a food price metric. We
hope that our suggestions as to the most appropriate metric for use in different
situations may bring about an increased awareness of the notion that one metric
376
N. R. V. JONES AND P. MONSIVAIS
 cannot be used to answer all questions. However, these considerations are likely to
be contested and we welcome debate over the advice we set out here.
Beyond foods, it is important to consider the most appropriate metric with
which to compare diets, because the overall diet is ultimately more important
in terms of food security and long-term health than individual foods. We
suggest that cost per unit of energy is the most appropriate metric for
comparing the cost of different diets, given that the total diet should be
within a specified level of energy intake based upon age, sex, basal metabolic
rate, and physical activity levels, whereas the number of portions or the total
mass of a diet can vary depending on the types of foods consumed, the
typical portion size, and energy density of individual diets. This can be seen
in the limited deviation in dietary energy observed in populations. Figure 1a
shows the age- and sex-adjusted means of food energy consumed by adults in
the UK by educational attainment based on data from the National Diet and
Nutrition Survey (2008–2012).32 Mean energy intake is tightly clustered
across categories of educational attainment, with a maximum difference
across groups of 168 kcal/day (10% variation). However, total mass of the
diet (Figure 1b) varies substantially and is socially patterned, with higher
income groups having a dietary mass that was 392 g/day (16%) higher than
that of the lowest income group. The larger variation observed in dietary
mass indicates that there is less physiological regulation of how much food
mass can be consumed in contrast to energy, which appears to be more
consistent across the population. Standardizing dietary costs for levels of
energy intake also provides consistency with dietary guidance, in which
recommended quantities of foods and nutrients are scaled in relation to
energy intake.

 In the UK, United States, and other high-income countries, the burden of
obesity and some chronic diseases is caused in part by the consumption of
diets that contain excess energy but insufficient levels of other nutrients.33,34
Because sufficient energy consumption alone is not enough to ensure good
health in the long term, it would be important to identify ways of improving
the nutrient to calorie ratio of the overall diet by consuming more nutrient-
rich foods. Such foods might not necessarily be low cost on a per calorie basis
but still be economical in terms of the cost per unit of nutrients. Studies of
this kind in the United States have combined national food price data with
nutrient composition data to identify low-cost, nutritious foods.31,35
Though some have argued that the cost of foods expressed per unit of
energy has little behavioral significance,36 research indicates that lower
income households tend to buy foods that are on average cheaper per calorie,
perhaps meaning that there is a behavioral response to low prices for food
energy.37,38 Furthermore, longitudinal data indicate that, irrespective of their
socioeconomic position, households shifted to purchasing cheaper calories
during a period of rising food prices and falling real incomes.39 This indicates
that cutting food costs without lowering energy intake can lead to the
substitution of foods that provide more energy for a given price, which has
been suggested previously in simulation studies.40,41
It is worth noting that our data are from the UK and that we have only
considered the arguments in favor of different metrics in the context of a
high-income country such as the UK, meaning that they may not necessarily

 apply to middle- or low-income settings. However, they could reasonably be
expected to be appropriate for use in countries with similar economic and
agricultural systems, particularly other countries within the European Union
that are subject to the same laws governing agricultural subsidy and food
production standards. The United Kingdom is a high-income country and
despite the price of food rising by 7.7% since 2007, the mean percentage of
household expenditure on food is 11.4% and overall UK prices are just 0.5%
greater than the European Union average.42,43 Users of our findings should
assess whether or not the economic and food system context in which they
are working is comparable to that of the UK.
Conclusions
In this article we have briefly reviewed the debate concerning the most
appropriate price metric for the comparison of different foods and bev-
erages, demonstrating the sizeable effect that metric choice can have on
the results of price comparisons. In an attempt to outline guidance con-
cerning the use of price comparison metrics, we have made suggestions as
to when to apply the different approaches according to the question being
addressed. Though there are numerous occasions where it is more appro-
priate to analyze food prices in terms of mass or portion size, when the
research concerns public health and the ability to eat healthily, we argue
that energy is often the most appropriate metric for assessing the cost of
both foods and diets.
