Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of cellular
homeostasis. However, their contribution to the cancer phenotype
still needs to be established. Herein, we have identified a p53-
induced lncRNA, TP53TG1, that undergoes cancer-specific promoter
hypermethylation-associated silencing. In vitro and in vivo assays
identify a tumor-suppressor activity for TP53TG1 and a role in the p53
response to DNA damage. Importantly, we show that TP53TG1 binds
to the multifaceted DNA/RNA binding protein YBX1 to prevent its
nuclear localization and thus the YBX1-mediated activation of onco-
genes. TP53TG1 epigenetic inactivation in cancer cells releases the
transcriptional repression of YBX1-targeted growth-promoting genes
and creates a chemoresistant tumor. TP53TG1 hypermethylation in
primary tumors is shown to be associated with poor outcome. The
epigenetic loss of TP53TG1 therefore represents an altered event in an
lncRNA that is linked to classical tumoral pathways, such as p53 sig-
naling, but is also connected to regulatory networks of the cancer cell.

I
t has been estimated that only 2% of the genome is transcribed
into protein-coding RNAs (1), so most of the transcriptome
corresponds to noncoding transcripts, which are classified
according to their length and structural properties (2, 3). Among
the small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), the abundant class of
miRNAs (19–25 nt) regulates gene expression through interac-
tions based on their complementarity with target mRNAs (4).
These ncRNAs have been widely studied in the context of cancer
cells (5, 6). The other main group of ncRNAs is the long ncRNAs
(lncRNAs; arbitrarily >200 nt), which are defined as lacking
protein-coding potential but otherwise often display mRNA-like
properties, including multiexonic gene structures and poly(A) tails
(2, 3). LncRNAs are associated with a variety of regulatory functions,
including chromatin-related roles, splicing control, and transcrip-
tional regulation (7–9). Despite recent reports describing aberrant
expression of lncRNAs in human tumors (8–11), few of these mol-
ecules have been carefully characterized with respect to their func-
tional roles in the promotion or inhibition of carcinogenesis (12,
13). However, significant exceptions exist, and mechanisms of
action and downstream cellular effects have been demonstrated
for lncRNAs acting as oncogenes, such as HOTAIR (14) and
MALAT1 (15), or as tumor suppressors, such as LincRNA-p21 (16)
and Uc.283+A (17).
Several recent studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are
deregulated in cancer tissues. Causes of this deregulation include
genetic events leading to abnormal expression, such as copy
number alterations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in
lncRNA promoter regions (8–11). However, another possibility is
that lncRNAs may themselves be targets of epigenetic disruption.
In this regard, the promoter CpG island hypermethylation-asso-
ciated silencing of coding tumor-suppressor genes and micro-
RNAs is a well-established hallmark of human cancer (18–21).
In recent times, a relatively small number of lncRNAs, such as
Significance
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are starting to be recognized
as critical molecules for cellular transformation, although only
a few candidates have so far been characterized. Here we re-
port that TP53TG1 is an lncRNA that is critical for the correct
response of p53 to DNA damage. The cancer growth suppres-
sor features of TP53TG1 are linked to its ability to block the
tumorigenic activity of the RNA binding protein YBX1. The DNA
methylation-associated silencing of TP53TG1 produces aggres-
sive tumors that are resistant to cellular death when DNA-
damaging agents and small targeted molecules are used. Our
study provides an example of a tumor suppressor lncRNA un-
dergoing an epigenetic lesion in cancer that is placed at the
crossroads of DNA damage and oncogenic pathways.

 transcribed–ultraconserved regions (22), antisense RNAs (23),
and small nucleolar RNAs (24), have been shown to undergo
cancer-specific epigenetic inactivation, but the field of DNA
methylation-dependent silencing of lncRNAs remains largely un-
explored. In this study, we have found that the epigenetic loss of
the lncRNA TP53TG1 enhances tumor progression, prevents an
effective p53 response to DNA damage, creates a chemoresistant
phenotype, and unleashes the transforming capacities of its part-
ner, identified herein, the RNA binding protein YBX1.
Results
TP53TG1 Shows Cancer-Specific DNA Methylation-Associated Transcriptional
Silencing. To characterize cancer-specific DNA methylation changes
that affect lncRNA expression, we followed the experimental work-
flow shown in Fig. 1A. We took advantage of the existence of an
isogenic cell line derived from the colon cancer cell line HCT-116,
which shows genetic disruption by homologous recombination of the
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3b (double knock-
out, DKO) (25). DKO cells have drastically reduced DNMT activity,
5-methylcytosine DNA content, and, above all, a release of coding
genes and microRNA silencing associated with promoter CpG island
hypomethylation (25). We wanted to identify cancer-specific DNA
methylation events in lncRNA loci, so we also included two samples
of normal colon mucosa in our study design. We obtained the
DNA methylation profile of the wild-type HCT-116 cells, the derived
DKO cells, and the aforementioned normal colon using the Infinium
HumanMethylation450 (450K) microarray, which interrogates 482,422
CpG sites (26). Noting that the platform includes 104 annotated
lncRNAs with a 5′-CpG island (SI Appendix, Table S1) enabled us to
narrow our search to the candidate methylated positions with a possible
effect on lncRNA expression. To identify from among these candidates
those lncRNAs with cancer-specific differential methylation, we im-
posed stringent criteria to consider only those CpG island sites with
a ≥70% change in the CpG methylation level between the cancer cell

 line HCT-116 compared with the demethylated DKO cell line and
the normal colon cell line. Under these conditions, we identified 10
targets: TP53TG1 (TP53 target gene 1), NCRNA00028, LOC157627,
MIR155HG, WT1AS, LINC00473, C20orf200, EMX2OS, MIAT,
and MYCNOS (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Table S2). Quantitative
RT-PCR analyses confirmed transcriptional silencing in HCT-116
cells and demethylation-associated reactivation in DKO cells
for seven (70%) of the lncRNAs: TP53TG1, NCRNA00028,
LOC157627, MIR155HG, WT1AS, C20orf200, and MYCNOS
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Although all of them were promising candi-
dates for further analysis, we decided to focus our interest on
TP53TG1 because of its high-ranking order in the differential meth-
ylation (SI Appendix, Table S2) and expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S1)
data and because of its proposed role in central cancer pathways such
as the p53 network (27). With respect to the latter, TP53TG1 ex-
pression is induced in a p53-dependent manner upon conditions of
cellular stress that involve the induction of double-strand breaks, such
as UV irradiation (27, 28), or exposure to bleomycin or cisplatin (28).
To further demonstrate the silencing of TP53TG1 in cancer cells
in association with the presence of promoter CpG island hyper-
methylation, we proceeded to characterize its transcription start site
(TSS) and DNA methylation patterns. Using rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE), we confirmed that the TP53TG1 transcript
originates within the CpG island in the DNA methylation microarray,
confirming the Refseq database annotation in UCSC (NR_015381.1
from GRCh38/hg38). Bisulfite genomic sequencing of multiple
clones confirmed the dense methylation of the CpG island in HCT-
116 cells and its unmethylated status in normal colorectal mucosa
(Fig. 1B). We extended our DNA methylation analyses to another
12 gastrointestinal cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). In addition to HCT-
116, TP53TG1 5′-end CpG island hypermethylation was also found
in the colorectal cancer cell line KM12 and in the gastric cancer cell
lines KATO-III and TGBC11TKB. All of the other cell lines were
unmethylated at this locus (Fig. 1B). Normal gastric mucosa and
nontumorigenic human colon epithelial cells (HCECs) (29) were
unmethylated at the TP53TG1 CpG island (Fig. 1B). Quantitative
RT-PCR revealed a loss of TP53TG1 expression in all of the
hypermethylated cells, whereas lncRNA was expressed in the
unmethylated cases (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the use of the deme-
thylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine restored TP53TG1 expres-
sion in the hypermethylated HCT-116, KM12, KATO-III, and
TGBC11TKB cell lines (Fig. 1C). Subcellular fractioning showed
that the TP53TG1 transcript in DKO cells, in addition to being
present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, was particularly
enriched in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 1D). RNA fluorescence
in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) corroborated this intracellular lo-
calization (Fig. 1D). We confirmed the noncoding nature of the
TP53TG1 RNA transcript by using an artificially created recombi-
nant protein followed by Western blot to demonstrate the lack of any
TP53TG1-derived protein in the unmethylated HCEC and DKO cell
lines (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In vitro transcription/translation assays
confirmed the absence of TP53TG1 coding potential (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S2). TP53TG1’s lack of coding capacity was also
apparent from the negative codon substitution frequency (CSF)
score (30) of –402.4488, which was similar to that obtained from
the well-characterized lncRNA HOTAIR (–354.5062). Overall,
these results indicate that tumor-specific promoter CpG island
hypermethylation-associated silencing of the lncRNA TP53TG1
occurs in colorectal and gastric cancer cells.
TP53TG1 Exhibits Tumor Suppressor-Like Features in Cancer Cells.
Having observed the CpG island hypermethylation-associated si-
lencing of TP53TG1 in colorectal and gastric cancer cells, we used
in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the ability of the lncRNA
to suppress tumor growth. For the in vitro approach, we stably
transfected the HCT-116 cell line, hypermethylated and silenced
for TP53TG1, with a plasmid encoding the full-length lncRNA
transcript. The efficiency of transfection was assessed by measuring
TP53TG1 expression by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Upon
TP53TG1 transfection, the cells proved to be significantly less
proliferative in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Fig. 2B) and had a significantly lower per-
centage colony formation density (Fig. 2B) than empty vector-
transfected cells. The reduced growth of the TP53TG1-transfected
HCT-116 cell line was associated with apoptosis induction, based
on the assessment of the sub-G1 cell population, caspase 3/7 levels,
and the annexin V assay (Fig. 2C). The restoration of TP53TG1
expression upon transfection in HCT-116 was also associated with
a decreased invasion and migration potential of these cells, as
measured by the Matrigel-based xCELLigence real-time assay
(31) (Fig. 2D) and the wound-healing assay (Fig. 2D).
For the in vivo approach, we first used tumor-formation assays in
nude mice. HCT-116 cells transfected with either the empty or the
TP53TG1 vector were s.c. injected into nude mice. Tumors origi-
nating from TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells had a significantly
lower volume and weight than empty vector-transfected/derived
tumors (Fig. 2E), in addition to a higher apoptosis rate (Fig. 2E).
We also did an orthotopic growth study, implanting equal-sized
tumor pieces from the s.c. model into the colon tract. We observed
that orthotopic TP53TG1-transfected tumors were significantly
smaller than the empty vector-transfected tumors (Fig. 2F). We also
proceeded with the converse experiment in which we analyzed the
effect of TP53TG1 depletion in nontransformed immortalized
colonocytes (HCECs), which have an unmethylated CpG island and
express the lncRNA transcript. Upon efficient small interference
RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of TP53TG1 (Fig. 2G),
we observed a significant enhancement of cell viability, as measured
by the MTT assay, relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig.
2G), and a reduced apoptosis rate (Fig. 2G). Overall, our findings
suggest that TP53TG1 has a tumor-suppressor role.
TP53TG1 Contributes to p53 Response to DNA Damage. p53 is known to
activate TP53TG1 expression upon the induction of double-strand
breaks in DNA caused by ionizing irradiation (27, 28) or treatment
with DNA-damaging agents (27). This prompted us to consider
whether TP53TG1 hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer
cells affected the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs that directly
target DNA. Using the TP53TG1-unmethylated HCEC line, which
carries a wild-type p53 gene, we observed that treatment with the
DNA-damaging agents caused not only the expected induction of
p53 but also enhanced TP53TG1 expression (Fig. 3A). The same
effect was observed in two other TP53TG1-unmethylated and
p53 wild-type gastrointestinal cell lines: SW48 (colon) and SNU-1
(stomach) (Fig. 3B). However, we did not find increased TP53TG1
expression when using DNA-damaging agents in the unmethylated,
but p53 mutant, SW-620 colorectal cancer cell line (Fig. 3B). Instead,
we found that the induction of TP53TG1 upon DNA damage was
dependent on the presence of a functional p53: siRNA-mediated
depletion of p53 in HCECs impaired the overexpression of
TP53TG1 when the DNA-damaging drug was used (Fig. 3C). We
then attempted to determine how p53 exerted its control over
TP53TG1 transcription at the molecular level. The chromatin im-
munoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that p53 binds to a pre-
viously identified enhancer sequence located in intron 2 of TP53TG1
(32, 33) (Fig. 3D). The association of p53 to the TP53TG1 locus has
been previously reported using ChIP followed by deep sequencing
(ChIP-seq) (34). The described enhancer intronic region interacts
with the promoter of TP53TG1, as shown by chromatin interaction
analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) (35) (SI Appen-
dix, Fig. S3). p53 binds to this regulatory region of TP53TG1 and
transcriptionally activates it when the DNA-damaging agent is used
(Fig. 3D). We observed the same binding pattern for the classical
p53-responding gene p21WAF1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Having discovered that TP53TG1 restoration in an initially
methylation-silenced cell induces apoptosis and that p53 activates
TP53TG1 transcription upon DNA damage, we wondered whether

 the recovery of TP53TG1 expression sensitizes to DNA-damaging
agents. To address this, we measured the IC50 of the HCT-116,
TP53TG1-unmethylated, and p53 wild-type cell line, transfected
with an empty vector or with the studied lncRNA for four different
single-treatment DNA-damaging agents (doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
carboplatin, and cisplatin) and the drug combinations used in the
clinical context of colorectal cancer, 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin and
5-fluorouracil + irinotecan. We found that, in all of the cases, the
transfection-mediated recovery of TP53TG1 expression significantly
increased the sensitivity to these agents (Fig. 3E). We also extended
the in vitro cell viability experiments to an in vivo mouse model of
orthotopic growth. We observed that orthotopic colorectal tumors
derived from TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells were signifi-
cantly more responsive to the common colorectal chemotherapeutic
regimen of 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin than empty vector-derived
tumors (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that TP53TG1 probably
plays an important role in the p53-mediated antitumoral effects of
DNA-damaging agents.
TP53TG1 Binds to the RNA Binding Protein YBX1 and Prevents Its
Nuclear Localization. With the exception of its role as a transcript
induced by p53 upon DNA damage (27, 28), nothing is known
about the functions of TP53TG1. To identify protein partners
of TP53TG1 that could characterize its activity in the processes
described here, we performed RNA pull-down assays combined
with mass spectrometry (MS). In vitro-synthesized full-length
TP53TG1 RNA, or its antisense version, was incubated in the
presence of HCEC extracts and the retrieved proteins were ana-
lyzed by SDS/PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4A, a protein band of ∼45
kDa was specifically pulled down by TP53TG1 RNA but not by
other control RNAs. This band was cut out from the gel, trypsin-
digested, and further characterized by MS, which identified the
isolated band as the Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1, also known as
YB-1) through the identification of four distinct peptides (Fig. 4B
and SI Appendix, Table S3). YBX1 functions as both a DNA and
RNA binding protein and has been implicated in numerous cellular
processes, including regulation of transcription and translation, pre-
mRNA splicing, DNA reparation, and mRNA packaging (36).
YBX1 activation has been associated with cancer progression (37,
38), the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (39), metastasis (40), and
drug resistance (41, 42). Western blot with a specific antibody con-
firmed that YBX1 is enriched in the TP53TG1 pull-down (Fig. 4C).
The reciprocal experiment showed that immunoprecipitation of
YBX1 from HCECs can copurify the TP53TG1 lncRNA as a
binding partner (Fig. 4D). Control IgG was used as a negative re-
action and the YBX1 partner G3BP1 mRNA (43) was used as a
positive control for YBX1 binding (Fig. 4D). Bioinformatic predic-
tion of protein partners for TP53TG1 using the catRAPID system
(44) also indicated that YBX1 was a likely target of the lncRNA
studied here. We further characterized the specific RNA sequence in
the TP53TG1 transcript that was responsible for the binding to the
YBX1 protein. Using various YBX1 deletion mutants, followed by

 YBX1 Western blot in the RNA pull-down assays, we identified that,
from the 710 nucleotides of the full-length transcript, a middle re-
gion of 253 nucleotides was responsible for YBX1 binding (Fig. 4E).
This region included five CACC YBX1 binding motifs (45, 46)
(Fig. 4E). Most importantly, when we mutated the five CACC motifs,
the binding of TP53TG1 to YBX1 was notably diminished (Fig. 4E).
In addition, mobility shift assays showed that the recombinant YBX1
protein was able to bind specifically to this middle region, indicating a
direct interaction with the lncRNA (Fig. 4E). The presence of the
intact CACC YBX1-binding sites was necessary to ensure the tumor-
suppressor function of TP53TG1 observed here, as transfection of
the lncRNA form mutated at the five CACC motifs was unable to
inhibit HCT-116 cell growth, as determined by the MTT and colony-
formation assay (Fig. 4F). In addition, the cotransfection of the full-
length wild-type YBX1 protein in TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116
cells increased their growth and invasion potential, thus reversing in
part the tumor suppressor role of TP53TG1 (Fig. 4G). Our results
therefore imply that the multitasked YBX1 protein is a direct target
of TP53TG1 involved in its associated tumor suppressor features.
We then examined the effect that TP53TG1 could have on YBX1.
The transfection-mediated restoration of TP53TG1 expression in
HCT-116 did not affect the total mRNA or protein levels of YBX1
(Fig. 5A). In a similar manner, the siRNA-mediated depletion of
TP53TG1 in HCECs affected neither the total transcript nor the
amount of the YBX1 protein (Fig. 5A). There was also no asso-
ciation between the presence of TP53TG1 methylation-associated
silencing in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and YBX1 RNA
levels (Fig. 5A). Thus, TP53TG1 does not seem to have a signif-
icant role in determining the overall levels of YBX1 in a particular
cell or tumor. However, a key component of YBX1 activity resides
in its controlled trafficking between the nucleus and the cytosol
related to its dual activities as a DNA- and an RNA-binding
protein (36, 41, 42). To assess the impact of TP53TG1 in YBX1
intracellular compartmentalization, we isolated and studied the
nuclear and cytosolic fraction in our experimental system in detail.
We found that YBX1 was present in the nuclear and cytosolic
compartments of TP53TG1-methylated HCT-116 cells (Fig. 5B), but
the transfection-mediated recovery of TP53TG1 expression in these
cells caused the exclusion of YBX1 from the nucleus (Fig. 5B).

DNA damage induces TP53TG1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. (A) Treatment with DNA-damaging agents increases p53 and TP53TG1 expression
in TP53TG1-unmethylated and p53 wild-type HCECs. The cells were treated with doxorubicin (100 nM) or etoposide (50 μM) for 24 h. Values were obtained by
qRT-PCR and expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (B) Treatment with DNA-damaging agents increases TP53TG1 expression in the TP53TG1-unmethylated and
p53 wild-type colorectal (SW-48) and gastric (SNU-1) cancer cells but not in TP53TG1-unmethylated and p53 mutant colon cancer cells (SW-620). Cells were treated
with bleomycin, cisplatin, and etoposide for 24 h. Expression was analyzed in triplicates by qRT-PCR, and the results are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 4).
(C) TP53TG1 induction upon DNA damage depends on wild-type p53. p53 silencing by siRNA in HCECs prevents TP53TG1 activation upon 50 μM etoposide
treatment for 24 h. Values were obtained by qRT-PCR and expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (D) The increase of TP53TG1 after DNA damage is mediated by
direct binding of the p53 protein to p53 response elements (p53 REs) of the TP53TG1 gene. After doxorubicin (100 nM) treatment for 24 h in HCECs, ChiP was
performed with IgG or p53 antibodies, followed by qPCR and semiquantitative PCR in the p53 RE region. Values of qPCR were obtained from triplicates and
expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (E) Recovery of TP53TG1 expression restores chemosensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. TP53TG1 stably transfected HCT-116
cells were treated with various DNA-damaging anticancer drugs, and cell viability was determined by MTT. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was
calculated and expressed as relative units. (F) Orthotopic tumors derived from TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells were more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin
treatment than empty vector-derived tumors according to tumor weight. Significance of Mann-Whitney U test, ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.

 Immunofluorescence assays confirmed the localization of YBX1 in
the cytosol and nucleus of HCT-116 cells (Fig. 5B) and its exclusively
cytosolic presence upon the transfection-related restoration of
TP53TG1 expression (Fig. 5B). Using a panel of TP53TG1-meth-
ylated (KM12, TGBC11TKB, and KATO-III) and -unmethylated
(HT-29, SW480, HCEC, GCIY, and NUG-3) gastrointestinal cells,
we confirmed that nuclear staining was almost absent in the unme-
thylated cell lines and the clear detection of both nuclear and cy-
tosolic localization in the hypermethylated samples (Fig. 5 C and D).
These results suggest that the tumor-suppressor role of
TP53TG1 identified here could be mediated by preventing the
widely described protumorigenic nuclear functions of YBX1 (36–
42). YBX1 is known to bind to the promoter of the phosphatidy-
linositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) gene and to stimulate
its transcription (47). Importantly for our observed chemoresistant
phenotypes, it is known that PI3K stimulates AKT and MDM2
phosphorylation, thus facilitating p53 degradation (48). In our
system, ChIP demonstrated that the transfection-mediated recovery
of TP53TG1 expression in HCT-116 cells reduced the binding of
the YBX1 protein to the PI3K promoter (Fig. 6A). Most importantly,
the diminished binding of YBX1 to the PI3K promoter was associ-
ated with the down-regulation of the PI3K protein and the
reduced phosphorylation of AKT in comparison with empty vector-
transfected cells (Fig. 6B). Transfection of the TP53TG1 transcript
mutated at the five CACC YBX1 binding sites did not affect PI3K
protein levels or AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). In addition, the

TP53TG1 binds to the YBX1 protein. (A) Detection of candidate TP53TG1-associated proteins by RNA pull-down assays. In vitro-synthesized bio-
tinylated full-length TP53TG1 lncRNA and other RNA control sequences were incubated in the presence of total HCEC extracts, retrieved with streptavidin
beads, and the associated proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. A specific band of ∼45 KDa (black square) was pulled down by TP53TG1 lncRNA. TP53TG1
antisense and unrelated RNA (Uc.160) were used as negative controls. (B) Identification of the TP53TG1 RNA isolated pull-down band by MS. The specific band
detected in the RNA pull-down assay was cut out and trypsin-digested for MS analysis. The spectra show the four YBX1 peptides that bind to TP53TG1 lncRNA.
(C) Western blot showing the specific association between YBX1 and TP53TG1 lncRNA in the samples obtained from the RNA pull-down. TP53TG1 antisense
RNA and an unrelated RNA (Uc.160) were used as negative controls. Total extract of the TP53TG1 unmethylated HCEC line was used as the input control. (D)
Confirmation of the YBX1 interaction with TP53TG1 by YBX1 immunoprecipitation (reverse pull-down). Endogenous YBX1 was immunoprecipitated from
total HCEC extracts with anti-YBX1 antibody. The pulled-down RNA was extracted and analyzed by (Left) RT-PCR and (Right) qRT-PCR. The G3BP1 RNA was
used as a positive target of YBX1. (E) YBX1 binds to the central region of TP53TG1. (Upper and Lower Left) Various truncated RNA fragments of TP53TG1
were pulled down following incubation with HCEC total extract, and YBX1 protein was detected by Western blot. TP53TG1 antisense and an unrelated RNA
were used as negative controls. (Upper Right) Increasing amounts of recombinant YBX1 protein were incubated with either the 3′ end or the central region of
the TP53TG1 transcript and run on a native 6% (wt/vol) acrylamide gel. The mobility shift indicates the direct interaction between YBX1 and TP53TG1. (Lower
Middle) The middle sequence of TP53TG1 with the five YBX1 binding sites that were mutated is indicated. (Lower Right) RNA pull-down experiments show
that mutation of these sites impairs the interaction. (F) Transfection of the TP53TG1 mutant form (Upper Left), unable to bind to the YBX1 protein, in HCT-
116 cells does not affect growth determined by (Upper Right) MTT and (Lower) colony formation assays. (G) Cotransfection of the full-length wild-type YBX1
protein in TP53TG1-transfected HCT-116 cells increases (Upper) their growth (MTT) and (Lower) invasiveness (xCELLigence Real-Time). Values were expressed

 diminished PI3K/AKT signaling seen when TP53TG1 expression was
restored was associated with greater sensitivity to PI3K and AKT
inhibitors (Fig. 6C). Most importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/
AKT pathway upon TP53TG1 restitution also decreased MDM2
phosphorylation and estabilized p53 protein levels (Fig. 6D). These
results therefore suggest that the epigenetic silencing of TP53TG1
in cancer cells promotes the YBX1-mediated activation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway, which then creates further resistance not only to
common chemotherapy DNA-damaging agents but also to small
drug-targeted inhibitors. This finding relates to the broad spectrum of
chemoresistance that is customarily associated with the YBX1 pro-
tein (36, 41, 42).
TP53TG1 Hypermethylation Occurs in Gastrointestinal Tumors in
Association with Poor Outcome. The presence of TP53TG1 cancer-
specific promoter CpG island hypermethylation was not an in vitro
characteristic restricted to colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines.
Data mining of large collections of primary human tumors inter-
rogated by the same DNA methylation microarray platform as used
here (26) confirmed the existence of TP53TG1 hypermethylation in
6% (12 of 180) and 10% (9 of 94) of colorectal (49) and gastric (50)
tumors, respectively (Fig. 7A). The DNA methylation data available
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for colorectal (51) and
gastric (52) primary tumors also show the presence of TP53TG1
hypermethylation in 4% (14 of 369) and 13% (38 of 298) of these
cases, respectively (Fig. 7A). The higher frequency of aberrant
TP53TG1 DNA methylation noted in the primary stomach neo-
plasias prompted us to focus our efforts on this tumor type. TCGA
RNA-sequencing data in gastric carcinomas (52) show that TP53TG1
methylation was associated with transcript down-regulation (Mann–
Whitney U test, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 7B). Thus, we determined by
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) the DNA methylation status of the
5′-end promoter CpG island of TP53TG1 in a collection of 173
primary gastric tumors. We found TP53TG1 hypermethylation in
26% (45 of 173) of the gastric neoplasms studied. We studied in
greater depth the possible clinical impact of the epigenetic alteration
in TP53TG1 in the 63 gastric cancer patients for whom we had de-
tailed information about pathological characteristics and disease
outcome. We found that the presence of TP53TG1 hypermethylation
was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival

TP53TG1 binds to the YBX1 protein, preventing its nuclear localization. (A) Lack of association between TP53TG1 and YBX1 expression levels. YBX1
expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot after TP53TG1 stable overexpression in HCT-116 (four replicates: 1–4) and after TP53TG1 silencing by
RNAi in HCECs. Expression levels of the TP53TG1 and YBX1 genes were determined by qRT-PCR in human colon and gastric cancer cell lines. Values of qRT-PCR
were obtained from triplicates and expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (B) Recovery of TP53TG1 expression by transfection in the methylated HCT-116 cells
modifies the subcellular distribution of the YBX1 protein. TP53TG1 restoration excludes the YBX1 protein from the nucleus according to subcellular fractionation
experiments followed by Western blot (Left) and immunofluorescence assays (Right). (Scale bar, 5 μm.) White triangles indicate representative YBX1 expression in
the nucleus. (C) Immunofluorescence assays confirm the nuclear exclusion of the YBX1 protein in the TP53TG1 unmethylated colorectal (HT-29, SW480, and HCEC)
and gastric (GCIY and NUG-3) cell lines. Conversely, TP53TG1 hypermethylated and silenced colorectal (KM12) and gastric (TGBC11TKB and KATO-III) cell lines
show nuclear localization, in addition to the cytosolic staining. (D) Quantification of nuclear immunofluorescence intensity (mean gray value) in the TP53TG1-

 (PFS) (P = 0.018) (Fig. 7C). Considering the two groups of early and
advanced clinical stage patients separately, we found that the impact
of the outcome was due to the gastric patients with locoregional
disease (stages I and II): TP53TG1 hypermethylation was signif-
icantly associated with shorter PFS in gastric patients with
locoregional disease (P = 0.028) (Fig. 7D). Cox proportional haz-
ard regression models of these conditions showed TP53TG1
methylation to be an independent prognostic factor of worse PFS
[hazard ratio (HR) =3.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.19–
11.11, P = 0.023], compared with other parameters such as gender,
age, histology, and tumor location (Fig. 7E). In addition, we assessed
if the intracellular localization of YBX1, determined in part by
TP53TG1 expression as we have shown in our in vitro experiments,
could help to further discriminate the above described clinical
groups. Using YBX1 immunohistochemistry, we observed that those
patients with worse clinical outcome showed TP53TG1 hyper-
methylation and YBX1 nuclear staining, whereas the best PFS val-
ues were found in unmethylated TP53TG1 and cytosolic YBX1
cases (P = 0.001) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The impact of TP53TG1
methylation status in the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients
was also found in primary colorectal cancer tumors from the TCGA
cohort (51). For these cases, TCGA RNA-sequencing data showed
that TP53TG1 methylation was associated with transcript down-
regulation (Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0.0001) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6), that TP53TG1 hypermethylation was significantly associated
with shorter overall survival (P = 0.03) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6), and
that TP53TG1 methylation was an independent prognostic factor of
worse overall survival in Cox proportional hazard regression models
(HR = 5.44, 95% CI = 1.15–25.68, P = 0.032) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Thus, TP53TG1 epigenetic disruption highlights those gastrointes-
tinal malignancies that will be more clinically aggressive. These
findings are consistent with the data obtained from the molecular,
cellular, and mouse models.
Discussion
RNA expression patterns in human tumors that are distorted with
respect to their normal tissue counterparts are one of the most
commonly observed molecular phenotypes of carcinogenesis. Some
of these RNA expression changes, due to genetic and/or epigenetic
defects, are potential driver events of tumorigenesis, whereas others
may be merely downstream bystander events that accompany cell
transformation. Thus, in the expanding field of lncRNAs in cancer,
it is important to distinguish events directly involved in the acqui-
sition and development of the tumorigenic features from those that
may be passengers in the process. One way to do this is to link the
studied lncRNA with a well-defined oncogenic or tumor-suppressor
pathway. In this paper, we have linked the promoter DNA
methylation-associated silencing of the lncRNA TP53TG1 to the
impaired response of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 to DNA
damage that prevents the induction of apoptosis. Thus, the epige-
netic inactivation of TP53TG1 can be considered to be another “hit”
taken by the p53 network in cancer cells, in addition to the molec-
ular disruption of other key elements of the p53 tumor suppressor
and DNA damage response pathway, such as those occurring with
the oncogene MDM2 and the tumor suppressor p14ARF (53, 54).
Another relevant step toward highlighting a functional role for a
lncRNA in cancer cells, in addition to the in vitro and in vivo
growth assays, is the characterization of a bona fide mechanism of
action of the lncRNA with a probable role in tumorigenesis. One
of the most difficult aspects in the field of lncRNA research is
elucidating the exact cellular mechanism used by the molecule in
question (12, 13). Combining RNA pull-down assays and MS, we
have established that TP53TG1 binds and regulates the intracel-
lular localization of the RNA binding protein YBX1, a factor that
has attracted considerable interest among cancer researchers be-
cause it sits at the crossroads of several processes, such as tumor

 progression (37, 38), epithelial–mesenchymal transition (39), me-
tastasis (40), and drug resistance (36, 41, 42). In this article, we have
described how YBX1 nuclear enrichment, mediated by TP53TG1
epigenetic loss, activates the growth-promoting PI3K gene and its
downstream target, the oncoprotein AKT. Interestingly, the story
goes back to the initial p53 link, because AKT activation induces
MDM2 phosphorylation and final increased degradation of the
tumor inhibitor p53. However, many other candidate genes and
pathways could also be affected by the YBX1 aberrant nucleus–
cytosol trafficking induced by the epigenetic loss of TP53TG1, and
these alternative targets warrant further research in this area.
The cellular phenotypes arising upon TP53TG1 CpG island
hypermethylation-associated silencing have implications beyond
the observed molecular chain of events. They can have important
translational consequences for the management of related neo-
plasms. A cancer cell featuring TP53TG1 epigenetic inactivation
has acquired a chemoresistant phenotype affecting a wide reper-
toire of drugs. The DNA methylation-associated silencing of
TP53TG1 is associated with resistance to compounds that damage
DNA. These are commonly used classical chemotherapy drugs such
as doxorubicin, irinotecan, carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin,
which are administered to treat the most prevalent human tumor
types. Furthermore, the loss of TP53TG1 enhances the resistance
to more specific next-generation small molecules such as PI3K and
AKT inhibitors. The existence of this general chemoresistant phe-
notype partly explains why the oncology patients displaying the
aberrant DNA methylation lesion in TP53TG1 have a shorter PFS.
In this regard, the TP53TG1 hypermethylation described here
would not only be an example of a tumor-suppressor lncRNA but
could become a valuable marker in personalized cancer therapy if
other studies were able to validate our findings in large, prospective,
independent clinical trials.
Materials and Methods
Detailed materials and methods are provided in SI Appendix, SI Materials and
Methods. The sequences of all primers and probes used in this study are
listed in SI Appendix, Table S4.
All of the humancolon cancer cell lines usedin this study were purchasedfrom
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), except HCT-116 and DKO, which
were generous gifts from Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Kimmel Compre-
hensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD. The immortalized nontumorigenic HCECs
were kindly provided by Nestec Ltd. (29). The human gastric cancer cell lines
MKN-45, MKN-7, TGBC11TKB, and GCIY were purchased from the RIKEN cell
bank, KATO-III and SNU-1 were from the ATCC, and NUGC3 was from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources. DNA samples from surgically
resected primary tumors were obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of School
of Medicine (Tokyo Medical and Dental University) and from the University
Hospital of Bellvitge–IDIBELL. All patients provided informed consent, and the
study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the
Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute. Genome-wide DNA methylation anal-
ysis was performed with Illumina’s 450K DNA methylation microarray (Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) as previously described (26). Using data from
GENECODE v13 and the lncRNAdb database (55), we identified 280 lncRNAs
included in the 450K array. DNA methylation analyses of candidate sequences
were further validated by Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing and MSP. RACE was
carried out with a SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). The
noncoding nature of TP53TG1 was analyzed by the PhyloCSF comparative ge-
nomics method that yields the CSF and Western blot. The translation capacity of
TP53TG1 was also evaluated in vitro with the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Tran-
scription/Translation System (Promega). RNA expression was determined by
semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions were separated from 1 to 3 × 106 fresh cultured cells before total RNA
and protein isolation (PARIS Kit, Ambion). Single-molecule RNA-FISH was per-
formed using a pool of 28 probes tiling the TP53TG1 RNA coupled to Quasar
570 reporter dye. For stable TP53TG1 overexpression, the cDNA sequence of
TP53TG1 (NR_015381; GRCh38/hg38) was cloned into the pcDNA4/T0 mam-
malian vector (Invitrogen), and cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Silencing of TP53TG1 was performed with 50 nM of specific siRNA
oligonucleotides (Qiagen) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Point muta-
tions were introduced in the TP53TG1 sequence by site-directed mutagenesis
using specific PCR primers and single-strand oligonucleotides. Cell viability and
proliferation were determined by the MTT and colony formation assays. In-
duction of apoptosis was determined by the sub-G1 population percentage,
annexin V staining, activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7, and in situ terminal
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The xCELLigence Real-
Time assay was used to determine invasion and migration. Putative p53 tran-
scription factor DNA-binding sites in the TP53TG1 gene were identified with the
computer algorithm p53MH (56). ChIP was performed as previously described
(22). In silico chromatin interaction was analyzed using publicly available ChIA-
PET data (35). TP53TG1 protein interactors were identified by in-gel digestion
and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
analysis. The catRAPID omics algorithm (44) was used to estimate protein as-
sociations with the TP53TG1 lncRNA. RNA pull-down was performed essen-
tially as described (57). Mouse xenograft and orthotopic experiments were
performed as previously described (31). Statistical analyses were done using
SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS) and GraphPad Prism version 5.04.
