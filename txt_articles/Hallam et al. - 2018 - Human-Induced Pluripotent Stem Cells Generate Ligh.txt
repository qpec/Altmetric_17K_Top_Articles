ABSTRACT
The availability of in vitro models of the human retina in which to perform pharmacological and
toxicological studies is an urgent and unmet need. An essential step for developing in vitro
models of human retina is the ability to generate laminated, physiologically functional, and light-
responsive retinal organoids from renewable and patient specific sources. We investigated five
different human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and showed a significant variability in
their efficiency to generate retinal organoids. Despite this variability, by month 5 of differentia-
tion, all iPSC-derived retinal organoids were able to generate light responses, albeit immature,
comparable to the earliest light responses recorded from the neonatal mouse retina, close to
the period of eye opening. All iPSC-derived retinal organoids exhibited at this time a well-formed
outer nuclear like layer containing photoreceptors with inner segments, connecting cilium, and
outer like segments. The differentiation process was highly dependent on seeding cell density
and nutrient availability determined by factorial experimental design. We adopted the differenti-
ation protocol to a multiwell plate format, which enhanced generation of retinal organoids with
retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE) and improved ganglion cell development and the response
to physiological stimuli. We tested the response of iPSC-derived retinal organoids to Moxifloxa-
cin and showed that similarly to in vivo adult mouse retina, the primary affected cell types were
photoreceptors. Together our data indicate that light responsive retinal organoids derived from
carefully selected and differentiation efficient iPSC lines can be generated at the scale needed
for pharmacology and drug screening purposes. STEM CELLS 2018; 00:1–17
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Hallam and colleagues show herein that generation of retinal organoids from human iPSC is effi-
cient, reliable and scalable. Using statistical models based on factorial experimental design, the
authors have identified starting cell number and nutrient availability as key determinants for
generation of laminated retinal organoids. The differentiation protocol was adapted to a multi-
well plate format which enhanced generation of retinal organoids with retinal pigment epithe-
lium (RPE) and improved ganglion cell development and the response to physiological stimuli.
The authors show that the human iPSC derived retinal organoids are electrophysiologically func-
tional and can be used as a viable alternative to animal models for toxicology testing.
INTRODUCTION
Visual impairment affects 285 million people
worldwide, with 90% of cases arising from chronic
diseases [1]. Approximately 80% arise in the aged
population, and with a continued increase in life
expectancy, the numbers affected by vision loss
are set to rise [2, 3]. As the retina does not readily
regenerate, diseases such as age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP),
and glaucoma cause cell loss and result in
irreversible profound visual impairment. For treat-
ments to be developed, in vitro models of human
retina that encompass all the retinal cell types
and which are electrophysiologically responsive to
light are required to screen novel substances for
pharmacological and toxicological effects. Most
drug studies are currently performed in vivo using
rodent models, but this approach is far from opti-
mal because there are fundamental structural
and functional differences between rodent and
human retina. To date, there are no published

PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
 adequate in vitro models that incorporate the diversity of all reti-
nal cell types and that can be maintained stably in culture for pro-
longed periods of time. Simple models such as organotypic retinal
explants have been prepared from embryonic and postnatal
rodents. However, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) degenerate [4],
photoreceptors do not grow extended outer segments [5], ama-
crine cells are lost gradually over time [6], and the expression of
proteins in the interphotoreceptor matrix is significantly reduced
when compared with normal adult retina [7]. Most animal models
are also limited by anatomical differences such as the absence of
a fovea in all mammals except for simian primates. Other widely
used in vitro cell line models lack efficacy, are variable in morphol-
ogy and limited in the recapitulation of the composition of the ret-
ina [8–10].
Recent studies have shown that organoids generated from
tumors or pluripotent stem cells can compositionally resemble
primary tissue, producing multiple cell lineages while maintaining
the convenience of unlimited expanding capacity. The use of
organoids has been successfully translated in diseases such as
Alagille syndrome, whereby organoids mimic the in vivo disease
pathology [11]. In addition, they have been used in cancer
screening and mapping mutational signatures in CRISPR modified
organoids [12]. The use of human pluripotent stem cells for gen-
erating isolated retinal cell types as well as completely laminated
retina
has
been
published
[13–32].
Three-dimensional
(3D) culture in particular seems to enhance the maturation of
multi-layered or laminated structures, which recapitulate human
retinogenesis and generate transplantable photoreceptors [13,
14, 17, 21, 31, 32]. To date, retinal organoids have not been
extensively used in toxicology or pharmacology screening pro-
grams, largely due to lack of differentiation methods that gener-
ate light responsive 3D retinae closely matching the mature
retina in sufficiently large numbers needed for this type of assay.
In this article, we investigated the ability of five different
human iPSC lines to generate laminated retinae and their
responses to light and other chemical stimuli. We applied statis-
tical design of experiment (DoE) methodology to determine
multiple variables critical for process control and successfully
adapted the differentiation protocol to a 96-well format, which
enables large-scale automation and drug screening. We per-
formed proof of concept studies and investigated the response
of retinal organoids to a known retinotoxic agent (Moxifloxacin)
to validate their usefulness for toxicity screening programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
iPSC lines, WT1 (Female, aged 31) [33], WT2 (Male, aged 68) [34],
WT3 (Female, aged 84) [34], RP (PRPF 31, c.1115_1125del11,
RP11VS iPSC line) [33], and AMD (CFH, rs1061170, F181 iPSC line)
[35] (derived and fully characterized) were cultured with mTeSR1
(Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge, UK) on growth factor
reduced matrigel-coated 6-well plates (Corning, NY). Retinal
organoids were generated by dissociating cells at 90% conflu-
ence with Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
seeding 3,000–12,000 cells into each well of a 96-well lipidure-
coated U-bottom plate (Amsbio, Boston, MA) in 100 μl of
mTeSR1 with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y27632, Tocris, Bristol, UK).
After 2 days, mTeSR1 + ROCK inhibitor was changed to differenti-
ation medium, which comprised 45% IMDM (225 ml), 45%
HAM’s F12 (225 ml), 10% KOSR (50 ml), 1% GlutaMAX (5 ml), 1%
Chemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (11905031; 5 ml), Pen/-
Strep (5 ml; Thermo Scientific, UK) and 1-thioglycerol M6145
(450 μM; Sigma, UK). Medium was changed every 2 days, at day
6 BMP-4 (1.5 nM) was added at day 6 as described in Kuwahara
et al. [36] At day 18, “pooled” retinal organoids were transferred
to ultra-low attachment 6-well plates (Corning, NY) and medium
was changed to maintenance media: DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, Glu-
taMAX (5 ml), 1% N2, Pen/Strep (5 mL), plus 3 μM CHIR99021
(Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge, UK), 5 μM SU5402 (Bio-
techne, Abingdon, UK). At day 24, medium was changed to main-
tenance media minus CHIR99021 and SU5402.
Process control experiments where performed as described
above, with the following modifications in design 1: cell-
seeding number of 6,000, 9,000, or 12,000. KOSR: 5%, 10%, or
15%; chemically defined lipid concentrate: 0.5%, 1% or 1.5%;
1-thioglycerol: 300, 450, or 600 μM; BMP4: 0.75, 1.5, or
2.25 nM. Design 2: cell number: 3,000, 5,500, or 8,000;
CHIR99021: 1.5, 3, and 6 μM: SU5402: 2.5, 5, and 10 μM.
BMP4: 2, 3.5, and 5 nM.
Moxifloxacin (Sigma, Cambridge, UK) was added to the cul-
ture media at concentrations of 50, 100, 300, 700, and
1000 μg/ml with an exposure time of 24 hours.
RNA Extraction and qPCR
About 15–20 retinal organoids were homogenized using a
Dounce Tissue Grinder (Sigma) and RNA was extracted using the
Promega tissue extraction kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the
manufactures instructions. About 1 μg of RNA was reverse tran-
scribed using random primers (Promega). qRT-PCR was per-
formed using a Quant Studio 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) with SYBR Green (Promega). Each primer (listed
in Supporting Information Table S1) was used at a concentration
of 1 μM, and at a ratio of 50:50 for forward and reverse. The
reaction parameters were as follows: 95�C for 15 minutes to
denature the cDNA and primers, 40 cycles of 94�C for 15 sec-
onds followed by primer specific annealing temperature for
30 seconds, succeeded by a melt curve. All primer pairs were
validated on adult human retina. A comparative Ct method was
used to calculate the levels of relative expression, whereby the
Ct was normalized to the endogenous control (GAPDH). This cal-
culation gives the ΔCt value, which was then normalized to
WT1, giving the ΔΔCt. The fold change was calculated using the
following formula: 2−ΔΔCt. Statistical significance analyses were
evaluated using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
Immunohistochemistry
Retinal
organoids
were
collected
at
days
35,
90,
and
150, washed with PBS for 10 minutes and then fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Retinal organoids were washed
again with PBS before being placed in 30% sucrose overnight.
Retinal organoids were placed into cryogenic molds and
immersed in optimum cutting temperature (OCT). About 10 μM
slices were sectioned on a Leica cryostat (CM1850). Cut sections
were blocked in 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) and 10% NGS
(Thermo Scientific) in PBS for 1 hour. This solution was removed
and replaced with antibody diluent (0.3% Triton-X-100, 1% BSA
in PBS) with applicable antibody dilution (Supporting Informa-
tion Table S2) at 4�C overnight. Sections were washed three
times in PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies
for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed again

Generating Light Responsive Retinal Organoids from iPSC
 as stated previously and mounted in Vecta-shield (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA) with Hoechst 33342 (1:1000, Thermo Scientific)
or DAPI (Sysmex, 1:1000). Images were captured using Nikon
A1R confocal (resonant, invert; Nikon, Japan) and Zeiss Axio
ImagerZ2 equipped with an Apotome2 (Zeiss, Germany).
Quantitative Assessment of Retinal Determination in
3D Culture
Laminated optic vessels and pigmented patches were recorded
in both 96-well formats and in 6-well plates using high-
resolution (3,200 dots per inch) scanned images (Epson Perfec-
tion V500, Japan) at day 35, 90, and 150 of differentiation, con-
firmed with representative brightfield imaging (Supporting
Information Fig. S1; AxioVert, Zeiss Germany). In addition,
immunostaining of representative examples was carried out
with (AxioImager with Apotome, Zeiss Germany) with RPE, pho-
toreceptor and ganglion/amacrine cell markers to determine
presence of at least two recognizable layers in the retinal orga-
noids. Criteria for counting were as follows: the presence of
bright neuroepithelium at the apical edge of retinal organoids
showing immunostaining for two different retinal layers were
counted as neural retina (NR), pigmented patches showing
immunostaining for RPE markers were counted as RPE and orga-
noids with both neural retina and RPE as NR + RPE. Organoids in
which the retinal structure was not clear to the operator and
could not be confirmed with immunostaining were counted as
undefined. Counts of organoids with and without RPE and/or
neural retina were performed by two separate investigators and
did not deviate significantly from one another. In total, 288 orga-
noids per condition (single or pooled) were analyzed bringing
the total number of organoids scored per iPSC line to 576, repre-
senting three biological replicates. ANOVA analysis showed a sig-
nificant difference between the iPSC lines to generate retinal
organoids with or without RPE at days 35, 60, and 90 of differen-
tiation (p < .05). The same analysis performed within the same
cell line (biological replicates) showed the variability to be insig-
nificant at all differentiation timepoints examined (p > .05).
LDH Cytotoxicity Test
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit,
Thermo Scientific) released by dead/dying cells was detected by
incubating cell culture supernatant with lactate, which is con-
verted to pyruvate in the presence of LDH and NAD+. NAD+ is
converted to NADH Diaphorase and uses NADH to reduce tetrazo-
lium salt (INT) to a red formazan product that can be measured
at 490 nm using a Varioskan Lux (Thermo) plate reader. Validated
positive control was supplied in kit and suspended in 1% BSA.
Electrophysiological Recordings
Experimental procedures on neonatal mice were approved by
the ethical committee at Newcastle University and carried out
in accordance with the guidelines of the UK Home Office, under
control of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Orga-
noids and neonatal retinas were transferred to 33�C artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM):
118 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2,
10 glucose, and 0.5 L-Glutamine, equilibrated with 95% O2 and
5% CO2. Organoids were opened longitudinally and placed, with
the presumed RGC layer facing down, onto the 4096 channel
MEA, flattened with a translucent polyester membrane filter
(Sterlitech Corporation, Kent, WA). The organoids were allowed
to settle for at least 2 hours. Mice aged between postnatal days
(P) 10–12 were dark-adapted overnight and sacrificed by cervi-
cal dislocation. Retinas were isolated from the eye cups and flat-
tened for MEA recordings [39]. Recordings were performed on
the BioCam4096 multielectrode array (MEA) platform with Bio-
Chips 4096S+ (3Brain GmbH, Lanquart, Switzerland), integrating
4096 square microelectrodes in a 64 × 64 array configuration.
To reliably extract spikes from the raw traces, we used a
quantile-based event detection [37] and single-unit spikes were
sorted using an automated spike sorting method for dense,
large-scale recordings [38]. Statistical significance and firing rate
analyses were evaluated using Prism (GraphPad) and MATLAB
(MathWorks, Natick, MA). Light stimuli were projected as
described previously [39]. To yield maximal responses to light
stimuli in organoids, broad white (high photopic) light pulses
(pulsed light: 200 ms, 217 μW/cm2 irradiance, 1 Hz) were
flashed for 5 min onto the organoids following recording spon-
taneous activity in the dark for 5 min. We also used full field
stimuli (in the mesopic light range) that switched from light to
dark (0.5 Hz, 30 repetitions, 4 μW/cm2 irradiance) to calculate
peristimulus time histograms (bin size = 25 ms), allowing us to
isolate light responses from spontaneous activity in neonatal
retinas. To sort RGC responses according to their main response
polarity, we measured the relative amplitude of ON (during
light; A1) and OFF (during dark; A2) responses and calculated
the bias index (BI) defined as (A1 − A2)/(A1 + A2) [58]. We used
the BI to split the organoid and neonatal mouse retinal
responses into OFF (BI −1 to −0.15) and ON cells (BI 0.15–1).
The drugs cGMP (8-Bromoguanosine 30,50-cyclic monopho-
sphate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and GABA (γ-aminobutyric
acid, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were puffed in the recording
chamber (final concentrations, cGMP 100 μM, GABA 125 μM)
and activity was recorded continuously for 4 minutes, starting
at 2 minutes before the puff.
Process Control
DoE methodology (Minitab v18 Software, Minitab Inc., State Col-
lege, PA) was applied to evaluate the effects of key culture
medium components on lineage indicative gene expression. An
initial full factorial design, with duplicate center points to estimate
error, was applied to screen the effects of initial cell density
(6,000 and 12,000), 1-thioglycerol (300 and 600 μM), BMP4 (0.75
and 2.25 nM), KSR (5% and 15%), and Lipids (0.5% and 1.5%). A
subsequent duplicated ½ fraction factorial design with center
points was applied to evaluate influential factors BMP4 (2 nM,
5 nM) and cell density (3,000 and 8,000) at improved ranges iden-
tified from the initial design and in conjunction with CHIR99021
(1.5 and 6 μM) and SU5402 (2.5 and 10 μM). DoE responses were
CT for the target gene normalized to GAPDH (CT GAPDH – CT Tar-
get Gene). In each case, multiple regression was applied to fit a
general linear model for each response followed by model reduc-
tion through hierarchically removing predictor terms that had a
statistical significance of p ≥ .05 (ANOVA). Residual plots were
evaluated for normal distribution and no systematic trends with
respect to experimental order or fitted value.

 and lead citrate) and imaged on a Philips CM100 TEM (Philips,
Minato-ku, Japan).
Secretome Analysis
To process secretome samples, supernatant samples were run
on a 4–12% SDS PAGE and treated with silver nitrate (AgNO3),
lanes representing untreated control supernatant, moxifloxacin
(100 μM) treated supernatant were excised, then separated into
10 sections. Gel pieces were destained (15 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and
50 mM Na2S2O3) then proteins reduced with 10 mM dithiothrei-
tol and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. Proteins were
digested by the addition of trypsin added at a ratio of 30:1 (pro-
tein:trypsin) and incubated for 16 hours at 37�C. Peptides were
extracted from the gel pieces with increasing concentrations of
acetonitrile and the resulting peptide solutions were concen-
trated by vacuum evaporation and desalted using home packed
C18 stage tips [40]. Each peptide sample was analyzed in a sep-
arate LCMS experiment using a Thermo RSLC Nano HPLC system
coupled to a Sciex 6600 mass spectrometer. Peptides were
loaded onto a 300 μm Prepmap trap column (Thermo) before
being resolved on a 23 cm 75 μm ID home-packed analytical
column containing Dr Maisch 3 μm particle size stationary
phase. Peptides were injected online into the mass spectrome-
ter using data-dependent acquisition. Survey scans were per-
formed over an m/z range of 400–1200. From each survey, the
30 most intense ions were selected for MS/MS. Precursors were
fragmented with a rolling collision energy, based on the charge
state of the peptide ion. Total cycle time was 1.7 seconds.
Raw data was converted to .mgf peaklists using MSconvert
[41]. These were then searched against the human proteome
(Uniprot, entry version 139 updated 07/07/2017) and cRAP
(version 01/01/2012) [42] with the reversed fasta files for both
using X!Tandem [43]. The following parameters: search toler-
ance MS, 20 ppm. MS/MS fragment ions 30 ppm, fixed
modification of +57.0215@C. The following modifications
were considered in
a second
pass search (refinement),

Output files were loaded into Perseus [45] for statistical evalua-
tion and hierarchical clustering comparison, then a visual heatmap
representation of the clustered matrix was generated.
RESULTS
iPSC Lines Generate Retinal Organoids with Variable
Efficiency
To investigate the ability of fibroblast-derived iPSC lines to gen-
erate retinal organoids, we differentiated three fully character-
ized iPSC lines from unaffected donors (referred thereafter as
WT1, WT2, and WT3) [34], one iPSC line from a donor with age
related macular degeneration (referred thereafter as AMD) [35]
and one iPSC line from a subject with retinitis pigmentosa
(referred thereafter as RP [33] using the induction-reversal
protocol developed by Kuwahara et al. in hESC for cogeneration
of neural retina and RPE [36]. We applied two small changes to
this protocol, including addition of Y26732 (10 μM; Rho kinase
inhibitor) for the first 48 hours of differentiation to enhance
aggregate formation and U-shape bottom plates which are bet-
ter suited for imaging and used by other groups for retinal dif-
ferentiation of iPSCs [32]. The relative organoid size (Supporting
Information Fig. S2) and the emergence of laminated neural
retina and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) was assessed at
several time points during the differentiation process (Fig. 1A).
Formation of RPE spheres which were hollow inside and com-
posed of a single layer of RLBP1 positive hexagonal pigmented
RPE cells (Fig. 1A) was observed during the differentiation of
some of the iPSC lines. At day 35, the efficiency of generating
retinal organoids and the organoid size was variable between
the iPSC lines (Fig. 1B and Supporting Information Fig. S2). Fur-
thermore, no RPE was detected at this stage in organoids from
any of the five iPSC lines (Fig. 1B). This variability was corrobo-
rated by the gene expression analysis which indicated that the
iPSC lines which were more efficient at giving rise to retinal
organoids (WT1 and WT2) had higher expression of photorecep-
tor progenitor (VSX2), photoreceptor precursor (CRX and
RCVRN), and retinal ganglion cell (MATH5) markers compared
with the less efficient iPSC lines (Fig. 1C). Although no apparent
RPE was observed in the organoids from any of the five iPSC
lines at this time point, the expression of RPE marker (MITF)
was higher in the two iPSC lines which were more efficient at
giving rise to RPE (WT3 and AMD) during the course of differen-
tiation. Immunocytochemical analysis of retinal organoids at this
time point showed that the large majority of cells situated in
the apical layer of the retinal organoids were positive for the
retinal progenitor marker VSX2. A smaller percentage of cells
were also positive for CRX, which indicates the emergence of
photoreceptor precursors alongside presumptive RGC and/or
amacrine cells (marked by HuC/D expression) in the basal layer
(Fig. 1D). Recoverin, a marker of photoreceptor precursors and
a subset of bipolar and ganglion cells was observed at the apical
layer and less so in the basal layer of the organoids.
By day 60, RPE was observed more prominently in two of the
iPSC lines (WT3 and AMD), both of which showed the highest pro-
pensity to form RPE spheres and retinal organoids with RPE
(Supporting Information Fig. S3). The relative size of organoids
was also variable at this time point (Supporting Information
Fig. S2), most likely reflecting the heterogeneous nature of orga-
noids across the iPSC lines. By day 90, we observed a marked
increase in the ability of iPSC to give rise to organoids containing
neural retina with and without RPE (Fig. 2A), albeit the relative
organoid size remained variable (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
At this time point, there were significant differences in gene
expression between iPSC lines for all markers studied (Fig. 2B).
The iPSC lines which showed the highest commitment to form ret-
inal organoids (WT1 and WT2; Fig. 2A) still showed higher expres-
sion of photoreceptor progenitor and precursor markers (VSX2,
CRX, and RCVRN) and developing horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine
cell marker (PROX1; Fig. 2B). The expression of RPE marker (MITF)
and RPE and Müller Glia cell marker (RLBP1) was the highest in
the organoids generated from the two iPSC lines with the highest
commitment to RPE (WT3 and AMD; Fig. 2B). These two lines also
showed the lowest expression of retinal ganglion cell marker
(MATH5), which correlates with their lower efficiency in forming
retinal organoids (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemistry analysis showed

 prominent VSX2 in the apical layer and BRN3B in the basal layers
of the retinal organoids, indicating formation the presence of pho-
toreceptor progenitors and RGCs, respectively (Fig. 2C). Cells with
elongated morphology reminiscent of developing photoreceptors,
showing RCVRN and CRX coexpression, were clearly observed at
this time point in the apical layer of the retinal organoids (Fig. 2C).
HuC/D positive cells were observed in the basal layer of the orga-
noids as well as adjacent to the outer nuclear like layer, suggesting
the development of amacrine and ganglion cells.
By day 150, 100% of the organoids for three of the iPSC
lines (WT1, WT2, and RP) developed neural retina (with and
without RPE) and RPE spheres (Fig. 3A); however, a fraction of
organoids for the AMD and WT3 iPSC line at this stage did not
develop neural retina like structures or RPE spheres and were
classified as undefined. At this time point, there were no sig-
nificant differences in organoid size (Supporting Information
Fig. S2). It is of interest also to note that in all three lines
derived from unaffected controls (WT1, WT2, and WT3), the
increase in organoid size occurred till day 90 with negligible
increase occurring between day 90 and day 150 (data not
shown); however, this was not the case for the disease iPSC
lines (RP and AMD) which showed a continued increase in size
throughout the differentiation process (AMD iPSC line) or only
between day 90 and 150 of differentiation (RP iPSC line). At

Generating Light Responsive Retinal Organoids from iPSC
 this time point, the expression of photoreceptor precursor
(CRX and RCVRN), rod precursor (NRL), cone (OPN1SW,
OPN1MW, and OPN1LW), rod (RHO) as well as horizontal,
amacrine, and bipolar cell markers (PROX1, AP2-α, and LHX1)
were still higher in the WT1 and WT2 lines (Fig. 3B). The
expression of RPE marker (MITF) as well as Müller glia and
RPE marker (RLBP1) remained highest in WT3 and AMD lines
(Fig. 3B) which were more efficient at giving rise to RPE
spheres. The retinal organoids derived from these two iPSC
lines also showed the lowest expression of MATH5, a finding
that most likely reflects the fact that a lesser percentage of
organoids generated from these lines were able to form retinal
organoids at this time point.
Immunocytochemistry analysis at day 150 showed that reco-
verin (a marker of photoreceptor and bipolar cells) expression
was detected in the apical surface of the retinal organoids

 (Fig. 3C,D). Furthermore, cells with coexpression of RCVRN and
CRX were found in the outer layer of the organoids (Fig. 3C).
Nonetheless, a few cells coexpressing both markers were also
located in the presumptive inner nuclear layer which is suggestive
of interkinetic nuclear migration of photoreceptor progenitors
noted during retinal development [46]. HuC/D, a marker of gan-
glion and amacrine cells was found in the basal layer of the retinal
organoids (Fig. 3D). High magnification of Recoverin positive cells
highlighted the photoreceptor morphology with the presence of
outer like segments and axons stratifying towards the putative
outer plexiform layer (Fig. 3E–G). The photoreceptors residing in
the apical layer were immunopositive for ARL13B expression
(data not shown), indicating formation of connecting cilia and
beginning of outer segments, which were marked in rod photore-
ceptors by the expression of Gα transferase 1 (Fig. 3H, arrows).
The photoreceptor marker, OPN1MW/LW, was expressed in
cones located on the apical site as well as in progenitors toward
the center of organoids (Fig. 3I,J). Rhodopsin, a rod marker, was
also located apically within the organoids (Fig. 3K). Meanwhile,
another cone marker, OPN1SW (short wave) was expressed exclu-
sively at the apical surface (Fig. 3L,M). Presynaptic active zone
protein bassoon and vGlut1 a protein associated with synaptic
vesicles showed colocalization at putative photoreceptor axon ter-
minals (Fig. 3N, arrows). Syntaxin, another protein located at pre-
synaptic active zones at nerve endings was observed in two
locations, beneath the photoreceptor layer and basally indicating
the formation of putative outer and inner plexiform like layers
(Fig. 3O, arrows). CRALBP (also known as RLBP1), a marker of
Müller glia cells spanned the entire organoid structure (Fig. 3P).
PKC-α positive cells were also detected beneath the photorecep-
tor layer in the organoids suggesting the emergence of rod bipo-
lar cells (Fig. 3Q, arrows). PROX1, Prospero homeobox protein 1, a
transcription factor involved in development, and shown to be
expressed in the developing horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine
cells, was detected in the middle layer of the organoids in two
locations: adjacent to the presumptive outer nuclear layer as well
as adjacent to the developing ganglion cell layer (Fig. 3R). AP2-α
is a marker of amacrine cells and belongs to a family of AP-2 tran-
scription factors, which respond to retinoic acid and are consid-
ered intrinsic to retinal development [47]. AP2-α positive cells
were observed in the middle layer of day 150 organoids (Fig. 3S).
Collectively, these findings suggest that the formation of an inner
nuclear like layer in these retinal organoids.
In summary, our data suggest variabilities between iPSC
lines with reference to overall efficiency in generating retinal
organoids, kinetics of differentiation and the development of
RPE within the organoids themselves. This variability cannot be
related solely to disease pathology as it was encountered also
between iPSC lines from unaffected individuals. Despite such
variability, by month 5 of differentiation, all iPSC lines were able
to generate laminated retinal organoids with well-formed outer
nuclear like layers containing photoreceptors with inner seg-
ments, connecting cilium and outer like segments.
Adaptation of Retinal Differentiation Protocol to
96-Well Plate Format
To enable large-scale automation and drug testing using retinal
organoids, we tested the adaptability of retinal differentiation
protocol to 96-well plates (Fig. 4A). We used for these experi-
ments iPSC lines derived from unaffected individuals and among
these, we chose WT1 and WT2 iPSC as they showed similar
efficiency and kinetics of differentiation using the 3D retinal
protocol described above. Assessment of organoids at day
150 of differentiation indicated that single culture conditions
enhanced the ability of wild-type iPSC to form retinal organoids
with RPE (Fig. 4B). In accordance, quantitative RT-PCR analysis
indicated a higher expression of RPE marker (MITF; Fig. 4C). No
significant differences were observed in the expression of pho-
toreceptor precursor markers (RCVRN), cone opsin markers
(OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW) and rod markers (RHO),
bipolar cell marker (PKC-α), and horizontal, amacrine, and bipo-
lar cell marker (PROX1) between organoids maintained all
together (pooled) or as single organoids (single, Fig. 4C) at day
150 of differentiation. In contrast, the expression of AP2-α, an
amacrine cell marker showed a lower expression in single orga-
noid cultures, whilst the expression of RGC cell markers (MATH5
and RBPMS) was significantly higher in the single organoid cul-
tures (Fig. 4C), thus suggesting that development of these two
retinal lineages was affected by single-cell organoid culture pro-
tocol. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed the
presence of photoreceptors at the apical layer of the organoids,
containing mitochondria rich inner segments (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S4A,B), connecting cilia, and formation of an outer
limiting like membrane. We also observed the presence of pho-
toreceptor outer segments with clear striations inside, indicative
of disc membranes. These features were observed in both
pooled and single organoid cultures.
Photoreceptor-Driven Activity in Retinal Organoid RGCs
Presumed RGCs from (WT) pooled and single retinal organoids
at day 150 responded either with an overall increase or
decrease in spiking activity when exposed to high-intensity
pulsed light (Fig. 5A–D). These responses, however, were too
sluggish to allow clear detection of synchronization with the fast
light pulses (Fig. 5A,B magnified views). Light responses from
25 representative RGCs (exhibiting at least 25% increase or
decrease in spiking activity after the stimulus onset) are illus-
trated in Figure 5A–D, revealing response patterns similar to
those normally seen in immature ON and OFF RGCs in the
developing retina (see next paragraph). Quantification of all
light-induced RGC responses (falling within the 25% criterion)
showed no significant differences between single or pooled
organoids
(Mann–Whitney
U
test,
Supporting
Information
Table S3). Interestingly, light had a stronger effect on the spiking
activity of organoids derived from WT cultures than in those
derived from AMD iPSC line (Supporting Information Fig. S4C–
E). To ascertain that the light responses we recorded from orga-
noids are driven by phototransduction in photoreceptors rather
than by intrinsically photosensitive RGCs [49, 50], we recorded
responses following puffs of cGMP onto the organoids. cGMP is
a secondary messenger in the phototransduction cascade that
gates Na+-permeable channels in the outer segments of photo-
receptors. Puffing 8-br-cGMP, a membrane permeable analogue
of cGMP, in the recording chamber triggers Na+ influx and depo-
larizes photoreceptors, thus mimicking the dark current. Orga-
noid RGCs responding to the 8-br-cGMP puff with decreased
spiking activity are thus presumably photoreceptor-driven ON
RGCs (Fig. 5E,F). There was no significant difference between
single and pooled ON RGCs in terms of reduced firing rate in
response to cGMP puffs (Supporting Information Table S3). We
also recorded from cells with increased firing rate following
cGMP puffs. These cells presumably are OFF RGCs (Fig. 5G,H).

Generating Light Responsive Retinal Organoids from iPSC
 Single OFF RGCs showed a significantly (p = .0079) higher activ-
ity compared with OFF RGCs from pooled organoids. GABA sig-
naling emerges early during CNS development, it is depolarizing
at very early developmental stages and can even induce spiking
in RGCs. Later it switches to become the main inhibitory neuro-
transmitter. Hence, responses to GABA puffs are indicative of
emerging functional neural networks. We also recorded changes
in firing rate (increase or decrease) following GABA puffs both in
single and pooled organoid RGCs (Supporting Information
Table S3). Overall, numerous RGCs from single and pooled reti-
nal organoids exhibited clear responses to light, cGMP and
GABA stimulation, suggesting rudimental but functional retinal
circuitry in both types of organoids.
The aforementioned light responses from single and pooled
organoids were too slow to synchronize with the temporal struc-
ture of the fast light pulses. Instead, they exhibited sluggish
kinetics reminiscent of immature RGC light responses during the
perinatal period or around the time of eye opening [39, 49, 50].
Here, we compared the light responses of single and pooled
organoids (Fig. 6A–D) with the responses recorded from mouse
RGCs at postnatal day (P)10–12 (Fig. 6E–J). P10 is when mouse
RGCs become first driven by light
originating from the
photoreceptor–bipolar cell axis [49–52], and P12 is the time of
eye opening (Fig. 6E–J), roughly corresponding to birth in
humans. The neonatal vertebrate retina is characterized by the
presence of spontaneous waves of activity sweeping across the
RGC layer, disappearing at eye opening in mouse [48], hence it
can be challenging to isolate weak nascent light responses within
these large barrages of spontaneous bursting activity. Therefore,
we used peristimulus time histograms averaged across many
stimulus repetitions to average spontaneous bursting out, reveal-
ing the presence of weak underlying light-driven responses. Sin-
gle and pooled organoid RGCs showed a slight increase in
activity either after stimulus onset (Fig. 6A,C) or offset (Fig. 6B,
D), reflecting ON and OFF RGCs (it is worth noting that these
organoid responses are weaker than those presented in Figure 5
because they were triggered at much weaker light intensities).
These responses were weaker than comparable PSTHs from ON
(Fig. 6E,G,I) and OFF RGCs (Fig. 6F,H,J) recorded from neonatal
retinas, but at least in terms of their sluggish response kinetics,
they were reminiscent of responses seen just before eye opening
(P10–11; at P12 responses already become much brisker), sug-
gesting that the basic retinal machinery (phototransduction cas-
cade and synaptic circuitry) is present and relatively similar in
organoids and in the maturing retina.
Using Multifactorial Design to Improve Retinal
Organoid Generation
A two-level factorial experimental design (Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S5) was conducted at day 35 of differentiation in WT2
using a 96-well format throughout, to determine the key vari-
ables in early stage commitment. Eight genes of interest marking
various retinal cell phenotypes (RCVRN, CRX, RPE65, MITF,
MATH5, PROX1, VSX2, and AP2-α), which emerge during differ-
entiation from pluripotent cells, were assessed. Variables were
filtered for those that had a statistically significant (p ≤ .05) influ-
ence on the gene expression responses and a magnitude of
effect greater than 0.2 cycle threshold (CT; corresponding to a
15% increase or decrease in gene expression). Of the predictor
variables evaluated, the cell number was by some margin the
most influential on differentiation outcomes across all the
responses with a universally statistically significant (p ≤ .01 in all
cases) and negative correlation with expression (other than with
AP2-α, which was positive). Higher concentrations of bone mor-
phogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) had a positive influence on MATH5
and RPE65 (p ≤ .01 in both cases), whereas higher levels of lipids
had a negative, and knockout serum (KSR) a positive effect on
CRX and RCVRN (p ≤ .001). These effects are summarized in Sup-
porting Information Table S4A. Several 2-way interactions were
also identified. BMP4 and cell number were nonindependent in
their effect on RPE65, RCVRN, PROX1, and MATH5. Lipids and
cell number were nonindependent in their effect on RPE65,
whereas lipids and BMP4 were nonindependent in their effect
on RECOVERIN. The nature of these two-way interactions are
summarized in Fig. 7A–F and Supporting Information Table S4B.
Given the dominance of cell number on the magnitude of
effects a further experimental design was evaluated with a lower
cell number range and a higher level of BMP4 in combination with
two further factors, the canonical/β-catenin Wnt pathway agonist
CHIR99021 and fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor SU5402,
known inducers of RPE formation [36, 53]. The range of delta CT
values for each target in experiment 2 was different, particularly
for MATH5 and VSX2, which had an extended lower range of out-
comes (Supporting Information Table S5A). Once again, cell num-
ber was the dominant influence; however, this time the effect was
reversed with all responses being positively influenced by a higher
cell number (other than AP2-α, which was negative). Expression of
VSX2 and MATH5 were particularly inhibited at lower cell num-
bers. This indicates that the optimum cell number is likely close to
the 6000–8000 range. Furthermore, a higher level of BMP4 now
negatively influenced MATH5, MITF, and CRX, suggesting 2.25 nM
had been close to the optimum. Of the newly introduced factors,
only CHIR99021 met the criteria for significant effect on responses,
with a relatively large magnitude negative influence on MATH5
and RCVRN expression, and a lesser negative effect on CRX and
PROX1. These correlations are summarized in Supporting Informa-
tion Table S5A. Several two-way interactions were also identified
between CHIR99021 and cell number as shown in Figure 7G,H and
Supporting Information Table S5B. Based on this analysis, we
determined the optimal conditions for production of retinal orga-
noids containing RPE to be as follows: cell seeding density of

iPSC-Derived Retinal Organoids Respond to
Moxifloxacin in a Similar Manner to the Adult
Mouse Retina
To assess the response of retinal organoids to known neuro-
toxicants, we performed proof of principle experiment by
exposing day 150 organoids derived from the unaffected control
iPSC (WT2) to moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum
fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is active against both gram-
positive and gram-negative bacteria and commonly used in the
treatment of a range of eye and respiratory infections. The
mechanism by which moxifloxacin is retinotoxic is not fully
understood; however, a correlation between lipid peroxidation,
protein photodamage, and cellular phototoxicity has been
observed, indicating that this compound may exert effect in the
cellular membranes [54]. Doses of 100–500 μg given intracamer-
ally in humans after cataract surgery have not been associated
with toxic effects [55, 56]. However, in mice [57], a dose-
dependent effect of moxifloxacin has been established with
100 μg/ml and below having no effect on cellular toxicity and
cell proliferation, whereas doses of 500 g/ml were reported to
result in focal necrosis in the outer nuclear layer (photoreceptor
degeneration and loss of photoreceptor inner and outer seg-
ments) as well as milder effects on the inner nuclear layer.
Incubation of retinal organoids with 100 μg/ml moxifloxacin
led to vacuous apertures to appear in the apical region where
photoreceptors reside and the adjacent presumptive inner
nuclear layer (Supporting Information Fig. S6). Lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH), a cytosolic enzyme that is released when plasma
membranes are damaged, revealed a linear dose-dependent
toxicity effect of moxifloxacin (Supporting Information Fig. S6B).
Caspase 3, a protease which is involved in executing apoptosis,
was expressed in a greater number of cells in retinal organoids
exposed to 100 and 300 μg/ml moxifloxacin (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S6C). Gene expression analysis was carried out to
identify the affected retinal cell types (Supporting Information
Fig. S6D), this showed a significant reduction in the expression
of photoreceptor precursor markers (RCVRN and CRX) and ama-
crine cell marker (AP2-α) as well as a significant increase in the
expression of DNA damage markers DR5 and p21. No changes
were observed in the expression of RPE marker (MITF; Support-
ing Information Fig. S6D); however, the expression of bipolar cell
marker (PKC-α), horizontal cell marker (LHX1), RGC marker
(RBPMS), and Müller glia cells (RLBP1) was increased, most
likely reflecting a change in retinal cell subpopulations within
these organoids upon the significant decrease of photoreceptor
and amacrine cells. Secretome analysis identified a number of
differentially
regulated
proteins
(Supporting
Information
Fig. S6E), notably pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and
complement component 3 (C3) proteins which are secreted
from RPE cells, which not only affirms their presence but also
indicates a response to drug treatment. Increases in PEDF and
C3 may be a response to inflammatory and stress responses
[58], thus increased C3 secretion and deposition may be due to
increased number of dead and damaged cells. Macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was also secreted following
treatment, MIF has previously been shown to be released by
retinal ganglion cells following neural progenitor cell death [59].
Thus, the secretome data may indeed suggest that damage and
death of the photoreceptors may be exacerbated by the
secreted proteins from other retinal cell layers. Enrichr analysis
using the GO biological processes (2017b) database, highlighted
protein repair and rhodopsin metabolic processes indicating
photoreceptor involvement (Supporting Information Fig. S6F).
Together, our results suggest moxifloxacin primarily affects the
photoreceptors and amacrine cells of iPSC derived retinal
organoids.
DISCUSSION
Generating reproducible 3D laminated retina from a large range
of human pluripotent stem cells with high efficiency and at large
scale is crucial for developing ocular disease models and provid-
ing a safe test bed for bioactive compounds. In this study, we
assessed the ability of five iPSC lines to generate laminated and
light-sensitive retinal organoids using a published protocol [36]
which is based on the activation of BMP for a defined time win-
dow to enable generation of neural retina followed by a revers-
ible inhibition of GSK3β and FGFR to promote the emergence of
RPE. Our data indicate that all iPSC were able to generate lami-
nated retinal organoids with or without RPE. The iPSC-derived
retinal organoids were responsive to light, cGMP and GABA at
day 150 of differentiation. Although previous studies showed
that transplantation of pluripotent photoreceptor stem cells
repairs vision in rodents, only two studies to date have demon-
strated the presence of light responses in human pluripotent
stem cell derived retinal organoids. Zhong et al. showed that
only 2 out of 13 randomly selected photoreceptors responded to
light after 6–7 months of differentiation [20], and their photo-
sensitivity was much lower than in normal, adult primate photo-
receptors. A more recent study has reported responses to light
(530 nm) in 4 out of 25 neurones from 10 organoids between
7 and 9 months of maturation, suggesting the establishment of
functional neuronal networks in these structures [66]. In the pre-
sent study, thanks to the very high-recording yield of our large-
scale, high-density multielectrode array system, we were able to
successfully record light responses in over 1,300 cells (616 cells
from single organoids and 710 cells from pooled organoids).
From these cells, 229 (~37%) in the single and 179 (~25%) in the
pooled conditions responded to light with at least 25% increase
in spiking activity. The kinetics of these responses were reminis-
cent of early light responses recorded from RGCs in the develop-
ing mouse retina, suggesting that network connectivity was in
reasonably advanced stages of development in these organoids.
The intensity of the responses was lower than in the developing
retina, possibly due to the relatively small numbers of outer seg-
ment disks. Together, our findings suggest that the iPSC-derived
retinal organoids generated in this study contain not only more
functionally mature neurones than in previous studies but that
maturation also occurred faster than previously reported.
Using statistical DoE methodology, we were able to deter-
mine variables critical for the generation of retinal organoids,
which indicated starting cell number, BMP4, KSR, and lipids to be
the main constituents in successful formation of neural retina
and CHIR99021, SU5402, and starting cell number in RPE genera-
tion. The optimizations performed in this study with the WT iPSC
lines could be applied to any potential iPSC line to aid in the gen-
eration
of

organoids.

Generating Light Responsive Retinal Organoids from iPSC
 transferred this differentiation protocol to 96-well plates for the
whole duration of the experiment, allowing for the scalability,
and automation required for toxicology and pharmacology
studies.
Variabilities in the ability of iPSC lines to respond to differ-
entiation protocols are now widely reported in the literature
and thought to be influenced by many factors including per-
turbed signaling pathways and chromatin regulators [60–62].
Methylation status also plays a dominant role on differentiation
propensity [63]. Our own work and that of others have shown
that differences in the activity of key signaling pathways such as
TGFβ and BMP signaling can have a large impact on the ability
of human iPSC to respond to differentiation protocols [64, 65].
A growing number of studies to date have used human iPSC
lines to generate retinal organoids via different protocols, show-
ing that those do indeed efficiently recapitulate retinogenesis
[17, 20, 66]; however, the line to line variability has not been
fully addressed to date. Our study compared five different iPSC
lines from unaffected subjects and those with AMD and inher-
ited RP and showed that significant differences exist with refer-
ence to kinetics of differentiation and efficiency of generating
retinal organoids. Some of the iPSC lines were able to generate
organoids with apically positioned photoreceptor progenitors
and basally located ganglion and/or amacrine cells as early as
day 35 of differentiation; however, in some others, these were
just beginning to develop by day 60 of differentiation, thus indi-
cating different kinetics which was closely paralleled by gene
expression analysis. Some of the cell lines that were slow in
their early differentiation steps caught up by day 150 with the
fastest cell lines in terms of overall differentiation efficiency;
nonetheless, the gene expression analysis indicated that the
fastest iPSC lines had the highest expression of cones, rods, hor-
izontal, amacrine, and bipolar cells which most likely reflects a
more advanced differentiation stage. The large majority of reti-
nal organoids generated by the iPSC lines did not contain any
pigmented RPE patches and even for the lines that did generate
retinal organoids with RPE this comprised a small fraction of
total organoids (maximum 9%). In addition to retinal organoids,
human iPSC lines did also generate pigmented hollow RPE
spheres, which have not been described to date in the litera-
ture. Again, we observed a large variance with some iPSC lines
generating as much as 61% RPE spheres and some others none
at all. Overall, the ability to give rise to RPE either as part of ret-
inal organoid or on its own was variable between the lines and
corroborated closely by the expression of RPE marker (MITF)
and RPE and Müller glia cell marker (RLBP1). Together, our data
highlight the variability of iPSC lines to generate retinal orga-
noids and the need for fully characterizing a large number of
iPSC lines carefully to select those that can efficiently differenti-
ate to laminated retinal organoids.
Starting cell number of retinal organoids has been described
as an influential factor for the success of retinal organoid gener-
ation
[31].
Previous
studies
have
used
ranges
between
1,000–9,000 [32] and 9,000–12,000 [14, 36], reporting that
lower seeding numbers produced fewer distinct optic vesicles,
higher cell numbers develop necrotic cores by day 10 [32], sug-
gesting 3,000 to be the optimum number. To assess the role of
seeding cell number together with other important growth fac-
tors and small molecules used in the differentiation protocol,
we performed statistical DoE. We tested cell seeding numbers
between 3,000 and 12,000 per aggregate, and found that these
numbers played the biggest single effect on the measured out-
comes, with a predicted optimal range between 6,000 and
8,000 cells. BMP4 supplementation also had a significant role
on gene expression, initially in Design 1, higher BMP4 concen-
trations were more favorable for RPE and RGCs development;
however,
increasing
the
concentration
further
in
Design
2 appeared detrimental, thus indicating 2–2.25 nM range to be
optimal. These results corroborate previously published data
indicating that high-BMP4 concentrations lead to reduced differ-
entiation of photoreceptors [63]. Removing [32] or reducing
KSR [14] has been shown to inhibit the formation of optic vesi-
cles, whereas higher concentrations may lead to caudalization.
In our design, 15% proved to be the optimal concentration, pro-
moting development of photoreceptor precursors as revealed
by CRX and RCVRN expression. The process control highlighted
that only AP2-α (amacrine cell maker) was elevated at higher
seeding density, while MATH5 expression increased at lower
densities. Likewise AP2-α was decreased in single organoid cul-
tures, whereas MATH5 was increased, indicating that amacrine
cells perhaps benefit from lower nutrient availability, while RGCs
have a greater need for nutrients based on media availability
per cell, thus highlighting a possible link between nutrient avail-
ability and cell fate. This corroborates previously published data
showing that nutrient depletion causes a block in proliferation
and differentiation of retinal progenitors in the ciliary margin
zone [64]. A major advantage of the statistical design was the
ability to assess compounding effects, with lower cell numbers
and higher concentrations of BMP4 increasing the gene expres-
sion of photoreceptors, RGCs and RPE. However, the lower cell
numbers and higher concentrations of BMP4 had the converse
effect on amacrine cells. These insights highlight that optimal
growth conditions would be a compromise between the
requirements of the many different cell types present in the ret-
inal organoids.
To enable automation of iPSC differentiation and to test
scalability, we maintained half of the retinal organoids in the U
bottomed 96-well plates (one retinal organoid per well) and
compared those to organoids maintained in 6-well plates using
an identical nutrient regime in both populations. Single orga-
noid conditions enhanced generation of retinal organoids with
RPE, encouraged better RGC differentiation and response to
cGMP. However, the expression of all other retinal cell
markers, the efficiency of retinal organoid generation and light
responses were similar between the two conditions, thus vali-
dating the 96-well plate protocol for prolonged (up to
150 days) differentiation to retinal organoids.
To validate the application of iPSC derived retinal orga-
noids, we went on to compare their response to moxifloxacin,
an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat eye infections and
which has been shown to affect the outer and inner nuclear
layer in mouse retina, at a dose of 500 μg/ml [57]. When
applied to iPSC derived retinal organoids moxifloxacin had a
clear dose-dependent effect, shown by LDH, gene expression
and secretome data, with higher dosages leading to disintegra-
tion of the organoids (data not shown), resulting in reduced
RNA transcript recovery. In our experiments, 300 μg/ml and
above had the greatest effect on gene expression, whereas in
the mouse doses of 500 μg/ resulted in degeneration of photo-
receptors and mild disruption of the inner nuclear layer [57].
These differences in sensitivity to moxifloxacin may be because
iPSC-derived retinal organoids are more similar to fetal retina

 in terms of cellular composition and transcription profiles [67].
Despite these differences, our gene expression and immunocy-
tochemical analysis identified the photoreceptors and ama-
crine cells to be the key affected cell types, indicating a similar
response to the in vivo adult mouse retina [57].
CONCLUSION
In summary, our data show a significant variability between
different iPSC lines in their overall efficiency to generate light
responsive retinal organoids, in the kinetics of differentiation
and ability to generate RPE either as part of organoids or by
itself; thus, it is important to carefully select iPSC lines that
respond robustly to the differentiation process and can be
used for compounds screening and clinical trials. We also show
that the differentiation process is highly dependent on nutri-
ent availability. Through statistical design experiment, we have
determined the optimal application of key growth factors and
small molecules as well as cell seeding density to generate
light and drug responsive laminated retinal organoids in a for-
mat that allows scalability and automation.
