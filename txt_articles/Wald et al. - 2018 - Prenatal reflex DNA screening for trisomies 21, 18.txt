Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the screening
performance of prenatal reflex DNA screening for trisomies 21
(T21), 18 (T18), and 13 (T13) as part of a routine service at five
hospitals.
Methods: Women who accepted screening had a first-trimester
combined test (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, free
β-human chorionic gonadotropin, nuchal translucency interpreted
with maternal age). Those with a risk of having an affected
pregnancy ≥ 1 in 800 were reflexed to a DNA sequencing test using
stored plasma from the original blood sample, thereby avoiding the
need to recall them.
Results: Of 22,812 women screened (including 106 with affected
pregnancies), 2,480 (10.9%) were reflexed to DNA testing; 101/106
were detected (69/73 T21, 24/25 T18, and 8/8 T13), a 95% detection
rate (95% confidence interval 89–98%) with four false positives
(0.02%, 95% confidence interval 0.00–0.05%). The odds of being
affected given a positive result were 25:1. Of the 105 screen-positive
pregnancies, 91 (87%) had an invasive diagnostic test. Reflex DNA
screening avoided up to 530 invasive diagnostic tests compared
with using the combined test.
Conclusion: Reflex DNA screening was successfully implemented
in routine care, achieving a high detection rate, low false-positive
rate,
and,
consequently,
greater
safety
with
fewer
invasive
diagnostic tests than other methods of screening.

INTRODUCTION
Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy
18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
using plasma (cell-free) DNA analysis offers substantial
improvements over conventional screening methods, which
are based on ultrasound and serum markers.1,2 However, DNA
analysis is complex and relatively costly, and has a technical
failure rate of a few percent, particularly when the percentage of
cell-free DNA from the placenta is low. For these reasons DNA
analysis has not generally been adopted as a method of primary
screening. A two-step method has been proposed, in which the
first-trimester combined test (based on the measurement of
nuchal translucency, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A,
free β-human chorionic gonadotropin, and maternal age) is
followed by a DNA screening test (also known as a noninvasive
prenatal test, NIPT) if the combined test risk estimate is above
a specified level. Women are recalled for the DNA test. This
approach (“contingent screening”) has been the subject of
various studies.3–6 A weakness with this approach is the need to
recall women for counseling and to obtain an extra blood
sample for the DNA screening test. This recall is likely to make
the women acutely anxious; some may choose to proceed
directly to an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling with
the associated risks to the pregnancy. To avoid causing this
recall-induced anxiety, while still achieving a high screening
performance, we proposed a modified screening method: reflex
DNA screening.7,8 The method also avoids the clinical dilemma
regarding the management of pregnancies with test failures. In
reflex DNA screening an additional plasma sample is obtained
at the time of blood collection for the combined test, and
retained for potential DNA testing if the woman has a
combined test risk of a trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or trisomy 13
pregnancy exceeding a prespecified cutoff. The DNA test is
automatically triggered (i.e., a reflex response) without having
to recall women for counseling to obtain an extra blood sample
for the DNA test. In these women a combined test is not
reported as a separate test but the information obtained from
the
combined
test
markers
is
used
together
with
the
information gained from the DNA test to calculate the overall
risk, which is reported. The first-trimester combined test is thus
never “positive.” If the combined test risk is below the
prespecified cutoff level used to trigger a DNA analysis the
combined test result is reported as negative. The screening
protocol is shown in Figure 1. This protocol has the advantage
that each woman has only one screening test, i.e., either a
combined test, which is always reported as negative, or a DNA
test that includes information from the combined test markers,
which can be reported as positive or negative.

 Here we describe the completed implementation project
based on 22,812 unselected pregnancies screened between
1 April 2015 and 31 August 2016.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Five hospitals participated in the prenatal reflex DNA
screening implementation project: the Royal London, Whipps
Cross, Newham, Kingston, and Liverpool Women’s. Women
who agreed to have a screening test for trisomies 21, 18, and
13 (the three disorders referred to as affected pregnancies)
received a leaflet describing the reflex DNA screening
approach. Blood for the serum and plasma samples was
collected in a plain tube and an anticoagulant tube (Streck,
Omaha, NE, tubes formulated to stabilize blood cells) between
11 and 13 completed weeks of pregnancy (three pregnancies
were tested in the 10th completed week of pregnancy). The
combined test was performed on the serum sample using
Roche
(Basel,
Switzerland)
pregnancy-associated
plasma
protein A and free β-human chorionic gonadotropin assays.
Combined test risks were calculated separately for trisomy 21,
trisomy 18, and trisomy 13 using the αlpha software (Logical
Medical Systems, London, UK). The software was validated
against independent software produced at the Wolfson
Institute of Preventive Medicine.
If the combined test risk for any of the three disorders was
≥ 1 in 800 (chosen from previous modeling to identify about
10% of unaffected pregnancies),7 the previously collected
plasma sample was used for the DNA test using massively
parallel shotgun sequencing. Up to 21 October 2015 this was
carried out by Sequenom in San Diego, CA (715 pregnancies),
using an Illumina (San Diego, CA) platform.9,10 Thereafter,
the DNA tests were performed at the Wolfson Institute of
Preventive Medicine (1,765 pregnancies) using an Ion Proton
Thermo
Fisher
(Waltham,
MA)
platform
supplied
by
Premaitha, Manchester, UK, with associated reagents, chips,
and assay software.11
The plasma sample was usually sufficient for a second DNA
analysis if the first failed. If both analyses failed, women were
invited to attend again to provide another blood sample. This
was again divided into two portions, one plasma and one
serum, the plasma sample for a DNA test, and the serum
sample to measure second-trimester quadruple test markers—
alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (Roche),
unconjugated estriol, and inhibin A (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA)—if the DNA failed. These were used together with the
first-trimester markers as an integrated test. A risk ≥ 1 in 150
was considered a positive result.
Results from Sequenom and the Wolfson Institute DNA
analyses were reported as the risks of having a pregnancy with
trisomies 21, 18, and 13. From 22 October 2015 two changes
were made: (i) the risks reported were refined by combining
the DNA likelihood ratios with the combined test risk, and (ii)
a reported risk cutoff of 1 in 150 was used (standard in the
United Kingdom) instead of 1 in 100 as used by Sequenom.
Data on whether the pregnancy was affected by trisomy 21,
18,
or 13 were
obtained
from the
prenatal
screening
coordinator at each participating hospital. Among pregnancies
with positive DNA results the following were excluded from
our estimates of screening performance: (i) 12 pregnancies that
ended in a miscarriage or intrauterine death (two trisomy 21,
three trisomy 18, seven without a karyotype); (ii) 3 pregnancies
that had a termination of pregnancy without karyotype, a
decision influenced by findings seen on the ultrasound scan;
and (iii) 1 pregnancy that was lost to follow-up. In addition,
seven women did not complete the screening protocol because
they declined to return for an extra blood collection, four of
whom chose to have an amniocentesis directly (three trisomy
21, one unaffected). The detection rate was defined as the
proportion of affected pregnancies with a positive screening
result. The false-positive rate was defined as the proportion of
unaffected pregnancies with a positive screening result.
Research ethics committee approval was not required as the
project was an audit of the implementation of prenatal reflex
DNA screening as a clinical service.

 were 73 trisomy 21, 25 trisomy 18, and 8 trisomy 13
pregnancies (combined trisomy rate 0.46%).
Figure 2 is a flow diagram showing the results of the
reflex DNA screening program according to whether the
pregnancies were affected or unaffected. The figure shows that
10.5%
of unaffected pregnancies and
97%
of affected
pregnancies had a combined test risk ≥ 1 in 800 and conse-
quently were reflexed to the DNA test. Following the DNA
test, 101 affected pregnancies (69 trisomy 21, 24 trisomy 18,
and 8 trisomy 13) were screen positive, yielding a detection
rate of 95% (95% confidence interval, 89–98%, see Table 2).
Four unaffected pregnancies were screen positive, yielding a
false-positive rate of 0.02% (95% confidence interval, 0.00–
0.05%, see Table 2). The odds of being affected given a
positive result from the screening program were 25:1 (positive
predictive value of 96.2% (25/26)). Of the 101 women with
affected pregnancies who were screen positive, 88 (87%) had
an invasive diagnostic test, and of these 83 (94%) had a
termination. Of the four women with a false-positive result,
three had an invasive diagnostic test. Included in the overall
results were data on 381 twin pregnancies; 39 were reflexed to
a DNA test, 4 had positive DNA results, and all were affected
with trisomy 21. The median duration from blood sampling
to informing a woman of a positive screening result was
11 days (interquartile range 9 to 13). Negative results were
mailed within 2 weeks.
Table 2 shows the observed performance of reflex DNA
screening compared with screening using the combined
test only with a risk cutoff of 1 in 150, as is standard in the
United Kingdom. Reflex DNA screening had a detection rate
of 95%, 14 percentage points higher than screening using the
combined test alone, a 100-fold reduction in the false-positive
rate (0.02% vs. 2.42%), and an odds of being affected given a
positive result 150 times higher (25:1/1:6 = 150).

 Supplementary Table 1 online shows the proportion of
pregnancies that would have been reflexed to a DNA test
according to the combined test risk cutoff level. As the cutoff
level is increased, the proportion of pregnancies reflexed to a
DNA test decreases, for example from 10.9% using a
combined
test
cutoff
1
of
in
800
(97%
for
affected
pregnancies and 10.5% for unaffected (see Supplementary
Table 1)) to 2.8% (81% of affected pregnancies and 2.4% of
unaffected pregnancies) using a 1 in 150 cutoff.
Supplementary Table 2 shows the screening performance
using different reflex combined test risk cutoff levels. The
performance depends on the combined test risk cutoff used. If
DNA testing had been restricted to women with a combined
test risk of ≥ 1 in 150, the detection rate would be 79%, a 16–
percentage point reduction compared with using a 1 in 800
cutoff. The false positive rate is, however, unchanged.
Figure 3 shows the DNA technical failure rates, indicating
failures arising in the first and second aliquots of the
initial blood collection and the first and second aliquots of
an extra blood collection. This analysis was limited to the
1,756 pregnancies tested at the Wolfson Institute, where
the necessary records on test failure and retesting were
maintained. In 8.7% (152/1,756) of pregnancies there was a
test failure using the first aliquot. An extra blood collection
was
required
in
1.8%
of
pregnancies
(1.7% + 0.1%
in
Figure 3). There were no reported adverse outcomes in
pregnancies in which DNA testing failed. There was a
suggestion that maternal weight was higher in women who
had a repeat blood collection (median 69 vs. 65 kg), but this
was not statistically significant (P = 0.055). Obtaining a
second blood sample for a repeat DNA test was not more
common earlier in pregnancy than later.
DISCUSSION
This implementation project showed that routine reflex DNA
screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 achieved a detection rate
of 95% with a false-positive rate of 0.02% and an odds of being
affected given a positive result of 25:1. Only 2 in 10,000 women
with unaffected pregnancies had an invasive diagnostic test. No
other method of prenatal screening for these disorders has such
a high detection rate for such a low false-positive rate. While the
detection rate is a few percentage points lower than with
universal DNA screening,9,10,12 the greater proportional reduc-
tion in the false-positive rate results in a greater discrimination
between affected and unaffected pregnancies.
Chitty et al.3 described a similar two-step screening protocol
but, instead of performing a reflex DNA test on a previously
collected plasma sample, women with a combined test risk ≥ 1
in 1,000 were recalled for counseling with the offer of a DNA
screening test or, if the risk was ≥ 1 in 150, the choice of a
DNA screening test or an invasive diagnostic test. Twelve
percent of women were recalled in this way and informed that
they were in this higher risk group, and 18% chose to proceed
directly to an invasive diagnostic test. This increases the false-
positive rate and consequently also increases the number of
invasive diagnostic tests in women with unaffected pregnan-
cies; this is avoided with the reflex method. We can be
confident that the reflex DNA screening strategy benefits
women by reducing the chance that they will be made acutely
anxious. Measuring anxiety levels directly in such circum-
stances is, in our view, neither appropriate nor necessary;
imparting potentially distressing information when this can
be completely avoided is self-evidently of benefit.

 The technical DNA test failure rate is a problem with DNA
screening. The reflex DNA approach with 10% of women
having a DNA test means that, among all women screened,
about 2 per 1,000 (10% × 1.8%) needed to have an extra blood
collection, a much lower recall rate than with contingent DNA
screening without reflexing.3 The 68% reduction in the failure
rate between tests using the first and second aliquot from the
initial blood sample indicates that the failure is mainly
technical, and not due to factors associated with the woman
and her pregnancy. As the technical aspects of the test improve,
the initial failure rate is likely to fall significantly. With the
reflex DNA screening approach, all pregnancies have a
screening result and in this implementation project only 3
pregnancies out of 2,480 reflexed to a DNA test (0.12%) had an
integrated test after a DNA test failure using the second aliquot
of the extra blood collection.
Compared with established screening methods, reflex DNA
screening reduces the clinical workload involved in counseling
women with screen-positive results; in the implementation
audit 105 (101 + 4 from Table 2) women required counseling
following a screen-positive result whereas 635 (549 + 86)
would have required counseling if the combined test alone or
the two-step (recall) method 3 had been used. The two-step
method 3 will further increase the clinical workload because in
addition to counseling after a positive combined test result,
some women would need counseling again after a positive
DNA test result.
Women identified as being screen positive in the imple-
mentation audit had a high odds of having an affected
pregnancy (25:1, see Table 2), which is likely to reduce
uncertainty over the decision to have an invasive diagnostic
test (1:6 with the combined test alone, see Table 2). Reflex
DNA screening can potentially achieve cost savings because of
the reduction in the number of invasive diagnostic tests
needed and the reduced need for patient counseling associated
with the two-step approach. These savings could be used to
pay for the reflex DNA screening tests to secure the clinical
benefits. Depending on local costs, a combined test cutoff
level could be selected so that the costs of the screening
program are affordable and cost-effective. As the cost of reflex
DNA screening declines, the combined test cutoff can be
lowered, resulting in an increase in the proportion of women
having a reflex DNA test and hence an increase in the
detection rate.
In this implementation project Streck tubes were used to
reduce white blood cell lysis and cellular DNA leakage into
the plasma of whole blood before plasma separation. The
effect of such leakage would be to diminish the fetal fraction
and possibly increase the proportion of failed tests. The use of
inexpensive ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes
rather than the more expensive Streck tubes would lead to
cost savings. Such a switch should be acceptable as there is
evidence that the separation of plasma from cells up to at least
48 hours after blood collection does not significantly degrade
the sample needed for DNA analysis.13,14
Integrating information from combined test markers with
sequencing information from DNA analysis enhances screen-
ing performance. While the improvement in screening
performance is small, with suitable interpretive software this
can readily be implemented without additional cost. A source
of false positives associated with the DNA test arises from
maternal mosaicism,15 confined placental mosaicism,16 and
maternal copy-number variation.17 Though they are rare
occurrences, this problem is mitigated in reflex DNA
screening. For example, if 10% of women have a reflex
DNA test the problem is reduced 10-fold. A practical point
affecting any reflex DNA screening program is that the
invasive
diagnostic
test
should
be
amniocentesis,
not
chorionic villus sampling, which will replicate the confined
placental mosaicism observed in the maternal plasma.
With universal DNA screening the detection rate would
have been 99%, but an extra blood sample would be required
for a repeat DNA test in 1.8% of pregnancies based on the
failure rate in pregnancies tested at the Wolfson Institute (see
Figure 3). With the reflex approach, in which 10% have a
DNA test, the detection rate is 95% with a 10-fold lower rate
of requesting an extra blood collection (0.18%) than universal
DNA screening. There is a trade-off between small incre-
mental increases in detection for increasing proportions of
women required to provide an extra blood sample. In every
100,000 pregnancies undergoing reflex DNA screening, based
on a 10% reflexing proportion, 180 would be recalled for an
extra blood collection compared with 1,800 such return visits
with universal DNA screening.
The reflex DNA policy makes prenatal screening for
trisomies 21, 18, and 13 safer than other policies because of
the reduced false-positive rate. Taking the risk of fetal loss due
to an invasive diagnostic test as 1 in 100,18 among 1 million
unaffected pregnancies that undergo reflex DNA screening,
200 would have a diagnostic amniocentesis and about 2 of
these would result in a fetal loss due to the diagnostic
procedure. If all pregnant women were screened using the
reflex DNA approach, this would amount to eight procedure-
related unaffected fetal losses in the United States and about
two in the United Kingdom, each year. If the fetal loss rate
from an invasive diagnostic test is less than 1 in 100, these
estimates of the number of procedure-related fetal losses
would be even lower. As well as improved safety, 19 out of 20
pregnancies with trisomy 21, 18, or 13 are detected by reflex
DNA screening.
The benefits of reflex DNA screening arise mainly from the
substantially lower false-positive rate compared with other
methods of screening, the avoidance of recall-induced anxiety
associated with non-reflex contingent screening, and a
detection rate similar to universal DNA testing. These clinical
benefits, together with the reduced cost compared with
universal DNA testing, make the reflex approach a preferred
method of screening. The results of this implementation
project show that the benefits of reflex DNA screening were
achieved in routine screening practice.
