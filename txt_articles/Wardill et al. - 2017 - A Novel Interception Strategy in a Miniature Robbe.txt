In Brief
Robber flies are aerial predators. Here,
Wardill, Fabian, et al. show that the tiny
robber fly Holcocephala fusca attacks a
detected prey reactively but proactively
changes its speed and direction when the
prey is within 29 cm. They also show that
the very small object detection threshold
of 0.13� is supported by a striking visual
fovea.

SUMMARY
Our visual system allows us to rapidly identify and
intercept a moving object. When this object is far
away, we base the trajectory on the target’s location
relative to an external frame of reference [1]. This pro-
cess forms the basis for the constant bearing angle
(CBA) model, a reactive strategy that ensures inter-
ception since the bearing angle, formed between
the line joining pursuer and target (called the range
vector) and an external reference line, is held con-
stant [2–4]. The CBA model may be a fundamental
and widespread strategy, as it is also known to
explain the interception trajectories of bats and fish
[5, 6]. Here, we show that the aerial attack of the
tiny robber fly Holcocephala fusca is consistent
with the CBA model. In addition, Holcocephala fusca
displays a novel proactive strategy, termed ‘‘lock-
on’’ phase, embedded with the later part of the flight.
We found the object detection threshold for this
species to be 0.13�, enabled by an extremely special-
ized, forward pointing fovea (�5 ommatidia wide,
interommatidial angle D4 = 0.28�, photoreceptor
acceptance angle Dr = 0.27�). This study furthers
our understanding of the accurate performance that
a miniature brain can achieve in highly demanding
sensorimotor tasks and suggests the presence
of equivalent mechanisms for target interception
across a wide range of taxa.
RESULTS
Aerial Attack Strategy
In our study of the aerial hunts of the robber fly Holcocephala
(Figure 1), we considered whether its behavior is consistent
with the constant bearing angle (CBA) model (Figure S1). We
tested this on flies in their natural habitat by presenting a range
of beads (diameter 1.3, 2.9, and 3.9 mm) on a fishing line, whose
speed was controlled by a stepper motor (Figure 1B; Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). We recorded the flies’
behavior with two high-speed video cameras and reconstructed
their flight trajectory in three dimensions. Consistent with the
CBA model, we found that when pursuing a bead moving at
constant speed, the range vectors were close to being parallel
across most of the trajectory: for 80% of the flight time, the
absolute difference between each range vector and the trajec-
tory median range vector was on average less than 3� (Figures
2A1–2A3; n = 63 attacks to a 1.3 mm bead). By applying propor-
tional navigation, the guidance law associated with the CBA
model [4, 7], a pursuer can control the necessary steering com-
mand to null any change in the velocity of the target, thereby
keeping the range vectors parallel and actively maintaining the
CBA (Figures S1G and S1H). We tested the CBA mechanism
of Holcocephala by decelerating or reversing the bead during
the attack (Movie S1). We found that Holcocephala compen-
sates for bead trajectory changes and actively keeps the range
vectors parallel (Figures 2B1–2B3; n = 4 attacks to a 1.3 mm
bead), consistent with achieving a CBA through proportional
navigation.
One surprising finding was that the latter part of Holcocepha-
la’s pursuing trajectory was distinctly curved. This was most
apparent when the targeted bead traveled toward the front of
the animal and Holcocephala took off with a ‘‘head-on’’ collision
course but ultimately intercepted the bead while flying back-
ward (Figure 2C1; seen in 22 of the 63 analyzed trajectories
toward the 1.3 mm bead). Under a CBA strategy, compen-
satory flight alterations are necessary if the prey alters its velocity
(direction, speed, or both), but since the targets were presented
with constant velocity, the fly’s change in direction was not
elicited by the target. Could Holcocephala simply have mis-
calculated the heading necessary for a straight interception or
perhaps failed to attain the speed necessary to intercept with
such a heading? This is unlikely, as extending the initial Holcoce-
phala trajectory along the velocity vector attained just before the
change in heading (Figure 2C1, turquoise broken line) shows that
Holcocephala would have been very near the interception point
(minimal distance 2.9 ± 0.4 cm, mean ± SE, n = 22). Presumably
this small error could have been easily corrected during the
rest of the attack. Nonetheless, the observed curved trajectory

 added to the total interception time on average 132 ± 7 ms
(mean ± SE) until contact, which is a substantial 27% ± 1% of
the total flight time (mean ± SE, n = 22).
To understand what induced the change in heading, we first
looked at its timing. Our analysis showed that the change in
heading was accompanied by a deceleration. We therefore
took the first time point in the trajectory where a deceleration
was detected as an objective measure for the start of the
change in heading. By fitting the data with a sigmoidal curve
(trajectories to beads of all three sizes in which a clear deceler-
ation was detected were included; n = 86), we found that inde-
pendent of the starting distance, the maximum distance be-
tween target and fly at which the change occurred was 29 ±
4 cm (95% confidence bounds; R2 adjusted = 0.73; Figure 2C2).
We also found that shortly after the change in heading, Holco-
cephala fixed its forward velocity vector slightly above that of
the bead (Figure 2D). Our results reflect a ‘‘lock-on’’ process,
initiated by information that becomes available once the fly is
within �29 cm of the target. Here, we use ‘‘lock-on’’ to refer
to the phase during which the fly has a new heading and the
speed is fixed to a value slightly higher than that of the prey.
The different mechanisms that could underlie this behavior are
addressed in the discussion.
Minimum Behavioral Discrimination of a Moving
Target—Single Object Threshold—and Acuity
Parameters of Holcocephala’s Fovea
The five longest target detection distances in our CBA experi-
ments that lead to a successful catch of the 1.3 mm bead
were > 53 cm (for example, Movie S2), and at such distances
the bead subtended no more than 0.12�–0.14� on the retina.
Therefore, the minimum single object threshold resolved by
Holcocephala’s visual system must be as small as �0.13�. The
Holcocephala eye has an ommatidial lattice with an excessive
gradient in facet size, which indicates the presence of a fovea
with an extreme degree of functional regionalization. We there-
fore investigated the internal anatomy, to further elucidate the
retinal adaptations that provide the necessary spatial visual per-
formance driving the fly’s pursuit behavior. Sectioning the Holco-
cephala eye revealed a reduced curvature of the frontal cornea
as well as flattening of the basement membrane. The extremely
enlarged frontal ommatidia have facet lenses with extended
focal lengths that focus incident light into unusually slender rhab-
domeres (Figure 3). These specializations are known to optimize
the spatial resolution of fly eyes, thus creating an area of high
acuity, a fovea [8].
Crucial measures for the spatial acuity of a compound eye are
the photoreceptor acceptance angle, Dr, and the interommati-
dial angle, D4, the angle between the optical axes of neighboring
ommatidia. The photoreceptor acceptance angle can be esti-
mated from the ratio of the rhabdomere diameter (Dr) and the
facet lens’s focal length (f). Anatomical measurements yielded
Dr = 0.92 ± 0.13 mm (Figure 3C). Using the hanging drop method
with cleaned corneas in the eye region with the largest facet
lenses (Figure 3D), the focal length was found to be f = 190 ±
4 mm, hence yielding a very small photoreceptor acceptance
angle: Dr = 0.28 ± 0.04�. Measurement of the interommatidial
angle with the preferred pseudopupil method [9] was problem-
atic due to Holcocephala’s dense eye pigmentation, and there-
fore we considered the unique property of fly eyes where sets
of six photoreceptors located in six adjacent ommatidia pool
their signals in one cartridge of the lamina, the first optical gan-
glion below the retina. This neural superposition principle dic-
tates that the interphotoreceptor angle, the angle between the

 visual axes of the photoreceptors within one and the same
ommatidium, equals the local interommatidial angle. Yet, in a
detailed study on a number of fly species, Pick [10] demon-
strated that the interphotoreceptor angle is actually �20% larger
than the interommatidial angle. The interphotoreceptor angle in
an ommatidium equals the ratio of the distance between adja-
cent rhabdomeres and the focal length of the facet lens. From ul-
trathin cross-sections of the eye region with the largest facet
lenses (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we found
that the interrhabdomere distance was Di = 1.15 ± 0.16 mm,
thus yielding the interphotoreceptor angle Di /f = 0.35� ± 0.05�,
or, applying Pick’s [10] correction, the interommatidial angle
becomes D4 = 0.28� ± 0.04�.

Arrangement of Interommatidial
Angles and Direction of Visual Axes
in the Fovea
To understand the distribution of the vi-
sual axes across the fovea, we acquired
two-photon microscopy images of the fovea region, yielding
3D anatomical stacks of the eye fovea’s anatomy (Movie S3).
The fovea appeared to be �5 ommatidia wide, with diameter
of the facet lenses 70–78 mm (Figures 4A and 4B) and interom-
matidial angles D4 = 0.40� ± 0.19� (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures
S2 and S3; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The inter-
ommatidial angles deduced above (D4 = 0.28� ± 0.04�) are within
this range. The two-photon microscopy images further demon-
strated that the central ommatidia of the acute zones in the
two eyes have virtually parallel visual axes, meaning that Holco-
cephala has a binocular view of the world (Figure 4E). In sum-
mary, the behavioral performance that we measured (>53 cm
interception distances and �0.13� object threshold) is supported

 by the fine spatial resolution (0.28�) provided by the specialized
fovea.
DISCUSSION
We have investigated the predatory attack of the robber fly
Holcocephala fusca and found that this species generates an
interception course using a constant bearing angle strategy
and applying maximum acceleration to quickly get closer to
the prey. It is not surprising that Holcocephala utilizes a CBA
strategy during most of its flight, as this reactive strategy enables
compensation for (1) unexpected changes in the target’s velocity
and (2) uncertainties about the perceived location, size, and
speed of the target when absolute depth cues are absent (Fig-
ure S4). Even humans, who arguably have higher computational
brain power, rely on a CBA to solve similar tasks [1]. This indi-
cates that the CBA strategy is a robust way to intercept targets
when sensory information is limited, independent of the process-
ing power available. To further confirm the use of proportional
navigation, future studies will need to embed this guidance law
in a control architecture that can match entire trajectories. It is
also of importance to note that the use of a CBA reactive strategy
does not exclude other guiding principles from being applied.
For example, during their interception flights, dragonflies use
both reactive and proactive motor commands [11]. It is therefore
of interest that once Holcocephala is within �29 cm of the target,
it implements a heading and speed change. The presence of
such a lock-on phase has not yet been described in any other
flying animal. Although the lock-on strategy extends the total
flight time (Figure 2), lowering the final flight speed needed for
interception and extending the time over which Holcocephala
may catch the prey is likely a highly effective adaptive behavior,
consistent with the priority to ensure highest success rates in the
face of sensorimotor delays and errors. The resulting strategy is
similar to that of a baton pass in a relay race: a pass between two
runners with similar direction and velocity is more likely to be
successful than one between two runners passing each other
in opposite directions.
What mechanisms could explain the trigger of the lock-on
phase? It is possible that the lock-on phase is driven by invariant
properties of the image, and not by actual distance estimation.
For example, the escape responses of locusts, frogs, fruit flies,
and crabs to a looming stimulus occur after the target reaches
a certain angular size threshold [12–15]. However, when testing
the lock-on phase by offering beads with different sizes,
we found that at the moment the lock-on phase was initiated,
the angular size of the target varied significantly (large bead:
1.23� ± 0.66�, medium bead: 0.81� ± 0.22�, small bead:
0.52� ± 0.67�, mean ± SD; n = 14, 9, and 63, respectively;
p = 0.001 ANOVA). Therefore, the trigger for the lock-on phase
is unlikely to be a specific subtended angular size. Nevertheless,
similar to flies initiating deceleration prior to landing [16], Holco-
cephala may have used as the trigger the angular size of the
object over its rate of expansion. This ratio, often referred to as
optical tau [17], provides an estimate for time to contact and
can be used as a threshold for initiation of a motor command
with appropriate timing [18]. However, the Holcocephala attack
violates two conditions that must be met for optical tau to be
reliable: constant approach speed and symmetrical head-on
approach [16]. Moreover, optical tau obtained from a target sub-
tending a small size is unreliable [19] because the calculation
depends on the perceived expansion rate. At the maximum
distance at which the lock-on phase is initiated (�29 cm), the
1.3 mm bead subtends �0.26�. With a foveal interommatidial
angle of 0.28�, the bead will be detected by at most two omma-
tidia. Although it is conceivable that the rate of change in light in-
tensity falling on a single ommatidium may act as an ‘‘expansion’’
parameter, to our knowledge, animals performing aerial pursuits
do not exploit the contrast change in a single light detector as a
reliable cue to calculate time to contact. Likewise, by translating
or pivoting, an array of parallel sensors can provide depth and
range information [20], and a similar mechanism cannot be
excluded without further analysis.

 Alternatively, distance estimation via stereopsis could underlie
the trigger of the lock-on phase in Holcocephala. Stereopsis is
the reconstruction of depth from the disparity in the two ocular
images due to the distance between the eyes [21]. If the visual
fields of both eyes overlap sufficiently, the stereopsis range is
solely dependent on the resolution of the retina and the distance
between the forward-facing foveas [22]. Indeed, short range
stereopsis has been demonstrated in mantids [23–25], and
extended stereopsis has been predicted in mantid and dragonfly
larvae with stereopsis ranges 46 and 26 cm, respectively [26].
Holcocephala also has a binocular field of view (Figure 4E). Given
that the largest Holcocephala sample in our collection has an in-
ter-fovea distance of 1.3 mm, with an interommatidial angle D4 =
0.28� the limit of the stereopsis range is 26 cm. Given the small
photoreceptor angle of Dr = 0.27�, it may be feasible that Holco-
cephala uses depth cues provided by stereopsis to trigger the
lock-on phase. Stereopsis at such range would require that the
target be foveated, and it is possible that the head movements
exhibited by Holcocephala prior to launching an attack serve
such purpose. Whether or not Holcocephala uses time-to-con-
tact acquired from monocular or binocular cues, the process
bears parallels to the strategies employed by humans. For
instance, when carrying out a long range interception, humans
use both optical tau [27] and binocular cues [28] to improve the
performance of reaching and grasping movements, and such
prehensile movements form the second phase of a given task.
The existence of a localized area of high resolution in com-
pound eyes, also called acute zone, dorsal zone, or love spot,
is well documented among insect species that depend on target
tracking for survival or mating [29], but the Holcocephala fovea
clearly provides an extreme case. For example, the �20 foveal
ommatidia occupy �20% of the eye volume (Figure 3) and
span �0.1% of the eye’s visual space (angular range < 4.5�; Fig-
ure 4). In summary, our behavioral results of Holcocephala and
the anatomical and optical data of its eyes demonstrate the
extremely specialized visual capacities of a very small robber
fly. Our findings may provide the basis of bioinspired guidance
systems in miniature, aerial and autonomous vehicles, where
maximum performance with minimum size is highly desirable.
