OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the prevalence and correlates of current synthetic 
cannabinoid (SC) use among high school seniors in the United States.
METHODS: Monitoring the Future, an annual nationally representative survey of high school 
seniors, began querying current (30-day) SC use in 2014. Data were examined from the 2 
most recent cohorts (2014–2015; N = 7805). Prevalence of self-reported use was examined 
and differences in demographics and recency and frequency of other drug use was 
compared between current marijuana-only users and current SC (plus marijuana) users 
using χ2 and generalized linear model using Poisson.
RESULTS: We found that 2.9% of students reported current SC use; 1.4% of students (49.7% of 
users) reported using SCs on ≥3 days in the past month. SC users were more likely to report 
more recent (and often more frequent) use of lysergic acid diethylamide, cocaine, heroin, 
and/or nonmedical use of opioids compared with marijuana-only users. Compared with 
current marijuana-only users, SC users were more likely to report lower parent education 
(P < .05) and current use of a higher number of illegal drugs other than marijuana (Ps < 
.001). Students using SCs ≥10 times in the past month were more likely to be boys, frequent 
marijuana users (Ps < .01), African American, and users of multiple other illegal drugs (Ps < 
.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SC use is typically part of a repertoire of polydrug use, and polydrug use is less 
prevalent among marijuana-only users. Current SC users are at risk for poisoning from use 
of the newest generation of SCs and from concurrent drug use.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Synthetic 
cannabinoids are potent new psychoactive 
compounds that can result in adverse health 
outcomes, and marijuana users are at high risk for 
use. Researchers have examined use among high 
school students, but research is lacking regarding 
current (past 30-day) use.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: This is the first nationally 
representative study in which current use of 
synthetic cannabinoids is examined. In this study, 
we found that 3% of high school seniors reported 
current use, and current users also tend to be 
current users of other drugs.

 Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), also 
known as SC receptor agonists, 
form a heterogeneous group of 
psychoactive substances that bind 
to one of the 2 known cannabinoid 
receptors.1 Although some of 
these compounds may resemble 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the 
main psychoactive component in 
marijuana, SCs with completely 
different chemical structures have 
been identified. There are at least 
14 chemically-diverse families 
of SCs, and they appear to be 
increasing in potency.2 The number 
of such compounds discovered 
has increased incrementally every 
year.3 Although these compounds 
are commonly marketed as being 
similar to marijuana (often under 
names such as Spice and K2), 
the potency is 2 to 100 times 
stronger than that of marijuana4 
and does not contain the anxiolytic 
and antipsychotic component of 
marijuana, cannabidiol5; therefore, 
these compounds typically do not 
mimic effects of natural marijuana 
as widely thought. SCs are sprayed 
onto dried plant matter, and sold 
as “herbal incense, 
” sold as “legal” 
marijuana labeled “not for human 
consumption, 
” or alternatively are 
available as powders and sold as 
“research chemicals.” 
6
The high potency of SCs and 
overactivation of CB1 receptors are a 
likely cause of wide-ranging adverse 
effects commonly associated with 
use.7 A systematic review of 106 
studies revealed 4000 cases of SC 
use in medical literature and poison 
center data. Common adverse effects 
included tachycardia (37%–77%), 
agitation (16%–41%), nausea 
(13%–94%), generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures (4%–15%), 27 deaths, and 
psychiatric problems such as first-
episode psychosis.8 Additionally,  
SCs were analytically confirmed in 
cases of convulsions, 
9 seizures, 
10  
acute kidney injury, 
11 acute 
cerebral ischemia, 
12 and myocardial 
infarction.13 The rate of emergency 
medical treatment seeking after 
use has been estimated to be 30 
times the rate of emergency medical 
treatment after marijuana use.14 
In a study in which presentations 
during emergency department 
visits are compared, SC cases were 
found to have more “pronounced 
neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity” 
compared with marijuana cases.15
SC use has been found to be strongly 
associated with marijuana use, 
16 
with some studies revealing ≥95% 
of past-year SC users reporting 
lifetime marijuana use.16 
– 
18 Almost 
all past-year users have also been, or 
currently are, marijuana users, 
17 
– 
19 
and a recent longitudinal study of 
adolescents revealed that marijuana 
use predicted SC use, but SC use did 
not predict marijuana use, suggesting 
marijuana use usually precedes 
SC use.20 In addition, frequency of 
marijuana use has been found to be 
one of the strongest correlates of SC 
use.16 However, 1 study revealed that 
93% of users preferred marijuana 
over SCs, and users rated SCs more 
highly regarding negative effects.17 
Although previous studies have 
revealed robust associations between 
lifetime use of other drugs and past-
year and lifetime use of SCs, 
16, 
 
21 more 
information is needed regarding how 
recency of use of other drugs relates 
to SC use to better inform prevention.
The prevalence of SC use has 
been found to be relatively high in 
young US populations. A study in 
which data were examined from 
Monitoring the Future (MTF), a 
nationally representative sample of 
high school students in the United 
States, revealed that from 2011 to 
2013, 10.1% of high school seniors 
reported past-year use of SCs, with 
3% of high school seniors reporting 
more frequent use (used ≥6 times).16 
A steady decline in the prevalence 
of past-year use among high school 
seniors has been observed, with 
11.4% reporting use in 2011 and 
3.5% reporting use in 2016.22, 
 
23  
However, SCs still appear to be 
relatively attractive to some younger 
people; past-year use in 2016 was 
reported by 2.7% of eighth-graders, 
3.3% of 10th-graders, and 3.5% of 
12th-graders.22, 
24
Because of the potential harms 
associated with SC use, data on 
prevalence of use are necessary to 
understand which users are still at 
risk. To date, all national prevalence

 studies in the United States have 
been focused on lifetime21 or past-
year use.16, 
 
22 Data on current use 
(commonly defined by national 
surveys as use within the past 30 
days25) are needed to determine 
which individuals are at highest risk 
for use and more immediate adverse 
outcomes (because discontinuation 
is common among individuals who 
had tried SCs in their lifetime or 
past year).16 Current use is also an 
important focus because newer and 
more dangerous SC compounds 
continue to emerge, 
2 and poisonings 
related to use have remained 
prevalent26, 
 
27 despite decreasing 
prevalence of use. Thus, our aim 
in this article is to determine risk 
factors for current use of SCs in a 
nationally representative sample of 
high school seniors with a particular 
focus on recency of use of other 
drugs. Because SC use is closely 
tied with marijuana use, we sought 
to differentiate risk of current SC 
users (who report marijuana use) 
from current marijuana users (a 
population at high risk for initiating 
SC use).
MethODs
Procedure
MTF is an annual, nationally 
representative survey of high school 
students in the United States.23 A 
different cross-section of students is 
surveyed each year, sampled from 
∼130 public and private schools 
throughout the 48 contiguous states. 
A multistage random sampling 
procedure is used in the geographic 
areas that are selected; then schools 
within areas are selected, followed by 
classes within schools. Approximately 
15 000 high school seniors are 
surveyed every year, and students are 
surveyed via 6 different survey forms, 
which are distributed randomly. Only 
survey forms 2 and 5, however, query 
current (30-day) use of SCs (neither of 
which query past-year or lifetime use). 
Therefore, current use is only assessed

MTF began asking about current 
SC use in 2014, and both available 
years of data (2014–2015) were 
aggregated for analysis. MTF protocols 
were approved by the University 
of Michigan Institutional Review 
Board, and these secondary analyses 
were exempt from review of the first 
authors’ institutional review board.
Measures
Current SC use was assessed via the 
following question: “During the last 
30 days, on how many occasions 
(if any) have you taken ‘synthetic 
marijuana’ (‘K2, 
’ ‘Spice’) to get 
high?” Answer options were: (1) 
none, (2) 1 to 2 days, (3) 3 to 5 days, 
(4) 6 to 9 days, (5) 10 to 19 days, and 
(6) 20 to 30 days. A dichotomous 
variable was coded indicating 
whether 30-day use was reported, 
and another was coded to indicate 
whether SCs were reportedly used 
on ≥3 days (vs 0–2 days) to indicate 
higher-frequency use. Frequency of 
use was also recoded into a variable 
indicating use on 1 to 2 days, 3 to 9 
days, and on ≥10 days. Students were 
also asked about lifetime, past-year, 
and current (past 30-day) use of 
various other drugs. A variable was 
coded to indicate current marijuana-
only use versus marijuana use plus 
current SC use. To determine recency 
of use of other drugs, lifetime, past-
year, and 30-day use of alcohol, 
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 
opioids (nonmedical use), cocaine, 
and heroin, were recoded to indicate 
(1) no lifetime use, (2) lifetime use 
but not past-year use, (3) past-year 
use but not past 30-day use, and 
(4) past 30-day use. Variables were 
also coded to indicate frequency of 
lifetime use of other drugs that were 
categorized into never used, used 1 
to 2 times, and used ≥3 times, and 
a count variable was also coded to 
indicate number of illegal drugs used 
(currently) other than marijuana. To 
assess perception of risk associated 
with marijuana use, students were 
asked, “How much do you think 
people risk harming themselves 
(physically or in other ways) if they 
smoke marijuana occasionally?” 
Answer options were: (1) no risk, 
(2) slight risk, (3) moderate risk, (4) 
great risk, and (5) can’t say. On form 
2 only, students were also asked 
the same question regarding (1) 
risk of trying SCs once or twice and 
(2) risk of using SCs occasionally. 
Dichotomous variables were coded 
to indicate “great risk” 
24 (versus all 
other responses, with “can’t say” 
coded as missing).
Regarding demographic 
characteristics, students were asked 
their age (predefined by MTF as <18 
vs ≥18 years), sex, and race and/
or ethnicity (predefined as African

To examine parent educational

statistical analyses
Prevalence of self-reported use was 
estimated by using all cases with 
SC data (N = 7805). Each covariate 
was then examined in a bivariable 
manner, comparing demographic 
and other drug use characteristics 
between marijuana-only users and 
SC (plus marijuana) users by using 
Rao-Scott χ2 tests.33 Characteristics 
for the full sample and for those not 
reporting current use of marijuana 
or SCs were also computed 
for descriptive purposes. All 
demographic and drug use covariates 
were then fit into a multivariable 
generalized linear model by using 
Poisson and log link with current SC 
use (plus marijuana use) compared 
with current marijuana-only use 
as the outcome. Missing data were 
addressed in the model as in  
previous MTF analyses by entering  
an additional category for each 
covariate to prevent casewise 
deletion and ensuring that results 
match those from a model in which 
the case-complete data set was 
utilized.16, 
 
32, 
 
34, 
35 Bivariable tests were 
then repeated for each covariate, but 
comparing frequency of use of each 
other drug. Finally, bivariable tests 
were conducted to determine if there 
were differences between covariates 
according to frequency of current 
SC use. Bonferroni corrections 
were used when appropriate for 
multiple comparisons. All analyses 
were design-based for survey data36 
by using survey sample weights 
provided from MTF. Stata 13.1 
software (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX) was used for all analyses.
ResuLts
Current (30-day) SC use was 
reported by 2.9% of students, and 
there was not a significant difference 
in prevalence by year (P = .73). Eight 
out of 10 (80.6%) SC users also 
reported current marijuana use, 
91.1% reported past-year use, and 
95.7% reported lifetime marijuana 
use. The 40 SC users who reported no 
current marijuana use were omitted 
from bivariable and multivariable 
analyses.
 
Figure 1 presents the proportions 
of marijuana and SC users in the 
analytic sample. Approximately 1 in 
10 students (9.3%) reporting current 
marijuana use also reported current 
SC use. Table 1 presents sample 
demographics and self-reported 
drug use, as well as comparisons 
between current marijuana and SC 
(plus marijuana) use. Compared 
with current marijuana-only users, 
students reporting SC use were more 
likely to have parents with lower 
educational attainment (P = .02). 
Compared with marijuana-only users, 
SC users were more likely to report 
use and more recent and/or current 
use of each drug with exception 
of alcohol (Ps < .01). Specifically, 
compared with marijuana-only 
users, prevalence of current use of 
other drugs was substantially higher 
among SC users for LSD (14.8% vs 
3.4%), opioids (13.6% vs 5.7%), 
cocaine (10.6% vs 3.3%), and heroin 
(5.9% vs 0.1%). SC users were also 
more likely than marijuana-only 
users to report high perception of 
risk of using marijuana occasionally 
(P < .01) and less likely to report high 
perception of risk of trying SCs and 
using SCs occasionally (Ps < .025). 
Results were similar when examining 
these associations in a multivariable

 manner (Table 2). Specifically, 
compared with marijuana-only 
users, SC users had significantly 
lower prevalence of having parents 
with higher education (P < .05), 
significantly higher prevalence of 
reporting current alcohol use (P < 
.01), and increased prevalence of 
current use of number of other illegal 
drugs (Ps < .001).
As shown in Table 3, compared with 
marijuana-only users, SC users were 
more likely to report use and more 
frequent lifetime use (used ≥3 times) 
of LSD (12.7% vs 4.9%), cocaine 
(13.0% vs 5.7%), and heroin (9.0% 
vs 0.6%).
Finally, among those reporting 
current SC use (Table 4), those 
reporting use on ≥10 days were 
more likely to identify as boys (P < 
.01) or African American (P < .001). 
Likewise, those reporting SC use 
on ≥10 days were also more likely 
to report current use of marijuana 
≥20 times in the past month, with 
approximately half (48.9%) reporting 
such high-frequency marijuana 
use (P < .01). Although 8 out of 10 
students reporting SC use on ≥10 
days reported not using any of the 
4 other illegal drugs in the past 30 
days, the proportion reporting use of 
2 to 4 other drugs grew as frequency 
of SC use increased (P < .001).
DIscussIOn
This is the first nationally 
representative study in which 
current (past 30-day) use of SCs 
was examined. Other large-scale 
studies have been focused on past-
year and lifetime use, but research 
was needed on those at highest risk 
for immediate adverse outcomes—
current users. Three percent of 
high school seniors in the United 
States reported current use of these 
compounds, and 1.4% of high school 
seniors reported using on ≥3 days 
in the past month (constituting half 
of current users). This finding is 
important because it implies that 
half of current users report using 
SCs more than once or twice, which 
may suggest more than just mere 
“experimentation.” In fact, a fifth 
of current users reported use on 
20 to 30 days in the past 30 days, 
suggesting daily or almost-daily use. 
Boys, African American students, and 
users of various other drugs were 
identified to be at particular risk for 
frequent SC use. A previous study of 
past-year SC use in MTF found that 
African American students were 
actually at lower risk for use (until 
controlling for other covariates).16 
These findings suggest that risk 
profiles appear to be different for 
students who are trying SCs and for 
those who are using currently and/or 
frequently.
In this study, we corroborated 
previous studies in that SC use is 
closely tied to marijuana use, 
16 
–20 
with 8 out of 10 current SC users also 
reporting current marijuana use. We 
also found that approximately half 
of frequent SC users reported using 
marijuana ≥20 times during the past 
month, further highlighting links 
between these drugs and suggests

Downloaded from 
 those who may be dependent on 
marijuana may be more likely to 
engage in frequent SC use. Because 
so few current SC users deny lifetime 
marijuana use, and because a recent 
study revealed that marijuana use 
predicts SC use but not vice versa, 
20 
it is important to determine which 
marijuana users are at risk for using 
these new potentially dangerous 
compounds. Results pertaining to 
other drug use suggest that current 
SC use appears to be part of a more 
extensive polydrug use repertoire 
involving other illegal drugs that are 
less prevalent among marijuana-
only users. Temporal order of drug 
initiation could not be determined, 
but these associations suggest the 
need to target marijuana users who 
also use other drugs to help prevent 
initiation of SCs.
Although fewer SC users perceived 
that SC experimentation and 
occasional use are at great risk of 
harming themselves physically 
or in other ways (compared with 
marijuana-only users), SC users were 
more likely than marijuana-only 
users to report high perception of 
risk of using marijuana occasionally. 
This finding may indicate a lack 
of knowledge about the relative 
health risks of SC compared with 
marijuana. Although marijuana itself 
is not risk-free, the current state of 
the literature on SC-related harms 
clearly indicates that SC products are 
becoming more dangerous, because 
new generations of SC that are more 
potent and bind more heavily to 
cannabinoid receptors are replacing 
first and second generations.2 If there 
are students using SCs because they 
genuinely believe they are less risky 
than marijuana, this misconception 
should be addressed through better 
education programs stressing the 
greater danger posed by SCs. It is 
possible, however, that the high 
perception of risk associated with 
marijuana use was regarding risk 
of arrest rather than direct health 
risks because marijuana is a Schedule 
I drug in the United States. More 
research is needed to determine the 
extent to which marijuana users are 
likely to resort to SC use to evade 
arrest, or positive drug test results, 
or the stigma associated with use of 
illegal drugs.
Limitations are noted. Current use 
was not queried among eighth-
graders or 10th-graders, and 
it was not queried on the same 
randomized survey forms that ask 
about past-year use. SC use was 
only queried on 2 of 6 survey forms. 
To help ensure generalizability of 
findings, we confirmed that there 
were no significant differences by 
any covariate between the survey 
forms used in these analyses and the 
other 4 forms that did not ask about 
current SC use. Although other drugs 
queried have been validated in recent 
decades by MTF, 
24 a limitation is 
that current SC use is a new variable 
that does not appear to have been 
tested in other MTF analyses. Many 
adolescents also might not have 
been capable of accurately reporting 
educational attainment of their 
parent(s) or guardian(s). Missing 
data were an issue, in part, because 
MTF surveys are administered via 
paper and pencil, and MTF does not 
provide race and/or ethnicity data 
for students identifying as any race 
and/or ethnicity other than white, 
African American, or Hispanic. This 
was addressed in our multivariable 
model similar to how this has 
been addressed in many previous 
analyses.16, 
 
32, 
 
34, 
35 Adolescents 
who dropped out of school were 
not surveyed, and given that this 
study was cross-sectional, temporal 
associations could not be examined. 
Because higher frequency (use ≥6 
times) current SC use and lifetime use 
of other drugs was rare, models could 
not be used to examine associations 
in a multivariable manner with 
precision. The usual limitations 
applicable to survey studies also 
apply: that use is self-reported and 
therefore relies on memory and may 
be affected by social desirability or 
dishonest reporting. There was no 
analytic confirmation of self-report 
drug use.
Although prevalence of past-year  
SC use has been decreasing in 
recent years, 
22, 
 
23 we estimate that 
3% of high school seniors have 
used in the past month. These 
are students who are at current 
risk of experiencing adverse 
health outcomes from the newest 
generation of SCs and also because 
of concurrent use of other drugs. 
Although previous studies have 
revealed that marijuana users 
are at high risk for use, this study 
revealed risk factors among current 
marijuana users that increase risk 
of current use and higher-frequency 
use of SCs. Prevention needs to be 
focused primarily on marijuana 
users, especially marijuana users 
with risk factors discovered in this 
analysis. Marijuana users who use 
other drugs in particular are at 
highest risk for currently using SCs, 
so particular focus needs to be paid 
to these individuals at high risk.
