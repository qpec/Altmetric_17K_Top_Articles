BACKGROUND
Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing inflammation without affect-
ing lipid levels may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Yet, the inflamma-
tory hypothesis of atherothrombosis has remained unproved.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of canakinumab, a therapeutic mono-
clonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, involving 10,061 patients with previous myo-
cardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per 
liter. The trial compared three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg, 
administered subcutaneously every 3 months) with placebo. The primary efficacy end 
point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.
RESULTS
At 48 months, the median reduction from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reac-
tive protein level was 26 percentage points greater in the group that received the 
50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 percentage points greater in the 150-mg group, 
and 41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group than in the placebo group. 
Canakinumab did not reduce lipid levels from baseline. At a median follow-up of 
3.7 years, the incidence rate for the primary end point was 4.50 events per 100 
person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events per 100 person-years in the 50-mg 
group, 3.86 events per 100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 events per 
100 person-years in the 300-mg group. The hazard ratios as compared with pla-
cebo were as follows: in the 50-mg group, 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 
to 1.07; P 
= 
0.30); in the 150-mg group, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.021); and 
in the 300-mg group, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.031). The 150-mg dose, but 
not the other doses, met the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted threshold for statis-
tical significance for the primary end point and the secondary end point that ad-
ditionally included hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascu-
larization (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P 
= 
0.005). 
Canakinumab was associated with a higher incidence of fatal infection than was 
placebo. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 
for all canakinumab doses vs. placebo, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P 
= 
0.31).
CONCLUSIONS
Antiinflammatory therapy targeting the interleukin-1β innate immunity pathway 
with canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower 
rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo, independent of lipid-level lower-
ing. (Funded by Novartis; CANTOS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01327846.)

urrent pharmaceutical interven-
tions that are designed to slow the progres-
sion of atherosclerosis focus almost exclu-
sively on reducing plasma levels of cholesterol. 
However, clinical and experimental data support 
an additional critical role for inflammation in ath-
erothrombosis.1-3 We previously found that down-
stream biomarkers of inflammation such as high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
events, independent of the cholesterol level.4,5 We 
have also found that statins reduce the levels of 
cholesterol and markers of inflammation,6 and 
in a series of clinical trials we and others subse-
quently found that beneficial outcomes after statin 
therapy relate to both a reduction in cholesterol 
level and inflammation inhibition.7-11 Yet, to date, 
no evidence has shown that reducing vascular 
inflammation in the absence of concomitant lipid 
lowering reduces the rates of cardiovascular 
events. As such, the inflammatory hypothesis of 
atherothrombosis has remained unproved.
Interleukin-1β is a cytokine that is central to 
the inflammatory response and that drives the 
interleukin-6 signaling pathway. Canakinumab, 
a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting 
interleukin-1β, has antiinflammatory effects and 
has been approved for clinical use in rheumato-
logic disorders.12,13 In a phase 2 trial involving pa-
tients with diabetes who were at high vascular 
risk, we found that interleukin-1β inhibition with 
canakinumab markedly reduced plasma levels of 
interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive pro-
tein without lowering the level of low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) cholesterol.14 Thus, we hypothesized 
that canakinumab could provide a critical proof-
of-concept treatment to test the inflammatory 
hypothesis of atherothrombosis directly. The 
Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Out-
come Study (CANTOS), a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial involving stable 
patients with previous myocardial infarction, eval-
uated whether canakinumab could prevent recur-
rent vascular events in men and women who have 
a persistent proinflammatory response, defined as 
a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg 
or more per liter.15
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
This investigator-driven clinical trial was sponsored 
by Novartis. The trial protocol, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org, was designed 
by academic members of the executive committee 
with input from physician and statistician employ-
ees of the sponsor. The protocol was approved at 
participating centers by the responsible institu-
tional review board or ethics committee, as ap-
plicable in the 39 countries involved. An inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring committee 
oversaw the trial. The sponsor was responsible 
for data collection. The first author and an aca-
demic statistician at Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital had full access to the trial databases, gener-
ated trial analyses, prepared the first draft of the 
manuscript, and made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. The authors assume 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol.
Trial Population
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had 
a history of myocardial infarction and had a blood 
level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of 2 mg 
or more per liter despite the use of aggressive 
secondary prevention strategies. The trial excluded 
from enrollment patients with a history of chron-
ic or recurrent infection, previous cancer other 
than basal-cell skin carcinoma, a suspected or 
known immunocompromised state, a history or 
high risk of tuberculosis or disease related to 
the human immunodeficiency virus, or ongoing 
use of other systemic antiinflammatory treatments. 
Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
provided in Section B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available at NEJM.org.
Randomization
Initially, patients were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, canakinumab at a 
dose of 150 mg, or canakinumab at a dose of 
300 mg. After the enrollment of 741 patients, a 
50-mg dose of canakinumab was added at the 
request of a regulatory agency, and the random-
ization ratio was adjusted accordingly; we sought 
to achieve a final randomization ratio of 1.5 
(placebo group):1:1:1 (Section C in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). All doses of canakinumab 
and placebo were administered subcutaneously 
once every 3 months; for the 300-mg dose, the 
regimen was 300 mg every 2 weeks for the first 
two doses, then once every 3 months. Randomiza-
tion was performed with the use of a centralized 
computer system, with stratification according to

the time since the index myocardial infarction and 
according to trial part (before vs. after inclusion of 
the 50-mg dose group).
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the first oc-
currence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, any 
nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death in a time-
to-event analysis. The trial had two key secondary 
efficacy end points. The first key secondary end 
point included the components of the primary 
end point as well as hospitalization for unstable 
angina that led to urgent revascularization. The 
second key secondary end point, the incidence of 
new-onset type 2 diabetes among patients with 
prediabetes at randomization in a time-to-event 
analysis, is not reported here. The two other pre-
specified secondary end points were death from 
any cause and the composite of nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, any nonfatal stroke, or death 
from any cause. All the components of these end 
points were adjudicated by an end-point adjudica-
tion committee, whose members were unaware of 
the trial-group assignments.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to accrue a total of 1400 
primary end-point events across all the groups. 
Assuming that all three active doses would result 
in a primary event rate that was 20% lower than 
the rate with placebo, we calculated that the trial 
would have more than 90% power to detect a sig-
nificantly lower risk with at least one canakinumab 
dose than with placebo. The investigators initially 
sought to enroll 17,200 patients in order to accrue 
1400 events over a period of 5 years. In December 
2013, at the request of the sponsor, the sample 
size was reduced to 10,000 patients. The planned 
follow-up was extended by 1 year to maintain the 
targeted number of events.
The distributions of the percentage change 
from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein and lipid levels were compared between 
the placebo group and each canakinumab group 
at intervals up to 48 months. Similar compari-
sons were made for interleukin-6 levels up to 12 
months. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional-
hazards models, stratified according to the time 
since the index myocardial infarction and accord-
ing to trial part, were used to analyze the pre-
specified primary and key secondary cardiovascu-
lar end points that occurred during trial follow-up, 
according to the intention-to-treat principle.
The formal evaluation of significance for indi-
vidual doses, with adjustment for multiple com-
parisons, followed a closed testing procedure (Sec-
tion C in the Supplementary Appendix). On the 
basis of the closed testing procedure, and with 
the use of the prespecified allocation of alpha 
error, the two-sided P value thresholds for statis-
tical significance for the primary end point were 
0.01058 for the test of the 300-mg dose of 
canakinumab versus placebo and 0.02115 for the 
tests of the other two doses versus placebo. The 
closed testing procedure also specified that for-
mal significance testing for the key secondary end 
points would be performed for any given dose only 
if the significance threshold for the primary end 
point for that dose had been met.
Although the primary analysis strategy was 
based on pairwise comparisons of individual dose 
groups with the placebo group, comparisons were 
also made between the incidence rates in the 
placebo group and the incidence rates across the 
ascending canakinumab doses (using scores of 
0, 1, 3, and 6 that were proportional to doses in 
a trend analysis) and in the combined canakinum-
ab groups versus placebo. In addition, analyses 
that focused on patients who adhered to the trial 
regimen were performed, with follow-up for each 
patient being censored 119 days after the last injec-
tion was received. The significance thresholds for 
these tests were not adjusted for multiple compari-
sons. Similar analyses were used for adverse 
events. All P values are two-sided, and all confi-
dence intervals were computed at the 95% level.
Results
Patients
Trial enrollment began in April 2011 and was 
completed in March 2014; the last trial visit was 
in June 2017. Of 17,482 patients who had previ-
ously had myocardial infarction and had under-
gone screening in the central laboratory, 10,061 
(57.6%) underwent randomization correctly and 
received at least one dose of canakinumab or pla-
cebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
most common reasons for exclusion were a high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein level of less than 2 mg 
per liter (46.0% of the excluded patients), active 
tuberculosis or tuberculosis risk factors (25.4%), 
and exclusionary concomitant disorders (9.9%).
The mean age of the participants who under-
went randomization was 61 years, 25.7% of the 
patients were women, and 40.0% had diabetes

Canakinumab for Atherosclerotic Disease
(Table 1). Most participants had undergone pre-
vious revascularization procedures (66.7% of the 
patients had undergone percutaneous coronary 
intervention, and 14.0% coronary-artery bypass 
grafting). At baseline, antithrombotic agents were 
taken by 95.0% of the patients, lipid-lowering 
agents by 93.4%, anti-ischemia agents by 91.4%, 
and inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system 
by 79.7%. The median high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein level at trial entry was 4.20 mg per liter, 
and the median LDL cholesterol level was 82.4 mg 
per deciliter (2.13 mmol per liter).
Effects on Inflammatory Biomarkers  
and Lipid Levels
At 48 months, the median reduction from base-
line in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level 
was 26 percentage points greater in the group that 
received the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 per-
centage points greater in the 150-mg group, and 
41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group 
than in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all com-
parisons of the median percentage change in a 
canakinumab group with the placebo group) 
(Fig. 1, and Fig. S2 and Tables S1 through S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Similar effects were 
observed for the interleukin-6 level (measured up 
to 12 months). By contrast, canakinumab use re-
sulted in no significant reduction from baseline 
in the LDL cholesterol or HDL cholesterol level 
and in a 4 to 5% median increase in the triglyc-
eride level.
Follow-up and Effects on Clinical End Points
By the end of follow-up, 18.1% of patients in the 
placebo group had discontinued the trial regimen, 
as compared with 18.7% of patients in the com-
bined canakinumab groups (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). At a median follow-up of 3.7 
years, the incidence rate for the primary end point 
(nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, 
or cardiovascular death) was 4.50 events per 100 
person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events 
per 100 person-years in the group that received 
the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 3.86 events per 
100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 
events per 100 person-years in the 300-mg group 
(Table 2). No significant effect, as compared with 
placebo, was observed with regard to the primary 
end point in the 50-mg group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 
P 
= 
0.30) (Fig. 2A). By contrast, a significant effect 
for the primary end point was observed in the 
150-mg group (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.85; 
P 
= 
0.02075, with a threshold P value of 0.02115) 
(Fig. 2B). In the 300-mg group, the hazard ratio 
was similar to that in the 150-mg group, but 
the P value did not meet the prespecified

The primary end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.
‡  
This result was not significant as compared with placebo according to the prespecified closed‑testing procedure. The threshold P value for the primary end point for the 50‑mg dose was 
0.02115. The threshold P value for the primary end point for the 300‑mg dose was 0.01058.

This result was significant as compared with placebo, with adjustment for multiple comparisons and with accounting for two efficacy interim analyses, in accordance with the prespeci‑
fied closed‑testing procedure (Section C in the Supplementary Appendix). The threshold P value for the primary end point for the 150‑mg dose was 0.02115. The threshold P value for 
the key secondary cardiovascular end point for the 150‑mg dose was 0.00529.
¶  
The key secondary cardiovascular end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina that led to unplanned revascularization, or cardiovas‑
cular death.

Shown is the cumulative incidence of the primary end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death in 
the placebo group versus the various canakinumab dose groups (Panels A through C). The insets show the same data on an enlarged  
y axis. The threshold P value for the primary end point was 0.02115 in the 150‑mg group and 0.01058 in the 300‑mg group. The group 
receiving the 150‑mg dose of canakinumab met the prespecified multiplicity‑adjusted threshold for statistical significance for the prima‑
ry cardiovascular end point and for the key secondary cardiovascular end point that additionally included hospitalization for unstable an‑
gina that led to urgent revascularization (Panel D). The threshold P value for the key secondary cardiovascular end point in the 150‑mg 
group was 0.00529.

ceived the 150-mg dose of canakinumab (for 
which the P value met the significance threshold 
for the primary end point), the hazard ratio versus 
placebo for the secondary cardiovascular end point 
was 0.83 (P 
= 
0.00525, with a threshold P value of 
0.00529) (Fig. 2D). According to the closed testing 
procedure, formal significance testing for the 
prespecified secondary end point was not per-
formed for the 50-mg group and the 300-mg 
group. The hazard ratio versus placebo in the 
50-mg group was 0.90, and the hazard ratio versus 
placebo in the 300-mg group was 0.83 (Figs. S3 
and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The P value 
for trend across the canakinumab groups as com-
pared with the placebo group was 0.003, and the 
P value for the comparison of all canakinumab 
doses combined with the placebo group was 0.001 
(both results not adjusted for multiple testing).
Analyses of the additional secondary end points 
and of the components of the primary and second-
ary end points were not adjusted for multiple test-
ing (Table 2). Nominally significantly lower rates 
than in the placebo group were seen with regard 
to myocardial infarction in the group that received 
the 150-mg dose of canakinumab; with regard to 
hospitalization for unstable angina that led to ur-
gent revascularization in the 150-mg group and 
the 300-mg group; and with regard to any coro-
nary revascularization in all three dose groups. 
All-cause mortality was neutral in the compari-
son of all canakinumab doses with placebo (haz-
ard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 
1.06; P 
= 
0.31).
In analyses that focused on patients who ad-
hered to the trial regimen, the observed hazard 
ratios were 1.00 in the placebo group, 0.90 in the 
group that received the 50-mg dose of canakinum-
ab, 0.83 in the 150-mg group, and 0.79 in the 
300-mg group (P 
= 
0.003 for trend across groups). 
In similar analyses for the key secondary cardio-
vascular end point, the corresponding hazard ra-
tios were 1.00, 0.88, 0.80, and 0.77 (P<0.001 for 
trend across groups).
Adverse Events and Other Clinical Outcomes
Neutropenia was more common among patients 
who were assigned to receive canakinumab than 
among those in the placebo group, and signifi-
cantly more deaths were attributed to infection or 
sepsis in the pooled canakinumab groups than in 
the placebo group (incidence rate, 0.31 vs. 0.18 
events per 100 person-years; P 
= 
0.02) (Table 3). 
The patients who died from infection tended to 
be older and more likely to have diabetes than 
those who did not die from infection. Six con-
firmed cases of tuberculosis occurred during the 
trial, with similar rates in the pooled canakinum-
ab group and the placebo group (0.06% in each 
group); five cases occurred in India and one in 
Taiwan.
Thrombocytopenia was more common among 
patients who were assigned to receive canakinum-
ab than among those in the placebo group, but no 
significant difference in the incidence of hemor-
rhage was observed. The incidence rate of injec-
tion-site reaction did not differ significantly be-
tween any canakinumab group and the placebo 
group. In a finding that was consistent with known 
effects of interleukin-1β inhibition, canakinumab 
resulted in significantly fewer reports of arthritis, 
gout, and osteoarthritis than did placebo (Table 3). 
Cancer mortality was significantly lower with 
canakinumab than with placebo.16
Discussion
CANTOS was designed to test directly the inflam-
matory hypothesis of atherothrombosis. In this 
trial, in patients with a history of myocardial in-
farction, the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein and interleukin-6 were significantly re-
duced from baseline by canakinumab, as com-
pared with placebo, with no significant reduction 
in lipid levels from baseline. Although the 50-mg 
dose of canakinumab did not have a significant 
effect on the primary cardiovascular end point as 
compared with placebo, patients in the 150-mg 
group had a risk of the primary end point that 
was 15% lower than the risk in the placebo 
group (3.86 vs. 4.50 events per 100 person-years) 
and a risk of the key secondary cardiovascular 
end point that was 17% lower than that in the 
placebo group (4.29 vs. 5.13 events per 100 per-
son-years). The P values for both end points met 
the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted thresholds 
for statistical significance. Although the hazard 
ratios for the comparison of canakinumab with 
placebo in the 300-mg group were similar to those 
in the 150-mg group, the prespecified thresholds 
for significance were not met in this group. How-

Canakinumab for Atherosclerotic Disease
ever, both a pooled analysis of all canakinumab 
doses and a trend analysis suggested a beneficial 
effect of canakinumab with regard to cardiovas-
cular outcomes.
The specific targeting of interleukin-1β as a 
cytokine-based therapy for the secondary preven-
tion of atherosclerotic events rests on several ob-
servations. The proinflammatory cytokine inter-
leukin-1β plays multiple roles in the development 
of atherothrombotic plaque, including the in-
duction of procoagulant activity, the promotion 
of monocyte and leukocyte adhesion to vascu-
lar endothelial cells, and the growth of vascular 
smooth-muscle cells.17-19 In mice, interleukin-1β 
deficiency reduces lesion formation, whereas 
in cholesterol-fed pigs, exposure to exogenous 
inter 
leukin-1β increases intimal medial thicken-
ing.20,21 The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) 
inflammasome activates interleukin-1β, a process 
promoted by cholesterol crystals, neutrophil extra-
cellular traps, tissue hypoxia, and arterial flow 
patterns that are known to promote focal devel-
opment of atherosclerosis within arteries.22-25 This 
activation of interleukin-1β stimulates the down-
stream interleukin-6–receptor signaling pathway, 
which has been implicated by mendelian random-
ization studies as a potential causal pathway for 
atherothrombosis.26,27 More recently, studies in 
parabiotic mice28 and studies of clonal hemato-
poiesis29,30 have implicated interleukin-1β in pro-
cesses by which bone marrow activation acceler-
ates atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the expression 
of specific inflammasome gene modules affect-
ing interleukin-1β has been associated with death 
from any cause and increased atherosclerosis in 
elderly patients.31
Although the patients in CANTOS had gener-
ally well-controlled levels of LDL cholesterol, rates 
of both the primary end point and the secondary 
cardiovascular end point in the placebo group 
were high, with cumulative incidences of more 
than 20% at 5 years. Our data thus affirm that 
statin-treated patients with residual inflamma-
tory risk as assessed by means of a high-sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per 
liter at baseline have future event rates that are 
at least as high as, if not higher than, those among 
statin-treated patients with a residual risk due to 
LDL cholesterol level. These two groups of patients 
may differ and may require personalized approach-
es to treatment.32 Despite the fact that no signifi-
cant reduction in cholesterol levels occurred in this 
trial, the magnitude of effect on cardiovascular 
events with canakinumab (given every 3 months) 
was similar to that associated with monoclonal 
antibodies targeting proprotein convertase sub-
tilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9; given every 2 to 4 
weeks).33,34 Yet, inhibition of interleukin-1β is a 
narrowly focused intervention that represents only 
one of many potential antiinflammatory pathways 
that might serve as targets for atheroprotection.35-37 
Thus, our data suggest that other antiinflamma-
tory interventions, such as those that directly in-
hibit NLRP3 function or that alter downstream 
interleukin-6 signaling, may also be beneficial in 
reducing cardiovascular risk.
We found a significantly higher incidence of 
fatal infection and sepsis with canakinumab than 
with placebo, as well as a reduction in platelet 
counts with no increase in bleeding risk. By con-
trast, cancer mortality was significantly lower 
among patients assigned to receive canakinumab 
than among those in the placebo group, a find-
ing that is consistent with experimental data 
relating interleukin-1 to the progression and in-
vasiveness of certain tumors, particularly lung 
cancer.16,38,39 There was no significant difference 
between the canakinumab groups and the place-
bo group in all-cause mortality. No statistically or 
clinically significant hepatic toxic effect was not-
ed. The beneficial effects of canakinumab that 
were observed with regard to arthritis, gout, and 
osteoarthritis are consistent with well-described 
effects of the interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 
pathways in these disorders.
In conclusion, in CANTOS, patients with a his-
tory of myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter 
were randomly assigned to one of three doses of 
canakinumab or to placebo. Canakinumab signifi-
cantly reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
levels from baseline, as compared with placebo, 
without reducing the LDL cholesterol level, and 
the 150-mg dose resulted in a significantly lower 
incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events than 
placebo.
