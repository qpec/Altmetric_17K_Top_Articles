Abstract
An association between combat exposure and postdeployment behavioral health problems has 
been demonstrated among U.S. military service members returning from Afghanistan or Iraq in 
predominantly male samples, yet few studies have focused on the experiences of women. Using 
data from the longitudinal, observational Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat 
(SUPIC) study, this study explored the self-report of 4 combat exposure items and postdeployment 
behavioral health screening results for 42,397 Army enlisted women who returned from 
Afghanistan or Iraq from fiscal years 2008 through 2011. We ran multivariate logistic regression 
models to examine how a constructed composite combat exposure score (0, 1, 2, 3+) was 
associated with screening positive postdeployment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
depression, or at-risk drinking among active duty (AD) and National Guard/Reserve (NG/R) 
women. AD and NG/R women commonly reported being wounded, injured, assaulted, or hurt 
(17.3% and 29.0%, respectively). In all 6 multivariate models, Army women with any report of 
combat exposure had increased odds of the behavioral health problem (i.e., PTSD, depression, or 
at-risk drinking). The magnitude of the association between combat exposure and PTSD was most 
striking, indicating increased odds of PTSD as combat exposure score increased. AD and NG/R 
women with a combat exposure score of 3+ had increased odds of PTSD, 20.7, 95% CI [17.0, 
25.1] and 27.8, 95% CI [21.0, 36.9], respectively. Women who reported combat exposure may 
benefit from early prevention and confidential intervention to promote postdeployment health and 
reduce long-term behavioral health problems.
Women have played an integral part in U.S. military history. Prior to the inception of the 
Army Nurse Corps in 1901, women served as nurses and cooks, with some disguising 
themselves as men to serve their country. Women were formally recognized as military 
members entitled to benefits after World War II. Women were restricted to two percent of

 the military population until 1967, allowing for more women members when conscription 
ended in 1973 and the all-volunteer force began (National Center for Veterans Analysis and 
Statistics, 2011). By 2013, the prevalence of women members increased to 16% 
(Department of Defense, 2013). Furthermore, women represented 10.5% of deployments to 
Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF; Larson et al., 2013).
Although women were formally excluded from direct ground combat roles until recent 
Department of Defense (DoD) policy changes (US Department of Defense, 2013), they were 
not shielded from combat exposure while serving in warzones (Luxton, Skopp, & Maguen, 
2010). A study of OEF/OIF Army active duty (AD) members treated in one medical 
treatment facility after deployments in 2006–2009, found women reported the following 
combat exposures: witnessing killing (9.0%), being exposed to death (31.0%), being injured 
in a war zone (7.2%), and killing (4%; Maguen, Luxton, Skopp, & Madden, 2012). Another 
study of 54 Army enlisted women returning from OIF found 73.5% experienced hostile or 
incoming fire personally or with a unit member, 20.8% went on combat patrols/missions, 
and 7.5% fired a weapon (Dutra et al., 2011).
Several studies of men and women found an association between combat exposure and 
postdeployment behavioral health problems, including an increased risk of screening 
positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Maguen, Luxton, et al., 2012), depression 
(Luxton et al., 2010), or at-risk drinking (Adams, Larson, Corrigan, Horgan, & Williams, 
2012). Additionally, a study of over 6,000 Army OIF members from two brigade combat 
teams found as cumulative lifetime combat exposures increased, so did the odds of reporting 
behavioral health diagnoses (e.g., depression, PTSD) and at-risk drinking (Gallaway, Fink, 
Millikan, Mitchell, & Bell, 2013). Compared to members who had never been deployed, the 
odds of having a behavioral health diagnosis among members with high cumulative combat 
exposure was 6.1, 95% CI [5.0–7.4]. The generalizability of these findings to women is 
unclear as they were only a small proportion of the group studied.
In contrast to men, little is known about how combat exposure contributes to 
postdeployment behavioral health problems among Army AD and National Guard/Reserve 
(NG/R) women. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to establish the prevalence of 
combat exposure among Army enlisted women returning from OEF/OIF deployments, and 
(b) to examine if combat exposure, or cumulative combat exposures on an index 
deployment, contributed to postdeployment behavioral health problems (PTSD, depression, 
and at-risk drinking) among Army enlisted women. This study aimed to have implications 
for early detection and treatment of postdeployment behavioral health problems among 
military women. Given that women are the fastest growing veteran group and are projected 
to be 18% of the veteran population by 2035 (Bean-Mayberry et al., 2010; Guo, 2013), it 
was important to improve our understanding of the impact of combat exposure on women’s 
postdeployment behavioral health.

 Method
Participants and Procedure
This study used data from a longitudinal, observational database constructed for the 
Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat Study (SUPIC), which includes data on all 
Army members returning from OEF/OIF deployments ending in fiscal years (FYs) 2008–
2011. Detailed methods, a rationale for the study, and a description of the cohort are 
described elsewhere (Larson et al., 2013). Respondents completed a questionnaire, the Post-
Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA, Form DD 2796), within 60 days of their 
deployment end date as a requirement of the DoD’s postdeployment health assessment 
program (Department of Defense, 2008). Self-report of combat exposures and behavioral 
health problems were derived from this questionnaire. Deployment data were drawn from 
the Contingency Tracking System; demographic and military characteristics were derived 
from the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System; and Army military occupation 
categories were provided by the Defense Manpower Data Center. This study was approved 
by Brandeis University’s Committee for Protection of Human Subjects and the Human 
Research Protection Program at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense Health 
Affairs.
The sample included all enlisted women who completed a 2008-version questionnaire that 
within 60 days of the end of an index deployment during the study window (i.e., first 
deployment ending in FYs 2008–2011); 42,397 Army, enlisted women (27,997 AD and 
14,400 NG/R). Table 1 describes the demographic and deployment characteristics of the 
analytic sample, by component. The majority of the sample was AD (66.0%), with the most 
prevalent age 17–24 years (50.8% of AD and 46.2% of NG/R). Compared to NG/R women, 
fewer AD women were White (38.4% versus 67.6%, respectively) and never married (42.1% 
versus 56.8%, respectively). Most women did not have child dependents eligible for Military 
Health System (MHS) healthcare benefits, a proxy for being a parent, with 16.2% of AD and 
18.2% NG/R women single parents. The majority had a junior enlisted rank, less than a 
college degree, and were functional support specialists or service and supply specialists. 
Over a third of AD and almost one-fourth of NG/R women had a prior deployment, and 
almost 5% had a positive screen for traumatic brain injury (TBI) during their index 
deployment.
Measures
Combat exposure was assessed with four items drawn from the Combat Experiences Scale 
(Guyker et al., 2013), all asked in relation to the index deployment: (a) were you wounded, 
injured, assaulted or otherwise hurt, (b) did you encounter dead bodies or see people killed 
or wounded, (c) were you engaged in direct combat where you discharged a weapon, and (d) 
did you ever feel that you were in great danger of being killed? In order to assess the impact 
of cumulative combat exposures on the index deployment, we constructed a composite 
combat exposure score as an ordinal variable (0, 1, 2, 3+) based on positive responses to the 
4 items.

 A PTSD positive screen was assessed with the Primary Care-PTSD, a 4-item tool that 
measures reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and numbing in the past 30 days. 
Acknowledgement of 3 or 4 items constituted a positive screen (Bliese et al., 2008; Prins & 
Ouimette, 2004). A depression positive screen was assessed with the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-2), a two-item screener used to assess how emotional problems affected 
members’ functioning in the past 30 days. Participants were classified as positive if the score 
was 3 or more from a score of 0–6 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). At-risk drinking 
was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption items 
(AUDIT-C), a validated 12-point scale commonly used with military populations (Bush et 
al., 1998; Crawford, Fulton, Swinkels, Beckham, & Calhoun, 2013). At-risk drinking was 
defined as a score of 3 or more out of a possible 12.
Covariates included age group, race group, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, any child 
dependents with MHS healthcare benefits (yes: single parent, yes: married parent, no), rank 
(junior enlisted/E1–E4, senior enlisted/E5–E9), education, military occupational specialty, 
and any prior deployment to the index deployment (yes/no). A positive TBI screen was 
based on self-reported items of at least one injury event during the index deployment (blast 
or explosion; vehicular accident/crash; fragment wound or bullet wound above the 
shoulders; fall; other event), accompanied by either an alteration or loss of consciousness 
(lost consciousness or got knocked out; felt dazed, confused or saw stars; didn’t remember 
the event).
Data Analysis
All analyses were stratified by component due to possible differences in deployment 
experiences and postdeployment environment. Thus, bivariate tests were not conducted 
comparing AD and NG/R women. We established the prevalence of combat exposure during 
the index deployment, and used multivariate logistic regression to model the odds of 
screening positive for postdeployment behavioral health problems (PTSD, depression, and 
at-risk drinking) using the key independent variable of combat exposure score. Models were 
adjusted for demographic and deployment characteristics, and a positive screen for TBI. We 
conducted sensitivity analyses to determine if one or more combat exposure items had a 
unique association with, and to confirm that each item contributed to the association with, 
each postdeployment behavioral health problem. Sensitivity models included each of the 
four combat exposure items as dummy variables, rather than combat exposure score, in 
relation to the behavioral health outcomes. Multicollinearity diagnostics (i.e., variance 
inflation factor) were performed. We report adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). P values were two-sided. There was missing data for 1% or fewer 
observations for education and occupational specialty. In the models, women with missing 
data were coded as the reference group. Analyses were performed using STATA 12.
Results
AD and NG/R enlisted women had a similar prevalence of postdeployment behavioral health 
problems. Specifically, 10% or fewer women screened positive for PTSD and for depression, 
and almost 23% screened positive for at-risk drinking (Table 1).

 Of Army enlisted women, a substantial number reported being injured, wounded, assaulted 
or hurt during their index deployment, including 17.3% of AD and 29.0% of NG/R women; 
15.5% of AD and 11.7 of NG/R women reported encountering dead bodies/seeing people 
killed; and 19.2% of AD and 18.4% of NG/R women reported feeling in great danger of 
being killed. Only 1.4% of AD women and 0.6% NG/R women fired a weapon. 
Approximately 12.0% had a combat score of 2 or greater (Table 2).
In all multivariate models, AD women who reported any combat exposure on their index 
deployment had increased odds of postdeployment behavioral health problems (Table 3). As 
combat exposure score increased, the odds of screening positive for PTSD increased. 
Specifically, AD women with a combat exposure score of 1 had about four times the odds of 
screening positive for PTSD compared to those with no combat exposure. The odds were 20 
times larger for women with a combat exposure score of 3 or more. As combat score 
increased, AD women had increased odds of a positive screen for depression and at-risk 
drinking, even though the AORs were smaller than those in the PTSD model.
In all multivariate models, being senior enlisted was associated with reduced odds of PTSD, 
depression, and at-risk drinking. Parents of children eligible for MHS healthcare benefits 
had increased odds of PTSD and depression, with reduced odds of at-risk drinking women 
(with the exception of AD married parents and PTSD). Black women were more likely to 
screen positive for PTSD, while less likely to be at-risk drinkers. Women who were 
healthcare specialists had reduced odds of screening positive for depression and increased 
odds of at-risk drinking.
Enlisted NG/R women who reported any combat exposure on their index deployment had 
increased odds of postdeployment behavioral health problems. As combat exposure score 
increased, so did the odds of screening positive for PTSD. For women with a combat 
exposure score of 3+, the odds were 28 times larger relative to women with no combat 
exposure. As combat exposure scores increased, women NG/R members had increased odds 
of a positive screen for depression.
NG/R women who were parents of children eligible for MHS healthcare benefits had 
increased odds of PTSD and depression, with reduced odds of at-risk drinking. Black and 
Asian/Pacific Islander women were more likely to screen positive for depression, while less 
likely to screen positive for at-risk drinking. Women who were healthcare specialists had 
increased odds of at-risk drinking.
Sensitivity analyses revealed only one of the 4 items (not discharging a weapon, which had 
low prevalence) was not significantly associated with increased odds of PTSD, depression, 
and at-risk drinking. Among the combat exposure items, feeling in great danger of being 
killed had the largest AORs. Among AD and NG/R women who reported feeling in great 
danger of being killed, the odds of screening positive for PTSD were 5.28, 95% CI [4.74, 
5.90] and 5.24, 95% CI [4.53, 6.07], respectively (data not shown).

 Discussion
This study examined the prevalence of four types of combat exposure among Army enlisted 
women returning from OEF/OIF, and the relationship between cumulative combat exposure 
score with postdeployment behavioral health problems. Three types of combat exposure 
were commonly reported on a postdeployment questionnaire: being wounded, injured, 
assaulted, or hurt; encountering dead bodies or seeing people killed or wounded; and feeling 
in great danger of being killed.
Our findings indicated any report of combat exposure among Army enlisted women was 
associated with increased odds of each postdeployment behavioral health problem (PTSD, 
depression, and at-risk drinking). This is consistent with findings reported for PTSD and 
depression based on earlier and smaller cohorts (Maguen, Luxton, et al., 2012; Seelig et al., 
2012). Further, this study found cumulative combat exposure score (0–3 or more) appeared 
to have a dose response relationship with PTSD. The magnitude of the association between 
combat exposure and PTSD was most striking, indicating increased odds for any exposure 
(about 4 times relative to no exposure) and extremely high odds associated with 3+ (at least 
20 times the odds or greater). These results are consistent with findings reported by 
Gallaway et al. (2013) on lifetime combat exposure among a predominantly male population 
of Army OIF members from a convenience sample. In two brigade combat teams, as 
cumulative lifetime combat exposure score increased, the odds of behavioral diagnoses of 
PTSD, depression, and adjustment disorder and problematic alcohol use increased, 
compared to those never deployed. To our knowledge, our findings are the first to indicate a 
noteworthy association between cumulative combat exposure and postdeployment 
behavioral health problems among enlisted women.
In all multivariate models, senior enlisted women (E5-E9) had reduced odds of positive 
screens for each postdeployment behavioral health problem compared to women of lower 
rank. Given that time in service is associated with increasing rank; it is possible that 
members who develop problems may be discharged before advancing in rank. Being a 
parent was associated with increased odds of both PTSD and depression, and reduced odds 
of at-risk drinking. This is consistent with studies which found that OEF/OIF women 
veterans with dependent children seeking care at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
were more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis (Janke-Stedronsky et al., 2016), and military 
women who experienced combat exposure after childbirth were at increased risk for 
depression (Nguyen et al., 2013). Further, prior research found that at-risk drinking was 
reduced among young adults when they take on more responsibilities (Schulenberg, 
O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 2005). It is unknown if women parents were less likely to 
engage in at-risk drinking for fear of negative impacts on their children, or because of 
interactions with different peer groups. Enlisted women who were healthcare specialists had 
increased odds of at-risk drinking, consistent with findings that enlisted healthcare providers 
are at increased risk for postdeployment psychiatric morbidity (Mayo, Macgregor, 
Dougherty, & Galarneau, 2013). We cannot predict how DoD occupation may relate to these 
outcomes in the future when some women will achieve assignment to direct combat 
occupations.

 There are limitations to our study. We excluded members who completed the pre-2008 
version of the questionnaire, which did not include several of the measures examined, as 
well as those with a poor match between the date on the deployment record and 
questionnaire (i.e., outside of 60 days; Larson, Mohr, Adams, Wooten, & Williams, 2014). 
Further, the DoD’s postdeployment questionnaire is not anonymous or voluntary, and the 
lack of anonymity may contribute to underreporting of postdeployment problems (Warner et 
al., 2011).
Our assessment of combat exposure would be improved if the questionnaire included 
additional items from the 33-item Combat Experiences Scale, which has a reliability of .93 
(Pietrzak et al., 2010). We have located no studies of the relationship of these self-report 
measures and other objective measures of injury or being fired upon. Our measure of 
cumulative combat exposure was specific only to the index deployment, rather than lifetime 
combat exposure; 35.2% of AD and 23.8% of NG/R women had prior deployments. Further, 
the combat exposure measure did not assess the possibility of multiple exposures for each 
item. Regarding the association of marital status and children, we did not have the ability to 
discern which women were in dual-military families, which may contribute to additional 
stresses if the spouse has also been deployed.
Despite these limitations, our research has important strengths. The current study contributes 
to growing literature on the impacts of combat exposure on postdeployment behavioral 
health problems among women, and benefits from a large, population-based sample of both 
AD and NG/R Army women returning from recent OEF/OIF deployments. We uniquely 
assess the impact of a cumulative combat exposure score on the behavioral health outcomes 
and demonstrate that for PTSD in particular there was a large magnitude, dose response 
relationship. Importantly, any report of combat exposure increased the risk for each 
postdeployment problem, suggesting the impact of even one exposure event should not be 
overlooked. The most common combat exposure among NG/R women was being wounded, 
injured, assaulted or hurt (29.0%), which was also common among AD women (17.3%). It is 
unclear if this item captures military sexual assault during deployment as the health 
questionnaire does not include a direct assessment of military sexual assault. Prior studies 
show military sexual assault is a risk factor for PTSD and depression (Cobb et al., 2014; 
Hankin et al., 1999; Kang, Dalager, Mahan, & Ishii, 2005), and combat exposure among 
women is associated with sexual harassment and assault (Barth et al., 2016; Leardmann et 
al., 2013; Maguen, Cohen, et al., 2012). Our findings suggest greater attention is needed to 
the deployment events identified as injuries or assaults among women, and how this may 
differ by component, so effective prevention strategies can be implemented.
Army enlisted women with postdeployment behavioral health problems who are discharged 
from the military may transition from the MHS to VHA due to functional impairment and 
increased healthcare utilization (Hoge, Terhakopian, Castro, Messer, & Engel, 2007; Hoge et 
al., 2005). Additional outreach is needed to increase the likelihood that Army women who 
served in OEF/OIF are aware of, and appropriately use, VHA care once discharged from the 
military (Harris et al., 2014), and to ensure continuity of care for those utilizing the VHA. 
There is evidence in both the MHS and VHA that women may have more unmet needs for 
access to substance use treatment compared to males (Chatterjee et al., 2009; Wooten et al., 
Adams et al.

 2013). Gender-specific health care (e.g., Women’s Health Clinics and same-sex providers) is 
preferred among women veterans seen at VHA facilities (Bean-Mayberry, Chang, McNeil, 
Hayes, & Scholle, 2004). Future studies are needed to follow this sample of Army women 
with combat exposure as they discharge from the military and enter the VHA. Further, 
because NG/R women may not seek care in military or veteran facilities, service women 
may benefit if DoD and VHA policymakers develop collaborations with public and private 
community-based organizations.
