CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
ABSTRACT: Sleep is increasingly recognized as an important lifestyle 
contributor to health. However, this has not always been the case, and an 
increasing number of Americans choose to curtail sleep in favor of other 
social, leisure, or work-related activities. This has resulted in a decline in 
average sleep duration over time. Sleep duration, mostly short sleep, and 
sleep disorders have emerged as being related to adverse cardiometabolic 
risk, including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
cardiovascular disease. Here, we review the evidence relating sleep 
duration and sleep disorders to cardiometabolic risk and call for health 
organizations to include evidence-based sleep recommendations in their 
guidelines for optimal health.
T
he ubiquity of public health reports touting the importance of sleep has led to an 
increased interest in understanding the extent of sleep problems at the popula-
tion level and their associated negative effects on various cardiometabolic health 
outcomes. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National 
Institutes of Health, ≈50 to 70 million US adults suffer from a sleep disorder or report 
insufficient sleep habitually.1 Although many individuals may opt to curtail their bedtime 
to pursue personal/professional goals or social obligations, a sizable portion may be ex-
periencing sleep problems originating from a medical or psychosocial cause. Insomnia, 
the most common sleep disorder, is likely present in 5% to 15% of the US population, 
with ≈30% reporting significant symptoms at any given time.2 Sleep apnea, another 
common sleep disorder defined as at least 5 respiratory events (apnea or hypopnea) per 
hour of sleep on average, has an estimated prevalence of 27% to 34% among men 30 
to 70 years of age and 9% to 28% among women in the same age group.3
The impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia on cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and metabolic disorders is striking.4,5 Population-based studies show 
that individuals with OSA or insomnia are at significantly greater risk for CVD and 
cerebrovascular diseases (eg, arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease 
[CHD], heart failure, hypertension, and stroke) and metabolic disorders (eg, obesity, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia).6–11 Of note, both OSA and insomnia are 
associated with insufficient sleep durations, which may have independent effects on 
these chronic diseases.12 Below, we provide a brief description of sleep disorders 
and inadequate sleep duration (short sleep, defined as <7 h/night, or long sleep, 
defined as ≥9 h/night, unless otherwise noted) and provide evidence of the preva-
lence of these sleep-related problems in the general population and their effects on 
overall cardiometabolic health. A search of Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and 
clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in February 2015 with the following search terms:

human subjects research published on or after 2005 in 
the English language.
OSA is the most prevalent sleep disordered breathing 
(SDB) condition, caused by a repeated narrowing of the 
upper airway during sleep. The most common charac-
teristics include periods of breathing cessations, oxygen 
desaturations, and repetitive awakenings during sleep. 
Individuals with OSA often report a history of snoring, 
poor memory, morning headaches, and daytime sleepi-
ness.13 Some individuals with OSA may also experience 
comorbid insomnia and short sleep. It is estimated that 
≈10% of men and 3% of women <50 years of age have 
OSA, with estimates rising to 17% and 9% for men and 
women ≥50 years of age, respectively.3 Available data 
also suggest that OSA may be more prevalent among in-
dividuals of minority backgrounds.14 In fact, a study com-
paring blacks and whites 2 to 86 years of age found that 
31% of blacks had OSA compared with 10% of whites.14
Insomnia, which may be a manifestation of a medical 
or psychiatric condition, is characterized by 3 primary 
symptoms: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying 
asleep, and early morning awakenings that occur at least 
3 nights a week for at least 3 months; some individuals 
also complain of feeling tired on awakening. According 
to a number of epidemiological studies, the prevalence 
of insomnia symptoms in the previous year ranges from 
30% to 45%.15 Although this condition is relatively com-
mon, only 6% of people with insomnia receive a diagno-
sis.16 Of note, women and those ≥65 years of age are 
more likely to report insomnia symptoms, although men 
and women from lower socioeconomic positions and 
education levels also tend to complain of insomnia.16
Recent evidence that habitual sleep duration is a risk 
factor for cardiometabolic conditions has given rise to 
multiple epidemiological and surveillance studies. The 
preponderance of evidence emanating from self-report-
ed data suggests a curvilinear relationship between 
habitual sleep duration and various medical conditions 
(eg, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) such 
that both short sleep duration (SSD) and long sleep du-
ration are associated with those conditions.17 Published 
data suggest that SSD, defined in the extant literature 
as sleep durations <7 hours,18 may have gradually in-
creased over the past 40 years. Using data from the 
National Health Interview Survey, investigators examined 
trends in the prevalence of SSD, finding that it has, in 
fact, gradually increased, with 21.6% of US adults re-
porting SSD in 1977 compared with 29.1% in 2009.19 
Notably, these prevalence estimates were comparable to 
estimates derived from the Sleep Heart Health Study.20 
Indeed, available data suggest that 27.5% of American 
adults reported SSD in 2005.21
In terms of long sleep, defined as sleep durations 
≥9 hours, data suggest that its prevalence may have 
decreased from 11.6% reported in 1977 to 7.8% in 
2009.19 This reduction in the prevalence of long sleep 
duration could simply be a reflection of the gradual 
decline in overall sleep duration, as has been demon-
strated in other published studies. Examination of data 
gathered from 1959 to 2005 revealed a decrease in 
modal sleep durations of ≈1.5 hours.22 On balance, a 
recent systematic review suggested that long sleep 
may be a greater concern than SSD,23 although experi-
mental findings strongly indicate that SSD, rather than 
long sleep, is associated with adverse physiological and 
immunological consequences.24–27 Self-reported sleep 
durations may be affected by various factors, including 
demographic profiles, family structure, socioeconomic 
position, employment status, health risk behavior, and 
general health status.28 The lack of objective measures 
of sleep duration in the majority of large-scale epidemio-
logical studies is certainly a limitation that we wish to ac-
knowledge at the forefront of this review. Nonetheless, 
despite the potential confounders introduced by the use 
of self-reports, these studies provide a valuable frame-
work that warrants additional investigation using objec-
tive measures of sleep.
In this report, we review the epidemiological and 
clinical evidence relating sleep duration and some sleep 
disorders (insomnia/insomnia symptoms, SDB, periodic 
limb movement disorder, restless leg syndrome) to ma-
jor risk factors for CVD such as obesity, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and hypertension, as well as CVD.

Epidemiological Evidence
Many epidemiological studies have described associa-
tions between self-reported habitual SSD and obesity. A 
meta-analysis by Cappuccio and colleagues29 found that 
across 23 studies of adults, a pooled odds ratio of 1.55 
was found. Furthermore, analysis of 7 studies that ex-
amined linear relationships between sleep duration and 
body mass index as a continuous variable showed that 
for every increased hour of sleep, body mass index was 
reduced by 0.35 points.29 These findings are echoed in

CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
several qualitative reviews on this topic,30–38 which all 
agree that individuals with habitual SSD are more likely 
to be obese than those with normal sleep habits (gener-
ally 7–8 hours of sleep a night).
Among these cross-sectional studies, several have 
identified important moderators of effects. For example, 
analyses of nationally representative data collected as 
part of the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System made 2 notable findings on the sleep-obesity 
relationship. First, this analysis found that although the 
majority of individuals with SSD slept in the 5- to 6-hour 
range, the most pronounced effects were seen among 
those reporting ≤4 hours of sleep per night.39 This find-
ing suggested that risk varied across sleep duration; very 
short sleep (which more closely resembled sleep dura-
tion achieved in acute sleep restriction studies) seemed 
to carry greater risk than more typical short sleep. The 
second important finding in this study was that the re-
lationship to obesity was independent of self-reported 
perceived sleep insufficiency.39 A pair of notable studies 
that analyzed data from the 2007 to 2008 NHANES (Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey) found that 
the relation between sleep duration and obesity depends 
on age40 and race/ethnicity.41 Specifically, the relation 
between SSD and obesity is stronger among younger 
than among older adults.40 This finding is consistent 
with many studies that show that sleep loss in children 
and adolescents is a consistent risk factor for obesity in 
those groups.42 Furthermore, the relationship between 
SSD and obesity varies among blacks and whites,41 with 
blacks in the United States being disproportionately af-
fected by SSD with respect to obesity risk.43
Although cross-sectional studies often have the ben-
efit of increased sample size and statistical power, it is 
impossible to determine the direction of effects. Further 
complicating this is the wording of survey items, which 
tends to focus on recent habitual sleep duration relative 
to obesity, which presumably developed over a much 
longer period. Thus, studies of incident weight gain and 
obesity are particularly helpful in this regard. Several 
key studies have identified habitual SSD as a risk fac-
tor for incident weight gain and obesity. In a landmark 
analysis of data from the Nurses’ Health Study, women 
sleeping ≤5 hours a night on average gained 1.14 kg 
more weight over 16 years and women sleeping 6 hours 
gained 0.71 kg more weight compared with women 
sleeping at least 7 hours.44 Furthermore, those sleeping 
≤5 or 6 hours were 32% and 12% more likely to gain 15 
kg over the 16-year follow-up period, respectively. These 
findings were replicated and extended with data from the 
Québec Family Study showing that over the course of 6 
years, habitual short sleepers were more likely to gain 
weight and to have increased waist circumference and 
percent body fat compared with normal-duration sleep-
ers. Notably, there was a U-shaped relationship in which 
a similar pattern was seen for habitual long sleepers.45 
In a study of male Japanese workers,46 habitual sleep 
duration of <6 hours was associated with increased like-
lihood of developing obesity over the course of 1 year. 
Taken together, these and other studies suggest that 
habitual SSD leads to weight gain and obesity over time.
Several possible reasons for this exist. As described 
below, habitual SSD may lead to metabolic changes and 
cardiometabolic risk factors. In addition, SSD could lead 
to neurocognitive changes that could result in weight 
gain, including impaired judgment and decision making, 
which could presumably alter food choice,47 and fatigue 
and tiredness, which could result in decreased physical 
activity. Additionally, sleep loss may lead to increased 
food intake despite little change in energy expenditure, 
leading to a positive energy balance.48
An emerging evidence base suggests that SSD is 
related to food intake. Among factory workers in Ja-
pan, SSD was associated with more snacking between 
meals, more irregular eating habits, less consumption 
of vegetables, and a greater preference for strongly 
flavored food.49 In the United States, a study of 459 
postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health 
Initiative examined relationships between dietary records 
and sleep diary and actigraphy variables.50 This study 
showed that SSD, measured objectively with actigraphy, 
was strongly associated with higher intakes of many di-
etary fat–related variables.
From nationally representative data, analysis of the 
2007 to 2008 NHANES showed that self-reported long 
sleepers consumed fewer calories than 7- to 8-hour 
sleepers.51 Additionally, very short (<5 hours), short 
(5–6 hours), and long sleepers consumed a smaller va-
riety of foods (fewer number of foods consumed on the 
measurement day) compared with 7- to 8-hour sleepers. 
In an examination of nutrient profiles, very short sleep 
and long sleep were associated with lower consumption 
of protein, carbohydrate, fiber, and fat relative to 7- to 
8-hour sleep (long sleepers consumed less sugar, and 
short sleepers consumed less fiber). These observa-
tions were made after adjustment for other dietary in-
take variables, including total caloric intake.51 Data thus 
suggest that SSD is associated with poor dietary quality.
Epidemiological data linking sleep duration with en-
ergy expenditure are relatively scarce. The reason may 
be that the relationship between sleep and energy expen-
diture is complex. For example, analysis of >300 
000 
respondents to the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System showed that self-reported perceived sleep 
insufficiency was associated with self-reported physical 
activity variables but that this relationship was generally 
nonlinear. Moderate exercise was generally not associ-
ated with insufficient sleep for values up to ≈1 h/d, and 
vigorous physical activity was nonlinearly but generally 
associated with greater insufficient sleep, which was 
consistent with employment data showing that manual 
labor was associated with more insufficient sleep than

jobs that included mostly sitting or standing. In contrast, 
however, those engaging in no activity reported more 
insufficient sleep than those engaging in some activity.52
This finding is consistent with data from a previous 
wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
that found that those individuals who reported any ex-
ercise in the past 30 days (regardless of amount) were 
about a third less likely to report sleep disturbances and 
about half as likely to report daytime tiredness.53 This 
is consistent with data from the National Sleep Founda-
tion that found that increased sedentary time was as-
sociated with poorer sleep quality.54 Also consistent with 
the data on insufficient sleep, there was no relationship 
between sedentary time and sleep duration. It may even 
be the case that shorter sleepers get more exercise on 
average. In data from the 2007 to 2008 NHANES, min-
utes of moderate and vigorous exercise differed across 
sleep duration groups; the shortest sleepers reported 
the most exercise, and the longest sleepers reported 
the least.51
The relationships between sleep and energy expendi-
ture are clearly complex and may not be well measured 
at the population level. For example, there may be sub-
groups of short sleepers who, by virtue of having more 
wake time, are more physically active, whereas others 
who sleep poorly have less energy and ability to be ac-
tive. It seems to be the case, however, that decreased 
physical activity plays a role in the relation between 
sleep and CVD. In an analysis of data from the National 
Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study, SSD 
predicted CVD mortality, especially among overweight 
and obese people, and the combination of SSD, low 
physical activity, and overweight status was associated 
with an increased likelihood of all-cause, cardiovascular, 
and cancer-related mortality.55
Epidemiological evidence thus clearly describes a re-
lation between SSD and increased energy intakes. Much 
less clear is the relation between sleep duration and 
physical activity level. Given the association between 
SSD and obesity, however, the preponderance of evi-
dence suggests a mismatch between energy intake and 
energy expenditure favoring a positive energy balance. 
This is assessed in clinical intervention studies.
Clinical Evidence
Impact of Sleep Restriction on Energy Intake
Several studies have assessed energy intake after peri-
ods of sleep restriction, usually 4 hours in bed, relative 
to periods of habitual sleep, usually 8 to 10 hours in 
bed.56–64 With 2 exceptions,57,60 studies have generally 
been performed in normal-weight individuals. In gener-
al, studies reported increases in 24-hour energy intake 
when participants underwent sleep restriction relative 
to habitual sleep (Table 1), with the degree of overeat-
ing ranging from ≈180 to 559 kcal/d. Few studies also 
reported no difference in energy intake56,63,64 between 
sleep conditions. One of those studies was a small study 
with young men and women randomized to either sleep 
restriction or habitual sleep that found a significant in-
crease in food intake with sleep restriction relative to 
baseline but no between-group difference.56 The other 
2 studies were performed exclusively in young, healthy 
men.63,64 One study reported greater hunger ratings but 
no difference in intake at a single late-afternoon buffet 
meal after a period of sleep restriction.63 The other study 
reported greater fat intake but not total energy intake 
after sleep restriction.64
Several mechanisms have been posited to explain 
the greater energy intake observed after periods of 
sleep restriction. Studies have reported alterations in 
appetite-regulating hormones, particularly leptin and 
ghrelin but also glucagon-like peptide 1 in women. 
However, data in this area are mixed,34 with studies 
showing increased,57,59,65–68 reduced,69,70 or no differ-
ence in 56,63,64,71,72 leptin levels with sleep restriction. 
Similarly, ghrelin levels have been reported to be in-
creased69,70,72–74 or not different56,60,64,71 with sleep re-
striction relative to habitual sleep. Only 1 study reported 
glucagon-like peptide 1,72 showing reduced levels with 
sleep restriction relative to habitual sleep in women 
but not in men. Neuroimaging studies have highlighted 
a role of the neuronal reward network in response to 
foods as an attempt to explain enhanced food intake 
after periods of sleep restriction.75–77 Conclusions from 
those studies are in line with data showing that par-
ticipants select larger portion sizes, even in the sated 
state,74 and report greater food purchases78 in mock 
portion size and supermarket tasks, respectively, after 
a night of total sleep deprivation relative to an 8-hour 
sleep opportunity.
Impact of Sleep Restriction on Energy Expenditure
On the flip side of the energy balance equation, data on 
the effects of sleep duration on energy expenditure are 
also mixed.34 This is due in part to the multicomponent 
nature of energy expenditure: total energy expenditure, 
resting metabolic rate, sleeping metabolic rate, physical 
activity energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogen-
esis, as well as the multiple ways by which energy expen-
diture can be assessed: actigraphy/accelerometry, indi-
rect calorimetry, metabolic chamber, and doubly labeled 
water. Studies that have examined the impact of sleep 
duration on resting metabolic rate using indirect calorim-
etry have found either no difference57,62,79–81 or a lower 
resting metabolic rate69 with sleep restriction relative to 
habitual sleep. As part of a weight loss diet, sleep re-
striction leads to greater reduction in resting metabolic 
rate than habitual sleep.73
When 24-hour energy expenditure was measured 
by doubly labeled water, no difference between sleep 
restriction relative to habitual sleep was observed.60,75

CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
However, when 24-hour energy expenditure was mea-
sured in a metabolic chamber, which provides a more 
confined environment, energy expenditure was increased 
with sleep restriction relative to habitual sleep.59,82,83 The 
increase in energy expenditure associated with sleep re-
striction could be accounted for by the added cost of 
maintaining wakefulness.
Finally, free-living physical activity assessed by ac-
celerometry seems to be minimally altered. Some 
have reported lower high-intensity activity and higher 
low-intensity activity with sleep restriction,62,64 whereas 
others56,57 have found no difference in physical activ-
ity energy expenditure. On the other hand, when sleep 
duration was reduced as a result of sleep fragmenta-
tion, physical activity was increased.71 Such observa-
tions were also made in a crossover sleep restriction 
study, but the difference between sleep conditions was 
estimated to be an ≈48-kcal greater expenditure with 
sleep restriction.58 Nonetheless, differences in energy 
expenditure with sleep restriction do not appear to be 
sufficient to counter the increase in energy intake re-
ported above.
Data therefore do not support a fundamental altera-
tion in energy metabolism as a result of SSD. In fact, 
as a result of added time awake, resting energy expen-
diture is increased when sleep is restricted. However,

clinical intervention studies have not provided sufficient 
information to conclude on the impact of sleep restric-
tion on physical activity level. This area of research 
should be expanded.
Impact of Sleep Restriction on Body Weight
Studies that have assessed the impact of sleep restric-
tion on change in body weight in the context of ad libi-
tum feeding have mostly been small, short-term stud-
ies.57,59–61,73,84 One study57 showed an increase of 0.4 
kg in body weight in women as sleep was progressively 
restricted from >8 h/night at baseline to 4 h/night over 
4 nights, and another study59 found weight gain over a 
5-night period of 5 hours in bed relative to 9 hours in 
normal-weight men and women in a crossover study. In a 
2-arm study, individuals undergoing sleep restriction to 4 
h/night for 5 nights gained more weight than those pro-
vided an 8-hour sleep opportunity, with the weight gain 
being greater in men than women and in blacks com-
pared with whites.61 Longer-term studies, however, have 
not found an impact of sleep restriction on body weight. 
There was no difference in change in body weight as-
sessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry when par-
ticipants were provided a 5.5-hour sleep opportunity 
relative to 8.5 hours for 14 days as inpatients,60 nor was 
body weight different from baseline after 3 weeks of a 
1.5-hour sleep restriction relative to habitual sleep in an 
outpatient study conducted exclusively in men.84 In the 
latter study, however, there was a significant treatment-
by-week interaction such that weight was initially reduced 
in the sleep restriction group and rose back to baseline 
between weeks 2 and 3. It is unknown whether body 
weight would have continued in an upward trajectory had 
the study been prolonged beyond 3 weeks. Studies are 
needed to evaluate the longer-term impact of sleep re-
striction on energy balance with weight status and body 
composition as the outcome variables.
One study was conducted as a controlled-feeding 
weight loss study in which participants concurrently 
underwent sleep restriction or habitual sleep for 14 
days in a crossover design.73 Because of the con-
trolled-feeding nature of the study, participants lost an 
equivalent amount of weight in both sleep conditions. 
However, in the sleep restriction condition, partici-
pants lost more fat-free mass and less fat mass than 
when the same weight loss treatment was performed 
with an 8-hour sleep opportunity. Whether similar results 
are observed in the context of weight gain remains to 
be determined.
Overall, there is good agreement that sleep restric-
tion increases energy intake, and evidence shows that 
this is not accompanied by an adequate compensation 
via increased energy expenditure. Although data are 
mixed and somewhat inconclusive in terms of the impact 
of sleep restriction on energy expenditure, the net result 
seems to be positive energy balance, with studies show-
ing a strong impact of sleep restriction on increased food 
intake, particularly from fat and snacks,60,62,64 at least in 
the short term. Studies are needed to assess the longer-

Epidemiological Findings
Epidemiological research has reported the association 
between sleep duration, quality, and cardiometabolic 
risk. These topics have been the subject of several me-
ta-analyses, which are described below and summarized 
in Table 2. In fact, emerging cross-sectional data have 
shown that SSD is consistently associated with meta-
bolic syndrome (a constellation of symptoms, including 
elevated waist circumference, lipids, fasting glucose, 
and blood pressure). Specifically, SSD is positively as-
sociated with the odds or risk of developing the meta-
bolic syndrome,85–91 with similar metabolic effects being 
shown in individuals with long sleep duration.85,87
Diabetes Mellitus
Two recent meta-analyses on the association between 
SSD and development of diabetes mellitus have been pub-
lished.92,93 The findings were similar, showing an ≈30% 
increased risk. The first, based on 7 studies, showed a 
relative risk (RR) of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.03–1.60) with evidence of heterogeneity; there was a 
significant effect in men but not women.92 The second 
meta-analysis, based on 10 studies, showed an odds 
ratio of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.20–1.48) without evidence of

heterogeneity.93 Only 1 meta-analysis, based on 6 stud-
ies, found an association between long sleep duration 
and development of diabetes mellitus (RR=1.48; 95% CI, 
1.13–1.96) without statistically significant heterogene-
ity.92 Potential confounders were variably adjusted for in 
the original studies included in these meta-analyses.89,90 
The minority of studies included adjustment for snoring, 
but none adjusted for SDB.
Hypertension
The association between SSD and hypertension has 
also been well studied in 3 recent meta-analyses. Two 
showed similar results without evidence of heterogene-
ity (RR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.05–1.40 based on 6 studies94; 
and RR=1.23; 95% CI, 1.06–1.42 based on 5 studies95). 
However, the other meta-analysis, based on 6 studies, 
did not find an association between SSD and the risk of in-
cident hypertension (RR=1.11; 95% CI, 0.84–1.47) with 
evidence of heterogeneity across studies.96 The risk was 
increased among those <65 years of age but was not 
increased in those ≥65 years of age without heteroge-
neity within each sex subgroup.96 Potential confounders 
were variably adjusted for in the original studies included 
in these meta-analyses.91–93 Unaccounted-for variables 
such as SDB could represent potential confounders of 
the SSD-hypertension association. Despite associations 
between long sleep duration and prevalent hyperten-
sion,96 3 meta-analyses, each based on 5 studies, have 
been reported recently, and none found an association 
between long sleep duration and the development of hy-
pertension.94–96 Of note, whereas associations of SSD 
and some cardiometabolic risk factors are typically sig-
nificant in young but not older adults, no difference was 
found between age groups <65 or >65 years of age in 
the association between long sleep and hypertension.96
Cardiovascular Disease
A meta-analysis based on 7 studies demonstrated an in-
creased risk of developing or dying of CHD associated 
with both SSD (RR=1.48; 95% CI, 1.22–1.80) and long 
sleep duration (RR=1.38; 95% CI, 1.15–1.66) with some 
heterogeneity.97 Sex, geographical area, and duration of 
follow-up were explored as potential causes of heteroge-
neity, but none contributed to this effect. Sleep-inducing 
medications, perhaps used more frequently in those with 
SSD, could modify the effect of SSD on CHD or serve as 
a potential confounder of the SSD-CHD association but 
were not explored in these meta-analyses. In a separate 
study,98 SSD and CHD mortality were associated among 
those who used tranquilizers or hypnotics regularly or 
rarely but not in those who never used them, supporting 
the possibility of effect modification.
A meta-analysis based on 4 studies identified a 
modest association between SSD and incident stroke 
(RR=1.15; 95% CI, 1.00–1.31) with no heterogeneity 
across studies.97 In this meta-analysis, there was also 
an association between long sleep duration and stroke 
(RR=1.65; 95% CI. 1.45–1.87) with no heterogeneity 
across studies.97
A meta-analysis found no association between SSD 
and total CVD (including any CVD-related cause of death) 
despite associations with CHD and stroke with no het-
erogeneity across studies.97 There was, however, an as-
sociation between long sleep duration and the combina-
tion of incident CVD and CVD mortality (RR=1.41; 95% 
CI, 1.19–1.68) with heterogeneity across studies that 
was not attributable to sex, follow-up duration, or geo-
graphical location. Of note, a recent study not included 
in this meta-analysis showed a significant association 
between SSD, but not long sleep duration, and CVD in 
less healthy individuals (hazard ratio [HR]=1.38; 95% 
CI, 1.12–1.70), defined as having a serious illness at 
baseline or Medical Outcomes Study Physical Function-
ing score <75.93 There was no association in healthy 
individuals (HR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.75–1.14).
Impact of Sleep restriction on Cardiometabolic 
risk Factors
Insulin Resistance
Sleep restriction contributes to and is associated with 
a variety of adverse metabolic outcomes. Experimental 
sleep restriction in healthy adults results in increases in 
insulin resistance99 and decreases in insulin sensitivity.81 
SSD is associated with increases in fasting insulin and 
hemoglobin A1c, which may be mediated by body mass 
index.100 Sleep restriction is associated with a 3-fold in-
crease in the odds of having impaired fasting glucose,26 
which may be driven by insulin resistance.26,84 Under 
controlled laboratory conditions, consecutive daily sleep 
restriction of ≈2 hours results in increased insulin resis-
tance and decreased glucose tolerance in response to a 
glucose challenge.101
Cardiovascular and Proinflammatory Markers
Researchers have examined the effect of sleep restric-
tion on blood pressure outcomes (systolic, diastolic, and 
nocturnal blood pressure dipping, a disturbance in the 
normal circadian blood pressure pattern). In a crossover 
trial, healthy younger and older adults were randomized 
to either 24 hours including habitual sleep or 24 hours 
of total sleep deprivation. Normotensive older adults ex-
perienced a 13–mm 
Hg increase in systolic blood pres-
sure and a 7–mm 
Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure 
after sleep deprivation compared with habitual sleep.102 
Nocturnal blood pressure dipping also decreases after 
restricted sleep (<6.5 hours),103,104 which may further 
increase CVD risk.
Sleep restriction has been shown to affect a variety 
of other cardiovascular markers. In a randomized, cross-
over trial of younger healthy adult men, 5 nights of re-
stricted sleep (<5 hours) in a laboratory setting resulted 
 
in an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity

(increased low-frequency heart rate variability and de-
crease in high-frequency heart rate variability), an in-
crease in serum norepinephrine, and a decrease in maxi-
mum endothelium-dependent venodilation compared with 
5 nights of habitual sleep of >7 hours.105 Similarly, 40 
hours of total sleep deprivation under controlled labora-
tory conditions resulted in increases in proinflammatory 
markers (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, e-selectin, 
interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein) and a de-
crease in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (an anti-inflam-
matory marker).106 Relatedly, healthy adults subjected 
to restricted sleep (4 hours of time in bed) over 5 con-
secutive nights experienced an increase in proinflamma-
tory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, interleukin-17, 
mRNA) compared with those who underwent 8 hours of 
habitual time in bed.107 Finally, in a randomized, crossover 
trial, young normal-weight adults who underwent 5 nights 
of SSD (<4 hours) or 5 nights of habitual sleep (>9 hours) 
showed no significant differences in lipid profile between 
sleep conditions.

Epidemiological Findings
Diabetes Mellitus
No meta-analysis was available to assess the relation be-
tween insomnia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, 
a meta-analysis based on 5 studies corroborated an as-
sociation between insomnia symptoms such as difficulty 
initiating sleep and the development of diabetes mellitus 
(RR=1.57; 95% CI, 1.25–1.97) and difficulty maintaining 
sleep and incident diabetes mellitus (RR=1.84; 95% CI, 
1.39–2.43).92 No heterogeneity was noted across studies.
A meta-analysis based on 6 studies addressed the 
association between SDB and diabetes mellitus.108 This 
analysis found that moderate to severe SDB (apnea/hy-
popnea index [AHI] ≥15) was associated with a greater 
risk of the development of diabetes mellitus compared 
with the absence of SDB. Data from 3 studies of indi-
viduals with mild SDB compared with those without SDB 
showed that there was no association with the develop-
ment of diabetes mellitus (RR=1.22; 95% CI, 0.91–1.63).
Hypertension
Studies that have investigated the association between 
insomnia symptoms and the development of hyperten-
sion have shown mixed or nuanced results. Based on 
subjective symptoms only, a modest association be-
tween combined insomnia symptoms (RR=1.05; 95% 
CI, 1.01–1.08)94 or some combination of symptoms 
such as difficulty falling asleep or waking up repeatedly 
and the development of hypertension has been found.109 
Although another study in a relatively healthy older co-
hort showed that insomnia symptoms were protective 
against the development of hypertension in adjusted 
models only in men who were not black, no association 
was identified in women or blacks.110 The association 
of sleep disturbance symptoms is complicated by an 
interaction with objective measures of sleep duration. 
For instance, chronic insomnia with ≥6 hours of objec-
tive sleep was not associated with the development of 
hypertension, whereas those symptoms, in combination 
with SSD, were associated with the development of hy-
pertension when adjusted for potential confounders.111 
Another study found that insomnia was associated with 
the development of hypertension after adjustment for 
sleep duration in individuals 32 to 59 years of age but 
not in those 60 to 86 years of age.112
A previous American Heart Association scientific 
statement reviewed the evidence in support of a rela-
tion between SDB and hypertension, referring to SDB 
as an identifiable cause of hypertension.113 Longitudinal 
studies since that time have confirmed an association 
between severe SDB (AHI ≥30) and new-onset hyperten-
sion in the elderly114 but did not show an association 
between objectively measured SDB and incident hyper-
tension in middle-aged adults after adjustment.115 Fur-
thermore, the Sleep Heart Health Study demonstrated 
an association between an AHI ≥30 and the development 
of hypertension, but this association was no longer sig-
nificant after adjustment for body mass index. Associa-
tions were present after adjustment in women and those 
with a body mass index ≤27.3 kg/m2.116
Cardiovascular Disease
Studies that have investigated the association between 
insomnia symptoms and CHD have generally found an 
association, although sex differences may exist. Rest-
less, disturbed nights (a combination of response op-
tions of “rather more than usual” and “much more than 
usual”) have been found to be associated with CHD af-
ter adjustment for confounders.117 After adjustment for 
potential confounders, including depression and anxiety, 
difficulty initiating sleep almost every night, difficulty 
maintaining sleep almost every night, and a feeling of 
nonrestorative sleep more than once a week were as-
sociated with acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared 
with never experiencing these sleep difficulties.118 In this 
study, the number of insomnia symptoms was associ-
ated with MI risk in a dose-dependent fashion.118 The re-
lationship between insomnia symptoms and MI appeared 
to be stronger in women than men.118 In another study 
with full adjustment, incident MI was associated with dif-
ficulty maintaining sleep in women but not men. Difficulty 
initiating sleep was not significantly associated with CHD 
in women or men.119 Additionally, in an all-male study, 
frequent insomnia was no longer significantly associated 
with CHD after adjustment for potential confounders.120
Few studies have addressed the association between 
insomnia and incident stroke, but in general, the results

have supported an association. In an all-male prospec-
tive cohort study, frequent insomnia was associated 
with incident stroke after adjustment for potential con-
founders.120 Similarly, in a study of working-aged adults, 
insomnia symptoms were associated with self-reported 
stroke after adjustment for demographics, anxiety, and 
depression.121 Finally, a retrospective cohort study found 
that insomnia was associated with hospitalization for 
stroke on the basis of diagnosis codes.122
A meta-analysis based on 13 studies corroborated 
the association between insomnia symptoms and devel-
oping or dying of CVD (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.29–1.62).123 
However, 1 study identified an association between in-
somnia symptoms and CVD only in those with both SSD 
and poor-quality sleep.124
SDB is a group of sleep pathologies that include OSA 
and is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns 
during sleep. Although SDB, detected by polysomnog-
raphy, has been linked to the development of CHD, the 
association does not appear to be statistically signifi-
cant.125 Three meta-analyses, each with evidence of at 
least moderate heterogeneity, showed nonsignificant as-
sociations.125–127 A cohort study in women published only 
since the meta-analyses supported the nonsignificant as-
sociation between untreated SDB and the development 
of CHD compared with no SDB (AHI <10).128
In a meta-analysis, studies using both clinical popula-
tions referred for polysomnography because of suspicion 
of SDB and community-based samples have shown an as-
sociation between SDB and the development of ischemic 
stroke.129 The overall association was an RR of 2.10 (95% 
CI, 1.50–2.93) in 10 studies.129 Other meta-analyses have 
shown a similar association between severe SDB and 
stroke.125,126 It has been noted that better evidence exists 
in men.125 In the single study available in women only, the 
association was not significant.125 However, since these 
meta-analyses were published, a prospective cohort study 
performed in women found a clear association between 
SDB and incident stroke (HR=6.44; 95% CI, 1.46–28.3).128
For the combined outcome of CVD, moderate and 
severe SDB, but not mild SDB, was shown to be associ-
ated with an elevated risk.126 The pooled RR of CVD per 
10-unit increase in AHI was 1.17 on the basis of 6 pro-
spective cohort studies.
Another sleep disorder, restless leg syndrome, has 
been investigated as a CVD risk factor. Although findings 
from prospective cohort studies have been mixed with re-
spect to the association between restless leg syndrome 
and the development of CVD, the majority of the studies 
have been negative. No association between restless 
leg syndrome and stroke, MI, or major cardiovascular 
events was found in age-adjusted or multivariable-adjust-
ed analyses from 2 large, single-sex, prospective cohort 
studies of health professionals, the Physicians Health 
Study and the Women’s Health Study.130 In an all-male 
study, the symptom of restless legs was not associated 
with CHD after adjustment for potential confounders.120 
In the Nurses’ Health Study, longer duration of restless 
leg syndrome diagnosis (>3 years) was associated with 
CHD and nonfatal MI in adjusted models in women.131 The 
diagnosis of restless leg syndrome for <3 years at base-
line was not associated with the development of CHD or 
MI.131 In an all-male study, the symptom of restless legs 
(restless legs or bothersome twitches once or twice a 
week or more) was associated with the development of 
stroke120 after adjustment for potential confounders. In 
those with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, a 
population with a high prevalence of restless legs, nei-
ther continuous restless leg syndrome symptoms nor 
intermittent symptoms were associated with the devel-
opment of a new CVD event in adjusted models.132
A retrospective cohort study using administrative 
data showed that among those who had a polysomno-
gram for suspected SDB, the number of periodic leg 
movements per hour (13.4 vs 0) was associated with 
composite CVD events but not with MI or stroke.133 For 
CHD, an association was identified for a periodic limb 
movement index ≥30 in an unadjusted model (HR=1.38; 
95% CI, 1.07–1.79) but not when adjusted for confound-
ers (HR=1.26; 95% CI, 0.97–1.65). For cerebrovascu-
lar events, no association was found in unadjusted or 
adjusted analyses, although there were few events and 
thus limited power.134 In addition, despite an association 
between periodic limb movement index and prevalent hy-
pertension, an association was not found with incident 
hypertension among community-dwelling elderly men.134
Preliminary data suggest that sleep extension may 
have the potential to improve cardiovascular risk fac-
tors.135 In a small pilot study, 22 subjects with prehyper-
tension or stage 1 hypertension and sleep durations of 
≤7 hours were randomized to sleep extension or main-
tenance groups, with a goal of increasing sleep duration 
by 1 hour over 6 weeks. Although there was a reduc-
tion in blood pressure in both groups, it was greater in 
the group randomized to sleep extension (although the 
difference between groups was not statistically signifi-
cant). Larger studies will be necessary to evaluate this 
approach more rigorously. Similarly, small studies sug-
gest that there may be an effect of treating insomnia 
by behavioral interventions in reducing the levels of the 
inflammatory marker C-reactive protein.136 Again, larger, 
more rigorous trials with cardiovascular end points will 
be necessary to make these findings clinically relevant.

agement or resolution of SDB (measured by change in 
AHI).137–140 In 1 trial, researchers found that a 20-kg (95% 
CI, 18–21) weight loss achieved by a very-low-calorie 
diet resulted in a significant reduction in AHI at 9 weeks 
(−25±17 events/h) compared with usual diet controls 
(−2±11 events/h).139 In a prospective observational 
follow-up of the same trial participants during a weight 
maintenance period, significant improvements in AHI 
were maintained at 52 weeks (−17 events/hour; 95% 
CI, −13 to −21 events/h) compared with baseline.139 
Ten percent of those in the intervention group achieved 
complete resolution of OSA at 12 months, with 48% no 
longer requiring continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP). Furthermore, individuals with severe OSA (AHI 
>30 events/h) achieved greater reductions in AHI after 
weight loss (−38 events/h) compared with those with 
moderate OSA (−12 events/h).139 Results of another 
trial (ancillary to the LookAhead trial) found that intensive 
lifestyle intervention produced a significantly greater re-
duction in AHI (−9.7±2, −8±2, and −7.7 ± 2.3 events/ 
h at 12, 24, and 48 months, respectively), with com-
plete resolution of OSA being 5 times more likely in the 
intervention group compared with the control group.137 
In another trial, individuals with mild OSA (AHI=5–15 
events/h) received 12 weeks of a very-low-calorie diet 
plus lifestyle counseling (n=26) or lifestyle counseling 
alone (n=26).140 Although these researchers found a 
5.4-kg/m2 difference in body mass index between the 
intervention and control groups at follow-up, no signifi-
cant difference was shown in AHI or associated nasal 
resistance. Notably, these authors did not report attri-
tion rates or whether intent-to-treat analyses were per-
formed, which limits the interpretation of these findings. 
Lastly, in a comparative-effectiveness trial, obese adults 
with moderate OSA (AHI=17±21 events/h) randomized 
to lifestyle intervention or roux-en-y gastric bypass sur-
gery lost 8% and 30 % of baseline weight respectively, 
at 12 months. Significant reductions in AHI were also 
observed, with larger reductions achieved after roux-en-
y gastric bypass.138 However, baseline body mass index 
was lower in the surgery group compared with the life-
style group, and only 63% of participants had OSA (AHI 
>5 events/h) at baseline, which limits the conclusions 
that can be drawn.
In a series of observational cohort studies, weight loss 
has also shown promise for the resolution or improvement 
in SDB. Behavioral weight loss interventions141 supple-
mented with subutramine142 have resulted in significant re-
ductions in both weight and AHI after 12 weeks141 and 24 
weeks142 of intervention. In contrast, a 16-week intensive 
lifestyle intervention supplemented with low-calorie meal 
replacements did not result in significant improvements 
in AHI for obese adults with moderate OSA (AHI=24±12 
events/h).143 In the population of obese adults with OSA 
who have undergone bariatric surgery, researchers have 
evaluated the effects of a variety of procedures, includ-
ing the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, roux-en-y 
gastric bypass, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, or intragas-
tric balloon. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band has 
resulted in the resolution of OSA in 60%144 and 83%145 of 
cases, with others reporting 100% of cases discontinu-
ing the use of CPAP146 and others reporting clinically sig-
nificant improvements in AHI.147–150 Roux-en-y gastric by-
pass has resulted in the resolution of OSA in 75%151 and 
92%145 of cases, with significant improvements in AHI 
similarly being achieved.145,149,151–154 Vertical sleeve gas-
trectomy has resulted in the resolution of OSA in 92%,145 
76%,155 and 52%156 of cases, with others reporting clini-
cally significant improvements in AHI.148,149 Lastly, in a co-
hort of men who received the intragastric balloon, a sig-
nificant improvement in AHI was reported: 52 events/h at 
baseline versus 12 events/h after 6 months.157 Although 
several of these studies have reported improvements in 
SDB after weight loss, some did not report the observed 
changes in AHI.144–146,148,150,151,156,158
Together, this emerging body of literature suggests 
that weight loss achieved through behavioral or surgi-
cal interventions may be effective for improving and in 
some cases resolving SDB. The findings from behav-
ioral interventions are supported by 2 recent meta-
analyses.159,160 This finding may be particularly true for 
those with severe OSA. However, well-designed and 
-executed comparative-effectiveness trials are needed 
that will further explore the underlying mechanisms 
between weight loss and SDB and are transparent in 
the reporting of objectively measured SDB outcomes 
(ie, changes from baseline to posttreatment follow-up 
in AHI).
Impact of Treatment of Sleep Disorders on 
Cardiometabolic risk Factors
Although observational studies have found an associa-
tion between the treatment of sleep disorders and an 
improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors, primarily 
hypertension,161–164 the randomized data are still rather 
limited. The HeartBEAT study (Heart Biomarker Evalu-
ation in Apnea Treatment) was a randomized trial of 
318 patients at 4 academic sites that assessed the 
effects of CPAP versus nocturnal supplemental oxygen 
versus usual care on cardiovascular risk factors in pa-
tients who had CVD or multiple cardiac risk factors who 
were found to have OSA.165 Patients in cardiovascular 
practices were screened for sleep apnea with the Ber-
lin questionnaire,166 and those with an AHI of 15 to 50 
events/h were randomized. Patients with severe sleep 
apnea were excluded. The primary end point of 24-hour 
mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was significantly 
reduced in the CPAP group compared with the control 
group (−2.4 mm 
Hg) or the supplemental oxygen group 
(−2.8 mm 
Hg). However, there was no significant reduc-
tion in the supplemental oxygen group compared with

the control group. Of note, the nocturnal systolic blood 
pressure was significantly reduced for each additional 
hour of CPAP use (−0.93 mm 
Hg/h). Furthermore, the 
odds of nondipping nocturnal blood pressure were re-
duced for each additional hour of CPAP use. Interest-
ingly, compared with the control arm, CPAP use was 
associated with a lower adjusted level of C-reactive pro-
tein. There was no difference between CPAP treatment 
and supplemental oxygen groups in C-reactive protein 
levels at 12 weeks.
The results of HeartBEAT show the potential value of 
screening for sleep apnea in patients at elevated car-
diovascular risk, including those whose cardiovascular 
risk factors are otherwise well treated.165 In this setting, 
identification and treatment of OSA with CPAP reduce 
blood pressure by an amount that would be expected to 
translate into a reduction in cardiovascular events in a 
large enough population followed up for sufficient time. 
Additional analyses from HeartBEAT such as an exami-
nation of the impact of treatment on quality-of-life mea-
sures are ongoing.
A meta-analysis of 31 randomized trials comparing 
CPAP with various passive and active controls con-
firmed a significant effect of this treatment on blood 
pressure.167 There was a highly significant net differ-
ence in systolic blood pressure (2.6 mm 
Hg) and in dia-
stolic blood pressure (2.0 mm 
Hg) for CPAP compared 
with the control. In the studies that had 24-hour am-
bulatory blood pressure monitoring data available, the 
difference between treatment arms in systolic blood 
pressure was 2.2 mm 
Hg and in diastolic blood pressure 
was 1.9 mm 
Hg during the daytime period and 3.8 and 
1.8 mm 
Hg, respectively, during the nighttime period. 
A higher AHI appeared to be associated with a greater 
decrease in systolic blood pressure. The results of this 
meta-analysis support that CPAP has a significant, albeit 
modest, effect on blood pressure.
Although most (but not all) studies and the above 
meta-analysis support a modest effect of CPAP on 
blood pressure, the effect on biomarkers associated 
with cardiovascular risk such as C-reactive protein has 
been more variable.165,168–170 A recent randomized trial 
of CPAP versus best supportive care found that CPAP 
was associated with significant reductions in total and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 3 months but 
not at 12 months.171 Such potentially beneficial effects 
on lipid-related parameters have not been consistently 
observed.172 Further randomized study is needed of the 
effects of CPAP on cardiovascular risk factors and risk 
markers, although the most consistent and robust effect 
of CPAP to date appears to be on blood pressure.
racial Disparities
Despite many advances in medicine, significant health 
disparities in the population remain. Many individuals be-
longing to racial/ethnic minority groups, and those who 
are socioeconomically disadvantaged face systematic 
discrepancies in their risk of adverse health outcomes 
and decreased life expectancy.173,174 For example, the 
prevalence of obesity is higher among blacks than non-
Hispanic whites.175,176 In addition, rates of hypertension 
are much higher among blacks177,178 and rates of diabe-
tes mellitus are disproportionately higher among blacks 
and Hispanics/Latinos179 than non-Hispanic whites. 
Race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are important 
risk factors for cardiometabolic disease morbidity and 
mortality. As mentioned, sleep is associated with as-
pects of cardiometabolic disease and may represent an 
important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in these 
domains. It is important to note that in addition to car-
diometabolic health disparities, racial/ethnic minorities 
are more likely to experience sleep duration outside of 7 
to 8 hours, especially an SSD of ≤6 hours,180–185 as well 
as increased prevalence of sleep disturbances,186,187 
and these relationships interact with socioeconomic 
status.184,186,188,189 These relationships are consistent 
with the socio-ecological model of sleep and health, 
which places sleep at the interface of downstream car-
diometabolic effects and upstream social/behavioral 
determinants.188,190,191
There is also emerging evidence that the relations 
between sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk fac-
tors may depend on race/ethnicity. For example, 
data from the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults) showed that 5-year 
blood pressure change was mediated by race/ethnic-
ity differences in sleep duration.21 Additionally, data 
from NHANES showed that the U-shaped relationship 
between sleep duration and C-reactive protein lev-
els was different across race/ethnicity groups, with 
a U-shaped relationship seen in non-Hispanic whites, 
elevations in short sleep seen in blacks, a pseudolin-
ear relationship (lower levels in short sleep and higher 
levels in long sleep) seen in Asians/others, and no re-
lation seen in Hispanics/Latinos.192 Further data from 
NHANES showed that these 4 groups also differed in 
their relationships between habitual sleep duration and 
both subjectively and objectively determined preva-
lence of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
and diabetes mellitus.41 Although the specific reasons 
for these differences are not clear, previous work has 
shown that factors such as exposure to racism193–198 and 
low childhood socioeconomic status,199 as well as other 
factors,188 may play roles.
Taken together, these results indicate that sleep 
may play an important role in health disparities and 
may represent a modifiable risk factor (along with 
diet and physical activity) for cardiometabolic risk in 
general and cardiometabolic health disparities specifi-
cally. Further research is needed to clarify these po-
tential roles.

STATEMENT SUMMAry
Our review of the epidemiological data on the impact of 
sleep duration and disorders on cardiovascular health 
suggests the following:
1. Both short- and long-duration sleep and sleep dis-
orders such as SDB and insomnia are associated 
with adverse cardiometabolic risk profiles and 
outcomes.
2. Sleep restriction has a negative impact on energy 
balance, but it is less clear whether treating sleep 
disorders has a positive impact on obesity risk.
3. Treating those with sleep disorders may provide 
clinical benefits, particularly for blood pressure.
CLINICAL rECoMMENDATIoNS
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep 
Research Society recently released a statement in favor of 
≥7 hours of sleep per night for adults “to promote optimal 
health.”191 Similarly, Healthy People 2020 has released a 
series of sleep health goals, including to “increase the pro-
portion of adults who get sufficient sleep.” To increase the 
clinical awareness of and action on sleep-related issues 
and disorders, the following steps should be considered:
1. The American Heart Association should directly 
address sleep behavior in a public health cam-
paign to promote ideal cardiac health (akin to its 
Simple 7 campaign addressing blood pressure, 
cholesterol, blood sugar, physical activity, diet, 
weight, and smoking cessation).
2. A public health campaign addressing sleep behav-
ior should include explicit guidelines for adequate 
sleep and suggestions for how to include screen-
ing for sleep duration and sleep disorders in rou-
tine clinical care and public health settings.
3. Existing simple assessment tools to screen for 
sleep apnea risk should be better integrated into 
routine clinical care and public health settings.
FUTUrE rESEArCH prIorITIES
The increase in observational and clinical studies exam-
ining the link between sleep duration and disorders and 
cardiometabolic health increases the likelihood that we 
may soon have clearer recommendations and guidelines 
that will influence clinical practice and public health cam-
paigns. In addition, more research is needed, and re-
search priorities include the following:
1. Inclusion of more diverse populations in research 
studies (ie, minorities, women, and overweight and 
obese participants)
2. Longer-term follow-up of participants in observa-
tional and clinical studies
3. Accurate and objective measures of sleep behav-
ior, along with sleep architecture
4. Evaluations of the impact of other sleep disorders, 
notably restless leg syndrome and periodic limb 
movement disorder, on cardiometabolic risk
5. Development and evaluation of simple sleep behav-
ior screening tools that could be used in busy clini-
cal or public health settings
6. Evaluation of brief intervention strategies in busy 
clinical or public health settings
