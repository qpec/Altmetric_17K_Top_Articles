Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition for which there are
currently no effective treatment options to restore function. A major obstacle to the development
of new therapies is our fragmentary understanding of the coordinated pathophysiological
processes triggered by damage to the human spinal cord. Here, we describe a systems biology
approach to integrate decades of small-scale experiments with unbiased, genome-wide gene
expression from the human spinal cord, revealing a gene regulatory network signature of the
pathophysiological response to SCI. Our integrative analyses converge on an evolutionarily
conserved gene subnetwork enriched for genes associated with the response to SCI by small-scale
experiments, and whose expression is upregulated in a severity-dependent manner following injury
and downregulated in functional recovery. We validate the severity-dependent upregulation of this
subnetwork in rodents in primary transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Our analysis provides
systems-level view of the coordinated molecular processes activated in response to SCI.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in impairment of motor, sensory, and autonomic systems, causing pro-
found deregulation of almost every bodily function. The failure of large-scale clinical trials of drug
therapies in acute SCI (Bracken et al., 1990; Geisler et al., 2001), and the lack of success in translat-
ing preclinical therapies to humans (Ramer et al., 2014), leaves clinicians without effective treatment
options for SCI. As such, hemodynamic management and surgical decompression remain the only
options to influence neurological outcomes immediately following acute SCI, typically with only mar-
ginal improvements (Hawryluk et al., 2015; Tee et al., 2017; Fehlings et al., 2012). The absence of
an effective treatment for SCI reflects the complexity of the pathophysiologic mechanisms activated
by central nervous system (CNS) injury. The additive effects of the immune response (Kigerl et al.,
2009; Demjen et al., 2004), multiple forms of cell death (Springer et al., 1999; Crowe et al.,
1997), neuronal growth suppression (GrandPre
´ et al., 2000; Schnell and Schwab, 1990), and the

 formation of an inhibitory glial scar (Bradbury et al., 2002) pose a challenge to the development of
new therapeutic strategies.
A major obstacle to the development of targeted therapies for SCI is the fragmentary state of
our understanding of SCI pathophysiology. The response to trauma within the human spinal cord is
mediated by multiple coordinated molecular pathways, yet these processes are rarely studied in an
integrated manner. An additional challenge in translation of novel therapies is the reliance of clinical
trials
on
standardized
neurological
assessments
for
patient
enrolment
and
stratification
(Fawcett et al., 2007). These measures are highly variable, operator-dependent, and may be impos-
sible to perform in many SCI patients (Kwon et al., 2017). Systems biology approaches provide
powerful means to elucidate the coordinated molecular processes underlying the pathophysiology
of complex diseases (Voineagu et al., 2011; Parikshak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013;
Johnson et al., 2016). In particular, gene coexpression network analysis can complement reduction-
ist descriptions of isolated gene functions by identifying networks of genes responsible for driving
disease processes (Zhang and Horvath, 2005; Parikshak et al., 2015). Systems-level analyses may
additionally have the potential to suggest novel biomarkers capable of stratifying injury severity and
predicting functional recovery, and consequently to facilitate the translation of new therapies for
acute SCI.
In the present study, we describe an integrated systems biology approach to study the patho-
physiology of SCI. We systematically survey decades of biomedical literature in order to establish
the complete set of genes implicated in the response to SCI by small-scale experiments. We then
integrate this literature-curated gene set with unbiased gene expression data from the human spinal
cord. We use weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to establish the normal bio-
logical processes within the healthy human spinal cord, and conduct a meta-analysis of publicly avail-
able gene expression data to define the gene regulatory network signature of the coordinated
physiological response to SCI. We validate our findings at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels,
and leverage the resulting systems-level understanding of SCI pathophysiology to define candidate
biomarkers for stratification of injury severity and prediction of functional recovery.
Results
Systematic literature analysis identifies genes associated with response
to SCI
Despite decades of study, an integrated understanding of the pathophysiological response to SCI
remains elusive. This gap represents a central challenge to the development of targeted therapies
for SCI. We hypothesized that such an integrated understanding could be achieved by integrating
the vast corpus of SCI literature, collected by small-scale experimentation over several decades,
within an unbiased, genome-wide framework. An overview of our experimental design is shown in
Figure 1.
As a first step, we sought to systematically establish the complete set of genes implicated in the
physiological response to SCI. We conducted a systematic analysis of the SCI literature, reviewing
over 500 papers, in order to reveal a set of 695 unique human genes associated with the response
to SCI by small-scale experiments (Supplementary file 1). Of these genes, 559 were upregulated
following SCI, 213 were downregulated, and the protein products of 8 were differentially phosphory-
lated. Among all genes, 151 were associated with the response to SCI by more than one study
(Figure 2A). The complete set includes genes that have been associated with SCI in a wide range of
experimental models of SCI, in addition to human injuries (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A); in
multiple species, including human as well as rat, mouse, and rabbit (Figure 2—figure supplement
1B); using a range of experimental techniques (Figure 2B); and at a variety of time points, from 1 hr
to 6 months post-injury (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C).
Validation of literature-curated SCI genes
We validated the biological relevance of our literature-curated (LC) SCI gene set using multiple lines
of evidence. First, we established that LC genes were more likely to share common biological func-
tions than random sets of genes, using annotations from the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al.,
2000). Because functional annotations may be specific or broad, we confirmed that the enrichment

 held regardless of the number of genes to which each term was annotated (Figure 2C). Next, we
investigated the tendency for the protein products of LC genes to physically interact. Significant
enrichment for protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between LC genes was observed relative to ran-
dom expectation (Figure 2D, empirical p < 10�3), and we reproduced this finding in multiple inde-
pendent PPI databases (all p < 10�3, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C). Genes implicated in a
variety of complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been found to form
distinct modules of densely interacting proteins within the human interactome (Ghiassian et al.,
2015). We therefore evaluated whether this same principle held for SCI by calculating the size of the
largest connected component (LCC) between LC genes, and found that LC genes collectively
formed a significantly larger subnetwork than random expectation (Figure 2E, empirical p < 10�3), a
finding that was again reproduced in independent interaction datasets (p < 10�3, Figure 2—figure
supplement 2D–F). Literature-curated genes also displayed a significant tendency to participate in
the same protein complexes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2J). Finally, LC genes were preferentially
recovered by a disease gene prediction algorithm when a subset of them were randomly withheld,

Figure 1. Schematic overview of systems biology approach to SCI pathophysiology integrating small-scale
experiments with high-throughput data. Systematic analysis of over 500 manuscripts revealed the complete set of
genes implicated in SCI pathophysiology by small-scale experiments. SCI genes were integrated with unbiased,
genome-wide gene expression data from healthy human spinal cord to identify coexpressed gene subnetworks
enriched for known SCI genes. Meta-analysis of SCI gene expression data revealed consensus patterns of
subnetwork differential expression after SCI. The resulting consensus network signature of the response to SCI in
human spinal cord was subjected to functional enrichment and cell type analyses, validated at the transcriptomic
and proteomic levels, and leveraged to nominate quantitative biomarkers of SCI severity.

 and the remainder used to prioritize additional disease genes (Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 2G–I). Thus, LC genes represent a biologically relevant and functionally coherent set of
genes, which converge on a common protein interaction module within the human interactome.
Gene coexpression network analysis of human spinal cord
Multiple lines of evidence support the functional coherence of the set of genes implicated in SCI by
small-scale experiments. However, these studies nonetheless have appreciable false positive and
false negative rates, and are limited by sociological and experimental biases. We therefore sought
to integrate knowledge from the SCI corpus within an unbiased, genome-wide framework. We
hypothesized that unsupervised gene coexpression network analysis of human spinal cord would
provide a powerful method to integrate these LC genes in a systems-level context, as this method
has recently been powerfully applied to develop insights into the etiologies of a number of neuro-
logical (Langfelder et al., 2016; Delahaye-Duriez et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,
2013) or psychiatric diseases (Voineagu et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Fromer et al., 2016).

 (GTEx Consortium, 2013). We applied WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) to group the

spinal
cord
transcriptome
into
15
distinct
modules
of
coexpressed
genes
(Supplementary file 2). These modules represent networks of genes that share highly related pat-
terns of expression in the human spinal cord. In order to establish the reproducibility of these spinal
cord gene expression modules in an independent dataset, we constructed a second human spinal
cord gene coexpression network from public microarray data, using established techniques to con-
trol for batch effects (Leek et al., 2012; Vandenbon et al., 2016). Module conservation was quanti-
fied using the Zsummary statistic (Langfelder et al., 2011). Despite the small sample size of our
microarray-based human spinal cord coexpression network (n = 33), seven of 15 modules showed
strong evidence of reproducibility (Zsummary > 10), with an additional two modules showing moderate
evidence of reproducibility (Zsummary > 5) (Figure 3A). Only two of 15 modules showed no evidence
of reproducibility (Zsummary < 2).
Next, we investigated the evolutionary conservation of human spinal cord coexpression modules
in mouse and rat, two of the most commonly used model organisms for studies of SCI pathophysiol-
ogy. We compiled hundreds of microarray samples from mouse (n = 414) and rat (n = 267) spinal
cords from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and constructed gene coexpression networks for the
mouse and rat spinal cords, again using established batch effect correction methods. Five modules
showed strong evidence of evolutionary conservation (Zsummary > 10) in both species, while another
four modules showed moderate evidence of conservation (Zsummary > 5) in at least one species, and

 only two modules showed no evidence of conservation in either species (Zsummary < 2) (Figure 3A).
Notably, the same five modules that showed the strongest evidence of reproducibility (M2, M3, M7,
M8, and M12) also showed the strongest evidence of conservation in rat and mouse. Thus, at least
at the systems level, the architecture of the spinal cord transcriptome is substantially conserved
between human and model organisms, supporting our approach of integrating data from small-scale
studies of mammalian model organisms.
In order to integrate the LC gene set with the spinal cord coexpression network, we next tested
for enrichment of LC genes within each module (Figure 3B). Two modules, M3 and M7, were signifi-
cantly enriched for LC genes (Fisher’s exact test, Bonferroni-corrected p = 9.5 � 10�8 and 2.7 �
10�3, respectively). These modules consist of 746 and 330 genes, respectively, and both are among
the most reproducible and conserved in the spinal cord (Figure 3A). We confirmed the robustness
of the observed enrichment by randomly removing seed genes from the LC set, and by randomly
adding false positive genes to the LC set. Both M3 and M7 remained significantly enriched for LC
genes despite the removal of a large number of seed genes, or the addition of a large number of
random genes (Figure 3C): M3 remained significantly enriched for LC genes even after the removal
of approximately 70% of genes from the seed set, compared to approximately 50% for M7. More-
over, M3 remained significantly enriched for seed genes even after the size of the literature-curated
set was doubled by addition of random false positives. We also asked whether the observed enrich-
ment was driven most strongly by any individual analytical technique or injury model, but found the
majority of experimental methods, SCI models, and species contributed to the observed LC gene
enrichment in M3 and M7 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Thus, M3 and M7 are robustly enriched
for genes associated to the SCI response by small-scale studies, despite their divergent experimental
designs.
Finally, to assess the relationships between modules, we constructed a module meta-network
based on the eigengene of each module, defined as the first principal component of module expres-
sion (Langfelder and Horvath, 2007) (Figure 3D). In the resulting network, M3 and M7 clustered
together, as would be expected given the strong correlation between their eigengenes (Spearman’s
� = 0.54, p = 1.6 � 10�6). These results suggest that the expression of these two modules in the spi-
nal cord is highly correlated.
In summary, gene coexpression network analysis identified five highly conserved and reproduc-
ible modules, two of which are significantly and robustly enriched for LC genes, and whose expres-
sion is highly correlated.
Meta-analysis of coexpression network deregulation in SCI
We next characterized the role of M3 and M7, as well as other highly conserved coexpression mod-
ules, in the pathophysiological response to SCI. We performed a meta-analysis of five mouse and rat
transcriptomic studies of SCI within the context of our spinal cord coexpression network, in order to
identify consensus changes in the spinal cord transcriptome at the module level in response to SCI
(Figure 3E). This analysis identified M3, M6, M7, and M11 as consensus upregulated, and M1 and
M2 as consensus downregulated, following SCI. One other module, M8, was upregulated following
SCI in four of five datasets, while the remaining eight modules did not show robust evidence of dif-
ferential expression. Among all seven modules, M2, M3, and M7 consistently showed the strongest
evidence of differential expression (Figure 3F, p � 6.5 � 10�36, 1.2 � 10�48, and 1.6 � 10�14,
respectively). Notably, among these modules, M2, M3, M7 were strongly conserved and reproduc-
ible in mouse, rat, and human networks (Zsummary > 10), whereas M1, M6, and M11 displayed only
moderate evidence of conservation (2 < Zsummary < 10), suggesting these modules may capture
human-specific aspects of spinal cord transcriptome organization that are relevant in the response to
SCI.
Because the pathophysiological processes underlying primary and secondary injury in SCI are
incompletely understood, we additionally investigated the expression of spinal cord modules at
acute, subacute, and chronic time points. Consensus module expression was remarkably consistent
at all time points studied (Figure 3G). However, analysis of the temporal regulation of spinal cord
modules revealed consensus downregulation of M9 at the most acute time point after SCI, but con-
sensus upregulation at a chronic time point. These results suggest M9 may be specifically involved in
the transition between acute and chronic physiological responses following SCI. Thus, by integrating

 gene coexpression network analysis with a meta-analysis of the SCI transcriptome, we reveal a con-
sensus network signature associated with the response to SCI, and a network module specifically
implicated in the transition from acute to chronic injury processes.
Functional characterization of consensus signature modules
We sought to characterize the biological significance of the modules implicated in the physiological
response to SCI by integrating functional annotations from the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al.,
2000) and molecular signatures from MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2011) (Supplementary file 3). To
visualize statistically overrepresented gene sets, we constructed enrichment maps for each consen-
sus signature module (Merico et al., 2010) (Figure 4A–B and Figure 4—figure supplements 1–
4). To appreciate the cell type-specificity of each module, we additionally conducted a meta-analysis
of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles from the major cell types of the CNS, incorporating both
bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets (Zhang et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2015; Cahoy et al., 2008;
Zeisel et al., 2018) (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 5). M1 was an oligodendrocyte
module, associated with axon ensheathment and myelination, whereas M2 was a neuronal module
implicated in synaptic transmission. M3 was enriched for markers of microglia and vascular endothe-
lial cells, and biological processes such as inflammatory response and response to wounding, while
M7 was a microglial module enriched for annotations related to the immune response. M9 was
enriched for astrocyte markers and terms such as oxidation-reduction process, as well as the term
central nervous system development, which may be related to its upregulation at chronic time points
following SCI. M6 and M11 were not significantly associated with any specific cell type, and were
enriched for terms including cellular protein modification process and mitochondrial translation,
respectively.
Network analysis of SCI severity and recovery
The finding that M3 is a highly conserved and reproducible gene coexpression module, with the
most significant enrichment for LC genes and strong evidence of upregulation following SCI, sug-
gested that this module plays a key pathophysiological role in SCI. We focused on the role of M3 in
SCI by investigating the relationship between M3 expression and two key clinical parameters in SCI:
injury severity and recovery of sensory and motor function.
We first re-analysed gene expression data from a mouse model of severity-dependent injury to
identify relationships between consensus module expression and injury severity (Di Giovanni et al.,
2003; De Biase et al., 2005). Strikingly, M3 was the sole module enriched for genes positively corre-
lated to injury severity, whereas M1, M2, and M9 were enriched for genes anti-correlated to injury
severity (Figure 5A). We investigated this effect further by considering the correlations between
module eigengenes, which provide a summary of the expression profile of each module, and injury
severity. This analysis revealed that the M3 eigengene was the most strongly correlated with injury
severity (Spearman’s � = 0.79, p = 2.5 � 10�7), with a clear separation in M3 expression between
the mild, severe, and sham injury groups at 7 days post-injury (Figure 5E).
In order to validate the severity-dependent upregulation of M3 following SCI, we conducted a
prospective experimental SCI study, using the field standard contusion injury model at the T10 seg-
ment, and performed RNA sequencing of the spinal cord parenchyma in rats subjected to moderate,
severe, or sham injuries (n = 5 per group). Our RNA-seq data reproduced the consensus network
signature derived from our meta-analysis of microarray datasets, emphasizing the robustness of this
systems-level characterization of SCI pathophysiology (Figure 5F). In addition, we confirmed the sig-
nificant association between injury severity and the M3 eigengene (Figure 5E; Spearman’s � = 0.94,
p = 4.2 � 10�7). Thus, insights into the network-level organization of the transcriptome in SCI
derived from a meta-analysis of publicly available data replicate in an independently collected
dataset.
Together, these results emphasized the severity-dependent upregulation of M3 following SCI,
and suggested that the expression of a gene or combination of genes that accurately summarize the
transcriptional status of M3 has the potential to serve as an objective biomarker of SCI severity. To
evaluate the potential of such an indicator as a biomarker of injury severity, we focused on the hub
genes of M3. These genes are the most central and interconnected within the module, based on
their correlation to the module eigengene, and are highly enriched for functionally relevant genes

 such as drivers of disease pathophysiology (Voineagu et al., 2011) or therapeutic targets
(Horvath et al., 2006). Consistent with these findings, the hubness of M3 genes (that is, their corre-
lation to the M3 eigengene in human spinal cord) was significantly associated with their predictive
power as a biomarker of injury severity (Figure 5D; Spearman’s � = 0.23, p = 3.9 � 10�7). Among
M3 hubs, six genes stratified rats by SCI severity with an accuracy greater than 90%, including
Anxa1, Colgalt1, Ifngr2, Shc1, Sod2, and Tbc1d2b (Figure 5G). Remarkably, expression levels of
Anxa1 (annexin A1) stratified moderately and severely injured rats with perfect accuracy (Figure 5I).
Annexin A1 has previously been associated with SCI by three small-scale studies, each employing
divergent model organisms, spinal cord levels, and injury models, emphasizing the robustness of the
association between SCI and annexin upregulation (Didangelos et al., 2016; Moghieb et al., 2016;
Gao et al., 2012).
While our integrative analyses of public and newly acquired transcriptomic data established a
strong relationship between M3 expression and SCI severity, post-transcriptional regulation can
result in marked differences between gene and protein expression levels, particularly in complex tis-
sues such as those of the CNS (Sharma et al., 2015; Fortelny et al., 2017). To further explore the
potential of M3 hubs as biomarkers of SCI severity, we therefore performed quantitative proteomic
profiling of the same rat spinal cords. We first sought to establish that the overall structure of the
spinal cord coexpression network was conserved between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels.
Despite having limited power to detect module preservation due to the small size of our proteomic
sample (n = 15), both M3 and M7 displayed highly significant evidence of reproducibility between
the RNA and protein levels (Figure 5C; Zsummary = 6.8 and 7.3, respectively). Furthermore, we identi-
fied substantial overall agreement between proteomic data and the consensus network signature
derived from transcriptomic meta-analysis, further validating the robustness of our systems-level por-
trait of SCI pathophysiology (Figure 5F). Finally, we confirmed the severity-dependent upregulation
of both the M3 eigengene and annexin A1 in particular (Figure 5H and J), finding that ANXA1 pro-
tein levels stratified both moderate and severe injuries with an accuracy of 93%. Thus, systems-level
insights into SCI pathophysiology derived from integrative transcriptomic analyses extend to the
proteomic level and nominate quantitative biomarkers of SCI severity.
Given the strong relationship between injury severity and M3 expression, we hypothesized that
targeting the transcriptional profile of this module could represent a viable strategy for development
of novel therapies for SCI. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed gene expression data from a
recent trial of a neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which promoted sensory and motor
recovery after SCI (Duan et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015). Remarkably, all six consensus modules
derived from our meta-analysis, including M3, were differentially expressed at the lesion site in the
opposite direction (Figure 5F) in rats treated with NT-3. Intriguingly, the sole other differentially
expressed module was M9, which we previously observed to exhibit a strongly time-dependent
expression profile, and which was enriched for genes associated with neurogenesis. In rats treated
with NT-3, known for its role in neuronal differentiation, axonal growth, and chemotropic guidance
(Alto et al., 2009; Anderson et al., 2016), M9 was strongly upregulated at the lesion site relative to
the experimental control (p = 9.3 � 10�12). Moreover, the M3 eigengene was significantly downre-
gulated in NT-3-treated rats relative to controls (Figure 5K; one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
p = 2.1 � 10�3). We additionally analysed gene expression data from transgenic STAT3 knockout
mice (Anderson et al., 2016), a loss-of-function manipulation that increased axonal dieback follow-
ing experimental SCI, and found all six consensus modules were again differentially expressed in the
opposite direction in wild-type mice, relative to knockout mice (Figure 5B). These results indicate
that reversal of the transcriptome changes observed in response to SCI is associated with functional
recovery and decreased axonal dieback in rodent models, and highlight M3 expression as a predic-
tor of functional recovery.

 Discussion
The fragmentary understanding of the coordinated pathophysiological processes activated in the
human spinal cord by SCI represents a central obstacle to the development of therapies capable of
influencing neurological outcomes. In this study, we developed an integrated, systems-level
approach to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI pathophysiology. We leveraged
large-scale RNA-seq data from healthy subjects to reveal gene regulatory relationships in the human
spinal cord. By integrating multiple gene expression datasets from experimental models of SCI, we
identified gene subnetworks implicated by consensus in the pathophysiological response to SCI, and
reproduced these signatures at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels in an animal trial. The
observation that seven different gene modules were robustly associated with the response to SCI,
either by consensus differential regulation (M1, M2, M3, M7, M11) or by a strongly time-dependent
course of expression (M9), is consistent with the notion that the pathophysiology of SCI is highly
complex (Ramer et al., 2014). Our results provide a framework to understand the diverse, coordi-
nated processes in the spinal cord following SCI.
In order to prioritize gene subnetworks, we conducted a systematic analysis of the SCI literature,
and integrated genes implicated in the SCI response by small-scale experiments into our network
analysis. This approach is conceptually similar to the integration of GWAS or de novo mutation data
into gene regulatory networks, as has previously been described for a number of diseases (e.g.,
Johnson et al., 2015; Delahaye-Duriez et al., 2016; Calabrese et al., 2017; Li et al., 2014;
International Consortium for Blood Pressure GWAS (ICBP) et al., 2015). In the context of genetic
analyses, the core assumption is that false positive and false negative associations between alleles
and the phenotype of interest can be mitigated by identifying convergent molecular processes that
mediate disease biology. In the context of literature curation, as employed here, we posit that the
relatively high false-positive rates of small-scale experiments, as well as their appreciable false-nega-
tive rates, can be mitigated by unbiased integration of data from small-scale experiments into a
genome-wide framework. Importantly, this experimental design provides an approach to extend
gene coexpression network analysis to acquired and traumatic conditions, using samples from
healthy tissues. However, a limitation of this approach is the implicit assumption that the molecular
organization of the transcriptome in the relevant tissue of healthy human subjects is informative
about the biological processes dysregulated by an acquired or traumatic condition. Although the
analyses presented here indicate that this assumption appears to be valid in the case of SCI, future
work will be needed to establish whether this principle holds in general.
A major challenge to the translation of preclinical therapies for acute SCI is the use of standard-
ized neurological assessments to enrol and stratify patients in large clinical trials (Fawcett et al.,
2007). In this context, objective biomarkers capable of accurately stratifying injury severity have the
potential to facilitate translation by accelerating the pace of patient enrolment (Kwon et al., 2017;
Streijger et al., 2017). We found that M3 was the sole module enriched for genes whose expression
correlated with injury severity in a mouse model, and that its eigengene was likewise most strongly
associated with severity. We subsequently reproduced this correlation in our own transcriptomic and
proteomic datasets. The severity-dependent upregulation of M3 following SCI, and its preservation
at the proteomic level, suggests that its expression has the potential to stratify injury severity in a
clinical context. Furthermore, this expression pattern was reversed with administration of NT-3, a
treatment that promotes motor and sensory recovery (Yang et al., 2015). These findings have sev-
eral implications for the discovery and translation of new SCI therapies. The identification of drugs
that reverse transcriptional changes associated with SCI has the potential to provide a new strategy
for preclinical lead discovery. Moreover, analysing the effect of a desired treatment on M3 expres-
sion, or our consensus network signature more generally, may represent an effective technique to
validate the efficacy of preclinical therapies.
Among M3 hub genes, which reflect the expression of the entire module, we found that both the
RNA and protein levels of Anxa1 (annexin A1) demonstrated a strong ability to discriminate between
injuries of different severities. Annexin A1 is a member of the annexin superfamily of calcium depen-
dent phospholipid-binding proteins, and plays a role in mediating anti-inflammatory effects through
inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity (Elderfield et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2007), decreasing leuko-
cyte activation (Perretti and Flower, 1993; D’Acquisto et al., 2007) and reducing expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Sudlow et al., 1996; McArthur et al., 2010). Anxa1 is primarily

(McArthur et al., 2010). Correspondingly, Anxa1 knockout mice are characterized by exaggerated
inflammatory responses, as well as a blunted response to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorti-
coids (Hannon et al., 2003). Anxa1 is upregulated in multiple diseases characterized by aberrant
neuroinflammation (Elderfield et al., 1992; Elderfield et al., 1993; McArthur et al., 2010). Impor-
tantly, multiple studies have previously reported upregulation of Anxa1 in SCI (Didangelos et al.,
2016; Moghieb et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2012), with peak expression at 7 days post injury
(Liu et al., 2004), and upregulation of Anxa1 is associated with functional recovery after SCI
(Liu et al., 2007). Notably, Anxa1 was previously identified as a biomarker of SCI severity in a study
that included both rat and human samples (Moghieb et al., 2016). Our independent finding here
that Anxa1 is a strong candidate for a severity-dependent biomarker of SCI suggests that our sys-
tems-level approach can drive rational selection of novel potential biomarkers. However, although
we observed substantial conservation of M3 between human and rat at the systems level, this finding
does not preclude the possibility that individual genes diverge in their expression following acute
SCI between human and rodents. Further studies in humans are therefore needed to conclusively
establish the validity of Anxa1 as a biomarker of SCI severity.
In summary, our systems biology approach identifies evolutionarily conserved and reproducible
gene subnetworks with robust evidence for differential regulation following SCI, and provides a
genome-wide view of the pathophysiological processes triggered by SCI. Our findings provide new,
data-driven strategies to identify and translate novel therapies for SCI.
Materials and methods
Systematic analysis of SCI literature
We searched PubMed for articles investigating the molecular pathophysiology of SCI published prior
to February 2016, using combinations of ‘spinal cord injury’ and one of ‘proteomics,’ ‘proteome,’
‘proteomic,’ ‘biomarkers,’ ‘biomarker,’ ‘RNA-seq,’ and ‘microarray’ as search terms. 556 papers
were identified that met these criteria. These were subsequently filtered to exclude papers that did
not include a valid control group, included exclusively in vitro data, did not include primary data, or
examined a tissue other than spinal cord. As previous studies have suggested that small-scale and
high-throughput experiments may be largely complementary, or lead to divergent biological conclu-
sions, we considered only small-scale experiments in the literature curation process, defined here as
experiments reporting differential regulation of fewer than 100 genes or proteins. Ultimately, data
from 67 manuscripts was collected. The original accessions used to identify genes or proteins
associated with SCI in each publication were retained. If only the gene name and no unambiguous
identifier was noted, the UniProt accession of the gene in the relevant species was manually
retrieved. We applied a strict, majority voting-based method to map rat, mouse, and rabbit genes
to their human orthologs with maximum accuracy (Li et al., 2017). Specifically, we mapped ortho-
logs from rat, mouse, and rabbit genes to human using seven different ortholog databases [Egg-
NOG (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016), Ensembl (Kinsella et al., 2011), NCBI Gene (Brown et al.,
2015), HomoloGene (Agarwala et al., 2018), InParanoid (Sonnhammer and O
¨ stlund, 2015), and
OrthoDB (Zdobnov et al., 2017)], and considered human genes as ‘consensus orthologs’ only if
they were detected in at least half of those databases containing an entry for the target model
organism protein. All genes were mapped to Ensembl identifiers in Bioconductor (Huber et al.,
2015).
Validation of literature-curated SCI genes
We established the functional coherence and biological relevance of our LC SCI gene set using four
lines of evidence: protein-protein interactions (PPIs), interactome largest connected components
(LCCs), shared Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and recovery with DIAMOnD (Ghiassian et al., 2015), a
disease gene prediction algorithm. To investigate the tendency of our LC gene set to participate in
PPIs, we initially analysed a recently described high-quality human interactome (Menche et al.,
2015). We subsequently reproduced our results in two additional human interactome databases
restricted to binary and co-complex interactions, obtained from HINT (version 4) (Das and Yu,
2012), and a fourth human interactome, obtained from InBioMap (Li et al., 2017), in order to

 establish that the enrichment for protein-protein interactions was not a function of the experimental
technique used to detect the interaction. Self-interactions were removed and original accessions
were mapped to Ensembl gene identifiers. To evaluate the impact of the experimental method used
to detect PPIs, we analysed high-quality binary and co-complex interactomes from HINT separately.
Network operations, including creation of induced subgraphs and calculation of largest connected
components, were performed in the R package igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). Randomized net-
works were generated using a degree-preserving algorithm (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002) to control
for network topology, with 1000 randomized networks generated to calculate empirical P values.
We additionally evaluated the tendency for LC proteins to participate in the same protein complexes
by retrieving random sets of proteins of equivalent size from hu.MAP (Drew et al., 2017) and calcu-
lating the number of co-complex interactions, a process that was repeated 103 times.
GO terms were retrieved from the UniProt-GOA database (Dimmer et al., 2012). We compared
the number of shared GO terms within each ontological category at three breadth cutoffs between
all pairs of LC genes to the number of shared GO terms between random sets of genes.
To evaluate the ability of a recently described algorithm for disease gene prioritization, DIA-
MOnD, we randomly withheld 20% of LC genes and evaluated the fraction recovered within the first
1000 iterations of DIAMOnD. This was compared to the ability of DIAMOnD to recover an equiva-
lent number of randomly selected genes, using randomly selected seed genes from the human
genome. This process was bootstrapped 1000 times and results were reproduced using the InWe-
b_InBioMap interactome (version 2016_09_12) (Li et al., 2017)
Gene coexpression network analysis of human spinal cord
Raw gene read count and RPKM data was downloaded from the GTEx portal, version V6p
(GTEx Consortium, 2013). Only genes with expression estimates > 0.1 RPKM in � 10 individuals
were considered. The distribution of RPKMs in each sample was quantile transformed using the aver-
age empirical distribution observed across all samples, and inverse quantile normalization to the
standard normal distribution was performed for each gene. Gene coexpression analysis was per-
formed using the WGCNA package Langfelder and Horvath, 2008. Briefly, a signed pairwise gene
correlation matrix was constructed using biweight midcorrelation (Langfelder and Horvath, 2012)
and considering a maximum of 5% of samples as outliers on either side of the median. The correla-
tion matrix was raised to the power b = 5, the minimum value satisfying the scale-free topology cri-
terion R2 > 0.8, to create an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix was used to calculate the
topological overlap matrix (TOM), which was subsequently clustered based on the dissimilarity of
gene connectivity. Coexpressed gene modules were defined from the resulting tree using the
dynamic tree cut method (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008), with a minimum module size of 20 and a
cut height of 0.2.
Module preservation in human, rat, and mouse microarray data
We queried Array Express (Kolesnikov et al., 2015) with the search term ‘spinal cord’ to identify
samples from Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0, Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0, and Mouse
Genome 430 2.0 microarrays (Supplementary file 3). Experiments with fewer than five samples were
excluded. Additionally, experiments or samples analysing individual cell populations (e.g., neurons)
within the spinal cord rather than homogenized tissue, fetal spinal cord, or spinal cord neoplasms
were excluded. Raw expression profiles were normalized with the MAS5 algorithm (Hubbell et al.,
2002) within the R package affy (Gautier et al., 2004). Only probe sets that were called as present
in at least 80% of samples were retained. ComBat was used to adjust for batch effects, where each
experiment corresponded to a single batch (Leek et al., 2012). Affymetrix probe set identifiers were
mapped to Ensembl gene accessions using Bioconductor. Genes with multiple probes were repre-
sented by the median expression value. Mouse and rat accessions were further mapped to consen-
sus human orthologs using the majority-voting procedure described above. Module preservation
was assessed using the Zsummary statistic, calculated using the modulePreservation function in the
WGCNA R package with 100 permutations.

 Meta-analysis of coexpression network deregulation following SCI
Data from five studies investigating the transcriptomic response to SCI (GSE464, GSE5296,
GSE45006, GSE45376, and GSE69334) was obtained from Array Express. Normalization and map-
ping to human orthologs was performed as described above. For GSE464, MAS5 normalization was
performed within the R package xps, as the Rat Genome U34 chip was not supported by the affy
package. For GSE45376, quantile normalization of raw expression estimates was performed as
described for GTEx data. Differential expression analyses of each processed dataset were performed
with treatment-contrasts parameterization in the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015), using the
geneSetTest function to perform a mean-rank gene-set enrichment test for both up- and downregu-
lation of each module, before applying Bonferroni correction. We additionally analysed differential
expression of each module at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days following SCI in order to evaluate
module expression at acute, subacute, and chronic time points.
Functional characterization of spinal cord modules
To construct enrichment maps for consensus modules implicated in the response to SCI by meta-
analysis, we identified overrepresented gene sets from GO (Dimmer et al., 2012) and the CGP
(chemical and genetic perturbagens) and TFT (transcription factor targets) subsets of MSigDB
(Liberzon et al., 2011). Genes were mapped to Ensembl accessions prior to enrichment analysis
with the HTSanalyzeR package (Wang et al., 2011), using 1000 permutations and a minimum gene
set size of 5. Significantly enriched gene sets were visualized as an enrichment map (Merico et al.,
2010), in which nodes represent gene sets and edges connect related gene sets. Clusters of gene
sets within the resulting enrichment maps were manually identified and annotated. Cell type specific-
ity was assessed using microarray (Cahoy et al., 2008), RNA-seq (Zhang et al., 2014), and proteo-
mic (Sharma et al., 2015) data from cell populations within the mouse CNS, using the R package
pSI to test for enrichment of cell type-specific genes (Dougherty et al., 2010). We analysed a wide
range of cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (Cahoy et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2014; Sharma et al., 2015), as well as oligodendrocytes at various points in maturation (i.e., ‘oligo-
dendrocyte precursor cell,’ ‘myelinating oligodendrocyte,’ ‘oligodendrocyte;’ [Cahoy et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2014]). We included additional comparisons in microglia from both new-born and
adult mice (i.e., ‘adult microglia,’ ‘young microglia;’ [Sharma et al., 2015]), developing in vitro neu-
rons

Severity-dependent expression of spinal cord modules
Raw microarray data was obtained from Array Express (GSE464) (Kolesnikov et al., 2015; De Biase
et al., 2005) and processed as described above. Injuries annotated as ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’ were
grouped together on the basis of identical histological and functional outcomes in the experimental
model (De Biase et al., 2005). To identify modules enriched for genes whose expression was corre-
lated with injury severity, we calculated a previously described gene-level score (Delahaye-
Duriez et al., 2016) by multiplying the Spearman correlation coefficient between gene expression
and height of weight drop by the negative logarithm of the P value, then performed mean-rank
gene-set enrichment tests and applied Bonferroni correction. Only samples from the lesion site were
considered. Initial analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that all but a single probe set
on the U34A chip were consistently downregulated following injury, likely due to the biased compo-
sition of this chip. Therefore, samples collected using this chip were omitted when calculating corre-
lation between injury severity and module eigengenes to reduce bias. Module eigengenes were
calculated using the moduleEigengenes function from the WGCNA package.
Spinal cord surgery and animal care
Ethical approval was obtained by the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics
Board (A14-0152) and all procedures strictly adhere to the guidelines issues by the Canadian Council
for Animal Care. Animals (n = 15, n = 5 per group) were started on prophylactic enrofloxin (Baytril;
10 mg kg�1, s.c., Associated Veterinary Purchasing (AVP), Langley, Canada) three days prior to sur-
gery. On the day of spinal cord contusion animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (initialinduction

 operative buprenorphine (Temgesic; 0.02 mg kg�1, s.c., McGill University), enrofloxin (Baytril; 10 mg
kg�1, s.c., Associated Veterinary Purchasing (AVP), Langley, Canada), and Ringers solution were
administered subcutaneously. The skin was prepared by shaving the surgical site, followed by three
successive chlorohexidine and 70% ethanol washes. A dorsal midline incision was made from T5 to
L2. The T9 spinous process was identified and a laminectomy was performed to expose the T10 spi-
nal segment. Following this the animal was transferred to the IH impactor stage, where the T8 and
T10 spinous processes were securely clamped using modified Allis forceps. The animal was stabilized
on the platform and the impactor tip (2.0 mm) was properly aligned using a 3-dimensional coordi-
nate system moving platform. The position of the impactor was confirmed as midline by two sepa-
rate experimenters. The IH system was set to deliver an impact of 100 or 200 kdyn of pre-defined
force, based on random assignment. Following hemostasis, the deep and superficial Para spinal
muscles were sutured using 5–0 Monocryl sutures (Ethicon, USA), followed by 5–0 Prolene (Ethicon,
USA) sutures in the skin. Animals were then given 5 mL of Ringers solution subcutaneously and
allowed to recover in a temperature controlled environment (Animal Intensive Care Unit, Los
Angeles, CA, USA). Post-operatively, animals were given buprenorphine (10 mg kg�1, s.c.) and enro-
floxin (0.02 mg kg�1, s.c.) once daily for three days, after which buprenorphine was given on an as
needed basis. Bladders were manually expressed for the duration of the experiment (7 days post-
injury).
Tissue processing
Animals were overdosed with a lethal dose of 10% chlorohydrate (i.p.), after which a thoracotomy
was performed. Animals were transcardially cleared with 300 mL of PBS. Next, the spinal cord lesion
site was dissected 2 mm caudal and rostral to the visual epicentre. This sample was homogenized
and split into two parts for transcriptomic and proteomic processing.
RNA isolation and sequencing
10 mg of spinal cord parenchyma surrounding the injury site was stored in RLT buffer containing
beta-mercaptoethanol until RNA isolation. Total RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, eluting in 30 �L of water. 500 ng RNA was used for
library preparation with Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries
were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq in high output mode, generating paired-end
75-base pair reads. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Sequencing and Bio-
informatics Consortium at the University of British Columbia.
Transcriptome analysis
Quality control checks using FastQC and principal components analysis revealed a single sample as
an outlier, which was discarded prior to further analysis. Sequences were pseudoaligned to the
Ensembl 89 version of the Rattus norvegicus transcriptome, including coding and non-coding tran-
scripts, with Salmon (version 0.8.2) (Patro et al., 2017), using 100 bootstraps to compute abundance
estimates. Rat genes were mapped to human orthologs using the majority-voting procedure
described
above.

a
format
compatible
with
sleuth
(Pimentel et al., 2017) for differential expression analysis using wasabi (https://github.com/COM-
BINE-lab/wasabi). Differential expression was assessed using sleuth (version 0.29.0), representing
severity as a continuous covariate (0, 100, or 200 kdyn of force). Genes were ranked by the fold
change estimates computed by sleuth to perform mean-rank gene-set enrichment tests for module
up- and downregulation. Hub genes were identified by ranking genes by their correlation to the
module eigengene in the human spinal cord samples (Horvath and Dong, 2008), and identifying
the 10% most connected genes in the module. To evaluate the ability of hub gene expression to
stratify SCI severity, we constructed linear discriminant analysis models using the R package MASS
(Kwon et al., 2017). The accuracy of each model in classifying moderately and severely injured rats
was assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation.
Mass spectrometric analysis
Parenchyma tissue samples were lysed by 2.8 mm ceramic bead (Qiagen) prior to homogenization
with a single 20 s 5000 rpm on Precellys 24 (Bertin Technologies) in 4% (w/v) SDS in 100 mM Tris pH

 8.8 and 20 mM DTT. The lysate was heated at 99cC for 10 min, and cell debris was spun out and pro-
tein concentration estimated by BCA assay (Thermo). An equivalent protein amount for each sample
was loaded onto 10% SDS PAGE gel and visualized by colloidal Coomassie (Candiano et al., 2004).
Each lane was fractionated into five pieces and trypsin digested out of the gel (Shevchenko et al.,
1996). Peptide samples were purified by solid phase extraction on C-18 Stop And Go Extraction
(STAGE) Tips (Ishihama et al., 2002), and analysed by a quadrupole–time of flight mass spectrome-
ter (Impact II; Bruker Daltonics) coupled to an Easy nano LC 1000 HPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific)
using an analytical column that was 40–50 cm long, with a 75 �m inner diameter fused silica with an
integrated spray tip pulled with P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments), packed with 1.9 �m diame-
ter Reprosil-Pur C-18-AQ beads (Maisch, http://www.dr-maisch.com), and operated at 50�C with in-
house built column heater. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and buffer B consisted
of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A standard 60 min peptide separation was done per injection,
and the column was washed with 100% buffer B before re-equilibration with buffer A. The Impact II
was set to acquire in a data-dependent auto-MS/MS mode with inactive focus fragmenting the 20
most abundant ions (one at the time at a 18 Hz rate) after each full-range scan from m/z 200 to m/z
2000 at 5 Hz rate. The isolation window for MS/MS was 2–3 depending on the parent ion mass to
charge ratio, and the collision energy ranged from 23 to 65 eV depending on ion mass and charge.
Parent ions were then excluded from MS/MS for the next 0.4 min and reconsidered if their intensity
increased more than five times. Singly charged ions were excluded from fragmentation.
Analysis of mass spectrometry data was performed using MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) ver-
sion 1.5.3.30. The search was performed against a database comprised of the protein sequences
from Uniprot Rattus norvegicus entries plus common contaminants with variable modifications of
methionine oxidation, and N-acetylation of the proteins, and enabling LFQ and match between run
options. Only those peptides exceeding the individually calculated 99% confidence limit (as opposed
to the average limit for the whole experiment) were considered as accurately identified.
Proteomic analysis
Module preservation at the proteomic level was quantified using the modulePreservation function,
using Spearman correlation to calculate coexpression similarity. A mean-rank gene set enrichment
test was used to test for module up- and downregulation, prior to Bonferroni correction. Linear dis-
criminant analysis of annexin A1 was performed as described above.
