 A randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of coenzyme Q10
in Huntington disease
ABSTRACT
Objective: To test the hypothesis that chronic treatment of early-stage Huntington disease (HD)
with high-dose coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) will slow the progressive functional decline of HD.
Methods: We performed a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients
with early-stage HD (n 5 609) were enrolled at 48 sites in the United States, Canada, and
Australia from 2008 to 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either CoQ 2,400 mg/d or
matching placebo, then followed for 60 months. The primary outcome variable was the change
from baseline to month 60 in Total Functional Capacity score (for patients who survived) com-
bined with time to death (for patients who died) analyzed using a joint-rank analysis approach.
Results: An interim analysis for futility revealed a conditional power of ,5% for the primary
analysis, prompting premature conclusion in July 2014. No statistically significant differences
were seen between treatment groups for the primary or secondary outcome measures. CoQ was
generally safe and well-tolerated throughout the study.
Conclusions: These data do not justify use of CoQ as a treatment to slow functional decline in HD.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00608881.
Classification of evidence: This article provides Class I evidence that CoQ does not slow the pro-
gressive functional decline of patients with HD. Neurology® 2017;88:152–159

Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease.1,2 While symptomatic
treatments are available, there is no therapy to delay onset or slow progression.3–5 Substantial
experimental evidence suggests defective energetics in HD pathology.6–16 As such, agents that
improve mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress are rational candidates for study.
This notion is reinforced by observations that several agents that improve mitochondrial

 function ameliorate pathologic features in HD
mouse models.17–20 One such agent, coenzyme
Q10 (CoQ), has demonstrated beneficial
properties in experimental models of amyotro-
phic lateral sclerosis,21 Parkinson disease,22 and
some models of HD.18,23 CoQ plays a central
role in oxidative phosphorylation, appears to
stabilize membranes, acts as an antioxidant,24
and may influence vesicle migration, cell
growth, and signal transmission.25
In the CARE-HD clinical trial, 347 patients
with early HD were randomized to receive CoQ
300 mg twice daily, remacemide hydrochloride
200 mg twice daily, both, or neither for 30
months.26 Those receiving CoQ did not dem-
onstrate a substantial benefit in outcome meas-
ures compared to placebo, but a nonsubstantial
trend towards slowed decline compared to con-
trols over 30 months was observed, as deter-
mined by Total Functional Capacity (TFC)
score (mean decline of 2.40 vs 2.74 points,
p 5 0.15) as well as the Functional Checklist
and Independence Scale scores.27 It was unclear
if these observations represented actual clinical
efficacy. After establishing a maximal tolerable
dose based on preclinical studies,28 we sought to
address these issues by evaluating the effect of
a higher dosage of CoQ in a large group over
a 5-year follow-up period.

Study design and organization. This multicenter random-
ized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
was
conceived and conducted by the Huntington Study Group and
sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke. The trial was designed to test the hypothesis that
chronic treatment of patients with early-stage HD with high-
dosage CoQ (2,400 mg/d) will slow the functional decline of
HD over a follow-up period of 60 months (Level I evidence).
The study is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00608881).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study was approved by the institutional review
boards at 48 participating sites in the United States, Canada,
and Australia. All participants provided written informed con-
sent. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke–appointed independent Data and Safety Monitoring
Board monitored the progress of the trial.
Randomization and enrollment. A total of 609 participants
with early-stage HD were enrolled at 48 sites. Patients were
randomly assigned with equal allocation to CoQ 2,400 mg/d or
matching placebo, administered in twice daily dosage.
Eligibility criteria. Patients were required to meet the following
core criteria within 28 days prior to randomization: (1) clinical
features of HD, with a confirmatory family history of HD or
a CAG repeat expansion $36; (2) TFC $9 at the baseline visit;
(3) ambulatory and not requiring skilled nursing care; (4) age
$16 years; (5) unable to become pregnant or using adequate
birth control methods beginning 60 days prior to the baseline
visit; (6) stable dosages of psychotropic medications. Patients
were excluded due to (1) known sensitivity or intolerability to
CoQ; (2) exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days of
baseline; (3) unstable medical illness; (4) unstable psychiatric
illness within 90 days of baseline; (5) substance abuse (DSM-
IV-R criteria) within 1 year of baseline; (6) pregnancy or breast-
feeding; (7) use of supplemental CoQ within 30 days prior to
baseline; (8) clinically relevant abnormalities in screening labora-
tories; (9) allergy.
Study visits. Study visits consisted of a screening visit, baseline
visit, and follow-up visits at months 1, 3, and 6, and every 6
months thereafter through month 60. Telephone calls were
conducted at month 9 and every 6 months thereafter through
month 57 to monitor concomitant medication use, compliance
with study medication, and adverse events. At the screening
visit, after the patient provided written informed consent,
eligibility criteria were checked, a medical history was taken,
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, weight) were measured, and
blood was drawn for safety laboratory tests (serum chemistry,
hematology, pregnancy test, urinalysis) and for the CoQ level
assay. A baseline visit was scheduled to occur within 28 days of
screening, at which time confirmation of a research proxy with
whom the site investigator could discuss the patient’s wishes
about future study participation in the event of loss of
cognitive capacity was required. A final eligibility check was
performed and a blood sample was obtained for CAG analysis/
genotyping.
At baseline and all follow-up visits, patients were assessed for
capacity to consent (beginning at month 6), concomitant medi-
cation use, TFC (except month 1), modified Rankin Scale29 score
(beginning at month 3), vital signs, and adverse events. The
patient’s dosage log and counts of pills dispensed and returned
were also reviewed to monitor compliance. The Unified
Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)27 was administered
at baseline and annually thereafter. Safety laboratory tests and an
assay for plasma CoQ level were collected at baseline, month 3,
and annual visits. Physical and neurologic examinations were
performed at baseline and at months 36 and 60. Throughout
the study, patients were allowed to stop study drug at any time
(consent withdrawal, intolerance) and continue participation in
scheduled assessments off study drug.
Study intervention. CoQ (2,3-dimethoxy-methylbenzoquinone,
or ubiquinone) and matching placebo were obtained from
Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. (Green Bay, WI). Patients started
taking CoQ as a 300 mg chewable wafer or matching placebo
orally twice daily, followed by a subsequent 4-week titration
towards a maintenance dosage of 2,400 mg/d. This dosage was
selected based on considerations of tolerability and achieved
plasma CoQ levels in a preliminary study.30
Outcome variables. The primary outcome variable was a rank
based on a combination of time to death (for patients who died)
and change in TFC score from baseline to month 60 (for patients
who survived), as explained in the supplementary material.

 Secondary outcome variables were derived from the UHDRS and
are described in detail in the supplementary material.
Sample size determination. A sample size of 609 patients was
planned to provide 90% power to detect a group difference of 1.0
point in the mean 60-month change in TFC score, using a t test
and a 5% significance level (2-tailed), after accounting for 15%
withdrawal over time.
Statistical analysis. The primary analysis was performed using
a joint rank approach31 whereby patients are ranked from worst to
best outcome with patients who die being assigned the worst
ranks (and ranked according to the time of death) and patients
who survive being ranked more favorably in order of the change
from baseline to month 60 in TFC score. This analysis yields an
estimated probability that a randomly selected patient treated
with CoQ has a better outcome than a randomly selected patient
treated with placebo, along with its associated 95% confidence
interval (CI) and p value.
Analyses of secondary outcome variables were performed
using the joint rank approach, repeated-measures analysis of
covariance models, and Cox proportional hazards models de-
pending on the nature of the outcome variable.
All analyses were performed in accordance with the intention-
to-treat principle and included all available data from all random-
ized patients.
RESULTS Baseline characteristics. A total of 668 pa-
tients were screened, with 609 randomized between
March 19, 2008, and June 25, 2012. Demographic
and clinical characteristics at baseline were compara-
ble in the treatment groups (table 1).
Patient disposition. At the time of study termination,
of the 609 enrolled patients, 206 (34%) had com-
pleted the month 60 visit (25% on study drug and
9% off study drug), 258 (42%) were still active in
the trial (34% on study drug and 8% off study drug),
110 (18%) had withdrawn participation in the trial
while alive (12% on study drug and 6% off study
drug at time of withdrawal), and 35 (5.7%) died dur-
ing study participation (3.0% on study drug and
2.8% off study drug). The treatment groups were
comparable with respect to patient disposition. There
were more deaths observed in the CoQ group (n 5
22, 7.3%) than in the placebo group (n 5 13, 4.2%);
this is discussed further below. In addition, 9 patients
(5 in the CoQ group and 4 in the placebo group) died
after having withdrawn participation in the study. At
the time of study termination, 91% of patients had
completed 1 year of follow-up, 83% had completed 2
years, 69% had completed 3 years, 52% had
completed 4 years, and 34% had completed 5 years
(figure 1).
Compliance with study drug. Compliance during the
study was high in the 2 treatment groups (87.1% 6
15.8% for CoQ, 87.0% 6 16.7% for placebo).
Median CoQ levels across visits ranged from 4.4 to
8.0 mg/mL in the CoQ group and from 0.8 to
1.0 mg/mL in the placebo group (figure e-1).
Tolerability and safety. CoQ was generally safe and
well-tolerated. Forty-six dosage reductions occurred
in
29
patients
(11
placebo,
18
CoQ),
most
commonly for gastrointestinal disturbances in both
groups. Thirteen of these patients (5 placebo, 8
CoQ)
were
discontinued
from
their
assigned
treatment for intolerance either by patient or
investigator decision, while the remainder were able
to continue on either a reduced or original dosage.
The most common adverse event categories, in
order from highest to lowest percentage of patients
experiencing at least one event, were psychiatric dis-
turbances, infections, gastrointestinal disturbances,
injury, and nervous system disturbances (table 2).
There were no significant differences between groups
in the frequency of individual adverse events with the

 exception of insomnia, which was less frequent in the
CoQ group (11.6% vs 20.9%, p 5 0.002). No sub-
stantial differences in safety laboratory findings were
observed between groups.
A total of 238 serious adverse events were reported
in 159 patients (27.1% of patients in the placebo
group and 25.1% in the CoQ group). The majority
were believed to be HD-related, and no substantial
group differences were identified. Study personnel
unaware of treatment group assignment categorized
the 35 study deaths as either unrelated or related to
HD, with related consisting of inanition, infection,
accident/trauma, and suicide. Seventeen of the 22
deaths in the CoQ group (77.3%) and 9 of 13 in
the placebo group (69.2%) were deemed HD-
related. The most common non-HD related cause
of death was malignancy (4 patients). There were 22
suicide attempts in the study, with 5 completed. Dif-
ferences between groups regarding suicide attempts
(10 placebo, 12 CoQ) or completions (1 placebo, 4
CoQ) were not statistically significant. No deaths
were believed to be related to study drug.
Primary outcome variable. The results of the joint rank
analyses for the UHDRS functional outcomes,
including TFC score, are shown in table 3. Since
a majority of patients (60%) did not die or complete
60 months of follow-up, a large number of patients
were ranked on the basis of outcomes at visits that
occurred prior to month 60. For this reason, the
analyses were repeated including only patients who
had long follow-up durations ($42 months and 60
months). In the latter analyses, patients who died or
withdrew from the trial were included if they were
enrolled early enough to have been followed for the
specified duration. The results indicate no substantial
group differences with respect to these outcomes. The
results did not change substantially when restricted to

 deaths that were judged (prior to unblinding) to be
HD-related (data not shown).
Secondary outcome variables. Treatment effects on the
secondary outcome variables from the UHDRS are
summarized in table 4. No substantial effects of
CoQ were evident. The CoQ group had a smaller
mean decline in Word reading score at month 60
than the placebo group (treatment effect 5 3.88;
95% CI 0.31–7.44; p 5 0.03), but this was an isolated
finding that may be due to multiple testing. No treat-
ment effects were apparent on the time-to-event
outcomes, including time to a 2-point decline in
TFC score or death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99; 95%
CI 0.81–1.20; p 5 0.88), time to a 3-point decline
in TFC score or death (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.75–1.15;
p 5 0.50), time to a TFC score of 6 or less or death
(HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.75–1.28; p 5 0.89), time to
institutionalization or death (HR 1.65; 95% CI
0.97–2.79; p 5 0.07), and time to death (HR 1.89,
95% CI 0.92–3.89; p 5 0.09). Kaplan-Meier
estimates for cumulative event probabilities for these
events by treatment group at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years are
reported in table e-1.
DISCUSSION In this study, no beneficial effect of
CoQ was detected on the primary outcome variable,
and the trial was concluded early on the basis of an
interim analysis for futility. None of the secondary
outcome variables demonstrated a beneficial effect
of CoQ with the exception of the Word reading score
on the Stroop test, which as a lone finding may be
spurious. As such, the trial provides no evidence that
CoQ slows the progression of functional decline in
HD, and these data do not justify a recommendation
for CoQ as a treatment in HD.
CoQ at 2,400 mg daily demonstrated good toler-
ability, with no serious or unexpected side effects
emerging. Insomnia was less frequently reported in
the CoQ arm, the reason for which is unclear. CoQ
would be expected to exert an effect on a broad pop-
ulation of neuronal networks, given speculation for
a general benefit on bioenergetics; it is not clear
why insomnia, reported subjectively, would improve
without broader suggestion of clinical benefit. Insomnia
was not less common in CARE-HD patients treated
with CoQ.26 There were more deaths in the CoQ
group, though the group difference in the frequency
of death was not statistically significant. It seems
unlikely that CoQ would cause greater mortality in
HD. The frequency of HD-related (vs unrelated to
HD) deaths was similar in the 2 groups, as was the
frequency of suicide attempts. Evidence from our trial
suggests that CoQ is not associated with undue risk of
harm in the HD population, even though the
observed number of deaths was higher in the CoQ
group.
Possible explanations for the finding of no benefit
of CoQ, other than the actual absence of an effect,
include (1) the study lacked adequate power to detect
an effect, (2) selected outcome measures were not

 sensitive enough to detect an effect, or (3) the treat-
ment duration was insufficient. These explanations
are improbable. A plausible alternative explanation
would be that CoQ cannot counteract the neurode-
generative process in manifest HD, at which time cel-
lular rescue may be difficult or not influenced by
CoQ. It is notable that reported benefit of CoQ in
preclinical HD models is variable.18,23 Considering
the complexity and heterogeneity of neurodegenera-
tion, as well as limitations inherent in preclinical
models for representing human disease, interpreting
data and generating hypotheses from preclinical neu-
rodegenerative models remains challenging.
It is conceivable that a more efficient or concen-
trated delivery of CoQ to the brain may be more ben-
eficial than the formulation studied here, or that
efficacy can only be discernable if CoQ is given prior
to the onset of symptoms, i.e., in at-risk patients. In
that regard, investigators have studied creatine,
a phosphate buffer that bolsters adenosine 59-triphos-
phate levels, in asymptomatic carriers or at-risk pa-
tients with HD over 18 months.32 No substantial
differences in cognitive outcome measures were seen
between groups, but radiographic measures demon-
strated a substantial treatment effect on cortical and
striatal atrophy. A similar approach—testing CoQ in
patients with premanifest disease—may be reason-
able. The current study did not use radiographic out-
come
measures,
and
the
question
of whether
substantial treatment effects on imaging outcomes
are of clinical importance over time has yet to
be answered in HD. More quantitative outcome
measures (e.g., Q-motor, accelerometry) may increase
sensitivity to detect treatment effects, particularly
subtle motor effects, though the clinical value of such
observations may be ambiguous. Future studies of
CoQ in presymptomatic patients, including imaging
outcomes or quantitative assessments, may be worth
considering given the tolerability of high-dosage
CoQ.
Despite not demonstrating a beneficial effect of
CoQ, the 2CARE trial has been a substantial study
for HD therapeutics in terms of its methodology,
duration of observation, long-term commitment of
HD research participants, and the large amount of
prospectively collected data. Further analyses of these
data are expected to yield novel and useful informa-
tion about the progression of HD that will be integral
for planning future clinical studies. Our experience
demonstrates the feasibility of the large simple study
design in this population, in a setting where the eval-
uation of treatments aimed at slowing functional
decline of chronic diseases will need to capture treat-
ment effects over prolonged periods. It is also of value
to consider how outcomes in the study of neurode-
generative diseases are selected. In diseases of this
type, longer duration of follow-up can be expected
to involve increased mortality; optimal handling of
this issue remains a persistent challenge for clinical
trialists in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis.33,34 Innovative approaches in the design and im-
plementation of clinical trials for neurodegenerative
conditions will continue to advance from studies like
2CARE.
