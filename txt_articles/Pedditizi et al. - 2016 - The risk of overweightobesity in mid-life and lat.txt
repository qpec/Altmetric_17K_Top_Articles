Abstract
Scope: it has been suggested that overweight/obesity as a risk factor for incident dementia differs between mid-life and later
life. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the up-to-date current literature to assess this.
Search Methods: inclusion criteria included epidemiological longitudinal studies published up to September 2014, in partici-
pants without cognitive impairment based on evidence of cognitive assessment and aged 30 or over at baseline assessment
with at least 2 years of follow-up. Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library were searched using com-
binations of the search terms: Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Vascular Dementia, Multi-Infarct Dementia, Cognitive decline,
Cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment/Obesity, Overweight, Adiposity, Waist circumference (limits: humans,
English language). Handsearching of all papers meeting the inclusion criteria was performed. A random-effects model was
used for the meta-analysis.
Results: of the 1,612 abstracts identified and reviewed, 21 completely met the inclusion criteria. Being obese below the age of
65 years had a positive association on incident dementia with a risk ratio (RR) 1.41 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.20–1.66),
but the opposite was seen in those aged 65 and over, RR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74–0.94).
Conclusions: this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a positive association between obesity in mid-life and later
dementia but the opposite in late life. Whether weight reduction in mid-life reduces risk is worthy of further study.
Keywords: obesity, overweight, dementia, aged, systematic review, older people
Introduction
The increase in the number of older adults is a major health-
care challenge for the 21st century. Given this demographic
ageing in society and the high correlation with age, dementia
will become an increasing global public health issue with an
ever-increasing impact on health and social care resources.
Currently, in the UK, dementia affects over 830,000 people
with 23 million having a close friend or family member with
dementia [1].
Epidemiological studies addressing the risk of over-
weight/obesity and dementia have reported equivocal results,
particularly when the risk is considered with regard to the
age at which the presence of overweight/obese is assessed.
Studies have suggested that obesity in mid-life is related to a
greater risk of subsequent dementia [2–4], although in older
adults this has not always been observed [5–7]. Previous sys-
tematic reviews [8–10] have reported an association between
obesity and dementia, especially in studies with long follow-
up periods, although they have not all assessed whether the
impact is different depending on whether overweight/
obesity is present in mid-life or late life. A review in 2010 by
Anstey et al. [11] did look by at BMI in mid-life and late life
reporting that continuous BMI was not associated with

 dementia in late life, although that due to small numbers of
studies the generalisability of the findings was reduced and
that additional studies were warranted. More studies [12–18]
have been published since the review by Anstey with regard
to the possible association of overweight/obesity and the
subsequent development of dementia, providing the oppor-
tunity to expand on previous analyses.
Our objective was to use longitudinal epidemiological
studies to evaluate whether overweight/obesity in mid-life or
in late life, in those free of cognitive impairment, was asso-
ciated with the later development of dementia.
Methods
Protocol
Before performing the review, a protocol was generated by
E.P
. and N.B. for which external review was sought and sub-
sequent revisions made. The protocol stipulated the object-
ive, search strategy, criteria for inclusion of studies, data to be
extracted and quality assessment. The hypothesis was to
assess whether being overweight or obese either in mid-life
or in late life was associated with the subsequent develop-
ment of dementia and whether the association differed
depending on the stage in life when assessed. A cut-off of
65 years was proposed for considering whether the popula-
tion being studied was mid-life or late life. This decision was
based on a limited search of the literature as part of a scoping
exercise before generation of the protocol.
Search strategy and selection criteria
Eligibility criteria
To be eligible for inclusion studies needed to be longitudinal,
with at least 2 years of follow-up with an assessment per-
formed for incident dementia. Studies were included if they
stated that they had assessed for prevalent cases of dementia
at baseline and evidence was provided of some form of cog-
nitive assessment at baseline or if the mean age plus 2 stand-
ard deviations (SD) at entry to the study was <60 years as it
was assumed prevalent cases of dementia would be extremely
rare prior to this.
Information sources, search strategy and study selection
Two reviewers (N.B. and R.P
.) independently searched Medline
from 1946 to 28th September 2014, Embase from 1947 to 28th
September 2014, Psychinfo from 1806 to 28th September 2014
and the Cochraine Library to September 2014. The combina-
tions of the following terms were searched: dementia, vascular
dementia, multi-infarct, Alzheimer disease, cognitive decline,
cognitive impairment, obesity, overweight, adiposity or waist
circumference. (See Supplementary data, Appendix S1, avail-
able in Age and Ageing online for search parameters.) The
limits of ‘humans’ and ‘English language’ were applied to the
search criteria as funding was not available for translations.
Following the removal of duplicates from the initial searches,
abstracts were reviewed to identify potentially eligible studies.
Once identified full-text review was performed. If a study
reported results more than once, the most recent eligible
publication was taken. A handsearch of the references of all
papers that met the inclusion criteria and of other published
systematic reviews found during the search was performed.
Published letters, editorials and expert opinions found during
the search were not included. The reviewers independently
determined if each study was eligible for inclusion according
to a pre-specified protocol. Any differences were resolved by
discussion and consensus by all authors. Details of the data ex-
traction can also be found in Supplementary data, Appendix S1,
available in Age and Ageing online.
Risk of bias in individual studies
Quality assessment of eligible studies was performed based
on a tool utilised by Gorospe and Dave [7], but further
developed based on recommendations from Tooth et al. [19].
Studies were scored according to multiple criteria with a final
score ranging between 0 and 23 (see Supplementary data,
Appendix S2, available in Age and Ageing online for scoring
template and criteria).
Results
A total of 5,186 records were identified of which 1,612
abstracts were screened. Of these, 54 met the criteria for full-
text assessment and of these a further 33 were excluded, the
most common reason being for not reporting incident de-
mentia. This left 21 studies to be included. Figure 1 shows
the steps in identifying the studies for inclusion. A summary
table of all the studies can be found in Supplementary data,
Appendix S3, available in Age and Ageing online.
In terms of quality, this was generally high with a mean
score of 15.8 (range 12.5–18) out of 23. The score was
mostly influenced by the absence of covariate adjustment,
neuro-imaging and the consideration of biases, particular
drop-outs. There was little difference in the mean scores for
those reporting on mid-life or late life. The sampling pro-
cesses for recruitment were detailed in all studies, either in
the original manuscript or in a sister publication apart from
one study [20].
Study populations
Most of the studies were conducted either in the USA
(n = 11) [3, 4, 13, 15, 16, 21–25] or in Europe (n = 7) [6, 12,
13, 26–29] with one in Japan [20], one in Australia [14] and
one in Israel [17]. Ethnicity was reported in studies from the
USA and included Japanese Americans [25], Latinos [24]
and African Americans [4, 15]. Sixteen reported on those
aged 65 and over [4, 6, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20–22, 26–29] with five
focusing on younger participants aged below 65 [3, 12, 17,
23, 29] and two on both [4, 18]. For all those that were
defined as late life, the mean age at baseline was over 65
(range 69–82 in those that reported this), for mid-life below
65 (range 42–50.4).

Risk of overweight/obesity for the development of dementia
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/45/1/14/2195252 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Only one study recruited fewer than 500 subjects [26]
with the majority (n = 16) >1,000. In total 62,425 subjects
were included with most recruiting men and women. Gender
split was not reported in all studies and results were usually
not split by gender, although results were usually adjusted for
gender. Two only included men [19, 22] and two only
women [12, 13] with one study recruiting twins [29].
Participants recruited were generally community dwelling,
with one carried in Catholic clergy [21], one in participants in
a clinical trial [13] and one only in diabetics [15]. Educational
status was not reported in all studies and varied between
those that did, ranging from 28.7 to 75.8% for attaining high-
school level. When education was reported, the results were
adjusted for this co-variate.
Assessment of cognition and overweight/obesity
All studies except two carried out some form of cognitive as-
sessment at baseline [3, 17], although both fitted the protocol
accepted definition for inclusion when lacking such assess-
ments. In those that carried out assessments, these varied
from a cognitive test battery, simple screening with the mini-
mental state examination (MMSE) to clinical evaluation. All
employed BMI to define obesity, although some collected
data on waist circumference (WC) and waist–hip ratio
(WHR). In one study [9], both weight and height were self-
reported. With regard to defining overweight or obesity, the
standard WHO defined cut-offs for BMI were used in most
studies but in one [6] overweight was defined as a BMI >27
and in one [5] obese as a BMI of >29.6. In reporting the

 results, BMI was used as a categorical variable in 14 studies,
as a continuous variable in 10.
Cases
The length of follow-up varied from 4 to 42 years. The ma-
jority followed up participants for <10 years. Subjects were
generally seen every 2–5 years, although one study only saw
subjects at baseline and 8 years later [28] and 2 only 36 years
after baseline [3, 17]. Those that looked at the association
between mid-life and later, dementia had a longer duration of
follow-up (range 23–42 years) compared with late life (range
3.2–18 years). Consequently, the attrition from baseline was
higher in those reporting on mid-life.
Overall, there were 5,303 cases of dementia of which
1,555 were reported in those solely reporting on mid-life.
One did not report the actual number of cases [6]. The
method most commonly used to identify incident cases was
initial case identification either by screening with a general
screening tool or a cognitive test battery followed by diag-
nostic assessment with standardised criteria, with the DSM
III-R/DSM-IV and NINCDS/ADRAD most frequently
used. Most reported all dementia, although what was
included within this varied. Two reported only on AD [21,
23], eight reported results for incident cases of VaD and
AD [4, 5, 12, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29], of which three reported
results on mid-life [4, 12, 29]. There was variability as to
which cases were included within each subtype. In those
that reported AD, there were 1,253 cases and for VaD 490.
The ratio of AD to VaD varied from 0.84 to 3.23, with all
those focusing on mid-life reporting a 2-fold higher
number of AD than VaD. Those focusing on late life were
more varied ranging from more VaD to AD cases to a 3-
fold higher number of AD.
Mid-life obesity/overweight and incident dementia
Of the seven studies that reported results for being over-
weight in mid-life, two [3, 29] reported a positive association,
the others non-significant results (see Table 1). With regard
to obesity, only five of the studies reported results [3, 4, 17,
18, 23] and of those one reported a positive association [3]
and four showed non-significant results, although the point
estimate was above 1 in all. Four [3, 4, 17, 18] reported results
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analyses (Supplementary
data, Figures S2A and B, available in Age and Ageing online).
There were 599 dementia cases in the 6,065 considered to be
overweight compared with 653 in 7,979 in the control group.
The overall relative risk (RR) was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.99–1.22).
With regard to obesity, there were 166 cases with a RR of
1.41 (95% CI: 1.20–1.65). There was no evidence of hetero-
geneity. The results with regard to the subtype of dementia
were in line for all dementia for both overweight and obese.
Late-life obesity/overweight and incident dementia
Of the 16 studies reporting on late life, 10 reported on BMI
as a continuous variable. Of these, six [12, 16, 18, 20, 25, 27]
showed no significant association, three [15, 21,28] a negative
association and one [26] positive. Seven reported results for
being overweight of which four [4, 6, 12, 18] reported non-
significant results and three [5, 24, 27] a negative association.
With regard to obesity of the six studies that reported results,
three [14, 18, 25] reported non-significant results, two [4, 24]
a negative association and one [22] positive. Five of the
studies [4, 5, 14, 18, 27] reported results suitable for inclusion
in the meta-analyses for overweight and four [4, 5, 18, 27] for
obesity (Supplementary data, Figures S3A and B, available in
Age and Ageing online). There were 989 cases of dementia in
the 8,413 considered to be overweight compared with 896
in the control group (n = 5,866). The overall RR was 0.88
(95% CI: 0.76–1.02). For obesity, there were 362 cases from
3,262 compared with 691 from 5,190 controls with a RR of
0.83 (95% CI: 0.74–0.94). There was no evidence of hetero-
geneity for obesity, although there was for being overweight
with an I2 of 53%, P = 0.09. Again the results with regard to
subtype were in line for all dementia for overweight and
obese.
Discussion
The results of this systematic review and meta-analyses
suggest a positive association with being overweight/obese
below the age of 65 years and the later development of de-
mentia, although the opposite for aged 65 and over.
These findings are in line with individual studies for
mid-life obesity/overweight and subsequent dementia as well
as other recent systematic reviews [30]. The negative associ-
ation with regard to late life is in line with previous results
but with the addition of new data now shows a significant
result that has not been previously reported. In the review by
Anstey et al., which included only two studies for obese vs.
not obese in late life for all dementia, the RR was 1.11 (95%
CI: 0.80–1.55). They did not report results for obese vs.
normal BMI for late life.
The results for mid-life were consistent across the studies
with no heterogeneity and simply add to the consistent data
linking obesity in mid-life to the later development of de-
mentia. The current trends in the prevalence of obesity
within many societies can be expected to impact further on
the predicted increase dementia from ageing alone. With the
current levels of obesity, it has been suggested that the num-
ber of those with dementia could be up to 9–19% higher
than the number predicted based on ageing alone [30, 31].
However, the reverse should also be considered. Reducing
obesity prevalence to 20% over the next 10 years could lead
to a 10% reduction in the number of people aged 65–69 with
dementia in 2050 [31].
The results for late life raise the possibility of a decreased
risk of developing dementia. However, there was a degree of
heterogeneity with regard to being overweight, and the result
did not reach statistical significance. For obesity, no hetero-
geneity was seen, although again the overall number of
studies was small. Such a result could be related to the fact
that lower weight in late life is frequently associated with

 other co-morbidities, and moreover, an accelerated decline in
BMI during late life may precede the clinical detection of de-
mentia [32]. Unplanned weight loss can be a marker for pre-
clinical Dementia. For both mid-life and late life, similar
results were seen for AD and VaD.
One of the problems in assessing whether being over-
weight/obese is causally associated with later dementia is that
it is often associated with other co-morbidities especially car-
diovascular risk factors that themselves are associated with
an increased risk of dementia. Being overweight/obese is
often associated with hypertension that has been shown to
be related to the subsequent development of dementia. To
allow for this, the most adjusted reported results were con-
sidered for our review. This aside, there are various mechan-
istic evidences linking obesity and dementia. Keller et al. [33]
have suggested a potential genetic link for increased body
mass and dementia reporting that the FTO AA genotype
increased the risk for dementia, and in particular AD, inde-
pendently of physical inactivity, BMI, diabetes and CVD.
Also there is evidence linking increased BMI and brain path-
ology such as temporal atrophy and grey and white matter
changes in mid-life [34, 35]. However, the correlation
between BMI and brain volumes is unlikely to be direct but
via some factor or mechanisms that cause brain volume re-
duction, including hypercortisolaemia, inflammation, cardio-
vascular risk factors, as well as low levels of exercise. The
interplay between increased vascular risk, metabolic disturb-
ance and adipose-related hormones (leptin and adiponectin)
that exist in those who are overweight/obese and the impact
on dementia-related neuropathologies is complex and not yet
fully understood [36]. Going against our findings is that
higher BMI has been shown to be associated with lower grey
matter and white matter volumes throughout the brain in
cognitively normal individuals aged 65 and over [37, 38].
There was a wide variation in the way cognitive impair-
ment was assessed between the different studies, although
generally was more robust at follow-up than at baseline. The
differentiation between AD and VaD can be difficult with
both pathologies often present at post-mortem. Thus, the
focus of this review was overall dementia. Even then, there
was variation between studies as to the different types that
were included within the overall diagnosis of dementia. We
felt it was important to ensure that some assessment of cog-
nition was performed at baseline to try to ensure that those
included in the analysis were at least initially considered to be
cognitively intact. During our search, we identified several
papers relating overweight/obesity in mid-life and later de-
mentia that did not meet our inclusion criteria because of the
lack of a specified baseline cognitive assessment. Although
we feel this makes these results more robust, it could have
lead to the loss of important data.
With regards to the issue of the assessment of obesity, we
only included studies that reported results for BMI to maxi-
mise consistency across the studies, although even then not
all studies used standard accepted cut-offs. With ageing,
there is an increase in fat mass and decline in lean mass.
Thus, the use of BMI in older individuals will not adequately
reflect fat accumulation. Measures of absolute girth are likely
to be better surrogate measures of body fat and may be more
reliable for older individuals. The association seen for late life
may simply be a result of BMI being a poor marker for
obesity in such individuals.
The choice of age cut-offs for defining mid-life and late
life is arbitrary and as such caution should be exercised in
drawing conclusions in regard to this. The choice was driven
by the cut-offs used by the individual studies themselves.
However, in all the studies included in the meta-analysis for
mid-life, the mean age of participants was around 50 years;
for those reporting on late life, it was above 70 for most. The
length of follow-up will also impact on any association and
those studies focusing on mid-life not surprisingly had a
longer follow-up than those focusing on late life. It may be
that it is the number of years exposed to being overweight/
obese that is critical. It has been suggested that a new metric
for consideration of risk could be that of ‘obesity-years’ [39]
akin to that of pack-years for cigarette smoking.
These results are in line with the concept of the obesity
paradox. Various explanations have been suggested for this,
although whether it truly exists remains a point of debate
[40]. A cohort of obese individuals in late life will be a heter-
ogenous group of those who have been obese for sometimes
and those who were of normal weight but have gained weight
in later years. The reverse will be true for normal weight.
A study of Finnish men followed up from mid-life to late life
showed that in old age both normal weight and overweight
were a mixture of individuals with different weight trajector-
ies and that overweight and high cardiovascular risk in
mid-life with subsequent weight decrease predicted the worst
outcome in late life [41]. It may well be that changes in body
mass is the better predictor for incident dementia and is
worthy of further study. A study of over 4,000 men in
Australia aged 65–84 showed that those who maintained a
stable body mass had the lowest incidence of dementia [42].
The quality of the studies included in the review was
assessed using a scale used in a previous systematic review of
BMI and dementia [7] although modified based on recom-
mendations for improving the quality of reporting of longitu-
dinal observational research [19]. We feel that it is in line with
the recommendations suggested by the quality assessment
tool for quantitative studies as proposed by the Effective
Public Health Practice Project [43]. The overall quality of the
studies included in the review was generally high with little
difference in the mean scores for those reporting on mid-life
and late life. The studies included in the meta-analyses all
scored above average.
In summary, this systematic review and meta-analyses
provide evidence to support the association between over-
weight/obesity in mid-life and the subsequent development of
dementia. In late life, a reverse association was seen. The
results are likely to reflect that maintaining ones weight in later
life is a sign of health, and unplanned weight loss is a cause for
concern. However, one can not extrapolate to suggest that in-
tentional weight loss in late life in those who are overweight or
obese may not have an advantageous effect on health and

 well-being. Such an observation would fit with the obesity
paradox that has been proposed for various other diseases and
should be considered in any future studies when assessing the
association between obesity and dementia. However, even if
this association is true there is as yet no evidence to suggest that
weight loss in mid-life will lead to a reduction in incident de-
mentia, although these results support the inclusion of weight
loss in any future preventive trials carried out in mid-life.
Key points
• Mid-life obesity is associated with an increased risk of inci-
dent dementia.
• Late-life obesity shows a negative association with incident
dementia.
• The obesity paradox is seen with regard to dementia and
ageing.

Abstract
Objective: one-third of community-dwelling older adults fall annually. Exercise that challenges balance is proven to prevent
falls. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to determine the impact of yoga-based exercise on balance and
physical mobility in people aged 60+ years.
Methods: searches for relevant trials were conducted on the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and the Physiotherapy Evidence
Database (PEDro) from inception to February 2015. Trials were included if they evaluated the effect of physical yoga (exclud-
ing meditation and breathing exercises alone) on balance in people aged 60+ years. We extracted data on balance and the
secondary outcome of physical mobility. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
using random-effects models. Methodological quality of trials was assessed using the 10-point Physiotherapy Evidence
Database (PEDro) Scale.
Results: six trials of relatively high methodological quality, totalling 307 participants, were identified and had data that could be
included in a meta-analysis. Overall, yoga interventions had a small effect on balance performance (Hedges’ g = 0.40, 95% CI
0.15–0.65, 6 trials) and a medium effect on physical mobility (Hedges’ g = 0.50, 95% CI 0.06–0.95, 3 trials).
Conclusion: yoga interventions resulted in small improvements in balance and medium improvements in physical mobility in
people aged 60+ years. Further research is required to determine whether yoga-related improvements in balance and mobility
translate to prevention of falls in older people.
