SUMMARY
Intratumoral heterogeneity of signaling networks may contribute to targeted cancer therapy resistance,
including in the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM). We performed single-cell phosphoproteomics
on a patient-derived in vivo GBM model of mTOR kinase inhibitor resistance and coupled it to an analytical
approach for detecting changes in signaling coordination. Alterations in the protein signaling coordination
were resolved as early as 2.5 days after treatment, anticipating drug resistance long before it was clinically
manifest. Combination therapies were identified that resulted in complete and sustained tumor suppression
in vivo. This approach may identify actionable alterations in signal coordination that underlie adaptive
resistance, which can be suppressed through combination drug therapy, including non-obvious drug
combinations.
INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most lethal human cancers, is a
paradigmatic example of intratumoral heterogeneity. The Can-
cer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has revealed that prevalent GBM mu-
tations and copy-number variations (CNVs) cluster along a small
set of druggable signaling pathways, including (1) receptor tyro-
sine kinase (RTK)/RAS/PI3K signaling, (2) p53 signaling, and (3)
Rb signaling (Brennan et al., 2013). However, clinical trials with
targeted monotherapies against these mutations or their down-
stream effectors have yet to favorably affect patient outcomes,
as tumors rapidly acquire resistance (Cloughesy and Mischel,
2011; Nathanson et al., 2014). Intratumoral molecular heteroge-
neity may play a critical role in cancer drug resistance, and
new technologies that facilitate resolving such heterogeneity,
including single-cell RNA, DNA, and even protein analyses (Irish
et al., 2004; Kalisky et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014)
are becoming increasingly available. Mining such information to
Significance
Genomic analyses of GBM tumors have revealed a core set of mutations that reside along druggable pathways, but drugs
targeted to those pathways have only marginally improved patient outcomes, with the rapid development of drug resistance
being almost universal. Using genomics and single-cell phosphoproteomics analyses of a human-derived in vivo GBM
model of mTORki resistance, we show that drug resistance can proceed via a non-genetic (adaptive) mechanism that is acti-
vated within days of drugging. The measured adaptive response points to combination therapies that are tested in vivo and
shown to halt tumor growth. This single-cell analytic approach appears to provide clinically actionable insights into
designing combination therapy strategies for more effectively treating GBM patients.

 anticipate drug resistance and derive more effective combina-
tion therapies remains a serious challenge.
As a central signaling node of the RTK/RAS/PI3K signaling,
the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which
is hyperactivated in approximately 90% of GBMs, constitutes
a
compelling
drug
target
(Cloughesy
et
al.,
2013;
Gini
et al., 2013). However, resistance to targeted monotherapies
against mTOR has been correlated to multiple genetic and
non-genetic processes (Cope et al., 2014; Gini et al., 2013;
Rodrik-Outmezguine et al., 2011, 2014). Specifically, studies
have shown that mutations in the mTORC1 regulators TSC1
and TSC2, or in the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain, confer
resistance to the allosteric mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which
has activity primarily against mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
(Iyer et al., 2012; Wagle et al., 2014). Moreover, breast cancer
cells carrying mutations in the catalytic domain of mTOR are
resistant to a dual ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase
inhibitor (mTORki) (Rodrik-Outmezguine et al., 2014). These
results demonstrate that resistance to any single therapy can
occur when drug-resistant tumor cell subpopulations expand
to drive recurrence, akin to Darwinian-type evolution under
the selection pressure of the drug (Bozic et al., 2013). At pre-
sent, no GBM-associated genetic mutations conferring resis-
tance to the ATP-competitive mTORki have been identified,
and the mutational spectra that promote such resistance are
not well understood.
Tumors may also develop resistance through altered protein
signaling networks. Studies performed in breast cancer and
GBM cells treated with mTORki indicated the rapid induction
of a compensatory protein kinase B (Akt)-dependent signaling
and an autophagy-dependent tumor cell survival (Gini et al.,
2013; Rodrik-Outmezguine et al., 2011), respectively. These
studies demonstrate that protein network rewiring could lead
to resistance through which cancer cells quickly adapt to that
drug, so as to maintain the signal flux through those networks
required for tumor maintenance and growth (Bergers and Hana-
han, 2008; Elkabets et al., 2013; Krakstad and Chekenya, 2010;
Lee et al., 2012; Muranen et al., 2012). These resistance-promot-
ing networks may be differentially expressed by the cells within a
tumor (Marusyk et al., 2012).
The time scale of the appearance of resistance can depend
upon the mechanism. For Darwinian selection, the relatively
long-term cell-cycle selection of the resistant subpopulation
can be limiting. Deep sequencing of tumors can potentially
detect those rare cell subpopulations, and thus help guide the
selection of a second drug that forestalls resistance by targeting
that population (Al-Lazikani et al., 2012; Brennan et al., 2013;
Chin et al., 2008; Wacker et al., 2012). By contrast, resistance
via adaptation can develop quickly. Thus the challenge is to
measure the structure and adaptive response kinetics of the
protein signaling networks that are influenced by the drug, and
thereby identify any druggable signaling pathways that are
active or activated during drugging. Such analysis might point
to therapy combinations that inhibit tumor growth and stave off
resistance.
Here
we
investigate
the
basic
resistance
mechanism
(Darwinian versus adaptation) in a patient-derived epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated in vivo GBM model of
mTORki resistance. The findings inform a series of investigations
designed to provide a priori predictions of targeted monothera-
pies and therapy combinations that will or will not be effective
at staving off resistance. The resultant approach has implica-
tions for guiding combination therapies that can more effectively
treat certain classes of GBM patients.
RESULTS
Genomic Analysis and Stem Cell Marker Tracing in an
In Vivo Model of mTORki Resistance Suggest an
Adaptive Mechanism of Resistance
To generate a model of mTORki resistance in a clinically relevant,
patient-derived model, we treated mice bearing GBM39 xeno-
grafts with CC214-2, an ATP-competitive mTORki that crosses
the blood-brain barrier and inhibits mTOR kinase activity in
GBM cells (Gini et al., 2013). CC214-2 treatment (100 mg/kg,
once every 2 days by gavage) significantly decreased tumor
growth rate relative to control-treated mice (Figures 1A and
1B) and reduced tumor glucose uptake as measured by [18F]
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography
(PET) (Figures 1B and S1A). This initial response to CC214-2

 was concordant with inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2
signaling, and decreased Ki-67 labeling, a measure of tumor
cell proliferation, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
analysis of tumor tissue (Figures 1C and S1B; Table S1). By
day 27, rapid tumor regrowth occurred with concomitant in-
creases in glucose uptake and tumor volume, reactivation of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, and marked increase in Ki-
67 labeling, thus modeling the clinical scenario of resistance
(Figures 1A–1C).
We sought to characterize the mechanism of acquired
mTORki resistance by GBM39 through genomic and phenotypic
analyses. Therefore, we performed DNA CNV and whole-exome
sequencing (WES) analyses to resolve the basal molecular state
of GBM39 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and to determine
whether a gain-of-function mutation or potential mTORki-pro-
moted mutation was responsible for acquired drug resistance.
CNV analysis and WES of tumor xenografts at baseline revealed
a typical mutational pattern of a GBM clustering around three
‘‘core pathways’’: RTK signaling, cell-cycle control, and TP53
signaling (Figure 2A). The CNV analysis showed that the RTK
signaling pathway contained EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII
mutation along with multiple non-synonymous mutations in
PTEN, NF1, and PIK(3)K genes. Analysis of the TP53 pathway
revealed one non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant in
TP53. Analysis of the cell-cycle regulation pathway revealed
CDKN2A/2B deletion and CDK6 amplification. We analyzed
the synonymous and non-synonymous mutations using the
PROVEAN/SIFT program and identified mutations generating
variants predicted to have a deleterious or damaging effect

We
compared
this
baseline
genomic profile with that of (1) tumors
that initially responded to CC214-2 based
on reduced glucose uptake and lower
tumor volume, and (2) tumors that were
rapidly regrowing (Figure 1). No mutations
in genes whose proteins have been shown
to promote resistance to mTOR inhibitors,
including TSC1 and TSC2, or MTOR itself,
were detected in the tumors (Tables S2 and S3) (Iyer et al., 2012;
Wagle et al., 2014). Although responsive and resistant samples
shared several, non-synonymous loss-of-heterozygosity alter-
ations (Table S2), no new driver oncogenes were found that
could potentially be responsible for drug resistance. Further-
more, we performed whole-genome analysis and identified
CNVs in control and resistant GBM39 tumors (Figures 2B and
S2). We determined whether these CNVs were specific to a
particular sample or shared between samples that received the
same treatment (Figures 2B and S2A; Table S4). We reason
that this second category of treatment-specific CNVs (summa-
rized in Table S4) would be more representative of variations
consequent to the drug treatment. We then analyzed the corre-
sponding transcriptional profiles of the genes encoded within
those CNVs (Figure S2B and Table S5). No correlation between
CNVs and altered gene expression profiles were detected,
indicating that the CNVs were most likely only passenger varia-
tions (Figure S2C) and did not trigger the onset of the resistant
phenotype.
We next analyzed a panel of GBM cancer stem cell phenotypic
markers that are correlated with resistance against a number of
therapies (Schonberg et al., 2014) (Figure S3). We did not detect
any changes in the expression of these markers, suggesting
that resistance is not mediated by preferential proliferation of a
drug-resistant stem cell population.
Taken together, these studies suggest the absence of genetic
selection of a resistant phenotype as a dominant resistance
mechanism. This points to the possibility of an adaptive mecha-
nism of resistance through protein signaling rewiring.

 Single-Cell Analysis of Phosphoprotein Signaling Levels
using an In Vivo Model of mTORki Adaptation
Guided by knowledge of signaling proteins commonly altered in
GBM (Brennan et al., 2013; Chin et al., 2008; Sarkaria et al.,
2007), we quantified the levels of 12 proteins and phosphopro-
teins in the GBM39 PDXs using single-cell IHC analysis (Figures
1C and S1B; Table S1). The protein panel included biomarkers
of mTOR activity, phospho (p)-mTOR, p70 ribosomal protein
S6 kinase phosphorylation (p-P70S6K), ribosomal protein S6
phosphorylation (p-S6), eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E binding protein 1 (p-4E-BP1), protein kinase B phosphoryla-
tion (p-Akt1), proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (p-PRAS40),
and N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (p-NDRG1) protein
phosphorylation (Gini et al., 2013); biomarkers of compensatory
transduction pathways downstream of EGFR, extracellular
signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (p-ERK) (Mendoza
et al., 2011), sarcoma kinase phosphorylation (p-Src) (Lu et al.,
2009); a hypoxia index, hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a);
and two functional readouts, Ki-67 for cell proliferation and
TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling) assay for apoptosis.
During the responsive phase, CC214-2 treatment significantly
reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling and cellular prolifera-

tion. Apoptotic cell death was registered
only in approximately 1.5% of the cell
population. Upon the onset of resistance,
mTOR signaling was reactivated, as well
as increased cellular proliferation, consis-
tent with the reconstitution of tumor
growth (Figures 1 and S1; Table S1). The
availability of tumor tissues at baseline,
during the midst of the response, and at
the time of tumor regrowth provided the
opportunity to compare and confirm the
single-cell IHC data using the single-cell
barcode chip (SCBC) platform.
mTOR
signaling
varies
dramatically
from cancer cell to cancer cell in GBM39,
with EGFRvIII-positive tumor cells showing particularly high
levels of mTOR signaling and representing the most abundant
and aggressive phenotype (Gini et al., 2013; Nathanson et al.,
2014). EGFRvIII and EGFR wild-type-expressing (EGFR+) tumor
cells were separated from mouse cells and debris, and sorted us-
ing an anti-EGFR antibody. EGFR+ cells were then passaged for
2 hr in culture to eliminate dead cells and then applied to the
SCBC platform (Figure 3A). The SCBC platform (Wei et al.,
2013) was designed with 310 1.5-nl volume microchambers,
each engineered for cell lysis and equipped with a full antibody
array used in the IHC analysis, with the addition of the tumor pro-
tein p53 (p53) pathway biomarkers, p53 and cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor protein 1A (p21) (Brennan et al., 2013), and cas-
pase-3 as an apoptosis marker. Following cell lysis, the proteins
were captured on the antibody array and each array element was
developed as a sandwich fluorescent immunoassay (Figure S4).
A one-chip dataset included the digitized fluorescence signals
from nine proteins measured from each of �100 one-cell micro-
chambers and �100 zero-cell microchambers (for signal back-
ground normalization). Two SCBCs were used for each condition
studied. Scatterplots of one-cell data are provided in Figure 3B.
Comparing these single-cell results with single-cell IHC and
immunoblotting analyses performed on bulk tumor samples

 confirmed that CC214-2 suppressed mTORC1 and mTORC2
signaling, which became reactivated during resistance (Figures
3B–3D). These results indicate that the SCBC assays on EGFR+
cells separated from the resected GBM39 tumors and the IHC
assays on tumor tissues from those same models yield similar re-
sults across the time course of therapy.
Single-Cell Analysis of Phosphoprotein Signaling
Coordination of the In Vivo Model of mTORki Adaptation
Identifies Drug-Activated Signaling Modes
The SCBC single-cell analysis yields two independent classes of
information: the protein levels and the protein-protein correla-
tions (Figures 4A and S5A). The latter can be mined to evaluate
the coordinated signatures of the signaling proteins (Figure 4B).
During response, CC214-2 profoundly diminished the levels of
most proteins, as seen in the changes in sphere sizes between
control and responsive plots of Figure 4A, but perhaps more
clearly in the uppermost bar graph in Figure 4A. CC214-2 also
strongly reduced the protein-protein correlations, as indicated
by the loss of network edges of responsive plot relative to con-
trol. To evaluate the change in tumor heterogeneity across the
three stages, we employed a functional heterogeneity index
(FHI). The FHI reflects the dispersion of the functional protein
levels across all single-cell assays at a specific condition. It is
defined as the dissimilarity value in the agglomerative hierarchi-
cal clustering (AHC) of mean normalized single-cell data based
upon Ward’s minimum variance method (Ward, 1963). In the
responsive state, there is a more than 4-fold drop in the FHI (Fig-
ures 4C and S5B).
The tumors were again probed at the resistant state (day 39
following the start of therapy). At this point, all protein levels

were at or above those observed for the
vehicle (Figures 3B and 3D, and upper
bar graph in Figure 4A). In addition, the
correlation network indicated increased
signaling activity, as reflected in the emer-
gence of nine new correlations (green
edges in the resistant plot of Figure 4A), eight of which were
associated with p-ERK1 and p-Src. These results suggest
that a gain of function through ERK/Src might be leading to
CC214-2 resistance by promoting downstream mTOR signaling
(Carracedo et al., 2008; Mendoza et al., 2011; Sunayama et al.,
2010). Resistance was also associated with a sharp increase in
the FHI (Figure 4C).
We analyzed how the overall protein signaling coordination
is altered by mTOR kinase inhibition. To this end we performed
principal component analysis (PCA), using the two-dimensional
matrix of measured protein-protein co-variances as input. We
then calculated the correlations between the assayed proteins
and the first principal component (PC1) in response to CC214-2.
PC1 captures the most essential feature of the signaling network,
so this analysis provides an estimate of which proteins participate
moststronglyinthat signaling. Forthecontrol tumor,PC1ispopu-
lated by p-ERK1, p-Src, p-Akt1, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K (left
panel of Figure 4B). In response to CC214-2, these five proteins
bifurcate into two groups, or modes (a term used to imply
collective behavior). Following 19 days of treatment in vivo with
CC214-2, the influence of p-Akt1, p-mTOR, and p-P70S6K
(red mode of Figure 4B) on signaling coordination, relative to
p-ERK1 and p-Src (blue mode), is diminished. The implication is
that the drug diminishes the signaling coordination associated
with mTORC1/C2 signaling while activating ERK and Src
signaling. This observation suggested that the latter may have
gained the ability to maintain signal flux to key downstream
mTOR effectors. Strikingly, this same conclusion may also be
drawn through a similar analysis of EGFR+ cells that were ex-
tracted from the control and treated in vitro with 2 mM CC214-1
(the counterpart of CC214-2 for in vitro use) (Gini et al., 2013) for

 only 2.5 days (right panel of Figure 4B). Thus, although the
changes in protein levels between the control and the responsive
tumors, or between the control and the cells treated for 2.5 days
in vitro, imply an effective drug response, the shift in signaling
network coordination points to the rapid emergence of a potential
compensatory mechanism (Figure S5C). We cannot exclude the
possibility that increased drug metabolism or drug efflux contrib-
utes to the tumor cell adaptation observed. However, our results
point to a facile resistance mechanism of adaptation, with the
drug-activated signaling networks providing potential targets for
combination therapy.
Combination Therapies Indicated by Changes in
Signaling Coordination Yield Effective In Vivo
Treatments
The data of Figure 4B suggest that targeting any one of the five
proteins is unlikely to exhibit a strong anti-cancer effect, and tar-
geting any two proteins from the same mode would also be ex-
pected to be a poor strategy. However, simultaneously targeting
one protein from each mode might be effective. Correspond-
ingly, we treated mice implanted with GBM39 using combina-
tions of CC214-2 (C), dasatinib (D, Src inhibitor), and U0126
(U, MEK inhibitor) to test four therapies or therapy combinations
expected to be ineffective, and three therapy combinations ex-
pected to be effective. Consistent with our model, treatment
with C, D, U, or D + U could not induce sustained tumor growth
inhibition in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, combining C with either D
and/or U completely suppressed tumor growth, with no adverse

5A, 5B, and S6). In vivo treatment was
stopped after 47 days with no sign of
recurrence (Figure 5A). Removal of the
combination therapy resulted in rapid tu-
mor
regrowth.
This
was
concomitant
with reactivation of mTORC1/C2 signaling
pathways (Figure S1 and Table S1).

that

a therapeutically representative in vivo
model of GBM (Sarkaria et al., 2007),
long-term
disease
remission
can
be
induced and sustained if independent
signaling modes are identified and suffi-
ciently inhibited. Importantly, those inde-
pendent signaling modes were uniquely resolved via single-cell
proteomic analysis after only a couple of days of in vitro treat-
ment of EGFR+ cells separated from the untreated tumor. This
time frame is well before the emergence of observable therapeu-
tic resistance.
Analysis of the Functional Roles of the Signaling Modes
To develop deeper insight into the independent signaling modes
identified via single-cell analysis, we developed a partial least
squares (PLS) model to identify possible relationships between
the single-cell IHC data (Figure 5B) and tumor functional
behavior (Janes et al., 2005). PLS analysis is similar to PCA but
seeks to identify the principal components of one dataset (the
IHC analysis in Figure 5B) that can best predict a second dataset
(functional observations of the tumor). Quantitative IHC assays
of resected tumor tissues from all seven tested therapy combi-
nations and from the control were loaded into an explanatory
matrix (Figure 6A and Table S6). The dependent matrix was con-
structed from the transitory growth rate (TGR) at euthanasia and
a cell-cycle metric time constant t. The TGR is defined as the
average percentage of tumor volume change per day of the
last three time points measured before death. The cell-cycle
metric t was extracted by fitting the growth curves with the expo-
nential growth function (Table S6; see Supplemental Experi-

The PLS model was developed using a subset of the data
and then validated through leave-one-out cross-validation and
predictions of the remaining measurements (Figure 6A). The

 agreement between predictions and observations supports the
validity of the model. In Figure 6B we plot the correlations of the
assayed proteins, as well as the functional observations, with
the x axis and y axis as the first and second principal compo-
nents, respectively. The mTORC1/C2-associated proteins that
constitute mode 1 of Figure 4B lie principally along PC1, as
does the TGR. This means that the TGR can be estimated using
just the IHC measurements of the mTORC1/C2 proteins. Impor-
tantly, the TGR correlates with p-S6, p-4E-BP1, and p-Akt, which
are key factors regulating protein translation and cellular prolifer-
ation. The cell-cycle metric t is anti-correlated with the TGR and
the mTORC1/C2-associated proteins but also lies largely along
PC1. The application of effective drug combinations will slow tu-
mor growth, thus increasing the characteristic cell-division time.
Therefore, t is anti-correlated with the TGR. These relationships
indicate that mTORC1/C2 and their effectors are the primary
drivers that account for tumor growth. The functional proteins
p-ERK and p-Src constitute a second group largely aligned along
PC2, with only weak relationships to proteins in the first group.
This is consistent with a compensatory mechanism associated
with ERK signaling and Src signaling. This retrospective analysis
independently confirms the two signaling modes (Figure 4B)
resolved in the SCBC data analysis, and yields insights into their
respective functional roles (Figure 6B).
The PLS model allowed for a comparison of the therapy com-
binations, with each combination represented by its respective
IHC dataset (Table S1). Comparison of the projections of C
and U with C + U (Figure 6C) on the first two principal compo-
nents indicates that C + U projects qualitatively differently from
the linear superposition of single-input C and U. This indicates
a cooperative, non-linear influence of the two drugs on the tu-
mor. Note that the therapeutically ineffective D + U combination
is close to the linear superposition of D and U.
Generality of the Approach
A lesson from the GBM39 study is that, while the CC214-2 inhib-
itor targeted at mTORC1/C2 does repress mTOR signaling, the
cancer cells rapidly activate other signaling to promote drug
resistance. This activation may be detected after only a couple
of days of in vitro treatment of the tumor cells, via single-cell
analysis of protein signaling network coordination. This analysis,
in turn, points to combination therapies that stave off resistance
and thus provide for much more effective treatments. We
explored whether these findings have generality and potential
clinical utility. To this end, we investigated a low-passage cell
pcGBM2 derived from a patient GBM tumor, as well as tumor
cells from a patient’s recurrent-GBM biopsy, taken from the
operating room (Figures 7 and S7). In both cases, the cells
were treated in vitro for 2 days with a targeted inhibitor that
was chosen based upon existing knowledge of the tumor.
The pcGBM2 cells exhibited EGFR overexpression and thus
were treated with an EGFR inhibitor, lapatinib. While the drug
fully engaged the target, as assayed by changes in p-EGFR
levels (Figure 7A), there were new correlations, relative to con-
trol, that emerged between p-ERK1 and core mTOR effectors,
indicating a rapid cellular response to the drug through activa-
tion of ERK signaling (Figure S7A). This was detected in both
the levels of p-ERK and in its role in signaling coordination (Fig-
ure 7B). In fact, lapatinib might even promote tumor cell growth
through strengthening the interaction between PI3K/mTOR
signaling and MEK/ERK signaling (Mendoza et al., 2011). Several
core mTORC1/C2 effectors also increased their role in signaling
coordination (Figure 7B), even as the levels of these proteins
were repressed by the drug. Lapatinib also induced an increase
in glucose uptake (Figure S7B and S7C) (Wang et al., 2013).
This adaptive response indicated that inhibition of EGFR by
lapatinib at this dose would likely be an ineffective therapy. We
validated this prediction by assessing in vitro cell viability and
proliferation after 2 days of lapatinib treatment for both fresh
EGFR+ tumor cells and adapted EGFR+ tumor cells (2-day pre-
treatment with 2 mM lapatinib on fresh EGFR+ tumor cells was
used to establish the adapted EGFR+ tumor cells). Slight cell
death was observed in fresh tumor samples while an increase
in cellular proliferation was apparent in the adapted tumor sam-
ples, consistent with our predictions (Figure 7C). Thus, lapatinib
engaged its target, but the relatively short-term (96 hr) treatment
did not yield significant cell killing.
Figure 6. PLS Modeling Confirms the Presence of Independent
Signaling Modes
(A) Validation of the PLS modeling. The calibration phase of the model was
constructed by randomly choosing part of observations (orange part). The first
two PCs were used to perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to assess
the model stability. The established model was then employed to predict
the TGR at euthanasia and cell-cycle metric t for the remaining observations
(blue area).
(B) Correlations of the IHC-assayed proteins, as well as the functional obser-
vations, with PC1 and PC2. TGR strongly correlates with mTOR effectors
(mode 1: red), while p-Src and p-ERK (mode 2: blue) largely dominate PC2,
constituting an independent signaling mode that accounts for adaptive
response to mTOR kinase inhibitor.
(C) PLS modeling shows that for effective drug combinations projections are
qualitatively different from linear superposition of individual drugs, which in
turn implies that synergistic drug combinations do not simply act in a linearly
additive manner.

 It is interesting to note that most pre-existing protein-protein
correlations associated with mTOR and its effectors were not
significantly altered by lapatinib (Figure 7B). This suggested
that a combination treatment of an mTOR inhibitor (XL-765, in
GBM clinical trials) (Cloughesy et al., 2013) with a MEK inhibitor
(trametinib, T) might be more effective. Consistent with this pre-
diction, treatment of fresh cells for 60 hr with this combination, at
a clinically relevant dose, did cause significant cell killing with
a reduction in the FHI (Figures 7D and S7D). Although the
p-ERK1 level in the surviving cells was higher than in the un-
treated cells, its influence over the signaling coordination was
significantly decreased following treatment (Figures 7B and
S7A). These data indicate that, for the EGFR+ pcGBM2 cells,
there are rapid adaptive responses to a targeted EGFR inhibitor,
and a quantitative analysis of those responses leads to a choice
of a therapy combination that yields improved cell killing and
represses the adaptive response, at least within the limits of
what was measured.
The freshly resected patient GBM biopsy was characterized
as having a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) G127E
loss-of-function mutation, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(FGFR3) K650E gain-of-function mutation, and a tuberous scle-
rosis complex 1 (TSC1) loss-of-function splice site mutation. All
of these mutations can contribute to PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway
activation (Fenton et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2003). We thus examined the effect of the PI3K/mTOR dual in-
hibitor XL-765. Single-cell analysis of a primary GBM biopsy is
challenging because of the limited quantity of tissue and the
smaller cell size (and thus lower protein levels). Thus, the freshly
resected GBM cells were analyzed using SCBCs with enhanced
antibody barcodes and a signal-amplification strategy. Analysis
of the control and treated cells (Figures S7E–S7H) revealed that
XL-765 treatment repressed all protein levels in the assayed
panel, but sharply activated signaling coordination through the
mTOR effector p-4E-BP1. Thus, from this limited dataset we
would anticipate that treatment of this tumor with XL-765 would
not be effective, as it fails to inhibit one of the key components of
mTORC1 signaling. Unfortunately, there was insufficient material
from this tumor to permit additional tests with combination
therapies. However, these data show that an SCBC platform
can analyze a challenging GBM biopsy, revealing both drug-
repressed and drug-activated phosphoprotein signaling. This
type of analysis might constitute a valuable tool for clinicians to
predict more effective upfront treatments for cancer patients.
DISCUSSION
For a patient-derived GBM39 model of mTORki resistance, we
show that compensatory rewiring of signaling pathways during
the responsive state of the treatment acts as a dominant mech-
anism of resistance. These resistance-leading protein networks
are readily resolved using SCBCs through analysis of the differ-
ential responses in signaling coordination, but not through anal-
ysis of changes in corresponding average protein levels. Such
drug-activated networks can subsequently be co-targeted to
arrest tumor growth in vivo. The same compensatory protein
signaling is also detected within 3 days of in vitro drug treatment
of tumor cells resected from an untreated model.
Our approach has been applied in analyzing additional GBM
patient samples. We have observed adaptive responses in these
samples as reflected by the activation of specific signaling path-
ways upon in vitro or in vivo drug treatment with different tar-
geted inhibitors. However, the precious nature of the patient
samples precluded testing any combination therapy hypothe-
ses. Thus, as an additional demonstration of generality,
we applied the same SCBC technology and associated algo-
rithm toward investigating a dedifferentiation-based adaptive
response mechanism to patient-derived BRAFV600E mutant mel-
anomas treated with BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) or certain im-
munotherapies (data not shown). The resulting analysis of
changes in protein signaling coordination yielded a successful
prediction of a combination targeted therapy that arrested the
cellular dedifferentiation. This result demonstrates the applica-
bility of our approach in models of other cancers, but this
work, and work reported elsewhere (Bergers and Hanahan,
2008; Nathanson et al., 2014; Pisco et al., 2013), also highlights

 the facile ability of many cancers to adapt to targeted inhibitors.
For the cases explored here, measurements of drug-activated
signaling networks can provide actionable insight into the adap-
tive response. This is particularly relevant for GBM tumors,
where the development of drug resistance is seen in virtually
every patient.
SCBCs have been compared against related single cell
methods in the recent literature (Heath et al., 2016). Advantages
of SCBCs for analysis of patient materials include the require-
ment of only a small amount of cells (�1,000), and that cells
are imaged prior to analysis. This combination is crucial for tumor
biopsy samples that usually contain non-cellular debris. The pro-
tein panels explored here were chosen using prior knowledge of
the nature of the tumors and tumor models under study. A more
comprehensive panel would permit an unbiased analysis of all
four of the GBM-associated signaling networks identified by
the TCGA working group (Brennan et al., 2013). The results indi-
cate that single-cell quantitative proteomics may provide useful
information for guiding the choice of targeted therapies and ther-
apy combinations. This hypothesis will need to be tested in a
clinical trial, and the work reported here motivates additional
pre-clinical work to set the stage for such a trial.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The experimental methods are briefly summarized here, with full details in Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Lines, Primary Cells, and Reagents
GBM39 primary neurospheres were previously described by our group (Na-
thanson et al., 2014) and authenticated by luciferase reporter expression
before the beginning of the in vivo experiments. The pcGBM2 cell line derived
from a 15-year-old male patient bearing an EGFRvIII+ GBM tumor was a kind
gift from Dr. Michelle Monje (Stanford University) upon informed consent
following the Stanford University Ethical Committee regulations. The cells
were cultured in tumor sphere media. The patient samples were collected
from freshly resected brain tumors upon informed consent following the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Ethical Committee regulations. The
resected tumors were blood cell depleted and dissociated into single-cell sus-
pension immediately after collection from the operating room.
Targeted Inhibitors
CC214-1 and CC214-2 were provided by Celgene (Mortensen et al.,
2013). Lapatinib ditosylate (GW-572016), trametinib (GSK1120212), XL-
765 (SAR245409), U0126, erlotinib, and dasatinib were obtained from
Selleckchem.
GBM39 Flank Xenografts
GBM39 flank xenografts were obtained in full compliance with the UCLA Divi-
sion of Laboratory Animal Medicine regulation and with the University of Cal-
ifornia, San Diego Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee regulations.
One million GBM39 cells were injected in the flank of each 4-week-old female
athymic mouse (Gini et al., 2013). Single drug treatments were as follows:
CC214-2 (oral gavage, 100 mg/kg, once every 2 days); dasatinib (oral gavage,
30 mg/kg, once every 2 days); U0126 (intraperitoneal injection, 25 mmol/kg,
once every 2 days). Mice were euthanized when tumors reached 15 mm diam-
eter. Combination drug treatments followed similar dosages and schedules.
MicroPET/CT Imaging
Four mice from each group were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% in 100% ox-
ygen), warmed, and injected with 20 mCi of 18F-FDG. After 60 min, mice were
placed in a chamber for both PET and computed tomography (CT) imaging.
Acquisition of PET images was performed for 10 min followed by 8 min of
CT acquisition.
IHC
IHC stains of paraffin-embedded GBM39 xenograft blocks were stained as
described by Mellinghoff et al. (2005). In the IHC quantification, the following
number of xenografts was considered for each group: n = 7 (control), n = 6
(CC214-2 responsive), n = 5 (CC214-2 resistant), n = 4 (dasatinib), n = 4
(U0126), n = 4 (U0126 plus dasatinib), n = 2 (each combination with
CC214-2), and n = 2 (each drug removed group).
Whole-Exome Sequencing Analysis
A range of 6–14 mg of gDNAs was extracted from the GBM39 xenografts
at control, responsive, and resistant stages using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit
(Qiagen). Whole-exome DNA was captured from total genomic DNA using
the SeqCap EZ System from NimbleGen according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Libraries were then sequenced with an average coverage
for each tumor R1003 on the NextSeq 500 platform from Illumina, using
100-bp pair-ended reads.
SNP and Gene Expression Analyses
Two controls and two CC214-2-resistant PDXs were used for DNA extractions,
using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini kit protocol; 500 ng of DNA from control and
resistant samples were analyzed by the SNP 6.0 Array (200 kb filter, 50 markers;
Affymetrix) attheClinical Microarray Core, UCLA. Gene expression analysiswas
performed at the same core by the Affymetrix U133plus2.0 array using 200 ng of
RNA extracted from the same two controls and two CC214-2-resistant xeno-
grafts used in the SNP screening (Qiagen micro RNA extraction kit).
Microchip Fabrication
SCBCs were fabricated as previously described (Wei et al., 2013). All DNA and
antibody reagents have been checked for cross-reactivity and are listed in
Supplemental Experimental Procedure.
Tumor Cell Sorting and Preparation for the SCBC Test
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from xenograft tumors or the patient
samples, using procedures described in Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures. For the xenografts, cell sorting was carried out with the Human EGFR
PlusCellect Kit from R&D systems (catalog #PLS1095) following the manufac-
turer’s protocol. For both types of tumor samples, cells were plated on a lam-
inin-coated Petri dish and incubated for 2 hr. Dead cells were removed via
aspiration and the live cells were subsequently transferred into the SCBCs.
Cell viability was >95% after employing the surface-plating step.
Protocols of Single-Cell Proteomic Assay
The antibody arrays within the SCBC were prepared immediately prior to use.
Cells were randomly loaded into the 310 microchambers of the SCBC. Each mi-
crochamber has an assay component and a separate reservoir of lysis buffer,
and was photographed after cell loading. The SCBC was then cooled on ice
for cell lysis. Following a 2-hr protein-capture period at room temperature, the
microchambers were flushed and the antibody arrays were developed using a
cocktail of detection antibodies. The developed antibody barcode arrays were
digitized by a Genepix scanner. Each array was matched with the micrograph
of that array for preparing a table that contains the microchamber address, the
numbers ofcells,andthemeasured fluorescencelevelsofeachassayedprotein.
In Vitro Assays of GBM39 Tumor Cells
GBM39 neurospheres were treated with therapy or therapy combinations for
24 hr, followed by immunoblotting of selected proteins (Figure S6A). EGFR+
cells from GBM39 neurospheres that were treated for 4 days with the same
therapies and therapy combinations were surface captured using the DEAL
technique (Bailey et al., 2007), followed by trypan blue staining and counting
the numbers of live and dead cells (Figure S6B). In parallel, all cells, regardless
of EGFR expression, were cultured in a 12-well plate under standard condi-
tions (Figure S6C). These cells were treated with the various therapies and
therapy combinations for 3 days, followed by trypan blue staining and counting
the numbers of live and dead cells (Figure S6D).
In Vitro Assay of the pcGBM2 Cell Line
pcGBM2 cells were grown in neurosphere culture. Neurospheres were disso-
ciated, and EGFR+ cells sorted using magnetic bead-based techniques

 following the protocols described above. One set of cells was treated with
lapatinib (2 mM) to establish the adapted cells. The other set was treated
with DMSO for 2 days. The culture medium was flushed, and both sets of cells
were treated for 2 days with 2 mM lapatinib. Cell viability and proliferation were
measured at each stage.
RIMChip 18F-FDG Assays
RIMChip 18F-FDG assays were carried out as previously described (Dooraghi
et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). EGFR+ pcGBM2 cells were treated with lapa-
tinib for 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hr and then loaded to the RIMChip (Figures S7B and
S7C). The level of the glucose uptake was normalized by cell number to yield a
quantitative comparison for all time points.
Mathematical Analysis and Statistical Methods
All p values for group comparisons were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and
Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction unless otherwise noted. PCA, AHC,
and PLS analyses were performed with XLSTAT (Addinsoft) (see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for details).
