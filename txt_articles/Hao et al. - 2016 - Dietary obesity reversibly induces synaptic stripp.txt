Abstract
Obesity increases risk of age-related cognitive decline and is accompanied by peripheral 
inflammation. Studies in rodent models of obesity have demonstrated that impaired hippocampal 
function correlates with microglial activation, but the possibility that neuron/microglia interactions 
might be perturbed in obesity has never been directly examined. The goal of this study was to 
determine whether high fat diet-induced obesity promotes synaptic stripping by microglia, and 
whether any potential changes might be reversible by a return to low-fat diet (LFD). Time course 
experiments revealed that hippocampal inflammatory cytokine induction and loss of synaptic 
protein expression were detectable after three months of HFD, therefore subsequent groups of 
mice were maintained on HFD for three months before being switched to LFD for an additional 
two months on LFD (HFD/LFD). Additional HFD mice continued to receive HFD during this 
period (HFD/HFD), while another group of mice were maintained on LFD throughout the 
experiment (LFD/LFD). Dietary obesity impaired hippocampus-dependent memory, reduced long-
term potentiation (LTP), and induced expression of the activation marker major histocompatibility 
complex II (MHCII) in hippocampal microglia. Diet reversal only partially attenuated increases in 
adiposity in HFD/LFD mice, but plasticity deficits and MHCII induction were normalized to 
within the range of LFD/LFD mice. Microglial activation and deficits in hippocampal function 
were accompanied by perturbation of spatial relationships between microglial processes and 
synaptic puncta. Analysis of primary microglia isolated from HFD/HFD mice revealed selective 
increases in internalization of synaptosomes labeled with a pH-sensitive fluorophore. Taken 
together, these findings indicate that dietary obesity reversibly impairs hippocampal function, and 
that deficits may be attributable to synaptic stripping by microglia.

 1. Introduction
Obesity is associated with chronic systemic inflammation and has also been shown to 
increase risk of age-related cognitive decline (Kanneganti and Dixit, 2012; Whitmer et al., 
2008; Xu et al., 2011). While the pathogenesis of metabolic comorbidities in obesity is well-
characterized, cellular mechanisms for cognitive impairment in obesity remain less so. 
Multiple reports indicate that that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity impairs cognitive 
function in rodent models (Molteni et al., 2002; Stranahan et al., 2008; McNay et al., 2010). 
Because hippocampal neurons exhibit early vulnerability during age-related cognitive 
impairment, studies of cognitive dysfunction in obesity have primarily focused on 
differences in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Parallel observations by multiple groups now 
support the idea that obesity-induced systemic inflammation is accompanied by 
inflammation in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus (Erion et al., 2014; 
Buckman et al., 2014; Sobesky et al., 2014).
Microglia are brain-resident phagocytes that continuously monitor the neuropil with motile 
processes for detection and clearance of cellular debris. In addition to removing dead cells 
and extracellular aggregates, microglia also internalize synaptic terminals (Kettenman et al., 
2013). Synaptic internalization by microglia is critical for developmental synaptic pruning 
(Paolicelli et al., 2011) and evidence from the visual cortex indicates that this process is 
activity-dependent (Tremblay et al., 2010). Microglia/neuron interactions are not limited to 
internalization or ‘stripping,’ as a number of signaling pathways that attract microglia to 
inactive synapses have now been identified (Stevens et al., 2007; Schafer et al., 2012). 
Microglia also influence plasticity through local release of neurotrophins at dendritic spines 
(Parkhurst et al., 2013), but the idea that synapse loss in obesity might be mediated by 
microglia has never been directly examined.
These studies were designed to determine whether interactions between microglia and 
neurons might be altered in dietary obesity. To answer this question, we used mice exposed 
to high-fat diet (HFD/HFD), low-fat diet (LFD/LFD), or HFD followed by LFD (HFD/
LFD). The duration of HFD applied prior to diet reversal was determined in time course 
experiments, which identified 3 months of HFD as the onset of inflammatory cytokine 
accumulation and loss of hippocampal synaptic proteins. Concurrent measures of adiposity 
and insulin resistance revealed that hippocampal inflammation and synaptic loss occurred 
after the development of obesity, but before the onset of diabetes. The diet reversal 
experiments revealed that a return to LFD normalizes hippocampus-dependent memory, 
long-term potentiation (LTP), and spatial relationships between microglia and hippocampal 
synapses. Experiments in primary microglia from LFD/LFD, HFD/HFD, and HFD/LFD 
mice identified selective, obesity-induced increases in microglial internalization of 
synaptosomes labeled with a pH-sensitive fluorophore. Taken together, these results indicate 
that obesity reversibly increases synaptic internalization by microglia, and implicate this 
process as a mechanism for impaired hippocampal function.

 2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and diets
Male C57Bl6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) at 5 
weeks of age. After one week acclimation, mice were housed one per cage, with high-fat 
diet chow (HFD; Research Diets 12492) or low-fat diet chow (LFD; Research Diets 12450J) 
and water available ad libitum (see Supplementary Table 1 for diet composition). For the 
time course experiments, (n=6–7) mice were maintained on HFD or LFD for one, two, or 
three months, with food intake measured on two successive days per week and body weights 
collected weekly. One week before euthanasia, mice were fasted overnight for analysis of 
glucose and insulin levels, as described (Dey et al., 2014). At sacrifice, the weights of the 
epididymal fat pads were collected as a measure of visceral adipose tissue and the inguinal 
depot was weighed as a measure of subcutaneous fat. Hippocampal protein extracts from 
mice exposed to different durations of HFD or LFD were collected to measure interleukin 1β 
(IL1β) protein and synaptic marker expression.
For diet reversal experiments, mice were maintained on HFD for three months before being 
switched to LFD chow for two months (HFD/LFD) or continued availability of HFD chow 
(HFD/HFD). Additional groups consumed LFD chow throughout all five months of the 
experiment (LFD/LFD). For immunofluorescence and stereology, (n=8) mice from each 
condition were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer 
(PFA). For analysis of long-term potentiation and dendritic spine density, (n=8–11) from 
each condition were rapidly decapitated under light Isoflurane anesthesia for preparation of 
acute slices (described below). Additional groups of (n=12) mice per condition were 
transcardially perfused with sterile saline for isolation of primary microglia by density 
gradient centrifugation, as described (Erion et al., 2014; Dey et al., 2014). All cohorts of 
mice generated for these experiments were used for behavioral tests of hippocampus-
dependent memory.
2.2. Behavioral testing
Groups of mice from each cohort were tested in the Y-maze and novel object preference 
tests. Testing in both paradigms was carried out between 1800 and 2200hr (lights-off at 
1800) under red light illumination, as described (Erion et al., 2014; Wosiski-Kuhn et al., 
2014). For Y-maze testing, mice were transferred from the home cage into a randomly 
selected start arm (length × width × height, cm: 20 × 6 × 10). Each alternation trial consisted 
of free exploration until a complete arm entry. After entering the choice arm, mice were 
confined to that arm by lowering a guillotine door during a 1-minute inter-trial interval 
before beginning the next trial. Each of the (6) alternation trials was captured on digital 
video and video clips were coded for offline analysis in a blinded manner. Correct choices 
were expressed relative to the total number of potential alternations and used for subsequent 
statistical analysis.
Novel object recognition testing involved 10min exposure to two identical objects, followed 
by 30min in the home cage, after which the mouse was returned to the arena in the presence 
of one novel and one familiar object. After 5min object exploration, the mouse returned to

 the home cage for 1.5hr before re-exposure to the familiar object and a different novel 
object. Test sessions were captured on video and analyzed offline at half speed by an 
observer blinded to the treatment conditions. The duration of each exploratory interval was 
recorded and expressed relative to the total amount of object exploration (novel + familiar) 
for each trial.
2.3. Hippocampal slice preparation and electrophysiology
Hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording followed previously published 
methods (Wosiski-Kuhn and Stranahan, 2012). In brief, 300μm slices were cut on a 
Vibratome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) into a bath of oxygenated artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). After 1hr recovery at 37C, extracellular recordings were 
performed in ACSF supplemented with 50μM picrotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
USA). Electrodes were positioned in the middle molecular layer superficial to the dentate 
gyrus and medial perforant path inputs were functionally identified by the presence of 
paired-pulse depression (PPD; Asztely et al., 2000). PPD magnitude was determined using 
interpulse intervals of 50, 200, 500, and 1000msec, and quantified by expressing the slope of 
the second (S2) field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) as a percent of the first 
fEPSP (S1). The baseline stimulation intensity was set at 50% of maximal fEPSP slope 
generated from the input/output curve. Stimuli were delivered at 0.05 Hz for baseline and 
post-tetanus recording and LTP was induced with a single train delivered at 100 Hz for 1 
second. Data were collected using pClamp version 10.3.4 and analyzed in Clampfit 
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
2.4. DiI labeling, dendrite imaging, and quantification of dendritic spine density
Juxtacellular labeling with the lipophilic membrane tracer 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-
tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed 
previously published methods (Wosiski-Kuhn et al., 2014). In brief, hippocampal slices 
were generated as described above, but instead of recording, slices were fixed in PFA for 
1hr and DiI crystals were placed in the dentate hilus inferior to the dentate granule cell layer. 
Following 48hr incubation at 37C, slices were counterstained with DAPI (1:1,000, Sigma-
Aldrich) and z-stack images of dendritic segments were acquired through an oil immersion 
objective (NA 1.4) on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope.
Dendritic segments were sampled from the secondary and tertiary dendrites of dentate gyrus 
granule neurons, as described (Erion et al., 2014; Wosiski-Kuhn et al., 2014). Full-resolution 
images of each plane were imported into Reconstruct (http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu) for 
spine counting and three-dimensional length measurement of each sampled segment. 
Segments were averaged on a per-cell basis, and the mean spine density across 5–7 cells 
from each animal was used for statistical analysis.
2.5. Immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereology
Peroxidase immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium binding adaptor protein 1 (IBA1) 
was carried out according to previously published methods (Dey et al., 2014). Briefly, a 1:6 
series of 40 μm sections was collected using a freezing microtome (Leica) and stored in 
cryoprotectant at −20C. Free-floating tissue sections were washed in phosphate buffered

 saline (PBS), quenched in 0.3%H2O2, blocked in 5% goat serum, and incubated overnight 
in PBS containing 0.25% Tween-20 and rabbit anti-IBA1 (Wako Diagnostics). The next 
day, sections were rinsed, then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit, and rinsed again 
before avidin-biotin amplification and detection with diaminobenzadine (Vector Labs, 
Burlingame, CA). Slides were dried and counterstained with Methyl Green (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) before dehydration, clearing, and coverslipping under Permount. 
Stereological cell counts based on the optical fractionator were carried out using 
StereoInvestigator software (Microbrightfield, VT, USA). IBA1-positive cells in the dentate 
gyrus were counted using systematic random sampling, with an XY step size of 300 μm and 
a counting frame measuring 50 μm on each side (height =10 μm). Separate markers were 
used for microglia with 1 or 2 primary processes (‘Simple’) or microglia with 3 or more 
processes (‘Complex’). Anatomical criteria for Simple and Complex microglia were based 
on internal validation of previous reports demonstrating that hippocampal microglia in 
sections from unstimulated mice have an average of 3.9±0.8 primary processes (Giovanoli et 
al., 2013). The results reported by Giovanoli et al (2013) were internally validated by 
manually reconstructing IBA1+ cells in the dentate molecular layer of LFD mice used in the 
current study, which revealed similar results (n primary processes; mean±sem: 4.3±0.9). All 
counts were performed blind on coded slides and the code was not broken until completion 
of the stereology experiments.
2.6. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Double-labeling immunofluorescence for IBA1 and major histocompatibility complex II 
(MHCII), a marker of classical activation, took place as described (Erion et al., 2014). In 
brief, free-floating sections were quenched in 1% sodium borohydride in tris-buffered saline 
(TBS), blocked in normal sera, and incubated with primary antibodies against IBA1 
(1:1,000, Wako) and MHCII (1:500, Abd Serotec) diluted in TBS with 0.1% Triton-X 100. 
The following day, sections were washed in TBS, then reacted with fluorophore-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) before being mounted on slides. After 
drying, slides were counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped for confocal imaging using a 
63x objective on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. Image stacks containing 
IBA1-positive microglia with 1 or 2 primary processes (‘Simple’) or microglia with 3 or 
more processes (‘Complex’) were acquired throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate 
molecular layer. The proportion of IBA1/MHCII double-positive cells (‘Simple’ or 
‘Complex’) was expressed relative to the total number of simple or complex IBA1-positive 
cells. Immunohistochemical controls included omission of primary and secondary antibodies 
and routinely revealed no detectable fluorescence in tissue sections.
Immunofluorescence was also used to detect IBA1 and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) for 
analysis of spatial relationships between microglial processes and synaptic puncta. The 
immunofluorescence procedure used the same polyclonal antibody to IBA1 (1:1,000, Wako) 
and a monoclonal antibody against PSD95 (1:500, Pierce Thermo Fisher). Bound primary 
antibodies were visualized using fluorescent secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and nuclei 
were counterstained with DAPI. Image stacks were captured from the dentate molecular 
layer at 1024×1024 pixel density (0.1μm step size) using a 100x oil immersion objective

 (NA 1.4). The pinhole diameter was reduced to 420.42nm to maximize resolution and 
IBA1+ processes were sampled at least 25μm from the cell body.
Multichannel Sholl analysis was used to examine spatial relationships between PSD95+ 
puncta and IBA1+ microglial processes. Three-dimensional centroid coordinates for IBA1+ 
processes were determined automatically using an ImageJ plugin, as described (Bolte et al., 
2006), and numbers of PSD95+ puncta were quantified at progressively increasing spherical 
diameters around the centroid coordinates. To generate a measure of proximity that would 
not reflect overall reductions in PSD95 labeling, the number of PSD95+ intersections for 
each sphere was normalized to the number of intersections at the smallest spherical shell 
diameter. The normalized number of PSD95+ intersections at progressively increasing 
distances around IBA1+ processes were generated from >400 processes sampled from 12–
16 fields in each mouse, and the slope of this relationship was averaged on a per-animal 
basis for statistical comparisons.
2.7. Western blotting and ELISA
Protein extraction and quantification of total protein by Bradford assay took place as 
described (Wosiski-Kuhn et al., 2014). In brief, hippocampal protein extracts (20μg) were 
loaded and separated through gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose 
membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and probed with antibodies against spinophilin 
(Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), PSD95 (Pierce Thermo Fisher), synaptophysin (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), TATA-binding protein (TBP; Cell Signaling Technologies, 
Danvers, MA, USA), or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Primary antibodies 
were applied at 1:1,000 overnight with shaking at 4C and detected with HRP-conjugated 
secondaries against the appropriate species. Bands were visualized on a chemiluminescence 
imager and band intensities were quantified in ImageJ. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
was used to quantify interleukin 1β in hippocampal protein extracts according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and as described (Dey et al., 
2014; Erion et al., 2014).
2.8. Synaptosome preparation and pHrodo incorporation
Purified synaptosomes were separated by ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous isoosmotic 
Percoll gradient. Methods for synaptosome isolation were based on previously published 
protocols (Dunkley et al., 2008; Meffert et al., 1994). Mice were terminally anesthetized 
with Isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 25mL sterile saline for 3min before 
forebrain extraction and homogenization of individual hemispheres in a Tenbroeck 
homogenizer containing 5mL Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) supplemented 
with 0.2% d-glucose. Homogenized cell suspensions were filtered through a 40-micron 
strainer (BD Bioscience) and the flow-through was centrifuged at 1,000xg for 10min to 
pellet cells. The pellet (P1) was either lysed for westerns or fixed for electron microscopy, 
and the supernatant (S1) was layered on top of the Percoll gradient in preparation for 
ultracentrifugation. For some experiments, aliquots of supernatant were lysed for western 
blotting or fixed for electron microscopy; for others, a portion of the S1 was reserved for 
incorporation of the pH-sensitive fluorophore pHrodo Green (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA).

 Density gradients were separated at 28,000xg for 5min at 4C with no brake on a Beckman-
Coulter ultracentrifuge equipped with a fixed-angle TY65 rotor. The 23%/10% interface 
containing purified synaptosomes was collected and transferred to a fresh tube containing 
dPBS with 0.2% d-glucose. After inversion, resuspended synaptosomes were pelleted by 
ultracentrifugation at 28,000xg for 10min with full brake and used for western blotting, 
electron microscopy, or pHrodo incorporation (see below).
The relative enrichment of synaptic and nuclear markers was determined by western blotting 
of purified synaptosomes and S1 or P1 fractions. Protein separation, transfer, and 
quantification of each fraction followed the same methods described above for brain tissue 
lysates. Fractions used for electron microscopy were resuspended in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 
0.1M cacodylate buffer containing 2mM Ca2+. After fixation, fractions were pelleted and 
washed with cacodylate buffer before dehydration and en bloc staining with 2% uranyl 
acetate. After further dehydration in 70, 95, and 100% ethanol, samples were embedded in 
Epon-Araldite resin and cured for 2 days at 60C in preparation for ultrathin sectioning 
(75nm). Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife on a Leica EM UC6 
ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Inc, Bannockburn, IL), collected on copper grids and 
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before imaging on a JEM 1230 transmission 
electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA), as described (Wosiski-Kuhn et al., 
2014).
For fluorophore incorporation, purified synaptosomes or S1 fractions were incubated with 
pHrodo Green STP ester, as described (Schafer et al., 2012), with modifications. 
Specifically, aliquots from each fraction were rapidly lysed and used to determine protein 
content by Bradford assay. Appropriate volumes of S1 and purified synaptosomes were 
resuspended at 20mg/mL in 100mM carbonate buffer (pH=9.0). pHrodo Green in DMSO 
was added at a final concentration of 8.9mM and fractions were incubated for 1hr at room 
temperature with gentle agitation. Samples were washed through 3 rounds of centrifugation 
(5min, 15,000xg, 4C) in carbonate buffer, with the final resuspension made in dPBS 
containing 5%DMSO. Fractions were stored in dPBS+DMSO at −80C in preparation for 
experiments in primary microglia.
2.9. Primary microglia isolation and analysis of phagocytosis
Primary microglia were isolated from HFD/HFD, HFD/LFD, and LFD/LFD mice according 
to previously published protocols (Erion et al., 2014; Dey et al., 2014). In brief, animals 
were transcardially perfused with saline as described above for synaptosome preparation, 
with preparation of cell suspensions using identical methodology. After the initial round of 
centrifugation, forebrain mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a 
discontinuous gradient of isoosmotic Percoll. The 70%/30% interface was collected and 
washed in 1xdPBS before determination of yield and viability using a Scepter automated 
counting instrument (Millipore), as described (Dey et al., 2014).
Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from a subset of animals used for preparation of 
primary microglia. The isolation procedure did not require thioglycollate stimulation and 
involved peritoneal lavage with dPBS containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum 
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). Cells collected by lavage were pelleted by 10min centrifugation at 
Hao et al.

 1,000xg and counted using methods described above for microglia. Both cell types were 
plated at 100,000 cells/well in serum-free DMEM for phagocytosis assays. pHrodo-
conjugated e.coli particles were applied at 1mg/mL in 1X dPBS (pH=7.4). pHrodo-
conjugated synaptosomes and S1 fractions were thawed to 37C in dPBS+DMSO and applied 
at 20mg/mL. Cells were exposed to pHrodo-conjugated stimuli for 2hr at 37C under 5% 
CO2 before being washed in dPBS and read in a fluorescent plate reader (Biotek 
Instruments, VT, USA). Fluorescence intensities were normalized to the average intensity 
detected in control wells from each animal. Control wells were run in duplicate and 
contained either pHrodo-conjugated stimuli with no plated cells, or plated cells not exposed 
to pHrodo-conjugated stimuli.
In a subset of these experiments, primary microglia were plated on 35mm dishes with 
embedded coverslips for visualization of internalized pHrodo-conjugated e.coli particles 
(Invitrogen, Temecula, CA, USA). For this subset, cells were fixed for 30min in 2% 
paraformaldehyde before staining with rabbit anti-IBA1 (Wako) and Alexa 568 anti-rabbit 
(Invitrogen), followed by counterstaining with DAPI for multiphoton imaging on a Zeiss 
780 inverted confocal microscope.
2.10. Statistics
Body weights and food intake data were compared across conditions using one-way 
repeated measures ANOVA. Dendritic spine densities and western blot endpoints were 
analyzed using one-way ANOVA, as were the electrophysiological data and data from the 
phagocytosis assays. Stereological counts of hippocampal microglia and colabeling with 
activation markers were also analyzed with one-way ANOVA. For analysis of spatial 
relationships between microglial processes and synaptic puncta, per-animal slopes for the 
normalized number of PSD95+ intersections at progressively increasing distances around 
IBA1+ processes were generated using nonlinear regression, and slopes were compared 
across conditions using one-way ANOVA as described above. Analysis by ANOVA was 
followed by post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected t-tests, with p<0.05 as the 
threshold for statistical significance. Analyses were carried out in Graphpad Prism version 
5.0 (La Jolla, CA).
3. Results
3.1. Time course for obesity, neuroinflammation, and hippocampal synaptic deficits
We initially performed time course experiments to determine the onset of hippocampal 
inflammation and synaptic loss relative to obesity and diabetes. Male C57Bl6J mice were 
maintained on high-fat diet (HFD) chow or low-fat diet (LFD) chow for one, two, or three 
months, beginning at six weeks of age (see Supplementary Table 1 for diet composition). 
Increases in body weight were detected in HFD mice at all time points examined 
(F1,18=10.85, p<0.01; Supplementary Figure 1A). At sacrifice, the visceral and 
subcutaneous fat pads were dissected to examine adipose tissue distribution. The relative 
weight of the visceral fat pads increased in a time-dependent manner (F1,18=8.11, p<0.01; 
Supplementary Figure 1B), while the subcutaneous fat pads exhibited similar hypertrophy at 
all time points (F1,18=7.13, p<0.01, Supplementary Figure 1C). HFD mice reduced the

 amount of food eaten and were isocaloric with LFD mice throughout the experiment 
(F1,18=0.24, ns; Supplementary Figure 1D), and there were no significant changes in fasting 
glucose (F1,18=1.52, ns; Supplementary Figure 1E) or insulin (F1,18=1.91, ns, 
Supplementary Figure 1F). These observations indicate that these durations of HFD 
consumption elicit obesity prior to the onset of diabetes symptoms.
We next quantified interleukin 1β (IL1β) protein in hippocampal homogenates from mice 
exposed to different durations of HFD. Three months of HFD significantly increased 
hippocampal IL1β (F1,18=7.98, p<0.05; Supplementary Figure 2A), with no effect of HFD at 
earlier time points. These samples were also used to examine hippocampal synaptic protein 
expression. Western blotting for the postsynaptic marker PSD95 and the presynaptic marker 
synaptophysin revealed that expression of both markers was reduced after 3 months on HFD 
(for PSD95, F1,18=3.84, p<0.05; for synaptophysin, F1,18=5.13, p<0.05; Supplementary 
Figure 2B–D). Because three months of HFD increased hippocampal IL1β and reduced 
expression of synaptic proteins, this duration of HFD was selected for subsequent diet 
reversal experiments.
3.2. Body weight and adiposity after a switch from high-fat to low-fat feeding
We next examined the effects of switching mice from HFD to LFD on body weight, food 
intake, and adiposity. Six-week-old mice were maintained on LFD or HFD for three months, 
then half of the HFD mice were switched to LFD chow for an additional two months before 
sacrifice (HFD/LFD). The switch to LFD chow was associated with gradual reductions in 
body weight in HFD/LFD mice (F2,21=9.88, p<0.01; Figure 1A), which occurred 
independently of changes in overall caloric intake (F2,21=0.24, ns; Figure 1B). Examination 
of adipose tissue distribution revealed that diet reversal reduces visceral and subcutaneous 
adiposity relative to mice that continued to consume HFD throughout the experiment (for 
visceral fat, F2,21=8.62, p<0.01; for subcutaneous fat, F2,21=6.99, p<0.05). However, the 
proportional weight of both visceral and subcutaneous fat after the switch is still 
significantly greater than LFD/LFD mice (post hoc t-tests with Bonferroni’s correction: 
visceral fat, t13=12.68, p<0.01; subcutaneous fat t13=7.94, p<0.01; Figure 1C). In these 
respects, the return to LFD feeding attenuates but does not reverse the physiological 
consequences of long-term HFD consumption.
3.3. High-fat diet consumption reversibly activates hippocampal microglia
Microglia respond to inflammation by retracting their processes and expressing classical 
activation markers (Prinz and Priller, 2014). We used unbiased stereology to examine 
changes in microglial number and morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of HFD/
HFD, HFD/LFD, or LFD/LFD mice. Microglia were visualized using antibodies against 
IBA1 and anatomically ‘simple’ microglia with 1–2 primary processes were quantified 
separately from ‘complex’ microglia bearing ≥3 primary processes. HFD/HFD mice had 
significantly more anatomically simple IBA1+ cells in the dentate molecular layer and 
granule cell layer, relative to both LFD/LFD and HFD/LFD mice (F2,18=4.47, p<0.05; 
Figure 2A–B). There were no changes in the number of complex microglia (F2,18=0.62, ns), 
and while there was a trend towards increased total IBA1+ cell number in HFD mice, this

 did not reach statistical significance (mean±sem, n=6–8; LFD/LFD=19,152±2,416; HFD/
HFD=24,013±2,598; HFD/LFD=21,328±3,409).
We examined cellular activation in simple and complex microglia using co-labeling for 
IBA1 and major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII). Positive staining for MHCII was 
minimal on hippocampal sections from LFD/LFD mice, but simple microglia from 
HFD/HFD mice showed significant increases in MHCII expression (F2,18=8.57, p<0.01; 
Figure 2C). MHCII induction was not observed in HFD/LFD mice (Figure 2D), indicating 
that obesity reversibly activates anatomically simple microglia in the hippocampal dentate 
gyrus.
3.4. Diet reversal normalizes synaptic plasticity and cognition
To determine whether reductions in microglial activation with diet reversal were 
accompanied by reinstatement of hippocampal plasticity, we recorded long-term 
potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices from LFD/LFD, HFD/HFD, or HFD/LFD mice. 
Recordings were made at medial perforant path (mPP) inputs to the hippocampal dentate 
gyrus, which were identified anatomically by their location in the middle molecular layer, 
and functionally by the presence of presynaptic paired-pulse depression (PPD; Asztely et al., 
2000). Analysis of the input-output ratio revealed no differences between experimental 
groups (F2,22=0.24, ns; Figure 3A), and PPD magnitude was unchanged (F2,22=0.68, ns; 
Figure 3B). However, slices from HFD/HFD mice exhibit reduced LTP relative to slices 
from LFD/LFD mice (F2,22=8.51, p<0.01; Figure 3C). LTP deficits were not detected in 
HFD/LFD mice, which were indistinguishable from LFD/LFD slices (post hoc t-tests with 
Bonferroni’s correction: t15=0.48, ns; Figure 3C). These results indicate that dietary obesity 
reversibly impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and implicate postsynaptic changes as a 
mechanism for HFD-induced deficits.
To examine the behavioral consequences of impaired synaptic plasticity, we analyzed 
hippocampus-dependent memory in LFD/LFD, HFD/HFD, and HFD/LFD mice. Spatial 
recognition memory was significantly impaired in HFD/HFD mice, based on reduced 
alternation during testing in the Y-maze (F2,24=9.81, p<0.01; Figure 3D). Deficits in spatial 
memory were not observed in HFD/LFD mice, which performed similarly to LFD/LFD 
mice (post hoc t-tests with Bonferroni’s correction: t15=1.14, ns; Figure 3D). Mice were also 
tested in the novel object recognition paradigm, where HFD/HFD mice showed less 
preference for the novel object at all post-training intervals (F2,24=6.23, p<0.05; Figure 3E). 
Diet reversal normalized object recognition, based on comparable preference for the novel 
object in HFD/LFD and LFD/LFD mice (post hoc t-tests with Bonferroni’s correction: 
t15=0.37, ns; Figure 3E). All experimental groups spent similar total time exploring the 
objects (novel+familiar), indicating that changes in novel object preference are not 
explained by differences in motivation (Figure 3F). Taken together, these behavioral results 
suggest that dietary obesity induces memory deficits that are reversible following a return to 
LFD.

 3.5. Dietary obesity perturbs spatial relationships between microglia and synapses
We next examined hippocampal structural plasticity by quantifying dendritic spine density 
using juxtacellular labeling with the lipophilic membrane tracer DiI. This experiment 
revealed significant reductions in dendritic spine density in HFD/HFD mice, relative to 
LFD/LFD mice (F2,21=9.76, p<0.01; Figure 4A–B). There were no differences in dendritic 
spine density between LFD/LFD and HFD/LFD mice (post hoc t-tests with Bonferroni’s 
correction: t16=0.55, ns; Figure 4B), indicating that reinstatement of synaptic function was 
accompanied by reversal of synaptic loss. Western blotting for pre- and postsynaptic 
proteins revealed that HFD/HFD significantly reduced expression of the presynaptic protein 
synaptophysin (F2,19=6.56, p<0.05), the postsynaptic protein PSD95 (F2,19=5.24, p<0.05) 
and the scaffolding protein spinophilin in hippocampal homogenates (F2,19=7.31, p<0.05; 
Figure 4C–D). Reductions in synaptic protein expression were not present in HFD/LFD 
mice (post hoc t-tests with Bonferroni’s correction: for synaptophysin, t11=0.36, ns; for 
PSD95, t11=0.85, ns; for spinophilin, t11=0.53, ns; Figure 4D). These results provide 
anatomical and cellular evidence for hippocampal synaptic loss in obesity.
To examine spatial relationships between microglial processes and hippocampal synapses, 
PSD95-labeled puncta and IBA1-positive processes were visualized in the dentate molecular 
layer. Multichannel Sholl analysis was used to examine spatial proximity of PSD95+ puncta 
around IBA1+ microglial processes. Three-dimensional centroid coordinates for IBA1+ 
processes were determined automatically using an ImageJ plugin, as described (Bolte et al., 
2006), and numbers of PSD95+ puncta were quantified at progressively increasing spherical 
diameters around the centroid coordinates.
Single-channel analysis of PSD95 labeling revealed that HFD/HFD reduces the area covered 
by PSD95+ puncta (F2,19=7.10, p<0.05; Figure 4E–F). To generate a measure of proximity 
that would not reflect overall reductions in PSD95 labeling in HFD/HFD mice, the number 
of PSD95+ intersections for each sphere was normalized to the smallest spherical shell 
diameter. This approach revealed that synaptic density is significantly higher in the 
immediate vicinity of microglial processes in LFD/LFD mice, based on decreasing numbers 
of intersections with PSD95 puncta at greater spatial distances from IBA1 centroid 
coordinates (Figure 4G; nonlinear fit of normalized intersections around IBA1 centroid in 
LFD/LFD mice: r2=0.79, p<0.01). Interestingly, the positive correlation between IBA1 
process proximity and PSD95 puncta is lost in HFD/HFD mice (nonlinear fit of normalized 
intersections around IBA1 centroid in HFD/HFD mice: r2=0.13, ns). HFD/LFD mice, by 
contrast, exhibit the same spatial relationship between synaptic puncta and microglial 
processes observed in LFD/LFD mice (nonlinear fit of normalized intersections around 
IBA1 centroid in HFD/LFD mice: r2=0.73, p<0.01). This anatomical pattern suggests that 
the spatial organization of microglial processes around hippocampal synapses may be 
disturbed in dietary obesity, and this was upheld by statistical comparison of group 
differences (F2,19=4.53, p<0.05).
3.6. Dietary obesity promotes synaptic stripping by microglia
Microglia internalize synapses during activity-dependent plasticity in the developing brain 
(Tremblay et al., 2010), but synaptic phagocytosis by microglia has never been examined in

 any model of obesity. We prepared synaptosomes for in vitro analysis of synaptic stripping 
and initially validated the purity of this preparation using western blotting and electron 
microscopy. Isolated synaptosomes were enriched with PSD95 and synaptophysin (Figure 
5A). These synaptic proteins were diluted in the S1 fraction and were absent in the pellet 
(P1), which was the only fraction that contained detectable levels of the nuclear protein TBP 
(Figure 5A). At the ultrastructural level, purified synaptosomes contained intact pre- and 
post-synaptic terminals that were frequently observed in apposition to one another (Figure 
5B). The S1 fraction contained some presynaptic structures, but also contained other 
organelles, including golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 5B). The P1 
fraction was made up of intact nuclei packed with electron-dense chromatin (Figure 5B). 
These validation assays demonstrate that purified synaptosomes and the S1 fraction used in 
subsequent experiments differ in their composition, with significantly greater enrichment of 
synaptic terminals in the purified preparation.
Primary microglia and peritoneal macrophages from HFD/HFD, HFD/LFD, and LFD/LFD 
mice were subsequently stimulated with e.coli bacteria conjugated to the pH-sensitive 
fluorophore pHrodo Green. Primary microglia rapidly internalize pHrodo-conjugated e.coli 
based on multiphoton visualization of fixed cells (Figure 5C). The uptake of pHrodo-
conjugated e.coli was also detectable in plated cells based on fluorometric quantification, 
which revealed that phagocytosis is more robust in peritoneal macrophages than in primary 
microglia (Figure 5D; F2,22=14.70, p<0.01). There was no effect of HFD or diet reversal on 
e.coli internalization in either cell type, suggesting that responses to bacterial pathogens are 
unaffected by dietary manipulation (Figure 5D).
We next prepared pHrodo-conjugated synaptosomes and S1 fractions to determine whether 
obesity might influence microglial internalization of synaptic terminals, and whether any 
potential differences were selective for synapses. Primary microglia from all three groups of 
mice showed significant uptake of both fractions, based on increased fluorescence intensity 
relative to unstimulated control wells. However, wells containing HFD/HFD microglia had 
significantly higher fluorescence intensities after stimulation with synaptosomes, relative to 
cells from LFD/LFD mice, and relative to cells from HFD/LFD mice (Figure 5D; 
F2,22=4.21, p<0.05). There were no differences in the uptake of pHrodo-labeled S1 
fractions, suggesting that there is some degree of selectivity in the effects of obesity on 
microglial phagocytosis (Figure 5D).
4. Discussion
These studies demonstrate that obesity reversibly increases synaptic internalization by 
microglia. Normal weight mice exhibit minimal overlap between microglia and synaptic 
markers, but microglial processes were frequently observed in close apposition to clusters of 
synaptic puncta. Partial attenuation of obesity with diet reversal completely normalized 
hippocampal function and reinstated spatial relationships between microglia and 
hippocampal synapses. Dietary obesity increased microglial internalization of purified 
synaptosomes, but did not alter the uptake of mixed intracellular structures or e.coli bacteria. 
Take together, these results demonstrate that obesity disturbs microglia/neuron interactions, 
and implicate synaptic stripping as a potential mechanism for hippocampal dysfunction.

 Microglial internalization of synaptic contacts contributes to developmental pruning and 
regulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult brain (Paolicelli et al, 2011; 
Schafer et al, 2012). We recently demonstrated that obesity promotes the expression of 
classical activation markers in hippocampal microglia from mice with genetic obesity due to 
leptin receptor mutation (db/db mice; Erion et al, 2014). However, ‘activation’ is not always 
accompanied by increases in phagocytosis (Siskova et al., 2009), and criteria used to define 
microglial ‘activation’ varies considerably across studies. Classical activation can be defined 
using changes in cell-surface antigen expression and reductions in anatomical complexity 
(Prinz and Priller, 2014), but microglia continually transition between an activated and 
quiescent phenotype depending on environmental conditions (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 
2007). The current study used structural criteria for analysis of MHCII in IBA1+ cells with 
high or low anatomical complexity. This approach revealed that dietary obesity promotes 
MHCII expression in morphologically simple microglia, and that diet reversal eliminates 
both cellular and anatomical activation of IBA1+ cells. Because these static measurements 
do not capture ongoing structural plasticity, future studies will be required to determine 
whether and how obesity influences chemoattraction and microglial outgrowth.
Diet reversal reduced body weight, but overall adiposity remained higher than lean controls. 
Although increases in adiposity were only partially attenuated, deficits in hippocampal 
plasticity and perturbation of microglia/neuron relationships were completely normalized to 
within the range of LFD animals. This pattern implies that relationships between adiposity 
and neuroinflammation in dietary obesity are not simply a linear function of total adiposity 
or adiposity in the visceral compartment, as observed in genetic obesity (Erion et al., 2014). 
While visceral adipose tissue is uniformly made up of white adipocytes, subcutaneous 
adipose tissue contains both white adipocytes and ‘beige’ adipocytes, which promote energy 
expenditure in a manner analogous to brown adipose tissue (Spiegelman and Rosen, 2014). 
Although visceral fat is the primary source of peripheral inflammation in obesity, genetic 
ablation of beige adipocytes increases inflammation in subcutaneous fat to levels typically 
observed in the visceral compartment (Cohen et al., 2014). It is tempting to speculate that 
reversal of microglial activation after a return to LFD might be attributable to reinstatement 
of the beige adipocyte population, but at present there are no data to support or refute this 
hypothesis.
The current study used antibodies against ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1 (IBA1) 
to label microglia, but IBA1 is also expressed by peripheral macrophages (Prinz and Priller, 
2014). In a recent report, Buckman et al. (2014) demonstrated infiltration of bone marrow-
derived macrophages into the brains of obese mice. This raises the possibility that IBA1-
labeled cells in this report may represent a mixed population of infiltrating macrophages and 
resident microglia. While this possibility cannot presently be excluded, observations from 
this dataset suggest that this is not the case. Specifically, the total number of IBA1-positive 
cells determined using unbiased stereology in these experiments was not significantly 
different between diet conditions. If infiltrating macrophages were present, this would 
increase total IBA1-positive cell numbers, assuming that there was no concurrent cell death 
among resident microglia in HFD mice. Because we observed increases in anatomically 
simple microglia without any significant change in total microglial number, we interpret this 
result as indirect evidence for minimal macrophage infiltration in the hippocampus. This

 interpretation is not inconsistent with the results of Buckman et al. (2014), which reported 
macrophage infiltration in dissociated forebrains from HFD mice. Regional heterogeneity in 
macrophage infiltration of different brain regions with obesity is highly likely and will be an 
interesting question to resolve in future studies.
Converging evidence from animal models and human studies indicates that obesity alters 
neuronal function in brain regions outside of canonical metabolic circuits. While there is 
some variability in cognitive outcomes reported in human studies of obesity (Fotuhi et al., 
2012), this is likely attributable to the insufficiency of body mass index (BMI) criteria used 
to define obesity in humans. Weight/height relationships defined by BMI do not reflect body 
fat distribution, which is a better predictor of cognitive risk (Whitmer et al., 2008). In 
longitudinal and twin studies, visceral adiposity predicts risk of cognitive decline, but 
preferential deposition of subcutaneous fat is not associated with age-related cognitive 
impairment and dementia (Whitmer et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2011). The same pattern is 
detected in human studies of obesity-induced inflammation, where visceral adiposity 
increases levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, but subcutaneous adiposity does 
not increase systemic markers of inflammation (Chawla et al., 2011; Kanneganti and Dixit, 
2012). These findings in humans support the concept of depot-specific effects of adipose 
tissue on peripheral inflammation and cognitive risk, and data from animal models 
underscores the complexity of this relationship by identifying distinct consequences of 
white, beige, and brown adipose tissue for metabolism and potentially, for cognition (Cohen 
et al., 2014; Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014). The assumption of a linear inverse relationship 
between body weight and cognition is oversimplified and contributes to pre-existing biases 
against overweight individuals, and caution against over-interpretation is warranted in 
clinical and animal model studies. The observations observed in this report indicate that 
microglial internalization of synapses occurs in a reversible manner with dietary obesity, and 
further investigation into this process may lead to strategies for preventing age-related 
cognitive impairment in at-risk populations.

 Figure 1. Changes in body weight, food intake, and adiposity after switching from high-fat to 
low-fat diet
(A), Male C57Bl6J mice maintained on a 60% fat diet (HFD) gain weight rapidly, but when 
switched to a low-fat diet (HFD/LFD), their weight gradually declines until it is comparable 
with mice never been exposed to HFD feeding (LFD). Shaded area represents the duration 
of diet reversal (weeks 12–20). (B), Mice on HFD chow reduce the amount of food eaten 
and are isocaloric with LFD mice. (C), Overconsumption of calories from fat increases the 
proportional weight of adipose tissue in the subcutaneous and visceral depots. Adipose 
tissue hypertrophy is attenuated but not reversed in HFD/LFD mice. For all graphs, error 
bars represent the s.e.m., and asterisks (*) denote significant differences between HFD/HFD 
and LFD/LFD mice. Pound signs (#) indicate differences between HFD/HFD and HFD/LFD

 Figure 2. High-fat diet consumption reversibly activates hippocampal microglia
(A), Stereological quantification of microglia in the hippocampal dentate gyrus reveals that 
mice consuming high-fat diet throughout the experiment (HFD/HFD) have significantly 
more microglia with 1–2 primary processes (‘Simple’). By contrast, mice exposed to 3 
months of HFD, then switched to low-fat diet (LFD) chow for 2 months (HFD/LFD) have 
fewer simple microglia than HFD/HFD mice. There was no effect of HFD or diet reversal 
on microglia with 3 or more primary processes (‘Complex’). (B), Micrographs depict 
peroxidase immunolabeling for the microglial marker ionized calcium binding adapter 
protein 1 (IBA1) on hippocampal sections from mice in the indicated conditions. Higher 
magnification panels show Simple and Complex microglia from mice in each condition. For 
low magnification images, scalebar=100μm. For high magnification panels, scalebar=10μm. 
(C), Expression of the classical activation marker major histocompatibility complex II 
(MHCII) is sparse in IBA1+ cells from LFD/LFD and HFD/LFD mice, regardless of their 
morphology, but HFD/HFD mice exhibit robust induction of MHCII in anatomically simple 
microglia. (D), Confocal micrographs of IBA1/MHCII fluorescence, with DAPI nuclear 
counterstain. Scalebar=5μm. For all graphs, error bars represent the s.e.m. and asterisks (*) 
denote statistical significance at p<0.05 following one-way ANOVA with post hoc 
Bonferroni-correct t-tests.

 Figure 3. Diet reversal rescues synaptic plasticity and cognition
(A), Dietary obesity and diet reversal do not influence the input/output ratio, derived from 
the amplitude of the presynaptic fiber volley (FV) and the slope of the dendritic field 
excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP). (B), Presynaptic paired-pulse plasticity is 
unaffected by HFD or diet reversal. (C), Dietary obesity impairs dentate gyrus long-term 
potentiation (LTP), but HFD/LFD mice exhibit LTP that is identical to LFD/LFD mice. Bar 
graph (right) depicts percent change in fEPSP slope during minutes 50–60 of recording. (D), 
HFD impairs spatial recognition memory, based on reduced alternation in the Y-maze. 
HFD/LFD mice alternate at rates that are similar to LFD/LFD mice, consistent with 
reinstatement of spatial recognition memory with diet reversal. (E), Dietary obesity impairs 
object recognition, based on the lack of preference for a novel object over a familiar one in 
HFD/HFD mice. Preference for the novel object is normalized in HFD/LFD mice, which 
perform on par with LFD/LFD mice at 0.5 and 2.0hr after initial object exposure. (F), The 
total amount of exploration (novel + familiar) as a proportion of test session duration was 
unaffected by HFD or diet reversal. For all graphs, error bars represent the sem and asterisks 
(*) denote statistical significance at p<0.05 following one-way ANOVA with post hoc 
Bonferroni-corrected t-tests.

 Figure 4. Perturbation of spatial relationships between hippocampal synapses and microglia 
coincides with obesity-induced reductions in dendritic spines and synaptic marker expression
(A), Low-magnification confocal micrograph shows a dentate granule cell labeled with DiI 
(green) and counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scalebar=50μm. High magnification panels 
(right) depict dendritic segments from mice in each condition. Scalebar=10μm. (B), High-fat 
diet (HFD/HFD) reduces dendritic spine density relative to low-fat diet (LFD/LFD) mice, 
but deficits are not present among dentate granule neurons from mice exposed to diet 
reversal (HFD/LFD). Bar graphs depict the group mean and scatterplots show data from 
individual animals (average of 5–7 cells per animal). (C), Western blot membranes depict 
representative band intensities for the postsynaptic markers spinophilin and PSD95, and the 
presynaptic marker synaptophysin. (D), Dietary obesity reversibly impairs hippocampal 
synaptic protein expression. (E), Low-magnification micrograph shows immunofluorescence 
labeling for the microglial marker IBA1 and the synaptic marker PSD95. High-
magnification single-channel images (right) depict punctate staining for PSD95 in the 
dentate molecular layer. (F), HFD/HFD mice exhibit reduced total area of PSD95 labeling, 
but HFD/LFD mice exhibit similar staining area relative to LFD/LFD mice. (G), Schematic 
shows flattened depiction of multichannel Sholl analysis. PSD95+ intersections were 
quantified in concentric spheres (0.1μm radius) around IBA1-labeled processes and were 
expressed relative to the number of intersections in the initial spherical shell to eliminate the

 confound of reduced overall PSD95 labeling in HFD/HFD mice. Graph (right) demonstrates 
non-random organization of PSD95 puncta around IBA1+ processes, based on progressively 
decreasing PSD95+ puncta at greater distances from microglial processes in LFD/LFD mice. 
While this relationship is detectable in HFD/HFD mice, the slope is significantly reduced 
based on comparative nonlinear regression analysis. Diet reversal normalizes spatial 
relationships between microglial processes and synaptic puncta, indicated by similar 
statistical methods of comparison described above. For all graphs, error bars represent the 
sem. For graphs in (A–F), asterisks (*) denote statistical significance at p<0.05 following 
one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. For graph in (G), asterisk 
indicates statistical significance determined by generating per-animal slopes for the 
relationship between the normalized number of PSD95+ intersections and distance from 
IBA1+ processes using nonlinear regression, and comparing the slopes across animals in 
different conditions using one-way ANOVA as described above.

 Figure 5. Obesity reversibly increases synaptic internalization by microglia
(A), Purified synaptosomes are highly enriched with PSD95 and synaptophysin than mixed 
cellular organelles in the S1 fraction. Nuclear protein TBP was only detected in the P1 
fraction. (B), Visualization of purified synaptosomes (left), S1 fraction (middle), and P1 
fraction (right) by electron microscopy. Scalebar = 500nm. (C), Primary microglia incubated 
with e.coli conjugated to the pH-sensitive fluorophore pHrodo Green (pHrodo) internalize 
e.coli and express the microglial marker IBA1. (D), Fluorometric quantification of pHrodo-
conjugated e.coli in peritoneal macrophages and primary microglia revealed no significant 
effects of obesity or diet reversal. (E), Internalization of pHrodo-conjugated synaptosomes is 
significantly greater in primary microglia from mice on a high-fat diet (HFD/HFD), relative 
to cells from low-fat diet mice. Synaptosome internalization in HFD mice exposed to diet 
reversal (HFD/LFD) is indistinguishable from LFD/LFD mice. Internalization of pHrodo-
conjugated mixed organelles (S1 fraction) was similar across all conditions, indicative of 
selective increases in synaptic phagocytosis in dietary obesity. For all graphs, error bars 
represent the sem and asterisks (*) denote statistical significance at p<0.05 following one-
way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests.
