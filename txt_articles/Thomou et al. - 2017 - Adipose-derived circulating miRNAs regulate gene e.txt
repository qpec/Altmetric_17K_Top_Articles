Abstract
Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and plays a role in regulation of metabolism 
through release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with a fat-specific knockout of the 
miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, have major 
decreases in circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of white and especially brown adipose 
tissue (BAT) into ADicerKO mice restores circulating miRNAs associated with an improvement in 
glucose tolerance and a reduction of hepatic FGF21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene 
regulation can be mimicked by administration of normal, but not AdicerKO, serum exosomes. 
Expression of a human-specific miRNA in BAT of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3’UTR-
reporter in liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue 
constitutes a major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, and these miRNAs can regulate gene 
expression in distant tissues thereby serving as novel forms of adipokines.

miRNAs are non-coding RNAs of 19–22 nucleotides that function as negative regulators of 
translation and are involved in many cellular processes1,2,3. In addition to tissues, many 
miRNAs exist in the circulation4, a large fraction of which are in exosomes5, i.e., 50–200nm 
vesicles released from multivesicular bodies6. Increased levels of specific miRNAs have 
been associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer7, diabetes3,8,9 obesity10, and 
cardiovascular disease11. miRNAs play an important role in the differentiation and function 
of many cells, including adipose tissue12. We have shown that white adipose tissue (WAT) 
miRNAs decline with age due to a decrease in the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer13 and 
are also reduced in humans with HIV-associated lipodystrophy14 due to a decrease in Dicer. 
To better understand the role of miRNAs in fat, we generated mice specifically lacking Dicer 
in adipose tissue using Cre-lox gene recombination (Figure 1a)13. ADicerKO mice exhibit a 
defect in miRNA processing in adipose tissue resulting in a reduction of WAT, whitening of 
BAT, insulin resistance and altered circulating lipids14.
Adipose Tissue is a Major Source of Circulating Exosomal miRNAs
To determine to what extent adipose tissue contributes to circulating miRNAs, we isolated 
exosomes from sera of 6-month-old male ADicerKO and control mice by differential 
ultracentrifugation15. These vesicles were 80–200nm in diameter16 (Extended Data Figure 
1a) and stained for the exosomal markers CD63 and CD9 (Figure 1b)17,18. The number of 
exosomes isolated from ADicerKO and controls was comparable (Extended Data Figure 1b 
and 1c). qPCR profiling of serum exosomes for 709 murine miRNAs revealed 653 
detectable miRNAs (defined as CT<34). Compared to control, ADicerKO mice exhibited 
significant alterations in 422 exosomal miRNAs. Of these, 3 miRNAs were significantly 
increased, while 419 had significant decreases (Figures 1c–d, Extended Data Figure 1d and 
Supplemental Table 1) with 88% reduced by >4-fold, suggesting that adipose tissue is a 
major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Consistent with this, many of the reduced 
miRNAs (Supplemental Table 1) have been previously identified as highly expressed in fat, 
including miR-221, miR-201, miR-222 and miR-169,19,20. miRNAs also exist in the 
circulation outside of exosomes. Indeed, in a sample of 80 miRNAs, there was a broad 
reduction in total miRNAs in ADicerKO serum when compared to serum of WT mice 
(Extended Data Figure 2a), however, this reduction was not as dramatic as the 
downregulation of exosomal miRNAs showing that adipose contributes especially to the 
exosomal miRNA fraction. The loss of exosomal miRNA secretion in adipocytes lacking 
Dicer is cell autonomous. Thus, in preadipocytes isolated from Dicer-floxed animals and 
recombined in vitro, most of the detectable miRNAs (of 380 miRNAs profiled) released in 
exosomes into the media were decreased when compared to control Ad-GFP-transduced 
cells (Extended Data Figure 2b).
To further dissociate altered metabolism from lipodystrophy as a cause of reduced exosomal 
miRNAs, we compared serum miRNAs from 4-week-old control and AdicerKO mice, since

 at this age metabolic phenotypes of ADicerKO mice are minimal (Extended Data Figure 2c). 
Again, of the 380 miRNAs profiled, 373 miRNAs were detectable with 202 down-regulated 
in ADicerKO mice and only 23 miRNAs up-regulated, indicating that reduction in 
circulating exosomal miRNAs reflects primarily differences in miRNA processing/
production rather than effects of chronic lipodystrophy.
To determine if circulating miRNAs in humans also originate from fat, we performed 
exosomal miRNA profiling on sera from patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy 
(CGL) and patients with HIV-related lipodystrophy, previously shown to have decreased 
levels of Dicer in adipose tissue14 (Extended Data Figure 3a). Isolation yielded similar 
exosome numbers from controls and lipodystrophic patients (Extended Data Figure 3b). 
qPCR profiling of 572 miRNAs in exosomes revealed 119 significantly different between 
control and HIV lipodystrophy subjects and 213 significantly different between control and 
CGL subjects (Figures 1e–f, Extended Data Figure 3c, Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Of 
these, only 5% (29 miRNAs) were upregulated in CGL or HIV lipodystrophy, while 217 
(38%) were down-regulated, with 75 decreased in both groups (Figure 1g, Supplemental 
Table 4). Again, several of these miRNAs have been previously implicated in regulation of 
fat9,10,20,21. Thirty miRNAs that were decreased in serum of both patient cohorts were also 
decreased in the serum of ADicerKO mice (Supplemental Table 5).
Adipose Tissue Transplantation Reconstitutes Circulating miRNAs in 
Lipodystrophic Mice
To verify that adipose tissue is indeed a major source of circulating miRNAs, we 
transplanted fat from normal mice into ADicerKO mice (Figure 2a). miRNA profiling of 
subcutaneous inguinal (Ing) WAT, intraabdominal epididymal (Epi) WAT, and BAT from the 
normal donor mice revealed distinct, depot-specific signatures consistent with previous 
studies22 (Figures 2b, Extended Data Figure 4a; Supplemental Table 6). Considering only 
miRNAs that were expressed greater than U6, 126 miRNAs were highly expressed in BAT, 
106 in Ing-WAT, and 160 in Epi-WAT, with 82 in all three depots (Figure 2b). During the 
following two weeks, all mice had maintained body weight, and at sacrifice the transplanted 
fat weighed 80–90% of the original weight, indicating successful engraftment (Extended 
Data Figures 4b and 4c). As in the first cohort, in sham-operated ADicerKO mice circulating 
exosomal miRNAs were markedly reduced compared to controls (Figure 2c). By 
comparison, ADicerKO mice that received fat transplants showed remarkable restoration of 
circulating exosomal miRNAs (Figures 2c and Extended Data Figure 5a; Supplemental 
Tables 7 and 8). Indeed, of the 177 circulating exosomal miRNAs that were detectable in 
wild-type and significantly decreased in ADicerKO serum, fat transplantation restored the 
levels of the majority of these at least 50% of the way to normal, indicating that adipose 
tissue is a major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs and that different depots contribute 
differentially.
Physiologically, ADicerKO mice had markedly impaired glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) 
compared to controls with an ~50% increase in area under the curve (Figures 2d and 2e). 
This showed only small changes after transplantation of Ing-WAT or Epi-WAT, however,

 GTT was significantly improved in the ADicerKO mice receiving BAT transplantation 
(Figure 2e). ADicerKO mice also exhibit marked insulin resistance, as indicated by 
increased circulating insulin levels; this was also reduced in the group receiving BAT 
transplants, but did not quite reach statistical significance (Extended Data Figure 5b). Serum 
IL-6, leptin and adiponectin levels were all lower in ADicerKO and were not restored by 
transplantation (Extended Data Figure 5b).
FGF-21 as a Potential Target of Regulation by Circulating Exosomal 
miRNAs
FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor-21) is produced in liver and other tissues, released into the 
circulation and exerts effects on multiple tissues in control of metabolism23. ADicerKO mice 
had a ~3-fold increase in circulating FGF21, associated with increased levels of FGF21 
mRNA in liver, muscle, fat and pancreas (Figures 3a and 3b, Extended Data Figure 6a). 
After transplantation of WAT, serum FGF21 and liver FGF21 mRNA remained unchanged in 
the ADicerKO mice (Figures 3c and 3d). However, ADicerKO mice that received BAT 
transplants showed an ~50% reduction in the FGF21 mRNA in liver (Figure 3d). This was 
paralleled by a reduction of circulating FGF21 levels (Figure 3c), indicating that BAT 
transplantation provided some factor(s) that directly or indirectly regulated FGF21 
expression in liver. Considering that one factor could be circulating miRNAs, we performed 
miRDB analysis to identify miRNAs that might target the 3’-UTR of murine FGF21 
mRNA24. Four candidates were identified (miR-99a, miR-99b, miR-100, and miR-466i), 
and three of these (miR-99a, −99b, and −100) were significantly decreased in the serum of 
ADicerKO mice compared to controls. While these three miRNAs were restored to near WT 
levels in all ADicerKO transplant groups, only ADicerKO mice receiving BAT transplant 
exhibited expression levels higher than WT, tracking with reductions in circulating FGF21 
levels in ADicerKO mice transplanted with BAT (Extended Data Figure 6b). To determine 
which of these miRNAs might regulate FGF21, we transfected AML-12 liver cells with an 
adenoviral pacAd5-FGF21 3’-UTR luciferase reporter and after 2 days transfected the cells 
with 10 nM of a candidate or control miRNA mimetic. Of these, only miR-99b resulted in a 
robust reduction of FGF21 luciferase activity (Extended Data Figure 7a), and this correlated 
with a reduction in FGF21 mRNA level by 65% (Extended Data Figure 7b).
To test if these miRNAs could regulate FGF21 when presented in exosomes, we exposed 
AML-12 cells expressing the FGF21-3’UTR luciferase reporter to exosomes from control or 
ADicerKO mice or ADicerKO exosomes which had been electroporated with either 
miR-99a, miR-99b, miR-100, miR-466i or a control mimic. We found that in vitro the 
isolated exosomes from control mice were able to suppress FGF21-3’UTR luciferase 
activity by 60%, whereas exosomes from ADicerKO serum had no effect (Figure 3e). 
Furthermore, while ADicerKO exosomes reconstituted with miR-99a, miR-100 or miR-466i 
had minimal effects, ADicerKO exosomes bearing miR-99b resulted in a ~55% suppression 
of the luciferase activity (Figure 3f), and this was paralleled by an equal reduction in FGF21 
mRNA levels, mimicking the effect of wild-type exosomes (Extended Data Figure 7c). This 
regulation of FGF21 was dependent on exosomal delivery and was not recapitulated when 
naked miR-99b was incubated with these cells (Figure 3e, right two bars)

 To address regulation of FGF21 by exosomal miRNAs in vivo, we transduced ADicerKO 
and WT mice with a pacAd5-FGF21 3’-UTR luciferase reporter and measured hepatic 
FGF21 suppression using the IVIS imaging system. Consistent with the in vitro study, 
FGF21 3’-UTR activity in vivo was 5-fold higher in ADicerKO mice than WT mice, 
reflecting the absence of repressive circulating miRNAs in the ADicerKO mice (Figures 4a 
and 4b). Injection of WT-exosomes into AdicerKO mice induced suppression of the elevated 
FGF21 reporter activity by ~60%. This was confirmed by qPCR which showed a reduction 
in elevated hepatic FGF21 mRNA and a parallel decrease in circulating FGF21 compared to 
KO mice (Figures 4c and 4d). Consistent with BAT-secreted exosome delivery of miRNAs to 
liver, miRNAs miR-16, miR-201 and miR-222, which are relatively fat-specific, were 
significantly decreased in livers of ADicerKO mice and restored toward normal by BAT 
transplantation (Extended Data Figure 8a). This occurred with no change in the 
corresponding pre-miRNA species in the liver (Extended Data Figure 8b).
In separate experiments, we injected WT and KO mice with KO exosomes with or without 
reconstitution of miR-99b (Figure 4e). Again, KO mice showed 2.5-fold higher luciferase 
activity than WT mice, when both were given KO exosomes. Administration of KO 
exosomes reconstituted with miR-99b in the AdicerKO re-induced suppression of the 
FGF21-3’-UTR reporter 45% of the way toward normal (Figure 4f). This was accompanied 
by a parallel reduction in hepatic FGF21 message (Figure 4g) and reduced circulating 
FGF21 (Figures 4h).
Regulation of Liver Gene Expression by Adipose-Produced Circulating 
Exosomal miRNAs
Regulation of FGF21 is a complex process, which involves multiple factors. To define the 
potential of adipose-derived circulating miRNAs in vivo, we developed a more specific 
reporter system taking advantage of the human-specific miRNA hsa_miR-302f and its 
3’UTR reporter25, since this miRNA does not have a mouse homolog. We then performed 
two types of experiments. In the first protocol (Figure 5a) we injected adenovirus bearing 
pre-hsa_miR-302f or its control directly into BAT to get BAT-specific expression of the 
transduced gene26. Three days later, we injected the same mice intravenously (i.v.) with the 
adenovirus 3’-UTR luciferase reporter for hsa_miR-302f to get its expression in liver. Only 
if there was communication between the miRNA expressed in BAT and the reporter 
expressed in liver would we observe suppression of the reporter. Indeed, IVIS analysis 5 
days after transduction revealed that in mice with Ad-hsa_miR-302f transduced in BAT there 
was a >95% reduction of luciferase activity in liver when compared to mice with LacZ-
control transduced into BAT (Figures 5b and 5c).
In protocol 2 (Figure 5d), to definitively address whether hsa_miR-302f suppression of its 
reporter in liver was contingent on exosomal delivery, we used two separate cohorts of 
C57Bl/6 mice. One cohort was transduced with adenovirus bearing pre-hsa_miR-302f or 
control-LacZ adenovirus directly into BAT. A second, separate cohort of mice was 
transduced in liver by i.v. injection of adenovirus bearing the 3’-UTR hsa_miR-302f 
reporter. We then obtained serum from the donor cohorts over the following 8 days, isolated

 exosomes, injected the purified exosomes intravenously into the acceptor mice, and we 
performed IVIS analysis of the hsa_miR-302f reporter in the acceptor mice. Compared to 
the mice receiving exosomes from the Ad-LacZ BAT transduced mice, acceptor mice 
injected with exosomes from Ad-hsa_miR-302f BAT transduced mice showed a 95% 
reduction of luciferase activity in the liver (Figures 5e and 5f), demonstrating direct 
regulation of this adipose-produced circulating miRNA on activity of its reporter in liver of 
recipient mice. This was not due to liver uptake of miR-302f adenovirus that might have 
leaked from BAT, since no viral DNA expressing miR-302f (or LacZ in controls) was 
detected in livers of the animals used in protocols 1 or 2 when subjected to qPCR for these 
sequences (Extended Data Figure 8c, CT values >40).
A New Role for Fat and Its Potential Implications
Taken together, our data show that adipose tissue is a major source of circulating exosomal 
miRNAs in both mice and humans. Our data also demonstrate that the circulating exosomal 
miRNAs derived from fat may act as regulators of whole-body metabolism and mRNA 
translation in other tissues. Thus, adipose tissue transplantation, especially BAT 
transplantation, improves glucose tolerance and lowers circulating insulin and FGF21 levels, 
as well as hepatic FGF21 mRNA in recipient mouse. The latter appears to be due, at least in 
part, to a direct effect of the circulating miRNAs on FGF21 translation in liver, as incubation 
of exosomes from control mice with liver cells in vitro can lower FGF21 mRNA levels and 
repress activity of a FGF21 3’-UTR reporter. This does not occur with exosomes isolated 
from ADicerKO mice, but can be reconstituted by introduction of miR-99b, a predicted 
regulator of murine FGF21. miR-99b is also one of the miRNAs that is highly reduced in 
circulating exosomes of ADicerKO mice, and one whose level is largely restored by BAT 
transplantation. Transplantation with WAT also significantly restored the level of miR-99b in 
circulating exosomes, but only BAT transplantation reduced hepatic FGF21 mRNA, 
suggesting that BAT-derived exosomes may more efficiently target the liver compared to 
WAT-derived exosomes. Such tissue targeting has been suggested by in vitro studies18,27, 
implying inter-organ exosomal delivery has tissue specificity28. The generalizability of this 
type of cross-talk between adipose tissue and liver mRNA regulation is made ever clearer by 
use of a miRNA reporter which is human specific. Hence, when mouse BAT is transduced 
with an adenovirus producing human-specific miRNA hsa_miR-302f, exosomes present in 
the circulation of that mouse can target an hsa_miR-302f 3’-UTR reporter in the liver of the 
same mouse or even a different mouse given isolated exosomes from this donor.
Since adipose tissue is a major source of circulating miRNAs, the loss of adipose-derived 
miRNAs in lipodystrophy and their restoration by fat transplantation may involve many 
targets and tissues in addition to hepatic FGF21. miRNAs that are restored with BAT 
transplantation include miR-325 and miR-743b (predicted to target UCP-1) and miR-98 
(predicted to target PGC1α), suggesting that adipose tissue secreted miRNAs may have both 
paracrine and endocrine actions. This could contribute to other aspects of the phenotype of 
the ADicerKO mouse, including features of metabolic syndrome and “whitening” of 
interscapular BAT14. Regulation of metabolism and mRNA expression in lipodystrophy 
could also involve other exosomal factors contributed to the circulation by fat, as well as a 
range of non-exosomal mechanisms, including conventional adipokines and cytokines, as 
Thomou et al.

 well as other hormones and metabolic intermediates29. What is clear from this study is that 
in addition to serving as markers of disease, exosomal miRNAs have potential for transfer to 
other tissues and serve a regulatory role30,31. In vitro, endothelial exosomes have been 
shown to target vascular cells inducing protection from apoptosis 32. Likewise, exosomes 
from mast cells in vitro can trigger other mast cells28, and exosomes secreted by 
macrophages and/or platelets can be taken up by monocytes31. Exosomal miRNA transfer 
has been also reported in glioblastoma 15,33 and between embryonic stem cells and 
embryonic fibroblasts34. While the majority of miRNAs in serum are in exosomes35, adipose 
tissue could also contribute to circulating miRNAs in microvesicles or associated with 
Argonaute36 or HDL37. To what extent these forms of circulating miRNAs can regulate gene 
expression in distant tissues remains to be determined.
In summary, our data show that a major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs is adipose 
tissue and that different adipose depots contribute different exosomal miRNAs to the 
circulation. Our data also show that these adipose-derived circulating miRNAs can have far-
reaching systemic effects, including regulation of mRNA expression and translation. As a 
product of different adipose depots, these exosomal miRNAs could also change in level in 
diseases with altered fat mass, such as lipodystrophy and obesity, or altered adipose 
distribution and function, such as diabetes and aging. Thus, adipose-derived exosomal 
miRNAs constitute a novel class of adipokines that can be secreted by fat and act as 
regulators of metabolism in distant tissues providing a new mechanism of cell-cell crosstalk.
Materials and Methods
Exosome isolation, loading and immunoelectron microscopy
Murine and human sera were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and then at 10,000 × g for 10 
min to remove whole cells, cell debris and aggregates. The serum was subjected to 0.1 µm 
filtration and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pelleted vesicles were suspended in 
1xPBS, ultracentrifuged again at 100,000 × g for washing, resuspended in 1xPBS and 
prepared for electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy or miRNA extraction.
All in vitro experiments were carried out by using exosome-free FBS. AML-12 cells were 
acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA) (cat # CRL-2254). For exosome loading, exosome 
preparations were isolated and diluted with PBS to final volume of 100 µl. Exosome 
electroporation was carried out by using a variation of a previously described technique38. 
Exosome preparations were mixed with 200 µl phosphate-buffered sucrose: 272 mM 
sucrose/7 mM K2HPO4 along with 10 nM of a miRNA mimic, and the mixture was pulsed 
at 500 mV and 250 µF resistance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 
Electroporated exosomes were resuspended in a total volume of 500ul PBS and added to the 
target cells.
Isolated exosomes were subjected to immunoelectron microscopy using standard 
techniques5. Briefly, exosome suspensions were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde/0.15 M 
sodium cacodylate and post-fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in 
Epon 812. Samples were sectioned, post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and 
examined with an electron microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed

 with 4% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde/0.15 M sodium cacodylate and processed as 
above. Sections were probed with anti-CD63 (cat. nr. sc15363, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 
Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CD9 (cat. nr. ab92726, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibodies or control 
rabbit IgG and visualized with immunogold-labeled secondary antibody. Immuno-EM 
analysis revealed that the isolated exosomes were 50–200 nM in diameter and stained 
positively for the tetraspanin exosome markers CD63 and CD939.
Exosome number estimation assay
Exosomal concentration was assessed using the EXOCET assay (System Biosciences, 
Mountain View, CA), which measured the esterase activity of cholesteryl ester transfer 
protein (CETP) activity. CETP is known to be enriched in exosomal membranes. The assay 
was calibrated using a known isolated exosome preparation (System Biosciences, Mountain 
View, CA). Additionally, exosome preparations were subjected to the qNano system 
employing the TRPS (Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing) technology for measurement of 
number and size distribution of exosomes (IZON technologies, Cambridge, MA).
Serum miRNA isolation
For total serum miRNA isolation, 100 µl of serum was obtained from ADicerKO or Lox 
littermates and miRNAs were isolated using an Exiqon miRCURY Biofluid RNA isolation 
kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA isolation and real time PCR analysis
RNA was isolated from exosomal preparations using TRIzol, following the manufacturer’s 
protocol (Life Sciences, Grand Island, NY). Subsequently, 50 ng exosomal RNA were 
subjected to reverse transcription into cDNA by using a mouse miRNome profiler kit 
(System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). qPCR was performed in 6 µl reaction volumes 
containing cDNA along with universal primers for each miRNA and SYBR Green PCR 
master mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Bioinformatics qPCR data analysis
In line with previous research, for all serum and exosomal miRNA quantitative PCR 
reactions the CT values were normalized using U6 as an internal control. For estimation of 
miRNA abundance in fat tissue, data were normalized using the global average of expressed 
CT values per sample40 since U6 itself was differentially expressed between depots. For all 
quantitative PCR reaction involving gene expression calculations of FGF21, normalization 
was carried out by using TBP as an internal control. Differential expression analysis of the 
high-throughput -ΔCT values was done with the Bioconductor limma package41 in the R 
software. Fold differences in comparisons were expressed as 2^-ΔΔCT. Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) plots were created using the R software (www.r-project.org) with the 
ggplot2 package.
Heatmaps of miRNA expression
A detection threshold was set to CT of 34 for all mouse miRNA PCR reactions, whereas for 
the PCR of human miRNAs no threshold was used, as per manufacturer’s recommendation

 (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). A miRNA was plotted only if its raw CT value 
was ≤ 34 in at least three samples, except for the brown preadipocyte and 4-week-old mouse 
experiments where its raw CT only had to be ≤ 34 twice. miRNA -ΔCT values were z-scored 
and heatmap creation was then carried out by Cluster 3.0 and TreeView programs as 
previously described42.
Fat tissue transplantation
Fat tissue transplantation was carried out as previously described43. Briefly, 10-week-old 
male Lox donor mice were (C57BL/6 males) sacrificed, and their inguinal, epididymal, and 
BAT fat depots were isolated, cut into several small pieces of 20mg, and transplanted into 
10-week-old male ADicerKO mice (5 mice per group; males). Each recipient ADicerKO 
mice received the equivalent transplanted fat mass of two donor Lox-control mice. 
Transplanted mice received analgesic intraperitoneal injections (buprenorphine, 50 mg/kg) 
post-surgically for 7 days. At day 12, glucose tolerance test was performed after 16 hours 
fasting by intraperitoneal injection of 2 g/kg glucose. All mice were sacrificed after 14 days. 
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the IACUC regulations.
Luciferase vectors and in vitro assays
An adenoviral FGF21 3’-UTR reporter was created by cloning the 3’-UTR of FGF21 into 
the pMir-Report vector. Subsequently, the luciferase-3’UTR fragment was cloned into the 
adenoviral vector pacAd5-CMV-IRES-GFP creating an adenovirus bearing the 
FGF21-3’UTR reporter. Hsa-miR-302f-3’-UTR was created by cloning the synthesized Luc-
miR-302f-3’-UTR fragment (Genescript, Piscataway, NJ) in the Viral Power Adenoviral 
Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In vitro bioluminescence was measured via a 
dual luciferase kit (Promega, Sunnyvale, CA).
In vivo regulation of FGF21 experiments
8-week-old male ADicerKO or WT mice were injected i.v. with an adenovirus bearing the 
3’-UTR of the FGF21 fused to the luciferase gene to create two groups of a liver reporter 
mice, one in the ADicerKO mice and one in the WT background. One day later, a third 
group of ADicerKO mice which had also been injected i.v. with an adenovirus bearing the 
3’-UTR of the FGF21 fused to the luciferase gene, received an i.v. injection of exosomes 
isolated from the serum of WT mice. 24 hours later, in vivo luminescence of the FGF21 3’-
UTR was measured using an IVIS imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) by 
administering D-Luciferin (20 mg/kg) following the manufacturer’s protocol (Perkin Elmer, 
Waltham, MA).
For the second group, 8-week-old male ADicerKO or WT mice were also transduced by i.v. 
injection of an adenovirus bearing the 3’-UTR of the FGF21 fused to the luciferase gene. 
After 1 day, mice received an i.v. injection of exosomes isolated from the serum of either 
ADicerKO mice or ADicerKO mice reconstituted in vitro by electroporation with 10 nM 
miR-99b. 24 hours later, in vivo luminescence was measured using an IVIS imaging system 
by administering D-Luciferin (20 mg/kg) following the manufacturer’s protocol (Perkin 
Elmer, Waltham, MA).

 BAT-derived exosomes expressing human miRNA targeting the liver
Protocol 1—On day 0, 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were injected directly into BAT 
with an adenovirus bearing pre-hsa_miR-302f or an adenovirus bearing LacZ mRNA as 
control. Hsa_miR-302f is human specific and does not have a mouse homolog. This 
procedure was conducted under ketamine anesthesia. Four days later, the same mice were 
injected i.v. with an adenovirus bearing the 3’-UTR for this miR-302f in-frame with the 
Luciferase gene, thereby putting this human miRNA reporter in the liver of the mouse. Only 
if there was communication between the BAT produced miRNA and the liver would there be 
suppression of the miR-302f reporter. In vivo luminescence was measured on day 6 using an 
IVIS imaging system as described above.
Protocol 2—To assess specifically the role exosomal miR-302f in the regulation of its 
reporter in the liver, two separate cohorts of 8-week-old, male C57Bl/6 mice were generated: 
one cohort had the adenovirus bearing pre-miR-302f or LacZ injected directly into BAT 
(donor cohort) and a second cohort was transduced in the liver with an adenovirus bearing 
the reporter 3’-UTR of this miR-302f described above (acceptor cohort). Serum was 
obtained at days 3 and 6 from the donor cohorts, exosomes were isolated and injected i.v. 
into the acceptor mice on days 4 and 7 respectively. On day 8, in vivo luminescence was 
measured in the acceptor mice using an IVIS imaging system as described above.
Adenoviral DNA isolation
To test for adenoviral presence in livers and BAT of C57BL/6 mice, 100 mg of tissue was 
homogenized in 1ml of sterile 1xPBS. The homogenate was spun down, and 150 µl of 
cleared supernatant were used to isolate Adenoviral DNA using a Nucleospin RNA and 
DNA Virus kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara, Mountain View, CA). PCR 
was performed on 2 µl of the isolated adenoviral DNA using SYBR green chemistry 
detecting LacZ or miR-302f amplicons.
qPCR fat tissue transplantation analysis
For all output for the fat tissue transplantation experiment, a miRNA was only considered 
present if its mean CT in the WT group was less than 34. We then identified those miRNAs 
that were significantly decreased in ADicerKO serum. For a miRNA to be considered 
restored after transplantation by a particular depot it had to be: 1) significantly increased 
from ADicerKO serum; 2) have a mean CT less than 34; and 3) its CT had to be more than 
half of the way from ADicerKO to WT on the CT scale.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance tests were followed by two-tailed Dunn’s post-hoc analysis or Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons test to identify statistically significant comparisons. All t-tests carried 
out were two-tailed. All Mann Whitney U-tests were two-tailed. P-values less than 0.05 
were considered significant. All analysis of variance, t-tests, and area under the curve 
calculations were carried out by GraphPad Prism 5.0.

 miRDB Analysis
For miRDB analysis (www.mirdb.org), a search by target gene was performed against the 
mouse database. A target score of 85 was set to exclude potential false positive interacting 
miRNAs.
