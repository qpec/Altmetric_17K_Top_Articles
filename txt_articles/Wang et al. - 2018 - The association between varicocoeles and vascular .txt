SUMMARY
Studies have suggested an association between varicocele, hypogonadism, and elevated oxidative stress markers, but no other
health risks have been associated with varicoceles. We sought to determine the association between varicocele and incident medical
comorbidities. Using the Truven Health MarketScan� claims database from 2001 to 2009, we identified 4459 men with varicoceles,
and 100,066 controls based on ICD-9 and CPT codes, with an average follow-up of 3.1 person years. Men with varicoceles were classi-
fied as symptomatic or asymptomatic based on co-existing diagnoses. Men with medical comorbidities present before or within
1 year of index diagnosis were excluded. Metabolic and cardiovascular outcome variables were identified via ICD-9 codes. A Cox
regression analysis was used to assess incident risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease amongst the different groups. Men with
varicoceles had a higher incidence of heart disease compared to men who underwent infertility testing (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45),
and men who underwent vasectomy (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13–1.54). The varicoceles group also had a higher risk of diabetes (HR 1.73,
95% CI: 1.37–2.18) and hyperlipidemia (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03–1.28) compared to the vasectomy group. Furthermore, men with symp-
tomatic varicoceles (n = 3442) had a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia following diagnosis, while men with
asymptomatic varicoceles (n = 1017) did not. Given the prevalence of varicoceles, further research is needed to understand the
implications of a varicocele to a man’s overall health.
INTRODUCTION
Varicocoeles occur in 15% of men and have been associated
with testicular atrophy, scrotal pain, and alternations in the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis including hypogonadism or
decreased spermatozoa or testosterone production with elevated
gonadotropins (Tanrikut et al., 2011a; Damsgaard et al., 2016).
While the pathophysiology of varicocoeles has not been com-
pletely determined, it is assumed that a combination of
increased oxidative stress, scrotal temperatures, pressures, and
an accumulation of toxins (e.g. metabolites) contributes to the
symptoms experienced in some men (Naughton et al., 2001;
Eisenberg & Lipshults, 2011).
Treatment recommendations regarding the management of a
varicocoele generally address symptoms and bother. While some
men are offered treatment, others are managed expectedly espe-
cially in men beyond reproductive years (Movassaghi & Turek,
2008). As varicocoeles are thought to be a progressive lesion,
treatment may also be offered to avoid further decline in testicu-
lar function (World Health Organization, 1992). While impaired
sperm production is the most common reason for repair, some
have advocated varicocoelectomy to improve testosterone pro-
duction given the association between varicocoeles and low
serum
testosterone
(Younes,
2000;
Tanrikut
et al.,
2011b).
Hypogonadism has been associated with metabolic risk factors
including obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
and insulin resistance (Wang et al., 2011) as well as cardiovascu-
lar
disease
events (English
et al.,
2000;
Jones,
2010)
and
increased all-cause mortality (Khaw et al., 2007; Haring et al.,
2010). In addition, varicocoeles are associated with oxidative
stress which has also been linked to heart and metabolic disease
(Cervellione et al., 2006).
Given the association between varicocoeles, hypogonadism,
and oxidative stress as well as hypogonadism, oxidative stress,
and metabolic diseases, we sought to determine if varicocoeles

 are associated with increased risk for incident metabolic and
vascular disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We analyzed subjects with claims data contained within the
Truven Health Marketscan™ Commercial Claims and Encoun-
ters database. This database provides information from adjudi-
cated and paid insurance claims filed for the care of privately
insured individuals with employment-based insurance through
a participating employer. Marketscan provides claims data on 77
million covered lives since 1996. This study used data from 2001
to 2009. The number of individuals represented in the database
varies over time; the more recent years of the data contain more
than 30 million
covered
lives. Institutional
Review Board
approval was obtained.
Men with a history of varicocoeles were identified using diag-
nosis (ICD-9) and treatment codes (CPT). ICD-9 coding used
was 456.4. CPT varicocoele treatment codes included 55530,
55535, 55540, 55550. Men undergoing infertility testing were
identified using ICD9 V26.21 and CPT semen analysis codes
89300, 89310, 89320, 89322. Next, we identified men who under-
went vasectomy, implying fertility, using ICD9 V25.09, V25.2,
V26.52 and CPT 55250, 55450, 55400, 54900, 54901. All groups
were mutually exclusive. In each group, each man was assigned
an ‘index date’ as the first date on which a varicocoele diagnosis
or treatment code, an infertility testing code, or a vasectomy
code, respectively, was observed in the data.
For all groups, men were required to be enrolled in a plan cov-
ered by the database for at least 1 year before and 1 year after
the index date. Men observed before the index date, or within
1 year after, to have other prevalent comorbidities included in
the outcome analysis (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi-
demia, renal disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, depres-
sion, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart
disease [ischemic and other], injury, alcohol abuse, drug abuse,
anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorder) were also excluded. Sub-
jects were required to be between the ages of 18 and 50 years at
the time of the first database entry.
For each man in the cohort, the number of outpatient visits
after the index date was ascertained with CPT codes indicating
new and follow-up office visits, consultations, or preventative
medicine encounters. Medical comorbidities were determined
based on ICD9 codes on any claim and included obesity (278.0)
and smoking (305.1, V1582).
Patients with varicocoeles were further classified as symp-
tomatic or asymptomatic based on the presence or absence of
any of the co-existing diagnoses: male infertility (ICD9 606.x),
testicular hypofunction (ICD9 257.2), testicular atrophy (ICD9
608.3), and scrotal pain (ICD9 608.89, 608.9).
Outcome measures
We identified incident metabolic and vascular diseases based
on diagnosis codes: hypertension (401–405), diabetes (250), hyper-
lipidemia (272), renal disease (403, 404, 580–588 and v42, 45.1 and
56.x), peripheral vascular disease (433–434), cerebrovascular dis-
ease (430, 434), and heart disease (ischemic 410–414, other heart
diseases 420–429 e.g. cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, etc.) which
includes both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease.
Statistical analysis
Men accrued at-risk time beginning 1 year after their index
dates until medical diagnosis or their final day of the final year
of enrollment in a health plan included in the MarketScan data-
base. The first year was excluded as a queried medical diagnosis
within this time period was an exclusion criterion.
We calculated incidence rates in our cohorts per 1000 person-
years. We then compared the risk of health outcomes in men
diagnosed with varicocoele to men who only underwent fertility
testing and men utilizing vasectomy using a Cox proportional
hazard regression model that adjusted for age, index year, obe-
sity, smoking, number of outpatient visits, and follow-up time.
We conducted subgroup analyses restricting the analysis to
include only men with specific diagnosis of symptomatic varico-
coeles (e.g. men who also had ICD 606.x, ICD 257.2, ICD 608.3
and ICD 608.89, 608.9) compared to men who were diagnosed
with varicocoeles without any associated symptoms. All p values
were two-sided with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
In all, we identified 4459 men with varicocoeles, 21,840 men
who underwent infertility testing without concurrent varico-
coeles, and 78,226 men who underwent vasectomy. The average
ages of men in the three groups were 32.2 years old for the varic-
ocoele group, 32.9 for those seeking infertility testing without
varicocoeles, and 35 years old for men who underwent vasec-
tomy. The average number of annual visits per patient was also
comparable between groups (Table 1).
Men with varicocoeles had a higher incidence of overall heart
disease (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.44) in the years following the
diagnosis when compared to men who underwent infertility
testing. A similar result was identified when comparing men
with varicocoeles to those utilizing vasectomy (HR 1.31, 95% CI
1.13–1.53). Similar results were seen when examining either
ischemic heart disease (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.82) or other
heart diseases (HR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.51, Table 2). In addition,
men with varicocoeles had a higher risk of diabetes (HR 1.71,
95% CI: 1.35–2.16) and hyperlipidemia (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03–
1.28) when compared to men who underwent vasectomy
(Table 2). There were no significant differences between the

 groups when examining renal disease, peripheral vascular disor-
ders, or cerebrovascular disease. Men with varicocoeles showed
a lower risk of developing incident hypertension compared to
men who underwent infertility testing (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–
0.997).
To identify men most at risk, we stratified our data into men
with symptomatic or asymptomatic varicocoeles (e.g. none of
the associated diagnoses). Men with symptomatic varicocoeles
(n = 3442) had similar elevations in risk of heart disease and
hyperlipidemia as seen in the whole cohort. Specifically, men
with symptomatic varicocoeles had an increased incidence of
heart disease compared to men with infertility testing (HR 1.26,
95% CI 1.05–1.52) and when compared to men who had a vasec-
tomy (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16–1.63). Similarly, when compared to
men with vasectomies, men with symptomatic varicocoeles also
had higher incidence of diabetes (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.49–2.46)
and hyperlipidemia (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04–1.32) (Table 3).
In contrast, men with asymptomatic varicocoeles (n = 1017)
did not have an increased risk of heart disease (HR 1.08, 95% CI
0.76–1.54), diabetes (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44–1.48), hyperlipidemia
(HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74–1.17), or other comorbid disease when
compared to the group who underwent infertility testing. Simi-
larly, men with asymptomatic varicocoeles also did not have an
increased risk of disease compared to men who underwent
vasectomy in regard to heart disease (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79–
1.57), diabetes (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.61–2.01), hyperlipidemia (HR
1.07, 95% CI 0.86–1.35), and other comorbid diseases (Table 3).
The symptomatic varicocoeles group was further subdivided
into each specific symptom (i.e. male infertility (606.x), scrotal
pain/disorder (608.89, 608.9), testicular hypofunction (257.2),
and atrophy of testis (608.3). As shown in Table 4, men with a
varicocoele and male infertility had an increased risk of diabetes
(HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1–1.95) as well as heart disease (HR 1.26; 95%
CI 1.03–1.55). Similar trends for varicocoeles-bearing men with
scrotal pain or testis atrophy were also seen among other meta-
bolic outcomes although the number of individuals in the sub-
groups
was
small
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
This study identified a higher risk of incident metabolic and
vascular disease in men with varicocoeles in the years following
a diagnosis. Moreover, the current data suggest that most of the
risk occurs in men with symptomatic varicocoeles. When further
stratified, it was noted that similar risk seemed to be present
whether varicocoele symptomatology was male infertility or
scrotal pain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demon-
strate a higher risk of incident metabolic and vascular disease
among men with varicocoeles.
The current surgical management of varicocoeles is largely
focused on preventing or treating male infertility (Schlegel, 2012;
Choi & Kim, 2013), with treatment of refractory orchialgia as a
less common indication (Abrol et al., 2014). However for men
without future reproductive intent, the absence of pain often
leads to expectant management of varicocoeles rather than sur-
gical repair although varicocoeles are recognized as progressive
lesions (World Health Organization, 1992; Witt & Lipshultz,
1993).
However, varicocoeles have been associated with conditions
that can impair health. The association between varicocoeles
and low testosterone levels has been shown in both rat and
human studies (Tanrikut et al., 2011b). Many meta-analysis and
prospective studies on human patients have also shown that
treatment of varicocoeles has resulted in increase in testosterone

VARICOCELES ASSOC. WITH VASCULAR DISEASE

 levels (Fish & Hyun, 2012; Abdel-Meguid et al., 2014). Further-
more, the literature suggests that the effect is more pronounced
among hypogonadal men and even among older men (defined
as > 40 years) (Hsiao et al., 2011; Abdel-Meguid et al., 2014).
There is also a growing body of literature that demonstrates the
relationship between low testosterone and increased comorbid-
ity including cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarc-
tion, angina, or coronary heart disease (Araujo et al., 2011;
Corona et al., 2011) as well as metabolic disorders including
obesity and metabolic syndrome (Kelly & Jones, 2015; Wickra-
matilake, 2015). While the etiology of the observed association
between varicocoele and metabolic and vascular disease could
plausibly be mediated by testosterone, the current data do not
allow such analyses. It is important to note that men with a
varicocoele and testicular failure (a common code used to indi-
cate low testosterone levels) did not show higher risk of incident
metabolic syndrome. Importantly, studies have consistently
demonstrated that BMI is inversely related to varicocoele preva-
lence (Rais et al., 2013). Thus, obesity would be unlikely to medi-
ate the observed effect.
In addition, varicocoeles are associated with elevated levels of
oxidative stress. While the effects of reactive oxygen species can
impair sperm production, it is conceivable that systemic effects
may also exist. Indeed, elevated levels of oxidative stress have
been associated with cardiovascular risk (Ridker, 2016).
Several limitations warrant mention. As the data are based on
diagnosis and treatment codes, it is unclear how many patients
were screened for varicocoeles or how varicocoeles were diag-
nosed. It is possible that only a limited portion of the population
underwent screening which may introduce some bias toward
patients with symptomatic varicocoeles. Additionally, while it is
reasonable to expect that most varicocoeles were diagnosed
based on physical exam, which is the gold standard, there are no
codes that explicitly designate how they were diagnosed or their
clinical grade.
As previously mentioned, laboratory measurements were not
available, so we cannot determine the causal etiology of the
identified associations. However, the association between varic-
ocoeles, hypogonadism, oxidative stress, and metabolic diseases
may be a possible etiology for the findings of our study. Another
limitation to our study is the limited follow-up time. Although
the number of total patient years is high, the average follow-up
for each individual was limited. Given that the average age of the
participants in the three groups was in the fourth decade of life,
it is possible that the study may underestimate the incident risk
of the comorbid diseases as many of disorders may not have
been diagnosed during the short follow-up window where the
risk of such metabolic diseases is relatively low.
Another limitation of using insurance claims database is that
the information is affected by physician coding habits, which
can vary widely in detail and specificity. A large portion of the
men who were coded as having varicocoeles did not have associ-
ated symptoms that were coded; however, it is possible that not
all of these men were indeed asymptomatic. Similarly, men who
were listed as having associated symptoms may not have had all
of their symptoms included in detail. The variety of symptoms
associated with varicocoeles contributes to both smaller sub-
group numbers (e.g. there are only 52 patients with varicocoeles
and associated scrotal pain) and increased heterogeneity of the
‘symptomatic varicocoele’ group. Though this limits the strength

 of these sub-group analyses, it is also possible that some of the
trends that are not statistically significant may be stronger than
they appear due to under-reporting.
Furthermore, the MarketScan Database, which is based on
insurance claims data, draws from a selected group of patients
who have access to health care and seek out specialist consulta-
tions which may not represent all US men.
Despite these limitations, MarketScan provides access to a
large sample of US men. Moreover, the MarketScan Database
has been previously validated
and used to identify both
increased risk of cancer and increase risk of incident chronic
medical conditions among infertile men (Eisenberg et al., 2015,
2016). Moreover, the number of patients included in the data-
base along with the longitudinal follow-up provides a unique
opportunity to identify important population-level associations
among relatively rare conditions.
CONCLUSIONS
According to the 2010 US Census, there are 114 million men
above age 18, suggesting that approximately 17 million (15%)
or more men may have varicocoeles (United States Census
Bureau, 2011). Although the associations between varicocoeles
and infertility are well established, our findings suggest that
varicocoeles
may
be
a
harbinger
of
lifelong
metabolic
disorders, though the pathophysiologic mechanism is still
unclear. Nevertheless, given the prevalence of varicocoeles in
the population, studies confirming and evaluating the etiology
are needed to further identify the implications of a varicocoele
on a man’s overall health.
