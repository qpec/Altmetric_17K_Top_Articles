IMPORTANCE Guidelines assert that contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) should be
discouraged in patients without an elevated risk for a second primary breast cancer. However,
little is known about the impact of surgeons discouraging CPM on patient care satisfaction or
decisions to seek treatment from another clinician.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between patient report of first-surgeon
recommendation against CPM and the extent of discussion about it with 3 outcomes: patient
satisfaction with surgery decisions, receipt of a second opinion, and receipt of surgery by a
second surgeon.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based survey study was conducted in
Georgia and California. We identified 3880 women with stages 0 to II breast cancer treated in
2013-2014 through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries of Georgia and
Los Angeles County. Surveys were sent approximately 2 months after surgery (71% response
rate, n = 2578). In this analysis conducted from February to May 2016, we included patients
with unilateral breast cancer who considered CPM (n = 1140). Patients were selected
between July 2013 and September 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We examined report of surgeon recommendations, level of
discussion about CPM, satisfaction with surgical decision making, receipt of second surgical
opinion, and surgery from a second surgeon.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of patients included in this study was 56 (10.6) years. About
one-quarter of patients (26.7%; n = 304) reported that their first surgeon recommended
against CPM and 30.1% (n = 343) reported no substantial discussion about CPM.
Dissatisfaction with surgery decision was uncommon (7.6%; n = 130), controlling for clinical
and demographic characteristics. One-fifth of patients (20.6%; n = 304) had a second
opinion about surgical options and 9.8% (n = 158) had surgery performed by a second
surgeon. Dissatisfaction was very low (3.9%; n = 42) among patients who reported that their
surgeon did not recommend against CPM but discussed it. Dissatisfaction was substantively
higher for those whose surgeon recommended against CPM with no substantive discussion
(14.5%; n = 37). Women who received a recommendation against CPM were not more likely
to seek a second opinion (17.1% among patients with recommendation against CPM vs 15.1%
of others; P = .52) nor to receive surgery by a second surgeon (7.9% among patients with
recommendation against CPM vs 8.3% of others; P = .88).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients are satisfied with surgical decision making.
First-surgeon recommendation against CPM does not appear to substantively increase
patient dissatisfaction, use of second opinions, or loss of the patient to a second surgeon.

ates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM)
in US women with unilateral breast cancer have in-
creased, largely because of patients’desire for the
procedure.1MorepatientsconsiderCPMtodaybecauseofgreater
awarenessofthetreatmentoptionandpsychologicalfactorsthat
motivate their preferences for the most extensive surgical
treatment.2CurrentclinicalguidelinessuggestthatCPMshould
be discouraged in patients who do not have elevated risk for a
second primary breast cancer based on family history and re-
sults of genetic testing.3,4 However, most women who un-
dergo CPM after a diagnosis of breast cancer have an average
risk for developing a second breast primary, and rates of con-
tralateral breast cancer have been decreasing steadily owing to
the increased use of adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage
disease.5,6 Thecomplexinteractionbetweenpatientdesiresfor
the most extensive treatment and the surgeon’
s role in mini-
mizing surgical morbidity is poorly understood. In particular,
little is known regarding the impact of a surgeon discouraging
CPM and patient satisfaction with care or the decision to seek
treatmentwithanothersurgeon.Toaddressthisknowledgegap,
we examined patient reactions to recommendations regarding
surgery options made by their first surgical consultant follow-
ing a diagnosis of breast cancer by considering 3 outcomes: pa-
tient satisfaction with the surgery decision, receipt of a second
surgical opinion, and whether a second surgeon performed the
definitive surgery. We also examined the extent to which CPM
was discussed and its association with patient appraisal of sur-
gery decision making. We hypothesized that patient report of
afirst-surgeonrecommendationagainstCPMmayresultinless-
satisfied patients, more second opinions, and greater likeli-
hood of receipt of surgery from a second surgeon.
Methods
Study Sample and Data Collection
After institutional review board approval from the University
of Michigan, Emory University, and the University of South-
ern California, we selected women aged 20 to 79 years and di-
agnosed as having stages 0 to II breast cancer who were re-
ported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County. We re-
ceived a waiver of written informed consent, as participation
in the survey study (after receiving detailed information about
the study, benefits and risks, and their rights as a participant)
was considered adequate informed consent. Eligible patients
were identified via initial surgical pathology reports from a list
of definitive procedures (performed with intent of removing
the entire tumor with clear margins). Patients were selected
approximately2monthsaftersurgeryandsurveysweremailed
on a monthly basis shortly after (mean [SD] diagnosis survey
completion, 6 [2.8] months). To select participants with early-
stage breast cancer, patients with stage III or IV disease, tu-
mors greater than 5 cm, or 3 or more involved lymph nodes
were excluded. Black, Asian, and Hispanic women were over-
sampled in Los Angeles using an approach we previously
described.7 Patients were selected between July 2013 and Sep-
tember 2014, with data analysis condicyed from February to
May 2016. To encourage response, we provided a $20 cash in-
centive and used a modified Dillman method for patient
recruitment,8 including reminders to nonrespondents. All
materials were sent in English. We also included Spanish-
translatedmaterialstoallwomenwithsurnamessuggestingHis-
panic ethnicity.7 Responses to the survey were merged with
clinical data from SEER.
We selected 3880 women diagnosed as having early-stage
breast cancer in 2013-2014 based on rapid reporting systems
from the SEER registries; among them, 249 were later deemed
ineligibleowingtohavingapriorbreastcancerdiagnosisorstage
III-IV disease; residing outside the SEER registry area; or being
deceased, too ill/incompetent, or unable to complete a survey
in Spanish or English. Of 3631 eligible women remaining, 1053
did not return a survey or refused to participate. Of 2578 pa-
tients who responded (71%), 110 patients with bilateral disease
wereexcluded.Additionally,weexcluded1328patientswhore-
ported no consideration of CPM, leaving 1140 (mean [SD] age,
56 [10.6] years; 46.2% of those with unilateral disease) for the
analytic sample (eFigure in the Supplement).
Questionnaire Design and Content
Questionnaire content was developed based on a conceptual
framework,9-12 research questions, and hypotheses. We de-
veloped measures drawing from the literature and our prior
research. We used standard techniques to assess content
validity, including systematic review by design experts, cog-
nitive pretesting with patients, and pilot studies in selected
internet and clinic populations.
Measures
There were 3 primary dependent variables in this study. Dis-
satisfaction with the surgery decision was constructed from
the Patient Satisfaction With the Surgery Decision Scale vali-
dated in prior studies (continuous measure range from 1 to 5
calculated by averaging a 5-item scale; Likert response cat-
egories 1 to 5 from not at all to very satisfied).13,14 This was cre-
ated as a binary outcome (satisfied/dissatisfied) as this had
more clinically meaningful interpretation. A cutoff below 3 in-
dicated dissatisfaction. We performed sensitivity analyses
evaluating a continuous variable and varying the cutoff for the
Key Points
Question What is the response of patients to their first surgeon’
s
recommendations against contralateral prophylactic mastectomy
(CPM) with regard to decision satisfaction, receipt of a second
opinion, or receipt of surgery from a second surgeon?
Findings In this population-based survey, one-quarter of patients
reported that their surgeon recommended against CPM and
one-third noted no substantial discussion about it. Women who
received a recommendation against CPM were less satisfied with
the surgery decision, but not more likely to seek a second opinion
or to receive surgery by a second surgeon.
Meaning First-surgeon recommendation against CPM does not
appear to substantively increase patient dissatisfaction, use of
second opinions, or loss of the patient to a second surgeon.

 binary specification. The 2 other dependent variables were
whether the patient reported receiving a second opinion about
thesurgerydecision(yes/no)andwhethertheyhadtheirbreast
cancer surgery by a second surgeon (yes/no).
There were 2 primary independent variables. Patient re-
port of first-surgeon recommendation about CPM was ascer-
tained by asking patients, “How strongly did the first surgeon
you consulted recommend having a mastectomy on both
breasts?” The 5 response categories were strongly/weakly
recommended for CPM, left up to the patient, or strongly/
weakly recommended against CPM. We created a binary vari-
able a priori that indicated that the surgeon recommended
against CPM vs recommended CPM or it was left up to the pa-
tient. A level of discussion about CPM during treatment delib-
erationwasmeasuredusinga5-itemassessmentofwhethersur-
geons discussed the specific benefits and risks of CPM with
regard to (1) survival, (2) recurrence of treated cancer, (3) oc-
currence of new contralateral cancer, (4) cosmetic outcomes,
and (5) recovery from surgery. This was also categorized as a
binaryoutcomeforclinicalinterpretability.Weconsideredthat
CPM was not substantively discussed if patients reported that
it was not discussed for any of the 5 items. Sensitivity analy-
ses specified a priori were performed using an ordinal
approach (no tradeoffs discussed, 3 discussed, or all dis-
cussed). Additional covariates included age, marital status,
education, insurance, race/ethnicity, and an indicator of el-
evated risk for second primary breast cancer vs average risk
(based on a detailed assessment of family cancer history and
genetic testing results) all derived from the patient survey. We
alsoincludedgeographicsiteandstagederivedfromSEERclini-
cal information.
Statistical Analysis
First, we examined the characteristics of the total population
followed by the distribution of key outcomes and covariates
for women who reported any consideration of CPM. We then
conducted logistic regression to examine the association be-
tween the binary variable of first surgeon recommended
againstCPMandsociodemographicfactors(maritalstatus,age,
education, race/ethnicity, and paid work at time of diagno-
sis), risk for second primary, and geographic site. Finally, we
calculated adjusted proportions of the 3 outcome variables by
surgeon recommendation and the CPM discussion variable by
creating separate logistic regression models for each of the out-
comes and generating the marginal probabilities, averaging
across the independent variables. All statistical analyses in-
corporate weights to account for differential probabilities of
sample selection and survey nonresponse and to assure that
the distributions of our sample resemble those of the target
population.15

Hosmer-Lemeshow tests did not indicate significant lack
of fit; the χ2 statistics from these tests ranged from 3.4 to 9.9
across models and imputations (range, P = .27 to .90). Alter-
native specifications of the decision satisfaction measure look-
ing at different cutoffs or treating it as a continuous variable
showed no significant differences in model results. No signifi-
cant interactions were found between any of the indepen-
dent variables.
Discussion
Inthislargediversepopulation-basedsampleofpatientsnewly
diagnosed as having breast cancer, about half with unilateral
disease considered CPM. Among these patients, about one-
quarter reported that their first surgeon recommended against
CPM, and one-third reported that CPM was not substantively
discussed with their surgeon(s). There were no significant dif-
ferences in the likelihood of CPM recommendation by socio-
demographic factors except for geographic location. Geo-
graphic variation in surgeon recommendation may suggest
differences in practice network factors with regard to how sur-
geons approach communication about CPM. Both surgeon rec-
ommendation against CPM and lack of a substantive discus-
sion were associated with patient dissatisfaction with the
surgery decision. The additive effect was modest: nearly 15%
of patients were dissatisfied with the surgery decision pro-
cess when a first surgeon recommended against CPM but there
was no substantive discussion about it (vs 4% in patients who
did not receive a recommendation against CPM but had a dis-
cussion about it). However, only about 15% of patients re-
ported this circumstance. Second opinions about surgery were
not common (15.7%) and surgery performed by a second sur-
geon even less so (8.1%). First-surgeon recommendation
against CPM was not associated with the frequency of second
opinion or patient receipt of surgery by a second surgeon. Fur-
thermore,therewerenosubstantivesociodemographicorclini-
cal correlates of second opinions or receipt of surgery from a
second surgeon.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that examined
the nature of physician-patient discussions about CPM and

 patient reactions to surgeon recommendations regarding elec-
tive CPM. Published studies have documented the growth in
receipt of CPM in the United States over the last decade,6,18-21
and a few have addressed patient factors driving preferences
for more extensive surgery.2 Other studies have examined sur-
geonperspectivesbuttheyhavebeenlimitedbysmallsamples,
low response rates, or non-US practice settings.22,23
Strengths and Limitations
Some aspects of our study methods merit comment. The study
was a large population-based survey in a diverse sample with
a high survey response rate. We used weights and multiple im-
putation techniques to reduce nonresponse bias. Patient re-
port of treatment deliberation and experiences were ascer-
tained shortly after surgery. We were conservative with regard
to specification of the main measures. For example, patients
hadtoindicatethatnoneofthe5CPMtreatmenttradeoffswere
discussed to be characterized as not having a substantive dis-
cussion.Furthermore,weperformedsensitivityanalysestoas-
sure that main findings based on a priori decisions were ro-
bust for different specifications of key variables and different
approaches to analyses. However, there were some limita-
tions. Surgeon communication was reported by patients and

 lation-based survey was necessarily retrospective. In particu-
lar, we evaluated strength of consideration of CPM after treat-
ment, which may have been influenced by deliberations and
the surgical treatment ultimately performed. We had little
information about potential barriers to discussion or care by
second surgeons, which may have affected our findings. Fi-
nally, results are limited to 2 large regions of the United States.
Conclusions
SurgeonsfaceagrowingneedtoaddresspatientinterestinCPM
for treatment of breast cancer. Communicating with patients
about CPM is difficult because patient preferences are moti-
vated by complex intuitive and affective reactions that may be
difficult to elicit and address in a visit where a myriad of treat-
ment options and potential outcomes need to be discussed.
Under these circumstances, surgeons may not feel com-
pelled to initiate a discussion of CPM or proactively make
recommendations in women with no medical indication for
the procedure in an effort to optimally facilitate patient par-
ticipation in a complicated treatment decision process. Our
findings are largely reassuring in that most patients are satis-
fied with surgical decision making and that first-surgeon rec-
ommendation against CPM does not appear to substantively
increase patient dissatisfaction or increase use of second opin-
ions or loss of the patient to a second surgeon. However, the
proportion of patients reporting a recommendation against
CPM by their first surgeon was modest. The consequences of
a greater number of surgeons advising against CPM are un-
known, especially in women who strongly desire the proce-
dure. For patients who remain uncertain about the benefits
of CPM, a second opinion may be an appropriate source of
additional information. Research is needed to develop and
evaluate both decision tools for patients and training oppor-
tunities for surgeons that can facilitate these very important
clinical encounters concerning challenging treatment deci-
sion issues.
