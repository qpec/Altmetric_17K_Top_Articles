Osteosarcoma occurs predominantly in children and young adults.
High-grade tumors require multidisciplinary treatment consisting of
chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, along with
surgical intervention. Despite this approach, death from respiratory
failure secondary to the development and progression of pulmonary
metastases remains a significant problem. Here, we identify the IL-11
receptor α subunit (IL-11Rα) as a cell surface marker of tumor pro-
gression that correlates with poor prognosis in patients with osteo-
sarcoma. We also show that both IL-11Rα and its ligand, IL-11, are
specifically up-regulated in human metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines;
engagement of this autocrine loop leads to tumor cell proliferation,
invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Consistently,
IL-11Rα promotes lung colonization by human metastatic osteosar-
coma cells in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model. Finally, we evaluate
the IL-11Rα–targeted proapoptotic agent bone metastasis-targeting
peptidomimetic (BMTP-11) in preclinical models of primary intratibial
osteosarcomas, observing marked inhibition of both tumor growth
and lung metastases. This effect was enhanced when BMTP-11 was
combined with the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. Our com-
bined data support the development of approaches targeting IL-
11Rα, and establish BMTP-11 as a leading drug candidate for clinical
translation in patients with high-risk osteosarcoma.

O
steosarcoma is a tumor of bone with peak incidence oc-
curring at age 10–20 y (1). Over the past quarter century,
the 5-y survival rate has remained stagnant at ∼60–65% for patients
with primary osteosarcoma and ∼20–25% for patients with meta-
static disease (2), with few therapeutic options available. The current
standard of care for high-grade osteosarcoma is an aggressive
combination of high-dose methotrexate with doxorubicin (Adria-
mycin) and cisplatin (MAP) in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant
settings, complemented by surgery when possible (2). Systemic
treatment options have remained unchanged for the last 30 y. With
the exception of mifamurtide (3, 4), which has been approved for
use in the European Union and Israel—but, unfortunately, not the
United States—the pipeline of cytotoxic drugs against osteosar-
coma has essentially been dry. Recently, the EURAMOS-1 clinical
trial demonstrated that the addition of ifosfamide plus etoposide to
standard MAP (MAPIE) did not affect overall survival in patients
with poor response (defined as ≤90% tumor necrosis to induction
therapy), whereas PEGylated IFN alfa-2b maintenance provided
only a modest (nonsignificant) improvement in the event-free sur-
vival of patients with good response (5).
The widespread use of gemcitabine in sarcoma management,
along with encouraging initial reports of gemcitabine plus
docetaxel (GEMDOX) in pediatric osteosarcoma, prompted a
formal evaluation in clinical trials. Despite some controversy,
this regimen has been recently reported as somehow active
against relapsed and unresectable high-grade tumors (6).
Promisingly, the addition of bevacizumab, an anti-vascular en-
dothelial growth factor A antibody, to paclitaxel and gemcitabine
(TAG) seems to improve the efficacy of GEMDOX in very high-
risk osteosarcomas (7). Moreover, a few biological agents are
also being evaluated in clinical trials, including monoclonal
antibodies against insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, angio-
genesis inhibitors such as sorafenib and pazopanib, small-
molecule inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin
such as temsirolimus and everolimus, and immune checkpoint
inhibitors (8–10).
Significance
In its metastatic/recurrent presentation, osteosarcoma is a
high-risk tumor with poor management, essentially unchanged
over the past 25 years. Osteosarcoma is a relatively rare cancer;
however, because it affects predominantly teenagers and young
adults, it is a leading disease-related cause of death and a major
contributor to years of life lost in this age group. Here, we
demonstrate the prognostic value of IL-11Rα in osteosarcoma
progression and patient survival. We also report preclinical
studies
with the
IL-11Rα–targeted
peptidomimetic
bone
metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic (BMTP-11) as a thera-
peutic agent, either alone or in combination with gemcita-
bine, in both primary tumor and metastatic disease models.
This study demonstrates successful applications directed
against the IL-11Rα:IL-11 molecular axis in preclinical models
of osteosarcoma.

MEDICAL SCIENCES
 In previous work, our research group (11) and other investigators
(12–14) have independently demonstrated that the IL-11:IL-11Rα
axis regulates a downstream program through the signal transduction
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in bone tumors, such as
primary osteosarcoma and nonosteosarcoma bone metastasis.
Within this context, here we evaluate the activity of an IL-11Rα–
targeted agent, bone metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic (BMTP)-
11, as a potential drug candidate against osteosarcoma. We dem-
onstrate that IL-11Rα is overexpressed in osteosarcoma tumor cells
and is functionally relevant in osteosarcoma progression, and that
BMTP-11 delays the growth of both primary tumors and lung me-
tastases in preclinical orthotopic models of human osteosarcoma,
with improved efficacy when combined with gemcitabine. Taken
together, our experimental findings establish the IL-11:IL-11Rα
pathway as a functionally active axis for therapeutic intervention in
human osteosarcoma, and provide preclinical proof of concept for
evaluation of BMTP-11 in first-in-human clinical trials.
Results and Discussion
IL-11Rα Expression Increases During Metastatic Progression and
Correlates with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Osteosarcoma. The
patterns and levels of IL-11Rα expression in human osteosar-
coma were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tis-
sue microarray (TMA) prepared with surgical specimens of primary
tumors (n = 18) and lung metastases (n = 27). Staining was ana-
lyzed as both signal intensity (on a scale of 0–4) and distribution
(proportion of IL-11Rα–positive cells ranked on a scale of 0–4).
Lung metastases showed a significantly higher IL-11Rα mean in-
tensity score (2.8 vs. 1.8, P < 0.01; Fig. 1A) compared with the
primary tumors, as well as a trend toward more IL-11Rα–positive
cells (2.9 vs. 2.5, P = 0.06; Fig. 1B). Thus, in osteosarcoma patients,
metastases express higher levels of IL-11Rα than primary tumors.
This finding extends previous investigations supporting the validity
of IL-11Rα as a biomarker in high-risk osteosarcomas (11, 13) and
in bone metastases from other tumors (12, 15).
In the present study, survival data were available for subsets of
patients with primary osteosarcoma (n = 14) and lung metastasis
(n = 15). For correlation studies, patients with primary osteo-
sarcoma were sorted into two groups with a low (<2) or high
(≥2) IL-11Rα intensity score. Lower 10-y survival (17% vs. 63%)
was observed in the high-intensity group (Fig. 1C); the difference
between groups was calculated by Cox’s F test (P = 0.056) and
the log-rank test (P = 0.15). Correlation studies performed on
IL-11Rα distribution (≤2 vs. ≥3) confirmed a similar trend, with
a 10-y overall survival of 29% in the high-distribution group,
compared with 52% in the low-distribution group (Fig. 1D).
These results show that patients with higher levels of IL-11Rα in
their primary tumor cells have a worse prognosis compared with
patients with lower levels of IL-11Rα.
For lung metastasis, there were no discernable differences in
overall patient survival based on either the distribution or the in-
tensity of IL-11Rα staining. This negative result is not unexpected,
given that all patients with metastatic disease share a poor prognosis
and short overall survival. A relatively small cohort of patient
samples, such as that analyzed in the present study, is expected
given the rare incidence of osteosarcoma (1). This caveat notwith-
standing, our results suggest that IL-11Rα expression increases with
tumor progression and is inversely correlated with overall survival.
An IL-11Rα:IL-11 Autocrine Loop Is Up-Regulated in Human Metastatic
Osteosarcoma Cell Lines. Having demonstrated that IL-11Rα is an
osteosarcoma biomarker related to disease progression and prog-
nosis in patients, we next sought to investigate its functional role.
We first evaluated IL-11Rα levels by flow cytometry in a panel of
human osteosarcoma cell lines that are either nonmetastatic (HOS,
MG63, CCH-OS-O, TE-85, and Saos-2) or metastatic (KRIB,
SJSA1, CCH-OS-D, and LM7) to the lungs in animal models. We
found a substantially higher proportion of osteosarcoma cells
expressing IL-11Rα on the surface in all of the metastatic cell lines
compared with the nonmetastatic cell lines (Fig. 2A). This finding
was paralleled by an increase in mRNA levels, as quantified by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that IL-11Rα is
regulated at the transcriptional level in osteosarcoma cell lines.
We next quantified the levels of the IL-11Rα ligand IL-11 in
conditioned media from the same cell lines by ELISA. Compared
with nonmetastatic cells, increased levels of IL-11 were secreted by
virtually all metastatic cell lines, with the exception of CCH-OS-D
(Fig. 2C). This increase was also paralleled at the mRNA level (Fig.
2D). Some other negative control cytokines [i.e., granulocyte mac-
rophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)] were not
overexpressed in metastatic vs. nonmetastatic human osteosarcoma
cell lines, as evaluated by multiplex ELISA (Meso Scale Discovery)
(Fig. S1). Taken together, these data reveal the specific up-
regulation of an IL-11Rα:IL-11 autocrine loop in human meta-
static osteosarcoma cell lines, further supporting a functional role
for IL-11Rα in the progression of human osteosarcoma.
IL-11Rα Signaling Is Necessary for Human Metastatic Osteosarcoma Cell
Proliferation, Invasion, and Anchorage-Independent Growth. IL-11 in-
duces a signaling cascade that leads to STAT3 activation by phos-
phorylation (12, 13). Therefore, we evaluated whether STAT3 could

of 18 primary osteosarcomas and 27 lung metastases immunostained for IL-11Rα, specific IHC signals were scored on both intensity (A) and distri-
bution (B). Patient specimens were stratified based on their intensity (C) or distribution (D) score. Kaplan–Meier survival plots were drawn including
both complete and censored data for all available patients (n = 14 primary osteosarcomas), and correlations were analyzed by Cox’s F test and the log-
rank test.

 be activated in exemplary nonmetastatic (HOS) and metastatic
(CCH-OS-D) human osteosarcoma cells on IL-11 stimulation.
CCH-OS-D cells were chosen because of the lower levels of IL-11
expressed and released in their conditioned culture medium
(Fig. 2 C and D), which avoids receptor activation by the endog-
enous ligand. Cells were incubated with recombinant human IL-11
(rhIL-11; 25 ng/mL for 5 min), and fractionated protein extracts
(total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear) were subjected to immunoblotting
with an anti-phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3 Tyr705) antibody.
In both cell lines, treatment with rhIL-11 induced approxi-
mately fourfold phosphorylation and specific nuclear accumu-
lation of STAT3 compared with the nuclear marker poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) (Fig. 3A). These data suggest
that IL-11Rα is functional in both nonmetastatic and metastatic
settings.
To obtain a cellular model with controlled IL-11Rα amounts and
functionality, we silenced IL-11Rα expression in KRIB cells, which
is another suitable metastatic osteosarcoma cell line because it
(i) expresses high levels of both IL-11Rα and IL-11 (Fig. 2), (ii) can
be easily transduced in vitro, and (iii) enables both in vitro and
in vivo experiments (16, 17). Silencing of IL-11Rα with two alter-
native shRNA constructs was confirmed by mRNA quantification
(Fig. 3B) and protein immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). A corresponding
decrease in pSTAT3 levels was observed, representative of the
functional impairment of downstream signaling (Fig. 3C).
We next evaluated nontransduced, control shRNA-transduced,
and IL-11Rα shRNA-transduced KRIB cells for metastasis-related
phenotypes, including cell invasion and growth in soft agar. Si-
lencing of IL-11Rα resulted in decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 3D)
and invasion both at the basal level and in response to 50 mg/mL
rhIL-11 (Fig. 3E). Consistently, IL-11Rα–silenced cells were less
able to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion and to form
colonies in soft agar in the presence of 50 mg/mL rhIL-11 (Fig. 3F).
Collectively, these data indicate that IL-11Rα specifically regulates
metastatic attributes in human osteosarcoma cells.
IL-11Rα Is Functionally Involved in Lung Colonization by Human
Osteosarcoma Cells in Preclinical Models. We next investigated the
functional role of IL-11Rα in vivo. To obtain an animal model of
human metastatic osteosarcoma, nontransduced, control shRNA-
transduced, and IL-11Rα shRNA-transduced KRIB cells were
transfected with a luciferase reporter gene cassette before ortho-
topic intratibial administration in cohorts of nude mice. Six weeks
later, lungs were explanted, and luciferase-expressing KRIB cells
were visualized in an ex vivo IVIS imaging system (Xenogen) (Fig.
4A). Quantification of luminescent signals (SI Results) revealed
decreased lung colonization by KRIB cells in which IL-11Rα had
been silenced with either shRNA compared with either parental or
control cells (Fig. 4B). This result was further confirmed by histo-
logical analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (Fig. 4C), as well
as quantification of micrometastatic foci in the lungs (Fig. 4D).
These data demonstrate that IL-11Rα functions in the process of
lung colonization during the secondary spread of human osteosar-
coma cells in vivo. Moreover, our results support the validity of this
orthotopic mouse model as a co-clinical trial surrogate of osteo-
sarcoma progression in patients.
The IL-11Rα–Targeting Drug BMTP-11 Inhibits Primary Tumor Growth
and Metastatic Spread of Human Osteosarcoma Cells in Preclinical
Models. We have previously designed and validated the tumor-
targeting small-molecule drug BMTP-11 (18), which consists of a
functional IL-11Rα–binding peptide (CGRRAGGSC) (15) fused
to the apoptosis-inducing peptidomimetic D(KLAKLAK)2 (19).
The antitumor activity of BMTP-11 has been previously evalu-
ated in preclinical models of solid tumors with propensity to
metastasize to bone, such as prostate cancer (20) and lung cancer
(21), and also in hematologic malignancies primarily originated
within the bone marrow cavity, such as leukemia (18); moreover,
we have recently reported a first-in-man clinical trial in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer (20).
Given our promising and consistent observations from tumor cell
lines, animal models, and human osteosarcoma specimens (11),
along with the data presented here, we also evaluated the preclinical
efficacy of BMTP-11 in a orthotopic model of human metastatic
osteosarcoma. At 2 wk postimplantation, nude mice with estab-
lished KRIB tumors were randomized (n = 5 mice per group) to
receive control (vehicle), the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine
i.p., BMTP-11 delivered either i.v. or intranasally, or BMTP-11 i.v.
plus gemcitabine i.p. twice weekly for 30 d. Tumor size was mea-
sured with calipers at days 7, 14, 20, 24, and 30. Tumor growth
(weight and volume) was inhibited on BMTP-11 or gemcitabine
treatment compared with the control group (Fig. 5 A–C). The
combination treatment BMTP-11 plus gemcitabine provided in-
creased efficacy compared with each single agent alone. FFPE tu-
mor sections were stained for either terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) or cleaved caspase-3
as apoptosis markers. We found increased apoptotic indexes
specifically in response to BMTP-11–based treatments (Fig.
5D). Metastatic spread to the lungs was also evaluated on
explanted tissues at the end of the experiment. BMTP-11–
based treatments resulted in significant decreases in the gross
macroscopic area (Fig. 5E) and number (Fig. 5F) of micro-
scopic pulmonary foci. Collectively, these data demonstrate the
efficacy of BMTP-11 in inducing apoptosis in osteosarcoma
cells, thus delaying primary tumor growth and secondary met-
astatic spread to the lungs.
We chose gemcitabine as a reference cytotoxic because it
was previously evaluated in patients with doxorubicin-resistant
osteosarcoma (22). Moreover, recent retrospective studies in
small cohorts of pediatric osteosarcoma patients indicate activity
of gemcitabine-based regimens as second- or later-line chemo-
therapy for very-high-risk (relapsed, metastatic, inoperable)

 tumors (6, 7). Given the synergy documented in the present
work, the use of gemcitabine as backbone for a chemother-
apeutic doublet with BMTP-11, or the potential development of a
three-drug regimen with the incorporation of a taxane such as
docetaxel (6, 23, 24), might be evaluated in the setting of MAP
failures or tumor recurrences.
Taken together, our findings in this work establish that targeting
the IL-11:IL-11Rα axis is a potential clinical strategy for therapeutic
intervention in osteosarcoma. Our findings further support the
value of BMTP-11 as prospective drug for treating osteosarcoma, in
addition to the preclinical and translational data for other more
common solid and hematologic tumors (18, 20, 21).

Impairment of in vitro functions of human osteosarcoma cells on silencing of IL-11Rα. (A) Evaluation of the IL-11Rα:IL-11 signaling pathway in
nonsilenced osteosarcoma cells was done by quantifying STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation in CCH-OS-D (metastatic) and HOS (nonmetastatic)
cell lines in response to rhIL-11 (25 ng/mL for 5 min). Fractionated protein extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705) antibody,
and band intensity was quantified by densitometry with ImageJ software. Staining for the nuclear marker PARP-1 served as an internal reference. (B and C)
KRIB cells were stably silenced by infection with two alternative shRNA lentiviral vectors, IL-11Rα shRNA1 and shRNA2, followed by quantification of IL-11Rα
mRNA by qPCR (B) and of protein by immunoblotting (C). Nonsilenced cells and cells silenced with control shRNA served as references. pSTAT3 levels were
assayed to confirm the impairment of IL-11Rα signaling in silenced cells. (D–F) All KRIB cell variants were challenged in proliferation (WST-1) (D), invasion
(Matrigel-coated transwells) in the basal condition or in the presence of rhIL-11 (50 ng/mL) (E), and colony-forming (soft agar) in vitro assays in the presence of
rhIL-11 (50 ng/mL) (F). In E and F, representative images are shown. (Original magnification: 5× in E; 10× in F.) In D, ***P < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA followed

 Methods
Cell Culture. HOS, MG-63, TE85, Saos-2, KRIB, and SJSA-1 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. CCH-OS-O and CCH-OS-D
were derived from patient specimens at the Children’s Cancer Hospital,
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (13), and the metastatic
LM7 cell line was developed by successive reimplants of Saos-2 cells through
the lungs of nude mice (17). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in
DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 mg/mL penicillin-streptomycin.
TMA Preparation and IHC. FFPE specimens of primary tumors (n = 18) and lung
metastases (n = 27) from the osteosarcoma database and hospital tumor registry
were used to build a TMA following the guidelines recommended by the Tissue
Array Research Program of the National Cancer Institute. This study adhered
strictly to current medical ethics recommendations and guidelines on human
research, and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Ethics
Service, Institutional Biohazard Committee, Clinical Research Committee, and
Institutional Review Board at each of the respective participating institutions. All
patients signed an informed consent prior to the beginning of the study. Four-
micrometer sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by heat with EDTA
(pH 8.0; Zymed), followed by biotin and protein blocking (Dako). EDTA was
chosen for its documented preservation of antigens even in the process of tissue
decalcification (25). Expression of IL-11Rα was evaluated with a rabbit anti–IL-
11Rα antibody (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:15 (vol/vol) and in-
cubated for 45 min, followed by development with the LSAB+ Kit (Dako).
Staining was evaluated by two independent pathologists and graded for both
intensity and distribution of staining as described previously (11).
Flow Cytometry. Cells were suspended in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) buffer consisting of PBS with 2% FBS, followed by incubation with 1 mg/mL
of either phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti–IL-11Rα antibody or isotype-
matched, PE-conjugated IgGs (Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing
in FACS buffer, cells were acquired with a FACSCalibur cell analyzer (BD Biosci-
ences), and analyzed with using CellQuest version 3.3 (BD Biosciences).
RNA Isolation and qPCR. Here, 1 μg of total RNA isolated with a Qiagen kit was
amplified with IL-11RA (Assay ID: Hs00234415_m1; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the
AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM 7500
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was calculated by the compara-
tive delta-delta cycle threshold (ΔΔCt) method, and cyclophilin A served as an en-
dogenous control reference.
Cytokine Quantification by ELISA. Conditioned media were collected from cells
grown in T-25 flasks and maintained for 24 h in serum-free medium, centrifuged
at 1,000 × g for 10 min, pooled, aliquoted, and frozen at −80 °C until use. Total
levels of secreted IL-11 protein were measured with the Quantikine ELISA Human
IL-11 Kit (R&D Systems). A cytokine panel including GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,
IL-10, IL-12, and TNFα was analyzed by multiplex ELISA (Meso Scale Discovery).
Generation of IL-11Rα–Silenced Cells and Luciferase-Expressing Cells. First,
293T cells were transfected with IL-11Rα–specific (GE Healthcare) and control
GIPZ lentiviral shRNA plasmids (Dharmacon), together with packaging vec-
tors, following the manufacturer’s instructions. At 48–72 h posttransfection,
viral particle-containing supernatants were collected, filtered through 0.45-μm-
pore filters, and used to infect KRIB cells in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene
(Sigma-Aldrich). After another 72 h, shRNA-transduced GFP-expressing cells
were separated by cell sorting with a BD FACSAria instrument (BD Biosci-
ences), and IL-11Rα silencing was confirmed by qPCR and immunoblotting.
To obtain luciferase-expressing cells for ex vivo imaging studies, KRIB cells
were transfected with a recombinant retroviral plasmid carrying a luciferase
gene cassette into a pLazarus vector (26).
Immunoblot Analysis. Osteosarcoma cells were treated with 25 ng/mL rhIL-11
(R&D Systems) for 5 min, followed by lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaF) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration was
determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Denatured samples were separated on 10% SDS/PAGE gels and blotted to ni-
trocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% (g/vol) nonfat milk in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (TBST). Primary anti-
bodies against IL-11Rα (Abcam); pSTAT3, STAT3, PARP-1, and α-tubulin (Cell
Signaling Technology); and β actin (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted in TBST con-
taining 2.5% (g/vol) nonfat milk and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing,
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:200 vol/vol; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 1 h at room temper-
ature. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with the SuperSignal West
Dura Extended Duration Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Band intensity was
quantified by densitometry with ImageJ software (27).
In Vitro Cell Assays. For proliferation assays, KRIB cells were grown in 24-well
plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and viability was evaluated
with WST-1 reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. For invasion assays, 8-μm Transwells were coated with Matrigel, and
KRIB cells were seeded onto the upper chamber in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS only (control) or with 50 ng/mL rhIL-11 in 10% FBS. After 48 h,
noninvaded cells were removed, and cells on the bottom side of the wells
were fixed in PBS containing 3% (g/vol) paraformaldehyde, stained with
crystal violet, photographed, and counted under a light microscope (Olympus).
To evaluate anchorage-independent growth, KRIB cells (5 × 104) were suspended
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and containing 0.3% (g/vol) agarose, and
then seeded into 12-well plates onto a solidified layer of 0.6% (g/vol) low-
melting-point agarose in DMEM. Cultures were maintained in DMEM supple-
mented with 10% FBS and containing 50 ng/mL rhIL-11. After 3 wk,
colonies ≥0.2 mm in diameter were counted and photographed with an
IMT-2 Olympus phase-contrast microscope.

 Detection of Apoptotic Cells in Experimental Tumor Tissues. Cleaved caspase-3
was detected by IHC on FFPE sections of explanted tumors. Antigen retrieval was
achieved in Borg Decloaker (BioCare Medical) at sub-boiling temperature, followed
by protein block with 4% (g/vol) fish gelatin in PBS. Staining was performed by
incubation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:100 vol/vol;
BioCare Medical), followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:1,000 vol/vol; Vector Laboratories). Signals were revealed with the LSAB+ Kit
(Dako) following Delco’s instructions. Cells were randomly scored and analyzed by
Sigma Plot software (28). A TUNEL assay was performed with the In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit (Roche) following Roche’s instructions. Tissue sections were
treated with proteinase K (10 μg/mL) for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, labeled,
and stained with the TUNEL reaction mixture (label plus enzyme solution) for
60 min at 37 °C. A negative control without enzyme and a positive control with
DNase I (3,000 U/mL) were also included. Slides were mounted in Vectashield
medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Apoptotic cells were counted with a
fluorescent microscope (Leica).
Preclinical Orthotopic Models. The animal experiments were in full compliance
with the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC) policies
and procedures, following standard guidelines for the care and use of lab-
oratory animals (29). Before initiation of experiments, all protocols and
procedures with animals were properly reviewed and approved by IACUC. The
5-wk-old male nu/nu (nude) mice were purchased from the National Cancer
Institute’s Frederick Cancer Research Facility and maintained in a pathogen-free
barrier animal facility approved by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. Animals were kept on a 12-h-light/dark cycle, with
standard rodent chow and water available ad libitum.
Intratibial implantation of osteosarcoma cells (11) was with KRIB cells at 80%
confluence after detaching with 0.25% (vol/vol) trypsin and 0.02% (g/vol) EDTA,
washing in serum-free medium, and resuspending in HBSS before injection (5 ×
104 cells/mouse) into the right tibia of nude mice. During all preimaging and
surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized (2.5% vol/vol isoflurane in O2 and
nembutal 50 mg/kg i.p., respectively), with temperature maintained at 38 °C
with a heat lamp.
Ex Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging. Mice were implanted with luciferase-
expressing KRIB variants (nontransduced, control shRNA- transduced, IL-11Rα
shRNA1– transduced, and shRNA2-transduced). At the endpoint, animals
were injected s.c. with 15 mg/mL luciferin potassium salt in PBS at 150 mg/kg
body weight. Ten minutes after luciferin injection, animals were killed
and lungs explanted. Ex vivo bioluminescence imaging was performed in
an IVIS 100 imaging system (Xenogen). A digital gray-scale image of the
explanted lungs and a pseudocolor image of photons produced by active
luciferase were analyzed with Living Image (Xenogen).
Preclinical Therapeutic Protocols. Mice were randomized when tumors reached
a volume of 4–5 mm3. BMTP-11 was administered either i.v. (300 μg/mouse in
100 μL of saline) or intranasally (300 μg/mouse in 15 μL of saline), and gemcitabine
was administered i.p. (120 μg/kg body weight in 200 μL of saline). Control mice
received saline on the same schedule (twice weekly for a total of 30 d). Primary
tumor growth was measured with a caliper at the indicated days postimplantation.
Mice were killed at day 30, and both primary tumors and lungs were explanted
and processed (FFPE) for histopathological analysis.
Statistics. Differences in IL-11Rα expression between sample groups from
patients in the TMA were evaluated by Student’s t test. Patient-derived
specimens were stratified based on their intensity or distribution score,
and Kaplan-Meier survival plots were drawn of both complete and censored
data. Given the relatively small numbers of patients tested, the study was
underpowered, and differences between groups were evaluated by Cox’s F
and log-rank tests. For in vitro and in vivo experiments, data were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s posttest and are presented as
mean ± SD of three independent experiments. A P value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with
Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software).
