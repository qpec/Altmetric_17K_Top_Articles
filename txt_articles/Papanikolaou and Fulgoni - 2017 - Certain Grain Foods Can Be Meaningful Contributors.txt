Abstract: Grain foods may play an important role in delivering nutrients to the diet of children and
adolescents. The present study determined grain food sources of energy/nutrients in U.S. children
and adolescents using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012.
Analyses of grain food sources were conducted using a 24-h recall in participants 2–18 years old
(N = 6109). Sources of nutrients contained in grain foods were determined using U.S. Department of
Agriculture nutrient composition databases and excluded mixed dishes. Mean energy and nutrient
intakes from the total diet and from various grain foods were adjusted for the sample design using
appropriate weights. All grains provided 14% ± 0.2% kcal/day (263 ± 5 kcal/day), 22.5% ± 0.3%
(3 ± 0.1 g/day) dietary fiber, 39.3% ± 0.5% (238 ± 7 dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/day) folate
and 34.9% ± 0.5% (5.6 ± 0.1 mg/day) iron in the total diet in children and adolescents. The current
analyses showed that certain grain foods, in particular breads, rolls and tortillas, ready-to-eat cereals
and quick breads and bread products, are meaningful contributors of folate, iron, thiamin, niacin and
dietary fiber, a nutrient of public health concern as outlined by the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans. Thus, specific grain foods contribute to nutrient density and have the potential to
increase the consumption of several under-consumed nutrients in children and adolescents.

1. Introduction
Mandatory folic acid fortification, commencing in 1998 by the Food and Drug Administration [1],
highlighted the importance of grains in the delivery of essential nutrients. Specific grain foods
becoming leading sources for folate with breads, rolls and crackers considered a leading contributor of
total folate to the U.S. diet representing 16% of total intake [2]. Data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003–2006, showed fortification of grain foods provides
nutrient adequacy for U.S. children and adolescents, without concern for excessive intakes for most
vitamins and minerals [3]. Recently, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015–2020 DGA)
recommended all individuals two years of age and older meet nutrient requirements through foods as
part of a nutrient-dense diet; however, many individuals fall short in several nutrients [4], resulting
in the declaration that several nutrients are under-consumed relative to the estimated average
requirement (EAR; the average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirements of
half of the healthy individuals in a group) or adequate intake levels established by the Institute of
Medicine [5]. The 2015–2020 DGA characterized under-consumed nutrients as shortfall nutrients
and included vitamins A, D, E, C, folate, calcium, magnesium, fiber, potassium and iron in specific

populations. Similar to the preceding policy and scientific advisory committee reports [6,7], the
2015–2020 DGA continues to highlight calcium, potassium, vitamin D and fiber as shortfall nutrients
of public health concern’ in Americans, including children, since under-consumption of these nutrients
has been associated with adverse health outcomes [4]. The nutrient shortfall is further exacerbated in
specific American subpopulations, including lower-income households and children of different
ethnicities relative to dietary recommendations [8–13]. An analysis of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 analysis identified significantly lower usual
nutrient intakes in both non-Hispanic black children and adults when compared to their non-Hispanic
white counterparts, such that non-Hispanic black children had lower intakes of calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, vitamins A and D [14].
Dietary recommendations advocate for greater whole grain consumption while limiting refined
grains in the diet. While certain grain food products contribute to nutrients to limit in the diet, including
added sugar and saturated fat [15,16], grain foods as a category, including refined grains, also provide
a range of positive nutrients, including dietary fiber, iron, magnesium and B vitamins (thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin and folate). Previous work using data from NHANES 2003–2006 showed that
grain foods provided meaningful contributions for dietary fiber, calcium, magnesium, iron, thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin and folic acid. Further, data from NHANES 2003–2006 in Americans aged ≥2 years
old identified that significant amounts of vitamins A, B6, B12, C and D, as well as thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, folate and iron were from enriched and/or fortified foods with the researchers concluding that
without enrichment and/or fortification, nutrient shortfalls are further exacerbated [17].
Taking into account the importance of nutrient recommendations for American children
and adolescents, the objective of the present analyses was to determine sources of energy and
nutrients in commonly-consumed grain foods in U.S. children and adolescents using data from
the NHANES, 2009–2012.
2. Experimental Section
The NHANES is a nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. non-institutionalized,
civilian residents. NHANES data are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants
or proxies, and the survey protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board at the National
Center for Health Statistics. Data from two NHANES datasets (2009–2010; 2011–2012) were combined
for the present analyses in children and adolescents [18,19] for age groups as established by the Food
and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine for the Dietary Reference Intakes (i.e., 1–3, 4–8, 9–13,
14–18 and 2–18 years old; [20]). Nutrient intake data for NHANES 2009–2012 are from the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS)
5.0 [21]. FNDDS is a database that provides the nutrient values for foods and beverages reported in
What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake component of NHANES. The WWEIA Food
Categories provide an application to analyze food and beverages as consumed in the American diet.
For the current analyses, each of the grain foods reported in WWEIA/NHANES is placed in one
of the mutually-exclusive food categories by linking each food code contained in FNDDS to one
WWEIA category [22]. This food code classification scheme includes approximately 150 unique food
categories. Mixed grain dishes were separated from the main grains group and are not included in the
current analyses.
In the present analyses, the combined sample included 6109 male and female participants,
2–18 years of age, who had reliable and complete 24-h dietary intake data from WWEIA.
2.1. Methods and Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA). SAS PROC SQL was used to create and prepare data for analyses. SAS PROC SURVEYMEANS
was used for all statistical calculations, including means and percentages. Survey weights were
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 160

used to generate nationally-representative estimates for U.S. children and adolescents, which were
adjusted for the complex sample design of NHANES. Mean and standard errors of energy, macro- and
micro-nutrients for the daily total diet and from food groups were determined. The mean percentage of
energy and nutrients provided by each grain food group was also determined. Meaningful sources of
energy and nutrients from the overall grain category and the various sub-categories of grain products
were defined as an energy or nutrient contribution of ≥10 percent of the total diet per day. A red
solid line was incorporated in all figures to indicate the percentage of energy provided by the food
category of interest. Those nutrients above the red line show that the food category provides a higher
percentage in the diet relative to energy, thus indicating nutrient density.
3. Results
In addition to an all grains category, six main grain food groups were identified from NHANES
and categorized by mean gram weight consumption in the total diet (Table 1).

The various grain food sources of energy and nutrients for various age groups are shown in
Figures 1–30. Age ranges were chosen as established by the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of
Medicine for Dietary Reference Intakes (i.e., 1–3, 4–8, 9–13 and 14–18 years old; [23]). Energy and
twenty-four nutrients are listed from all grain foods and various subsets within commonly-consumed
grain foods (i.e., breads, rolls, tortillas; ready-to-eat cereals; cooked grains; quick breads; and sweet
bakery products), which include nutrients to limit and encourage in the daily diet as outlined by
dietary guidance [4]. A red solid line was incorporated in all figures to indicate the percentage of
energy provided by the grain food category of interest. For nutrients above the red line, the grain food
category can be considered as contributing to nutrient density.
3.1. All Grain Foods: Sources of Energy and Nutrients
The percentage of total energy and nutrients provided from the total grain food category, excluding
mixed grain dishes, can be seen in Figure 1. While approximately 16% of sodium, 14% of energy, 8% of
total sugar, 7.6% of total fat and 5.4% of saturated fat were sourced from grains in the daily diet, grain
foods also provided approximately nearly a quarter of total dietary fiber per day (22.5%). Grain foods
also provided approximately 39.3% of dietary folate, 34.8% of iron, 16.4% of vitamin A and 13.7% of
magnesium on a daily basis, all nutrients identified as shortfall nutrients by the 2015–2020 DGA. Thus,
considering all grains only make up 5.18% of the mean gram weight of the total diet (see Table 1),
a meaningful nutrient density profile is apparent for 14% of total energy in the diet, in addition to
delivering several 2015–2020 DGA shortfall nutrients.

The percentage of total dietary intake of energy and nutrients provided from sweet bakery 
products can be seen in Figure 26. When considering nutrients to limit, the sweet bakery grains (i.e., 
cakes, cookies, pies, etc.) provided meaningful amounts for several nutrients to limit for 6.8% of total 
energy including, 8.1% of total fat, 7.8% of saturated fat and 8.0% of total sugar in the daily diet. In 
addition, sweet bakery grains contributed modestly to nutrients to encourage and had a smaller 
contribution to sodium compared with the percent of total energy: 5.0% of dietary fiber, 6.3% of folate, 
7.8% of iron, 5.1% of thiamin, 4.2% of niacin, 4.0% of riboflavin and 7.1% of vitamin E, as well as 4.0% 
of sodium with negligible contributions of magnesium, zinc, potassium and vitamins A, B12 and B6.

4. Discussion  
The present analysis determined the contributions of all grain foods and specific grain food 
groups for energy (calories) and nutrients to the diet of American children and adolescents and 
provides evidence that certain grain foods are meaningful contributors to several shortfall nutrients 
as identified by the 2015–2020 DGA. All grain products contributed 14% or 263 kcal per day in the 
total diet of children and adolescents. When considering nutrients to limit as outlined by dietary 
guidance, grain foods contributed 7.6% total fat, 5.4% saturated fat, 15.9% sodium and 8% total sugar. 
Similarly, when considering nutrients to encourage (i.e., shortfall nutrients), grain foods are 
meaningful contributors of nutrient density. Additionally, breads, rolls, tortillas and ready‐to‐eat 
cereals are meaningful contributors of dietary fiber, thiamin, folate, iron, zinc and niacin, while some 
grain foods alone provide minimal contributions to the diet, including sweet bakery products. 
Cumulatively, a variety of grain food groups consumed by American children and adolescents 
contribute to nutrient density in the total diet and should be encouraged as part of a healthy  
dietary pattern.

While the grain food category contributed energy, total fat, saturated fat, total sugar and sodium,
grain foods also provided a substantial contribution for folate, iron and magnesium per day, all of
which are under-consumed nutrients in U.S. children and adolescents. The examination of enriched
and fortified foods on nutrient intakes using NHANES data in children and adolescents has previously
shown that without fortification and enrichment, 20% of the U.S. population would fall below the
EAR for iron, with this percentage being lowered to approximately 6% when including enriched and
fortified foods. Likewise, the contribution of enriched and fortified foods to riboflavin and niacin
showed a meaningful contribution of these foods in the diets of U.S. children and adolescents [17].
The most robust effects of enrichment and fortification practices were seen with thiamin and folic
acid nutrients typically added to grain foods. Indeed, without enrichment and fortification, 50% of
the U.S. population would have inadequate intakes compared with only 5% when enrichment and
fortification is included in the analysis. Similarly, for folic acid, when not considering mandatory
and discretionary enrichment and fortification, nearly 90% of Americans would have inadequate
intake versus only 10% with enriched and fortified food consumption, thus showcasing the relevance
of enrichment and fortification practices in reducing the percentage of the population below the
EAR for nutrients routinely sourced from grains [17,24]. Similarly, our analyses showed that all
grain foods are meaningful contributors of nutrients of public health concern as outlined by the
2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including dietary fiber and calcium. Our current analyses
also assessed the sources of energy and nutrients from specific grain foods, of which included breads,
rolls, tortillas and ready-to-eat cereals. While breads, rolls and tortillas contributed less than 10%
of all sodium (7.7%), total fat (3.1%) and saturated fat (2.2%), breads, rolls and tortillas provided
higher than 10% for dietary fiber (12%), folate (14.2%) and iron (11.7%). Similarly, ready-to-eat cereals
provided minimal daily contributions of energy (3.3%), sodium (3.0%), total sugar (4.0%), total fat
(1.2%) and saturated fat (0.9%), but meaningful contributions of folate (18.2%), iron (16.6%), thiamin
(12.3%), vitamin B12 (13.0%), vitamin A (11.7%), niacin (12.5%) and zinc (10.3%). Thus, the nutrient
contribution of whole and refined grain food products, including breads, rolls, tortillas and ready-to-eat
cereals, can play a key role in helping American children and adolescents meet recommendations
for under-consumed nutrients and dietary fiber, a nutrient of public health concern [4]. Our work
is aligned with previously-reported data where researchers showed that while three of the top 10
sources of energy provided no nutritional value, the remaining sources of energy, including milk,
beef, poultry, cheese and baked goods were significant contributors of nutrients of concern and
other essential nutrients, and thus, eliminating these foods from food patterns could potentially have
inadvertent effects on diet quality in the U.S. population [16]. While certain grain food products,
including cooked grains, quick breads and bread products, provided minimal nutrient contributions,
these grain categories also provided minimal energy density in the diet of children and adolescents,
which is also an important aspect of current dietary guidance. Furthermore, these grain products
tend to be consumed with nutrient-dense milk and milk products (i.e., cooked grains/quick breads
and dairy products); thus, particular grain foods may serve as vehicles for nutrient-dense food group
consumption in children and adolescents. Future research considering this notion would add value to
the currently available literature.
While several key nutrients are under-consumed and falling short of recommendations in all U.S.
children and adolescents, further research may need to focus on populations at greater risk for nutrient
inadequacy. In a recent NHANES 2007–2010 analyses from our group [14], we identified significantly
lower usual nutrient intakes in both non-Hispanic black children and adults when compared to
their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Specifically in children, we observed that non-Hispanic
black children had lower intakes of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and vitamins A and D, in
comparison to non-Hispanic white children. While nutrient inadequacy was apparent in children
of all ethnicities examined, the prevalence of inadequate intake exceeded 25% of the population for
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and vitamins A, D and E in non-Hispanic black children relative to
their white counterparts. Thus, specific populations may further benefit from including both whole
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 160
18 of 20
and refined grain foods, in combination with other nutrient-dense foods (i.e., dairy, fruits, vegetables,
lean protein) in their diet to help close gaps in under-consumed nutrients and nutrients of public
health concern.
The current analyses have a limitation inherent in observational research.
The results are
dependent on self-reported dietary data for foods, which may involve study participants under- or
over-estimating food consumption, leading to inaccuracies in energy and nutrient intakes. Data
were also obtained using a 24-h dietary recall, which relies on study participant memory, and while
validated methods are used to gather the data, recall information is subject to inaccuracies and bias
from memory challenges and other potential measurement errors experienced in epidemiological
investigations using large datasets [25]. Caution should be administered when comparing the current
findings to previous studies, as food groupings can impact sources of energy and nutrient outcomes,
specifically where there are differences in the level of aggregation (i.e., the number of food groups)
or disaggregation methods used by researchers. A significant benefit of using NHANES data for
the current analyses includes access to a large and nationally-representative dataset of children and
adolescents in the U.S. and corresponding food and nutrient intake data.
5. Conclusions
Despite authoritative recommendations to increase specific nutrients in the U.S. population
through food consumption, children and adolescents are falling short of reaching several nutrient
recommendations. Our current analyses show that cumulatively, a variety of grain food groups
consumed by American children and adolescents help contribute to nutrient density in the total
diet. While grain foods as a category are contributors of energy, total fat and sodium in the U.S. diet,
grain foods are also contributors of the 2015–2020 DGA under-consumed nutrients and nutrients
of public health concern [4], including dietary fiber, folate, magnesium, calcium and iron. When
considering sub-categories of grain foods, breads, rolls, tortillas and ready-to-eat cereals are meaningful
contributors (i.e., ≥10% in the diet) of dietary fiber, thiamin, folate, iron, zinc and niacin to the American
diet of children and adolescents. Encouraging certain grain food patterns in the diets of children
and adolescents, including selecting a mix of enriched and fortified grains, may improve nutrient
intakes and minimize gaps in shortfall nutrient intakes. In contrast, eliminating grains, including both
whole and refined grains, from the diet may lead to unintended nutrient consequences. Therefore,
dietary strategies that aim to stay within calorie needs and recommendations while monitoring
nutrients to limit (i.e., added sugars, sodium and saturated fat) can benefit from the inclusion of several
refined and whole grain food products in the diet. A variety of grain food patterns, including those
recommended by dietary guidance and those that focus on enriched and fortified grain staples, can
provide a nutrient-dense variety of foods for children and adolescents while simultaneously helping
to meet authoritative nutrient recommendations in this population. Future research must consider
repeating the current analysis in different U.S. populations, including adults, children and adolescents
of different ethnicities and age groups.
