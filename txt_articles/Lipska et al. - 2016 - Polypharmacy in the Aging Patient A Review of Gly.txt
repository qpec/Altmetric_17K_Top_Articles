Abstract
IMPORTANCE—There is substantial uncertainty about optimal glycemic control in older adults 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
OBSERVATIONS—Four large randomized clinical trials (RCTs), ranging in size from 1791 to 
11440 patients, provide the majority of the evidence used to guide diabetes therapy. Most RCTs of 
intensive vs standard glycemic control excluded adults older than 80 years, used surrogate end 
points to evaluate microvascular outcomes and provided limited data on which subgroups are most 
likely to benefit or be harmed by specific therapies. Available data from randomized clinical trials

 suggest that intensive glycemic control does not reduce major macrovascular events in older adults 
for at least 10 years. Furthermore, intensive glycemic control does not lead to improved patient-
centered microvascular outcomes for at least 8 years. Data from randomized clinical trials 
consistently suggest that intensive glycemic control immediately increases the risk of severe 
hypoglycemia 1.5- to 3-fold. Based on these data and observational studies, for the majority of 
adults older than 65 years, the harms associated with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target lower than 
7.5% or higher than 9% are likely to outweigh the benefits. However, the optimal target depends 
on patient factors, medications used to reach the target, life expectancy, and patient preferences 
about treatment. If only medications with low treatment burden and hypoglycemia risk (such as 
metformin) are required, a lower HbA1c target may be appropriate. If patients strongly prefer to 
avoid injections or frequent fingerstick monitoring, a higher HbA1c target that obviates the need 
for insulin may be appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—High-quality evidence about glycemic treatment in 
older adults is lacking. Optimal decisions need to be made collaboratively with patients, 
incorporating the likelihood of benefits and harms and patient preferences about treatment and 
treatment burden. For the majority of older adults, an HbA1c target between 7.5% and 9% will 
maximize benefits and minimize harms.
Older patients with diabetes are increasingly common in clinical practice due to the aging 
US population, the decreased mortality rates among persons with diabetes, and the obesity 
epidemic.1,2 Among US residents aged 65 years and older, 10.9 million (26.9%) had 
diabetes in 20103 and this number is projected to increase to 26.7 million by 2050.4 The 
majority (> 95%) of older adults with diabetes have type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function both contribute to the pathogenesis of type 
2 diabetes in older adults.5,6 Aging is associated with accumulation of fat in muscle and liver 
tissues and reduced rates of mitochondrial activity in muscle and brain, contributing to 
insulin resistance.7,8 Along with these changes, aging is associated with defects in insulin 
secretion, which further contribute to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes.9–12
In older adults, classic symptoms of diabetes, such as polyuria, and polydipsia, may be 
absent. Instead, diabetes may present with dehydration, confusion, incontinence, and 
diabetes complications, such as neuropathy or nephropathy. Typically, the disease is 
asymptomatic and usually diagnosed based on routinely performed laboratory studies (Box 
1).13,15
The criteria for diagnosis are the same for younger and older adults.13 They are based on 
plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) thresholds that increase the risk of developing 
retinopathy.15 Incident diabetes among older compared with younger adults more often 
manifests as postprandial rather than fasting hyperglycemia.16 Measurement of HbA1c is 
often more convenient than obtaining a fasting plasma glucose, but there are some clinical 
conditions common in older persons, such as chronic kidney disease or anemia, that may 
restrict the ability of HbA1c to accurately reflect average glycemia.14
In adults older than 70 years, the nonfatal diabetes complications with the highest incidence 
rates include congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease.17

 However, among older patients with duration of diabetes of 10 years or more, rates of acute 
hypoglycemic events and eye disease slightly exceed rates of cerebrovascular disease and 
approximate those of coronary artery disease.17 Therefore, both the risk of diabetes 
complications and the risk of therapy resulting in hypoglycemia become critically important 
to consider when setting therapeutic goals.
The goals of treatment of type 2 diabetes are to improve symptoms (if present), reduce the 
risk of acute and chronic diabetes complications, and minimize harms and burdens of 
therapy. Glycemic control has been the central focus of diabetes care for decades18–23 and is 
the primary subject of this review. Randomized trials have shown that intensive glycemic 
control may lower the risk of some long-term complications (ie, microvascular disease18,19) 
but increase the risk of harm (ie, hypoglycemia18–23).
Decisions about glycemic treatment involve trade-offs between these possible benefits 
versus the potential harms and burdens of treatment. For some persons, the benefits of tight 
glycemic control may outweigh the harms. For others, the harms may be more important 
than the benefits. Recent guidelines on glucose-lowering treatment of older adults 
acknowledge that the likelihood of benefits and harms varies across patient subgroups and 
endorse individualized glycemic targets.13,24–28 However, there is substantial uncertainty 
about how to individualize glycemic targets and treatment plans for older adults with 
multiple comorbidities and risk factors. The goal of this article is to synthesize the available 
evidence and provide clinicians practical information to guide discussions about glycemic 
treatment with these vulnerable patients.
Methods
We used the Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for intensive glycemic 
control to identify studies from inception of the included databases through 2012. Using the 
same search strategy as the Cochrane review, we searched MEDLINE to identify additional 
studies published between January 2013 and June 2015. We included randomized, double-
blind trials with more than 100 participants in each group with type 2 diabetes, with at least 
2 years of follow-up after randomization, with prespecified cardiovascular and 
microvascular outcomes, and with follow-up of 90% or more of randomized participants for 
vital status(eTable 1 in the Supplement).We also determined how many of these trials 
included patients aged 80 years or older.
We used the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association(ACC/
AHA)methods29 to assess the strength of the evidence on the benefits and harms of glucose-
lowering treatment based on the obtained data. The goal was to provide information that 
would help an older patient better understand what to expect from glucose-lowering 
treatment, what the benefits and harms are, and in what time frame benefits and harms are 
most likely. Moreover, in order to make an informed decision, the patient needs to 
understand the strength of the evidence.

 Results
Glucose-Lowering Treatment in Older Adults—Deficiencies of the Evidence Base
The evidence about the benefits and harms of intensive vs standard glycemic control comes 
primarily from 4 large RCTs: UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS),18,19 Action to 
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial,22 Action in Diabetes and 
Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial,21 
and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT)20 as well as several meta-analyses30–34 (Table 
1). These landmark trials allocated glucose-lowering treatments in a randomized and 
concealed fashion and maintained balance across the 2 groups throughout follow-up, 
resulting in a relatively low risk of bias.36 The definitions of the outcomes in these trials are 
summarized in Box 2.
However, applying these data to questions of benefits and harms for older patients presents 
several challenges.
Trials Have Focused on Younger Patients—The mean age of participants in the 
major RCTs ranged between 53 and 66 years, and very few (if any) adults older than 80 
years were included (Table 1).37,38 One important reason for this underrepresentation is that 
intensive glycemic control in older patients raised safety concerns. Early on in the ACCORD 
trial, the data and safety monitoring board specifically recommended against further 
recruitment of participants older than 80 years because of frequent hypoglycemia observed 
in this group.39 Therefore, applying the results of the major RCTs to older adults is 
problematic.
Trials Have Focused on Surrogate End Points Rather Than Clinical Outcomes
—Clinical trials of glucose-lowering therapies often rely on intermediate or surrogate end 
points, such as albuminuria or worsening creatinine (Table 1). Although these end points are 
strongly associated with clinical outcomes such as dialysis or death due to renal failure, it 
often takes many years of albuminuria or worsening creatinine to lead to clinical outcomes. 
Because many older patients have limited life expectancy, the use of these intermediate end 
points may not be relevant.
Trials Provide Limited Data on Which Subgroups Are Most Likely to Benefit or 
Be Harmed—To make informed decisions, patients need individualized information on the 
relative benefits and risks of glycemic control. However, data about the likelihood of 
benefits and harms across large subgroups are currently limited. In both the ACCORD and 
ADVANCE studies, the effect of glycemic control on outcomes did not differ between 
younger and older (< 65 vs > 65 years) patients.21,39 In contrast, other subgroup analyses 
that explored whether intensive glycemic control is more beneficial in specific patient 
groups (ie, those with a history of microvascular disease, macrovascular disease, or < 15 
years of diabetes) yielded conflicting results.21,22,40
Few Studies on Which Medications Work Best for Which Patients—Clinicians 
and patients can now choose from 12 different classes of glucose-lowering agents, with 
many patients needing a combination of drugs. However, there are few comparative

 effectiveness outcomes studies to guide clinical practice, let alone guide practice for the 
oldest patients. Long-term clinical outcomes associated with the use of different medications 
are unknown. These deficiencies are particularly pronounced among higher-risk 
subpopulations, such as older adults and patients with underlying comorbid conditions.41 A 
summary of advantages and disadvantages of commonly used agents is presented in Table 2, 
and patient decision aids incorporating this information are available for use in clinical 
practice.50
Making Glycemic Treatment Decisions With Limited Evidence
Despite limited evidence, patients and clinicians must make decisions on how to manage 
hyperglycemia. We synthesized the available evidence and developed a 4-step approach to 
help patients and clinicians individualize glycemic treatment. For each step, we included a 
discussion of the quality of the available evidence based on the ACC/AHA criteria (eTable 2 
in the Supplement). In the following sections, intensive glycemic control is defined as an 
HbA1c value lower than 7%.
Estimate Benefits of Intensive Glycemic Control
Cardiovascular Benefits: The UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT trials showed 
that intensive glycemic control (HbA1c <7%; to convert HbA1c in percentage to mmol/mol, 
subtract 2.152 and then multiply by 10.93)35 did not significantly reduce major 
cardiovascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality) 
during each of these trials.18,20–22 Long-term, observational follow-up of trial participants 
showed reductions in major cardiovascular events associated with intensive glycemic control 
in the UKPDS,51 ACCORD,52 and VADT53 trials, but not in the ADVANCE trial.54 These 
reductions emerged after at least 10 years of follow-up and were not associated with 
improved mortality among ADVANCE54 and VADT53 trial participants. In the ACCORD 
trial, increased mortality was seen among intensively treated participants.55 Therefore, RCTs 
do not support intensive glycemic control to reduce major cardiovascular events in older 
adults, at least in the first 10 years of intervention. Because patients older than 80 years and 
those with other comorbidities were excluded from the trials, this conclusion may not apply 
to these patients (level B evidence).
Microvascular Benefits: The ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT trials did not show a 
significant effect of intensive treatment on clinical microvascular outcomes important to 
patients; however, multiple surrogate end points improved with intensive glycemic 
control.20–22 For example, the ADVANCE trial showed a 14% (95% CI, 3%-23%) relative 
risk reduction in the primary microvascular end point, which combined nephropathy and 
retinopathy composites. This risk reduction was driven by a reduction in nephropathy. In 
turn, the only component of the nephropathy composite that was significantly reduced was 
the development of macroalbuminuria (2.9% vs 4.1% in intensive vs standard groups, 
respectively; P <.001). In the ACCORD and VADT trials, intensive glycemic control did not 
significantly reduce the secondary microvascular end points that were not based on 
albuminuria.20,22,56

 In contrast, the UKPDS trial and its follow-up, which reflects medical practice common 
more than 20 years ago, showed a significant reduction in microvascular complications 
defined as a composite of photocoagulation, vitreous hemorrhage, and renal failure, ie, based 
on clinical outcomes important to patients.51 In the first 8 years of the trial, the control and 
intensive treatment groups had the same rates of microvascular complications, suggesting no 
benefits from intensive treatment. In years 8 to 15, the control and intervention group curves 
diverged, suggesting that the intervention group was starting to benefit based on decreased 
microvascular complications. Beyond 15 years, the 2 curves did not diverge further, 
suggesting there was little additional benefit. The absolute benefits were small—
microvascular events were reduced from 14.2 to 11.0 per 1000 patient-years.
Taken together, the results of these trials suggest that intensive glycemic control does not 
reduce microvascular outcomes important to patients, at least in the first 8 years of 
intervention. In contrast, there may be a small microvascular benefit that emerges after 8 to 
15 years of treatment, based on the UKPDS trial follow-up. However, it must be noted that 
the UKPDS trial results are not readily applicable to older patients with long-standing 
diabetes because UKPDS trial included younger patients with newly diagnosed disease. In 
addition, the RCTs used surrogate end points that do not directly apply to clinical outcomes 
(level B evidence).
Estimate Harms of Intensive Glycemic Control—All 4 major RCTs showed that 
intensive glycemic control increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia.18,20–22 Although both 
younger and older participants are at higher risk of severe hypoglycemia when randomized 
to .intensive glycemic control,57 the baseline risk of severe hypoglycemia (irrespective of 
trial group assignment) increases with age (hazard .ratio, 1.03 per each 1 year increase, P < .
001). For example, in the ACCORD trial, the annual risk of severe hypo-glycemia requiring 
medical assistance for participants younger than 65 years was 0.8% in the standard glycemic 
control group vs 2.4% in the intensive glycemic control group.22 For participants 75 years or 
older, the annual risk of severe hypoglycemia was much higher: 1.4% in the standard 
glycemic control group vs 5.3% in the intensive glycemic control group.58
Other data on harms associated with intensive glycemic control come primarily from 
epidemiologic analyses. Poor cognitive function has been associated with increased risk of 
severe hypoglycemia.59 In addition, age, duration of diabetes, use of multiple medications, 
frequent hospitalizations, and cognitive impairment (markers of underlying frailty) increase 
the risk of hypoglycemia.17,58,60–64 Furthermore, treatment with insulin is associated with 
the highest risk of hypoglycemia compared with other agents.63
Taken together, RCTs show that intensive glycemic treatment consistently increases the risk 
of hypoglycemia by 1.5- to 3-fold. Although the evidence is consistent and based on well-
designed RCTs, few older patients were included in these trials. However, results from 
observational studies support extending these results to older patients (level B evidence).
Establish an Individualized Glycemic Target That Maximizes Benefits but 
Minimizes Harms According to the Patient’s Values—Current evidence suggests 
that attempts to achieve intensive glycemic control will lead to net harm in the majority of

 older adults with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD study showed an increased risk of mortality 
for patients randomized to intensive glycemic control compared with the standard group.22 
As discussed above, all 4 major trials of intensive glycemic control showed that intensive 
glycemic treatment increases the rates of severe hypoglycemia compared with standard 
glycemic control,20–22 whereas the cardiovascular and microvascular benefits are uncertain 
for the majority of older adults. Furthermore, modeling studies, based on estimates of 
microvascular complications drawn from the UKPDS trial (ie, with the most optimistic 
estimates of benefit), suggest that the marginal benefits of decreasing HbA1c lower than 
7.5% are likely small.65,66 Thus, for the vast majority of older patients with diabetes, the 
harms associated with an HbA1c target lower than 7.5% likely outweigh the benefits.
There is wide consensus that HbA1c values higher than 9% should be avoided because they 
can lead to immediate symptoms.25 These symptoms include polyuria, which can occur at 
blood glucose levels above the renal threshold (>180–200 mg/dL), and may lead to 
dehydration. In addition, hyperglycemia may lead to fatigue, increased risk for infection, and 
cognitive impairment. For these reasons, HbA1c values higher than 9% may lead to harms. 
Most experts and guidelines suggest that HbA1c values higher than 9% should be avoided 
because of these risks, especially because an HbA1c below 9% can usually be safely 
achieved.13,24,25,27,28,67 Despite the consensus, there is remarkably little data to support it.
Modeling studies suggest that patient preferences are critically important in modulating the 
target HbA1c (within the 7.5%-9% range) because they influence the net benefit (or net 
harm) achieved from more vs less intensive glycemic control.66 Different patients place 
different value on avoiding specific burdens (eg, insulin treatment and fingerstick 
monitoring).66 An older patient with a life expectancy more than 15 years who perceives 
little burden from insulin injections may increase his or her chances of an improved quality 
of life with intensive glycemic control. In contrast, an older patient who expresses a strong 
desire to avoid burdensome treatments may experience reduced quality of life with more 
intensive treatment. Thus, patient preferences and values regarding treatments should play a 
major role in determining glycemic targets.
Finally, the type of treatment that is required to achieve a specific target significantly 
impacts the likelihood of benefits and harms. Lifestyle modification is unlikely to result in 
harm. Met form in is also considered safe but may cause adverse gastrointestinal effects. An 
HbA1c target lower than 7% may be reasonable for some patients with the use of this 
relatively safe medication. In contrast, insulin is associated with the highest risk of 
hypoglycemia68 compared with other agents and confers about a 2-fold increased risk 
compared with sulfonylurea treatment.63 Furthermore, insulin requires significant self-
management capacity, and insulin therapy can frequently result in treatment errors. Thus, for 
some older patients who are unable to achieve their glycemic target with oral medications, 
the appropriate response may be to discuss the trade-offs involved in the decision to start 
insulin rather than reflexively intensify treatment. Other harms or adverse effects of therapy 
(Table 2) may also influence the decision to modulate the glycemic target.
Therefore, based on RCTs and observational data, the harms associated with an HbA1c 
target lower than 7.5% or higher than 9% are likely to outweigh the benefits for the majority

 of older adults. A large part of the evidence is based on observational studies with a risk of 
bias. Some of the evidence is based primarily on expert opinion (level C evidence).
Minimize Polypharmacy—Most patients’ HbA1c levels increase over time, and patients 
and their clinicians must decide whether to intensify therapy. Decisions to de-intensify 
therapy must also be made when HbA1c levels decline, the risk of harms increases, or the 
treatment burden becomes unacceptable to the patient (Table 3).
Evidence for Diminishing Benefits With Polypharmacy
The first glucose-lowering medication, which is often started at higher HbA1c levels 
compared with the levels when the second agent is started, decreases HbA1c more than 
subsequent medications. Starting a second or third medication for glycemic control leads to 
smaller reductions in HbA1c than starting that same medication as monotherapy.69,70 For 
example, a meta-analysis of trials examining the efficacy of oral glucose-lowering agents 
showed that for patients with baseline HbA1c levels between 9.0% to 9.9%, oral agents 
decreased HbA1c levels by 1.0%. For patients with baseline HbA1c levels between 8.0% to 
8.9%, oral agents decreased HbA1c levels by only 0.6%; for patients with baseline HbA1c 
levels between 6.0% to 6.9%, the average reduction was only 0.2%.71
Evidence for Increasing Harms With Polypharmacy—Multiple studies have shown 
that polypharmacy increases the number of adverse drug events,72,73 including severe 
hypoglycemia,63,74 drug-drug interactions,75,76 interactions with coexisting comorbidities,77 
and patient costs.78 In addition, the higher the number of medications, the less likely the 
patient will remain adherent with the treatment regimen.79,80 Furthermore, diabetes 
treatments such as insulin and dietary restrictions impose burdens on patients with the 
consequence of decreased quality of life.81
Based on these data, in older patients with type 2 diabetes, increasingly intensive efforts to 
lower glucose levels with the use of multiple medications tend to be associated with 
diminishing benefits and greater risks of harm. Although there is consistent evidence with 
regards to harms of polypharmacy, the balance of benefits and harms has not been evaluated 
in RCTs (level C evidence).
Table 3 outlines circumstances when clinicians and patients should consider decreasing or 
stopping medications and how this can be done.
Discussion
Currently, older patients with diabetes and their clinicians must make decisions on how best 
to manage hyperglycemia with limited evidence. These decisions need to balance what is 
known about the benefits and harms of treatment but require extrapolating evidence from 
younger, healthier patients, resulting in substantial uncertainty. Furthermore, different 
patients place different values on possible outcomes of treatment. Because these trade-offs 
are complex and because the strategies to lower glucose levels require active engagement of 
patients with respect to adherence and lifestyle behaviors, there is an imperative to involve 
the patients in the process. A shared-decision-making process, in the course of which a

 patient and his/her clinician discuss and weigh the likely outcomes from different treatment 
options, can take into account the best available evidence, as well as the patient’s values and 
preferences about treatment.82,83
The Figure presents an approach to help older patients and their clinicians individualize 
glycemic treatment decisions. The process of shared decision making starts with 
establishment of a strong partnership that serves as the basis for exchange of information.84 
Estimation of life expectancy can help determine whether it is possible for a patient to 
realize the potential long-term benefits of intensive glycemic control. Several important 
patient-level factors such as the need for insulin, duration of diabetes, and cognitive 
impairment determine the likelihood of harms associated with treatment. Patient preferences 
should play a major role in determining the appropriate glycemic target.
In the following 4 clinical cases, we illustrate how our proposed decision-making framework 
can be applied to different older adults with diabetes.
Clinical Cases: Managing Glycemia in Older Patients
Case 1
Mrs K is 82 years old and functionally independent and has had a history of type 2 diabetes 
for the past 7 years. She has been treated with 1000 mg of metformin twice daily without 
any adverse effects. She also has dyslipidemia, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. 
Her HbA1c value is 7.6%, her creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL (to convert creatinine from 
mg/dL to µmol/L, multiply by 88.4) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
40 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Estimate Benefits—The lag time to benefit from intensive glycemic control is likely in 
the order of 10 years. Short-term benefits of reducing HbA1c to lower than 7.5% for her are 
unclear.
Estimate Harms—Addition of oral medications or insulin may increase treatment burden, 
risk of adverse effects (including hypoglycemia), treatment errors, and increase costs of care.
Individualize HbA1c Target—Current HbA1c is reasonable, pending a discussion with 
the patient regarding preferences for treatment. Focus should be on reducing risk of 
cardiovascular events with blood pressure and lipid control.
Minimize Polypharmacy—Although metformin is contraindicated in women with a 
creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL or higher, the risk of lactic acidosis appears to be very low.85 
Metformin monotherapy can be safely continued with more frequent monitoring of renal 
function (every 3–6 months depending on rate of decline) and at a reduced dose (500 mg 
twice daily).85 Because metformin has an excellent safety record and is not associated with 
either weight gain or hypoglycemia, it remains the first choice agent for treatment of type 2 
diabetes.

 Case 2
Mrs B is 85 years old and has type 2 diabetes of 10 years’ duration. She is functionally 
dependent, living in a nursing home, with moderate dementia (Mini-Mental State 
Examination score, 18), depression, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, history of 
falls, and urinary incontinence. She is taking metformin 500 mg twice daily, glipizide 10 mg 
twice daily, sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, and pioglitazone 15 mg once daily. Her HbA1c 
value is 7.1%. She has not had any known hypoglycemia.
Estimate Benefits—Benefits of intensive glycemic control are unclear in functionally 
dependent patients with limited life expectancy like Mrs B.
Estimate Harms—Mrs Btakes multiple medications and is at increased risk of falls and 
adverse effects from medications.
Individualize HbA1c Target—Her HbA1c target can be relaxed given her multiple 
comorbidities to reduce polypharmacy. It is reasonable for her HbA1c value to be in the 8% 
range. The discussion with patient and caregivers should focus on lack of benefits for 
intensive glycemic control and potential risk of harm with 4 agents.
Minimize Polypharmacy—To minimize Mrs B’s medication burden, she could stop 
taking pioglitazone because it is associated with weight gain, lower extremity edema, risk of 
heart failure, and osteoporosis in women.
Sitagliptin could also be stopped given its relatively low efficacy and high cost.
Metformin and glipizide could be continued. Routine monitoring of blood glucose is not 
recommended for patients taking oral medications; however, she is at risk of hypoglycemia, 
and intermittent monitoring may be helpful to assess for hypoglycemic events Her glipizide 
dose can be reduced or stopped if there is any hypoglycemia.
Case 3
Mr C is 78 years old and has had type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years. He has nephropathy 
(eGFR ≈ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. He has 
established coronary artery disease and had coronary artery bypass graft 6 years ago. He has 
osteoarthritis and limited mobility. For his diabetes, he takes glimepiride 4 mg twice a day 
and linagliptin 5 mg once daily. His HbA1c value is 8.1%.
Estimate Benefits—The discussion with the patient should focus on trade-offs between 
escalating therapy (eg, with insulin)vs continuing current regimen (with glimepiride and 
linagliptin). Given that his HbA1c value is higher than 8%, intensifying treatment may result 
in modest reductions in cardiovascular events and microvascular events. These benefits are 
likely to emerge after 10 years of treatment.
Estimate Harms—On the other hand, intensifying therapy may require insulin and can be 
associated with a high treatment burden.

 The discussion with the patient should also focus on his risk of hypoglycemia. The patient 
has several risk factors for hypoglycemia, including chronic kidney disease and presence of 
established microvascular complications. He should be aware of hypoglycemia symptoms, 
be able to monitor blood glucose, and be asked to report any symptoms or low blood glucose 
results to the office.
Individualize HbA1c Target—Current HbA1c level is reasonable, pending a discussion 
with the patient regarding preferences for treatment. Rather than initiating insulin and 
increasing his risk of hypoglycemia, it is reasonable to continue current oral medications and 
accept a higher HbA1c target.
Minimize Polypharmacy—Stopping medications is likely to result in an HbA1c increase 
that is well above his glycemic target.
Case 4
Mrs D is a 79-year-old widow, functionally independent, living alone. She has hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, 
and osteoporosis. She has had type 2 diabetes for the past 40 years. She currently takes 
insulin glaring, 42 U at bedtime, and insulin aspart, 5 U with breakfast, 7 U with lunch, and 
9 U with dinner. She takes additional insulin aspart based on a blood glucose scale with each 
meal. She has had symptomatic hypoglycemia over the past week, with blood glucose levels 
down to 50 mg/dL, without a clear pattern. Her blood glucose values range from 51 to 345 
mg/dL, but she does not keep an organized log and admits that she some times for gets to 
take her insulin. Her HbA1c level is 7.8%.
Estimate Benefits—Mrs D has long-standing diabetes that is unlikely to be safely 
managed without the use of insulin. However, benefits of intensive glycemic control in her 
case are unclear and unlikely to be realized during her lifetime.
Estimate Harms—Harms of insulin therapy include severe hypoglycemia, especially 
among older patients with complex health problems like Mrs D. Complex insulin regimen 
also increases treatment burden. Treatment errors are frequent and her cognitive status needs 
to be assessed to determine her capacity for self-management.
Individualize HbA1c Target—Type 2 diabetes control may be too tight, and her insulin 
regimen overly complex, given the harms and burdens of treatment. Focus should shift to 
prevention of symptomatic hyperglycemia and keeping her HbA1c values in the 8% range 
may be reasonable, while avoiding hypoglycemia.
Minimize Polypharmacy—Her insulin regimen needs to be simplified to reduce the risk 
for errors. A first step may be to reduce her glargine dose and prescribe a fixed dose of 
aspart with each meal. Depending on her schedule of meals, premixed insulin injections 
twice daily may be another option.

 Conclusions
Although there are major gaps in the evidence base on how best to care for older adults with 
diabetes, 4 evidence-informed steps can help clinicians and patients make individualized 
treatment decisions. Patient-centered decisions start with a strong partnership between the 
clinician and the patient. The first and second steps include assessments of potential benefits 
and harms of intensive glycemic control. Estimation of life expectancy can be useful to 
determine whether long-term benefits of intensive glycemic control are possible. The need 
for insulin (or other type of therapy), duration of diabetes, and cognitive impairment can be 
used to determine the likelihood of harms associated with treatment. In the third step, patient 
preferences should play a major role in determining the appropriate glycemic target. Fourth, 
polypharmacy should be minimized. If a glycemic target cannot be easily achieved, the most 
appropriate course may be to modify the glycemic target rather than intensify treatment.

Special Considerations in the Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitusin Older 
Adults
Clinical Features
Most often asymptomatic and diagnosed based on routine laboratory evaluation
Classic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia) may be absent
May present with dehydration, confusion, incontinence, and diabetes complications, such 
as neuropathy or nephropathy
Diagnosis
Standard diagnostic criteria apply (fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 2-hour plasma 
glucose ≥200 mg/dL during an OGTT, HbA1c≥ 6.5%, or random blood glucose ≥200 
mg/dL in the presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemiaa)13
More likely to have abnormal 2-hour plasma glucose during an OGTT
Cautions
The HbA1c level may not accurately reflect hyperglycemia in conditions common among 
older adults, including anemia, recent blood transfusions, treatment with erythropoietin, 
or chronic kidney disease14
Abbreviations: HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test.
SI conversion: To convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555; HbA1c in 
percentage to mmol/mol, subtract 2.152 and then multiply by 10.93.
a In the absence of hyperglycemic symptoms, these criteria must be repeated and 
confirmed

unable to treat themselves
VADT: Medical intervention to avert a life-threatening event or hospitalization
Cochrane: Hypoglycemia requiring assistance

Patient preference
for decreased intensity
of treatment
Elicit and explore the rationale behind patient
preferences
    Less frequent monitoring
of blood glucose
Decrease or stop insulin
    High cost of medications
Stop newer, high-cost agents
Limited capacity
Support patient to enhance capacity or choose
to accept some hyperglycemia
    Cognitive impairment
Explore whether caregivers can administer
diabetes medications
Decreasing or stopping medications may be best
approach if caregivers cannot help
