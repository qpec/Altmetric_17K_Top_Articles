Abstract
Background—Video games are one of the favourite leisure activities of children; the influence 
on child health is usually perceived to be negative. The present study assessed the association 
between the amount of time spent playing video games and children mental health as well as 
cognitive and social skills.
Methods—Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Europe project conducted 
in six European Union countries (youth ages 6–11, n = 3195). Child mental health was assessed by 
parents and teachers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and by children themselves 
with the Dominic Interactive. Child video game usage was reported by the parents. Teachers 
evaluated academic functioning. Multivariable logistic regressions were used.
Results—20 % of the children played video games more than 5 h per week. Factors associated 
with time spent playing video games included being a boy, being older, and belonging to a

 medium size family. Having a less educated, single, inactive, or psychologically distressed mother 
decreased time spent playing video games. Children living in Western European countries were 
significantly less likely to have high video game usage (9.66 vs 20.49 %) though this was not 
homogenous. Once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mothers age, marital 
status, education, employment status, psychological distress, and region, high usage was 
associated with 1.75 times the odds of high intellectual functioning (95 % CI 1.31–2.33), and 1.88 
times the odds of high overall school competence (95 % CI 1.44–2.47). Once controlled for high 
usage predictors, there were no significant associations with any child self-reported or mother- or 
teacher-reported mental health problems. High usage was associated with decreases in peer 
relationship problems [OR 0.41 (0.2–0.86) and in prosocial deficits (0.23 (0.07, 0.81)].
Conclusions—Playing video games may have positive effects on young children. Understanding 
the mechanisms through which video game use may stimulate children should be further 
investigated.

Background
According to the APA Council on Communications and Media Executive Committee, 
“Children and teenagers spend more time engaged in various media than they do in any 
other activity except for sleeping”. This assessment was based on a 2010 Kaiser Family 
Foundation survey of more than 2000 youths 8–18 years old which revealed that children 
and teenagers in the US spend an average of 7 h per day with a variety of media. The survey 
further indicated that 70 % of American teenagers have a TV in their bedroom, and half have 
a video game console. The Council recommended limiting media time to 2 h per day for 
children and suggested that pediatrician or family practitioners inquire about media exposure 
during visits to educate parents on recommended guidelines and on health risks associated 
with exaggerated exposure.
In the European Union (EU), video games are very popular across age groups and socio-
economic categories. An EU council resolution is in place to rate video games and provide 
warning labels regarding violence or adult content, allowing parents to decide which games 
are appropriate for their child. This resolution has since been extended to 20 Member States. 
However, this rating system is not in place in four Member States including Cyprus, 
Luxembourg, Romania and Slovenia. Furthermore, 15 EU States have legislation concerning 
the sale of video games with adult content to minors in stores, although the scope of this 
legislation varies greatly between Member States. For instance, Germany, Ireland, Italy and 
the UK have banned certain violent video games, while other countries have not. Despite 
these efforts to control access to violent or inappropriate games in the EU, no 
recommendations have been issued towards physicians to provide guidelines on how media 
exposure should be addressed with the parents during routine health examinations.
The effect of video games on child mental health has been researched relatively thoroughly 
over the past few decades with regard to the time spent playing video games, and the effects

 of sometimes violent, ultra-realistic video games. High media usage (including TV, videos, 
computer/internet use and more specifically video games) has been linked to an increased 
risk of suicidality and depression in adolescents [1, 2] and in adults [3] in the US and in 
Norway. However, this elevated risk was not replicated in other countries. A large Canadian 
study showed non-significant or even inverse associations between video game use and 
depression or binge drinking, while it was significantly associated with increased risk of 
obesity [4]. Violent video games were also reported to desensitize children towards violence 
and to decrease morality and empathy [5]. Finally, other studies reported addictive behavior 
associated with video games comparable to substance dependence [6, 7] along with its 
negative consequences.
A 1997 meta-analysis [8] indicated that video games might not lead to aggressive behavior, 
and suggested that playing video games may even help children to express their aggression, 
suggesting that they could even be used for health education. However, data from this meta 
analysis were limited to adolescents and young adults, yet children as young as 8 or younger 
have access to those games and have not been thoroughly studied and more recent data has 
shown that the influence of media such as video games and TV on children is not uniformly 
negative [9-12]. This is an important gap in the literature given that patterns of media use 
may be established during this developmental window, and it is also a critical window for 
the onset of childhood mental health problems.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first ever to utilize survey data on more than 3000 
European schoolchildren aged 6–11, across six countries representing very diverse cultural 
contexts to investigate the association between video game use and mental health. The 
objectives are (1) to determine the amount of time spent on video games by primary school 
children in diverse European countries, and to examine the determinants of video game use; 
(2) to determine whether high video game use is associated with decrease academic 
performance; and (3) to investigate whether high video game use is associated with mental 
health problems.
Methods
The School Children Mental Health Europe (SCHME) study is a cross-sectional survey of 
European schoolchildren aged 6–11 conducted in 2010. The present study included data 
collected in Germany, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Details 
on country-specific sampling are provided elsewhere [13]. Briefly, approximately 45–50 
schools were approached per country (a greater number of schools were approached in 
Germany and The Netherlands), with varying participation rates from 6.5 % in The 
Netherlands and 95.6 % in Romania. Schools were selected randomly though they were not 
selected to be representative of the country. Classes were then randomly selected within each 
participating school. Approximately 48 children were then randomly selected in each school. 
One exception is in The Netherlands, where a smaller number of schools participated and 
complete classes were included. Parents received a letter describing the study and a consent 
form to be returned to the school. Children were included if they were present on the day of 
the assessment, unless their parent actively refused. Among participating schools, between 
50.5 % (Turkey) and 90.5 % (The Netherlands) of eligible children participated in the study,

 and between 45.5 % (The Netherlands) and 90.9 % (Lithuania) of the child informants 
(parents and teachers) participated. The total sample size was 4911 for teacher-reported 
outcomes and 5115 for mother-reported outcomes. Among those with both informants, we 
restricted the dataset to include only mother respondents 4079 (81.61 % of sample) to 
maintain comparability since proportion of fathers largely varies across countries and gender 
differences influence most of the mental heath evaluations and we excluded few kids aged 5 
or 12/13 to concentrate on the 6–11 range. Respondents for whom data on video games were 
not available (n = 884, 21.67 %) were excluded. The final sample included in the present 
study is 3195.
Measures
In each country, data were collected from the child, the teacher and the mother. The mothers 
completed self-reports documenting socio-demographic variables such as household 
composition (including age, gender and parental status for each member), parental education 
(highest level completed), marital status, occupational level (professionally active vs 
inactive), as well as the MH5 a subscale of the SF361 [14] assessing psychological distress. 
In The Netherlands the same questions were completed electronically using a secured 
website, though paper questionnaires were made available upon request.
Video game use—Parents were asked how long their child spends playing video games 
on average during the week. We used tertiles of reported time spent for analyses based on 
distributions in the data and preliminary analyses. Low video game use was defined as 0–60 
min per week; moderate use was defined as 61–300 min, and high use was >300 min.
Mother-reported and teacher-reported mental health status—Child 
psychopathology was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
[15, 16]. The SDQ has been validated in a number of languages and has been used 
extensively in Europe [17-20]. The parent and teacher versions of the SDQ include a brief 
questionnaire divided into five subscales for which the author provided cuts points in order 
to define normal, doubtful and probable cases of emotional problems, hyperactivity and 
inattention, conduct problems, peer relationship difficulties, and pro-social behaviors. A 
total difficulties score was computed, excluding pro-social behaviors and peer relationship 
difficulties with cut points for parent and teacher evaluations. In addition, parents and 
teachers were asked to rate the level of impairment caused by the child’s mental health 
issues. These responses were scored as recommended [15]. The present study also considers 
probable cases combining parents and teachers answers plus impairment [21] for three 
diagnoses as for a pooled “any diagnosis” Subjects were then excluded if they did not 
include a mother and teacher response. Of the 4342 subjects with a maternal response, 4079 
also had a full teacher report.
Child-self-reported mental health status—Self-reported mental health was evaluated 
using a computerized cartoon-like assessment tool known as the “Dominic Interactive”. The 
Dominic Interactive (DI) was designed for young children (6 years old and older), and 
consists of 91 cartoons depicting a child named Dominic/Dominique experiencing a feeling, 
a thought or an action. A voice-over asks the child if she or he acts, feels or thinks similarly.

 Children completed the DI individually on a computer station at school under the 
supervision of a research assistant. A series of yes/no questions provides greater scope for 
self-expression [22, 23]. The DI has been validated in several studies and has been found to 
be more reliable than structured interviews in the assessment of mental health in young 
children. A recent study established the construct validity of the DI among the seven 
participating countries [24].
Data on suicidal thoughts were directly drawn from two of the 91 cartoons [25] included in 
the DI: “Do you often think about death or about killing yourself” and “Do you often think 
about death or dying?”.
Academic performance—Academic performance was evaluated by teachers who 
answered questions regarding the child’s school performance and learning behavior 
observed in the classroom. It was formulated as “compared to the other children in the class, 
how does he or she fare in the following areas: school performance, reading, mathematics, 
spelling and intellectual functioning?” to be classified into five levels from [5] marked 
difficulties to [1] very good. An additional question evaluated the child motivation to 
succeed at school.
Ethics statement—A personal letter allowing for a written refusal informed parents. 
Surveys were completed in anonymity and no names were available on the questionnaires 
sent to the research team.
Each country received the support of their government, and minister of education and 
obtained the support of relevant ethical committees. In Bulgaria: The Deputy Minister of 
Education, Youth and Science of the Republic of Bulgaria; in Germany approval was 
obtained through landers: (a) Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Mecklenburg-
Vorpommern (b) State school authority, Luneburg (c) Ministry of Education and Culture of 
Schleswig–Holstein country; in Lithuania: the Ministry of Education and Science of the 
Republic of Lithuania; in The Netherlands: the Commission of Faculty Ethical Behavior 
Research (ECG); in Romania the Bucharest School Inspectorate General Municipal, and in 
Turkey: the Istanbul-directorate of National Education.
In addition, ethical committees were given their approval in each of the countries except 
Germany where the school authorization clearly mentioned in its text the ethical conditions 
for the authorization and Turkey where such committee does not exist but a parental signed 
consent form was mandatory.
No child was obliged to participate; any refusal to participate will have stopped his or her 
participation.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS V9.3. Multivariable logistic regressions were 
performed to assess the association between mental health outcomes and video game use 
adjusting for the child’s sex and age, the number of children in household, region (Eastern 
vs Western Europe), mother’s age, socio-economic status, marital status, mother’s

 psychological distress. Statistical significance was evaluated using 0.05-level. Odds ratios 
are shown with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval. Data were weighted to correct 
for size of schools and probability of child selection.
Results
Sample characteristics
A table available online presents the demographic characteristics of the final sample. There 
were significant differences with regard to age with a higher mean age in Eastern Europe 
(8.72 years). Differences were also observed regarding gender and number of children in the 
family with Eastern Europe having a higher percentage of families with four or more 
children. In addition, the Western European sample had a significantly lower percentage of 
mothers living apart from the father when compared to Eastern Europe. Mothers in the 
sample were also significantly more educated in Western Europe as well as significantly 
older with an average age of 40.52 years.
Video game use
Overall, 20 % of the children were in the high usage group defined as spending more than 5 
h a week playing video games, 39 % spent less than 1 h a week using video games and 40 % 
between 1 and 5 h a week. Among the high usage category, very few children played more 
than 20 h (0.69 %), 4.32 % played 10–20 h, 6.89 % 7–10 h, and 8.11 % between 5 and 7 h. 
The remaining, 59.47 % played more than 7 h and 20 % more than 10 h.
Table 1 shows that most demographic characteristics were associated with video-game 
usage. Factors associated with increased usage included being a boy, being older, belonging 
to a medium size family. Conversely, a less educated, single, inactive, or psychologically 
distressed mother decreases the probability of high usage. Children living in Western 
European countries were significantly less likely to be high users as compared to their 
Eastern European peers (9.66 vs 20.49 %),though this pattern was not homogenous.
Video game usage, academic performance and motivation to succeed
High usage was associated with good intellectual functioning and academic achievement 
(Table 2). The positive associations included competence in reading (p = 0.05), mathematics 
(p = 0.0031), and spelling (p = 0.002). Motivation to succeed at school did not vary as a 
function of usage (data not shown).
Once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mother’s age, marital status, 
education, employment status, psychological distress, and European Region (West/East), 
high usage was associated with increased odds of elevated intellectual functioning (aOR 
1.58 (1.22, 2.05) [0.001]), and high overall competence (aOR 1.67 (1.31, 2.12) [<0.001]) 
(Table 2), moderate usage as well but to a lesser extend.
Video games and child mental health
Table 3 shows that in univariate analyses, playing video games was associated with a lower 
prevalence of self-reported internalizing disorders and fewer reports of thoughts of death.

 However, once adjusted for child age and gender, number of children, mother’s age, marital 
status, education, employment status, psychological distress, and European Region (West/
East), these differences were no longer significant.
There were no significant associations with any SDQ dimension: emotional, ADHD, 
conduct, peer relationship, total difficulties as reported separately by the mother or the 
teacher (tables on request).
Children whose mother and teacher both reported as having problems with peer relationships 
or with an elevated total difficulties score were less likely to be in the high usage group 
(Table 4). Once adjusted for child age and sex, number of children, mother’s age, marital 
status, education, employment status, psychological distress and regions, the association 
between combined mother and teacher evaluations of peer relationship problems and odds of 
high video game usage remained (aOR 0.41, 95 % CI 0.2–0.86) as well as the one with total 
difficulties (aOR 0.41, 95 % CI 0.2–0.86). Prosocial deficits were also milder among those 
with moderate video game usage (OR 0.23, 95 % CI 0.07–0.81).
Discussion
In a sample of over 3000 young children across six European countries, high video game 
usage (playing video games more than 5 h per week) was significantly associated with 
higher intellectual functioning, increased academic achievement, a lower prevalence of peer 
relationship problems and a lower prevalence of mental health difficulties. High video game 
usage was not associated with an increase of conduct disorder or any externalizing disorder 
nor was it associated with suicidal thoughts or thoughts of death. Controlling for 
demographic and other risk factors explained part of the association between video game use 
and protective associations in mental health and cognitive function, nevertheless all these 
relations particularly cognitive functioning persisted despite control.
These findings are in line with several studies. Dorman [8] reviewed several studies 
conducted on children which reported that video gaming seemed to increase prosocial skills. 
For example, in a free play setting, young children (ages 4–6) displayed an increase in 
violent behavior as well as in prosocial behaviors after playing violent games. A Japanese 
study of kindergarten children found that those who played video games had more friends 
and were more willing to talk to others [26].
More recently, a literature review [27] described the “social benefits of gaming”. The 
authors concluded that playing video games is today, even more so than in the past two 
decades, a highly social activity for most children as the vast majority of children play their 
video games with a friend. Some games explicitly reward effective cooperation, supporting 
and helping behavior [28]. In addition, playing prosocial video games increased prosocial 
behaviors: children who frequently played prosocial video games were more inclined to 
engage in helpful behavior later in the year [29]. Children who engaged in social interactions 
while playing video games were also more likely to take an interest in civic engagement 
once adults. Violent and nonviolent games appear to be equally predictive of such 
involvement. The same review [27] reported cognitive benefits of video games as children

 developed problem-solving skills and enhanced creativity. In addition, children seemed to 
develop beliefs about their intelligence and abilities that affected their level of achievement, 
which extended beyond their performance on video games and applied to school activities. 
An important future direction of this work is to determine whether there are differential 
associations between video game playing and childhood health outcomes depending on the 
content of the game; for example, whether violent content specifically vs more complex 
cognitive problems solving tasks differently predict health outcomes.
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, due to the 
cross-sectional nature of the SCMHE study, we cannot establish temporality between video 
game usage and mental health outcomes. Second, video game usage was reported by the 
mother, which may have led to an overestimation or underestimation of the time spent 
playing video games. We did not assess children’s own perception of their time spent. While 
this information would be useful as corroborative evidence, children may not be accurate 
reporters of time spent playing, compared with parents who most likely manage children’s 
schedules. Third, mental health symptoms were assessed via self report of the mother, 
teacher, and children themselves, but not by trained clinicians. While clinician assessments 
would be informative, assessments by multiple reporters increase the reliability and validity 
of the information we obtain in the present study. Finally, the overall participation rate is a 
concern as only 21.67 % of eligible families did not respond to the video game question. 
Missing data are mainly due to data collected in Turkey, where only 55.67 % responded to 
video game-related questions, whereas in the remaining countries the response rate was 
between 70 and 80 %. That being said, the analyses controlled for the main socio-
demographics variables, which differentiated respondents from non-respondents, correcting 
much of the potential bias.
Conclusion
The results of the present study suggest that video game use is not associated with an 
increased risk of mental health problems. On the contrary, the data presented here suggest 
that video games are a protective factor, especially regarding peer relationship problems for 
the children who are the most involved in video games. Finally, video games seem to be 
linked to better intellectual functioning and academic achievement.
According to our data, video gaming is entirely beneficial for cognitive functioning as well 
as for some aspects of mental health. However, the cross-sectional nature of the survey 
precludes us from drawing conclusions on the long-term effects of high video game usage. 
Longitudinal studies are needed to monitor mental health, cognitive and social functioning 
through adolescence and into early adulthood to ensure that the positive effects observed in 
children are maintained later in life.
