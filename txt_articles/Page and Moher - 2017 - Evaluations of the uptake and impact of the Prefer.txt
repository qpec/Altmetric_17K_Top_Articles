Evaluations of the uptake and impact of
the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) Statement and extensions: a
scoping review
Matthew J. Page1* and David Moher2,3
Abstract
Background: The PRISMA Statement is a reporting guideline designed to improve transparency of systematic reviews
(SRs) and meta-analyses. Seven extensions to the PRISMA Statement have been published to address the reporting of
different types or aspects of SRs, and another eight are in development. We performed a scoping review to map the
research that has been conducted to evaluate the uptake and impact of the PRISMA Statement and extensions. We
also synthesised studies evaluating how well SRs published after the PRISMA Statement was disseminated adhere to its
recommendations.
Methods: We searched for meta-research studies indexed in MEDLINE® from inception to 31 July 2017, which investigated
some component of the PRISMA Statement or extensions (e.g. SR adherence to PRISMA, journal endorsement of PRISMA).
One author screened all records and classified the types of evidence available in the studies. We pooled data on SR
adherence to individual PRISMA items across all SRs in the included studies and across SRs published after 2009 (the
year PRISMA was disseminated).
Results: We included 100 meta-research studies. The most common type of evidence available was data on SR adherence
to the PRISMA Statement, which has been evaluated in 57 studies that have assessed 6487 SRs. The pooled results of these
studies suggest that reporting of many items in the PRISMA Statement is suboptimal, even in the 2382 SRs published after
2009 (where nine items were adhered to by fewer than 67% of SRs). Few meta-research studies have evaluated the
adherence of SRs to the PRISMA extensions or strategies to increase adherence to the PRISMA Statement and
extensions.
Conclusions: Many studies have evaluated how well SRs adhere to the PRISMA Statement, and the pooled result of
these suggest that reporting of many items is suboptimal. An update of the PRISMA Statement, along with a toolkit of
strategies to help journals endorse and implement the updated guideline, may improve the transparency of SRs.

 Background
Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses are an es-
sential
resource
for
healthcare
decision-makers
[1].
When conducted well, SRs can provide credible and
timely data on a range of enquiries, such as which treat-
ments are effective, ineffective or harmful; which tests
accurately diagnose a condition and which exposures are
associated with health outcomes. However, the value of
SRs depends on how well authors have reported what
they did, and what they found. If such information is ab-
sent or ambiguous, readers cannot judge whether the re-
sults of the SR are robust to the methods used, cannot
attempt to reproduce the findings and cannot interpret
the findings accurately. This can contribute to the failure
to implement the findings of SRs into clinical practice
[2]. Therefore, transparent reporting of SRs should be
considered critically important by authors of SRs [3, 4].
The transparency of SRs and meta-analyses of health re-
search has been called into question on many occasions
[5]. The first formal appraisal of SRs with a focus on medi-
cine was performed by Cynthia Mulrow, who identified
several poor reporting practices in a sample of 50 medical
review articles published between June 1985 and June
1986 [6]. For example, clearly specified methods of identi-
fying, selecting and appraising studies were available in
one article only. Transparency was only slightly better in
reviews published in 1996, with less than 25% of articles
describing how evidence was identified, evaluated or syn-
thesised [7]. In the last decade, transparency of SRs has
certainly improved, yet a high amount of suboptimal
reporting persists [8].
Improvements in the transparency of SRs in recent
years may be attributed to the dissemination of reporting
guidelines. Reporting guidelines provide evidence-based
recommendations for authors on how to report their
research methods and findings clearly [9]. In 1999, an
international group of 30 epidemiologists, clinicians, stat-
isticians, editors and researchers developed a reporting
guideline for meta-analyses of randomised trials—the
QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses)
Statement [10]. In 2005, a meeting was convened to up-
date QUOROM to address several conceptual and prac-
tical advances in the methodology of SRs and to help
overcome several shortcomings identified in an audit of
SRs [3]. The guideline was renamed the PRISMA (Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses) Statement, and published in 2009 [11]. It was
accompanied by an explanation and elaboration docu-
ment, which provided detailed guidance for each of the 27
included items, and examples of exemplar reporting [12].
According to citation data in Scopus®, the PRISMA State-
ment has had a very high uptake from the biomedical re-
search community (Fig. 1). The checklist paper [11, 13–19]
has been cited 19,402 times as of 31 July 2017, and the ac-
companying explanation and elaboration document [12,
20–23] received 5483 citations by this date. However, not
all published SRs cite the guideline; for example, in a ran-
dom sample of 119 non-Cochrane SRs of therapeutic inter-
ventions indexed in MEDLINE® in February 2014, 42 (35%)
mentioned the use of the PRISMA Statement [8].
Since its publication, seven extensions to the PRISMA
Statement have been developed to facilitate reporting of
different types or aspects of SRs (Table 1). These include
the PRISMA-Equity extension [24–26], PRISMA for Ab-
stracts of SRs [27], PRISMA extension for reporting SRs
incorporating network meta-analysis [28], PRISMA for

 SRs and meta-analyses of individual participant data
[29], PRISMA for SR protocols [30, 31], PRISMA harms
checklist [32] and PRISMA extension for SRs of com-
plex interventions [33, 34]. Citation counts for the
PRISMA extensions are much lower than those of the
PRISMA Statement, but they have not had the same
amount of time to accrue citations (Fig. 2). Also, one
should not expect the extensions to receive as many ci-
tations, as they are more restricted in scope, meaning
that fewer SRs to which the extensions are applicable are
published each year. The most cited extension is the
checklist paper for PRISMA-P (for SR protocols) [30],
which has received 683 citations since its publication in
January 2015.
There are also eight PRISMA extensions that are in
development (Table 2). These include extensions for SRs
of newborn and child health research and for protocols
of such SRs, for SRs of diagnostic test accuracy studies,

methods, for SRs of traditional Chinese medicine inter-
ventions and for SRs of in vivo animal studies.
It is important to evaluate whether the PRISMA State-
ment and extensions have achieved what they are de-
signed to do—improve the transparency of SRs. We are
aware of two previous SRs that have investigated the ad-
herence of SRs to the PRISMA Statement (i.e. the extent
to which SRs comply with each item in the statement)
[35, 36]. Another SR has examined whether transparency
is better in SRs published in journals that endorse the
PRISMA Statement (e.g. suggest its use in the journal
instructions to authors or require that authors submit a
PRISMA checklist accompanying their SR) [37]. How-
ever, to our knowledge, there has been no attempt to
map what other research on the uptake, and impact of
the PRISMA Statement and extensions has been done.
Also, there has been no attempt to synthesise studies
evaluating adherence of SRs published after the PRISMA
Statement was disseminated. Therefore, we aimed to ad-
dress these gaps by conducting a scoping review of
meta-research studies evaluating the PRISMA Statement
and extensions.
Methods
We did not pre-register the methods of our scoping
review, as we are unaware of any register for meth-
odological research of this nature.
We considered articles to be eligible for inclusion if
they were an empirical study of any design (e.g. rando-
mised trial, cross-sectional analysis, before-after study),
which investigated some component of the PRISMA
Statement or extensions (e.g. how often PRISMA is re-
ferred to in journal instructions to authors) or which
used the PRISMA Statement or one of the extensions
for evaluative purposes (e.g. to assess how often SRs ad-
here to each PRISMA item). We included meta-research
studies regardless of language or year of publication. We
excluded commentaries, editorials or letters to the
editor.
One author (MJP) searched for potentially relevant
studies indexed in MEDLINE® from inception to 31
July 2017 (specifically, Ovid MEDLINE® Epub Ahead
of Print, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations;
Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid MEDLINE and Ver-
sions®). The following search strategy was used to re-
trieve
articles
that
included
the
term

stract of the article:
1. ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analyses’.ti,ab.
2. PRISMA.ti,ab.
3. 1 or 2.
One author (MJP) screened all titles and abstracts, and
any full-text articles retrieved, to determine eligibility.
The same author recorded the types of evidence avail-
able in the included meta-research studies. Types of evi-
dence were classified as:
� data on SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement or
extensions;
� characteristics associated with SR adherence to
PRISMA (e.g. journal endorsement, year of
publication);
� the frequency of journal instructions to authors
referring to the PRISMA Statement or extensions;

 � other (e.g. frequency of SR authors who reported
using the PRISMA Statement to guide their
reporting).
To determine the influence of the PRISMA Statement
on the transparency of SRs, we pooled the findings of
meta-research studies evaluating how often SRs adhere
to the PRISMA Statement. This updates a previous SR
which included adherence studies published up to Oc-
tober 2014 [35]. One author (MJP) collected from each
meta-research study the following data about the SRs
evaluated: focus (e.g. therapeutic, diagnostic), clinical
area, language, years of publication and frequencies of
SRs adhering to each of the 27 PRISMA Statement
items. In some cases, authors of meta-research studies
recorded if a particular PRISMA item was fully re-
ported or partially reported in each of the SRs evalu-
ated. In such cases, we recorded only the number of
SRs that fully reported the PRISMA item. One author
(MJP) contacted study authors to request data on ad-
herence to individual items if these data were not
available in the published article (e.g. when study au-
thors reported only the mean number of items that SRs
adhered to).
We
pooled
data
on
SR
adherence
to
individual
PRISMA items across all SRs in the included studies.
We noted items that fewer than two thirds (67%) of SRs
adhered to and those that are fewer than half of SRs ad-
hered to. We also pooled data on SR adherence to indi-
vidual PRISMA items in a subset of studies that
evaluated SRs published after the PRISMA Statement
was disseminated. For this analysis, we analysed studies
which included only SRs published in 2010 or later or
studies which reported data on a subgroup of SRs pub-
lished in 2010 or later. We did not contact study authors
for this subgroup data. We conducted all analyses in
Microsoft Excel.

 full text of 170 articles. We excluded 70 of these articles,
most of which were editorials or commentaries (reasons
for exclusion are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1).
One hundred meta-research studies met our inclusion
criteria (listed in Additional file 2: Table S2). The studies
were published between 2011 and 2017, and more than
half were published in 2015 or later (n = 59). All of the
studies were observational in design; there were 86
cross-sectional analyses, six uncontrolled before-after
studies, four surveys of authors and four systematic re-
views of meta-research studies.
We recorded 20 different types of evidence available
across the included meta-research studies (Table 3). The
most common type of evidence available was data on SR
adherence to the PRISMA Statement, which was re-
ported in 57/100 (57%) studies. Many of these 57 studies
(n = 37 [65%]) also investigated characteristics associated
with SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement, such as
the type of journal, year of publication and article word
count. The third most common type of evidence avail-
able was data on the frequency of journals referring to
the PRISMA Statement or extensions in the instructions
to authors (n = 18/100 [18%]).
Few studies have evaluated how well SRs adhere to the
PRISMA extensions; adherence to PRISMA for Ab-
stracts and PRISMA for Network Meta-Analyses has
been examined in three studies and one study, respect-
ively (Table 3). Further, few studies have investigated
whether the endorsement of the PRISMA Statement by
journals was associated with adherence to PRISMA (n =
8/100 [8%]). We did not identify any studies that investi-
gated whether journal endorsement of one of the
PRISMA extensions was associated with SR adherence
to the extension.
Evaluations of SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement
Of the 57 studies evaluating SR adherence to the
PRISMA Statement [38–94], most were published be-
tween 2015 and 2017 (33/57 [58%]), focused on SRs of
therapeutic interventions only (45/57 [79%]), evaluated
non-Cochrane SRs only (34/57 [60%]) and evaluated SRs
written in English only (39/57 [68%]) (Table 4). A total

 of 6487 SRs were evaluated across all studies; the me-
dian (interquartile range) number of SRs evaluated per

79, 85]. By pooling the PRISMA adherence data across
SRs in all 57 reports, we identified 11 items that fewer
than 67% of SRs adhered to (Fig. 4; numerical data avail-
able in Additional file 3: Table S3). These include item 2

registration),

(results: risk of bias within studies), item 22 (results: risk
of bias across studies), item 23 (results: additional ana-
lyses) and item 27 (funding). There were six items that
fewer than 50% of SRs adhered to (items 5, 15, 16, 22,
23 and 27).
PRISMA adherence data for SRs published in 2010 or
later (i.e. after the PRISMA Statement was published)
were available in 27 studies [38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 46, 56,
60, 62, 68–79, 81–84, 92, 94], which evaluated 2382 SRs.
The characteristics of these studies (i.e. focus, clinical
area, language of SRs) were similar to those of the total
set of studies. SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement
was higher for nearly all items in this subset of recent
SRs, compared with the adherence data across all SRs
(Fig. 4; numerical data available in Additional file 3:
Table S3). There were 12 items that more than 80% of
SRs adhered to (items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24
and 26). However, lack of transparency remains an issue
for many SRs. There were nine items that fewer than
67% of SRs adhered to (items 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23
and 27), and one item was adhered to by 21% of SRs
only (item 5, on whether a SR protocol or registration
number exists).
Discussion
Our scoping review suggests that the PRISMA State-
ment and extensions have provided fertile ground for
meta-research. Twenty different types of evidence were
available across 100 meta-research studies. The most
common type of evidence was data on SR adherence to
the PRISMA Statement, which has been evaluated in 57
studies. The pooled results of these studies indicate that
reporting of many items of the PRISMA Statement is
suboptimal, even in those SRs published after its dissem-
ination in 2009. Very few meta-research studies have
evaluated SR adherence to the PRISMA extensions, but
this is unsurprising given that most extensions were dis-
seminated in 2015 or later. Few studies have tested strat-
egies to increase adherence to the PRISMA Statement
and extensions.
Strengths and limitations
There are several strengths of our research. To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically map
research conducted on the PRISMA Statement and ex-
tensions. Most of the included studies assessing SR ad-
herence to the PRISMA Statement focused on one
clinical area, so by pooling data across these studies, our
findings are more generalisable. Also, we managed to
obtain unpublished data from ten studies that had not
reported data on adherence to each individual PRISMA
item [39, 42, 43, 45, 66, 67, 69, 77, 79, 85].
A few limitations must be acknowledged. We included
only meta-research articles indexed in one bibliographic
database (MEDLINE®) and written in English. However,

 we do not see any reason why our findings would differ
had other databases and meta-research articles in lan-
guages other than English been consulted. Screening of
records and collection of data from articles were per-
formed by one author only. It is therefore possible that
we may have missed some relevant meta-research stud-
ies or made errors when recording the frequency of SRs
adhering to the PRISMA Statement. We have uploaded
all data collected to the Open Science Framework
(https://osf.io/7x2mp/) so that interested readers can
verify our data and replicate our results. Most of the SRs
evaluated in the 57 studies investigating SR adherence to
the PRISMA Statement were written in English, and it is
possible that non-English language SRs may be less
likely to adhere to PRISMA, if their authors were not
confident in English. Our classification of types of evi-
dence available in meta-research studies reflects what
was reported; we did not contact study authors to en-
quire whether they conducted other analyses yet chose
not to report the findings. We did not record the refer-
ences of SRs evaluated in each study investigating SR
adherence to the PRISMA Statement and so are
unaware if some SRs appeared in more than one of the
included meta-research studies. However, based on the
information regarding the types of SRs (e.g. Cochrane
or non-Cochrane), years of publication of SRs and clin-
ical focus of SRs, we judged the number of overlapping
SRs to be low.
We were unable to compare the reporting of SRs pub-
lished after PRISMA was disseminated in 2009 with that
before 2009 because of how the included meta-research
studies were designed and reported. Most studies (43 of
57) included some SRs published before 2009 and some
published after 2009, but most studies did not report the
number of SRs in each category. There were 14 studies
that included only SRs published after 2009, 13 studies
which provided subgroup data on SRs published after
2009 (but not all of these studies provided correspond-
ing data for SRs published before 2009) and three stud-
ies included only SRs published before 2009. Given the
data on PRISMA adherence in SRs published before
2009 was limited to a small subset of the included stud-
ies, we decided to restrict our analysis of PRISMA ad-
herence to all SRs (regardless of year of publication) and

 SRs published after 2009. A formal before-after compari-
son was therefore not possible.
We focused on the PRISMA Statement and exten-
sions, although we are aware of other reporting guide-
lines
for
SRs.

(MECIR) reporting standards [132, 133], the American
Psychological Association Meta-Analysis Reporting Stan-
dards (MARS) [134], the ENTREQ Statement for syn-
theses of qualitative research [135], the RAMESES
publication standards for realist syntheses [136] and
meta-narrative reviews [137] and reporting guidance for
describing interventions in SRs [138]. More research is
needed to map the research conducted on these report-
ing guidelines.
Comparison with other studies
We are aware of two other syntheses of meta-research
studies that have investigated the adherence of SRs to
the PRISMA Statement [35, 36]. Samaan et al. [36] in-
cluded three studies, and Pussegoda et al. [35] included
13 studies, respectively. Both reached the same conclu-
sion as us, that adherence to the PRISMA Statement is
suboptimal; however, unlike our review, neither analysed
reporting of SRs published after the PRISMA Statement
was published. Another SR by Stevens et al. [37] synthe-
sised the results of three studies exploring whether SR
adherence to the PRISMA Statement is higher in jour-
nals which endorse the reporting guideline. We identi-
fied in our scoping review an additional five studies that
could be added to an update of this review. To our
knowledge, ours is the only review which has mapped
research conducted on the PRISMA extensions.
Implications of the findings
There are several reasons why adherence is better for
some PRISMA items than others. It is possible that the
less complex the item, the easier it is to report it. For ex-
ample, most of the 12 PRISMA items that were adhered
to by more than 80% of SRs published in 2010 or later
are relatively straightforward to report. These items in-
clude identifying the report as a SR or meta-analysis in
the title, providing a rationale and objectives, presenting
study characteristics and reporting conclusions. Several
items in the PRISMA Statement comprise multiple com-
ponents, which some systematic reviewers may fail to
fully address (e.g. item 12 asks authors to ‘describe
methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual
studies (including specification of whether this was done
at the study or outcome level), and how this information
is to be used in any data synthesis’). Also, reporting of
some items may depend on whether the journal facili-
tates reporting of that item (e.g. authors may be unable
to present a full electronic search strategy (item 8) in
journals that do not allow supplementary files). In
addition, some items with low adherence may not be
considered sufficiently important to report by a majority
of systematic reviewers and journal editors. It would be
useful to conduct surveys and interviews with systematic
reviewers to explore the contributions of these potential
barriers and facilitators to complete SR reporting.
To our knowledge, there have been no prospectively
designed, controlled studies evaluating whether
the
PRISMA
Statement
or extensions are having their
intended effect. This is surprising, and a different thresh-
old than that required to introduce a drug into the
marketplace. Instead, only a few cross-sectional or un-
controlled before-after studies have evaluated the impact
of journal endorsement of the PRISMA Statement on
reporting of SRs. Of these eight studies [38, 39, 46, 71,
77, 81, 84, 94], six evaluated whether journals which
‘recommend’ or ‘encourage’ use of the PRISMA State-
ment in the journal instructions to authors publish SRs
that are reported more completely. Two studies investi-
gated whether reporting is clearer in journals that ask
authors to submit a PRISMA checklist when submitting
an SR. Both are rather low-intensity interventions that
may not have the desired effect. For example, a recom-
mendation in the instructions to authors can easily be
missed by authors (some of whom will not even check
the instructions), while a submitted PRISMA checklist
may be ignored by peer reviewers and journal editors
who face competing pressures on their time.
Researchers need to develop more efficient and inten-
sive interventions to implement reporting guidelines
such as the PRISMA Statement and extensions. We be-
lieve technology can play a valuable role in this regard.
For example, StatReviewer software performs an auto-
mated review of the statistical and reporting integrity of
scientific
manuscripts
(http://www.statreviewer.com/).
Manuscripts can currently be checked against the fol-
lowing reporting guidelines: CONSORT 2010 [139],
STROBE [140], STARD [141, 142], ARRIVE [143] and
The Uniform Requirements for Medical Journals (http://
www.icmje.org/recommendations/). StatReviewer is con-
sidering including PRISMA in their suite of reporting
guidelines (D. Moher, personal communication). We also
think rigorous evaluations, in the form of randomised
trials, of StatReviewer are needed. Such evaluations
could build upon the experiences of previous rando-
mised trials evaluating web-based reporting guideline
tools (e.g. WebCONSORT [144], COBWEB [145]).
It is 12 years since the PRISMA group last met, and
the PRISMA Statement has not been updated since its
publication 8 years ago. We believe that an update is ne-
cessary to address the poor adherence to the guideline.
An updating process will provide the opportunity to dis-
cuss how to rearrange the layout and rephrase the
Page and Moher Systematic Reviews  (2017) 6:263 
Page 9 of 14
 checklist items to increase clarity. It will also allow for
potential new items to be considered, based on recent
methodological developments affecting SR conduct and
reporting. These developments include novel guidance
on how to:
� summarise findings when meta-analysis is not
appropriate [146, 147];
� report and synthesise intervention characteristics of
included studies [138, 148];
� use and interpret prediction intervals for random-
effects meta-analyses [149, 150];
� enhance reproducibility of meta-analytic results and
share data collected [151, 152] and
� report the methods and results of updated SRs [153]
and living SRs [154].
In addition, developing a comprehensive research
translation strategy to help journals endorse and imple-
ment the updated guideline may facilitate its use. Journal
editors and researchers should work together to develop
prospective (ideally randomised), controlled studies to
provide robust evidence about the effect of the updated
guideline on the transparency of SRs.
Conclusions
Many studies have evaluated how well SRs adhere to the
PRISMA Statement, and the pooled result of these sug-
gests that reporting of many items is suboptimal. Little
research has been done to design and test strategies to
increase adherence to the PRISMA Statement or exten-
sions. An update of the PRISMA Statement, followed by
a toolkit of strategies to help journals endorse and im-
plement the updated guideline, may improve the trans-
parency of SRs.
