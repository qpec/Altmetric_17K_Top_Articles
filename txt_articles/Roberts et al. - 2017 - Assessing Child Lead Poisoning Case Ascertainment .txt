abstract
OBJECTIVES: To compare prevalence estimates for blood lead level ≥10.0 μg/dL (elevated blood 
lead level [EBLL]) with numbers reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) for children 12 months to 5 years of age from 1999 to 2010 on a state-by-state basis.
METHODS: State-specific prevalence estimates were generated based on the continuous 
NHANES according to newly available statistical protocols. Counts of case reports were 
based on the 39 states (including the District of Columbia) reporting to the CDC Childhood 
Lead Poisoning Prevention Program during the study period. Analyses were conducted 
both including and excluding states and years of nonreporting to the CDC.
RESULTS: Approximately 1.2 million cases of EBLL are believed to have occurred in this 
period, but 607 000 (50%) were reported to the CDC. Including only states and years for 
which reporting was complete, the reporting rate was 64%. Pediatric care providers in 23 
of 39 reporting states identified fewer than half of their children with EBLL. Although the 
greatest numbers of reported cases were from the Northeast and Midwest, the greatest 
numbers based on prevalence estimates occurred in the South. In southern and western 
states engaged in reporting, roughly 3 times as many children with EBLL were missed than 
were diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the best available estimates, undertesting of blood lead levels by 
pediatric care providers appears to be endemic in many states.

WhAT’S KNOWN ON ThIS SUbjECT: There has 
long been concern that lead poisoning among 
many children goes undetected, but only now 
are researchers able to conduct state-by-state 
comparisons.
WhAT ThIS STUDy ADDS: During the study period, 
the greatest numbers of children with blood lead 
levels ≥10.0 μg/dL lived in the South. In 23 of the 39 
states examined, the majority of children with these 
levels went undiagnosed and untreated.

In the United States, practices 
related to screening and testing for 
elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) 
vary widely. American Academy of 
Pediatrics guidelines1 
– 
3 encourage 
reliance on screening procedures 
formulated at the state and local 
levels to determine who should be 
tested, but these recommendations 
are often difficult for clinicians 
to access and commonly defer to 
practitioners’ individual evaluations 
of EBLL risk in the communities 
they serve, a task for which few 
are equipped.4 Laws requiring 
beneficiaries of Medicaid and the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children to receive testing are often 
unenforced, 
5 and only 4 states 
recommend that schools require 
proof of testing for kindergarten or 
prekindergarten attendance.4 For 
most children, therefore, clinician 
discretion is the sole determinant of 
how many and which children are 
tested for EBLL.
Over the past 2 decades, many states 
have reported counts of children 
with EBLL to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) 
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention 
Program (CLPPP), but because 
of this variability in screening 
practices, how these counts relate 
to EBLL prevalence is impossible to 
know. Ideally, these counts could be 
compared with estimated numbers 
of children believed to have EBLL in 
each state, revealing whether efforts 
at case ascertainment by clinicians 
are indeed adequate. Because 
independent state-level estimates of 
EBLL prevalence have not existed, 
however, this fundamental question 
could not be addressed.
However, new advances in 
epidemiology and statistics6 have 
made estimates of EBLL prevalence 
available for each of the 50 states 
and the District of Columbia for the 
period 1999 to 2010. For first time, 
we can compare the numbers of 
reported cases with those expected 
on a state-by-state basis, enabling 
us to quantify the adequacy of state 
efforts with implications for pediatric 
practice.
METhODS
Importance of EbLL Detection
Lead is a known neurotoxicant for 
which no safe level of exposure has 
been identified.7 Children aged 1 
to 5 years are considered to be at 
highest risk for exposure (because of 
their characteristic hand-to-mouth 
activity) and its ill effects (because 
of their complex and rapid 
neurodevelopment).8 Interventions 
prompted by the finding of 
EBLL among patients, including 
housing and other environmental 
remediation, have proven efficacy 
for mitigating lead’s toxic effects.9 
Absent testing, however, patients 
are left to experience the sequelae 
of continued exposure in their home 
environments, most notably cognitive 
and attention deficits and increased 
impulsivity10, 
11 but potentially 
including insults to the autonomic, 
12 
renal, 
13 and endocrine14, 
 
15 systems.
how EbLL Surveillance Works in the 
United States
Most states require that blood 
lead level (BLL) testing results 
be reported to their public health 
agencies, although many only require 
reporting for results over a certain 
threshold (ranging from 5 to 25 μg/dL).4 
 
During the period 1999 to 2010, 
39 states (including the District of 
Columbia) participated in the CDC 
CLPPP reporting program, although 
participation was intermittent for 
18 of these states. In participating, 
states standardized their definitions 
of EBLL (eg, a fingerstick sample 
subsequently verified by a venous 
sample if over a certain threshold) 
and submitted numbers of children 
tested and numbers with results 
exceeding specific thresholds 
to the CDC. For this period, the 
reporting threshold was 10 μg/dL, 
and subsequently it was lowered 
to 5 μg/dL. Although not all states 
have participated in reporting at 
any given time, these data are the 
sole source of standardized EBLL 
case ascertainment numbers for the 
United States. They demonstrate that 
the greatest numbers of children 
for whom EBLL is detected reside in 
northeastern and midwestern states, 
with far fewer cases ascertained in 
the South and West (Fig 1, blue bars).

Comparisons of Case Counts and 
Prevalence Estimates
We seek to quantify the adequacy of 
case ascertainment of EBLL among 
children 12 months to 5 years of age 
by comparing reported counts with 
those predicted based on prevalence 
estimates generated through 
the application of new statistical 
methods to the NHANES. Although 
such a comparison is intuitively valid, 
there are reasons why these numbers 
might not agree even if a state had 
100% case ascertainment; we posit 
that these reasons are important 
enough for the interpretation of the 
findings below to warrant discussion 
up front.
The first reason is that, to the 
extent that NHANES and putatively 
complete case counts can both be 
considered sources of epidemiologic 
data, they represent 2 different 
study designs. The former is a cross-
sectional study of a representative 
population, the gold standard 
for determining prevalence and 
covariates for any disease. In 
contrast, the latter can be thought 
of as a rolling enrollment study in 
which children are permitted to be 
tested more or less than once per 
year. Whereas NHANES participants 
undergo a single venipuncture, clinic 
patients often undergo fingerstick 
sampling followed by confirmation 
with a venous sample after a variable 
period of time. Therefore, results 
based on the latter efforts are subject 
to regression toward the mean 
and seasonal fluctuations in EBLL 
prevalence.16, 
 
17
The second reason is that our 
prevalence estimates (and therefore 
the projected counts derived from 
them) are based on a statistical 
model. Therefore, given the mix 
of demographic and housing 
characteristics in any particular state, 
we are calculating expected numbers 
of EBLL cases; the observed number 
in any given state is understood to be 
log-normally distributed above and 
below its expected number. Although 
nationwide over the entire study 
period these observed and expected 
numbers should be very similar, any 
given state may have case counts 
higher or lower than projected even 
under the assumption of perfect case 
ascertainment. Because we expect 
extra-Poisson variation among states, 
standard confidence intervals do not 
reflect the degree of disagreement 
that might be expected from random 
chance.
However, comparison of case counts 
with prevalence estimates can 
reveal portions of the United States 
for which EBLL ascertainment is 
dramatically lower than expected 
based on the best available 
epidemiologic tools. In light of the 
serious consequences of untreated 
EBLL for the entire life course, these 
discrepancies indicate a need for 
more aggressive testing until state-
specific, population-based studies 
can be conducted that prove previous 
case ascertainment efforts to be 
adequate.
CDC Reporting Data
Tallies for state reports of EBLL for 
each year were obtained directly 
from the CDC Childhood Lead 
Poisoning Prevention and Healthy 
Housing program in June 2016. Some 
states submitted data for years that 
were known to be incomplete, either 
because they were labeled as such by 
CDC CLPPP or because totals were 
orders of magnitude smaller than 
those for other years. For clarity, the 
present analysis classifies such states 
as nonreporting during those years.
Model for Prediction of EbLL 
Prevalence
NHANES has been conducted on a 
continuous basis since 1999, with 
data releases occurring at 2-year 
intervals.18 Because NHANES is 
designed to be representative of 
the entire noninstitutionalized US 
population, direct subsetting of 
these data cannot be undertaken 
to produce state-level prevalence 
estimates. Instead, researchers may 
fit multivariate models predicting 
disease rates based on each state’s 
demographic data; use of these 
data as model inputs then yields 
prevalence estimates specific to each 
state.
To be valid, any such model must 
include covariates known to be 
predictive of the disease in question; 
for EBLL, these include region of the 
country, race or ethnicity, poverty 
status, and residence in housing built 
before the 1978 ban on lead-based 
paint in the United States. More than 
a third of NHANES records describing 
children aged 1 to 5 years are missing 
this last variable, however, which has 
precluded the generation of models 
predicting EBLL prevalence until 
recently.
To summarize briefly, Roberts and 
English6 formulated a t-distributed 
Heckman selection model19, 
 
20 
applicable to the case of multiple 
missing-not-at-random variables 
in the context of the complex 
survey design of NHANES, thereby 
accounting for potential bias in the 
missing data and enabling the valid 
estimation of a model predicting 
EBLL. National-level predictions from 
the model match well with those 
arrived at through conventional 
analyses of NHANES, although the 
former tend to be slightly lower than 
the latter. The authors therefore 
encourage researchers to consider 
estimates based on their model as 
conservative, potentially leading 
to slight underestimations of EBLL 
prevalence.
Model Inputs
The Roberts and English model is 
based on NHANES participants aged 
12 months through 5 years. Model 
inputs must therefore be specific to 
this age stratum, which precludes 
the use of pretabulated census data 
for this purpose. Following those 
researchers, we use microdata from 
the American Community Survey21 
to generate the inputs described 
3

 ROBERTS et al
above for each state and the District 
of Columbia during the study period. 
For completeness, we reproduce the 
coefficients to which these inputs are 
applied in Table 1. Because NHANES 
is released at 2-year intervals, 
prevalence estimates for off-years are 
calculated via linear interpolation.
Analysis
Because 10 μg/dL was considered 
the level of concern during the study 
period, we define EBLL cases as 
children with BLL greater than or 
equal to this number.
To depict case ascertainment at 
the regional level, we begin by 
calculating the total numbers of 
children with EBLL we believe to 
have occurred during 1999 to 2010 
based on the projected prevalence for 
each state. For each year  
y 
in state  
s 
, 
we let  
 
 
^ 
P 
 
y, 
s 
be the projected prevalence 
and  
N 
 
y, 
s 
 
be the population of children 
aged 12 months through 5 years. 
The expected number of cases is 
simply  
Ex 
p 
 
y, 
s 
 =  
 
 
^ 
P 
 
 
y, 
s 
  
N 
 
y,

. Each  
Ex  
p 
 
y, 
s 
is 
apportioned by whether  
y 
was a year 
that state  
s 
participated in reporting, 
and (if so) the fraction of the region’s 
sum of all expected cases accounted 
for in the totals reported to the CDC 
CLPPP.
For state-level analysis, we 
formulate an outcome variable  
 
θ 
 
s 
, the 
cumulative ratio of successful case 
ascertainment for the years state  
s 
participated in reporting. Letting  
 
Ob

y, 
s 
 
be the number of cases 
reported and  
φ 
be the set of pairs

for which reporting to the CDC 
CLPPP occurred, we specify

θ

is therefore a reflection of the 
successful case ascertainment by 
clinicians that avoids penalizing those 
in states that did not participate in 
reporting during specific years of 
the study period. Intuitively  
 
θ 
 
s 
can 
be thought of as an ascertainment 
success rate ranging from 0% to 
100%, with the provisos mentioned 
above that some of its values may 
exceed 100%, and some states with 
perfect case ascertainment may have 
values of <100%.
RESULTS
About 1.2 million children are 
estimated to have had EBLL during 
the period 1999 to 2010. Of these, 
roughly half (606 709) were reported 
to the CDC. Of the remainder, 
∼45% (278 299) occurred in years 
during which the child’s state was 
not reporting to the CDC, and 55% 
(337 405) were not reported because 
of incomplete case ascertainment in 
states engaged in reporting efforts.
Region-Level Ascertainment
Region-level ascertainment is 
depicted in Fig 1. The length of 
each bar is the projected number 
of children having EBLL during the 
study period, and the colors reflect 
the reporting categories discussed 
above. Although the greatest number 
of children reported as having 
EBLL occurred in the Midwest and 
Northeast, the greatest number 
of cases occurred in the South. 
Although the smallest number of 
cases occurred in the West, this was 
also the region with the greatest 
proportion of missed cases (89%) 
due both to ineffective ascertainment 
and to nonparticipation in the CDC 
CLPPP. Excluding nonparticipating 
states and years, proportions of 
EBLL cases that were reported in 
the Northeast, Midwest, South, and 
West were 99.5%, 94.3%, 25.3%, and 
21.8%, respectively.
State-Level Ascertainment
Ascertainment ratios  
 
θ 
 
s 
are listed in 
 
Table 2 and displayed graphically 
in Fig 2. As expected, several 
states have ratios slightly below or 
substantially exceeding 1.0, which 
may be interpreted as evidence 
that clinicians in these states 
captured nearly all the EBLL cases 
that occurred (or at least a lack of 
evidence suggesting otherwise). 
Most disconcerting is the finding that 
the summary  
θ 
value is well below 
this number at 0.64; because the 
summary value can be considered 
similar to a population mean, 
it suggests that a portion of the 
population of states is associated 
with substantial underdetection.
The majority of the states (23) 
reported fewer than half of the 
expected number of EBLL cases, and 
11 reported <20%. Although for 
statistical reasons we expect some 
states to have values substantially 
<1.0, the positive skewness of this 
distribution (ie, the large number 
of states with  
 
θ 
 
s 
<0.5) is striking. In 
the absence of epidemiologic data 
demonstrating that the prevalence of 
EBLL in any of these states is lower 
than estimated, underreporting (and 
therefore undertesting) should be 
considered potentially endemic in 
these states.
Although selected characteristics 
of participating states’ guidelines 
for clinicians are displayed in the 
right-hand columns of Table 2, no 
configuration of guidelines appears

to be associated with consistently 
high case ascertainment. This finding 
conforms to our impression that 
clinicians are often unaware of the 
guidelines, and if they are aware, 
then lack of enforcement undermines 
any effect they might have on 
clinician behavior.
DISCUSSION
We used prevalence estimates 
among the 50 states plus District of 
Columbia to calculate the expected 
number of children with EBLL 
over the period 1999 to 2012 and 
compared these with the numbers 
reported to the CDC. Among 
participating states during years with 
complete reporting, 36% of children 
with EBLL (equal to 337 405 cases) 
were not documented. If we extend 
this ascertainment rate to include 
nonparticipating states, then the 
number of nondocumented cases 
becomes 437 593. Although we find

no evidence of underascertainment 
in a number of states, the majority 
appear to successfully identify fewer 
than half of their children with EBLL. 
Because our prevalence projections 
may be low, these estimates of 
nonascertained children may be 
considered conservative.
After the removal of lead from 
gasoline and residential paint 
products, the prevalence of 
EBLL among children declined 
dramatically23; consistent with this 
trend, state and federal regulations 
and guidelines have become less 
demanding over time. Whereas in 
1991 CDC guidelines recommended 
universal screening, in 1997 the 
CDC formally began deferring to 
individual states to generate their 
own guidelines, ideally including the 
testing of all Medicaid beneficiaries, 
and suggested universal testing 
only in the absence of a state-level 
plan.24 Beginning in 2009, the 
recommendation of universal testing 
of Medicaid beneficiaries was itself 
softened25 to one of questionnaire-
based screening26 for the need 
for testing. Federal reasoning 
throughout this time was that 
states and localities would be able 
to formulate “data-driven policies” 
regarding EBLL prevalence in their 
jurisdictions, although population-
based prevalence studies for these 
jurisdictions were neither funded nor 
required.
Despite this relaxation of standards, 
concerns that only a fraction of 
children with EBLL were being 
detected were ongoing during 
this period. The US General 
Accounting Office determined in 
1999 that only 11% of Medicaid 
beneficiaries were tested, 
5 and as 
of 2001 only 17% of the estimated 
numbers of cases nationally were 
diagnosed by clinicians.27 Even then 
ascertainment success varied from 
state to state, with many states 
reporting disproportionately few 
cases relative to objective measures 
such as the age of their housing 
stock.27 Numbers of tests generally 
increased through 2010, which along 
with our conservative prevalence 
estimates may account for the high 
ascertainment ratio of 64% reported 
here.
Particularly in nonreporting states, 
some of the children with EBLL 
missing from the CDC tally may have 
been diagnosed and received case 
management services (see McClure 
et al28 for an analysis of BLL testing 
that includes some of these states). 
Conversely, however, many that were 
diagnosed and reported received no 
environmental mitigation services. 
Protocols for monitoring and service 
provision for children with EBLL 
vary by state and locality, including 
thresholds for case management 
and types of services eligible for 
Medicaid reimbursement.29 The 
budget for the CDC Childhood Lead 
Poisoning and Healthy Homes 
program was itself reduced from $29 
million to $2 million in 2012, leading 
to a loss of 57% of state positions 
responsible for primary prevention, 
environmental assessments, 
enforcements of lead-safe building 
laws, and outreach and education to 
lay and professional audiences, as 
well as for surveillance itself.30
Since the close of the study period in 
2010, the public health community’s 
ability to rely on NHANES for EBLL 
surveillance has eroded in 2 respects. 
First, ostensibly because of the 
history of item nonresponse, NCHS 
began omitting age of housing from 
NHANES questionnaires after this 
time. Also, temporal declines in the 
prevalence of EBLL mean that the 
NHANES sample size (∼630 children 
of the appropriate age per year) is 
inadequate to detect meaningful 
numbers of cases in a survey cycle. As 
a result, NHANES data more recent 
than 2010 are not amenable to the 
type of analysis presented here, 
and clinician reporting is becoming 
our sole source of population-level 
information with which to steer 
public health policy and action.
At the same time, EBLL remains an 
ongoing threat to the health of the 
nation’s children. Although events in 
Flint, Michigan focused the attention 
of the American public, 
31 subsequent 
analyses have demonstrated 
that thousands of communities 
throughout the country are known 
to have higher prevalences of EBLL 
based on the partial reporting that 
does occur.32 Furthermore, the 
ongoing phenomena of race- and 
class-based segregation and our 
aging infrastructure dictate that 
we have no guarantee that EBLL 
prevalence will fall uniformly 
over time or equally among all 
communities. Many of the children

enumerated in the current study 
are currently school age and need 
additional resources for their 
education; in all, child EBLL costs 
the United States ∼$50 billion in lost 
economic productivity annually.33
American Academy of Pediatrics 
policy, including that expressed in 
Healthy Futures protocols for well 
child assessments, explicitly defers to 
state and local health departments to 
decide when children should undergo 
BLL testing.1 
– 
3 This policy is based 
on 2 assumptions, however: that 
well-resourced public health agencies 
will communicate effectively with 
providers, enabling them to make 
data-directed decisions about when 
to test for EBLL, and that statutory 
requirements for testing would 
be accompanied by mechanisms 
and resources for enforcement. 
Both of these assumptions have 
proven to be false, with the effect 
that large numbers of children 
with EBLL (indeed, the majority 
of these children in many parts of 
the country) have been missed by 
clinicians.
Departments of public health should 
reach out to providers and make sure 
their guidelines are accessible and 
feasible given the typical provider’s 
skill set and time availability. Ideally 
they should conduct population-
based EBLL prevalence studies 
that would produce more reliable 
estimates than our model-based ones 
and enable allocations of resources to 
assist communities most in need.
Clinicians should not wait for 
their state and local agencies to be 
granted sufficient resources to act, 
however; those in states with poor 
ascertainment need to begin testing 
more aggressively. They also need 
to inform themselves about how 
to counsel parents in the event of a 
positive finding. This information 
includes knowledge of resources 
set aside by states and localities for 
environmental remediation and 
legal protections against retaliatory 
rent increases and evictions by 
landlords.34
CONCLUSIONS
We compared observed counts 
of EBLL cases among children 12 
months to 5 years of age reported 
to the CDC during 1999 to 2010 
with expected counts based on 
the NHANES population-based 
surveys. During this period, 1 in 3 
children believed to have EBLL in 
participating states went unreported. 
Although the majority of reported 
cases resided in the Northeast 
and Midwest, the largest numbers 
of children with EBLL resided 
in the South, and pronounced 
underreporting took place in the 
South and West. We also identified 
states for which underascertainment 
of EBLL cases appears to have 
been endemic during this period. 
Unless population-based studies can 
demonstrate EBLL prevalence to be 
lower than our estimates suggest 
in these states, clinicians there are 
urged to pursue more aggressive 
testing.
