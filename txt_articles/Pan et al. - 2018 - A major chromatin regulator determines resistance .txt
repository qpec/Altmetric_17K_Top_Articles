Abstract
Many human cancers are resistant to immunotherapy, for reasons that are poorly understood. We 
used a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to 
killing by cytotoxic T cells, the central effectors of antitumor immunity. Inactivation of >100 
genes—including Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7, which encode components of the PBAF form of the 
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex—sensitized mouse B16F10 melanoma cells to killing 
by T cells. Loss of PBAF function increased tumor cell sensitivity to interferon-γ, resulting in 
enhanced secretion of chemokines that recruit effector T cells. Treatment-resistant tumors became 
responsive to immunotherapy when Pbrm1 was inactivated. In many human cancers, expression of 
PBRM1 and ARID2 inversely correlated with expression of T cell cytotoxicity genes, and Pbrm1-
deficient murine melanomas were more strongly infiltrated by cytotoxic T cells.
Cancer immunotherapies that target inhibitory receptors on T cells, including the PD-1 
receptor, can induce durable responses, but most patients do not respond (1). The

 mechanisms that determine resistance to these immunotherapies remain poorly understood. 
Cytotoxic T cells are key effectors of tumor immunity on the basis of their ability to detect 
and kill transformed cells following T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide antigens 
bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins (2). T cell–mediated 
cytotoxicity can be especially efficient, but it is diminished when MHC class I expression by 
tumor cells is reduced. Cytotoxicity is also inhibited when tumor cells express PD-L1, the 
ligand for the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells (3). We hypothesized that 
sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells to T cell–mediated attack is dynamically regulated 
by multiple pathways in tumor cells that could represent new targets for immunotherapy.
Discovery of tumor cell–intrinsic genes regulating sensitivity and 
resistance to T cell–mediated killing
Tumor cells transduced with a genome-scale gRNA library were subjected to selection with 
cytotoxic T cells to identify genes that controlled resistance to T cell–mediated killing (Fig. 
1A). We selected the murine B16F10 melanoma cell line for this screen because it is 
resistant to checkpoint blockade with antibodies targeting the PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 
(cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4) receptors (4, 5). Inactivation of resistance 
genes resulted in depletion of the corresponding gRNAs, but such depletion could only be 
detected with sufficient sensitivity when most tumor cells had sufficient Cas9 activity. We 
therefore selected a B16F10-Cas9 clone with high editing efficiency (fig. S1) and tested it 
with positive controls that were either more resistant (B2m−/−) or sensitive (Cd274−/−) to T 
cell–mediated cytotoxicity (fig. S2). This B16F10-Cas9 clone was then transduced with a 
genome-scale gRNA library in a lentiviral vector (6). Selection was performed either with 
Pmel-1 T cells, which have a relatively low TCR affinity for an endogenous melanoma 
antigen (7), or high-affinity OT-I T cells (8). Edited tumor cells were selected by 3-day 
coculture with Pmel-1 CD8 T cells (or 1 day for OT-I T cells), and the representation of all 
gRNAs was quantified by Illumina sequencing of the gRNA cassette (Fig. 1A). The 
specificity of gRNA enrichment or depletion was demonstrated by comparing selection with 
tumor-specific T cells versus control T cells of irrelevant specificity (fig. S3). This 
comparison also controlled for potential effects of gRNAs on cell proliferation and viability.
A number of genes known to be essential for T cell–mediated tumor immunity were 
identified among the enriched gRNAs in both Pmel-1 and OT-I screens (Fig. 1B, fig. S4A, 
and tables S1 and S2), including key genes in the MHC class I and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 
signaling pathways (9–11). Mutations in both MHC and interferon pathway genes were 
shown to confer resistance to cancer immunotherapy (12, 13). T cell–based CRISPR-Cas9 
screens have been described by two other laboratories. One of these studies performed an in 
vivo screen covering 2368 murine genes and highlighted the phosphatase Ptpn2 as a new 
target for immunotherapy (14). The second study focused on human tumor cells and T cells 
and reported that mutations in APLNR render tumor cells resistant to T cell–mediated 
cytotoxicity (15). Our approach emphasized sensitive detection of depleted gRNAs in a 
genome-wide manner, which allowed us to discover additional mechanisms conferring 
resistance to immunotherapy.

 A notable result was that gRNAs were depleted for a large number of genes (tables S1 and 
S2), indicating that inactivation of these genes sensitized tumor cells to T cell–mediated 
killing. Top genes in this group included known negative immune regulators, including 
Cd274 [encoding PD-L1 (16, 17)], Ptpn2 (18), and Serpinb9 (19) (Fig. 1C and fig. S4B). 
However, the vast majority of identified genes had not been previously implicated in 
resistance to T cell–mediated killing (tables S1 and S2).
Pathways regulating resistance of tumor cells to T cell–mediated 
cytotoxicity
We performed gene set enrichment analysis to identify known gene sets and pathways for 
genes corresponding to enriched or depleted gRNAs (tables S3 and S4). Five negative 
regulators of the Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway were identified 
among enriched gRNAs, including Nf1 (20), Dusp6 (21), Spred1 (22), Rasa2 (23), and 
SPOP (24) (Fig. 1D). Ras pathway activation is very common among human cancers and 
may not only promote tumor cell growth but also attenuate tumor immunity. Braf is 
immediately downstream of Ras, and small-molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAFV600E elicit 
stronger cytotoxic T cell responses in melanoma patients and murine tumor models (25–27).
Analysis of depleted gRNAs revealed a number of resistance pathways to T cell–mediated 
killing (Fig. 1, C and D, and table S4). All three unique components of a SWI/SNF 
chromatin remodeling complex referred to as the polybromo and BRG1-associated factors 
(PBAF) complex (28, 29) were strongly depleted (Arid2, Pbrm1, and Brd7), providing 
strong evidence that this complex conferred resistance to T cell–mediated killing (Fig. 1D). 
We also identified resistance genes in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (30) (Otulin, 
Rela, Ikbkg, Ikbkb, Rnf31, and Sharpin) and key metabolic pathways, including mTORC1 
(mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) [Rraga, Rragc, and Lamtor1, which are 
required for mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes (31)], glycolysis (including Nsdhl, Gne, 
Gale, Ero1l, and Cd44), and nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism (including Nadk and 
Nampt). The NF-κB pathway was also identified as a resistance mechanism by Manguso et 
al. (14). Control experiments demonstrated that inactivation of such genes did not merely 
increase sensitivity to cell death; inactivation of representative genes (Otulin, Dusp6, or Nf1) 
in B16F10-Cas9 cells did not render them more sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cell death 
(fig. S5). Most of the identified genes (253 of 313 genes) were validated in a secondary 
screen (fig. S6), which also confirmed the major pathways described above (fig. S7).
Clinical relevance of PBAF complex to tumor immunity
We used TCGA RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets and TIMER (32) to examine the 
relevance of the CRIPSR screen (fig. S8) and PBAF complex in human cancers. We found 
that mRNA levels of ARID2 and PBRM1 negatively correlated with GZMB and PRF1 
mRNA levels in many human cancer types (Fig. 2A; fig. S9, A and B; and table S5), 
suggesting that lower expression of ARID2 and PBRM1 is correlated with higher cytotoxic 
activity contributed by CD8 T cells (fig. S9, C and D) in human cancers. This correlation 
was not merely explained by the degree of CD8 T cell infiltration because ARID2 and 
PBRM1 mRNA levels were also negatively associated with the GZMB/CD8A ratio (Fig.

 2B). In addition, we found that low ARID2 mRNA levels were associated with a substantial 
survival benefit in melanoma patients, but only for those tumors with a higher degree of 
infiltration by CD8 T cells (on the basis of CD8 expression) (Fig. 2C). These data suggest 
that ARID2 and PBRM1 affect tumor immunity in a variety of human cancers.
Relevance of PBAF complex to immune checkpoint blockade therapy
The SWI/SNF complex regulates chromatin accessibility for transcription factors. The BAF 
version of SWI/SNF induces dissociation of Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 
and PRC2) (33), but the PBAF complex may operate through a different biochemical 
mechanism. The two complexes share core subunits, but unique components are ARID1A/B 
for the BAF (BRG1-associated factors) complex as well as ARID2, PBRM1, and BRD7 for 
the PBAF complex (Fig. 3A) (28). To validate the role of the PBAF complex in regulating 
sensitivity to T cell–mediated killing, we generated B16F10 tumor cell lines in which the 
three genes of the PBAF complex were individually mutated by CRISPR-Cas9. Western 
blotting experiments confirmed diminished amounts of the corresponding proteins in the 
mutant cell lines (Fig. 3B). Inactivation of Arid2 diminished protein abundance of BRD7 
and PBRM1, consistent with a prior study (34), whereas inactivation of Pbrm1 did not affect 
protein abundance of ARID2 or BRD7. Partial complexes with some chromatin remodeling 
activity may therefore remain in some of these knockout cell lines. Coculture of Arid2, 
Pbrm1, or Brd7 mutant tumor cells with cytotoxic T cells resulted in enhanced depletion of 
PBAF mutant cell lines compared to B16F10-Cas9 cells transduced with a control gRNA 
(referred to as control B16F10 tumor cells) in a 3-day coculture assay (Fig. 3C). However, 
inactivation of Arid2, Pbrm1, or Brd7 genes did not alter cell proliferation over a 2-week 
period (fig. S10A).
B16F10 tumor cells are resistant to checkpoint blockade with antibodies against PD-1 (anti–
PD-1) and/or anti–CTLA-4, and we therefore examined whether inactivation of Pbrm1 
would render B16F10 tumor cells sensitive to checkpoint blockade. Anti–PD-1 plus anti–
CTLA-4 conferred therapeutic benefit in mice bearing Pbrm1 mutant B16F10 tumors, but 
this treatment was ineffective against control B16F10 tumors (Fig. 3, D and E, and fig. S10, 
B and C). Significantly increased numbers of CD45+ immune cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, 
and granzyme B+ CD8 T cells were present in Pbrm1-deficient compared to control B16F10 
tumors treated with PD-1 plus CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade (Fig. 3F and fig. S10D). 
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of sorted CD45+ immune cells showed that gene expression 
signatures associated with productive antitumor immunity (IFN-γ response, IFN-α 
response, and tumor necrosis factor α signaling via NF-κB) were significantly enriched in 
Pbrm1-deficient compared to control B16F10 tumors for both myeloid cells (dendritic cells 
and M1-like macrophages) and lymphoid cells (T cells and natural killer cells) (fig. S11, A 
to C). These single-cell data also identified an increased percentage of dendritic cells and a 
higher ratio of tumor-inhibitory M1-like macrophages to tumor-promoting M2-like 
macrophages in Pbrm1-deficient compared to control B16F10 tumors (fig. S11D). Thus, 
inactivation of Pbrm1 not only sensitizes tumor cells to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity but also 
results in a more favorable tumor microenvironment.

 Regulation of IFN-γ and mTORC1 pathways by the PBAF complex
To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the PBAF complex regulates the 
sensitivity of B16F10 tumor cells to T cell–mediated killing, we examined the transcriptome 
of PBAF-deficient B16F10 cells by RNA-seq. Arid2- and Pbrm1-deficient B16F10 cells 
shared similar gene expression profiles (fig. S12, A and B), consistent with their critical role 
in the PBAF complex. The transcriptome of Brd7 mutant B16F10 cells was more distinct, 
suggesting that Brd7 may also have PBAF-independent functions (fig. S12A). mRNAs for a 
number of metabolic pathways were concordantly down-regulated in Arid2 and Pbrm1 
mutant cells compared to control B16F10 tumor cells, in particular gene sets associated with 
mTORC1 activation and cholesterol homeostasis (fig. S12, C and D, and fig. S13). 
mTORC1 was also a major resistance pathway for T cell–mediated cytotoxicity in the 
CRISPR-Cas9 screen (Fig. 1D).
Silencing of BAF200 (Arid2) with a small interfering RNA was shown to reduce the 
expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) by IFN-α but not other 
interferon-regulated genes (34). We systematically examined whether the PBAF complex 
regulates gene expression in response to IFN-γ, given the importance of this T cell–derived 
cytokine for tumor immunity (12). RNA-seq analysis showed that gene sets related to IFN-γ 
and IFN-α response were significantly enriched among genes concordantly up-regulated in 
Arid2- and Pbrm1-deficient cells compared to B16F10 control cells treated with IFN-γ (Fig. 
4, A and B), suggesting that ARID2 and PBRM1 suppressed the expression of IFN-γ–
responsive genes. Many of the IFN-γ–responsive genes suppressed by Arid2 and Pbrm1 
were relevant to innate immunity or encoded chemokines (Cxcl9 and Cxcl10) (Fig. 4C) (35). 
Pbrm1-deficient tumor cells also secreted substantially larger amounts of CXCL9 and 
CXCL10—key chemokines for recruitment of effector T cells that express the CXCR3 
chemokine receptor—compared to control B16F10 cells following IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 
4, D to F) (35). Arid2-deficient cells had significantly increased surface levels of H2-Kb over 
a range of IFN-γ concentrations compared to control B16F10 cells. Also, all three mutants 
showed increased surface expression of PD-L1 in response to IFN-γ (fig. S14). Brd7- and 
Pbrm1-deficient cells only showed enhanced surface expression of PD-L1 but not H2-Kb in 
response to IFN-γ stimulation (fig. S14), which may be due to partial complexes that retain 
some activity. These data demonstrate that Arid2 and Pbrm1 attenuate the responsiveness of 
B16F10 tumor cells to IFN-γ, a key cytokine for the interaction of tumor cells and T cells.
The PBAF complex regulates chromatin accessibility of IFN-γ–inducible 
genes
The major function of the SWI/SNF complex is to regulate chromatin accessibility for 
transcription factors. We therefore performed ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin using sequencing) to directly assess chromatin accessibility in Pbrm1-deficient 
and control B16F10 tumor cells with and without IFN-γ treatment for 24 hours. Following 
IFN-γ treatment, a substantially larger number of genomic sites were accessible in Pbrm1-
deficient than control B16F10 cells, consistent with the RNA-seq data (Fig. 5A). Sites in 
cluster 1 (648 sites) were more accessible before IFN-γ treatment in Pbrm1-deficient

 compared to control cells, suggesting that the corresponding genes were poised to respond to 
IFN-γ (Fig. 5, B and C, and fig. S15A). Also, 2708 sites (cluster III) showed enhanced 
accessibility following IFN-γ exposure in Pbrm1 mutant compared to control B16F10 cells, 
but their accessibility was similar between the two cell lines in the absence of IFN-γ (Fig. 5, 
B and C, and fig. S15B). Motif and target gene prediction analysis suggests that these sites 
were highly enriched with interferon regulatory factor (IRF) motifs and associated with IFN-
regulated genes (fig. S15, C to E). Thus, inactivation of Pbrm1 enhances chromatin 
accessibility for transcription factors at promoters or enhancers of many IFN-γ-inducible 
genes.
Discussion
These data demonstrate that resistance to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity is regulated by many 
genes and pathways in tumor cells. The corresponding gene products represent targets for 
immunotherapy because inactivating mutations sensitize tumor cells to T cell–mediated 
attack. The interaction between T cells and tumor cells is dynamically regulated at many 
levels, including innate immune and metabolic pathways within tumor cells. The PBAF 
complex is of particular interest because it reduces chromatin accessibility for IFN-γ–
inducible genes within tumor cells and thereby increases resistance to T cell–mediated 
cytotoxicity.
The PBAF complex is a tumor suppressor, and inactivating mutations in any of the three 
unique genes of this complex (PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7) are known to occur in a variety 
of human cancers (28). For example, inactivating mutations in PBRM1 are prevalent in clear 
cell renal cancer (~41% of patients) (36). A study by Miao et al. in this issue demonstrates 
that PBRM1 mutations in metastatic renal cancers are associated with improved clinical 
responses to PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade (37). Mutations in ARID2 and BRD7 are also 
observed in a variety of other human cancers, including ARID2 mutations in melanoma 
(38). Human tumors with inactivating mutations in PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7 may 
therefore be more sensitive to PD-1 blockade as well as other forms of immunotherapy in 
which cytotoxic T cells serve as the main effector mechanism, including cancer vaccines and 
adoptive T cell therapies. This study provides a mechanistic understanding for these clinical 
findings by demonstrating that PBAF-deficient tumor cells are more sensitive to T cell–
mediated cytotoxicity. We also show that PBAF-deficient tumor cells produce higher 
amounts of chemokines (Cxcl9 and Cxcl10) in response to IFN-γ, resulting in more efficient 
recruitment of effector T cells into tumors (35).
The immunotherapy field has thus far emphasized the targeting of inhibitory receptors 
expressed by immune cells. We propose that targeting of tumor cell–intrinsic resistance 
mechanisms to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity will be important to extend the benefit of 
immunotherapy to larger patient populations, including those with cancers that thus far are 
refractory to immunotherapy.

 Fig. 1. Systematic discovery of genes and pathways regulating sensitivity and resistance of tumor 
cells to Tcell–mediated killing
(A) Screening strategy. Cas9-expressing B16F10 cells were transduced with a genome-scale 
gRNA library (four gRNAs/gene). Edited B16F10 cells were cocultured with activated 
cytotoxic T cells followed by Illumina sequencing of gRNA representation. Specific 
selection was performed with Pmel-1 T cells (specific for gp100 melanoma antigen) or OT-I 
T cells (specific for Ova peptide). Control selection was performed with T cells of irrelevant 
specificity. (B) Top genes for enriched gRNAs from Pmel-1 screen. Candidate genes were 
plotted based on mean log2 fold change of gRNA counts compared to control selection and 
P values computed by MaGeCK (Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
Knockout). Dashed line indicates a FDR (false discovery rate) of 0.05. Annotated genes 
represent MHC class I (red), interferon (yellow), and Ras/MAPK (blue) pathways. (C) Top 
genes for depleted gRNAs from Pmel-1 screen. Genes related to the PBAF form of 
SWI/SNF complex (red), NF-κB pathway (blue), mTORC1 pathway (yellow), and known 
negative immune regulators (green) were annotated. (D) Selected pathways and 
corresponding genes identified in the Pmel-1 screen. Color scale represents log2 fold change 
of average gRNA representation.

 Fig. 2. Expression of ARID2 and PBRM1 is negatively correlated with T cell cytotoxicity 
markers in TCGA data sets
(A) Correlation of ARID2 and PBRM1 mRNA levels with GZMB mRNA levels in indicated 
cancers. Volcano plot showing the Spearman’s correlation and estimated significance of 
ARID2 (left) or PBRM1 (right) with GZMB mRNA levels from RNA-seq data across 
TCGA cancer types calculated by TIMER (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource) and 
adjusted for tumor purity (32). Each dot represents a cancer type in TCGA; red dots indicate 
significant correlations (P < 0.01). (B) Analysis of ARID2 and PBRM1 mRNA levels in 
relation to GZMB and CD8A as cytotoxicity and CD8 T cell infiltration markers, 
respectively. Spearman’s correlation of ARID2 (left) and PBRM1 (right) mRNA levels to 
GZMB/CD8A mRNA ratio in the TCGA melanoma data set. (C) Correlation of ARID2 
expression level with survival of melanoma patients depending on calculated level of CD8 T 
cell infiltration. All patients in the TCGA melanoma study were divided according to the 
expression level of ARID2 (higher or lower than mean expression value of all patients). The 
impact of ARID2 expression level on survival is shown for patients whose tumors had higher 
(>1 SD) or lower (<1 SD) expression of CD8 [(CD8A + CD8B)/2].

 Fig. 3. Inactivation of PBAF complex sensitizes tumor cells to T cell–mediated killing and 
synergizes with checkpoint blockade therapy
(A) Cartoon illustrating the composition of BAF and PBAF versions of SWI/SNF complex. 
(B) Western blot showing protein abundance of ARID2, BRD7, PBRM1, and GAPDH in 
control and indicated knockout cell lines. (C) Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–positive 
Arid2-, Pbrm1-, or Brd7-deficient B16F10 cells were mixed with GFP-negative control 
B16F10 cells at approximately 1:1 ratio. Tumor cells were cocultured with Pmel-1 Tcells at 
indicated effector-to-target ratios for 3 days in triplicates; the fold change of the percentage 
of GFP-positive tumor cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Two-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical significance (****P < 
0.0001). Values represent mean ± SD. (D) Mice bearing control (n = 10) or Pbrm1-deficient 
B16F10 tumors (n = 10) were treated with anti–PD-1 (α-PD-1, 200 μg/mouse) plus anti–
CTLA-4 (α-CTLA-4, 100 μg/mouse), and tumor size was measured. Two-way ANOVA was 
used to determine statistical significance for time points when all mice were viable for tumor 
measurement. (E) Survival of mice inoculated with control (n = 10) or Pbrm1-deficient 
B16F10 cells (n = 10) and treated with α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test 
was used to determine statistical significance. (F) Flow cytometric analysis of immune cell 
infiltration in Pbrm1-deficient and control B16F10 tumors. The number of CD45+, CD4+, 
CD8+, and Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells was determined per gram of tumor. Mann-Whitney 
test was used to determine significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Values represent mean ± 
SD. Data in (C) to (F) are representative of two independent experiments.

 Fig. 4. Enhanced responsiveness to IFN-γ stimulation by Arid2- and Pbrm1-deficient tumor cells
(A to C) RNA-seq analysis of Arid2- or Pbrm1-deficient cells and control B16F10 cells 
treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours. (A) Venn diagram showing differentially 
regulated mRNAs in the presence of IFN-γ. (B) Hallmark gene sets enriched for commonly 
up- or downregulated mRNAs in both Arid2- and Pbrm1-deficient cells compared to control 
B16F10 cells in the presence of IFN-γ treatment [as shown in (A)]. (C) Heat map showing 
expression value (z-score based on cufflink count) of interferon-responsive genes in control, 
Arid2-, and Pbrm1-deficient B16F10 cells following IFN-γ treatment. (D and E) Cxcl9 
mRNA level (D) and Cxcl9 protein secretion (E) comparing Pbrm1-deficient and control 
B16F10 tumor cells stimulated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Values represent mean 
± SD. (F) Cxcl10 secretion by Pbrm1-deficient and control B16F10 tumor cells stimulated 
with IFN-γ (0, 0.5, and 1 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Values represent mean ± SD. One-way 
ANOVA (D and E) and two-way ANOVA (F) were used to determine significance. **P < 
0.01, ****P < 0.0001. Data in (D) and (F) are representative of two independent 
experiments.
