SUMMARY
Latent replication-competent HIV-1 persists in indi-
viduals on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART).
We developed the Full-Length Individual Proviral
Sequencing (FLIPS) assay to determine the distribu-
tion of latent replication-competent HIV-1 within
memory CD4+ T cell subsets in six individuals on
long-term ART. FLIPS is an efficient, high-throughput
assay that amplifies and sequences near full-length
(�9 kb) HIV-1 proviral genomes and determines
potential replication competency through genetic
characterization. FLIPS provides a genome-scale
perspective that addresses the limitations of other
methods that also genetically characterize the latent
reservoir. Using FLIPS, we identified 5% of provi-
ruses as intact and potentially replication competent.
Intact proviruses were unequally distributed be-
tween T cell subsets, with effector memory cells
containing the largest proportion of genetically intact
HIV-1 proviruses. We identified multiple identical
intact proviruses, suggesting a role for cellular
proliferation in the maintenance of the latent HIV-1
reservoir.
INTRODUCTION
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) successfully suppresses HIV-1 repli-
cation, reduces viral load, and increases the life expectancy of
infected individuals (Palella et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2008).
Despite this, ART is not curative, as HIV-1 remains latent in
resting memory CD4+ T cells not targeted by ART or the immune
system (Finzi et al., 1997). Bruner et al. (2016) recently demon-
strated that 93%–98% of latent proviruses in HIV-infected
individuals on ART are defective and replication incompetent.
Common mechanisms that contribute to defective proviruses
include mutations from an error-prone HIV-1 reverse transcrip-
tase (Abram et al., 2010), template switching during reverse tran-
scription (Ho et al., 2013), and/or apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-induced hyper-
mutation (Harris et al., 2003; Lecossier et al., 2003). Despite
the high prevalence of defective proviruses, it is clear that repli-
cation-competent proviruses persist in individuals on long-term
ART, as viral load rapidly rebounds if therapy is interrupted
(Chun et al., 2010; Davey et al., 1999). Determining the source
of latent replication-competent HIV-1 is vital to identifying
cellular targets for future curative strategies.
Genetic characterization of the latent HIV-1 reservoir is an
important tool for understanding persistent HIV-1 during long-
term ART. Single-proviral sequencing (Josefsson et al., 2013a)
and single-genome sequencing (SPS/SGS) (Palmer et al.,
2005) are methods that genetically characterize sub-genomic
regions of the HIV-1 genome. SPS/SGS have provided insight
into the distribution, dynamics, and persistence of the latent
HIV-1 reservoir (Josefsson et al., 2013b; Evering et al., 2012;
Chomont et al., 2009; von Stockenstrom et al., 2015), yet these
methods are limited because they target sub-genomic regions
of the HIV-1 genome and therefore cannot capture the complete
diversity and replication competency of the HIV-1 proviruses.
Furthermore, the use of SPS/SGS has identified large expan-
sions of identical HIV-1 sequences, suggesting that cellular
proliferation contributes to the persistence of HIV-1 during ther-
apy, but it remains unknown whether these HIV-1 sequences are
identical or even intact throughout the entire HIV-1 genome

 (Laskey et al., 2016). Full-length HIV-1 proviral sequencing
methods, which sequence �9 kb of the HIV-1 genome, over-
come the limitations of SPS. Previously available full-length
HIV-1 proviral sequencing methods have provided insight into
the prevalence and development of defective proviruses (Bruner
et al., 2016; Ho et al., 2013). These assays require multiple inter-
nal sequencing primers that carry the risk of erroneously identi-
fying defective proviruses and make resolving the entire proviral
sequence technically challenging. Additionally, it is possible that
these methods may not capture the entire population of provi-
ruses present in an individual as, due to the number and
complexity of primers used, these methods may be influenced
by primer mismatches. In response to these limitations, we
and
others
have
developed
next-generation
sequencing
(NGS)-based assays to sequence near-full-length HIV-1 provi-
ruses (Lee et al., 2017; Imamichi et al., 2016). Here, we present
the Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing (FLIPS) assay: a
high-throughput assay utilizing NGS to sequence single, full-
length HIV-1 proviruses and predict their potential replication
competency by comparative genomics. We apply FLIPS to
determine the distribution of intact and potentially replication-
competent proviruses within memory CD4+ T cell subsets
isolated from six individuals on long-term ART and demonstrate
the advantages of FLIPS over existing sequencing methods.
RESULTS
FLIPS
In conducting the FLIPS assay, NGS is used to sequence single
(intact and defective) HIV-1 proviruses. Two rounds of nested
PCR run at limiting dilution using primers that target the highly
conserved 50 and 30 U5 long terminal repeat (LTR) regions are
used to amplify �9 kb of the HIV-1 genome (Figure 1A). High-
throughput NGS of amplified proviruses is undertaken on the
Illumina MiSeq platform, and individual proviral contigs are
generated by de novo assembly. To identify defective provi-
ruses, a stringent process of elimination is used (Figure 1B)
whereby proviruses containing inversion sequences, large inter-
nal deletions (>100 bp), hypermutation/deleterious stop codons,
frameshifts, or mutations in the packaging signal or major splice

 donor (MSD) site are defined as defective and replication incom-
petent. Proviruses lacking these defects are considered geneti-
cally intact and potentially replication competent. In optimizing
the FLIPS assay, we first determined the extent to which FLIPS
amplifies the HIV-1 DNA present in a sample. To do this, we
diluted the HIV-1 plasmid pWT/BaL (obtained through the
AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], NIH: HIV-1 HXB3/BaL
Infectious Molecular Clone (pWT/BaL) from Dr. Bryan R. Cullen)
from 20 copies down to 1 copy and performed multiple full-
length PCR reactions at each dilution, recording the number of
reactions with amplified product (Figure 1E). The number of pos-
itive reactions decreased with the number of templates per reac-
tion, with FLIPS amplifying 5% of the reactions when pWT/BaL
was diluted to 1 and 2 copies per reaction. In calculating the
Poisson distribution for this experiment, the expected number
of amplified templates per reaction closely matched the actual
number of copies per reaction, supporting that, at dilutions of
1 and 2 copies per well, the amplified products originate from
a single template.
The classification of a sequenced provirus as intact relies on
the absence of deletions, insertions, and/or mutations. Next, it
was important to determine the error rate of the FLIPS assay,
as polymerase errors could artificially introduce defects within
the final proviral contig. We amplified the intact pWT/BaL
plasmid at limiting dilution and sequenced 10 amplicons that
we compared to the available pWT/BaL reference sequence.
None of the sequences contained deletions or insertions; how-
ever, one sequence contained a single nucleotide change (CjT)
at position 1519 (relative to HXB2). This allowed determination
of the error rate for the FLIPS assay as 1 change in every
89,330 nt sequenced (or 1.12 3 10�5 nt�1) (confidence interval,
1 in 16,000 to 1 in 3,530,000).
Latent HIV-1 Reservoirs of Individuals on Long-Term
ART Contain Few Genetically Intact Proviruses
Replication-competent proviruses persist in a latent state in indi-
viduals on suppressive ART, and viral load rapidly rebounds
upon the cessation of therapy (Chun et al., 2010; Davey et al.,
1999). Previous studies have identified latent replication-compe-
tent HIV-1 in a number of CD4+ T cell subsets including naive
(TN), central (TCM), transitional (TTM), and effector (TEM) memory
(Chomont et al., 2009; Soriano-Sarabia et al., 2014). To deter-
mine whether the distribution of potentially replication-compe-
tent HIV-1 proviruses was different between cell subsets, we
applied the FLIPS assay to genetically characterize the latent
HIV-1 reservoir in different CD4+ T cell subsets isolated from
the peripheral blood of participants on long-term suppressive
ART. We obtained TN, TCM, TTM, and TEM CD4+ T cell subsets
from six participants who were on suppressive ART for
3–17 years (3 initiated ART during acute/early infection (2115,
2275, and 2302), and 3 initiated ART during chronic infection
(2026, 2046, 2452) (Figure S2; Table 1).
Applying FLIPS, we obtained a total of 531 sequences from the
six participants. HIV-1 can also exist in the form of 2-LTR circles
within infected cells, albeit at very low levels. However, no
2-LTR circles were identified within total CD4+ T cells from four
of the participants with cells available for 2-LTR quantification
(Table S1), indicating that the sequences we obtained were
most likely derived from proviral DNA (Vandergeeten et al.,
2014). Of the 531 sequences, 26 (5%) were characterized as
genetically intact and potentially replication competent (Fig-
ure 1C). The total frequency of intact proviruses ranged from
1.3% to 10.3% in the individual participants (Figure 1D). Defective
proviruses were identified following our stringent process of elim-
ination (Figure 1B): 6% of proviruses were rendered defective due
to aninversionsequence,68%dueto alargeinternaldeletion, 9%
by thepresenceof deleterious stop codons, and 1% by frameshift
mutations. We identified 11% of proviruses that were intact in the
coding region but contained deletions in the packaging signal
and/or mutations in the MSD site, rendering them defective (Bru-
ner et al., 2016; Ho et al., 2013) (Figure 1C). The proportion of
intact proviruses in participants who initiated therapy during
acute/early infection (6%) and chronic infection (3%) was similar
to those obtained by Bruner et al. (2016) (acute 7% and chronic
2%). Additionally, the proportions of the different defective provi-
ruses were similar across the two studies (Table S2).
Genetically Intact Proviruses Are Unequally Distributed
in CD4+ T Cell Subsets
The FLIPS assay was used to assess the frequency of genetically
intact HIV-1 genomes within different CD4+ T cell subsets in a
two-step process that, first, measures the number of cells posi-
tive for HIV-1 and, second, measures the proportion of these
positive cells that have genetically intact HIV-1 genomes.
We found strong evidence for a difference in the number of

 HIV-1-positive cells across the cell subsets (p = 0.003,
c2 = 13.70, df = 3; Figure S1A). We observed TN to contain the
least HIV-1-positive cells, followed by TCM, TEM, and, finally,
TTM. We also found strong evidence that the proportion of intact
proviruses was different across the cell subsets (p < 0.001,
c2 = 20.02, df = 3; Figure S1B). We observed the order from
lowest to highest intact proportion to be TCM < TTM < TN < TEM.
As the frequency of intact HIV-1 proviruses is a product of the
proportion of cells that are HIV-1 positive, and the proportion
that are intact, these results provide strong evidence that the
frequency of intact HIV-1 proviruses differed across the cell sub-
sets. We observed the order of this frequency from lowest to
highest to be TCM < TN < TTM < TEM (Figure 2A). In all participants,
TEM contained the highest number of intact proviruses (range =
1–26; median, 13 per 106 cells). We did not identify any intact
proviruses in the TCM subset in any of the six participants,
despite obtaining 125 sequences from seven million cells
(Table 2); however, we calculated the upper bound of the confi-
dence interval for TCM to be 12 intact proviruses in 106 cells (Fig-
ure 2A). Moreover, the proportion of each cell subset to the total
pool of CD4+ T cells can differ between individuals (Figure 2B)
(Josefsson et al., 2013b). When the contribution of each cell
type to the overall reservoir was calculated for four participants,
we found that the highest number of intact HIV-1 genomes was
located in TEM cells (range = 68%–100% of contribution; median,
76%; Figure 2C).
Detection of Identical Intact HIV-1 Proviruses in
Participants on Long-Term ART
The stability and longevity of the HIV-1 reservoir are thought to
be maintained via the proliferation of cells containing HIV-1
proviruses (Maldarelli et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2014; Cohn
et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017), with antigen-driven and/or homeo-
static proliferation of CD4+ T cells containing an integrated HIV-1
provirus the likely mechanism (von Stockenstrom et al., 2015;
Chomont et al., 2009). Phylogenetic trees of proviral contigs
were prepared for each participant (Figure 3; Data S1). Geneti-
cally identical proviruses are indicative of cellular proliferation,
as the error rate of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase limits the tran-
scription of identical proviruses by de novo replication. In all
participants, we observed evidence of proliferation via the pres-
ence of identical (R2) proviral sequences. The majority (92%) of
identical HIV-1 sequence expansions included defective provi-
ruses. Interestingly, in participant 2026, 32% of sequences
were derived from an identical HIV-1 sequence expansion
located in TEM/TTM cells, which was intact in all coding regions
but had a deletion in the packaging loop and MSD site, rendering
it defective and, likely, replication incompetent (Ho et al., 2013)
(Figure 3). In three participants (SCOPE cohort participants
2026, 2046, and 2275; Figure 3, Data S1A, and Data S1C,
respectively), we observed expansions of genetically identical
intact proviruses in both TTM and TEM cells. The detection of
identical intact proviruses supports previous findings (Simonetti
et al., 2016; Lorenzi et al., 2016; Bui et al., 2017) and provides
further evidence that the pool of latent replication-competent
proviruses is maintained, at least in part, by cellular proliferation
of memory CD4+ T cells.
FLIPS Provides Advantages over Existing Assays that
Genetically Characterize the Latent Reservoir
We compared the number of intact proviruses identified using
FLIPS to integrated DNA measurements that were available for
four participants and were obtained by the method described
previously (Vandergeeten et al., 2014). As expected, we found
no evidence of a correlation between the number of intact
HIV-1 genomes and the number of integrated proviruses per
million cells (p = 0.86). We did, however, find evidence that the
number of intact HIV-1 proviruses per million cells measured
with the FLIPS assay is lower than the frequency of cells
harboring integrated HIV-1 DNA (p < 0.01; Figure 4A).
To determine whether SPS of sub-genomic regions and the
FLIPS assay identified equivalent numbers of intact HIV-1 ge-
nomes, we compared the number of intact proviruses identified
in each cell subset using the FLIPS assay to those that might
have been identified if we had used SPS. To ensure that we
were working with the same population of cells as the FLIPS
assay, we simulated the SPS of env (V1–V3; HXB2 positions
6430–7374) and gag-pol (p6 through nt 1–900 of the gene encod-
ing reverse transcriptase; HXB2 positions 1827–3528) (von
Stockenstrom et al., 2015) rather than conducting the SPS assay
on a different population of cells from each participant. We chose
the env and gag-pol regions, as these gene regions have been

 analyzed in a number of studies (Barton et al., 2016; Josefsson
et al., 2011, 2012, 2013a, 2013b; von Stockenstrom et al.,
2015). From our full-length contigs, we identified env and/or
gag-pol sequences with complete sequencing primer sites
(primers E20, E30, E115, and E125 [env]; and primers 1849,
3500, 1870, and 3410 [gag-pol]) (Josefsson et al., 2013b; von
Stockenstrom et al., 2015). This method of simulation may
have
overestimated
the
number
of
env
and/or
gag-pol
sequences obtained, as it did not take into account primer mis-
matches that may have affected PCR amplification prior to
sequencing (Kearney et al., 2008). Nonetheless, we identified
intact and defective proviruses from our populations of env
and gag-pol sequences using the same stringent screening
method as the FLIPS assay. When comparing the number of
intact proviruses identified using FLIPS to the number of those
identified using SPS for env and gag-pol, we found that the num-
ber of intact proviruses identified by simulated SPS for these
sub-genomic regions increased, on average, over patients and
cell subsets by a factor of 13.2, t(14) = 10.9, p < 0.001; and a fac-
tor of 17.7, t(13) = 10.7, p < 0.001, respectively (Figure 4B). We
identified a number of sequences derived from TCM that were
intact in the env and gag-pol regions but were defective when
we examined the entire proviral genome using FLIPS. Addition-
ally, as the regions chosen for SPS did not cover the packaging
signal and MSD site in the 50 non-coding region, we were unable
to identify sequences that were defective due to deletions or
mutations in this region.
DISCUSSION
We have developed a high-throughput and efficient method for
genetically characterizing latent proviruses that overcomes the
limitations of previous full-length sequencing assays and SPS.
Our NGS-based FLIPS approach is able to sequence �9 kb of
the proviral genome without the use of multiple internal Sanger
sequencing primers, some of which may not match all
viruses within the population. Therefore, unlike the full-length
sequencing assays, which use a Sanger approach (Ho et al.,
2013; Bruner et al., 2016), FLIPS does not carry the risk of erro-
neously identifying deletions within variant virus sequences that
do not match internal sequencing primers. By eliminating the
need to use multiple internal sequencing primers, FLIPS is also
able to resolve the entire sequence of an intact or defective
provirus, a feat that is technically challenging and has not always
been achieved using a Sanger-based approach (Bruner et al.,
2016; Ho et al., 2013). It is important to note that, although FLIPS
uses primers targeted to highly conserved regions of the HIV-1
LTR, it too may be affected by primer mismatches in this region.
Clearly, FLIPS has simplified the method for obtaining full-length
HIV-1 proviral sequences and improved the quality of the se-
quences obtained, and this may explain the larger number of
sequences obtained per participant in this study (average, 88 se-
quences per participant; range = 50–144) compared to previous
studies that used the Sanger approach (average, 27 sequences
per participant [Ho et al., 2013]; and average, 16 sequences per
participant [Bruner et al., 2016]). It is important to note that the
proportion of intact proviruses and the different types of defec-
tive proviruses obtained in this study were similar to those ob-
tained by Bruner et al. (2016), indicating the reproducibility of
obtaining the genetic sequence of HIV-1 proviruses from partic-
ipants on long-term ART. Recent studies also utilized NGS for
sequencing near-full-length HIV-1 proviruses (Lee et al., 2017;
Imamichi et al., 2016); however, the advantages of this approach
over SPS and existing Sanger-based assays were not presented
or discussed.
FLIPS overcomes the limitations of SPS by sequencing near
full-length proviral sequences as opposed to sub-genomic
regions. We have shown that the number of proviruses identified
by SPS as intact in sub-genomic regions is 13- to 18-fold higher
than the number identified by FLIPS. Therefore, FLIPS provides a
more robust estimate of the number of intact proviruses in a cell
population by providing a genome-scale perspective of defec-
tive changes. Additionally, nucleotide homology between full-
length proviral sequences provides a better prediction of expan-
sions of identical intact sequences than the sequencing of
sub-genomic regions.
The FLIPS assay provides a stringent approach to predicting
the replication competency of HIV-1 proviruses without requiring
these proviruses to be reactivated and spread in vitro or in vivo.
The majority of proviruses were characterized as defective due
to the presence of large internal deletions or deleterious stop
codons in multiple coding regions. However, a number of provi-
ruses were defined as defective due to a unique deletion in the
packaging signal and MSD site. We believe that in vitro studies
similar to those performed by Ho et al. (2013) are required to
determine the true replication competency of some sequenced
proviruses. Additionally, as we did not determine the integration
sites of the sequenced proviruses, it is possible that some

 proviruses defined as genetically intact may be replication
incompetent due to integration into a centromere (Lewinski
et al., 2005).
Genetic characterization of HIV-1 proviruses provides infor-
mation about the stability, distribution, and dynamics of the
latent reservoir. Using FLIPS, we identified a number of identical
intact proviruses, which would not have been possible using
traditional SPS methods. The detection of identical intact provi-

ruses suggests a role for cellular prolifer-
ation in the maintenance and stability of
the latent replication-competent reser-
voir. Unlike Hosmane et al. (2017), Bui
et al. (2017) and Lorenzi et al. (2016),
who used the definitive viral outgrowth
assay to identify identical replication-
competent
proviruses
in
participants
on ART, we did not use in vitro studies
to confirm the replication competency
of intact proviruses identified by FLIPS.
Therefore, we cannot be certain that
the identical intact proviruses we identi-
fied
are
truly
replication
competent.
Additionally, as integration site analysis
of identical proviruses was not per-
formed on these participants, we cannot
exclude focal infection prior to ART initia-
tion as the source of these identical
proviruses. However, the presence of
identical defective proviruses in every
participant suggests that proliferation of
resting memory CD4+ T cells is a com-
mon occurrence in participants on long-
term ART.
Using the FLIPS assay, we observed
the
distribution
of
genetically
intact
HIV-1 proviruses among naive and mem-
ory CD4+ T cell populations. The number
of
intact
proviruses
was
statistically
different across the cell subsets, and we
observed TEM to have the highest number
of intact proviruses. We did not directly
sequence any intact proviruses from the
TCM subset; however, using a binomial
test, we calculated a conservative esti-
mate of the number of intact proviruses
in TCM to be, at most, 12 per 106 cells.
The presence of intact HIV-1 proviruses
in TCM is supported by previous studies
that have identified TCM as a reservoir of replication-competent
HIV-1 (Soriano-Sarabia et al., 2014; Chomont et al., 2009). Addi-
tionally, as TCM cells differentiate into TEM cells after T cell recep-
tor activation and in response to homeostatic cytokines (Sallusto
et al., 1999, 2004; Geginat et al., 2003), this may explain why TEM
harbors more intact proviruses than TCM. Although we observed
no intact provirus in the TCM subset, intact virus may exist at a
lower level than the sensitivity of this sample size; therefore,
818

 sequencing of HIV-1 from a larger number of TCM cells may be
required to detect intact proviruses.
Future studies into HIV-1 latency and eradication will benefit
from utilization of the FLIPS assay. For example, further genetic
characterization of latent proviruses could be crucial to deter-
mining particular coding or non-coding regions that make the
virus more responsive to latency reversing agents (LRAs). Simi-
larly, sequencing of the virus before and after administration of
ART could elucidate whether there are any sequence character-
istics that could make the virus more likely to become latent.
FLIPS could assist in the identification of sites targeted by
CRISPR-Cas technology. Lastly, by adapting the FLIPS assay
to sequence plasma HIV-1 RNA, the particular subsets that
contribute to viral rebound after administration of a LRA or ART
interruption could be identified.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participant Cohort
Leukapheresis or peripheral blood samples were obtained from six HIV-1
subtype-B-positive individuals on long-term suppressive ART (3.2–17.7
years). Participant characteristics, including age and sex are available in Table
1. Participants 2026, 2046, and 2452 initiated therapy during chronic infection,
and participants 2115, 2302, and 2275 initiated therapy during acute/early
infection. Participants were enrolled in the SCOPE (participants 2026, 2046,
2115, and 2275) or OPTIONS (participants 2452 and 2302) cohorts that are
both ongoing longitudinal observational cohorts based at the University of
California, San Francisco. Viral loads were monitored every 4 months, and
all participants maintained viral suppression (<40–75 copies per milliliter) for
at least 3 years prior to this study.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was
approved by the institutional review boards at the University of California, San
Francisco, and the Western Sydney Local Health District, which includes the
Westmead Institute for Medical Research.
Isolation of CD4+ T Cell Subsets
Naive and memory CD4+ T cell subsets were isolated by fluorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting. For the OPTIONS cohort participants (2452 and 2302),
cell subsets were isolated from peripheral blood as previously described
(von Stockenstrom et al., 2015). For the SCOPE cohort participants
(2026, 2046, 2115, and 2275), cell subsets were isolated from leukapheresis
samples, as described later. Both methods sorted memory CD4+ T cell
subsets on expression of CD45RO followed by CD27+/CCR7+ (TCM),
CD27�/CCR7� (TEM), and CD27+/CCR7� (TTM) to obtain the relevant mem-
ory subpopulations.
For the SCOPE cohort participants, naive and memory CD4+ T cell subsets
were isolated as follows (Figure S2). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were obtained from leukapheresis samples by Ficoll-Hypaque
density gradient centrifugation followed by isolation of total CD4+ T cells by
magnetic negative selection, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were initially sorted using the following anti-
bodies: CD3-Alexa Fluor 700 (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences #557943),
CD4-APC (clone RPA-T4, BD Biosciences #555349), CD14-V500 (clone
M5E2, BD Biosciences #561391), LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain
marker (Invitrogen #L34957), CD45RA-BV650 (clone HI100, BioLegend
#304135), and CD45RO-PerCP-eFluor 710 (clone UCHL1, eBioscience
#40-0457-42). CD45RO+/CD45RA� cells were classified as memory cells
and further sorted into TCM, TTM, and TEM subsets based on their expression
of CD27 and CCR7 using the antibodies CD27-APCeFluor780 (clone
O323, eBioscience #47-0279-42) and CCR7-PECF564 (clone 150503, BD
Biosciences #562381), with a purity for each T cell subset of 95%–100%,
67%–92%, and 85%–98%, respectively. CD45RO�/CD45RA+ cells were
further sorted into TN based on the expression of CD27, CCR7, CD127, and
CD95 using the additional antibodies CD127-PE (clone HIL-7R-M21, BD
Biosciences #557938) and CD95-PE-Cy7 (clone DX2, BD Biosciences
#561633), with a purity of 100%.
The number of cells obtained ranged from 5 3 104 to 12 3 106 for both sort-
ing strategies. Cell pellets were stored at �80�C. Cells were lysed in 100 mL
lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [Invitrogen], 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Tween-20
[Sigma], and 0.3 mg/mL proteinase K [Ambion]) per 106 cells by incubating at
55�C for 1 hr followed by incubation at 85�C for 15 min to obtain genomic DNA
for PCR amplification.
2-LTR Circles and Integrated DNA Quantification
2-LTR circles from total CD4+ T cells and integrated DNA from naive and mem-
ory T cell subsets were quantified as previously described (Vandergeeten
et al., 2014).
FLIPS Assay
Nested PCR
To amplify single full-length HIV-1 proviruses, lysed CD4+ T cells were serially
diluted 1:3, 1:9, 1:27, and 1:81, and 20 reactions at each dilution were per-
formed with two rounds of nested PCR using primers specific to the HIV-1
50 and 30 U5 LTR regions. This PCR amplification has been modified from pre-
viously reported assays (Bruner et al., 2016; Ho et al., 2013; Li et al., 2007).
Briefly, for the first round PCR, 2 mL diluted DNA was amplified in a 40-mL
reaction containing 1 mM primers (BLOuter forward [BLOuterF]: 50-AAATCTC
TAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG-30, HXB2 position 623–649; and BLOuter
reverse [BLOuterR]: 50-TGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAGTC-30, HXB2 posi-
tion 9662–9686), 13 High Fidelity Buffer (600 mM Tris-SO4 [pH 8.9], 180 mM
(NH4)2SO4; Invitrogen), 2 mM MgSO4 (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM dNTPs (Promega),
and 0.025 U/mL Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Each PCR plate con-
tained 85 PCR reactions: 80 sample reactions, 4 negative control reactions,
and a positive control reaction containing pWT/BaL (obtained through the
AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: HIV-1 HXB3/BaL Infec-
tious Molecular Clone (pWT/BaL), catalogue number 11414, from Dr. Bryan R.
Cullen). PCR conditions for the first round were 94�C for 2 min, then 94�C for
30 s, 64�C for 30 s, and 68�C for 10 min for 3 cycles; 94�C for 30 s, 61�C for 30
s, and 68�C for 10 min for 3 cycles; 94�C for 30 s, 58�C for 30 s, and 68�C for
10 min for 3 cycles; 94�C for 30 s, 55�C for 30 s, and 68�C for 10 min for 21
cycles; and then 68�C for 10 min. The first-round PCR reaction was diluted
1:3 in Tris-HCl (5 mM, pH 8), and 2 mL of the diluted reaction was transferred
to the 30-mL second-round reaction (primers 275 forward [275F]: 50-ACA
GGGACCTGAAAGCGAAAG-30, HXB2 positions 646–666; and 280 reverse
[280R]:

positions
9650–9676). Second-round PCR conditions were identical to the first round,
except that an additional 10 cycles at 94�C for 30 s, 55�C for 30 s, and 68�C
for 10 min were added. Wells positive for amplified HIV-1 proviruses were iden-
tified by diluting the second-round PCR reaction 1:3 with Tris-HCl (5 mM,
pH 8), followed by visualization on a 1% agarose gel. According to the Poisson
distribution, the dilution at which 30% of PCR reactions are positive has an

 80% probability of containing a single amplified provirus. Therefore, the dilu-
tion where approximately 30% of the amplicons were positive was selected,
and additional PCRs were completed until 30–40 single proviruses were ampli-
fied per T cell subset where possible.
DNA Purification and Quantification
Proviral DNA from each single amplified HIV-1 provirus was purified using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions with minor modifications. These modifications included heating
the elution buffer (Buffer EB) to 60�C and incubating the buffer on the column
for 3 min prior to the final spin. Each HIV-1 provirus was then quantified using
the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and diluted in water to a
final DNA concentration of 0.2 ng/mL as input for Nextera XT library preparation.
Nextera XT Library Preparation
Amplified proviruses were prepared for NGS using the Nextera XT DNA
Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) with indexing of 96 samples per run. All tag-
mentation, PCR amplification, and clean-up steps were performed accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that reagent and input DNA
volumes were halved, and libraries were normalized manually. To do this,
the concentration of each individual provirus Nextera XT library was deter-
mined using the KAPA Illumina Universal NGS qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems)
and then combined in equimolar amounts to a concentration of 4 nM. The
final pooled 96-sample library was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) with the average fragment lengths determined
by bioanalyzer (Agilent). The pooled library was denatured by combining
equal volumes (5 mL each) with 0.2 N NaOH before neutralization with
5 mL of 200 mM Tris-HCl. The final library was then diluted to 12.5 pM
with chilled Hybridization Buffer (HT1) immediately prior to sequencing.
Pooled libraries underwent 2 3 150 nt paired-end sequencing on the Illu-
mina MiSeq platform (300-cycle kit v2), which was performed by the
Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (University of New South Wales, Sydney,
Australia). This yielded approximately 20 million paired-end reads per run
or 200,000 reads per individual provirus library for analysis following de-
multiplexing.
De Novo Assembly of Unique Proviruses
Following amplification and sequencing, we assembled, de novo, individual
proviruses from the paired-end reads using a custom designed workflow in
CLC Genomics Workbench 9 (QIAGEN) (Figure S3). This workflow involved
the following specific steps. (1) Quality control: removal of Illumina adaptor se-
quences and ambiguous nucleotides, trimming of 50 and 30 terminal nucleo-
tides, and a stringent quality limit of 0.001 that corresponds to a quality control
phred score of 30. (2) Merge overlapping pairs: paired forward and reverse
reads with overlapping regions were merged to form single extended reads.
(3) De novo assembly: 10,000 non-overlapping paired reads were subsampled
to obtain an expected coverage of �2003 and were then de novo assembled
using the native CLC Genomics assembler with a word size of 30 nt and a
maximum bubble size of 65 nt. (4) Map reads to de novo assembled contig:
the full read set was then re-mapped to the de novo assembled contig before
extraction of a final majority consensus sequence. The final de novo assem-
bled contig length was compared to the size of the corresponding band on
the original gel. The minimum acceptable average coverage was 1,000 reads.
The final consensus underwent further quality control measures before being
confirmed as a unique HIV-1 proviral sequence as described later.
The majority of the proviral contigs were assembled with the aforementioned
workflow. In some circumstances, multiple contigs with a similar coverage
were assembled. These contigs were then aligned to a full-length HIV-1
(9-kb) reference from the same participant using the Align Contigs tool in the
CLC Genome Finishing Module, which allowed for manual assembly of a final
single consensus. As before, all reads were re-mapped to this single
consensus and then accepted as a final HIV-1 proviral sequence if the read
coverage was even throughout the assembly and absent of SNPs with a fre-
quency of >40%.
Further Quality Control Measures
(1) BLAST search: non-HIV contigs from non-specific amplification were
identified through a BLAST search. The amount of non-HIV sequences iden-
tified ranged from 1% to 14% in the participants and they were mainly
evident when the infection frequency of a cell subset was low. These contigs
were not included in further analyses. (2) Identification of mixtures: to further
ensure that each contig represented a single provirus, we screened all con-
tigs and identified those assembled from multiple amplified HIV-1 proviral
templates (mixtures) on the basis of read coverage and variant calling.
Reads were mapped to a full-length HIV-1 (�9 kb) reference from the
same participant. Mixtures were subsequently identified by uneven read
coverage (e.g., when proviral contigs of different lengths were co-amplified)
or by the presence of SNPs with a frequency of >40%. The percentage of
amplified proviruses that were identified as mixtures ranged from 3% to
15% per participant. Mixed populations were not included in subsequent
analyses.
Assembled proviral contigs were imported into Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 6 and aligned to the HIV-1 reference genome
HXB2 using MAFFT v7 and manual editing where appropriate. To identify
cases of inter-participant or positive control pWT/BaL contamination, an align-
ment and neighbor-joining tree were prepared containing all participants and
the pWT/BaL sequence (MEGA 6). No contamination was observed, as each
participant’s sequences formed a unique monophyletic group distinct from
the control sequence.
Identification of Intact Proviruses
To identify genetically intact proviruses, we developed a workflow that iden-
tifies HIV-1 proviral contigs with inversions, large internal deletions, deleterious
stop codons and hypermutation, frameshift mutations, and defects in the
packaging signal/MSD (Figure 1B).
Inversions
Inversions, which are regions of reverse complementarity, were identified
manually in the alignment stage since they included regions that did not align
to the reference sequence HXB2 but, following reverse complementation,
were able to be aligned. All contigs containing inversions were subsequently
omitted from the final alignment of full-length sequences for each T cell subset,
as homologous alignments could not be prepared from these sequences in
any orientation.
Large Internal Deletions
Contigs containing large internal deletions (>100 nt) were identified at the
alignment stage and defined as defective.
Deleterious Stop Codons and Hypermutation
Allcontigsofa lengthof>8,900ntwere assumedtobenearlyfulllengthandwere
checked for the presence of deleterious stop codons and hypermutation. Dele-
terious stop codons were identified using the Gene Cutter tool (Los Alamos HIV
Database), which divides the contigs into the open reading frames (gag to nef)
and translates them to amino acids. Any contigs containing a stop codon in
any gene, excluding nef (Foster and Garcia, 2007), were defined as defective.
Additionally, contigs containing nucleotide deletions or insertions causing
frameshift mutations were identified as defective. APOBEC-induced G-A hyper-
mutation was identified in the remaining full-length proviruses using the Los Ala-
mos HIV Database Hypermut tool (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov) and a consensus of
the corresponding participant’s full-length provirus as a reference.
Defects in cis-Acting Elements
We defined contigs with defects in the cis-acting elements of the non-coding
50 LTR, including the packaging signal and MSD site, as defective. These sites
are essential to HIV-1 replication, as proviruses with a deletion in the four stem
loops (SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4) of the packaging signal or a point mutation in
the MSD (sequence GT) have previously been identified as replication incom-
petent (Ho et al., 2013).
Construction of Phylogenetic Trees
Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were estimated for each participant us-
ing MEGA6. The best fit model of nucleotide substitution was determined for
eachtree using theMEGA6model finder tool.Models used inthisstudy included
the generalized time-reversible model, as well as Tamura and Nei, incorporating
gamma-distributed (gamma category 4) and/or invariant sites where appro-
priate. Our heuristic tree search strategy used the nearest neighbor inter-
changes branch-swapping algorithm. Branch support was inferred using
1,000 bootstrap replicates. Annotated tree images were constructed using
the ggtree tool (Yu et al., 2016) and including bootstrap values >75.

 Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed in R: A Language and Environment for Sta-
tistical Computing, v.3.3.2 (https://www.R-project.org). As per the Poisson
distribution, the average number of HIV-1-positive cells per PCR plate was
estimated as npcr = w logðpÞ, where w is the total number of wells per plate,
and p is the estimated true proportion of negative wells (number of negative
wells adjusted for sequenced positive wells that were not HIV-1, a mixture,
or were unable to be assembled). The proportion of cells positive for HIV-1
was then calculated as npcr=nt, where nt is the estimated number of cells
used per plate. This proportion is used to estimate the frequency of HIV-1-pos-
itive cells per 106 cells. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the
estimated frequency of HIV-1-positive cells per 106 cells across memory sub-
sets and adjust for potential correlation of multiple observations within each
patient (library nlme, function lme). The fixed effect of memory subset was as-
sessed with a likelihood-ratio test on maximum likelihoods. The frequency of
HIV-1-positive cells was log transformed to ensure normality of residuals,
and the power variance function varPower() was used to ensure heteroscedas-
ticity. A linear fixed-effect model with a fixed effect for each subject was also
analyzed and provided similar conclusions (function lme).
The proportion of sequenced HIV-1 proviruses that were intact was calcu-
lated with a mixed logistic model to account for potential correlation of multiple
observations within each patient (library lme4, function glmer). A likelihood-ra-
tio test was used to assess the fixed effect of memory subset. A fixed-effect
logistic regression with a fixed effect for each subject was also analyzed and
provided similar conclusions (function glm). To calculate the frequency of
intact HIV-1 cells per 106 cells, the proportion of HIV-1-positive cells per
106 cells was multiplied by the proportion of HIV-1 intact genomes. The com-
parison of the FLIPS estimate of intact virus to the SPS estimate was analyzed
using a paired t test on the logarithm of the ratio of estimates within each
patient and memory subset. The logarithm of the ratio of estimates was
approximately normally distributed.
