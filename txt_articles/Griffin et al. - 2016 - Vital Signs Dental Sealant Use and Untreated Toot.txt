Introduction
National data from 1999–2004 indicate that by age 19 years, 
approximately one in five children have untreated tooth decay 
(1). Children living in poverty are more than twice as likely 
to have untreated decay (27%) than are children in families 
whose income exceeds 200% of the federal poverty level 
(FPL) (13%). Untreated tooth decay can lead to pain and 
infection, resulting in problems with eating, speaking, and 
learning (2). Approximately 16% of children living in poverty 
were reported by a parent to have had a toothache within the 
last 6 months (3). A recent multivariate analysis also found 
that children with poor oral health miss more school days and 
receive lower grades than children with good oral health (4).
Approximately 90% of tooth decay in permanent teeth 
occurs in the chewing surfaces of the back teeth (5). Much of 
this decay could be prevented with the application of dental 
sealants. Sealants are plastic coatings applied to the pits and 
fissures in tooth surfaces to prevent decay-causing bacteria and 
food particles from collecting in these hard-to-clean surfaces. 
Studies on sealant effectiveness indicate that sealants delivered 
in clinical or school settings prevent about 81% of decay at 
two years after placement, 50% at four years and can continue 
to be effective for up to 9 years through adolescence (6); no 
clinically significant adverse effects have been associated with 
receipt of sealants (6). Sealants are underused, especially among 
low-income children who have the highest risk for decay. 
National data from 1999–2004 indicated the prevalence of 
sealant use among children aged 6–11 years living in poverty 
was 21% compared with 40% among children from families 
with incomes >200% of the FPL (1). Increasing sealant use 
prevalence is a national health goal (7) and the National 
Quality Forum* has endorsed dental care performance mea-
sures aimed at increasing sealant use prevalence in children at 
elevated risk for tooth decay (8).
School-based sealant programs (SBSP) typically deliver 
sealants in schools attended by a large number of children par-
ticipating in the free/reduced-price meal program (i.e., family 
Abstract
Background: Tooth decay is one of the greatest unmet treatment needs among children. Pain and suffering associated with 
untreated dental disease can lead to problems with eating, speaking, and learning. School-based dental sealant programs 
(SBSP) deliver a highly effective intervention to prevent tooth decay in children who might not receive regular dental 
care. SBSPs benefits exceed their costs when they target children at high risk for tooth decay.
Methods: CDC used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014 to 
estimate current prevalences of sealant use and untreated tooth decay among low-income (≤185% of federal poverty level) 
and higher-income children aged 6–11 years and compared these estimates with 1999–2004 NHANES data. The mean 
number of decayed and filled first molars (DFFM) was estimated for children with and without sealants. Averted tooth 
decay resulting from increasing sealant use prevalence was also estimated. All reported differences are significant at p<0.05.
Results: From 1999–2004 to 2011–2014, among low- and higher-income children, sealant use prevalence increased by 
16.2 and 8.8 percentage points to 38.7% and 47.8%, respectively. Among low-income children aged 7–11 years, the 
mean DFFM was almost three times higher among children without sealants (0.82) than among children with sealants. 
Approximately 6.5 million low-income children could potentially benefit from the delivery of sealants through SBSP
.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: The prevalence of dental sealant use has increased; however, 
most children have not received sealants. Increasing sealant use prevalence could substantially reduce untreated decay, 
associated problems, and dental treatment costs.

income ≤185% of the FPL) (6). The Community Preventive 
Services Task Force† (Task Force) recommends SBSP
, on the 
basis of strong evidence that these programs prevent tooth 
decay and increase the number of children receiving sealants 
at schools (6). A second, systematic review of economic evalu-
ations of SBSP conducted for the Task Force found that the 
benefits of SBSP exceed their cost when they serve children at 
high risk for tooth decay, becoming cost-saving after 2 years 
(6) and saving $11.70 per tooth sealed over 4 years (9).
In this report, CDC estimated prevalence of sealant use and 
untreated tooth decay among low-income (≤185% of FPL, the 
qualification point for free/reduced-price meal program) and 
higher-income children aged 6–11 years using data from the 
recently released 2011–2014 NHANES and compared these 
data with data from the 1999–2004 NHANES. Estimates of 
tooth decay averted by providing sealants to children were 
also calculated.
Methods
To estimate current prevalences of sealant use and untreated 
decay for U.S. children aged 6–11 years, CDC combined the 
two most recent cycles of NHANES data (2011–2012 and 
2013–2014). NHANES is a multistage probability sample of 
the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.§ A child was clas-
sified as having sealants if at least one permanent tooth was 
assessed by a dentist to have a sealant present and as having 
untreated tooth decay if at least one permanent tooth had 
untreated decay.
Sealant use prevalence is presented for all children aged 
6–11 years as well as for the following characteristics: sex; 
race/ethnicity; family income ≤185% of FPL versus >185% 
of FPL; and highest level of education achieved by the head of 
household. Sealant use and untreated decay prevalence strati-
fied by family income from NHANES 2011–2014 were com-
pared with prevalences from NHANES 1999–2004. Sealant 
use and untreated decay status were assessed in the same way 
for both periods (1). Among children aged 7–11 years,¶ the 
mean number of decayed and filled first molars (DFFM) was 
estimated for children with and without sealants, by family 
income status. For each income group, CDC used a published 
methodology to estimate the number of DFFM that would 
have occurred over 4 years if a child had not received sealants 
soon after eruption of the first molars (10). This value was 
multiplied by the prevented fraction (50%) (6) to estimate 
averted DFFM per child attributable to sealants over 4 years. 
Estimates were standardized by year of age to the distribution 
in the 2000 U.S. Census (1).
Analyses were conducted using statistical software that 
accounts for the complex sample design of NHANES. 
Estimates from NHANES were obtained using the examina-
tion sample weights. All statistical tests were conducted at a 
95% significance level (p<0.05). Estimates with relative stan-
dard errors >0.3 were classified as unstable. To test whether 
sealant use prevalence varied with the characteristic of the 
child during 2011–2014, CDC used a chi-square test of inde-
pendence. A t-test was used to determine whether changes in 
sealant use and decay prevalences between surveys or mean 
DFFM by sealant status and income were significant.

Key Points
• Tooth decay is one of the most common chronic 
diseases of childhood. If left untreated, tooth decay can 
have serious consequences including problems with 
eating, speaking, and learning.
• Two years after placement, dental sealants prevent 
>80% of cavities in the permanent molars, in which 
nine in 10 cavities occur. Most children, however, do 
not have dental sealants, especially children from low-
income families. These children are twice as likely as 
higher-income children to have untreated tooth decay.
• Providing sealants through school-based programs is 
an effective way to increase sealant use. The benefits of 
school-based dental sealant programs exceed their cost 
when they serve children at high risk for tooth decay. 
The programs become cost-saving after 2 years and save 
$11.70 per sealed tooth over 4 years. 
• In this study, approximately 60% of children aged 
6–11 years from low-income families (approximately 
6.5 million children), did not have dental sealants. 
Although sealant prevalence during the last decade 
increased by 72% among low-income children, these 
children were still 20% less likely than children from 
higher-income families to have dental sealants. 
Children without sealants had almost three times more 
cavities in permanent first molars compared with 
children with sealants.
• Providing sealants to the approximately 6.5 million 
low-income children who currently do not have them 
would prevent 3.4 million cavities over 4 years.

gov/vitalsigns.

Results
Approximately 43% of children aged 6–11 years received at 
least one dental sealant (Table 1), and sealant use prevalence 
among low-income children (38.7%) was approximately 
9.1 percentage points lower than among higher-income 
children (47.8%). Sealant use prevalence was highest among 
non-Hispanic white children (46.0%) and children from 
households where the head of household had more than a high 
school education (45.2%) and lowest among non-Hispanic 
black children (32.2%) and children from households where 
the head of household had a high school education (37.7%).
From 1999–2004 to 2011–2014, overall prevalence of dental 
sealant use increased from 31.1%–43.6% (Table 2); increased 
by 16.2 percentage points to 38.7% (relative increase of 72.0%) 
among low-income children; and increased by 8.8 percentage 
points (relative increase of 22.6%) among higher-income 
children. Untreated decay decreased by 4.9 percentage points 
to 7.5% among low-income children and remained at about 
4% among higher-income children.
Among children aged 7–11 years, the mean DFFM was 
significantly lower for both higher-income and low-income 
children with at least one sealant (0.19 and 0.29, respectively) 
compared with children with no sealants (0.52 and 0.82, 
respectively) (Table 3). The difference in mean DFFM between 
children with and without sealants was 0.33 and 0.52 for 
higher- and low-income children, respectively.
The estimated average annual probability of a permanent 
first molar developing decay, calculated with DFFM data by 
year of age for children aged 7–11 years, was 0.07 for low-
income children (data not shown). Because of unstable esti-
mates, this probability was not estimated for higher-income 
children. Over 4 years, sealing all four permanent first molars 
of low-income children is estimated to prevent 0.52 DFFM 
per child (Table 4). The NHANES 2011–2014 dataset had 
sealant and income information for 1,371 low-income children 
aged 6–11 years, representing 10.5 million children nationally. 
Based on the proportion of low-income children without seal-
ants in the NHANES dataset, it is estimated that approximately 
6.5 million low-income children currently are not receiving 
the preventive benefits of dental sealants. Providing sealants to 
these low-income children would prevent 3.4 million DFFM 
over 4 years.
Conclusions and Comments
Increasing sealant use prevalence among low-income children 
could substantially reduce tooth decay. Because the benefits 
of sealants can last up to 9 years, and untreated decay preva-
lence is about twice as high for adolescents and young adults 
aged 12–19 years compared with younger children, it is likely 
that much of the pain and limitations in eating and learning 
associated with untreated decay could be prevented by timely 
application of sealants. In addition, providing sealants to these 
children could save societal resources. The systematic review of 
economic evaluations of SBSP conducted for the Task Force 
found that SBSP became cost-saving within 2 years of placing 
sealants (6). That review further found that delivering sealants 
to children at high risk for tooth decay could be cost-saving 
to Medicaid (9).
Data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
indicate that less than half of children aged 6–11 years from 
families with incomes <125% of the FPL had a past-year 
dental visit in 2013 (11). Sealants must be placed by a licensed 
dental professional with dental equipment; therefore, the lack 
of timely dental visits among low-income children might be 
an important reason that 60% lack sealants. Applying sealants 
in schools is an effective strategy to increase the prevalence of 
sealant application among children not accessing regular dental 
care, but few schools offer these programs. One survey of state 
oral health programs found that few states have SBSP in the 
majority of their high-need schools (i.e., >50% of students 
participating in free/reduced meal program) (12). Financing is 
a major barrier to implementing and maintaining SBSP (13). 
Federal funding of state oral health programs is largely com-
petitive and varies widely by state (13). Many state and local 
SBSP cover part of their expenses by Medicaid billing (13). 
Because labor accounts for about two thirds of SBSP costs (6),

revenues from Medicaid billing are more likely to cover costs 
if state policies allow dental hygienists or therapists to assess a 
child’s need for and to place sealants without a dentist being 
present. For example, in South Carolina, SBSPs managed and 
staffed by dental hygienists deliver sealants in approximately 
40% of high-need schools (12). These SBSP are primarily 
financed by Medicaid billing (13).
Another barrier to children receiving sealants in clinical and 
school settings is low health literacy. A study of California third 
graders found that their parent’s health literacy and speaking 
English at home were strong predictors of the child having seal-
ants (14). An Institute of Medicine report on increasing access 
to dental care among vulnerable and underserved populations 
also found that low oral health literacy was a major barrier to 
receiving preventive dental services (15).
The findings in this report are subject to at least one limita-
tion. Because NHANES is not designed to provide estimates 
by year of age, a large number of estimates of DFFM by year 
of age and sealant status were unstable. However, among 
low-income children, all estimates of DFFM used to estimate 
the annual probability that an unsealed first molar developed 
decay were stable.
Children with sealants can still be at risk for tooth decay. 
Whereas fluoride can prevent decay in all teeth, sealants are primar-
ily used to protect the back teeth from decay. Healthy behaviors 
documented to prevent decay include brushing with fluoride 
toothpaste and drinking fluoridated water or taking fluoride sup-
plements if drinking water is not optimally fluoridated (2). Many 
of the studies included in the evidence informing the Task Force’s 
recommendation for SBSP were conducted among children using 
fluoride toothpaste in communities with fluoridated water (6), 
suggesting that sealants provide additional benefit even among 
children receiving fluoride. Regularly scheduled dental visits are 
important to deliver preventive services (e.g., topical fluoride) and 
to monitor and control tooth decay and other oral conditions 
(2). SBSP can help caregivers of eligible children enroll in public 
insurance programs (5,6) and can increase utilization of dental 
care by identifying tooth decay in children who are not regularly 
seen by a dentist and referring them for needed dental treatment.
