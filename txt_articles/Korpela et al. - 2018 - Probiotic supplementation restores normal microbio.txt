Abstract
Background: Infants born by caesarean section or receiving antibiotics are at increased risk of developing
metabolic, inflammatory and immunological diseases, potentially due to disruption of normal gut microbiota
at a critical developmental time window. We investigated whether probiotic supplementation could ameliorate the
effects of antibiotic use or caesarean birth on infant microbiota in a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized
clinical trial. Mothers were given a multispecies probiotic, consisting of Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 (Bp99 2 × 108 cfu)
Propionibacterium freundenreichii subsp. shermanii JS (2 × 109cfu), Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705 (5 × 109 cfu) and
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (5 × 109 cfu) (N = 168 breastfed and 31 formula-fed), or placebo supplement (N = 201
breastfed and 22 formula-fed) during pregnancy, and the infants were given the same supplement. Faecal samples of
the infants were collected at 3 months and analyzed using taxonomic, metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches.
Results: The probiotic supplement had a strong overall impact on the microbiota composition, but the effect
depended on the infant’s diet. Only breastfed infants showed the expected increase in bifidobacteria and
reduction in Proteobacteria and Clostridia. In the placebo group, both birth mode and antibiotic use were
significantly associated with altered microbiota composition and function, particularly reduced Bifidobacterium
abundance. In the probiotic group, the effects of antibiotics and birth mode were either completely eliminated or
reduced.
Conclusions: The results indicate that it is possible to correct undesired changes in microbiota composition
and function caused by antibiotic treatments or caesarean birth by supplementing infants with a probiotic
mixture together with at least partial breastfeeding.

 Background
Massive microbial colonization of the human intestine be-
gins at birth and is beginning to be understood as a finely
tuned process [1, 2]. It is likely that infants are adapted to
receiving specific microbial signals at critical time windows
during their early development. The gut microbiota are
emerging as a regulator of epigenetic programming [3] and
critically influence the development of the immune system,
with potentially irreversible effects on disease susceptibility
[4, 5]. Furthermore, the gut microbiota have a central role
in infant nutrition, affecting growth and energy metabolism
[6]. Overall, gut microbiota development in early life likely
contributes significantly to the long-term health of the host.
The natural bacterial colonization and development
process is compromised when the infant is born by caesar-
ean section [7–9], or given antibiotics [10, 11]. The
early-life microbiota-disrupting factors have been found to
be associated with later metabolic and immunological dis-
eases, such as overweight [11–13], allergic disease [14, 15],
type 1 diabetes [16] and inflammatory bowel disease [17,
18]. Mouse studies indicate that the early-life microbiota
disruption plays a causal role in host phenotype develop-
ment [19, 20]. Early exposure to antibiotics and birth by
caesarean section are very common practices, affecting over
50% of infants in some populations [21, 22], making the
issue of early-life microbiota disruption a significant public
health concern.
While caesarean delivery and antibiotic treatment
are medical necessities, it is becoming increasingly
clear that preventing or reducing the disruptive ef-
fects on the microbiota is important for healthy infant
development. However, thus far, there is very little
evidence in support of specific treatment modalities.
Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria hold great promise, as these
bacteria are naturally an important component of the infant
microbiota and have been found to reduce the risk of
antibiotic-associated diarrhoea [1, 23]. A double-blinded
placebo-controlled
study
in
a
cohort
of
over
1000
allergy-risk infants showed that the risk of allergic disease
among caesarean-born infants could be reduced by pre-
and postnatal supplementation of a multispecies probiotic,
including Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 (Bp99 2 × 108 cfu)
Propionibacterium freundenreichii subsp. shermanii JS (2 ×
109 cfu), Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705 (5 × 109 cfu) and
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (5 × 109 cfu) [24]. Here, we
report the multiomics analysis of the intestinal microbiota
in these infants and discover that the supplement effectively
ameliorated most of the effects of caesarean birth and anti-
biotic use on infant microbiota.
Results
Supplement-induced microbiota-wide changes
We first investigated the effect of the intervention on
the intestinal microbiota of vaginally born infants with
no antibiotic treatments. The abundance of the gut-
dwelling species present in the supplement, Bifidobacter-
ium breve and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, were signifi-
cantly increased in the supplemented group, up to over
tenfold in the breast-fed but less in the formula-fed in-
fants (Fig. 1a–b). The dominant species was B. breve in
84% of the breastfed infants and in 35% of the formula-fed
infants in the supplemented group. In the control group,
none of the formula-fed but 12% of the breastfed infants
had B. breve as the dominant species, suggesting that B.
breve is a natural colonizer of breastfed infants. To valid-
ate these findings with a PCR-independent approach, we
also sequenced the whole metagenome of a subset of the
breastfed infants’ faecal samples. This metagenomic ana-
lysis corroborated the phylogenetic approach, and the data
captured also Propionibacterium freundenreichii present
in the supplement (Fig. 1c–e), which was not identified in
the 16S rRNA gene data.
The
supplement
affected the
overall
microbiota
composition (Fig. 1f). Among the vaginally born in-
fants with no antibiotic treatments, the main driver of
inter-individual differences in the species-level intes-
tinal microbiota composition was the treatment group,
explaining 19% of the variation (p = 0.001 in permuta-
tional
multivariate
ANOVA,
Fig.
1f).
This
result
should be interpreted with caution due to the compos-
itional nature of the data (with relative abundances
summing up to 1). When inspecting the bifidobacterial
community, we observed weaker responses to the sup-
plement in the formula-fed compared to the breastfed
infants (Fig. 1g).
Further evidence of a mediating effect of feeding type
came from analysis of specific bacterial taxa (Fig. 2):
most of the supplement-induced changes observed in
the
breast-fed
infants
were
not
present
in
the
formula-fed infants. In the breast-fed group, the abun-
dance of lactobacilli was 100% (twofold) increased and
that of bifidobacteria 29% increased in response to the
supplement (p < 0.0001, generalized least squares model,
GLS, Additional file 1: Table S1). Most other taxa were
reduced in abundance (Fig. 2a, Additional file 1: Table
S1): Clostridia by 66% (p < 0.0001, GLS) and Gamma-
proteobacteria by 58% (p < 0.0001, generalized linear
model, GLM, with negative binomial distribution). In
contrast, in the formula-fed infants, the total abundance
of bifidobacteria was slightly but significantly decreased
in the supplemented group (by 7%, p < 0.0001, GLM,
Additional file 1: Table S2), despite the specific increase
in B. breve. In addition, several Firmicutes and Proteo-
bacteria taxa were increased in the formula-fed supple-
mented group compared to the formula-fed control
group (Fig. 2): Anaerostipes by fourfold (p = 0.05, GLM),
Veillonella by sevenfold (p < 0.0001, GLM) and Klebsi-
ella by sixfold (p = 0.05, GLM).

 Supplementation prevented caesarean birth-associated
loss of bifidobacteria and normalized microbiota
functions
After establishing a strong overall effect of the treatment,
we tested if the supplement ameliorated some of the
caesarean-induced changes in microbiota composition. In
the control group, the microbiota of the caesarean-deliv-
ered infants was clearly different from the vaginally born
infants (Fig. 3a), most notably due to a lower abundance
of the most abundant genera, Bifidobacterium (75%
decline, p = 0.01, GLS, Additional file 1: Table S3) and
Bacteroides (96% decline, p < 0.0001, GLM). Overall, 6%
(p = 0.001) of the inter-individual variation in microbiota
composition was statistically attributable to birth mode in
the control group according to permutational multivariate
ANOVA. Remarkably, in the supplemented group, birth
mode did not have a significant impact on microbiota
composition (1% p = 0.08). The relative increases in Enter-
ococcaceae, Clostridiaceae and Veillonellaceae that were
observed in the section-born infants of the control group
were not present in the supplemented group (Fig. 3b,
Additional file 1: Table S3). Furthermore, the decline in
Bifidobacteriaceae was prevented, and the declines in Cor-
iobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Bacteroidaceae
were reduced in magnitude by the supplement (Fig. 3b,
Additional file 1: Table S3).
The caesarean section-associated reduction of Bifidobac-
terium and Bacteroides spp., the two most important
groups of bacteria in terms of carbohydrate degradation in
infants, was reflected in the predicted carbohydrate degrad-
ation potential of the microbiota. Based on the taxonomic
composition (abundance of taxa in the samples) and the
CAZy database [25] (carbohydrate-active enzymes present
in the taxa), the carbohydrate degradation potential in the
samples was predicted. The predicted summarized total
abundances of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys) in-
volved in the degradation of different types of carbohy-
drates,
including
human
milk
oligosaccharides,
were
significantly reduced among the caesarean-born infants
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). The predicted abundances of

 these enzyme groups were increased in the supplemented
infants, regardless of birth mode.
We conducted a metaproteome analysis in a subset of
the cohort, including 11 vaginally born control infants, 12
caesarean-born control infants, 13 vaginally born supple-
mented infants and 12 caesarean-born supplemented in-
fants. All were fully breastfed and had received no
antibiotic treatments. The bacterial metaproteomes differed
between birth modes in the control group, but were similar
between birth modes in the supplemented group (Fig. 3c).
Treatment with the supplement thus seemed to eliminate
the effect of birth mode on the metaproteome-derived
functions (Additional file 1: Table S4). This is illustrated by
the
finding
that
the
supplemented
groups
(both
caesarean-born and vaginal-delivered infants) compared to
the vaginally born control group showed a high level of in-
duction (up to 50-fold; Additional file 1: Table S4) of
beta-galactosidase and beta-galactosyl N-acetyl hexosami-
nephosphorylase (LNBP), common bifidobacterial enzymes
involved in the degradation of lactose and human milk oli-
gosaccharides (HMOs), respectively [26]. In contrast, the
bacteria in the caesarean-born infants expressed compara-
tively higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and aspar-
tate ammonia lyase, enzymes involved in potentially
undesired protein degradation. The metaproteome data
were also used to predict the taxonomic origin of the pro-
teins, and the obtained results appeared similar to those
from the 16S rRNA gene data (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
While the sample size in our metagenomic analysis
was small, based on visual inspection of the PCoA plot,

 the genomic content of the microbiota appeared to cluster
by birth mode and treatment: the metagenomes separated
according to birth modes in the control group, but clus-
tered together in the supplemented group (Fig. 3d). As the
birth modes did not clearly differ in the supplemented
group, we grouped together the faecal metagenomes of
the supplemented infants for statistical analysis. Com-
pared to the metagenomes in the vaginally born control
group, a strong increase was observed for the lactose/gal-
actose and rhamnose degradation genes (approximately
20-fold and 4-fold, respectively) while several amino acid
and vitamin B (notably folic acid) synthesis pathways were
significantly reduced (almost 30-fold) in the caesarean-
born control group (Additional file 1: Table S5). These
pathways were increased or unchanged in the supple-
mented group (Additional file 1: Table S5).
Supplement prevented antibiotic-associated microbiota
distortion
Next, we assessed the effects of antibiotics on the micro-
biota and whether the supplement prevented these effects.
In the control group, infants who had been treated with
one or more antibiotic courses showed a clearly different
microbiota composition compared to those that had re-
ceived no antibiotics (Fig. 4a, Additional file 1: Table S6).

 overall impact (< 1%, p = 0.56). In the control group, anti-
biotic use was associated with a decline in bifidobacteria
by 17% (p = 0.015) and increases in Enterococcus and the
Gram-negative classes Gammaproteobacteria and Bacter-
oidia by two-, two- and sixfold (p = 0.017, p = 0.04 and
p < 0.0001), respectively. The supplement prevented or
corrected the antibiotic-associated increases in Bacteroi-
daceae, Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and the
decline in Bifidobacteriaceae (Fig. 4b).
Discussion
Using a combination of taxonomic, metagenomic and
metaproteomic approaches, we showed that most of the
antibiotic- and caesarean-associated changes in the fae-
cal microbiota of infants could be corrected or reduced
by a probiotic supplementation to mother and infant.
The results indicate that breastfeeding together with the
probiotic supplementation offer optimal results in terms
of supporting the microbiota development in these in-
fants. Both the mother and the infant received the same
probiotic supplement. Based on the results, we cannot
conclude what, if any, role the maternally ingested pro-
biotic had on the infant microbiota.
Although the supplement contained oligosaccharides,
the effect of the supplement on the microbiota compos-
ition was dependent on breastfeeding, suggesting that
the amount of oligosaccharides in the supplement was
insufficient to promote the probiotic strains. In fact, the
relative abundance of bifidobacteria declined in the
formula-fed supplemented group, indicating insufficient
substrate availability to support the bifidobacterium
community. Breast milk contains a diverse mixture of
human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), totaling approxi-
mately ca. 1 g/dl [27, 28], corresponding to a total intake
of 5–13 g per day in an infant consuming between 5 and
13 dl of breast milk [29]. This is considerably more than
the amount of galactooligosaccharides (0.8 g/day) in our
study supplement. A dose-dependent bifidogenic effect
of oligosaccharide supplementation ranging between
0.4–0.8 g/dl has previously been shown in formula-fed
infants [30], and prebiotic supplementation at 0.8 g/dl
has been shown to result in similar levels of bifidobac-
teria as full breastfeeding [31]. An amount of oligosac-
charides close to those observed in breast milk are likely
required to achieve the full bifidogenic effect. In addition
to the amount of oligosaccharides, their composition
may play a role. In this respect, HMOs offer a more di-
verse substrate mixture than galactooligosaccharides,
and several strains of B. breve are able to utilize HMOs
[32]. The results indicate that formula-fed infants may
require additional supplementation of prebiotics that
mimic the natural abundance of HMOs in breast milk to
achieve the benefits of probiotics.
Remarkably, L. rhamnosus appeared to benefit from
breastfeeding, even though it cannot utilize HMOs. The
observed benefit of breastfeeding likely reflects a sec-
ondary effect of the increased abundance of bifidobac-
teria, rendering the conditions in the gut more favorable
to L. rhamnosus. Bifidobacteria may have generated
compounds from the HMOs that support growth of L.
rhamnosus, such as fucose [33]. This suggests that pro-
biotic products containing a synergistic mixture of bac-
teria may be more beneficial than single-strain products.

 The most apparent effect of caesarean birth and anti-
biotic use was the relative reduction in bifidobacteria,
which was corrected by the probiotic supplementation. As
bifidobacteria are normally the most abundant bacterial
group at this age, they contribute greatly to the overall mi-
crobial metabolic capacity. Thus, the supplement cor-
rected or lessened most of the caesarean-associated
changes in microbiota function. Caesarean-born infants in
the control group had a microbiota with reduced capacity
for carbohydrate degradation, importantly including the
degradation of HMOs. Rather than degrading complex
HMOs, the caesarean-associated microbiota seemed to
focus on the utilization of lactose. The large amount of
non-digestible oligosaccharides in breast milk promotes
fermentation in the infant and hence the production of
bacterial nutrients. Since the birth mode influences the
composition of the gut microbes and their functional cap-
acity, it is likely that the types and quantities of bacterial
fermentation products vary between vaginally born and
caesarean-born infants. Thus, the results indicate that cae-
sarean birth may influence the composition of nutrients
the infant receives from breast milk, possibly reducing the
amount and altering the composition of SCFAs available
to the host. Furthermore, several vitamin synthesis path-
ways were reduced in the section-born infants and cor-
rected by the supplement. Folate in particular is important
for healthy fetal and infant development [34] and is pro-
duced by certain strains of bifidobacteria, including B.
breve strains [35]. Supplementation with folate-producing
bifidobacterium strains and galactooligosaccharides, or
with human milk, which increases the abundance of bifi-
dobacteria, has been shown to increase serum folate levels
in rats [36, 37]. Bifidobacteria may thus contribute a sig-
nificant amount of folate available to a breastfed infant.
The low abundance of Bacteroides, which is ubiquitous
in caesarean-born infants [7, 9, 38–43], was not fully
corrected by the probiotic treatment. There is currently
no known method of restoring the Bacteroides popula-
tion in caesarean-born infants. Swabbing the infant with
the mother’s vaginal fluids has been shown to fail at both
Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium restoration [40], as
these taxa do not normally occur in the vagina [44]. Fur-
thermore, there are significant health risks involved in
vaginal swabbing [45].
Despite the low abundance of Bacteroides spp. in the
caesarean-born infants, the probiotic treatment was suc-
cessful in reducing the incidence of allergic disease in
this group [24], suggesting that the microbiota restor-
ation achieved by the supplement was sufficient to in-
duce
a
health
benefit.
This
may
be
due
to
the
normalization of the Clostridium-Bifidobacterium bal-
ance, as high abundance of Clostridium spp. and low
abundance of bifidobacteria in infancy have been associ-
ated with increased risk of developing allergic disease
[46, 47]. Furthermore, both B. breve Bb99 and L. rham-
nosus
GG
are
immunomodulatory
bacteria,
with
anti-inflammatory effects [48, 49]. L. rhamnosus GG has
been shown to elicit increased INF-γ production in in-
fants with cow’s milk allergy [50] and to reduce atopic
dermatitis symptoms in IgE-sensitized infants [51]. Both
species have the capacity to bind to intestinal mucus
[52]. Bifidobacteria isolated from healthy infant faeces,
including B. breve, have been shown to have stronger
mucus-binding capacity than bifidobacteria isolated from
allergic infants, mostly B. adolescentis [52]. Adhesion to
intestinal mucus makes direct interaction with host cells
more likely and may be an important factor in early im-
mune system education as well as providing colonization
resistance and long-term mucosal colonization.
We have previously shown that L. rhamnosus GG
supplementation for 7 months in preschool children pre-
vented many penicillin/amoxicillin-associated changes in
the microbiota, but failed to prevent the macrolide-asso-
ciated loss of bifidobacteria [53]. Together with the present
results, this indicates that optimal protection against
antibiotic-associated microbiota disruption may be achieved
by a mixture of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains.
Indeed, studies in adults have shown that Lactobacillus-
Bifidobacterium supplementation during and after H. pylori
eradication therapy (amoxicillin-clarithromycin-lansoprat-
zole) and during amoxicillin treatment helped to alleviate
the antibiotic-associated microbiota disruption [54–56] and
to reduce total gastrointestinal symptoms [57]. A prebiotic
mixture containing 2.25 g fructo-oligosaccharides and inu-
lin has been shown to increase the abundance of bifidobac-
teria and lactobacilli in amoxicillin-treated 1–2-year-old
children [58].
The optimal duration of probiotic supplementation to
prevent microbiota disruption has not been established.
Since the microbiota imbalance in caesarean-born infants
was restored by daily probiotic supplementation by the
age of 3 months, it is possible that this is sufficient treat-
ment duration. Previous studies on antibiotic-treated sub-
jects have given daily probiotic/prebiotic supplements for
3 weeks during and after the antibiotic course with good
results [54–58]. However, it may be beneficial to continu-
ously supplement young infants with a probiotic mixture
during the critical time of microbiota and immune system
maturation.
Conclusions
Early-life antibiotic treatments and caesarean birth influ-
ence a large fraction of the global population and are
associated with global epidemic health problems, such as
childhood
overweight
and
immunological
diseases.
Therefore, treatments achieving even modest improve-
ments at the level of individuals have the potential to in-
duce great health benefits at the population level. Our

 results show that long-term daily B. breve and L. rham-
nosus supplementation combined with breastfeeding is a
safe and effective method to support the microbiota in
caesarean-born and in antibiotic-treated infants. As
these strains are already on the market, their use could
be easily adopted into clinical practice.
Methods
Study design
We analyzed the gut microbiota composition using fae-
cal samples and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in
428 infants at the age of 3 months comprising all high
quality faecal samples of the cohort. A subset of the
samples were additionally analyzed for whole metagen-
ome and metaproteome composition. The infants were
part of a probiotic trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT00298337), the details of which have been pub-
lished previously [24]. Pregnant mothers, whose infants
had increased risk for allergy (at least one parent with a
diagnosed allergic disease), were recruited at antenatal
clinics and through advertisements in the Helsinki area
in 1999–2000. A total of 1223 mothers were randomized
in blocks of six at 35 weeks of gestation into a control
group, receiving two daily capsules with microcrystalline
cellulose, and a treatment group, receiving the same cap-
sules once daily containing a mixture of cells (quantified
as colony forming units, cfu) of Bifidobacterium breve
Bb99 (Bp99 2 × 108 cfu), Propionibacterium freundenrei-
chii subsp. shermanii JS (2 × 109cfu), Lactobacillus rham-
nosus Lc705 (5 × 109 cfu) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus
GG (5 × 109 cfu) until birth. For the first 6 months fol-
lowing birth, the infants received the same capsules that
were opened and mixed into sugar syrup, which in the
treatment group was further supplemented with 0.8 g
galactooligosaccharides (GOS). Adverse effects were
not encountered in either group. Randomization was
done by a statistician, and allocation was concealed
from study participants, care givers, all study doctors
and nurses. Blinding was kept until after the 5-year
evaluation had been done. Faecal samples were col-
lected from the infants at 3 months of age and stored
at − 40 °C. For the present study, faecal samples were
available from 428 infants (Table 1). The parents pro-
vided information on birth mode, breastfeeding dur-
ation, use of formula feeding and antibiotic use via
questionnaires.
Sample processing
DNA was extracted from the faecal samples using a re-
peated bead-beating protocol [59], and the bacterial
composition was analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing
the hypervariable V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
The
library
preparation
was
performed
essentially
according to the protocol by Illumina (https://support.il-
lumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/
documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-me
tagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf)
except
that the 16S rRNA gene amplification and barcoding
were performed in a single reaction. The PCR reaction
comprised of 1 ng/μl template, 1X Phusion® Master Mix
(ThermoFisher, catalog number: F-531 L), 0.25 μM
V3-V4 locus-specific primers and 0.375 μM TruSeq
dual-index primers. The PCR was run under the follow-
ing settings: 98 °C for 30 s, 27 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s,
62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 15 s and finally 10 min at 72 °C,
where after the samples were stored at 4 °C. The PCR
clean-up was performed with AMPure XP beads (Beck-
man Coulter, Copenhagen, Denmark), and confirmation
of the correct amplicon size (ca. ~ 640 base pairs) was
performed on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent
Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The randomly
pooled libraries were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq
or HiSeq 2500 in Rapid Run mode.
We further analyzed the metagenomes of a small sub-
set of infants, including six vaginally born control in-
fants, two control infants born by C-section, one
vaginally born and three C-section-born infants in the
treatment group. All were fully breastfed and had no
antibiotic treatments. For metagenomic analysis, the se-
lected DNA preps were purified with the DNA Clean &
Concentrator
TM-5
Kit
(Zymo
Research,
Ontario,
Canada) and eluted in low-TE buffer after which the li-
braries were prepared using Nextera DNA kit and se-
quenced in HiSeq Rapid SE200–run using 50% of the
flow cell.
Selected faecal samples (n = 48) were subject to meta-
proteome analysis by processing an aliquot (125 mg) of
the freshly thawed faecal samples and extracting the pro-
teins by bead beating as described previously [60]. Pro-
tein analysis and the subsequent peptide identification of
bacterial proteins were performed as described previ-

 were recovered from the gel, alkylated and trypsin
digested as described previously. Finally, the protein di-
gests were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a nanoflow HPLC
system (Easy-nLCII, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled
to a LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a
nano-electrospray ionization source. This and the subse-
quent peptide identification of bacterial were performed
essentially as described previously [61].
Statistical analysis
The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing reads were ana-
lyzed using the R package mare [62]. The median num-
ber of reads obtained per sample was 46,934 and varied
from 105 to 151,840. Samples with < 100 reads (N = 6)
were excluded from the analysis, as they seemed to have
insufficient coverage based on the estimated richness.
Although paired-end sequencing was conducted, we only
used the forward reads truncated to 150 bases, as we
have observed using artificial communities of known
composition that longer reads provide unreliable results
[62]. Potential sequencing errors were removed by dis-
carding unique reads, which occurred < 100 times in the
total dataset. Taxonomic annotation was performed
using USEARCH [63] by mapping the reads to the
SILVA 16S rRNA reference database version 115 [64],
restricted to gut-associated taxa. The metagenomic se-
quences were quality filtered using USEARCH and then
analyzed using HUMAnN2 and Metaphlan2 [65].
The statistical analysis was conducted in R with the
package mare [62], with tools from packages vegan [66],
MASS [67] and nlme [68]. Based on the taxonomic data,
we predicted the carbohydrate metabolism capacity of
the microbiota using the CAZy database [25]. Associa-
tions between the overall microbiota composition and
background variables were assessed using principal coor-
dinates analysis and multivariate permutational analysis
of variance. For assessing the effect of birth mode, the
infants were divided into four groups based on treat-
ment and birth mode, using the vaginally born control
group as the reference group, and the models were ad-
justed for antibiotic use and feeding type. When asses-
sing the effect of antibiotic use, the infants were divided
into four groups based on treatment and antibiotic use,
using the non-antibiotic-treated control group as the ref-
erence group, and the models were adjusted for birth
mode and feeding type. The effect of the treatment, anti-
biotic exposure, caesarean birth and feeding type (full or
partial breastfeeding or exclusive formula feeding) on
the abundance of the bacterial taxa were analyzed using
negative binomial models, with the number of reads per
sample as the offset. If the fitted model failed to fulfill
model assumptions (primarily heteroscedasticity of the
residuals), the observed problems were corrected using
generalized least squares models. For this reason, the
statistical test is not the same for all taxa, as the distri-
bution of the data varies between taxa. Only genera
observed
in
> 10%
of
the
samples
were
analyzed
individually.
We included a set of negative control samples, consist-
ing of only PCR reagents, and sequenced these together
with the real samples. Overall, the number of reads for
the negative controls was very small (median 260 reads)
compared to the real samples (median 46,674 reads).
This indicates that contaminants likely contributed only
a few hundred reads per sample, which would not
greatly influence the overall observed composition. The
most abundant taxa in the negative controls were
Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus, which formed a very
small abundance in the real samples, representing re-
spectively 0.2% and 1.2% of total reads on average. In
addition, we have previously published data on positive
control samples (mock communities), validating the se-
quencing and bioinformatics methods [69].
