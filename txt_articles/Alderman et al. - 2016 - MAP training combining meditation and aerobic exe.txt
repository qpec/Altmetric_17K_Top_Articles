MAP training: combining meditation and aerobic exercise
reduces depression and rumination while enhancing
synchronized brain activity
BL Alderman1, RL Olson1,2, CJ Brush1 and TJ Shors3
Mental and physical (MAP) training is a novel clinical intervention that combines mental training through meditation and physical
training through aerobic exercise. The intervention was translated from neuroscientific studies indicating that MAP training
increases neurogenesis in the adult brain. Each session consisted of 30 min of focused-attention (FA) meditation and 30 min of
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. Fifty-two participants completed the 8-week intervention, which consisted of two sessions per
week. Following the intervention, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 22) reported significantly less depressive
symptoms and ruminative thoughts. Typical healthy individuals (n = 30) also reported less depressive symptoms at follow-up.
Behavioral and event-related potential indices of cognitive control were collected at baseline and follow-up during a modified
flanker task. Following MAP training, N2 and P3 component amplitudes increased relative to baseline, especially among individuals
with MDD. These data indicate enhanced neural responses during the detection and resolution of conflicting stimuli. Although
previous research has supported the individual beneficial effects of aerobic exercise and meditation for depression, these findings
indicate that a combination of the two may be particularly effective in increasing cognitive control processes and decreasing
ruminative thought patterns.

INTRODUCTION
Thousands of new neurons are produced each day in a ‘normal’
healthy brain.1,2 Many of these cells are produced in the
hippocampus, a brain region necessary for various types of
learning. These cells are produced in a part of the hippocampus
known as the dentate gyrus, whose primary neuronal phenotype
is the granule neuron. In animal models, newly generated neurons
in the dentate gyrus are especially responsive to environmental
conditions that humans often experience. For example, stressful
life events tend to decrease neurogenesis, whereas antidepres-
sants can increase cell production.3–5 These findings, among
others, led to a neurogenesis hypothesis of depression, which
proposes that depression is accompanied by a loss of new granule
neurons, while a renewal of these same cells can reverse
depressive symptomatology.4–6 Antidepressants are not the only
depression-related therapies known to increase neurogenesis.
Most notably, aerobic exercise can greatly increase the number of
cells that are produced in the hippocampus. Animals given the
opportunity to run on a daily basis can produce nearly twice as
many new cells as sedentary controls.7–9 Importantly, however,
these new neurons are not necessarily permanent. Even under
‘healthy’ conditions, many of these new cells can die within
several weeks of being born, often before differentiating into
mature neurons.10 Nevertheless, many of the newly born neurons
can be rescued from death by new learning experiences and they
may even be involved in learning itself.11,12
Not all types of learning keep new neurons alive. Rather the
learning experiences must be effortful—requiring more trials of
practice to learn.13–15 These tasks bear some resemblance to
effortful mental training in humans.16,17 Accordingly, mental
training can rescue new neurons from death as long as the
learning experience is new and effortful. Collectively, these
findings suggest that aerobic exercise increases the production
of new neurons in the adult brain, while effortful mental training
experiences keep a significant number of those cells alive.7 On the
basis of these neurogenic mechanisms, we developed a novel
neurobehavioral intervention, referred to as mental and physical
(MAP) training. Focused-attention (FA) meditation was selected as
the mental training component because it requires significant
mental effort to perform and each session of practice represents a
new learning opportunity.18,19 The physical training component
consists of aerobic exercise, which has been shown to be
beneficial for brain structure and function as well as for promoting
overall physical and mental health.20,21 Theoretically, the combi-
nation of aerobic exercise and FA meditation may increase the
number of newborn cells in the hippocampus and rescue these
newly generated cells, which may be integrated into the brain
circuitry.
In the present study, we tested the efficacy of MAP training in
improving symptoms of depression and rumination in individuals
with major depressive disorder (MDD). Depression is a debilitating
disorder that affects nearly one in five Americans in their lifetime,
many experiencing their first episodes as adolescents and young
adults. The inability to focus, concentrate or make decisions is a
hallmark symptom of depression.22,23 This clinical presentation is
indicative of deficits in cognitive control, a broad term that

 encompasses core cognitive processes of planning, inhibition
(including self-control), problem solving and mental flexibility.24
Because cognitive control processes are important for neurocog-
nitive and affective functioning, this impairment may contribute
to other symptoms in depression, particularly rumination.23,25
Indeed, rumination may be a key cognitive and affective process
in depression,
wherein
individuals
retrieve
and
repetitively
rehearse autobiographical memories about past and current
problems. This passive and perseverative process likely disrupts
the ability to concentrate, learn and engage in healthy decision-
making processes.26,27
A number of studies report that hippocampal volume is
reduced in individuals with MDD,28,29 although this finding is
not consistent enough to be a biomarker. Nonetheless, we do
know that the acquisition and short-term retention of autobio-
graphical memories activate the hippocampus and depend on
neuronal activity within the hippocampus. Therefore, we hypothe-
sized that MAP training, because it is designed to maximally
activate hippocampal neurons, would be especially effective in
reducing rumination. We further propose that a decrease in
rumination will be reflected by an increase in synchronized neural
activity in cortical regions linked to cognitive control since
previous research suggests important and possibly reciprocal
relationships
between
cognitive
control
impairments
and
rumination, which may be related to increased vulnerability for
depression.30 Thus, we hypothesized that MAP training would not
only reduce ruminative thoughts, but would also ameliorate
deficits in cognitive control processes. To assess this change,
event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a
cognitive control task that involves conflict monitoring and
inhibitory control (that is, a modified Eriksen flanker task).
It is widely accepted that either aerobic exercise or FA
meditation
alone
can
reduce
symptoms
of
depression
in
individuals with MDD.31,32 However, to date no one has directly
assessed the combined effects of these two behavioral interven-
tions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy
of a combined 8-week MAP training intervention on depressive
symptoms, ruminative thought patterns and cognitive control
processes in individuals with and without a clinical diagnosis of
MDD. It was hypothesized that before MAP training, individuals
with MDD would report greater rumination levels and display
reduced conflict-related neural activity relative to typical healthy
individuals, but these deficits would be remediated following the
intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Men and women with a diagnosis of nonpsychotic MDD were recruited
from a university counseling and psychiatric services clinic. Participants in
the MDD group were included if they met diagnostic (DSM-IV-TR) criteria
for current MDD,33 confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI34). The MINI is an appropriate tool for assigning threshold-
level psychiatric diagnoses in research settings and has strong diagnostic
agreement with other clinical interviews such as the Structured Clinical
Interview for the DSM.35 Exclusion criteria included bipolar or psychotic
disorders, self-injurious or suicidal behavior, or a history of neurological
disorders or head injuries resulting in a loss of consciousness. Healthy
comparison participants who did not meet criteria for MDD via the MINI
were also recruited and included if they reported no previous or current
history of neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological disorders or head
injuries. In addition, handedness (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) was
assessed to minimize heterogeneity in neurocognitive measures, but was
not used as an exclusionary factor. All eligible individuals were invited to
visit the laboratory for a clinical interview and neurophysiological testing at
baseline before beginning the MAP training intervention. Sixty-nine
participants (33 depressed, 36 nondepressed) who met the inclusion
criteria were initially enrolled in the study,30 and 22 depressed and 30
nondepressed individuals completed the 8-week MAP training interven-
tion with complete baseline and post-intervention data (~75% retention
rate). No significant differences were observed in the demographic,
behavioral or cognitive status between those who finished the MAP
intervention and those who did not. Before participation in this study,
participants provided written informed consent that was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.
Recruited participants were scheduled for study entry and baseline
assessments by trained clinical research staff. Potential participants were
given contact information, including a phone number and email address
for the study staff/coordinator, who provided study information and
scheduled an initial screening to determine eligibility. After determining
initial eligibility, the study coordinator scheduled a secondary screening
appointment for the informed consent process and baseline assessments,
during which they completed a structured diagnostic interview, neuro-
cognitive assessment and a maximal aerobic fitness test (VO2 peak).
Subsequently, participants were assigned to the 8-week MAP training
intervention. At the end of the 8-week program, all the participants were
invited back to the laboratory to complete the same battery of
assessments, including measures of clinical symptoms, neurocognitive
function and aerobic fitness (VO2 peak) following the same protocol.
MAP training intervention
MAP training is a neurobehavioral intervention developed from basic
neuroscientific studies suggesting that MAP training may work synergis-
tically to improve cognitive and brain health.17,36 For the mental
component, participants engaged in FA meditation, which is challenging
to learn and practice.37,38 During FA meditation, participants sat in silence
in a cross-legged or otherwise comfortable upright posture. For the
meditation practice, participants were instructed to bring their full focus of
attention to the breath and to count each breath if that helped to maintain
focus on the breath. If their attention drifted to thoughts about the past or
future, participants were instructed to acknowledge this change and return
their attention to the breath. With practice, one recognizes the transient
nature of thoughts and learns to monitor and accept moment-to-moment
changes in attention.39 After 20 min of sitting meditation, participants
engaged in 10 min of slow-walking meditation, this time focusing their
attention on their feet as they transitioned from one foot to the other in a
slow walk with other participants. The 10 min walking portion of the
meditation session was not only a secondary form of FA meditation
training, but also a chance to return blood flow to the extremities before
the upcoming session of aerobic exercise. Immediately following the
meditation session, participants prepared for the exercise component.
For the physical component, participants performed aerobic exercise at
a moderate intensity for 30 min. Following a 5-min warm-up, participants
exercised either on a treadmill or cycle ergometer at a heart rate (HR)
intensity range corresponding to 50–70% VO2 peak as determined by their
individual baseline fitness assessment before MAP training. Trained
research staff supervised all exercise sessions and monitored intensity by
assessing HR throughout exercise. This dose of exercise (that is, intensity
and duration) is consistent with public health recommendations and is
known to reduce depressive symptoms among individuals with MDD.40,41
After 30 min of aerobic exercise, participants cooled down for ~ 5 min.
MDD diagnosis and assessment of depression symptom severity
At baseline, the Mini Neuropsychiatric Diagnostic Interview (MINI; manic/
hypomanic
episodes,
obsessive-compulsive
disorder,
substance
and
alcohol use disorders) was used to confirm clinical diagnosis of MDD.
The MINI is a brief structured interview that has been used extensively to
aid in making diagnoses of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and International Classification of
Diseases-10 (ICD-10) psychiatric disorders. The reliability and validity of this
instrument has been previously established.34,42,43
Depressive symptoms
The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II44) is a 21-item, self-report
inventory of the severity of current depressive symptoms. The BDI was
used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline and at
post-intervention. Higher total scores reflect greater subjectively perceived
depressive symptomatology. The BDI-II in this sample demonstrated good
internal consistency (α = 0.92) at baseline and the point biserial correlation
coefficient of MDD diagnosis with BDI-II scores was 0.80, Po0.01.

 Ruminative thought patterns
Participants completed the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS45) before and
after MAP training. The RRS includes 22 items describing thoughts and
responses that are focused on the self, the symptoms and the potential
consequences and causes of their depressed mood. In addition, the scale is
further defined by three subscales, which include depression, brooding
and reflection.46 Participants were asked to indicate how often they exhibit
a certain behavior on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always)
when they feel down, sad or depressed. The RRS scale demonstrated
appropriate internal consistency (α = 0.93).
Cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity assessment
Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) was assessed by a maximal oxygen
consumption test using a motor-driven treadmill and a modified Bruce
protocol.47 During this test, participants began walking on a treadmill,
which increased in speed and incline every 2 min until volitional
exhaustion or VO2 peak criteria were met. A Polar HR monitor (Polar
Electro, Kempele, Finland) was used to measure HR throughout the test,
and a rating of perceived exertion48 was taken 1 min into each stage.
Rating of perceived exertion allows participants to rate their perceived
physical effort on a numerical scale ranging from 6 to 20, which correlates
with HR during exercise.49 Relative VO2 peak (ml kg − 1 min − 1) was
determined from direct expired gas exchange data from an indirect
calorimetry metabolic system and was established as the maximal average
oxygen consumption when at least three of the following criteria were
met: (1) a plateau in VO2 values despite a progressive increase in workload,
(2) a maximal HR within 10 beats per minute (b.p.m.) of age-predicted
maximal values (220 b.p.m. minus age in years), (3) a respiratory exchange
ratio greater than 1.10 or (4) a rating of perceived exertion greater than or
equal to 17. Oxygen consumption was measured through indirect
calorimetry using a ParvoMedics True Max 2400 Metabolic Measurement
Cart (ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT, USA) and was averaged over 15-s intervals. A
3–5 min cool-down was then performed at 2.5 m.p.h. and 0% grade to
ensure participants returned to near baseline cardiovascular values. HR was
recorded during the fitness assessment and was used to define individual
training zones during the intervention. Fitness was reassessed upon
completion of the 8-week intervention using the same procedures.
In addition, participants were also asked to recall the amount of physical
activity that they engaged in at baseline and following MAP training using
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.50 The International
Physical Activity Questionnaire-short-form assesses the frequency and
duration of moderate and vigorous intensity activity and walking physical
activity. These data were summarized to report physical activity by
weighting the energy expenditure for these categories of activity to
produce MET-minutes of physical activity.
Cognitive control
A modified arrow version of the Eriksen flanker task30,51 was presented
using E-Prime version 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). Participants completed the flanker task at baseline and post-
intervention to assess changes in behavioral and neurophysiological
cognitive control processes. The flanker task is composed of two
conditions, congruent and incongruent, during which participants are
asked to press either a left or right button corresponding to the direction
of a centrally located target arrow. The congruent trials consisted of the
central target being flanked by arrows pointing in the same direction (for
example, ««o), while incongruent trials involved the target being flanked
by arrows pointing in the opposing direction (for example, «4«). A set of
instructions preceded the first trial that explained which button press
would be used to indicate the direction of the central or target arrow.
Participants performed a button press with their left thumb when the
target arrow pointed to the left (o) and a button press with their right
thumb when the target arrow pointed to the right (4). In addition,
participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as
possible for each trial. Each trial began with a black fixation cross (+) in the
center of a white screen for 500 ms, followed by 1.5 cm tall × 8 cm long
black arrows centered focally on a white background for 100 ms with a
response window of 1500 ms. A random inter-stimulus time interval of
1100, 1300, or 1500 ms was used between each visual fixation (+) and the
stimulus in order to reduce potential anticipatory responses. Following
the instructions, participants completed 20 practice trials, including
equiprobable congruent and incongruent trials. Performance feedback
was provided and any remaining questions were resolved during the
practice trials to ensure a sufficient familiarization and understanding of
the task. After the practice, the participants completed two blocks of 110
trials with equiprobable congruency and directionality of the stimuli. The
stimuli were presented on a monitor at a distance of 70 cm centered to the
nasion and the vertical and horizontal visual angles were 1.2° and 6.6°,
respectively. In addition to behavioral measures of accuracy and reaction
time, continuous electroencephalographic data were collected during the
flanker task to derive N2 and P3 component amplitudes.
Event-related potentials
Continuous electroencephalographic activity was recorded from 64 scalp
sites using a HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net and Electrical Geodesics
(Eugene, OR, USA) amplifier system (20 K nominal gain, bandpass = 0.1–
100 Hz) and arranged according to the International 10-10 system.52 The
electro-oculogram was recorded from electrodes placed above and below
each eye. Continuous data were initially referenced to the vertex electrode
(Cz) and digitized continuously at 250 Hz with a 24-bit analog-to-digital
converter. Impedances were maintained below 50 kΩ. Although lower
impedances are typically recommended, previous research has produced
acceptable electroencephalographic signals when data were collected
with higher scalp impedances,53 and similar values have been used in
previous studies of cognitive control and depression.54,55
Following collection, data were re-referenced to the average of the left
and right mastoids56,57 and bandpass filtered with a low-pass frequency of
30 Hz and high-pass frequency of 0.1 Hz. The continuous electroencepha-
lographic
data
were
manually
inspected
and
periods
with
large
movement-related artifacts (eye blinks, eye movement and muscle activity)
were removed using NetStation 4.0 (Electrical Geodesic). Stimulus-locked
epochs were created from 100 ms pre-stimulus to 1000 ms post stimulus
and baseline-adjusted using the 100 ms pre-stimulus period. NetStation
detection software, which allows for the adjustment of settings for
detecting and marking artifacts and contaminated segments, was used to
detect eye blinks, vertical and horizontal eye movements, and bad
channels. Marked segments were visually inspected and rejected if they
contained (1) eye movements exceeding 55 μV, (2) eye blinks exceeding
14 μV or (3) greater than or equal to 10 bad channels exceeding 200 μV. In
each case, a moving average of 20 samples combined with threshold
values was used. Using spherical spline interpolation, bad channels were
then replaced from the remaining channels in ‘good’ segments. Trials were
also visually inspected for remaining artifacts, and data from individual
channels containing artifacts were rejected on a trial-by-trial basis.
Only correct trials were used for the corresponding ERP analyses. Using
a mean amplitude approach,58 the N2 component was defined as the
mean amplitude within a 200–350 ms window post-stimulus onset,30,59
whereas the P3 component was defined as the mean amplitude within a
250–500 ms window post-stimulus onset.60
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were first performed on participant demographic and
fitness data. Using the G*Power 3 program, with a Cohen’s d = 0.56,
significance level α = 0.05, required power (1 − β) = 0.08, and number of
groups = 2, the sample of 22 depressed and 30 nondepressed individuals
who completed the 8-week MAP training intervention resulted in sufficient
power for this study. Before conducting analyses, cognitive outcome
measures were assessed for normality. To test the effects of MAP training
intervention on depressive symptoms, rumination and aerobic fitness, we
used repeated-measures analyses of variance (RM ANOVAs) with group
status (MDD or healthy) as a between-subjects variable and time (pre- and
post-intervention) as a within-subjects variable. For behavioral perfor-
mance (accuracy and reaction time) and ERP measures (N2 and P3), we
used three-way RM ANOVAs with group status as a between-subjects
variable and time (pre- and post-intervention) and congruency (congruent
and incongruent) serving as within-subjects variables. To reduce the
potential effect of outliers, trials with RTs beyond the individual mean ± 3 s.d.
for each trial type were excluded. Statistical analyses for the N2 and P3
ERP components were performed using five electrode sites across the
midline (N2: Fz, FCz and Cz; P3: Cz, CPz and Pz). The anterior N2 is most
robust and frequently examined at frontocentral midline electrode
sites,59,61 while the posterior P3 component is most prominent and
commonly studied at centroparietal midline electrode sites.62,63 Thus, Fz,
FCz and Cz electrodes were used for N2 analyses and Cz, CPz and Pz
electrode sites for P3 analyses. All the tests were conducted as two-tailed
and the family-wise alpha level of probability was set at Po0.05 before
MAP training

 Bonferroni correction and adjusted when appropriate with the Green-
house–Geisser epsilon correction for non-sphericity.64 Planned compar-
isons and post hoc analyses were conducted using Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. Last, bivariate correlations were conducted to
examine the relationship between change scores in ERP component
amplitudes and self-reported rumination. Partial eta squared (η2
p) values
are presented as effect sizes.
RESULTS
Consistent with higher incidence of MDD among women,65,66
more women with MDD volunteered to participate and enrolled in
the current study. Overall, self-reported symptoms of depression
on the BDI were significantly higher for women than for men,
F(1,48) = 6.67, Po0.01. However, we did not detect sex differences
in behavioral task performance measures (accuracy and response
time) or ERP component amplitudes. Therefore, task performance
and ERP data were collapsed across sex for subsequent analyses.
As expected, men had higher VO2 peak values than women
(47.3 ± 6.4 ml kg − 1 min − 1 vs 34.2 ± 5.6 ml kg − 1 min − 1). Depressed
and healthy groups did not differ significantly on any demo-
graphic or fitness measures before MAP Training (P-values 40.19;
see Table 1 for demographic and fitness data). Meta-analytic
findings report moderate-sized effects for the treatment of
depression with exercise.
BDI-II analysis—depressive symptoms
Participants with a clinical diagnosis of MDD reported higher
levels
of
depressive
symptoms
before
MAP
training,
F(1,50) = 79.20; Po0.001, η2
p = 0.61. The two-way RM ANOVA on
BDI-scores also revealed a significant main effect of time
(pre-post), F(1,50) = 58.8, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.54, indicating that both
groups reported significantly lower symptoms of depression
following the 8-week intervention. However, these main effects
were
superseded
by
a
significant
group × time
interaction,
F(1,50) = 18.73, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.27, such that the decrease in
depressive symptoms was significantly greater for the depressed
group than for the healthy control group, see Figure 1.
Ruminative responses scale
The RM ANOVA for overall rumination (RRS) scores revealed a
significant main effect of group, F(1,50) = 31.6, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.39,
such that the MDD group (M = 55.8 ± 2.0) reported significantly
greater
self-reported
rumination
relative
to
the
healthy
comparison group, (M = 41.0 ± 1.6; see Figure 2) at baseline,
F(1,48) = 19.89, Po0.001. A significant main effect of time was
observed, F(1,50) = 16.6, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.25, indicating that both
the groups demonstrated a significant pre-to-post intervention
decrease in ruminative thought patterns. No significant interaction
between group and time on rumination was found, P40.05.
Cardiorespiratory fitness—VO2 peak
As expected, males had higher VO2 peak values than females,
F(1,50)= 52.78, Po0.001. A two-way RM ANOVA was conducted to
determine whether changes in aerobic fitness occurred following
the 8-week MAP intervention. No significant main effect of group
emerged, indicating no between-group differences in aerobic
fitness. In addition, MAP training was not associated with an
increase in aerobic fitness levels, P40.05. With respect to changes in
physical activity, however, participants reported an overall increase
in daily physical activity following MAP training, F(1,50)= 4.29,
Po0.05, η2
p = 0.19, above the amount of physical activity required
during the intervention. These data suggest that participation in the
MAP training intervention was insufficient to alter fitness levels, but
resulted in an increase in daily physical activity.
Behavioral performance data
For accuracy on the flanker task, the mixed 2 (group) × 2 (task
congruency) ANOVA revealed a main effect of congruency,
F(1,50) = 29.28, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.37, indicating worse performance
on incongruent relative to congruent trials. No main effect of
group
or
group
by
congruency
interaction
was
observed,
indicating that MDD and healthy controls did not differ in terms
of overall performance accuracy. However, this analysis also
confirmed that a comparable number of data points were
available in each group for subsequent ERP analysis. The RM
ANOVA for RT similarly showed a main effect of congruency, F
(1,50) = 391.72, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.89, owing to faster response
times for congruent vs incongruent trials. Similar to accuracy, the
main effect of group and the group × congruency interaction were
not statistically significant. Overall, there were minimal effects of
depression status, sex and MAP training on behavioral task
performance measures (Table 2).
ERP component amplitudes
In a previous study,30 we reported that the N2 component of the
ERP elicited by the flanker task is reduced in individuals with MDD.
Many of these same individuals (n = 50) participated in the current
intervention, and the N2 and P3 component amplitude responses
were thus re-analyzed here with MAP training serving as a
repeated-measures variable (pre-to-post intervention). The mixed
model three-way ANOVA for N2 averaged across Fz, FCz and Cz
electrode
sites
revealed
a
significant
time
main
effect,
F(1,50) = 48.53, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.49, with significantly larger (that
is, more negative) N2 values occurring following MAP training
relative to values at baseline, Po0.001. A significant congruency
effect was also observed, F(1,50) = 28.45, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.36, such
that more negative N2 values were observed during the more
challenging incongruent task trials. The significant main effect of
MAP training was superseded by a significant time × group
interaction, F(1,50) = 34.39, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.41. Decomposition of
this interaction revealed that the depressed group had a larger
increase in N2 amplitude from pre- (0.87 ± .55 μV) to post
intervention (−0.68 ± 0.43 μV) relative to their nondepressed
counterparts (−0.62 ± 0.47 μV, − 0.76 ± 0.37 μV), see Figure 2. No
other significant main effects or interactions were found for N2
component amplitude.
The RM ANOVA for P3 component amplitude revealed a
significant congruency main effect, F(1,50) = 131.52, Po0.001,
η2
p = 0.73, with larger component amplitudes found for incon-
gruent relative to congruent task trials. This main effect was
superseded by a significant congruency by group interaction,
F(1,50) = 5.41, Po0.05, η2
p = 0.10, and a congruency × time inter-
action, F(1,50) = 13.59, Po0.001, η2
p = 0.21. There was also a
significant three-way interaction of time × congruency × group
status, F(1,50) = 9.28, Po0.01, η2
p = 0.16. Although depressed
individuals exhibited a nonsignificant trend towards smaller P3

 amplitude at baseline relative to the nondepressed group, (5.82 vs
6.28 μV), they had a significantly larger increase in P3 amplitude to
incongruent trials from pre-to-post intervention compared with
typical
healthy
undergraduates,
Po0.01,
see
Figure
3.
As
expected, these data suggest that depressed participants dis-
played enhanced neuronal activity during the conflict monitoring
task
following
the
intervention.
Further,
this
increase
was
observed during task trials that require the greatest amount of
conflict and cognitive control.
Correlational analysis
Last, to assess whether the change in ruminative thought patterns
was related to enhanced neural responses during conflict
monitoring,
bivariate
correlations
were
conducted
between
change scores in ERP component amplitudes and rumination
scores from pre-to-post MAP training. The change score in N2
amplitude was significantly correlated with RRS change scores,
r = 0.30, Po0.05, see Figure 4. Thus, decreased rumination
at post-intervention was associated with larger N2 amplitudes,
suggesting a possible neurophysiological mechanism linking
cognitive control processes with ruminative thoughts, and how
these mechanisms might be strengthened across the 8-week
intervention period.
DISCUSSION
It is widely accepted that aerobic exercise and meditation training
are useful behavioral therapies for remediating clinical symptoms

 of depression.31,32 However, no study to date has assessed the
combined effects of the two behavioral interventions. Here, we
present data indicating that a combination of FA meditation and
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly reduces symp-
toms of depression in individuals with MDD. The effects were
robust, as evident by the nearly 40% reduction in depressive
symptoms after only 8 weeks of training. Interestingly, individuals
without a clinical diagnosis of MDD also reported significant
reductions in depressive symptoms. Participants with MDD also
exhibited a significant decrease in self-reported ruminative
thoughts,
which
typically
involve
repetitive
thinking
about
autobiographical memories and negatively valenced content from
the past. Along with these positive changes in psychological
outcomes, significant increases in synchronized neural activity
were found following MAP training. In particular, N2 amplitude
was lower in the depressed group at baseline and N2 amplitudes
increased at post-intervention in both depressed and healthy
groups. For the P3 component, an increase in amplitude was
observed for the depressed group following the intervention for
task trials that result in the greatest amount of conflict. This
resulted in an enhancement of P3 in the depressed group that
approached those observed in the healthy comparison group at
post-intervention. These ERPs have previously been used to reflect
neural activity during conflict monitoring and cognitive control.67
Importantly, we failed to detect differences in behavioral task
performance measures between depressed and healthy indivi-
duals at baseline or following MAP training. Therefore, these MAP-
induced changes in ERPs reflect an overall increase in the
synchronous neuronal responses during a task that requires an
upregulation of cognitive control during conflict monitoring.
Moreover, ERPs may be more sensitive to a neurobehavioral
intervention among young adults with and without MDD than
more traditional overt behavioral performance measures alone. In
our study, individuals with MDD initially exhibited impairments in
both N2 and P3 amplitudes relative to healthy individuals.
Therefore, the increase in component amplitudes reflects a return
to neurophysiological levels more consistent with their otherwise
healthy counterparts. From these results, we propose that the
MAP training intervention reduces rumination, which is associated
with enhanced neural representations of conflict monitoring and
cognitive control, particularly among individuals with MDD.
Previous evidence suggests that regular aerobic exercise improves
mental health and neurocognitive function, including processes
related to learning and memory. The evidence for mental health
benefits, although impressive for healthy individuals, is even
stronger for clinical and psychiatric populations.40,68–70 Indeed,
randomized controlled trials indicate that aerobic exercise is as
effective as common antidepressants (for example, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
in reducing depression,69,71 as well as in reducing relapse rates.68
With respect to mechanisms, there are many potential candidates.
One involves the autonomic nervous system, which regulates
cardiovascular and stress responses, and has been implicated in
various lifestyle choices and health risk behaviors.72–74 For
example, we recently reported that aerobic fitness positively
relates to neurocardiac balance (an index of autonomic function);

 individuals with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak)
displayed greater neurocardiac balance between sympathetic
and
parasympathetic
branches
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system.75
A
second
candidate
mechanism
is
neurogenesis,
specifically the production of new neurons in the hippocampal
formation of the adult brain.6,76,77 A number of studies have
reported that exercise in laboratory animals increases neurogen-
esis and exposure to stressful conditions that mimic stressful life
conditions in humans reduce cell production. Because individuals
with MDD often exhibit reduced hippocampal volumes,28 some
have speculated that aerobic exercise alleviates depression
through an increase in cell proliferation.78 However, it is not yet
possible to monitor neurogenesis in humans and therefore, these
theories remain premature.
Similar to aerobic exercise, the practice of meditation has
garnered increasing attention as an effective therapy for reducing
symptoms of depression.79 Mindfulness meditation, the practice
of attending to the present moment and allowing thoughts and
emotions to pass without judgment, has received the most
attention as an effective therapy for reducing symptoms of
depression.32,80–82 One variant of mindfulness-based practice is FA
meditation, which is an effortful learning process during which an
individual maintains focus on a selected object (for example, the
breath) and when their focus becomes distracted, they learn to
disengage attention from the source of distraction, and redirect
and engage their attention to the intended object.19 With practice,
the person learns to recognize deviations of attention, thereby
acquiring new skills that can help direct attention to the present
moment, not only during meditation but also in everyday life. FA
meditation is often used as a stepping-stone to other practices, as
well as an end in itself.83 As with most mindfulness-based
practices, FA meditation is associated with clarity of thoughts,
recognition of feelings, the ability to control anger84 and an
improved overall sense of well-being and positive emotion.84–86
Mechanistically, FA meditation induces significant changes in
autonomic nervous system regulation such as heart rate and
respiration87 together with central autonomic network control.88
Studies have also started to document the potential brain regions
and substrates influenced by meditation training. Oft-cited neural
structures include the hippocampus and cortical regions, includ-
ing prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions, which are most
often associated with change. For example, a recent study
reported that just 8 weeks of mindfulness-based meditation
increased the volume of the hippocampus.89 FA on the breath has
also been found to recruit an attention network that includes
parietal and prefrontal structures.90 We propose that meditation
practice coupled with aerobic exercise maximally increases the
integration of networks involved with cognitive control and
learning to those necessary for autonomic nervous system
regulation. This theory is generally consistent with others that
address the mediating factors that disrupt cognitive and affective
processes during depression.28,91–93
Previously, we tested the efficacy of MAP training with women
in the local community who are young mothers and were recently
homeless on the streets of New Jersey. They had recently been
accepted to live full time at a residential treatment center, where
we provided the intervention. The female participants (n = 8)
began the study with severe depressive symptoms, as well as
elevated anxiety levels indexed by Beck Anxiety Inventory. After
8 weeks of MAP training, BDI and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores
dropped nearly in half. Importantly, the young women also
demonstrated significant improvements in their physical health
profile. Before MAP training, their aerobic fitness levels (VO2 peak)
were in the low range. After MAP training, fitness levels increased
into the normal-to-excellent range.47 In the current study, we did
not observe an increase in fitness levels, perhaps because the
sample was composed largely of university undergraduate
students, most of whom were in relatively in good physical
condition before committing to the study. However, participants
in this study reported an increase in physical activity engagement
following the intervention. This is important because it may
indicate that the participants were either more motivated to
exercise or were taking advantage of opportunities to be physically
active as they realized the positive benefits and opportunities
following MAP training. Notably, reductions in symptoms of
depression and enhanced neural responses occurred despite a
change in aerobic capacity, suggesting other potential candidates
as mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial effects of
combining FA meditation with aerobic exercise.
How does the combination of meditation and aerobic exercise
meaningfully decrease depression and/or depressive symptoms?
As previously discussed, the MAP training intervention was
translated from basic neuroscientific research demonstrating that
aerobic exercise and mental training increase neurogenesis in the
adult hippocampus.11,17,36 Indeed, these studies were the first to
report that new neurons in the hippocampus may be involved in
the acquisition and short-term recall of associative memories.12 In
those initial studies, an effortful learning task was used because of
its dependence on the hippocampus for learning and its
association with declarative memories.94–97 In humans, tasks such
as these are often associated with the acquisition of autobio-
graphical memories. Although the hippocampus is ‘activated’
during the acquisition and retrieval of autobiographical and/or
episodic memories, it is only necessary for learning new episodic
memories and recollecting recent memories.95 In other words, the
hippocampus is generally not necessary for the long-term storage
of memories. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis
that rumination preferentially activates the hippocampus because
ruminative thoughts often reflect feelings and/or thoughts about
autobiographical events in the present or recent past. Of course,
the hippocampus does not act alone in these learning processes,
but rather interacts directly and indirectly with prefrontal and
cingulate cortical regions.98,99 Indeed, for many types of learning,
interactions among hippocampal and prefrontal cortices are
necessary to associate memories from the past with the present
context.100 These anatomical and neurophysiological interactions
are likewise necessary for imagining future scenarios and making
adaptive decisions when faced with challenging life situations.101
When individuals are clinically depressed and have difficulties
inhibiting or filtering out ruminative thoughts, it may become
challenging to efficiently ‘time-travel’ without becoming engaged
in memory rehearsal. Therefore, we suggest that individuals with
MDD
who
engage
in
excessive
rumination
are
activating
distributed neuronal circuits within the hippocampus and frontal
cortices, which impairs their ability to acquire new associative
memories. By learning to focus their attention, the participants
acquire new cognitive skills that reduce interference from
negatively biased recollections. These neuronal mechanisms
activated during mental training with meditation are perhaps
further strengthened and even ‘consolidated’ by the physical
training with aerobic exercise that occurs immediately afterwards
in this neurobehavioral intervention.
CONCLUSION
Until recently, the most common and accepted line of treatment
for depression has been psychotropic medications, most notably
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mood stabilizers.
However, recent studies indicate that these drugs may not be as
effective as once thought and even when they are, relapse often
occurs.102–104 Various forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive
behavioral therapy, can be efficacious but require considerable
time and commitment on the part of the patient, not to mention
trained professionals to institute. There are two behavioral
therapies, aerobic exercise and meditation, which have demon-
strated benefits for individuals suffering with depression, are not

 accompanied by profound side effects and can be practiced
across the lifespan. Here, we provide evidence that demonstrates
the effectiveness of a combined behavioral approach in improving
mental and cognitive health outcomes in individuals with MDD
and otherwise healthy individuals.
