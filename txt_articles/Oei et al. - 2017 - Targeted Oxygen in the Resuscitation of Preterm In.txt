abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lower concentrations of oxygen (O2) (≤30%) are recommended for 
preterm resuscitation to avoid oxidative injury and cerebral ischemia. Effects on long-term 
outcomes are uncertain. We aimed to determine the effects of using room air (RA) or 100% 
O2 on the combined risk of death and disability at 2 years in infants <32 weeks’ gestation.
METHODS: A randomized, unmasked study designed to determine major disability and death 
at 2 years in infants <32 weeks’ gestation after delivery room resuscitation was initiated 
with either RA or 100% O2 and which were adjusted to target pulse oximetry of 65% to 95% 
at 5 minutes and 85% to 95% until NICU admission.
RESULTS: Of 6291 eligible patients, 292 were recruited and 287 (mean gestation: 28.9 weeks) 
were included in the analysis (RA: n = 144; 100% O2: n = 143). Recruitment ceased in June 
2014, per the recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee owing to loss 
of equipoise for the use of 100% O2. In non-prespecified analyses, infants <28 weeks who 
received RA resuscitation had higher hospital mortality (RA: 10 of 46 [22%]; than those 
given 100% O2: 3 of 54 [6%]; risk ratio: 3.9 [95% confidence interval: 1.1–13.4]; P = .01). 
Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (n = 13).
CONCLUSIONS: Using RA to initiate resuscitation was associated with an increased risk of death 
in infants <28 weeks’ gestation. This study was not a prespecified analysis, and it was 
underpowered to address this post hoc hypothesis reliably. Additional data are needed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: To reduce 
oxidative stress, clinicians use lower amounts of 
oxygen, including room air, to resuscitate newborn 
infants, but the effects of this method on the short 
and long-term outcomes of preterm infants are 
unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study was 
underpowered for the primary outcome. There 
are important limitations, but results show that 
initiating resuscitation of extremely premature 
infants with lower oxygen levels may increase 
mortality compared with using 100% oxygen.

One hundred percent oxygen (O2) 
has been used for delivery room 
resuscitation of newborn infants for 
more than a century, 
 
1 but animal 
2 
and human 
3 
– 
6 data illustrate that 
this approach leads to oxidative 
stress 
5 and organ injury. 
6 Saugstad 
et al first showed that ventilation 
with room air (RA; 21% O2) did not 
worsen outcomes compared 
with using 100% O2 when used to 
resuscitate mature, hypoxic infants. 
3, 
4 
A meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials of >1300 mostly 
term/near-term, hypoxic infants 
then showed that RA significantly 
reduced the risk of death when used 
instead of 100% O2 for resuscitation 
(relative risk: 0.71 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.54–0.94]; P = .015) 
7 
and reduced severe encephalopathy. 
8 
Most infants, however, were recruited 
from developing countries, 
 
3, 
 
4 
and because RA resuscitation did 
not make a difference to 2-year 
neurodevelopmental outcomes, 
9 the 
applicability for using RA in developed 
countries with different resuscitation 
resources is therefore unclear. 
10
Even less clear is the evidence for 
using less O2 to stabilize preterm 
infants. Preterm infants, in

contrast to term infants, may need 
supplemental O2 
11 because of lung 
immaturity, but antioxidant defenses 
are also suboptimal until the third 
trimester. 
12 This scenario leads to a 
precarious balance between O2 need 
and toxicity. Nevertheless, growing 
evidence shows that preterm 
infants can be supported in the 
short term with <100% O2. 
Although this approach has not 
been associated with major adverse 
consequences, 
 
11, 
 
13 
 
 
 
 
– 
21 including 
death, 
 
22 cerebral vasoconstriction 
(the implications of which are 
uncertain) has been noted. 
13
Over the last decade, 
recommendations for the use of O2 
in the delivery suite have changed 
substantially. Previously, 100% 
O2 was standard of care. 
23, 
 
24 After 
2006, RA 
25 or low levels of fractional 
inspired oxygen (FIO2), such as 
30%, 
26, 
27 became the standard of 
care for preterm infant resuscitation. 
Furthermore, novel preductal 
oximetry (SpO2) data from healthy, 
spontaneously breathing term 
28 and 
preterm 
29 infants showed that SpO2 
increased only gradually after birth. 
In 2010, SpO2 targeting was also 
recommended as standard of care. 
This approach has led to distinct 
change in clinical practice. In 2008, 
50% of Australian and New Zealand 
perinatal centers used 100% O2 
to resuscitate preterm infants. 
30 
However, in 2015, a survey of 630 
clinicians from 25 countries found 
that only 4 used 100% O2 and >70% 
used FIO2 ≤40% O2. 
31
Despite these findings, the long-term 
implications of using anything other 
than 100% O2 to resuscitate preterm 
infants are unknown. In 2007, the 
To2rpido (Targeted Oxygen in the 
Resuscitation of Preterm Infants 
and their Developmental Outcomes) 
study was designed to examine 
2-year outcomes at 2 years of age for 
preterm infants <32 weeks’ gestation 
after resuscitation with either RA or 
100% O2. At that time, only 1 study 
had been published 
11 to suggest that 
preterm resuscitation was possible 
with <100% O2. We hypothesized 
that using RA would decrease risk 
of death and major disability at 
2 years of age by 20% compared 
with 100% O2, but recruitment 
difficulties arose due to loss of 
equipoise for using 100% O2. As a 
consequence, recruitment had to be 
stopped in June 2014 on the advice 
of the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC), which 
nevertheless recommended that 
short-term outcomes be reported 
before availability of 2-year primary 
outcomes.
METHODS
Study Design
The To2rpido study was an 
international multicenter, 
nonblinded, randomized controlled 
trial involving 2 centers in Australia, 
3 in Malaysia, and 1 in Qatar. There 
were no changes to the trial design 
during recruitment.
Inclusion Criteria
Live-born infants <32 weeks’ 
gestation or ≤1250 g birth weight 
(if gestation was uncertain) 
were eligible if their mothers 
presented at least 6 hours before 
delivery and if informed, written 
parental or guardian consent was 
obtained. Infants were excluded 
at any time if they were diagnosed 
with cardiorespiratory or other

abnormalities that had the potential 
to affect oxygenation or mortality.
Randomization and Masking
Infants were randomized by 
computer-generated sequence once 
birth was considered imminent. 
They were grouped into blocks of 10 
stratified according to gestation (<28 
weeks’ gestation and 28–31 weeks’ 
gestation) to ensure even gestational 
distribution. The study was not 
masked because ethics committees 
considered blinding to be difficult 
to achieve, considering that infants 
given 100% O2 would theoretically 
become pinker more rapidly than 
infants started on RA.
Equipment
Each center used a dedicated Rad-7 
oximeter (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, 
CA) preloaded with the Trendcom 
software (Masimo Corporation) to 
enable downloading of SpO2 and heart 
rates onto an Excel file (Microsoft 
Corporation, Bellvue, WA) for later 
verification of hard copy data. Rad-7 
oximeters were used because they 
were equipped with HI-FI trauma 
sensors that were able to provide 
2-second averaging for maximum 
sensitivity to rapid oximetry changes. 
Signal Extraction Technology in the 
Rad-7 oximeters also used techniques 
to optimize SpO2 measurement in 
challenging clinical situations (eg, 
poor perfusion). 
32 Oximeter probes 
were placed on the infant’s right wrist 
for preductal SpO2 measurement. 
The Neopuff Infant Resuscitator 
(Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, 
Auckland, New Zealand) was used 
in all participating centers to deliver 
positive-end expiratory pressure–
controlled intermittent breaths at 
delivery. Ventilation strategies were 
not proscribed as part of the protocol. 
O2 blenders were used in all delivery 
suites for FIO2 blending.
Defi
 nition of the Time of Life
Because delayed cord clamping was 
practiced in some centers, time of 
birth (or time 0) was defined as time 
of cord clamping.
Intervention
Respiratory support was initiated 
with RA or 100% O2 depending on 
randomization. Other aspects of 
resuscitation were provided as per 
expert committee guidelines at the 
time of trial design. 
24, 
 
25 Clinicians 
were advised by protocol to increase 
FIO2 by 10% every minute (or less) 
if preductal saturations were <65% 
before 5 minutes or <80% after 
5 minutes and to decrease FIO2 
by 10% every minute if SpO2 was 
>95% at any time. FIO2 could be 
increased immediately to 100% at 
any time if the infant’s heart rate 
remained persistently <100 beats/
min despite adequate ventilation 
(duration of bradycardia left to 
clinical discretion), if SpO2 was <65% 
at 5 minutes, or if external cardiac 
massage or resuscitation medications 
(eg, adrenaline) were required.
Data Collection
Hard copy records of heart rates, 
FIO2, SpO2, and resuscitation events 
were viewed visually and recorded 
by a team member who was not 
involved in the resuscitation process. 
Ventilatory parameters from 
admission into the NICU and until 12 
hours of life were also noted.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death 
and major disability at 2 years 
corrected age (gestational age plus 
chronological age minus 40 weeks). 
Major disability was defined as ≥1 of 
the following: (1) composite cognitive 
score <85 and/or language score 
<85 on the Bayley Scale of Infant 
Development III; (2) severe visual 
loss (<6/60 vision); (3) cerebral 
palsy with Gross Motor Function 
Classification System level ≥2; or (4) 
deafness requiring hearing aids.
Secondary outcomes were as follows: 
(1) neonatal morbidities such as 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
grade ≥3 
33; (2) bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia 
34; (3) necrotizing 
enterocolitis requiring surgery or 
resulting in death; and (4) duration of 
ventilatory support and respiratory 
status on NICU admission.

Statistical Analysis, Including 
Additional Assessments
Sample Size Calculation
A total of 1976 infants (988 infants 
in each arm) were required to 
demonstrate decreased incidence 
of death and neurodevelopmental 
disability by 20%, from 30% to 24%, 
with a 2-sided, type I error rate of 5% 
and 80% power. A correction factor 
of 1.15 was applied to account for 
15% attrition to follow-up to 2 years 
of age.
Analysis
Analysis was conducted on an 
intention-to-treat basis, after 
excluding infants with life-
threatening congenital anomalies 
(see Inclusion Criteria section). 
Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum) 
were used for the analysis of 
continuous variables. Counts 
and percentages were used for 
categorical variables. Student’s t test 
and Mann-Whitney tests were used 
for continuous variables according 
to their distributions. The χ2 test was 
used for categorical variables. Factors 
known to influence mortality were 
entered into a regression analysis 
of hospital mortality, including: (1) 
RA or 100% O2; (2) male sex; (3) 
gestation <28 weeks; (4) heart rate 
<100 beats/min at 5 minutes; and 
(5) SpO2 <80% at 5 minutes. Analyses 
were considered significant at 
P < .05; no adjustments were made 
for multiple comparisons, and 
missing data were not imputed.
Interim Analysis and Stopping 
Guidelines
A difference of at least 3 SDs 
in a major endpoint (or in a 
combination of major end points) 
suggesting net clinical benefit or 
harm was considered by the DSMC 
as justification to stop the study 
prematurely or to increase the 
frequency of trial monitoring or to 
instigate modification of trial design. 
The DSMC planned to review interim

Ethics Approval and Trial 
Registration
The study was approved by 
the following: the South Easy 
Sydney Human Research Ethics 
Committee (06/065), the Hunter 
New England Ethics Committee 
(09/08/18/5.07) as the principal 
Australian site; the University of 
Malaya Ethics Committee (601.17); 
the Ministry of Health, Malaysia; 
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia 
Committee (1.5.3.5/244/SPP3); and 
the Hamad Medical Corporation, 
Qatar.
RESULTS
After review by the DSMC, new 
recruitment was ceased in June 
2014 due to difficulties in meeting 
target recruitment rates. Of 6291 
eligible patients, 292 infants were 
recruited and randomized to 
treatment between first January 
2008 and June 14, 2014. The 
most common reasons for failed 
recruitment were: precipitous 
delivery, clinician preference, and 
inability of the research team to 
attend. Two infants were withdrawn 
after consent was given, resulting 
in randomization of 290 infants 
(RA: n = 145; 100% O2: n = 145). A 
female infant (gestational age: 26.3 
weeks) randomized to the 100% O2 
arm was delivered precipitously. 
She was included in the 100% O2 
group on an intention-to-treat basis, 
but her resuscitation data were 
not included. Two infants from the 
100% O2 group (1 with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, 1 with a congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia) and 1 from 
the RA group (lung hypoplasia and 
dysplasia) were excluded after birth 
(see Exclusion Criteria and Methods), 
leaving 144 infants in the RA group 
and 143 infants in the 100% O2 group 
to be included in the final analysis 
( 
Fig 1).
Patient Demographic Characteristics
Maternal and infant characteristics 
are shown in  
Table 1. Most mothers 
were multiparous and gave birth 
via cesarean delivery. Almost all 
mothers received at least 1 dose of 
antenatal steroids, and there were 
no differences between the groups 
for significant antenatal problems or 
infant parameters. Forty-six (32%) of 
144 RA infants and 54 (38%) of 143 
100% O2 infants were <28 weeks’ 
gestation (OR: 0.8 [95% CI: 0.5–1.3]; 
P = .32).
Resuscitation Outcomes
One infant in the RA group was 
given adrenaline and cardiac 
compressions. No infant died during 
resuscitation or was asystolic. Most 
were given continuous positive 
airway pressure, and approximately 
one-third were intubated. Age at 
admission to the NICU, admission 
FIO2, and temperature did not differ 
( 
Table 2).
As shown in  
Fig 2, heart rates were 
significantly lower in the RA group 
until the third to fourth minute 
of life. SpO2 was also significantly 
lower in infants in the RA group for 
up to minute 8 of life but were not 
significantly different thereafter. 
Infants commenced on 100% O2 
had SpO2 ranges mostly within 
recommended targets, 
 
26 but RA 
infants did not meet these targets 
until minute 8 of life ( 
Fig 3). Infants 
started on 100% O2 received 
significantly more O2 until minute 
8 of life. FIO2 was not different after 
that until nursery admission 
( 
Fig 4 and Table 2). These 
differences were not significantly 
different between the groups when 
the infants were examined according 
to gestational age (ie, below or 
above 28 weeks’ gestation) 
( 
Figs 2– 
4).
Hospital Outcomes
Data for gestational subgroups 
(below or above 28 weeks’ gestation) 
are included in the Supplemental 
Materials.
Morbidities
Infants given 100% O2 required 
a significantly longer duration 
of respiratory support (defined 
as use of mandatory ventilation, 
continuous positive airway pressure, 
or high- and low-flow nasal 
cannula) compared with the RA 
group. There was no difference in 
prespecified morbidities, including 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ROP, 
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 
intraventricular hemorrhage, or 
necrotizing enterocolitis (Table 3). 
Infants in the 100% O2 group were 
more likely to require surgery, 
predominantly for conditions 
occurring after the first few days of 
life (eg, hernia repair and for PDA 
ligation).
Death
Death before 28 days of age (neonatal 
death) or death before hospital 
discharge was not significantly 
different for all infants. However, 
10 (22%) of the infants <28 weeks’ 
gestation in the RA group died before

hospital discharge, compared with 
3 (6%) infants given 100% O2 (risk 
ratio: 3.9 [95% CI: 1.1–13.4]; P = .01). 
The most common cause of death was 
respiratory failure (n = 13). Infants 
in the RA group died slightly later 
(median: 12 days; range: 2–95 days) 
than infants on 100% O2 (median: 5 
days; range: 1–83 days). One infant 
<28 weeks’ gestation from the 100% 
O2 group died of sudden infant death 
syndrome 3 months after hospital 
discharge. No other child has died 
since hospital discharge (Table 4).
Regression Analysis
Regression analysis showed that 
both failure to meet target SpO2 by 
5 minutes and gestation <28 weeks 
were significantly associated with the 
risk of death (adjusted odds ratios: 
4.1 and 4.8, respectively) (Table 5); 
100% O2, male sex, or low (<100 
beats/min) 5-minute heart rate were 
not significant associations for death 
(model: B, 2.53; SE, 0.23; df = 1; Exp 
[B] = 0.08).
DISCUSSION
This study was the largest single 
randomized trial to examine 
outcomes of very preterm infants 
after delivery room resuscitation 
was initiated with either lower RA 
or higher (100%) O2. We emphasize 
that this study was underpowered 
due to recruitment difficulties 
associated with the lack of equipoise 
for using 100% O2. 
24 
– 
26 On the 
advice of the DSMC, we stopped 
recruitment in June 2014 but 
published short-term outcomes 
because the results would represent 
the single biggest contribution 
to any meta-analysis, the highest 
level of current evidence. The 
contribution of To2rpido data to a 
meta-analysis of 504 infants <28 
weeks’ gestation shows that lower 
(≤30%) or higher (≥60%) O2 (risk 
ratio: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.52–1.91]) 
resuscitation makes no difference 
to hospital mortality 
35 despite 
current clinical preference to use 
lower FIO2.
31
We emphasize that recruitment for 
this study was not stopped because 
of the unexpected finding of a 3-fold 
increase in deaths in infants <28 
weeks’ gestation who were initially 
given RA. These infants were 
already at a high risk of death 
compared with more mature infants, 
and the precise etiology of death 
cannot be ascertained from this 
small group. The results were not 
prespecified and due to the small 
sample size, a change in just 1 death

in either group would have resulted 
in very different outcomes. The 
results should be considered only as 
hypothesis-generating.
Our secondary results suggest 
possible differences in outcomes 
for survivors. RA infants needed 
less time on supplemental O2 and 
respiratory support. This scenario 
was noted previously by Vento 
et al 
15 and may be due to decreased 
oxidative injury. 
5, 
 
6, 
 
16 Infants on 
100% O2 needed more surgery, but 
the cause for this requirement is 
speculative due to the heterogeneous 
nature of the surgeries. Some 
surgeries (eg, hernia repairs) can 
only be performed if the infant 
survives, although others (eg, ROP 
and PDA ligation) have been linked 
to high O2 exposure. High O2 levels, 
for example, increase free radical 
production and prostaglandin E2 
expression, a ductal relaxant.36 
The associations between lower 
O2 resuscitation and a decreased 
rate of PDA were also noted in a 
retrospective population study by 
Rabi et al. 
37
The present study was designed 
before publication of SpO2 
target recommendations in 
expert guidelines. 
26, 
 
27 Despite 
widespread acceptance of 
these recommendations, 
 
31 
the implications of these 
trajectories for preterm infants 
are unclear. The International 
Consensus on Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation of 2015 makes no 
SpO2 target recommendations in 
its resuscitation algorithm. 
27 Low 
SpO2 may not result in immediate 
apparent harm, but hypoxia might 
lead to delayed cellular damage. 
In animal studies, hypoxia is 
associated with delayed death, 
apoptosis, and irreversible cellular 
degeneration.38 In our study, death 
occurred slightly later in infants 
given RA (12 vs 4 days) but again, 
this outcome needs to be verified in 
larger studies.
A retrospective population study 
by Rabi et al 
37 of 2326 infants ≤27 
weeks’ gestation from Canadian 
NICU units supports the need for 
more evidence before lower O2 
resuscitation can be universally 
recommended. After changes 
to the Canadian resuscitation 
guidelines from 100% O2 to RA or 
lower O2, infants after the change 
(n = 1244) were more likely to die 
or have severe neurologic injury 
(adjusted odds ratio: 1.36 [95% 
CI: 1.11–1.66]) than those born 
before the guideline change (n = 
1082). 
39 The researchers noted that 
they did not have data regarding 
individual O2 exposure, and it would 
be misleading to attribute major

There are limitations to our study. 
Due to difficulties in recruiting, the 
study was stopped prematurely and 
is significantly underpowered for 
the primary outcome. Furthermore, 
ethics committees did not allow 
either blinding or consent waiver. 
Personnel who are not involved in 
clinical care may be able to respond 
to SpO2 changes more promptly, and 
the difference is demonstrated in a 
meta-analysis which showed that 
masked studies had lower mortality 
rates in the lower O2 arms. 
35 
Parental consent may also take time 
and exclude the sickest infants. 
40 
Finally, the study was conducted 
over a long period when clinical 
practice undoubtedly changed, with 
clinicians most likely becoming 
more adept at SpO2 targeting and 
FIO2 blending. 
31 Whether this 
factor has an effect on outcomes is 
uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study must be 
interpreted with caution due to 
its small sample size. However, it 
remains the largest randomized 
controlled trial to date. Our non-
prespecified but potentially 
concerning finding of increased 
hospital death in infants 
<28 weeks’ gestation resuscitated 
with RA emphasizes the critical 
need to urgently examine this 
knowledge gap further with 
large and well-designed trials. 
Failure to do so could lead to 
irreversible harm to thousands of 
preterm infants around the world 
every year.
