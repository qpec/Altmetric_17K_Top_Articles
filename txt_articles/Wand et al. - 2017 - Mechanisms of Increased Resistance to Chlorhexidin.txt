ABSTRACT Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that is often difficult
to treat due to its multidrug resistance (MDR). We have previously shown that K.
pneumoniae strains are able to “adapt” (become more resistant) to the widely used
bisbiguanide antiseptic chlorhexidine. Here, we investigated the mechanisms respon-
sible for and the phenotypic consequences of chlorhexidine adaptation, with partic-
ular reference to antibiotic cross-resistance. In five of six strains, adaptation to chlo-
rhexidine also led to resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin. Here, we show
that chlorhexidine adaptation is associated with mutations in the two-component
regulator phoPQ and a putative Tet repressor gene (smvR) adjacent to the major fa-
cilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump gene, smvA. Upregulation of smvA (10- to 27-
fold) was confirmed in smvR mutant strains, and this effect and the associated phe-
notype were suppressed when a wild-type copy of smvR was introduced on plasmid
pACYC. Upregulation of phoPQ (5- to 15-fold) and phoPQ-regulated genes, pmrD (6-
to 19-fold) and pmrK (18- to 64-fold), was confirmed in phoPQ mutant strains. In
contrast, adaptation of K. pneumoniae to colistin did not result in increased chlo-
rhexidine resistance despite the presence of mutations in phoQ and elevated phoPQ,
pmrD, and pmrK transcript levels. Insertion of a plasmid containing phoPQ from
chlorhexidine-adapted strains into wild-type K. pneumoniae resulted in elevated ex-
pression levels of phoPQ, pmrD, and pmrK and increased resistance to colistin, but
not chlorhexidine. The potential risk of colistin resistance emerging in K. pneumoniae
as a consequence of exposure to chlorhexidine has important clinical implications
for infection prevention procedures.

T
he emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens poses a significant chal-
lenge to health care delivery. Gram-negative pathogens, including Klebsiella pneu-
moniae, from the so-called “ESKAPEE” group are of particular concern due to their high
levels of antibiotic resistance. The emergence and rapid dissemination of particular
strains of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriacae (1, 2) has caused an overreliance
on last-resort antibiotics, e.g., colistin (CST). It has also highlighted the need for
infection control to support clinical practice by reducing the potential for establishment
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
A range of disinfectants and antiseptics are commonly used in clinical practice and
underpin current health care. There is ongoing debate about the presence or emer-
gence of resistance to biocides in clinical populations and the potential for this to
translate into cross-resistance to antibiotics. There are relatively few examples where
this has been identified and fewer still where there is strong evidence for its happening

 in the clinic (3, 4). While resistance to many biocides has been reported for multiple
organisms, there is a distinct lack of understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
the resistance.
Chlorhexidine is a bisbiguanide antiseptic that is cationic in nature and functions by
membrane disruption (5). It forms a bridge between pairs of adjacent phospholipid
headgroups and displaces the associated divalent cations (Mg2� and Ca2�) (6). This
results in a reduction of membrane fluidity and osmoregulation, as well as changes in
the metabolic capability of the cell membrane-associated enzymes (7). At higher
concentrations, the interaction between chlorhexidine and the cellular membrane
causes the membrane to lose its structural integrity and adopt a liquid crystalline state,
which leads to a rapid loss of cellular contents (8).
A review of products containing chlorhexidine that are commonly sold to the
National Health Service (NHS) in England, identified a wide range of active concentra-
tions of chlorhexidine, ranging from 0.02% in catheter maintenance solutions through
0.2% for mouthwash, 0.5% in chlorhexidine-impregnated wound dressings, and 2 and
4% (often in alcohol) solutions for skin antisepsis. Therefore, the potential for exposed
bacteria to develop resistance to chlorhexidine is increased due to the variable selec-
tion pressure. Increased bacterial chlorhexidine resistance has implications for a wide
range of applications, including treatment of wounds.
In this study, we investigated whether adaptation of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates
to chlorhexidine caused cross-resistance to other biocides and antibiotics and whether
the adapted strains maintained fitness and virulence. The underlying mechanisms of
increased resistance to chlorhexidine in K. pneumoniae were also investigated, partic-
ularly in connection with the observed cross-resistance to colistin.
RESULTS
Phenotypic assessment of K. pneumoniae isolates following chlorhexidine ad-
aptation. Previous work has shown that K. pneumoniae strains are able to adapt to
increasing concentrations of chlorhexidine, and this leads to increased MIC/MBC (min-
imum bactericidal concentration) levels of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD) and
chlorhexidine-containing clinical products (9). To determine whether adaptation to
chlorhexidine also led to development of increased resistance to other antiseptics and
cross-resistance to frontline antibiotics, the MICs of a range of biocides for wild-type
(WT) and chlorhexidine-adapted (CA) strains were determined (Table 1). Following
chlorhexidine adaptation, MIC values for colistin increased from 2 to 4 mg/liter to �64
mg/liter in five out of the six strains. The only strain that did not show increased
resistance to colistin following chlorhexidine adaptation was M109 CA. The strain also

aThe disinfectants used were chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), benzalkonium chloride (BCl), octenidine dihydrochloride (Oct), hexadecylpyridinium chloride
monohydrate (HDPCM), and ethanol (EtOH). The antibiotics used were CST, AZM, FEP, and TEC. All the MICs are shown as ranges of the results of at least three
independent experiments. “� CCCP” indicates the addition of the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. Additional antibiotics are shown
in Table S2 in the supplemental material.

 had the lowest MIC for chlorhexidine (32 mg/liter compared to a range between 128
and 512 mg/liter for the other strains). Resistance to colistin is often accompanied by
changes in membrane composition, which can be detected by altered MIC values of
azithromycin (AZM), teicoplanin (TEC), and cefepime (FEP). Apart from MGH 78578 CA,
where the MIC of cefepime changed from �64 mg/liter to 0.5 mg/liter following
chlorhexidine exposure, no significant differences were observed. For other antibiotics
tested, there was also no general change in susceptibility, although there were indi-
vidual strain differences, e.g., for strain NCTC 13443 there was a significant reduction in
the MIC values of meropenem and chloramphenicol after chlorhexidine adaptation (see
Table S2 in the supplemental material). There was also no significant change (�2-fold)
in MIC values of other antiseptics after chlorhexidine adaptation for any of the strains
tested.
Due to increased disinfectant/antiseptic resistance often being associated with
increased efflux, the MICs for chlorhexidine were retested in the presence of the known
efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and
phenylalanine-arginine-�-naphthylamide (Pa�N). In all of the WT strains, the addition of
CCCP gave a significant reduction in the MIC, with values reduced from between 8 and
32 mg/liter to between 0.5 and 4 mg/liter (8- to 16-fold reductions). The addition of
CCCP also reduced the MIC of chlorhexidine in all of the chlorhexidine-adapted strains,
with an MIC reduction of between 32-fold (M109 CA) and 256- to 512-fold (MGH 78578
CA and NCTC 13443 CA). In each case, the MICs of the WT and chlorhexidine-adapted
strains, in the presence of CCCP, were either identical or within a 2-fold dilution (Table
1). The addition of CCCP also increased susceptibility to colistin in both chlorhexidine-
adapted and WT strains. For Pa�N, no reduction was seen in the MIC for the WT or
chlorhexidine-adapted strain (data not shown).
The fitness of strains following chlorhexidine adaptation was assessed. Following
chlorhexidine adaptation, virulence in the wax moth (Galleria mellonella) was reduced
in several strains (NCTC 13443 CA, MGH 78578 CA, M109 CA, and NCTC 13368 CA), but
not in M3 CA and NCTC 13439 CA (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). To
investigate whether the observed loss of virulence was due to a growth defect, growth
curves were assessed. A reduction in the growth rate was observed for some isolates,
but it did not always correlate with loss of virulence (data not shown).
Whole-genome sequencing analysis of chlorhexidine-adapted strains. To un-
derstand what mechanisms are responsible for increased tolerance to chlorhexidine, all
the chlorhexidine-adapted strains and their respective parental counterparts were
whole-genome sequenced. Several genetic changes (both indels and nonsynonymous
single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) were identified in the chlorhexidine-adapted
strains (Table 2; see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Four out of the six strains
had nonsynonymous SNPs in the phoPQ two-component regulator system, and four
out of the six strains showed mutations in a putative Tet repressor gene (here called
smvR [regulator of smvA]) adjacent to and divergently transcribed from a putative
homologue of the methyl viologen resistance gene smvA. In three of these four strains,
a truncated Tet repressor protein was observed, either through a missense mutation
(M3 CA), deletion of the C terminus (M109 CA), or a nonsynonymous SNP leading to the
formation of a premature stop codon (NCTC 13443 CA). In the fourth strain (NCTC
13439 CA), the entire smvR gene was deleted, along with downstream sequences,
which included the nitrate extrusion protein gene (narU) and genes encoding proteins
involved in nitrate reductase (narZ and narY). In two strains (M3 CA and NCTC 13443
CA), mutations in both smvR and phoPQ were identified.
In all adapted strains, genetic changes were identified in genes in addition to phoPQ
and/or smvR. Mutations were observed in genes associated with the outer membrane
or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), e.g., lptD in NCTC 13443 CA. Strain MGH 78578 CA con-
tained a mutation in the DNA mismatch repair gene mutS, which explains the increased
frequency of mutations after chlorhexidine adaptation in the strain. Two strains also
contained alterations in the outer membrane protein MipA (MltA-interacting protein).

 All other mutations were present in only one strain out of six following chlorhexidine
adaptation. There was also evidence for plasmid loss following chlorhexidine adapta-
tion, which explains the loss of antibiotic resistance in certain strains, e.g., meropenem
in NCTC 13443 CA.
Chlorhexidine adaptation experiments were repeated independently in the same
strains, and again, mutations in smvR and phoPQ were observed (data not shown).
Therefore, since all chlorhexidine-adapted strains had mutations in phoPQ and/or smvR,
further analysis concentrated on these genes.
Role of SmvR and PhoPQ in resistance to chlorhexidine. To define the role of
smvR in increasing resistance to chlorhexidine and colistin, pACYC-184 plasmids con-
taining either the WT or the CA smvR version from NCTC 13443 and M3 (see Table 2 for
individual mutations) were introduced into strain M109 CA (which has a deletion in the
C terminus of smvR). Introduction of the wild-type version of smvR from either NCTC
13443 or M3 resulted in a decrease in the MIC values of CHD compared to the wild-type
value (from 32 to 8 mg/liter), whereas the introduction of the CA smvR from either NCTC
13443 or M3 had no effect on the MIC value of CHD (Table 3), indicating that in M109
CA, the deletion of smvR increased resistance to chlorhexidine. No change in the MIC
value of colistin was observed following introduction of either the CA or WT smvR
version from NCTC 13443 or M3 into M109 CA. To confirm the roles of smvA and smvR
in elevated resistance to chlorhexidine, we examined 10 preantibiotic era K. pneu-
moniae Murray strains that do not possess a homologue to the genes (10). These strains
were highly susceptible to chlorhexidine, with MIC values ranging from 1 to �0.5
mg/liter compared to 8 to 32 mg/liter for the 26 Murray isolates that do contain smvA
and smvR.
For phoPQ, introduction of pACYC phoPQ WT or pACYC phoQ A20P plasmids into
M109 CA showed no increase in MIC values of chlorhexidine, but the presence of
pACYC phoQ A20P increased the MIC of colistin from 2 to 64 mg/liter (Table 3). As M109
CA already had an elevated MIC for chlorhexidine, perhaps obscuring any effect of addi-
tional PhoPQ mutations, both plasmids were electroporated into wild-type M109 and
another clinical K. pneumoniae strain, 25. Again, there was no increase in the MIC values of
chlorhexidine, but there was an increase in resistance to colistin following the introduction
of pACYC phoQ A20P (from 0.5 to 1 mg/liter to 32 to 64 mg/liter) (Table 3).
Analysis of changes in gene expression following chlorhexidine adaptation. To
further understand the mechanism(s) of chlorhexidine adaptation in K. pneumoniae and
whether chlorhexidine adaptation is related to mutations in smvR and phoPQ, the
expression levels of specific genes were observed in both WT and CA strains. Besides

 smvR and phoPQ, other genes analyzed included genes known to be (in)directly
regulated by PhoPQ (pmrD, pmrK, and pagP) and smvA (Table 4).
Strains with deletions or truncations of smvR (M109 CA, NCTC 13439 CA, NCTC 13443
CA, and M3 CA) all showed upregulation in the expression of smvA (10- to 27-fold).
Strain M109 CA (which was the only strain that did not show increased colistin
resistance following chlorhexidine adaptation) showed no change in the expression
levels of phoPQ. For strains with mutations in phoPQ (NCTC 13368 CA, MGH 78578 CA,
M3 CA, and NCTC 13443 CA), significant upregulation of phoP (5- to 15-fold), phoQ (5-
to 9-fold), pmrK (18- to 64-fold), and pmrD (6- to 19-fold) was observed. Interestingly,
one strain (NCTC 13439 CA) did show upregulation of pmrD (3-fold) and pmrK (12-fold)
despite there being no upregulation of phoPQ expression. Strains with mutations in
PhoPQ, but not smvR (NCTC 13368 CA and MGH 78578 CA), had unaltered expression
levels of smvR and smvA following chlorhexidine adaptation. Strains with mutations in
both phoPQ and smvR had upregulated pagP expression (2- to 7-fold); no upregulation
of pagP was seen in strains with mutations in only phoPQ or smvR.
The expression levels of genes (phoP, phoQ, pmrD, pmrK, pagP, smvA, and smvR) were
assessed in strain M109 with pACYC phoQ A20P or pACYC phoPQ WT. There was slight
upregulation in phoQ (3-fold) and elevated levels of pmrK (7-fold), pmrD (2-fold), and pagP
(4-fold) when pACYC phoQ A20P was present versus pACYC phoPQ WT (Table 4).
Adaptation to colistin does not lead to an increase in resistance to chlorhexi-
dine. Since adaptation to chlorhexidine has been shown to lead to development of
colistin resistance, we wanted to understand if the reverse was true. When K. pneu-
moniae strains were adapted to colistin (here called CST strains), the MIC values for
colistin increased (from 1 to 2 mg/liter to 64 to �64 mg/liter), but the susceptibility to
chlorhexidine remained the same as that of preexposure strains (Table 4). When
whole-genome analysis was carried out on these isolates, strain M3 CST was shown to
have a mutation (PhoQ L348Q) identical to that found in strain MGH 78578 CA and no
other mutations.
To understand whether colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae strains had phoPQ expres-
sion profiles similar to those of chlorhexidine-adapted strains, we analyzed four strains
with different colistin resistance mutations: strains 16 CST (PhoQ T244N), M3 CST (PhoQ
L348Q), 51851 (ΔmgrB), and NCTC 13438 CST (PmrB D150Y). All of the strains had CST
MIC values of 64 mg/liter and CHD MIC values of 16 to 32 mg/liter. Transcriptional
analysis showed that these strains had elevated levels of pmrK (20- to 60-fold) and, with
the exception of 13438 CST, elevated levels of phoP (5- to 10-fold), phoQ (4- to 9-fold),
pmrD (5- to 11-fold), and pagP (4- to 7-fold). Strains that had mutations in phoQ had
very similar elevated expression levels compared to chlorhexidine-adapted strains
containing mutations in phoP or phoQ (Table 4).

 DISCUSSION
This study has shown that adaptation of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates to chlorhexi-
dine exposure can lead to not only stable resistance to chlorhexidine, but also cross-
resistance to colistin. This has important clinical implications for the treatment of
infections by and outbreaks of MDR (particularly carbapenem-resistant) K. pneumoniae
isolates, given their increasing prevalence in hospitals (11). Many carbapenem-resistant
K. pneumoniae isolates are susceptible to very few antibiotics, notably, colistin; treat-
ment often involves combination therapy including colistin (12). Therefore, any poten-
tial loss of colistin efficacy has implications for treatment of these infections. While
chlorhexidine has been successfully used as part of a multifaceted intervention to
reduce the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in hospitals (13), the
observation that exposure to chlorhexidine leads to colistin resistance means that
eradication of potentially colistin- and carbapenem-resistant isolates is very problem-
atic. Since the isolates have also acquired increased resistance to chlorhexidine, this
also makes prevention of colonization with the isolates more difficult, which has the
potential to either prolong existing outbreaks or lead to new outbreaks.
Genome analysis of chlorhexidine-adapted strains identified mutations in phoPQ
and/or smvR. SmvR is a putative Tet repressor family protein encoded by a gene that
is adjacent to and transcribed divergently from the smvA gene. Adaptation to chlo-
rhexidine resulted in disruption of smvR by either complete deletion or production of
a truncated version. SmvA is an efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS)
and has been implicated in methyl viologen resistance and the efflux of acriflavine and
other quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in Salmomella enterica serovar Typhi-
murium (14, 15). Upregulation of smvA was confirmed in all the strains with nonfunc-
tional SmvR, suggesting that SmvR acts as a repressor of smvA and that increased
expression of smvA leads to increased chlorhexidine resistance. Divergent expression
from the same promoter is commonly observed in genes that are negatively regulated
by Tet repressors (16). Examples of TetR homologues involved in resistance to biocides
are QacR in Staphylococcus aureus and EnvR and NemR in Escherichia coli (17–19).
The observation that K. pneumoniae (Murray) isolates, which do not possess homo-
logues to smvA and smvR, are highly susceptible to chlorhexidine again suggests that
smvA is an important efflux pump in chlorhexidine resistance. E. coli does not possess
a homologue to smvA and is significantly more susceptible than Klebsiella to chlorhexi-
dine (20). However, potential homologues of smvA and smvR are found in most species
of Enterobacteriaceae, as well as other Gram-negative MDR pathogens, e.g., Pseudomo-
nas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. This potentially means that SmvA homo-
logues mediate reduced susceptibility to polycationic antiseptics in other bacteria and
that a similar mechanism of adaptation, with deletion of smvR, may be observed in
other clinically important pathogens. In A. baumannii, deletion of another Tet repressor
(adeN) that is adjacent to an efflux pump operon (adeIJK) resulted in acquisition of
increased resistance to triclosan (21).
The addition of the EPI CCCP increased susceptibility to chlorhexidine in both the
wild-type and chlorhexidine-adapted strains, suggesting that efflux pumps known to
be affected by the uncoupling agent, including MFS-type pumps, such as smvA, might
be involved. In colistin-resistant chlorhexidine-adapted strains, CCCP also increased
susceptibility to colistin. This is consistent with other studies suggesting a role for efflux
in colistin resistance in a range of Gram-negative pathogens (22). CCCP, due to its
function as a general uncoupler of proton motive force, may affect metabolic activity,
which has been linked to increased susceptibility to colistin in A. baumannii (23) and
chlorhexidine in P. aeruginosa (24). Indeed, growth of both the WT and CA strains was
diminished following the addition of CCCP.
The cross-resistance to colistin following chlorhexidine adaptation is likely due to
upregulation of the operon containing pmrK. This operon functions to modify LPS by
cationic replacement of the phosphate groups with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-
Ara4N). This reduces the lipid A net negative charge and causes a reduction in the

 binding affinity of colistin (25). PhoPQ has been linked to modification of LPS and the
outer membrane content (26–28) and regulates genes involved in colistin resistance,
including pmrD and pmrAB (29, 30). Mutations in PhoPQ in K. pneumoniae have already
been shown to be associated with colistin and cationic peptide resistance and with lipid
A modification (29, 31–33). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of strains with phoPQ
mutations showed significant upregulation in the expression levels of phoPQ (at least
5-fold). For these strains, genes regulated directly or indirectly by phoPQ (pmrD and
pmrK) were also upregulated. This upregulation was consistent for K. pneumoniae
strains that are resistant to both colistin and chlorhexidine or colistin alone. However,
there are examples of mutations in PhoQ leading to elevated phoPQ expression, but not
development of colistin resistance (34). In this study, one chlorhexidine-adapted strain
(NCTC 13439 CA) had elevated colistin resistance but no detected mutations in phoPQ
and did not show upregulation of their expression. However, the strain did have
upregulated pmrD and pmrK expression levels, which suggested that the genes were
activated independently of phoPQ. The expression levels of pmrK are regulated by
another two-component regulator implicated in colistin resistance, pmrAB. While ex-
pression levels of pmrAB may be regulated by PhoPQ (through PmrD), pmrAB is also
transcribed, independently of PhoPQ, from a constitutive promoter within the up-
stream pagB gene (26). Expression of pmrD may be subject to regulation by a second,
unknown system based on the observation that in E. coli expression of pmrD was not
abolished following inactivation of phoPQ (35). In K. pneumoniae, upregulation of pmrD
following adaptation to colistin was not always linked to upregulation of phoQ (36). The
presence of a mutation in the RarA regulator in NCTC 13439 CA is consistent with
upregulation of rarA in K. pneumoniae enhancing growth on polymyxin B (37). The
mutated amino acid (W37R) is predicted to directly interact with DNA, according to the
crystal structure of the related regulator MarA (38).
The results demonstrate that PhoPQ mutations arise through chlorhexidine adap-
tation and can be clearly linked to colistin resistance. However, the data suggest that
additional factors are important in mediating resistance to chlorhexidine, and they may
operate independently of PhoPQ. qPCR analysis using colistin-adapted strains with
specific mutations in PhoQ (T244N and L348Q) showed levels of phoPQ expression very
similar to those of chlorhexidine-adapted strains containing PhoPQ mutations (NCTC
13368 CA, NCTC 13443 CA, M3 CA, and MGH 78578 CA), suggesting that increased
levels of phoPQ, pmrD, and pmrK expression, while important for colistin resistance, are
not sufficient for increased resistance to chlorhexidine. This observation was reinforced
by colistin resistance, but not chlorhexidine resistance, being transferred on pACYC
phoQ A20P, which again caused upregulation of phoQ, pmrD, and pmrK relative to
pACYC phoPQ WT. Identical PhoQ mutations (L348Q) were present in both strains M3
CST and MGH 78578 CA, suggesting that this mutation alone is not sufficient to lead to
increased chlorhexidine resistance but is enough to generate colistin resistance. Inter-
estingly, upregulated pagP expression was observed in colistin-adapted strains where
upregulated phoPQ expression was also observed (KP16 CST, M3 CST, and 51851). For
chlorhexidine-adapted strains, those with mutations in phoPQ but not smvR showed no
pagP upregulation. pagP expression does not appear to be dependent upon specific
allelic changes, since both MGH 78578 CA and M3 CST have mutations in phoQ (L348Q),
but only M3 CST showed upregulated pagP expression. These observations could imply
that upregulated pagP expression is antagonistic to chlorhexidine resistance. M3 CA
and NCTC 13443 CA have elevated pagP levels but also have mutations in smvR, in
addition to mutations in phoPQ. We have demonstrated that smvR has a role in
chlorhexidine resistance, and it is plausible that mutations in smvR “mask” any negative
effects on chlorhexidine resistance caused by elevated pagP expression. PagP causes
palmitoylation of lipid A, which has been found not to contribute to colistin resistance
in other pathogens (39), but its role in chlorhexidine resistance has not been investi-
gated. It is possible that increased palmitoylation of lipid A reduces the frequency of
other lipid A modifications that are important in chlorhexidine resistance. Future work

 will focus on understanding the role of lipid A modification in chlorhexidine resistance,
including the roles of PhoPQ, PagP, and MarA.
It is also plausible that mutations in phoPQ are secondary-site or compensatory
mutations that enable the resistant strain to recover its fitness and virulence following
the initial development of biocide resistance (40). PhoPQ is a global regulator and
regulates a number of genes important in fitness and virulence (41–43). Again, further
work is needed to investigate this.
Overall, this study has identified a novel mechanism of resistance to chlorhexidine
(smvA-smvR) that may potentially operate in a number of different species. Clearly,
increased smvA expression is important for chlorhexidine adaptation in K. pneumoniae,
but it is not the only mechanism and may operate in conjunction with other regulatory
processes. Chlorhexidine adaptation is also associated with the generation of mutations
in PhoPQ that affect a number of known regulatory targets (notably, pmrD and pmrK).
Upregulation of these genes also correlates with the presence of colistin resistance. The
fact that increased colistin and chlorhexidine resistance may occur in clinical isolates
without significant loss of fitness/virulence highlights the potential challenges associ-
ated with critical infection control procedures and the use of chlorhexidine as an
antiseptic to control health care-associated infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and culture conditions. The K. pneumoniae isolates used in this study are clinical
strains with a variety of antibiotic resistance markers, e.g., blaNDM-1 and blaSHV-18, and have been
described previously (9, 10, 44). K. pneumoniae was adapted to chlorhexidine as described in a previous
study (9). Additional experiments in adaptation to chlorhexidine or colistin were also performed. Briefly,
strains were cultured at quarter MICs of chlorhexidine or colistin and passaged every 2 days into fresh
medium containing double the previous concentration of chlorhexidine/colistin. This continued for six
passages. Stability was measured by passaging the strains 10 times in the absence of selective pressure
(chlorhexidine/colistin). All the strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) with aeration on tryptic soy
agar (TSA) plates at 37°
C unless otherwise stated. Chlorhexidine digluconate (Sigma) was used through-
out and was diluted in sterile water unless otherwise stated.
Determination of MIC/MBC. The MICs of various antibiotics and disinfectants/antiseptics for K.
pneumoniae isolates were determined using a broth microdilution method with a starting inoculum
of 1 � 105 CFU/ml. The optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured after 20 h of static
incubation at 37°
C, and the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic/disinfectant
at which no bacterial growth was observed. A change in the MIC was considered significant if at least
a 4-fold increase/decrease was observed in three replicate experiments. The EPIs Pa�N and CCCP
were added at concentrations of 25 and 10 mg/liter, respectively, where required. For MBC testing,
10 �l of suspension was removed from each well of the MIC microtiter plate where no bacterial
growth was observed, along with the two wells immediately below the MIC where growth was
observed. These were spotted on TSA plates and incubated at 37°
C for 24 h. The MBC was defined
as the lowest concentration of antibiotic/disinfectant at which no bacterial growth was observed in
three replicate experiments.
G. mellonella killing assays. Wax moth (G. mellonella) larvae were purchased from Livefood UK Ltd.
(Rooks Bridge, Somerset, United Kingdom) and were maintained on wood chips in the dark at 14°
C. They
were stored for not longer than 2 weeks. Bacterial infection of G. mellonella was performed essentially
as described by Wand et al. (45). The data were analyzed by the Mantel-Cox method using Prism software
version 6 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
Whole-genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae strains. Genomic DNA was purified using a Wizard
genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). DNA was tagged and multiplexed with the Nextera XT DNA kit
(Illumina). Whole-genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae isolates was performed by PHE-GSDU (Public
Health England Genomic Services and Development Unit) on an Illumina (HiSeq 2500) with paired-end
read lengths of 150 bp. A minimum 150 Mb of Q30 quality data were obtained for each isolate. FastQ
files were quality trimmed using Trimmomatic (46). SPAdes 3.1.1 was used to produce draft chromosomal
assemblies, and contigs of less than 1 kb were filtered out (47). FastQ reads from chlorhexidine-exposed
isolates were subsequently mapped to their respective wild-type preexposure chromosomal sequence
using BWA 0.7.5 (48). Bam format files were generated using Samtools (49), and VCF files were
constructed using GATK2 Unified Genotyper (version 0.0.7) (50). They were further filtered using the
following filtering criteria to identify high-confidence SNPs: mapping quality, �30; genotype quality,
�40; variant ratio, �0.9; read depth, �10. All the above-described sequencing analyses were performed
using PHE Galaxy (51). BAM files were visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) version 2.3.55
(Broad Institute). Changes in phoPQ and smvR regions were verified using Sanger sequencing (Beckmann
Genomics, Takeley, United Kingdom) and analyzed using DNAStar Lasergene 10.
Plasmid complementation in K. pneumoniae. phoPQ and smvR genes from both wild-type and
chlorhexidine-adapted strains were amplified using primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental
material. They were digested with ClaI and XbaI and ligated into the pACYC-184 cloning vector (NEB).

 Plasmids were checked for correct sequence using Sanger sequencing. The resultant plasmids were
electroporated into K. pneumoniae strains using a MicroPulser (Bio-Rad) and the following settings: 2.5
kV, 25 �F, 200 �, and a 0.2-mm-gap cuvette. Subsequent plasmid insertion was tested using the primers
pACYC seqF (CGTTTTCAGAGCAAGAGATTAC) and pACYC seqR (GCATTGTTAGATTTCATACACG).
Quantitative PCR. qPCR was used to measure the expression of phoP, phoQ, pmrD, pmrK, pagP,
smvR, and smvA in the chlorhexidine-adapted and respective WT strains using primers listed in Table S1
in the supplemental material. Triplicate overnight cultures grown in TSB were back diluted to an OD600
of 0.1, harvested using RNA protect bacteria reagent (Qiagen) at mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5), and RNA
extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), including on-column DNase treatment according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, 5 �g RNA was treated with a DNA-free kit (Ambion), of which 0.2
�g RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was carried out in at least triplicate on
each sample using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system and Fast SYBR green master mix (Life Technol-
ogies). Data were analysed using Expression Suite Software version 1.0.3 (Life Technologies) using gapA,
rpoB, and infB as endogenous controls and taking primer efficiency into account.
