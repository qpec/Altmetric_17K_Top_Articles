 INTRODUCTION
The Institute for Healthcare Improvement 
has 
developed 
a 
Triple 
Aim 
framework 
to 
help 
healthcare systems optimise performance; 
along with improving population health and 
reducing per-capita costs, the other main 
aim to be pursued is improving the patient 
experience.1 Patient experience of primary 
care could be particularly important to 
this aim,2 especially in countries such as 
England, where general practices are a first 
point of contact and coordinate care within 
the system. 
In 2007, the UK Department of Health 
introduced a national survey — the General 
Practice Patient Survey (GPPS) — to 
ascertain patients’ experiences of general 
practice.3 The GPPS is a quantitative postal 
survey conducted annually for the English 
NHS. Patients aged at least 18 years 
who have valid NHS numbers and have 
been registered with a general practice 
continuously for the previous 6 months 
are eligible for sampling. The GPPS 
includes all practices with eligible patients. 
Questionnaires are sent to random samples 
of eligible patients in each practice, stratified 
by age group, sex, and practice. Survey 
measures are included in England’s NHS 
Outcomes Framework.4
Since 2010, the three most recent UK 
governments have each pledged to improve 
access to general practice services in 
their election manifestos.5–7 This became 
a particularly high-profile and contentious 
area of healthcare policy around the 2015 
general election,8 when politicians stated 
that, by 2020, everyone in England will 
be able to see a GP 7 days a week, from 
8am until 8pm. This was opposed by the 
Royal College of General Practitioners 
due to resource constraints and a lack of 
evidence around the benefits to patients, for 
example.9 The NHS now has a government 
mandate to ensure that ‘100% of population 
has access to weekend/evening routine GP 
appointments’ by 2020.10
Several national policies have been 
introduced to help progress towards 
this goal. The GP Access Fund provided 
£175 million to around 2560 general 
practices (out of approximately 8000) to 
implement interventions that may improve 
access.11 Schemes focused on providing 
additional appointments in the evenings and 
at weekends in particular, often by working 
in groups or establishing dedicated centres 
with longer opening hours.12 Previously, 
most practices offered appointments 
between 8am and 6.30pm from Monday 
to Friday only.13 Practices are now 
contractually obliged to report their opening 
times to national NHS organisations, and 
commissioners receive extra payments for 
providing good experiences of access, as 
measured by the GPPS.14
Satisfaction with opening hours and 
patient experience of access to general 
practice decreased across several GPPS 
measures from 2011 to 2015, as did overall 
Research
Abstract
Background
The UK government aims to improve the 
accessibility of general practices in England, 
particularly by extending opening hours in the 
evenings and at weekends. It is unclear how 
important these factors are to patients’ overall 
experiences of general practice.
Aim
To examine associations between overall 
experience of general practice and patient 
experience of making appointments and 
satisfaction with opening hours.
Design and setting
Analysis of repeated cross-sectional data from 
the General Practice Patient Surveys conducted 
from 2011–2012 until 2013–2014. These covered 
8289 general practice surgeries in England. 
Method
Data from a national survey conducted 
three times over consecutive years were 
analysed. The outcome measure was overall 
experience, rated on a five-level interval scale. 
Associations were estimated as standardised 
regression coefficients, adjusted for responder 
characteristics and clustering within practices 
using multilevel linear regression.
Results
In total, there were 2 912 535 responders from 
all practices in England (n = 8289). Experience of 
making appointments (β 0.24, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.25) and satisfaction 
with opening hours (β 0.15, 95% CI = 0.15 to 
0.16) were modestly associated with overall 
experience. Overall experience was most strongly 
associated with GP interpersonal quality of care 
(β 0.34, 95% CI = 0.34 to 0.35) and receptionist 
helpfulness was positively associated with overall 
experience (β 0.16, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.17). Other 
patient experience measures had minimal 
associations (β≤0.06). Models explained ≥90% of 
variation in overall experience between practices.
Conclusion
Patient experience of making appointments 
and satisfaction with opening hours were only 
modestly associated with overall experience. 
Policymakers in England should not assume 
that recent policies to improve access will 
result in large improvements in patients’ overall 
experience of general practice.

 experiences,8,15 and the UK Secretary of 
State for Health has referred to these 
trends when explaining policies.16 However, 
it remains unclear how important these 
factors are to patients’ overall experiences 
relative to other aspects of general practice.
Responder-level data from the GPPS 
were analysed to examine associations 
between overall experiences of general 
practice and other patient experience 
measures. This study focused on measures 
relevant to government policy to improve 
access to general practice in England, 
particularly satisfaction with opening hours 
and experiences of making appointments.
METHOD
A regression analysis of repeated cross-
sectional data from the GPPSs carried out 
in 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014 
was conducted. In these years, 2 912 535 
patients from 8289 practices responded 
to the survey (35.8% of 8 134 705 
questionnaires sent).17–19 The mean number 
of responses per practice per year was 119 
(standard deviation [SD] 23). All responders 
were included in the analysis.
Patient experience measures
The outcome measure was overall 
experience of general practice, as defined 
by responses to the question: ‘Overall, how 
would you describe your experience of your 
GP surgery?’ The five response options 
were: ‘very good’, ‘fairly good’, ‘neither good 
nor poor’, ‘fairly poor’, and ‘very poor’. These 
response options were treated as lying on a 
five-level interval scale, in line with previous 
research.20–22
The two main explanatory variables of 
interest were: 
• experience of making an appointment 
(‘Overall, how would you describe your 
experience of making an appointment?’); 
and 
• satisfaction with opening hours (‘How 
satisfied are you with the hours that your 
GP surgery is open?’). 
Questions had five response options: 
experience of making an appointment 
was recorded as ‘very good’ to ‘very 
poor’; satisfaction with opening hours 
was recorded as ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very 
dissatisfied’ (further information is available 
from the authors on request). Again, these 
responses were treated as lying on interval 
scales. There was a focus on these variables 
to address national policy to improve access 
to, and extend opening hours in, general 
practice.8,23
The authors selected other patient 
experience measures that should be used as 
explanatory variables based on the results 
of Paddison et al;24 the measures included 
in Paddison et al’s analysis explained 92% 
of variation in overall satisfaction between 
practices after accounting for responder 
characteristics. In the study presented here, 
a measure of GP interpersonal quality of 
care was calculated from five questions that 
related to GPs: 
• giving patients enough time; 
• listening;
• explaining tests and treatments; 
• involving patients in decision making; and 
• treating patients with care (further 
information is available from the authors 
on request).
Each question had five response options 
ranging from ‘very good’ to ‘very poor’, 
which were coded on an interval scale. 
A summary measure of GP interpersonal 
quality of care was generated as the mean 
value of responses for those participants 
who answered three or more of the five 
relevant questions.24–26 A similar measure 
of nurse interpersonal quality of care was 
generated with the same methods, but 
through use of questions about nurses 
(further information is available from the 
authors on request). Previously published 
factor analyses of the five questions suggest 
that they measure one construct each for 
GP interpersonal quality of care and nurse 
interpersonal quality of care.3,27
The authors analysed measures of how 
easy it was to contact general practices 
by telephone (ranging from ‘very easy’ to 
‘not at all easy’) and the helpfulness of 
receptionists (‘very helpful’ to ‘not at all 
helpful’) on four-level interval scales (further 
information is available from the authors on 
request). In addition, they assessed whether 
How this fits in
The importance of patient experience of 
making appointments and satisfaction 
with opening hours to overall experience 
of general practice was unknown. This 
study suggests that these two variables 
are only modestly associated with overall 
experience. National policymakers and 
local commissioners might consider this 
finding when discussing current policies 
designed to improve access.
British Journal of General Practice, Online First 2018  2
 responders were able to get an appointment 
to see or speak with someone on their last 
attempt as a dichotomous variable (‘Yes’ 
or ‘Yes, but I had to call back’ versus ‘No’). 
For responders who were able to get an 
appointment, three additional measures 
were generated: 
• whether the patient got the type of 
appointment they wanted (such as, to 
see a GP at the practice); 
• whether the patient got the time period 
they wanted (for example, on the same 
day); and 
• how convenient the appointment was 
(further information is available from the 
authors on request).
The first two of these measures were 
dichotomous, 
whereas 
appointment 
convenience had a four-level interval scale 
(‘very convenient’ to ‘not at all convenient’).
In this article, all measures are referred 
to as patient ‘experience’ measures for 
conciseness, but it is acknowledged 
that these measures include subjective 
items about satisfaction, ratings of past 
experiences, and reports of what has 
happened in the past.
Patient characteristics
Six patient characteristics were considered 
to be potential confounders of the 
associations between patient experience 
measures: 
• age group (eight ordinal categories, as 
outlined in Table 1);
• sex;
• ethnicity (white, mixed, Asian, black, or 
other); 
• socioeconomic status (fifths of the Index 
of Multiple Deprivation 2010 for patients’ 
residential areas); 
• confidence in managing own health (four 
ordinal categories, as outlined in Table 1); 
and 
• ability to take time off work to see a GP 
(yes, no, not working).28
The first four of these characteristics 
are those most often included in previous 
GPPS analyses. Confidence in managing 
own health and ability to take time off work 
to see a GP were also included because 
of their strong associations with patient 
experience measures.28,29
Statistical methods
Descriptive 
statistics 
for 
all 
GPPS 
responders were calculated, both before and 
after weighting responses using the weights 
given in the GPPS datasets. These weights 
account for differential probabilities of non-
response (based on patient age, sex, region 
of England, and area-based demographic 
and socioeconomic indicators) and of 
eligible patients being sent questionnaires 
in each practice.17–19 When estimating 
associations between variables, each model 
included all responders without missing

 data for any of the variables included in 
that model. This complete-case analysis 
should introduce minimal bias as variables 
had similar distributions between complete 
cases and all GPPS responders (further 
information is available from the authors 
on request). Past analysis of the GPPS, 
comparing results from complete-case 
analysis and multiple imputation, found no 
meaningful differences.24
Linear regression was used to estimate 
associations between patient experience 
measures. Models were adjusted for 
the six patient characteristics stated 
above by including them as categorical 
variables in the regression equation. 
Models also included fixed effects at the 
general practice level to account for the 
clustering of responders within general 
practices. This adjusted results for possible 
confounding from factors that do not vary 
between patients within a practice (such 
as the characteristics of that practice). 
Associations can be interpreted in terms of 
the relationships between variables within 
practices. The results were also adjusted 
for the survey year; the authors calculated 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Huber–
White standard errors to account for 
possible heteroscedasticity.
Before estimating associations, all 
patient 
experience 
measures 
were 
standardised to have means of zero and 
SDs of one. The regression models return 
standardised 
regression 
coefficients; 
these coefficients are interpreted as the 
estimated change in the outcome variable, 
in terms of SDs of this outcome for a one 
SD increase in an explanatory variable. 
The authors also estimated associations, 
with overall experience (the outcome 
variable) coded on a scale of 0–100 to help 
interpret the magnitudes of associations. 
The corresponding coefficients are the 
estimated change in the outcome variable 
on a 0–100 scale for a one SD increase in an 
explanatory variable.
The regression analyses were separated 
into three models: 
• model A — this estimated associations 
between overall experience and each of 
the explanatory experience measures 
in turn, adjusting only for patient 
characteristics and survey year;
• model B — as model A, but this included 
explanatory 
experience 
measures 
relevant to all responders simultaneously 
so associations were also adjusted for 
the correlations between experience 
measures; and
• model C — as model A and also adjusted 
for the correlations between experience 
measures, but only included responders 
who were able to get an appointment 
on their last attempt; it added the type, 
timing, and convenience of appointments 
as explanatory variables. 
The authors conducted a sensitivity 
analysis with a measure of relational 
continuity of care as an additional 
explanatory variable. This variable was 
examined in a sensitivity analysis only as 
it is defined for just the 59% of responders 
who stated that they had a preferred GP. For 
these responders, the authors measured 
how often they consulted that particular 
GP on a four-level interval scale (‘always or 
almost always’, ‘a lot of the time’, ‘some of 
the time’, or ‘never or almost never’).
The assumption of linear associations 
between patient experience measures 
were checked by adding quadratic terms 
for each of them, which did not improve 
the explanatory power of the models. The 
authors report 95% CIs in the main text but 
not in results tables because the interval 
limits were often equal to the coefficients

aIn total, there were 2 912 535 survey responders from 8289 general practices; data presented where available for

when my GP surgery is open’ were excluded (n = 80 636, 2.8%).

 (to two decimal places); this was because 
of small standard errors resulting partly 
from the large sample size. All statistical 
analyses used Stata/MP (version 13).
RESULTS
The characteristics of patients who 
completed the GPPS dated 2011–2012, 
2012–2013, and 2013–2014 are outlined in 
Table 1. In total, 18.0% reported not being 
able to take time off work to see a GP, 
38.8% could take such time off, and 43.2% 
were not working (due, for example, to 
unemployment, full-time education, and 
retirement). 
Patients generally reported positive 
experiences of their general practices: 
Table 2 shows that 44.8% and 42.2% of 
weighted GPPS responders described 
their overall experiences as ‘very good’ or 
‘fairly good’ respectively. The corresponding 
percentages for satisfaction with opening 
hours 
and 
experiences 
of 
making 
appointments were lower, but still indicated 
generally positive results (Table 2).
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics 
for the other patient experience measures 
analysed. Most patients (89.7%) were able 
to get an appointment on their last attempt, 
and 92.7% of these patients stated that this 
appointment was ‘very convenient’ or’ fairly 
convenient’ (Table 3); this equates to 83.1% 
of patients reporting having a convenient 
appointment. 
Table 4 reports standardised regression 
coefficients (β) for associations between 
overall experience and other patient 
experience measures. In model A (when 
correlations between experience measures 
were not adjusted for), the experience of 
making appointments was most strongly 
associated with overall experience (β 0.61, 
95% CI = 0.60 to 0.61). Satisfaction with 
opening hours was moderately associated 
with overall experience in this model (β 0.48, 
95% CI = 0.47 to 0.48). In model B (when 
correlations between experience measures 
were adjusted for), these associations 
weakened substantially for both the 
experience of making appointments (β 0.24, 
95% CI = 0.24 to 0.25) and satisfaction with 
opening hours (β 0.15, 95% CI = 0.15 to 
0.16) (Table 4). One SD increases in these 
variables corresponded to increases of 4.8 
(95% CI = 4.8 to 4.9) and 3.1 (95% CI = 3.0 to 
3.1) points in overall experience on a 0–100 
scale (Table 4). These associations were 
similar in model C, which only included 
responders who were able to get an 
appointment.
GP interpersonal quality of care was most 
strongly associated with overall experience 
in models B and C (β 0.34, 95% CI = 0.34 
to 0.35). Other variables were modestly 
associated (helpfulness of receptionists: 
β 0.16, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.17) or minimally 
associated with overall experience (β≤0.06).

 Model B explained 65% of variation in 
overall experience (R2 within 0.63, between 
0.92). Model C explained 62% of variation 
in this outcome variable (R2 within 0.60, 
between 0.90). This is substantially more 
than when only patient characteristics 
and survey year were used as explanatory 
variables (R2 overall 0.12, within 0.11, 
between 0.30) (data not shown).
In the sensitivity analysis that examined 
associations among responders who had 
a preferred GP, the measure of relational 
continuity was weakly associated with 
overall experience (β 0.05, data not 
shown). Coefficients for other explanatory 
experience measures were similar to those 
presented for model B in Table 4. 
DISCUSSION
Summary
Experiences of making appointments 
and satisfaction with opening hours were 
modestly associated with overall experience. 
Increases in the former variables of one 
SD (equating to 23–25 points on scales of 
0–100) were independently associated with 
increases of 3–5 points in overall experience 
when measured on a scale of 0–100. Overall 
experience was most strongly associated 
with the interpersonal quality of care provided 
by GPs. With the exception of the helpfulness 
of receptionists, other variables — nurse 
interpersonal quality; ease of telephone 
contact; and appointment type, timing, and 
convenience — had minimal independent 
associations with overall experience. The 
models explained most variation in overall 
experience and almost all variation in this 
measure between practices.
Strengths and limitations
A strength of this study is that it was 
based on a national data source — the 
GPPS — that includes all general practices 
in England. The authors examined patient 
experience measures that are included 
in the national outcomes framework for 
the NHS4 and have been used to evaluate 
recent policies to improve access to general 
practice.12 The findings should, therefore, be 
of direct interest to national policy makers. 
The GPPS’ large sample size helped to give 
very precise estimates (narrow CIs) of the 
associations between patient experience 
measures.
The authors used the multilevel structure 
of the GPPS data to examine associations 
between responders’ answers, while 
accounting for the clustering of patients 
within practices; the results could not be 
confounded by variables that are constant 
within each practice. However, associations 
between two experience measures could 
be confounded by, for example, a third 
experience measure that differs between 
patients within practices. A patient 
characteristic that was not analysed may 
bias some associations; this possibility 
could be partly addressed if the GPPS had 
a cohort of responders that completed a 
questionnaire each year, but such a cohort 
does not yet exist.

 Results could be influenced by the design 
of GPPS questionnaires, such as question 
ordering where responders may be more 
likely to give similar answers to adjacent 
questions than two distant ones. However, 
any ordering effect may be small, as weak 
associations were found between measures 
from adjacent sections, such as satisfaction 
with opening hours (question 25) and overall 
experience (question 28).
A limitation of the GPPS questions, in 
the context of this study, is that responders 
are only asked about their last contact 
with their general practice for some 
questions. These include the questions 
relating to appointments, and GP and 
nurse interpersonal quality of care. 
Assuming that typical experiences are more 
important to overall experience, and that 
patients’ last contacts do not reflect their 
typical experiences (by a random amount), 
estimated associations between the above 
variables and overall experience could be 
weaker than is true. For example, being 
unable to get an appointment on the last 
attempt may not affect overall experience 
to a great extent if appointments are usually 
available. Measurement error due to 
responders’ recall of past experiences could 
also weaken associations. 
It should not be concluded that GP 
interpersonal quality of care is more 
important to overall experience than access 
as patients must be able to access general 
practice services to consult their GP and for 
GP interpersonal quality of care to even be 
relevant. What can be concluded, however, 
is that overall experience was more strongly 
associated with GP interpersonal quality of 
care than patients’ experiences of making 
an appointment specifically on their last 
attempt.
Comparison with existing literature
The study presented here builds on earlier 
work by Paddison et al,24 which examined 
associations between overall satisfaction 
with general practice and other patient 
experience measures in the 2009–2010 
GPPS. Their study was unable to examine 
several policy-relevant measures that 
became available from the 2011–2012 GPPS 
onwards, including experiences of making 
appointments, satisfaction with opening 
hours, and appointment availability and 
characteristics. Still, the study presented 
here is consistent with Paddison et al’s 
findings24 in suggesting that GP interpersonal 
quality of care is the measure most strongly 
associated with overall satisfaction or 
experience. In 2011, the question about 
overall satisfaction was replaced by one 
about overall experience, which is why the 
outcome measure differs between the two 
studies.
Several studies in England30–33 have used 
discrete-choice experiments to assess 
the factors that patients consider most 
important when booking appointments. 
These experiments are limited by their 
simplification of the choice options and 
because stated preferences may differ from 
patients’ actions and actual feelings, but the 
studies all suggest that patients are willing 
to make reasonable trade-offs between 
different 
appointment 
characteristics. 
This may explain why the type, timing, and 
convenience of appointments, and how 
often a preferred GP was consulted, were 
minimally associated with overall experience. 
Other studies28,29,34–36 have used the 
GPPS to investigate associations between 
characteristics of general practices or 
other primary care providers and patient 
experience. One of these studies28 suggests 
that patients registered to practices with 
extended opening hours were slightly more 
satisfied with opening hours, particularly 
if they could not take time off work to see 
a GP; however, this finding did not apply to 
the experience of making appointments and 
overall experience. 
Weak 
associations 
between 
nurse 
interpersonal quality of care and overall 
experience, in contrast with the much 
stronger association for GP interpersonal 
quality, may reflect lower frequencies of 
nurse consultations.37 This could also be 
explained by the nature of consultations: 
patients may see their GP for the more 
important problems that have greater 
potential to affect their experiences.
Implications for research and practice 
Findings of the study presented here 
highlight that satisfaction with opening hours 
and experience of making appointments 
independently had modest associations with 
overall experience. As such, policymakers 
should not expect large improvements 
in overall experiences with short-term 
improvements to either of these variables. 
This includes national policies such as the 
GP Access Fund11 and incentive payments 
to 
commissioners.14 
However, 
policy 
may be able to improve satisfaction with 
opening hours and experience of making 
appointments simultaneously, which could 
have larger effects on overall experience. 
Interventions that aim to improve access 
could also improve overall experience 
independently 
of 
satisfaction 
with 
opening hours and experience of making 
appointments.

 This study also highlights that the 
strongest association found was between 
the interpersonal quality of care provided by 
GPs and overall experience. Policymakers 
could reflect on this finding and consider 
the contexts of GPs’ work that affect 
interactions with patients; for example, 
a large workload could affect whether 
GPs can give each patient enough time 
at consultation. Behaviours of individual 
GPs may also be important, as ratings of 
interpersonal quality vary more between GPs 
(within practices) than between practices.21 
Some interventions being promoted to 
improve access to general practice, such as 
telephone and video consultations, change 
the GP–patient interaction substantially — an 
unintended consequence could be reduced 
interpersonal quality of care.
To conclude, it is suggested that 
policymakers should not assume that 
recent national policies focused on access 
to general practice will translate into 
large improvements in patients’ overall 
experiences, even if they do actually improve 
access.
