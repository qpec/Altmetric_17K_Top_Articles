Abstract
A key function of the brain is to provide a stable representation of an object’s location in the
world. In hearing, sound azimuth and elevation are encoded by neurons throughout the
auditory system, and auditory cortex is necessary for sound localization. However, the coor-
dinate frame in which neurons represent sound space remains undefined: classical spatial
receptive fields in head-fixed subjects can be explained either by sensitivity to sound source
location relative to the head (egocentric) or relative to the world (allocentric encoding). This
coordinate frame ambiguity can be resolved by studying freely moving subjects; here we
recorded spatial receptive fields in the auditory cortex of freely moving ferrets. We found
that most spatially tuned neurons represented sound source location relative to the head
across changes in head position and direction. In addition, we also recorded a small number
of neurons in which sound location was represented in a world-centered coordinate frame.
We used measurements of spatial tuning across changes in head position and direction to
explore the influence of sound source distance and speed of head movement on auditory
cortical activity and spatial tuning. Modulation depth of spatial tuning increased with distance
for egocentric but not allocentric units, whereas, for both populations, modulation was stron-
ger at faster movement speeds. Our findings suggest that early auditory cortex primarily rep-
resents sound source location relative to ourselves but that a minority of cells can represent
sound location in the world independent of our own position.
Author summary
When we hear a sound, we can describe its location relative to ourselves (e.g., “the phone
is on my right”) or relative to the world (e.g., “the phone is in the corner”). These descrip-
tions of space are known as egocentric and allocentric, respectively, and illustrate the
representation of sound location in reference frames defined either by the observer or the
world. We know that neurons in the brain can represent the location of a sound source.
However, previous experiments have been performed in static subjects, in which it’s not
possible to tell whether spatial tuning reflects sensitivity to the position of the sound rela-
tive to the head or in the world. Here, we recorded neurons in the auditory cortex of freely
moving ferrets and showed that most cells represent the position of a sound relative to the

 head, i.e., in an egocentric reference frame. We also recorded a smaller number of allo-
centric cells that were tuned to the position of a sound in the world, across the movement
of the subject. By recording in freely moving animals, we were also able to investigate the
neural encoding of sound source distance and the modulation of auditory processing by
head movement speed.
Introduction
A central role of the brain is to build a model of the world and objects within it that remains
stable across changes in sensory input when we move. In hearing, this requires that an
observer maintains the identification of an auditory object as they move through an environ-
ment. Movement is a critical aspect of sensing [1] that contributes to sound localization and
other auditory behaviors [2–7]; however, the neural basis underpinning active hearing and
how the brain constructs world-centered sound location remains unknown.
For a moving observer, it is possible to represent sound location either relative to oneself
(egocentric representation) or relative to the world through which one moves (allocentric
representation). Allocentric representations provide a consistent report of object location
across movement of an observer [8], as well as a common reference frame for mapping infor-
mation across several observers or multiple sensory systems [9,10]. Despite the computational
value and perceptual relevance of allocentric representations to hearing, studies of auditory
processing have only recently considered the coordinate frames in which sound location is
represented [11–13]. Both electroencephalography (EEG) and modelling studies hint that
sound location might be represented in cortex in both head-centered and head-independent
spaces. However, EEG has not yet revealed the precise location of these representations and
cannot determine how individual neurons in tonotopic auditory cortex define space.
In static subjects, auditory cortical neurons encode sound azimuth and elevation [14–18],
and localization of sound sources requires an intact auditory cortex [19–21]. However, in static
subjects with a fixed head position, neural tuning to sound location is ambiguous, as the head
and world coordinate frames are fixed in alignment, and so allocentric and egocentric sound
location are always equivalent. While it has been largely assumed that cortical neurons repre-
sent sound location relative to the head, the spatial coordinate frame in which location is
encoded remains to be demonstrated. Furthermore, though the acoustic cues to sound locali-
zation are explicitly head-centered, information about head direction, which is necessary to
form a world-centered representation, is present at early levels of the ascending auditory sys-
tem [22]. Thus, it may be possible for neurons in the auditory system to represent space in an
allocentric, world-centered coordinate frame that would preserve sound location across
changes in head position and direction.
Here, we resolve the coordinate frame ambiguity of spatial tuning in auditory cortex by
recording from neurons in freely moving ferrets. In moving conditions, the head and world
coordinate frames are no longer fixed in alignment, so we can determine in which coordinate
frame a given cell is most sensitive to sound source location. Our approach reveals head-cen-
tered and world-centered units, suggesting that egocentric and allocentric representations
coexist in auditory cortex. We also explore the impact of distance from a sound source and the
speed of a subject’s movement on spatial tuning in auditory cortex.

 Results
We hypothesized that measuring spatial tuning in moving subjects would allow us to distin-
guish between egocentric (head-centered) and allocentric (world-centered) representations of
sound location (Fig 1). To formalize this theory and develop quantitative predictions about the
effects of observer movement on spatial tuning, we first simulated egocentric and allocentric
neurons that were tuned to sound locations defined relative to the head (Fig 1a) and world
(independent of the subject), respectively (Fig 1b). We simulated allocentric and egocentric
units using parameters fitted to produce identical spatial receptive fields when tested in the
classical condition in which the head is in a fixed location at the center of a speaker ring (Fig
1c and 1d), illustrating coordinate frame ambiguity. Our simulation also confirmed that when
the observer moved freely with a uniform distribution of head directions, spatial tuning should
only be apparent in the coordinate frame relevant for neural output (Fig 1e). Additionally,
changes in head direction produced systematic shifts in tuning curves in the coordinate frame
that were irrelevant for neural output, while tuning in the relevant coordinate frame was
invariant across head direction (Fig 1f). We subsequently demonstrated that tuning curves of
many shapes and preferred locations can theoretically be explained by spatial receptive fields
based within an allocentric coordinate frame (S1 Fig). With simulations providing a founda-
tion, we then made recordings in freely moving animals to determine whether the spatial tun-
ing of auditory cortical neurons followed egocentric or allocentric predictions.
To measure spatial tuning in moving subjects, we implanted ferrets (n = 5) with multichan-
nel tungsten electrode arrays, allowing the recording of single and multiunit activity during
behavior. During neural recording, each ferret was placed in an arena, which the animal
explored for water rewards while the surrounding speakers played click sounds (Fig 2a). To
measure the animal’s head position, direction, and speed in the world during exploration (Fig
2b–2f), we tracked light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed on the midline of the head (S1 Video).
During exploration, click sounds were presented from speakers arranged at 30˚ intervals
between ±90˚ relative to the arena center, with speaker order and inter-click interval (250–500
ms) varied pseudo-randomly. We also roved the level of clicks between 54 decibel sound pres-
sure level (dB SPL) and 60 dB SPL such that absolute sound level varied both as a function of
sound source level and distance between head and speaker, to reduce cues about sound loca-
tion provided by absolute sound level (Fig 2g and 2h). Clicks were used as they provided
instantaneous energy and thus ensured minimal movement of the animal during stimulus pre-
sentation (S3 Fig). The locations (speaker angle) from which the clicks originated were used
alone to estimate allocentric receptive fields and were used in conjunction with the animal’s
head direction and position to measure egocentric spatial receptive fields.
We observed that animals moved throughout the arena to collect water (Fig 2b) and used a
range of head directions during exploration (Fig 2e). In contrast to our initial simulations, the
distribution of the animal’s head direction was notably non-uniform, leading to correlations
between sound source angle relative to the head and the world (e.g., Fig 2c; mean ± SEM R2 =
0.247 ± 0.0311). This correlation between sound source angles resulted because the animal pre-
ferred to orient towards the front of the arena (0˚) and thus sounds that were to the right of
the animal were more often on the right of the arena than would result from random behavior.
The preference of the animal was likely a consequence of the shape of the arena and the loca-
tion of the water spouts within it. Although the correlation between sound source locations rel-
ative to the head and within the world was relatively small, we sought to determine how the
animal’s head direction preference affected our experimental predictions.
To assess the influence of real animal behavior on our ability to distinguish coordinate
frames, we combined our simulated egocentric and allocentric receptive fields (Fig 1) with

 the animal’s head position and direction across each single behavioral testing session
(Fig 3a). This allowed us to calculate the spatial tuning for known allocentric and egocentric
receptive fields in both head and world coordinate frames. Our simulation predictions
(Fig 1) demonstrated that for a uniform distribution of head angles, the tuning function of
allocentric or egocentric units should be flat when considered in the irrelevant coordinate
frame. However, a bias in head location over time would produce spatial modulation in firing
rate with location in the irrelevant coordinate frame (Fig 3a). In order to account for this, we
therefore measured residual modulation as the ratio of modulation depth in each coordinate
frame (Fig 3; MDIrrelevant / MDRelevant). Residual modulation thus represents the degree of
indirect spatial tuning in one coordinate frame observed as a by-product of the animal’s
behavior combined with spatial tuning in another coordinate frame.

 Across all behavioral sessions, residual modulation was inversely correlated with variation
in the animal’s head direction (expressed as standard deviation) for both egocentric (R2 =
0.562, p = 1.07 x 10−10) and allocentric simulated units (R2 = 0.615, p = 3.73 x 10−12) (Fig 3b).
This indicated that for real animal behavior, we would not expect to see the complete abolition
of tuning but rather spatial tuning in both coordinate frames, with the weaker tuning poten-
tially attributable to the animal’s bias in head direction. In our neural analysis, we thus used
the relationship between behavior and residual modulation to provide a statistical framework
in which to assess the significance of spatial tuning of real neurons.
Egocentric and allocentric tuning in auditory cortex
During exploration, we recorded the activity of 186 sound-responsive units (50 single units,
136 multi-units) in auditory cortex (S2 Fig). Electrode arrays were targeted to span the low-fre-
quency areas in which the middle and posterior ectosylvian gyral regions meet, and thus units
were sampled from primary auditory cortex and two tonotopically organized secondary fields:
the posterior pseudosylvian and posterior suprasylvian fields. We analyzed the firing rates of
units in the 50 milliseconds after the onset of each click; this window was wide enough to cap-
ture the neural response while being sufficiently short so that the animal’s head moved less
than 1 cm (median 4 mm, S3 Fig) and less than 30˚ (median 12.6˚)—the interval between
speakers. The time interval between stimuli always exceeded 250 ms.
We identified periods of time during which the animal was facing forwards (± 15˚ of the
arena midline) at the center of the speaker ring (S4 Fig): in this situation, we mimic classic
neurophysiological investigations of spatial tuning in which head and world coordinate frames
are aligned. In the aligned case, we recorded 92 units that were significantly modulated by
sound source location (Fig 4a–4d: Top left, general linear model [GLM] analysis of deviance,
p � 0.05) and for which spatial tuning curves computed in head and world coordinate frames

 were highly correlated (mean ± SEM: R2 = 0.889 ± 0.0131). We then compared the aligned
control condition with all data in which the head and world coordinate frames were free to
vary. Compared to the aligned condition, the correlation between egocentric and allocentric
tuning curves when coordinate frames were free to vary was significantly lower (Fig 4e, R2 =
0.522 ± 0.0294) (paired t test: free versus aligned t91 = 8.76, p < 0.001), and differences in spa-
tial tuning in head and world coordinate frames became visible (Fig 4a–4d: Bottom left).
When animals moved freely through the arena, and head and world coordinate frames
were thus dissociated, we observed units consistent with egocentric (Fig 4a and 4b, S5 and S6
Figs) and allocentric hypotheses (Fig 4c and 4d, S7 and S8 Figs). For units consistent with the
egocentric hypothesis, spatial receptive fields were more strongly modulated by sound angle in
the head coordinate frame than the world coordinate frame. For the unit shown in Fig 4a,
modulation depth values in the head and world coordinate frames were 28.3% and 10.1%,
respectively. In Fig 4b, modulation depth was 49.0% in the head coordinate frame and 30.3%
in the world coordinate frame. Furthermore, tuning curves for sounds plotted relative to the
head remained consistent across head rotation but shifted systematically when plotted relative
to the world (Fig 4a and 4b: Right columns). Both outcomes are highly consistent with our
simulation predictions (Fig 1).
In addition to identifying head-centered spatial tuning across movement, we also found
units with spatial tuning that realized the predictions generated by the allocentric hypothesis.
These units showed greater modulation depth to sound angle in the world coordinate frame
than the head coordinate frame (Fig 4c and 4d, S7 and S8 Figs): For putative allocentric units,
modulation depths for tuning curves were 21.2% and 13.4% in the world and head coordinate
frames, respectively, for the unit shown in Fig 4c and 12.7% and 10.1%, respectively, for the
unit shown in Fig 4d. For allocentric units, spatial tuning in the world coordinate frame was
robust to head rotation, whereas tuning curves expressed relative to the head were systemati-
cally shifted when mapped according to head direction (Fig 4c and 4d: Right column).
Modulation depth across coordinate frames
To quantify the observations we made above and systematically compare spatial tuning in
world and head coordinate frames, we calculated modulation depth for both tuning curves for
each unit. We next asked if modulation depth observed in either head or world coordinate
frames was greater than the residual modulation predicted by our earlier simulations (Fig 3b).
A linear regression model developed using simulated receptive fields was used to predict the
magnitude of residual tuning for each coordinate frame from the animal’s behavior during the
recording of each unit (Fig 5a–5d). To describe the animal’s behavior across the relevant test-
ing sessions for each neural recording, we calculated the standard deviation of head directions
(Fig 5a). A smaller standard deviation indicates a less uniform range of head-directions and
when combined with our regression model (Fig 5b) would predict higher residual modulation
in both coordinate frames. Thus, for a given standard deviation, we could use linear regression
to obtain a predicted confidence interval for the residual modulation in head and world coor-
dinate frames arising from allocentric or egocentric tuning, respectively (Fig 5c). The observed
modulation values were calculated for each unit as the ratio of modulation depth in one coor-
dinate frame divided by the other coordinate frame (Fig 5d), and significance was attributed
when test values exceeded the confidence interval of residual modulation.
Across all spatially tuned units, modulation in the head coordinate frame was significantly
greater than predicted for 87/92 units (94.6%) (p < 0.05, Fig 5e); modulation in the world
coordinate frame was significant for 19/92 units (20.7%, Fig 5f). For 14/92 units (15.2%),
modulation depth was significantly greater than expected in both coordinate frames. When

 Bonferroni corrected for multiple (n = 92, α = 5.43 x 10−4) comparisons, these numbers
dropped to 69/92 units (75%) for modulation in the head coordinate frame, none of which
were additionally modulated in a world coordinate frame, and 6/92 units (6.5%) for modula-
tion in the world coordinate frame—none of which showed significant head-centered
modulation. With this more-conservative statistical threshold, modulation depths were not
significantly greater than expected in either coordinate frame for the remaining 17/92 units
(18.5%). Together these observations suggest that response types occupy a continuum from
purely egocentric to purely allocentric. The existence of units with significant modulation in
both coordinate frames with a less-conservative statistical cutoff, or no significant modulation
with corrected threshold, may indicate mixed spatial sensitivity comparable with other reports
in auditory cortex [23].
A key prediction from our simulations with both uniform head-directions (Fig 1) and
actual head-directions (Fig 3a) was that modulation depth would be greater in the coordinate
frame that was relevant for neural activity than the irrelevant coordinate frame (i.e., Head >
World for egocentric; World > Head for allocentric). Having demonstrated that modulation
within both co-ordinate frames was greater than expected based on the non-uniform sampling
of head direction, we compared the modulation depth across coordinate frames for all spatially

 tuned units (Fig 5g). For 76/92 units (82.6%), we observed greater modulation depth in the
head coordinate frame than the world coordinate frame, indicating a predominance of egocen-
tric tuning and a minority of units (16/92, 17.4%) in which allocentric tuning was strongest.
General linear modelling to define egocentric and allocentric populations
Our analysis of modulation depth indicated the presence of both egocentric and allocentric
representations in auditory cortex but also highlighted that the analysis of modulation depth
alone was sometimes unable to resolve the coordinate frame in which units encoded sound
location. To calculate modulation depth requires that we discretize sound location into distinct
angular bins, average neural responses across trials, and thus ignore single trial variation in fir-
ing rates. GLMs potentially offer a more-sensitive method, as they permit the analysis of single
trial data and allow us to treat sound angle as a continuous variable. We considered two mod-
els, which either characterized neural activity as a function of sound source angle relative to
the head (GLMHEAD) or in the world (GLMWORLD). For all units for which at least one GLM
provided a statistically significant fit (relative to a constant model, analysis of deviance;
p < 0.05, 91/92 units), we compared model performance using the Akaike information crite-
rion (AIC)[24] for model selection. In accordance with the modulation depth analysis, the
majority of units were better modelled by sound angle relative to the head than world (72/91
units; 79.1%; 4 animals), consistent with egocentric tuning. However, we also observed a
smaller number of units (19/91 units; 20.9%; 3 animals) whose responses were better modelled
by sound angle in the world and thus showed stronger representation of allocentric sound
location.
To visualize GLM performance and explore egocentric and allocentric tuning further, we
plotted a normalized metric of the deviance value usually used to assess model fit. Here, we
defined model fit as the proportion of explainable deviance (Fig 6a) in which a test model
(e.g., GLMWORLD) is considered in the context of GLMs that have no variable predictors of
neural activity (a constant model) or use sound angle in both coordinate frames as predictors
(a full model). This normalization step is critical in comparing model fit across units, as devi-
ance values alone are unbounded. In contrast, model fit is limited from 0% (indicating the
sound angle provides little information about the neuron’s response) to 100% (indicating the
sound angle in one coordinate frame accounts for the neuron’s response as well as sound
angles in both frames). While the units we recorded formed a continuum in this space, for the
purpose of further analysis we defined egocentric and allocentric units according to the coor-
dinate frame (head/world) that provided the best model fit as determined by the AIC above.
Using a GLM-based analysis, we predicted that egocentric units would have a high percent-
age of the full model fit by sound angles relative to the head and a low model fit for sound
angles relative to the world and that allocentric units would show the reciprocal relationship.
To test these predictions, we generated a model preference score; the model fit for sound
angles relative to the head minus the model fit for sound angles in the world. Accordingly, neg-
ative values of model preference should identify allocentric units, while positive values should
indicate egocentric units. Neurons in which both sound angles relative to the world and head
provide high model fit values may represent sounds in intermediary or mixed coordinate
frames and would have model preference scores close to zero, as would neurons in which we
were unable to disambiguate coordinate frame preference due to non-uniform head angle
distributions.
In the space defined by model fit for sound angles relative to the head and world (Fig 6b),
units clustered in opposite areas, supporting the existence of both egocentric and allocentric
representations. This clustering was also evident in the model preference scores, which showed

 a bimodal distribution (Fig 6c). Repeating this analysis on data in which the head and world
coordinate frames were aligned (due to the animals’ position at the center of the speaker ring)
demonstrated that model fit values for head and world coordinate frames became more
similar, and model preference scores were centered around zero (Fig 6d and 6e). When we
compared the change in model fit with alignment (two-way anova), this was reflected as a sig-
nificant interaction between coordinate frame (head or world) and unit type (egocentric or
allocentric, determined by the coordinate frame that provided best model fit using the AIC,
F1,178 = 130.1, p = 5.71 x 10−23). Post hoc comparison confirmed that model fit in the head
coordinate frame decreased significantly for egocentric units (Bonferroni corrected for multi-
ple comparisons, p = 5.04 x 10−5) and increased significantly for allocentric units (p = 4.36 x
10−4). In contrast, in the world coordinate frame, alignment led to a significant increase in
model fit for egocentric units (p = 2.22 x 10−20) and a non-significant decrease in model fit for
allocentric units (p = 0.155).
We performed two additional control analyses on the freely moving dataset: firstly, we ran-
domly shuffled the speaker identity while maintaining the same information about the ani-
mal’s head direction. Randomizing the speaker identity should affect the ability to model both
egocentric and allocentric neurons, and we would therefore predict that model fits for spatially
relevant coordinate frames would be worse, and model preference scores would tend to zero
(i.e., shuffling would shift model preference scores in the negative direction for egocentric
units and the positive direction for allocentric units). As predicted, shuffling speaker identity
eliminated clustering of egocentric and allocentric units in the space defined by model fit (Fig
6g) and led to opposing effects on model preference (Fig 6h and 6i): Model fit scores for ego-
centric and allocentric units were both affected by shuffling speaker identity but in opposite
directions (unit x coordinate frame interaction, F1, 178 = 227.4, p = 1.22 x 10−33). For egocentric
units, the model fit for sound angle relative to the head declined significantly with shuffling
(p = 7.44 x 10−41), while fit for sound angle in the world did not change significantly (p =
0.271). For allocentric units, model fit for sound angle in the world declined significantly
(p = 1.29 x 10−8) but was not significantly different in the head coordinate frame (p = 0.35).
When shuffling stimulus angle (averaging across 1,000 shuffles), we identified 12/19 (63.2%)
allocentric and 63/72 (87.5%) egocentric units with model preference scores beyond the 97.5%
limits of the shuffled distribution.
Secondly, we shuffled information about the animal’s head direction while maintaining
information about speaker identity. This should cause model fit values to decline for sound
angle relative to the head for egocentric units and should therefore result in egocentric units
shifting their model preference scores towards zero. For allocentric units, the model fit for
sound location in the world should be maintained, and we would not predict a systematic
change in model preference. This was indeed the case (Fig 6j–6l; interaction between coordi-
nate frame and unit type: F1, 178 = 216.7, p = 1.35 x 10−32): For egocentric units shuffling head
direction significantly reduced model fit in the head coordinate frame (p = 1.40 x 10−27) and
increased model fit in the world coordinate frame (p = 2.20 x 10−31). For allocentric units,
shuffling head direction did not significantly affect model fit in either head (p = 0.211) or
world coordinate frames (p = 0.178).

 Egocentric and allocentric units—Population characteristics
For egocentric units that encoded sound location in the head coordinate frame, it was possible
to characterize the full extent of tuning curves in 360˚ around the head (Fig 5a and 5b), despite
our speaker array only spanning 180˚. This was possible because the animal’s head direction
varied continuously across 360˚ and so removed the constraints on measurement of spatial
tuning imposed by the range of speaker angles used. Indeed, we were able to extend our
approach further to characterize super-resolution tuning functions with an angular resolution
more precise than the interval between speakers (Fig 7a and 7b and S9 Fig). Together these
findings show it is possible to use changes in head direction to recover the spatial tuning of
individual units with greater detail than would be possible if the subject’s head position and
direction remained constant relative to the sound sources. Egocentric units shared spatial
receptive field properties typical of previous studies [15,16,18,25]: units predominantly
responded most strongly to contralateral space (Fig 7c) with broad tuning widths (Fig 7e and
7f) that typify auditory cortical neurons. We also found similar, if slightly weaker, spatial mod-
ulation when calculating modulation depth according to Ref. [18] (Fig 7d).
For allocentric units, we observed a similar contralateral tuning bias in preferred location
(Fig 8a) to egocentric units and that allocentric units had relatively low modulation depths
(Fig 8b). These tuning features may not be surprising, as an allocentric receptive field could
presumably fall anywhere within or beyond the arena and might therefore be poorly sampled

 by circular speaker arrangements. If the tuning curves measured here were in fact sampling a
more complex receptive field that related to a world-centered coordinate frame (Fig 1b), then
we would predict that the receptive fields would be correspondingly noisier. Allocentric and
egocentric units were recorded at similar cortical depths (Fig 8c) and on the same cortical pen-
etrations; egocentric units were recorded on 9 of 13 electrodes (69.2%) on which we also iden-
tified allocentric units (Fig 8d).
Timing of spatial information
Our findings suggested the existence of egocentric and allocentric tuning in auditory cortex.
As these descriptions were functionally defined, we hypothesized that differences between allo-
centric and egocentric tuning should only arise after stimulus presentation. To test this, we
analyzed the time course of unit activity in a moving 20 ms window and compared model fit
and model preference of egocentric and allocentric units (defined based on the AIC analysis
above) using cluster-based statistics to assess significance [26]. Model fit for sound angles rela-
tive to the head was greater for egocentric than allocentric units only between 5 ms and 44 ms
after stimulus onset (Fig 9a, p = 0.001996). Model fit for sound angles in the world was greater
for allocentric than egocentric units only between 6 ms and 34 ms after stimulus (Fig 9b,
p = 0.001996). Model preference diverged only in the window between 4 ms and 43 ms after
stimulus onset (Fig 9c, p = 0.001996). We observed no differences between egocentric and allo-
centric units before stimulus onset or when coordinate frames were aligned (S10 Fig). Thus,

 the differences between egocentric and allocentric units reflected a stimulus-evoked effect that
was only observed when head and world coordinate frames were free to vary.
Population representations of space
We next asked how auditory cortical neurons behaved as a population when spatial tuning was
compared across head directions. In contrast to individual units, population activity more
closely reflects the large-scale signals observed in human studies using EEG to distinguish
coordinate frame representations [11,12]. To form populations, we took the unweighted mean
of normalized firing rates from all units recorded from left (n = 64) or right (n = 28) hemi-
spheres and compared tuning curves measured at different head directions. As would be
expected from the predominance of egocentric units, we found that tuning curves for both left
and right auditory cortical populations were consistent within the head coordinate frame but
not the world coordinate frame (Fig 10). Thus, the allocentric units we find here were suffi-
ciently rare as to be masked in overall population readouts of spatial tuning, potentially
accounting for conflicting findings of coordinate frame representations from EEG recordings.
Distance modulation of cortical neurons and spatial tuning
Studying auditory processing in moving subjects allowed us to resolve coordinate frame
ambiguity so that we could determine the spaces in which neurons represent sound location.
However, recording in freely moving subjects also made it possible to go beyond angular

 measurements of the source location and address how neurons represented the distance of
sound sources. Though often overlooked, distance is a critical component of egocentric mod-
els of neural tuning, as the acoustic cues indicating sound location such as inter-aural level
differences (ILDs) change as sound sources approach the head. For distant sound sources
(typically > 1 m), ILDs are small relative to distance-related attenuation of sound; however,
ILDs become much larger as sounds approach the head, and source-receiver distance
decreases [27,28]. Neurons must therefore accommodate for distance-dependent cues to accu-
rately represent sound location across changes in head position. In our study, the distance
between head and sound source ranged from 10 cm (the minimum distance imposed by the
arena walls) to 40 cm, with only 3.37% of stimuli (mean across 57 test sessions) presented at
greater distances (Fig 2g), and thus stimuli were likely to produce large ILDs [27,28].
Spatial tuning was observed at all distances studied in both egocentric (Fig 11a) and allo-
centric units (Fig 11b); however, modulation depth increased with distance for egocentric
units (ANOVA, F2,216 = 3.45, p = 0.0334). Pairwise post hoc comparisons showed that modula-
tion depth was largest for sounds at the greatest distances (Fig 11c), though the only significant
difference was found for sounds presented 20 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 40 cm away (t72 =
−3.54, p = 0.0279). In contrast, modulation depth did not change significantly with distance
for allocentric units (Fig 11d, F2, 57 = 0.962, p > 0.1).

 Speed modulation of cortical neurons and spatial tuning
Changes in head position and direction also allowed us to investigate how speed of head move-
ment (Fig 2f) affected neural activity. Movement is known to affect auditory processing in
rodents [29–31], but its effects on spatial representations of sound location and also on audi-
tory cortical processing in other phyla such as carnivores remain unknown. Here, we pre-
sented click sounds for which dynamic acoustic cues would be negligible, and thus, we could
isolate the effects of head movement on neural activity.
To address auditory cortical processing, first, we asked how many of our recorded units
(regardless of auditory responsiveness or spatial modulation) showed baseline activity that var-
ied with speed. For each unit, we took all periods of exploration (excluding the 50 ms after
each click onset) and calculated the speed of the animal at the time of each action potential.
We then discretized the distribution of spike-triggered speeds to obtain spike counts as a func-
tion of speed and normalized spike counts by the duration over which each speed range was
measured. This process yielded a speed-rate function for baseline activity (Fig 12a). We then

 fitted an exponential regression curve to each function (Fig 12b) and plotted the correlation
(R2) and regression coefficients (β) of each curve to map the magnitude and direction of asso-
ciation between speed and baseline activity (Fig 12c). Across the recorded population, we saw
both positive and negative correlations representing units for which firing rate increased or
decreased, respectively, with speed. However, a significantly larger proportion of the popula-
tion increased firing rate with speed across all units (t test versus 0; t308 = 3.77, p = 1.97 x 10−4).
This was also true if we considered only sound-responsive units (t267 = 5.15, p = 5.17 x 10−7) or
only spatially tuned units (t91 = 4.12, p = 8.41 x 10−5).
We also observed speed-related modulation of sound-evoked responses in individual units
(Fig 12d and 12e). For each individual unit, we characterized the relationship between head
speed and single trial firing rates (averaged over the 50 ms post-stimulus onset) using a GLM
that measured both the strength (analysis of deviance, p value) and direction (model coeffi-
cient, β) of association. Positive β values indicated an increase in firing rate with increasing
speed, whereas negative β values indicated a fall in firing rate with increasing speed. Thus, the
direction of the relationship between firing rate and speed was summarized by the model coef-
ficient, allowing us to map the effects of movement speed across the population (Fig 12f). For
199/268 sound-responsive units (74.3%), speed was a significant predictor of firing rate (analy-
sis of deviance versus a constant model, p < 0.001); however, the mean coefficient value for
movement-sensitive units did not differ significantly from zero (t199 = 0.643, p = 0.521). This
suggests that the sound-responsive population was evenly split between units that increased or
decreased firing with speed. We noted that a significantly greater proportion of spatially mod-
ulated units (74/92, 80.4%) had sound-evoked responses that were sensitive to speed than
units that were either not spatially modulated or for which we had insufficient sample sizes to
test spatial modulation (125/176, 71.0%, Chi-squared test, χ2 = 3.96, p < 0.05). For those 74
spatially modulated and speed-sensitive units, coefficients were mostly larger than zero
(mean ± SEM = 2.73 x 10−5 ± 1.53 x 10−5); however, this effect was not statistically significant
(t73 = 1.80, p = 0.076). For the remaining speed-sensitive units, the mean coefficients was closer
to zero (mean ± SEM = −5.02 x 10−6 ± 1.49 x 10−5).
Lastly, we asked if speed affected spatial tuning. Spatial tuning could be observed at all
speeds of movement in spatially tuned units (Fig 12h), and the preferred locations of units did
not vary systematically with speed (Fig 12i). For neither egocentric nor allocentric units was
there a significant effect of speed in an ANOVA on preferred locations (egocentric: F5, 432 =
0.53, p = 0.753; allocentric: F5, 108 = 1.53, p = 0.188). However, we did observe significant
changes in modulation depth (Fig 12j) both for egocentric (F5, 432 = 4.91, p = 0.0002) and allo-
centric units (F5, 108 = 5.09, p = 0.0003), indicating that spatial modulation was greater when
the head was moving fastest. Change in modulation depth resulted from both a gradual sup-
pression in minimum firing rates and enhancement in maximum firing rates with speed (Fig
12k). However, none of these changes in minimum or maximum firing rate were significant in
comparisons across speed (ANOVA with speed as the main factor, p > 0.5), indicating that it
was only through the aggregative change in responses to both preferred and non-preferred
locations that modulation depth increased with speed.
Discussion
Here we have shown that by measuring spatial tuning curves in freely moving animals, it is
possible to demonstrate the coordinate frames in which neurons define sound location. For
the majority of spatially sensitive auditory cortical neurons, we found egocentric tuning that
confirms the broadly held but untested assumption that within the central auditory pathway,
sound location is represented in head-centered coordinates. We also identified a small number

 of units with allocentric tuning, whose responses were spatially locked to sound location in the
world, suggesting that multiple coordinate frames are represented at the auditory cortical level.
These units were consistently identified across different analyses, observed in several subjects,
and could be dissociated from simultaneously recorded egocentric receptive fields during the
same behavioral sessions. Finally, we explored the dependence of neural activity and spatial
tuning on sound source distance and the speed of head movement, demonstrating that both
factors can modulate firing rates and spatial tuning in auditory cortex.
Our results show that an animal’s movement can be successfully tracked to measure head-
centered egocentric tuning during behavior. Although we used speakers placed at 30˚ intervals
across a range of 180˚, we were nonetheless able to characterize spatial tuning of egocentric
units around the full circumference of the head (i.e., Fig 7b). This illustrates the practical bene-
fit of using moving subjects to characterize head-centered spatial tuning, as the animal’s head
rotation generates the additional variation in sound angle relative to the head necessary to
fully map azimuthal tuning with a reduced number of sound sources. Furthermore, as the
animal’s head direction was continuous, the stimulus angle was also continuous, and thus, it
was possible to measure spatial tuning at finer resolutions than that of the speaker ring from
which stimuli were presented. In contrast to egocentric tuning, our ability to map allocentric
receptive fields was limited by the speaker arrangement that only sparsely sampled world coor-
dinates (Fig 2a). This may, in part, explain the low number of allocentric units in our popula-
tion, and denser sampling of the world may reveal unseen allocentric tuning—for example, in
the 50.5% (94/186) of units in which we recorded sound-evoked responses that were not spa-
tially modulated. While a full 360˚ speaker ring may offer a minor improvement in sampling
density, the radial organization of the ring remains a suboptimal design for sampling rectangu-
lar or irregular environments. To fully explore the shape of allocentric receptive fields will
require denser, uniform speaker grids or lattices in environments through which animals can
move between sound sources.
A notable property of egocentric units was the relationship between modulation depth of
spatial tuning and distance, which was absent in allocentric units. This distance sensitivity may
largely be driven by changes in ILDs, although other auditory and non-auditory cues can affect
distance perception [32–36]. However, modulation depth in our study was lowest for proximal
sounds when ILDs would be larger and when other cues such as inter-aural time differences
remain relatively constant [27,28]. Localization of nearby sound sources (< 1 m) is possible
for ferrets and humans [37,38], though within the range of distances we considered here, angu-
lar error of azimuthal localization in humans increases slightly as sounds approach the head
[37]. Thus, our findings are consistent with human psychophysical performance but suggest
that larger localization cues may not always produce better sound localization by neurons in
auditory cortex. In the future, it will be critical to validate our findings for sound sources at
greater distances where sound localization has been more widely studied.
In addition to recording many egocentric units, we also recorded a small number of allo-
centric units, supporting the idea that auditory cortex represents sound location in multiple
coordinate frames [23] and parses an auditory scene into distinct objects [39,40]. We believe
this is the first study to look for world-centered encoding of sound locations at the cellular
level. Thus, the units we recorded, while small in number, reflect a novel spatial representation
in the auditory system.
A key question is where allocentric units reside in cortex: egocentric and allocentric units
were located on the same electrodes and cortical depths in the primary and posterior regions
of auditory cortex in which we recorded. However, the low density of electrodes in our arrays,
and their placement over a low-frequency border, prevented us from mapping the precise
tonotopic boundaries necessary to attribute units to specific cortical subfields [41]. Future use

 of denser sampling arrays may enable cortical mapping in behaving animals and thus precise
localization of allocentric units. We targeted the low-frequency reversal between primary and
posterior auditory cortex, as these areas are likely to be sensitive to inter-aural timing cues,
and the animals involved in this work were also trained to discriminate non-spatial features of
low-frequency sounds in another study [42]. Posterior regions may correspond to part of the
“what” pathway in auditory processing, whereas the anterior ectosylvian gyrus may corre-
spond to the “where” pathway in which spatial tuning is more extensive [43,44]. It is thus likely
that spatial tuning to the coordinate frames represented in our population (in which only 49%
of units were spatially sensitive) may be more ubiquitous in anterior regions of ferret auditory
cortex. Indeed, given that sensorimotor and cross-modal coordinate frame transformations
are a key feature of activity in parietal cortex [10], it is likely that allocentric representations
exist beyond auditory cortex.
While the observation of allocentric receptive fields in tonotopic auditory cortex is novel,
the existence of allocentric representations has been predicted by behavioral studies in
humans [6,13]. Furthermore, coordinate transformations occur elsewhere in the auditory sys-
tem [23,45], and behavioral movements can influence auditory subcortical and cortical pro-
cessing [29,30]. Perhaps most importantly, vestibular signals are already integrated into
auditory processing at the level of the cochlea nucleus [46], allowing the distinction between
self and source motion [22]. Auditory-vestibular integration, together with visual, propriocep-
tive, and motor corollary discharge systems, provides a mechanism through which changes in
head direction can partially offset changes in acoustic input during movement to create allo-
centric representations. At present, it is unclear whether allocentric representations require
self-generated movement, and it will be interesting to test if world-centered tuning is present
if head direction is systematically varied in stationary animals.
It is also unclear how head position is also integrated into auditory processing. Positional
information within the medial temporal lobe (or its carnivore equivalent) is a leading candi-
date given the connections between entorhinal and auditory cortex [47,48]; however, the
functional interactions between these areas and their potential contributions to allocentric
processing have yet to be addressed. Another critical question relates to the visual (or other
sensory) cues that animals may use to orient in the world and define allocentric representa-
tions. Given that head and place cells remap in different settings [49,50] and that auditory cor-
tex receives somatosensory and visual information through multiple pathways [48,51], it will
be interesting to determine if changes in visual/tactile environment affect tuning of allocentric
receptive fields, and if so, what environmental features anchor auditory processing.
Variation in the animal’s head position with movement also allowed us to study the effects
of head movement speed on auditory processing and spatial tuning. In contrast to other stud-
ies in freely behaving animals that reported movement-related suppression of activity [29–31],
we found that neurons tended to fire more strongly when the head moved faster (Fig 12). One
reason for this difference may lie in the behavior measured: Other investigators have covered a
diverse range of actions including locomotion in which both the head and body move, and
self-generated sounds are more likely. We only considered the head speed of an animal and
did not track the body position that would distinguish head movements from locomotion
(which was relatively limited given the size of the animal and the arena). It is thus likely that
much of the variation in speed we observed was a product of head movement during foraging
without locomotion and thus with relatively little self-generated sound. The behavior of our
subjects may therefore present different requirements for auditory–motor integration that
result in distinct neural effects.
We also observed that spatial modulation was also greater when the animal was moving
faster, which may be consistent with the sharpening of tuning curves during behavioral

 engagement [15]. While sharpening of engagement-related spatial tuning was linked to a
reduction in spiking responses at untuned locations, we observed nonsignificant decreases in
peak and minimum firing rates (which together increased modulation depth), suggesting that
the mechanisms underlying speed-related modulation of spatial tuning may be subtly differ-
ent. At the acoustic level, faster movements provide larger dynamic cues [2,3] that improve
sound localization abilities in humans [3,52,53] and may explain the increase in modulation
depth of units at greater speeds observed here.
In summary, we recorded spatial tuning curves in auditory cortex of freely moving animals
to resolve coordinate frame ambiguity. We demonstrated many egocentric units representing
location relative to the head and a small number of allocentric units representing sound loca-
tion relative to the world. We also studied the role of distance and speed in auditory cortical
processing. Together, our findings illustrate that auditory cortical processing of sound space
may extend to multiple coordinate frames and spatial dimensions such as azimuth and dis-
tance, as well as non-auditory variables such as speed of movement.

Ethics statement
All experimental procedures were approved by local ethical review committees (Animal Wel-
fare and Ethical Review Board) at University College London and The Royal Veterinary Col-
lege, University of London and performed under license from the UK Home Office (Project

Simulated spatial receptive fields
Egocentric.
Egocentric tuning described the relationship between spike probability (P)
and sound source angle relative to the midline of the subject’s head (θHS) and was simulated in
Matlab (MathWorks) using a Gaussian function:

ð1Þ
In the example shown in Fig 1a, parameters (a = 1.044, b = 0˚, and c = 75.7˚) were deter-
mined by manual fitting to find values for which egocentric and allocentric tuning matched
qualitatively. The theta domain was between ±180˚ binned at 1˚ intervals, and distance of
sound sources was not included in the simulation.
Allocentric.
Allocentric tuning describes the relationship between neural output
(reported here as spike probability; P) and sound source position within the world measured
in Cartesian (x, y) coordinates. Spatial tuning was simulated as the dot product of spike proba-
bility vectors returned from functions defined separately for positions on the x- and y-axes:

 With μ = 1,000 mm and s = 400 mm for the x-axis, and μ = 0 mm and s = 1,000 mm for the y-
axis. For both axes, spike probability vectors were generated for domains between ±1,500 mm
binned at 2-mm intervals.
Stimulus presentation, head pose, and movement.
The position and orientation of the
subject’s head within the world was described as a coordinate frame transform composed of
a translation vector between origins (indicating the head position) and a rotation matrix
between axes (indicating the head direction). Stimuli were presented on each time-step of the
simulation from each speaker in a ring at 10˚ intervals, 1,000 mm from the origin of the world
coordinate frame. As the simulation was deterministic, each stimulus was presented to static
simulations only once to calculate the response. When simulating motion, a “pirouette” trajec-
tory was constructed in which the subject’s head translated on a circular trajectory (radius = 50
mm; angular speed = 30˚ per time-step) while simultaneously rotating (angular speed = 10˚
per time-step) for 7,200 stimulus presentations (S2 Video). For each stimulus presentation, the
stimulus angle was calculated relative to both the midline of the head and the vertical axis of
the arena (S11 Fig). Simulation responses were quantized in 1˚ bins.
Animals
Subjects were 5 pigmented female ferrets (1–5 years old) trained in a variety of psychophysical
tasks that did not involve the stimuli presented or the experimental chamber used in the cur-
rent study. Each ferret was chronically implanted with Warp-16 microdrives (Neuralynx, MT),
housing 16 independently moveable tungsten microelectrodes (WPI Inc., FL) positioned over
middle and posterior fields of left or right auditory cortex. Details of the surgical procedures for
implantation and confirmation of electrode position are described elsewhere [54]. The weight
and water consumption of all animals were measured throughout the experiment. Regular oto-
scopic examinations were performed to ensure the cleanliness and health of ferrets’ ears.
Subjects were water-restricted prior to testing, during which time they explored the experi-
mental arena to find freely available sources of water. On each day of testing, subjects received
a minimum of 60 ml/kg of water either during testing or supplemented as a wet mash made
from water and ground high-protein pellets. Subjects were tested in morning and afternoon
sessions on each day for up to 3 days in a week (i.e., a maximum of 6 consecutive testing ses-
sions); on the remaining weekdays, subjects obtained water in performance of other psycho-
physical tasks. Test sessions lasted between 10 minutes and 50 minutes and were ended when
the animal lost interest in exploring the arena.
Experimental design and stimuli
In each test session, a ferret was placed within a D-shaped arena (Fig 2a, rectangular section:
35 cm x 30 cm [width x length]; semi-circular section: 17.5 cm radius; 50 cm tall) with 7 speak-
ers positioned at 30˚ intervals, 26 cm away from a central pillar from which the animal could
find water. The periphery of the circular half of the arena was also fitted with spouts from
which water could be obtained. Animals were encouraged either to explore the arena by deliv-
ery of water at all spouts, or to hold their head at the center spout by restricted water delivery
at this location. The arena and speakers were housed within a sound-attenuating chamber
lined with 45-mm sound-absorbing foam.
During exploration (n = 57 test sessions), clicks were presented from each speaker with ran-
dom inter-stimulus intervals (250–500 ms). The instantaneous energy of clicks minimized
dynamic cues, simplifying neural analysis and comparisons with other work on spatial encod-
ing. Clicks were presented at 60 dB SPL when measured from the center of the arena using a
measuring amplifier (Bruel & Kjaer 2636). However, because sound level varied across the

 arena, we roved sound levels over a ±6 dB range to reduce changes in level arising from differ-
ences in position of the head within the sound field. The frequency response of each speaker
(Visaton SC 5.9) was measured using golay codes [55] and compensated for, to produce a flat
spectral output between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Stimulus location and water delivery were inde-
pendent and subjects were not required to attend to stimuli in order to find water rewards. To
avoid characterizing neural responses to the sound of solenoid control signals, stimulus pre-
sentation and water reward were delivered in separate, alternating time windows; water was
delivered in a short period of 1 to 2 seconds when each solenoid was rapidly opened (100 ms
duration) with a 10-second interval between delivery windows in which click stimuli were pre-
sented. Sessions typically lasted approximately 15–20 minutes (median = 16.5 minutes;
range = 6.15–48.0 minutes) in which several thousand stimuli could be presented
(median = 1984; range = 304–3937).
Head tracking
During exploration of the experimental arena, the animal’s head position and orientation were
tracked using 2 LEDs (red and green) placed along the midline of the head and recorded using
a RV2 video acquisition system (TDT) sampling at 30 frames per second and synchronized
with the electrophysiology recording hardware. For each video frame, the red and green LED
positions were identified in Matlab from a weighted image in which the channel color of the
target LED was positively weighted and all other channels negatively weighted. Each LED posi-
tion was then taken as the center of the largest cluster of pixels containing the maximum
weighted value. To maximize the frame rate of the camera, we recorded with a low-exposure
time (10–20 ms). Lower exposure also improved LED identification by reducing signal inten-
sity in the background of each frame.
In cases in which a LED went out of view of the camera (usually due to the roll or pitch of
the head, or the recording cables obscuring the LED), the maximum weighted value identified
as the LED would be a random point within the arena, resulting either from a weak reflection
or image noise. To remove such data, we set a minimum-intensity threshold based on the dis-
tribution of maximum values in weighted images across all frames. In cases in which the LED
intensity failed to match the specified threshold, the LED position was noted as missing. To
compensate for missing data, we estimated LED positions across runs of up to a maximum of
10 frames (333 ms) using spline interpolation. Longer runs of missing data were discarded.
We then mapped each LED position in the image (M) into the behavioral arena to give the
new position N using the transformation:
N ¼ T þ RM
ð5Þ
Where T is the translation between the origin of the image coordinate frame (i.e., pixel [0,0])
and the origin of the arena coordinate frame (the center of the arena). And, R is the three-
dimensional rotation matrix describing the rotation between the arena and image coordinate
frames.T was obtained by manually identifying the pixel closest to the center of the arena (i.e.,
the equidistant point between all speakers) in a calibration image captured at the start of each
test session. R was estimated from singular value decomposition using the position and dis-
tance between known points in the arena (also identified manually from each calibration
image). Here, we estimated a 3D rotation matrix to take into account the position of the cam-
era relative to the arena (i.e., above the arena rather than below). All coordinate frames were
represented using the right-hand rule (i.e., positive values for counter-clockwise rotation
about the z-axis) to ensure consistency with the atan2 function.

 The animal’s head position ðAH
�!Þ was then calculated as the midpoint between the LEDs
within the arena and was used to define the origin of the head-centered coordinate frame
(S11 Fig). The animal’s head direction (θHA) was calculated from the two argument arctangent
function (atan2) of the vector between LEDs that defined the midline (y-axis) of the head-cen-
tered coordinate frame ðb
jHÞ. The z-axis was undefined by the tracking system, as we only mea-
sured 2 points (red and green LEDs) with a single camera; this led to ambiguity about the pitch
and roll of the head. To compensate for this deficiency, we assumed that when LEDs were visi-
ble, the xy plane of the head always matched the plane of the arena floor and that the z-axis of
the head was orthogonal to this plane and oriented towards the camera. Such assumptions are
justified by the properties of the tracking system—as the head rolls or pitches away from the
assumed conditions, it becomes impossible to identify both LEDs within the image due to the
limited angular range of the each diode. Therefore, tracking was impossible (in which case
data was discarded) in the same conditions in which our assumptions became untenable.
By using the frame times recorded on the device, it was possible to create a time series of
head position and direction within the arena that could be compared to the spiking pattern of
neurons. We used the inter-frame interval and change in position of the head origin, smoothed
with a 9-point Hann window to calculate the speed of head movement.
Neural recording
Neural activity in auditory cortex was recorded continuously throughout exploration. On each
electrode, voltage traces were recorded using TDT System III hardware (RX8 and RZ2) and
OpenEx software (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) with a sample rate of 25 kHz. For
extraction of action potentials, data were band-pass filtered between 300 Hz and 5,000 Hz, and
motion artifacts were removed using a decorrelation procedure applied to all voltage traces
recorded from the same microdrive in a given session [56]. For each channel within the array,
we identified candidate events as those with amplitudes between −2.5 and −6 times the RMS
value of the voltage trace and defined waveforms of events using a 32-sample window centered
on threshold crossings. Waveforms were then interpolated (128 points) and candidate events
combined across sessions within a test run for spike sorting. Waveforms were sorted using
MClust (A.D. Redish, University of Minnesota, http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/
MClust/) so that candidate events were assigned to either single unit, multi-unit clusters, or
residual hash clusters. Single units were defined as those with less than 1% of inter-spike inter-
vals shorter than 1 millisecond. In total, 331 units were recorded, including 116 single units
(35.1%).
Tracking unit identity across recording sessions
Through the experiment, electrodes were descended progressively deeper into cortex at inter-
vals of 50–100 μm to ensure sampling of different neural populations. At most recording sites,
we tested animals on multiple sessions (1–6 sessions) across several (1–3) consecutive days.
Conducting test sessions over multiple days makes possible the recording of different units at a
single recording site over time (i.e., through electrode drift, gliosis, etc.). To constrain our anal-
ysis to units with a consistent identity, we tracked the waveform of recorded units across ses-
sions within a test run. Our rationale was that a unit should have a constant waveform shape
across test sessions, and any differences in waveform shape should be small relative to differ-
ences in the waveforms of units measured on other electrodes or at other depths by the same
electrode. Thus, for one test session at a given recording site, we calculated the Euclidean dis-
tance matrix between the mean waveform recorded on that session (WTest) and the mean
waveform recorded on each additional session at the same recording site (DTest). We also

 calculated the distances between WTest and the mean waveform recorded for every session at
different recording sites (DControl). DControl provided null distributions for waveform distances
between pairs of neurons known to have separate identities (due to the spatial separation
between electrodes at recording sites [>50 μm in depth, >500 μm laterally]). For a given wave-
form, we then calculated the statistical probability of observing distances between test wave-
form and waveforms at the same recording site, given the distribution of distances between
test waveforms and waveforms at other recording sites. For waveforms exceeding statistical
significance (t test; p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for the number of sessions conducted at the
recording site), we concluded that the same neuron or neuronal population was recorded.
For runs of test sessions, we took the longest continuous run for which waveform distances
were significantly smaller than expected by chance. The majority of units tested more than
once could be tracked over all sessions tested (72.4%: 126/174 units), although the number of
neurons tracked fell off with time.
Data analysis
During exploration, we characterized sound-evoked responses from auditory cortical units.
Each click stimulus and the concomitant neural response could be related to controlled vari-
ables determined by the experimental design and measured variables observed from head
tracking. Controlled variables were the position of the sound source relative to the arena and
sound source level in dB SPL, whereas measured variables were the position and direction of
the head relative to the arena, as well as head speed. Controlled and measured variables were
combined to determine several experimental parameters: Stimulus position relative to the
head was calculated as the vector HS
�!:
HS
�! ¼ AS
�! � AH
�!
ð6Þ
Where AH
�! is the vector from arena origin to head origin and AS
�! is the vector from arena ori-
gin to the sound source. Stimulus angle relative to the head (θHS) was calculated by subtracting
head direction in the arena (θHA) from the stimulus angle relative to the origin of the head
coordinate frame:
yHS ¼ atan2ðHS
�!
y; HS
�!
xÞ �
yHA
ð7Þ
The distance between head and stimulus was calculated as the magnitude of HS

To calculate sound level at the head, sound pressure at the head was calculated by multiply-
ing the pressure measured at the arena origin during calibration (pA) by the ratio of the dis-
tances from arena origin to speaker ðj AS
�!jÞ and from head to speaker ðjHS

and sound level is expressed in dB SPL:

ð9Þ
Sound level was calibrated to 60 dB SPL (0.02 Pa) at the center of the arena.
For each variable, we calculated the value at the time of stimulus presentation (i.e., with a
lag of 0 ms) and contrasted these values with the spiking responses of neurons. To study

 encoding of stimulus features (both measured and control variables) by neurons, single trial
responses of individual units were summarized as the mean firing rate 0–50 ms after stimulus
onset. This window was sufficiently long to characterize the response of units (S5 and S7 Figs)
but also short enough that changes in head direction and position during the analysis window
were small (S3 Fig). Sound-responsive units (268/336) were first identified as those with
evoked firing rates that differed significantly from background activity measured in the 50 ms
before stimulus presentation (GLM analysis of deviance using Poisson distributions and log
link function; p � 0.05).
Spatially tuned units were then identified using sound-evoked responses collected with
the animal at the center of the arena, with the head and world coordinate frames in approxi-
mate alignment. For a stimulus presentation to be included in this analysis, the animal’s head
origin was required to be within 5 cm of a point 2.5 cm behind the arena center (S4 Fig). The
2.5-cm offset was applied to provide an approximate account for the distance between the
animal’s snout and head center. Head direction was also required to be within ±15˚ of the
midline of the arena (i.e., the line of symmetry of the arena, so that the animal was facing for-
ward). Sound-evoked responses under these constraints were then fitted with a GLM (Pois-
son distribution; log link function) with sound source angle relative to the head binned in
30˚ intervals as predictor. To ensure adequate data for statistical testing, units were only
assessed if responses were recorded for �5 stimulus presentations in each angular bin
(186/268 units). Units for which sound source angle significantly reduced model deviance
(χ2 distribution, p � 0.05) were classed as spatially tuned (92/186 units). While this approach
may not identify all spatially informative neurons (some of which may signal sound location
by spike timing rather than rate [18,57] or that may be tuned only to sounds behind the head
that were not sampled by speakers in the aligned condition), it identified a subpopulation of
spatially sensitive units on which further analysis could be performed.
To calculate spatial tuning curves, analysis was expanded to include all head positions and
directions recorded. To calculate world-based tuning curves, mean firing rate across trials (0–
50 ms) was plotted for each sound source angle relative to the arena. For head-based tuning
curves, sound source angle relative to the head was binned at 30˚ intervals and mean spike rate
plotted as a function of the bin center angle. To study super-resolution tuning of egocentric
units (Fig 5a and 5b), the bin width used to calculate curves was reduced to 20˚, 10˚, 5˚, 2˚, or
1˚. To compare spatial tuning of egocentric units with other studies, we also calculated pre-
ferred location, modulation depth, tuning width, and equivalent rectangular receptive field
(ERRF) width for spatial tuning curves calculated relative to the head across 360˚, according to
the methods used for awake cats [15,18]. For allocentric units, we calculated preferred location
and modulation depth for across sound location in the world.
Modulation depth analysis
For each unit, we calculated the depth of spatial modulation for tuning curves in each coordi-
nate frame. Unless otherwise stated, modulation depth (MD) was calculated as:
MD ¼ maxðxÞ �
minðxÞ
max ðxÞ
� 100
ð10Þ
Where x is the vector of firing rates in response to sounds located in each 30˚ bin between
±90˚ either of the world or head coordinate frame.
Modulation depth could also be calculated for simulated neurons using the same equation
but with x being a vector of spike probabilities. This approach allowed us to calculate modula-
tion depth for simulated allocentric and egocentric units when presented with sounds during

 observed animal movement (Fig 3). In simulations, modulation depth could be calculated in
head and world coordinate frames that were either relevant or irrelevant for neural activity,
depending on whether the simulation was allocentric or egocentric. We termed modulation
depth in the irrelevant coordinate frame residual modulation when expressed as a ratio of
modulation in the represented coordinate frame:
Residual Modulation ¼ MDIrrelevant
MDRelevant
ð11Þ
For allocentric simulations, the world was relevant and the head was irrelevant; whereas,
for egocentric simulations, the head was relevant and the world was irrelevant.
For each test session in which we observed animal behavior, we compared the relationship
between the residual modulation calculated during simulations of both allocentric and egocen-
tric units, with the standard deviation of the head directions (σ, Fig 3). We fitted a linear
regression model to this relationship that was subsequently used to test if observed modulation
depth values of real units were significantly greater than the residual modulation expected
from the animal’s behavior. The linear regression model was fitted using the fitlm function in
Matlab (R2015a). For each observed unit, we measured the standard deviation of head angles
during neural testing (σ) and, together with the regression models, predicted the 95% or
99.95% (post-Bonferroni correction for 92 units) confidence interval of residual modulation
values in the head and in the world coordinate frame. Prediction was performed in Matlab
using the predict function with the most conservative options selected (simultaneous confi-
dence bounds and prediction for new observations rather than fitted mean values) to give the
widest confidence intervals and thus minimize the probability of false positives. If the observed
modulation depth of a unit in a particular coordinate frame exceeded the upper bound of the
confidence interval for that frame, we identified it as significantly modulated.
GLMs
To compare the relationship between single trial firing rates and sound source angles in the
head and world coordinate frames, we fitted the average firing rate on each trial (0–50 ms)
with a generalized linear regression model (Matlab, fitglm function: Poisson distribution, log
link function). For both sound source angles relative to the head and relative to the world, we
measured the deviance of models fitted separately with each parameter (DTest). The AIC [24]
was used to compare test models and distinguish allocentric and egocentric units as those for
which sound source angle relative to the world or head, respectively, provided the best model.
For all but 1 unit that was excluded from further analysis, either sound source angle relative to
the world or head improved model fit compared to a constant model (analysis of deviance;
Bonferroni correction for 2 comparisons; p < 0.05).
To visualize GLM performance (Fig 6), we calculated model fit for each unit and coordi-
nate frame as:
Model Fit ¼ DConst � DTest
DConst � DFull
ð12Þ
Where Dconst was the deviance resulting from a constant model, and DFull was the deviance
resulting from a full linear model that included both sound source angle relative to the head
and relative to the world. We compared the model fit for data obtained when the head and
world coordinate frames were free to vary and when we restricted data to cases when the head
and world coordinate frames were aligned (see above). We also repeated our analysis but with
speaker identity or head direction information randomly shuffled between stimulus

 presentations prior to calculation of spatial tuning curves. Shuffling was repeated 1,000 times
and, across shuffles, we calculated the median model fit in head and world coordinate frames.
Here we used the median rather than mean of the permuted values across shuffles, which were
not always normally distributed. To test the effect of shuffle on model fit of all units, we per-
formed a 2-way anova on change in model fit with shuffle, with coordinate frame (head/
world) and unit class (egocentric/allocentric). Post hoc tests were conducted on change in
model fit versus 0 (t test) with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
For each analysis in which we calculated model fit, we also calculated model preference as:
Model Preference ¼ Model FitHead �
Model FitWorld
ð13Þ
Model preference could thus vary between −100% (better fit for neural data based on sound
angle in the world) and +100% (better fit for neural data based on sound angle relative to the
head).
For time-based comparison of model performance, we reduced the time over which firing
rates were considered (from 50 ms to 20 ms) and repeated the analysis with a window offset by
−60 ms to 90 ms after stimulus presentation that moved with a 2-ms interval. Model fit and
preference values for allocentric and egocentric units were compared across time using a non-
parametric cluster-based statistical test [26], implemented in Matlab through the FieldTrip
toolbox [58].

ers positioned at equal intervals around the animal’s head in the azimuthal plane. As we used
only 7 speakers over a range of 180˚, this reflects an order of magnitude (x 10) increase in
spatial resolution. Data shown as mean ± s.e.m firing rate in Cartesian or polar coordinates.
Scale bars indicate firing rates of 20 Hz. Data available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.
