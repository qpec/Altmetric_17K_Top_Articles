Background:
It is beneficial to evaluate changes in neuroscience research field
regarding research directions and topics over a defined period. Such information
enables stakeholders to quickly identify the most influential research and incorporate
latest evidence into research-informed education. To our knowledge, no study reported
changes in neuroscience literature over the last decade. Therefore, the current study
determined research terms with highest citation scores, compared publication shares of
research areas and contributing countries in this field from 2006 to 2015 and identified
the most productive journals.
Methods: Data were extracted from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports (JCR).
Only articles and reviews published in journals classified under the JCR “Neurosciences”
category over the period of interest were included. Title and abstract fields of each
included publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer to identify recurring
terms with high relative citation scores. Two term maps were produced for publications
over the study period to illustrate the extent of co-occurrence, and the impact of terms
was evaluated based on their relative citation scores. To further describe the recent
research priority or “hot spots,” 10 terms with the highest relative citation scores were
identified annually. In addition, by applying Bradford’s law, we identified 10 journals being
the most productive journals per annum over the survey period and evaluated their
bilbiometric performances.
Results: From 2006 to 2015, there were 47 terms involved in the annual lists of top
10 terms with highest relative citation scores. The most frequently recurring terms were
autism (8), meta-analysis (7), functional connectivity (6), default mode network (4) and
neuroimaging (4). Neuroscience research related to psychology and behavioral sciences
showed an increase in publication share over the survey period, and China has become
one of the major contributors to neuroscience research. Ten journals were frequently
identified (≥8 years) as core journals within the survey period.
Discussion:
The landscape of neuroscience research has changed recently, and
this paper provides contemporary overview for researchers and health care workers
interested in this field’s research and developments. Brain imaging and brain connectivity
terms had high relative citation scores.

Neuroscience from 2006 to 2015
INTRODUCTION
Neuroscience is an exciting research field, and many recent
discoveries have informed paradigm-shifts and innovations. For
instance, the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
was awarded to Professors John O’Keefe, May-Britt Moser
and Edvard Moser, neuroscientists who discovered place cells
and grid cells that form a built-in, global positioning system
inside the brain (O’keefe and Burgess, 2005; Moser et al.,
2008). Indeed, neuroscience research has received substantial
support across the globe. In the United States, the Human
Connectome Project was launched in 2009 (Battery, 2010),
followed by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative in 2013 (Insel et al., 2013).
Concurrently, the Human Brain Project was initiated in Europe
(Markram, 2012). In Japan, the Brain Mapping by Integrated
Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS) program
started in 2014, and the Brain Science and Brain-Like Intelligence
Technology project will soon be officially launched by China,
though significant preliminary research has already been done
(Grillner et al., 2016). With these abundant investments in
neuroscience in recent years, more explorative, fundamental
or basic research could be conducted, which eventually led to
today’s paradigm shifts—or paradigm shifts yet to come. For
instance, the emergence of brain connectivity studies (Friston,
2011) in recent years may enable us to compare and contrast the
normal and diseased brains, and thus identify abnormal brain
connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers for neurologic
diseases. These advances in the neuroscience field not only
drive significant progress in brain biology but also confer
practical implications to medicine. We should evaluate and
track the changes regarding the landscape of neuroscience
research, to indicate evolution regarding research directions,
health care priorities and prime translational research topics
over a defined period. Such information enables stakeholders
to clearly and quickly identify the most influential research
works and incorporate the latest evidence into research-informed
education.
Bibliometric studies could provide relevant evaluations and
assessments of the social and scientific relevance of a specific
discipline or research field of interest (López-Muñoz et al.,
2006, 2014). There have been numerous bibliometric studies
on the performance of neuroscience research outputs in
specific countries, including China (Xu et al., 2003), India
(Shahabuddin, 2013) and Sweden (Glänzel et al., 2003). In
addition, similar studies have been conducted in relevant
research fields such as psychiatry and psychopharmacology
(López-Muñoz et al., 2006, 2014). However, to our knowledge,
no published study has reported overall changes in the landscape
of neuroscience literature across the globe over the last
decade.
Therefore, the aims of this study was to identify the most
productive core journals in the field from 2006 to 2015,
determine the research terms with the highest citation impact,
and compare the publication shares of research areas and
contributing countries across these 10 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Date Source
Data analyzed in this study were extracted from Web of Science
(WoS) and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Both required a
subscription and were hosted by Thomson Reuters.
Data Extraction
Publications indexed in WoS were included if they were: (1)
articles or reviews; (2) published in journals under the JCR
“Neurosciences” category; and (3) published from 2006 to 2015.
Full records and cited references of the included publications
were manually downloaded. The analyses at the literature level
(term maps, annual high-impact terms and changes in research
areas and contributing countries) were based on all these records;
and for each publication, citations were counted until the end of
November, 2016.
Term Maps
For each year, the title and abstract fields of each included
publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer (van
Eck and Waltman, 2009). Two term maps, one for 2006 and
one for 2015, were produced to illustrate a network of recurring
keywords, showing their co-occurrence and relative citation
impacts. The details of the established methods and algorithms
have been described in previous publications (van Eck et al.,
2010; Waltman et al., 2010). In brief, for each term map, only
terms that occurred at least 100 times under binary counting
were considered. Note that binary counting only considers the
number of publications in which a term was present; it disregards
the number of occurrences of a term within a single publication.
General noun phrases were removed using an algorithm (van
Eck and Waltman, 2011). Of the remaining terms, 500 with
the highest relevance score calculated via VOSviewer were used
to form a term map to allow for network visualization. The
algorithm was designed to ensure that terms that co-occurred
more frequently were positioned closer to each other. Terms
that occurred more frequently had larger bubbles. Before the
final map was created, we visually inspected the map, removed
irrelevant terms and combined the abbreviated forms of the noun
phrases (Heersmink et al., 2011). Depending on the citation
counts of the respective publications, each term received a
relative citation score (beginning at zero) that is represented
by color. Blue (0) indicates below average, green (1) indicates
average and red (≥2) indicates above average. The coloring
scheme was based on previous publications (van Eck et al., 2013;
Waltman et al., 2014).
Annual High-Impact Terms
For each year, we examined terms that occurred at least 100 times.
We then used VOSviewer to calculate a relative citation score for
each term based on citation counts. Normalized citation score
based on average citation counts is one of the key concepts in
bibliometrics (Waltman, 2016). The calculation was performed as
follows. For each year, each publication was given a normalized
citation score by dividing its number of citations (received in
Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org
2
March 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 120
 Yeung et al.
Neuroscience from 2006 to 2015
that year) by the average number of citations of all publications
(received in that year) of the neuroscience field. A score of 1
implies the citation count of that particular publication equals
the average of all publications appearing in neuroscience field
in that year. Subsequently, each term received its own relative
citation score by averaging the normalized citation scores of all
publications in which the term occurred in the title or abstract.
Previous studies have documented the details of this automated
procedure to identify terms with higher-than-average citation
scores (van Eck et al., 2013; Waltman et al., 2014). We identified
10 relevant terms with the highest relative citation score (highest
impact) for each year in the survey period. Their relative citation
scores were tracked annually.
Growth of Publication
Price’s Law, one of the most widely utilized indicators for
analyzing the growth of publication within a specific research
field, which was regularly applied to evaluate whether publication
in a research field has experienced an exponential growth over
a pre-defined survey period (López-Muñoz et al., 2006, 2014),
was utilized to assess the annual change in publication count
in neuroscience journals in the current study. After plotting the
annual publication count (y) against year (x), we applied the best-
fitting linear and exponential trend lines to the plot and recorded
the mathematical equations forming the trend lines. If the data
fitted better to the exponential line than the linear line, results
will be considered as fulfilling the Price’s Law.
Changes in Research Areas and
Contributing Countries
We identified the research areas and contributing countries
of the publications in 2006 and 2015, the first and last year
of the study period, respectively. These data were obtained
by analyzing the search results in WoS. In WoS, publications
(according to the journals where they were published) were
classified into over 250 research areas in which each area contains
papers similar in scope and citation characteristics1. To illustrate
the relationship with social-health parameters, the relationship
between the publication shares of the most productive countries
and their respective total per capita expenditure on health2 were
evaluated, as described in previous bibliometric studies (López-
Muñoz et al., 2006, 2008a, 2014).
Core Journals under Bradford’s Law and
Their Performance
For each year, Bradford’s law of scattering was applied to identify
the core journals in the neuroscience category. The core journals
identified for each year are those that contributed one-third of
total publications for that year (Vickery, 1948). To evaluate the
bibliometric performance of the top 10 core journals (the 10
journals with highest frequency of occurrence in the annual core
journal lists over the survey period), time trends of their Impact
Factor (IF), Immediacy Index (II), and Eigenfactor Score (ES)
1http://ipscience-help.thomsonreuters.com/inCites2Live/filterValuesGroup/
researchAreaSchema.html
2Data available from http://www.who.int/countries/en/
were evaluated. IF indicates the yearly average citation count of
its recent publications, II refers to the average citation count of
current-year publications and ES, though similar to IF, weights
citations according to the ranking of the citing journals. The
time trends of IF, II, and ES were evaluated by separate linear
regressions, with year as the independent variable (López-Abente
and Muñoz-Tinoco, 2005; Jayaratne and Zwahlen, 2015). The
slope, β, indicated the average magnitude of change over time,
and R2 indicated the fitness of the regression model. Statistical
analyses were performed with SPSS 23.0 (IBM, New York, USA).
Results were significant if P < 0.05.
RESULTS
From 2006 to 2015, a total of 340,210 publications matched with
the selection criteria of this study (all articles and reviews in
JCR “Neurosciences” category), of which 305,175 were articles
and 35,035 were reviews. The marked annual increase in
the number of neuroscience publications from 2006 to 2015
followed a linear trend more closely than an exponential curve
(Supplementary Figure 1). The linear fitting of the data obtained
a coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.9959, whereas the
exponential fitting only obtained a coefficient of determination
of r2 = 0.9914.
Term Maps
The term maps for 2006 and 2015 are shown in Figure 1. For both
maps, terms on the left are more related to cellular, molecular
or genetic neuroscience research using animal models, such as
cell, protein, receptor, expression and mice. Terms on the right
are more related to brain imaging involving humans, such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), perception, task,
performance and patient. For 2006, the red and orange bubbles
are more concentrated on the right side of the map, e.g., fMRI
and neuroimaging. For 2015, the red and orange bubbles are
more concentrated on the left side of the map, e.g., microglia and
neuroinflammation. Across the survey period, some of the basic
terms remained red and orange, such as inflammation, microglia,
mitochondria and tau. Clinical terms remained blue and green,
such as mortality, multiple sclerosis, intracerebral hemorrhage
and ischemic stroke.
Annual High-Impact Terms
Ten relevant terms with highest impact were identified for each
year from 2006 to 2015; they are listed in Table 1. There were
47 terms over the survey period (Table 1). The most frequently
recurring term was autism (top 10 in 8 years out of 10). Next
were meta-analysis (7 years out of 10), functional connectivity
(6 years out of 10), default mode network (4 years out of 10)
and neuroimaging (4 years out of 10). Over the last 3 years
(2013–2015), three terms appeared on the top 10 list: melatonin,
microglia and neurofibrillary tangle.

relative citation impact attributable to the terms, with blue indicating below average, green indicating average and red indicating above average. Moving from 2006 to
2015, it could be observed that the terms on the left were gaining relative citation impact compared to the terms on the right. Certain terms remained having relatively
high citation scores, such as inflammation, microglia, mitochondria and tau (colored red and orange). Some remained having relatively low citation scores, such as
ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality.

(2,762/29,379, Table 2). In 2015, its share reduced to 7.35%
(2,852/38,792) apparently as a result of 32.0% increase in total
publication. It was replaced by psychology (3,076/38,792) as
the most productive research area. By 2015, ophthalmology
and zoology no longer occupied a place on the list, and they
were replaced by immunology and “geriatrics, gerontology.” In
fact, the publication share of “geriatrics, gerontology” in 2015
(676/38,792) was 1.74%, two times of that in 2006 (205/29,379).
Most Productive Countries
The United States remained the leading country in neuroscience
research output over the 10-year survey period. Despite a
reduction in its publication share, the United States still
accounted for 37% (14,279/38,792) of total publications and
was the largest contributor in 2015. European countries,
such as Germany and the United Kingdom, were also major
contributors to the field. One country with a substantial increase
in publication share was China: Between 2006 and 2015, its
publication share in this field tripled (2006: 870/29,379 =
2.96%, vs. 2015: 4,358/38,792 = 11.23%, Table 3). With regard
to social-health data, it seemed that the publication shares
of the most productive countries were directly proportional
to their respective total per capita expenditure on health
(Supplementary Figure 2). However, if data from China and
United States were excluded, the relationship became much less
apparent.

Identification of Core Journals under
Bradford’s Law
The number of neuroscience journals increased from 200 in
2006 to 256 in 2015. In parallel, the number of core journals
doubled from 11 (11/200 = 5.5%) in 2006 to 22 (22/256 =
8.6%) in 2015 (Table 4). Six journals were consistently included
as core journals throughout 2006–2015, namely Brain Research,
Journal of Neurophysiology, Journal of Neuroscience, NeuroImage,
Neuroscience, and Neuroscience Letters. Together with four
other journals, namely Behavioural Brain Research (9 years),
Experimental Brain Research (9 years), European Journal of
Neuroscience (8 years), and Journal of the Neurological Sciences
(8 years), they formed the top ten core neuroscience journals.
The complete list of 33 core neuroscience journals is presented
in Supplementary Table 1.
Bibliometric Performance of Core Journals
In general, the core journals maintained their performance levels
over the survey period. Most (7/10) core journals did not exhibit
a significant change in IF from 2006 to 2015 (Figure 2A). One
journal, Brain Research, had a significantly improved IF (β =
0.06, P < 0.01), whereas two journals experienced a significant
decrease in IF, namely Journal of Neurophysiology (β = −0.11,
P < 0.001) and Journal of Neuroscience (β = −0.16, P < 0.001).
Six of the core journals did not have a significant change
in II over the survey period (Figure 2B). Three journals had
significantly improved II, namely Brain Research (β = 0.03, P =
0.01), NeuroImage (β = 0.07, P < 0.01) and Neuroscience Letters
(β = 0.01, P = 0.05). One journal, Journal of Neurophysiology,
had a decreased II (β = −0.03, P < 0.01).
In terms of ES, most (7/10) core journals were subject to a
decrease, and only two an increase (Figure 2C). However, these
changes were small (β = −0.02–0.00).
DISCUSSION
Using data from WoS and JCR, the results of the current
study revealed transformations in the field of neuroscience
research from 2006 to 2015 in terms of leading or core journals,

According to Bradford’s law, journals were divided into three zones, and each zone
should contain one-third of total publication count. Zone 1 journals were identified as
core journals. Publication count here refers to the total count of articles and reviews.
distribution of publications, research context and contributions
by country. No attempt was made to retrospectively analyze data
earlier than 2006, because this study’s focus only concerns recent
bibliometric growth rather than the complete history of this
research field. The annual growth of neuroscience publications
over the survey period indicated non-fulfillment of Price’s Law,
i.e., no exponential growth was observed. It experienced a
linear growth instead. This linear increment was consistent with
publications in adjacent research fields such as psychiatry (López-
Muñoz et al., 2008b) and psychopharmacology (López-Muñoz
et al., 2013). On the other hand, there was an exponential
increase in publications in melatonin (López-Muñoz et al., 2016),
bipolar disorder (López-Muñoz et al., 2006) and attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (López-Muñoz et al., 2008a). Since
the current study aimed at providing an overview of the
neuroscience literature, we did not apply Lotka’s Law to evaluate
the productivity of individual researchers.
Shifting of Citation Focus as Seen from
Term Maps
The term maps from Figure 1 illustrated the shift of citation
focus from general brain imaging terms to cellular, molecular and
genetic terms. In recent years, molecular imaging of the brain
is gaining attention, such as that related to neuroinflammation
of microglia and macrophages (Venneti et al., 2013) and
neurodegeneration related to tau protein and Lewy body
(Wakabayashi et al., 2013). These research topics investigated
in experimental animal models probably led to the increased
relative citation impacts of these terms. Certain clinical topics
remained having low citation impacts, such as multiple sclerosis,
intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke.
Brain Imaging Terms as Recurring
High-Impact Terms
Results in Table 1 demonstrated that brain imaging terms
occupied three of the top five recurring high-impact terms,
namely default mode network, functional connectivity and

neuroimaging. The rise in relative citation impact of brain
connectivity terms was consistent with the launches of several
research funds, including the aforementioned BRAIN Initiative,
Human Brain Project and Human Connectome Project. There
were two other terms related to brain connectivity among
the top 10 highest impact terms (diffusion tensor imaging
and fractional anisotropy). One popular research topic was
to investigate the co-activation (also known as functional
connectivity) of different brain regions (Yeung et al., 2017b).
One such network of co-activation during a resting state is
called the default mode network, which is believed to be robust
across populations, and, as a result, it has gained attention in
recent years (Raichle and Snyder, 2007). Another area that merits
mention is the advancement in the use of statistics, such as the
implementation of dynamic causal modeling to neuroimaging
data in 2003 (Friston et al., 2003), which have enabled an
inference of effective connectivity. This application illustrates the
directionality of communications between brain regions during
particular experimental tasks (Nakamura et al., 2013; Yeung et al.,
2016). Though the terms related to effective connectivity were not
in the annual top 10 lists of high-impact terms during the survey
period, they may well be a potential hot spot in the field in the
future (Friston, 2011).
The High Impact of Terms Related to
Alzheimer’s Disease Over the Last 3 Years
As reported, three terms always appeared on the top 10 list
of high-impact terms over the last 3 years, namely melatonin,
microglia and neurofibrillary tangle. Collectively, these three
terms are related to Alzheimer’s disease. Evidence has suggested
that Alzheimer’s disease, with intracellular neurofibrillary tangle
a widely recognized biomarker, is linked to neuroinflammatory
changes caused by overactivation of microglia that can be
alleviated by administration of melatonin (Smith et al., 2012; Lin
et al., 2013). This effect of melatonin may be related to regulation
of autophagy (Choi et al., 2013). Moreover, we identified Journal
of Alzheimer’s Disease as one of the core journals (2010–2015)
in the current study. Together, these findings suggest that topics
relevant to this disease have recently become high impact.
Attention to Autism
Autism appeared in the annual list of top 10 high-impact terms
eight times in the 10-year survey period. On average, its relative
citation score was 2.05 (citation count 2.05 times that of an
average term), outperforming the relative citation score of other
neurological disorders such as major depressive disorder (1.68)
and mild cognitive impairment (1.33).
Research Directions, Health Care Priorities
and Prime Translational Research Topics
Results of the current bibliometric study may help identify three
important areas of neuroscience research: research directions,
health care priorities and prime translational research topics.
First, with regard to research directions, it could be observed
that brain imaging was one of the highest impact over
the last decade. Looking at health care priorities, as it was
demonstrated that meta-analysis was a high-impact term in
neuroscience field, researchers may consider conducting more
meta-analyses to answer priority questions for better evidence-
based practices in health care industry or health care services.
As for prime translational research topics, brain connectivity had
high impact; thus, its aberrations among patients with various
neurodegenerative or neurological disorders can now be further
investigated.
Increased Publication Share of Geriatrics
and Gerontology
The publication share of geriatrics and gerontology doubled from
2006 to 2015. This was reasonably expected due to the aging
population of the developed countries. As the elderly people
are more prone to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (Clegg et al., 2013), the
citation impact of terms relevant to neurodegeneration and
neuroinflammation also increased over the study period.
The United States and European Countries
as Major Contributors
Despite changes in research hot spots, the most productive or
research-leading countries did not change significantly between
2006 and 2015. Developed countries, mainly ones in the Western
world, were still major contributors to neuroscience research, i.e.,
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Italy,
the United Kingdom and the United States. Incidentally, these
countries were also previously identified as major contributors
to various topics within or relevant to neuroscience, such as
neuroimaging (Kim et al., 2016; Yeung et al., 2017a) and
Parkinson’s disease (Li et al., 2008), which means these countries
may have relatively more established research backgrounds and
research funding. However, with more economic development
and financial input into academic research, China has emerged
as one of the important contributors in neuroscience research
field in recent years. The correlation of publication share in
neuroscience with the per capita health expenditure of the
most productive countries might be consistent with the notion
that the higher the spending on health, the more the research
publication (López-Muñoz et al., 2006, 2014). However, it should
be interpreted with caution because data from China and the
United States were relatively influential as potential outliers.
Growth in Publication and Stability of Key
Core Journals Identified by Bradford’s Law
The
annual
publication
(articles
and
reviews)
count
of
neuroscience research increased every year, as did the number of
neuroscience journals. By applying Bradford’s law of scattering,
we revealed that the percentage of journals classified as core
journals likewise increased over the study years. These changes
indicated that this field has been growing and becoming more
dispersed. Besides, the bibliometric performances of the key core
journals were mostly stable over the study period.
Implications and Future Perspectives
The shift of citation focus as seen from term maps and Table 1
indicated the importance of co-existing animal models and in
vitro studies together with human neuroimaging studies. While
Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

neuroimaging studies may continue to unveil the brain function
or neural mechanism of relevant physiological processes, animal
models and in vitro studies may also be required to explore and
explain the details down to genetic, cellular or molecular levels.
Moreover, with the increasing publication count and wider
distribution of publications among neuroscience journals, future
publications should devise keywords, titles and abstracts more
thoughtfully. Search strategy of fellow researchers should be
taken into careful consideration so that the relevant works can
be identified/retrieved from search engines or databases.
By considering the specific hot topics having high relative
citation scores altogether, future work may focus on utilizing
brain imaging and connectivity analyses to identify biomarkers
that may signify neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory
tendency among the aging population.
Study Limitations
This
study
has
certain
limitations.
First,
this
study
is
retrospective, and, though it tracked past or recent trends,
rapidly developing interests in a short (recent) period may not
be accurately reflected. Second, the work examined in this study
consists exclusively of articles and reviews published from 2006
to 2015 in JCR “Neurosciences” journals as indexed by WoS. It
may not be sufficient to represent all neuroscience literature, such
as other document formats published in journals or publications
not included in this study. As neuroscience interacts with many
other academic fields, some arguably relevant studies may
have been published in journals not classified as neuroscience
journals. However, it would be difficult to define search terms
that effectively cover all papers touching on neuroscience across
all scientific literature while simultaneously excluding irrelevant
ones. Therefore, we focused on JCR “Neurosciences” journals.
Third, the analyses in this study were based on data recorded in
the WoS database. Although Google Scholar and other databases
may offer broader coverage, much of this “extra” coverage may
be attributed to journals with potentially limited audience. Given
that we aimed to determine research changes in the core of the
neuroscience community, we followed previous neuroscience
bibliometric publications by only accessing WoS (Glänzel et al.,
2003; Li et al., 2008; Bishop, 2010). Therefore, the results from
the current study should be interpreted with considerations that
journals of other sections of JCR (pharmacology, diagnostic
imaging, biochemistry, biology, etc.) were not included. Future
studies may expand to them and consider the access to other
databases such as PubMed/Medline, Scopus or Embase when
deemed appropriate. Besides VOSviewer, future studies may
consider using other bibliometric tools to further dissect the
evidence, such as using Pajek to analyze the citation and
co-authorship networks of selected data subsets (Batagelj and
Mrvar, 1998), and using Publish or Perish3 to evaluate the
distribution of citations received by selected authors in terms of
h-index or g-index.

CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, our findings revealed changes in the landscape
of neuroscience research over the study period and provided a
contemporary overview of neuroscience research for researchers
and health care workers interested in this field. Brain imaging
and brain connectivity have been shown to be hot topics, and
Alzheimer’s disease and associated topics have recently gained
traction.

Supplementary Figure1 | Annual growth of neuroscience publication from
2006 to 2015. After plotting the annual publication count (y) against year (x), we
applied the best-fitting linear (solid) and exponential (dash) trend lines to the plot.
Results indicated the growth followed a linear trend (y = 1168.8x–2 × 106, r2 =
0.9959) more closely than an exponential trend (y = 7 × 10−28e0.0363x, r2 =
0.9914).
Supplementary Figure2 | The relationship between the neuroscience
publication share and the total per capita expenditure on health (USD$)
among the most productive countries as surveyed in 2006 and 2015.
The economic data was obtained from World Health Organization (http://www.
who.int/countries/en/). It seemed that the publication shares of the most
productive countries were directly proportional to their respective total per
capita expenditure on health (2006: r2 = 0.560, p = 0.005; 2015: r2 =
0.352, p = 0.054). However, if data from China and United States were
excluded, the relationship became much less apparent (2006: r2 = 0.008,
p = 0.817; 2015: r2 = 0.010, p = 0.800). AUS, Australia; CAN, Canada; CHI,
