Background: Little is known about the impact of urbanicity, 
adverse neighborhood conditions and violent crime victimiza-
tion on the emergence of adolescent psychotic experiences. 
 
Methods: Participants were from the Environmental Risk 
(E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representa-
tive cohort of 2232 British twins who were interviewed about 
adolescent psychotic experiences at age 18. Urbanicity, 
neighborhood characteristics, and personal victimization by 
violent crime were measured during childhood and adoles-
cence via geocoded census data, surveys of over 5000 imme-
diate neighbors of the E-Risk participants, and interviews 
with participants themselves.  Results: Adolescents raised in 
urban vs rural neighborhoods were significantly more likely 
to have psychotic experiences (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.21–
2.30, P = .002). This association remained significant after 
considering potential confounders including family socio-
economic status, family psychiatric history, and adolescent 
substance problems (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.01–2.03, P = 
.042), but became nonsignificant after considering adverse 
social conditions in urban neighborhoods such as low social 
cohesion and high neighborhood disorder (OR = 1.35, 
95% CI = 0.94–1.92, P = .102). The combined associa-
tion of adverse neighborhood social conditions and personal 
crime victimization with adolescent psychotic experiences 
(adjusted OR = 4.86, 95% CI = 3.28–7.20, P < .001) was 
substantially greater than for either exposure alone, high-
lighting a potential interaction between neighborhood con-
ditions and crime victimization (interaction contrast ratio 
= 1.81, 95% CI = −0.03 to 3.65) that was significant at the 
P = .054 level.  Conclusions: Cumulative effects of adverse 
neighborhood social conditions and personal victimiza-
tion by violent crime during upbringing partly explain why 
adolescents in urban settings are more likely to report psy-
chotic experiences. Early intervention efforts for psychosis 
could be targeted towards victimized youth living in urban 
and socially adverse neighborhoods.

Background
Up to 1 in 3 adolescents in the general population at some 
point experience subclinical psychotic phenomena such as 
attenuated forms of auditory hallucinations and paranoid 
delusions.1–4 Though relatively common, early psychotic 
experiences are associated with a greater adulthood risk 
for psychotic disorders and other psychiatric problems 
including substance abuse, depression, and suicidal behav-
ior.5–7 Because early intervention offers the best hope for 
improving outcomes in psychosis8 and adult psychopa-
thology more generally,9 it is crucial to understand how 
the wider structural and social environment may influence 
psychotic experiences among young people in order to 
design and effectively target preventive interventions.
To date, most prior research on the emergence of ado-
lescent psychotic experiences has focused on individual-
level risk factors10 and little is currently known about the 
potential impact of macro-level structures such as urba-
nicity and neighborhood-level social processes like social 
fragmentation and crime. These common forms of wider 
environmental exposures have been implicated in adult 
psychotic disorder,11–21 and adult psychosis shares simi-
lar social and behavioral risk factors as early psychotic

Neighborhoods, Crime, and Adolescent Psychotic Experiences
phenomena.10,22 Early expressions of psychosis are more 
likely to persist and reach clinical significance among 
urban vs nonurban youth,23,24 but the reasons for this are 
unclear. We previously showed that adverse neighbor-
hood social conditions in early childhood, such as low 
social cohesion and high crime, explained one quarter 
of the association between urbanicity and childhood psy-
chotic symptoms.25 Elucidating the role of macro- and 
neighborhood-level exposures in adolescent psychotic 
experiences could be particularly informative for early-
intervention efforts, because the clinical relevance of psy-
chotic phenomena increases later in adolescence.26
Cities (vs rural settings) have higher rates of violent 
crime27,28 and tend to be more threatening26 and less 
socially cohesive.25,29 Additionally, 16–24 year-olds in the 
United Kingdom are 3 times more likely than other age 
groups to be victimized by a violent crime.30 Therefore, 
many adolescents raised in cities are not only embedded 
in more socially adverse neighborhoods, but are also more 
likely be personally victimized by crime compared to other 
age groups and peers living in rural neighborhoods. Given 
that cumulative trauma (ie, an accumulation of stressful 
exposures such as social adversity and victimization) is 
implicated in risk for psychosis,31–34 we hypothesized that 
one of the reasons that young people in urban settings 
are at increased risk for psychotic phenomena is that they 
experience a greater accumulation of neighborhood-level 
social adversity and personal experiences of violence dur-
ing upbringing. No study has yet explored the potential 
cumulative effects of adverse neighborhood social condi-
tions and personal crime victimization on the emergence 
of psychotic experiences during adolescence.
The present study addresses this topic with data from 
a nationally-representative cohort of over 2000 British 
adolescents, who have been interviewed repeatedly up to 
age 18, with comprehensive assessments of victimization 
and psychotic experiences and high-resolution measures 
of the built and social environment. We asked: (1) Are 
psychotic experiences more common among adolescents 
raised in urban vs rural settings? And does this associa-
tion hold after controlling for neighborhood-level depri-
vation (ie, poverty), as well as individual- and family-level 
factors, that might otherwise explain the relationship? 
(2) Can the association between urban upbringing and 
adolescent psychotic experiences be explained by urban 
neighborhoods having lower levels of social cohesion and 
higher levels of neighborhood disorder (subsequently 
defined as exposure to neighborhood social adversity)? (3) 
Are psychotic experiences more common among adoles-
cents who have been personally victimized by a violent 
crime? And (4) Is there a cumulative effect of neighbor-
hood social adversity and personal crime victimization 
on adolescent psychotic experiences? In addition, the 
present study conducted sensitivity analyses using ado-
lescent psychotic symptoms as the outcome (which are 
psychotic experiences verified by clinicians).
Methods
Study Cohort
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk 
(E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the 
development of a nationally-representative birth cohort 
of 2232 British twin children born in 1994–1995 and ini-
tially assessed in home visits at age 5. Follow-up home-vis-
its were conducted when participants were aged 7, 10, 12, 
and 18 (participation rates were 98%, 96%, 96%, and 93%, 
respectively). At age 18, the E-Risk sample comprised 
2066 participants. All but 3 participants completed the 
psychotic experiences interview at age 18. The final sam-
ple for this study was therefore 2063 individuals, compris-
ing 55% monozygotic twin pairs and 48% males. There 
were no differences between those who did and did not 
take part at age 18 in terms of age-5 socioeconomic status 
(SES) (χ2 = 0.86, P = .65), age-5 IQ scores (t = 0.98, P = 
.33), or age-5 internalizing or externalizing behavior prob-
lems (t = 0.40, P = .69 and t = 0.41, P = .68, respectively). 
The Joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute 
of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each 
phase of the study. Parents gave informed consent, and 
participants gave assent at ages 5–12 and informed con-
sent at age 18. Full details about the sample are reported 
elsewhere,35 and in the supplementary materials.
Measures
Adolescent Psychotic Phenomena. The present study 
uses 2 measures of psychotic phenomena which were 
both obtained from private interviews when participants 
were aged 18.
Our primary outcome was a self-report measure of 
adolescent psychotic experiences which reflects the meth-
odology used by many groups in the psychosis prodrome 
research field.36 At age 18, each E-Risk participant was 
privately interviewed by a research worker about 13 psy-
chotic experiences occurring since age 12. Seven items 
pertained to delusions and hallucinations and this inter-
view has been described in detail previously22 and in the 
supplementary materials. Six items pertained to unusual 
experiences which drew on item pools since formalized in 
prodromal psychosis instruments including the PRIME-
screen and SIPS.36 These included “I worry that my food 
may be poisoned” and “My thinking is unusual or fright-
ening.” Interviewers coded each item 0, 1, 2 indicating 
respectively “not present,” “probably present” and “def-
initely present.” All 13 items were summed to create a 
psychotic experiences scale (range = 0–18, M = 1.19, 
SD = 2.58). Scores were placed into an ordinal scale. Just 
over 30% of participants had at least 1 psychotic expe-
rience between ages 12 and 18: 69.8% reported no psy-
chotic experiences (coded 0; n = 1440), 15.5% reported 
1 or 2 psychotic experiences (coded 1; n = 319), 8.1% 
reported 3 to 5 psychotic experiences (coded 2; n = 166),

J. Newbury et al
and 6.7% reported 6 or more psychotic experiences 
(coded 3; n = 138). This is similar to the prevalence of 
self-reported psychotic experiences in other community 
samples of teenagers and young adults.1–4
We additionally examined clinically-verified adolescent 
psychotic symptoms as a secondary outcome, using the 
same methodology as used at age 12.22 Responses to the 
7 hallucination/delusion items were verified by a team of 
clinicians, including child and adolescent psychiatrists, 
to capture more clinically pertinent psychotic symptoms. 
Full details on the verification procedure for adolescent 
psychotic symptoms are provided in the supplementary 
materials. At age 18, 2.9% (N = 59) of participants were 
designated as having experienced at least 1 definite psy-
chotic symptom.
Urbanicity. Urbanicity was defined based on data from 
the Office of National Statistics (ONS) Rural-Urban 
Definition for Small Area Geographies (RUC2011) clas-
sifications.37 The ONS classifications utilized 2011 census 
data. Detailed information on ONS’s creation of RUC2011 
is available on the ONS webpages (https://www.gov.uk/
government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/
file/239477/RUC11methodologypaperaug_28_Aug.pdf; 
this link was working on April 20, 2017) and in the sup-
plementary materials. ONS urbanicity scores (range 
1–10) were assigned to every E-Risk family via the fam-
ily’s postcode when participants were aged 12. Given 
the low numbers within some rural categories, urban-
icity was collapsed into 3 levels (1 = rural: all rural set-
tings; 2 = intermediate: urban cities and towns; and 3 = 
urban: major and minor conurbations [conurbations are 
densely populated, large urban regions resulting from the 
expansion and coalescence of adjacent cities and towns]). 
E-Risk families are nationally-representative in terms of 
ONS urbanicity classifications; 32.2% of E-Risk child-
ren lived in urban settings at age 12 compared to 36.1% 
nationwide; 47.9% vs 45.0% lived in intermediate set-
tings; and 19.9% vs 18.9% lived in rural settings.
Neighborhood Characteristics. Social conditions (ie, 
social processes) in the participants’ neighborhoods 
were estimated via a postal survey sent to residents liv-
ing alongside E-Risk families when participants were 
aged 13–14.38,39 Survey respondents, who were typically 
living on the same street or within the same apartment 
block as the participants in our study, reported on var-
ious characteristics of their immediate neighborhood, 
including levels of social cohesion and neighborhood dis-
order.40,41 Surveys were returned by an average of 5.18 
(SD = 2.73) respondents per neighborhood, and there 
were at least 2 responses for 95% of neighborhoods (N = 
5601 respondents). We were interested in social cohesion 
and neighborhood disorder because they collectively cap-
ture neighborhood characteristics that could plausibly 
influence risk for psychotic phenomena, such as trust and 
support between neighbors and physical and social signs 
of threat in the neighborhood. Social cohesion (5 items, 
each coded 0–4) was assessed by asking residents whether 
their neighbors shared values and trusted and got along 
with each other, etc. Neighborhood disorder (14 items, 
each coded 0–2) was assessed by asking residents whether 
certain problems affected their neighborhood, includ-
ing muggings, assaults, vandalism, graffiti and deliberate 
damage to property, etc. Items within each neighbor-
hood characteristic scale were averaged to create sum-
mary scores from each of the 5601 resident respondents. 
Neighborhood characteristic scores for each E-Risk fam-
ily were then created by averaging the summary scores 
of respondents within that family’s neighborhood. The 
resulting variables approach normal distribution across 
the full potential range (Social cohesion: M = 2.23, SD 
= 0.50, range = 0–3.71; Neighborhood disorder: M = 
0.49, SD = 0.34, range = 0–1.93). Supplementary table 
1 demonstrates that urban neighborhoods were charac-
terized by significantly lower levels of social cohesion 
and significantly higher levels of neighborhood disor-
der. Additionally, we indexed the most socially adverse 
neighborhoods by combining social cohesion with 
neighborhood disorder. Participants who had lived in 
neighborhoods that were simultaneously characterized 
by lower than average social cohesion and higher than 
average neighborhood disorder were designated as hav-
ing experienced neighborhood social adversity (coded 1: 
35.9% of participants, N = 772).
Personal Crime Victimization. Personal experiences of 
violent crime victimization were assessed in private inter-
views with the participants at age 18 via the Juvenile 
Victimization Questionnaire 2nd revision (JVQ-R2)42 
adapted as a clinical interview (see Fisher et al43 and sup-
plementary materials for full details). JVQ crime victimi-
zation comprised 9 items, each enquiring about the period 
“since you were 12” (eg, “Did anyone hit or attack you 
on purpose with an object or weapon like a stick, rock, 
gun, knife or anything that hurt?”). The worst experience 
(according to the participant) was rated using a 6-point 
scale: 0 = not exposed, then 1–5 for increasing levels of 
severity, reflecting the level of physical harm that had 
occurred. In the present study, crime victimization was 
dichotomized to represent the most violent forms of crime 
where injury or threat to life was likely, with participants 
who reported the top 2 levels of JVQ crime victimization 
(levels 4/5) designated as having experienced personal crime 
victimization (coded 1: 19.3% of participants, N = 398).
Neighborhood-Level Deprivation. Neighborhood-level 
deprivation was constructed using A Classification of 
Residential Neighborhoods (ACORN), a geodemo-
graphic discriminator developed by CACI Information 
Services (http://www.caci.co.uk/; this link was work-
ing on April 20, 2017). Detailed information about

Neighborhoods, Crime, and Adolescent Psychotic Experiences
ACORN’s classification of neighborhood-level depriva-
tion has been provided previously.38,44,46 Briefly, CACI uti-
lized over 400 variables from 2001 census data for Great 
Britain (eg, educational qualifications, unemployment, 
housing tenure) and CACI’s consumer lifestyle data-
base. Following hierarchical-cluster-analysis, CACI cre-
ated 5 distinct and homogeneous ordinal groups ranging 
from “Wealthy Achiever” (coded 1) to “Hard Pressed” 
(coded 5) neighborhoods. Neighborhood-level depriva-
tion scores for the E-Risk families were then created by 
identifying the ACORN classification for that family’s 
postcode when children were aged 12. E-Risk families are 
representative of UK households across the spectrum of 
neighborhood-level deprivation: 25.6% of E-Risk fami-
lies live in “wealthy achiever” neighborhoods compared 
to 25.3% of households nation-wide; 5.3% vs 11.6% live 
in “urban prosperity” neighborhoods; 29.6% vs 26.9% 
live in “comfortably off” neighborhoods; 13.4% vs 13.9% 
live in “moderate means” neighborhoods; and 26.1% vs 
20.7% live in “hard-pressed” neighborhoods.45,46
Family- and Individual-Level Covariates. Family SES was 
measured via a composite of parental income, education, 
and occupation when participants were aged 5. The latent 
variable was categorized into tertiles (ie, low-, medium-, 
and high-SES). Family psychiatric history and maternal 
psychosis were both considered as proxy indicators of 
genetic and environmental risks, to control for potential 
social drift whereby individuals with mental illness may 
be more likely to move to adverse neighborhoods. Both 
were assessed when participants were aged 12. In private 
interviews, mothers reported on family history of DSM 
disorders,47,48 which was converted to a proportion (0–1.0) 
of family members with a history of psychiatric disorder. 
For maternal psychosis, mothers were interviewed using 
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule49 for DSM-IV50 which 
provides a symptom count for characteristic symptoms 
of schizophrenia (eg, hallucinations, delusions, anhedo-
nia). Alcohol and cannabis dependence were considered 
because alcohol and cannabis are conceivably more avail-
able in cities, and abuse of these substances is associated 
with psychotic symptoms.51,52 We interviewed participants 
when they were aged 18 for the presence of alcohol/canna-
bis dependence according to DSM-IV criteria. Assessments 
were conducted in face-to-face interviews using the DIS.51 
The rates were 12.8% (N = 263) and 4.3% (N = 89), respec-
tively. Childhood psychotic symptoms at age 12 (described 
previously22) were included as a potential confound in mod-
els involving crime victimization because early psychotic 
phenomena have been associated with the likelihood of 
experiencing victimization. At age 12, 5.9% (N = 125) of 
children reported psychotic symptoms. Further details on 
the covariates are provided in the supplementary materials.
Adolescent Major Depression. Specificity analyses were 
conducted with adolescent depression as the outcome, 
because psychotic experiences and depression commonly 
co-occur and share similar aetiology.53 Adolescent major 
depression was assessed at age 18 following DSM-IV cri-
teria in face-to-face interviews using the DIS.51 By age 18, 
20.1% (N = 414) of adolescents had met DSM-IV criteria 
for a major depressive episode.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted analyses following 5 steps. First, logis-
tic regression was used to test whether psychotic expe-
riences (between ages 12 and 18) were more common 
among adolescents raised in urban neighborhoods. We 
controlled for family- and individual-level factors and 
for neighborhood-level deprivation to check that the 
association was not explained by these characteristics 
which could potentially differ between urban vs rural 
residents. We also examined the association between 
urbanicity and adolescent major depression to check 
for specificity of the previous findings. Second, because 
urban neighborhoods are characterized by lower levels 
of social cohesion and higher levels of neighborhood 
disorder (supplementary table 1) we tested whether levels 
of these neighborhood characteristics accounted for the 
association between urbanicity and adolescent psychotic 
experiences, and we also estimated the separate associa-
tions of social cohesion and neighborhood disorder with 
adolescent psychotic experiences. Third, using logis-
tic regression we checked whether adolescents who had 
lived in the most socially adverse neighborhoods (neigh-
borhood characterized by both low social cohesion and 
high neighborhood disorder) were more likely to be per-
sonally victimized by violent crime and, in turn, whether 
psychotic experiences were more common among ado-
lescents who had been victimized. Fourth, using inter-
action contrast ratio analysis we investigated potential 
cumulative and interactive effects of adverse neighbor-
hood social conditions and personal victimization by 
violent crime on adolescent psychotic experiences. Four 
exposure categories were created for this analysis by 
combining neighborhood social adversity with personal 
crime victimization (0 = not exposed to either; 1 = lived 
in the most adverse neighborhoods but not personally 
victimized by violent crime; 2 = personally victimized by 
violent crime but did not live in the most adverse neigh-
borhoods; and 3 = exposed to both the most socially 
adverse neighborhood conditions and also personally 
victimized by violent crime). Finally, sensitivity analyses 
were conducted using the clinically-verified adolescent 
psychotic symptoms as the outcome measure. All anal-
yses were conducted in STATA 14.2 (Stata-Corp), and 
accounted for the nonindependence of twin observa-
tions using the “CLUSTER” command. This procedure 
is derived from the Huber-White variance estimator, 
and provides robust standard errors adjusted for within-
cluster correlated data.54 Note: ordinal logistic regression

was used in analyses where adolescent psychotic experi-
ences was the dependent variable, because this was on an 
ordinal (rather than binary) scale.
Results
Are Psychotic Experiences More Common Among 
Adolescents Raised in Urban vs Rural Neighborhoods?
Model 1 in table 1 shows that as the level of childhood 
urbanicity increased from rurality, odds for adolescent 
psychotic experiences also increased (intermediate urba-
nicity: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.01–1.86, P = .042; highest 
urbanicity: OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.21–2.30, P = .002). 
Crucially, model 2 in table 1 highlights that the associa-
tion between the most urban setting and adolescent psy-
chotic experiences remained significant after considering 
a range of potential family- and individual-level con-
founders (family SES, family psychiatric history, maternal 
psychosis, and adolescent alcohol/cannabis dependence) 
and neighborhood-level deprivation (OR = 1.43, 95% 
CI = 1.01–2.03, P = .042), indicating that the association 
was not likely due to compositional effects. Moreover, 
the association also demonstrated a degree of specificity 
in that urban residency was not significantly associated 
with adolescent depression (unadjusted OR = 0.94, 95% 
CI = 0.68–1.31, P = .736).
Can the Association Between Growing Up in an 
Urban (vs Rural) Setting and Adolescent Psychotic 
Experiences be Explained by Social Conditions of 
Urban Neighborhoods?
Model 3 in table 1 shows that after considering resident-
reported neighborhood social conditions, the association 
between living in the most urban setting and adolescent 
psychotic experiences was attenuated to below conven-
tional levels of significance (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.94–
1.92, P = .103). That is, almost half of the effect of 
urbanicity on adolescent psychotic experiences (media-
tory estimates are supported by pathway analyses55) was 
explained by the levels of social cohesion and neighbor-
hood disorder in urban vs rural neighborhoods. In table 2 
we additionally show the independent effects of social 
cohesion and neighborhood disorder on adolescent psy-
chotic experiences, with the neighborhood characteris-
tic measures categorized at various thresholds. In short,

independent variables. All analyses account for the nonindependence of twin observations.

Neighborhoods, Crime, and Adolescent Psychotic Experiences
psychotic experiences were more common among adoles-
cents who had lived in neighborhoods with lower levels 
of social cohesion and higher levels of neighborhood dis-
order, and these associations were very similar regardless 
of the threshold used.
Are Psychotic Experiences More Common Among 
Adolescents Who Have Been Personally Victimized by a 
Violent Crime?
Among adolescents who had lived in the most socially 
adverse neighborhoods (neighborhoods that were simul-
taneously characterized by low social cohesion and 
high neighborhood disorder), 24.0% had been person-
ally victimized by a violent crime compared to 15.1% 
of adolescents who had lived in more favorable neigh-
borhood conditions (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.32–2.41, 
P < .001). Furthermore, adolescents who had been 
victimized by violent crime had over 3 times greater 
odds of having psychotic experiences than non-vic-
timized adolescents (OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 3.00–4.72, 
 
P < .001), and this association was not explained by the 
set of potential confounders reported in table 3 (OR = 
2.90, 95% CI = 2.28–3.69, P < .001).
Is There a Cumulative Effect of Neighborhood Social 
Adversity and Personal Crime Victimization on 
Adolescent Psychotic Experiences?
Given previous evidence that risk for psychosis increases 
incrementally following an accumulation of stressful 
exposures, we tested for cumulative and interactive effects 
of adverse neighborhood social conditions and personal 
crime victimization during upbringing on adolescent psy-
chotic experiences. Table 3 shows that both neighborhood 
social adversity and personal crime victimization each had 
significant independent associations with adolescent psy-
chotic experiences. However, focusing on model 2, which 
adjusts for all potential confounders, the combined effect 
of neighborhood social adversity and personal crime vic-
timization on adolescent psychotic experiences was much 
greater than either exposure alone, at nearly 5 times the 
odds compared to unexposed adolescents (OR = 4.86, 
95% CI = 3.28–7.20, P < .001). The interaction between 
neighborhood social adversity and personal crime victim-
ization (ICR = 1.81, 95% CI = -0.03–3.65) was significant 
at the P = .054 level. That is, the odds for adolescent psy-
chotic experiences among individuals who were exposed 
to both neighborhood social adversity and crime victimi-
zation was 1.81 points higher than the summed effects of 
the individual exposures (model 2 in table 3).
Sensitivity Check: Are Urbanicity, Neighborhood 
Social Conditions, and Crime Victimization Also 
Associated With Adolescent Psychotic Symptoms (vs 
Experiences)?
Only 2.9% (n = 59) of adolescents met criteria for the 
clinically-verified psychotic symptoms. Adjusted model 
2 in supplementary table 2 shows that participants raised 
in urban (vs rural) settings appeared to be at elevated 
risk for experiencing adolescent psychotic symptoms, 
though this association was nonsignificant (OR = 1.40, 
95% CI = 0.57–3.41, P = .460). While the point esti-
mate was very similar to that produced for adolescent 
psychotic experiences (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.01–2.03, 
P = .042), the low base rate of verified symptoms in the 
current sample restricted our power to detect associa-
tions at this level. In addition, model 3 in supplemen-
tary table 2 revealed that neighborhood social adversity 
explained a similar proportion of the effect of the most 
urban residency on adolescent psychotic symptoms to

aAnalyses were conducted using the full-scale neighborhood characteristic variables. That is, the average of resident-rated neighborhood 
characteristic scores for each E-Risk neighborhood. Social cohesion was reverse scored to facilitate comparison with neighborhood 
disorder.
bThe full-scale neighborhood characteristic variables were dichotomized at the mean, so that low social cohesion was a score lower than 
the mean, and high neighborhood disorder was a score higher than the mean.
cThe full-scale neighborhood characteristic variables were dichotomized at the tertile, so that low social cohesion was a score lower than 
the 33rd centile, and high neighborhood disorder was a score higher than the 66th centile. All analyses account for the nonindependence 
of twin observations.

aThese 4 exposure categories were created by combining neighborhood social adversity (neighborhood was simultaneously characterized by low social cohesion and high 
neighborhood disorder) with personal crime victimization: 0 = not exposed to either; 1 = lived in the most socially adverse neighborhood but not personally victimized 
by violent crime; 2 = personally victimized by violent crime but did not live in the most socially adverse neighborhood; and 3 = exposed to both the most socially adverse 
neighborhood conditions and also personally victimized by violent crime.
bThe association of cumulative exposures to neighborhood social adversity and personal crime victimization with adolescent psychotic experiences was calculated with 
ordinal logistic regression because adolescent psychotic experiences are on an ordinal (0–3) rather than binary scale. Model 1—the unadjusted associations of neighborhood 
social adversity and personal crime victimization with adolescent psychotic experiences. Model 2—adjusted simultaneously for childhood psychotic symptoms, family-level 
characteristics (family socioeconomic status, family psychiatric history, maternal psychotic symptoms), individual-level characteristics (adolescent alcohol dependence and 
adolescent cannabis dependence), and neighborhood-level deprivation at age 12. All analyses account for the nonindependence of twin observations.

supplementary table 3 yielded very similar point esti-
mates for the cumulative exposures categories, though 
some associations failed to reach statistical significance.
Discussion
This study investigated the role of urbanicity, neighbor-
hood social conditions, and personal crime victimization 
in adolescent psychotic experiences and revealed 3 ini-
tial findings. First, the association between growing up 
in an urban environment and adolescent psychotic expe-
riences remained after considering a range of potential 
confounders including family SES, family psychiatric 
history, maternal psychosis, adolescent substance prob-
lems, and neighborhood-level deprivation. This associa-
tion between urbanicity and psychotic experiences was 
explained, in part, by 2 features of the neighborhood 
social environment, namely lower levels of social cohe-
sion and higher levels of neighborhood disorder. Second, 
personal victimization by violent crime was nearly twice 
as common among adolescents in the most socially 
adverse neighborhoods, and adolescents who had experi-
enced such victimization had over 3 times greater odds of 
having psychotic experiences. Third, the cumulative effect 
of neighborhood social adversity and personal crime 
victimization on adolescent psychotic experiences was 
substantially greater than either exposure alone, high-
lighting a potential interaction between these exposures. 
That is, adolescents who had lived in the most adverse 
neighborhood conditions and been personally victimized 
were at the greatest risk for psychotic experiences during 
adolescence.
The present findings extend previous evidence from 
this cohort implicating childhood urbanicity and neigh-
borhood characteristics in the occurrence of childhood 
psychotic symptoms.25 Here we show that the effects of 
urban and socially adverse neighborhood conditions on 
psychotic experiences are not limited to childhood, but 
continue into adolescence when psychotic phenomena 
become more clinically relevant.26 These findings sup-
port previous evidence demonstrating higher rates of 
psychosis-proneness and prodromal status among ado-
lescents and young adults in urban,1 threatening,56 and 
socially fragmented neighborhoods.57 Late adolescence 
heralds the peak age at which psychotic disorders are typ-
ically diagnosed.58 If a degree of aetiological continuity 
truly exists between adolescent psychotic experiences and 
adult psychotic disorder, ours and other recent findings 
tentatively support a mechanism linking adverse neigh-
borhood conditions during upbringing with psychosis in 
adulthood.
In our study, the combined effect of adverse neigh-
borhood social conditions and personal victimization by 
violent crime was greater than the independent effects of 
each. This is consistent with cumulative stress models and 
previous studies showing that risk for psychosis pheno-
types increases as the frequency and severity of stressful 
exposures increase.31–34,59,60 Several biological and psycho-
logical mechanisms could explain why adolescents who 
were exposed to neighborhood social adversity and vio-
lent crime during upbringing were more prone to psy-
chotic experiences. Prolonged and acute early-life stress is 
purported to dysregulate the biological stress response61–63 
and lead to dopaminergic sensitization, which is the lead-
ing hypothesized neurochemical pathway for the posi-
tive symptoms of psychosis.61,64 In addition, adolescents 
who grow up in threatening neighborhoods with weak 
or absent community networks could develop psychosis-
like cognitive schemas such as paranoia, hypervigilance, 
and negative attributional styles.65,66 A cognitive pathway 
(rather than a nonspecific stress mechanism alone) could 
explain why effects were apparent for psychotic experi-
ences but not major depression. Our findings tentatively 
suggest a mechanism whereby childhood exposure to 
neighborhood social adversity sensitizes individuals to 
subsequent stressful experiences such as crime victimiza-
tion. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by recent 
evidence of neurological differences in social stress reac-
tivity between adults with urban vs rural upbringing.67,68 
Further research into the influence of neighborhood 
exposures on childhood neurocognitive development 
could shed light on this hypothesized mechanism.
Limitations
Several limitations should be considered. First, causal-
ity of findings from this observational study cannot be 
assumed. Noncausal mechanisms, such as the selection 
of genetically high-risk families into urban and adverse 
neighborhoods, remain possible,69 though our find-
ings were not explained by proxy indicators of genetic 
and familial risk. Second, neighborhood conditions 
were measured approximately 5 years before adoles-
cent psychotic experiences were assessed. However, the 
vast majority of adolescents (71.4%, n = 1475) reported 
that they did not move house between ages 12 and 18. 
Third, though crime victimization was more common 
in adverse neighborhoods, we do not know the extent 
to which these victimization experiences occurred out-
side the home. Perpetrators of physical violence are often 
family members,70 suggesting that our measure of violent 
crime captured victimization inside as well as outside the 
home. Fourth, psychotic experiences are associated with 
adult psychosis but also with other serious psychiatric 
conditions5; while a degree of specificity was suggested 
in that the effect of urbanicity on psychotic experiences 
was not replicated for adolescent depression and was not 
explained by adolescent substance problems, it is proba-
ble that the mental health implications of growing up in 
an urban setting extend beyond psychosis.71 In addition, 
associations arising for the clinically-verified psychotic

symptoms were often nonsignificant. It is possible that 
the low prevalence of psychotic symptoms in this sample 
restricted our power to detect associations. However, it is 
also possible that the self-report measure of adolescent 
psychotic experiences captured genuine experiences (eg, 
being followed by a stranger) as well as psychotic phe-
nomena (eg, being followed by a detective). This may have 
inflated the associations arising for adolescent psychotic 
experiences, though it is reassuring that point estimates 
were fairly similar to those produced for psychotic symp-
toms. Finally, our findings come from a sample of twins 
which potentially differ from singletons. However, E-Risk 
families closely match the distribution of UK families 
across the spectrum of urbanicity38 and neighborhood-
level deprivation.46 Furthermore, the prevalence of ado-
lescent psychotic experiences among E-Risk participants 
is similar to non-twin samples of adolescents and young 
adults.1–4
Conclusions
Our findings provide initial evidence that adverse neigh-
borhood social conditions and violent crime victimiza-
tion, which are relatively common exposures particularly 
among urban youth, increase risk for adolescent psy-
chotic experiences. From a public health perspective, 
ours and other recent findings on geospatial correlates of 
early psychosis phenotypes56,57 suggest that preventative 
early intervention strategies for psychosis might capture 
particularly high-risk groups if targeted towards youth 
living in urban and socially adverse neighborhoods. As 
increasing numbers of youth around the world are living 
in cities,72 there is a growing need to improve our under-
standing of how both built and social features of urban 
settings are supporting and challenging young people’s 
mental health.
