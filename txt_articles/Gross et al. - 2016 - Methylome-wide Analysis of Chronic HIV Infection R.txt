SUMMARY
HIV-infected individuals are living longer on antiretro-
viral therapy, but many patients display signs that in
some ways resemble premature aging. To investigate
and quantify the impact of chronic HIV infection on ag-
ing, we report a global analysis of the whole-blood
DNA methylomes of 137 HIV+ individuals under sus-
tained therapy along with 44 matched HIV� individ-
uals. First, we develop and validate epigenetic models
of aging that are independent of blood cell composi-
tion. Using these models, we find that both chronic
and recent HIV infection lead to an average aging
advancement of 4.9 years, increasing expected mor-
tality risk by 19%. In addition, sustained infection re-
sults in global deregulation of the methylome across
>80,000 CpGs and specific hypomethylation of the re-
gion encoding the human leukocyte antigen locus
(HLA). We find that decreased HLA methylation is pre-
dictiveoflowerCD4/CD8Tcellratio,linkingmolecular

INTRODUCTION
It is an open question why some people show early or delayed
onset of aging-associated disorders (Kennedy et al., 2014).
Recent studies have found that aging is associated with epige-
netic changes (Christensen et al., 2009; Day et al., 2013; Heyn
et al., 2012; Numata et al., 2012; West et al., 2013), and based
on this work we (Hannum et al., 2012) and others (Horvath,
2013; Weidner et al., 2014) have built models capable of predict-
ing a person’s age using DNA methylation patterns across a large
number of CpG sites. Although these models are fairly accurate,
errors of prediction—differences between the chronological and
predicted age—serve as a quantitative readout of the relative
advancement or retardation of the ‘‘biological age’’ of an individ-
ual. Biological age advancement has been correlated with factors
such as gender, genetic polymorphisms, and diseases including
cancer and diabetes, and it may influence the onset of other age-
associated disorders (Day et al., 2013; Hannum et al., 2012). A
recent longitudinal study validated the clinical utility of these
models by demonstrating a link between biological age advance-
ment and increased mortality rates (Marioni et al., 2015).
Biological aging has become of particular interest in treatment
of HIV, in which the development of combination Anti-Retroviral
Therapy (cART) now enables infected individuals to live many
decades (Deeks, 2011; Deeks et al., 2013; Maartens et al.,
2014). Several studies have suggested links between chronic
HIV infection and early onset of neurodegeneration (Nightingale
et al., 2014), liver or kidney failure (Joshi et al., 2011; Kovari
et al., 2013), cancer (Dubrow et al., 2012), cardiovascular dis-
ease (Freiberg et al., 2013), and telomere shortening (Leeansyah
et al., 2013; Pathai et al., 2013), leading to the hypothesis that
HIV+ patients might experience advanced or accelerated aging
(Appay and Rowland-Jones, 2002; Guaraldi et al., 2011; Smith
et al., 2012). While these studies report rough estimates of
HIV-mediated age advancement in the range of 0–20 years, it
has been difficult to accurately quantify this number due to sam-
pling effects, co-morbidities, and relatively low incidence rates of
any single age-associated disease. To this effect, the existence,
extent, and molecular basis of a bona-fide increase in aging have
been unclear (Althoff et al., 2014; Solomon et al., 2014), in part
due to lack of an objective biological clock or aging biomarker.

 In parallel with such epidemiological observations, a number of
studiesreportageeffectsusingblood-basedbiomarkers.Analysis
of cell surface markers in T cells has shown HIV+ subjects to show
phenotypes of older cells (Cao et al., 2009). Other studies have
observed shortened telomeres in certain cell populations (Ricka-
baugh et al., 2011) as well as whole blood (Zanet et al., 2014), indi-
rectly linking HIV to aging via the well-studied connection between
telomere length and age (Lindsey et al., 1991; Cawthon et al.,
2003). Furthermore, a recent analysis of untreated HIV+ individ-
uals found DNA methylation sites that are associated with both
HIV infection and age (Rickabaugh et al., 2015). Together, these
results raise the possibility that HIV infection results in an increase
in biological age. Many questions remain, however: Are the epige-
netic changes associated with HIV the same as those previously
identified (Hannum et al., 2012; Horvath, 2013) in normal individ-
uals as markers of ‘‘biological age,’’ and how complete is the cor-
respondence between these two responses? What is the quanti-
tative effect on aging in years, and is it fixed age advancement
orcontinuousacceleration?Whatistheimpactonagingofchronic
HIV infection and sustained cART treatment? Are there other
impacts of HIV on the methylome that are unrelated to aging?
Here we begin to address these questions by analyzing the
methylomes of HIV-infected, cART-treated subjects, in which
we observe a strong shared phenotype of HIV and age. To un-
derstand this signal, we develop models of biological age that
allow us to establish a clear quantitative link between HIV infec-
tion and aging as observed in the general population. We identify
both global and targeted epigenomic effects of HIV, including
specific hypomethylation of the HLA locus. Together, these re-
sults shed light on the epigenetic consequences and/or geronto-
logical aspects of chronic HIV infection.

RESULTS
Genome-wide DNA Methylation
Profiling
To determine whether HIV is associated
with signs of aberrant biological aging,
samples
of
whole-blood
DNA
were
obtained from 137 HIV-infected, cART-
treated but otherwise healthy non-Hispanic white males (no hep-
atitis C co-infection, no diabetes, and high adherence to therapy)
and 44 healthy non-Hispanic white male controls (Table S1; Fig-
ure S1). Genome-wide methylation profiles of each sample were
determined using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip array. Data were normalized and controlled for quality
using standard techniques, resulting in removal of two control
patients due to poor signal (Experimental Procedures).
Unsupervised Analysis Shows Shared Phenotypes of HIV
and Age
As a preliminary exploration of this dataset, we ran an unsuper-
vised analysis to identify age-associated methylation sites and
their relation to HIV infection. Analysis of a previous methyl-
ome-wide screen of 538 healthy subjects (Hannum et al., 2012)
identified as many as 61,592 methylation sites associated with
age at a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) (likelihood ratio test in
multivariate regression model with Benjamini-Hochberg correc-
tion). Validation of these sites in whole blood from a second
control cohort from the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition (Riboli et al., 2002) (EPIC, N = 662)
confirmed 26,927 of these sites as strongly associated with
age (Figure 1A; Table S2).
Among these validated age-associated sites, we found a strik-
ing association with methylation in the HIV+ patients relative to
healthy controls (p < 10�100, Figure 1B). Further analysis of these
sites found a positive association of the first principal component
with both age and HIV status (Figure 1C; Table S3, association by
multivariate linear model p < 10�8). These findings support a link
between HIV infection and aging (Rickabaugh et al., 2015), as
quantitatively measured by epigenomic profiling (Figure 1D).

 Benchmarking and Refinement of Epigenetic Aging
Models
Given the shared effects of HIV and aging, we sought to deter-
mine whether HIV causes the same biological aging signature
as previously found in cohorts of uninfected individuals (Hannum
et al., 2012; Horvath, 2013; Marioni et al., 2015). We tested aging
models from both our group (Hannum et al., 2012) and Horvath
(Horvath, 2013) in independent datasets derived from whole
blood samples (Hannum et al., 2012; Riboli et al., 2002; Table
S4). Although the Hannum and Horvath modeling efforts were
based on different methodologies and training data, we found
they made very similar predictions (r = 0.9, Pearson’s correlation,
Figure 2A) and furthermore that a consensus of the two models
outperformed either model individually (Figures 2B and 2C;
Table S4). For this reason, we used this consensus model for
all remaining analyses.
A potential issue with these models arises in the fact that
methylation profiles from whole blood are influenced by cell
composition, and different cell types have different methylation
states (Jaffe and Irizarry, 2014). These differences might be
particularly pronounced in HIV-infected patients, some of
whom have low CD4+ T cell counts (Trono et al., 2010). To under-
stand the sensitivity of epigenetic aging models to cell type
composition, we downloaded two datasets profiling sorted cells
across shared sets of individuals (Absher et al., 2013, GEO:
GSE59250; Reynolds et al., 2014, GEO: GSE56046). Among
these sorted cell datasets, we saw good concordance of epige-
netic age predictions with chronological age (Figures S2A–S2F).

 Epigenetic age was reproducible across different cell types pro-
filed from the same patients, with high agreement of age esti-
mates (r >0.77–0.88) and moderate but very significant agree-
ment of age advancement (Pearson’s r > 0.45–0.68; p < 0.0001
for all associations, Figures S2G–S2J).
While we therefore expect the contribution of cell composition
to be minimal, we nonetheless developed an algorithm to individ-
ually normalize each methylation profile using methylation-
derived cell type information. In brief, we used a previously re-
ported method (Jaffe and Irizarry, 2014) to reliably predict blood
composition (Figure S3) and adjust out the expected contribu-
tion of cell-type-specific effects. This procedure greatly limited
the effects of age- and HIV-induced blood composition changes
in downstream analyses (Experimental Procedures; Figure S4).
HIV+ Individuals Have Advanced DNA Methylation Age
We next used this consensus aging model to calculate the ‘‘bio-
logical age’’ of each individual in our cohort (Table S4). For unin-
fected controls, the calculated biological age had a very high
concordance with chronological age (Figure 2D, Pearson’s
r = 0.94). In contrast, the HIV+ patients had a biological age
advancement of 4.9 years on average (p < 10�8 by Student’s t
test, 95% confidence interval 3.4–7.1 years, Figures 2E and
2F). These results were consistent with our previous unsuper-
vised analysis (Figures 1B and 1C) in suggesting that HIV infec-
tion leads to advanced aging. Furthermore, we found that the
age advancement of HIV+ individuals was negatively correlated
with the ratio of CD4+ / CD8+ T lymphocytes (Spearman’s rho =
�0.2, p < 0.02). CD4+ T cells are a major indicator of immune
integrity (Leung et al., 2013; Serrano-Villar et al., 2014) and are
inversely associated with morbidity and mortality, including
from non-AIDS defining diseases (El-Sadr et al., 2006); similarly,
the CD4/CD8 ratio predicts non-AIDS morbidity (Leung et al.,
2013; Serrano-Villar et al., 2014). This finding links biological ag-
ing of HIV-infected individuals to a clinical measure of disease
progression, and it raises the possibility that patients with stable
immune responses may be less affected by the advanced aging
phenotype. Taking into account a recently estimated 4.2% in-
crease in mortality risk per year of biological age advancement
using the Hannum model (Marioni et al., 2015), the changes
observed in HIV+ patients result in an expected total mortality
risk increase of 19%.
Age Advancement Is Independent of HIV Duration
Notably, patients more recently infected with HIV (<5 years) had
no significant difference in age advancement from those patients
with chronic (>12 years) infection (p > 0.5, Mann-Whitney U Test;
Figure 2F). Similar findings emerged from a regression analysis of
the chronological versus biological time since infection: the slope
did not differ from one (0.98 ± 0.06, SE) whereas the y-intersect
was significantly positive (5.2 ± 0.9; Figures 2E and 2F). These
findings lend support to the theory that age advancement occurs
early in the course of disease as a consequence of acute infection
or reaction to drug treatment (Guaraldi et al., 2011; Smith et al.,
2012). The lack of an increase of age advancement with disease
duration seems to contradict alternative views that HIV-mediated
aging occurs through cumulative effects of latent virus (Appay
and Rowland-Jones, 2002) or chronic therapeutic intervention
(Torres and Lewis, 2014). We did however observe less variation
in age advancement within the chronically infected HIV+ individ-
uals (Figure 2F, p < 0.002, Bartlett’s test relative to recently in-
fected group), perhaps reflecting the comparative stability of
infection and immune response on long-term cART therapy
(Luz et al., 2014; Rosenblatt et al., 2005).
Age Advancement Is Independent of Cellular
Composition
While the direct effects of cell type composition on the whole-
blood methylome were corrected by the adjustment described
above (also see Experimental Procedures), we considered that
it was still possible that changes in cell type composition could
lead to downstream, indirect changes in the epigenomes of all
blood cells. If this were the case, cell-type-associated changes
could be responsible for the observed increase in biological
age in the HIV+ cases. To assess this possibility, we constructed
a multivariate linear model in which cell type composition vari-
ables and HIV status were used to predict biological age as
measured by the methylome (Table 1). In this model, the pres-
ence of HIV was associated with an age advancement of 3.8 ±
1.1 years, while the presence of natural killer cells accounted
for additional increases in biological age. In an even more con-
servative test, we modeled age advancement with cell type
composition variables alone and found that the unexplained vari-
ation in this model still had a significant association with HIV
infection (p = 0.02, Likelihood Ratio Test, Table 1). Thus, even
in a very conservative analysis, HIV infection has association
with advanced aging that is independent of cell composition.

 We also sought to experimentally assess if the observed age
advancement due to HIV infection was observed in purified cell
populations. Using standard calculations of statistical power,
we estimated that a sample of 48 patients, balanced approxi-
mately between cases and controls, would have 81% power to
detect the same aging advancement effect as our primary screen
at p < 0.01. Accordingly, this number of subjects was prospec-
tively recruited from the University of Nebraska Medical Center
under an approved IRB protocol (501-15-EP), and blood ob-
tained following informed consent (Experimental Procedures;
Table S5). Whole blood was separated immunomagnetically to
isolate pure populations of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells.

As in whole blood, unsupervised anal-
ysis showed a clear effect of HIV in age-
associated methylation markers (Figures
3A and 3B). Application of epigenetic
models of aging in these pure-cell data-
sets showed good concordance of pre-
dicted age with chronological age in
both cell types (Figures 3C–3F). In neutro-
phils, the Hannum model predicted a
2.5 year increase in age due to HIV infec-
tion (p < 0.03, 95% CI 0.6–5.0 years,
Figure 3E) whereas the Horvath model
showed a smaller effect of 0.4 year
(p > 0.05). In contrast, CD4+ T cells had
a much stronger and more consistent
HIV response in both models, with the
consensus aging model showing an in-
crease of 5.7 years in the HIV+ subjects
(p < 10�5, 95% CI 3.4–7.9 years, Fig-
ure 3F). These data indicate that the ef-
fect of epigenetic age advancement is
not merely an artifact of changing blood composition, but likely
reflects true aging signals. The stronger effect size within CD4+
T cells (Figures 3G and 3H) suggests that these cells may be
exposed to more age-like stress than neutrophils, although
further work is needed to understand how disease may affect
aging rates across different cell types and tissues.
HIV and Aging Have Shared and Distinct Methylation
Patterns
Having identified a large effect of HIV infection on age associated
methylation signals, we then sought to better understand the
wider changes instigated by HIV. We identified 81,361 CpG

 markers associated with HIV infection (Benjamini-Hochberg cor-
rected p < 0.01; likelihood ratio test using a multivariate linear
model, Table S2). Of these, 2,569 upregulated markers and
1,769 downregulated markers were also associated with aging,
a 3.2 and 1.4-fold enrichment over random expectation, respec-
tively (Figure 4A, Fisher’s Exact Test p < 10�30, Table S6). We
found that markers associated with both HIV and aging were
enriched in DNase hypersensitivity sites and CpG islands, sug-
gesting methylation changes in DNA regions under active regu-
lation. These CpG markers were also enriched in binding sites for
polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) (Figure 4B), a switch that
tightly regulates genes required for differentiation and renewal,
and in Drosophilia is linked to longevity (Siebold et al., 2010).
These findings reinforce previous reports that PRC2 targets
are irreversibly repressed by methylation during the aging pro-
cess (Beerman et al., 2013; Deaton and Bird, 2011; Teschendorff
et al., 2010). Interestingly, markers associated with HIV but
not aging had a very different functional enrichment profile (Fig-
ure 4B), indicating an additional mechanism(s) for epigenetic
alteration associated with HIV.
We have previously reported that age-associated markers in
older subjects tend away from a fully methylated or unmethy-
lated state and instead move toward disorder (with a methylation
fraction of 50% representing complete disorder) (Hannum et al.,
2012). We found that HIV-infected patients displayed a similar
trait: among markers associated with HIV, 66% tended toward
disorder, compared with 70% of age-associated markers
(Experimental Procedures, Figure S5). Furthermore, whereas
age-associated markers tended to have a low methylation
fraction that increased with age, HIV-associated markers were
more equally balanced between low and high methylation states
(Figure 4C).
HIV Is Associated with Hypomethylation of the HLA
Locus, Independent of Aging
Thus far, we had observed multiple effects of HIV on the methyl-
ome, including changes in cellular composition, age advance-
ment, and a general increase in methylome disorder. We next
sought to determine whether there are specific genomic regions
for which the methylation state is particularly associated with HIV
infection, independent of aging or other factors (Experimental
Procedures). Toward this aim, we conducted an analysis of
HIV-associated CpG markers independent of disorder or age,
controlling for the effects of cellular composition. Analysis of
the whole-blood data identified a single genomic region that
was enriched in CpG markers associated with HIV; this region,
consisting of 10 Mb on chromosome 6 including histone gene
cluster 1 and the entire HLA locus, had particularly reduced
methylation levels in HIV+ cases as compared to HIV� controls
(p < 10�10, Figure 5A; Experimental Procedures). HLA genes
encode the Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs), the
key antigen-presenting molecules that govern the acquired im-
mune response and impact innate immunity (Figure 5B) (Goulder

 and Walker, 2012). We found that the differentially methylated
markers surround the rs2395029 variant, for which common ge-
netic variation has been repeatedly implicated in HIV host control
(Figures 5C and 5D) (Fellay et al., 2007; International HIV Control-
lers Study et al., 2010). Examination of this locus in the validation
samples of purified neutrophils and CD4+ T cells identified the
HCP5 gene body as particularly differentially methylated in neu-
trophils (Figures 5E, 5F, and S6). As further evidence that the

 observed changes are functional, we found that the amount of
methylation at this gene was correlated with a patient’s CD4+/
CD8+ T cell ratio (Figure S6). Taken together, these results indi-
cate that the HLA locus is likely differentially methylated across
blood cell types and also changes within individual cell types in
response to HIV. An intriguing interpretation of our results is
that some of the previously reported changes in HLA expression
and corresponding HIV control (Apps et al., 2013) are attributable
to methylation dynamics.
DISCUSSION
We have shown that methylome-wide changes previously
ascribed to aging are also induced by HIV (Figures 1 and 3). By
using highly accurate, externally trained and validated models
of biological aging, our study provides a robust estimate of a
5-year age advancement in HIV/cART individuals (Figure 2).
These results, in combination with the link between molecular
age advancement and increased mortality risk (Marioni et al.,
2015), support the idea that chronic HIV infection is accompa-
nied by a tangible gerontological phenotype. In addition to an
aggregate estimate of HIV age advancement, the methylation
aging model allows for patient-by-patient estimates. Patients
deemed more likely to suffer from HIV-mediated aging effects
might be placed on alterative schedules for preventative care,
including early screening and further testing if warranted.
While epidemiological studies have attempted to measure age
acceleration and increased mortality rates in HIV+ individuals
(Appay and Rowland-Jones, 2002; Guaraldi et al., 2011; Smith
et al., 2012), such measurements are made difficult by the
myriad co-factors associated with HIV infection. For instance,
metabolic disorders such as diabetes, HCV infection, and medi-
cation adherence are important factors of HIV infection that are
also suspected to significantly affect mortality rates. Most previ-
ous studies have not attempted to control for these factors; in
contrast, our study has focused specifically on well-character-
ized subjects. Nonetheless, our estimate of HIV age advance-
ment of 4.9 years, calculated from a quantitative analysis of
the methylome, falls within the range of the previous epidemio-
logical studies. Further work will be needed to understand if
the observed epigenetic age advancement is generalizable to
broader slices of the HIV+ population (i.e., patients with complex
co-morbidities such as drug use or additional viral infections).
This study is based on the same epigenetic model of biological
aging as many others, including recent reports associating epige-
netic aging with Down’s Syndrome (Horvath et al., 2015), trau-
matic stress (Boks et al., 2015), and even all-cause mortality (Mar-
ioni et al., 2015). Here, we implement key data processing and
analysis steps to improve the application of these models, which
should aid in future applications. By minimizing the effects of cell
type composition, we find better calibration of our control sam-
ples (Figures 2B–2D; Table S2), and the model is less affected
by confounding associations such as the changing blood compo-
sition that occurs in HIV+ individuals (Figure S4). Furthermore,
integration of both the Hannum et al. (2012) and Horvath models
of epigenetic aging serves to limit biases in model training and al-
lowsustofiltersamplesthatareoflow qualityorill-suitedforusein
aging studies (Experimental Procedures; Table S4).
Our finding of a 5-year age advancement in cART-treated sub-
jects (Figure 2E) is similar to one recent report (Horvath and Lev-
ine, 2015) but contrasts with another study in untreated patients,
in which shared effects of age and HIV on the methylome were
used to report an age advancement of 14 years (Rickabaugh
et al., 2015). Although this discrepancy could be due to a bene-
ficial effect of cART, we believe it is more likely due to differing
statistical approaches. The previous number is based on com-
parison of the effects of HIV and age in a single cohort, rather
than an epigenetic model of aging built for normal individuals,
as performed here. Moreover, the authors derive their estimate
from the ratio of linear coefficients for HIV and age, which are
themselves highly correlated; such co-linearity is a well-known
cause of instability in such estimates (Farrar and Glauber, 1967).
The discovery of HLA hypomethylation as a targeted conse-
quence of HIV infection (Figure 5) has compelling synergy with
the earlier discoveries of HLA genotype and expression level
as major determinants of HIV control. Common genetic variation
in HLA has been identified as the major contributing factor to
host control of HIV infection (Fellay et al., 2007; International
HIV Controllers Study et al., 2010), and HLA has been reported
as a hotspot for integration of HIV provirus (Ambrosi et al.,
2011). HIV infection has also been associated with decreased
expression of some HLA genes but not others (Bonaparte and
Barker, 2004; Cohen et al., 1999), and higher HLA-C expression
is associated with HIV control (Apps et al., 2013; Kulkarni et al.,
2011; Thomas et al., 2009). Our result suggests an epigenetic
component to the regulation of HLA expression in this region.
It also raises the possibility that the ability to control HIV infection
could be acquired through epigenetic modification, as well as
inherited through genotype.
In summary, we have shown that an extrinsic perturbation to a
human population, driven by HIV infection and cART, is capable
of inducing changes in the epigenomic state of affected individ-
uals. This perturbation may influence regulation of HLA gene
expression and also encompasses signatures of aging. Our find-
ings help address a long-standing debate regarding the effects
of HIV infection on biological aging in cART-treated individuals,
in a manner that can be assessed numerically using an epige-
nome-based readout. Taken together, our findings show that
the epigenome adds a quantitative means of assessing the inter-
action of HIV with normal and pathogenic processes associated
with aging, and they shed light on the underlying mechanisms by
which acute and chronic viral infection impact the host.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reproduction of Computation Procedures
All data retrieval and processing steps are documented in a series of Jupyter
notebooks at https://www.github.com/theandygross/HIV_Methylation.
Selection Criteria and Subject Recruitment
HIV+ subject samples were obtained from CHARTER as a Resource (http://
www.charterresource.ucsd.edu). The CHARTER study was comprised of
HIV-infected participants at varying stages of disease and with differing his-
tories of antiretroviral treatment, with a focus on neuromedical and neurobeha-
vioral assessments (Heaton et al., 2010). We requested information on sub-
jects for which DNA had been obtained. Demographic and clinical data were
filtered for non-Hispanic white males (to match the control group) who were
free of Hepatitis C virus, not diabetic, on cART, and adherent to therapy.
164
Molecular Cell 62, 157–168, April 21, 2016
 Two groups were selected for study, those more recently infected by HIV (but
after the acute infection stage, 0.8–5.0 years of infection) and those chronically
infected (>12.0 years). As a control, 44 non-Hispanic white males without HIV
were recruited from the San Diego area.
For validation samples, 35 HIV+ subjects along with 25 healthy controls
were recruited prospectively for the purpose of this study to match the charac-
teristics of the primary cohort. Cells were purified using immunomagnetic
separation, and DNA was extracted from purified cell populations. While
most subjects used had both neutrophils and CD4+ T cells profiled, differing
DNA yield for some subjects prohibited profiling of both cell types for some
patients.
Clinical and demographic data are presented in Tables S1 and S5.
Sample Collection and Methylation Analysis
DNA was purified from whole-blood samples using PaxGene collection tubes
(QIAGENe) and FlexiGene DNA extraction kits (QIAGEN). Methylation analysis
was performed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kits (Illumina).
500 ng of DNA was bisulfite converted using EZ DNA Methylation Kits (Zymo
Research) and subsequently processed for HumanMethylation450 BeadChips
following manufacturer’s instructions. Following hybridization, BeadChips
were scanned using the Illumina HiScan System.
Data Pre-Processing
All methylation data for HIV+ and HIV� subjects were deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under GEO: GSE67705. For the Hannum et al.
(2012) and EPIC (Riboli et al., 2002) studies, raw data were obtained from
GEO: GSE40279 and GSE51032. All data were processed through the Minfi
R processing pipeline (Aryee et al., 2014). Cell counts were estimated by the
estimateCellCounts function in Minfi using flow sorted cell populations made
available by Houseman et al. (2012). To limit variability in methylation levels
due to differing cell type composition in the whole-blood samples, methylation
levels were adjusted for each CpG marker as follows:
d Average methylation levels for each cell type were obtained from the
Houseman et al. (2012) flow sorted blood dataset.
d A theoretical methylation level was assessed for each patient by
assuming their blood to be a mixture of these pure cell populations at
the estimated cell type proportions.
d The difference of each patient’s methylation level from the average was
assessed.
d This difference was subtracted from the original raw dataset.
We followed the protocol established to be optimal by Marabita et al. (2013)
first quantile normalizing the data and then performing beta-mixture quantile
(BMIQ) normalization (Teschendorff et al., 2013). To limit batch effects, all ar-
rays across the three studies were normalized together. For use in the Horvath
methylation age model, raw data were normalized to a gold standard reference
distribution following the protocol provided in the manuscript (Horvath, 2013).
The sole deviation from the Horvath protocol was an additional cell composi-
tion adjustment performed in a similar manner as described above, after BMIQ
normalization. While the cell composition adjustment was not part of either the
Horvath or Hannum et al. (2012) processing pipeline, recent work (Jaffe and Iri-
zarry, 2014) has shown cell type composition to be a key confounding factor in
methylation analysis.
Benchmarking the Aging Models
Aging models were assessed using the Hannum et al. (2012) and EPIC (Riboli
et al., 2002) datasets. While the Hannum et al. dataset was used to train both
epigenetic aging models, the EPIC data were made available after the time of
construction of both models and thus provide an independent assessment of
performance. We limited analysis to patients between the ages of 25 and 68
years of age for better comparison to the HIV cohort. Among the HIV and
EPIC cohorts, we saw slightly better performance of the Hannum model (which
was trained using only whole blood data) than the Horvath model (trained in a
variety of tissues), but when a simple average of these two models was taken
(the ‘‘consensus model’’), we found better performance than either separately
(Table S2).
Epigenetic Model Concordance Filter
One key drawback of current models of molecular age is the lack of a confi-
dence measure in model prediction for any particular individual. To address,
this we utilized the concordance between the two models as an additional filter
of data quality. Despite general agreement between the models, in a number of
subjects biological age predictions varied by more than 20%. This analysis re-
sulted in the filtering of three HIV+ cases and two HIV� controls in our primary
cohort (Table S1).
Linear Scaling of Epigenetic Age
For both models and across all datasets a linear scaling factor existed when
comparing chronological verses biological age. In order to properly compare
the performance of the models and to best calibrate them to our dataset, we
performed a linear adjustment to all model fits for the control data to a unit
slope with a zero intercept. Note that this affected the model error when
compared in an absolute sense but did not affect the correlation between bio-
logical and chronological age. In HIV+ patients, we adjusted this particular
cohort to the regression fit of the matched controls.
Screening for Differentially Methylated Markers in Response to HIV
Infection
For the results described in Figures 4 and 5, we ran a multivariate linear model
to test for differentially methylated markers in response to HIV infection. This
model used predicted cell type composition and age as covariates. Signifi-
cance was assessed via a likelihood-ratio test for the improvement of a model
fit with HIV as the variable of interest.
Disorder of Methylation in Response to HIV and Aging
We observed increasing disorder of the methylome by both aging and HIV
infection. To assess the possibility that the increasing age advancement might
be explained by increasing disorder, we conducted a principal component
analysis on 7,967 age-associated markers that trended away from <50% of
sites methylated with age (Figure S5A). This analysis produced a similar result
to that shown in Figure 1C, in which the first principal component of the cohort
was still associated with both with age and HIV infection. Furthermore, we
observed that only 231 of 436 (53%) markers used in the two aging models
tended toward methylation values of 50% of sites methylated (i.e., disorder,
binomial p = 0.2) and found that while there is a general entropy increase in
HIV+ patients across the entire methylome (Figure S5B), there is no such effect
in the markers used in the biological age models (Figure S5C).
Identification of Differentially Methylated Regions
We identified 25,491 markers that were associated with HIV, trended away
from disorder, and were not associated with age. For the discovery and visu-
alization of differentially methylated regions (Figure 5A), we calculated a rolling
statistic on the density of ‘‘hits’’ in 200 marker windows. From this analysis it
was clear that a genomic region encompassing the HLA and histone gene
clusters was enriched for markers in our query set, and post hoc analysis
confirmed a strong enrichment in the genomic interval traditionally assigned
to the HLA region (�29 MB–33 MB on chromosome 6, odds ratio = 1.3,
p < 10�10). For further refinement and visualization of this signal, we conducted
a similar scan statistic on a section of chromosome 6 in Figure 5D. In this
targeted analysis, we relaxed our criteria and looked for regions of consistent
increases or decreases in methylation in HIV+ verses HIV� subjects. This
analysis showed a number of ‘‘peaks’’ of hypomethylation both in the histone
gene region as well as near the HLA genes.
Accounting for the Probe Density of the HLA Region
One potential confounding factor of this analysis is the high density of markers
in the HLA region due to the design of the Illumina chip. Taking the non-unin-
form density of the chip into account, the scan statistic searched for regions
across a fixed number of markers as opposed to a fixed-width genomic inter-
val. Despite this, it is possible that the tight clustering of markers in this region
gave us more power to detect short differentially methylated regions within this
genetic locus. The presence of two peaks in the histone cluster region directly
upstream the HLA locus gives strong support to this being a specific effect.
The density of probes in the histone region was typical compared to the rest

 of the genome, and the coincidence of these two signals being close to each
other solely by chance is minimal.
