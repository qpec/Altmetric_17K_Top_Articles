While endurance exercise training improves cerebrovascular health and has neurotrophic
effects within the hippocampus, the effects of stopping this exercise on the brain remain
unclear. Our aim was to measure the effects of 10 days of detraining on resting cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) in gray matter and the hippocampus in healthy and physically fit
older adults. We hypothesized that rCBF would decrease in the hippocampus after a
10-day cessation of exercise training. Twelve master athletes, defined as older adults
(age ≥ 50 years) with long-term endurance training histories (≥15 years), were recruited
from local running clubs. After screening, eligible participants were asked to cease all
training and vigorous physical activity for 10 consecutive days. Before and immediately
after the exercise cessation period, rCBF was measured with perfusion-weighted MRI.
A voxel-wise analysis was used in gray matter, and the hippocampus was selected a
priori as a structurally defined region of interest (ROI), to detect rCBF changes over time.
Resting CBF significantly decreased in eight gray matter brain regions. These regions
included: (L) inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, (R) cerebellar
tonsil, lingual gyrus, precuneus, and bilateral cerebellum (FWE p < 0.05). Additionally,
rCBF within the left and right hippocampus significantly decreased after 10 days of no
exercise training. These findings suggest that the cerebrovascular system, including the
regulation of resting hippocampal blood flow, is responsive to short-term decreases in
exercise training among master athletes. Cessation of exercise training among physically
fit individuals may provide a novel method to assess the effects of acute exercise and
exercise training on brain function in older adults.

INTRODUCTION
Endurance exercise training (exercise) produces physiological adaptations that enhance aerobic
fitness and cardiovascular health (Brooks et al., 1996). Consistent exercise effectively augments
the maximal rate of oxygen consumption ( ˙
VO2max) centrally, by increasing cardiac output, and/or
peripherally by widening the arterial-venous oxygen (A- ˙
VO2) difference (Seals et al., 1981). ˙
VO2max
is the gold-standard index of cardiorespiratory fitness and is highly correlated with both morbidity
and mortality (Hoekstra et al., 2008; Sawada et al., 2012), with greater fitness status associated with
a reduced risk of chronic disease and a longer lifespan. In addition to enhancing the function of the
 Alfini et al.

cardiovascular system, exercise has been shown to increase
bone density, improve muscle quality, and protect against
metabolic dysfunction (Brooks et al., 1996). Conversely, when the
exercise stimulus is removed many of these systemic adaptations
rapidly dissipate (Mujika and Padilla, 2000a, 2001a,b), thereby
increasing the potential for adverse health effects. For example,
20 days of bed rest immobilization resulted in a substantial 28%
decrease in ˙
VO2max (Saltin et al., 1968); a prolonged detraining
period reduced muscle fiber capillarization and oxidative enzyme
activity (Klausen et al., 1981); and a 10-day period of physical
inactivity was related to the development of impaired glucose
tolerance and insulin resistance (Rogers et al., 1990).
A growing body of empirical evidence supports the notion
that exercise also robustly affects the human brain. Multimodal
neuroimaging studies, including both structural and functional
MRI, have helped elucidate the brain’s complex neurobiological
response to exercise. These exercise-induced effects include
cytoarchitectonic modifications (Erickson et al., 2009; Smith
et al., 2014; ten Brinke et al., 2015); altered patterns of neural
activity (Smith et al., 2013); and improved performance across
the cognitive domains (Tomporowski, 2003; Kramer et al., 2005;
Davranche and McMorris, 2009; Chapman et al., 2013). The
hippocampus, a subcortical brain structure well known for its
role in learning and memory, has shown neurotrophic effects
as the result of exercise training in humans and animal models
(van Praag et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 2007; Erickson et al., 2009).
Exercise interventions in humans have been shown to affect
hippocampal-dependent cognition and to increase hippocampal
blood perfusion (Pereira et al., 2007) and volume (Erickson
et al., 2009). While the effects of detraining have been reported
in peripheral physiological systems, the effects of detraining on
brain function, and on cortical and hippocampal blood flow, have
not been reported.
A key unanswered question, and the primary aim of this study,
was to determine how short-term exercise cessation impacts
cerebrovascular function in healthy highly physically active and
physically fit older adults. To accomplish this goal we measured
the resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of master athletes both
before and immediately after 10 days of exercise cessation. To
quantify rCBF we employed pseudo-continuous arterial spin
labeling (pCASL), a perfusion-weighted MRI technique. Our
hypotheses were twofold. We predicted (1) that 10 days of
physical inactivity would alter rCBF in areas known to be
susceptible to age-related decline (Greicius et al., 2004; Buckner
et al., 2005), and (2) that detraining would decrease hippocampal
blood flow, which we chose as an a priori region of interest (ROI).
METHODS
Participants
Our unique study sample consisted entirely of master athletes,
which were defined as a sub-group of highly trained healthy
older adults who regularly engaged in endurance exercise.
Master athletes ranged in age between 50 and 80, and were
recruited from local Washington D.C. area running clubs. These
individuals had an endurance exercise history of at least 15 years
and had recently competed in regional and national endurance
events. Personalized training regimens must have entailed at least
4 h of high intensity endurance training per week.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board,
and written informed consent was obtained from all participants,
in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. A telephone
screen was used to determine eligibility. Those who met
inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below) and agreed to participate
completed the following: anthropometric measurement, a
maximal intensity treadmill/electrocardiography test, DEXA
(Dual-energy
X-ray
absorptiometry)
body
composition
assessment, neuropsychological testing, and fMRI scanning
(Table 1 shows descriptive data for variables examined at
baseline only).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Individuals were excluded if they had a BMI ≥ 30, reported being
a smoker (within the past 5 years), or had a history of heart attack,
stroke, lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
peripheral vascular disease, heart disease, liver disease, kidney
disease, anemia, or diabetes. Individuals taking prescription
medication for hypertension were also deemed ineligible.
Women participants must have been post-menopausal for at least
2 years and must not have used hormone therapy during the
previous year. Additionally, individuals were excluded if they
presented any absolute contraindications to MRI. During the
initial telephone screening 21 persons were deemed ineligible to
participate in this study. Of the 12 individuals who qualified for
participation, nine (7 men, ∼89% Caucasian) were included in
the final analysis. One individual was removed due to irregular
ECG activity during the graded treadmill test; another because of
dental work that severely distorted the MR signal; and a third for
failure to achieve ˙
VO2max during the graded treadmill exercise
test.
Neuropsychological Testing
Prior to the baseline MRI scan, all participants were administered
the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975),

which is a 30-point questionnaire used to screen for global
cognitive impairment and dementia. Additionally, after both
the baseline and follow-up MRI scan all participants were
administered the semantic verbal fluency test (Monsch et al.,
1992). This test required participants to list as many words as
possible from a given category in 60-s (fruits and animals, order
counterbalanced).
˙
VO2max Testing
Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by assessing ˙
VO2max
during a graded treadmill test with indirect calorimetry (Quark,
Cosmed USA). Exercise tests were conducted utilizing a protocol
we have used numerous times previously in older athletes, and
included standard ECG monitoring (Rogers et al., 1990; Brooks
et al., 1996). The exercise test continued until maximal effort
or exhaustion was achieved. For exercise tests to be considered
maximal, participants had to reach both a plateau in ˙
VO2max with
increasing workload and a respiratory exchange ratio >1.1. The
highest ˙
VO2 attained during the test was recorded as ˙
VO2max.
The maximal exercise test was conducted several hours after the
baseline MRI scan.
Body Composition Assessment
Body composition was measured using dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) (DXA; Prodigy, LUNAR Radiation
Corp).
Exercise Cessation Period
MRI scanning occurred at two time points, baseline and
immediately after the 10-day exercise cessation. Participants were
asked to refrain from exercise during the 12 h preceding the
baseline assessment. The exercise cessation commenced 72 h after
the baseline scan, at which time all exercise training was stopped.
During this period participants were asked to refrain from
exercise and all other forms of vigorous physical activity. The
abstention from exercise during the 10-day period was verified
frequently by telephone conversations with the participants and
during their final testing. The second MRI scanning session
occurred on the morning after the last day of the exercise
cessation period, and before participants resumed their training
regimens.
MRI Acquisition
All MRI data were acquired with a Siemens 3.0 Tesla MR system
(Magnetom Trio Tim Syngo, Munich, Germany). A 32-channel
head coil was used for radio frequency (RF) transmission and
reception. Foam padding was positioned within the head coil
to minimize patient motion. A high-resolution T1-weighted
anatomical image was acquired for co-registration with the
following sequence parameters: Magnetization Prepared Rapid
Acquisition of Gradient Echo (MPRAGE), matrix = 256, field-
of-view (FOV) = 230 mm, voxel size = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm,
slices = 192 (sagittal plane, acquired right to left), slice thickness
= 0.9 mm, repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) =
2.32 ms, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, flip angle = 9◦, sequence
duration = 4:26 min. The pCASL data were acquired using the
following sequence parameters: single-shot gradient echo planar
images, matrix = 64, FOV = 210 mm, voxel size = 3.28 × 3.28 ×
6.0 mm, slices = 20 (axial plane, acquired in ascending order),
slice thickness = 5.0 mm, gap between slices = 1 mm, single
slice acquisition time = 48 ms, label duration = 1500 ms, post-
label delay = 1000–1912 ms, TR/TE = 4000/19 ms, volumes =
140, number of label/control pairs = 70, flip angle = 90◦, RF
blocks = 80, RF pulses = 20, gap between pulses = 360 µs,
bandwidth = 3004 Hz/Px, and sequence duration = 9:28 min.
Additionally, a concatenated series of control volumes stacked in
the time dimension was used as the proton density (PD) image
for perfusion calibration.
MRI Data Preprocessing
The pCASL and PD images were realigned to the first volume of
the image time series for motion correction (Cox, 1996). Using
pairwise subtraction, a perfusion-weighted image was derived
from the motion-corrected interleaved (control—tag) volumes,
and this image was corrected for slice-timing delay (Woolrich
et al., 2009).
Using FSL’s BASIL (Bayesian Inference for Arterial Spin
Labeling, FMRIB Software Library v5.0, Oxford, UK) (Woolrich
et al., 2009), a reference mask from the T1-weighted anatomical
image was used to isolate and sample the cerebral spinal fluid
(CSF) within the ventricles of the PD image. The CSF sample was
used to compute the magnetization equilibrium (M0) of tissue,
which was further used to obtain the magnetization equilibrium
of arterial blood (M0a) (Woolrich et al., 2009).
Buxton’s general model for kinetic inversion was used to
estimate absolute CBF (ml/100g/min) (Buxton et al., 1998), and
included both Bayesian inferences and the following parameters
(Chappell et al., 2009): �M (proportional magnetization
change represented by the perfusion-weighted image), T1blood
(longitudinal relaxation time of blood = 1650 ms), T1tissue
(longitudinal relaxation time of tissue = 1300 ms), α (labeling
efficiency = 0.85), M0a (magnetization equilibrium of arterial
blood), BAT (bolus arrival time = 1300 ms), Bolus (label
duration = 1500 ms), PLD (post label delay =1000 ms),
and λ (blood/brain partition coefficient of GM = 0.98 ml/g)
(Buxton et al., 1998; Alsop et al., 2014). The rendered CBF
map was spatially smoothed using an adaptive technique, which
combined neighboring voxel signals on an intensity-dependent
basis, while preserving the non-linear kinetics where smoothing
was unnecessary (Groves et al., 2009; Chappell, 2014). Due to
the inherently low spatial resolution of the perfusion image,
partial volume error correction was performed to improve the
accuracy of CBF estimation (Chappell et al., 2011; Chappell,
2014). This process effectively calculated separate gray matter
and white matter perfusion using tissue specific partial volume
estimates in each voxel (Chappell et al., 2011; Chappell, 2014).
Co-registration and normalization was performed with SPM8
(Hall and Degenhardt, 2008; SPM, University College, London,
UK), using the PD image as the reference to which the CBF
map was aligned. The output parameters were used to transform
the CBF map and gray matter estimates to standard space,
which effectively up-sampled the images to a 2 mm3 isotropic
voxel resolution. Normalized gray matter estimates were merged
together and used as a mask for the voxel-wise analysis.

CBF after Exercise Cessation in Master Athletes
Gray Matter Voxel-Wise Analysis
A voxel-wise analysis, restricted to voxels within the gray matter
mask, was conducted to explore the effect of exercise cessation
on rCBF. Statistical parametric maps were produced (Cox, 1996),
indicating where rCBF had significantly changed over time.
We used AFNI’s 3dClustsim program (on the 2 mm3 data) to
control for the effects of multiple comparisons and reduce the
likelihood of a Type-I error. This analysis tool used Monte Carlo
simulations to establish a family-wise error (FWE) corrected
probability threshold at both the voxel (p < 0.05) and cluster
(α < 0.05) level (Cox, 1996). Using first-order nearest neighbor
clustering, we maintained results at a minimum cluster size of
≥480 mm3. To further illustrate the results of the voxel-wise
analysis, the mean rCBF from each significant ROI was extracted
from all subjects, at both time points.
Hippocampal Analysis
To examine the effect of exercise cessation on hippocampal
blood flow, we conducted an a priori analysis that was
restricted to voxels within the hippocampus. To isolate and
examine hippocampal rCBF, we used FreeSurfer’s (version
5.3.0) automated subcortical processing stream (Fischl et al.,
2002). This procedure segmented the T1-weighted anatomical
image and rendered a segmentation map based on both
atlas
probabilities
and
subject-specific
tissue
intensities.
The segmentation map was normalized using non-linear
transformation to maintain both the accuracy and integrity of
the labeled subcortical anatomy. The non-linear transformation
parameters were then used to warp the co-registered CBF map
to standard space. The normalized bilateral hippocampal regions
were extracted, merged together, and used as a mask for the
voxel-wise analysis. Using the same clustering procedures as
described above, Monte Carlo simulations were run over the
hippocampal volume to establish a FWE threshold of p < 0.05
with a minimum cluster size of ≥200 mm3.
RESULTS
The Master Athlete Profile
The master athletes who volunteered for this study are a unique
population and should not be considered equivalent to older
adults who engage in regular moderate to vigorous intensity
leisure-time physical activity. Our participants had a mean
continuous endurance training history of ∼29 years, and on
average were running 59 km per week and training 5 days
per week just prior to the baseline testing. They also regularly
participated in regional and national endurance competition.
Moreover, as a group these master athletes had a ˙
VO2max above
the 90th percentile for their age and sex.
Gray Matter rCBF
Results of the gray matter voxel-wise analysis demonstrated
that the 10-day exercise cessation period significantly reduced
absolute rCBF in eight brain regions (Figure 1). Of note are
the Pre > Post comparisons, shown in blue on the � rCBF
maps in Figure 1, revealing significantly decreased rCBF in each
ROI (total volume = 5,640 mm3) that remained after correction
for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (see
Table 2). These regions included: (L) inferior temporal gyrus,
fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, (R) cerebellar tonsil,
lingual gyrus, precuneus, and (L/R) cerebellum. No statistically
significant change in whole brain absolute CBF in gray matter
was detected [mean (±SD) baseline = 69.4 (±10.4 ml/100g/min),
post-cessation = 67.2 (±12.6 ml/100g/min)].
Hippocampal rCBF
The a priori hippocampal analysis also revealed significantly
decreased blood flow in both the left and right hippocampus from
before to after the cessation of exercise training (see Figure 2).
Verbal Fluency
Verbal fluency performance did not significantly change from
before to after the cessation of training period [mean (±SD)
baseline = 19.9 (±4.9 words), post-cessation = 17.4 (±5.8
words), t(8) = 0.91, p = 0.39].
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we examined the relationship between
short-term exercise cessation and resting rCBF in master
athletes. Exercise cessation was associated with reduced rCBF
within eight gray matter regions, including bilateral regions of
the hippocampus. Importantly, these significant changes were
regionally specific, and not the result of global CBF changes after
the 10-day period of exercise cessation.
In one of the first studies of its kind, Saltin et al. (1968)
demonstrated the deleterious effects of bed rest immobilization
on the cardiovascular system. Comparable to decades of
biological aging, this extreme sedentary behavior reduced
˙
VO2max ∼27% in just 20 days (Mcguire et al., 2001). Using
biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis, Klausen examined the
effects of exercise cessation on skeletal muscle. After an 8-week
detraining period, both muscle fiber capillarization and oxidative
enzyme activity declined (Klausen et al., 1981). Finally, in a study
of master athletes, Rogers examined the effects of a short-term
period without exercise on insulin-regulated glucose metabolism.
After 10 days, ∼29% of these older adults developed signs of
impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance (Rogers et al.,
1990). Here, we have extended this literature to demonstrate
that not only does exercise cessation among physically fit older
adults affect markers of peripheral metabolic function, but
also appears to affect brain cortical and hippocampal blood
flow.
Exercise training has been shown to robustly affect the
structural and functional integrity of the hippocampus in
animals and humans, producing neurotrophic effects leading
to neurogenesis and angiogenesis in rodents (van Praag et al.,
1999; Pereira et al., 2007; Intlekofer and Cotman, 2013), and
to increased structural volume in healthy older adults (Erickson
et al., 2009). Twelve weeks of exercise training in healthy younger
adults was shown to increase the blood volume within the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and to improve episodic
memory performance. Our findings of reduced rCBF bilaterally
in the hippocampus suggest that training-induced changes in

hippocampal blood flow may be reversed with 10 days of exercise
cessation. Our participants, however, did not show any changes
in cognitive function over the 10-day cessation of exercise
period. Nevertheless, it is not known if cellular adaptations,
undetectable using MRI, occur when exercise training is stopped
temporarily.
Although several studies have used perfusion-weighted
imaging to probe for exercise-induced alterations in rCBF,
differences in exercise intensity, study design, and data analysis
methods have likely led to conflicting results. In a randomized
controlled trial, Chapman et al. (2013) demonstrated that a
12-week aerobic exercise intervention significantly increased
rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex of previously sedentary
older adults (Chapman et al., 2013). Likewise, a cross-sectional
study by Thomas showed that master athletes had significantly
greater rCBF in the posterior cingulate cortex than age-matched
sedentary controls (Thomas et al., 2013). While these findings
seem to corroborate one another, the effects of acute exercise
on rCBF have proven to be complex. Although Smith et al.
found rCBF in the motor cortex to be significantly greater after
a session of moderate-intensity exercise (Smith et al., 2010),
MacIntosh demonstrated, in a similar study, that acute exercise

decreased rCBF in the hippocampus and insula (MacIntosh et al.,
2014).
Until now, the effects of exercise cessation on cerebrovascular
function have been virtually unexplored. This study has
extended the literature by showing that a short-term period of
physical inactivity among master athletes reduces rCBF in the
hippocampus and several gray matter regions. While these effects
may have implications for brain function in older adults, it is

also possible that these effects represent changes in arterial transit
time (Buxton, 2005) or cerebral blood volume (Yoshiura et al.,
2009), neither of which we were able to measure. A decrease
in arterial transit time, for instance, while using the same post-
label delay parameter, could result in an apparent decrease in
rCBF (Buxton, 2005). In addition, total blood volume has been
shown to increase in response to exercise training (Convertino,
1991) and to decrease after detraining (Coyle et al., 1986).
These are important points to consider; however, the regional
specificity of the effects we observed suggests these changes
were not an artifact of a global flux in blood flow or volume.
Although increases in blood volume have been documented
in the dentate gyrus after 12 weeks of exercise in younger
adults (Pereira et al., 2007), the impact of exercise cessation on
cerebral blood volume and arterial transit time has not been
established.
Animal research
suggests the most viable mechanism
for exercise-induced perfusion alterations may be structural
modifications to the cerebrovasculature (Swain et al., 2003;
Pereira et al., 2007). One such study established these effects
by examining the association between increased cerebral blood
volume and post-mortem neurogenesis in exercised mice
(Pereira et al., 2007). The results indicate that local increases
in hippocampal blood volume coincide with the cellular
proliferation and reconfiguration within the dentate gyrus. In
another investigation, Ryhu provided further support for this
proposition by evaluating the effects of both exercise training and
exercise cessation on the non-human primate cerebrovascular
system (Rhyu et al., 2010). During this study, animals were
randomized to either treadmill training or sedentary behavior.
After 5 months, a sub-set of primates from the exercise
group were subjected to an additional 3 months without
exercise. At the 5-month time point, the exercised animals
had significantly greater cerebrovascular volumes than their
sedentary counterparts. As for the effects of exercise cessation,
the increases in vascular volume induced during the exercise-
training period were reversed after 3 months of detraining. It is
plausible that the cessation of exercise involves a reversal of these
effects, which would need to be confirmed in additional animal
models.
There are several limitations to the current study. We had
a small (n = 9) and homogeneous (7 men, ∼89% Caucasian)
study sample, in which all participants exhibited a high level of
aerobic fitness, long history of competitive endurance training,
and normal BMI, which limits the generalizability of our
findings. While our sample was small, the effects we observed
were substantial and all in the same direction. We may have
lacked statistical power to detect smaller effects and may have
underestimated the decreases in CBF that occurred. In addition,
because we only measured rCBF at two time points, we do
not know the time course of the changes we observed. It is
possible reduced rCBF may have been evident prior to day
10. Further, we cannot speculate regarding whether or not
these effects would have increased, decreased or remained stable
with a longer period of exercise cessation. We made a priori
predictions of changes in hippocampal blood flow based on
an extensive literature, a method also used by others (Pereira
et al., 2007), which avoided adjustment for whole brain voxel-
wise comparisons and prevented a possible Type-II error.
Nevertheless, future studies should confirm these effects in a
larger sample. Additionally, aerobic fitness was assessed only
at baseline, so we do not know the magnitude of the fitness
change over time. Several studies have documented that in
trained individuals substantial decreases in fitness occur after
short-term cessation from exercise training (Klausen et al.,
1981; Rogers et al., 1990; Mujika and Padilla, 2000b). Finally,
the nature of our imaging sequence (single-delay) limited our
ability to estimate changes in cerebral blood volume, and
possible changes in arterial transit time. Our post label delay
values began at 1000 ms and increased at each slice, which
does not precisely correspond to the ISMRM Perfusion Study
Group recommended guidelines for ASL scanning among older
adults (Alsop et al., 2014). This could contribute to CBF
quantification challenges, including arterial transit time artifacts.
Measuring cerebral blood volume and arterial transit time
with multi-delay ASL is an important next step (Alsop et al.,
2014).
Approximately two-thirds of the ROIs that showed altered
rCBF after exercise cessation are considered part of the brain’s
default mode network (DMN), which is known to be disrupted
with age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease
(Raichle et al., 2001; Sheline et al., 2010; Petrella et al., 2011).
Exercise training in older adults has been shown to augment
functional connectivity within the DMN in healthy older adults
(Voss et al., 2010). While our findings suggest that short-
term cessation from endurance training in highly trained older
adults may lead to decreased rCBF within the DMN, there was
no indication that these effects were detrimental to cognitive
function, as measured by a semantic verbal fluency task (which
activates brain regions that overlap with the DMN; Binder
et al., 2009), or to the integrity of these neural networks.
Future exercise detraining studies should examine participants
after resuming their training schedules to document whether
or not these effects would be reversed. It is also not known if
the decreased rCBF we observed solely reflects changes in the
rate of blood flow within parenchymal regions, or additionally
reflects changes in arterial transit time and/or blood volume.
Nevertheless, the exercise cessation paradigm may provide
useful information to probe the durability of the effects of
exercise training and physical activity on brain function. Just
as the effects of long-term endurance exercise training on
cardiovascular and metabolic function wane considerably after a
short period of detraining (Mujika and Padilla, 2000b), so also
may hippocampal and gray matter rCBF be sensitive to exercise
cessation.
