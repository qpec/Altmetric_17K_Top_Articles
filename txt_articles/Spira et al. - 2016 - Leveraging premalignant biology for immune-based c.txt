Prevention is an essential component of cancer eradication. Next-generation sequencing of cancer genomes
and epigenomes has defined large numbers of driver mutations and molecular subgroups, leading to
therapeutic advances. By comparison, there is a relative paucity of such knowledge in premalignant
neoplasia, which inherently limits the potential to develop precision prevention strategies. Studies on the
interplay between germ-line and somatic events have elucidated genetic processes underlying premalignant
progression and preventive targets. Emerging data hint at the immune system’s ability to intercept prema-
lignancy and prevent cancer. Genetically engineered mouse models have identified mechanisms by which
genetic drivers and other somatic alterations recruit inflammatory cells and induce changes in normal cells to
create and interact with the premalignant tumor microenvironment to promote oncogenesis and immune
evasion. These studies are currently limited to only a few lesion types and patients. In this Perspective, we
advocate a large-scale collaborative effort to systematically map the biology of premalignancy and the
surrounding cellular response. By bringing together scientists from diverse disciplines (e.g., biochemistry,
omics, and computational biology; microbiology, immunology, and medical genetics; engineering, imaging,
and synthetic chemistry; and implementation science), we can drive a concerted effort focused on cancer
vaccines to reprogram the immune response to prevent, detect, and reject premalignancy. Lynch syndrome,
clonal hematopoiesis, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia which also serve as models for inherited syn-
dromes, blood, and viral premalignancies, are ideal scenarios in which to launch this initiative.
premalignancy| biology| vaccines| cancer prevention| immune oncology
Cancer development is a complex process influenced
by inherited variation in germ-line DNA and acquired
somatic alterations. The stepwise accumulation of ge-
netic changes leads to oncogenic transformation (1),
and also co-opts neighboring normal cells (e.g., neuro-
nal and vascular) to support tumor development and
progression (1, 2). The immune system recognizes
transformed cells, and avoiding immune elimination is
now an accepted hallmark of cancer (2). Large-scale
somatic sequencing initiatives, such as The Cancer Ge-
nome Atlas (TCGA), in parallel with large genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of germ-line variants have
analyzed an increasing array of cancers (3). However,
there remain some notable lacunae in our understanding
of the biology of premalignancy and cancer develop-
ment, including the roles of the immune system. Al-
though cancers are increasingly being defined by
alterations in genetic, epigenetic, and signaling networks,
premalignant lesions [with few exceptions (4, 5)] are still
largely identified only through morphological criteria.
In this Perspective, we discuss the influence
and interactions of omic and cellular [e.g., tumor
microenvironment (TME) and microbiome] events on
the development and progression of premalignancy

 (1, 2, 4, 6). There is an unprecedented opportunity in single-cell
next-generation sequencing (NGS), computational biology,
high-throughput functional screens, and preclinical models (7,
8) to achieve an integrated understanding of premalignant biology
and cancer risk to drive immune-based prevention.
Colorectal Adenoma-Carcinoma Model
Even though the seminal multistep genetic model of human car-
cinogenesis was defined in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma
sequence nearly three decades ago (9), it is unfortunate that NGS
of only 25 sporadic colorectal adenomas have been reported to
date (10, 11). This number contrasts radically with the plethora of
genomic information (12–14) generated by major initiatives at
multiple levels for colorectal carcinomas (CRC). Most reported
molecular analyses of colorectal adenomas have interrogated
only a limited number of genes or restricted-region assessments
of copy number, rendering a narrow view of the biology of pre-
malignancy. New technologies, including human organoids with
CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, are being applied to this
model (15). NGS studies of minute tissue specimens with isolated
reports of small numbers of premalignant lesion types, such as
Barrett’s esophagus (16), ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ
(DCIS, LCIS) (4, 17), serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (18),
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) (19), monoclonal
gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (20), and high-
count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (21), with colorectal
adenomas being the most salient example.
Knowledge on the genomic annotation of intestinal carcino-
genesis has come mainly from the study of premalignant lesions in
hereditary CRC syndromes, which are thought to recapitulate the
two major pathways of genomic instability. Familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP), caused by germ-line adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) mutations, is a molecular model for 85% of sporadic CRC
characterized by Wnt alterations and chromosomal instability (22).
Recent whole-exome sequencing characterized the genomic
landscape of early adenoma tissue in FAP, which confirmed and ex-
tended the proposed “Big Bang” theory of CRC development (11),
identifying >200 somatic hits in 25 adenomas, clonal selection, and a
mutational load similar to that of stage I CRC (23). An estimated 25%
of the mutational load (all passenger mutations) was present in adja-
cent, apparently normal mucosa (field effect). This study (23) and
others (24) in FAP have provided a catalog of the somatic variation
cooperating with APC in early colorectal carcinogenesis and indi-
cated that a substantial proportion of the genomic variation present
in CRCs is acquired in the earliest at-risk tissues. Understanding FAP
biology has led to breakthrough combinatorial chemoprevention for
this devastating syndrome (25).
Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by germ-line defects in the DNA
mismatch repair (MMR) system, is a model for 15% of sporadic
CRCs characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI). The absence
of proficient MMR surveying DNA for these errors generates an
exponential accumulation of frameshift (FS) mutations at micro-
satellite tracts, thus increasing mutation rate by several orders of
magnitude and accelerating oncogenesis (26) (see LS as a Model
for Hypermutability and Immune-Based Prevention, below). Chro-
mosomal instability, defective DNA repair, and APOBEC (apolipo-
protein B mRNA-editing enzyme; discussed in Expanding the Scope of
Immune Prevention to BRCA1/2 and APOBEC-Associated Neoplasia)
are major drivers of oncogenesis and clonal diversity/heterogeneity in
other hereditary and sporadic cancers (27). The role of the
microbiome in CRC risk is discussed below.
Germ-Line–Somatic Landscape
Colorectal neoplasia also provides examples of germ-line effects
on somatic events and phenotype. The location and mechanism
(point mutation versus deletion) of germ-line APC inactivation in FAP
determines the somatic second hit in APC and amount of β-catenin
optimal to promote intestinal carcinogenesis (“‘just right’ model of
APC”) (28). Germ-line 5′ APC mutations in FAP affect interactions
with wild-type APC, allowing residual Wnt activity (29). Germ-line
biallelic MUTYH causes G:T transversions due to base excision repair
defects (24). Further, the APC I1307K (c.3920T > A) polymorphism,
linked to CRC risk (30), generates a hypermutable, mononucleotide
repeat (A8) that impairs replication fidelity, forming a mutational
hotspot facilitating biallelic inactivation of APC.
Germ-line mutations of the transcription factor GATA2 confer
monocytopenia, atypical mycobacterial infections, and a pro-
pensity to develop preleukemia (myelodysplastic syndrome;
MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). GATA2 mutation carriers
that develop myeloid malignancies harbor somatic ASXL1 muta-
tions (and monosomy 7) at rates much greater than expected by
chance, suggesting a functional or epistatic interaction between
these events in myeloid-lineage cells (31). Other examples of he-
reditary mutated transcription factors that predispose to hema-
tologic neoplasia include mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, ETV6, and
PAX5 (32). The culprit germ-line variants are typically heterozy-
gous and may have dominant-negative activity against the
remaining germ-line allele. Cooperating somatic mutations, often
including mutation of the remaining wild-type allele, are clearly
required and can be identified during periods of clonally skewed
hematopoiesis that precede transformation (32).
The development of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) can
involve a JAK2 haplotype (termed 46/1) that is highly associated
with the acquisition of a somatic JAK2 mutation in MPN patients.
Strikingly, the somatic JAK2 mutation associated with the 46/1
haplotype occurs on the cis (vs. trans) allele more often than
predicted by chance, suggesting a local interaction (33). However,
this mutational predisposition effect is not limited to the nearby
JAK2 gene. Patients with mutations of another MPN gene, MPL,
are also more likely to carry the 46/1 variant (34).
Integrated analysis of germ-line and somatic variants is also be-
ginning to inform precision prevention. Large-scale sequencing of
over 4,000 tumors (12 cancer types) from the TCGA found rare germ-
line truncations in 114 cancer-susceptibility-associated genes, rang-
ing in frequency from 4% (AML) to 19% (ovarian cancer) (35).
Of the 1% of lung cancer patients with somatic EGFR T790M re-
sistance mutations at diagnosis, most actually carry germ-line EGFR
T790M mutations. These families appear to have a different bi-
ology of lung neoplasia (slow-growing lung nodules) and so may
be good candidates for lung cancer screening and precision
chemoprevention with T790M inhibitors (36). Finally, repurposed
NGS of “control” blood from large TCGA and GWAS cohorts
identified clonal hematopoiesis as a new premalignant state,
characterized by age-related myeloid malignancy driver mutations
(mostly in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1) (37, 38). The vast ma-
jority of these individuals harbored a single-driver mutation.
Patients with idiopathic cytopenias of undetermined signifi-
cance (ICUS) were noted to have higher rates (∼40%) of clonal
hematopoiesis and possibly transformation to MDS/AML (39,
40). Once germ-line–somatic relationships have been mapped,
an atlas of shared and distinct oncogenic events can be ana-
lyzed for targetability.

 Harnessing the Immune System for Cancer Prevention
There exists a fascinating duality regarding the immune system’s
role in oncogenesis, the depths of which remain incompletely
understood (41, 42). It is well known that inappropriate immune
responses (as seen in chronic inflammatory conditions) are
strongly associated with high risks of developing cancer (e.g., CRC
in ulcerative colitis; 43). Immunosurveillance/immunity, how-
ever, is thought to be a critical mechanism for inhibiting cancer
development and progression, as evidenced by the success of
immune checkpoint inhibitors [e.g., programmed cell death pro-
tein 1 (PD-1) antibodies], which have been a game-changer for a
number of patients, producing deep and durable clinical re-
sponses in a variety of malignancies, particularly high-mutational
burden cancers (13, 44, 45). In parallel, the incredible efficacy of
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has shown the great
promise for using the immune system for cancer prevention (46).
Vaccines to prevent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are
standard practice (46) and work best when given to healthy indi-
viduals before they are exposed to HPV, so as to induce neutral-
izing antibodies against viral proteins while the cervical tissue is
normal, without an immunosuppressive TME. Viral E6 and
E7 proteins are well-understood oncogenic drivers, and CIN is
relatively indolent and directly accessible by routine screening.
Therapeutic vaccine studies targeting E6/E7 antigens in CIN2/3,
including results from single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing,
suggest that inducing efficient trafficking of functional effector
T-cells to the epithelial disease site is critical to eliminate both the
disease and virus (47). HPV E6 induces APOBEC3B, which in turn
mutates chromosomal DNA and most likely contributes to precancer
development (48). HPV also induces tumor-associated stromal fi-
broblasts (49), and E6 inactivates p53, which induces PD-L1 and
cervical Tregs, causing immune evasion (47). HPV16 integration into
the PD-L1 3′UTR enhances PD-L1 expression (50).
Mouse data have clearly shown that tumors can escape immune
recognition by losing their antigenicity in a process termed
“immunoediting” (51, 52). Furthermore, knockout mice lacking an
adaptive immune system have dramatically increased rates of tu-
mor (e.g., intestinal adenoma and adenocarcinoma) formation
compared with wild-type mice (53). In humans, severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) is similarly characterized by fundamental
defects in adaptive immunity, although the associated risk of cancer
(mostly lymphomas) is modest, possibly because SCID is almost
universally fatal by age 2 (without stem cell transplant) as a result of
infections (54). Other forms of inherited immunodeficiency—such
as common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked hyper-IgM syn-
drome, Bloom syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia—have been
linked to increased risks of cancers, predominantly lymphomas but
also a wide spectrum of solid malignancies, MDS and AML (54).
Similar findings were reported in acquired immunosuppression,
including people with HIV/AIDS and solid organ transplant re-
cipients (55). The mechanisms underlying such cancer risks in
immunodeficient patients are not well understood, given the
complex and overlapping functions/components of innate and
adaptive immunity, which may partially compensate for specific
immune defects. Such gaps in knowledge further indicate the
need to fully map the biology of premalignancy.
The Premalignant Antigenic Repertoire and Microenviron-
ment. The premalignant antigenic repertoire/vaccine targets
can include driver mutations and nonmutated self-proteins that
are expressed at abnormal levels. It is unknown what determines
immunogenicity, although it is more complex than simply the
category of antigen (Fig. 1). Posttranslational modifications, such as
Fig. 1. The immunogenic repertoire of premalignancy. The horizontal lines at the bottom represent the layers of factors that can stimulate
immunity, among them germ-line and somatic alterations and their complex dynamic interplay with the inflammatory TME (Upper Right). The
upper half of the figure depicts the progressively immunosuppressive TME from left to right. The epithelial cells (middle row) illustrate two
pathways of genomic instability on the left (irregular cell borders)—MSI and chromosomal instability—which can be inherited or acquired (see
Colorectal Adenoma-Carcinoma Model). Inherited and acquired MSI-H lesions are highly immunogenic. The somatic cell alterations in the middle
include complex posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), onco-fetal, and splice variants, important parts of the immunogenic
repertoire, but their order in terms of cancer risk or immunogenicity is unclear. The cells on the far right middle row are virally infected cells, which
have similar TME issues as the nonviral premalignancies. Vaccine-primed T-cells (Upper Left), capable of generating type I Th and CD8+ cells,
could overcome early TME changes to eradicate cells in the transformation process.

 glycosylation, can have complex, poorly understood effects on
immune response (56) and evasion (57). Tumor-specific mutant
epitopes (called neoantigens) may be important factors for un-
derstanding and determining the specificity of an immunotherapy
(58). This theory was confirmed experimentally in mice using ge-
nomics and bioinformatics to predict those cancer-specific muta-
tions that function as neoantigens and demonstrate their effective
use in cancer vaccines (59). Of note, vaccines against immunogenic
tumor mutations in mice can be as effective as immune checkpoint
blockade (60). This approach has led to considerable interest in the
cancer epitope (mutation) landscape and has supported the po-
tential to generate novel immunogenic neoepitopes. In CRC,
whole-exome sequencing has been implemented to computa-
tionally predict the neoantigenic repertoire from archival speci-
mens (61). A large-scale initiative, including high-throughput mass
spectroscopy and single-cell proteomics (7), and rigorous clinical
characterization and follow-up will be essential to define immuno-
genicity of premalignant antigens.
The first prevention example of a cancer vaccine targeting a
driver mutation in premalignancy involved Kras in a pancreas
genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). Kras mutations are
the earliest genetic drivers in human pancreas neoplasia, present
in both early- and late-stage PanINs. Early Kras-mutated neo-
plastic cells secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-6), VEGF, and GM-CSF,
which recruit Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
adipocytes and neutrophils, macrophage PI3Kγ, and che-
mokines (e.g., CXCL13), which recruit B-cells leading to a pro-
gressively immunosuppressive TME and immune escape (42, 62,
63). Kras-p53-Cre pancreatic GEMM were immunized with a Lis-
teria vector encoded with the KrasG12D mutation and were found
to generate CD8+ T-cells specific for the Kras mutation (64). Kras
vaccine combined with cyclophosphamide Treg depletion sig-
nificantly slowed the progression of early (but not late) PanIN,
compared with control mice. These and other mouse-model data
show the potential of driver mutation-specific vaccination to
prevent premalignant progression (56) and underscore immune
evasion mechanisms. Serious concerns with checkpoint inhibitors
in the prevention setting include potentially severe immune ad-
verse effects and a dearth of long-term safety data. Modulators of
ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins (65) and other epigenetic
regulators (e.g., deliverable forms of miRNAs) and metformin
given during vaccination could reprogram early immunosup-
pressive cell populations. Metformin (a safe FDA-approved oral
diabetes agent) can increase CD8+ cells, reduce T-cell exhaustion,
reprogram macrophages and stellate cells (to reduce desmo-
plasia) in pancreatic neoplasia (66), and can alter T-cell metabo-
lism to generate long-lived immune memory (67, 68).
The influence of the premalignant TME is also well illustrated
in DCIS: integrated DNA- and RNA-seq of high-grade DCIS identified
high rates of p53 pathway inactivation and a molecular subclass
of lesions characterized by a highly proliferative, basal-like pheno-
type with genomic signatures of activated Treg cells and checkpoint
complexes indicative of a tumor-associated immunosuppressive
phenotype (4). Suppressed immunity (e.g., high Tregs and CD8+ HLA-
DR-neg T-cells) correlated with progression from normal to DCIS to
invasive ductal carcinoma. PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are
most prominent in triple-negative DCIS and microinvasive cancer (69).
There is increasing evidence that somatically mutated MDS
cells can alter their TME to provide a clonal growth advantage.
Examples include activation of inflammatory molecules, s100a8
and s100a9, and induction of TP53 in mouse models. Similarly,
MDS cells with various types of somatic mutations can activate
inflammasome-mediated pathways that increase MDSC bone
marrow number (70). Alteration to stromal cells may promote
clonal hematopoiesis (e.g., mice carrying a Dicer1 deletion in
osteoblasts developed clonally derived leukemias) (71).
The presence of a robust adaptive T-cell immune response,
evident either in tumor or peripheral blood from patients with
certain cancers, has been associated with improved survival (72).
Antibody response to vaccines is also important and can enhance
T-cell immunity (73). Naturally occurring cytotoxic T-cell re-
sponses to tumor antigens can be detected in one-third of healthy
people without cancer (74). Precancer-specific natural immune
surveillance also exists and can prevent the development of
cancer (56, 75). For example, MGUS patients can mount a T-cell
immune response to SOX2, a transcription factor critical for self-
renewal in stem cells, which is associated with reduced risk of
progression to multiple myeloma (MM), supporting the potential
for a vaccine to boost SOX2-specific immunity (76).
Host–microbiome interactions are important in premalignancy,
adding to TME complexity (6). Studies in GEMMs have found that
APC loss disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier, facilitating invasion
of microbes and microbial nucleic acids that activate adenoma-
associated macrophages to produce IL-23, which then stimulates
IL-17 production by T-cells, accelerating adenoma development
and progression (77). Bacterial translocation can activate Toll-like
receptors that can up-regulate other inflammatory elements. These
barrier defects drive innate immunosuppressive TME, and adenoma
proliferation (e.g., F
. nucleatum in the TME can inhibit NK-cell cyto-
toxicity producing bacteria-dependent immune evasion) (43, 78).
Metagenome study found different taxa in adenomas compared to
carcinomas and healthy controls (79). Gut microbiota may explain the
provocative link between MMR-deficiency and CRC (80). The inter-
play between the microbiome, virome, autophagy, inflammatory
bowel disease, GWAS, and the immune system is also under active
study in CRC development and prevention (81, 82).
LS as a Model for Hypermutability and Immune-Based Pre-
vention. Somatic hypermutation can arise through diverse mech-
anisms. As described above, MSI is a form of hypermutability in
which DNA MMR defects lead to genome-wide accumulation of
FS mutations within predictable nucleotide repeat loci (micro-
satellites). MSI-related FS mutations drive tumorigenesis by oc-
curring within microsatellite loci that lead to inactivation of tumor
suppressors enriched for genes functionally involved in immune
regulation (e.g., TGFBR2 and BAX) in both CRCs and adenomas
(83). When they occur in coding regions, such mutations generate
FS-mutation-derived peptides (FSP), which function as highly
immunogenic neoantigens and cause specific CD8+ T-cell re-
sponses and neoplastic infiltrates. The “hotspot” nature of these
MSI-related FS mutations leads to FSPs with predictable se-
quences, suggesting that multivalent vaccine development tar-
geting specific, expected T-cell epitopes may be an effective
prevention strategy for MSI-induced neoplasia (83). The feasi-
bility of this approach was demonstrated by using a panel of
FSPs expected to be generated by MSI-induced FS mutations at
a specific hotspot locus within MSH3; engineered CD8+ T-cells
from a healthy volunteer specifically targeted these FSP-lysed,
HLA-matched, high-level MSI (MSI-H) CRC cell lines (84).
MSI may represent a unique form of hypermutability, expressing
high amounts of neoantigens, which up-regulate inhibitory molecules
(e.g., PD-L1) to counterbalance the infiltrating immune cells; this is
distinct from overall mutational load, in that it renders tumors very
susceptible to immune-based destruction. There has been major

 progress in using PD-1 inhibitors to treat advanced cancers with
MSI-H and MMR deficiency (MMR-D), such as those that arise in LS
or sporadic MSI-H CRC (44). LS patients are at very high risk of CRC
and endometrial cancers, and recent data suggest that this classic
LS-cancer spectrum is wider than traditionally appreciated.
The recognition in healthy (screened) LS carriers of MSI-H/
MMR-D in preinvasive, normal-appearing tissues and circulat-
ing FSP-specific T-cells (85) suggests that immune surveillance
mechanisms may help reduce MSI-H tumor development. Histo-
logically normal but MSI-H/MMR-D intestinal crypt foci in LS
carriers harbor MSI-related FS mutations, which may be a key
source of these FSP-specific T-cells (86). There are conflicting data
as to whether the size of LS adenomas correlates with MSI-H/
MMR-D, although this may reflect technical aspects of MSI and
MMR testing rather than actual adenoma biology (87). NGS can
likely address this limitation, because mutational burden appears
to be a reliable surrogate for MSI-H status (8).
In LS-associated MSI-H CRCs and adenomas, immune evasion
can occur by MHC I loss as a result of β2-microglobulin mutations
(a mechanism distinct from sporadic MSI-H CRCs) (88). Addition-
ally, there is evidence of an immune-suppressive TME (increased
density of FOXP3+ Tregs) in normal mucosa adjacent (but not
distant) to CRC in LS patients with wild-type β2-microglobulin (89).
Children who are homozygous for germ-line LS mutations have
biallelic MMR deficiency (BMMR-D) (90) and present a compelling
scenario for vaccine-prevention. BMMR-D confers a devastating
phenotype of pediatric lymphomas, brain tumors, and intestinal
cancers (91). In stark contrast to other pediatric cancers, which
classically display few somatic mutations (1), BMMR-D–associated
cancers have an “ultrahypermutated” phenotype (90) because of
acquisition of somatic FS mutations in the proof-reading do-
mains of the DNA polymerases POLE or POLD1 and have mu-
tational loads exceeding those in adult MSI-H CRC. BMMR-D
cancers may be particularly responsive to PD-1 inhibitors (92).
Expanding the Scope of Immune Prevention to BRCA1/2- and
APOBEC-Associated Neoplasia. LS represents an ideal proof-of-
principle for using immune-based prevention, relevant to other
hereditary cancers. This is particularly important as NGS data
continue to expand the spectrum of cancers linked to various
germ-line mutations, including BRCA1/2 (93). Germ-line BRCA1/2
mutations induce defects in homologous recombination (HR)-
based DNA repair and confer markedly increased risks of cancers
of the breast, ovaries/fallopian tubes, pancreas, prostate, and
melanoma, although NGS germ-line testing suggest that they
may also be linked to cancers more classically LS-associated (CRC
and endometrial cancers) (93). Somatic mutational patterns found
in HR deficient BRCA1/2-associated breast cancers and BRCA2-
mutated prostate cancers demonstrate predictable “signatures”
of somatic mutations (94, 95), suggesting the plausibility of cre-
ating vaccines to target specific hotspot neoantigens. Similarly,
BRCA1/2-associated ovarian cancers (96) have been shown to
exhibit an increased effector lymphocytic reaction (which likely
first develop in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma) (97) and
high numbers of immunogenic mutations.
A growing array of data are examining the role that loss of wild-
type BRCA1/2 function plays in the development and progression
of breast, fallopian tube, pancreatic, and prostatic premalignant
lesions from individuals with germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations, in-
cluding data suggesting that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency promotes
genomic instability in nonneoplastic breast epithelium before
loss of the wild-type allele (98). Nonneoplastic breast epithelium
from BRCA1 mutation carriers have gene-expression profiles similar
to luminal progenitor cells (which differs from the basal fea-
tures of most BRCA1 breast cancers) (99). Further efforts to-
ward characterizing BRCA1/2-associated premalignancy are
vital to developing preventive strategies for these high-risk
patients. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, com-
pelling precision therapy of certain BRCA1/2-associated can-
cers, have been shown to delay mammary tumor development
in BRCA1-deficient mice (100). Exciting data suggest that the
RANKL/RANK pathway has an integral role in breast onco-
genesis in germ-line BRCA1 mutation carriers. Interference
with this pathway produced significant preventive activity, in-
cluding pharmacologic RANK-ligand inhibition (e.g., denosumab)
in BRCA1-mutant breast organoids and Brca1-deficient and
mutation-driven mouse models (101, 102). Denosumab is an
FDA-approved agent for bone loss with an established safety
profile and could be repurposed for prevention trials for healthy
mutation carriers.
NGS and biochemical characterization have identified key
roles of APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes in inducing a hypermutated
phenotype as part of innate immunity. A3 induction is a critical
early event in HPV-related neoplasia (see above). A3 can be in-
duced by IFN-α, IFN-γ, and other inflammatory cytokines (103),
although the induction mechanism (104) in nonviral cancers is
unclear and the timing varies by site and etiology (27, 103). A3A
and A3B have intrinsic preference for deaminating cytosine resi-
dues in TCA and TCG trinucleotide contexts, and it is thus as-
sumed that A3B-mediated neoplasia will be characterized by
A3B-catalyzed mutational hotspots (e.g., generating PIK3CA
driver mutations at helical domain hotspots E542K and E545K)
(27) that could be used as part of a vaccine. A common germ-line
APOBEC3A/3B chimeric deletion polymorphism (ΔA3B) has been
associated with risk of breast, liver, and certain other cancers
(105–108). Paradoxically, this ΔA3B deletion leads to increased
A3A activity as a result of increased stability of the chimeric
APOBEC3A/B mRNA (109). This increased A3A activity is thought
to underlie the associated modest breast cancer risk, because can-
cers associated with these ΔA3B polymorphisms have A3 mutation
signatures (distinct from those seen in HR-deficient or MMR-D breast
cancers) that correlate with germ-line copy number (105) and
seemingly higher penetrance of hypermutability and immune acti-
vation (106, 108). Study of the regulation of APOBEC3 in neoplasia
will be critical, including ADAR1 oncogenic effects linking RNA
editing to an innate inflammatory TME and potential suppression of
hypermutation and immunity (110). Furthermore, the ΔA3B poly-
morphism is highly prevalent in certain populations (37% East Asians,
58% Native Americans, >90% Pacific Islanders) (111), suggesting that
vaccines targeting A3-related neoantigens could have an important
public health impact for preventing both ΔA3B- and viral-associated
cancers (27, 103, 107, 109), the former possibly providing a roadmap
to investigate preventive approaches for other germ-line polymor-
phisms linked to cancer risk. Increasing evidence from GWAS
suggest a substantial germ-line effect in adult “sporadic” tumors
(112), and suggest that most loci identified in cancer patients
are present in the precursor (e.g., DCIS) and can influence
chemoprevention (113, 114).
Summary and Next Steps
A new national investment in cancer—driven by the Vice President’s
Cancer Moonshot Initiative that includes the NIH, academia, Food
and Drug Administration, private foundations, philanthropic
partners, and industry—includes prevention and cancer vaccines

 (115, cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/
blue-ribbon-panel/blue-ribbon-panel-report-2016.pdf). A large fund
infusion from The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 advanced the TCGA from a small pilot program of three cancer
types to the tremendous resource it has become (116). A similar
opportunity exists in the realm of premalignant biology: a new
prospective initiative in this setting could leverage and expand
TCGA, GWAS, and related model infrastructures for systematic
specimen collection, processing, storage, analyses to bioinformatics
and data sharing (116, 117).
This initiative will require collaborations across diverse disci-
plines. For example, the oncogenic mechanisms of IDH mutations
[discovered through broad sequencing (118)] remained unclear
until modern metabolomic profiling (119) detected the novel
“oncometabolite” 2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits TETs and
other enzymes that are important in certain premalignancies (120),
thereby identifying a completely novel method of oncogenesis
and turning a genetic discovery into a drug and vaccine target.
There is also a need for: (i) better preclinical models, e.g., CRISPR/
Cas9 engineered immunosuppressive mouse strains (121), im-
mune organoids (122), and new model organisms (e.g., zebrafish)
providing insight into early premalignant biology, and the role of
epigenetic reprogramming in transformation (123), (ii) discern
site-specific patterns and timing of driver mutations and genomic
instability in neoplastic progression (124) and specific acquired
mutations predictive of immune resistance in premalignancy (88)
and cancer (125), (iii) imaging immune responses (e.g., NK- and
T-cell subtype trafficking) and TME composition to optimize
priming and boosting regimens (126), and (iv) new single cell and
computational methods to understand the increasingly complex
cellular (e.g., adipocyte, myocyte interplay) compartment and
tissue microenvironment (e.g., aging fibroblast effects on adap-
tive immunity) from which the malignancy arises (7, 127, 128).
The development of effective prevention will not be easy (1), but
the potential public health benefits are extensive as can be illus-
trated by the case of cervical cancer, for which screening and HPV
vaccination offer the potential to eradicate this disease, whereas
recent progress in treating advanced disease included 2- to 3-mo
improvements in median survival (129). Cancer vaccines have
been studied extensively in thousands of people for many de-
cades and have a very favorable safety profile setting the stage
for prevention testing (56). HPV vaccine research supporting one-
or two-dose regimens may apply to other cancer prevention
vaccines and would greatly improve costs and adherence (46).
The initial phase of this initiative should include LS, clonal
hematopoiesis/ICUS, and CIN—an inherited syndrome, blood, and
viral premalignancy, respectively—which also serve as models for
related disorders. The rationale for cancer-prevention vaccines in
healthy LS carriers is particularly compelling: early immune sur-
veillance, reduced MHC loss, predictable FSP patterns, high cancer
risk, and young, immunocompetent probands who require serial
cancer screening (85). Potential vaccine benefit could extend to LS-
associated cancers beyond just CRC, because MSI-H has been
found in a wide spectrum of preinvasive LS neoplasia (e.g., 130).
This approach would also facilitate vaccine-based prevention
for sporadic MSI-H carcinogenesis, which is implicated in subsets
of many cancers (131). Outside of the colorectum and stomach,
however, little is known about MSI in sporadic premalignancy.
Sporadic MSI-H CRCs that arise from sessile serrated adenomas
demonstrate FS mutations at the same hotspot microsatellite loci as
in LS CRC. Although LS awareness is increasing the use of universal
tumor testing of CRC (and now endometrial) specimens for MSI-H/
MMR-D (132) and access to NGS germ-line testing, implementation
is a major challenge. The estimated prevalence of LS in the general
United States population is 1:280 (1.1 million). Colonoscopies are
highly effective at reducing CRC risk in LS patients, but strategies
for preventing other LS-associated cancers are limited (132). Exist-
ing infrastructure includes the international Colon Cancer Family
Registry (133). Next steps could include web-based patient re-
cruitment, successfully developed for other related hereditary
cancer efforts (e.g., the PROMPT registry, promptstudy.info) and
statewide LS registries. These registries would facilitate rapid, large-
scale, systematic collection of data and tissue samples from LS and
serve as a model that could be expanded to other inherited cancers,
such as pancreatic cancer risk/precursors (e.g., identified by
germline CDKN2A mutations) to drive vaccine prevention (134)
and early detection (135). GWAS (and other) modifiers of high-
penetrance mutation effects on risk, biology, precursors, and sites
are also needed (136).
The timing is ideal to include clonal hematopoiesis in the initial
phase of this initiative (37–40). First, it is important to leverage existing
efforts of the National MDS Study (https://thenationalmdsstudy.net/),
which will now include a longitudinal biobanking cohort of 500
patients with ICUS. Similarly, the MDS/AML CONNECT Registry
sponsored by Celgene will follow 200 ICUS patients over time.
Second, there is an opportunity to partner with the Leukemia and
Lymphoma Society, patient advocacy groups, and commercial
hematopathology laboratories to rapidly identify thousands of
potential patients for focused longitudinal studies. Third, innovative
prevention, including immune approaches, which have shown
promise in MDS and AML, need to be developed for patients at
highest risk of malignant transformation (to minimize over diagno-
sis). Patients with clonal hematopoiesis can harbor small clones for
long periods of time (39, 40), and provocatively can account for
“therapy-related” MDS/AML (137). Drugs targeting the inflamma-
some and innate immune responses implicated in remodeling the
microenvironment to favor clonal expansion and vaccines against
clonal antigens (138) are potential approaches. Analogous ap-
proaches can be adopted for MGUS and MBL. Solid-tumor inci-
dence is three- to fourfold higher in MBL and CLL patients vs.
healthy controls, likely due to defects in immune surveillance, which
could dampen cancer vaccine response (139). Lenalidomide is in
clinical trial to improve vaccine response in MBL via its beneficial
T-cell effects (NCT02309515). Focusing on premalignancies of the
blood has several advantages, including the ease of repeatedly
acquiring neoplastic cells to study their clonal evolution over time,
and although slightly more invasive, repeated access to the bone
marrow to study changes in the cellular microenvironment is also
safe and feasible within the scope of research study. Furthermore,
study of MPNs (120) provide the only direct data that somatic
mutation order (JAK2 and TET2) can greatly influence disease
features.
Finally, expanding the development of vaccines for HPV-
related neoplasia is a major global need (46). CIN provides an
invaluable model for developing these vaccines, for example:
targeting E6/7 and/or A3B (to prevent other HPV-related can-
cers), including routine screening for longitudinal follow-up;
and nonviral vaccines, which share premalignant biology (e.g.,
p53, A3B), T-cell trafficking, TME features (e.g., PD-L1, Tregs),
and mechanisms of immune evasion. Epstein–Barr virus vaccine
development has been more challenging than HPV in part be-
cause of complex virion surface and viral antigen expression
patterns (115, 140). Analogous to the TCGA pan-cancer analy-
ses (117), it will be important to combine premalignancy omic

 and immune TME data from multiple sites, etiologies, and types
to understand molecular alterations, timing, and interactions to
target common and distinct events that drive oncogenesis
across different lesions. The central theme of this initiative, to
elucidate premalignant biology, requires collaborations across
diverse disciplines, and leveraging other related initiatives,
including the Global Human Vaccines Project, which brings
tremendous expertise from infectious diseases and immunology
to immune oncology, focused on decoding immune response,
evasion, and immunogenicity (141).
Prevention research has produced encouraging results (25, 135,
142–144), in some cases possibly due to previously unrecognized
immune effects (5, 67, 145–147). To move this field from isolated
examples of progress to near elimination of all cancers will take a
radically different focus and approach to premalignant disease
and cancer prevention. For example, an imperative of cancer vac-
cines is the induction of long-term memory T-cell responses (68),
overcoming a major limitation of chemoprevention. Fulfilling this
vision will require a concerted effort across different initiatives
and disciplines, the defining theme of the concept of Convergence
Research (www.convergencerevolution.net/2016-report). We will
need large-scale, systematic, integrated NGS with multiple omics
and immuno-informatic platforms and clinically annotated longitu-
dinal follow-up to lay the foundation of an effective framework for
more precise early detection (e.g., liquid biopsy) and prevention and
to develop cancer vaccines that reprogram the immune response at
the earliest stages to durably reject tumor development. Providing
adequate resources and developing multidisciplinary teams of ex-
pert prevention-focused scientists is the roadmap to success.
