ABSTRACT
Objective Sexual activity is a central component of
intimate relationships, but sexual function may be
impaired by coronary heart disease (CHD). There have
been few representative population-based comparisons
of sexual behaviour and concerns in people with and
without CHD. We therefore investigated these issues in a
large nationally representative sample of older people.
Methods We analysed cross-sectional data from 2979
men and 3711 women aged 50 and older from the
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Sexual behaviour
and concerns were assessed by validated self-completion
questionnaire and analyses were weighted for non-
response. Covariates included age, partnerships status
and comorbidities.
Results There were 376 men and 279 women with
CHD. Men with CHD were less likely to be sexually
active (68.7% vs 80.0%, adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI
0.47 to 0.81), thought less about sex (74.7% vs
81.9%, OR 0.72, CI 0.54 to 0.95), and reported more
erectile difficulties (47.4% vs 38.1%, OR 1.46, CI 1.10
to 1.93) than men without CHD. Effects were more
pronounced among those diagnosed within the past
4 years. Women diagnosed <4 years ago were also less
likely to be sexually active (35.4% vs 55.6%, OR 0.44,
CI 0.23 to 0.84). There were few differences in
concerns about sexual activity. Cardiovascular
medication showed weak associations with erectile
dysfunction.
Conclusions There is an association between CHD and
sexual activity, particularly among men, but the impact
of CHD is limited. More effective advice after diagnosis
might reverse the reduction in sexual activity, leading to
improved quality of life.
INTRODUCTION
There is growing interest in sexual behaviour and
sexual concerns in people with coronary heart
disease (CHD).1 2 Sexual activity is a central com-
ponent of intimate relationships, and impaired sex
life can reduce quality of life and increase risk of
depression.3–5
Advice
given
to
patients
about
resumption of sexual activity after acute cardiac
events or surgery is variable, and many patients
fear that sexual activity might damage cardiac
health or even cause acute events.1 6 7
Reduced sexual activity and satisfaction, pro-
blems
with
erections
and
difficulty
achieving
orgasm have been described in CHD.8–12 However,
many studies have used samples recruited from a
single centre or have not included appropriate age-
matched comparison groups. CHD typically occurs
at older ages when frequency of sexual activity is
reduced compared with earlier years, and problems
such as erectile dysfunction and reduced capacity
for
sexual
arousal
in
women
become
more
common.3 13 14 Studies that have included com-
parison groups without CHD have often shown
little specific association between CHD and sexual
dysfunction.10 13
There is a need for high-quality evidence from
representative population studies of older people
comparing individuals with and without CHD. W
e
therefore carried out a detailed study of sexual
activity, sexual behaviour and concern about sex in
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA),
comparing participants with and without CHD,
taking age, partnership status and comorbidities
into account. Cardiovascular medication may be
relevant to the sexual activity of people with CHD,
particularly
in
relation
to
erectile
function
in
men,13
15
though
data
on
women
are
more
limited.16 W
e hypothesised that when comparisons
are made with men and women without CHD of
similar age,
and
when
partnership
status
and
comorbid health problems are taken into account,
there would be few aspects of sexual activity that
would be impaired in CHD. W
e also compared
individuals with a diagnosis of CHD within the
past 4 years with those who had CHD for 4 or
more years, in order to test whether sexual difficul-
ties would be more common in people with recent
diagnoses.
METHODS
Study population
ELSA is a longitudinal panel study of men and
women aged 50 or more living in England that
started in 2002. The sample is assessed on a two
yearly basis, and these data were collected in wave
6
(2012/2013).
The
sample
is
periodically
refreshed to ensure the full age range is main-
tained,
and
comparisons
of
sociodemographic
characteristics with the national census show that
the sample is representative of the English popula-
tion.17 The general methods of data collection
are detailed at http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk. The
Sexual Relationships and Activities Questionnaire
(SRA-Q) was administered as a self-completion
measure and was returned by 7079 (67%) partici-
pants. W
e excluded individuals who failed to state
whether or not they had been sexually active over
the last year, and respondents who did not have
CHD but had a history of stroke or heart failure,
since these conditions may have a shared aetiology
with CHD. The study sample therefore consisted
of
6690
respondents,
2979
men
and
3711

Definition of CHD
The presence of CHD was defined as a doctor diagnosis of myo-
cardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris. Participants provided
this information at biennial waves of data collection, so the
CHD cases were subsequently divided into those who had been
diagnosed within the past 4 years or ≥4 years ago.
Sexual activity, sexual behaviour and sexual concerns
The SRA-Q has been described in detail elsewhere.3 The ques-
tionnaire was derived from previously validated measures with
modifications to ensure comparability with the National Social
Life, Health and Aging Study in the USA18 and with the
National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in the UK.12
It covers a wide range of information on attitudes to sex; fre-
quency of sexual activities and behaviours; problems with sexual
activities and function; concerns and worries about sexual activ-
ities and sexual function; and satisfaction with sex. The male
and female versions of the SRA-Q are available online at http://
www.elsa-project.ac.uk/documentation. Participants completed
the questionnaire in private and returned it in a sealed envelope.
Details of the items presented in this report are provided in the
online supplementary material.
Other variables
Partnership status was defined as whether or not the respondent
had a spouse or partner at the time of wave 6 data collection.
W
e included physician diagnosed diabetes as a covariate,
together with a comorbidity index that summed physician diag-
noses of cancer of any type, arthritis of any type and chronic
lung disease within the last 4 years. Objective information about
medication was obtained during a visit by a research nurse to
the participants’ homes in which details of prescribed medicines
were recorded.
Statistical analysis
W
e used weights to correct for sampling probabilities and for dif-
ferential non-response and to calibrate back to the 2011 National
Census population distributions for age and sex. The weights
accounted for the differential probability of being included in
W
ave 6 of ELSA, and for non-response to the SRA-Q. Details can
be found in http://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/5050/mrdoc/pdf/
5050_elsa_w6_technical_report_v1.pdf. W
e used logistic regres-
sion to analyse the association between CHD and sexual activities
and concerns, with age, partnership status, diabetes and number
of comorbidities as covariates. Both age and comorbidities
were modelled as continuous variables. Separate analyses were
carried out on men and women. The results are presented as
age-adjusted percentages and adjusted ORs, with 95% CIs. The
no CHD group was the reference category. Within the CHD
group, we tested selected associations with medication as detailed
in the Results section. All analyses were repeated on MI cases
alone; results were similar, so are only described when they
differed from the complete CHD sample. In addition, we carried
out two sensitivity analyses. First, we stratified the analysis by
marital/partnership status. Second, we excluded participants with
diabetes.
RESULTS
There were 2979 men and 3711 women in the study, of whom
376 (12.6%) men and 279 (7.5%) women had CHD. CHD had
been diagnosed 4 or more years ago in 294 (78.2%) men and
211 (75.6%) women, and of these, 225 (68.4%) had been diag-
nosed ≥4 years previously. There were 329 MI diagnoses among
the
CHD
cases,
including
218
men
and
111
women.
Participants with CHD were significantly older than those
without
CHD
(men:
means
71.7±9.4
vs
65.6±8.7 years;
women: means 73.8±10.0 vs 65.1±9.1 years, both p<0.001).
W
e found that 70.7% of men and 47.7% of women with CHD
were married or living with a partner, compared with 77.7%
and 65.0% of men and women without CHD (p<0.001).
Diabetes was more common in men and women with CHD than
without CHD (23.5% vs 10.5% and 27.6% vs 8.5%, respect-
ively, p<0.001), and the number of comorbidities was signifi-
cantly higher in CHD cases in both men and women (both
p<0.001). A total of 93.6% of men and 94.7% of women
reported being exclusively heterosexual over their lifetimes.
Sexual activity and CHD
The majority of men (78.6%) and women (55.1%) in this study
were sexually active. But fewer men with CHD than without
CHD reported any sexual activity over the past year (68.7% vs
80%, table 1). After adjustment for covariates, CHD was inde-
pendently associated with a 38% reduction in the odds of
reporting any sexual activity. W
omen with CHD were also less
likely to report any sexual activity than those without CHD, but

 the difference was not significant. Other independent predictors
of not being sexually active were older age (OR=0.89 and 0.91
for men and women), not being married (OR=0.56 and 0.21),
diabetes (OR=0.53 and 0.54) and comorbidities (OR=0.76 and
0.85, all p<0.001). CHD was associated with lower rates of
thinking about sex in men, a difference that was significant after
adjustment for covariates (table 1, p=0.022).
Among sexually active participants, we found no differences
in the frequency either of sexual intercourse or other sexual
behaviours (kissing, petting or fondling) related to CHD.
W
omen with CHD did not experience increased difficulty in
becoming sexually aroused (table 1). However, CHD was asso-
ciated with a 46% increase in the odds of men being never or
only sometimes able to get or keep an erection good enough for
sexual activity (p=0.009), adjusting for covariates. Erectile diffi-
culties were also associated with older age (OR=1.13), diabetes
(OR=2.24) and comorbidities (OR=1.33). There were no sig-
nificant differences in difficulty achieving orgasm in participants
with and without CHD.
Sexual activity and years since diagnosis
The reduction in prevalence of sexual activity among partici-
pants with CHD was related to the time since diagnosis. Men
who had been diagnosed 4 or more years ago had a 19% reduc-
tion in odds of being sexually active, while those diagnosed
<4 years ago had a 76% decrease in odds compared with men
free of CHD (table 2). Among women, there was no difference
from controls in those diagnosed ≥4 years ago, but there was a
56% reduction in those with more recent diagnoses (p=0.013).
Years since diagnosis was also associated with rates of thinking
about sex among men, with bigger reductions in men diagnosed
<4 years ago. A similar pattern was observed for men in rela-
tion to erectile difficulties (table 2), with a twofold increase in
those diagnosed <4 years ago.
Sexual concerns and CHD
Table 3 summarises findings relating concerns about sexual
activity and function with CHD. There was no association
between CHD and concerns about level of sexual desire, fre-
quency of sexual activity or satisfaction with sex life. The only
significant difference was that more men with CHD expressed
concern about orgasmic experience. Levels of sexual concerns
did not differ systematically between the groups with recent or
more distant diagnosis.
Sexual activity and MI
The pattern of results was largely the same when the analysis
was limited to MI. The only major difference was related to
erectile difficulties. Men who had experienced an MI within the
past 4 years showed a greater prevalence of erectile difficulties
compared with those without disease (62.1% vs 38.7%) than in
the overall CHD analysis. The adjusted odds were 3.63 (CI 1.93
to 6.84, p<0.001). By contrast, men with MI ≥4 years earlier
did not report excess erectile difficulty (prevalence 39.4%).
Association with medication
The most common cardiovascular medications in the CHD
group were statins (78.7%), aspirin (64.2%), ACE inhibitors
(56.8%), β-blockers (49.2%), glyceryl trinitrate (31.9%) and
calcium
channel
blockers
(29.6%).

 achieving orgasm in men. T
wo associations were significant:
men prescribed diuretics were more likely to report erectile dif-
ficulties (adjusted OR 3.70, CI 1.33 to 10.33, p=0.012) as were
men prescribed statins (adjusted OR 2.03, CI 1.01 to 4.09,
p=0.048). There were no other associations between any class
of medication and sexual activity.
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and
tadalafil were rarely reported, being used by only 5.7% of men
with CHD and 7.4% of those without CHD. These numbers
were too small for statistical analysis.
Sensitivity analyses
Stratification of the sample by marital/partnership status resulted
in similar findings to those observed in the complete sample,
with no major differences in association with CHD in the two
groups. Excluding people with diabetes did not markedly alter
the results with respect to CHD.
DISCUSSION
This study of sexual behaviour and concerns about sexual func-
tion showed that men with CHD were less likely to have been
sexually active over the past year, thought less about sex and
reported more erectile problems than men without CHD.
Differences remained significant after adjusting for age, partner
status and comorbidities, and were more pronounced among
those diagnosed in the past 4 years than in men with longer
standing disease. W
omen diagnosed within the past 4 years were
less likely to have been sexually active than those diagnosed
≥4 years ago. There were few differences in sexual satisfaction
or concerns about sexual activity and function, and cardiovascu-
lar medication showed limited associations with sexual function.
Results were similar when the analyses were restricted to people
who had experienced an MI, suggesting that associations are
more dependent on the presence of CHD than on its clinical
presentation. Both marital status and diabetes were related to
sexual behaviour, but did not affect the associations with CHD.
The study involved a large representative sample of men and
women aged 50 and over living in England, with 8.7% men and
8.0% women being aged 80 or older. The prevalence of CHD
was 12.6% in men and 7.5% in women, similar to those
observed nationally in the UK.19 As expected, CHD cases were
older on average than the remainder of the sample, and were
less likely to be married or in a partnership, and had greater
comorbidities.
These
factors
are
related
to
sexual
behav-
iour,3 13 14 so these were taken into account in the analyses.
The response rate of 67% to the SRA-Q was high, considering
the intimate nature of the items, and we weighted our analyses
to take account of differential non-response.
The most striking difference was the reduced proportion of
respondents with CHD who were sexually active. This was par-
ticularly evident among those with recently diagnosed CHD.
W
e found age-adjusted differences of 26.4% in men and 20.2%
in women between no CHD and respondents who had been
diagnosed <4 years. However, sexual activity was still common
in the latter group, with over half men and a third of women
being sexually active.
Among those who were sexually active, we found no differ-
ences in the frequency of intercourse and other sexual behav-
iour. Additionally, the differences in concern about different
aspects of sex between people with and without CHD were
small. This strongly suggests that the primary issue among older
people with CHD is whether or not they resume sexual activity
following diagnosis, not the behaviours of those who are sexu-
ally active. Quantitative and qualitative research indicates that
only a minority of patients receive advice about resumption of
sexual activity following MI or cardiac surgery,6 7 20 despite
guidance issued by the European Society of Cardiology and the
American Heart Association.1 2 A large multicentre study of
younger patients showed that many patients are given advice
about resuming sexual activity after acute MI that is not consist-
ent with guidelines, including recommendations to limit the fre-
quency of sex and take a passive role.7 There is a significant but
very small risk that sexual activity can trigger acute cardiac
events,21 and beliefs about such effects may be magnified in
patients and their families unless healthcare staff provide appro-
priate advice.
Rates of sexual activity in ELSA are comparable with other
contemporary
studies
of
older
people
in
the
UK
and
Europe.12 22 Sexual activity rates in people with CHD have
varied substantially across studies.9 Addis et al23 assessed a large
sample of women aged 50 and older with CHD in 1994–1996
and found that only 39% were sexually active, compared with
49% in the present study. An analysis from the W
omen’s Health
Initiative showed that 52% of those aged 50–79 were sexually
active, with no differences related to CHD.10 Other researchers
have reported greater dissatisfaction with sex among people
with CHD than those measured in the present study,8 10 but dif-
ferences in measures and in the era in which data were collected
make direct comparisons difficult.
W
e investigated the possible role of cardiac medication, but
the only significant relationships were between erectile dysfunc-
tion and prescription of diuretics and statins. The association
with diuretics has been observed in previous studies,15 24 but
the statin effect has not. Since we tested several aspects of
sexual behaviour and many different medications, the two sig-
nificant associations may be chance effects. W
e were not able to
analyse associations between phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor
use and sexual activity because of small numbers.
This study has a number of strengths. W
e collected data
within
a
large
well-characterised
nationally
representative
sample of older men and women. W
e assessed sexual behaviour
and concerns with a detailed multidimensional inventory, in
contrast with studies that have asked one or two broad ques-
tions.8 10 23 W
e ascertained medication by direct examination of
prescription medication rather than relying on self-report.
Because the data were embedded in a longitudinal study, we
were able to ascertain the length of time since diagnosis.
However, the study was cross-sectional so no causal conclusions
can be drawn, and our data are not able to contribute to the
debate
concerning
erectile
dysfunction
and
cardiovascular
disease risk.25 The time frame for different aspects of sexual
behaviour and concerns was dictated by the structure of the
SRA-Q. The division into recent (<4 years) and more distant
CHD diagnoses was determined by the data collection schedule
of ELSA and may not have been optimal. As with most
large-scale observational studies, CHD was based on reported
physician diagnoses. This may result in some error, although the
evidence
from
direct
comparisons
is
that
little
bias
is
introduced.26 27
Sex is an important feature of many intimate relationships,
and sexual difficulties can be a major source of interpersonal
conflict and marital stress, contributing to reduced quality of
life.5 These factors are important in CHD, since marital tension
and reduced social support may augment risk of recurrent
cardiac events.28 29 Our findings are generally encouraging in
showing little increased risk of concerns about sex in either men
or women or sexual difficulties in women with CHD. However,
the results do indicate that CHD is associated with a reduced

 proportion of people who are sexually active, particularly among
those with a diagnosis in the past 4 years. More effective advice
about sexual activity after diagnosis might reverse this pattern,
leading to more satisfying personal lives. The heightened risk of
erectile dysfunction and associated concerns in men with CHD
requires focused advice and active management.1
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Sexual activity can be adversely affected by coronary heart
disease (CHD). But few studies have investigated sexual
behaviour in nationally representative samples involving
similarly aged comparison groups.
What might this study add?
Men aged 50 and over with CHD were less likely to be sexually
active and reported more erectile problems than those without
CHD, with associations being more pronounced among those
diagnosed in the past 4 years. There were few differences in
women, and sexual satisfaction and concerns about sex
appeared unaffected in both men and women.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Systematic advice about resumption of sexual activity after
diagnosis might restore sexual activity more rapidly, potentially
benefiting close relationships.
