Abstract
Introduction. Active resistance is considered to be the ‘normal’ reaction during
rape. However, studies have indicated that similar to animals, humans exposed
to extreme threat may react with a state of involuntary, temporary motor
inhibition known as tonic immobility. The aim of the present study was to
assess the occurrence of tonic immobility during rape and subsequent post-
traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Material and methods. Tonic
immobility at the time of the assault was assessed using the Tonic Immobility
Scale in 298 women who had visited the Emergency clinic for raped women
within 1 month of a sexual assault. Information about the assault and the
victim characteristics were taken from the structured clinical data files. After
6 months, 189 women were assessed regarding the development of post-
traumatic stress disorder and depression. Results. Of the 298 women, 70%
reported
significant
tonic
immobility
and
48%
reported
extreme
tonic
immobility during the assault. Tonic immobility was associated with the
development of post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.50–5.03,
p = 0.001) and severe depression (OR 3.42; 95% CI 1.51–7.72, p = 0.003) at
6 months. Further, previous trauma history (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48–3.77,
p < 0.001) and psychiatric treatment history (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.26–3.19,
p = 0.003)
were
associated
with
the
tonic
immobility
response.
Conclusions. Tonic immobility during rape is a common reaction associated
with
subsequent
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
and
severe
depression.
Knowledge of this reaction in sexual assault victims is important in legal
matters and for healthcare follow up.

Introduction
Tonic immobility (TI) in animals has been considered an
evolutionary adaptive defensive reaction to a predatory
attack when resistance is not possible and other resources
are unavailable (1). Far less is known about TI in
humans. The legal system seeks visible signs of resistance
because when it is absent, it is more difficult to prove a
sexual assault (2). However, a substantial number of vic-
tims do not resist the attacker in any way (3). In humans,
TI has been described as an involuntary, temporary state
of motor inhibition in response to situations involving
intense fear. It has been further described as a catatonic-

 like state with muscle hyper- or hypo-tonicity, tremor,
lack of vocalization, analgesia and relative unresponsive-
ness to external stimuli. Most studies on TI in humans
have focused on sexual assault victims. This is probably
because there is a postulated similarity between sexual
assaults and predatory encounters (1). Sexual assault has
also been described as one of the most traumatic experi-
ences a person can be exposed to (4), and studies have
shown that TI scores are significantly higher in victims of
sexual abuse compared with other types of trauma (5).
In these studies, significant immobility has been reported
in 37% (6), 42% (7), and 52% of the sexual assault
victims (8).
Along with other peritraumatic stress reactions, TI has
been associated with the development of post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (9–11). Lima and colleagues (10)
showed that among victims of violence, TI predicted the
severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as a
poor response to treatment. Further, Bovin and collegues
(12) suggested that TI could be one path through which
victims develop PTSD. Volchan and collegues (13) sug-
gested that patients with PTSD were more likely to expe-
rience TI during subsequent stress.
However, most studies on TI in humans have been ret-
rospective (7–12,14). Further, earlier studies have been
based on small sample sizes, making assumptions on cau-
sal relationships hazardous.
In the present study, we wanted to assess TI during
rape in a large group of sexual assault victims at a follow-
up appointment shortly after the emergency visit. We
hypothesized that in screening a large clinical sample
shortly after an assault, the experience of TI would be
even greater than what has been found in earlier studies
because it would reduce the possibility of a recall bias.
Additionally,
we
wanted
to
explore
the
association
between TI and the development of PTSD. In an earlier
study (15) we found that the major risk factors for PTSD
included having been sexually assaulted by a group, suf-
fering from Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) shortly after the
assault, having been subjected to several acts during the
assault, having been injured and having a history of ear-
lier traumatization. Therefore, we hypothesized that TI
increases the risk of PTSD development, even after
adjusting for these other known risk factors.
Material and methods
The study was performed at the Emergency Clinic for
Raped Women in Stockholm, Sweden. In Stockholm all
sexual assault victim care is centralized to this unit and
the clinic is open 24 h a day. The clinic offers medical
and forensic examination within 1 month of the sexual
assault and services approximately 600 patients per year
after rape. All services are free of charge and independent
of police reporting. At the time of the study, the clinic
saw only female patients.
At a medical check-up appointment, approximately
10–14 days after the acute visit, all eligible women were
asked to participate in the study. Women were found eli-
gible if they were over the age of 18 years and were liter-
ate in Swedish. In addition, the consenting women
needed to be able to participate in an interview that
assessed PTSD symptoms and complete self-report ques-
tionnaires about their mental health. The participants
were informed of the research procedure and risks, and
they signed written consent.
Of 1047 eligible women, 317 female victims of rape or
attempted rape, who had been in contact with the clinic
between February 2009 and December 2011, agreed to
participate in the study. Of these, 298 women completed
the assessment regarding TI and 63% of the Post-trau-
matic came back for the 6-month visit, leading to a final
sample of 189 women who were also assessed for the pos-
sible development of PTSD (15). Consenting women
completed four self-rating questionnaires: Tonic Immobil-
ity
Scale
(TIS),
Beck
Depression
Index
(BDI),
Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), and Stan-
ford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ). Infor-
mation on any history of earlier sexual assaults, sexual
assault in childhood, and the number of other earlier
traumas were taken from the PDS questionnaire. Infor-
mation regarding victim and assault characteristics were
taken from the clinic’s structured data files. Six months
after the rape, study participants were assessed regarding
PTSD using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th
edition (DSM-IV; SCID-I), and they completed two of
the self-rating questionnaires (BDI, SASRQ).
Measures
The Tonic Immobility Scale-Adult Form (TIS-A; 16), Part
1, is a 12-item questionnaire designed to assess the core
features and components of TI. A Swedish version of the
scale was used that had been translated using forward

 translation and then back-translated by an independent
translator for control. The first 10 questions are answered
using a seven-point Likert scale (range 0–6). To obtain
the total score, the item scores are summed (Table 1).
Higher scores in response to items 1–10 reflect greater TI
behaviors. The TIS-A consists of two subscales: TTI
(seven items) and Fear (three items) (7). The TI scale
includes questions that assess various aspects of TI, such
as feeling frozen or paralyzed, the inability to move
although not restrained, the inability to call out or
scream, numbness, feeling cold, fearing for one’s life, and
feeling detached from self (scores 0–42). The Fear sub-
scale includes items that assess fear/panic, trembling/shak-
ing and feelings of detachment from surroundings (scores
0–18). Using the same cut-off scores as earlier studies
(7,8), a total score > 21 represented a significant TI and a
total score ≥ 28 represented extreme TI. Symptoms of
fear were considered clinically significant when a respon-
der’s total score on the Fear subscale was ≥ 9. In the pre-
sent study the Cronbach’s a was 0.87 for the whole
questionnaire, 0.81 for the TI factor, and 0.62 for the fear
factor.
The Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II (17), includes 21
questions that measure depressive symptoms. The cut-off
points for the sum scores were 0–13 (no depression), 14–
19 (mild depression), 20–28 (moderate depression), and
≥ 29 (severe depression). Cronbach’s a was 0.90.
The Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, PDS (18)
was used at baseline to assess the PTSD symptom score
(0–51), a probable pre-existing PTSD diagnosis (using the
DSM-IV criteria) and lifetime experience of traumatic
events.
PTSD
was
diagnosed
at
baseline
when
the
respondent in PDS part 1 reported having been exposed
to or witnessing a traumatic event that, according to PDS
part 2, involved a threat to life or physical integrity;
according to PDS part 3, having at least one re-experien-
cing symptom, at least three avoidance symptoms, and at
least two arousal symptoms; that symptoms lasted for
over 1 month; and according to PDS part 4, also caused
impairment in the respondents’ daily life in at least one
area. Cronbach’s a was 0.85.
The Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, SASRQ
(19), was used at baseline and at the 6-month visit. The
SASRQ is a 30-item self-report instrument with three addi-
tional questions relevant to the diagnosis of ASD. The
instrument can be used as a Likert scale (0–5), where higher
scores reflect greater symptoms, or dichotomously (0–2: 0,
3–5: 1), where 0 means absence and 1 means presence of a
symptom. According to the DSM-IV, a diagnosis of ASD
requires at least three of the five types of dissociative symp-
toms, one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance symp-
tom, one marked anxiety/increased arousal symptom, and
impairment in at least one important area of functioning.
We also used the SASRQ total score to measure the self-
reported PTSD symptom severity over time. Cronbach’s a
was 0.90 for the whole questionnaire, which was good, and
was 0.87 for the dissociation part.
The PTSD Module of the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV (SCID-I) was used to establish current PTSD
6 months post-rape (20). The SCID-I is a widely used
structured clinical interview. A diagnosis of full PTSD
was made using the DSM-IV-TR (i.e. when clusters A
and F were fulfilled).
Statistical analyses
Because most data were not normally distributed, com-
parisons between groups (TI vs. without TI) were per-
formed using Mann–Whitney U test for continuous
variables (age, dissociation score, depression symptom
score, and PTSD symptoms score). Chi-square tests were
used for categorical/dichotomized variables (marital sta-
tus, relationship to assailant, earlier trauma, psychiatric
treatment history, pre-existing PTSD, and assault charac-
teristics).
Risk
factors
for
PTSD
at
6 months
were
assessed as categorical variables using logistic regression.
Variables were considered significant if the Wald test
resulted in a p-value < 0.05. All statistical analyses were
conducted using the statistical software version SPSS 22.0
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Ethical approval
The study was approved by the regional medical ethics
committee in Stockholm (2008/759-31).

Tonic immobility during rape

oller et al.
 Results
The results from the TIS showed that 69.8% of the
respondents reported significant immobility, and 47.7%
reported extreme immobility during the sexual assault.
Significant fear was experienced by 81.1% of the study
population. The average total score for the 298 participat-
ing women was 37.3 (range 0–60; SD 14.6), with a mean
TI subscale score of 23.4 (range 0–42; SD 10.8), and a
mean Fear subscale score of 11.9 (range 0–18; SD 4.5).
Descriptive statistics for all items are shown in Table 1.
The mean number of days between the sexual assault and
the completion of the TIS was 19.1 days (range 2–37; SD
6.7).
Victim and assault characteristics between the women
with extreme TI during the assault and those without
extreme TI are displayed in Table 2. Women with a pre-
vious history of sexual assault (in both childhood and
adulthood) were twice as likely to report TI during the
most recent assault. Additionally, a more severe assault
(such as use of physical violence and penetrating assaults)
was twice as likely to be reported in the TI group. Alco-
hol intake within the last 12 h before the assault was neg-
atively associated with TI and reduced the risk of
experiencing TI by half. No differences in TI were
observed relative to victim–assailant relationships.
Further, women that had experienced TI were more
than twice as likely to have pre-existing PTSD at the time
of the assault, were more than three times likely to
present with ASD, and were more likely to have severe
depression at the 2-week assessment (Table 3).
Finally, women who had experienced TI during the
assault had higher psychiatric morbidity at the 6-month
assessment
in
terms
of
both
PTSD
and
depression
(Table 4). Among the 189 women who completed the
6-month assessment, 38.1% had developed PTSD. Experi-
ences of extreme TI [odds ratio (OR) 2.75; 95% CI 1.50–
5.03, p = 0.001] and significant TI (OR 2.94; 95% CI
1.49–5.77, p = 0.002) during the assault were associated
with PTSD development. Even after adjusting for the
aforementioned known risk factors for PTSD and for
whether a woman had a pre-existing PTSD diagnosis at
the time of the assault or any other earlier psychiatric
treatment history, TI was associated with PTSD develop-
ment (adjusted OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.23–4.51, p = 0.031).
Women who had experienced TI were also three times
more likely to have severe depression after 6 months (OR
3.42; 95% CI 1.51–7.72, p = 0.003).
Discussion
The major finding of the present study was that the expe-
rience of TI during sexual assault is common. In this
sample of women, 7 out of 10 reported significant immo-
bility, nearly half reported extreme immobility, and 8 out
of 10 reported significant fear during the sexual assault.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess TI dur-
ing sexual assaults in a large sample of women who

Tonic immobility during rape
 sought medical care shortly after the assault. Earlier stud-
ies on TI during sexual assaults have been limited by
small sample sizes and by a substantial time span having
passed between the assault and the assessment. In these
earlier studies, the frequency of TI was reported to be
considerably lower than in our study, ranging from 37%
(6) to 52% (8). A higher proportion of recall bias in the
earlier retrospective studies, perhaps implying underre-
porting, may have caused this discrepancy.
The present study is also the first to prospectively
examine the association between TI and the development
of PTSD. Earlier studies have indicated an association
between TI and PTSD, but the cross-sectional designs
may have limited the possibility of generating causal rela-
tionships even more. In our study, we found that the
PTSD prevalence at 6 months was almost twice as high in
women who had experienced extreme TI compared with
women who had not experienced TI during the assault
(51% vs. 28%, p = 0.001). This association between TI
and PTSD development remained after adjusting for the
women who already had PTSD at the time of the assault
and other known risk factors for PTSD (15).
Tonic immobility was associated with earlier trauma
and pre-existing PTSD, which helps us better understand
how cumulative trauma might work.
Both TI and ASD predicted PTSD 6 months after a
rape. In future studies, peritraumatic phenomena in the
form of TI and ASD may become treatment targets them-
selves, for example to focus directly on possible ways of
reverting TI. It would also be interesting to replicate the
present study by using the DSM-V criteria for ASD and
PTSD because there may be differences in the predictive
power of TI relative to the DSM-5 and the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision.
This study also has some limitations that should be
mentioned. The low participation rate could, of course,
have caused a selection bias. A prospective design, how-
ever, involves approaching survivors in the acute aftermath
of the assault, and it is only natural that many will not be
willing to share details about the experience. The fact that
almost 37% of the consenting patients were lost to follow
up also represents a potential bias. However, the propor-
tion of women by victim–assailant relationship was the
same for the completers in this study as for the consecutive
patients who sought help during the 13 months evaluated
in another study from the same clinic (21), which suggests
that our sample is representative for the patients at our
clinic. In another earlier published study on the same
study population (15), an attrition analysis showed that
completers did not differ from non-completers in terms of
victim and assault characteristics, except non-completers
showed current alcohol abuse more frequently. Whether
this is caused by simple forgetfulness, shame or other

 factors remains unknown. Apart from non-completers
being more depressed at baseline, they did not tend to
score higher on the psychometrics at baseline compared
with the completers. The only PTSD symptom cluster
found significantly increased among the non-completers
was the avoidance symptoms, which could explain the
attrition. However, our results may still be biased by not
having any information on women who did not seek any
help. Further, the data collection was dependent on vic-
tims’ answers to self-rating questionnaires, and it is not
clear how reliable it is to collect data within the context of
a visit shortly after a sexual assault because of peritrau-
matic dissociation. Some women did not recall or were
unwilling to relate assault details.
The knowledge gained about the TI reaction has several
implications. Legally, the courts may be inclined to dis-
miss the notion of rape because the victim did not appear
to resist. Instead, what might be interpreted as passive
consent is very likely to represent normal and expected
biological reactions to an overwhelming threat. In addi-
tion, it becomes important in psychoeducation of rape
victims to inquire about and explain such reactions
because they might otherwise cause guilt or shame, which
can exacerbate the trauma. The increased risk of PTSD
and severe depression implies that psychiatric follow up
is needed for these women.
