IMPORTANCE Radiofrequency denervation is a commonly used treatment for chronic low
back pain, but high-quality evidence for its effectiveness is lacking.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation added
to a standardized exercise program for patients with chronic low back pain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three pragmatic multicenter, nonblinded randomized
clinical trials on the effectiveness of minimal interventional treatments for participants with
chronic low back pain (Mint study) were conducted in 16 multidisciplinary pain clinics in the
Netherlands. Eligible participants were included between January 1, 2013, and October 24,
2014, and had chronic low back pain, a positive diagnostic block at the facet joints
(facet joint trial, 251 participants), sacroiliac joints (sacroiliac joint trial, 228 participants),
or a combination of facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or intervertebral disks (combination trial,
202 participants) and were unresponsive to conservative care.
INTERVENTIONS All participants received a 3-month standardized exercise program and
psychological support if needed. Participants in the intervention group received
radiofrequency denervation as well. This is usually a 1-time procedure, but the maximum
number of treatments in the trial was 3.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was pain intensity (numeric rating
scale, 0-10; whereby 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated worst pain imaginable) measured
3 months after the intervention. The prespecified minimal clinically important difference was
defined as 2 points or more. Final follow-up was at 12 months, ending October 2015.
RESULTS Among 681 participants who were randomized (mean age, 52.2 years; 421 women
[61.8%], mean baseline pain intensity, 7.1), 599 (88%) completed the 3-month follow-up, and
521 (77%) completed the 12-month follow-up. The mean difference in pain intensity between
the radiofrequency denervation and control groups at 3 months was −0.18 (95% CI, −0.76
to 0.40) in the facet joint trial; −0.71 (95% CI, −1.35 to −0.06) in the sacroiliac joint trial;
and −0.99 (95% CI, −1.73 to −0.25) in the combination trial.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In 3 randomized clinical trials of participants with chronic low
back pain originating in the facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or a combination of facet joints,
sacroiliac joints, or intervertebral disks, radiofrequency denervation combined with a
standardized exercise program resulted in either no improvement or no clinically important
improvement in chronic low back pain compared with a standardized exercise program alone.
The findings do not support the use of radiofrequency denervation to treat chronic low back
pain from these sources.

 L
ow back pain causes more disability than any other
condition and has major social and economic con-
sequences.1-3 In the Netherlands (16.5 million resi-
dents) the cost of low back pain was estimated at €3.5 billion
(US $3.9 billion) in 2007, and the majority of the costs were
attributable to patients with chronic low back pain. In the
United States (326 million residents), the costs of low back
pain have not been recently estimated; however, a study by
Dieleman et al4 evaluated health care spending from 1996 to
2013 in the United States and estimated the health care spend-
ing on low back and neck pain at $87.6 billion.
Potential sources of low back pain of the spinal column
include the facet joints, sacroiliac joints, and intervertebral
disks. These sources of pain were classified as mechanical
low back pain.5,6 Radiofrequency denervation is a commonly
used treatment in pain clinics for chronic low back pain.
In the United States, facet joint or sacroiliac joint interven-
tions in Medicare recipients increased from approximately
425 000 interventions in 2000 to 2.2 million interventions in
2013.7 Radiofrequency denervation aims to prevent the con-
duction of nociceptive impulses through the use of an elec-
tric current that damages the pain-conducting nerve. The
effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation has not been
consistently demonstrated. However, there is consensus
among anesthesiologists that minimal interventional proce-
dures such as radiofrequency denervation are effective for
patients with mechanical low back pain.5 Systematic reviews
and multidisciplinary clinical guidelines concluded that
there is evidence of very low to moderate quality supporting
the effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation in clinical
practice for patients with chronic low back pain.5,8-10
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether radiofre-
quency denervation in addition to a standardized exercise
program is more effective than the standardized exercise pro-
gramaloneforpatientswithchronicmechanicallowbackpain.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The Cost-Effectiveness of Minimal Interventional Proce-
dures for Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain (Mint)
study11 was an initiative to evaluate minimally invasive
treatments for patients with spinal column–related chronic
low back pain, consisting of 4 trials and an observational
study (participants who did not want to be randomized or
who did not meet the inclusion criteria for the trials were
asked to participate in the observational study, where they
received usual care). The full protocol is available in
Supplement 1. One trial was designed to evaluate radiofre-
quency denervation for pain from the intervertebral disks.
This trial was prematurely terminated because of a lack of
eligible participants. The other 3 trials are presented in this
article: (1) the facet joint trial, (2) the sacroiliac joint trial,
and (3) the combination trial (facet joint, sacroiliac joint, or
the intervertebral disk). The Medical Ethics Committee of
the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam
granted ethical approval. Local research governance was
obtained from all participating pain clinics. All participants
gave written informed consent.
In 16 multidisciplinary pain clinics in the Netherlands,
pain specialists consecutively screened participants with
chronic low back pain. Inclusion criteria were pain consid-
ered to be related to the facet joint, sacroiliac joint, or a com-
bination of the facet joint, sacroiliac joint, or intervertebral
disk; aged 18 to 70 years; and no improvement in symptoms
after conservative treatment. Medical history and clinical
examination followed a standard format and were performed
by experienced clinicians to determine the likely source of
the pain. To be considered for a diagnostic sacroiliac joint
block, at least 3 of 6 provocation tests (compression test; dis-
traction test; Flexion, Abduction, and External Rotation
[FABER] test; Gaenslen test; thigh thrust test; Gillett test) had
to have positive results.12,13 Participants with suspected iso-
lated facet joint pain or isolated sacroiliac joint pain received
a diagnostic anesthetic block prior to randomization and
were only randomized if the diagnostic block was positive.
Participants with a suspected combination of sources of pain
were randomized based on participant history and physical
examination prior to receiving the diagnostic blocks.
This choice was made for ethical reasons. It would be unethi-
cal to give participants in the study multiple diagnostic
blocks (ie, a facet joint diagnostic block, a sacroiliac joint
diagnostic block, and a provocative discography) before
treatment. Furthermore, it is common practice in Dutch pain
clinics for participants with chronic low back pain due to
facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or intervertebral disks (based on
history taking and physical examination) to start with 1 diag-
nostic block. If the diagnostic block was positive, the inter-
vention was provided. If the diagnostic block was negative,
then another block was provided. If the second diagnostic
block was positive, the intervention was provided. If the sec-
ond diagnostic block was negative, the clinician provided a
third block. All participants were considered candidates for
intervention based on history taking and physical examina-
tion. For this reason, participants were randomized and
included in the combination trial after history taking and
physical examination, if the pain physician suspected that
the pain originated from more than 1 source.
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of radiofrequency
denervation added to a standardized exercise program for patients
with chronic low back pain?
Findings In 3 randomized clinical trials including 681 participants
with chronic low back pain originating from the facet joints,
sacroiliac joints, or a combination of these or the intervertebral
disks, radiofrequency denervation combined with exercise
compared with exercise alone resulted in either no significant
difference in pain intensity, or a difference smaller than the
prespecified minimal clinically important difference after 3 months.
Meaning The study findings do not support the use of
radiofrequency denervation for chronic low back pain originating
from these sources.

 Exclusion criteria for all trials were pregnancy, severe psy-
chological problems (determined with psychological ques-
tionnaires), involvement in work-related conflicts or claims;
body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared) higher than 35; or antico-
agulant drug therapy or coagulopathy.
Diagnostic Blocks
Forthefacetjoints,14a22-gaugeneedlewasinsertedtothepos-
terior primary root of the spinal nerve (medial branch) under
C-arm fluoroscopy. L3-4, L4-5, and L5-6 were selected for di-
agnostic blocks. The lateral image was checked to confirm the
correct position of the needle, after which 0.5 mL of 2% lido-
caine was injected.
For the sacroiliac joints,14 a 25-gauge needle was inserted
3 mm to 10 mm laterally of the sacral foramina S1-3 under
fluoroscopy. The correct depth of the needle was confirmed
laterally, after which 0.5 mL of 2% lidocaine was injected.
The dorsal ramus of L5 was also blocked as described in
the Spinal Intervention Society guidelines using 0.5 mL of
2% lidocaine.
The blocks were considered positive if the participant re-
ported 50% or more pain reduction within 30 to 90 minutes
after the block.

Randomization and Masking
Participants were randomized using a computerized random
number generator (Alea II, Netherlands Cancer Institute-
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital), accessed through a
password-protected website and maintained independently.
Randomization was performed at the individual level by
means of block randomization (block size = 4), prestratified
for pain clinic. Participants were allocated (1:1) to receive
either radiofrequency denervation with a standardized exer-
cise program (intervention group) or a standardized exercise
program alone (control group).
Participants and caregivers were not blinded. The Dutch
Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport requested a pragmatic
trial in which existing, commonly applied treatment options
would be compared. Data handling, analysis, and interpreta-
tion of results were conducted blind to treatment allocation.
All participants were sequentially assigned unique numbers.
Participants’expectations and satisfaction16,17 were mea-
sured to evaluate a possible risk of bias due to a nonblinded
study design.
Interventions
Standardized Exercise Program
All participants received a program based on the Dutch physi-
cal therapy guidelines18 in 1 of 102 participating physical
therapy practices. The 8- to 12-hour programs focused on qual-
ityofmovementandbehavior,andtookplaceduringa3-month
interventionperiod.Moredetailsareavailableinthestudypro-
tocol, which is available in Supplement 1. If necessary, partici-
pants were referred to psychological care.
Radiofrequency Denervation
Within 1 week after the first exercise session the intervention
group received radiofrequency denervation. The technical de-
tails of the radiofrequency denervation procedures are in-
cluded in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.19-22
Co-Interventions
In both treatment groups, participants were asked to refrain
from co-interventions during the intervention period of 3
months (duration of the standardized exercise program).
Co-interventions that were not allowed included (but were
not limited to) surgery; manual therapy; chiropractic therapy;
a change in current, back pain–related medication; or newly
prescribed medication. Analgesics were not prescribed, but
over-the-counter medication was allowed. Co-interventions
or recurrence of the radiofrequency denervation was allowed
after the intervention period of 3 months. These interven-
tions were recorded. Psychological care was not considered a
co-intervention and was provided when needed to partici-
pants in either treatment group.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was pain intensity, measured on an
11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; a score of 0 indicates no
pain; 10 indicates worst pain imaginable) 3 months after the
intervention.23
Secondary outcomes were global perceived recovery,16
participant satisfaction17 (both measured by the 7-point,
categorical Global Perceived Effect scale; a score of 1 indi-
cates fully recovered; 4 indicates no change; 7 indicates
worse than ever), functional status (measured by Oswestry
Disability Index [ODI]; a score of 0 indicates no restrictions in
daily activities; 100 indicates most restrictions in daily
activities),24 health-related quality of life (measured by the
3-level EuroQol 5D Health Questionnaire [EQ-5D-3L]; a score
of 0 indicates worst imaginable health state; 1 indicates best
imaginable health state),25 general health (measured by
RAND 36-Item Health Survey [Rand-36], a score of 0 indi-
cates lowest general health score; 100 indicates highest gen-
eral health score),26 and chronic pain experiences (measured
by the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory; a
score of 0 indicates lowest score; 6 indicates highest score).27
Theminimalclinicallyimportantdifferenceinpainforpar-
ticipants with chronic low back pain was estimated at 2 points
or more of the 10-point NRS, a difference of 20 points on the
100-point ODI, and between 0.09 and 0.28 points on the
EQ-5D-3L utility score between 0 and 1.28,29 No minimal clini-
cally important differences are known for the other second-
ary outcomes.
All outcome measures were registered using web-based
questionnaires, which were sent at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and
12-month follow-up. Pain intensity, global perceived recov-
ery, and health-related quality of life were also assessed at
3-week follow-up and 6-week follow-up.
Sample Size Calculation
A clinically relevant mean difference of 2 points or more on
the NRS28 for pain intensity (SD, 4) was used for the sample

 size calculation. With a power of 0.9, a 2-sided α of .05, and
a correlation of 0.5 for repeated measurements, 85 partici-
pants per group were needed. Anticipating potential study
withdrawal (20%), a minimum of 204 participants per trial
was needed.
Statistical Analyses
Effects were estimated using a maximum likelihood estima-
tion for longitudinal mixed-effects model, under “missing
at random” assumptions, including a term for pain clinic, if
necessary, based on the likelihood ratio test.30 We used a
generalized linear mixed model (logit link) for the post hoc
analysis of treatment response for dichotomized outcomes.
The same multilevel structure was used for both models. All
analyses were conducted in accordance with the intention-
to-treat principle.
Regression coefficients or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs
were calculated; ORs were converted to relative risks (RRs)
using the method of Zhang et al31: RR = OR/[(1 − prevalence
in control group) + (prevalence in control group × OR)].
We adjusted for the outcome parameter at baseline, and age,
sex (self-reported), BMI, education, smoking, marital status,
back pain complaint history, and participant expectations.
The effect of interest was the time × treatment interaction.
Regression coefficients can be interpreted as mean differ-
ences between interventions compared with baseline. Addi-
tionally, we calculated the number needed to treat and the
unadjusted risk differences as absolute differences between
groups. Data were compared between complete and incom-
plete cases to identify possible selective dropout.
Treatment success for the global perceived recovery was
defined as “much recovery” or “complete recovery.” In post
hoc analyses, treatment success in pain reduction was de-
fined as either more than 30% or 2 points reduction or more
on the NRS pain scale.
No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
Findings for the secondary outcomes should be interpreted
as exploratory.
In 2 sensitivity analyses, participants marked as partici-
pants who had protocol violations, and participants who re-
ceived radiofrequency denervation during follow-up were ex-
cluded from the analyses. Additionally, data were compared
between complete and incomplete cases. We used MLwiN
software (University of Bristol), version 2.22, for the effects
models (2-sided significance P < .05).
Results
In total, 251 patients were included in the facet joint trial, 228
patients in the sacroiliac joint trial, and 202 in the combina-
tion trial (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3). The 681 random-
ized participants had a mean age of 52.2 years, 421 partici-
pants were women (61.8%), and the mean baseline pain
intensity was 7.1 on the NRS scale. Another 5168 patients were
included in the observational part of Mint study.

 Facet Joint Trial
Study Participants
Between January 1, 2013, and June 3, 2014 (the inclusion pe-
riod for the facet joint trial), 931 participants received a diag-
nostic facet joint block. Patients with a negative result for the
diagnostic facet joint block (n = 258) were excluded. Patients
with psychological problems (n = 277), older than 70 years
(n = 93), or with a BMI higher than 35 (n = 52) were followed
up in the observational study. The inclusion criteria were met
by 251 participants for the facet joint trial and were random-
ized to the intervention group (n = 125) and control group
(n = 126) (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups
(Table 1). However, participants in the intervention group had
a first low back pain episode 12 years prior compared with 8
years prior in the control group.
Complete data on pain intensity, functional status, and
global perceived recovery after 3 months was obtained from
233 participants (93%). Complete outcome data on all fol-
low-up points during the year were obtained from 179 partici-
pants (71%). Participants with complete data were older, more
often nonsmokers, were more likely to have a partner, had a
higher BMI, and had low back pain complaints for a longer pe-
riod (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).

 Twelve participants in the control group received radio-
frequency denervation within the first 3 months and were
marked as participants who had protocol violations. Ten par-
ticipants(8%)intheinterventiongroupand11participants(9%)
in the control group received psychological care during the
3-month intervention period.
No treatment-related adverse events were reported dur-
ing the 1-year follow-up.
Intention-to-Treat Analyses
The mean difference for the primary outcome pain intensity
at 3 months was −0.18 (95% CI, −0.76 to 0.40). Results on all
other follow-up points are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The
mean difference for functional status at 3 months was −2.45
(95% CI, −5.53 to 1.03); the RR for global perceived recovery
at 3 months was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.81 to 2.05). Other follow-up
points and secondary outcomes are shown in eTable 2 in
Supplement 2.
Post Hoc Analyses of Treatment Response
No significant differences between the groups were found
when success was defined as more than 30% or 2 points re-
duction or more in pain at 3 months (Table 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
When participants with protocol violations were excluded
from the analysis, the interpretation of the outcomes
remained similar (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). After 3 months
of follow–up, 31 control group participants received radiofre-
quency denervation. The analyses were repeated excluding
participants receiving the intervention after the 3-month
intervention period; this did not alter the results either
(eTable 4 in Supplement 2). The complete case analysis
showed no significant between-group differences for pain
intensity, functional status, and global perceived recovery at
3 months (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Sacroiliac Joint Trial
Study Participants
Between January 1, 2013, and July 1, 2014 (the inclusion
period for the sacroiliac joint trial), 832 participants received
a diagnostic sacroiliac joint block. Patients with a negative re-
sult for the diagnostic sacroiliac joint block (n = 202) were
excluded. Patients with psychological problems (n = 257),
older than 70 years (n = 83), or a BMI higher than 35 (n = 47),
or other reasons for not participating in the trial (n = 15) were
followed up in the observational study. The inclusion criteria
were met by 228 participants for the sacroiliac joint trial and
were randomized to the intervention group (n = 116) and the
control group (n = 112) (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups
(Table 1). However, the first episode of low back pain in the in-
tervention group was 97 months before inclusion compared
with 65 months in the control group.

 Complete data on pain intensity, functional status, and
global perceived recovery after 3 months were obtained from
198 participants (87%). Complete outcome data on all fol-
low-up points during the year were obtained from 134 partici-
pants (59%). The participants with complete data were older,
more often nonsmokers, were more likely to have a partner,
and had low back pain complaints for a longer period (eTable
1 in Supplement 2).
Seven participants in the control group received radiofre-
quencydenervationwithinthefirst3monthsandweremarked
as participants who had protocol violations. Seven partici-
pants (6%) in the intervention group and 6 participants (5%)
in the control group received psychological care during the
3-month intervention period.
There was 1 registered treatment-related complication (va-
sovagal reaction to treatment).
Intention-to-Treat Analyses
The mean difference for the primary outcome pain intensity
at 3 months was −0.71 (95% CI, −1.35 to −0.06). Results on all
other follow-up points are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The
mean difference for functional status at 3 months was −4.20
(95% CI, −8.39 to −0.002); the RR for global perceived recov-
ery at 3 months was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.13 to 2.71). Other fol-
low-up points and secondary outcomes are shown in eTable
2 in Supplement 2.
Post Hoc Analyses of Treatment Response
No significant differences between the groups were found
when success was defined as more than 30% or 2 points re-
duction or more in pain at 3 months (Table 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
When participants who had protocol violations were
excluded from the analysis, the interpretation of the out-
comes remained similar (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). After
3 months of follow–up, 41 control group participants re-
ceived radiofrequency denervation. Excluding these from the
analysis did not change the long-term results (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2). The complete case analysis showed no sig-
nificant between-group differences for the primary outcomes
at 3 months than participants without complete data (eTable
5 in Supplement 2).
Combination Trial
Study Participants
Between January 1, 2013, and October 24, 2014 (the inclusion
period for participants in this trial), 793 participants were eli-
gible for this trial. The inclusion criteria were met by 202 par-
ticipants, and those participants were randomly assigned to
the intervention (n = 103) and control group (n = 99). All rea-
sons for exclusions are presented in the flow charts (Figure 1
and Figure 3).
Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups
(Table 1).
Complete data on pain intensity, functional status, and
global perceived recovery after 3 months were obtained
from 168 participants (83%). Complete data on all follow-up
assessments were obtained from 89 participants (44%) on
the effect measures. Participants with complete data had
low back pain complaints for a longer period, but were simi-
lar for all other demographic characteristics (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2).
Two participants in the control group received radiofre-
quency denervation, and 2 participants did not receive any
treatment. In the intervention group, 11 participants did not
receive or it was unknown if they received the standardized
exercise program. These 14 participants were considered par-
ticipants who had protocol violations. Eight participants (8%)
in the intervention group and 10 participants (10%) in the con-
trol group received psychological care during the 3-month in-
tervention period.
In the intervention group, 35 participants had negative
results for diagnostic blocks and did not receive radiofre-
quency denervation. These participants were still included
in the intention-to-treat analyses. The diagnostic block had
a positive result for 68 participants, of whom 25 received
facet joint radiofrequency denervation, 21 sacroiliac joint
radiofrequency denervation, 21 received a combination
of radiofrequency denervation treatments (facet and sacro-
iliac joint radiofrequency denervation), and 1 participant did
not receive radiofrequency denervation despite a positive
result for the diagnostic block.
Onecomplicationwasrecordedduringthe1-yearfollow-up
in the intervention group: a hematoma, causing extra pain.
The participant completely recovered.
Intention-to-Treat Analyses
The mean difference for the primary outcome pain intensity
at 3 months was −0.99 (95% CI, −1.73 to −0.25). Results on all
other follow-up points are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The
mean difference for functional status at 3 months was −4.66
(95% CI, −10.21 to 0.89); the RR for global perceived recovery
at 3 months was 1.99 (95% CI, 0.99 to 3.36). Other follow-up
points and secondary outcomes are shown in eTable 2 in
Supplement 2.
Post Hoc Analyses of Treatment Response
When success was defined as 30% pain reduction (RR, 1.92
[95% CI, 1.19 to 2.65]), there was a statistically significant dif-
ference at 3 months favoring the intervention group (Table 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
Excluding participants who had protocol violations from the
analysis slightly increased the contrast between the groups,
as significantly more people in the intervention group recov-
ered based on global perceived recovery after 3 months
(RR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.02 to 3.43]) (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
After 3 months follow-up, 31 control group participants
received radiofrequency denervation. The analyses were
repeated without participants receiving the intervention
after the 3-month intervention period; this resulted in only
minor differences (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). The complete-
cases analysis showed no significant between-group differ-
ences for the primary outcomes at 3 months (eTable 5 in
Supplement 2).

 Discussion
In 3 trials, the effects of radiofrequency denervation for par-
ticipants with chronic low back pain due to facet joints, sac-
roiliac joints, or a combination of the facet joints, sacroiliac
joints, or intervertebral disks in addition to a standardized ex-
ercise program were compared with a standardized exercise
program alone. The 2 trials assessing radiofrequency dener-
vation for the sacroiliac joints and a combination of the facet
joints, sacroiliac joints, or intervertebral disks showed a sta-
tistically significant but not clinically important improve-
mentinpainintensity3monthsaftertheintervention.Noclini-
cally important or statistically significant differences between
the groups were shown in the trial assessing radiofrequency
denervation for facet joint pain. Only small or no effects were
found for all secondary outcomes.
Basedonthisstudy,radiofrequencydenervationisnotrec-
ommended and should be performed only in a research set-
ting. Patients with chronic low back pain who show no im-
provement in symptoms after conservative treatment have no
clear alternative therapies that have been shown to be effec-
tive. Future research regarding the diagnosis and treatment for
low back pain in participants with chronic low back pain is nec-
essary and should focus on better participant selection (be-
cause there remains a possibility that radiofrequency dener-
vation could be beneficial on a subset of participants) and
improvement of the treatment techniques.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of these trials are the large sample sizes and strati-
fied randomization that allowed for well-balanced study
groups, and the use of outcome measures as recommended by
the core outcome set for low back pain research.32 In addition
totheprimarytimepointat3months,afollow-upof12months
was included.
This study has several limitations. First, different radiofre-
quencydenervationtechniques(cooledradiofrequencydener-
vation, Palisade, and Simplicity III) were used in the sacroiliac
joint trial.33-36 However, the groups were too small for a sub-
groupanalysis.Second,becausetheaimofthestudywastopro-
vide evidence of the added value of radiofrequency denerva-
tion in a multidisciplinary setting, as done in daily practice,
participants and clinicians were not blinded. Evidence sug-
gests that treatment effects for subjective outcomes may
be overestimated when outcome assessors (ie, participants, if
outcomes are self-reported) are not blinded.37 However, the
magnitude of this bias is unknown. The lack of blinding was a
significant limitation of the trials, and it is possible that radio-
frequency denervation could even be harmful, but the lack of
blinding may have made the treatment effect seem null. Also,
theshort-termdifferencesinglobalperceivedrecoveryforfacet
joint and sacroiliac joint radiofrequency denervation in ab-
sence of a difference in functional status might be the result of
a nonspecific effect due to the nonblinded study design.
Third,areferencestandardfordiagnosingfacetjointorsac-
roiliac joint pain is not available.14 In this pragmatic study, di-
agnostic tests that are commonly applied in clinical practice
were used. Controversy concerning the ideal threshold value
of pain reduction in the diagnostic blocks exists. A 50% cut-
off was most frequently used in previous studies38 and in clini-
cal practice. Performing 2 or more independent diagnostic
blocks will decrease the false-positive rate, but increase the
number of false-negative blocks.38 Furthermore, a clinical trial
showed that multiple blocks are not cost-effective.38
Fourth, the generalizability of the results might be reduced
bythelargenumberofpeopleexcludedforpsychologicalprob-
lems.IntheNetherlands,participantsvisitingapainclinicoften
have long-lasting persistent low back pain. A large number of
these participants have psychological problems. These partici-
pants were excluded from this study because in daily practice
theyarenotconsideredcandidatesforradiofrequencydenerva-
tion and will be referred to psychological treatment.
Fifth, in all 3 trials, some control group participants re-
ceived radiofrequency denervation after the 3-month inter-
vention period (25% in the facet joint trial, 35% in sacroiliac
joint trial, and 31% in the combination trial) and some inter-
vention group participants received a second radiofrequency
denervation (8% in the facet joint trial, 17% in the sacroiliac
joint trial, and 15% in the combination trial). This could have
influencedthelong-termoutcomes.However,sensitivityanaly-
ses without these participants showed similar results.
Sixth, in the sacroiliac joint trial, there was a higher drop-
out in the control group. This could potentially have biased the
long-term results.
Seventh, in the combination trial, not all participants in
the intervention group received radiofrequency denerva-
tion, because they did not respond to the diagnostic block or
provocative discography.
Eighth, more missing data were found in the combina-
tion trial compared with the other 2 trials. This is a potential
limitation, but because of the relatively large number of
dropouts at 12 months, the complete case analysis might also
be biased. Although we did not define differences between
the complete-case analysis and the intention-to-treat analy-
sis using all data, it is possible that completers are different
from noncompleters, which could have biased the results of
the complete-case analyses.
Ninth, we assessed multiple outcomes and made no ad-
justment for multiple comparisons, which could have re-
sulted in some statistically significant findings by chance.
Comparison With the Literature
Recent systematic reviews have evaluated the association of
radiofrequency denervation with isolated pain sources and
showed evidence of low to moderate quality for associations
of facet joint radiofrequency with small positive effects on
pain and functional status compared with placebo or steroid
injections.9-11 There is very low to moderate quality evidence
and conflicting evidence for sacroiliac joint radiofrequency de-
nervation and radiofrequency denervation in the interverte-
bral disk.5,9-11 In the trials included in these reviews, partici-
pants had a baseline pain score of 1 point lower compared with
this trial, and the radiofrequency denervation groups de-
creased more (to 3.3 of 10) than the placebo groups (to 5.0 of
10). In the Mint study, participants in both groups decreased

 in pain, but both groups continued to have a higher pain level
compared with other similar trials.
Conclusions
In 3 randomized clinical trials of participants with chronic
low back pain originating in the facet joints, sacroiliac
joints, or a combination of facet joints, sacroiliac joints, or
intervertebral disks, radiofrequency denervation combined
with a standardized exercise program resulted in either no
improvement or no clinically important improvement in
chronic low back pain compared with a standardized exer-
cise program alone. The findings do not support the use of
radiofrequency denervation to treat chronic low back pain
from these sources.
