Abstract
Introduction—Cooking at home is associated with better diet quality. This study examined the 
frequency of home-cooked dinners versus eating out in relation to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), 
and food expenditures.
Methods—The Seattle Obesity Study used a stratified random sample of 437 King County 
adults. In-person computer-assisted interviews collected sociodemographic and behavioral data 
during 2011–2013. HEI-2010 and 2005 were computed using Food Frequency Questionnaires. 
Multivariable regression analyses, conducted in 2015, examined associations among HEI scores, 
food expenditures, and frequency of cooking at home versus eating out variables.
Results—Frequent home-cooked dinners were associated with being married, unemployed, 
larger households, presence of children aged <12 years, and lower frequency of eating out, but 
unrelated to education or income. In adjusted models, frequent at-home cooking was associated 
with higher HEI-2010 (β=7.4, p<0.001), whereas frequent eating out was associated with lower 
HEI-2010 (β= −6.6, p<0.001). Frequent home cooking was linked with reduced per capita food 
expenditures overall ($330/month among low vs $273/month among high cooking group, 
p<0.001), and reduced away-from-home expenditures ($133 and $65, respectively), without any 
significant increase in at-home food expenditures. However, frequent eating out was associated 
with significantly higher per capita food expenditures overall ($261 in low vs $364 among high 
eating out group, p=0.001), and higher away-from-home expenditures.
Conclusions—Home-cooked dinners were associated with greater dietary guideline compliance, 
without significant increase in food expenditures. By contrast, frequent eating out was associated 
with higher expenditures and lower compliance. Home cooking may be a component of nutrition 
resilience.

 INTRODUCTION
Where food is consumed may affect diet quality, as measured by compliance with the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans.1–8 In multiple studies, meals prepared and eaten at home 
were associated with higher-quality diets and better health outcomes.1,3,4,9–15 For example, 
the frequency of family dinners among adolescents had been positively associated with diet 
quality scores based on a modified 1995 Healthy Eating Index (HEI),16 a measure of 
compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Recent analyses of the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys5,17,18 (NHANES 2007–2010) showed that 
frequent home-cooked dinners were associated with lower energy intakes and with lower 
consumption of sugar and fat.7 However, not all the studies on family meals had uniformly 
positive outcomes.19,20
By contrast, consumption of away-from-home foods from fast food and full service 
restaurants was associated with more total dietary energy, more fat and saturated fat, and 
more sodium.21 Meals eaten away from home have also been linked to obesity and weight 
gain.1,2,22–26 The contribution of away-from-home foods to total calories rose from 18% in 
1977–1978 to 32% in 1994–1996.2 Currently, energy obtained from sources away from 
home is estimated between 16.9% and 26.3% of the total, depending on age.27 Those 
calories include both quick and full service restaurants, and food from workplace cafeterias, 
other people, and vending machines. At the same time, less than 20% of U.S. adults meet the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines, failing to consume adequate amounts of 
vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.28
The recent literature has identified economics as one of the underlying barriers to comply 
with dietary guidelines, given that higher-quality diets were found to be linked with higher 
diet costs.29,30 However, studies have not yet linked frequency of home cooking versus 
eating away from home with food expenditures. The present hypothesis was that frequent 
home-cooked dinners would be associated with higher diet quality, but not with higher self-
reported food expenditures.31 By contrast, frequent meals eaten away from home would be 
associated with lower diet quality and higher self-reported food expenditures. In the Seattle 
Obesity Study, these variables were captured using questions on the frequency of home-
cooked dinners, frequency of meals away from home, and self-reported food expenditures, 
based on the 2009–2020 NHANES Flexible Consumer Module.32–36 Diet quality was 
captured using HEI scores, a measure of compliance with Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to link the frequency of cooking at home 
versus eating out with the most recent federal measure of diet quality available (HEI-2010), 
as well as with self-reported food expenditures.
METHODS
The Seattle Obesity Study was a primary data collection study on food environment, diets 
and health. A stratified address-based sampling scheme ensured adequate representation by 
geographic location and SES. The detailed methodology is provided elsewhere.37 The study 
collected rich primary data on food shopping and eating behaviors, travel patterns, diets, and

 health. Self-reported data on food-related attitudes, food shopping expenditures, socio-
demographics, and physical activity were also collected.
Study Population
The initial sampling frame was based on 25,460 home addresses that were later matched to 
phone numbers. Recruitment was based on pre-notification postcards followed with up to 
three telephone calls. Eligible participants were English-speaking, aged 21–55 years, 
primary food shoppers of the household, and without any mobility issues. A total of 712 
eligible respondents provided verbal consent and were invited to an in-person meeting, 
either at the study research site at the University of Washington or at their location of choice 
that was closer to their home. Of these, 516 (72.5%) agreed to enroll in the study. Data on 
sociodemographics, food-related behaviors, and self-reported food expenditures were 
collected using a computer-assisted health behavior survey. Participants were provided with 
a monetary incentive of $100 as a token of appreciation for successfully completing the 
baseline study protocols. These procedures were approved by the University of Washington 
IRB. The study sample was recruited from November 2011 to October 2013. The data were 
analyzed in 2015. The baseline data collection was completed by 516 respondents. However, 
after taking missing data for key variables into account (77 respondents with missing HEI 
variable data, and two with missing data on home-cooking question), the analytic sample 
consisted of 437 participants.
Measures
Demographic variables of interest were age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, household 
size, and employment status. SES indicators were education and household income. For 
analytic purpose, education was defined as: some college or less (<16 years), college 
graduate (16 years), and postgraduate (>16 years). Annual household incomes were 
collapsed into: ≤$50,000, $50,000–<$100,000, and ≥$100,000.
All the participants were asked: During the past 7 days, how many times did you or someone 
else in your family cook food for dinner or supper at home? The second question was: How 
many meals prepared outside home do you eat each week? By meals, we mean breakfast, 
lunch or dinner. The meals can be prepared at places such as restaurants, fast food places, 
food stands, grocery stores or from vending machines. The questions were based on the 
2009–2010 NHANES Consumer Module. Based on the distribution of responses, the data 
were grouped into three frequency categories: low (zero to three times/week), medium (four 
to five times/week), and high (six or more times/week) for cooking at home, and separately 
for eating out variables.
A list of standard validated questions from the 2009–2010 NHANES module were used to 
collect self-reported data on monthly household food expenditures on all foods and 
beverages at all grocery stores combined, and on eating out. For example: During the past 30 
days, how much money (did your family/did you) spend at supermarkets or grocery stores? 
These are widely used questions from NHANES, and were validated with objective 
household expenditure data from food shopping receipts.38 Data from these questions were 
combined to compute the total monthly food expenditure.

 The General Nutrition Assessment version of the Fred Hutchinson Food Frequency 
Questionnaire, administered during an in-person visit, was the primary dietary assessment 
tool. It is a standard validated tool to collect data on usual diets consumed by a 
respondent39,40 that has been previously used in many large-scale studies.41 Participants 
report the frequency of consumption and portion size of 125 line items over the past 1 year. 
Energy, nutrient intakes, and HEI scores were calculated using the University of Minnesota 
Nutrition Data Systems for Research software, version 2012.
The HEI-2010 was the primary diet quality measure of interest. It is the most recent diet 
quality measure available to assess compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.42 
HEI-2010 score tracks the 2010 Guidelines, and was based on component scores for total 
fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, 
seafood and plant proteins, fatty acids, refined grains, sodium, and empty calories.43 
HEI-2005 was used as another measure of diet quality used for sensitivity analyses. It 
measures compliance with 2005 dietary guidelines.44 HEI-2005 components were total fruit, 
whole fruit, total vegetables, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, total grains, 
whole grains, milk, meat and beans, oils, saturated fats, sodium, and calories from solid fats, 
alcohol, and added sugars.44 Both scores had 12 components including nine adequacy and 
three moderation components, and both employed a 100-point scale. HEI scores range from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better diet quality. HEI scores >80 indicate a “good” 
diet, scores ranging from 51 to 80 reflect a diet that “needs improvement,” and HEI scores 
<51 imply a “poor” diet. For the present study, HEI-2010 served as the primary diet quality 
indicator. The analyses were replicated with HEI-2005 variables to ensure robustness of the 
study findings.
Statistical Analysis
First, descriptive statistics characterized the sociodemographic profile of respondents by 
frequency of cooking at home versus eating out. A series of chi-square tests provided p-
values for statistical significance. Second, a series of bivariate linear regressions examined 
the associations of cooking at home versus eating out frequency, each with HEI scores. 
ANOVAs and t-tests were conducted to indicate statistical significance. Third, a series of 
multivariable linear regressions examined the frequency of cooking at home with HEI-2010, 
after adjusting for key covariates. Frequency of cooking dinner at home served as the 
primary independent variable, and HEI-2010 was the primary dependent variable. Model 1 
adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, household size, and employment 
status. To ensure that these associations persisted after taking SES into account, income and 
education were added as covariates in Model 2. These analyses were repeated with 
frequency of eating out as the primary independent variable, adjusting for covariates. Fourth, 
additional multivariable linear regressions with robust SEs examined the frequency of each
—home cooking versus eating out—with per capita food expenditures. Adjusted marginal 
means of total food expenditures, and expenditures at home versus away from home were 
computed. Fifth, additional descriptive analyses were conducted to test these associations by 
each of the 12 HEI-2010 components separately. A series of ANOVAs provided the overall 
p-value for statistical significance. All the statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, 
version 13.0.

 RESULTS
Participant distribution is summarized in Table 1. The sample was predominantly female 
(70%), aged <50 years (60%), white (85.6%), and married (56.8%). About 69% completed 
at least a college degree (≥16 years), 71% had household incomes ≥$50,000, and 75% were 
employed. Most were from households of two or more people (72%), and 29.5% had 
children aged <12 years living with them.
About half the sample (50.6%) frequently cooked dinner at home (six or more times/week), 
with one third (34.3%) cooking four to five times/week, and only 15.1% cooking rarely 
(zero to three times/week). There were no significant differences in frequency of cooking at 
home by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, or education (p>0.05 for each) (Table 1). By 
contrast, significant differences in cooking frequency were observed by marital status, 
household size, number of children in the household, employment status, and frequency of 
eating out (overall p<0.05 for each). The proportion of married respondents rose 
significantly from 40% among the low cooking frequency group to 54.7% among the 
medium to 63.4% among the highest cooking frequency group. Similar trends were observed 
with greater household size, the presence of children in the household, and being 
unemployed (p<0.05 for each). For example, the proportion of unemployed respondents rose 
from 12.1% to 27.2% from low to high cooking-frequency group. The proportions for the 
employed, on the other hand, dropped significantly from 87.9% to 72.9% respectively.
Appendix Table 1 contrasts these sociodemographic trends by frequency of eating out. 
Unmarried respondents, one-person households and those without children, and the 
employed were significantly more likely to eat out (overall p<0.05 for each).
The bivariate associations between eating behaviors and HEI scores are presented in 
Appendix Table 2. Though higher frequency of cooking at home was linked with higher 
HEI-2010 scores (with the substantial difference of 7 points between low and high cooking 
groups, and 3.3 points between medium and high cooking groups), higher frequency of 
eating out was associated with significantly lower HEI scores (with a 6-point decline in HEI 
scores from low to high eating out groups, and an almost 2-point decline from medium to 
high eating out groups). Similar, but slightly weaker, associations were observed with 
HEI-2005.
The multivariable associations are presented in Table 2. A dose–response association was 
observed such that HEI-2010 rose together with the frequency of cooking dinner. HEI-2010 
rose by 4.63 points from the lowest to medium frequency category (95% CI=1.68, 7.58) and 
rose by 7.68 units going from the lowest to the highest frequency category (95% CI=4.93, 
10.42), adjusting for demographic variables (Model 1). These associations remained robust 
even after adding income and education to the model (β=4.55, 95% CI=1.58, 7.51 for 
medium cooking frequency; β=7.44, 95% CI=4.70, 10.17 for highest cooking frequency; 
Model 2).
Separate multivariable regression analyses were conducted with frequency of eating out and 
the HEI-2010 variable. HEI-2010 score declined by 4.96 points from low to medium 
frequency (95% CI= −7.46, −2.45), and dropped by 5.74 points going from the lowest to

 highest frequency (95% CI= −8.34, −3.14) of eating out. Consistent results were obtained 
with the HEI-2005 variable for both home cooking and eating out (Table 2).
Figure 1 shows change in each of the 12 HEI-2010 components by frequency of cooking 
dinner at home (A) and eating out (B). Most of the HEI components showed significant 
improvements, except for refined grains, total protein, and dairy. Importantly, frequent home 
cooking was linked to fewer empty calories and lower sodium intakes. By contrast, frequent 
eating out was associated with lower HEI component subscores. Total protein was the only 
exception.
Table 3 examined the frequency of home cooking versus eating out in relation to self-
reported food expenditures obtained using standard NHANES questions. Frequent cooking 
at home was marginally associated with per capita food expenditures at home ($195 per 
person per month among the lowest cooking group to $180 among the medium and $208 
among the highest cooking group). However, there was a sharp decline in food expenditures 
away from home ($133, $108, and $65, respectively, p<0.001), as well as overall food 
expenditures ($330, $291, and $273, respectively, p<0.05). By contrast, frequent eating out 
was not associated with a significant decrease in home spending, but added greatly to food 
expenditures away from home ($64, $101, and $171 for the low, medium, and high eating 
out groups, respectively, p<0.001), as well as to overall monthly expenditures ($261, $305, 
and $364 per person per month, respectively, p=0.001).
DISCUSSION
Consistent with past reports, based on NHANES 2007–2010 data,45 the frequency of 
cooking dinner at home was strongly and independently associated with higher HEI-2010 
and HEI-2005 scores. The strongest results were obtained for the empty calorie HEI 
subscores, supporting the notion that home-cooked dinners were associated with diets lower 
in calories, sugar, and fat.7 The data were robust after adjusting for household demographics, 
education, income, and employment. This is significant, as higher HEI scores are generally 
associated with higher SES, education, and income. By contrast, cooking dinner at home 
depends more on family size and the number of children.
Importantly, frequent home-cooked dinners were not associated with higher self-reported 
food expenditures in this study. The small increase in at-home spending was more than 
offset by significantly lower spending on foods away from home. Cooking dinners at home 
may be an effective strategy to reduce the consumption of empty calories, and improve diet 
quality within the budget.21,46 Many past studies have noted that some of the barriers to the 
adoption of healthier diets may be economic, given that higher dietary HEI scores are 
associated with higher monetary diet costs.24,47 The present observation that more-frequent 
home-cooked dinners were strongly associated with higher HEI scores at no extra self-
reported cost has multiple implications for public health policies. First, interventions to 
improve diet quality should target home-cooked meals. Second, such interventions should be 
accompanied with nutrition education on how to increase home-cooked meals while 
maintaining or reducing the food budget. It is worth noting that Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program Education has increasingly featured recipes, cooking lessons, and other

 resources to promote home-cooked meals.48 Low income recipients of food assistance48 
may need to address other potential barriers to cooking dinners at home, including lack of 
time, lack of cooking skills, or the sheer convenience of eating out.49
An extensive literature that goes beyond home-cooked dinners suggests that family meals in 
general are further associated with positive behavioral and psychological outcomes, 
especially among children.3,11–18 However, a systematic review of the association between 
family meals and adolescent health outcomes noted that many effects were attenuated by 
family cohesion.19 The present study, focused on diet quality and cost, suggests that frequent 
home-cooked dinners may allow families to eat better for less.31
In the present data, frequent meals eaten away from home were strongly associated with 
lower HEI scores. This is consistent with a past study where meals away from home were 
associated with more calories, sodium, and fat.21 One important new finding in this study 
was that more-frequent meals away from home were associated both with lower-quality diets 
and higher self-reported food expenditures. The present results are broadly consistent with 
published analyses of NHANES data.5,7 The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
noted that the convenience of eating prepared foods away from home could add to the 
family’s food budget.50
The time spent on preparing food at home also decreased significantly from 1965 to 2007, 
especially among lower-income groups.51 In a Seattle-based study, the time spent on 
preparing meals was associated with more frequent consumption of vegetables and fruit.4 
However, time may not be the only relevant factor. Given the benefits of eating at home,6 
continued teaching of nutrition and cooking skills assumes a new public health importance.
Limitations
The present approach, based on standard food expenditure questions from NHANES, 
extends and complements past studies24,52–54 where individual-level diet costs were 
estimated by joining retail food prices to dietary intake data.55 However, there were 
limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the present database limited the ability to 
draw causal inferences. Second, both the frequency of cooking at home and HEI scores were 
based on self-reported data that are subject to bias. Third, the present data did not permit any 
conclusions about the impact of cooking at home versus eating out on long-term diet quality 
and health. However, the present data are consistent with observations from national level 
studies.7
CONCLUSIONS
More-frequent home-cooked dinners were associated with higher-quality diets at no extra 
cost. By contrast, frequent meals away from home were associated with lower-quality diets 
and higher self-reported food expenditures.4,56 Lack of time, nutrition knowledge, and 
cooking skills are powerful deterrents to cooking at home.23 Public policies aimed at 
promoting healthier diets on a budget, a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
need to take these multiple considerations into account.57
