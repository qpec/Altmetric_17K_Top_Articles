Abstract
Objective—A recent HIV outbreak in a rural network of persons who inject drugs (PWID) 
underscored the intersection of the expanding epidemics of opioid abuse, injection drug use (IDU), 
and associated increases in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We sought to identify U.S. 
communities especially vulnerable to rapid spread of IDU-associated HIV, if introduced, and new 
or continuing high rates of HCV infections.
Design—We conducted a multi-step analysis to identify which indicator variables were highly 
associated with IDU. We then used these indicator values to calculate vulnerability scores for each 
county to identify which were most vulnerable.
Methods—We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection reported to the National Notifiable 
Disease Surveillance System, 2012–2013, as a proxy outcome for IDU, and 15 county-level

 indicators available nationally in Poisson regression models to identify indicators associated with 
higher county acute HCV infection rates. Using these indicators, we calculated composite index 
scores to rank each county’s vulnerability.
Results—A parsimonious set of six indicators were associated with acute HCV infection rates 
(proxy for IDU): drug overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales, per capita income, white, non-
Hispanic race/ethnicity, unemployment, and buprenorphine prescribing potential by waiver. Based 
on these indicators, we identified 220 counties in 26 states within the 95th percentile of most 
vulnerable.
Conclusions—Our analysis highlights U.S. counties potentially vulnerable to HIV and HCV 
infections among PWID in the context of the national opioid epidemic. State and local health 
departments will need to further explore vulnerability and target interventions to prevent 
transmission.

Introduction
During the past decade, the U.S. opioid epidemic has fueled an increase in illicit injection 
drug use (IDU) and new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, especially within non-urban 
communities.1–6 For the first time, late in 2014, injection of prescription opioids was linked 
to an outbreak of HIV infections in a rural U.S. community (Austin in Scott County, 
Indiana). This event raised concerns about the vulnerability of similar communities to the 
rapid spread of HIV infection if introduced into a network of persons who inject drugs 
(PWID). The socioeconomic context within which this outbreak occurred was not unique: 
unemployment and poverty in the county exceeded national levels,7 educational attainment 
was low,7 and life expectancy was poor.8 During November 2014 – October 2015, 181 
persons were diagnosed with HIV infection, of whom 92% were coinfected with HCV.9 This 
county of approximately 24,000 persons reported fewer than five new HIV infections in the 
preceding ten years.9,10
Rapid recognition of the outbreak and implementation of intensive control efforts likely 
reduced new HIV and HCV infections and limited their geographic spread.9 Identifying 
jurisdictions particularly vulnerable to a similar outbreak can increase awareness of current 
vulnerability and guide public health efforts to detect and prevent this type of event. To this 
end, we conducted a multi-step analysis (Figure 1) to identify which set of indicators 
(independent variables) is highly associated with IDU, then used each U.S. county’s values 
for these indicators to calculate a vulnerability score for each county, and finally identified 
which states and specific counties are most vulnerable.

 Methods
Outcome variable
Nationally, there is no reliable county-level measure of IDU, the outcome of interest for this 
analysis. We therefore relied on a proxy measure for this behavior. We chose the county-
level rate of persons reported with confirmed acute HCV infection as the best proxy measure 
for the county-level rate of PWID for three reasons. First, the acute phase of HCV infection 
occurs very close in time to the injection event and is transitory.5,6 Although not all acute 
HCV cases are acquired through IDU and not all PWID get HCV, the county-level rates of 
acute HCV and IDU are assumed to have a fixed relationship that does not vary by time, 
place, or infection. Second, HCV is highly transmissible, especially through IDU, which is 
the primary risk factor for HCV infection.5,6 Third, acute HCV infections are reported 
nationally through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS).11 
Although the sensitivity of the NNDSS is limited,12 it has been demonstrated sufficient for 
other national-level analyses and the large majority of states and the District of Columbia 
voluntarily report cases.2,4,13
We included NNDSS data from 2012 and 2013. Counties in states that reported no acute 
HCV cases to CDC in 2012 or 2013 were excluded from the analysis (i.e., missing values). 
We applied the following rules to identify counties with zero cases of acute HCV infection 
from those with missing values in a given year. For states that reported >1 case, we assumed 
counties with no reported acute HCV cases had zero cases. For states that reported one case 
of acute HCV infection for one year and no cases in the other year, we assumed that all other 
counties had zero acute HCV cases during the one-case year and all counties had missing 
values for the other year. Thus, that state was included for the analysis in the one-case year 
and excluded in the other year because there was limited evidence the state was able to 
consistently identify and report acute HCV cases.
Potential indicator variables
We investigated county-level independent variables that were known or plausibly associated 
with IDU and that could thus potentially serve as indicators of vulnerability to rapid 
dissemination of HIV/HCV infection among PWID. We required that data for potential 
indicators be available nationally at the county level or transformable to the county level, 
reported at least annually, recent (ideally reported within the past three years), and complete 
(<10% of U.S. counties missing values). Data were transformed, if needed, by converting 
data aggregated by 3- or 5-digit ZIP codes to 5-digit county Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) codes using area proportion method. Forty-eight potential indicators were 
identified and considered from six domains: 1) drug-overdose mortality, 2) access to 
prescription opioids (e.g., production, sales, prescriptions), 3) access to care (e.g., evidence 
of use of care or treatment services related to IDU), 4) drug-related criminal activity (e.g., 
arrests for drug possession or sales), 5) prevalence of IDU (e.g., survey-based data), and 6) 
sociodemographic characteristics associated with geographic areas with higher IDU 
prevalence. Table 1 describes 15 of 48 potential indicators that met our inclusion criteria (see 
Supplemental Digital Content, Figure S1, which shows maps of the county-level indicators). 
Data from 2012 and 2013 were used when available since the indicators are intended to

 reflect current areas of vulnerability; when not available, we used data from the most recent 
year available. All indicators were treated as continuous numerical variables except presence 
of urgent care facilities and access to interstate within five miles of county border, which 
were dichotomous (yes/no). Descriptive statistics, including median, mean, first quartile and 
third quartile were calculated for the 13 continuous indicators; frequency and percentage 
were calculated for the two dichotomous indicators.
Regression modeling
We used modeling to identify a parsimonious set of IDU-associated indicators with the 
strongest association with our proxy measure of IDU: acute HCV infection. We modeled the 
rate of acute infections by county using a multilevel Poisson model with year (2012, 2013) 
nested in county and county nested in state with the county population set as the offset. We 
treated the states and counties as random effects to account for heterogeneity. Each of the 15 
indicators was modeled using a univariable Poisson random-effects model. Per-capita 
income and population per-square-mile were modeled on a log10 scale. We entered all 15 
indicators in a multivariable model and removed the indicator with the highest p-value, then 
removed and added indicators in a backwards stepwise procedure until all remaining 
variables had a p-value<0.05. We used this approach because we were aiming to identify 
indicators with the strongest association with county-level acute HCV infection rates rather 
than indicators causally associated with acute HCV infection, in which case step-wise 
modeling procedures are not recommended (see Supplemental Digital Content, Regression 
Modeling Analyses which describes the Modeling Procedure). We assessed the linearity 
assumption and collinearity of our continuous indicators (see Supplemental Digital Content, 
Regression Modeling Analyses which describes the Continuous Indicators Linearity 
Assessment and Collinearity Assessment of Indicators). Standardized regression coefficients 
were calculated from the final multivariable model to determine the relative contribution of 
each indicator (see Supplemental Digital Content, Regression Modeling Analyses which 
describes the Standardized Regression Coefficients).
Application of indicators to generate vulnerability scores
To calculate a vulnerability score for each county, we created a scoring dataset that 
contained the value for each of the final indicators by county. For drug overdose mortality 
rate, we imputed the median value for the indicator from the values among the bordering 
counties for 133 (4.2%) counties, assuming that the surrounding counties were most similar 
to the county with the missing value.14 We averaged indicator values if two years of data 
were available. For each county, we then multiplied the county’s value for each indicator 
variable by that indicator’s regression coefficient from the final model and summed to 
produce a vulnerability score. We ranked counties by their vulnerability scores from 1 to 
3,143 with a higher score indicating higher vulnerability.
To account for uncertainty in each county’s vulnerability score, we used simulation to 
estimate the 90% confidence interval (CI) for each county’s vulnerability score by drawing 
10,000 samples from a normal distribution for each regression coefficient. We identified a 
county as vulnerable when the upper 90% CI for that county’s vulnerability score exceeded 
or matched the vulnerability score for the 2,985th ranked county (i.e., lower threshold for the

 top 5% of counties with the highest vulnerability scores) (see Supplemental Digital Content, 
Composite Index (Vulnerability) Score and Rank, which describes the methodology for the 
vulnerability scores).
HIV proximity
For each vulnerable county, we sought to assess the likelihood that HIV might be introduced 
into a network of PWID in that county based on the prevalence of HIV infection in that 
county and nearby. We defined “HIV proximity” as the weighted average rate of people 
living with diagnosed HIV infection (PLWH) in and around that vulnerable county at year-
end 2012. We demarcated a 20-mile buffer zone around the border of each vulnerable county 
based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation National Household Travel 
Survey that the average daily distance traveled per person per day was 36 miles 
(approximately 20 miles when rounded for a radius).15 Using a method of spatial 
smoothing,16 we calculated the area proportion of each county adjacent to the vulnerable 
county that intersected the vulnerable county’s 20-mile buffer zone and the corresponding 
weighted numbers of PLWH and total population represented by the buffer zone. We 
summed these buffer zone values with the values for the vulnerable county to calculate an 
estimated HIV proximity rate of PLWH per 10,000 population. We used Jenks natural 
breaks to group counties by estimated HIV proximity.17
Results
The number of acute HCV infection cases reported to CDC in 2012 and 2013 were 1,778 
and 2,138 respectively. Of the reported cases, 1,710 (96%) in 2012 and 2,074 (97%) in 2013 
were reported from 2,970 counties with valid county FIPS codes and were included in 
modeling. There were 173 counties in 8 states, as well as the District of Columbia, with no 
data during 2012–2013; these jurisdictions were excluded from modeling analyses (Alaska, 
Arizona, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, and Wyoming). Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2.
In the univariable regression models, all indicators were significant at p<0.1, except mental 
health providers and percentage of the population without high school diploma (Table 2). 
We found neither substantial departures from linearity nor collinearity between the 
continuous indicators. Based on the final multivariable model, the following indicators were 
most significantly associated with the county-level acute HCV infection rate: drug overdose 
deaths per 100,000 population (regression coefficient [β] 0.016; p<0.0001), prescription 
opioid sales per 10,000 population (β 0.024; p=0.012), median per capita income, log base 
10 (β −2.181; p<0.0001), percent of population of white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (β 
0.027; p<0.0001), percent of population aged ≥16 years unemployed (β 0.038; p=0.0095), 
and buprenorphine prescribing potential by DATA 2000 waiver per 10,000 population (β 
0.002; p=0.0095) (see Supplemental Digital Content, Supplemental Results and Figures 2 
and 3, which describe the Model Fit Results, show the reported rate of acute HCV infection 
and model-estimated rate of acute HCV infection by county, and illustrate the model fit and 
90% confidence intervals for the counties identified as vulnerable).

 Vulnerability scores were calculated for all counties using the final model regression 
coefficients. We identified 220 counties in 26 states as vulnerable communities (Figure 2) 
(see Supplemental Digital Content, Supplemental Results and Tables 1 and 2, which 
describe the Composite Index (Vulnerability) Score and Rank and counties identified as 
vulnerable).
The estimated HIV proximity at year-end 2012 ranged from 0.9 to 37.6 per 10,000 
population (Figure 3). With one exception, the estimated HIV proximity for all vulnerable 
counties was lower than the national rate of 29.3 per 10,000 population.
Discussion
We have developed a method to identify U.S. counties vulnerable to rapid spread of IDU-
associated HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high numbers of HCV infections 
among PWID. The method employed a proxy measure for county-level IDU (i.e., acute 
HCV infection). Ecological-level measures have been used previously to create CDC’s 
Social Vulnerability Index. That index was designed to identify socially vulnerable 
populations that are more likely to be adversely affected during disaster events (e.g., elderly, 
people living in poverty).18 It assesses overall census tract vulnerability on the basis of 14 
census variables and calculates an overall percentile rank of social vulnerability for each 
area.18 Our method builds on this approach by first identifying the specific indicators 
associated with HCV (proxy for IDU). We then calculated an index score to rank counties as 
well as account for the relative contribution of each indicator to identify the most vulnerable 
communities. The evolution of IDU in the United States is dynamic and this method can be 
applied periodically to account for those changes. Improved reporting of acute HCV 
infections to NNDSS and the identified indicators will increase the accuracy of the method 
for identifying vulnerable counties over time.
Deaths from drug overdose have grown exponentially in the past decade, surpassing motor 
vehicle traffic accidents as the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in the 
United States.19 Overdose death rates due to prescription opioids increased nearly four-fold 
from 2000 to 2013.20 Prescription opioids are the most commonly abused prescription drug, 
and an estimated 10–20% of people who abuse prescription opioids escalate to injection of 
prescription opioids or heroin,21–23 creating opportunity for IDU-associated outbreaks of 
HIV or HCV infection.24,25 Rates of acute HCV infection have increased steadily 
nationwide from 2006–2012, most notably east of the Mississippi River and particularly 
among states in central Appalachia.4 The potential for an HIV outbreak within an opioid-
injecting population was realized in Scott County, Indiana,26 which ranked 32nd among the 
top 220 counties in our vulnerability analysis.
The demography of PWID and persons diagnosed with acute HCV infection in the United 
States has changed substantially. From 1999 to 2002, HCV diagnoses in the U.S. were 
greater among men, non-Hispanic blacks, and persons aged 40–49 years.27 Persons 
diagnosed with acute HCV infection now are equally likely to be male as female, are 
predominantly of white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, and younger age.2,4,13,28,29 Our finding

 that white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity significantly associated with county-level acute HCV 
infection reflects these changes.
The counties identified in our analysis were overwhelmingly rural. Since 2006, rates of acute 
HCV infection have increased faster in rural than in urban areas4 consistent with 
introduction and spread of this infection into populations made newly vulnerable by the 
expansion of IDU in rural America. The outbreak in Scott County, IN was notable for the 
absence or minimal availability of harm-reduction strategies to prevent IDU-associated HIV 
and HCV infections, such as addiction treatment and rehabilitation, medication-assisted 
therapy (MAT), and syringe service programs (SSPs).9 This outbreak illustrated the need for 
harm-reduction strategies suited to the rural context. Our analysis can help identify those 
rural areas at highest risk of infectious complications from IDU where interventions can be 
prioritized. Unemployment and income were also significantly associated with risk for acute 
HCV infection. It has been hypothesized that financial stressors increase vulnerability to 
drug use so that young adults in economically deprived areas may accumulate more risk 
factors for drug use and be more likely to establish drug dependencies at a younger age than 
persons in more economically privileged areas.30 Since the Great U.S. Recession of 2007–
2009, rural areas have experienced persistent and greater unemployment and poverty than 
urban areas.31
Buprenorphine is approved for MAT of opioid use disorder. The indicator “buprenorphine 
prescribing potential by waiver per 10,000 population” represents the potential availability 
of this form of MAT to the population of a county, reflecting the capacity to treat in response 
to demand for services and not the actual rate of people receiving treatment.32 In 2011, 43% 
of U.S. counties had no buprenorphine-waivered physicians,32 indicating that capacity to 
prescribe MAT likely lags behind the need. It is important that these indicators are not 
interpreted as causally associated, rather are understood as indicators of potential 
vulnerability for this type of outbreak.
The risk for introduction and spread of HIV infection into a vulnerable community of 
persons will vary according to the estimated HIV proximity of the community and the 
community’s IDU practices. Although estimated HIV proximity was lower than the national 
average for nearly all of the 220 counties identified as most vulnerable, it is important to 
consider the estimated HIV proximity in the context of local IDU practices and their 
identification as a vulnerable county. Scott County, IN was not in the highest estimated HIV 
proximity group, but the injection practice in Scott County, IN was notable for the high 
frequency of injections and combined with the relatively large and dense network of PWID9 
in the absence of effective strategies to reduce IDU-associated infection leaving the 
community vulnerable to this type of outbreak.
All health officials can review these results along with the most recent sources of data on 
HIV and acute HCV diagnoses available to them. Additional local insight may be gained by 
examining data sources about other factors associated with IDU that were not available for 
inclusion in our analysis. There are a number of indicators we would like to consider that are 
not available nationwide but may provide substantial local insight. These data include 
emergency department and hospital admissions for drug overdose or intoxication; arrests for

 drug possession or sales; and opioid prescribing patterns from state prescription drug 
monitoring programs.33 CDC is preparing additional advice to assist health departments so 
they can assess whether their jurisdiction is experiencing or at risk of new HIV and HCV 
infections potentially related to IDU (personal communication).
This analysis is subject to limitations. First, we excluded potential indicators, as noted 
above, because we established strict inclusion criteria to assess vulnerability for each county. 
Second, this analysis was intended to identify areas currently vulnerable; however, some of 
the data were ≥3 years old. Third, all ecologic analyses based on reported cases of notifiable 
disease and deaths are subject to potential underreporting (e.g., HCV data) or 
misclassification (e.g., cause of death) biases. Reporting of acute HCV infections to NNDSS 
is susceptible to underreporting12 not only because reporting is passive and voluntary but 
also because the surveillance case definition captures only persons with symptoms of an 
illness that is often asymptomatic. These limitations are likely similar throughout the United 
States and we are unaware of any systematic differences that would meaningfully bias 
indicator selection. The implementation of complete and timely acute HCV surveillance by 
all states will increase the accuracy of this method. Fourth, the HIV proximity measure 
might not accurately measure risk of IDU-associated HIV transmission. Our estimate is 
limited by the distance of the buffer zone selected and may not reflect the population 
distribution within each county or underlying characteristics of PLWH in these areas (e.g., 
percent with suppressed viral load). Lastly, the indicators used may result in bias against 
identifying urban areas as vulnerable since the percentages of certain characteristics (e.g., 
percentage white, non-Hispanic) are lower in urban counties. However, the historic 
concentration of IDU in urban areas has likely resulted in these areas having already taken 
preventive actions (e.g., SSPs, access to MAT) to reduce risk for infections from IDU.
Prompted by a recent outbreak of HIV infection among PWID in a rural community, we 
developed a method to identify other communities vulnerable to rapid dissemination of IDU-
associated HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high numbers of HCV infections. 
Identification of a county as vulnerable to this type of outbreak does not mean an outbreak is 
eminent; rather jurisdictions identified as at-risk might use potentially informative local data 
that were not available nationally and take action as recommended in the April 2015 CDC 
Health Alert Network advisory.34 Expanding epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and 
IDU and shifting demography and geography, heralded by national changes in patterns of 
acute HCV infection, are critical driving forces of vulnerability. To reduce vulnerability, 
targeted interventions in accordance with efforts to prevent and treat substance use disorder 
and to reduce risk of infectious complications of IDU are warranted.

Definition
1. Drug overdose mortality 
(drug overdose deaths per 
100,000 population)
National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS)/National 
Vital Statistics, 2012 and 
2013
Drug overdose deaths were extracted using the ICD-10 based on the 
following underlying cause of death codes: X40-X44 (unintentional); X60-
X64 (suicide); X85 (homicide); Y10-Y14 (undetermined intent). County-
level rates were calculated per 100,000 population using US Census 
population estimates for 2012 and 2013.
2. Prescription opioid sales 
(Prescription opioid sales per 
10,000 population)
Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) - 
Automation of Reports and 
Consolidated Orders 
System (ARCOS), 2013
The rate of morphine milligram equivalent kilograms sold of opioid pain 
relievers per 10,000 population in 2013 were transformed from 3-digit ZIP to 
5-digit county FIPS using an area proportion method. The rate for the 3-digit 
ZIP within which the county centroid is located was applied to the entire 
county.
3. Mental health services 
(Mental health providers per 
100,000 population)
Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, 
National Provider 
Identification, 2014
Mental health providers include psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed 
clinical social workers specializing in mental health care. The rate was 
calculated as the number of mental health providers per 100,000 population 
(2010 Census).
4. Insurance coverage (Percent 
of population without insurance 
coverage)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The number of person without health insurance coverage was divided by total 
civilian noninstitutionalized population.
5. Urgent care facilities 
(Presence, Yes/No, of an urgent 
care facility)
HSIP 2012 Gold Database
Urgent care is defined as the delivery of ambulatory medical care outside of a 
hospital emergency department on a walk-in basis without a scheduled 
appointment. This indicator was dichotomized to yes – at least 1 urgent care 
facility or no – no urgent care facility. Publication date: 07/17/2009.
6. Vehicle availability (Percent 
of households with access to a 
vehicle)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The number of households with a vehicle available divided by the total 
estimated number of households per county.
7. Access to interstate 
(Highway/interstate access 
within 5 miles)
ESRI maps and data, 2014
At least 1 interstate or major US highway exit in or within 5 miles of the 
county border. Edition date: 06/30/2010.
8. Education (Percent of 
population without high school 
diploma)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The number of persons aged 25 years and older with less than a 12th grade 
education (including individuals with 12 grades but no diploma) divided by 
the estimated county population age 25 years and older.
9. Income (Per capita income, 
log base 10)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The mean income per person in the county; derived by dividing the total 
income of all people 15 years and older by the total population; modeled as 
log base 10.
10. Population density 
(Population per square mile)
US Census
The average population per square mile per county; modeled as log base 10.
11. Poverty (Percent of persons 
in poverty)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
Poverty levels were defined by the Census Bureau, which uses a set of 
income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine 
who is in poverty. If a family’s total income is less than the family’s 
threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty. 
The number of persons in poverty was divided by the estimated total county 
population.
12. Race/ethnicity (Percent of 
population of white, non-
Hispanic race/ethnicity)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The number of persons who reported they were not Hispanic or Latino and 
were of white race alone divided by the estimated total county population.
13. Unemployment (Percent of 
population unemployed)
American Community 
Survey, 2012 and 2013 5-
year estimates
The number of civilian persons unemployed and actively seeking work 
divided by the estimated total civilian population aged 16 years and older.
14. Urban/Rural status (NCHS 
Urban/Rural continuum 
classification)
NCHS, 2013
Counties were categorized into 1 of 6 categories based on Office of 
Management and Budget’s February 2013 delineation of metropolitan 
statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas. Categories include: 1) 
Large central metro, 2) Large fringe metro, 3) Medium metro, 4) Small 
metro, 5) Micropolitan, and 6) Non-Core.
15. Buprenorphine prescription 
capacity (Buprenorphine 
prescription capacity by DATA 
SAMHSA DATA 2000 
Program Information, 2014 
(restricted data set)
The total number of patients each DATA-waived physician could prescribe 
to, either 30 or 100, as of June 2014 were transformed from 5-digit ZIP to 5-
digit FIPS using an area proportion method. County-level rates were
